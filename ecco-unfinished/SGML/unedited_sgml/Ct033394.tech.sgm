Dependant on a Formidable and well-Di&s;ciplined
Navy; and the Encrea&s;e and Encouragement of

<P>In Two PARTS.</P>
<P>PART I. Demon&s;trating the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Formidable Navy, what
our <HI>Naval Force</HI> is, in Number of Ships, their Names, Rates, Men,
and Guns, the Method of Manning the Navy; the Seamen's Treat|ment,
and manner of Payment, and therein divers Hard&s;hips that
they &s;uffer; the Prejudice accrueing to the Government, (and Nation
in general) thereby; as well as by the late manner of Impre&s;&s;ing; the
Inconveniencies thereof demonstrated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>PART II. Containing an humble Propo&s;al for removing the afore|&s;aid
Grievances; and giving due Encouragement to the Seamen: ef|fectually
Manning the Navy at all times, in few Days, and there|by
$aving to the Government Three or Four Hundred Thou&s;and
Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> in time of War, and be no Charge, but rather
&s;ave Monies in time of Peace: With a brief touch on <HI>Greenwich</HI>

<P>THat a Naval Force is nece&s;&s;ary, we may learn from the &s;ituation
of the&s;e Kingdoms, which Providence hath &s;o di&s;pos'd, that
without the benefit of Navigation, we &s;hould not only lo&s;e the un|&s;peakable
Advantage that accrues by the Exportation of our Woollen
Manufactures, and other Merchandizes of the growth and produce of
the&s;e Kingdoms, but al&s;o be utterly depriv'd of all Corre&s;pondence
and Communication with our neighbour Nations, and al&s;o with our
numerous Colonies and Plantations abroad, who&s;e &s;ole dependence
for protection and &s;upply, is on the&s;e Kingdoms; the which if inter|rupted
by Foreign Force, would not only reduce them to Hard&s;hips
and Nece&s;&s;ity, but al&s;o expo&s;e them, as well as the&s;e Lands, to the
In&s;uits of every Enemy, and cau&s;e them to become a Prey, and to &s;ub|mit
to the Yoak of every proud Invader.</P>
<P>This will further appear, if we con&s;ider the Honour and
Renown particularly applicable to the Engli&s;h Nation, the which as
it was gained, &s;o it mu&s;t be maintained by the Strength, Valour and
Prowe&s;s of our Forces by Sea, and that cannot be without a &s;ufficient
and well di&s;ciplin'd Navy, which mu&s;t be formidable, by rea&s;on our
Neighbours (<HI>France</HI> e&s;pecially) within the&s;e few years by prudent
precaution and good management, in breeding up, exerci&s;ing and well
di&s;ciplining Mariners for their Service, are become &s;o potent, that in
the late War which continued near 10 years, notwith&s;tanding the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="3" REF="6">
of our powerful Ally (the <HI>Hollander</HI>) our Merchandize was
much interrupted, our Lo&s;&s;es many, whole Squadrons &s;everal times
defeated, <HI>viz. The</HI> We&s;t-India <HI>Fleet under Convoy of the</HI> Norwich,
<HI>and other Men of War, The</HI> Straights <HI>Fleet and Squadron under
Sir</HI> George Rook, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Great part of the grand Fleet put to flight,
and chas'd into our own Harbours, <HI>viz. The Earl of</HI> Torrington,
<HI>joined with a Squadron of</HI> Dutch, <HI>after the lo&s;s of &s;everal Ships was
pur&s;u'd into the</HI> Downs, <HI>and in danger of being de&s;troy'd:</HI> Our Land

with mo&s;t Princes of <HI>Europe.</HI> And if we con&s;ider his pre&s;ent Alli|ance
and Conjunction with, or rather ab&s;olute Government over the
exten&s;ive and rich Dominions of <HI>Spain,</HI> it too evidently demon&s;trates
what we mu&s;t expect from tho&s;e united Powers, if not prevented by
a &s;peedy, prudent and effectual regulation of our Navy, and encrea|&s;ing
and encouraging our Seamen, which in appearance is the only
rea&s;onable and probable means to put a &s;top and curb to the growing
Power, and ambitious De&s;igns and Incroachments of that potent and
politick Prince, who already &s;eems to di&s;pi&s;e the whole Power of
<HI>Europe.</HI> The Con&s;ideration whereof I hope will put to &s;ilence tho&s;e,
that would by undervaluing our Enemies, and overpri&s;ing our own
Strength and Naval Discipline, ob&s;truct a work de&s;igned not only for
the pre&s;ent advantage of the Nation, in &s;aving much more Money in
few years in ca&s;e of a War, than the Q's and R's would do in many
(the which at the be&s;t is but &s;aved from the Poor; many of whom
are ready to peri&s;h) and would al&s;o for ever remove tho&s;e Hard&s;hips,
which of late have render'd His Maje&s;ty's Service grievous to the Sea|men,

<P>OUR Royal Navy, as by this Table, being according to the be&s;t
Account I can at pre&s;ent have, con&s;i&s;ts of 180 Fighting
Ships, including tho&s;e of the 5th and 6th Rate (be&s;ides 11 Fire-Ships,
13 Bomb-Ve&s;&s;els, and about 70 Sail of Sloops, Yatchts, Store-Ships,
and other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. But in ca&s;e of fixed Battles or Sea-Fights
<PB N="4" REF="7">
the 5th and 6th Rate Ships are &s;eldom u&s;ed in the Line of
Battle, and are indeed more &s;erviceable for Convoys, Crui&s;ers, and
the like Services. This Royal Navy, as well Strangers as our own
Nation, for Number of Ships, their Burthen, Force, Compleatne&s;s
of Building, and Excellency of Sailing in general, have de&s;ervedly
e&s;teemed to excel all others in the World: The Cannon wherewith
they are mounted in time of War, are in Number near 10000 Bra&s;s
and Iron, and are for Nature and Make according to the former Di&s;|po&s;ition
and Manner of our Mariner's Fighting (who&s;e Cu&s;tom was to
fight Board and Board, Yard-Arm and Yard-Arm, Through and
Through, as they termed it, and not at a di&s;tance in a Line, and the like,
which Practice till of late our Seniors &s;ay they were Strangers to,)
they are therefore much &s;horter and of larger Boar than the French,
with whom to fight at a di&s;tance is very di&s;advantageous, as has been
ob&s;erved in &s;everal Fights of late, their Balls or Bullets flying over
our Ships, before ours could reach them by a Mile (but this by In|formation)
and &s;uppo&s;ing it Fact, it mu&s;t needs be di&s;advantageous to

<P>ITS to be con&s;idered, the Strength of the Navy con&s;i&s;ts not in the
Ships only, but as they are well equipt and manned with &s;ober,
judicious, experienc'd and courageous Commanders and Officers, with
a &s;ufficient Number of able Seamen, both for defending them&s;elves
and offending the Enemy; and in ca&s;e we fail here, ruin mu&s;t enevi|tably

the Commander, (<HI>viz.</HI> as the Captains of the <HI>Diamond, Jer&s;ey,</HI>
and <HI>New Port&s;mouth, &amp;c.</HI>) or for want of a &s;ufficient Number of

of being Walls and Bullwarks to defend, prove as &s;o many de|&s;erted
and &s;trong Fortre&s;&s;es to annoy (I may &s;ay de&s;troy) us. Our
Ance&s;tors therefore did prudently take the utmo&s;t Care to im|ploy
and prefer in the Navy &s;uch &s;ober, brave, and judicious Com|manders
and Officers as had &s;ignalized them&s;elves both by Cou|rage
and Conduct, as well in Merchant-Men as Men of War on all
<PB N="5" REF="8">
occa&s;ions (an Example well worthy imitation) but to a&s;&s;ert how far
this Method was either practis'd or neglected in the late War, being
in a great Mea&s;ure a Stranger to the Merits of the Gentlemen im|ployed,
I &s;hall rather forbear to mention than take common Fame
or Report for my Author, and &s;ubmit it to the Nation's Experience
to determine.</P>
<P>The Officers imployed are Admirals, Vice Admirals, Rear Admirals,
Commanders in chief, Captains and Lieutenants, all appointed by Com|mi&s;&s;ions
from the Lord High Admiral of <HI>England, Ireland, &amp;c.</HI> or Lords
Commi&s;&s;ioners for Executing that Office: (and of tho&s;e &s;ome tell us,
there are always two, or more, waiting for one Commi&s;&s;ion) their
Pay and Encouragement is according to the Honour of their Po&s;t and
Tru&s;t, &s;o con&s;iderable, that Noble-men of our own Nation, as well
as tho&s;e of others, have gladly embraced the &s;aid Imployments.</P>
<P>The Flag-Officers, or Admirals, (that are now in command) are,
Admiral of the Red, and Commander in Chief of the Fleet)
the Right Honourable Sir <HI>George Rook.</HI> Vice Admiral None. Rear
Admiral Capt. <HI>Benbow.</HI> Admiral of the Blew, the Right Honourable
Sir <HI>Cloud&s;ley Shouell.</HI> Vice Admiral, Col. <HI>Hop&s;onn.</HI> Rear Admiral,
Capt. <HI>Munden.</HI> There being no White Squadron at Sea, the Flags
in Half-pay, as I am inform'd, are the Right Honourable the Mar|qui&s;s
of <HI>Carmarthen,</HI> Admiral <HI>Killigrew,</HI> and Sir <HI>Ralph Dallivall.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Flag-Officers, there is to every Fir&s;t, Second, Third,
Fourth and Fifth Rate Ship a Captain, and one or more Lieutenants,
according to their Rates, as by the Table (<HI>Pag.</HI> 3.) appears. The
Commanders of the Sixth Rates are for the mo&s;t part only Ma|&s;ters
and Commanders, and not Captains, and are not entituled to
Half-pay; but all tho&s;e are al&s;o appointed, and have their Commi&s;|&s;ions
and Warrants from the Lord High Admiral, or Lords Commi&s;&s;i|oners
for executing that Office. The number of the Captains entituled
to Half-pay, appears by the &s;aid E&s;tabli&s;hment to be 195, be&s;ides &s;ome
that were &s;u&s;pended and have of late gotten their Su&s;pen&s;ion off,
and about 40 Commanders that have commanded Sixth Rate Frigots,
Bomb Ve&s;&s;els, and the like, that do not take Po&s;t, neither are account|ed
in the &s;aid Number. Under tho&s;e Captains there are Lieutenants,
Ma&s;ters, Gunners, Boat&s;wains and Carpenters, with other Warrant
and Petty Officers, according to the Rates of the Ships, as appears
by the &s;aid Table, who with the Officers Servants, ordinary Seamen,
Gromets, (or well grown Lads) and Boys, were always accounted
in the late War (taking the Navy through) to be near two thirds of
<PB N="6" REF="9">
their Complement: So that if 40000 Men be required to man the
Navy, (according to the e&s;timate given the Honourable Hou&s;e of Com|mons
the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>November</HI> 96) and two thirds of tho&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> 26666,
are Officers, and Officers Servants, ordinary Seamen, Landmen, Gro|mets,
and Boys, the other third, <HI>viz.</HI> 13334, able Seamen, be&s;ides
Officers, are as many as were at any time employ'd in the Navy, du|ring
the late War; and 16 or 18 Thou&s;and Seamen, are by many Com|manders
judg'd &s;ufficient effectually to navigate and fight the &s;ame.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">De&s;cribing the Methods u&s;ed to Man the Navy, and the Rea&s;ons of
the Seamens backwardne&s;s to enter into the Service.</HEAD>
<P>AS for the Warrant and many petty Officers, they generally en|tring
voluntarily for the benefit of the &s;aid Employments, I
&s;hall con&s;ider the manner of procuring the common (able and ordina|ry)
Seamen, under which Titles all able bodied Landmen are inclu|ded,
which is thus.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t by inviting them by Proclamation, beat of Drum, and other
publick Notice, to enter into the Service, with a promi&s;e of Gratuity,
or Reward, to &s;uch Mariners and able bodied Landmen as enter'd
them&s;elves by a certain prefixed time; which Gratuity has &s;ometimes
been Three Pounds Nine Shillings to every able Seaman, as well
Ma&s;ters, Mates, and all petty Officers, as others, and to every ordi|nary
Seaman, and able bodied Landman, Two Pound Fourteen Shil|lings;
which Gratuity, with His Maje&s;ty's allowance of Wages and
Provi&s;ions, is &s;ufficient to engage Men to de&s;ire and covet His Maje|&s;ty's
Service. Neverthele&s;s Experience informs us, that mo&s;t part of
tho&s;e that enter them&s;elves are Mates and Mid&s;hipmen, and &s;uch as
expect other Offices and Imployments, which Imployments alone
would engage them to enter them&s;elves if no &s;uch Bounty were given,
&s;o that the Bounty given an&s;wers not the end intended by it, few
common able Seamen entering them&s;elves for the &s;ame. The Rea|&s;ons
whereof will appear by what en&s;ues.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the late War &s;everal hundreds enter'd them|&s;elves
Volunteers in the Service, and marched chearfully many Miles
by Land to &s;erve their King and Country, but this continued not long,
for in&s;tead thereof they became aver&s;e to the Service, and as many
thou&s;ands de&s;erted from it, ab&s;conded, and hid them&s;elves till the
Fleet has been manned and put to Sea (which has been for great
<PB N="7" REF="10">
part of the Year) and &s;o became u&s;ele&s;s and a Burthen to the Nati|on,
by reducing their Families to Poverty, and becoming chargeable
to the Places where they inhabited: Wherefore it will not be ami&s;s
to enquire into the Rea&s;ons and Occa&s;ions thereof. Fir&s;t, Is not the
Danger of Battle and Seamen's Cowardize one Rea&s;on why they a|void
the Service? To this I an&s;wer negatively: They never being &s;o
much as charged with Cowardize or Backwardne&s;s to engage the E|nemy
when commanded to fight; but on the contrary have often pro|voked
their Commanders to it, and ready to tare their Hair, when
through the Cowardize or Backwardne&s;s of their Commanders they
have been kepr from engaging, and &s;o lo&s;t their Purcha&s;e. For In|&s;tance,
<HI>not only the Ships afore&s;aid, but al&s;o the Captain of the</HI> Tyger,
<HI>and divers others have by Cowardize lo&s;t many Prizes which they might
have taken.</HI> But the Rea&s;ons the Seamen give, are chiefly the Evil
Treatment, and other Hard&s;hips they endured in the Service; and
tho&s;e principally complain'd of are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Captains promising tho&s;e that enter, that they &s;hall be
preferred to con&s;iderable Employments, as Ma&s;ters Mates, Mid&s;hip|men,
and the like, of which there is no performance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Their unkind, and (if I may &s;ay as they do) cruel Treatment,
when on Board.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The turning them over from Ship to Ship, contrary to Publica|tion,
and the di&s;advantage that accrues thereby.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Keeping them many years out of their Wages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The uncertain and intricate manner of Payments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Querying them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Making them Run, with many other Hard&s;hips of the like nature.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the Captains have promi&s;ed tho&s;e that have thus enter'd
them&s;elves, that they &s;hould be Ma&s;ters Mates, Mid&s;hipmen, and
the like, and accordingly they have acted as &s;uch, and officiated the
&s;aid Offices, but at the payment of the Ships the Captains Cooks,
Stewards, Servants, and other Favourites have receiv'd the Wages, and
reap'd the benefit of the &s;aid Employments, to the great Di&s;courage|ment
of able and ingenious Mariners: And though Multitudes of In|&s;tances
might be given, I &s;hall for brevity &s;ake trouble the Reader
with one In&s;tance only for Proof thereof. The which as it has been
related, is,</P>
<P>One <HI>Anthony Sollet</HI> of <HI>Scarbrough</HI> (who had for &s;everal years been
Mate of Colliers) about the year 92, in Compliance with the de|&s;ire
of a Member of Parliament, and Magi&s;trates of that Town, and
upon the promi&s;e of being made a Ma&s;ters Mate of the Ship, for
<PB N="8" REF="11">
which he enter'd, did encourage 50 Seamen more to enter with him
for His Maje&s;ty's Service, (16 of which were promis'd Mid&s;hipmens,
Quarterma&s;ters, and other Petty Offices and Imployments,) and accord|ingly
went on Board a Pre&s;s-Ve&s;&s;el appointed to receive them, and
&s;ailed to <HI>New-ca&s;tle,</HI> where the Ve&s;&s;el was laden with Coals; and
tho&s;e Volunteers were lent by the Lieutenant to &s;everal Ma&s;ters of Col|liers
at 5 <HI>l.</HI> each to bring their Ships to <HI>London;</HI> and when they arriv|ed
at the <HI>Noure,</HI> in&s;tead of being put on Board the re&s;pective Ships for
which they enter'd them&s;elves, they were brought up to <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
and confined on Board the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el: Whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Anthony
Sollet</HI> having an opportunity leaped over-Board, and &s;wam a&s;hore,
and in that Condition went to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to the Member that encou|raged
them to enter them&s;elves, and acquainted him therewith, who in|formed
the Flag (under whom the Lieuetenant &s;ervd') thereof, and the
Lieutenant, with all the other Volunteers were immediately &s;ent for;
and the Men complaining, that the Lieutenant would not give them any
part of the Monies earned by them; the Flag ordered them one
half, <HI>viz. 50s.</HI> each, and allow'd the Lieuetenant the other half,
which the Men accepted, remembring the Old Proverb, (<HI>That half a
Loaf is better than no Bread;</HI>) but as to the Offices and Imploy|ments
promis'd, not one of the 50 had any more than common Sea|men's
Wages: The &s;aid <HI>S$llet</HI> indeed had the Honour to officiate as
Mid&s;hipman under the Flag, and &s;hould have received 45 Shillings
<HI>per</HI> Month for the &s;ame, but was paid off with <HI>23s. per</HI> Month, able
Seamen's Pay; and when di&s;charg'd from the Service, him&s;elf, with
&s;uch others as remain'd alive and were di&s;charg'd, return'd home to
give the Town an account of their kind Treatment, for a future In|couragement
to others to enter them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Second Complaint, is their Treatment on Board.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Of the new invented Names wherewith &s;ome of their Com|manders
and Officers con&s;tantly call them, <HI>viz. Sons of Eternal
Whores, Bl$ods of Eternal Bitches, &amp;c.</HI> And as they call, &s;o they
cur&s;e them with &s;uch horrid and bla&s;phemous Imprecations, and Lan|guage
that I even blu&s;h to mention, and were it not for hopes of refor|ming
the &s;ame, would never tran&s;mit to Po&s;terity &s;uch abominable
and athei&s;tical Expre&s;&s;ions; one or two (too many) of tho&s;e of late
invented and frequently u&s;ed, are enough to make one tremble. Some
Gentlemen di&s;cour&s;ing of the vicious and impious Expre&s;&s;ions of the
Officers of the Navy, <HI>viz.</HI> their calling on God to Damn their Bloods,
to cur&s;e them&s;elves, and the like Expre&s;&s;ions; a Commander of a
Merchant Ship, who had &s;erved in the Navy eight years, replyed,
that &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions were not to compare with what he had fre|quently
<PB N="9" REF="12">
heard from them; among&s;t others, one was their manner of
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Damn their Bloods, they would Roa&s;t their Souls in Hell.</NOTE> Cur&s;ing the Men; others have told them, they
would <HI>make them cur&s;e God and die,</HI> &amp;c. with many o|ther
impious Expre&s;&s;ions not fit to be mention'd.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As they e&s;teem, call, and cur&s;e them,
&s;o they u&s;e them, having with their new invented
Oaths, new invented Puni&s;hments, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;ordid
and &s;lavi&s;h Puni&s;hment of <HI>Whipping,</HI> or rather (as
them&s;elves term it) <HI>Fleaing them alive,</HI> and then <HI>Pickling of them.</HI>
The manner whereof is to fa&s;ten or tye a Man with his Hands and
Legs extended to the Black&s;takes, Cap&s;ton, or Jeers of the Ship, and
&s;trip him to the Wa&s;te, and with Whips of Cords, called <HI>Cats of
Nine Tails,</HI> divers have had &s;o many La&s;hes, as have made the
Puni&s;hment wor&s;e than Death (as &s;ome Inflictors have told them be|fore-hand,)
and being thus whipped, or rather flead, a Tub of Brine or
Pickle from their Salt Meat has been prepared; into which &s;ome (to
make the Puni&s;hment the greater) have caus'd more Salt to be put;
with which they have wa&s;hed their flead Bodies, and whipt and pickl'd
them again: The dread of which Puni&s;hment has not only caus'd
many to de&s;ert the Service, but al&s;o to indeavour to de&s;troy them|&s;elves:
And this Puni&s;hment (how cruel &s;oever it is) is now become
&s;o common, that Men are often thus treated on frivolous Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, His Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Betty,</HI> a 5th Rate, which fail|ed
for the Straits, after the Peace was concluded, who&s;e Comple|ment
being about 90 or 100 Men: The Captain being excellent at this
Exerci&s;e, and other Severities, &s;o many of his Men, (and tho&s;e the
be&s;t of his common Seamen) left the Ship, that he was forc'd to get
Spaniards, and other Foreigners to bring her home: Divers Complaints
thereof being made to the Lo$ds of the Admiralty, I &s;hall not mention
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Another In&s;tance, is, one <HI>John Wilkin&s;on,</HI> who belonged to His Ma|je&s;ty's
Ship the <HI>Sheerene&s;s</HI> in 1697, and being at <HI>Tobago</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI>
he was with the re&s;t of the Ship's Company forc'd to go on
Shoar and cut Timber, to carry to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> for the Captain's Ad|vantage;
by which means many of them were taken &s;ick and died;
and the &s;aid <HI>John Wilkin&s;on</HI> complaining that he was not well,
nor able to work any longer in that &s;lavi&s;h manner, the Captain
&s;ent the Doctor down to &s;ee whether he was really &s;ick or not,
who return'd and told the Captain, he could not &s;ay that he was &s;ick,
nor that he was well; whereupon the Captain &s;ent for him up, and
order'd him to be &s;trip'd, and &s;eiz'd to the Jeers, and to have, fir&s;t 20
Blows with a Cat of Nine Tails, and then 19 more, and then pick|led
<PB N="10" REF="13">
him; but the Captain not being &s;atisfied therewith, order'd him to
have 60 Blows more with another Cat, made of knotted Wier in&s;tead
of Cords; then Commanded him to beg Pardon, which when he had
complyed with, was ordered to have 19 Blows more, and then re|leas'd,
and &s;coffingly bid go to Sleep (in a mi&s;erable Pickle indeed,) and
this for no other rea&s;on (as I am inform'd) than what is aforementioned.</P>
<P>One In&s;tance more is of <HI>John Savage,</HI> who &s;erved in His Maje&s;ty's
Ship the <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;everal years, but happened to di&s;gu&s;t the Cap|tain,
in de&s;iring &s;ome Allowance for his &s;hare of Goods, that were
&s;av'd out of a Prize they had taken, which was afterwards &s;unk;
and the Captain finding an opportunity cha&s;ti&s;ed his In&s;olence: The
pretended occa&s;ion and manner whereof was as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> One
<HI>Hall</HI> that was Boat&s;wain of the Ship, (and the mo&s;t moro&s;s Man of
that Imploy in the Navy) having &s;truck the &s;aid <HI>Savage</HI> &s;everal times
with his Cane (without any ju&s;t Provocation) <HI>Savage</HI> took hold of his
Cane to prevent his &s;triking any more; which the Captain under&s;tand|ing,
told him, <HI>he had better been hang'd than offended,</HI> or Words to
that purpo&s;e; and that he would fir&s;t duck, and then flea and pickle
him; and accordingly order'd him to be made fa&s;t to a Rope prepared
for that purpo&s;e: The &s;aid <HI>Savage</HI> dreading this cruel Puni&s;hment,
endeavour'd to get loo&s;e and drown him&s;elf; which the Captain per|ceiving,
cau&s;ed his Hands to be &s;eized, or tied; and after having duck'd
him three times, then whipt and pickled him to that degree, that none
believ'd he could live, leaving &s;uch Marks of his Kindne&s;s in his Back,
that Men could bury their Fingers therein; of which Wounds he con|tinued
ill along time.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The confining Men 5 or 6 years, or more on board, with|out
Liberty to &s;ee their Friends or Families, or refre&s;h them&s;elves on
Shoar, or paying them any part of their Wages for their own, or Fa|milies
Sub&s;i&s;tance, who mu&s;t have peri&s;hed for want, (notwith&s;tand|ing
the Monies due to them in the Service,) had they not been &s;up|ported
by their Neighbour's Charity. <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Richmond</HI> commen|ced
Wages the fir&s;t of <HI>October</HI> 92, and ended the 8th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 98,
being almo&s;t 6 years. The <HI>Royal Oak</HI> commenced Wages the 1&s;t of
<HI>October</HI> 92, and ended the 3d of <HI>January</HI> 97-98;, being almo&s;t 5 years
and a half. The <HI>Norfolk, Lanca&s;ter, Lime, Swan,</HI> and divers o|thers
had upwards of 6 or 7 years Pay due, before they were paid.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Another Di&s;couragement, is the uncertain and intricate
manner of Payment lately practis'd, <HI>viz.</HI> At the Payment of &s;ome
Ships, the Men only that then belong'd to the Ships, and were pre|&s;ent,
were paid their Wages, and the Wives, Widows, and Relations
of &s;uch as were turned over into other Ships, or died on board, were
<PB N="11" REF="14">
left unpaid, <HI>viz.</HI> At the Payment of the <HI>Oak, Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and <HI>Canterbu|ry,</HI>
at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> in <HI>January</HI> 97-98;, and many other Ships at other Pla|ces;
the Men only that then belong'd to the Ships and were pre&s;ent,
(which are &s;eldom one fourth part of the Ships Company) were paid
their Wages, and all others left unpaid, although they had been 5 or
6 years without Payment. One In&s;tance of many hundreds, is <HI>John
Bartlet,</HI> who enter'd on board the <HI>Oak</HI> the 1&s;t of <HI>October</HI> 92, and was
turn'd over into the <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the 25th of <HI>June</HI> 95, and was
on board the &s;aid Ship when the <HI>Oak</HI> was paid off at <HI>Port&s;mouth:</HI>
His Wife in expectation of receiving his Wages for the <HI>Oak,</HI> when that
Ship was order'd to be paid, went to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and continued there a|bout
3 Months; but at the Payment of the Ship, was (with all o|thers
in the like Circum&s;tances) denied her Husbands Wages, and
forc'd to take up Money on the Credit of the Ticket, for defraying
the Expence of her &s;aid Journey; and at la&s;t (through Nece&s;&s;ity)
to &s;ell it at a very great Lo&s;s; which Ticket is yet unpaid; and &s;ome
thou&s;ands more for that, and other Ships, which were paid after the
&s;ame manner, have not their Monies that was earn'd 8 or 9 years
&s;ince; and there are about 100 Ships to be paid on the Li&s;t of Recalls
before them; and &s;ome of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People were con&s;trained
to pawn their Cloaths for Sub&s;i&s;tance, whil&s;t at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and on
the Road, although they would gladly have &s;old their Tickets at 7
or 8 <HI>s. per</HI> Pound Lo&s;s; but not being able to give Security again&s;t
&s;uch Iucumbrances as might happen, none would buy them.</P>
<P>2. At the Payment of many Ships it <HI>Chatham</HI> in the year 97, and
at other times, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Britannia, Queen, London, Vanguard,</HI> and
other Fir&s;t, Second, and mo&s;t Third Rates; not only the Per&s;ons that
actually belong'd to them were paid, but &s;uch as were turn'd over to
other Ships, and could he pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and tho&s;e who&s;e
Wives, Widows, Fathers, Mothers, Brothers or Si&s;ters, were per|&s;onally
pre&s;ent, were paid; but the Wages of &s;uch who could not be
pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and who&s;e Wives, Widows, and Relations liv'd
at di&s;tances, and had imployed others to receive their Monies, were
then refus'd the &s;ame, and the Per&s;ons to whom it belong'd are yet
unpaid. For In&s;tance, <HI>Edmond Hall</HI> in the St. <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Sandwich,</HI>
and <HI>Thomas Cales</HI> in the St. <HI>Andrew, Britannia,</HI> and <HI>Dutche&s;s,</HI> and
divers others, which occa&s;ioned many Ticket-Buyers to forge Powers
to pretended Relations, to get their Monies paid, when as before&s;aid,
tho&s;e that were imploy'd for the Benefit or the Relations, neither
were, nor are paid to this time.</P>
<P>3. When Men have been turn'd over from one Ship to another, they
have &s;ometimes been paid their Wages for the Ships out of which
<PB N="12" REF="15">
they went, at the Payment of the &s;ame Ships, &s;ometimes at the Pay|ment
of tho&s;e Ships they were turn'd into, and &s;ometimes at the
Payment of neither; and at other times &s;ome of them only have
been paid, and many others left unpaid. For In&s;tance:</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Hampton Court</HI>'s Men were turned into the <HI>Rupert,</HI> and
their Wages for the <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> was paid at the Payment of the
<HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> the Ship out of which they came, and not at the
Payment of the <HI>Rupert.</HI></P>
<P>2. The <HI>Cumberland</HI>'s Men were al&s;o turn'd over into the <HI>Rupert,</HI>
and their Wages for the <HI>Cumberland</HI> paid at the Payment of the <HI>Ru|pert,</HI>
and not at the Payment of the <HI>Cumberland.</HI></P>
<P>3. The <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>'s Men were turned over into the <HI>Royal Katharine,</HI>
and part of them were paid, at the Payment of the <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and o|thers
promi&s;ed to be paid on board the <HI>Katharine,</HI> but were not paid
at the Payment of the <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> nor of the <HI>Royal Katharine,</HI> neither
were paid in 5 years after, <HI>viz.</HI> Among&s;t others, one <HI>Robert Will|&s;on,</HI>
who &s;erv'd in the <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> from the 1&s;t of <HI>July</HI> 92, to the 14th
of <HI>April</HI> 96, at which time he was turn'd over into the <HI>Royal Katha|rine;</HI>
his Wages for the <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> (including 10 <HI>l.</HI> due to him for &s;hort
Allowance of Provi&s;ions) amounted almo&s;t to 90 <HI>l.</HI> which Ticket he
was afterwards forc'd to &s;ell at a great Lo&s;s: Likewi&s;e the <HI>Hum|ber</HI>'s
Men were turned into the St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> the <HI>Britannia</HI>'s, St. <HI>An|drew</HI>'s
and <HI>Dutche&s;s</HI>'s Men, turned over from one to the other, and
the Wages for that time are not yet paid, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that by this means
many thou&s;ands of People are yet without their Monies, long &s;ince
earned.</P>
<P>4. Some Ships that have had &s;everal years Pay due, have been
paid for &s;ome Months only, the later time and the former left unpaid,
<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Woolwich</HI> commenc'd Wages the fifteenth of <HI>October</HI> 95; and
the Captain, with &s;ome of the Men, were turn'd into other Ships the
10th of <HI>March</HI> 96-97, and another Captain &s;erv'd in her between the 17th
of <HI>April</HI> 97, and the 15th of <HI>February</HI> 97-98;, and tho&s;e that &s;erv'd in her
for the la&s;t time were paid their Wages at <HI>London</HI> in <HI>Febr.</HI> 97-98;, but
tho&s;e that &s;erv'd in her for the former time were not paid until <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>
98 at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and many of them yet remain unpaid: Likewi&s;e
the <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and others, were paid in the &s;ame manner; and there
are now on the Li&s;t for Recalls about 170 Ships before the <HI>Woolwich,</HI>
and 220 before the <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to be recalled.</P>
<P>5. Many Ships have been paid without any publick notice given,
<HI>v$z.</HI> The <HI>Rupert-Prize</HI> at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> the <HI>Deptford</HI> at the <HI>Nour,</HI>
and others; &s;o that Per&s;ons could not appear at their Payments to re|ceive
their Monies, nor are the &s;aid Ships yet recalled.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16">
6. As the Payments have been uncertain, &s;o likewi&s;e have the Re|calls,
<HI>viz.</HI> About the years 96-97, the Ships were paid Alphabetically,
according to the Letters the Ships Names begun with, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Al|bemarle,</HI>
and all others of the Letter A fir&s;t, then tho&s;e of the Let|ter
B, and &s;o on, but that Method was again laid a&s;ide in 97, and the
Recalls were carried on, according to a Li&s;t publi&s;h'd, (which was the
fir&s;t of that Nature) on Mondays, Tue&s;days and Thur&s;days; but be|fore
one half of the Li&s;t was paid, it was again laid a&s;ide, and not
recall'd till <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April</HI> 1700; at which time it was again alter'd
to Tue&s;days only, and then but <HI>500l. per</HI> Week to be paid; &s;o that &s;everal
Ships of the Third and Fourth Rates were 3 Weeks, or a Month on
Recall, which might have been fini&s;hed in one or two days at mo&s;t, and
all the Ships paid according to that Method, which continued 20
Weeks, might have been paid in le&s;s than 10 days, but this Method
al&s;o ceas'd in <HI>October</HI> 1700, and the Li&s;t laid a&s;ide, and no further
Payments made thereon, until <HI>June</HI> 1701, which Li&s;t is not yet fully
paid; with other things too numerous to incert; which Practice, be|&s;ides
the trouble of continual Attendance in Expectation of Payment
(has put the people to va&s;t and unnece&s;&s;ary Expence, and) has been
the only Foundation and Support of the Trade of Ticket-Buying (&s;o
much exclaim'd again&s;t;) the people being credited whil&s;t from their
Habitations attending the Pay 5 or 6 Months, were forc'd to &s;ell their
Tickets at 7 <HI>s.</HI> or 8 <HI>s.</HI> per Pound Lo&s;s. Another Di&s;couragement is,</P>
<P>7. The putting Queries on &s;ick Men, and obliging them to return
on board as &s;oon as di&s;charged from &s;ick Quarters, which being ac|counted
&s;o great a Support to the Di&s;cipline of the Navy. I &s;hall
be more particular in de&s;cribing the &s;ame, agreeable in Sub&s;tance, with
what I formerly pre&s;ented the Right Honourable the Lords of the
Admiralty, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>It's the Practice of the Navy, for Brevity &s;ake, to u&s;e divers Let|ters
on their Books, to di&s;tingui&s;h the Rea&s;ons or Cau&s;es of Men's
Di&s;charge.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Letter <HI>D,</HI> which denotes a Man to be di&s;charged from
the Service.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The Letter R, denotes a Man to be a De&s;erter, or Run
from the Service.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Letters <HI>DD,</HI> which denote a Man to be di&s;charg'd
by Death.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Letters <HI>DSS,</HI> which denote a Man to be di&s;charged
by rea&s;on of Sickne&s;s,</P>
<P>Which were all the Letters formerly us'd, for that purpo&s;e: But in
<HI>March</HI> 1690-91 (&s;oon after the great Sickne&s;s and Mortality that hap|pen'd
<PB N="14" REF="17">
in the Navy) was invented the Query, and denoted on the Kings
Books by the Letters <HI>Q</HI> or <HI>Qr.</HI> This Query, according to its fir&s;t in|&s;titution,
the Captains were to put again&s;t the Names of all Per&s;ons
whom they &s;hould &s;et on &s;hoar Sick, unle&s;s they &s;ee ju&s;t cau&s;e to di&s;|charge
them from the Service, which the Captains often did, having no
hopes of their being further &s;erviceable; and in &s;uch ca&s;e they &s;ome|times
di&s;charged them with <HI>DSS,</HI> (only) as formerly, &s;ometimes they
noted the Malady or Di&s;temper which render'd them uncapable, as Bur|&s;ten,
Aged, Con&s;umptive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;omtimes made out Tickets &s;igned
by the Officers for their Wages. And to prevent the many Inconvenien|cies
that were like to attend tho&s;e Queries, divers Articles of In|&s;tructions
were given both to the Commanders and to the Commi&s;&s;i|oners,
and Agents, for taking care of Sick and Wounded Seamen, to
ob&s;erve. The Sub&s;tance of which are as followeth.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That when any Men were &s;et on Shoar &s;ick, their Cloaths and
Bedding &s;hould be &s;ent on Shoar with them, to prevent their being lo&s;t,
and for their Relief.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Commi&s;&s;ioners for Sick and Wounded, &s;hould take
care to return them to their Ships as &s;oon as recover'd, or to &s;ome o|ther
Ship, until they could meet with the re&s;pective Ships out of which
they came; and if none of His Maje&s;ty's Ships &s;hould be in that Port,
to give them Conduct-Money to travel to the next Port, where any of His
Maje&s;ty's Ships were.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That all Commanders &s;hould receive all Sick Men &s;ent on
board by the Agents for Sick and Wonded Seamen, and &s;hould put them
on board their re&s;pective Ships, as &s;oon as they &s;hould meet with them.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners, and all the Commanders of
His Maje&s;ty's Ships, &s;hould hold a con&s;tant Corre&s;pondence with each
other, that the Commanders might know how their Sick Men were di&s;|pos'd
of, in order to do both them and His Maje&s;ty Ju&s;tice, by giving
each Per&s;on &s;et a&s;hoar Sick, a proper di&s;charge: that is, &s;uch as died in
Quarters, note them to be dead on the Ships Books, and &s;uch as conti|nued
in Quarters, to note that, or if di&s;charg'd thence, how di&s;po|&s;ed
of, whether cured and order'd to return to their re&s;pective Ships,
or to any other Ship, or if not perfectly cured, to go to the Ho&s;pital, or
to their own Hou&s;es for Recovery, or if run from &s;ick Quarters, to
&s;et <HI>R's</HI> again&s;t their Names, to &s;ignify the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Directions for putting each Man's Number on the Ship-Book
in his Sick Ticket, for the better di&s;tingui&s;hing the Parties.</P>
<P>But how far tho&s;e In&s;tructions were complied with, and of what
advantage tho&s;e Queries have been, either to His Maje&s;ty's Service,
or the Seamen, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure appear by what follows, be|ing,
<PB N="15" REF="18">
as afore&s;aid, the Sub&s;tance of what was deliver'd to the Right

Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>viz. The principal Rea&s;ons for ma|king

<P><HI>The fir&s;t Rea&s;on given for making the&s;e Queries, was,</HI> That the Cap|tains
of &s;maller Ships complain'd, that when their Men were &s;et on
&s;hoar Sick, they return'd not to their proper Ships, but enter'd on board
the great Ships; and that by this means they often wanted Men.</P>
<P>That this Rea&s;on has little Weight, appears by the con&s;tant Prac|tice
of the Navy; in that &s;uch Ships (whether great or &s;mall) as
are order'd on any Expedition, if they want Men, are &s;upply'd out of
other Ships, and the mo&s;t and be&s;t parts of the &s;mall Ship's Companies
are frequently order'd on board the great Ships, and the &s;mall ones
left $o recruit their Complements again: be&s;ides, the &s;mall Ships be|ing
imploy'd in crui&s;ing, and the like; not one in ten of &s;uch &s;ick
Men could ever return to them, nor could it be anywi&s;e pre|judicial
to the Service, if the Men were on board any of His Maje&s;|ty's
Ships, being there ready to be order'd, where they might be
mo&s;t &s;erviceable; &s;o that this Rea&s;on cannot be &s;ufficient to bring
them under the Hard&s;hips of the Queries.</P>
<P><HI>The &s;econd Rea&s;on is,</HI> That &s;ome di&s;&s;embled and feign'd them&s;elves
Sick to get a Di&s;charge from the Service.</P>
<P>This Rea&s;on indeed agrees with many of their Officer's Opinions,
who always e&s;teem the Seamen to be Di&s;&s;emblers, till Death con|vinces
them of the contrary; Therefore they will not ea&s;ily be im|pos'd
on to &s;et any on &s;hoar, but &s;uch as are &s;ick indeed, as may be
amply prov'd by the Inhabitants of the Sea-Ports, who have been Eye-Witne&s;&s;es
of the many and &s;ad Spectacles of Mortality frequently &s;et
on &s;hoar; Some having peri&s;h'd in the Streets, and Others immedi|ately
after they were receiv'd into Quarters: And a Gentleman well
acquainted with tho&s;e Affairs, mode&s;tly computes our lo&s;s by Sickne&s;s
during the late War, to be above 40000 Men; <HI>a &s;lender Inducement
to believe them Di&s;&s;emblers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The third Rea&s;on is,</HI> That many after they recovered, enter'd into Mer|chant's
Service, and return'd not to any of His Maje&s;ty's Ships.</P>
<P>This Rea&s;on is al&s;o of little weight if we con&s;ider, that there were
thou&s;ands of Men di&s;charg'd every year in perfect Health, who might
without Oppo&s;ition &s;erve in the Merchants Ships: Now how rea&s;on|able
it is to require the &s;ick or half-recovered Men to return on board,
and at the &s;ame time di&s;charge &s;o many thou&s;and Men in health:
<PB N="16" REF="19">
I &s;hall &s;ubmit to better Judgments. But to proceed to the <HI>Objections.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. That &s;uch Men as returned not to their proper Ships
when recovered, but enter'd on Board the great Ships for lucre of His
Maje&s;ty's Bounty, ought to forfeit their Wages.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer:</HI> This I believe is not the Ca&s;e of one in a hundred, but
admit it were, His Maje&s;ty being graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow Bounty
to tho&s;e that enter'd them&s;elves voluntarily, altho they never &s;erv'd in
the Navy before, and al&s;o to tho&s;e who had &s;erved 6 or 9 Months only
in the great Ships, and had not been di&s;charged and paid off above 6
Weeks or 2 Months before they re-enter'd again: It &s;eems to be a great
Hard&s;hip, that tho&s;e who had &s;erved &s;everal years (and been turn'd over
from Ship to Ship, lo&s;t their Healths, and expended mo&s;t, if not the
whole of their Wages before recovered) &s;hould forfeit and loo&s;e 12
Months, or 2 Years Pay for receiving 3 <HI>l. 9 s.</HI> Bounty: and it &s;eems
a great Mi&s;tery to <HI>Query</HI> two or three hundred &s;ick Men, and oblige
them to return on board, and at the &s;ame time di&s;charge ten thou|&s;and
Men in perfect Health. For In&s;tance, the <HI>Brittania</HI> as afore&s;aid,
and 20 Sail of fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third Rate Ships, and many others were
&s;everal times paid off, and heir Companies di&s;charged; and at the &s;ame
time, tho&s;e that were &s;et &s;ick on &s;hoar <HI>Qu$ry'd</HI> if they did not return.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. That if the Queries are all taken off, it will relieve the
Guilty, as well as the Innocent.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer:</HI> If there be no &s;olid Rea&s;on for making the Queries, no
Per&s;on &s;hould lo&s;e his Wages by them; but admit it were rea&s;ona|ble
to make and continue the Queries, yet there is no Ground for
this Objection; for as before is explain'd, the Queries were only in|tended
to remain until the Commanders could have Advice from the
proper Officers what became of their Men, and therefore ought to
be &s;atisfied between them&s;elves, and to give the &s;ick Per&s;ons a pro|per
Di&s;charge, and tho&s;e only that R$nn to be noted with R's, as a|fore&s;aid;
and it is not the Query (even according to the Genuine
Con&s;truction of the Articles for making the Queries) that &s;hould be an
Ob&s;truction to the Payment of their Wages.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. That it will greatly add to the Nations Debt; there being
&s;everal thou&s;and Pounds due to Per&s;ons under tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, and
that the pre&s;ent Exigency of Affairs will not admit the rai&s;ing &s;uch
great Sums as will be required to pay them.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer:</HI> The greatne&s;s of the Debt can in no wi&s;e g$ve Colour
to this Objection; for the greater the Debt is, the more numerous
are the Poor that have a Right to the &s;ame, and may hope for the
&s;peedier Relief; and who&s;oever accounts it good Husbandry to &s;ave
the Nation's Revenues, by rendring His Maje&s;ty's Service grievous,
<PB N="17" REF="20">
and oppre&s;&s;ing the Poor: I cannot believe it will be &s;o e&s;teemed by
the Sage and mo&s;t Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly the great Council of the Nation.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. That if the Queries are all taken off now, they mu&s;t be
renewed in ca&s;e of another War.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer:</HI> To ground this <HI>Objection,</HI> three things mu&s;t be pre&s;up|po&s;ed,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That great Sickne&s;s and Mortality mu&s;t attend &s;uch &s;ucceed|ing
War, as did the late (which God forbid.)</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Seamen mu&s;t be as evily treated, and badly paid,
(the contrary whereof I hope.)</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the Queries will be of advantage to His Maje&s;ty's
Service; which I conceive will appear to be otherwi&s;e, as well by
what's already hinted, as that which doth en&s;ue; and if &s;o, then there
is no ground for this Objection; for if the Number of the Sick be
&s;mall, they may be &s;pared; if they be well treated, duly encourag'd, and
frequently paid, they will voluntarily return to the Service; and if
the Queries have only been a Grievance in time pa&s;t, it cannot rea&s;on|ably
be expected they &s;hould be otherwi&s;e in time to come.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 5. That if the Queries &s;hould all be taken off, it would be
an Innovation and Breach of the Rules and Di&s;cipline of the Navy, and
tend to the overthrowing of the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer:</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s this <HI>Objection</HI> &s;eems to have great weight;
for if the Di&s;cipline of the Navy (wherein our Safety &s;o much de|pends)
&s;hould be de&s;troy'd, the Lo&s;s would be irrepairable for the
Rea&s;ons aforementioned.</P>
<P>But as that was never de&s;ign'd, &s;o it could not be the Effect of
this Undertaking, which was only intended for the Con&s;ideration of
the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons; who I doubt not, if the &s;ame
&s;hould ever be thought worthy their In&s;pection, would &s;ee ju&s;t Cau&s;e
to regulate the pre&s;ent Di&s;cipline of the Navy, for regaining the
Credit thereof, and rebuilding the decayed Walls of the Nation (the
Naval Force I mean) which were the only things de&s;ired.</P>
<P>And as a further An&s;wer to this <HI>Objection,</HI> I &s;hall give &s;ome few of
many Particulars, wherein the Per&s;ons principally concerned, in mak|ing
and continuing tho&s;e Queries, have fail'd in their Duties, and de|viated
from the the Rules and Di&s;cipline of the Navy.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the making the Queries is contrary to the antient Di&s;|cipline
of the Navy, is evident from what is before mentioned: for
until the latter end of the Year 1690, <HI>every Man who before that time
was &s;et on &s;hoar &s;ick, was thereby di&s;charg'd from the Service, and be|fore
the late War, his Wages immediately paid (without waiting for the
Payment of the Ship:</HI>) And as for the continuing of the Queries; the
<PB N="18" REF="21">
Practi&s;e, during the late War, was not any-wi&s;e coherent with the
Orders, In&s;tructions, or Intentions for making of them. For Example.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The intent of the Queries according to the expre&s;s Terms of
the In&s;tructions was, as afore&s;aid; <HI>That when any Per&s;on was recove|red
from his Sickne&s;s, he &s;hould be received on Board any of His Ma|je&s;ty's
Ships, if the Ship to which he belonged were not pre&s;ent, and to
continue there until he could be put on Board his proper Ship, and no
longer; but the Methods taken, have &s;o far differed from the &s;ame,
that when any Ships have been in Port, and bound to the</HI> We&s;t-Indies, <HI>or
other foreign Voyages,</HI> they have taken out of the Ho&s;pitals, and &s;ick
Quarters, all &s;uch Men as were able to go on board, (and many of
them not half recover'd,) although they belong'd to other Ships (a
ready way to return them, to their Long Homes, I mean,) and may be
ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected one of the greate&s;t Cau&s;es of the Sickne&s;s and Mor|tality
that happen'd in the Fleet. For In&s;tance: <HI>The</HI> Che&s;ter, <HI>when
bound for the</HI> We&s;t Indies, <HI>took out of the Ho&s;pital at</HI> Plymouth, <HI>all
the Men that were in any mea&s;ure recover'd, and divers in a weak Con|dition,
which when the Chyrurgeon of the Ho&s;pital was charged with, he
could n$t deny; &s;o that by this means divers People have lo&s;t, not on|ly
their Relations, but al&s;o the Wages due for their Service, as well
in the Ships out of which they were &s;et &s;ick on &s;hoar, as for tho&s;e into
which they have been taken or impre&s;t, their &s;aid Friends not being able
to give any ac$$unt thereof, which is required of them.</HI> For In&s;tance,
Humphrey Minterne, <HI>who was &s;et on &s;hoar &s;ick at</HI> Plymouth, <HI>from
His Maje&s;ty's Ship the</HI> Port&s;mouth, <HI>in</HI> July 92, <HI>and as his Friends were
informed, died there; but by rea&s;on they cannot prove the &s;ame, al|though
they never &s;ince heard of him, his Wages is re$us'd to be paid;
which mu&s;t be occa&s;ion'd by his being taken, or put on Board &s;ome other
Ship in the manner afore&s;aid.</HI> I might in&s;tance <HI>James Bourge</HI> in the
Royal <HI>Katharine, &amp;c.</HI> but this may &s;uffice for Information.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Commanders did in no wi&s;e comply with their In|&s;tructions,
for holding a Corre&s;pondence with the Commi&s;&s;ioners for
&s;ick and wounded Seamen, but wholly neglected the &s;ame; &s;o that in|&s;tead
of making a right di&s;charge of the &s;ick Men, they remain'd Q'd,
and would all continue &s;o till Dooms day, did not &s;ome few by
Friends, Monies, great Expence, and long Attendance, get their Que|ries
removed.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Commi&s;&s;ioners for &s;ick and wounded Seamen, and
their Agents, have al&s;o fail'd, and not comply'd with the &s;aid Orders,
and In&s;tructions, not only in neglecting the &s;aid Corre&s;pondence with
the Commanders, but in omitting to note, in what Condition, whi|ther,
or to what Ship they di&s;charged the &s;ick Men, and al&s;o in not
<PB N="19" REF="22">
giving them the Conduct-Monies appointed for them, as may appear
by an In&s;tance or two, of hundreds that might be given, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Bearer <HI>William Bigger,</HI> belonging to His Maje&s;ty's Ship, Prince
of <HI>Orange,</HI> was &s;ent to this place &s;ick upon the 12th day of <HI>June</HI> 94,
and being cured, was di&s;charg'd the 4th of <HI>July</HI> 94 (but not &s;aid whi|ther:)
The Truth whereof is certified, he hath received in Cloaths to
the value of 00&mdash;00&mdash;00; and in Conduct Money 00&mdash;00&mdash;00.</P>
<P>By <HI>John Curcey,</HI> Chyrurgeon,

<P><HI>2dly.</HI> The Bearer <HI>William Parker,</HI> belonging to their Maje&s;ty's

to &s;eek his Ship, that might perhaps have been &s;ailed from the place
to which he was directed, before he was di&s;charg'd; as in the Ca&s;e
of <HI>Richard Lewis,</HI> who was di&s;charg'd from &s;ick Quarters to go to

In&s;tance more &s;ince the Peace concluded, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

day of <HI>December</HI> 97, to go forthwith to</P>
<P>He has receiv'd in Cloaths to the value of 0&mdash;0&mdash;0
and in Conduct Money&mdash;0&mdash;0&mdash;0
Witne&s;s my hand this <HI>20th</HI> day of
<HI>December</HI> 1697; by <HI>Peter Le|vermore,</HI>
appointed to take care
of &s;ick and hurt <HI>Seamen,</HI> at
<HI>God&s;port.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">
Of the like In&s;tances hundreds might be given: But hereby it may ap|pear,
That the&s;e Per&s;ons have been di&s;charged without their Conduct-Money,
or Direction to any Port, or any Ship, and generally with
little be&s;ides Rags to their Backs; or as the Sailors term it, a <HI>Neapo|litan
Che&s;t,</HI> being a Stocking full of Cloaths, (and well 'tis no bigger
to travel with, in &s;uch a Condition, from the remote&s;t part of the
Kingdom;) as a true Tar, <HI>more Rags than Manners;</HI> being thus ac|coutered,
he mu&s;t troop (a Scanderoon March, with one Shoe and
one Stocking, and neither worth a Farthing) through the Kingdom,
to &s;eek his Fortune, and unle&s;s he can prove by good Te&s;timony, that
he could not meet with his own Ship, and that he enter'd on board
&s;ome other of His Maje&s;ty's Ships, within one Month at the mo&s;t,
whether the Captain would receive him or not, his Query mu&s;t
not be taken off.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Commi&s;&s;ioners of His Maje&s;ty's Navy, or their Clerks,
or both, have deviated from the &s;aid In&s;tructions, for e&s;tabli&s;hing the
Queries.</P>
<P>1&s;t. In accounting many thou&s;ands to be Queried, whom the Cap|tains
(who alone were to make tho&s;e Queries) had di&s;charg'd without
a Query, Some by Tickets for their Wages, Others without, noting
only the D&s;s again&s;t their Names, as afore&s;aid, and &s;ometimes noting
on the Book the Infirmities for which they were di&s;charg'd, as Lame
Blind, Bur&s;ten, Decripped, and the like; yet tho&s;e as well as all o|thers
that were di&s;charg'd &s;ick, were accounted Queried, contrary to the
very intent of the &s;ame. The which, when Sir <HI>Richard Haddock</HI> was
fir&s;t inform'd of, being in the year 95, and above 4 years after the Que|ries
were made (this Practice being then introduc'd) He profe&s;t with
a great &s;urprize at the Publick Pay; <HI>That although he had been Comp|troler
of the Navy above 16 years, he was a Stranger to the Rules of
the &s;ame, and never knew a D&s;s accounted a Query before.</HI></P>
<P>2dly. They have al&s;o deviated from the &s;aid E&s;tabli&s;hment and Di&s;ci|pline,
in neglecting to take off &s;uch Queries as they might, and could
have done, by the &s;ick Accounts kept in the &s;ame Office. For In&s;tance;
Such Per&s;ons as die in &s;ick Quarters, and are noted &s;o to be in
their &s;ick Accounts, yet the Queries remain on the Pay-Books, and
has often ob&s;tructed the Payment of the Wages, and this by the neg|lect
afore&s;aid; When on the other hand, if any Per&s;ons are noted R S
on the &s;aid Accounts, They are as &s;ure to find the &s;ame in&s;erted on the
Pay-Books, as the Other neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The repeated Orders of the late Right Honourable the
Lords of the Admiralty to the Navy-Board, had that unhappy Effect,
to put an intire &s;top to the Wages of every Per&s;on that had been di&s;|charged
<PB N="21" REF="24">
by rea&s;on of Sickne&s;s, whether by Ticket, or without, al|though
they return'd to the re&s;pective Ships, out of which they were
put on &s;hoar, or died in &s;ick Quarters, or went on board &s;uch Ships as
directed, being all accounted to be Query'd; and tho&s;e Queries not to
be taken off, without the &s;pecial order and direction of the Admiral|ty-Board;
which cau&s;ed &s;everal hundreds to expend great part of their
Monies, in petitioning, and attendance, to take off the&s;e imaginary
Queries, which were before an&s;wered in them&s;elves: Of which an In|&s;tance
or two, for Information.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John Wilkin&s;on</HI> enter'd-on board the <HI>Expedition</HI> the fir&s;t day of
<HI>October</HI> 1693, and was di&s;charg'd the 26th day of <HI>December</HI> 1697&punc; by
rea&s;on of Sickne&s;s; and the Captain and Officers of the Ship &s;ign'd a
Ticket for his Wages: yet this Per&s;on, notwith&s;tanding his &s;aid Tic|ket,
was accounted Queried, and the Wages remains yet unpaid.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Richard Draper,</HI> who &s;erv'd in His Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI>
about 3 years, was, after he had been on Board about 22 Months ta|ken
&s;ick, and put on &s;hoar for his Recovery; and when recover'd, re|turn'd
on board the &s;ame Ship, where he continued about 12 Months,
and was then di&s;charg'd by order of the Admiralty, and had one Ticket
made out for his Service, from the la&s;t Entry, and another for the time
he &s;erv'd before he was &s;et &s;ick on &s;hoar: But at the Payment of the
&s;aid Ship, which was at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and (no other Ship paid there, at
that time) his Wages for the 22 Months before he was &s;et on &s;hoar
&s;ick, was refus'd to be paid, being accounted Query'd, notwith&s;tand|ing
the Ticket made out, and his returning aboard the &s;ame Ship, as
&s;oon as recover'd, yet the 12 Months Pay only could be receiv'd for
the la&s;t time; and that which was due for the 22 Months Service,
to the time he was &s;et on &s;hoar &s;ick, remains unpaid.</P>
<P>3. <HI>John Body</HI> &s;erv'd on board His Maje&s;ty's Ship <HI>Germoone Prize,</HI>
from the 7th day of <HI>October</HI> 1696, to the 15th day of <HI>January</HI> 1696,
at which time he was &s;et on &s;hoar &s;ick; and when recover'd, (being
in one Months time, or little more, from his di&s;charge,) returned on
board the &s;ame Ship again, and had a Ticket made out for his fir&s;t
Service; and in &s;ix Weeks after, or thereabouts, was &s;lain on Board
the &s;aid Ship; yet at the Payment of the Ship, at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> the
Wages to the time he was put on &s;hoar &s;ick, was refus'd to be paid,
being accounted Queried, and about 30 Shillings only that was due
for the latter Service was paid.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Stephen Forgen</HI> was &s;et on &s;hoar &s;ick from the <HI>Monmouth,</HI> at <HI>God|&s;port,</HI>
in, or about <HI>April</HI> 98, and the Ship being &s;ailed, and he con|tinuing
very ill, de&s;ired to be di&s;charg'd from Quarters, to go to <HI>Ip&s;|wich,</HI>
the Place of his Habitation; which having obtain'd, did get
<PB N="22" REF="25">
Pa&s;&s;age home, where he continued in a weak and deplorable Condi|tion,
as was amply certified by the Bayliffs, Mini&s;ter, and Church-Wardens
of the Place, and al&s;o that he had a Wife, and 5 &s;mall
Children relieved by the Alms of the Pari&s;h, yet his Query was re|fus'd
to be taken off; but on a &s;econd Certificate (to the &s;ame purpo&s;e)
and Application to the Navy Board, his Query is &s;ince taken off.</P>
<P>I might in&s;tance <HI>Simon Lewis,</HI> who was &s;et on &s;hoar &s;ick, &s;ince the
Peace concluded, and di&s;charged to go on board the &s;ame Ship, which
was &s;ailed for the <HI>Straights</HI> 10 days before his Di&s;charge, and all the
Ships in Harbour lying up at great Charge, had Orders to clear all the
Men that de&s;ired it, to ea&s;e His Maje&s;ty of the Charge, and not to
enter any Men; yet his Query is refus'd to be taken off, until he can
prove he endeavour'd to enter him&s;elf; but this Practice beng univer|&s;ally
known to tho&s;e concerned in the Navy, I &s;hall add no more:</P>
<P>But proceed to the R's, as another Ob&s;truction to the Seamen's
voluntary entring them&s;elves into the Service: Which R's, as be|fore
is &s;hew'd, denotes a Man to be Run from the Service; but
being a Letter of long Continuance, I &s;hall the more particularly
&s;hew wherein the &s;ame, as now practis'd, is a Hard&s;hip to the Seamen,
and all concerned with them, and an Ob&s;truction to their voluntarily
entering them&s;elves, and of great Prejudice to the Credit of the Na|vy:
yet many believing the Pre&s;ervation of the Naval Di&s;cipline, in
an e&s;pecial manner, depends thereon; I mu&s;t beg Pardon if I di&s;&s;ent
from them in this Particular (for the Rea&s;ons following:) And many
worthy Gentlemen with whom I have had the Honour to conver&s;e
are clearly or Opinion, <HI>That it is not evil Example, &s;evere Treat|ment,
cruel Puni&s;hment, and want of Pay, but &s;ober Command,
prudent Lenity, and rea&s;onable Encouragment, will mo&s;t conduce to
the maintaining of a good Di&s;cipline in the Navy.</HI></P>
<P>But as for the R's, tho&s;e that are mark'd with the &s;ame, in the Navy-Books,
by what Occa&s;ion or Accident &s;oever it happens, are now liable
to lo&s;e and forfeit all their Wages (how much, and for how many
Ships &s;oever it is due and unpaid) and altho Tickets are made out for the
&s;ame, and tho&s;e often &s;old, or transfer'd to others, long before they were
thus made run or forfeited: but indeed by an Act, made in the <HI>13th</HI> of
<HI>Charles</HI> the Second, <HI>Chap 12. Art.</HI> the 17th. were liable to be puni&s;h'd
with Death. The Words thus, <HI>viz.</HI> &startq;All Sea Captains and Officers,
or Mariners, that &s;hall de&s;ert the Service, or their Imployment in the
Ships, or &s;hall run away, or entice any others &s;o to do, &s;hall be pu|ni&s;h'd
with Death.&endq; Which Clau&s;e hath been put in Execution a|gain&s;t
divers who de&s;erted, during the late War, many being puni&s;h'd
with Death for the &s;ame; as <HI>Wilkin&s;on, Hall, Stone,</HI> and divers o|thers:
<PB N="23" REF="26">
But how far this deterred others from De&s;ertion, may
appear by the many thou&s;and R's that remain on the Navy-Books;
which, as was ob&s;erved, by the Admiralty and Navy-Boards, are &s;o
numerous, and the Sea-Books of the Navy &s;o voluminous, that no cer|tain
account thereof can be given; and indeed is not to be wondred at,
if we con&s;ider, not only the foregoing Circum&s;tances, with re&s;pect to
their ill Treatment, Puni&s;hment, Turning over from Ship to Ship, and
want of Pay, being put on Board Prizes, lent to help Merchant Ships
into Port, having leave to go on &s;hoar, being taken Sick, Impri&s;on'd,
Impre&s;t by other Ship's Companies (who always e&s;teem them good
Purcha&s;e when caught) the Ships &s;uddain Sailing, and many other Ac|cidents
of the like nature which occa&s;ions the &s;ame. But wherein the
pre&s;ent Practi&s;e of the&s;e R's differs from the former, and wherein the
Hard&s;hip of them lyes, I &s;hall endeavour to de&s;cribe, not only by tho&s;e
and other Cau&s;es of them, but al&s;o in the Difficulty of removing them.</P>
<P>That which occa&s;ions the va&s;t Numbers of R's now more than for|merly,
appears in a great degree from what is before mentioned,
and will be more clear, if we compare the late with the former
Di&s;cipline of the Navy. The former Practice, as is acknow|ledg'd,
was to pay off the great Ships every year, the &s;mall
ones at the end of every Voyage, and to leave no Recalls, &s;eldom
to turn Men over, and never to lend them to other Ships (except
Merchant-men, and to them only in ca&s;e of Di&s;tre&s;s;) to pay
Tickets as &s;oon as they were made out; and one Ship's Company not
to impre&s;s tho&s;e that belonged to other Ships, who were a-&s;hoar, ei|ther
by leave from the Officers, or on any other occa&s;ions; with other
Accidents too numerous here to in&s;ert. From every Particular where|of,
the Practice of the Navy, during the late War, as well as the
pre&s;ent Practice greatly differs, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>In that they have been kept 6 or 7 years unpaid, and the major
part of the Men left to Recalls. Their being turned over from one
Ship to a Second, from thence to a third, or fourth, in 3 or 4 Months
time, being di&s;charg'd from the Service, <HI>per</HI> Ticket, without their
Wages, and have been, accounted Runn in all the Ships they have &s;er|ved,
and their Tickets and Wages that remain'd unpaid, forfeited:
their having leave to be on &s;hoar, have been arre&s;ted, &s;urprized by
Sickne&s;s, or left by the Ships &s;udden and unexpected Sailing; im|pre&s;s'd
by other Ship's Companies, and many other Accidents as afore&s;aid;
which have brought &s;o many thou&s;ands under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, as the
Honourable the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy have acknowledg'd.</P>
<P>2dly. The Difficulty of taking off an R when once made; which,
although I cannot &s;ay, as one, who knew not the Seamen's Ca&s;e, did,
<PB N="24" REF="27">
<HI>That the</HI> R's <HI>are like the Laws of the</HI> Medes <HI>and</HI> Per&s;ians, <HI>unaltera|ble;</HI>
yet by the &s;trictne&s;s of the Navy-Board, with re&s;pect to Proof
and Circum&s;tance, which $hey require; the many Queries put be|fore
they remove them; and the &s;lender and nice Scruples whereon
they are refus'd, has coca&s;ion'd many hundred Per&s;ons (who expected,
and might rea&s;onably hope for Relief, in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, after tedious
Journies, and the Expence of their &s;mall Sub&s;tance in long Attendance)
to return to their Habitations more mi&s;erable than they came; it is
therefore no wonder the R's are numerous, and that &s;o few of them
are remov'd. A few In&s;tances may &s;erve for Information.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Richard Whitechurch,</HI> an able Seaman, belonged to His Maje&s;ty's
Ship the <HI>Expedition,</HI> from the 16th of <HI>June</HI> 93, to the fir&s;t of <HI>Febru|ary</HI>
96, being 40 Months, and 2 days: The Neat-Wages due to him
be&s;ides Short Allowance-Money is 39 <HI>l. 16 s. 6 d.</HI> but his Ticket be|ing
lo&s;t by Accident, the Navy-Board granted another, about twenty
Months after his Di&s;charge from the &s;aid Ship: But at the Payment
of the <HI>Expedition,</HI> in <HI>December</HI> 98, his Wages was refus'd, it being
&s;aid he run from the <HI>Sunderland</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> But as I am in|form'd
was accidently left on a French I&s;land.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John Carpenter</HI> and <HI>Richard Jane,</HI> both able Seamen, &s;erved on
board His Maje&s;ty's Ship the <HI>Royal Oak,</HI> from the 14th of <HI>January</HI>
1692, to the 3d of <HI>April</HI> 1697; and the <HI>Oak</HI> being then laid up at
<HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> in order to be paid; they were di&s;charged by Tickets, and
put on board the <HI>Rainbow Prize,</HI> which was bound to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and
that Ship putting into <HI>Falmouth;</HI> the Captain gave the &s;aid <HI>Carpenter</HI>
and <HI>Jane,</HI> leave to vi&s;it their Friends, who lived near <HI>Pad&s;tow;</HI> they
having been long ab&s;ent from them; but the Ship &s;ailing &s;uddenly,
they were left behind, and therefore made Run; which is certified by the
Captain of the <HI>Rainbow Prize.</HI> And further, That he had a good Cha|racter
of them, from their former Commander, and did believe they had
no de&s;ign to de&s;ert the Service; yet their R's are refus'd to be taken
off, and the Per&s;ons required to appear them&s;elves; and in ca&s;e they
&s;hould comply with the &s;aid Orders, it is very probable, having no bet|ter
Rea&s;ons to offer for the taking off their R's, than what have
already been offered, in their Behalfs, they will be obliged to return
with the like An&s;wer, as many Hundreds have done, <HI>that they cannot
be relieved.</HI></P>
<P>3. The Company of the <HI>Coronation</HI> (hired Ship) which came from
the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> were generally ordered on board the <HI>Re&s;erve</HI> (as I
remember) to return to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> again; but by rea&s;on of the Hard|&s;hip
of the Voyage, and as they alledg'd, the unkindne&s;s of the Comman|der,
were unwilling to go, but went in general on Board others of His
<PB N="25" REF="28">
Maje&s;ty's Ships, for which they were all made Run, and not tho&s;e
only, but &s;everal whom the Captain had di&s;charged by Ticket, and were
gone before the &s;aid Order; &s;ome of which Tickets were afterwards
paid to the Relations, or pretended ones, but others under the &s;ame
Circum&s;tances refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>4. <HI>John Searle,</HI> who was Boat&s;wain's-Mate, of His Maje&s;ty's Ship
the <HI>England Frigot,</HI> when &s;unk in a Fight With the Freneh, was noted
to be run to the French Service, and his Wages for that rea&s;on refu&s;ed
to be paid; but &s;oon after returned to <HI>England,</HI> and petitioned the Na|vy-Board
to be relieved; He was an&s;wered with a Query; <HI>how, and
by whom he was noted to be R.</HI> Which Query being impo&s;&s;ible for him
to an&s;wer, his R cou'd not be taken off. Many hundred In&s;tances of
&s;uch Natures might be given; but hope the&s;e will &s;uffice. And
I &s;hall now briefly touch on &s;ome of the Inconveniencies that have
attended the making Tickets Run.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> This Practice, has not only greatly reduced the Credit of the
Navy, but al&s;o &s;eems apparently contrary to the former Di&s;cipline
thereof, and I humbly conceive, is de&s;tructive to the very end and
intent of granting them. That the Credit of the Navy is hereby re|duced,
is manife&s;t, in that when Tickets (as formerly they) were
e&s;teemed, and punctually paid as the Kings Bonds, of Bills of Ex|change,
within few days after produced to the Comptroler, and Pay ma&s;ter
of the Navy: Certain Sums being appointed weekly for that
purpo&s;e. The Bankers in <HI>Lombard &s;treet</HI> have di&s;counted them (as I
have been informed) at <HI>6d. per</HI> Pound Lo&s;s, a great Di&s;proportion to
10 or 12 <HI>s.</HI> at which di&s;count they have lately been: And if Wages
be demanded at this time, where Tickets are made out, and the Tic|kets
not produced, the Comptroler of the Pay frequently an&s;wers,
<HI>that the Money cannot be paid, becau&s;e the King's Bonds are out &s;tand|ing,</HI>
(meaning the Tickets.)</P>
<P>And that this is de&s;tructive to the end of granting Tickets,
appears by the Captains In&s;tructions given them, even to this
time, for making them out, (<HI>viz.) Article</HI> 18 of the New In&s;trucs|ctions,
and 15 of the Old.</P>
<P>Thus; &startq;You are to be very careful, not to di&s;charge Men by
Ticket unnece&s;&s;arily: The intent of that Practice, being principally
for &s;ick Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq; And <HI>Article</HI> 24 New, and 18 Old; &startq;You are
not to &s;ign any Ticket upon di&s;charge of any of your Men, but
&s;uch as &s;hall be printed Tickets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor that upon any pretence
what&s;oever any Ticket be made out, before the Per&s;on for whom
the &s;ame is made, be actually di&s;charg'd, and the &s;aid Per&s;on, or
&s;ome other, lawfully impower'd to demand the &s;ame.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="29">
If therefore Tickets were principally de&s;igned for &s;ick Men, and
tho&s;e (until the Order afore&s;aid) were ever accounted for that rea&s;on
to be di&s;charged from the Service, and no Ticket to be made out for
any Per&s;on until actually di&s;charged; and when they were made out,
&s;uch Per&s;on, or any other lawfully impower'd by him, might demand
the &s;ame; and that &s;uch Tickets were formerly paid immediately af|ter
produced, to the Comptroler and Pay-ma&s;ter of the Navy, as
afore&s;aid; it &s;eems as great a My&s;tery, as unrea&s;onable, that they
can, or &s;hou'd be Forfeited, or made Run for future De&s;ertion. I &s;hall
only add to what is afore&s;aid, as further Motives to take off the Q's
and R's, as far as the &s;ame appear to be Hard&s;hips, the Rea&s;ons for|merly
given for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, To take off the Q's; 'Tis the Labourers Hire, and their Fami|lies
Bread, and their Poverty, Indigency, and Mi&s;ery pleads for Relief.</P>
<P>2. That tho&s;e Q's are of late Invention (<HI>viz.</HI>) in the Year 1690,
and occa&s;ion'd by the great Sickne&s;s and Mortality that then reigned
in the Fleet, which &s;hould rather be a motive to take them off.</P>
<P>3. Many of the Per&s;ons at fir&s;t put on &s;hoar were ignorant of tho&s;e
new Rules, and therefore did not return, and others have been &s;et on
&s;hoar &s;everal times, thereby creating great charge, and tending to the
prejudice of the Service, but was of no advantage to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>4. Many contracted their Sickne&s;s in foreign Voyages, and conti|nued
long &s;ick on board, before they could be &s;et on &s;hoar, and many
of their Con&s;orts were buried; they have therefore dreaded to return,
when a little recovered, for fear of a Relap&s;e.</P>
<P>5. Many have been &s;et on &s;hoar in a very deplorable Condition;
&s;ome whereof, as I have been credibly informed, died in the Streets;
others, immediately after they came into &s;ick Quarters; &s;ome have
been Impre&s;t, and hurried on Board other Ships before half recovered;
and mo&s;t of them rendered incapable to return on Board their proper
Ships, by rea&s;on of the Ships &s;ailing before they recover'd, as well as
for want of Conduct-Money, to &s;upport them to the places where di|rected;
for which rea&s;on they have been obliged to expend great part
of their Wages, and &s;ell their Cloaths for Sub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>6. That it was not likely tho&s;e who&s;e Sickne&s;s was &s;o great, as to
engage their Officers to put them on &s;hoar, could be &s;o well recovered
in &s;trength, e&s;pecially to return on board in &s;o &s;hort a time as required.</P>
<P>7. That the &s;aid Wages was with Difficulty, and hard Labour duly
earned; that the Charge, Expence, and Fatigue to the Petitioners, and
Trouble to the Offices, and both Hou&s;es of Parliament, have been very
great: To the fir&s;t, by the extravagant Exactions of tho&s;e that preten|ded
to &s;ollicite their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and by their long Attendance: To the
other, by the Clamourous Tumults of Petitioners.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="30">
8. They having faithfully &s;erved His Maje&s;ty to the impairing of
their Healths, and hazard of their Lives, and the Nation having pro|vided
&s;utable Funds for the Payment of their Wages, it &s;eems not
only ju&s;t and reasonable, but al&s;o for the Honour of His Maje&s;ty, and
Credit of his Service, to take off tho&s;e Q's, and pay the Wages &s;o
hardly earned. To which I &s;hall only add one Query made by a Noble
Lord who was pre&s;ent when this matter was under con&s;ideration of the
Admirality and Navy-Boards <HI>viz. By what Law &s;uch Wages was
&s;topt</HI> (a Que&s;tion I believ'd) not proper for me to ask, nor do I
remember it was then an&s;wered.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall proceed, and hint &s;ome few of many Rea&s;ons or Mo|tives
that might be given, for taking off the R's, as followeth, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>1. That &s;uch as have Tickets delivered them, &s;eems, in the Eye of
Ju&s;tice, to have a good Title to their Wages.</P>
<P>2. Tho&s;e Tickets are, and have been e&s;teemed, as the Kings Bonds
or Bills of Exchange, and were formerly paid at &s;ight, or &s;oon after
produced.</P>
<P>3. Many well affected People, for promoting His Maje&s;ty's Ser|vice,
and in Charity to their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Neighbonrs, have &s;upplied
them to the value of their Tickets.</P>
<P>4. The making &s;uch Tickets Run, has un&s;peakably reduced the Cre|dit
of the Navy, with re&s;pect to Wages; in&s;omuch, that Tickets
which were formerly di&s;counted, as afore&s;aid, at 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Pound, and
few Years &s;ince, at 2 <HI>s.</HI> and 2 <HI>s. 6 d. per</HI> Pound, have of late been
&s;old for le&s;s than one half of their Value.</P>
<P>5. That &s;uch Tickets, had not Money been wanting, would have
been paid long before they became forfeited.</P>
<P>6. The Tickets and Wages due by them, has been a&s;&s;igned to others
long before &s;uch Forfeiture, which I conceive, inve&s;ts the A&s;&s;ignee
with an equitable Right (at lea&s;t) to the Money.</P>
<P>7. It is to be feared, the&s;e Hard&s;hips has cau&s;ed many Seamen to
de&s;ert the Nation, and either turn Pyrats, or &s;erve Foreigners.</P>
<P>Indeed the main Objection again&s;t taking off the&s;e R's &s;till remains,
that is, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trickne&s;s (I may &s;ay Severity) of the
Q's and R's, many hundreds do de&s;ert the Service, and were it not for
forfeiting their Wages, (as the Admirality and Navy-Boards have ob|&s;erved)
but few, except Officers, would remain therein. I mu&s;t confe&s;s
this is in &s;ome mea&s;ure true; but if we con&s;ider the occa&s;ion thereof,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the Hard&s;hips aforementioned, I may &s;ay with A&s;&s;urance (accord|ing
to the true Maxim) <HI>Take away the Cau&s;e, and the Effect will cea&s;e:</HI>
For in ca&s;e the Seamen are kindly treated, duly encouraged, well and
frequently paid, as afore-hinted, and have &s;ometimes Liberty to vi&s;it
<PB N="28" REF="31">
their Relations and Families, His Maje&s;ty's Service will no longer be
accounted a Slavi&s;h Confinement, but as a plea&s;ant and profitable Cal|ling,
to which the Seamen will apply them&s;elves with chearfulne&s;s,
for the Support of their Families; mo&s;t of whom, by rea&s;on of
the many Grievances afore&s;aid, during the late War, were relieved by
the Charity of others.</P>
<P>Indeed it has been remarked by a Gentleman, (&s;uppo&s;ed to relate
to the Admiralty,) in a &s;mall Treatie, Entituled, <HI>Remarks on a Pam|phlet
touching the Navy and Victualling</HI> &amp;c. as a Matter of great Le|nity,
That in 6 Months time, that Honourable Board relieved 750 of
1700 Per&s;ons who petitioned; of which 750, as I am informed,
above 500 were relieved from Q's only, and not R's; and mo&s;t of
tho&s;e were &s;uch, who&s;e Circum&s;tances were within the Limits of the
following Order (<HI>viz.</HI>) tho&s;e who either died in &s;ick Quarters, or the
Ho&s;pitals, or returned on Board their proper Ships within one Month
after Recovery, or to &s;ome other of His Maje&s;ty's Ships, if their own
were not in the way, or were di&s;charged by Ticket unfit for Service.
Now I humbly conceive, there being no real Occa&s;ion to put any
Queries on them, it appearing where they were at the &s;ame time; it
had &s;avoured more of Ju&s;tice than Kindne&s;s, not to have given them
the Trouble, Charge, and Fatigue of Petitioning, and attending from
Office to Office, until the greate&s;t part of the Wages due, has been
expended, before they could be relieved, or tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Queries
taken off; as may appear, not only by the Ca&s;es of <HI>John Wilkin&s;on</HI>
and <HI>Richard Draper, &amp;c.</HI> but al&s;o by the Right Honourable the Lords
of the Admiralties Order to the Navy-Board, in an&s;wer to my Ad|dre&s;s
in <HI>February</HI> 169$-99, which Order I &s;hall not incert, but only
take notice of the Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e intended by the &s;aid Order
to be reliev'd, as far as I can remember, in their Lord&s;hips Terms.</P>
<P>1. &startq;You &s;hall take off the Q's and R's from all Men that have

thence to the Ho&s;pital, have died there; as al&s;o tho&s;e as have been
put &s;ick on Board Ho&s;pital-Ships, and died there.&endq;</P>
<P>2. &startq;From all Men &s;et &s;ick on &s;hoar &s;ince the Peace, from Ships
under Orders to be paid off, and laid up, and could not be re-enter'd
on Board the &s;aid Ships,&endq; after their Di&s;charge from &s;ick
Quarters, or the Ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>3. &startq;From all Men that have been &s;et on &s;hoar &s;ick, and di&s;charged
either from &s;ick Quarters, or the Ho&s;pitals, unfit for His Maje&s;|ty's
Service.&endq;</P>
<P>4. &startq;From all Men that have been &s;et &s;ick on &s;hoar, and after the
Expiration of their Month, or within 20 days after, were willing to
<PB N="29" REF="32">
return to the Ships to which they belong'd, or to &s;ome other of His
Maje&s;ty's Ships, if their proper Ships were not in the way.&endq;</P>
<P>5. &startq;And from all Men di&s;charged by Tickets without any demur
in them.&endq;</P>
<P>Before which Order, the Wages of all Per&s;ons under the afore&s;aid
Circum&s;tances were denied, until by Petition an Order cou'd be
obtained for removing of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Q's and R's.</P>
<P>Now if all Men that did die in &s;ick Quarters, or the Ho&s;pitals, or
Ho&s;pital-Ships, or were &s;et &s;ick on &s;hoar from &s;uch Ships as were or|der'd
to be paid off, and could not re-enter them (but on the contrary,
had Orders to di&s;charge as many as de&s;ired it;) And if they that were
di&s;charged from the Ho&s;pitals, or &s;ick Quarters, unfit for Service, or by
their Officers, by Tickets for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, or if they returned to
their proper Ships, or &s;ome other of His Maje&s;ty's Ships, if their pro|per
Ships were not in the way: If all the&s;e &s;hould bs as they then
were &s;uppo&s;ed to be Queried; And if tho&s;e Queries were not an&s;wered
by the proper Officers, which is their Duty, but ever was, and I fear
&s;till is wholly neglected. And had not that Order been obtained, the
1700 Complainants would &s;oon have encrea&s;ed to 17000, and the
Clamours and Tumults of the Oppre&s;&s;ed Petirioners been intolerable.
This I hope may &s;uffice to evidence the Hard&s;hips and Inconveniencies
of the Queries.</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid Author al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ts, in the &s;aid Treati&s;e, That many
Embeli&s;hments have been added to the Navy, &s;ince the beginning of

the frequent turning Men over from a fir&s;t, to a &s;econd, third, or fourth
Ship, in few Months (by which &s;ome that have been Ma&s;ter's-Mates,
as well as other Officers on Board &s;uch Ships as they were turned out
of, have been reduced to the meane&s;t Stations, or Fore-ma&s;t Men's
Wages on Board others) nor lending them to other Ships, bearing
them by Lift two or three Months, or more, and allowing them no
Wages for their Service, le&s;&s;ening their Pay, depriving them of their
Prize-Money, keeping them &s;even, eight, or nine Years without their
Wages, preferring ignorant Favourites to Offices, and Employments
of Profit, before ingenious Seamen, to whom the &s;ame have been pro|mi&s;ed,
and who at the &s;ame time are obliged to do the others Duty,
in the &s;aid Employments, tho they receive the Wages; nor the cruel
Whipping and Pickling of the Seamen, putting &s;uch Q's on them as

<PB N="30" REF="33">
Right.) If the&s;e are the Imbelli&s;hments intended, I conceive it's
tho&s;e, and only tho&s;e, that have given &s;uch great Di&s;gu&s;t to our Sea|men,
and prevented their Voluntary Entring into the Service; the
which as it has been in times pa&s;t, (unle&s;s it be prevented,) is like
to continue a Hard&s;hip to the Seamen, and a Burthen to the Nation,
and the only Occa&s;ion of putting the Government to that inconvenient,
delatory, trouble&s;ome, and chargeable Method of Impre&s;&s;ing. Some
of the Inconveniences and Di&s;advantages that attend the &s;ame, I &s;hall
briefly hint (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing the Inconveniencies and Di&s;advantages of Impre&s;&s;ing.</HEAD>
<P>1. THE Charge; and that con&s;i&s;ts partly in the Freight, Wages,
and Provisions of the Ve&s;&s;els that are hired to Impre&s;s, and
their Companies, which is computed by the Honoured Commi&s;&s;ioner
<HI>Geo.</HI> St. <HI>Loe,</HI> at 60000 Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> Fol. (38) of his Book,
Entituled, <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Safety, or a Bridle for the French King.</HI></P>
<P>2. The Charge of the Pre&s;s-Gangs which are generally compo&s;ed
of &s;everal Officers, and 14 or 16 of the be&s;t Men, who&s;e Wages and
Provi&s;ions, I conceive, cannot rea&s;onably be e&s;teemed le&s;s than the
Charge of the Impre&s;s-Ve&s;&s;els; the&s;e being more than double their
Number, and for that Rea&s;on exceed their Charge, the Freight in|cluded.</P>
<P>3. The Wages and Provi&s;ions of the Volunteers and Impre&s;t Men,
who are generally 2 or 3 Months, and oftentimes more from &s;ome pla|ces
in Victuals and Pay (and many in that time de&s;ert) before they
come to the Ships, for which they are entered, which is al&s;o a great
Charge to the Nation; and as &s;ome have ob&s;erved and calculated, it
has &s;ometimes co&s;t the Government 8 or 10 <HI>l.</HI> a Man, for tho&s;e that
have been impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>4. Another Inconveniency and Charge that attends this Method, is
the Ab&s;ence of &s;o many of the Officers and able&s;t Seamen &s;everal
Months, the Equipment, and fitting the Ships for the Sea, being
retarded thereby, and many of the Ships not fully Mann'd until <HI>May</HI>
or <HI>June</HI> (and &s;ometimes not the whole Summer) which in the late
War gave the Enemy the Advantage of having their Fleet at Sea be|fore
ours; and to prevent the &s;ame, our Great Ships have &s;ome|times
been kept in Pay the whole Winter, and generally commi&s;&s;ion|ed
and ordered to enter Men in <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> The Extra|ordinary
<PB N="31" REF="34">
Charge whereof, I conceive, cannot be le&s;s to the Govern|ment
than 300000 Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI> For Example, Suppo&s;e the
Charge of the Navy for one year, allowing 40000 Men to be &s;ufficient
for that Service, is 2118500 Pounds, according to the E&s;timate given
the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, for the Year 1697, at 4 <HI>l. 5 s.
per</HI> Man, <HI>per</HI> Month, for 13 Months; Now if 13 fir&s;t and &s;econd Rate
Ships, having 8500 Men, and 27 third Rates, having 12150 Men,
and 30 fourth Rates, having 5700 Men; being in the whole 26000
Men, as may be computed by the Li&s;t, Page the 3 <HI>d.</HI> be&s;ides Fir-Ships,
Tenders, Bomb-Ve&s;&s;els <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If tho&s;e Ships were paid off in <HI>October,</HI>
and the Men not kept in Pay, (as they &s;ometimes have been the
whole Winter,) the Charge for 3 Months only &s;ecured, <HI>viz.</HI> from the
1&s;t of <HI>November</HI> to the 1&s;t of <HI>February,</HI> the afore&s;aid allowance for
&s;o many Men for that time being more then 301500 Pounds, (but
computed by Commi&s;&s;ioner St. <HI>Loe,</HI> at more than 500000 <HI>l.</HI>) might
be &s;aved to the Nation on that Account, the Ware and Tare as well
as the Wages and Provi&s;ions being al&s;o &s;aved, and the Officers and
their Servants that continue on Board, not being included in the &s;aid
Number: And there would remain as a Winter-Guard, and for foreign
Service 14000 Men, which would compleatly Man twelve Third,
twenty Fourth, twenty Fifth, and twenty Sixth Rate Ships; (as by
the E&s;timate of their Complement in the Table, <HI>page</HI> 3,) or &s;uch
Number of each Rate, as the Government might &s;ee occa&s;ion to di&s;|po&s;e
them. But my de&s;ign being not to magnify the Di&s;advantages
that will attend the pre&s;ent Di&s;cipline of the Navy, nor the Advant|ages
that I hope will accrue by the Alteration of the &s;ame: Shall
&s;uppo&s;e that only 250000 Pounds of the &s;aid Sum be &s;aved; this added
to the Charge of Impre&s;&s;ing, and Bounty-Money, given to Volunteers
for entring, with Impre&s;s-Money allowed the Captains, according to
the Rates of their Ships, for their Expence, and with the Victuals and
Wages to Pre&s;s-Gangs, whil&s;t ab&s;ent from the Ships, &s;uppo&s;ing it only
50000 Pounds; it will be at lea&s;t 300000 Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> which
may with ea&s;e be &s;aved, and the Subjects freed from many other In|conveniencies
that attended the late Manner of Impre&s;&s;ing. But to
proceed.</P>
<P>5. Another Inconveniency, is the frequent Riots, Tumults, and
Quarrels, that happened as well among&s;t the Pre&s;s-Gangs (in Cut|ting,
Hewing, and Knocking down each other)&punc; as with the Water-men,
Barge-men, Citizens, and others, whereby the King's Peace has
frequently been broken, and &s;everal Pre&s;s-Gangs, with their Officers,
taken into Cu&s;tody for the &s;ame, and bound over to the Se&s;&s;ions, and
&s;ometimes Murthers committed (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Cooper at <HI>Bayly</HI>'s Place,
<PB N="32" REF="35">
and as I have heard, &s;everal Barge-men above Bridge drowned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
to the Scandal and Prejudice of His Maje&s;ty's Service, and the great
Di&s;couragement of many faithful Subjects, who would other wi&s;e
have entered them&s;elves on Board the Ships of War.</P>
<P>6. By this Method many poor Trade&s;men have been impre&s;&s;ed, and
their Servants al&s;o violently taken from them to their utter ruin, and
have been driven from their Families like Dogs, or the wor&s;t of Cri|minals,
without Apparel to &s;hift them; and when brought on Board,
by rea&s;on of their Ignorance, Di&s;content, Sloth, and want of Apparel,
became di&s;eas'd and noy&s;om, and was in all probability, one principal
Occa&s;ion of the Sickne&s;s in the Navy; many of whom after 2 or 3
Months Sickne&s;s on Board, have been &s;et on &s;hoar &s;everal times, and
maintained at His Maje&s;ty's Charge, and others run away; and tho&s;e
that remained were of little u&s;e, &s;ave only to eat the Kings Provi&s;ion,
and add to the Nation's Charge. So that the great Charge the Go|vernment
has been at for Impre&s;&s;ing on Shoar, has been of little other
Advantage, than giving Opportunity to &s;ome needy Pre&s;s-Ma&s;ters, to
take Monies For protecting tho&s;e who were mo&s;t capable to &s;erve, and
clearing others whom they had no Authority to Impre&s;s; and to &s;ave
their Credit, and get the 20 <HI>s. per</HI> Man, lately given, have &s;ent &s;ome
on Board, who being &s;uch as aforementioned, were in no wi&s;e $it for
the Service; divers of whom, when carried on Board, have been
turned on &s;hoar again, many Miles from their Habitations, with$$t
any Con&s;ideration for the Lo&s;s of their Time, or Monies to carry th$$
back to their Families.</P>
<P>7. Be&s;ides the&s;e Di&s;advantages that immediately concern the Go|vernment&punc;
by this Method of Impre&s;&s;ing, the Prejudice is very great
to Trade in general, but e&s;pecially to this City of <HI>London,</HI> and the
Sea-Ports where the Ships of War are laid up. A brief In&s;tance
whereof may &s;erve for Information, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>February</HI> 1700-01, Coals were in this City at 22 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI> or 23 <HI>s. per</HI>
Chaldorn, and Men's Wages to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> at 30 <HI>s. per</HI> Voyage; but
by rea&s;on of the Pre&s;s in <HI>March</HI> following, Coals were rai&s;ed to 37 <HI>s.</HI>
and 38 <HI>s. per</HI> Chaldron, and Men's Wages to 4 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI> or 5 <HI>l. per</HI>
Voyage; and as &s;oon as the &s;aid Pre&s;s was over (<HI>viz.</HI>) in <HI>May,</HI>
Coals were reduced to 21 <HI>s.</HI> or 22 <HI>s. per</HI> Chaldorn, and Men's Wages
proportionable. Now &s;uppo&s;ing only 16000 Chaldorn of Coals to
be brought to <HI>London,</HI> between <HI>February</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> altho I am in|formed
there was much more imported, the Lo&s;s to this City in that
quantity at 15 <HI>s. per</HI> Chaldorn, the difference of the Price is 12000
Pounds, and yet neither the Ma&s;ters, nor the Owners of the Ships,
u&s;ing the Coal-Trade, had any Advantage thereby, mo&s;t of them being
<PB N="33" REF="36">
great Lo&s;ers; and many of them lo&s;t their whole Stock, or Ships
Loading: and divers formerly as well Coal Ships, as Merchant men,
being di&s;abled by Impre&s;&s;ing their Men, have been in great hazard,
and at great Charge to &s;ecure them, and &s;ome were intirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;ed not to mention any Particular Irregularity of Impre&s;|&s;ing,
but being importun'd by &s;ome worthy Merchants of this City,
and Ma&s;ters of Ships in the Coal-Trade; I &s;hall briefly relate the
Matter of Fact without mentioning the Per&s;ons concerned in it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
It was the Practice of &s;ome Lieutenants or Officers that were employed
to Impre&s;s in the late Expedition, (altho in the time of Peace) to take
the Boys out of the Colliers, or Coal Ships, and whip them &s;everely,
threaten to <HI>drown</HI> (and otherwi&s;e evilly treat) them, to extort a Con|fe&s;&s;ion
of the Men &s;uppo&s;ed to be hid on board, and in Ships where the
Men have been impre&s;&s;ed before, the Puni&s;hment was the greater: the
Officers &s;till expecting &s;ome Confe&s;&s;ion; of which Practice, divers Ma|&s;ters
complained to the Lords of the Admiralty, and were directed by
their Lord&s;hips to make Oath of the Fact, which they accordingly did:
the I&s;&s;ue I know not, only the Gentlemen concerned, fearing the like
Practice might be continued, and re&s;enting it as a Breach and a high
Violation of the true Liberties of the Subjects of this Realm, de&s;ired
it might be publi&s;hed to prevent for the future, the Inconveniencies
that might attend the &s;ame; but as well this as divers of the forego|ing
Grievances, being beyond my purpo&s;e, and I fear too burthen|&s;ome
to the Reader, and plea&s;ing to the Enemies of the pre&s;ent Go|vernment.
I &s;hall cea&s;e the Complaint, and humbly propo&s;e an
E&s;&s;ay for Redre&s;s.</P>

<P>FOra&s;much as the Strength of the Royal Navy doth not con&s;i&s;t
in the Number of Ships only, it is undoubtedly nece&s;&s;ary to
have at all Commands, a &s;ufficient Number of able Seamen

<PB N="34" REF="37">
them to enter, and continue in the Service, is the Judgment of our
mo&s;t gracious Soveraign, and both Hou&s;es of Parliament; evidenced
by the great Care, both of His Maje&s;ty, and late Gracious and Royal
Con&s;ort of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory, to Contribute thereto in a Noble and
Charitable manner; as appears by the perfecting their Pious Intenti|ons,
in Devoting and Dedicating in mo&s;t affectionate and pathetical
Expre&s;&s;ions, their magnificent and &s;pacious Palace at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> for
a Harbour of Repo&s;e to &s;uch Mariners, as by the Hazards of the
Wars, and Fatigues of the Seas in Their Maje&s;ty's Service for the Na|tions
Defence, &s;hould be maimed, or become impotent and nece&s;&s;itous,
and al&s;o to be a Succour to their Families, that they might not labour
under any Hard&s;hips. His Maje&s;ty's Expre&s;&s;ions being &s;o much to the
Seamen's Honour and demon&s;trating &s;uch Affection towards them, I
believe it not ami&s;s to in&s;ert the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>&startq; Whereas we are extreamly de&s;irous, that the Trade, <HI>Navigation,</HI>
and Naval Strength of this our Realm of <HI>England,</HI> whereupon its
Safety and flouri&s;hing State does &s;o much depend, &s;hould by all
proper Means be promoted and advanced; and whereas we are per|&s;waded,
that nothing will more effectually contribute thereto, than
the endeavouring by due and fitting Encouragement, to encrea&s;e the
Number of Engli&s;h Seamen, as well for the &s;trengthning of our
Navy Royal, and better performing the Naval Service of Us Our
Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, as for the &s;upplying and carrying on the Oc|ca&s;ions
and Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Merchants, and other our loving Sub|jects,
intere&s;ted in Trade, Commerce, Fi&s;hing, Plantation, Di&s;co|very,
and other Affairs relating to Navigation. And whereas the
Sea-fairing Men of this Kingdom, have for a long time di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves throughout the World by their Indu&s;try and Skillfulne&s;s
in their proper Imployments; and by their Courage and Con&s;tancy,
manife&s;ted in Engagements and Hazards for the Defence and Ho|nour
of their Native Country, and nothing is more likely to con|tinue
this their Antient Reputation, and to invite greater Numbers
of our Subjects to betake them&s;elves to the Sea, than by making
&s;ome Competent Provi&s;ion that Seamen, who by Age, Wounds, and
other Accidents, &s;hall become di&s;abled for further Service at Sea,
and &s;hall not be in a Condition to maintain them&s;elves comfortably,
may not fall under Hard&s;hips, and Mi&s;eries, but may be &s;upported at
the Publick Charge; and that the Children of &s;uch di&s;abled Sea|men,
and al&s;o the Widows and Children of &s;uch Seamen as &s;hall
happen to be &s;lain in the Sea-Service, may in &s;ome rea&s;onable man|ner
be provided for, and educated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereas having frequently
<PB N="35" REF="38">
reflected upon the Premi&s;es &s;ince our Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, we
have determined with Our Selves, to Erect and E&s;tabli&s;h Our Ho&s;|pital
for the Purpo&s;e afore&s;aid; and although by Rea&s;on of the Ex|pen&s;ive
War in which We have been, and are at pre&s;ent engaged;
We have not been able to carry on the &s;aid Good and Pious Purpo&s;es
to &s;uch Effect as We have de&s;ired, yet in order to begin to put the
&s;ame in Execution, We, and our late mo&s;t dear Con&s;ort the Queen,
did by Our Letters Pattent under Our Great Seal of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>And how far the States of the Nation, <HI>viz.</HI> King, Lords, and Com|mons
in Parliament A&s;&s;embled, were affected with the State of the
Navy, and what Care was by them taken, and Provi&s;ion made for the
Encrea&s;e and Encouragement of Seamen, is very evident by the Acts
for Regi&s;tring of them. The Rea&s;ons (by way of Preamble) as
Grounds, and Motives for the &s;aid Acts, are as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;Fora&s;much as the Strength and Safety of His Maje&s;ty's Domini|ons
do much depend on the &s;upplying His Royal Navy, with a
Competent Number of able Seamen, which may be ready at all
times for that Service.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To invite great Numbers of His Maje&s;ty's Subjects to betake
them&s;elves to Sea; it is fit &s;ome Provi&s;ion &s;hould be made, that
Seamen, who by Age, Wounds, and other Accidents, &s;hould be|come
di&s;abled for future Service at Sea, and &s;hall not be in a Con|dition
to maintain them&s;elves comfortably, may not fall under Hard|&s;hips
and Mi&s;ery, but may be &s;upported at the Publick Charge, and
that the Children of &s;uch di&s;abled Seamen; and al&s;o the Widows
and Children of &s;uch Seamen who &s;hall be &s;lain or drowned in Sea-&s;ervice,
may in &s;ome rea&s;onable manner be provided for: His Maje&s;|ty,

Erected and Endowed for the Purpo&s;es afore&s;aid, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>By this it appears as afore&s;aid, to be the Judgment of His Maje&s;ty,
and the Great Council of the Nation, that Encouragement is the only
Inducement to engage the Seamen to the Service; ($augre the Opini|on
of tho&s;e that would introduce Hard&s;hips and Puni&s;hments in its

had the de&s;ired Succe&s;s, and humbly &s;hew that the perfecting the &s;ame
<PB N="36" REF="39">
which is my pre&s;ent Aim) will effectually an&s;wer the Ends propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>And 1 <HI>&s;t.</HI> I &s;hall Con&s;ider the Immunities and Priviledges, <HI>viz.</HI> It
is provided, by the Acts, that every Regi&s;tred Per&s;on whether Land|men
or Seamen, to the number of 30000, Commi&s;&s;ion and Warrant-Officers
excluded, &s;hall have 40 <HI>Shill. per Annum,</HI> both at Sea and
on Shore, as well in times of Peace as War; whether in His Maje&s;ty's
or Merchants Service! That they &s;hall have two Months Pay in every
&s;ix Months, whil&s;t on foreign Voyages, paid to their Relations, for
their Support in their Ab&s;ence! That they &s;hall have a double Share
of Prizes! That in ca&s;e of their Death whil&s;t on foreign Voyages,
their Executors or Admini&s;trators, &s;hall receive their Wages without
waiting for the Return or Payment of the Ships! That &s;uch only &s;hall
be perferred to Commi&s;&s;ion, Warrant, and Petty-Offices in His Maje&s;ty's
Navy! That they &s;hall be exempt and free from all Parochial. and
Peace-Offices, or being A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors or Collectors of Taxes, and from &s;erving
on Juries and Inque&s;ts, or as Soldiers in the <HI>Militia;</HI> with other En|couragements.
(Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Priviledges (which en|gaged
many Per&s;ons who never de&s;igned to enter into, neither are
proper for the Service at Sea, to Regi&s;ter them&s;elves) yet (as I am
credibly informed) there are not 20000 Regi&s;tred, Officers included,
which is far &s;hort of the Expectation of that Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly; They
having provided for the fir&s;t 30000, excluding Officers; and that the
Number of the Regi&s;tred Seamen exempting Officers; &s;hould
at no time exceed 30000 expecting that the Generality of Sea|men
in <HI>England</HI> would be very free to Regi&s;ter them&s;elves, con&s;idering
the afore&s;aid Immunities and Advantages granted them by the &s;aid
Acts. And that a far greater Number were expected to Regi&s;ter than
what are, will further appear by the unparallel'd Charitable Donation
of the &s;aid Royal Famous Fabrick, the &s;pacious <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> of <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
and the ample Provi&s;ion made by the &s;aid Acts, to &s;upport the &s;ame;

receive into, and &s;uccour in, and by it, all the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Seamen of
the Nation (and their Families) that have a Right thereto, by Virtue
of the &s;aid Acts; but more of this in its proper place: And &s;hall at
pre&s;ent con&s;ider &s;ome of the probable Cau&s;es, or Rea&s;ons, why the &s;aid
Acts have not had the de&s;ired Effect; the mo&s;t Principal ones, I fear,
are fir&s;t, the Seamens Treatment in the Particulars before mentioned at
large, which &s;hall not repeat.</P>

&s;aid fir&s;t Ships.</P>
<P><HI>4thly.</HI> All tho&s;e th$t die in Voyages to <HI>Holland, France,</HI> the <HI>Narrow
Seas, &amp;c.</HI> are denied the Benefit of the Acts, &s;uch Voyages being not
accounted foreign Voyages.</P>
<P><HI>5thly.</HI> The Friends and Relations of all Commi&s;&s;ion and Warrant-Officers
that die on foreign Voyages, &s;o accounted, are denied their
Wages till the Payment of the Ships; it being alledged they are not
to have the $e$efits of the &s;aid Acts.</P>
<P>Indeed the Encourageme$ts afore&s;aid did at fir&s;t engage a great many
<PB N="38" REF="41">
able Seamen to Regi&s;ter them&s;elves, as well as many others, as afore|&s;aid,
that neither had, nor ever intended to u&s;e the Seas, <HI>viz.</HI> Cob|lers,
Barbers, Alehou&s;e-keepers, and &s;ome grave Seniors who could
well dige&s;t the 40 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> and to be exempt from all Services and
Duties on &s;hoar, and knew if they &s;hould be called for (which they
never expected) they could hand&s;omely come off with the Complement
of being old, that they are in great Bu&s;ine&s;s on &s;hoar, pay g$e$t Taxes;
and many other the like Excu&s;es, which for brevity &s;ake, I &s;hall omit:
And as for other Trade&s;men, having a Stall for a Quarter, and a Room
by the Week; they know how to avoid going to Sea, by a &s;mall
Remove, without Notice; And are well a&s;&s;ured that at the mo&s;t, they
could only lo&s;e 40 <HI>s. per Ann.</HI> which they never de&s;erved; and that
all they &s;hould receive on that Account would be clear Profit. Now
the&s;e Encouragements, as afore&s;aid, being generally and equally given,
as well to Ma&s;ters-Mates, and other Petty-Officers (who&s;e Imploy|ments
are genteel, and their Wages from 30 <HI>s.</HI> to 3 <HI>l. 5 s. per</HI> Month;
who for the Benefit of the &s;aid Imployments, are ready to enter them|&s;elves.)
As to the &s;aid Barbers in their Shops, Coblers in their Stalls,
and Alehou&s;e-keepers by their Fire-&s;ides, and &s;ome grave Seniors as
afore&s;aid; and &s;o many Taylors, Weavers, and other Land-Lubbers
(as the Seamen term them) who did go to Sea; but in bad Weather,
and hard Gales of Wind (when the able Sailors, like true Sons of
<HI>Neptune,</HI> are mo&s;t Vigorous and Brave) lay like Swabs in the Scup|pers
(as not worthy the Hatches to lie on) and as &s;o many Stumb|ling-Blocks
in their way; for the&s;e Rea&s;ons the common able Sea|men,
who alone bear the Burthen, and undergo the whole Fatigue,
can hardly per&s;wade them&s;elves, that they have due or equal Encou|ragement
by the &s;aid Acts; now whether the&s;e things added to what
is afore&s;aid, have not ob&s;tructed the Seamens Regi&s;tring, I &s;hall &s;ub|mit
to better Judgment.</P>
<P>But by what Means &s;oever, it happens (as I am informed) there are
not as afore&s;aid, 20000 Men in all Regi&s;tred, and &s;carce one third part
of Tho&s;e able Seamen. The Officers and their Servants, and the Trade&s;
men and Land-Men con&s;idered, with the Number of Regi&s;tred Men
that are dead &s;ince the Acts commenced, or are already in the Navy;
but few Regi&s;tred able Seamen will be found at this Juncture for the
Service, which with &s;ome other Matters, that I conceive worthy of
Con&s;ideration, in that they leave the Government at an uncertainty,
with re&s;pect to the finding tho&s;e that are Regi&s;tred, and if they could
be ea&s;ily procured, would be, as afore&s;aid, but a &s;mall Proportion
comparative to the Number wanting$ &s;o that it is evident the Regi&s;|ter
Acts do not an&s;wer the End de&s;igned. And this ari&s;es principally
from two Cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="42">
Fir&s;t, In that the Acts are not general, but leave all Men to their
Liberty, whether they will Regi&s;ter or not: And Secondly, Tho&s;e
that are Regi&s;tred, having Liberty to go to Sea in our own Merchant-Ships
or Foreigners (undi&s;covered) and con&s;equently may leave the
Nation; and tho&s;e that live on &s;hoar, and Regi&s;tred them&s;elves for the
afore&s;aid Advantages only, being capable by Removing to any other
part, to follow their Callings without Di&s;covery, or the lea&s;t Su&s;pition
of their being Regi&s;tred: For the&s;e Rea&s;ons it is to be feared, if the
Government &s;hould now call for them, as Regi&s;tred Men, they would
not more readily appear, than in <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March</HI> 1700, when a
Months <HI>Gratis</HI>-Money, or Bounty was promi&s;ed, without Di&s;tinction;
And although the Number then wanted was much le&s;s than the Num|ber
Regi&s;tred, the Government did not think meet to &s;ummons them,
but the Pre&s;s was very &s;evere, and the Methods thereof in &s;ome Mea|&s;ures
differed from what was practi&s;ed in the late War: For notwith|&s;tanding
Liberty was given for Men to enter them&s;elves as Volun|teers,
till the 26th of <HI>March;</HI> the Pre&s;s, as I am credibly informed,
began the 7th or 8th of the &s;ame Month, and altho the Peace con|tinued,
the Crui&s;ing-Ships have pre&s;s'd from home-ward bound Ships
ever &s;ince; and yet the Fleet that was then imployed, not &s;o well
manned, as might have been hoped, they would have been, without
tho&s;e Methods. Wherefore it being evident, That there will now be
occa&s;ion for more Men than there was the la&s;t Spring; (the Honou|rable
Hou&s;e of Commons having already voted 40000) for the Service
of this pre&s;ent Year 25000 whereof, as I am informed, are yet
wanting, there being but 1500 at pre&s;ent imployed. Now, that the
Seamen may be engaged as well as obliged to enter into the Service,
that their Grievances may be removed, and they have due Encourage|ment,
and yet the Nation &s;ave 300000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> in time of War,
which is near as much as was &s;aved (as it is termed) by the unrea|&s;onable
Q's and R's, during the late War; of which for the future,
I hope there will be little Occa&s;ion, And that the Nation's Wealth,
Strength, and Honour, may be pre&s;erved, and increa&s;ed, I &s;hall
humbly propo&s;e, as an Effectual Means, to compleat the &s;ame, the
making perfect the pre&s;ent Acts for Regi&s;tring Seamen, by making
them General or Univer&s;al within this Kingdom; which if the Wi&s;|dom
of the Nation, and the Government, think meet, it may be
extended to others of His Maje&s;ty's Dominions: For which purpo&s;e I
humbly pre&s;ume, the Officers now imployed, and Offices erected for
putting the pre&s;ent Acts in Execution, with tho&s;e that are in His
Maje&s;ty's Pay already, and the Addition, of a few Clerks, (the Charge
whereof will not be great, nor the Form differ much from that now
<PB N="40" REF="43">
u&s;ed in the Regi&s;ter-Office, and yet) will be &s;ufficient to perfect the
&s;aid Acts, and an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> If the Great Coun&s;el
of the Nation &s;hall think meet to provide and enjoin by an Act: The
Mini&s;ter, Church-wardens, or &s;uch other Parochial or Peace-Officers,
or principal Inhabitants, as &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary in every City,
Town, Burrough, Sea-port, Precinct, Divi&s;ion, and Pari&s;h, to take,
and keep at all times to come, a perfect Account of the Names, Sir-names,
Ages, Complexions, and Di&s;tinctions of every Mariner, as
well Ma&s;ters of Ships, as other Sea-faring Men, Fi&s;her-men, Water-men,
Barge-men, Hoy-men, Keel-men, and Boat-men, and of all
Ship-wrights and Caulkers, Sayl-makers and all others, who&s;e
Imyloyments and Callings immediately depends on the Water (or the
&s;aid Trades, they being al&s;o &s;erviceable in the Navy) which at the
time of the Execution of the &s;aid Act, or at any time, en&s;uing the
&s;ame, &s;hall inhabit, &s;ojourn, or re&s;ide within their re&s;pective Cities,
Towns. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to keep a di&s;tinct and perfect Book, or Regi&s;ter there|of,
in &s;uch manner as that Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly &s;hall &s;ee meet, which may
be kept as other Parochial or Church-Regi&s;ters are, or ought to be, and
Copies thereof tran&s;mitted at convenient times to the General Regi&s;ter-Office
in <HI>London,</HI> and the next adjacent Sea-port, to &s;uch City, Town,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> or &s;uch of them as &s;hall be directed; (if &s;uch Town be not a Sea-port)
that this, or &s;uch other Method of the like Nature as that
Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly &s;hall &s;ee meet to direct, for a&s;certaining the Num|bers
of &s;uch Per&s;ons in each place, will undoubtedly an&s;wer the End
propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> to Man the Navy with Expedition, and &s;ave the Na|tion
great Sums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as will appear by what follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. Hereby we may know the Number of the Per&s;ons that are of
the Callings afore&s;aid, within this Kingdom in general, and how many
are in each place, and con&s;equently what <HI>Quota</HI> is proper for them to
find, and tho&s;e may by Summons, or other publick Notice, be obliged
to appear under &s;uch Penalties as &s;hall be limited, whereby the Dila|tory
Way and Charge of Impre&s;&s;ing, and many other Inconveniencies
will be prevented, with the nece&s;&s;ary Expence of the lea&s;t (but mo&s;t
advantagious part of the former Charge) <HI>viz.</HI> (Conduct-Money)
and that without Prejudice to any, and with great Advantage to <HI>Na|vigation,</HI>
and Trade in general; which, by rea&s;on of the former Prac|tice
of Impre&s;&s;ing was greatly ob&s;tructed, e&s;pecially as afore&s;aid, in
the Sea-Ports adjacent to the Navy, and that not only with re&s;pect
to the Advance of Wages, but oftentimes after great Sums have
been laid out to equip Ships for the Seas, their Men have been all
Impre&s;t, and their Voyages overthrown, and &s;ometimes their Men
have been Impre&s;t, when their Ships were not in Safety, and the Ships
<PB N="41" REF="44">
and Cargoes by that Means lo&s;t, with many other Di&s;advantages too
numerous to in&s;ert, which by &s;uch Act and Method would be prevent|ed.
For Example, Suppo&s;e there is within this Kingdom 120000
Men, of the Callings and Imployments aforementioned, as &s;ome have
computed, and that 40000 being 2 fifth parts of them are &s;ufficient
effectually to Man the Navy (but whether more or le&s;s, is not &s;o
material; fora&s;much as the Navy mu&s;t be man'd, and that the intent
of this Subject is as afore&s;aid, that it may be done with the mo&s;t Ex|pedition
and Equality, and lea&s;t Charge to the Nation;) and &s;uppo|&s;ing
in the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and Parts adjacent, there are 3000, two
fifth parts whereof are 1200, which at the utmo&s;t Extremity will be
their <HI>quota,</HI> and there will be 1800 remaining to carry on the Merchants
Trade; who, with the help of &s;uch Land-men as would gladly u&s;e
the Seas (were they not afrighted by the Hard&s;hips aforementioned)
would be &s;ufficient for that Service, e&s;pecially con&s;idering they would
be able to proceed about their Bu&s;ine&s;s without hazard of lmpre&s;&s;ing,
but con&s;idering the Number of Seamen already imployed in the Ser|vice,
and the Officers and their Servants that will be imployed in the
Ships that are now to equip, and many Land-men that will enter them|&s;elves;
their <HI>quota</HI> will not amount to 500 Men, and tho&s;e may with
much ea&s;e be rai&s;ed in few days as afore&s;aid, and tho&s;e will in proba|bility
be the younge&s;t Men; it being for the Advantage of every Place to
&s;end tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t Families, and Charge, and would by that
Means le&s;&s;en their Poors Rate, which will al&s;o be of great Advantage
to the Nation, for the young men, during the late War, having no &s;ettled
Habitations, could with ea&s;e, and often did ab&s;cond until the Pre&s;s hath
been over, and then having the opportunity of going long Voyages in
Merchant-Ships, e&s;cap'd the Service; which Practice by &s;uch Act
will be prevented. Bur fora&s;much as divers Objections may ari&s;e
again&s;t &s;uch Act, and that I find two principal Ones in the &s;aid Trea|ti&s;e
of the honoured Commi&s;&s;ioner <HI>Geo.</HI> St. <HI>Loe</HI>'s; wherein in&s;tead of
a General Regi&s;ter, &s;ome other Method is propo&s;ed, which I &s;hall
not mention, but proceed to the &s;aid Objections.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t is, That there is no Occa&s;ion for &s;uch General
Regi&s;ter: But this being an&s;wered by the Nation's Experience. I &s;hall
proceed to the &s;econd; which is, That &s;uch Act would be very diffi|cult:
Which I &s;hall con&s;ider, and an&s;wer thus. As for the Difficulty,
it mu&s;t ari&s;e either from the Trouble or Uncertainty that will attend
the taking and keeping &s;uch Regi&s;ter, or in finding out ways to obl$ge
the Seamen to go into the Service, when thus Regi&s;tred; both wh$ch
&s;eeming Difficulties, with many others which might be mentioned,
<PB N="42" REF="45">
I doubt not but to clear, and demon&s;trate the Facility of bringing the
&s;aid Regi&s;ter Acts in a very &s;hort time to great Perfection: And fir&s;t;
as for taking &s;uch Account, or General Regi&s;ter, as afore&s;aid, it may
be bone by the &s;ame Per&s;ons, and in like manner at the &s;ame time, (if
it &s;hall be judged convenient) as an Account is taken for &s;uch Tax as
&s;hall be laid on Land, Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors being obliged to go
to every Hou&s;e to inform them&s;elves of the Rent, Inhabitants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they
may with much ea&s;e take &s;uch Account of the Per&s;ons afore&s;aid, as
required: And to the Regi&s;ter-Office it will be little trouble, and not
more difficult than the pre&s;ent Method, by rea&s;on the Method intended
need not differ much from the Method now in Practice, and yet be
&s;ufficient to perfect the Acts, and make it of great Advantage; which
will appear by the following An&s;wers to &s;ome other Objections (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> It may be objected, that many Seamen will be abroad when
&s;uch Regi&s;ter is taken, and con&s;equently leave the Regi&s;ter imperfect,
by rea&s;on of their not being Regi&s;tered.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer:</HI> This may very ea&s;ily, and in a &s;hort time, be remedied
by &s;uch Method of this, or the like Nature, as &s;hall be judged pro|per
(<HI>viz.</HI>) an Account may be taken at the return of every Ship from
Sea into any part of this Kingdom, of the Names, Sir-names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of
every Sea-faring Man that belongs to them; and this may be done by
the re&s;pective Surveyors, or Officers, appointed to put in Execution
the Act for pre&s;erving our Navigation, who&s;e Duties it is to vi&s;it every
Ship, and take an Account of the Mariners, that the Ma&s;ters may not
employ more Foreigners than that Act allows. But whether by the&s;e,
or any other Officers, it may with ea&s;e be done; but I pre&s;ume it
will be a certain and infallible Means to perfect the &s;aid Act, if it
be provided that no Ma&s;ter or Commander of any Ship or Ve&s;&s;el, or
any others, holding, or u&s;ing the &s;everal Callings or Employments
aforementioned, &s;hall Receive, Entertain, or Employ any Per&s;ons in
any of their Ships, Ve&s;&s;els, Barges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or in, or about the &s;aid Em|ployments
(except as Labourers only, and di&s;tinct from the proper
Arts, Workman&s;hip, or Bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;aid Callings) unle&s;s the Per|&s;ons
&s;o to be employed be fir&s;t Regi&s;tered, and a regular Certificate
thereof produced, in from, as &s;hall be appointed; and if any Per&s;on
&s;hall pre&s;ume to entertain in any of the Services or Employments
afore&s;aid, any but Regi&s;tered Per&s;ons, both the Per&s;on &s;o employed,
or &s;erving, and the Per&s;on that employs him, may &s;uffer &s;uch Pen|alties
or Fines, as by the &s;aid Act &s;hall be provided, and as by the
pre&s;ent Act is provided again&s;t undue Regi&s;tring, fal&s;e vouching, lend|ing
Certificates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or &s;uch other Penalty as &s;hall be inflicted; &s;o
that by this means all that depend on the &s;aid Employments, would
<PB N="43" REF="46">
be obliged to Regi&s;ter them&s;elves, or could not follow the &s;ame; and
tho&s;e Per&s;ons by the following Method, or &s;uch like, will readily be
found on any occa&s;ion, if within the Kingdom, and if not in the King|dom,
it will appear where they are, thus; If the Commander of every
Ship outward bound (who&s;e Duty it is to give his Owners) a Port|lige
Bill (as they commonly call it) <HI>viz.</HI> an Account of the Names,
Sir-names, Offices, and Wages of their Ships Company, the Regi&s;ter
Number only of each Per&s;on being added to &s;uch Account, and Dupli|cates
thereof, delivered to the Officers of each Port where the Ship
&s;hall clear the like at their Arrival and Return, (as by the pre&s;ent Acts
they are obliged to do upon Oath, if required;) one of which Ac|counts,
or Duplicates, being &s;ent up to the general Regi&s;ter-Office,
would an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed, and be otherwi&s;e very advantageous,
as might ea&s;ily be made appear.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> It may be objected, That as well Foreigners as His Maje&s;ty's
Natural-born Subjects that do not immediately belong to the King|dom
of <HI>England,</HI> not being compri&s;ed within this Act, nor their Com|panies
obliged to Regi&s;ter them&s;elves; the Regi&s;tred Seamen may
&s;erve on Board &s;uch Ships undi&s;covered, and con&s;equently avoid the
Service, and if &s;o inclined, leave the Nation. This Objection I con|ceive
may be thus removed, if it be provided that no &s;uch Foreigners,
nor others, under &s;evere Penalties, receive on Board any but the
proper Companies that they brought in with them, without Notice
given to, and &s;pecial Licen&s;e obtained from, the Commi&s;&s;ioners for
Executing the Act, and Security may be taken for the Performance.
The Parallel Ca&s;e we have, by our Commanders giving Security in
our own Plantations, not to carry off Inhabitants without Licen&s;e;
and further, to prevent any Fraud or Collu&s;ion, a certain Protection or
Certificate might at their fir&s;t Arrival be given them of the Names,
Sir-names, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of their Companies, and the &s;ame deliver'd up again
at their clearing from &s;uch Port as they &s;hall depart from; the Charge
whereof would be &s;mall, and might be defrayed by the &s;aid Foreign|ers:
It is therefore evident, that &s;uch Provi&s;ion being made, and the
Act duly executed, as I am well per&s;waded it may with Ea&s;e, (and
&s;mall Charge to the Government) be done, as might more plainly be
demon&s;trated, if the de&s;igned Brevity of this Treati&s;e would admit:
And would undoubtedly an&s;wer the End propo&s;ed (<HI>viz.</HI>) make the Re|gi&s;ter-Acts
perfect, &s;erviceable, and of very great Benefit to the Na|tion
in general; as will appear by &s;ome few of many, I may &s;ay, al|mo&s;t
innumerable Advantages that would attend the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t.</HI> By this Method the whole Navy may be Man'd in forty Days
at mo&s;t; the Seamen after Summons being able to repair to the Pla|ces
<PB N="44" REF="47">
ordered in that time from the remote&s;t parts of the Kingdom;
and by &s;uch &s;peedy Equipping the Navy, or any particular Squadron,
the Nations Enemies will be prevented from taking tho&s;e Advantages
they obtained during the late War, by the delatory Proceedings for
want of Men; their Fleet having been earlier at Sea than ours, to the
hazard of the greate&s;t part of the Navy, as afore hinted; and as
for our Squadrons de&s;igned for particular Services, they have been &s;o
long Equipping and Manning, that our De&s;igns have been often di&s;|covered,
and the Enemies had Opportunities to oppo&s;e them; by
which Means whole Fleets under &s;trong Convoys, have been defeated
and &s;cattered, and many de&s;troyed, as before mentioned, which by
&s;uch &s;peedy Equipping and Manning of them would al&s;o be prevented.</P>
<P><HI>2dly.</HI> This would prevent the great Charge and Inconveniencies of
Impre&s;&s;ing; and the Officers and Mariners formerly employed in tho&s;e
Services, would be very &s;erviceable in fitting their re&s;pective Ships for
the Sea, as afore&s;aid; and tho&s;e that are to &s;erve would al&s;o be ob|liged
to repair on Board within the time limited, and &s;o prevent the
Charge of their Wages and Provi&s;ions, for &s;everal Months before they
arrived at their re&s;pective Ships, as it often happened during the late
War, and will al&s;o prevent their being taken in tho&s;e Pre&s;s-Ve&s;&s;els,
and not only &s;ecure their Service, but al&s;o &s;ave the Freight and Charge
of &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els, and their Companies, and likewi&s;e the value of the
Ve&s;&s;els if they &s;hould be taken, as it often happened in the late War:
The Charge whereof, (as before mentioned, being computed to amount
to very great Sums) by this Means would al&s;o be &s;aved to the
Nation.</P>
<P><HI>3dly.</HI> This would prevent the keeping our great Ships in Pay the
whole Winter, or putting them in Commi&s;&s;ion and Pay in <HI>De|cember,</HI>
or the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> and yet not compleatly Man'd
in <HI>May,</HI> tho three or four Pre&s;s Ve&s;&s;els, Officers and Gangs for each
fir&s;t and &s;econd Rate, and two or more for the third Rates, have been
the whole time employed in entring Volunteers, and Impre&s;&s;ing Men
all over the Kingdom; the which alone being prevented, would &s;ave
to the Nation more than the 300000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> afore&s;aid; as every
Ingenious Reader may with ea&s;e demon&s;trate and prove to his own
Satisfaction; and was by Commi&s;&s;ioner St. <HI>Loe,</HI> computed at more
than 500000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>4thly.</HI> This will make the Burthen of the War more equal, and
con&s;equently more tolerable to the Trading part of the Nation, e&s;pe|cially
to the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Places as afore&s;aid adjacent to the
Navy, not only with re&s;pect to their Safety in their Voyages, and ex|travagant
Charge to Men of Wars-Men to bring their Ships up a few
<PB N="45" REF="48">
Leagues when their Companies are Impre&s;t, and the Lo&s;s of great
Sums expended to fit them to Sea, in overthrowing their Voyages by
Impre&s;&s;ing their Men when ready to &s;ail, but al&s;o by reducing the
extravagant Wages at &s;uch times given in the afore&s;aid Places, more
than others. For In&s;tance, The Traders between <HI>New Ca&s;tle</HI> and <HI>Lon|don</HI>
were forced to give to Pentioners, and other decripped, aged, and
di&s;abled Men 7 and 8 <HI>l.</HI> a Voyage, and 55 <HI>s.</HI> or 3 <HI>l. per</HI> Month to very
ordinary Men in Merchants Ships; and indeed it any others were
employed by them, they would immediately be impre&s;s'd from them;
and at the &s;ame time in Places more remote, they gave but 40 <HI>s. per</HI>
Month to able Seamen that failed in their Merchant Ships, and little
more to tho&s;e in the Coa&s;ting Trade, than in time of Peace; the Rea|&s;on
whereof is plain (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Impre&s;t-Ve&s;&s;els that went to tho&s;e
parts to Impre&s;s, were but few, and they could not &s;tay many Months
there, e&s;pecially finding few Seamen; for they by ab&s;conding 6
Weeks, or 2 or 3 Months at mo&s;t, could avoid the Pre&s;s; and when
the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;els were gone, could return, and take the Opportunity
of going abroad, and &s;o e&s;cape the Service which occa&s;ioned the able&s;t
Seamen to retire to tho&s;e Places, and by that means our Merchant
Ships belonging to this City, have been &s;o pittifully Man'd, that
many have been taken by the Enemy, which would otherwi&s;e have
made a good Defence.</P>
<P>5 <HI>thly.</HI> This would encourage the Ma&s;ters, and others in the Coal-Trade
(which is not the lea&s;t Nur&s;ery) to breed up Seamen, e&s;pe|cially
if it were provided, that no Apprentice &s;hould be ordered into
the Service, till he had &s;erved &s;uch Term of his Apprencice-&s;hip as
&s;hould be judged meet, and to prevent any Fraud, it &s;eems convenient to
Regi&s;ter every Apprentice as the time of his Binding, and di&s;tingui&s;h
him as &s;uch, which would al&s;o be of great Advantage to the Ma&s;|ter;
who by that means would have his Wages &s;ecured to him; and
know from time to time where &s;uch Apprentice was, and would give
him the Advantage of &s;uch Apprentices Service till they were fit to
&s;erve His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><HI>6thly.</HI> This Method would prevent the many Frauds and Injuries
that happen to the Seamen, their Friends and Relations, for want of
&s;uch di&s;tinction; there being many times 5 or 6 of one Name in a
Ship, and &s;ome of them happen to be made Run, others die, or are
turned over into other Ships, and frequently receive each others Wages,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Per&s;on that is run receives the Wages of him that did not run
whereby he lo&s;es the &s;ame; and the Friends of tho&s;e that are ab&s;ent
or dead, not being able to di&s;tingui&s;h, whether the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> was their Relations, have been denied their Wages, which by the
<PB N="46" REF="49">
Regi&s;ter-Number alone would be prevented; but $ora&s;much as a la$r+ger
Volume than this pre&s;ent Tract, would not contain the Advanta|ges
that would accrue to the Nation in general by &s;uch Acts, being as
afore&s;aid, almo&s;t innumerable; I &s;hall leave the Candid Reader to
con&s;ider the &s;ame, with two Objections more that have been made a|gain&s;t
&s;uch Act.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Seamen's Freedom and Liberty, as Engli&s;h Men, (by
the right of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws of the Realm)
exempt them from being impre&s;s'd, or otherwi&s;e compell'd into His
Maje&s;ty's Service.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That &s;uch an Act will tend to the infringing of His Ma|je&s;ty's
Royal Prerogative; both which I &s;hall with all Submi&s;&s;ion to
the Learned an&s;wer thus.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As for the Seamen's Freedom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it cannot be no longer
maintained than defended again&s;t a common Enemy when invaded;
and were it not for the Seamen, (who as afore-hinted, are the Strength
or Bullwarks of the Nation) &s;uch Defence could not be made:
Therefore the Laws of all Nations, as well as the Law of
Nature, and that inherent In&s;tinct of Self-pre&s;ervation, demon&s;trates
it to be the Duty of every Subject to defend and maintain to the
$word$ of their Power, and in their proper Stations, the Common-Weal
of the Nations, to which they are allied, con&s;equently the
Seamen in theirs, and to that very End the Regal Power and Prero|$ative
is exerted (<HI>viz.</HI>) to cau&s;e all in times of Danger and Nece&s;|&s;ity
or a &s;uffiicent Number at lea&s;t to &s;uccour and defend the whole;
and as for the Royal Prerogative, &s;uch Act will rather confirm than
intringe, by obliging the Subjects more readily to appear when requi|red
by the Royal Command, and much more agreeable to the Regal
Dignity, Peace, and Authority, than the former Practice of Impre&s;|&s;ing:
The Injuries which occur'd by the Irregularity of the &s;ame, would
have been more intolerable, had not the Per&s;ons that &s;uffered thereby,
&s;acrificed their private Intere&s;t to His Maje&s;ty's Honour, the advancing
and encouraging His Service, and the Nations Wellfare.</P>
<P>Many more Objections might be rai&s;ed, and (I doubt not) with
the former be more fully an&s;wered; and many more, I may &s;ay, as
before, almo&s;t innumerable Advantages that will attend &s;uch Regi&s;ter
be proved; but not con&s;i&s;ting with my pre&s;ent intended Brevity, I
&s;hall avoid incerting of them: And if it be asked, how the able com|mon
Seamen (who I pre&s;ume, are the principal Per&s;ons that now &s;uf|fer)
may have due Encouragement; to this I an&s;wer, they may have
ample and due Encouragement in time of War, and equivalent with
<PB N="47" REF="50">
that now granted and confirmed by the Regi&s;ter-Acts, with le&s;s
Charge to the Government, and more Satisfaction to the Seamen, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Act provides, as afore&s;aid, for 30000 Men at 40 <HI>s.
per Annum</HI> each, being 60000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> which as aforemention|ed,
is equally de&s;igned for Ma&s;ters-Mates, and all other Petty-Offi|cers,
Ordinary Seamen, and many Land-man, who clande&s;tinly for
the Benefits afore&s;aid, have Regi&s;tred them&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding
their Circum&s;tances are &s;uch as will not admit them to go to Sea;
the&s;e, as afore&s;aid, having as much right, as well to the 40 <HI>s. per An|num,</HI>
both in Peace and War (although they never were at Sea, or at
lea&s;t &s;ince they were Regi&s;tred, nor ever intended to go there) as to
all other Benefits of the Acts, as the able common Seamen have,
who bear the Burthen of the Day, the Fatigue of the Storms, and
heat of the Battles, and were as afore&s;aid undoubtedly the principal
Per&s;ons intended by that Augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly to be incouraged: If there|fore
the Wi&s;dom of the Nation &s;hould &s;ee meet to give the common
able Seamen &s;ome other Incouragement, by way of Di&s;tinction from
tho&s;e that are unde&s;erving I mean, tho&s;e Barbers, Coblers, Tinkers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from others much better provided for, as Petty-Officers, and
that as much, or more to the common Seamen's Satisfaction, yet
with le&s;s Charge, and much Advantage to the Nation as afore&s;aid,
than what is provided by the pre&s;ent Regi&s;ter-Acts, the Common
Seamen would be better &s;atisfied than now they are: And indeed in
time of Di&s;tre&s;s, to have many who go under the Name, and have
equal Encouragement with able Saylors, to lie as &s;o many Stumbling-Blocks
in their way, they cannot behold without great Regret; And
it is judged by many, that the Ignorance of tho&s;e, and their Inability,
to help in times of Di&s;tre&s;s, has occa&s;ioned the Lo&s;s of many of the
Royal Navy. We having lo&s;t, during the late War, a better Navy
than <HI>France</HI> could boa&s;t of, not many Years &s;ince, and are, as I am
informed, many more than were lo&s;t in all the Wars be&s;ides for 50
Years pa&s;t; but I &s;hall forbear to in&s;ert the Number of them; Where|fore
if &s;ome Con&s;ideration or Allowance were given only, or princi|pally
to the &s;aid common able Seamen in lieu of the &s;aid 40 <HI>s. per An|num,</HI>
and that only for the time they are actually in His Maje&s;ty's
Service, and to be paid with, and as an Advance to their Wages, it
would an&s;wer the Ends aforementioned. For Example; Suppo&s;e the
Great Council of the Nation &s;hould think meet to add in times of War
3 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, to the able Seamen's Wages, and &s;uppo&s;ing them to
be 20000, this would amount to 39000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> if they were
all employed the whole Year; but by the preceeding Propo&s;ition,
nigh one fourth part of that would be &s;aved by the Men's Di&s;charge,
<PB N="48" REF="51">
when the great Ships are laid up in time of War, and more than one
half if it &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary to give the &s;ame in time of Peace,
and no Per&s;on has any Ground or Colour of Di&s;content for not having
Wages without Work or Attendance, as is the Ca&s;e of the 40 <HI>s. per
Annum,</HI> War and Peace, and if it be thought proper to give &s;ome
Encouragement to the Ordinary Seamen, and &s;ome of the Petty Offi|cers,
it would not amount to near the Sum that is now appointed, both
in War and Peace. I &s;hall add to what is afore&s;aid, as a further En|couragement
for the Seamen in general, the Project of a late Member
of the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, for making Seamens Tickets
more Current, and in good E&s;teem, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>An Humble Propo&s;al to the Honourable Hou&s;e of Commons, with re&s;pect
to the Seamens Wages for the Year 1700.</HEAD>
<P>THere being allowed for the Year 1700, for the Service of the
Navy &s;even thou&s;and Seamen, Officers included, who&s;e, Wa|ges
amounts to 150000 <HI>l.</HI> little more or le&s;&s;; If the &s;aid Officers and
Seamen be immediately di&s;charged, after their Arrival into Port, with
Tickets &s;igned, as herein after is de&s;cribed, and &s;uch Tickets be made
current in all the Publick Revenues (that are not already appropria|ted)
with Intere&s;t at Two and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> till di&s;charged in the
Cour&s;e of the Navy.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The&s;e following Advantages will ari&s;e thereby;</HEAD>
<P>I. Very great Sums will be &s;aved to the Nation, which mu&s;t other|wi&s;e
of nece&s;&s;ity be expended for Wage and Provi&s;ions, before Mo|nies
can be &s;ent to <HI>Plymouth, Port&s;mouth,</HI> &amp;c. to pay the Seamen, as
was in like Ca&s;e for Admiral <HI>Aylmer</HI>'s Squadron, and the <HI>We&s;t-India,</HI>
and other Ships, &s;ome of which were laid up, and kept in Pay near
two Years for want of Money to di&s;charge them.</P>
<P>II. The great Charge of &s;ending Monies to the &s;aid Places, and of
the Commi&s;&s;ioners and Clerks to attend the Payments, will al&s;o be
prevented.</P>
<P>III. The Intolerable Charge and Fatigue which the poor Seamen
their Wives and Relations have been expo&s;ed to in Travelling to the
afore&s;aid Places; and their being ab&s;ent many Months from their Ha|bitations,
waiting for the Ships payments, will wholly be pre|vented.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
IV. The great Lo&s;s which the Seamen and their Families have &s;u&s;|tained
by &s;elling their Tickets through Nece&s;&s;ity, (&s;ome having lo&s;t
Seven, and others above Ten &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> Pound, an Oppre&s;&s;ion that
cries aloud for Relief) will be &s;aved to them, and the Trade of Tick|et-buying
de&s;troyed, and the Frauds that often happen will be prevent|ed,
and the Seamens Tickets, after Signed and Confirmed, will be rea|dy
Moneys to them in all Parts of the Kingdom, being provided for
by Parliament.</P>
<P>V. This will take off for the future all occa&s;ion of Clamours, on ac|count
of Q's and R's, and can be no more a Vexation to the Honoura|ble
Hou&s;e of Commons or Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy; and whatever
may be &s;uppo&s;ed to occa&s;ion the Seamens de&s;erting the Nations Service,
the want of their Pay has been one Material Cau&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>VI. If Two &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> Month be added to the Common Seamens
Pay, the &s;ame (with the Encouragement of a regular Di&s;charge <HI>per</HI>
Currant Tickets, as afore&s;aid) will be a means to Man our Navy, in
ca&s;e of another War (which God forbid) without Impre&s;&s;ing, and there|by
&s;ave to the Nation a great Sum <HI>per An.</HI> which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be
expended on that Account: And although there be four times the Num|ber
of Seamen employed, the &s;ame Method may be pre&s;erved, or every
Year renewed by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>If it be objected, That the Tickets will be a Paper-Credit without
a Fund, that cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, if it be already provided for: But
grant it were not. The Tickets, as they now are, are a Paper-Di&s;|credit
both to King and People; And it is better to give Two and a
half <HI>per Cent.</HI> by way of Intere&s;t, (which will not amount to any
great Sum, by rea&s;on few Men will be di&s;charged until the Year be
expired, and con&s;equently the greate&s;t part of the Taxes collected)
than to &s;uffer &s;o great a Di&s;credit, as the Seamens Tickets have been,
for &s;everal years pa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53">
And as for Counterfeiting the &s;aid Tickets, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed,

<P>Now in ca&s;e the Advantages to the Government are &s;uch as afore|mentioned,

of the Nation will find Means to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame; Indeed one
great Objection again&s;t that Propo&s;al, was the hazard of having the
Tickets counterfeited; but as that would have been very difficult
when it was propo&s;ed, it will be much more, if &s;uch Regi&s;ter be ta|ken
and kept, and it will be next to an Impo&s;&s;ibility to counterfeit Tic|kets;
for no Per&s;on will be able to per&s;onate another, unle&s;s he has
al&s;o his Regi&s;ter-Certificate, and if he has, it will do him no Service
unle&s;s he has his Ticket al&s;o; and if &s;uch Accident &s;hould happen,
<PB N="51" REF="54">
it may be provided, that no &s;uch Ticket &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned to any Per|&s;on,
but in the Pre&s;ence of one, or more of the Commi&s;&s;ion or War|rant-Officers
belonging to the &s;ame Ship, wherein the &s;aid Per&s;on
&s;er'vd, and mu&s;t therefore know him to be the real Per&s;on, unle&s;s it
be at the place of the Per&s;on's Aboad, or where he is very well known,
and there to be vouched by &s;uch principal Inhabitants as know him.
A Penalty might al&s;o be inflicted on &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hould accept any
Ticket, unle&s;s vouched, as afore&s;aid; this will al&s;o prevent the Cap|tains
being impo&s;ed on by their Clerks; &s;everal of whom have made
out Tickets for &s;ome Men's Service that were not di&s;charged by Tic|ket,
and kept and di&s;po&s;ed of the &s;ame to their own u&s;e, per&s;onating
tho&s;e that &s;erved for the Wages; and others have made out two Tickets
for one Man's Service, and &s;old one of them for their own advantage;
and in both the&s;e Ca&s;es the Officers Hands being required to tho&s;e
Tickets, they mu&s;t either be forged, or the Officers impo&s;ed on. But I
&s;hall leave this to be improv'd by &s;ome more Noble and Ingenious
Pen, and conclude with &s;ome brief Hints of the many Advantages
that might be added to the mo&s;t Noble and Royal Ho&s;pital at <HI>Green|wich,</HI>
and an Encouragement to <HI>Navigation</HI> in general, and would be
a Means to extend the Charity and Relief of the &s;ame through the
whole Kingdom, whereof we have a fair Epitomy (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Antient
and Worthy Society or Brother-hood of the <HI>Trinity-Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Deptford

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing whereby the Revenues of the Ho&s;pital of Greenwich, may be
advanced, and the Charitable Influences thereof extended through
the whole Nation.</HEAD>
<P>THat which I would offer as advantageous to the Ho&s;pital in the
fir&s;t place, is humbly to recommend to &s;erious Con&s;ideration,
the due Execution of the Laws again&s;t Profane Cur&s;ing and Swearing
in the Royal Navy, and the Officers due Ob&s;ervance of their In&s;truc|tions,
who are enjoined under Pecuniary Penalties, not to Swear or
Cur&s;e profanely; and in ca&s;e tho&s;e Forfeitures were duly collected
and applied to the Benefit of the Ho&s;pital, it would not only great|ly
advance the Revenue thereof (for &s;ome time at lea&s;t) but would
in all probability &s;uppre&s;s that which neither His Maje&s;ty's di&s;counte|nance,
<PB N="52" REF="55">
the Injunctions by their In&s;tructions, the Laws of God, and
of this Realm, hath hitherto done, I mean, &s;uppre&s;s the Epidemical
abounding of tho&s;e horrid unprofitable Sins, and the publick Glory
many of them take in it.</P>
<P>2. Whereas the pre&s;ent Act enjoyns all Per&s;ons u&s;ing the Seas, to
pay out of their Wages &s;ix Pence <HI>per</HI> Month, except Regi&s;tred Men
(who do not pay it in His Maje&s;ty's Service, whatever they do in Mer|chant-Men)
and yet they alone have the Benefits of the Acts and Ho&s;|pital.
Now as an Addition to the Ho&s;pitals Revenues, if the Com|manders,
and all other Officers in Merchants Ships, who&s;e Wages
exceeds 40 <HI>s. per Men&s;em,</HI> &s;hould pay in proportion to their Wages,
or &s;o much as the wi&s;e Senate &s;hall think meet; and if the Commi&s;|&s;ion
and Warrant-Officers in His Maje&s;ty's Navy allowed in like Pro|portion,
and the Seamen in general in time of War, paid 12 <HI>d. per</HI>
Month to the Ho&s;pital, and 6 <HI>d.</HI> in time of Peace, or &s;uch other Sums
as &s;hall be thought proper, it would greatly add to the Ho&s;pitals Re|venues,
and be a plentiful Spring flowing into the &s;ame, whereby
it would become a univer&s;al Fountain to refre&s;h with it's Streams the
drooping Spirits of all the mi&s;erable Seamen, and their Families: For
which, as well as for uniting the <HI>Che&s;t</HI> at <HI>Chatham,</HI> to the &s;aid Ho&s;pi|tal,
&s;ome few Rea&s;ons of many which might be given, I &s;hall here
humbly offer.</P>
<P>That it is rea&s;onable for the Captains of the Men of War to con|tribute
to the Ho&s;pital in &s;ome Proportion to their Wages, will appear
from the Con&s;iderations following.</P>
<P>1. Such Captains, who through Age, Infirmity, and other Acci|dents,
are unfit for farther Service, are provided for, at the publick
Charge, by &s;utable Pen&s;ions to them&s;elves during Life; and if they
are &s;lain, large Bounties to their Wives and Children; and this u&s;ually
accounted, allowed, and paid as part of the E&s;timate of the Navy.</P>
<P>2. They being employed in the Nations Service, and their Salleries,
Wages, and other Benefits (which are very large) being defrayed
at the publick Charge. And this Charitable Ho&s;pital being for the
Publick Good, it is very rea&s;onable tho&s;e Gentlemen u&s;ing the Seas,
and receiving the afore&s;aid Advantages thereby, &s;hould contribute to
the Charge thereof.</P>
<P>3. 'Tis by the hazard of the Lives, and at the Expence of the Blood
of the Per&s;ons intended to be provided for by the Ho&s;pital, that the
Honour of tho&s;e Gentlemen is gained, and therefore rea&s;onable they
&s;hould contribute toward their Relief.</P>
<P>The like will hold for the other Commi&s;&s;ion and Warrant-Officers.</P>
<P>And the Rea&s;on why the Commanders, and other Officers of Merchants
Ships, &s;hould pay in &s;ome proportion to their Wages, is what holds
<PB N="53" REF="56">
as a con&s;tant Maxim in all publick Taxes, <HI>viz.</HI> That every one &s;hall con|tribute
to the publick Charge according to their Abilities; be&s;ides
they will receive a con&s;iderable Advantage by the Act, if perfected,
with re&s;pect to the knowing where their Apprentices and Servants are
from time to time, and thereby &s;ecuring their Wages, which they
formerly generally lo&s;t; but it will be more rea&s;onable, and a further
Encouragement, as well to the Commanders and Officers, as the com|mon
Seamen in Merchants Service (who have now no benefit by the
&s;aid Acts) not only to pay to the &s;aid Ho&s;pital what they now do, but
more in time of War, as afore&s;aid; if they al&s;o might have the bene|fit
of the Ho&s;pital in ca&s;e of the Lo&s;s of Limbs, or other Accidents that
&s;hall befal them, in defending the Merchants Ships, which would en|courage
them &s;o to do, and remove that great ob&s;truction which now
prevents it (<HI>viz.</HI>) the fear of &s;uch Damage, and the evil Con&s;equence
thereof, no provi&s;ion being made for their Releif; and it &s;eems a great
Hard&s;hip that Per&s;ons &s;hould hazard their Lives and Limbs in His Ma|je&s;ty's
Service, as well as in Merchant Ships, and pay &s;o much to|wards
the Maintainance of an Ho&s;pital, and yet receive no Advantage
by it, as is the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e Seamen that are not Regi&s;ter'd. But I &s;hall
proceed, and briefly mention &s;ome few Rea&s;ons for, and Advantages
that will accrue by the uniting of the <HI>Che&s;t</HI> at <HI>Chatham</HI> to the &s;aid Ho&s;|pital;
and &s;o conclude.</P>
<P>1. It appears to be rea&s;onable fora&s;much as the &s;aid <HI>Che&s;t</HI> was &s;oun|ded
at the Seamens own Reque&s;t, and proper Charge, there being at
that time no provi&s;ion made for them, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould be wound|ed
or mained, but being now provided for by the &s;aid Ho&s;pital; there
is no further Occa&s;ion for the &s;aid expence (<HI>viz.</HI>) the 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Month,
which the Regi&s;tered Seamen provided for, as afore&s;aid, as well as
tho&s;e that are not Regi&s;tered, that &s;erve in the Navy, &s;till pay as well
in Peace as War.</P>
<P>2. The Advantage to the Ho&s;pital will be very con&s;iderable, becau&s;e
the &s;aid <HI>Che&s;t</HI> have great Incomes; having purcha&s;ed, as I am inform|ed,
near 3000 Pounds <HI>per Ann.</HI> in free Lands; which after the Death
of the pre&s;ent Pen&s;ioners, would be a free Income to the Ho&s;pital; and
with which, and the Seamens Contribution afore&s;aid, the <HI>Che&s;t</HI> provides
for, and &s;atisfies all tho&s;e that are, or have been hurt, maimed, or lo&s;t any
Limbs in His Maje&s;ty's Service, ever &s;ince the &s;aid <HI>Che&s;t</HI> was founded:
Many other weighty Rea&s;ons and con&s;iderable Advantages which might
be made appear, I &s;hall forbear to mention, with &s;ome other Matters
intended for the Advantage of <HI>Navigation</HI> in general; but this, with
the Improvement of what is before only hinted, for Brevity &s;ake, &s;hall
leave for &s;ome more Noble Mind, and dexterous Pen, and &s;ubmit the
&s;ame to the Con&s;ideration of the Wi&s;dom of the Nation.</P>
