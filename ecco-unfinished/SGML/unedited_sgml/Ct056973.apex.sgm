<HEAD>A Sharp REBUKE From one of the PEOPLE called <HI>QUAKERS,</HI> TO <HI>Henry Sacheverell,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Friend</HI> Henry Sacheverell,</P>
<P>_HAVING been moved to &s;peak unto others who inter|meddle with publick Things whereunto they are not call'd, and being likewi&s;e inclined to rebuke many, who break forth in the &s;ame Evil Way, I write thee this Epi&s;tle in the next place.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
And howbeit thou art one of tho&s;e, who &s;ette&s;t at nought the Coun&s;el of the Prudent, and who &s;itte&s;t in the Seat of the Scornful; neverthele&s;s I am con&s;trained to &s;peak unto thee, if not for thy Amendment, (verily that will be according as thou &s;hall't re|ceive it) yet for thy Rebuke, and for the Sake of them that &s;tand by.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou ha&s;t troubled <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for &s;ome Years of thy Life pa&s;t; and if I &s;hould look upon thee for the Days of thy Youth, thou ha&s;t not only &s;pent them in much Vanity, but even in the Abominati|on of unclean Things; howbeit I &s;hall not, at this time, rebuke thee as thou art a Sin|ner again&s;t the Lord, there is one that re|buketh thee, even thy Con&s;cience, who is the Mini&s;ter of the Spirit within thee; who, if thou woulde&s;t li&s;ten to its Voice, would with Faithfulne&s;s witne&s;s again&s;t thee, for thy vile Conver&s;ation, thy Drunkenne&s;s, thy Swearing, thy Abu&s;ing of Women, and many of thy &s;aid Practices, as well during thy Re&s;idence at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where thou ought|te&s;t to have been an In&s;tructor of Youth, and a Teacher of Vertue, as in <HI>Stafford&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and other Places, where thy Name is become a Stink in the No&s;trils of the People.</P>
<P>But I wot <HI>Henry,</HI> that it &s;eemeth more meet at this Time, to Commune with
<PB N="5" REF="4">
thee in thy more Publick Capacity, and to Rebuke thee, as thou art an Offender a|gain&s;t Men; Verily in this, Friend <HI>Henry,</HI> thou art worthy of Rebuke; for thou ha&s;t not moved the People of the Land unto Peaceable Things, and to live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty, but thou ha&s;t moved to Wrath, to Strife, and to all that is Contentious among Men, wherein thou ha&s;t exceeded all that have gone before thee; neither hath any brought the Execution of Ju&s;tice upon them&s;elves with more ju&s;t Demerit, than thou ha&s;t, al|beit they have pa&s;s'd out of the Body there|fore, and thou remaine&s;t for a while.</P>
<P>Plainly, <HI>Henry,</HI> the Land hath been long afflicted, by rea&s;on of the Violence of thy Evil Tongue; for thou &s;peake&s;t Words of Bitterne&s;s in the Hou&s;e of Wor&s;hip, and ex|alte&s;t thy&s;elf again&s;t thy Rulers in the High-Place of the City; for this it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to Rebuke thee; for the whole Congregation &s;pake with one Voice again&s;t thee, and the A&s;&s;embly of the Nobles, the Princes, and the Elders Condemned thee; howbeit thou hearkned&s;t not unto the Voice of Correction; they Reproved thee, but thou wa&s;t not Reproved, but thou hardne&s;t thy Face as Bra&s;s, and thy Heart as a ne|ther Mill&s;tone, and thou &s;peake&s;t in the Ears of the People, that thou wer't Righteous;
<PB N="6" REF="5">
whereas they who judg'd in the Gates, &s;aw that thou wer't Vile, yea, more Vile than tho&s;e whom thou had'&s;t reproved.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, Mercy was &s;hewn thee in the Days of the Reign of <HI>Anne</HI> the Queen, who being a Woman, was moved to have Compa&s;&s;ion on thee; being deluded by thy Tongue, &s;peaking borrowed Words, which albeit they were Words of Deceit and Fal&s;hood, yet prevailed on the merciful In|firmities of the &s;aid Queen, and &s;he was de|&s;irous to have &s;aved thee from Shame.</P>
<P>But thou exalted thy Head, and lifted'&s;t up thy&s;elf as a Guiltle&s;s Per&s;on, cau&s;ing thy|&s;elf to rejoice in the Sentence of the Nobles, as if it had been a Deliverance, and taking to thy&s;elf vile Per&s;ons like unto thy&s;elf, thou rai&s;ed&s;t a Sedition in the City, and ca&s;ting Terror into the People, thou did'&s;t, with vi|olent Hands, fall upon the Synagogues of thy Brethren, cau&s;ing much &s;poil.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> for in this thou wer't guilty of Trea&s;on, and oughte&s;t to have been car|ry'd out of the City, and to have been &s;ton'd with Stones unto the Death; Howbeit, the Ruler of thy People &s;hewed thee Mercy, and even extended her &s;aid Mercy to tho&s;e, who having been drawn in by thee to com|mit Violence, were laid hold of by the Sol|diers, and who having de&s;erved to die, were &s;pared, that innocent Blood might not lie
<PB N="7" REF="6">
upon thee; for verily, had the Righteous Sentence of Death, whereto they were brought by the Laws of the Land, been Executed, and they had been put to Death, their Blood had been upon thy Head, and thou had'&s;t been the Cau&s;e thereof; for thou wa&s;t the Rai&s;er of the &s;aid Sedition; having by fal&s;e Speeches per&s;waded the People that thou had'&s;t been a ju&s;t Man, and thou were't fallen upon, being Guiltle&s;s; and not only &s;o, but that the Nobles and Elders of the Land had taken Council again&s;t the Temple of the Lord; all which Things were devi&s;ed in thine own Heart, being nothing &s;o in Truth; neither had they taken Council for Evil, but for Good, to puni&s;h thee according to thy Ways, and to prevent the re&s;t of thy Tribe from teach|ing Sedition among the People.</P>
<P>But this was not all; for thy Pride and the Naughtine&s;s of thy Heart hath cau&s;ed thee to commit greater Wickedne&s;&s;es than tho&s;e; for thou wente&s;t through the Cities of the Land, teaching that Men &s;hould &s;trive, and do wickedly one towards ano|ther; and that they &s;hould oppre&s;s thy Brethren thereby, filling Men's Minds with Evil again&s;t their Neighbours; divi|ding Men again&s;t them&s;elves; the Father again&s;t the Children, and the Children again&s;t the Father, throughout the whole
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Land of thy Nativity, from <HI>Dan</HI> even unto <HI>Beer&s;heba;</HI> Preaching that all &s;uch were Enemies unto the Lord, who were not for running with thee <HI>into the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Riot;</HI> by which means thou deceived'&s;t much People, gathering to thy&s;elf Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> in every City, following thee, and crying <HI>Ho&s;annah,</HI> and &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ed is he who cometh in the Name <HI>of the Church;</HI> whereas plainly, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou knowe&s;t that thou came&s;t in the Name of <HI>Sathan,</HI> and no other, being acted by the unclean Spi|rit of Rage, Malice, Per&s;ecution, Pride and Envy, which is of the Devil, and tend|eth to De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Moreover, thou art taxed with Subtilty and Equivocation, delivering thy&s;elf in de|ceitful Words, that thy People might be deceived thereby; &s;peaking Sentences of doubtful Interpretation, that &s;o thou may'&s;t re&s;erve the Meaning thereof, as might be&s;t &s;erve thy wicked Purpo&s;es: For thou deny|e&s;t that the People called <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are To|lerated by Law, to u&s;e their own Way of Wor&s;hip, and wilt have it only, that they are protected from Violence; &s;o that the&s;e Laws which have obtained the Name of Tolerations, are called by thee Exempti|ons only, from the Penalties of certain other Laws.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
Neverthele&s;s thou ha&s;t not &s;topped here; for whereas thou ha&s;t acknowledg'd that the &s;aid <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are exempted from Pu|ni&s;hment for the Sake of their Separations, yet in the &s;ame Talk of thine, thou excite&s;t to Puni&s;hments again&s;t them, cloathing thy Per&s;ecuting Spirit with the new fram'd Title of, whole&s;ome Severities: Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> for in this thou ha&s;t dealt deceitfully with thy Brethren, and ha&s;t &s;hewn that thou art of the Bloody and Deceitful Men, who the Word &s;aith, &s;hall not live out half their Days.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Henry,</HI> I am well a&s;&s;ur'd that thou ha&s;t been an Old Offender again&s;t the Land of thy Nativity, and ha&s;t &s;hewn thy&s;elf an Enemy to tho&s;e who have &s;ought the Peace of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and ha&s;t laid a Confederacy with tho&s;e who have &s;triken Hands with the STRANGER; nei|ther am I of the Number of tho&s;e who bear fal&s;e Witne&s;s; for that divers of thy Bre|thren te&s;tifie again&s;t thee, that thou u&s;ed'&s;t in thy Cups, and when thou ha&s;t drunken over-much Wine, as too frequently thou do&s;t, <HI>Henry,</HI> I &s;ay unto thee, thou u&s;ed'&s;t in thy Cups, according to the Pro|phane U&s;age of the&s;e Times, of drinking Healths, to drink a Health to the STRANGER, and with expre&s;&s;ing plainly, that thou owned'&s;t him to be thy King.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
And le&s;t thou &s;houlde&s;t be tempted to gain&s;ay this thing, I give thee to under&s;tand, that there is, at the City call'd <HI>Canterbury,</HI> a Per&s;on of good Name, and a Lover of the Truth, who is called <HI>D. B.....</HI> who affirmeth, and offereth thee, by me, <HI>Henry,</HI> to affirm it to thy Face, &s;aying, <HI>That he hath &s;een thee kneel on thy Knees, and drink to the Health,</HI> as thou calle&s;t it, <HI>of the &s;aid STRANGER, calling him by the Title and Name of King</HI> James III. which if thou ha&s;t done, thou art more accur&s;ed than any that have been before thee; fora&s;much as thou had'&s;t, before that, &s;olemnly, after the manner of Men, Abjur'd and For&s;worn the Per&s;on, or Titles, of the &s;aid <HI>Stranger,</HI> &s;aying, that he was no other than a Pretend|er, and that he ought not to &s;it on the Throne; and that thou did'&s;t thereby Be|nounce and Reject him from thy Heart, freely and voluntarily, &s;aying, That thou wilt not have this <HI>Man to Reign over thee:</HI> How abominable this Dealing is, thou well knowe&s;t, <HI>Henry;</HI> and that they who do the&s;e Things, are worthy of Death, fora&s;much as the Laws of the Land have driven out this Per&s;on from among us, and that he is deemed a Stranger from hence|forth for ever.</P>
<P>How thou an&s;were&s;t, <HI>Henry,</HI> to thy Con&s;cience, and to the Light of Heaven &s;hining within thy Spirit, that in Verity,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
I know not; but I give thee to under&s;tand, that if thou can'&s;t not try and acquit thy|&s;elf at that Bar, neither wilt thou be ac|quitted before thy Father which is in Hea|ven, but thou wilt have thy Reward with them, <HI>in who&s;e Company thou wa&s;t willing to have left the</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Devil and his Angels.</NOTE> Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>And what can'&s;t thou &s;ay, O Man, to the&s;e Things? I hear that thou hard'ne&s;t thy Face again&s;t the Truth, &s;aying, <HI>That the&s;e Things are not &s;o:</HI> But verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou ha&s;t &s;triven in vain to wa&s;h thy Hands, for thou art guilty; neither is there wanting tho&s;e, <HI>who bear witne&s;s again&s;t thee in the Gates.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e thy Follies reprove thee, and thou ha&s;t been guilty of much Wickedne&s;s in former Times: Fora&s;much as in the Town of <HI>Birmingham,</HI> thou did'&s;t frequent|ly u&s;e Cur&s;ings with Bitterne&s;s of Spirit, again&s;t the King who ruled at that Time, and who&s;e Name was <HI>William,</HI> &s;aying, that thou de&s;ired'&s;t he &s;hould be torn in Pieces of the People, and likewi&s;e that thou did'&s;t hope to &s;ee it with thine Eyes: Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> this was a Wickedne&s;s to be puni&s;h'd by the Judge, and thou de&s;er|ved'&s;t to have the &s;ame Thing done unto thee, that thou woulde&s;t &s;hould be done
<PB N="12" REF="11">
unto the Ruler of thy People; for a &s;much as by the Laws of this our Land, who&s;o|ever devi&s;eth Evil <HI>again&s;t the King, is wor|thy of Death.</HI></P>
<P>Verily it &s;eemeth, that thou ha&s;t delight|ed much in moving the People of the Land unto Sedition, and to rai&s;e Tumults again&s;t their Rulers; &s;eeing thou woulde&s;t in tho&s;e Days, have had the People laid violent Hands on the King, and that &s;ince that, thou ha&s;t moved Sedition divers Times among the People, and ha&s;t led them wick|edly to demoli&s;h the Hou&s;es of thy Brethren, and to walk Di&s;orderly in the Streets: Nei|ther, <HI>Henry,</HI> wa&s;t thou willing that they &s;hould end there, but that they &s;hould have proceeded, even unto the &s;hedding of Blood.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Henry,</HI> I am moved to tell thee, that thou art mani&s;e&s;tly pu&s;hing the People of this Land upon the &s;ame unlawful Do|ings, and Exhorting them to lift up their Hands again&s;t the King, u&s;ing the Pretence of their Zeal for thy Church; in&s;inuating wicked Things into their Thoughts, &s;aying, <HI>Behold, the Church is in Danger,</HI> of which I mu&s;t commune with thee a &s;hort while.</P>
<P>Plainly, <HI>Henry,</HI> it appeareth unto me &s;omething &s;trange, that thou, who art guilty of the&s;e Hainous Things, can'&s;t teach, That Men <HI>&s;hould not murther Kings;</HI> neither
<PB N="13" REF="12">
can'&s;t thou &s;peak on the 30<HI>th</HI> Day of the Fir&s;t Month, again&s;t killing the Anointed of the Lord; for a &s;much as thou did'&s;t open|ly profe&s;s thy de&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>William our King,</HI> a ju&s;t Man, and upright, torn in pieces by the Hands of violent Men: There are among the People, <HI>Henry,</HI> who &s;ay, that in &s;peaking tho&s;e Words thou art veri|ly Guilty of killing the King thy &s;elf, ina&s;|much as to de&s;ire to commit a Sin, if Pow|er to do it were to be obtain'd, is equiva|lent in Guilt, to the Fact it&s;elf, if there ap|pears to be a fixed Re&s;olution to perform the &s;ame. Wherefore, <HI>Henry,</HI> I ad|moni&s;h thee that thou refrain from all Com|plaints of the Actions of Evil Men again&s;t their Kings in Ancient Times, for a &s;much as thou approve&s;t of Actions, who&s;e Ten|dency is the &s;ame: And for a &s;much as eve|ry Tumult and Sedition rai&s;ed again&s;t the King, is a bringing him to the Block, in its degree, as it te&s;tifies what would be, if Power, &s;uitable to the Wrath of Evil Men were &s;upply'd, and if they were not re|&s;trained from falling upon their King by &s;ome good Spirit within them, oppo&s;ing their perver&s;e De&s;igns: Seeing then thou did &s;t declare thy De&s;ire to &s;ee the &s;aid <HI>William</HI> the King, at that time put to Death, and that even by the Hands of violent and tumultuous Men, not by the
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Proce&s;s of the Laws; thy Confidence, is marvellous great, who can&s;t con|demn the Actions of thy Fathers, <HI>(for it &s;eemeth thou art thy &s;elf of that Race,)</HI> for put|ting the King of the Land to Death: Verily thou, herein by thy Actions, approve&s;t what thou al&s;o condemne&s;t in Words.</P>
<P>To what Purpo&s;e then, are thy Teach|ings and thy loud Railings, &s;eeing thou art in this Thing a double Dealer? Thou that teache&s;t Men &s;hould not kill Kings; Do&s;t thou tear Kings in Pieces by the Tumults of the People? For &s;aying that thou de&s;ire&s;t to have it &s;o, and hope&s;t to &s;ee it, is no le&s;s than doing it, in the Judg|ment of Truth.</P>
<P>Peradventure, <HI>Henry,</HI> Satan may tempt thee to deny the Truth, &s;aying, that thou did'&s;t not utter &s;uch Words concerning the King, as I lay unto thy Charge, but le&s;t thou &s;hould'&s;t thus tran&s;gre&s;s, adding one Sin unto another, thou may'&s;t under&s;tand that thou can'&s;t not cover thy Offence in &s;uch a Manner, fora&s;much as there are up|right Men who have given their Affirma|tion that thou did'&s;t verily &s;peak with thy Tongue tho&s;e Words of Wickedne&s;s, a|gain&s;t the afore&s;aid <HI>William,</HI> even at the Time when he was <HI>thy King,</HI> and I have been help'd to a Copy thereof, that thou may'&s;t be convinc'd and may'&s;t not gain&s;ay
<PB N="15" REF="14">
the Truth; and albeit, <HI>Henry,</HI> that Friends do not approve of the Way which Men take to confirm Things in the World <HI>(viz.)</HI> By &s;wearing an Oath; yet will I not &s;ay, that the Things whereunto they do &s;wear are therefore not to be believ'd; but were it &s;o, that Friends give no more than ordi|nary Belief to the Things to which the Cu&s;tom of Men hath annex'd an Oath; yet to thee <HI>Henry,</HI> with whom the&s;e Things are held to be &s;acred, an Oath for Confir|mation is to thee, the End of all Strife; nei|ther may'&s;t thou be allowed to di&s;pute any farther, after a Man who is reputed Ju&s;t, and is not of Evil Fame, <HI>like thee,</HI> has an|nexed an Oath to the Thing which he hath &s;aid.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e Things, I here lay before thy Eyes the Oath made a|gain&s;t thee by a Ju&s;t and Good Man, who, Friends &s;ay, would not &s;peak again&s;t the Truth, by which the Wickedne&s;s of thy Heart may be made manife&s;t, and &s;o thou may'&s;t, if the Lord plea&s;e, be brought to Repentance.</P>
<P><HI>[Samuel Eboral]</HI> of <HI>Birmingham,</HI> in the County of Warwick, <HI>maketh Oath,</HI> that a|bout twelve or thirteen Years ago, as near as this Deponent can remember, he was in compa|ny with Dr. <HI>Henry Sacheverel,</HI> together with one <HI>William Daggett,</HI> Clerk, and <HI>Henry</HI>

<HI>Porter,</HI> Mercer, Father in Law to this Depo|nent, and &s;ome others, at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>John Hopkins,</HI> an Ironmonger in Birming|ham, where he heard the &s;aid <HI>Henry Sacheve|rel</HI> &s;peak the following Words, or Words to this Effect, <HI>(viz.) I don't doubt but that I &s;hall live to &s;ee King</HI> William <HI>De-witted, and I hope in God I &s;hall.</HI> &V;pon the &s;peaking of which Words the &s;aid <HI>William Daggett</HI> then &s;harply reprov'd the &s;aid <HI>Henry Sacheverel.</HI></P>

<P>After the&s;e Things being te&s;tify'd again&s;t thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> I advi&s;e and admoni&s;h thee, that thou would'&s;t no more &s;peak again&s;t tho&s;e who hold it lawful to put Tyrants to Death, whether Kings or Rulers of a lower Degree, <HI>for out of thy own Mouth &s;halt thou be judged,</HI> in that thou ha&s;t thus openly condemn'd a ju&s;t Ruler to be mur|ther'd by the Hands of the lowe&s;t of the People, <HI>to wit,</HI> by the Rabble.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e Friend <HI>Henry,</HI> I admoni&s;h thee that thou bee&s;t not in a Pa&s;&s;ion, neither &s;uffere&s;t thy Wrath to wax hot again&s;t tho&s;e Men who may greet thee with the Name of <HI>Jacobite,</HI> which as I under&s;tand

is given unto &s;uch as are Ill-Willers to the Government of the Land, as it was &s;ettled by wi&s;e Men, in the Days of <HI>William</HI> the King, and on the Foundation whereof the Man <HI>George</HI> is now receiv'd as King among the People; a&s;&s;uredly, <HI>Henry,</HI> thy own Mind bears Witne&s;s to thee, and the Spirit that is within thee knoweth that thou hate&s;t the King, and that thou ha&s;t given thy &s;elf up unto <HI>The Stranger</HI> whom the Lord abhorreth. And how cometh it to pa&s;s that thou who calle&s;t thy &s;elf a Prophet of the Lord, can&s;t thus counterfeit with the People? Thinke&s;t thou that he who knoweth thy Heart, &s;ees not thy Hypo|cri&s;y, and knoweth not that thou ha&s;t lifted up thy Hand to him in Wickedne&s;s, and call'd him to Witne&s;s to thy Perjury, when thou abjure&s;t the Stranger whom thy Soul loveth, and ha&s;t &s;worn fealty unto him whom thou cur&s;ed'&s;t with thy Lips?</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> the&s;e are Things which even wicked Men abhor, and none but he that is viler than the Vile&s;t can away with them; for the&s;e Things hath the Lord made thee <HI>a Hi&s;&s;ing</HI> and <HI>a By Word</HI> among the People of the Land, and thy Name will be a Cur&s;e unto all Generations; and it &s;hall be hereafter, that when one Man &s;hall cur&s;e another, he &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>The Lord make thee as Sacheverel, whom the People of the Land abhorr'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
The&s;e Things are &s;aid unto thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> concerning Things pa&s;t; It behoveth me to commune with thee likewi&s;e of Things to come, and of thy pre&s;ent Behaviour, in which thou de&s;erve&s;t much Rebuke, for that thou ha&s;t taught the People to do wickedly, and ha&s;t endeavour'd to rai&s;e Sedition, &s;aying, that thy Church is in Danger. It &s;eemeth &s;trange to me, who am not of thy Church, what Danger thou can&s;t think thy Church is in from the King, who hath not only given thee and the Peo|ple of the Land all the A&s;&s;urances of his In|clination to pre&s;erve it, &s;aying, that he will on all Occa&s;ions &s;tudy the Security thereof, but ha&s;t entred into the Commu|nion, as thou calle&s;t it, of thy Church, and hath thereby made it his own Church, and made him&s;elf a Branch thereof, &s;o that to wound the Intere&s;t of the &s;aid Church, is now to wound him&s;elf, and to hurt his own Intere&s;t; &s;eeing it is apparent unto me, <HI>Henry,</HI> that the Church of this Land and the King of this Land hath, at this Time but one Intere&s;t; neither can they be &s;eparated by any Means what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Henry,</HI> I would enquire of thee what thou thinke&s;t of the Churches or A&s;&s;emblys of tho&s;e People abroad, who are vulgarly call'd Prote&s;tants, and where|fore thou &s;eeme&s;t to think that they are all
<PB N="19" REF="18">
of them dangerous to thy Church? Is thy Church afraid of all the Prote&s;tant Churches of the World? Verily, thou art unju&s;tly dealing with thy Church; neither is there any Rea&s;on to fear, that a Prote&s;tant King can be dangerous to thy Church, of what|&s;oever Kind or Sect of Prote&s;tant he &s;hall be, &s;eeing there are none who can make any Advantage unto them&s;elves by it; and thou knowe&s;t, <HI>Henry,</HI> that where there is no Advantage accruing to Men, they are not zealous in bringing Things to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>It hath been objected by thy Fellows in troubling the People, that the Care of the King in pre&s;erving the Church is but &s;mall, becau&s;e of his being a <HI>Lutheran;</HI> thou wilt cau&s;e the People to laugh thee to Scorn, &s;hould&s;t thou per&s;i&s;t herein; for thou can&s;t not be &s;o fooli&s;h to &s;ay, that the King can have Thoughts of making the People of the Land turn <HI>Lutherans;</HI> and why then &s;hould not the King be as zealous for thy Church as for any other? Neither ha&s;t thou yet been able to &s;ignify to thy People what Church, or what Religion thy Church is in Danger from: It &s;eemeth plain unto me that thou art not afraid of the Popi&s;h Church, as it is call'd, neither can&s;t thou alledge that the Land of thy Nativity is in Danger of Popery, while the King who is on the Throne liveth.</P>

True it is, <HI>Henry,</HI> and Woe unto thee therefore, that while the Expectation of <HI>the Stranger</HI> was among the People, and his Intere&s;t &s;eem'd too much to prevail, there might be &s;ome Rea&s;on to think of the Evil Days of Per&s;ecution, and of the Ruin, not of thy Church only, but of all the Lord's People in this Land, on that Ac|count: But alas for thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou wert quiet and Peaceable under all that could be &s;aid thereof; neither could the Danger of Idolatry and Super&s;tition make thee afraid, but thou rejoyced in Hope of <HI>the Stran|ger,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>all &s;hould be well,</HI> and that thy Church would <HI>not</HI> be <HI>in Danger,</HI> altho' the Man were to &s;it on the Throne who ab|hor'd her with his whole Heart.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things, <HI>Henry,</HI> di&s;cover the Naughtyne&s;s of thy Heart and thy great Hypocri&s;y; for as much as thou ha&s;t been willing to expo&s;e thy Church to the Dan|ger of an open and proclaimed Enemy, made &s;o not by Education and Principle only, but provoked to be &s;o by that which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the greate&s;t Injury to him, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Bani&s;hing, Attainting, and Abjure|ing him, by which all his Pa&s;&s;ions are en|gag'd to revenge his Wrongs as well as his Religion, upon thy Church; and where then is thy Zeal for thy Church, when thou could'&s;t re&s;t &s;atisfy'd under the&s;e Things, whereas under a Per&s;on differing in no|thing

from thy Church, but joyning with $word$ in every Part of thy Wor&s;hip, thou art affrighting thy People with much A|mazement about thy Church?</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> it &s;eems doubtful unto many, what it is thou meane&s;t when thou &s;peake&s;t of thy Church, and whether the Church, as they call it, to which <HI>the Stran|ger</HI> belongeth, is not &s;ecretly e&s;pou&s;edby thee, as <HI>thy Church;</HI> for it is difficult to comprehend many of thy Actions, with|out &s;u&s;pecting thee of Principles, which the Church, thou &s;aye&s;t thou art of, ab|hors; of which I may give thee this one Example taken from thy &s;elf, and thy late Behaviour among the People, <HI>to wit,</HI> that of Rebellion.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> thy Voice is not like the Voice of tho&s;e who have &s;poken in the A&s;&s;embly of the Princes, that they believ'd the Doctrine of unlimited Obedience, and that they were Children of the Tribe of <HI>I&s;&s;achar:</HI> Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> for I wot that in the room of pa&s;&s;ive Submi&s;&s;ions and Obe|dience to the King, thou art among the Sons of <HI>Belial,</HI> who <HI>Cur&s;e the King in their Bed-Chambers,</HI> and thou opene&s;t thy Mouth again&s;t thy Rulers, even in the High Places of the City.</P>
<P>Thinke&s;t thou, that the&s;e Things can be done in the Land, and the People &s;hall not be offended at thee? Nay, it maketh thee

to &s;tink in the No&s;trils of the People, and thou art abhorr'd of tho&s;e who love the Pro&s;perity of the Land.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, I coun&s;el thee to call to Mind how in the&s;e Things thou art an Enemy, even to that Church which thou call'&s;t <HI>thy Mother,</HI> and which if thou did'&s;t indeed believe to be thy <HI>Spiritual Mother,</HI> thou would'&s;t have more concern for than to ex|po&s;e in &s;o unrighteous and ungodly a Man|ner; for thou art, <HI>as much as in thee lies,</HI> drawing thy &s;aid <HI>Spiritual Mother</HI> into di|vers Snares, Mi&s;cheifs, and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;uch as mi&s;taking her Friends and faithful Protectors, for her Enemies and Betrayers; and on the other Hand, embracing her Enemies as her Friends and Protectors; and were it not that I can prophe&s;y to thee from the Lord, that thou wilt mi&s;carry in this thy wicked De&s;ign, I &s;hould&punc; inlarge on the Evil Con&s;equences thereof to the &s;aid Church her &s;elf, as well as to the whole Land. But be thou a&s;&s;ured, <HI>Henry,</HI> thou &s;halt not prevail, but thou &s;halt &s;ee that Mother of thine, as thou fal&s;ly call'&s;t her, di&s;own and di&s;card thee as a &s;purious Child, impos'd upon her like <HI>the Stranger,</HI> and as one whom &s;he having nouri&s;hed in her Bo|&s;om, has hi&s;s'd at her who has done thee good, and would'&s;t have deliver'd her up to the Ravi&s;her to be oppre&s;s'd and de|&s;troy'd;
<PB N="23" REF="22">
this thou may'&s;t be a&s;&s;ured will be thy Portion, unle&s;s thou repent.</P>
<P>Thou art in the mean Time, farther expo|&s;ed in thy Wickedne&s;s; for that thou who ha&s;t boa&s;ted &s;o much in old Time of thy great Loyalty#can'&s;t now behave thy &s;elf towards the Rulers, in a manner indecent for thee, as thou art a Teacher; for thou art Di&s;|obedient, Unquiet and Unpeaceable under the King, who hath, as yet given thee no Offence, neither hath he done thee any Wrong: In this I mu&s;t Rebuke thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> and all tho&s;e who cleave unto thee, for wherein hath the King done Evil unto thee, and what hath he yet done again&s;t thy Church, that thou revile&s;t him, SAYING <HI>he will overthrow the Church:</HI> Verily this is rendering Evil for Good unto the King, and is a Wickedne&s;s in thee which de&s;erves Rebuke.</P>
<P>Neither is this all; but I am moved in Spirit to &s;ay unto thee, That the Rea&s;on of thy Di&s;contents is naked and open to all thy Neighbours; even becau&s;e thy Com|panions, and tho&s;e with whom thou art Confederated, are di&s;placed, and are not entred into the Number of the King's Worthies; therefore art thou Wrath, and ca&s;te&s;t Du&s;t into the Air, with thy Voice &s;aying, That Wickedne&s;s reigneth, and that Righteou&s;ne&s;s is trodden under Foot:
<PB N="24" REF="23">
In this it appeareth that thou regarde&s;t not the Truth, but art moved with Envy, Pride and Partiality; otherwi&s;e if Ju&s;t and Upright Men are cho&s;en by the King to be his Coun&s;ellors, and his Captains of Thou&s;ands, to lead forth his Armies, and to go in and out before the People, it would &s;atisfie thee in behalf of thy Land, albeit the Men whom thou art joyned un|to, were not of that Number. But thy Di&s;content appears manife&s;tly to be be|cau&s;e the evil Men, with whom thou ha&s;t &s;tricken Hands, are di&s;liked by the King, which is unju&s;t in thee to thy Lord the King. For verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> this Matter is of the Lord, neither has the King turned to the Right-Hand, or to the Left, but as he hath been guided by the Voice of the People of the Land; for as to the Stranger, whom thou wor&s;hipe&s;t, thou &s;ee&s;t the Land hath &s;pued him out, and all tho&s;e who went a Whoring after him are ca&s;t out out with him. Verily this is of God, and who art thou, that thou &s;houlde&s;t lift up thy Hand again&s;t the Lord!</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Henry,</HI> it becometh thee to explain thy &s;elf, and to tell thy Brethren what thou meane&s;t, if there be ought of Meaning in thy Ways, by &s;aying thy Church is in Danger from the Men whom the King hath cho&s;en for his Servants in the

Government of thy Land; &s;eeing they are pre&s;cribed in all their Doings by the Laws of the Land, neither can they turn to the Right-Hand, nor to the Left, but as they are permitted to do &s;o by the Judgments and Statutes of the Kings: And if at any time they tran&s;gre&s;s the &s;aid Judgments and Statutes, thou maye&s;t bring them be|fore the Ruler, and cau&s;e them to be Judg|ed in the Gate; and that if Sentence pa&s;s again&s;t them by the Judges, thou knowe&s;t that even the King him&s;elf, cannot &s;ave them from thy Hand, but all the Congregation may Stone them with Stones until they die; fora&s;much as it is not in the Power of the King to Pardon &s;uch Crimes of which evil Men &s;hall be accu&s;ed by the A&s;&s;embly of the Princes, and the Elders of the Land.</P>
<P>It &s;eemeth then, <HI>Henry,</HI> that the&s;e Men cannot act again&s;t the Church, becau&s;e they cannot act again&s;t the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties of the &s;aid Church, as well as of the People, are &s;ettled on the Foundations of the Laws, and cannot be Invaded unle&s;s the &s;aid Laws are fir&s;t bro|ken and overthrown; which as I have &s;aid unto thee, cannot be done by the&s;e Men.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Henry,</HI> even the King him&s;elf is re&s;trained in Ruling the People of the Land, and is limited to do the &s;ame according

And how &s;aye&s;t thou, O vain Man, that <HI>the Church is in Danger?</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Henry,</HI> I enquire of thee how it cometh to pa&s;s, that all tho&s;e who who are Cho&s;en by the King, to be his Servants, are deemed by thee to be Enemies to the Church? It appeareth unto me that they are them&s;elves part of the Body which thou calle&s;t the Church; and if they are the &s;ame Body, and thou thus divide&s;t thy&s;elf from them, then art thou an Enemy to the Church likewi&s;e; fora&s;|much as dividing the Church again&s;t it&s;elf, is Fatal: For how can the Church, any more than the Kingdom, &s;tand which is divided again&s;t it&s;elf? Believe me, <HI>Henry,</HI> it will not be ea&s;ie to the Generations to come, to know whether thou and thy

Party have not been the greate&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;chievous Enemies of thy own Church. Veril, there will be much Rea&s;on to judge that it is &s;o; fora&s;much as thy Ways which are wicked and unrighteous, have thereby a tendency to the de&s;troying Religion from among the Nations of the Earth.</P>
<P>And how cometh it to pa&s;s that thou woulde&s;t be e&s;teemed a Man zealous for the Church, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not been wanting to acquaint the People, who are about thee, that thou feare&s;t not God, but that thou runne&s;t out into exce&s;s of Riot, with all Prophane&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s, and want of Sobriety in thy Conver&s;ation? Thinke&s;t thou that any of tho&s;e, who behold thy walking in unclean Ways, and &s;elling thy &s;elf to do Wickedly, will believe that thou ha&s;t any true Concern for the Church? I am moved in Spirit again&s;t thee, <HI>Henry,</HI> to declare to thee, in the Name of the Lord, That when evil Men cry, the <HI>Temple of the Lord,</HI> the <HI>Temple of the Lord,</HI> it is manife&s;t that Wickedne&s;s is in their Hands, and they are &s;et upon Violence in the Land.</P>
<P>And know thou for certain, That where|as thou and thy Friends make an Hypocri|tical Shew of Zeal for the Church, there|by to deceive and mi&s;guide &s;imple Ones, the Church her&s;elf will ca&s;t thee and them out, as her mo&s;t dangerous Enemies; and

will abhor thee, for that &s;he &s;ees her&s;elf in a &s;afer Condition by far, than when thou rai&s;e&s;t the People of the Land into a Sedi|tion on Pretence of defending her.</P>
<P>I have hear'd that thou and many of thy Tribe, have made deep Wounds in the Body of her whom thou call'&s;t thy Mother, and for whom thou make&s;t much Stir, by the evil Examples &s;hewn to the People; and verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay un|to thee, That the true Danger of thy Church, and perhaps I might &s;ay, the only real Danger of thy Church is from the vitious and reproachful Lives of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the Clergy, or the Teachers of the People.</P>
<P>And verily, <HI>Henry,</HI> this leadeth me to put thee in Mind of a very known Evil, and to &s;earch after the Rea&s;on thereof; to wit, That almo&s;t all the under Teachers of thy Church, the Clergy as thou calle&s;t them, who are of the inferiour Rank, are Enemies to the King upon the Throne. Is it not becau&s;e the Liberties of thy Coun|try are re&s;tored by him, and the Hearts of the People of the Land are made glad; therefore thinke&s;t thou, <HI>Henry,</HI> that thy Brethren, the Sons of <HI>Levt,</HI> do not bring upon them&s;elves a Blot; and become there|by a Scorn, and a By-Word among the People, &s;eeing they are alone Sad, when

<P>And now, <HI>Henry,</HI> I am moved to ask a Que&s;tion of thee, which if thou wilt An|&s;wer with Sincerity, may do thee much good: The bringing in of the King, who is called <HI>George, is of God,</HI> Henry, or <HI>is of Man only?</HI> If thou &s;aye&s;t it is of Men only, why doe&s;t thou, and mo&s;t of thy Tribe acknowledge him, and lift up thy Hands to &s;wear unto the Lord that thou owne&s;t him to be the Lord's Anointed? Again, <HI>Henry,</HI> If thou &s;aye&s;t <HI>it is of God,</HI> why then do&s;t thou not be glad and Rejoice therein, as the re&s;t of the People of the Land al&s;o do?

<P>Finally, <HI>Henry,</HI> I admoni&s;h thee to con|&s;ider thy Evil Ways in Time&punc; and I Coun|&s;el thee to acknowldge thy Offences, le&s;t, thou come to Shame; for verily, thy Ways <HI>are Ways of Death, and thy Steps lead towards De&s;truction:</HI> Beware how thou act with Evil Men, and

<P>Neither can'&s;t thou think to e&s;cape the Ju&s;tice of thy Country, whom thou ha&s;t &s;o many Ways offended; the People of the Land whom thou ha&s;t abu&s;ed and deceived, will certainly Stone thee with Stones; for|a&s;much as thou ha&s;t kindled Strife among them with vain Words, &s;aying; <HI>Hate ye one another, Per&s;ecute ye one another, and bear fal&s;e Witne&s;s again&s;t one another;</HI> Thinke&s;t thou not, <HI>O Son of Belial,</HI> that the People of the Land, when they &s;hall come to &s;peak Peace to each other, not|with&s;tanding thy kindling a Fire of Strife a|mong them, will not abhorr thee, and fall upon thee, &s;aying, thou art not fit to abide among them.</P>
