<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is not unnatural to imagine that, on the fir&s;t Glance of your Eye over the Adver|ti&s;ement of a new Pamphlet, addre&s;&s;ed to your&s;elf, you are apt to feel &s;ome little Emotion; that you be&s;tow more than ordinary At|tention on the Title, as it &s;tands in the News-Paper, and take Notice of the Name of the Publi&s;her.&mdash;Is it Compliment or Abu&s;e?&mdash;One of the&s;e being deter|mined, you are perhaps eager to be &s;atisfied, whether &s;ome coar&s;e Hand has laid on Encomiums with a Trowel, or &s;ome more elegant Writer, (&s;uch as the Author of <HI>the Actor</HI> for In&s;tance) has done Credit to him&s;elf and you by his Panegyrick; or, on the other Hand, whether any offended Genius has employed tho&s;e Talents again&s;t You, which he is ambitious of
<PB N="2" REF="5">
exerci&s;ing in the Service of your Theatre; or &s;ome common Scribe has taken your Character, as he would that of any other Man or Woman, or Mini&s;|ter, or the King, if he dur&s;t, as a popular Topick of Scandal.</P>
<P>Be not alarmed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; nor, with that Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own Merit, &s;o natural to the Celebrated and Eminent, indulge your&s;elf in an Acquie&s;cence with the Ju&s;tice of ten thou&s;and fine Things, which you may &s;uppo&s;e ready to be &s;aid to you. No private Satire or Panegyrick, but the ge|neral Good of the Republick of Letters, and of the Drama in particular, is intended. Though Prai&s;e and Di&s;prai&s;e &s;tand ready on each Side, like the Ve&s;|&s;els of Good and Evil on the Right and Left Hand of <HI>Jupiter</HI>, I do not mean to dip into either: Or, if I do, it &s;hall be, like the Pagan Godhead him&s;elf, to mingle a due Proportion of each. Sometimes, perhaps, I may find Fault, and &s;ometimes be&s;tow Commendation: But you mu&s;t not expect to hear of the Quickne&s;s of your Conception, the Ju&s;tice of your Execution, the Expre&s;&s;ion of your Eye, the Harmony of your Voice, or the Variety and Excel|lence of your Deportment; nor &s;hall you be mali|ciou&s;ly informed that you are &s;horter than <HI>Barry</HI>, leaner than <HI>Quin</HI>, and le&s;s a Favourite of the Upper Gallery than <HI>Woodward</HI> or <HI>Shuter</HI>.</P>
<P>The following Pages are de&s;tined to contain a Vindication of the Works of <HI>Ma&s;&s;inger</HI>; one of our old dramatick Writers, who very &s;eldom falls much beneath <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t ri&s;es to a proud Rival&s;hip of his chiefe&s;t Excellencies. They are meant too as a laudable, though faint, Attempt to re&s;cue the&s;e admirable Pieces from the too general Neglect, which they now labour under, and to recommend them to the Notice of the Pub|lick. To whom then can &s;uch an E&s;&s;ay be more properly in&s;cribed than to you, whom that Publick &s;eems to have appointed, as its chief <HI>Arbiter Deli|ciarum</HI>,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
to pre&s;ide over the Amu&s;ements of the The|atre?&mdash;But there is al&s;o, by the bye, a private Rea|&s;on for addre&s;&s;ing you. Your hone&s;t Friend <HI>Davies</HI>, who, as is &s;aid of the provident Comedians in <HI>Holland</HI>, &s;pends his Hours of Vacation from the Theatre in his Shop, is too well acquainted with the Efficacy of your Name at the Top of a Play-Bill, to omit an Opportunity of prefixing it to a new Publication; hoping it may prove a Charm to draw in Purcha&s;ers, like the Head of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> on his Sign. My Let|ter too being anonymous, your Name at the Head, will more than compen&s;ate for the Want of mine at the End of it: And our above-mentioned Friend is, no Doubt, too well ver&s;ed in both his Occupations, nor to know the Con&s;equence of Secrecy in a Book|&s;eller, as well as the Nece&s;&s;ity of concealing from the Publick many Things that pa&s;s <HI>behind the Curtain</HI>.</P>
<P>There is perhaps no Country in the World more &s;ubordinate to the Power of Fa&s;hion, than our own. Every Whim, every Word, every Vice, every Virtue in its Turn becomes the Mode, and is followed with a certain Rage of Approbation for a Time. The favourite Stile in all the polite Arts, and the reigning Ta&s;te in Letters, are as notoriou&s;ly Objects of Ca|price as Architecture and Dre&s;s. A new Poem, or Novel, or Farce, are as incon&s;iderately extolled or decried as a Ruff or a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Rail, a Hoop or a Bow Window. Hence it happens, that the Publick Ta&s;te is often vitiated: Or if, by Chance, it has made a proper Choice, becomes partially attached to one Species of Excellence, and remains dead to the Sen&s;e of all other Merit, however equal, or &s;uperior.</P>
<P>I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, with a Confidence, that on Reflection it will appear to be true, that the eminent Cla&s;s of Writers, who flouri&s;hed at the Be|ginning of this Century, have almo&s;t entirely &s;uper|&s;eded their illu&s;trious Predece&s;&s;ors. The Works of <HI>Congreve, Vanburgh, Steele, Addi&s;on, Pope, Swift, Gay</HI>, &amp;c. &amp;c. are the chief Study of the Million: I
<PB N="4" REF="7">
&s;ay, of the Million, for as to tho&s;e few, who are not only familiar with all our own Authors, but are al&s;o conver&s;ant with the Antients, they are not to be cir|cum&s;cribed by the narrow Limits of the Fa&s;hion. <HI>Shake|&s;peare</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> &s;eem to &s;tand alone, like fir&s;t-rate Authors, amid the general Wreck of old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Literature. <HI>Milton</HI> perhaps owes much of his pre|&s;ent Fame to the generous Labours and good Ta&s;te of <HI>Addi&s;on. Shake&s;peare</HI> has been tran&s;mitted down to us with &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Glories; and you, Sir, have continued, or rather increa&s;ed, his Reputation. You have, in no ful&s;ome Strain of Compliment, been &s;tiled the Be&s;t Commentator on his Works: But have you not, like other Commentators, con|tracted a narrow, exclu&s;ive, Veneration of your Author? Has not the Contemplation of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>'s Excellencies almo&s;t dazzled and extingui&s;hed your Judgment, when directed to other Objects, and made you blind to the Merit of his Cotemporaries? Under your Dominion, have not <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI>, nay even <HI>Jon&s;on</HI>, &s;uffered a Kind of thea|trical Di&s;grace? And has not poor <HI>Ma&s;&s;inger</HI>, who&s;e Cau&s;e I have now undertaken, been permitted to lan|gui&s;h in Ob&s;curity, and remained almo&s;t entirely unknown?</P>
<P>To this perhaps it may be plau&s;ibly an&s;wered, nor indeed without &s;ome Foundation, that many of our old Plays, though they abound with Beauties, and are rai&s;ed much above the humble Level of later Writers, are yet, on &s;everal Accounts, unfit to be $word$ on the modern Stage; that the Fable, in|&s;$$ad of b$ing rai&s;ed on probable Incidents in real L$fe, is gen$rally built on &s;ome foreign Novel, and $$tended w$th romantick Circum&s;tances; that the Con|d$$t of the&s;e extravagant Stories is frequently un|$outh, and in$$$$tely offen&s;ive to that dramatick Cor|$$$tne&s;s pre&s;cribed by late Criticks, and practi&s;ed, as t$ey pretend, by the <HI>French</HI> Writers; and that the Characters, exhibited in our old Plays, can have no
<PB N="5" REF="8">
plea&s;ing Effect on a modern Audience, as they are &s;o totally different from the Manners of the pre&s;ent Age.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, might once have ap|peared rea&s;onable Objections: But you, Sir, of all Per&s;ons, can urge them with the lea&s;t Grace, &s;ince your Practice has &s;o fully proved their In&s;ufficiency. Your Experience mu&s;t have taught you, that when a Piece has any &s;triking Beauties, they will cover a Multitude of Inaccuracies; and that a Play need not be written on the &s;evere&s;t Plan, to plea&s;e in the Re|pre&s;entation. The Mind is &s;oon familiarized to Ir|regularities, which do not &s;in again&s;t the Truth of Nature, but are merely Violations of that &s;trict De|corum, of late &s;o earne&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted on. What patient Spectators are we of the Incon&s;i&s;tencies that confe&s;|&s;edly prevail in our darling <HI>Shake&s;peare!</HI> What criti|cal Catcall ever proclaimed the Indecency of intro|ducing the Stocks in the Tragedy of <HI>Lear?</HI> How quietly do we &s;ee <HI>Glo&s;ter</HI> take his imaginary Leap from <HI>Dover</HI> Cliff! Or to give a &s;tronger In&s;tance of Patience, with what a philo&s;ophical Calmne&s;s do the Audience do&s;e over the tedious, and unintere&s;ting, Love-Scenes, with which the bungling Hand of <HI>Tate</HI> has coar&s;ely pieced and patched that rich Work of <HI>Shake&s;peare!</HI>&mdash;To in&s;tance further from <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> him&s;elf, the Grave-diggers in <HI>Hamlet</HI> (not to men|tion <HI>Polonius)</HI> are not only endured, but applauded; the very Nur&s;e in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet</HI> is allowed to be Nature; the Tran&s;actions of a whole Hi&s;tory are, without Offence, begun and compleated in le&s;s than three hours; and we are agreeably wafted by the <HI>Chorus</HI>, or oftener without &s;o much Ceremony, from one End of the World to another.</P>
<P>It is very true, that it was the general Practice of our old Writers, to found their Pieces on &s;ome fo|reign Novel; and it &s;eemed to be their chief Aim to take the Story, as it &s;tood, with all its appendant In|cidents of every Complexion, and throw it into
<PB N="6" REF="9">
Scenes. This Method was, to be &s;ure, rather inar|tificial, as it at once overloaded and embarra&s;&s;ed the Fable, leaving it de&s;titute of that beautiful dramatick Connection, which enables the Mind to take in all its Circum&s;tances with Facility and Delight. But I am &s;till in Doubt, whether many Writers, who come nearer to our own Times, have much mended the Matter. What with their Plots, and Double-Plots, and Counter-plots, and Under-Plots, the Mind is as much perplexed to piece out the Story, as to put to|gether the disjointed Parts of our ancient Drama. The Comedies of <HI>Congreve</HI> have, in my Mind, as little to boa&s;t of Accuracy in their Con&s;truction, as the Plays of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>; nay, perhaps, it might be proved that, amid&s;t the mo&s;t open Violation of the le&s;&s;er critical Unities, one Point is more &s;teadily per|&s;ued, one Character more uniformly &s;hewn, and one grand Purpo&s;e of the Fable more evidently accom|pli&s;hed in the Productions of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> than of <HI>Congreve</HI>.</P>
<P>The&s;e Fables (it may be further objected) founded on romantick Novels, are unpardonably wild and ex|travagant in their Circum&s;tances, and exhibit too little even of the Manners of the Age in which they were written. The Plays too are in them&s;elves a Kind of heterogeneous Compo&s;ition; &s;carce any of them being, &s;trictly &s;peaking, Tragedy, Comedy, or even Tragi-Comedy, but rather an indige&s;ted Jumble of every Species thrown together.</P>
<P>This Charge mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be true: But upon Examination it will, perhaps, be found of le&s;s Con&s;equence than is generally imagined. The&s;e Dramatick Tales, for &s;o we may be&s;t &s;tile &s;uch Plays, have often occa&s;ioned much Plea&s;ure to the Reader and Spectator, which could not po&s;&s;ibly have been con|veyed to them by any other Vehicle. Many an in|tere&s;ting Story, which, from the Diver&s;ity of its Cir|cum&s;tances, cannot be regularly reduced either to Tragedy or Comedy, yet abounds with Character,
<PB N="7" REF="10">
and contains &s;everal affecting Situations: And why &s;uch a Story &s;hould lo&s;e its Force, dramatically related and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Repre&s;entation, when it plea&s;es, under the colder Form of a Novel, is difficult to conceive. Experience has proved the Effect of &s;uch Fictions on our Minds; and convinced us, that the Theatre is not that barren Ground, wherein the Plants of Imagination will not flouri&s;h. <HI>The Tempe&s;t, the Mid-&s;ummer Night's Dream, the Merchant of</HI> Venice, <HI>As you like it, Twelfth Night, the Faithful Shepherde&s;s</HI> of <HI>Fletcher</HI>, (with a much longer Li&s;t that might be added from <HI>Shake&s;peare, Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI>, and their Cotemporaries, or immediate Succe&s;&s;ors) have mo&s;t of them, within all our Memories, been ranked among the mo&s;t popular Entertainments of the Stage. Yet none of the&s;e can be denominated Tra|gedy, Comedy, or Tragi-Comedy. The Play Bills, I have ob&s;erved, cautiou&s;ly &s;tile them Plays: And Plays indeed they are, truly &s;uch, if it be the End of Plays to delight and in&s;truct, to captivate at once the Ear, the Eye, and the Mind, by Situations forcibly conceived, and Characters truly delineated.</P>
<P>There is once Circum&s;tance in Dramatick Poetry, which, I think, the cha&s;ti&s;ed Notions of our modern Criticks do not permit them &s;ufficiently to con&s;ider. Dramatick Nature is of a more large and liberal Qua|lity, than they are willing to allow. It does not con&s;i&s;t merely in the Repre&s;entation of Real Charac|ters, Characters acknowledged to abound in common Life; but may be extended al&s;o to the Exhibition of imaginary Beings. To Create, is to be a Poet in|deed; to draw down Beings from another Sphere, and endue them with &s;uitable Pa&s;&s;ions, Affections, Di&s;po&s;itions, allotting them at the &s;ame Time pro|per Employment; to <HI>body forth</HI>, by the Powers of Imagination, <HI>the Forms of Things unknown</HI>, and to <HI>give to airy Nothing a local Habitation and a Name</HI>, &s;urely requires a Genius for the Drama equal, if not &s;uperior, to the Delineation of Per&s;onages in the or|dinary
<PB N="8" REF="11">
Cour&s;e of Nature. <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> in particular is univer&s;ally acknowledged never to have &s;oared &s;o far above the Reach of all other Writers, as in tho&s;e In&s;tances, where he &s;eems purpo&s;ely to have tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the Laws of Critici&s;m. He appears to have di&s;dained to put his free Soul <HI>into Circum&s;cription and Confine</HI>, which denied his extraordinary Talents their full Play, nor gave Scope to the Boundle&s;ne&s;s of his Imagination. His Witches, Gho&s;ts, Fairies, and other imaginary Beings, &s;cattered through his Plays, are &s;o many glaring Violations of the common Table of Dramatick Laws. What then &s;hall we &s;ay? Shall we confe&s;s their Force and Power over the Soul, &s;hall we allow them to be Beauties of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Kind, and yet in&s;i&s;t on their being expunged? And why? except it be to reduce the Flights of an ex|alted Genius, by fixing the Standard of Excellence on the Practice of inferior Writers, who wanted Parts to execute &s;uch great De&s;igns; or to accom|modate them to the narrow Ideas of &s;mall Criticks, who want Souls large enough to comprehend them?</P>
<P>Our Old Writers thought no Per&s;onage whatever, unworthy a Place in the Drama, to which they could annex what may be called a <HI>Seity</HI>; that is, to which they could allot Manners and Employment peculiar to it&s;elf. The &s;evere&s;t of the Antients cannot be more eminent for the con&s;tant Pre&s;ervation of Uni|formity of Character, than <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>; and <HI>Shake|&s;peare</HI>, in no In&s;tance, &s;upports his Characters with more Exactne&s;s, than in the Conduct of his ideal Beings. The Gho&s;t in <HI>Hamlet</HI> is a &s;hining Proof of this Excellence.</P>
<P>But, in con&s;equence of the Cu&s;tom of tracing the Events of a Play minutely from a Novel, the Au|thors were &s;ometi$es led to repre&s;ent a mere human Creature in Circum&s;tances not quite con&s;onant to Nature, of a Di&s;po&s;ition rather wild and extravagant, and in both Ca&s;es more e&s;pecially repugnant to mo|dern Ideas. This indeed required particular Indul|gence
<PB N="9" REF="12">
from the Spectator, but it was an Indulgence, which &s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed of being amply repaid. Let the Writer but once be allowed, as a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Da|tum</HI>, the Po&s;&s;ibility of any Character's being placed in &s;uch a Situation, or po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;o peculiar a Turn of Mind, the Behaviour of the Character is perfectly natural. <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>, though the Child of Fancy, &s;eldom or never dre&s;t up a common Mortal in any other than the mode&s;t Dre&s;s of Nature: But many &s;hining Characters in the Plays of <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> are not &s;o well grounded on the Principles of the human Heart; and yet, as they were &s;upported with Spirit, they were received with Applau&s;e. <HI>Shy|lock</HI>'s Contract, with the Penalty of the Pound of Fle&s;h, though not <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>'s own Fiction, is per|haps rather improbable; at lea&s;t it would not be re|garded as a happy Dramatick Incident in a modern Play; and yet, having once taken it for granted, how beautifully, nay, how <HI>naturally</HI>, is the Character &s;u&s;tained!&mdash;Even this Objection therefore, of a De|viation from Nature, great as it may &s;eem, will be found to be a Plea in&s;ufficient to excu&s;e the total Ex|clu&s;ion of our antient Dramati&s;ts from the Theatre. <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>, you will readily allow, po&s;&s;e&s;t Beauties more than nece&s;&s;ary to redeem his Faults; Beauties, that excite our Admiration, and obliterate his Errors. True. But did no Portion of that divine Spirit fall to the Share of our other Old Writers? And can their Works be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or concealed, without Inju&s;tice to their Merit?</P>
<P>One of the be&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ing Plays in <HI>Ma&s;&s;inger</HI>, and which, we are told, was originally received with general Approbation, is called, <HI>The</HI> PICTURE. The Fiction, whence it takes its Title, and on which the Story of the Play is grounded, may be collected from the following &s;hort Scene. <HI>Mathias</HI>, a Gentleman of <HI>Bohemia</HI>, having taken an affecting Leave of his Wife <HI>Sophia</HI>, with a Re&s;olution of &s;erving in the King of

<P>Nothing can be more fanta&s;tick, or more in the extravagant Strain of the <HI>Italian</HI> Novels, than this Fiction: And yet the Play, rai&s;ed on it, is extremely beautiful, abounds with affecting Situations, true Character, and a faithful Repre&s;entation of Nature. The Story, thus opened, proceeds as follows. <HI>Ma|thics</HI> departs, accompanied by his Friend, and &s;erves as a Volunteer in the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Army again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI>. A complete Victory being obtained, chiefly by Means of his Valour, he is brought by the Ge|neral to the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Court, where he not only re|ceives many Honours from the King, but captivates the Heart of the Queen; who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion is not &s;o much excited by his known Valour or per&s;onal At|tractions, as by his avowed Con&s;tancy to his Wife, and his firm A&s;&s;urance of her reciprocal Affection and Fidelity to him. The&s;e Circum&s;tances touch the Pride, and rai&s;e the Envy of the Queen. She re|&s;olves, therefore, to de&s;troy His conjugal Faith by giving up Her Own, and determines to make Him a de&s;perate Offer of Her Per&s;on; and, at the &s;ame Time, under Pretence of Notice of <HI>Mathias</HI> his being detained for a Month at Court, She di&s;patches two debauched young Noblemen to tempt the Virtue of <HI>Sophia</HI>. The&s;e Incidents occa&s;ion &s;everal affecting Scenes both on the Part of the Hu&s;band and Wife. <HI>Mathias</HI> (not with an unnatural and untheatrical Stoi|ci&s;m, but with the livelie&s;t Sen&s;ibility) nobly with|&s;tands the Temptations of the Queen. <HI>Sophia</HI>, though mo&s;t virtuou&s;ly attached to her Hu&s;band, becomes unea&s;y at the feigned Stories, which the young Lords recount to her of his various Gallantries at Court, and in a Fit of Jealou&s;y, Rage, and Re&s;entment, makes a momentary Re&s;olution to give up her Honour.

<P>The&s;e &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages will, I hope, be thought by the judicious Reader to be written in the free Vein of a true Poet, as well as by the exact Hand of a faithful Di&s;ciple of Nature. If any of the above Arguments, or, rather, the uncommon Ex|cellence of the great Writers them&s;elves, can in|duce the Critick to allow the Excur&s;ions of Fancy on the Theatre, let him not &s;uppo&s;e that he is here advi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the Perver&s;ion of Nature, or to admire tho&s;e who over-leap the mode&s;t Bounds, which &s;he has pre&s;cribed to the Drama. I will agree with him, that Plays, wherein the Truth of Dramatick Character is violated, can convey neither In&s;truction nor Delight. <HI>Shake&s;peare, Jon&s;on, Beau|mont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher, Ma&s;&s;inger</HI>, &amp;c. are guilty of no &s;uch Violation. Indeed the Heroick Non&s;en&s;e, which overruns the Theatrical Productions of <HI>Dryden</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nobody can have a truer Veneration for the Poetical Genius of <HI>Dryden</HI>, than the Writer of the&s;e Reflections; but &s;urely that Genius is no where &s;o much ob&s;cured, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome tran&s;ient Gleams, as in his Plays; of which He had Him&s;elf no great Opinion, &s;ince the only Plea He ever urged in their Favour, was, that the Town had received with Applau&s;e Plays <HI>equally bad</HI>. Nothing, perhaps, but the ab&s;urd Notion of Heroick Plays, could have carried the immediate Succe&s;&s;ors to the Old Cla&s;s of Writers into &s;uch ridiculous Contradictions to Nature. That I may not appear &s;ingular in my Opinion of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Dramatick Pieces, I mu&s;t beg Leave to refer the Reader to <HI>the Rambler</HI>, No. 125, where that judicious Writer has produced divers In&s;tances from <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Plays, <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> (to u&s;e <HI>the Rambler</HI>'s own Language) <HI>to awaken the mo&s;t torpid Ri&s;ibility</HI>.</NOTE>,
<PB N="17" REF="20">
<HI>Howard</HI>, and the other illu&s;trious Prototypes of <HI>Bayes</HI> in the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI>, mu&s;t nau&s;eate the mo&s;t indulgent Spectator. The temporary Rage of fal&s;e Ta&s;te may perhaps betray the Injudicious into a fooli&s;h Admi|ration of &s;uch Extravagance for a &s;hort Period: But how will the&s;e Plays &s;tand the Brunt of critical In|dignation, when the Per&s;onages of the Drama are found to re&s;emble no Characters in Nature, except, perhaps, the di&s;ordered Inhabitants of <HI>Bedlam?</HI></P>
<P>If then it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed both from Rea&s;on and Experience, that we can not only endure, but at|tend with Plea&s;ure to Plays, which are almo&s;t merely Dramatick Repre&s;entations of romantick Novels; it will &s;urely be a further Inducement to recur to the Works of our Old Writers, when we find among them many Pieces written on a &s;everer Plan; a Plan, more accommodated to real Life, and ap|proaching more nearly to the modern U&s;age. <HI>The Merry Wives of Wind&s;or</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;peare, the Fox, the Alchymi&s;t, the Silent Woman, Every Man in his Hu|mour</HI> of <HI>Jon&s;on, the New Way to pay old Debts, the City Madam</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;&s;inger, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> all urge their Claim for a Rank in the ordinary Cour&s;e of our Winter-Evening Entertainments, not only clear of every Objection made to the abovementioned Species of Dramatick Compo&s;ition, but adhering more &s;trictly to antient Rules, than mo&s;t of our later Co|medies.</P>
<P>In Point of Character, (perhaps the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part of the Drama) our Old Writers far tran&s;cend the Moderns. It is &s;urely needle&s;s, in Support of this Opinion to recite a long Li&s;t of Names, when the Memory of every Reader mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t them to him&s;elf. The Manners of many of them, it is true, do not prevail at pre&s;ent. What then? Is it di&s;|plea&s;ing
<PB N="18" REF="21">
or unin&s;tructive to &s;ee the Manners of a for|mer Age pa&s;s in Review before us? Or is the Mind undelighted at recalling the Characters of our An|ce&s;tors, while the Eye is confe&s;&s;edly gratified at the Sight of the Actors dre&s;t in their antique Habits? Moreover, Fa&s;hion and Cu&s;tom are &s;o perpetually fluctuating, that it mu&s;t be a very accurate Piece indeed, and one quite new and warm from the An|vil, that catches the <HI>Damon</HI> or <HI>Cynthia</HI> of this Minute. Some Plays of our late&s;t and mo&s;t fa&s;hionable Au|thors are grown as ob&s;olete in this Particular, as tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Writers; and it may with Safety be affirmed, that <HI>Bobadill</HI> is not more remote from mo|dern Character, than the ever-admired and every|where-to-be-met-with Lord <HI>Foppington</HI>. It may, al&s;o, be further con&s;idered, that mo&s;t of the be&s;t Characters in our old Plays are not merely fugitive and temporary. They are not the &s;udden Growth of Ye&s;terday or To-day, &s;ure of fading or wither|ing To-morrow; but they were the Delight of pa&s;t Ages, &s;till continue the Admiration of the pre&s;ent, and (to u&s;e the Language of true Poetry)</P>

<P>There is one Circum&s;tance peculiar to the Dra|matick Tales, and to many of the more regular Comedies of our old Writers, of which it is too little to &s;ay, that it demands no Apology. It de&s;erves the highe&s;t Commendation, &s;ince it hath been the Means of introducing the mo&s;t capital Beauties into their Compo&s;itions, while the &s;ame Species of Ex|cellence could not po&s;&s;ibly enter into tho&s;e of a later Period. I mean the Poetical Stile of their Dialogue. Mo&s;t Nations, except our own, have imagined mere Pro&s;e, which, with <HI>Moliere</HI>'s <HI>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</HI>, the meane&s;t of us have talked from our Cradle, too
<PB N="19" REF="22">
little elevated for the Language of the Theatre. Our Neighbours, the <HI>French</HI>, at this Day write mo&s;t of their Plays, Comedies as well as Tragedies, in Rhime; a <HI>Gothick</HI> Practice, which our own Stage once admitted, but long ago wi&s;ely rejected. The <HI>Graecian</HI> Iambick was more happily conceived in the true Spirit of that elegant and magnificent Simplicity, which characterized the Ta&s;te of that Nation. Such a Mea&s;ure was well accommodated to the Expre&s;&s;ions of the Mind, and though it refined indeed on Na|ture, it did not contradict it. In this, as well as in all other Matters of Literature, the U&s;age of <HI>Greece</HI> was religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved at <HI>Rome. Plautus</HI>, in his riche&s;t Vein of Humour, is numerous and poetical. The Comedies of <HI>Terence</HI>, though we cannot agree to read them after Bi&s;hop <HI>Hare</HI>, were evidently not written without Regard to Mea&s;ure; which is the invincible Rea&s;on, why all Attempts to render them into downright Pro&s;e have always proved, and ever mu&s;t prove, un&s;ucce&s;sful; and if a faint Effort, now under Contemplation, to give a Ver&s;ion of them in familiar Blank Ver&s;e (after the Manner of our Old Writers, but without a &s;ervile Imitation of Them) &s;hould fail, it mu&s;t, I am confident, be owing to the Lamene&s;s of the Execution. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Heroick Mea&s;ure, or, as it is commonly called, Blank Ver&s;e, is perhaps of a more happy Con&s;truction even than the <HI>Graecian</HI> Iambick; elevated equally, but ap|proaching nearer to the Language of Nature, and as well adapted to the Expre&s;&s;ion of Comick Humour as to the <HI>Pathos</HI> of Tragedy.</P>
<P>The mere Modern Critick, who&s;e Idea of Blank Ver&s;e is perhaps attached to that empty Swell of Phra&s;eology, &s;o frequent in our late Tragedies, may con&s;ider the&s;e Notions as the Effect of Bigotry to our old Authors, rather than the Re&s;ult of impartial Critici&s;m. Let &s;uch an one carefully read over the Works of tho&s;e Writers, for whom I am an Advo|cate. There he will &s;eldom or ever find that Tu|mour
<PB N="20" REF="23">
of Blank Ver&s;e, to which He has been &s;o much accu&s;tomed. He will be &s;urpri&s;ed with a familiar Dignity, which, though it ri&s;es &s;omewhat above or|dinary Conver&s;ation, is rather an Improvement than Perver&s;ion of it. He will &s;oon be convinced, that Blank Ver&s;e is by no Means appropriated &s;olely to the Bu&s;kin, but that the Hand of a Ma&s;ter may mould it to whatever Purpo&s;es he plea&s;es; and that in Comedy, it will not only admit Humour, but heighten and embelli&s;h it. In&s;tances might be pro|duced without Number. It mu&s;t however be la|mented, that the Modern Tragick Stile, free, in|deed, from the mad Flights of <HI>Dryden</HI>, and his Co|temporaries, yet departs equally from Nature. I am apt to think it is in great Mea&s;ure owing to the al|mo&s;t total Exclu&s;ion of Blank Ver&s;e from all modern Compo&s;itions, Tragedy excepted. The common U&s;e of an Elevated Diction in Comedy, where the Writer was often, of Nece&s;&s;ity, put upon expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t ordinary Matters, and where the Subject demanded him to paint the mo&s;t ridiculous Emotions of the Mind, was perhaps one of the chief Cau&s;es of that <HI>ea&s;y Vigour</HI>, &s;o con&s;picuous in the Stile of the old Tragedies. Habituated to Poetical Dialogue in tho&s;e Compo&s;itions, wherein They were obliged to adhere more &s;trictly to the Simplicity of the Language of Nature, the Poets learnt, in tho&s;e of a more rai&s;ed Species, not to depart from it too wantonly. They were well acquainted al&s;o with the Force as well as Elegance of their Mother-Tongue, and cho&s;e to u&s;e &s;uch Words, as may be called Natives of the Lan|guage, rather than to <HI>harmonize</HI> their Ver&s;es, and <HI>agonize</HI> the Audience with <HI>Latin</HI> Terminations. Whether the refined Stile of <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Cato</HI>, and the flowing Ver&s;ification of <HI>Rowe</HI> fir&s;t occa&s;ioned this Departure from antient Simplicity it is difficult to determine: but it is too true, that <HI>Southerne</HI> was the la&s;t of our Dramatick Writers, who was, in any De|gree, po&s;&s;e&s;t of that magnificent Plainne&s;s, which is
<PB N="21" REF="24">
the genuine Dre&s;s of Nature; though indeed the Plays even of <HI>Rowe</HI> are more &s;imple in their Stile, than tho&s;e which have been produced by his Succe&s;|&s;ors. It mu&s;t not however be di&s;&s;embled in this Place, that the Stile of our Old Writers is not with|out Faults; that They were apt to give too much into Conceits; that They often per&s;ued an allegorical Train of Thought too far; and were &s;ometimes be|trayed into forced, unnatural, quaint, or gigantick Expre&s;&s;ions. In the Works of <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> him&s;elf every one of the&s;e Errors may be found; yet it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that no other Author, antient or modern, has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on &s;uch a Variety of Subjects with more Ea&s;e, and in a Vein more truly poetical, unle&s;s, perhaps, we &s;hould except <HI>Homer:</HI> Of which, by the bye, the deepe&s;t Critick, mo&s;t conver&s;ant with Idioms and Dialects, is not quite a competent Judge.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood, by what I have here &s;aid of Poetical Dialogue, to object to the U&s;e of Pro&s;e, or to in&s;inuate that our modern Comedies are the wor&s;e for being written in that Stile. It is enough for me, to have vindicated the U&s;e of a more elevated Manner among our Old Writers. I am well aware that mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Fal&s;taff, Ford, Benedick, Malvolio</HI>, &amp;c. are written in Pro&s;e; nor indeed would I coun&s;el a modern Writer to attempt the U&s;e of Poetical Dialogue in a mere Comedy: A Drama|tick Tale, indeed, chequered, like Life it&s;elf, with various Incidents, ludicrous and affecting, if written by a ma&s;terly Hand, and &s;omewhat more &s;everely than tho&s;e abovementioned, would, I doubt not, &s;till be received with Candour and Applau&s;e. The Publick would be agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed with the Re|vival of Poetry on the Theatre, and the Opportunity of employing all the be&s;t Performers, &s;erious as well as comick, in one Piece, would render it &s;till more likely to make a favourable Impre&s;&s;ion on the Au|dience.

a Ta&s;k, who was once tempted to begin a Piece of this Sort; but, I fear, he has too much Love of Ea&s;e and Indolence, and too little Ambition of lite|rary Fame, ever to complete it.</P>
<P>But to conclude:</P>
<P>Have I, Sir, been wa&s;ting all this Ink and Time in vain? Or may it be hoped that you will extend &s;ome of that Care to the re&s;t of our Old Authors, which you have &s;o long be&s;towed on <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI>, and which you have &s;o often lavi&s;hed on many a wor&s;e Writer, than the mo&s;t inferior of tho&s;e here recom|mended to You? It is certainly your Intere&s;t to give Variety to the Publick Ta&s;te, and to diver&s;ify the Colour of our Dramatick Entertainments. Encou|rage new Attempts; but do Ju&s;tice to the Old! The Theatre is a wide Field. Let not one or two Walks of it alone be beaten, but lay open the Whole to the Excur&s;ions of Genius! This, perhaps, might kindle a Spirit of Originality in our modern Writers for the Stage; who might be tempted to aim at more Novelty in their Compo&s;itions, when the Liberality of the Popular Ta&s;te rendered it le&s;s hazardous. That the Narrowne&s;s of theatrical Critici&s;m might be enlarged I have no Doubt. Reflect, for a Mo|ment, on the uncommon Succe&s;s of <HI>Romeo and Juliet</HI> and <HI>Every Man in his Humour!</HI> and then tell me, whether there are not many other Pieces of as an|tient a Date, which, with the like proper Curtail|ments and Alterations, would produce the &s;ame Ef|fect? Has an indu&s;trious Hand been at the Pains to &s;cratch up the Dunghill of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Amphitryon</HI> for the few Pearls that are buried in it, and &s;hall the rich Trea&s;ures of <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher, Jon&s;on</HI>, and <HI>Ma&s;&s;inger</HI>, lie (as it were) in the Ore, untouched and di&s;regarded? Reform your Li&s;t of Plays! In the Name of <HI>Burbage, Taylor</HI>, and <HI>Betterton</HI>, I conjure you to it! Let the veteran Criticks once more have the Satisfaction of &s;eeing <HI>the Maid's Tragedy, Phila&s;|ter, King and no King</HI>, &amp;c. on the Stage!&mdash;Re&s;tore
<PB N="23" REF="30">
<HI>Fletcher</HI>'s <HI>Elder Brother</HI> to the Rank unju&s;tly u&s;urped by <HI>Cibber</HI>'s <HI>Love makes a Man!</HI> and &s;ince you have wi&s;ely de&s;i&s;ted from giving an annual Affront to the City by acting <HI>the London Cuckolds</HI> on Lord-Mayor's Day, why will you not pay them a Compliment, by exhibiting <HI>the City Madam</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;&s;inger</HI> on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion?</P>
<P>If after all, Sir, the&s;e Remon&s;trances &s;hould prove without Effect, and the Merit of the&s;e great Authors &s;hould plead with You in vain, I will here fairly turn my Back upon you, and addre&s;s my&s;elf to the Lovers of Dramatick Compo&s;itions in general. They, I am &s;ure, will peru&s;e tho&s;e Works with Plea|&s;ure in the Clo&s;et, though they lo&s;e the Satisfaction of &s;eeing them repre&s;ented on the Stage: Nay, &s;hould They, together with You, concur in deter|mining that &s;uch Pieces are unfit to be acted, You, as well as They, will, I am confident, agree, that &s;uch Pieces are, at lea&s;t, very worthy to be read. There are many Modern Compo&s;itions, &s;een with Delight at the Theatre, which &s;icken on the Ta&s;te in the Peru&s;al; and the hone&s;t Country Gentleman, who has not been pre&s;ent at the Repre&s;entation, won|ders with what his <HI>London</HI> Friends have been &s;o highly entertained, and is as much perplexed at the <HI>Town-manner</HI> of Writing as Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> in <HI>the Re|hear&s;al</HI>. The Excellencies of our Old Writers are, on the contrary, not confined to Time and Place, but always bear about them the Evidences of true Genius.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;&s;inger</HI> is perhaps the lea&s;t known, but not the lea&s;t meritorious of any of the old Cla&s;s of Writers. His Works declare him to be no mean Proficient in the &s;ame School. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the Beauties and Blemi&s;hes common to the Writers of that Age. He has, like the re&s;t of them, in Compliance with the Cu&s;tom of the Times, admitted Scenes of a low and gro&s;s Nature, which might be omitted with no more Prejudice to the Fable, than the Buffoonry in <HI>Venice
<PB N="24" REF="31">
Pre&s;erved</HI>. For his few Faults he makes ample Atonement. His Fables are, mo&s;t of them, affect|ing; his Characters well conceived, and &s;trongly &s;upported; and his Diction, flowing, various, ele|gant, and manly. His two Plays, revived by <HI>Bet|terton, the Bondman</HI>, and <HI>the Roman Actor</HI>; are not, I think, among the Number of his be&s;t. <HI>The Duke of Milan, the Renegado, the Picture, the Fatal Dowry, the Maid of Honour, A New Way to pay Old Debts, the Unnatural Combat, the Guardian, the City Madam</HI>, are each of them, in my Mind, more excellent. He was a very popular Writer in his own Times, but &s;o unaccountably, as well as unju&s;tly, neglected at pre|&s;ent, that the accurate Compilers of a Work called <HI>The Lives of the Poets</HI>, publi&s;hed under the learned Name of the late Mr. <HI>Theophilus Cibber</HI>, have not &s;o much as mentioned him. He is, however, take him for all in all, an Author, who&s;e Works the intelligent Reader will peru&s;e with Admiration: And that I may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to withdraw my Plea for his Admi&s;&s;ion to the Modern Stage, I &s;hall conclude the&s;e Reflections with one more Specimen of his Abilities; &s;ubmitting it to all Judges of The|atrical Exhibitions, whether the mo&s;t ma&s;terly Actor would not here have an Opportunity of di&s;playing his Powers to Advantage.</P>
<P>The Extract I mean to &s;ubjoin is from the la&s;t Scene of the fir&s;t Act of <HI>the Duke of Milan.&mdash;Sforza</HI>, having e&s;pou&s;ed the Cau&s;e of the King of <HI>France</HI> again&s;t the Emperor, on the King's Defeat, is ad|vi&s;ed by a Friend, to yield him&s;elf up to the Empe|ror's Di&s;cretion.
