<P>AN APOLOGY FOR THE SERVANTS. By OLIVER GREY.</P>

<Q><P>&startq;I can hardly think in point of equity, that long and faithful &s;ervices, e&s;pecially in great and opulent families, ought to be put off with the bare payment of &s;tipulated wages; and not &s;ome additional bounty be&s;towed that may contribute to the ea&s;e of an aged &s;ervant, &endq;and bring his <HI>grey hairs</HI> with quiet <HI>to the grave.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN APOLOGY FOR THE SERVANTS.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is &s;o general or &s;o fre|quent a &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, as the behaviour and character of &s;er|vants: and contrary to all others, which have, for the mo&s;t part, divided the &s;enti|ments of the world, this theme &s;eems to have introduced an unanimity of opinion a|mong mankind, who are agreed in an uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="2" REF="4">cen&s;ure on tho&s;e who&s;e unhappy lot it is to be born to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t therefore be an hardy advocate, and not like to gain much reputation, who ventures to appear in a cau&s;e again&s;t which &s;o &s;trong a prejudice is conceived.</P>
<P>But for the &s;ake of truth and ju&s;tice, and with an abhorrence of railing and reviling, I have taken up this forlorn cau&s;e, and hope to &s;ay &s;omething in the following apology, that may take off that &s;everity, which the reader, among many thou&s;ands, may have contracted again&s;t men of this humble cal|ling, and reconcile him &s;o far to the frater|nity, as to induce him to think and &s;peak of it with candour and humanity.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly the public may be de&s;irous to know who I am; and if it be any &s;atis|faction, I will tell them, that I am an old &s;ervant in the &s;ixty-third year of my age, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting entirely on an annuity of twenty pounds a year, bequeathed to me by one of my ma&s;ters; who&s;e &s;on, a gentleman of honour and great goodne&s;s, is plea&s;ed to
<PB N="3" REF="5">revi&s;e and correct the&s;e my coar&s;e and homely labours.</P>
<P>I am led to this undertaking, not only in defence of the &s;ervants of this kingdom, but that I may have an opportunity of ob|&s;erving upon the weakne&s;&s;es, inadvertencies, and mi&s;conduct of ma&s;ters, which have been a fatal &s;ource of mi&s;chief to their de|pendants: and I am convinced it will be found that the behaviour of the latter, which has been cen&s;ured with great vehe|mence, owes its ri&s;e, among other things, to the injudicious conduct of the former. The&s;e loo&s;e and unconnected thoughts of mine, therefore, may not only give &s;atis|faction to the &s;ervants, but may be of u&s;e al&s;o to tho&s;e of higher &s;tation, by &s;hewing them &s;ome errors in their own behaviour.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I am writing in the &s;ervants defence, and &s;hall probably be read by all tho&s;e who can read, who may al&s;o, if they plea&s;e, communicate my &s;enti|ments to their more illiterate brethren, I mu&s;t tell them that I &s;hall not &s;pare their faults, when they come in my way; but,
<PB N="4" REF="6">like an hone&s;t &s;urgeon, probe them to the bottom.</P>
<P>They are not to look then on this little treati&s;e as a cordial to rai&s;e their &s;pirits, and to &s;et them upon immediately abu&s;ing the family they live in; but as a manual, to furni&s;h them with &s;ome hone&s;t an&s;wers, and mode&s;t excu&s;es, to be urged occa&s;ionally in their own behalf.</P>
<P>Let it be under&s;tood, therefore, that I am not writing in defence of any &s;ervants, but tho&s;e who are hone&s;t and &s;ober; &s;uch as are irreproachable in tho&s;e great and nece&s;&s;ary points, and not deficient in diligence, clean|line&s;s, civility, and the like; but who may po&s;&s;ibly have, with the&s;e qualities, &s;ome faults and foibles of a le&s;&s;er kind, which are equally to be overlooked both in &s;ervants and ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>I profe&s;s to have nothing to &s;ay to &s;ots, thieves, game&s;ters, corruptors of children, &amp;c. of which there are infinite numbers in this great town, who live an everla&s;ting di&s;|grace to their profe&s;&s;ion, a &s;candal to all worthy families, and a reproach to civil go|vernment.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="7">
<P>I write to the hone&s;t, &s;ober, diligent, cleanly &s;ervant, who has no other infirmities than his &s;uperiors; and &s;hall give him my thoughts, ju&s;t as they occur to me, with|out any particular form or method; a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time, whether they are right or wrong, that I &s;hall not take the trouble to defend them, &s;hould they be attacked by any hired writer in a two-penny paper, or any &s;uperficial critic in a &s;hilling pamphlet.</P>
<P>I take the grand clamour again&s;t our pro|fe&s;&s;ion to be levelled at our vails, rather than our morals. We &s;hould have a much greater number of friends and advocates, and fewer enemies, if we entered into &s;ervice without looking for perqui&s;ites&mdash;but more of this by and by.</P>
<P>It was about three years ago that &s;ome gentlemen of rank and fortune entered into a kind of a&s;&s;ociation, neither to give vails to the &s;ervants of others, nor to &s;uffer their own to receive any; but at the &s;ame time they rai&s;ed their re&s;pective &s;ervants wages, as an equivalent for the lo&s;s they &s;hould
<PB N="6" REF="8">&s;u&s;tain by this new regulation. Whether, when the wages were rai&s;ed, the perqui&s;ites crept on again, or whether tho&s;e gentlemen were &s;ick of the burthen; and &s;o threw it back again on their friends, I cannot deter|mine; but it is certain this &s;tep, however <HI>well</HI> intended, has not produced any mate|rial reformation.</P>
<P>This year we have been under con&s;ider|ation again, and have made our appearance on the &s;tage.&mdash;But however the author of <HI>High Life Below Stairs</HI> may pride him&s;elf in his &s;atirical repre&s;entation, I will venture to tell him, that <HI>Low Life Above Stairs</HI> would have made a much livelier &s;cene, if it had been filled with as much wit and hu|mour, as it had &s;candal and ob&s;cenity.</P>
<P>There is a &s;torm too gathering again&s;t us in the north. The gentry in Scotland, we are told, are taking away their &s;ervants drink money; which I &s;uppo&s;e an&s;wers to our vails, and is what the extravagant &s;pend, and the frugal &s;ervants lay up to &s;upport them in their old age. I know not what may be the end of this proceeding; but I hope, and &s;o
<PB N="7" REF="9">does every true Engli&s;hman, whether in li|very, or out of livery, never to &s;ee the day, when Scotland is to dictate to <HI>England</HI> either in religion, politicks, or oeconomicks.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e attacks, we have had &s;everal little &s;trokes given us in the news-papers, which are &s;carce worthy our notice, being in|tended, I &s;uppo&s;e, to fill the paper in a &s;carcity of foreign or dome&s;tic news.</P>
<P>Before I &s;peak of vails and perqui&s;ites, let me remark the want of candour and libe|rality that is apparent in mankind, with re|&s;pect to their opinions on the characters of &s;ervants; and ob&s;erve how often that vice, fault, folly and foible, which is cen&s;ured in the &s;ervant, is notorious and glaring in the conduct of the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Dick Bru&s;h and I began the world toge|ther; he was one of the fine&s;t fellows that ever wore a livery; he was hand&s;ome, gen|teel, &s;en&s;ible, and well-bred: with all the&s;e agreeable qualities, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;obriety, fidelity, neatne&s;s, and diligence. He was the admiration of his fellow &s;er|vants; beloved by the women, re&s;pected by the men; and the be&s;t friend and advi&s;er in
<PB N="8" REF="10">the world to all young &s;ervants. Dick was u&s;ed to &s;ay to me whenever he heard a &s;er|vant was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for a foible: "Oliver, I will hold a bottle of wine that his ma&s;ter has the &s;ame fault, or a wor&s;e." When he happened to be out of place him&s;elf, and I recommended him to Mr. Such-a-one's Ser|vice; &mdash;"Can I have a good character of him?" &s;ays Dick.&mdash;He was a zealous friend to his brethren; and oftentimes u&s;ed to &s;ay with much plea&s;antry, that there were &s;ome of the greate&s;t men in the kingdom that wore liveries&mdash;"Let me tell you gentle|men, &s;ays he, one night at the club, I held it the ba&s;e&s;t thing in life for ma&s;ters to abu&s;e their &s;ervants, good, hone&s;t, faithful, wor|thy &s;ervants, becau&s;e they have this or that fault, when they them&s;elves are more cul|pable even in that very re&s;pect. When I lived in the Temple, I have been cur&s;ed for &s;hutting the door a little too hard, when my judicious ma&s;ter has done nothing all the morning but play upon the hautboy. I have been &s;colded for &s;neezing at dinner; when my ma&s;ter the whole time has been cough|ing and expectorating. I have been kicked for a pert an&s;wer, and told with half a dozen
<PB N="9" REF="11">oaths, that I ought to &s;peak decently. The&s;e are things which no man of &s;pirit can &s;ubmit to; and rather than &s;erve &s;o &s;elf in|tere&s;ted and partial a ma&s;ter, I would even en|ter into the &s;ervice of an apothecary, where I am to beat the mortar, carry out medicines, and wear a livery that never was made for me. "If you plea&s;e, gentlemen, continued Dick, let us make it our bu&s;ine&s;s to find out what our ma&s;ters opinions of us are, and re|port it this day month to the club: I'll be hanged if you don't all think with me." This propo&s;al was unaninou&s;ly agreed to; we met accordingly, and Dick being in the chair, de&s;ired we would relate in order what we had collected on the &s;ubject; and, as his right hand man, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf fir&s;t to me. I ro&s;e up, and, with great re|&s;pect to the chair, told them, I had the plea|&s;ure to find that my ma&s;ter had but one very material objection to me. "Oliver, I have overheard him to &s;ay to a friend, is a very good &s;ervant; but he brings me in con|founded bills, and &s;uch a variety of articles too; it is an enormous &s;um that I pay the fellow for one trumpery thing or other:" What bu&s;ine&s;s is your ma&s;ter of? &s;ays the
<PB N="10" REF="12">chairman. I bowed re&s;pectfully, and an&s;|wered an attorney at law&mdash;Mr. Chairman then gave a nod, and a wink, and the com|pany joined in a laugh.&mdash;He then called upon Mr. Samuel, to give his fairly without re&s;erve. "I live, &s;ays Samuel, with a gen|tleman who &s;ays I have but one fault, and that I &s;hould be the be&s;t &s;ervant in the world if I was not conceited; he often &s;ays he be|lieves I cannot be matched for vanity, and that I care for nothing in the world &s;o much as my own dear per&s;on, which I am perpe|tually admiring in the gla&s;s." And what is he, &s;ays the chairman? A player, Samuel replied. Here the laugh was louder. Mr. William being called upon, delivered him|&s;elf thus: "I am not quite &s;o happy, Sir, in my &s;ervice as the two gentlemen who have &s;poken before me. My ma&s;ter has but an indifferent opinion of me. He was &s;aying with much warmth t'other day to his lady, that he believed there was not &s;uch another fellow in the kingdom as my&s;elf, for making the mo&s;t of a &s;ervice. There is not, &s;ays he, a tran&s;action in the hou&s;e, but Will makes a pecuniary advantage of it; not a bill paid of any kind, or to any per&s;on, but
<PB N="11" REF="13">he has a &s;lice out of it; nay, if I &s;end down five or ten &s;hillings, in charity to a poor ob|ject, 'tis ten to one but he &s;queezes &s;ome|thing out of it." What is your ma&s;ter, Mr. William? &s;ays the chairman. He an&s;|wered, a clerk in the T&mdash;y. At this the laugh became very loud and long; and the chairman concluded the &s;ubject by ob&s;erving, how blind men were to their own failings, and how ready to cen&s;ure them in others. "I am convinced, &s;ays he, that our cloth would not be half &s;o be&s;pattered, if a man before he condemns a &s;ervant for any fault, would enquire if it was not a principal ingre|dient in his own character."</P>
<P>The excellent reflections which Dick made at this, and other times, on this topic, might have done honour to any gentleman of higher rank, and more cultivated educa|tion.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but every ma&s;ter of a fa|mily would be &s;hocked, if he was told that his &s;ervants played con&s;tantly at cards in an evening. The idlene&s;s of the habit, and the dangerous con&s;equences, would frighten
<PB N="12" REF="14">him, and force him immediately to di&s;mi&s;s them from his &s;ervice. But pray why do all the&s;e horrid con&s;equences attend the grea&s;y kitchen cards, any more than the &s;pruce pack in the parlour? Is whi&s;t a whit more innocent than all-fours? Or cribbidge more fatal than quadrille? If the ma&s;ter plays only for amu&s;ement, why not the &s;er|vant? If he plays for more than he can afford, how can he have the face to condemn his &s;ervant? For my own part, I always thought it &s;candalous for &s;ervants to play at cards, except at Chri&s;tmas-time; but what a temptation is it for them to become card-players, when ten thou&s;and &s;ober regular good families &s;et them the example <HI>every night in the year.</HI></P>
<P>Drinking is a vice never to be over-looked in a &s;ervant.&mdash;I think I can &s;ay, with truth, that it is not a common vice among them.&mdash; The rea&s;on for this may be, that it would ruin their characters, and &s;oon di&s;qualify them from doing their bu&s;ine&s;s. But I take the principal rea&s;on for their not running into this exce&s;s to be this, That it is not a common practice among their betters.&mdash;The wor&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="15">broken head I ever had in my life, was for &s;tealing a rummer gla&s;s full of burgundy,&mdash; the fact was this;&mdash;my ma&s;ter, who was a &s;ingle man, and always dined by him&s;elf, and never ro&s;e from table without a bottle of that wine to his own &s;hare, was one day &s;uddenly called out; but, returning &s;ooner than expected, caught me in the forementi|oned &s;ituation, with the gla&s;s at my mouth, enjoying the delicious draught. I immedi|ately received the reward of my pre&s;umption, which was a wound three inches long on the &s;ide of my head, made by a &s;mall cane that he always walked with. But what gave me more angui&s;h than my bodily &s;uffering, was to &s;ee him fini&s;h &s;ix bottles of that very wine the &s;ame night, with an Oxford&s;hire baronet.</P>
<P>It is very certain that there are in the world many worthle&s;s and abandoned &s;er|vants, who behave rudely, ungratefully, &s;au|cily, rogui&s;hly, and villainou&s;ly to the fami|lies into which they are received: but it always will be &s;o in large bodies of men; there will be &s;ome who di&s;grace their cal|ling. I wi&s;h with all my heart that the
<PB N="14" REF="16">number was not &s;o great, and that more of our fraternity preferred yarn and hob-nails to pumps and white &s;tockings. I am con|vinced it would be better both for &s;ervants and ma&s;ters. If there were not &s;uch a choice of &s;ervants, and &s;uch a variety of places, the &s;ervants would be cautious how they left their places, and the ma&s;ters more willing to make them ea&s;y and happy. But every one now-a-days mu&s;t have a footman. There is &s;carce a trade&s;man of any likeli|hood, but will have this appendage, to at|tend his lady in her vi&s;its, or to ride out with him on a Sunday. Tho&s;e who may very well afford to keep one, will &s;tretch farther, and have two, who make a pretty figure behind an equipage, and denominate the owner to be of &s;uperior quality. It is owing to the great number of livery &s;er|vants, that we hear &s;o frequently tales and &s;tories to their di&s;credit, which I will take for granted are true; and &s;hall, by way of an&s;wer and counterbalance to them, briefly relate my own unhappy &s;tory.</P>
<P>I entered at fifteen into the &s;ervice of the par&s;on of the pari&s;h wherein I was born;
<PB N="15" REF="17">and though I got very little wages, I had much good council given me, which I have been the better for, under a thou&s;and dif|ficulties and misfortunes. At twenty I came to town, pa&s;&s;ed through a variety of &s;er|vices, took care to be the better for them all, and was in the fifty-fifth year of my age, happy in the &s;ervice of a merchant and in&s;urer in the city, who was a gentleman of extraordinary character, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth an immen&s;e fortune. He appeared to be a grave, regular, &s;ober man, and pro|fe&s;&s;ed a more than ordinary regard for his &s;ervants, &s;ome of whom had lived with him a long time, and particularly an old nur&s;e, who had been in the family near fifty years. I was at that time, as I &s;aid before, in my fifty-fifth year, and had &s;aved, in the cour&s;e of forty years labour, three hundred and &s;eventy pounds; which, by the advice of all my fellow-&s;ervants, I had, at my fir&s;t en|trance into the family, placed in my ma&s;ter's hands; who, as they &s;aid, might be pre|vailed on to take it; and, if he did, would give five per cent. intere&s;t, which would be punctually paid every half year. I did &s;o, and received the intere&s;t the fir&s;t half year.
<PB N="16" REF="18">And &s;o fond was I, with the re&s;t of the inhabitants of the kitchen, to make our ad|vantage of this generous u&s;age, that no &s;ooner had we rai&s;ed 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> but it was thrown into the honourable bank, to increa&s;e and multiply.</P>
<P>I will not be tedious; it was in the month of January 1752, that we were, to the num|ber of &s;even, enjoying our&s;elves by a large fire, and drinking our good ma&s;ter's health in a bowl of punch we had clubbed for: he was gone to Deal that day, to take leave of an Ea&s;t-India captain;&mdash;we were &s;it|ting, I &s;ay, enjoying our&s;elves, and thinking of the hand&s;ome provi&s;ion we had made for our old age, when we were rou&s;ed from our golden dream by a &s;mart rap at the door, and the entrance of a forward attor|ney's clerk, who no &s;ooner entered the hou&s;e, but he told us, our ma&s;ter was broke for a va&s;t &s;um of money; that his affairs were quite de&s;perate, and that he was obliged to fly to France. This was a thunderbolt to us all, and proved an immediate one to the poor old nur&s;e, who had upwards of &s;ix hun|dred pound in her ma&s;ter's hands. She imme|diately
<PB N="17" REF="19">fell-into a fit, and was happily deli|vered from all her care, by dying that very night. Some of us were &s;o enraged, that we were for &s;eizing the plate, &amp;c. but the lawyer &s;oon put a &s;top to our violence, by telling us that &s;uch a &s;tep would be fatal to us. We were turned off the next day, with the mi&s;erable reflection of having lo&s;t all that we were worth in the world, which amounted in the whole to eighteen hundred and fifty pounds.</P>
<P>This tragic &s;cene will naturally introduce the article of perqui&s;ites, the grand cau&s;e of that clamour which is rai&s;ed again&s;t us.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of giving vails is &s;aid to be peculiar to England, but I am informed that it prevails in other countries, e&s;pecially in Germany. It takes its ri&s;e from a very na|tural de&s;ire in &s;ervants to get what they eat; and from an artificial practice in ma&s;ters to encrea&s;e the value of their places: to this may be added that in great families, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the nobility, this cu&s;tom is a kind of dragon or bug-bear to keep off poor de|pendants, and the va&s;t multitude of hun|gry
<PB N="18" REF="20">half gentry, who know not where to get a dinner.</P>
<P>If ma&s;ters, from any motive whatever con|tribute to this practice they are an&s;werable for it. I would only ju&s;t a&s;k, if they don't go with a kind of plea&s;ure to the door, after a gue&s;t, to &s;ee whether he gives or not; and if they do not expre&s;s more &s;atisfaction, the more liberal they ob&s;erve their friends to be on the&s;e occa&s;ions?</P>
<P>The excellent author of my motto has told us very &s;eriou&s;ly that &s;ome advantages are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; be&s;ides the wages &s;tipulated, in order to make our old age comfortable; very often are we reproached with want of prudence in not making a pro|vi&s;ion for that helple&s;s &s;tate. How is that to be done? Not from our wages only, that is impo&s;&s;ible. It mu&s;t ari&s;e from our vails, fifty years ago five pound per annum was the common wages of a family &s;ervant; which would go as far as ten now. At pre&s;ent &s;e|ven or eight pound is the general pay. Let any one calculate what a footman can &s;ave out of eight pound a year, which is to find
<PB N="19" REF="21">him &s;hirts, &s;tockings, &s;hoes, periwigs, &amp;c. and to defray two occa&s;ional, but every expen|&s;ive articles, viz. the apothecary's bill, and lying out of place. He mu&s;t be a very heathful per&s;on, and a very good oeconomi&s;t, who can, under the&s;e &s;trait circum&s;tances, &s;ave forty &s;hillings every year of his life, which after forty years labour, will rai&s;e him the &s;um of four&s;core pounds, to &s;upport him under the weakne&s;&s;es of old age.</P>
<P>The gentry do not con&s;ider how they tempt us, with good living and fine liveries, to leave the plough, the loom, the &s;cythe, the ax, &amp;c. which would turn to much better, and more reputable account, had we not that folly in our nature (&s;omething like which we now and then di&s;cover in our bet|ters) of being caught by a laced wai&s;tcoat or golden &s;houlder-knot. They don't con&s;i|der that they have the very prime of our life. Who will take an old &s;ervant? Nobody. If he has &s;aved nothing to &s;upport him&s;elf he mu&s;t crawl to the workhou&s;e; if he has got a little matter together, his lot will not be quite &s;o bad, and he may end his days with an old &s;he mate in a &s;orry alehou&s;e, or a
<PB N="20" REF="22">petty chandler's &s;hop. They don't con&s;ider what con&s;tant labour that of a &s;ervant is, every day in the year the &s;ame ta&s;k is to be performed, no holidays, no vacations, ex|cept now and then leave obtained, with diffi|culty, to &s;ee a play, or to pay a vi&s;it to a friend, or to a country man.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the bodily labours which we un|dergo, it is incredible to think what a well di&s;po&s;ed &s;ervant &s;uffers in his mind in the &s;pace of twenty or thirty years, from pride, in&s;olence, moro&s;ene&s;s, avarice, peevi&s;hne&s;s, ha&s;tine&s;s, meanne&s;s, &amp;c. not to mention the ab&s;urd me&s;&s;ages, and long-winded compli|ments he is to carry every day, and the con|founded lies he is obliged to tell many tolera|bly genteel family.</P>
<P>Surely &s;ome little advantages, be&s;ides wages, are due to &s;ervants on the&s;e con&s;iderations: which, among per&s;ons of generous minds, ought to rai&s;e them advocates and friends. The ladies, I think, cannot fail to be the fir&s;t in this honourable cla&s;s, where plea&s;ure and happine&s;s is generally promoted by their &s;er|vants, from the time that they bring the
<PB N="21" REF="23">morning chocolate, and receive the orders of the day to the long midnight hour in which the flambeau is extingui&s;hed. Maiden la|dies and widows, who are hou&s;ekeepers, are particularly engaged to patroni&s;e us, when they con&s;ider their own timid di&s;po&s;itions, and how uncomfortable a thing it is to go to bed without a man in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid and urged as a mo&s;t forcible ar|gument again&s;t us, that this vile cu&s;tom of vails has de&s;troyed all the ho&s;pitality in the land. A man cannot have a relation of &s;mall fortune come to dine with him, but he mu&s;t pay the &s;ervant a &s;hilling for his dinner. I don't find that this argument is urged by the gentleman who gives the din|ners, but by the gentlemen who want them. I fancy ma&s;ters of families are, in general, willing that matters &s;hould &s;tand upon their pre&s;ent footing; concluding that a poor re|lation, or a unhappy friend, who can eat two or three pound of fi&s;h, fowl, and fle&s;h, and wa&s;h them down with two or three pints of wine, is not much injured by pay|ing a &s;hilling for it.</P>
<PB N="22" REF="24">
<P>"Oh! but it is pa&s;t bearing in people of quality and di&s;tinction to let loo&s;e half a dozen fellows at you, as you go out of the hou&s;e after dinner." Oh! but it is incre|dible to think on the other hand what a number of bold gue&s;ts they would have at their tables every day if they did not do &s;o; there are &s;o many &s;ingle gentlemen of &s;mall fortunes and large a&s;&s;urance about this town who would make &s;o free with noblemen's tables, that, if it were not for the partico|loured centinels, it is certain the chop-hou&s;es would almo&s;t be for&s;aken.</P>
<P>I am well convinced therefore that this affair of cutting off the vails, notwith&s;tand|ing all the efforts in the north, will never take place in England, unle&s;s it is begun by the nobility and gentry of di&s;tinction; and how likely they are to break thro' a long e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom, and one of apparent con|venience to them&s;elves, let any man of &s;en&s;e determine.</P>
<P>I would confine my argument to families in the middle way of life.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="25">
<P>If gentlemen are really de&s;irous to &s;ee their poor relations, which I'll venture to &s;ay, is not the ca&s;e with one in ten, a good cup of chocolate in the morning, or a di&s;h of tea in the afternoon will be no di&s;agreea|ble repa&s;t, as they may in mo&s;t families, &s;o far indulge, without paying any thing for it.&mdash;But if am hired to wait on a family at &s;o much a year, and there comes in four or five times a week five or &s;ix of the&s;e poor couzins, have not I three times more trouble in whetting knives, cleaning of gla&s;&s;es, &amp;c. and am I not al&s;o obliged to be twice as quick and ready at the table? "Well? and &s;o you ought, it is an&s;wered; they are your ma&s;ters gue&s;ts, and it is your duty to wait on them." So I will once and away, but if they make &s;uch good u&s;e of my ma&s;ter's ho&s;|pitality, as to come often and give nothing, then they make me <HI>their</HI> &s;ervants, and that was not the condition of the obligation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this cry about the great hard&s;hip put upon poor kin&s;men, by this cu&s;tom of vails, every &s;ervant of experience knows that they do often come and &s;ee their
<PB N="24" REF="26">rich relations, and after a very plentiful meal, either walk out cooly without putting their hands to their pockets, or el&s;e run out in a violent hurry and pretend not to &s;ee the &s;er|vant at the door.</P>
<P>At my fir&s;t coming to town I lived with a genteel and reputable family in the city: a Corni&s;h &s;quire, his lady and two daughters &s;pent a whole winter with us. Every mo|ment of my time was taken up. I bru&s;hed the &s;quire's coat, combed his wig, and cleaned his &s;hoes every day. Four times a week I was &s;ent by the ladies to the blue-periwig in old Bond-&s;treet, with me&s;&s;ages to my lady <HI>Penlizard</HI> who lodged there. All this I chearfully did, be&s;ides my common bu&s;ine&s;s in the hou&s;e, expecting to be hand|&s;omely rewarded for my great trouble and uncommon diligence. Upon their departure the &s;quire gave me half a crown, the lady two &s;hillings, and the mi&s;&s;es one &s;hilling a-peice.</P>
<P>For my part I am not at all anxious, and I would have none of my brethren &s;ollicitous le&s;t they &s;hould be deprived of that part of
<PB N="25" REF="27">their profits from which only they are able to make a provi&s;ion for the wants of old age; for the&s;e two rea&s;ons, viz. that it is extremely difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;et limits to vo|luntary donations; and, if it were po&s;&s;ible to do &s;o, it is neither the de&s;ire nor intere&s;t of tho&s;e who&s;e authority and example would be mo&s;t prevalent to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;evere enemy we have will &s;urely allow us to &s;ave &s;omething out of our income for a latter day, nay would cen&s;ure us if we did not. I always de&s;ire to be un|der&s;tood as &s;peaking of &s;ervants in common families, who are the mo&s;t numerous, and have no pro&s;pect of future advantages by places, &s;ituation, or promotion of any kind, which the &s;ervants of the nobility have, but only depend on their own frugality for a &s;up|port in time of age and infirmity. And I would a&s;k if a &s;ervant may not be allowed to &s;ave five pound out of his income, for that purpo&s;e, every year; by which after labour|ing forty years he would have 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to maintain him till he died.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="28">
<P>This cannot be con&s;trued an unrea&s;onable or extravagant demand; but how is it to an&s;wer if our vails are to be de&s;troyed? Can five pounds a year be &s;aved out of eight? It is a general maxim with us, and it is a mo|de&s;t one, viz. that a &s;ervant &s;hould be able to &s;ave all his wages by the advantage of perqui&s;ites. I have &s;et it lower, and if the world will not allow us this benefit, they may as well allow us none at all, and &s;o leave us to the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all &s;tates, old age and poverty.</P>
<P>If ever our affairs were to become the &s;ubject of public enquiry, which it is not very natural to &s;uppo&s;e; I hope the forego|ing hints may be u&s;eful to &s;ome able advocate in our cau&s;e. And I think he will add, that it cannot be right to depre&s;s a &s;et of people, from whence a body of twenty or thirty thou&s;and fighting men might be drawn, to &s;erve in the imminent danger of their king and country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with what I &s;et out at fir&s;t, and repeat that I write the&s;e ob&s;ervations
<PB N="27" REF="29">for the u&s;e of &s;ober, hone&s;t, diligent, good &s;er|vants, not as a foundation for in&s;olence or pert|ne&s;s, but as hints to enable them to &s;ay &s;ome|thing for them&s;elves. I &s;hall rejoice if any good purpo&s;e is &s;erved hereby with regard either to &s;ervants or ma&s;ters; for my&s;elf, I am quite unconcerned in any things that is intended or may be executed again&s;t our body of people. I have but a very few years to live, and, re|membering the good advice and excellent example of my fir&s;t ma&s;ter, am every day preparing my&s;elf for that place where there is neither &s;ervant nor ma&s;ter, and where tho&s;e who are now fir&s;t may be la&s;t.</P>
<P>The reader will &s;mile, perhaps, or may laugh and &s;neer, to &s;ee &s;uch a conclu&s;ion as this: but I am not a&s;hamed to acquaint him, that I never in all my life wilfully neglected my duty to God, or &s;uffered my&s;elf to mi&s;|pend my Sunday, tho' I often had it in my power to do &s;o, which I attribute to the good principles I imbibed in my fir&s;t &s;ervice.</P>
<P>And here let me conclude with a matter of fact, which I hope will have its effect on our &s;uperiors, that, in the &s;pace of forty five
<PB N="28" REF="30">years, in which I &s;erved fourteen ma&s;ters, all members of the church of England, I was never &s;hewed the way to church but by three of them, viz. my fir&s;t ma&s;ter, a bencher of the Temple, and a weaver in Spital-fields.</P>
