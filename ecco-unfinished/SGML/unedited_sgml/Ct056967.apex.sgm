<HEAD TYPE="sub">IN A LETTER FROM A Member of Parliament of <HI>North Britain,</HI> to a Mini&s;ter in <HI>Scot|land:</HI> Occa&s;ioned by the Hou&s;e of Lords Rever&s;ing the Sen|tence of Mr. <HI>Green&s;hiels.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I make no Que&s;tion, but the Fir&s;t Accounts you will have of what has pa&s;t here, in the upper Hou&s;e of Parliament will be very &s;urprizing both to you and many others, and the more &s;o for two Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Mi&s;repre&s;entations and Agravati|ons, with which tho&s;e People tell the Story,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
who either to make their Triumph over you the greater, or to encrea&s;e your Di&s;order, at the News, have given a mo&s;t unfair and falfe Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Apprehen&s;ions and Fears you may have of the Con&s;equences of it, and of the farther Impo&s;itions of this kind, which may follow.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on I thought it might be U&s;efull, to enter a little into the State of things with you, by way of Letter, and to Enquire or rather Con&s;ider, what is the proper Duty of us and our People in <HI>Scotland</HI> who have the Intere&s;t and Liberties, both of the Church, and People of <HI>Scotland</HI> mo&s;t at Heart. What is be&s;t for us to do, and how to behave both with Re|&s;pect to the <HI>Government,</HI> with re&s;p ct to the <HI>Church,</HI> and with re&s;pect to <HI>Our Selves,</HI> and our <HI>Po&s;terity.</HI></P>
<P>I make no Profe&s;&s;ions here of my Sincerity to, and Zeal for the true Intere&s;t of the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> I hope my Behaviour, in all pa&s;t Occa&s;ions, wherein the Church has been Concern'd, will Vindicate me, to tho&s;e that know me, and to tho&s;e that do not know me what I &s;hall write on this Occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;peak both for it &s;elf and for me.</P>
<P>I am far from De&s;iring, that any Man &s;hould Aban|don the Intere&s;t of the Church, I wi&s;h &s;ome who Profe&s;s an extraordinary concern at this thing, now it is pa&s;t, had Appeared more Concern'd to prevent it, when it was in their Power; and not Contented them&s;elves with a Superficial light Oppo&s;ition, hardly enough to ju&s;tifie their &s;aying they Oppo&s;ed it, when a Faithfull Vigorous with&s;tanding this unju&s;t At|tempt had not been their duty only, but was a debt to their &s;acred Promi&s;es when in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and might per|haps have been effectual to have warded of this Blow, the Con&s;equences of which, I doubt they will &s;hew as little Concern to prevent as they did the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
I am not therefore per&s;wading any Man to Abandon or for&s;ake the true Intere&s;t of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> much le&s;s to give up any the lea&s;t of her Priviledges and e&s;tabli&s;h't Rights; lea&s;t of all, would I have you either Di&s;ponding or Di&s;couraged in the Apprehen&s;i|ons of your Ca&s;e being Abandoned and De&s;perate, gi|ven up to your Enemies, or they &s;trengthened to In&s;ult and Invade you.</P>
<P>Yet on the other hand, I &s;hould be very Sorry to See Ra&s;h and Hot Mea&s;ures, Furious Refentments, and Violent Tempers Run you out to any Steps, that either may widen this Breach, or &s;eem to lay more &s;tre&s;s upon it than the Nature of the Thing calls for, and the Main Rea&s;on, I will not &s;ay the only Rea|&s;on is, becau&s;e I would not give your Enemies the Ad|vantage again&s;t you, that generally are the Effect of Ra&s;h and Ha&s;ty Re&s;entments, or Expo&s;e your &s;elves to the Cen&s;ure of tho&s;e who Boa&s;t &s;o much over our Country Men, for the Violence and Ungovernd Fury of their Zeal.</P>
<P>In order therefore to find out the &s;afe and middle Way, which the Friends of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and tho&s;e that love and regard her Intere&s;t, ought to take in this nice juncture, I &s;hall enquire into, and &s;tate the Several Particulars of this matters, as Im+partially as I can.</P>
<P>When the Appeal of <HI>Green&s;hiels</HI> again&s;t the Sen|tence of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, and Magi&s;trates of <HI>E|dinburgh,</HI> Fir&s;t came into Debate, in the Hou&s;e of Peers. The fir&s;t Que&s;tion which came to be debated in that Hou&s;e was the Legality of the Appeal.</P>
<P>It is too true a &s;aying, that <HI>Ab&s;ence Expo&s;es to In|jury,</HI> and I confe&s;s I have often thought, there ought to have been &s;ome Agent from <HI>Scoland</HI> there, to have Vindicated the Rights of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to have pleaded again&s;t the bringing a Sentence of the
<PB N="6" REF="5">
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> before a Civil Judicature of any kind. The &s;aid Church having a Soveraign Judica|ture of their own, in which the Queen being always pre&s;ent by her Commi&s;&s;ioner, Matters are Determi|ned without any Appeal, except to the Bar of <HI>Heaven:</HI> For every Court where the Queen is pre&s;ent, in &s;uch a manner, is a Soveraign Judicature; and the Peculiar of a Soveraign Judicature is this, That it admits of no Appeal; for to Appeal from it to the Hou&s;e of Peers; is to Appeal from a Soveraign Judicature, to a Soveraign Judicature, which is Incon&s;i&s;tency and Non&s;ence.</P>
<P>There was a Noble Lord of our own Coun|try, and one of our Sixteen, who took much P ms to prove, That our Church notwith&s;tanding the U$i|on, the Act of Security, or any other of former $utho|ritys, Acts of Parliament, or e&s;tabli&s;hed Priviled$es was entirely &s;ubject to the Government of the Civil Power, That the Supremacy of the Crown, in Ca|&s;es Eccle&s;ia&s;tick was never Repealed or De&s;troyed in <HI>Scotland:</HI> And much Pains his Lor&s;hip took to bring it in the Power of the Hou&s;e of Peers, to Determine of all Matters relating to Our Church. The De&s;ign was evident (viz) That by the &s;ame Rule it lay in the Power of the Hou&s;e of Lords to Alter, Change, or Turn the Government of our Church, from E|pi&s;copal to Pre&s;byterian, and from Presbyterian to Epi&s;copal, as they &s;hould find Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But this Noble Lord's pious Endeavours did not Succeed according to his d$&s;ire, and the Hou&s;e made no Motion that way.</P>
<P>As to the Ca&s;e before them it was judged after &s;ome Debate, That the Appeal was regular and that the Hou&s;e of Peers, had a right to take cognizance of that Affair: I do acknowledge there &s;eems &s;ome diffi|culty to us, who live in North Britain, about the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
ju&s;tice of any Court determining for them&s;elves, Whether &s;uch or &s;uch matters come under their juri&s;diction o$ no, &s;ince no Court will, or but very rarely Vote away their own Power.</P>
<P>I mention all this for this Rea&s;on, That you may take notice, that although the Lords did pa&s;s it in the Affirmative, in favour of their own Power, that the Appeal did lye before them: Yet they did it, not as <HI>an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick</HI> but as <HI>a Civil</HI> cau&s;e. So that the Que|&s;tion, Whether an Appeal Lies from the General A&s;|&s;embly, or from the Church Judicatorie$ of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Hou&s;e of Peers, a Que&s;tion on which all our Church Priviledges depends, has not in the lea&s;t been concern d in this Affair, but remains as much in Que&s;tion as it did before.</P>
<P>This I thought nece&s;&s;ary to hint, in order to quiet the clamours, and make Ea&s;ie the Minds of &s;ome well meaning, but ra&s;h People, who think and have been too forward to &s;pread it about, That the Hou&s;e of Lords have taken cognizance of the Proceedings, or rever&s;t the Sentence of the <HI>Presbytry of Edinburgh</HI> in the ca&s;e of <HI>Green&s;hiels,</HI> and con&s;equently have by their Precedent &s;ubjected entirely the church Ju|dicatories of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the civil Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>As, &s;uch a <HI>Thing were it true,</HI> would ju&s;tly Alarm us all, and give us good Rea&s;on to Fear the Overthro' of our Eccle&s;ia&s;tick con&s;titution, &s;o nothing is of more Pernicious con&s;equence, and more de&s;tructive to our Peace, nothing can better gratify, or indeed &s;erves the Intere&s;t of our Enemys, than to have our People amu|&s;ed with, and Impo&s;ed upon to Entertain &s;uch a Re|port, when as in truth, there was no &s;uch Thing Tran&s;acted in the Hou&s;e, nay that rather by the Pro|ceedings, there &s;eems to be a tacite Conce&s;&s;ion to what we all claim (viz.) That Appeals from our Church Judicatories will not lye to the &s;aid civil Power, and
<PB N="8" REF="7">
that the Hou&s;e of&mdash;are not competent in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the rightly &s;tating this Que&s;tion, much of our pre&s;ent concern about, and Unea&s;ine&s;s at what has happened will depend; And therefore, it is the more &s;tudied by our Enemies to be concealed, and the con|trary to be Sugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Party who triumph in this Victory, are mighty willing to have it called a Victory over our Church, and to Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es our People That the Sentence of the Church again&s;t <HI>Green&s;hiels</HI> in this Ca&s;e, is Effectually Rever&s;t, That the Epi&s;copal People have from hence a Tacite Unlimited Liberty to &s;et up what Forms of Wor&s;hip, and bring in what Innovations they plea&s;e, and that the Church Judicatories are hereby Forbid|den to meddle with them, an Article which would by the &s;ame Parity of Rea&s;on Di&s;arm the Di&s;cipline, and Unhinge the Con&s;titution of our Church.</P>
<P>And the chief Rea&s;on that I can See, why they &s;trive to make this pa&s;s for Current among us, is That they may provoke, Exa&s;perate, and Pu&s;h on the le&s;s prudent part of our People to any Di&s;orders and Vio|lent Methods of Expre&s;&s;ing their Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>But when it &s;hall be &s;et before the good People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> That our Church Judicatories &s;till remain Un touch't, That the Hou&s;e of Lords notwith&s;tanding the Mock Oratory of my Lord B&mdash;and the warm En deavours of &s;ome others of our Country Men, to per|&s;wade them to fall upon us, have yet been &s;o far from touching upon the Sentence of the <HI>Presbytrie,</HI> That they did in a Manner own they had no Power to take Cognizance upon that Point, and therefore that when a Motion was made to that purpo&s;e it was rejected: When the&s;e things come to be con&s;idered by them, as the Triumphs of the one &s;ide will be greatly Le&s;&s;ened, and their hopes of making us De&s;perate be Di&s;appoint|ed;
<PB N="9" REF="8">
So I hope the Unea&s;ine&s;s of our Friends will be much abated, and they will &s;ee, That as all is not lo&s;t that is in hazard, &s;o what the&s;e People have gotten in the Victory they boa&s;t of, is not of a Con&s;equence e|quall to the Shouts and Rejoycings, they have made for it.</P>
<P>It is true, and I am very &s;orry for it, That the Re|ver&s;ing the Sentence of the Magi&s;trates, and of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion in this Ca&s;e, is a taking off in &s;ome Mea&s;ure the Edge of the Sentence of the Church, in &s;o far as the civil Magi&s;trates are of them&s;elves backward enough, and it's probable may now be more backward, to put in Execution the Cen&s;ures and Sentences of the Church, as being di&s;couraged in the doing their Duty by this Re&s;olution of the Lords.</P>
<P>But I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why this &s;hould by the Con&s;e|quence of &s;uch a Thing any more than the Lords of the Se&s;&s;ion, or the Lord Chancellor in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be backward or di&s;couraged in pur&s;uing their Senten|ces and Decrees in other Civil Matters, becau&s;e They are liable to be likewi&s;e revers'd in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>It is no que&s;tion the Duty of the Magi&s;trates ac|cording to the Act of Parliament in that Ca&s;e, Enti|tuled, <HI>An Act to oblige the Civil Magi&s;trates to put in Execution the Cen&s;ures and Sentences of the Church,</HI> to &s;tand by, and Support the Indicatories of the Church with their Authority according to Law; and they are as much under an Obligation to do it now as ever, nor could the Magi&s;trates an&s;wer it, not to do ju&s;t the &s;ame thing a <HI>Second</HI> and a <HI>Third</HI> Time if Circum&s;tan|ces concern'd, and the &s;ame offered tho' by an Appeal the other Party &s;hould every time obtain a Rever&s;e of their Seneence in the Hou&s;e of Lords; And if this were Offen&s;ive, &s;ome new Act mu&s;t be made in Parlia|ment to Limit and Direct the &s;aid Magi&s;trates in &s;uch
<PB N="10" REF="9">
a ca&s;e, but till &s;uch Law is made, the pre&s;ent Law is in Force and binds them to the &s;ame Duty as much as it did before.</P>
<P>This therefore is to be ob&s;erved, That the Peers of great Britain having con&s;idered the Commitment of <HI>Green&s;hiels</HI> and Rever&s;t it, does not at all di&s;able and con&s;equently ought not to di&s;courage any Magi&s;trate from acting in their Station according to Law, it only Extends to this particular Ca&s;e in which, whether &s;ome Omi&s;&s;ion, &s;ome Slip or &s;ome illegal Step has been made is not for me to Examine here, their Lord&s;hips not &s;uffering their proceedings to be printed, or Examin|ed in print by any Body: But if in another Ca&s;e which may come before them, &s;uch &s;lip or Omi&s;&s;ion or illegal Step can not be found, &s;uch other ca&s;e will receive no Prejudice from this.</P>
<P>This hint I think needfull on many Accounts, as well to quiet the Minds of our People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who may be Impo&s;ed upon, whether by their own Fears, or by the Artifice of others to think, That not only the Church Judicatories have been Attackt, and their Sen|tences Rever&s;t in the&s;e Proceedings, but that the civil Magi&s;trate is hereby di&s;abled from any farther &s;hare in the Executive Power and is effectually di&s;charg d from concerning him&s;elf in putting tho&s;e Cen&s;ures and Sentences in Execution.</P>
<P>There is no Que&s;tion but the Party who have &s;et <HI>Green&s;hiels</HI> to work, and have from the beginning en|couraged and &s;upported him would be very willing to have us take Things in this Sen&s;e, becau&s;e they hope it may tend to the Enraging and Exa&s;perating &s;ome Spirits among us, who may be forward to take wrong Mea&s;ures, in this ca&s;e, upon &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But as they are mi&s;taken in the thing it &s;elf, &s;o I hope they &s;hall be di&s;appointed in the de&s;ign, and the warme&s;t of our Friends, I doubt not will &s;ee rea&s;on to
<PB N="11" REF="10">
calm them&s;elves &s;o much, and Pre&s;erve their Temper in this ca&s;e, by how much it is plain, they have lo&s;t no Legal Power that they had before, nor are the Magi|&s;trates at all the le&s;s Empowered to put the Laws in Execution, by this Proceeding than they were before.</P>
<P>I am not going about to Examine in this ca&s;e, whe|ther the Hou&s;e of Lords have done us ju&s;tice or no: There is perhaps no &s;entence of any kind confirm'd or rever&s;t but the Per&s;ons who lo&s;e their cau&s;e, are apt to &s;ay or think they have not ju&s;tice done them, and if I am askt my Opinion, perhaps I may think &s;o in this ca&s;e, e&s;pecially what had been done having been Ap|proved as Law, by our Highe&s;t Court of civil ju&s;tice, and by the Act of our <HI>Privy Council,</HI> when we had one. But I am not enquiring now into what Injury we have received, or whether we have received injury or no; But into <HI>What is next &s;or us to do,</HI> What is before us, and how we ought to behave, after this Surprizing Event, both the Supporting our Rights, Di&s;charging our Duty, and Di&s;appointing our Ene|mies, who wait for our Misbehaving our &s;elves, with Eager Hopes of making &s;ome advantage of our Un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing therefore in order to our regular Conduct in this Affair, is to Examine &s;peaking of the Church; Have we lo&s;t any of our Rights? Are the hands of our Di&s;cipline weakned? Are any of our Fun|damentals Invaded? And have we received any real Damage?</P>
<P>This Que&s;tion &s;eems mo&s;t proper to be fir&s;t decid|ed, becau&s;e &s;o much of the fears of our Friends de|pends upon the Affirmative of this Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I make no &s;cruple therefore to an&s;wer in the Nega|tive, and that directly; And to make this out I &s;hall prove.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="11">
1. That no Law is repealed, by which the Power of the Rights of the Church were E|&s;tabli&s;hed or &s;upported, &s;o by the way Rever|&s;ing a &s;entence, is not repealing a Law.</P>
<P N="2">2. No Power is taken from the Church, by which it had either it's Di&s;cipline or Govern|ment &s;upported; And if any Man Invade you in your juri&s;diction, you have the &s;ame power which you had before.</P>
<P>The whole of this Matter is, there SEEMS to be a tacite Prohibition of the Magi&s;trates from the like Proceedings: I &s;ay, SEEMS, for it is no more, and as I &s;aid before, if the &s;ame Inva&s;ion of their Di&s;cipline and Government be made, they ought to do every Le|gal thing to &s;upport and maintain it, which they have done already, and if the Per&s;on be aggrieved he may as the other did, appeal. The Lords, it's true, may in|deed rever&s;e agai#, and to the&s;e Renewings, Pleadings, and Appeals will &s;eem to have no end.</P>
<P><HI>I An&s;wer,</HI> yes, They will have this End, you have your Method of Ju&s;tice pre&s;cribed by a Law; Till that Law is Repealed, tho' the Lords were to Rever&s;e the Proceedings every time, yet you mu&s;t go by the Rule pre&s;cribed, and in time perhaps the Judicature of Peers will offer &s;ome Law to regulate the&s;e proceedings, that we may know how far our Liberty may be a&s;&s;erted, and how far not.</P>
<Q><L>And the Rea&s;on lies here,</L></Q>
<P>The Proceedings of the Church are bound by the Laws. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> of God, and <HI>Then</HI> of the Nation; The Di|&s;cipline and Government of the Church are founded, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> on the Laws of God, and are <HI>Then</HI> E&s;tabli&s;ht by the Laws of our Country, which Laws are &s;ecured, and reconfirm'd to us, by the Union, and the Act of Securi|ty, made al&s;o a part of that Union.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
Now the Lords having not at all meddled with our Church Sentence, as having no Juri&s;diction over the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tick Judicatories of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which are re&s;erv'd from them by the Treaty; <HI>It mu&s;t be then,</HI> that if the Lords di&s;like the manner of the Civil Magi&s;trates put|ting in Execution the &s;aid Sentence of the Church, which by Law they are obliged to do, they mu&s;t <HI>and no doubt in time they will</HI> con&s;ider of a Law, to direct the Magi&s;trates, how and in what manner they &s;hall do their Duty in this ca&s;e; And till they do &s;o, the Ma|gi&s;trates &s;eems to me, obliged to go on in their Duty, as if no &s;uch Rever&s;s of the late Sentence again&s;t <HI>Green&s;hiels</HI> had been pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus lav'd down the Premi&s;es, I draw this Conclu&s;ion from them,</P>
<P N="1">1. We have nothing to do then, but to wait, till &s;uch a Law &s;hall be offered at in the Hou&s;e, then we &s;hall have Room to declare our Rights, &s;hew our Claim and have a fair hearing for what we &s;hall demand, and the Union will be the Te&s;t, by which the Authority the Lords have in this ca&s;e &s;hall be tryed.</P>
<P N="2">2. All the Pretences tho&s;e Gentle-Men have, for Enflaming and Exa&s;perating our People to fall upon <HI>Green&s;hiels,</HI> and his Party; If he re|news his Attempt, are taken away; For by this Rule <HI>which I am &s;ure is right,</HI> if he makes the like Attempt, he mu&s;t go the &s;ame way, to the &s;ame place, and be delivered by the &s;ame Method, as he was before; and &s;o to the end of the chapter, till the Parliament &s;hall think fit to repeal the Law, which obliges the Magi&s;trates to put in execution the Sentences and Cen&s;ures of the Church, for a Law remains always in force, till it is repealed by the &s;ame Authority which made it, and that will be hard to be found in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="13">
3. All ground for our Fears and Di&s;orders cea&s;e in this very Principle, for while your Laws are the &s;ame, and are not at all enervated, or weakned by this Decree of the Hou&s;e of Lords, then we have no more occa&s;ion to run into Exce&s;&s;es, Violence, or popular Heat, than we had before.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to wait, and <HI>look on,</HI> to &s;ee what the Enemies of our Peace will do, &s;ee what u&s;e they will venture to make of this &s;uppo&s;ed Victory: If they think by this that they are Tollerated to In&s;ult the Church&punc; and Ruffle the Magi&s;trates, contemn the Authority of the Laws, and Defy the Executive Power of the Magi&s;trates; you may &s;till in a legal way let them &s;ee they are mi&s;taken, and if they are tyred of being an|nually &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e of Lords for Redre&s;s, they mu&s;t get a Law made, to authorize them&s;elves to go on their own Way, if they can, again&s;t which Law, no que&s;tion but we &s;hall be heard.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Reverend Sir,</HI> I think all our Fears, and the &s;ur|prize of this matter may fall to the ground, and we have no rea&s;on to think of any violent Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I know we are repre&s;ented in the World as a Furi|ous, and Ungovernable People, and it is remarkable that the&s;e People who are forwarde&s;t to ca&s;t that reproach upon us are the forwarde&s;t al&s;o to try all po&s;&s;ible ways to provoke us, pu&s;hing daily at our con&s;titution, and urging us to the&s;e Violences they would lay to our Charge, as the native Crime of our Peoples Temper, and we are not without Te&s;timony, how much rather they would have <HI>Green&s;hiels</HI> di&s;turb'd by the Mob, than by the Magi&s;trates, by the Flame and Fury of the Street, than by the &s;oft Fire <HI>of the Law;</HI> and how much they appeared di&s;appointed that they could not rai&s;e Fermentation enough in the People, to bring it to pa&s;s;
<PB N="15" REF="14">
which they would have made their u&s;es of, and their Advantage over us would have appeared many ways; But the Wi&s;dom of Providence directed otherwi&s;e, and we thank God with much Rea&s;on, that they have been di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>It is true, that had our Exa&s;perated People took Fire, upon the ju&s;t Provocations, given them in that Ca&s;e of <HI>Green&s;hiels,</HI> the Crime had received much Al|leviation in this South Part of the I&s;land, from the Ex|ample of a Party here has &s;et to their Brethren, where without any Provocation on the &s;ide of the Di&s;&s;enters, the Rabbles that were rai&s;ed by the Friends of <HI>Dr. Sa|cheverel</HI> fell upon the Meeting-Hou&s;es, and ran&s;ack'd and demoli&s;hed them, and committed the accu&s;tomed Violences, that makes &s;uch Things really odious to all the Lovers of a Legal Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And I name this the rather, for that it may not only let tho&s;e People &s;ee what their Friends practi&s;e has been in like Ca&s;es; but to let us all &s;ee how De&s;tructive Mobs and Street Violences have always been, and ever will be to the Party that put them in practice, &s;ince tho&s;e very Tumults, tho' they alarm'd and &s;urpriz'd the Diffenters very much for the time, yet they had the Satisfaction of &s;eeing them condemn'd and di&s;|own'd both by her Maje&s;ty, the Parliament, and the Publick Ju&s;tice of the Nation; and not only &s;o, but tho&s;e very Mobs, and that Tumultuous Method of that Party, has tended to their own Di&s;advantage; the length that Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> and his Abbettors went in that part, having procur'd him a general Neglect and Contempt among the very People who were otherwi&s;e for him, with whom he now grows a forgotten aban|don'd Thing, not fit to be encouraged.</P>
<P>Nor could the Laws do le&s;s then Condemn the Ex|ce&s;&s;es of the People in this Ca&s;e, and therefore tho&s;e unhappy few that fall into the Hands of ju&s;tice, were

of cour&s;e &s;entenced, &s;ome to Fines, &s;ome to the Service, and others to Death, tho' her Maje&s;ty in Compa&s;&s;ion to the poor mi&s;led Wretches, was plea&s;ed to remit that Severity.</P>
<P>From hence 'tis evident, that none but the Enemies, even of <HI>Sacheverel</HI> him&s;elf, and of his Party, could be the Prompters of tho&s;e Tumults; &s;ince, on the other hand, it was Effectual to the Breach of the Na|tions Peace; &s;o it was the readie&s;t way to ruin both him and his Intere&s;t, and for this Rea&s;on, as was plain to the Government, the Reproach of tho&s;e Tumults was ju&s;tly thrown upon the Jacobites, Papi&s;ts, Non|jurors, and Enemies to her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Go|vernment.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Intere&s;t, and the &s;ame Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would rejoice to &s;ee this hone&s;t People provoked to fall into Exce&s;&s;es of the like Nature, as what they know would be infinitely to the Di&s;advantage of the Presby|terian Intere&s;t, and might in time be improved to their De&s;truction; and for this end was the Project of &s;et|ting of this de&s;picable Tool of Innovation, &s;et on foot, as is apparent from the Manner of Beginning, Carry+ing on, and Concluding it.</P>
<P>It was evident from the Connivance, and Gentle|ne&s;s of the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Epi&s;copal Party, how many of the Epi&s;copal A&s;&s;emblies are at this day &s;uffered, in many of which and in all that they think proper, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service-Book has been &s;et up; yet they have received little or no Di&s;turbance, and they knew that had <HI>Green&s;hiels</HI> thought fit to go on, as they did, he might have been wink'd at as they were; the Church having for Peace Sake, and to take off the Clamours, and pretended Complaints of their rigid Temper, which had made &s;uch Noi&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> cho&s;e rather to receive than re&s;ent an Injury.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
But this would not an&s;wer the end, which was to embroil, and enrage us, and therefore they made this Attempt, <HI>viz</HI> to Demand that of Right, which be|fore they were content to receive as <HI>a Favour.</HI></P>
<P>This they expected would have been received as the Nature of the In&s;ult required and as the manner they wen on indeed de&s;erv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> with Re&s;entment, and there wanted not Emi&s;&s;aries to go privately about, to endeavour to bring the People to do them&s;elves Ju&s;tice in an Extrajudicial Way.</P>
<P>But Providence intervened, and we wanted not Men of cooler Thoughts among us, who &s;eeing the De&s;ign, di&s;appointed it, by procuring the Addre&s;s or Petition of the Inhabitants to the Presbytery, and afterwards to the Magi&s;trates, to &s;uppre&s;s this In&s;ult by the Calm, and lei&s;urely Proceedings of the Law.</P>
<P>And why el&s;e, if Tumult and Riot had not been the De&s;ign, did they indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad Reports, that the Queen would &s;upport them, that they had her Maje&s;ty's Authority, that it was at the Reque&s;t of the Engli&s;h Officers in the Cu&s;toms, Exchequer, and the like, which was the only way to make our People be|lieve that no Civil Power would intervene, that we could not expect any Redre&s;s from the Government, and to intimidate us from applying to the legal Cour|&s;es u&s;ual in like Ca&s;es, and with all to render the En|gli&s;h Gentlemen in general odious to the People, as the Cau&s;es of an Inva&s;ion upon their Church; all which it is plain were Delu&s;ions, and forged Pretences, her Maje&s;ty having in the fir&s;t place immediately di&s;own'd

the whole De&s;ign, approved the Proceedings of the Presbytery and Magi&s;trates, and given redoubled A&s;|&s;urances to both of her Gracious Re&s;olution to main|tain the ju&s;t Rights and Liberties of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to encourage no Innovations or Inva&s;ions upon the Church: On the other hand the Engli&s;h Gentlemen, Officers, &amp;c. who bad at fir&s;t (not knowing the De&s;ign) come into a Propo&s;al made by <HI>Green&s;hiels,</HI> for &s;etting up a Meeting Hou&s;e, &amp;c. as &s;oon as ever they &s;aw into the De&s;ign, abandoned the Party, and Cancelled the Sub&s;cription they had begun; tho&s;e Gentlemen tho' they were of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in their Judgments, yet knowing better their Duty to God, and the Queen, than to be made Tools to di&s;turb the Peace, or to cover an Attack upon the Laws, the Stipulated Con&s;titution of the National Church, of which their Sovereign had declared her &s;elf the Protector, and Royal Pre&s;erver.</P>
<P>This tho' it may &s;eem a Digre&s;&s;ion, is u&s;eful to let our People &s;ee of what mighty Con&s;equence, how u&s;eful and indeed how nece&s;&s;ary it is, and has been to the Enemies of the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> to bring our People if po&s;&s;ible into Tumults, and Heats, that they may take hold of it, to ruin our Church, overturn our Con&s;titution, and at la&s;t de&s;troy both.</P>
<P>The Argument form'd upon this Di&s;covery, is in &s;hort this.</P>
<P>As it was the great View of that Party to put us out of the Government of our &s;elves in the begin|ning

of this Attempt, &s;o it appears that they aim at the &s;ame thing in every part of their Proceed|ing &s;ince.</P>

<P>As all Di&s;orders, Heats, Animo&s;ities, and Exce&s;&s;es, would then have been de&s;tructive to the publick e&s;tabli&s;h't Peace, both of the Church and State; and would ha' been improved to the Di&s;advantage of the Presbyterian Intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland: So it will now.</HI></P>

I need not Enlarge here upon the Natural Inferences from hence <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it is our Intere&s;t&punc; with Calm|ne&s;s and Prudence, to wait and give our Enemies no ad|vantage over us by our un&s;ea&s;onable Re&s;entment of Injuries, by our being more apprehen&s;ive than we need to be of their Power to do us farther harm, and by our being too much Allarm'd at the Con&s;equences of what has happened, much le&s;s by breaking out into Violen|ces, Breaches of the Peace, and Tumultuous doing our &s;elves ju&s;tice, in ca&s;e of farther Inva&s;ion of our Rights, as if by this Action of the Lords, we were &s;hut out from the due Reparation of the Law, and being not to expect ju&s;tice from the Executive Power, were brought to the Nece&s;&s;ity of doing our &s;elves right, in a Summary way by Riot and Rabble.</P>
<P>This would be to fly in the Face of the Law, which is our Protection, and of the Queen, who is our gracious and Soveraign Protector, we have her Maje&s;ty's Sacred Promi&s;e to protect the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in all her Rights and Priviledges, <HI>According to the &V;nion:</HI> Nor are we affraid of any ambiguous Con&s;truction of that word, <HI>Accor|ding to the &V;nion,</HI> we know our Rights and Privi|ledges are <HI>According to,</HI> and <HI>E&s;tabli&s;h'd by the &V;NION,</HI> and the Union is &s;o Explicite in that E&s;tabli&s;hment, that we are not to be frighted with Explications: <HI>But that is by the way.</HI></P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty I &s;ay is the gracious Protector of our Priviledges, as well Sacred as Civil; and is &s;o to our Church, by her Royal Promi&s;e, as well as by the Title of being our Soveraign; But her

<P>Great will be the Confu&s;ion and Di&s;appointment of your Enemies, if none of the&s;e Things &s;hould happen; from the Hopes of the&s;e Things they promi&s;e them|&s;elves great Advantages, even in this A&s;&s;embly; their Eyes are upon you, they watch for your halting, and they &s;tand ready to take you at the fir&s;t Slip you make; all their Agents and Emi&s;&s;aries are at work among you to rai&s;e Fends, to fill the Peoples Heads with Fears, to foment Jealou&s;ies, to make you believe you are given up to De&s;truction, and that the Government is re&s;ol|ved to break in upon you.</P>
<P>Su&s;pend your Belief of the&s;e Things, and wi&s;ely di|&s;tingui&s;h between a Party bu&s;ie to invade you, and the Governments Concurring to their Endeavours; that you have Enemies at work to undermine and over|throw you; that they hate and malign you, are envious and enraged at your E&s;tabli&s;hment, and yet more at the late Incorporating that E&s;tabli&s;hment into the Uni|on; this no Body doubts; nor am I going to per&s;wade you otherwi&s;e, much le&s;s to advi&s;e you to be &s;ecure, and carele&s;s, as if it was for ever out of the Power of the&s;e Enemies to hurt you.</P>

But while the Queen and the Government not only are Concerned in our &s;afety, but while both give us repeated A&s;&s;urances, that they will Protect us in the Enjoyments of our ju&s;t Rights, and Encourage no In|novations or Inva&s;ions upon us, <HI>While this is our Ca&s;e,</HI> it would be the Wilde&s;t thing in the World, not to do all that lay in our Power, to Engage and Oblige her Maje&s;ty and the Government, to continue that Fa|vour and Protection, on which under God we &s;o much depend.</P>
<P>This no way interferes with the &s;tricte&s;t Adherence to every <HI>Punctilio</HI> of our legall Rights, it no way Di|ve&s;ts us of our Liberty to defend our &s;elves by Law again&s;t all the Enchroachments of our Enemies, nor will it at all weaken that Defence.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, this will not only di&s;appoint our Enemies, and &s;trengthen our hands, by Engaging the Govern|ment in our Defence; But it will be the Glory of our Church, and the Honour of our Mini&s;ters, as Men of Chri&s;tianity, as Men of Wi&s;dom, Men of Prudence, and Men of Temper, for ever removing the Re|proach, which has unju&s;tly been ca&s;t upon us, and Convince the World That it has been an Unju&s;t Reproach.</P>
<P>I may add this will Di&s;courage the Expectations of our Forreign Enemies, in their hopes of Introducing the Pretender, Hopes rai&s;ed upon a Sugge&s;tion, that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> were &s;o Di&s;gu&s;ted at tho&s;e Proceedings, as the Con&s;equences of, and which we are &s;ubjected to, by the UNION, That they would readily joyn

with any Body, that they might Expect would Di&s;|&s;olve it.</P>
<P>But if under all the ill U&s;age of the Church, by her private Enemies, we appear Zealous for, and &s;incere in her Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t; Calm and Compo&s;ed in our publick A&s;&s;emblys, Moderate in our Mea&s;ures and Re|&s;olutions, Wi&s;e and Prudent in our Councils, and Una|nimous in Defence of our Queen and Country again&s;t a popi&s;h <HI>Pretender,</HI> we &s;hall confirm her Maje&s;ty in the Belief, that &s;he has not be&s;towed her Favour and Protection upon an U&s;ele&s;s and an Unthankfull people, and our Epi&s;copal Di&s;turbers, like the <HI>Duke of Anjou</HI> at the late Battle in <HI>Spain,</HI> will have gained the Victory, but ha' lo&s;t the Day.</P>
