<HEAD>THE JUST COMPLAINT OF THE POOR WEAVERS REPRESENTED, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN an Enemy is conquer'd in the Field, we never want People at home to kill them over again: Clamour is &s;o u&s;e|ful a Weapon in the modern Way of Party-Fighting among us, that I do not at all wonder, that in the Ca&s;e of the poor <HI>Weavers,</HI> our Scribblers take Ad|vantage to fall upon them after the <HI>le&s;s|barharous</HI> Train'd-bands have done with them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
The Bu&s;ine&s;s is plain, the poor Men were fir&s;t wrong in rai&s;ing a Tumult, that's certain. Secondly, they were <HI>BEATEN,</HI> that's as certain; and therefore, <HI>which by the way is excellent Pamphlet Logick,</HI> they have not the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to complain; but mu&s;t be all tax'd with a Guilt which they have no Hand in, and even tho&s;e that were not in the Vice mu&s;t be run down, as if they had no Grievance to cry out of, and that all the Pretences of the <HI>Weavers</HI> in General were, as the well-bred Author of the &s;candalous Pamphlet which we are now con&s;idering, calls it, <HI>villainous</HI> and <HI>bruti&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>It is however the Felicity of a ju&s;t Cau&s;e that its Oppo&s;ers are generally driven to two mo&s;t &s;candalous Shifts: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to a Refuge of Fal&s;ities for Argument. And <HI>Se|condly,</HI> to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Railing, and giving foul Language to &s;upport it. The Author of <HI>The Pretences of the</HI> Weavers <HI>examin'd</HI> falls into both the&s;e; and that in the mo&s;t notorious manner, and be|trays at once both his Want of Argu|ment, and Want of Manners.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, he &s;ays,</HI> the Complaint of the <HI>Weavers</HI> can only be known by their mur|muring in Corners, and their riotous Acti|ons in the open Street. And then <HI>Secondly,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
He gives their Di&s;orders in the Street the Epithet of Bruti&s;h and Villainous.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do with his ill Lan|guage, which after the Men are &s;uppre&s;s'd, and in the Hands of the Law, is but a cowardly In&s;ult; and of which I only &s;ay this, that tho' I abhor Mobbs of all &s;orts, and am far from ju&s;tifying the Exorbitan|ces of tho&s;e poor Men, whom Oppre&s;&s;ion may have &s;ome Hand in making mad, yet I think they are rather Objects of our Pity, as I hope they will be of the Government's Clemency.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t take up our in&s;ulting Gen|tlemen a little <HI>upon his fir&s;t Head;</HI> for tho' I agree that the <HI>Weavers</HI> have no ju&s;tifia|ble Rea&s;on to rebel. I mu&s;t not &s;ay, <HI>or let him &s;ay unreproved,</HI> that they have no Rea|&s;on to complain: And when this Writer tells us, <HI>that their Complaint can only be known by their Murmuring in Corners, and Riots in the Streets;</HI> he takes a great deal of Pains to tell the World that he really knows nothing at all of the Matter. For nothing is more true than this, that the Complaint of the <HI>Spittle-Fields Weavers,</HI> not at all to excu&s;e the Extreme they have carry'd it to, is <HI>a National Grievance,</HI> a Thing, Trade groans under, and which if not &s;peedily redre&s;s'd, our Woollen Manufa|ctures
<PB N="6" REF="7">
all over <HI>Britain</HI> will in time &s;ink under; and had the&s;e poor Men not been &s;o over-pre&s;s'd by their Mi&s;eries, as to break out into Riot and Tumult, which no Man can excu&s;e them in: We &s;hould have known the Matter of this Complaint very &s;oon from other Hands, by a ju&s;t and regular Application to tho&s;e who&s;e Right it is to hear the Complaints of the People, and who&s;e Glory as well as Privilege it is to be able to redre&s;s them; and it is very hard the <HI>Drapers</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Jobbers, who have thus employ'd a Mercenary to rail, &s;hould go about to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the Na|tion in Prejudice of &s;o ju&s;t a Complaint a|gain&s;t their own Encroachments, while the whole Body of the Trading Part of the Kingdom are concern'd &s;o nearly in the Matter; and while all our Manufa|ctures are in the utmo&s;t Danger from the Encroachment of an up&s;tart Importa|tion of Foreign Goods which by the Folly of our Women is grown up even to a Trade-Plague among us, infects our Inland Commerce, and makes the Home-Con&s;umption of our own Manufa|cture langui&s;h and decay in &s;uch a manner, as bids fair to &s;tarve our Poor, and put the whole Woollen Trade of this Nation, which is &s;o con&s;iderable, and on which
<PB N="7" REF="8">
we &s;o much depend, into the utmo&s;t Con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible this Man can tell us, that the wearing &s;o many printed Callicoes, is the Cau&s;e of the Complaint of the <HI>Wea|vers?</HI> And yet at the &s;ame Time tell us, we &s;hould have known nothing of it, but from their Murmuring and Riots! And is it po&s;&s;ible that he can have the Face to &s;ay, that the wearing of Callicoes is the Cau&s;e of their Complaint, and yet at the &s;ame Time &s;ay, their Complaint is not ju&s;t? When he cannot be ignorant, that the Com|plaint again&s;t the printed Callicoes, is the Complaint of the whole Nation; not the particular Complaint of <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> with this Difference and no other; that &s;ome of the poorer Sort of <HI>Weavers</HI> in <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> have been le&s;s Patient, and perhaps that too, becau&s;e more &s;everely pinch'd by the want of their Employment, than the other Manufactures; and becau&s;e their Sub&s;i&s;tence here in <HI>London,</HI> not being &s;o ea&s;y as in other Places, they were le&s;s able to &s;upport the want of Work.</P>
<P>How ab&s;urdly then do they argue, who would confine the Grievance of <HI>this Calli|coe Plague,</HI> for I can can call it no le&s;s, to the poor <HI>Weavers</HI> in <HI>Spittle-Fields;</HI> as if, becau&s;e the re&s;t of the <HI>Weavers</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI> have been le&s;s riotous and tumultous, therefore that the wearing of Callicoes, as Callicoes are now worn, was no Grievance to them; or that they were le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the de|cay of their Manufactures, and the ap|proaching Ruin of their Trade, for their being &s;ilent and dutifully &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, till a proper Time comes to &s;peak; this is fir&s;t, intimating, that the Callicoes as now worn, are no Grievance, which any Man of com|mon Sen&s;e would be a&s;ham'd to &s;ay; and &s;econdly it &s;ugge&s;ts, which for ought I know may be true; that if the Country <HI>Weavers</HI> and Manufacturers, were as una|ble to &s;upport the decay of their Trade, as the <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> Men are, they would be as riotous as they.</P>
<P>It is indeed &s;carce worth while to med|dle with &s;uch weak and ab&s;urd Things, as for the &s;ake of Clamour are mu&s;ter'd up by this Author, as well as by others, in their common Di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t the poor <HI>Weavers:</HI> But according to <HI>Solomon,</HI> a Fool is &s;ometimes to be an&s;wer'd ac|cording to his Folly, that he be not Wi&s;e in his own Conceit; that is to &s;ay, his Folly is to be expos'd as it de&s;erves; that others may make him the &s;ubject of their Je&s;t, and he may at la&s;t, be made a&s;ham'd of him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
This is exactly the Ca&s;e here, our wi&s;e Author has affirm'd; &s;ome &s;uch plain and notorious Fal&s;ities, and &s;uch &s;elf-contra|dicting ignorant Things, that they want to be expos'd indeed, that the Gentlemen who &s;et him to work may &s;ee how ill their Advocate has manag'd their bad Cau&s;e, and how like one that clean&s;es a Blur with blotted Fingers, he has made the better &s;ide the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, he pleads Liberty and Property; I confe&s;s I have &s;een an ill U&s;e made of the Claim of Liberty in <HI>England</HI> before now, but never knew it debauch'd in &s;o gro&s;s, &s;o vile a manner before; <Q>&startq;&endq;What &s;ignifies, &s;ays he, all our Riches, and that Liberty and Property that we &s;o ju&s;tly boa&s;t of, except we have the Liberty of Eating and Drinking, or Wearing what we plea&s;e, and Thinking or Believing what we plea&s;e?</Q></P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for Argument-&s;ake, this Man's Demand of exorbitant Liberty granted to be ju&s;t, and how unju&s;t then are all &s;umptuary Laws, all Prohibitions of any Kind in Trade; why do we prohibit Sugar from <HI>Portugal,</HI> Silks from <HI>India,</HI> Wine and Brandy from <HI>France,</HI> and why are any Laws made to regulate our Morals and Manners? Such an Argument was
<PB N="10" REF="11">
never offer'd to Men of Sen&s;e in this World. Certainly Re&s;traint from doing ill, is the greate&s;t and be&s;t Part of a Peo|ple's Privilege.</P>
<P><Q><L>"Re&s;traint from Ill is Freedom to the Wi&s;e.</L></Q>
As it is in Morality, &s;o it is in Policy; and as it is in Policy, &s;o it is in Trade; to be prohibited from Wearing that, which in its U&s;e hinders the Con&s;umption, and threatens the De&s;truction of our own Pro|duce, is a kind and obliging Re&s;traint, and only amounts to a directing us to do, what as wi&s;e Men we ought to be &s;up|pos'd de&s;irous of doing, <HI>to wit,</HI> forward|ing the Pro&s;perity of our Country, the Trade and Manufactures of the Nation, with the Employment and Encourage|ment of our Poor to the utmo&s;t of our Power; a Thing which every Man that has any Regard to the Pro&s;perity of the Kingdom, and the Good of the People, will think him&s;elf oblig'd to do, tho' he were not limited to it by the Laws.</P>
<P>To pretend to act injuriou&s;ly to the Publick Good on Pretence of Liberty, is &s;omething like a &s;ick Grenadier in <HI>Cata|lonia,</HI> who having eaten Grapes contrary
<PB N="11" REF="12">
to the General's Command, who prohi|bited the Soldiers eating Grapes, becau&s;e they threw them into Fluxes and other Di&s;ea&s;es; boldly told the General, he was a free-born <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, and thought he had a Right to the Liberty of killing him|&s;elf whenever he pleas'd.</P>
<P>Why was an Act of Parliament made but the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, forbidding any Trade&s;men keeping a Quantity of Gun-Powder near the City of <HI>London?</HI> Ought not every Man to have the Liberty to put what Goods he plea&s;es into his own Hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Much more might be &s;aid to this great Lover of Liberty, but it is not worth while; he is, I perceive a <HI>true Libertine,</HI> for he carries it to the height; he is for a Liberty of eating and drinking whatever, and I &s;uppo&s;e AS MUCH as he plea&s;es; and to let you know he is a <HI>Free-Thinker</HI> too, he adds, That our Li|berty# &s;ignifies nothing, unle&s;s we may believe and think what we plea&s;e too; which by the way, is much to the Purpo&s;e in a Di&s;pute about <HI>Weavers</HI> wan|ting Work, Women wearing Callicoes, and the like. I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this, by tel|ling this Lover of Liberty, that he might aswell, and as ju&s;tly argue, that Men
<PB N="12" REF="13">
to have the liberty to do what they will, as well as to eat and drink, and to wear what they will. But I come to the Mat|ter in hand, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The Weavers <HI>wanting Work, and the Callicoes being the Cau&s;e of it.</HI></P>
<P>Both the&s;e he would &s;ain deny: But Truth &s;tarting him in the Face, he faulters in the Fir&s;t, and is bound to acknow|ledge, tho' as lamely as he can, <HI>That &s;ome of them do want Work.</HI> Now we will yield to him here, and &s;eeing we cannot get the whole Truth to be acknowledg'd, we will take what we can get, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That all of them <HI>(the Weavers)</HI> have not Work, or in <HI>Engli&s;h, Some of them do want Work.</HI> Now not to enter into the Examination of what he means by <HI>Some,</HI> I offer it thus, That more of them are without Work, than have been without it &s;ince the Time that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Prin|ted Callicoes were prohibited; and I &s;hall add, that as the printing them here met with Encouragement, &s;o in Proportion, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures declin'd and de|cay'd, and &s;o as the Manufactures de|cay'd, the <HI>Weavers,</HI> who are the Manu|facturers decay'd of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>This Thing is not only to be believ'd, but is capable of Demon&s;tration, and will
<PB N="13" REF="14">
I doubt not, be demon&s;trated in its pro|per Time and Place, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The prohibi|ting the Importation of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Prin|ted Callicoes and Silks, in the Year 1701. &s;en&s;ibly recover'd and re&s;tor'd; the <HI>Wea|vers</HI> who at that time were in a mo&s;t mi|&s;erable ruin'd Condition, by rea&s;on of the Lo&s;s of their Employment, that Trade being manife&s;tly &s;unk by the general U&s;e of painted Callicoes and Silks.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Parliament in their great Concern for the poor Manufacturers, en|quir'd into the Cau&s;e of their Complaints, they found them very ju&s;t, and that the exorbitant U&s;e of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Manufa|ctures, had greatly injur'd and impove|ri&s;h'd our own; upon which they found, that it was a mo&s;t ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Re|que&s;t of the Manufacturers, to have a Re|&s;traint put upon the U&s;e of the &s;aid for|reign Goods, and accordingly the Prohi|bition was pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P>'Tis ea&s;y to demon&s;trate the Ju&s;tice of the Demand, by the Con&s;equence of the Grant; no &s;ooner was the Prohibiti|on granted, but the Manufactures reviv'd, the <HI>Weavers</HI> recover'd, the abandon'd Streets were peopled, the Inhabitants who were fled to &s;eek Bread by other Em|ployments, returnd; <HI>Spittle-Fields,</HI> that
<PB N="14" REF="15">
look'd before like a for&s;aken Place, and was growing apace into a Wilderne&s;s, be|came fertile, and was fill'd with Inhabi|tants like a populous City; nay, the Numbers exceeding the Extent of the Place, they &s;pread them&s;elves to <HI>Hoxton,</HI> to <HI>Bednal-Green,</HI> to <HI>Stepney,</HI> to <HI>Southwark,</HI> to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and to <HI>Norwich,</HI> and no i|dle Hands were found among them.</P>
<P>It would fill a long Hi&s;tory to give an Account of the vi&s;ible Difference which this Prohibition of Callicoes, made on the Countenance of Trade; and how innu|merable Families by their Dilligence and and Application grew rich in the manu|facturing of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods.</P>
<P>But, as if this Nation was never to want a Set of Men to undo her; no &s;ooner were the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Chints and printed Callicoes prohibited from abroad, but &s;ome of <HI>Britain</HI>'s unnatural Children, who we call <HI>Drapers,</HI> &s;et all their Arts to work to evade the Law of Prohibition, to employ People to mimick the more ingenious <HI>Indians;</HI> and to legitimate the Grievance, by making it a Manufacture: After which to clench the Point again&s;t the Manufacturers, and perpetuate the Grie|vance, they prompted the laying a Tax upon the Improvement, &s;o to make a
<PB N="15" REF="16">
Fund of the Oppre&s;&s;ion, and entail it on their Country for Ever.</P>
<P>As this &s;ucce&s;sful Mi&s;chief encreas'd, the Vanity of the People falling in with it, the <HI>Weavers</HI> and Manufacturers &s;oon felt the Effect of it; and as the re&s;train|ing the Callicoes had rais'd them, as a|bove, &s;o the opening a new Sluice which let them in again, immediately affected the Con&s;umption of our own Goods; Trade immediately felt a &s;en&s;ible Decay, and the <HI>Weavers</HI> Ruin came gradually on; the Callicoes and the Woollen Manufa|ctures being like two Ballances, when one Scale went down, the other went up, and when one went up, the other came down.</P>
<P>Let any one that can &s;upport it with Rea&s;on, oppo&s;e this fair State of the <HI>Ca|lico</HI> Ca&s;e, if they can? And let our Au|thor's affirming that the wearing of Calli|coes is not the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Weavers</HI> want of Work, be &s;et in Compo&s;ition with it, &s;or impartial Judges to determine of it.</P>
<P>To expo&s;e the poor <HI>Weavers,</HI> and make their Complaint for want of Work appear more unju&s;t, this wi&s;e Author tells us of a Publication in the <HI>Daily Cou|rant,</HI> by which Notice was given that all
<PB N="16" REF="17">
tho&s;e <HI>Weavers</HI> as were willing to work might be employ'd by &s;uch and &s;uch Men, at <HI>Hoxton, Reading,</HI> and other Places, in making of Sails. This was a good Pub|lication for the Proprietors of the Sail-Cloth-Work in tho&s;e Places to cry them up for Patriots, make their Undertaking popular, and bring down the Price of their Journey-men. But let any one that under&s;tands the Nature of Weaving, and the particular Works Men are brought up to, and capable of performing, judge of the Thing. How can they &s;uppo&s;e, that Men always u&s;ed to work in Silk or Wor&s;ted, could on a &s;udden turn their Hands to make Sail-cloath; for tho', it all be call'd Weaving, yet there is as much Difference between the one and the other, almo&s;t as between any two Trades; be&s;ides, I am inform'd, that &s;e|veral of our Men have been there to &s;ee for Work, and could not get any, but were told, that it was not Silk or Wor|&s;ted <HI>Weavers</HI> they wanted, but Linnen <HI>Weavers.</HI> So that this is but a meer Blu|&s;ter, contriv'd as above, to render the poor Men odious, and the&s;e &s;ham Patriots popular.</P>
<P>The Author in the next Place carries on a great way his In&s;inuations in favour
<PB N="17" REF="18">
of the Calicoes, and let us mark one of his Arguments to illu&s;trate his Judgment in the Que&s;tion, that is, in his 10th Page, where he &s;ays, our Silk Manufactures are as much a forreign Commodity as the Callicoes printed here. The fir&s;t Thing he &s;ays to confirm this, is, to tell us, that mo&s;t of the Callicoes are made in our OWN COLONIES in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> This wretched Piece of Trade-Non&s;en&s;e, either &s;hews the Capacity and Sen&s;e of the Writer, or his want of Hone&s;ty; to impo&s;e &s;uch Stuff upon us, and may inform the World, how little the oppo|&s;ers of the <HI>Weavers</HI> have to &s;ay for their Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The true Ca&s;e is, that this poor ig|norant Writer, does not under&s;tand the difference between a <HI>Colony,</HI> and a <HI>Factory,</HI> and that there is no &s;uch Thing as a <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Colony in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> Had we a Colony there, &s;uch as <HI>New England, New York, Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c. are in <HI>America;</HI> where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People being planted, the Callicoes were made by the King's own Subjects, and the Cotton was the produce of the Land in the &s;aid Colony; where the &s;aid Land is always reckon'd a Part of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions; and where the Natives are the King's Subjects, tho'
<PB N="18" REF="19">
not <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as the Slaves are in our Co|lonies of <HI>Jamaica, Barbadoes,</HI> and other Places; had we, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> &s;uch Colonies in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> more had been to be &s;aid for the Callicoes made there.</P>
<P>But the Nature of a Factory is quite a|nother thing; for a Factory is no more than a Settlement for Commerce, by the permi&s;&s;ion of the King, or Government, or People of the Country: It is true, that &s;ometimes Forts and Strengths are built in &s;uch Countries, either by Permi&s;|&s;ion of the Governour of tho&s;e Countries, as on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar, Coromandel, Sumatra,</HI> and other Places in <HI>India;</HI> or by Force, as on the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t</HI> in <HI>Africk;</HI> but in neither of the&s;e is there any Colony, much le&s;s any Manufacture made there by our own People.</P>
<P>To &s;ay then, that the Callicoes are made in our Colonies in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> is the mo&s;t ignorant Piece of Confidence that I have ever met with, and to argue from thence, that therefore we mu&s;t admit them to the ruin of our Trade, and &s;tarving our Poor, is as far from Sen&s;e as the other is from Truth. But had it been true, that they had been made in our Colonies, that is to &s;ay, by our own People, <HI>for the Pro|duce of our Colonies is our own Produce;</HI> yet,
<PB N="19" REF="20">
as they are the De&s;truction of our Trade, and the Ruin of our Poor, they ought to have been prohibited; as we are told Coals are to be found in the County of <HI>Middle|&s;ex,</HI> but are not allow'd to be wrought, becau&s;e of the Ruin of the Navigation, which would be the Con&s;equence; or as we are by Law prohibited from Planting Tobacco in <HI>England,</HI> that the mo&s;t advan|tageous Trade of Tobacco by <HI>Virginia</HI> may not be lo&s;t; for it is the Practice not of our Nation only, but of all wi&s;e Nations; not to let any Branch of their Commerce interfere with another, and to &s;uppre&s;s the Increa&s;e of one Thing when it is de&s;tructive to another; &s;o that the Ca&s;e would be the &s;ame in the Callicoes, tho' they were the Product of our own Country, and the Ma|nufacture of our own People.</P>
<P>This effectually takes off all the Pre|tences which can be made for the Calli|coes, becau&s;e of their being printed at Home, and &s;o being to be call'd our own Manufacture, for in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, the &s;maller Manufactures are to give way to the great; the new invented ones are to yield to the ancient Standard, and always tho&s;e Manufactures are to be preferr'd, which employ mo&s;t People, or con&s;ume the mo&s;t of the National Produce; of
<PB N="20" REF="21">
which innumerable In&s;tances are to be gi|ven, that would be fully parallel to this, were this urg'd to be a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture, which we deny.</P>
<P>Thus I think the chief Allegations of the <HI>Drapers</HI> and their Agent are fully an|&s;wer'd, and it is &s;ufficiently prov'd that the Wearing of Callicoes is the Cau&s;e of the mi&s;erable Decay of our Trade, and of the <HI>Weavers</HI> wanting Employment; and al&s;o that the&s;e Callicoes are not the Ma|nufacture of our own Fellow-Subjects ei|ther at Home or Abroad, the Printing&punc; &amp;c. only excepted.</P>
<P>But we have &s;till more of this Author's ill-twi&s;ted Arguments, to take Notice of; he tells us, the Wearing of Printed Calli|coes cannot be the Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Weavers</HI> wanting Work, &s;o far as it re&s;pects the Woollen and Wor&s;ted <HI>Weavers,</HI> for then the undeniable Con&s;equence would be the Fall of the Price of Wool, and the making it a Drug at Market; and to clench this, he affirms that, at the End of it, which he cannot prove, and is in Fact fal&s;e, <HI>(viz.) That Wool is dearer and &s;carcer at Market for tho&s;e two Years pa&s;t, than it has been in many Years before.</HI></P>
<P>He that affirms this, ought to prove it, and he ought to have told us fairly, what

Price Wool bore now at Market, and what Price it bore three or four Years ago; which having not done, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with telling him, that tho' I did not know the Fact to be fal&s;e, yet I ought to charge him with it, as fal&s;e, be|cau&s;e he has not prov'd it to be true.</P>
<P>But to come nearer to the Point, I referr the impartial Reader to enquire in <HI>Black|well-Hall,</HI> and in the Ware-hou&s;es of all the Whole&s;ale Dealers in the Wool|len Manufactures, and let tho&s;e Ware-hou&s;es an&s;wer, the Que&s;tion, whether there is not an univer&s;al Glut of all our Ma|nufactures at Market? And whether in &s;pite of the known and general Pro&s;perity of our Affairs abroad, there is not a great Damp upon our Manufactures, and the Demand exceedingly le&s;&s;en'd, and how &s;hould the <HI>Weavers</HI> have a full Employ, when the Goods they &s;ell have not a full Con&s;umption, but lies upon Hand un&s;old? And this I in&s;i&s;t upon, is a more regular and more certain Rule to judge by, than that of the Wool, which has another Inci|dent attending it, by which we may ac|count for its Dearne&s;s, tho' there was an univer&s;al Want of Work among all the Manufacturers in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that is, the exce&s;&s;ive De&s;truction of our Com|merce,
<PB N="22" REF="23">
and Wa&s;te of our Wool by clan|de&s;tine Exportation in &s;pite of the be&s;t Laws, and the greate&s;t Application po&s;&s;i|ble to prevent it.</P>
<P>Let him a&s;&s;ure us, no Wool &s;hall be ex|ported and run into <HI>France,</HI> and then if the Price holds up, and the Quantity is &s;carce at Market, it would argue &s;ome|thing in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, but otherwi&s;e it cannot.</P>
<P>Such an Argument as this can never be upheld, but by a Chain of Ab&s;urdities, and Fal&s;ities, and &s;uch we have before us; for in the next Place he undertakes to prove, that the Wearing of Callicoes does not hin|der the wearing either of Woollen or Silk, and, <HI>he lays,</HI> the Prices prove it as follows.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Be&s;ide, the Prices of Printed Callicoes do &s;o very far exceed the Prices of Woollen or Wor&s;ted Stuffs, that they do not interfere with them; for tho&s;e that buy Stuffs, buy them for their Cheapne&s;s, which I'm &s;ure cannot be &s;aid of tho&s;e that buy Callicoes; of which Truth our Wives make us &s;en&s;i|ble to our Co&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And as to the Silk-Weaving, the Price of Callicoe is as much below that of Silk, that it cannot be truly &s;aid that Callicoes hinder the Wearing of Silk;
<PB N="23" REF="24">
and it's very likely that many of tho&s;e that buy Callicoe, wou'd not buy any Thing el&s;e in&s;tead of it, if there was no &s;uch Thing in being as Callicoe; being induced to buy more for the &s;ake of Variety, than any Occa&s;ion they have for it.</Q></P>
<P>Nothing but the A&s;&s;urance of &s;uch an Author as this could run &s;uch a Length, for by this Notion the Callicoes are too dear to hinder the Woollen, and too cheap to hinder the Silk, and there is not a Piece of Wor&s;ted Goods, or Silk Goods made the le&s;s for them! this is &s;uch a Height of Arrogance, as I believe no Age, no Hi|&s;tory, no Man's Memory can &s;hew me the like; and as it is to be contradicted by almo&s;t every one that walks the Street, there is really little left for me to do, but to <HI>wonder at his Face:</HI> I need &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>It is plain to every one's Under&s;tanding, and the very <HI>Weavers</HI> and Sellers of Calli|coes will acknowledge it; that all the mean People, the Servant-Maids, and in|differently poor People, who would other|wi&s;e cloath them&s;elves, and were u&s;ually cloathed in thin Womens Stuffs made at <HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> or in Cantaloons and Crapes, &amp;c. are now cloath'd in Cal|licoe
<PB N="24" REF="25">
or Printed Linnen; mov'd to it as well for the Cheapne&s;s, as the Lightne&s;s of the Cloth, and Gaiety of the Colours: The Children univer&s;ally, who&s;e Frocks and Coats were all either made of Tammies work'd at <HI>Coventry,</HI> or of &s;trip'd thin Stuffs made in <HI>Spittlefields,</HI> appear now in Printed Callicoe or Printed Linnen; let any one but ca&s;t their Eyes among the Children of the meaner Sort playing in the Streets, or of the better Sort at Boarding Schools, and in our Families; the Truth, is too plain to be deny'd.</P>
<P>As to the richer Sort of People, Ladies and even Per&s;ons of Quality, the fine Chints and Painted Callicoes, as well <HI>In|dia</HI> as <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ome of which are even dearer than Silk, have &s;o far &s;uper&s;eded the Wearing of Silks, that they preferr them to the fine&s;t Damasks; and we need do no more than appeal to the <HI>Drapers</HI> Wives, &s;ome of whom would perhaps think them&s;elves affronted not to be rank'd with the be&s;t of our Gentry.</P>
<P>I might take Notice here, how the Ex|ample of our Gentry was perhaps the fir&s;t real Occa&s;ion of the Callicoes being &s;o uni|ver&s;ally accepted, and worn among the common People, for as there is an invin|cible Pride in the ordinary People, of being
<PB N="25" REF="26">
counted what they are not, they are almo&s;t led into all their Fa&s;hions in Imitation of the Gentry; and therefore tho' it might be true that &s;ome Ladies of Quality do wear Callicoes more for the &s;ake of Va|riety than any Thing el&s;e, yet the meaner &s;ort of People were fir&s;t brought to wear them more, becau&s;e they &s;aw them worn by the Gentry, then for any Con|veniency, or real Liking they had to them at fir&s;t them&s;elves; that is to &s;ay, they wear them becau&s;e it was the Fa&s;hion to do &s;o.</P>
<P>To &s;ay then that no body wears Calli|coes but as a Superfluity, and that they do not buy the fewer Cloaths of Stuff or Silk, is too gro&s;s a Fal&s;ity to de&s;erve a Re|ply, except &s;uch a one as good Manners to the Readers of this forbids me to mention.</P>
<P>It would move us to &s;ome Laughter, to hear this Author talk next of the many thou&s;and Families which are employ'd in the Printing, and as he calls it <HI>Manufactu|ring the Callicoes over again</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who he &s;eems much concern'd for, and would recommend to our Compa&s;&s;ion, as Per&s;ons not to be impoveri&s;h'd or depriv'd of their Bu&s;ine&s;s and Employment; but this charitable good Chri&s;tian does not remem|ber that at the &s;ame time he is for &s;tarving

the innumerable Families of poor <HI>Weavers</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Callicoe-Printers.</HI> Now, as to the&s;e great Numbers, I am well a&s;|&s;ur'd by tho&s;e who have made it their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to go thro' the whole Trade and exa|mine it, that the utmo&s;t Numbers of Fa|milies that can be reckon'd up by the mo&s;t impartial Men, as employ'd in the Trade of Printing and Managing the &s;aid Callicoes, come to &s;ome le&s;s than &s;even hundred; whereas the Families of <HI>Weavers</HI> and <HI>Manufacturers</HI> here in <HI>London,</HI> and in the &s;everal Countries where they were em|ploy'd in Work, which this Printing of Callicoes is particularly prejudicial to, a|mounts to above a hundred thou&s;and; be|&s;ides, that this la&s;t, is a Work of but ye&s;ter|day, and &s;o modern, that very few of tho&s;e few Per&s;ons employ'd in it were originally brought up to it, but acquir'd it by Habit, having mo&s;t of them been bred up to o|ther Works, which it is ea&s;y for them to re-a&s;&s;ume; &s;o that were the Numbers e|qual, yet the unhinging the <HI>Callicoe-Prin|ters</HI> who are &s;o few, and have other Em|ployment, can be no way equal, or &s;o much as to be named with the unhinging the <HI>Weavers,</HI> and &s;ending their Families like a Flood of Beggars to over-&s;pread the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">
In the next place we find, he is as ill a Merchant as he is a Manufacturer, as ap|pears by a mo&s;t &s;candalous Fal&s;hood af|firm'd by him in the Ca&s;e of the Importers of Silk, <HI>the Silks that we import,</HI> &s;ays this knowing Author, <HI>whether wrought or un|wrought: We buy at dear Rates of Fo|reigners, either with Money or Bills of Ex|change, which is the &s;ame Thing in Effect to the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>This Paragraph is utterly fal&s;e, for we buy Silk as cheap as any other Nation can buy it, and that neither with Money or Bills of Exchange for the far greate&s;t Part, but with our own Commodities as was before-mention'd.</P>
<P>One would have thought being to ap|pear in Print in &s;o weighty a Ca&s;e, he &s;hould have thought fit to have con&s;ulted &s;ome of the <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants, and at lea&s;t have ask'd them whether they buy their Raw Silks with meer Money and Bills of Exchange? Or whether they do not purcha&s;e tho&s;e Silks with the Produce of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures? Then he would have been taught better, than to a&s;&s;ert a Thing &s;o fal&s;e and ab&s;urd in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But to leave the le&s;&s;er Cavils and Rail|leries of this Repre&s;entative of the <HI>Weavers</HI> Enemies, I come to the grand Objection
<PB N="28" REF="29">
of all, and which they have &s;pread about the Town with much Noi&s;e and Clamour, to make the Matter as popular as they can, in which it is remarkable, that while they blame the <HI>Weavers</HI> for mobbing, they fall into the &s;ame Crime, and endeavour to rai&s;e the Mobb again&s;t the <HI>Weavers.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The grand Cau&s;e of the <HI>Weavers</HI> want|ing Work, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> is the Covetou&s;ne&s;s of both Ma&s;ters and Journeymen, in tak|ing &s;o many Apprentices for the &s;ake of the Money they have with them; not con&s;idering whether they &s;hall have Em|ployment for them or not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Then again, Journeymen <HI>Weavers</HI> come from many Parts of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> for the &s;ake of ea&s;ier Work, and greater Wages, &s;o that their Num|bers are (as I'm credibly informed) near double, what they were ten Years ago. The&s;e Things con&s;ider'd, 'tis no Wonder, that &s;ome of them have not Work; e&s;pecially at this Juncture, when our Inland Trade hath been damp'd, by the Noi&s;e of an Inva&s;ion, and the Fo|reign by the late Rupture with <HI>Spain.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is a full Charge again&s;t the <HI>Wea|vers,</HI> and would have &s;ome Weight in it, <HI>if true,</HI> tho' not enough <HI>even then</HI> to &s;up|port the Malice of it. But this, like the
<PB N="29" REF="30">
re&s;t, &s;tands upon a rotten Foundation; for in a word, this whole Charge is ut|terly fal&s;e, as any Thing can be, for in the fir&s;t place, few of the Ma&s;ters take any Apprentices at all, and when they do, it is very &s;eldom more than one, and per|haps that one, a Son or near Relation. And &s;econdly, as to the Journeymen, as they are call'd, the E&s;&s;ence of the Charge is fal&s;e, that is to &s;ay, their taking Appren|tices for the &s;ake of the Money; for where there is one has Money with his Appren|tice, there are fifty that has none at all; and the mo&s;t they have when they can get it, is not above five or &s;ix Pounds; and the Rea&s;on of this proves it&s;elf. For in the fir&s;t place, they commonly take &s;uch poor Boys for Apprentices as have been fir&s;t brought up in the Trade; for you mu&s;t know, that every Workman has a Boy to attend him to help him to pick his Silk clean, to fill his Quills; and in a flower'd Work, to draw up the Figure: Some of the&s;e Things the&s;e Boys are able to do at the Age of &s;ix or &s;even, for which, they earn two, three, four Shillings, and four Shillings and &s;ix Pence a Week, which is a great Help to their poor Fathers and Mo|thers: Thus they continue till the Age of fourteen, at which time they &s;eek for a
<PB N="30" REF="31">
Ma&s;ter, and Ma&s;ters al&s;o &s;eek for &s;uch Boys. Secondly, it is of much more Advantage to a Ma&s;ter to take &s;uch a Boy without Money than a Stranger with Money, and the Parents of &s;uch Boys being known to be always very poor, 'tis mo&s;t ridiculous to &s;ay, that they are taken for the &s;ake of Money.</P>
<P>Then he comes to a nice Point, which I would advi&s;e him to handle very ten|derly, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that 'tis no wonder the <HI>Wea|vers</HI> have not Work, e&s;pecially at this Juncture, when our Inland Trade has been damp'd by the Noi&s;e of an Inva&s;ion, and our Foreign by the War with <HI>Spain;</HI> cer|tainly the Government looks upon this Author with the utmo&s;t Contempt, and as one below their Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t &s;ure &s;uppo&s;e, that either the Danger of an Inva&s;ion was much greater than it was, or that the Apprehen&s;ions of it put us in a terrible Fright, that he &s;hould tell us &s;uch a Damp was put upon our Home-Trade by it: This is making the World believe we were terribly affrighted at the Noi&s;e of an Inva&s;ion; and that the <HI>Spaniard&punc;</HI> were &s;o formidable to us, as that the Rumour of their coming put a Damp upon our Trade: this way of giving Weight to an Enemy, was always offen&s;ive to the
<PB N="31" REF="32">
Friends of the Government, and has been branded in mo&s;t Times by the Mini&s;ters of State as a Mark of Di&s;affection; how he will come off of it, be that to him&s;elf; but certainly he might have left it out of his Argument in this Ca&s;e; for neither did this Grievance owe its Ri&s;e to the Noi&s;e of an Inva&s;ion, or to the War with <HI>Spain:</HI> The <HI>Weavers</HI> never mutiny'd or complain'd during the late ten Years War with <HI>Spain,</HI> or in any of the mo&s;t menacing Circum&s;tances of Trade ever &s;ince the Revolution. But their Grievances ari&s;es from their being cut out of their Work by the Encroachment of Foreign Manufactures; and by the ill Con|duct of People at Home, encouraging the Con&s;umption of Foreign Goods, and cru&s;h|ing and oppre&s;&s;ing our own: The Founda|tion of this was laid, neither in the Inva&s;ion from <HI>Spain,</HI> or the War with <HI>Spain;</HI> but in an Inva&s;ion from <HI>India;</HI> the Plague of Callicoes over-&s;preading the Land, &s;tarving our Men out of their Looms, and taking the Bread out of their Mouths; and the Evidence of this is clear enough, for grant but the <HI>Weavers</HI> an Act of Par|liament to prohibit the Wearing of Calli|coes, and you may make War or Peace as his Maje&s;ty plea&s;es, the <HI>Weavers</HI> will never concern them&s;elves about it: The
<PB N="32" REF="33">
<HI>Spaniards</HI> may come or &s;tay away, it is much the &s;ame Thing to the Trade, they meddle neither one Way or other: But the Callicoes are the Invaders they com|plain of, and the only Enemy they chal|lenge on this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>And now our Author having done with the <HI>Weavers,</HI> turns Advocate for the Cal|licoes, and for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; but performs this Part as weakly, as he has done the other wickedly; the only Thing of Weight he offers is, that the Duty on Printed Callicoes brings in Mo|ney to the Publick Revenue, <HI>and that this Money is appropriated by Parliament,</HI> as he &s;ays, <HI>for the Security and Reimbur&s;ing of great Numbers of Per&s;ons who have con|tracted with the Government at &s;everal Times:</HI> A great Rumble of u&s;ele&s;s Words put together to tell us the Duties on Cal|licoes, are made a Fund for the &s;ecuring Money borrow'd by the Government. And what is all this to the Purpo&s;e? The Par|liament who gave that Duty, and made it a Fund made it redeemable by Parliament, that is to &s;ay, kept the Power in their own Hands to redeem and di&s;&s;olve it; that if ever they found it a Grievance to the Peo|ple, and that it &s;hould be proper to take it off, they might be at Liberty to do &s;o,
<PB N="33" REF="34">
for the Publick Good; beings always able to &s;upply the Lenders with another Secu|rity equally &s;atisfactory; the Validity of all our Securities, and the Safety of Money lent, con&s;i&s;ting not in the Goodne&s;s of the Fund, but in the e&s;&s;ential Article of Parlia|mentary Credit; which is a Satisfaction to the Lenders, that whatever Fund is given them, however deficient that Fund may be, or how often &s;oever that Fund may be chang'd, yet that the Parliament are al|ways engag'd to make good their own Credit, and to an&s;wer the Payment of In|tere&s;t and Principal what ever may hap|pen; &s;o that if the Parliament finds it needful, as we doubt not they will, to put a Stop to the Importing, or to the Wearing of Callicoes in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> it be|ing a Fund for the Security of any Loan to the Government, can be no Ob&s;truction to them; the Parliament having it always in them to rai&s;e what new Fund they plea&s;e in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>But we have &s;till a more effectual An|&s;wer to this Objection, namely, it is true that if there was no Printed Callicoes worn, but tho&s;e printed here, and all &s;uch did pay the full Duty, it might indeed rai&s;e a pretty con&s;iderable Sum; but here lies the great
<PB N="34" REF="35">
Fraud of this Trade, which is a Grievance not to the <HI>Weavers</HI> only, but to the Govern|ment it&s;elf; <HI>viz.</HI> that be&s;ides the great Quan|tities of <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Callicoes, which pay no Duty at all, but are clande&s;tinely run on Shore from <HI>Holland;</HI> the far great|e&s;t Part of tho&s;e printed here al&s;o pay no Duty neither; for the Callicoes are fir&s;t pretended to be bought, white at the Sale, for Exportation; then they are enter'd at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e,</HI> on Pretence of Expor|tation, then run on Shore again, and car|ry'd to be printed, then pretended again to be &s;ent abroad, and &s;o the Duty on the Printing drawn back by Debenture; then they are clande&s;tinely run on Shore again, and thus the Government is cheat|ed both Ways, and this Money in&s;tead of being appropriated to pay the Nation's Debts, is put into the Smugglers Pockets, to the great Detriment of all fair Traders, and to the intolerable Le&s;&s;ening the Re|venue.</P>
<P>Of like in&s;ignificant Moment is the Pre|tence that the Printing and Painting of Callicoes con&s;umes a great Quantity of Gauls, Gums, and dying Stuffs; as if the dying the Wool, and the Silk, and the Woollen Stuffs, which this Trade of Cal|licoes
<PB N="35" REF="36">
de&s;troys, did not con&s;ume a much greater Quantity, even of the very &s;ame Drugs and Dye Stuffs, be&s;ides &s;everal other which the <HI>Callicoe-Printers</HI> make no U&s;e of; &s;o that this Argument is again&s;t them directly; for the Wearing of Callicoes in &s;o general a Manner as is now done, really le&s;&s;ens the Con&s;umption of the Drugs and Dying Stuffs, becau&s;e it le&s;&s;ens the Con|&s;umption of tho&s;e Goods, which would otherwi&s;e con&s;ume a much greater Quan|tity than the <HI>Callicoe-Printers</HI> can u&s;e, and of more &s;orts.</P>
<P>There is no better way to conquer an Enemy, than to turn his own Artillery upon him; &s;o it is in the foregoing Para|graph, and &s;o &s;till in the next; where he &s;ays, great Quantities of the&s;e Callicoes are exported again to the great Advantage of our Commerce; we grant this, and there|fore join with him, that not only great Quantities &s;hould be exported, but all of them; for let us but be deliver'd from the U&s;e of them here, we care not whether they &s;end them, whether to <HI>Africa, Ame|rica, Germany,</HI> or any where.</P>
<P>But we are then &s;ent to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who we are told are a wi&s;e People, and yet do not prohibit any Foreign Manufactures,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
tho they have great Manufactures of their own; if he had &s;aid as much more of the Wi&s;dom, <HI>Anglic$,</HI> the <HI>Craft</HI> of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in Trade, as he has done, I &s;hould have grant|ed it all; but differing Circum&s;tances make all Nations walk by different Rules; the Manufactures of the <HI>Dutch</HI> are &s;mall and tri|fling compar'd to ours; their principal Depen|dence is upon their being the general Mart of <HI>Europe,</HI> for all Foreign Goods, as well to export as import; they lay high Duties upon nothing, and prohibit nothing; but is this a Rule to us? Who&s;e Dependence is upon our Woollen Manufacture for the Sub&s;i&s;tence and Employment of our Poor, as well as for the Encouragement of our Navigation and Foreign Commerce? If we were to prohibit nothing, as is the Practice in <HI>Holland,</HI> what would become of our Trade in a few Years? And why do we limit our Fellow-Subjects in <HI>Ireland</HI> from exporting their own Goods? Why prohibit the <HI>French</HI> from importing theirs? The Pra|ctice of the <HI>Dutch</HI> is no more to us <HI>in Trade,</HI> than the Practice of <HI>Mahometans</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is to us <HI>in Religion;</HI> if we were the meer Carriers of the World as $span$ and de&s;ire to be, it would be &s;omething to the Purpo&s;e, and we &s;hould

do as they do, and if they were the great|e&s;t Manufacturers of the World as we are, they would do ju&s;t what we hope <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will now do, <HI>viz.</HI> prohibit the U&s;e of every Foreign Manufacture which inter|feres with their own.</P>
<P>How narrow is the Principle this Man argues from? When he tells us, that all this Clamour is from a few particular <HI>Weavers,</HI> that tho' it may hurt their Trade, yet it is a Benefit to &s;o many others, and that other Trades may with the &s;ame Rea&s;on turn the Tables upon us: I deny this upon a much better Principle than he advances it upon; for it is not the <HI>Weavers</HI> in <HI>Spittle|fields</HI> only, in who&s;e behalf we now com|plain, but 'tis in behalf of all the Manu|facturers of Wool and Silk in the Kingdom; upon who&s;e Trade not only &s;ome Millions of People depend, but in who&s;e Pro&s;pe|rity in &s;hort all the Nation is concern'd; and this indeed is the Rea&s;on, why upon &s;econd Thoughts I re&s;olv'd to an&s;wer this Writer according to his Folly, which at fir&s;t I thought was not worth while; as well becau&s;e of the Weakne&s;s of his Ar|guments, as of the Weakne&s;s of his Ar|guing.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;There are proper Sea&s;ons, as well as proper Methods, to be us'd to get Re|dre&s;s of Grievances: And &s;ure you cannot think that we, who are Fellow-Sufferers with you, will be wanting at the proper Sea&s;on to lay our Ca&s;e be|fore the Parliament; where, no doubt, the &s;ame will be duly con&s;ider'd by tho&s;e who in every thing &s;hew they have the Good of their Country at Heart. And this was intended to have been done la&s;t Winter: But as there was then a Bill of great Importance and Difficulty depending, for the bet|ter preventing the clande&s;tine Running of foreign Goods upon us, it was
<PB N="42" REF="43">
thought mo&s;t advi&s;eable to &s;ee that Bill pa&s;s fir&s;t into an Act; which could not be done till the ri&s;ing of the Parlia|ment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;You mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible that vio|lent Means can bring no Redre&s;s in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as ours, it being only to had in Parliament; but it may po&s;&s;ibly remove the Remedy at a greater di|&s;tance, by rendring tho&s;e who u&s;e &s;uch Methods odious to the whole Nation; and &s;o we may lo&s;e our Friends: For after &s;uch Proceedings, who can appear for us?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;We therefore earne&s;tly intreat and be&s;eech you all, for the &s;ake of the common Good, and your own Wel|fare in particular, to live quietly and peaceably, and not to in&s;ult or mole&s;t any of your Fellow-Subjects on any account what&s;oever; and that you &s;hew your &s;elves upon all Occa&s;ions dutiful and loyal Subjects to His Maje&s;ty, the be&s;t of Kings. And this you ought to be the more careful of doing at this time, &s;ince it has appear'd that there have been &s;editious People who have endeavour'd to &s;tir you up to Tumult:
<PB N="43" REF="44">
And 'tis to be fear'd, there will be tho&s;e likewi&s;e who will take advan|tage of your Follies, and endeavour to repre&s;ent you as Per&s;ons di&s;affected, thereby to deprive you of the Favour of the Government. But as we know that the far greater Part of you are well affected to His Maje&s;ty, we hope you will not fail to give all the Proofs of it that are in your Power; and there &s;hall be nothing wanting on our Part to &s;erve you.</Q></P>
