<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I DID not at fir&s;t intend to trouble the Reader with any Preface, knowing it to be impo&s;&s;ible by any Arguments to obtain a favourable and impartial Peru&s;al of a Performance of this Nature, from a Set of Men, who &s;eem of late to have thrown off every human and chri&s;tian Obligation to Charity and Benevolence, and &s;tick at nothing to promote tho&s;e carnal arbitrary Intere&s;ts, which all hone&s;t and &s;ober Chri&s;tians, but e&s;pecially Prote&s;tants, mu&s;t for ever condemn. Neither do I now trouble Him with &s;uch an Intent: For &s;ince the mo&s;t noble, generous and chri&s;tian Behaviour of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor</HI> towards all his Adver&s;aries, has prov'd
<PB REF="6">
ineffectual, and &s;till produc'd quite different Treat|ment towards him&s;elf, how arrogant and pre&s;ump|tuous would it be for any one to expect the lea&s;t Favour, who dares u&s;e Them after their own Manner? For my &s;elf, the Reader will perceive by the following Lines, that I defy their Malice as much as I abhor their Tyranny; and that I di&s;|dain all the blacke&s;t Mi&s;repre&s;entations, that either the mo&s;t bigotted Prejudice can &s;ugge&s;t, or the mo&s;t indu&s;trious Calumny can invent. I &s;hall very readily, and very patiently &s;ubmit to the Names of <HI>Athei&s;t, Libertine, Freethinker, Enemy</HI> to <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Reve|lation,</HI> &amp;c. rather than &s;ordidly give into Their ab&s;urd and &s;elf-contradicting Principles; rather than impiou&s;ly expect my eternal Salvation from a weak human Tribunal; and tamely &s;acrifice my Con&s;cience to the Direction and Di&s;po&s;al of an haughty, petulant, fallible, earthly Guide; rather than profe&s;s one Thing, and practi&s;e quite the con|trary; rather than call my &s;elf a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> whil&s;t I am openly acting over the <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> in the Face of the World. The Man, that can &s;tand &s;ilently by, and unmov'd behold, much more approve and abet &s;uch unchri&s;tian and unwarrantable Proceedings, as the <HI>Engines</HI> of this World have of late been tran&s;|acting, mu&s;t be in&s;tigated by &s;omething wor&s;e than
<PB REF="7">
the mere Prejudices of Intere&s;t, Complexion, or Education. It would be no le&s;s tedious than needle&s;s to mention the numberle&s;s In&s;tances of Bitterne&s;s, Malice and In&s;olence, which have with|in one Year only been made u&s;e of to blacken the un&s;potted Character of a truly Chri&s;tian and Pro|te&s;tant Bi&s;hop, &s;ince his Lord&s;hip has Him&s;elf &s;o publickly and in &s;o full a Manner an&s;wer'd each particular Calumny, as &s;oon as it fir&s;t appear'd in the World, and defeated the cruel Expectations of his Enemies. The Controver&s;y was no &s;ooner be|gun, but the Malignity of his Adver&s;aries broke out into per&s;onal Reflections, and per&s;onal Abu&s;es; and through the whole Cour&s;e of the Debate no|thing is to be met with on one Side, but a con|tinued Series of impotent Slander and Defamation; whil&s;t on the other, in&s;tead of &s;uch unju&s;tifiable Methods of Argument, the Reader finds the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive Rea&s;onings join'd with the mo&s;t benevo|lent Candour, and chri&s;tian Deportment. If we may know the Tree by the Fruit that it bears, the Cau&s;e which is now carrying on, cannot be the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, for the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity will never &s;tand in need of the meane&s;t Artifices of the Devil to &s;upport it, but is built on a much
<PB REF="8">
&s;urer Foundation, than of Wrath, of Violence and Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>And here, &s;ince the worthy Dean of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> has thought fit to publi&s;h to the World a Cata|logue of <HI>unju&s;tifiable Extremes;</HI> which, it &s;eems, his Lord&s;hip has run into meerly <HI>thro' Oppo&s;ition;</HI> I will venture to point out one, among&s;t ten thou|&s;and, which one of his Friends hath run into, and which I humbly conceive to be much more unju&s;ti|fiable, and much more <HI>&s;hocking</HI> than any he can produce; and which ought indeed to make the Ears of a Chri&s;tian <HI>tingle.</HI> Mr. <HI>Mar&s;den, Arch|deacon of Nottingham,</HI> in his Remarks on the Bi|&s;hip's Sermon, after having attempted to prove that his Lord&s;hip had perverted his Text; and that Chri&s;t's Kingdom is not the &s;ame with Chri&s;t's Church, or at lea&s;t only &s;o in <HI>&s;ome Sen&s;e,</HI> &s;peaks at la&s;t <HI>p.</HI> 23. in this Manner. <Q>This <HI>(that Chri&s;t's &startq;Kingdom is his Church)</HI> is <HI>gratis dictum</HI> with Re|lation to your Text, which is an An&s;wer to <HI>Pi|late,</HI> as I have already &s;aid; and an An&s;wer not &s;o <HI>properly Matter of Choice,</HI> but rather our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour was in <HI>&s;ome Manner obliged</HI> to make it, by the Nature of <HI>Pilate's Que&s;tion,</HI> and of &endq;the Occa&s;ion.</Q> I will now appeal to any im|partial Man in the World, whether our ble&s;&s;ed
<PB REF="9">
Saviour, the upright, unde&s;igning <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> is not in this Sentence repre&s;ented under the Character of a cunning, timorous, cavilling Sophi&s;ter; of one that would not &s;cruple even a &s;olemn Prevarica|tion, to evade an hampering Que&s;tion, and to &s;erve a vile worldly Occa&s;ion. What Reparation this learned Per&s;on is able to make to the whole Chri&s;tian World for &s;o foul an Indignity on the Per|&s;on of our Saviour, I confe&s;s my &s;elf at a Lo&s;s to imagine; but hope that with due Application made to Him, He will either explain him&s;elf on this Occa&s;ion, or forthwith ingenuou&s;ly retract &s;o ungrounded an A&s;&s;ertion. I the rather mention this learned and &s;currilous Remarker, becau&s;e the ordinary Reader, who may not perhaps have read the whole Controver&s;y, would otherwi&s;e think what I have &s;aid of Him in the following Poem, to be nothing but Poetical Flouri&s;h, and Satyrical Hyperbole and Aggravation; and to induce Him to believe that all my other Characters are not made up of the mere Common-places of Satire, but that mo&s;t of what I have &s;aid, may be ju&s;tify'd from each Per&s;on's particular Writings and Beha|viour.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o, for my Ju&s;tification in this Matter, refer the Reader to a late Pamphlet, intitled, <HI>a Let|ter
<PB REF="10">
to the Reverend Dr.</HI> Bradford, <HI>occa&s;ion'd by his Sermon preach'd before the King,</HI> &amp;c. He will there find the generous and exten&s;ive Prote&s;tant-Reforma|tion-Principles &s;o wretchedly &s;traiten'd, and con|fined to one particular &s;mall Number of Men, that it mu&s;t needs make any con&s;idering Chri&s;tian de|&s;pair of Salvation; for He has plainly a&s;&s;erted, that nothing but an <HI>exact Unity of Faith and Wor|&s;hip,</HI> of the <HI>Externals</HI> and <HI>Internals</HI> of Religion, will intitle us to the Favour of God. I &s;hall pro|duce an In&s;tance or two. Having &s;tept a&s;ide in the beginning of his Letter to take notice of a Sen|tence in Dr. <HI>Hayley</HI>'s Sermon before the KING, where that learned Divine &s;ays, <HI>that it is impo&s;&s;ible Men's Thoughts &s;hould run exactly in the &s;ame Chan|nel:</HI> This Remarker adds, <HI>p.</HI> 9. <HI>I am of the &s;ame Opinion, if They are not guided and directed by</HI> one <HI>and the</HI> &s;ame <HI>Rule, but are left every one to follow their own Fancies and Imaginations.</HI> What can <HI>Bellarmine</HI> Him&s;elf contend for more?</P>
<P>In another Place he &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 14.&mdash;<Q>All Rea&s;oning &startq;about matters of Religion, and divine Revelation, mu&s;t for ever cea&s;e and be at an end, if Chri&s;tians erect a Court of Con&s;cience in their <HI>own</HI> Hearts, which cannot be govern'd and determin'd by the reveal'd Will of God, <HI>or</HI> by the Deci&s;ions of the
<PB REF="11">
Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors of the Church, in Things properly &s;ubject to their Juri&s;diction and Autho|rity.&endq;</Q> To which it is ea&s;y to an&s;wer, That all Rea&s;onings about <HI>Matters of Religion</HI> and <HI>divine Revelation,</HI> can never be govern'd and determin'd by the reveal'd Will of God, unle&s;s Chri&s;tians <HI>erect</HI> a Court of Con&s;cience in their own Hearts; and that <HI>&s;uch Matters of Religion</HI> and <HI>divine Revela|tion</HI> (if he means any thing to the purpo&s;e) ought to be govern'd and determin'd by the reveal'd Will of God, and by the Court of Con&s;cience which Chri&s;tians erect in their own Hearts; and not by the Deci&s;ions of the Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors of the Church; nor are <HI>&s;uch</HI> things properly &s;ubject to their Juri&s;dic|tion and Authority. This Anonymous Letter-writer is indeed &s;o profe&s;s'd an Enemy to Con&s;cience and private Judgment in Matters of Religion, that I very much &s;u&s;pect him to be &s;ome lurking <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Emi&s;&s;ary, adapting him&s;elf to the Air of the Times: And what almo&s;t confirms me in the Su&s;picion, is, that thro' the whole Letter he &s;eems mighty fond of the Words <HI>Antient, Primitive, Catholick Church;</HI> by which, every one knows, the modern Papi&s;ts often expre&s;s the <HI>Church of England,</HI> meaning there|by, as it &s;tood before the Reformation. Be&s;ides; any one that con&s;iders his Notion of a <HI>Reformation,</HI>
<PB REF="12">
would be apt to think, that he meant a Reforma|tion TO POPERY; for he expre&s;ly &s;ays, <HI>p.</HI> 15.&mdash; <Q>&startq;That all tho&s;e who under&s;tand the true <HI>Intere&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Claims</HI> of the Church, will allow, that it &s;till wants a <HI>farther</HI> Reformation; and that it ought to approach <HI>&s;till nearer</HI> to the E&s;tabli&s;hment &endq;and Con&s;titution of the <HI>Primitive</HI> Church:</Q> Whereas on the contrary, mo&s;t of our modern Churchmen are of Opinion, that we are already TOO FAR remov'd FROM Popery. But this is not all; for <HI>p.</HI> 19. after having given us his narrow Notions of Reformation-Principles, he proceeds openly to condemn our great <HI>Prote&s;tant Reformers,</HI> for a pack of ignorant and de&s;igning Per&s;ons, in the&s;e Words. <Q>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that the <HI>Re|formers</HI> &startq;them&s;elves <HI>did not,</HI> all of <HI>them, under|&s;tand</HI> the true Nature and Con&s;titution of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church;</HI> and that &s;ome of them, who did under&s;tand tho&s;e Things, <HI>were obliged to un|rea&s;onable Compliances</HI> with the Secular Powers, to &s;ecure their Protection and Defence again&s;t the Power of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and its Adhe|rents. The Church was oblig'd to purcha&s;e a Reformation at a great Expence, both of its &endq;<HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal Intere&s;ts.</HI></Q> Is it po&s;&s;ible for any one to believe that &s;o open and undi&s;|guis'd
<PB REF="13">
an Attack upon the Reformation, can be made by one who even <HI>calls</HI> him&s;elf a <HI>Prote&s;tant?</HI> What follows is &s;till as remarkable.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&mdash;<HI>An Union</HI> among Prote&s;tants&mdash;will be found, to be very practicable, when the &s;everal &s;orts of Prote&s;tants &s;hall have laid a&s;ide their private Intere&s;ts, Partialities, and <HI>particular Opinions</HI> and <HI>Sentiments;</HI> and re&s;ign <HI>their Judgments</HI> to be di|rected and govern'd by the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of &endq;the <HI>Catholick Church.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what follows, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly comprehend what he means by the <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Au|thority of the Catholick Church,</HI> unle&s;s he means of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> becau&s;e I know no <HI>Church</HI> be&s;ides, to who&s;e <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> Chri&s;tians are requi|red to re&s;ign their <HI>particular</HI> Opinions, their Senti|ments and their Judgments. In many other Places he earne&s;tly contends that Chri&s;tians are indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Dictates,</HI> and <HI>Authority of the Catholick Church.</HI> From all which I think it very rea&s;onable to &s;u&s;pect, that the Letter-writer is a profe&s;s'd Papi&s;t; but I may be mi&s;taken, &s;ince we are not without Examples of <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> Prote&s;tants of this &s;ort. However, I may very &s;afely affirm, that he is a Prote&s;tant only in Profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o that it is amazing to me, to find him, <HI>p.</HI> 16 ridiculing the
<PB REF="14">
pretty new Notion (as he calls it) of <HI>Prote&s;tant Popery,</HI> becau&s;e His whole Letter, if it be not di|rectly Popi&s;h, is, I am &s;ure, far from being Prote&s;|tant; it mu&s;t be therefore a mixture of both, it mu&s;t be <HI>Prote&s;tant Popery.</HI></P>
<P>But to conclude, what I have &s;aid in the follow|ing Pages, will either &s;ufficiently Apologize for it|&s;elf, or will admit of no Apology. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that it is intended for the Entertainment of none but Prote&s;tant Readers: For as to the furious, arbitrary, fallible-infallible Churchman; the <HI>pa&s;&s;ive, non-re&s;i&s;ting, Rebellious</HI> Jacobite, and the in&s;olent <HI>A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating</HI> Nonjuror, I &s;hall mo&s;t joyfully, and with all Re&s;ignation abandon my&s;elf to Their Hatred, and de&s;pi&s;e all Their In&s;ults, as I would the impotent Fury of Madmen in Fetters: They may bur&s;t with Envy, if They plea&s;e, without giving me any Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
