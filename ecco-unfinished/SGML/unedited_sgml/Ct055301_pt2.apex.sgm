<P>THE parliament, by which young Edward had been rai&s;ed to the throne during the life of his father, appointed twelve per&s;ons as his privy council, to direct the affairs of the realm; and Henry earl of Lanca&s;ter being re&s;tored to the dignity of high &s;teward of England, was entru&s;ted with the guardian&s;hip of the young prince. The &s;entences denounced again&s;t

Roger de Mortimer were repealed, on pretence of his having been condemned without a trial; and he was re&s;tored to his lands and honours, to which were now added the e&s;tates of the earls of Arundel and Winton, in North Wales. Edmund earl of Kent received a grant of &s;ome lands and ca&s;tles; John de Hainault was gratified with a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion; and the parliament voted to the queen the &s;um of twenty thou&s;and pounds to pay her debts; the &s;ame &s;um as a yearly jointure, together with all the trea&s;ure of the two D'E&s;pen&s;ers, the earl of Arundel, and Robert de Baloch, the chancellor. As the city of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale. Rymer.</NOTE> London had been &s;o zealous in effecting the revolution, the citizens were not only pardoned for all the rob$eries, murders, and mi&s;demeanors they had committed &s;ince the day of the queen's landing, but they were recompen&s;$d for their &s;ervices, with a charter confirmed in parliament, exempting them from pry&s;es, eyres of ju&s;tices &s;itting in the Tower, talliages, and the &s;eizure of their liberties for the per&s;onal tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of their magi&s;trates. They were indulged with a grant of the borough of Southwark, and all the goods of felons adjudged within the liberties of the city. They were inve&s;ted with the privilege of being a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common with the freeholders of the counties; and not like other cities and boroughs; they were di&s;charged from all obli|gations to &s;erve in war without the city; and their mayor was ranked as one of the ju&s;tices, in every commi&s;&s;ion for the goal delivery of Newgate. Immedi|ately<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. W. Cont.</NOTE> after the coronation, all the French &s;ubjects, who had been apprehended in England, were relea&s;ed; and as Charles the French king had begun the war &s;olely with a view to favour the de&s;igns of his &s;i&s;ter, that purpo&s;e being now fully an&s;wered, ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed in Guienne, and a peace was concluded without any difficulty. The Scots, who had no connexion either with I&s;abel or Edward, re&s;olved to take the advantage of the troubles that di&s;tracted Eng|land; and without regarding the truce, attempted to &s;urprize the ca&s;tle of Norham, where, however, their endeavours mi&s;carried, through the vigilance of Sir Robert Mannours, the governor of that fortre&s;s. The council apprized of the&s;e ho&s;tilities, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Robert de Brus, to complain of the in|fractions of the truce, and treat about a final pacification. That active prince paid very little regard to their remon&s;trances, and plainly told them he would not let &s;lip &s;uch a favourable opportunity of annoying the inveterate enemies of his country. He even &s;ent a&s;olemn defiance to the court of England, threaten|ing an immediate inva&s;ion, which the mini&s;try hoped to prevent by a propo&s;al for appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to meet on the Marches, and deliberate upon the articles of a la&s;ting treaty. Robert a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al, but at the &s;ame time per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to invade the northern counties; and Thomas Randolf earl of Murray, and the lord Douglas, a&s;&s;embled a &s;trong body of forces for that expedition. In order to oppo&s;e this threatened incur&s;ion, the military tenants of the crown were ordered to rendezvous at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, on the eighteenth day of May: the fleet of the Cinque-Ports were di|rected to &s;ail to the northward; commi&s;&s;ions were i&s;&s;ued for arraying men in London, and all the other cities of the kingdom, as well as for rai&s;ing the po&s;&s;e of York&s;hire; and the chief command of the army was ve&s;ted in the earls of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Edward, even at this early age, di&s;covered that martial di&s;po&s;ition, for which he was he was &s;o renowned in the &s;equel. He &s;ent John de Hainault
<PB N="4" REF="60">
abroad to enli$t a body of foreign troops; and that nobleman joined him at York in the month of May, $ith five hundr$d knights and three times the number of hor&s;emen completely armed. The&s;e &s;trangers were care$$$d in &s;uch a m$nner by the queen and her &s;on, as arouzed the jea$ou&s;y of the Engli&s;h$ a quarrel breaking out between the two nations, the Engli&s;h archers and the Hain$ulters eng$ged each other with great fury, and a good many were &s;lain on both &s;i$es. The $oreigners, exa&s;perated at the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained in this encounter, &s;allied out from their quarters in greater number, and &s;lew about three hundred of the archers belonging to Lincoln&s;hire and the county of Nor|thampton; and the Engli&s;h incen&s;ed in their turn at this outrage, a&s;&s;embled next day to the number of &s;ix thou&s;and, determined to &s;acrifice the aggre&s;$ors to their revenge. It was not without great difficulty that a battle was prevented, by the interpo&s;ition of the king him&s;elf, who ordered the archers to remove to other quart$rs, and appointed guards for the &s;ecurity of the foreigners. This di&s;turbance being quelled, Edward advanced from York to Durham, where he was joined by all his forces, and received intelligence that the Scots, to the numb$r of twenty thou&s;and, had pa&s;&s;ed the Tyne, and ravaged the ea&s;tern parts of the b$&s;hopri$. He re&s;olved to intercept them in their retreat, and for th$t pur$o&s;e divided his army, con&s;i$ting of three&s;core thou&s;and men, into three bo$i$s, b$&s;ides an advanced guard of four thou&s;and hor&s;e, which were pirected to clear the way and detain the enemy by &s;kirmi&s;hing, until the army &s;hould come up and give them battle. He began his march in the middle of July, in qu$&s;t of the Scotti&s;h army, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;omewhere be|twe$n Durham and Carli&s;le; but after his troops had undergone abundance of fatigue in their route, through mountains, woods, and mora&s;&s;es, he could per|ceive no &s;igns of the enemy, but the &s;moaking ruins of villages which they had<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1327.</NOTE> &s;et on fire. He then changed his route towards the Tyne, leaving behind all his carriages, tents, and provi&s;ions, that the troops might not be encumbered i$ their march: at length they arrived at the place where the Scots had pa&s;&s;ed the river; and as it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e they would return the &s;ame way, Edward took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground on the northern &s;ide of the Tyne, where he continued five or &s;ix days, not a little incommoded for want of cover and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. The Scots, informed of his motions, recalled their pillaging p$rties, and po&s;ted them&s;elves in an advantageous &s;ituation, where they pro|po&s;ed to remain until they &s;hould receive more certain advice of his &s;trength and de&s;tination. Mean while the king decamped, and marching down the river, proclaimed that whoever &s;hould di&s;cover the place where the Scots were po&s;ted, might expect the honour of knighthood, and lands to the value of one hundred pounds a year, by way of recompence. On the third day after this proclamation, he received the welcome tidings from Thomas de Roke&s;by, who, encouraged by the promi&s;e of honour and reward, had made excur&s;ions in the neighbourhood, and found the Scots encamped, at the di&s;tance of three miles, on the other &s;ide of the river Were, that wa&s;hed the foot of an high hill on which they were very advantageou&s;ly encamped. He had approached &s;o near before he could di&s;cover them that he was taken pri&s;oner, and owning the motive which had induced him to go thither, the Scotti&s;h general &s;et him at liberty without ran&s;om, de&s;iring him to tell Edward they were ready to give him battle. The king having refre&s;hed his army, advanced again&s;t the enemy,
<PB N="5" REF="70">
whom he &s;aw already ranged in order of battle upon the declivity of the moun|tain: but the Were was &s;o encumbered with great &s;tones, and the current &s;o rapid after the late rains, that the Engli&s;h could not pa&s;s with any pro&s;pect of advantage; and the Scots had no intention to cro&s;s the river. Edward, impa|tient of this ob&s;truction, &s;ent a herald to tell the enemy, that if they were really inclined to hazard an engagement, he would either retire at a di&s;tance and allow them to pa&s;s the Were unmole&s;ted; or if they would retire to a proper di&s;tance, he would cro&s;s that river and give them battle. The Scotti&s;h generals rejected his propo&s;al, and gave him to under&s;tand, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e they &s;hould not be &s;o unwi&s;e as to follow an enemy's advice. Thus the two armies faced each other for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and the king, who occupied the north &s;ide of the river, re&s;olved to &s;tarve them into a battle or &s;urrender; for he had received intimation that all their &s;alt and oatmeal was con&s;umed, and they had no bread for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. This was really the ca&s;e; they fore&s;aw the in|conveniences of their &s;ituation, and decamping at midnight marched &s;ome miles higher up the river, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another mountain flanked by a wood, near Stanhope-Park, in the bi&s;hop$ic of Durham. The Engli&s;h were no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of their retreat, than they followed them, &s;till keeping on the north &s;ide of the river, and encamped on another mountain oppo&s;ite to that which they had occupied. While they remained in this &s;ituation, the lord Douglas, with a detachment of two hundred hor&s;e, forded the river a con&s;ider|able way above the armies, and entering the Engli&s;h camp in the night, pene|trated as far as the royal tent, with a view to &s;urprize and carry off the king: but the chaplain and chamberlain alarming the guards and foreign hor&s;e, who lay upon their arms ready for engagement, Douglas was &s;urrounded imme|diately, and e&s;caped with great difficulty, by cutting his way through tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed his retreat. Several &s;kirmi&s;hes happened between parties of both armies, and many feats of chivalry were performed by &s;ingle champions, who were ambitious of &s;ignalizing their valour under the eyes of their commanders. At length the Scots re&s;olved to retire to their own country; and an accident favoured their retreat. A certain knight belonging to their army, being taken pri&s;oner and examined before Edward and his council, declared that the Scots had received orders to be ready armed at night to march under the banner of Douglas. The Engli&s;h concluding from the enterprizing genius of that gene|ral, that he intended to attack them in the dark, re&s;olved to give him a warm reception; and for that purpo&s;e the army being drawn up in order of battle, &s;tood all night under arms. While the enemy retiring in &s;ilence under covert of the adjoining wood, and pa&s;&s;ing a large mora&s;s upon hurdles, directed their march towards Carli&s;le with &s;uch expedition, that they had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s before morning, when the &s;couts brought intelligence of their depar|ture; and next day they returned to their own country, with all the booty they had taken. Edward was exceedingly mortified to be thus baffled in his fir&s;t campaign. When he went to view the Scotti&s;h camp, he &s;aw three hundred raw &s;kins of cattle and deer fixed upon &s;takes over fires by way of kettles, in which they boiled their meat, a thou&s;and wooden &s;pits loaded with beef, ten thou&s;and pair of &s;hoes made of undre&s;&s;ed leather, and five Engli&s;h pri&s;oners with their legs broken, whom they had fa&s;tened to trees, that they might not be able to give intelligence of their retreat. The king, though piqued at his
<PB N="6" REF="80">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leland. K$$ghton. $span$.</NOTE> own di&s;appointment, could not help admiring the conduct and frugality of the enemy. Their &s;tragglers were intercepted and cut in pieces by a body of hor&s;e; then he retired to Durham, from whence he proceeded to York, where the be&s;t part of his forces were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>It was on his return from this expedition that he heard of his father's death, which he lamented with great &s;incerity of affliction. A parliament had been called at Lincoln, to procure a &s;ub&s;idy for carrying on the Scotti&s;h war, in ca&s;e the treaty &s;hould not &s;ucceed, as well as to defray the expence of the king's marriage with Philippa, daughter of William III. count of Holland and Ha$nault; for which the pope had ju&s;t granted a di&s;pen&s;ation, as the parties were in the third degree of con&s;anguinity. The clergy de&s;iring longer time to con&s;ider of the demanded &s;upply, the &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up without having tran&s;acted any bu&s;ine&s;s; and another parliament was convened at Lincoln in November, when a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy was voted by the clergy and laity. The bi&s;hop of Lincoln had been impowered to make a contract with Philippa in verbis de prae&s;enti; and &s;he was conducted into England by her uncle John de Hainault, in December, with a very honourable train of attendants. As &s;he approached London, the mayor and aldermen went forth to meet her in their formalities, expre&s;&s;ed their regard in a pre&s;ent of plate; and &s;he was received in the city by a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion of the clergy. From thence &s;he &s;et out for York, where the king at that time re&s;ided, and where the nuptials were &s;olemnized with great<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We&s;t.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1328.</NOTE> Mean while the Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners opened their con|ferences at Newca&s;tle; and both parties being very de&s;irous of peace, the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the articles was attended with no difficulty. Mortimer, who had nominated his own adherents as deputies on this occa&s;ion, thought he could not take a wi&s;er &s;tep than that of &s;ecuring the favour of Scotland, where he might find an a&s;ylum, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be per&s;ecuted like Gave&s;ton and D'E&s;pen&s;er; a misfortune he partly fore&s;aw from the hatred of the Eng|li&s;h nation, which he had already incurred. On the other hand, Robert de Brus was now in the decline of life, labouring under an incurable di&s;temper, and his only &s;on being yet in his infancy, he gladly embraced an opportunity to leave him in peace with his neighbours; e&s;pecially as the lord Douglas, the nobleman on who&s;e valour, conduct and fidelity he chiefly depended, had by this time engaged him&s;elf by oath in an expedition again&s;t the infidels in Pale&s;tine. Tho' Robert was in a condition to demand favourable terms, he did not think proper to re&s;t entirely on the merits of his power and character, but liberally di&s;tributed among the queen dowager, Mortimer, and &s;ome of the Engli&s;h deputies, part of that wealth which he had ama&s;&s;ed in his irruptions into England. Be&s;ides, the lords Piercy, Wake, and Beaumont, who conducted the treaty, were intere&s;ted in effecting an accommodation, by which they were re&s;tored to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Scotland, which had been con|$i&s;cated during the war. All the&s;e circum&s;tances concurring towards a paci|fication, the treaty was concluded upon &s;uch conditions as Brus could never have expected from an impartial examination of the points and articles in di&s;pute. It was &s;tipulated, that the kingdom of Scotland &s;hould &s;tand for ever divided from England, by the &s;ame Marches that di&s;tingui&s;hed it in the reign of Alexander III. That Edward &s;hould for him&s;elf, his heirs and

&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, relea&s;e Robert de Brus of all obligations, conventions and agree|ments made with any of his predece&s;&s;ors, touching the &s;ubjection of that realm; and declare all charters, deeds, and in&s;truments thereto relating, void and of no validity: That Robert de Brus &s;hould be acknowledged as the lawful monarch of that independent kingdom; and that Edward's elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter Jane &s;hould be married to David prince of Scotland: That Robert &s;hould pay thirty thou&s;and marks to the king of England, as an indemni|fication for the damage done by the Scots in their la&s;t irruption: That the &s;ubjects of both princes &s;hould be re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which of right belonged to them in both kingdoms: That Edward &s;hould u&s;e his intere&s;t with the pope to free the king and kingdom of Scotland from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures denounced again&s;t them; and that he &s;hould deliver up to Robert the regalia of his realm, together with the original roll of homage, by which John Baliol and the freeholders of Scotland recognized the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h monarch. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>The articles of this treaty excited an univer&s;al clamour all over the kingdom; for, &s;ome of them had tran&s;pired before the parliament con|vened to confirm the tran&s;action. The people loudly complained, that the commi&s;&s;ioners had betrayed the honour and intere&s;t of their country, in tamely giving up that claim, for the &s;upport of which &s;o much blood had been &s;hed and trea&s;ure wa&s;ted; and in con&s;enting to a marriage between a prince&s;s of England, and the &s;on of a man who had been treated as an outlaw and traitor to her own grandfather. A number of the prelates and nobility ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the parliament a&s;&s;embled at York, becau&s;e they would not venture to contradict the mea&s;ures of Mortimer, who&s;e power was very for|midable, and they were too hone&s;t to approve or countenance &s;uch a &s;hame|ful accommodation. Neverthele&s;s, Edward impowered Henry de Percy and W. de Souche to &s;wear in his name to the articles of the treaty; and the in|&s;trument of his renunciation of the &s;uperiority over Scotland, imports that it was executed with the con&s;ent of the prelates, lords and commons a&s;&s;embled in parliament. The king immediately after this tran&s;action, &s;ent a letter to the pope, de&s;iring he would annull the cen&s;ures which had been denounced again&s;t Robert and his dominions; the prince&s;s Jane was &s;ent under the conduct of her mother to Berwick, where &s;he was affianced to David de Brus, and from thence conducted into Scotland; and the roll of homage granted to Edward I. together with all the records which he had brought from that kingdom, were delivered to the Scotti&s;h agents, according to the inventory which had been taken, when they were fir&s;t lodged in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte.

<P>Perhaps Edward, young as he was, would not have &s;ubmitted to this inglorious treaty, which precluded him from gratifying his re&s;entment again&s;t the Scots, whom he hated, had not his attention been diverted to more a&s;piring views, which more effectually flattered his ambition. Charles Le Bel, king of France, dying without male i&s;&s;ue, Mortimer and the queen per&s;uaded Edward that he was next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of France, in right of his mother I&s;abel, &s;i&s;ter to the late king; and he forthwith re&s;olved to pro|&s;ecute his claim to that monarchy. As the queen of France was pregnant at her hu&s;band's death, he could not demand the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion until it &s;hould
<PB N="$" REF="100">
appear whether the fruit of her womb was male or female; but, in the mean time, he &s;ent letters to the nobility and communities of Guienne, Languedoc, and Navarre, declaring his re&s;olution to recover the rights and inheritance of his mother; and de&s;iring they would a&s;&s;i&s;t his endeavours. While a new par|liament fat for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s at Northampton, he granted powers of procuration to the bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter and Lincoln, to maintain his right to the crown of France, and &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to form a league with the duke of Brabant, and the towns and cities in Flanders which were then at actual war with Philip de Valois, whom the French fir&s;t declared regent of the realm, and afterwards proclaimed king, when the widow of Charles was delivered of a daughter. This prince was certainly the true heir to the crown of France, as &s;on of Charles count de Valois, brother to Philip the Fair. Edward, though nearer in blood to the la&s;t king, was excluded by the Salick law, which had never been infringed in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the French kings; and his allegation that the force of that law was broken by his being a male, though de&s;cended from a female, contained a palpable ab&s;urdity; for &s;he who had no right in her&s;elf, could convey none to her de&s;cendants.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this objection, Edward was &s;o agreeably intoxi|cated with the pro&s;pect of uniting two mighty kingdoms in his own per&s;on, that he would not de&s;i&s;t from his preten&s;ions; but &s;ummoned a great council of the nobility and clergy at York, to explain his intentions and title, and obtain their approbation on this &s;ubject, as well as their &s;anction of the peace with Scotland. By this time Mortimer was become &s;o di&s;agreeable for his in&s;olence and arbitrary mea&s;ures, that the noblemen and prelates were aver&s;e to every mea&s;ure he propo&s;ed; and this a&s;&s;embly broke up without having come to any re&s;olution. A parliament was therefore convoked at Sali&s;bury; and though the members were by particular writs inhibited from appearing with force or arms, on pain of forfeiture, Mortimer went thither with a &s;trong body of adherents armed, in contempt of the prohibition. The earl of Lanca&s;ter, and other peers who were on the road to parliament, being in|formed of this &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tance, were &s;o alarmed, that they proceeded no farther than Winche&s;ter: and indeed their apprehen&s;ions &s;eemed too well founded; for, while the bi&s;hops, prelates and other members a&s;&s;embled in parliament, were con&s;ulting about the affairs of the nation, he went with a body of armed men, and bur&s;ting open the doors, threatened them with in&s;tant death, &s;hould they pre&s;ume to &s;peak or act in any thing contrary to his inclination. Intimidated by this violent outrage, they withdrew, before any thing of moment was tran&s;acted; and the noblemen at Winche&s;ter thought it high time to retire without the reach of &s;uch an in&s;olent tyrant, who had even pre&s;&s;ed the king to march again&s;t them in an ho&s;tile manner. Such was the end of this &s;e&s;&s;ion$ during which the earldoms of Cornwal, Marche, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro$ Parl. M. We$.

<P>Though a council of twelve per&s;ons had been appointed by par|liament to advi&s;e and direct the young king at his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and the earl of Lanca&s;ter was entru&s;ted with the care of his per&s;on, Mortimer wholly engro&s;&s;ed the admini&s;tration, by virtue of the a&s;cendancy he had gained over the queen mother and her &s;on, who acted altogether by his direction.

He di&s;tributed all offices of tru&s;t and profit among his own creatures; and &s;quandered away his ma&s;ter's trea&s;ure in gratifying his own vanity, which was equal to that of Gava&s;ton. He held tournaments with great pomp and o&s;ten|tation; affected magnificence even &s;uperior to that of royalty it&s;elf. His in&s;olence was &s;uch, that he treated his &s;uperiors and equals with the mo&s;t pro|voking contempt: he per&s;ecuted all tho&s;e who pre&s;umed to blame his conduct or oppo&s;e his de&s;igns; he rendered the king inacce&s;&s;ible to all but his own friends and abettors; and prevented the earl of Lanca&s;ter him&s;elf, as well as the members of the council, from &s;peaking to him on the affairs of the nation. This nobleman could not without indignation bear the arrogance of &s;uch an up&s;tart, which was equally di&s;agreeable to other peers of the realm; and now &s;eeing the freedom of parliaments de&s;troyed by his late outrageous behaviour at Sali&s;bury, they began to take mea&s;ures for obtaining redre&s;s in another manner; they met in private and formed a confederacy for their mutual pre|&s;ervation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The new archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, Simon Mepham, together with the prelates of London and Winche&s;ter, embarked in this a&s;&s;ociation, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. We$$.

They held conferences at London, to de|liberate upon articles of impeachment again&s;t Mortimer; they re&s;olved to en|quire into the late king's death; to charge this overgrown favourite with the di&s;&s;ipation of the king's revenue, a trea&s;onable corre&s;pondence with the Scots at Stanhope-park, giving up the &s;overeignty of Scotland, and delivering the roll of homage, &s;ub&s;cribed by the barons and freeholders of that kingdom. They likewi&s;e determined to demand a re&s;umption of the forfeited e&s;tates and ca&s;tles granted to the queen-mother, and her minion, to the prejudice of the royal revenue, which was hardly &s;ufficient to maintain the king's hou&s;hold in its u&s;ual &s;pendour. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>After having con&s;ulted on the&s;e &s;ubjects at London, which favoured their de&s;igns, they held a general meeting at St. Paul's, where they engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation to procure certain ordinances for the good of the kingdom; and deputed the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the bi&s;hop of London, and the king's two uncles, the earls of Kent and Mare&s;chal, to &s;ollicit the king's a&s;&s;ent to their propo&s;al. But the&s;e two noblemen were &s;educed from their party by the allurements of a court; and the two prelates endeavoured to effect a peace on the be&s;t terms they could procure for the confederates. By this time ho&s;tili|ties were begun by Mortimer, who had rai&s;ed an army, &s;urprized Leice&s;ter, and ravaged the lands belonging to the earl of Lanca&s;ter; and that nobleman had a&s;&s;embled a body of forces with which he advanced as far as Bedford, again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;or. The court dreaded an in&s;urrection of the commons in favour of Lanca&s;ter, who had acquired great popularity; and the Londoners having already e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, tho&s;e who governed the king did not th$nk proper to run the ri&s;k of a rebellion. After &s;ome di&s;puter, it was agreed tha$ all gr$evances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, and all errors in the admini&s;tration rectified in the next parliament; which, however, the king found an excu&s;e

to po&s;tpone. He had been &s;ummoned by Philip de Valois the French king, to do homage for the dominions he held of the crown of France; but as he did not chu&s;e to appear in a &s;tate of humiliation before a prince who&s;e competi|tor he was for the kingdom he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he &s;ent over amba&s;&s;adors to &s;ollicit delays, on various pretences; yet Philip in&s;i&s;ting upon his per&s;onal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, $e $ailed from Dover in May, and did homage to the French king at Amiens, tho' not before he had made a formal prote&s;t in his own council, that he &s;ub|mitted to this ceremony upon compul&s;ion, for fear of lo&s;ing his dominions on the continent, and in order to prevent other calamities with which his refu&s;al might be artended; but, that he did not by this act of homage intend to re|nounce his right to the crown of France, or to derogate from his claim, even though he &s;hould be obliged to &s;ign an in&s;trument to that effect. Edward was received at the court of France with great magnificence, and a cordiality of friend&s;hip, which they propo&s;ed to cement by a marriage between Philip's &s;on John, and Edward's &s;i&s;ter Eleonora: a formal treaty was brought upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> the carpet for this purpo&s;e, but never took effect. The king returned to England in June, about two days after the decea&s;e of Robert de Brus, who died of a lepro&s;y, after a reign of twenty years, in which he had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf above all the princes of his time, for valour, fortitude, and wi&s;dom.</P>

<P>Mortimer having conceived an implacable enmity again&s;t the earl of Kent, becau&s;e he openly oppo&s;ed the$ pernicious mea&s;ures, and ambitious de|&s;igns, which $e daily hatched or put in execution, re&s;olved to remove this ob|&s;tacle out of the way of his arbitrary career, and laid a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;nare for his de&s;truction. He employed emi&s;&s;aries all over the kingdom, to diffu&s;e a re|port that Edward of Caernarvon was &s;till alive in Corte-ca&s;tle, though vi&s;ible to none but by particular licence. He knew the earl of Kent had always re|tained a warm affection for that unfortunate brother, although he joined the queen again&s;t the D'E&s;pen&s;ers, without &s;u&s;pecting that her de&s;ign was to de|throne her h$&s;band; and therefore he did not doubt that the earl would intere&s;t him&s;elf in behalf of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed monarch, could he once be per&s;uaded that Edward was actually alive. Such an uncommon circum&s;tance could not fail of becoming the general topic of di&s;cour&s;e; and Kent did not hear the &s;tory without emotion. He que&s;tioned Mautravers, and Sir John Deverel, gover|nor of Cor$e-ca&s;tle; and they being tutored for the purpo&s;e, confirmed the truth of the report, which they pretended to communicate through friend&s;hip and confidence. Other per&s;ons of co$&s;ideration joined them in this infamo$$ deceit, and even propo&s;ed mea$ures for &s;etting the impri&s;oned king at liberty. Kent being thus deluded and trepanned, wrote a letter to his brother, a&s;&s;uring him he would u&s;e his utmo&s;t end$avours to procure his enlargement; and that the chief noblemen of the realm were re&s;olved to employ their power and influ|$$ce for re&s;toring him to the dignity of which he had been &s;o unju&s;tly de|prived. Deverel, who undertook to deliver this letter to Edward II. carried it immediately to Mortimer, who received it with joy, as the infallible means of the earl's de&s;truction. A parliament was &s;ummoned to meet in March at Winche&s;ter; and there he propo&s;ed to make u&s;e of this advantage he had gained over his adver&s;ary. As he had been long accu&s;tomed to overawe and intimidate parliaments, few or none attended at this a&s;&s;embly but his own

creatures and dependants; &s;o that he found no difficulty in executing his p$r|po&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. W. Cont. Conc. M. B.</NOTE> He imparted Kent's letter to the king, with &s;uch comments and exag|gerations, as prevailed upon Edward to write to that nobleman, de&s;iring his<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1330.</NOTE> attendance for &s;ome particular rea&s;ons; and, upon his arrival at Winche&s;ter he was arre&s;ted. Some of Mortimer's adherents were &s;ent to examine him in pri&s;on; and they made fal&s;e reports, and produced forged confe&s;&s;io$s, calcu|lated for exa&s;perating Edward again&s;t his uncle. His letter to Edward of caernarvon being read in parliament, he was convicted of trea&s;on, and con|demned to lo&s;e his head. Mortimer, and the queen, extorted a warrant from Edward, directed to the bailiffs of Winche&s;ter, commanding them to execute the &s;entence without delay: but they could find no per&s;on who would under|take the office of executioner, until a felon was brought from the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, who performed the ta&s;k, on condition of receiving a free pardon for the crimes he had committed. The king expre&s;&s;ed great concern for his uncle's death, and cau&s;ed $is body to be interred in the dominican convent at Winche&s;ter; and as that nobleman was exceedingly beloved by the people, his fare produced an univer&s;al clamour through the whole nation. Mortimer, who was cur&s;ed as the cau&s;e of his death, as well as of all the grievances of the nation, endeavoured to amu&s;e the re&s;entment of the people, by diffu&s;ing the report of a pretended con&s;piracy, to be &s;upported by foreigners. The archbi&s;hop of York the bi&s;hop of London, and &s;everal other prelates and noblemen were pro&s;ecuted for trea&s;onable de&s;igns, becau&s;e they had expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;atisfaction when they heard of the late king's being alive: the earl of Lanca&s;ter was arre&s;ted on &s;u&s;picion; &s;everal dominican and carmelite friars were impri&s;oned and &s;ent into exile; and proclamations were publi&s;hed in every county, commanding the &s;heriffs to take into cu&s;tody all tho&s;e who &s;hould pre&s;ume to &s;ay that Ed|ward II. was alive. The&s;e mea&s;ures an&s;wered his purpo&s;e &s;o far as to intimi|date his adver&s;aries, and gratify his avarice with the forfei$ed e&s;tates, fines, and ran&s;oms; but at the &s;ame time they increa&s;ed that tide of ha$red and revenge, which tho' pent up for a &s;ea&s;on, broke down all its mounds in the &s;equel, and bur&s;ting with double violence, overwhelmed him with de&s;truction.

He obtained farther grants of the lands which had belonged to the D'E&s;pen&s;ers in Wales, where he wanted to augment the number of his va&s;&s;als: he frequently exhibi|ted tournaments and round tables in that country, and on the Marches, in order to dazzle the natives with his magnificence. He never travelled with|out a royal retinue; and in his whole demeanour di$played &s;uch vanity and o&s;tentation, that his own &s;on Geoffrey u&s;ed to &s;tile him the King of Folly.</P>

<P>By this time ho&s;tilities had commenced on the frontiers of Guienne, between the French and Engli&s;h. John of Eltham, the king's brother, was appointed governor of that province, and a re&s;olution formed to &s;end him over with troops &s;ufficient for its defence. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was directed to convoke a &s;ynod at Lambeth, that his clergy might grant a &s;ub&s;idy towards the expence of this expedition: but they rejected the propo&s;al, alledging they were already overburthened by the pope, who had lately taxed them at a tenth of their benefices, and all the profits of vacancies, during the term of four years, to be equally divided between his holine&s;s and Edward. In the cour&s;e of this year, the queen was delivered at Wood&s;toke of her fir&s;t|born

&s;on, who was baptized by the name of Edward, and lived to acquire un|rivall$$ renown, under the name of the Black Prince. This happy event f$ll$d the n$$ion with unive$$$ joy, and was attended with a favourable turn in the admin$tration.

His di&s;gu&s;t was no &s;ooner known, than all tho&s;e who had acce&s;s to his maje&s;ty, vied with each other in explaining the particulars of his vicious life, and arbitrary pro|ceedings. They expatiated upon the murder of the late king, and the death of the earl of Kent, as the partial execution of a &s;cheme he had formed to de&s;troy the whole royal family; and Edward gave ear to the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions. The earl of Marche had &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed the royal authority, and was &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the admini&s;tration, that the king fore&s;aw it would be altogether impracticable to a&s;&s;ume the reins of government, until this u&s;urp$$ &s;hould be di&s;graced and ruined; though this would be no ea&s;y ta&s;k, con&s;ider|ing that the whole power of the kingdom was in his hands; that he was always upon his guard, &s;urrounded by a body of knights, and other adherents, in arms; and that he con&s;tantly employed a number of &s;pies to watch the con|duct of his &s;overeign. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e difficulties, Edward doomed him to de&s;truction, and admitted William Lord Montacute into his confi|dence. By means of this nobleman he imparted his de&s;ign to others of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> nobility, and they re&s;olved to &s;eize the per&s;on of Mortimer, during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, which was &s;ummoned to meet about Michaelmas, at Not|tingham.</P>

<P>Edward intended to &s;ecure the ca&s;tle of that city; but the queen and Mortimer, who &s;u&s;pected his de&s;ign, anticipated his purpo&s;e, by going th$ther before him, and taking up their quarters in it with all their retinue; &s;o that when the king arrived, there was no room for his attendants, though he him&s;elf was admitted, with three or four dome&s;tics. Mortimer had re|ce$ved &s;ome intimation of the plot that was formed again&s;t him, which how|ever he purpo&s;ed to counter-work, by apprehending and confining in this fortre&s;s all tho&s;e of the nobility whom he con&s;idered as his enemies. Mean while they were lodged about a mile from the town, where they had the op|portunity of con&s;ulting about the execution of their &s;cheme, without being ob|&s;erved by Mortimer; t$ough it was judged impracticable at that time, with|out the conc$rrence of Sir William Eland, governor of the ca&s;tle. He was &s;ounded on the &s;ubject by the lord Montacute, and found zealous for the king's &s;ervice; but he could not admit them into the fortre&s;s, becau&s;e the qu$$n had ordered the locks to be altered, and the keys were carried every $$ght into her apartment. However, he &s;ugge&s;ted another expedient which $$&s;wered their expectation. On the we&s;tern &s;ide of the ca&s;tle there was a ne|g$ected caver$, the mouth of a &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;age, which communicated
<PB N="13" REF="150">
with the ca&s;tle; and through this he undertook to conduct them to the apart|ment of the earl of Marche. The &s;cheme was approved, and mea&s;ures were immediately concerted for its execution. The lords Montacute, Molins, Uf|ford, Stafford, and Clinton, with Sir John Nevil of Hornby, Sir Humphry, Sir Edward, and Sir William de Bohun, were the chiefs of this enterprize. The&s;e, and Sir William Eland, took hor&s;e and quitted Nottingham in the afternoon; &s;o that Mortimer imagined they had fled, to avoid his re&s;entment; but they returned at midnight, and entering the dark pa&s;&s;age, which to this day is known by the name of Mortimer's hole, they arrived, under the con|duct of Eland, in the chief tower of the ca&s;tle: from thence they proceeded &s;oftly to the chamber adjoining to the queen's apartment, where they found Mortimer, with the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, and others of his party, in clo&s;e con|&s;ultation, and took him pri&s;oner, after having &s;lain Sir Hugh de Turpliton, and Richard de Monmouth, who drew their &s;words in his defence. The queen hearing the noi&s;e, and gue&s;&s;ing the de&s;ign of their coming, called aloud in the French language, to her &s;on, who &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to be at the head of the party, Fair &s;on! fair &s;on! have pity on the accompli&s;hed Mortimer. No an&s;wer being made to this exclamation, &s;he &s;tarted from bed, and ru&s;hing among the con&s;pirators, earne&s;tly begged they would do no injury to his per&s;on; for he was a worthy knight, her dear friend and well-beloved cou&s;in. This exploit was performed with &s;o little noi&s;e, that the people in the town knew nothing of what was tran&s;acted in the ca&s;tle; and next morning the royali&s;ts &s;eized two of Mortimer's &s;ons, and &s;everal adherents, who lodged without the walls of the ca&s;tle. Among the&s;e were Oliver de Ingham, and Simon de Be|reford, his chief coun&s;ellors and parti&s;ans. All the pri&s;oners were &s;ent to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> Tower of London; and the king that &s;ame day publi&s;hed a proclamation, &s;ignifying that he had now taken the government into his own hands, and would redre&s;s the grievances of the people. Then he repaired to Leice&s;ter, where he i&s;&s;ued out writs for a new parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter; to which all per&s;ons aggrieved by the late admini&s;tration were invited to explain their wrongs, that they might obtain &s;atisfaction. At this a&s;&s;embly, held in No|vember, articles of impeachment were exhibited again&s;t Roger de Mortimer, and his accomplices.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An$ Ch. 1331.</NOTE> During this commotion in England, Edward's affairs had been upon a very precarious footing in France. The count of Alen&ccedil;on had invaded Guienne, and taken Xaintes; and though matters had been in &s;ome mea&s;ure compromi&s;ed, &s;o as to put a &s;top to ho&s;tilities$ the war was now ready to break out with greater fury. As various di&s;putes &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Edward and Philip de Valois, which the plenipotentiaries of the two crowns could not de|termine, the king of England imagined he &s;hould be able to remove all ob&s;tructions to a &s;olid peace, by a per&s;onal interview with Philip; and re&s;olved to cro&s;s the &s;ea, on pretence of performing a vow of pilgrimage which he had made in &s;ome dangerous emergency, leaving his brother John of Eltham guardian of the realm. He took &s;hipping at Dover, in April, with a very &s;mall retinue; and in a few days &s;ettled the controverted points in an amicable manner with the king of France. Edward acknowledged that liege homage was due for Guienne; he agreed to pay the re&s;idue of the money &s;tipulated in the treaty with Charles Le Bel, as due to that prince, for co&s;ts in the &s;e|que&s;tration of Guienne. Philip granted a remi&s;&s;ion to the officers of the dutchy, who by that treaty were bani&s;hed their country; he re&s;tored the town and ca&s;tle of Xaintes, paid a &s;um of money in lieu of damages; and a treaty wa$ brought upon the carpet for a match between Philip's daughter<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer.</NOTE> Jane, and the young prince of England.</P>

<P>The king returning to England, before the end of the month, &s;ummoned a parliament to meet in September, at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in order to con&s;ult them about a de&s;ign which he had formed to vi&s;it Ireland, and reduce
<PB N="15" REF="170">
the rebels of that country. But he was advi&s;ed to &s;end over &s;ome able officer, with troops &s;ufficient to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of that kingdom, and defer going thither in per&s;on until all the di&s;turbances of England &s;hould be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. Separate bands of free-booters, con&s;i&s;ting of di&s;&s;olute people and outlaws, habituated to rapine during the late troubles, had fixed their haunts and habitations in different fore&s;ts, from whence they made occa&s;ional ex|cur&s;ions, to rob travellers and lay the &s;ubjects under contribution. They were &s;o bold and numerous as to &s;et the civil power at defiance; and being protected by &s;ome of the nobility, became &s;o in&s;olent as to &s;eize the judges on the circuit, and oblige them to pay ran&s;om for their lives and liberty. With a view to deliver the kingdom from this annoyance, the parliament prohibited ju&s;ts and tournaments, which &s;erved as occa&s;ions of rendezvous to armed people. The lords were commanded to withdraw their countenance and pro|tection from &s;uch lawle&s;s robbers and delinquents, again&s;t whom the king marched in per&s;on, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that after having routed them in &s;everal engagements, he either killed, impri&s;oned, or expelled every individual of their gangs; &s;o that the nation was free from &s;uch nu&s;ances during the remaining part of his reign. As no other provi&s;ion was made in the treaty with France for re&s;titution of the Agenois, but that of referring the di&s;pute to the deci&s;ion of eight French peers, to be named by the king of England, Edward now re&s;olved to recover that country, even though they &s;hould decide again&s;t his preten&s;ions: that he might be prepared for the execution of his purpo&s;e, he contracted an alliance with the count of Gueldres, on whom he be&s;towed his &s;i&s;ter Eleanor in marriage; and received a large &s;ub&s;idy from the clergy and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clau&s;. 6.

<P>The king of France being declared generali&s;&s;imo of a cru&s;ade, by the pope, &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the European princes, and in particular pre&s;&s;ed Edward to engage in the expedition; a propo&s;al which the parliament advi&s;ed him to decline, unle&s;s Philip would defer his departure until the affairs of Ireland &s;hould be &s;ettled, and England &s;ecured again&s;t all danger from Scotland, which now &s;eemed to be on the eve of a &s;urprizing revo|lution. A bloody war had broke out in Ireland between the Engli&s;h govern|ment and the natives; and in another parliament which met in September, the prelates and nobility having taken the &s;tate of that kingdom into con|&s;ideration, agreed that con&s;iderable &s;uccours of men and money &s;hould be &s;ent over to &s;trengthen the hands of the admini&s;tration: a &s;ub&s;idy was granted for that purpo&s;e; but they oppo&s;ed the king's going thither in per&s;on, becau&s;e his pre&s;ence was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to attend to the commotions in Scotland. Though it had been &s;tipulated in the treaty with Robert de<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> Brus, that the Engli&s;h barons &s;hould be re&s;tored to the e&s;tates they had for|merly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Scotland, &s;everal barons, namely, Henry lord Beaumont earl of Buchan$ David de Strathbolgy earl of Athol, Gilbert Umf$eville earl of Angus, the lords Wake, Fitzwaren, Stafford, Ferrers, Mowbray, Talbot, &s;ir Roger Swinnerton, and others, were &s;till debarred of the benefit of this article. Edward had interpo&s;ed with the Scotti&s;h regency in behalf of the&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1332.</NOTE> noblemen, and was amu&s;ed with eva&s;ive an&s;wers; from which he concluded that the Scots were re&s;olved to keep the lands they had u&s;urped.

of $word$ which, though &s;ituated on the northern &s;ide of the Tweed, $$longed to the b$$ho$ric of Durham. The king was not &s;orry for their fur|ni&s;hing him with an handle to renounce the treaty, which he looked upon as $$glor$ous, and highly prejudic$$l to his right of &s;uperiority over Scotland, which he was determined one day to revive: but as he had promi&s;ed upon bond to the pope, that he would ob&s;erve the peace for the term of four years at lea&s;t, he would not take any &s;tep by which he might run the ri&s;que of $$curring the penalty of the obligation. The noblemen, however, who&s;e in|tere&s;t was more immediately concerned, re&s;olved to exert them&s;elves for the recovery of their inheritances by force of arms; and without all doubt, they acted by the connivance of Edward. They had recour&s;e to Edward, the &s;on of John Baliol, who$ at his father's death, had been left a minor, and pri&s;oner in England. He was a prince of remarkable bravery, and a mo&s;t enterprizing genius; and him they encouraged to make an effort for the recovery of his father's crown. The conjuncture was favourable, on account of the nonage of David de Brus, the death of James lord Douglas, and the age and infir|mities of Thomas Randolph, the guardian of the realm; and they promi&s;ed to rai&s;e a con&s;iderable body of forces to maintain his preten&s;ions. Edward gladly embraced the propo&s;al, and they began forthwith to prepare for the expedition. Though the king of England, in order to keep mea&s;ures with his holine&s;s, publi&s;hed proclamations for keeping the peace between the two kingdoms, and refu&s;ed them a pa&s;&s;age by land through his territories; they per&s;i&s;ted in their operations with unremitting a&s;&s;iduity, and embarking their forces at Raven$pur in York&s;hire, landed in the beginning of Augu&s;t at Kinghorn. Sir Alexander Seton, at the head of the Fife militia, endeavoured to oppo&s;e their landing; but was routed and &s;lain, with nine hundred of his followers. Baliol advancing to Dumfer$ling, found a magazine of arms, which were given to tho&s;e who joined his banner in Scotland. Then he pro|ceeded towards Glad&s;muir, where Donald earl of Marre, the new guardian, was encamped, at the head of a numerous army, while an advanced body had po&s;ted them&s;elves on the other &s;ide of the river, to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age of the Engli&s;h. Confiding in their numbers, and the depth of the river, they lay in a very carele&s;s manner, almo&s;t wholly unguarded; and this circum&s;tance be|ing communicated to Bal$$$ by one of his friends in the Scotti&s;h army, who at the &s;ame time di&s;covered a ford at a place called Duplin, he pa&s;&s;ed it in the night with all his forces, and fell upon the enemy, who were immediately routed and &s;lain in great numbers. The earl of Marre, who lay with the main body at the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles from the &s;cene of this action, pro|po&s;ed to &s;tarve out the Engli&s;h without righting; but, Robert earl of Carrick, natural &s;on of the late Robert $word$ Brus treating this propo&s;al as the effect of cowardice, a di&s;pute aro&s;e, in the cour&s;e of which tho&s;e ferocious chiefs chal|lenged each other to begin the battle without delay; and they forthwith $word$ again&s;t Baliol with the utmo&s;t precipitation, while their followers ran $span$ in di&s;ord $word$ Such was the $word$ of this attack, that when they arrived in a narrow $word$ through which $word$ were obliged to pa&s;s, men and hor&s;es $word$ over one another; and they lay in heaps, an ea&s;y prey to the Engli&s;h, who made a terrible &s;laughter The two impetuous leaders were &s;lain, together with A$an earl of Mon$$$th, Campbell the Scotti&s;h earl of

After this &s;ignal victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun. Barnes.</NOTE> Baliol entered Perth without oppo&s;ition; and finding it well &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions, employed his forces in putting the place in a po&s;ture of defence. This was a very nece&s;&s;ary precaution; for the fortifications were &s;carce re|paired when he found him&s;elf be&s;ieged by Patrick earl of Dunbar, and Archi|bald Douglas, who had rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable army of hardy troops on the border; and, as they could not come up in time to prevent the di&s;a&s;ter of Glad&s;muir, now re&s;olved to block up the victor, &s;o as reduce him by famine. They in a great mea&s;ure depended upon John Crabbe, a Flemi&s;h &s;ailor, whom they had enli&s;ted in their &s;ervice. He then lay with ten well armed &s;hips in the harbour of Berwick; and they &s;ent him orders to de&s;troy the Engli&s;h &s;qua|dron which was &s;tationed at the mouth of the Tay, for the convenience of &s;upplying Baliol and his followers. He accordingly attacked them with great fury; but met with &s;uch a warm reception, that all his own ve&s;&s;els were either burnt or taken; and the Scotti&s;h generals finding them&s;elves di&s;appointed in that quarter, as well as in want of provi&s;ions, while Baliol was furni&s;hed by &s;ea, abandoned their enterprize, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their forces. The Scots in ge|neral, a&s;toni&s;hed at the rapidity of Baliol's &s;ucce&s;s, and intimidated by the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained, laid a&s;ide all thoughts of further oppo&s;ition; and he was crowned king of Scotland at Scone, in the month of September. Very few noblemen of the country a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this ceremony: but the earl of Marche, and Archibald Douglas, with tho&s;e of the Bru&s;&s;ian intere&s;t, propo&s;ed a truce till Candlemas; to which he a&s;&s;ented, that he might have time to hold a par|liament for &s;ettling the affairs of the kingdom. In this interval young Da|vid de Brus, with Jane, &s;i&s;ter of the king of England, the prince&s;s to whom he had been affianced, was &s;ent over to France, where Philip received them<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.

<P>Such was the &s;ituation of affairs in Scotland, when king Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1333.</NOTE> &s;ummoned a parliament to meet at York, in order to con&s;ult his prelates and nobility, about the regulation of his conduct, touching this unexpected revo|lution. This a&s;&s;embly being very thin, it was adjourned till January, when the members having deliberated upon the &s;ubject, advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty to con|&s;ult the opinions of the pope and the king of France, who had already &s;ollicited his interpo&s;ition in behalf of David, to whom his own &s;i&s;ter was betrothed. They at the &s;ame time exhorted him to appoint proper guardians of the Marches; and keep none but tru&s;ty and wi&s;e coun&s;ellors about his per&s;on. One would be apt to think, from the nature of their advice, that they di&s;ap|proved of a war with Scotland, as they did not mention the circum&s;tance of his claim to the &s;uperiority of that kingdom, which he de&s;ired them particu|larly to con&s;ider. Perhaps, indeed, they thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ignify their opinions on that &s;ubject, as Edward had already taken his re&s;olution. Before the meeting of this &s;e&s;&s;ion he had an interview at Roxburgh with Ba|liol, who did liege homage for the kingdom of Scotland; obliged him&s;elf to a&s;&s;ign the town, ca&s;tle, and &s;hire of Berwick, in part of two thou&s;and pounds to be yearly paid to the king of England; to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his wars with a cer|tain

<P>Ba$iol$ after his coronation, leaving Perth to the care of Duncan earl of Fife$ directed his march towards Roxburgh; and in his route was at|t$cked by Andrew Murray, whom he defeated and took pri&s;oner. Then thinking himself &s;$cure in the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the kingdom, and the truce which had be$$ concluded$ he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his Engli&s;h troops, and repaired to Annan, where $e propo&s;ed to hold his parliament. The Bru&s;&s;ian party, without pay|ing any regard to the truce, re&s;olved to &s;natch this opportunity of &s;eizing him and his attendants; and executed the &s;cheme with &s;uch circum&s;pection and di&s;|patch. that Edward had &s;carce time to mount a hor&s;e without bridle or &s;addle, on which he e&s;caped with great difficulty to Carli&s;le; while his followers fell into the hands of the enemy, and his own brother Henry lo&s;t his life, after having performed miracles of valour in attempting to effect a retreat. The Scots under Sir W. Douglas, flu&s;hed with their &s;ucce&s;s, made incur&s;ions into Cumberland, which they ravaged without &s;cruple; and this infraction of the peace afforded the king of England a plau&s;ible pretence to renounce the treaty, and declare for Baliol. Ho&s;tilities were now committed on both &s;ides; and &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes fought on the border. Sir W. Douglas was defeated and taken by Sir Anthony Lucy; and Andrew Murray, in fighting with Baliol at Roxburgh, advanced &s;o far before his followers, that his communication was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> cut off, and he was carried into the ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>Edward king of England having now no longer any rea&s;on to conceal his de&s;igns, complained to the courts of France, Rome, and Flanders, of the ho&s;tilities which the Scots had committed; &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to demand homage of David de Brus: and this being peremptorily refu&s;ed, denounced war again&s;t him as a contumacious va&s;&s;al. He &s;ent for reinforcements to Aquitain and Ireland; and appointed the rendezvous of his army at New|ca&s;tle upon Tyne, from whence he marched, in the beginning of May, to be|&s;iege Berwick, which he inve&s;ted immediately, fixing his head-quarters at Tweedemouth. The Scots had &s;upplied this frontier with a &s;trong garri&s;on, under two of their brave&s;t commanders, namely Sir William de Keith, go|vernor of the town, and Patrick Dunbar earl of Marche, guardian of the ca&s;tle. The&s;e leaders made &s;uch a gallant defence, ruining the works of the be&s;iegers in repeated &s;allies, that Edward, after having made &s;everal un&s;uc|cessful attacks, re&s;olved to change the &s;iege into a kind of blockade by &s;ea and land, in order to reduce them by famine; and in the mean time to pene|trate with part of his army into the heart of Scotland, in hope of bringing the guardian to a deci&s;ive battle. He accordingly left the conduct of the &s;iege to Baliol, and entering that country, advanced as far as Edinburgh, without any other oppo&s;ition than that of being incommoded in his march by the detach|ments of Archibald Douglas, now guardian of the realm, who wi&s;ely avoided a general engagement. After a tedious and fruitle&s;s progre&s;s through a bar|ren country, from which the natives had conveyed their mo&s;t valuable effects to inacce&s;&s;ible fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, he returned to Berwick, the &s;iege of which he now r$&s;umed with redoubled vigour; nor could he be diverted from his purpo&s;e, though Douglas marched into England, and even inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Ban|borough, in which the queen re&s;ided. Edward knew the place was well forti|fied,
<PB N="19" REF="210">
and the Scot unprovided with implements for a &s;iege; he therefore con|&s;idered the attempt as an artifice to draw him from Berwick, which he was re|&s;olved to reduce at all events. The Scots continued to make an ob&s;tinate de|fence, until their fortifications were almo&s;t intirely demoli&s;hed; and then they demanded a truce of five days, on condition of &s;urrendering the place if it &s;hould not be relieved before the expiration of that term. Sir William de Keith was furni&s;hed with a &s;afe-conduct, by virtue of which he repaired to Ban|borough, at that time beleaguered by Douglas, whom he per&s;uaded to march to the relief of the place: but the truce expiring before he could approach the Engli&s;h army, Edward demanded the immediate &s;urrender of the town and ca&s;tle; and Seton, the deputy governor, &s;tarting &s;ome difficulties, he ordered that officer's two &s;ons, whom he received as ho&s;tages, to be hang'd before the walls, in &s;ight of their father. This at lea&s;t is the account given by the Scotti&s;h writers, which however is denied by all the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, who affirm that the Scotti&s;h army came in &s;ight before the truce was expired; and therefore Edward could have no pretence for demanding a &s;urrender. Douglas, with a numerous army, arrived at Bothville, near Halidowne hill, on Mon|day the nineteenth day of July, and drew up his forces in four divi&s;ions, com|manded by the principal nobility of Scotland. The Engli&s;h were po&s;ted upon the hill, drawn up al&s;o in four battalions, flanked with archers, for which the kingdom was always famous. In this &s;ituation did Edward wait the at|tack of the enemy, who began to a&s;cend the hill with great impetuo&s;ity about the hour of ve&s;pers. But they met with &s;uch a reception as in a little time checked their career. They were &s;oon out of breath, in con&s;equence of run|ning up the hill in armour; they were terribly galled by the arrows of the Engli&s;h; they &s;uffered &s;everely from the huge &s;tones that were rolled down upon them ince&s;&s;antly; and their general being killed by a &s;pear, they fell into di&s;order and dejection. Edward perceiving them fatigued, broken, and di&s;|pirited, ordered John lord Darcy to attack them in flank, with a body of light armed foot from Ireland; while he him&s;elf fell in among them, at the head of a choice brigade of men at arms, and archers on hor&s;eback. The men at arms in the Scotti&s;h army had di&s;mounted to begin the attack; and now, when they might have made &s;ome defence on hor&s;eback, they found them|&s;elves deprived of their hor&s;es, by the lacquies who had fled with them from the field of battle. All re&s;i&s;tance was now at an end; the enemy were &s;ur|rounded, and an horrible carnage en&s;ued. Twenty thou&s;and Scots fell in the battle, and in the pur&s;uit; and almo&s;t the whole nobility of the kingdom were either killed or taken. This great victory was obtained at the expence of one<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford. Knyghton.

<P>The king punctually performed the articles of the capitulation; granted time for the Scotti&s;h inhabitants to remove their effects, and permitted tho&s;e to &s;tay who were di&s;po&s;ed to take the oaths to the Engli&s;h government. Pa|trick Dunbar earl of Marche entered into his &s;ervice; and, in conjunction with the lord Henry de Percy, was entru&s;ted with the guard of Lothian and Gal|loway. Edward having annexed Berwick to the crown of England for ever, and given orders for repairing the fortifications, left &s;ix and twenty thou&s;and men with Baliol, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the reduction of Scotland; and disbanding the re&s;t of his army, returned to the &s;outhern parts of his dominions. Scot|land
<PB N="20" REF="220">
was by this time &s;o weakened and di&s;couraged by the lo&s;s of &s;o many battles, and all the flower of the nobility, that Baliol could expect to meet with very little oppo&s;ition. He accordingly over-ran the whole country with|out re&s;i&s;tance, and reduced all the ca&s;tles except tho&s;e of Dunbritton, Urqu|hart, and two or three others that were deemed impregnable. He then &s;um|moned a parliament to meet at Edinburgh, at which &s;even bi&s;hops, together with the Engli&s;h earls of Buchan, Athole, and Mar, the earl of Marche, Sir William de Keith, and Sir Alexander Seton a&s;&s;i&s;ted. And here the charters of homage to the king of England, &s;ub&s;cribed by Baliol, were &s;olemnly con|firmed; David earl of Athol, the lords Beaumont and Talbot, were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tates to which they laid claim in Scotland; Henry de Percy was gratified for his &s;ervices with the Pele of Lochmaban, Annandale, and Moffetdale, which belonged to the earl of Murray; and grants were made to &s;everal other Engli&s;h gentlemen, at the expence of the Scotti&s;h proprietors. All the &s;tatutes and ordinances pa&s;&s;ed in the reigns of Robert and David de Brus, were repealed; and all the lands they had granted away reclaimed and re&s;tored to the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. The&s;e mea&s;ures, how&s;oever ju&s;t, were extremely im|politic; ina&s;much as all the people thus deprived of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, were ren|dered de&s;perate, and became the implacable enemies of Baliol; and the Scots in general, who were violently intere&s;ted in the glory of their nation, looked with contempt and dete&s;tation upon a prince who had &s;o &s;hamefully given up that independence which had co&s;t them &s;o much blood to maintain. They con|&s;idered Baliol as an alien, and the &s;on of him who fir&s;t acknowledged him&s;elf the va&s;&s;al of the fir&s;t Edward; and their affection glowed in favour of the &s;on of their great re&s;torer. The re&s;entment of his old enemies was not &s;o prejudicial his intere&s;t as the alienation of his friends. He was &s;o imprudent as to di&s;|oblige the lord Beaumont, who had been the fir&s;t author and chief &s;upport of his enterprize, and laid him under a variety of obligations. The earldom of Buchan, which he claimed in right of his wife, who was daughter of Alex|ander Cumin, was di&s;membred in favour of Sir Alexander Mowbray, who had &s;ome preten&s;ions to a part of the inheritance. This per&s;on had been a violent parti&s;an of the Bru&s;&s;ian intere&s;t; but had lately abandoned his party, and made his peace with Baliol. The cau&s;e between him and Beaumont was de|bated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$$4.</NOTE> in parliament: Talbot and Strathbolgy declared in favour of their countryman Beaumont; while the Scotti&s;h members e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of Mowbray. The di&s;pute was carried on with great violence; and Baliol pro|nounced &s;entence in favour of the latter. The parliament immediately broke up in great confu&s;ion. Beaumont and Athole retired to their re&s;pective earl|doms; and Talbot, in his return to England, was taken by a party of Bru&s;|&s;ians, and conveyed to the ca&s;tle of Dunbritton. Baliol immediately &s;aw his intere&s;t divided, and well nigh de&s;troyed, by this di&s;pute; and con&s;cious of his own indi&s;cretion, re&s;olved to reconcile him&s;elf to the friends he had di&s;|obliged: he revoked the &s;entence he had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Beaumont, gratified<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leland. Wal&s;ingham. Dugdale.</NOTE> Athole with a grant of other e&s;tates, and promi&s;ed to pay Talbot's ran&s;om. This accommodation was too late to repair the mi&s;chief he had done; becau&s;e his friends were by this time de&s;per&s;ed; and many de&s;pairing of his being able to maintain his dignity, had already inrolled them&s;elves among the adherents of David. Some of the prelates and noblemen of that party had retired into France, and &s;ollicited &s;uccours from Philip, who renewed the league which
<PB N="21" REF="230">
had been made between his predece&s;&s;or and Robert de Brus; and &s;ent a body of troops, commanded by Arnoul de Audenham, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them again&s;t Baliol. The&s;e &s;uccours, and the promi&s;e of further reinforcement, concurred with the di&s;&s;en&s;ions among Edward's party, to elevate the hopes of the Bru&s;&s;ians, and encourage them to rai&s;e forces for the re&s;toration of David. The lord Andrew Murray, guardian of Scotland, who had been pri&s;oner at Roxburgh, recovered his liberty in this critical conjuncture, and put him&s;elf at the head of that in|tere&s;t. He was joined by Mowbray, now di&s;obliged in his turn at the repeal of the &s;entence, which had been pronounced in his favour: they inve&s;ted the lord Beaumont in his &s;trong ca&s;tle of Dundurg, and compelled him to capi|tulate. The earl of Athole fled into Lochabar, but being clo&s;e pur&s;ued, was obliged to &s;ubmit, and take the oath to David, who&s;e friends in a very little time made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of all the northern part of Scotland.</P>

<P>Edward king of England had &s;ummoned a parliament at London, to deliberate on the &s;ubject of an expedition he propo&s;ed to undertake for the relief of the Holy Land, in conjunction with other European princes: but, when he heard of this turn of affairs in Scotland, that de&s;ign was po&s;t|poned; and their deliberations adopted a more intere&s;ting object. They im|mediately granted extraordinary &s;ub&s;idies for the reduction of the in&s;urgents in Scotland: the king forthwith &s;ummoned the military tenants, and re&s;olved to pa&s;s the winter in the north, that he might be at hand in the &s;pring to invade that country with a powerful army. Mean while he &s;ent a body of forces to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Edward Baliol, who, thus reinforced, over-ran all the we&s;tern parts of Scotland; and had well nigh taken Robert, the &s;teward of that kingdom, a youth about fifteen years of age, the nephew and heir of David de Brus, whom he &s;ucceeded on the Scotti&s;h throne. He was lord of Bute and Arran, two i&s;lands which Baliol reduced: but young Robert e&s;caped his &s;earch, and took refuge in the ca&s;tle of Dunbritton. During the&s;e tran&s;actions in the we&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford. An. Ch. 13$5.</NOTE> king Edward entering Scotland by Berwick, marched into the heart of the kingdom without &s;eeing the face of an enemy; and, in his return, received a letter from Patrick Dunbar earl of Marche, containing a formal renunciation of his homage. In all probability the &s;iege of his ca&s;tle would have been the immediate con&s;equence of this defection, had not the operations of war been &s;u&s;pended by the arrival of amba&s;&s;adors from France, &s;ent to mediate an ac|commodation between the Scots and the king of England. A treaty was im|mediately begun at Gedeling, near Nottingham, whither the Scotti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioners repaired, under the &s;ecurity of a &s;afe$conduct; and in the mean time both parties agreed to a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, to continue to the following Mid&s;ummer. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>The plan of pacification drawn up by the French amba&s;&s;adors, who were in the intere&s;t of the Scots, was utterly rejected by Edward, who re&s;olved to treat with them in another manner. All the bi&s;hops, barons, and free|holders, in Ireland, were ordered to contribute a certain proportion of men and money for the reduction of Scotland: the earls of Namur, Juliers, and Montbeliard, were engaged in the &s;ervice of England; and directions given for equipping large fleets in Ga&s;cony and England. The lord ju&s;tice D'Arcy brought a body of forces from Ireland, in &s;ix and fifty ve&s;&s;els, with which he ravaged the i$les of Bute and Arran. The king a&s;&s;embled his army in June, and dividing it into two bodies, &s;ent one to invade Scotland, by the

way of Berwick, under the command of Edward Baliol, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the earls of Surrey and Arundel, the lords Beaumont, Percy, Nevil, Stafford, and Cantiloupe; while he him&s;elf, accompanied by the count of Juliers, at the head of his foreign knights, and the chief nobility of England, entered the enemy's country by the way of Carli&s;le; and a fleet of one hundred and &s;ixty &s;ail were ordered to cru$&s;e along the coa&s;ts of that kingdom. The Bru&s;&s;ians were not &s;o mad as to $ace the&s;e armies in the field. They retired, as u&s;ual, with their valuable effects to their mountains, fore&s;ts, and mora&s;&s;es, from whence they occa&s;ionally attacked the &s;traggling parties and detachments of the Engli&s;h; and the two kings met at Perth, after having ravaged the whole country through which they pa&s;&s;ed. While they re&s;ided at this place, the young count of Namur, in his march to join them with a body of fo|reigners, was attacked in a moor near Edinburgh by a &s;uperior number of Scots, under the command of the earls of Marche and Murray, and Sir Wil|liam Douglas. The foreigners, and their young count, fought with great gal|lantry, till they were overpowered, and then they retreated to the rock on which the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh had &s;tood. There they fortified them&s;elves amid&s;t the ruins of the fortre&s;s which Edward had ordered to be demoli&s;hed; but, as they were de&s;titute of provi&s;ion, they could not help &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion. The earl of Murray, from a principle of romantic honour, not only di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him without a ran&s;om, but al&s;o conveyed him &s;afely into Eng|land; and as he returned from thence he fell into an ambu&s;h, formed by the garri&s;on of Roxburgh, by which he was routed and taken pri&s;oner. Edward continuing &s;till at Perth, detached the forces of the four northern counties, under the command of his brother John of Eltham, and Sir Anthony Lucy, to reduce and ravage Galloway, Carrick, Kyle, and Cuningham, where the intere&s;t of Brus chiefly predominated; and a body of Scots advancing again&s;t them, with the earl of Marche and Sir William Douglas, a very ob&s;tinate<NOTE PLACE="marg">$a$ghton D$gdale.</NOTE> engagement en&s;ued, in which the enemy were defeated with con&s;iderable &s;laughter.</P>

<P>This defeat &s;truck a damp into the hearts of the Bru&s;&s;ians, who could have very little rea&s;on to hope for &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t &s;uch a powerful mo|narch as Edward, who was already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole kingdom, and numbered great part of the natives in his &s;ervice.

The treaty was ma|naged by Alexander and Geff$ey Mowbray; and, after &s;ome debates, concluded on condition that the Scotti&s;h noblemen &s;hould have the benefit of a general amne&s;ty: enjoy the lands, honours, and offices, in Scotland, and be re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates in England, which had been confi&s;cated; that the kirk, and boroughs of Scotland, &s;hould enjoy all their privileges and franchi&s;es; and all the offices of the crown and kingdom be be&s;towed on natives only, except in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, where king Edward Baliol might &s;ee rea&s;on to exert his prerogative in behalf of per&s;ons of a different nation. To the&s;e articles, &s;igned at Perth in the month of Augu&s;t, Duncan earl of Fife, and others of the Scotti&s;h nobility, acceded; and &s;ome who held out

They even undertook for David's appearance in the Engli&s;h parliament, to be held after Michaelmas, in London, to &s;tand to the award of his king and his coun|cil. After this agreement the king convened the bi&s;hops, noblemen, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Andrew Murray the regent, and the greate&s;t part of the Scot|ti&s;h nation, were not concerned in the&s;e tran&s;actions, but $till continued to annoy the Engli&s;h, and the adherents of Baliol, with hot incur&s;ions and de&s;|perate attacks: nor did they yet re&s;ign the hopes they had conceived of being powerfully &s;uccoured by the French monarch. The king having received the homage of tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted to his &s;way, ordered the fortifications of Perth to be repaired, the ca&s;tles of Edinburgh, Stirling, and Bothwel, to be rebuilt; and leaving the earl of Athole guardian of the northern parts of the kingdom, returned to Berwick in the beginning of October. David Strathbolgy earl of Athole had been received into favour, upon his declaring that the fealty he had &s;worn to David de Brus was the effect of compul&s;ion; and, in order to manife&s;t his zeal for the &s;ervice of Edward, he marched at the head of three thou&s;and men to be&s;iege the ca&s;tle of Kildrummy, in which the regent's wife re&s;ided. Murray was no &s;ooner informed of her danger, than he a&s;&s;embled a &s;mall body of forces, and marched to her relief, accompanied by the earl of Marche and Sir William Douglas; and although inferior to Athole in num|ber, gave him battle without he&s;itation, $t a place called Kilblane, where Da|vid Strathbolgy was defeated and &s;lain. The victors, encouraged by this ad|vantage, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tles of Coupar and Lochindoris: and the progre&s;s of their arms in that part of the country contributed more than the interce&s;&s;ion of the pope and the French king, to prevail upon Edward of England to con|clude a truce with the regent, to continue till the ninth day of May, in the &s;ucceeding year. This &s;u&s;pen&s;ion was intended as the prelude to a peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> and the treaty was &s;et on foot at Newca&s;tle, to which place the regent, with Sir William Douglas, Sir William de Keith, and Robert Lauther, repaired on the faith of a &s;afe-conduct, which was likewi&s;e granted to &s;ix other com|mi&s;&s;ioners

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the profe&s;&s;ions of Philip de Valois, he was &s;o far from being hearty in his endeavours to promote an accommodation, that his envoys, by his direction, &s;tarted &s;uch difficulties as rendered the confe|rences<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. $h. 1336.</NOTE> of no effect. It was the intere&s;t of the French king to foment the war, that Edward, being employed at home, &s;hould have no lei&s;ure to execute the &s;cheme he had projected for the &s;upport of his preten&s;ions to the kingdom of France. Philip had publicly declared that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t his allies the Scots to the utmo&s;t of his power: he had already &s;ent over con&s;iderable &s;upplies of men, money, and ammunition, with &s;ome officers of experience; and he ca|joled them in &s;uch a manner, with promi&s;es of more powerful reinforcements, that their commi&s;&s;ioners ro&s;e very high in their demands; &s;o that the nego|tiations were broke off, and the regent waited with impatience for the expira|tion of the truce, that he might take the field and renew the operations of war. Edward was per$ectly well acquainted with the complexion of the French po|litics, and $ore&s;aw that the conferences would prove abortive; he was informed of all the tran&s;actions of the Scots, not only at the courts of Paris and Rome, but al&s;o in &s;everal other countries, where they &s;ollicited &s;uccours with good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; and he re&s;olved to proceed in his preparations, without depending upon the i&s;&s;ue of the negotiation. He had, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive par|liaments at York and We&s;tmin&s;ter, enacted &s;everal laws for the benefit of commerce, and &s;ome &s;alutary regulations for the prevention and puni&s;hment of robbery and rapine; and his &s;ubjects, both of the clergy and laity, with whom he was by this time become extremely popular, chearfully granted con|&s;iderable<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ W$$$.

<P>Thus amply &s;upplied with money, he &s;ummoned his military te|nants to meet him in arms at the place of rendezvous in the north, &s;o as to be ready to enter Scotland at the expiration of the truce; and appointed Henry, &s;on of the earl of Lanca&s;ter, commander in chief of the forces de&s;tined for that expedition. About the latter end of June he convoked a parliament at Northampton, to concert mea&s;ures for defeating the de&s;igns of France, from which an inva&s;ion was expected; and while he and his parliament were en|gro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e deliberations, he received intelligence of the ho&s;tilities re|commenced by the Scotti&s;h regent Murray, who, as &s;oon as the truce expired, took the field with a body of forces, reduced the ca&s;tles of St. Andrews and Bothwel, and inve&s;ted tho&s;e of Stirling and Lochindoris. The king, alarmed at his progre&s;s, &s;et out immediately for Berwick, where he was joined by a body of troops, with which he proceeded to Perth; and his arrival was no le&s;s welcome to his $riends than di&s;agreeable to the enemy, who no &s;ooner un|der&s;tood that he was in Scotland, than they made a de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault upon the ca&s;tle of Stirling, in which Sir William de Keith was &s;lain. Being repul&s;ed in this attempt with great lo&s;s, and informed that Edward was on the march to relieve the place, they abandoned that enterprize, as well as the &s;iege of Lochindoris, and retired to their fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, to avoid a general battle. The king advanced through Athole to Inverne&s;s, and from thence proceeded by Elgin through the &s;hire of Murray, which he laid in de&s;olation. The lord

Beaumont, who commanded a &s;eparate detachment, put all to the &s;word with+out mercy whom he &s;u&s;pected of having been concerned in the battle again&s;t his brother-in-law the earl of Athole. The town of Aberdeen was levelled to the ground, in revenge for the death of Sir Thomas Ro&s;&s;elin, whom the in|habitants had attacked and &s;lain on his landing at Dunotter; and Edward having made a progre&s;s to the extremity of Scotland, returned to Perth, leav|ing the country he had over-run a mi&s;erable monument of his vengeance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun.

<P>Edward's return from this fruitle&s;s expedition &s;eems to have been ha&s;tened by the accounts he received of the French king's de&s;igns and prepara|tions. That monarch had by this time equipped a powerful armament by &s;ea and land, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scots, and appointed their young king David admiral of his fleet: under this youthful commander his navy &s;coured the channel, ravaged the i&s;le of Wight, and the i&s;lands of Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey; and while he threatened a de&s;cent upon England, a &s;trong army was a&s;&s;embled in order to invade Guienne. Edward, tho' he wanted to avoid an open rup|ture with France, until he &s;hould have entirely reduced Scotland, thought it high time to provide for the &s;afety of his kingdom. He &s;ent for a fleet from Bayonne, in Ga&s;cony, to come and crui&s;e in the Engli&s;h channel; and though he could not prevent the preparations that were making in Holland, Denmark, and Norway, for the benefit of the Scots, he prevailed upon the &s;tates of Genoa and Provence to put a &s;top to the armaments which the king of France had &s;et on foot among them, under the pretence of fitting out a navy for the pur|po&s;es of the cru&s;ade. The king having taken the&s;e &s;teps, repaired to England, and &s;ummoned a parliament to meet at Nottingham on the twenty-third day of September, where &s;ome &s;umptuary laws were enacted, re&s;tricting the prelates and nobility to two cour&s;es at every meal, except at great fe&s;tivals; and pro|hibiting all who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s one hundred pounds a year, from wearing furs, or &s;ilk of foreign manufacture: at the &s;ame time the u&s;e of foreign cloth was limited to the royal family alone. In con&s;ideration of the&s;e prudent laws, by which the progre&s;s of luxury was checked, and the Engli&s;h manu|factures encouraged, the clergy and laity granted him a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy, be&s;ides an additional duty on wool; and he returned to Scotland, where his pre&s;ence was as nece&s;&s;ary as ever. He had no &s;ooner quitted that kingdom<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> than Andrew Murray, at the head of the Bru&s;&s;ians, took the field, and reduced the ca&s;tles of Dunotter, Kinnef, and Lauri&s;ton, which he had fortified in his la&s;t expedition; and his brother, John of Eltham, whom he had left with Baliol to command his forces, died at Perth in his ab&s;ence. The king arrived at that place in the beginning of November; but as Andrew Murray, at his approach, retired to the fore&s;t of Platen, where he remained during the whole winter, all Edward's military operations amounted to no more than burning and wa&s;ting the open country, and repairing the ca&s;tles of Stirling, Edin|burgh, and Roxburgh. It was at this juncture, that receiving advice of the depredations committed by the French fleet upon his territories and &s;ubjects, he impowered the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the bi&s;hop of London, the earls of Surrey and Lanca&s;ter, with William Clifton, con&s;table of Dover, to hold
<PB N="26" REF="280">
a great council at London, and concert proper means for defending the king dom, and the coa&s;t$ from David de Brus and his adherents: at the &s;ame time, he granted a commi&s;&s;ion to Geoffrey de Say, one of his admirals, to equip a &s;trong fleet, and a&s;&s;ert his dominion in the Engli&s;h &s;ea, which his predece&s;&s;ors had always maintained; and in particular to fall upon the galleys of France, &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> they move towards the coa&s;t of England or Scotland. He had attempted to compromi&s;e his difference with the king of France, in the way of negotiation; but now &s;eeing the affected delays of that monarch terminate in open ho&s;tilities committed at &s;ea by his &s;hips, and in Guienne by his army, he re&s;olved to be trifled with no longer, but prepare for a vigorous war; not only in putting his kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence, but likewi&s;e in &s;trengthening his hands with foreign alliances. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent agents to treat with the duke of Au&s;tria, the archbi&s;hop of Cologne, and the bi&s;hop of Liege; and em|powered his allies, the counts of Hainault, Holland, and Juliers, to contract with &s;uch potentates as they &s;hould think proper to engage in his intere&s;t. In order to attach the duke of Brabant to his cau&s;e, he con&s;ented that a &s;taple of Engli&s;h wool &s;hould be fixed at Bru&s;&s;els; though &s;uch an exportation was very prejudicial to the manufactures of his own country, and diametrically oppo&s;ite to his former policy, which had prompted him to grant extraordinary en|couragement to &s;uch weavers and clothworkers of the Low Countries as &s;hould come over and &s;ettle in England.</P>

The&s;e promotions were the prelude to a war with France, which Edward determined to pro&s;ecute again&s;t Philip, not for the recovery of the lands in Guienne which he had &s;eized, but for his whole kingdom, of which he conceived him&s;elf to be the true heir, as next in blood to the late king. He was encouraged in the&s;e &s;entiments by Robert D'Artois, related to the blood royal of France, who was at this time a refugee in England. That noble|man, who had married Philip$s &s;i&s;ter, pre&s;uming upon this alliance, and his great power and influence in the kingdom, revived a law-&s;uit for the county of Artois, which had been formerly decided in favour of his aunt Maude, daughter of Robert count of A$$o$s; and, in order to &s;upport the proce&s;s, he produced &s;ome deeds forged for the purpo&s;e by a lady of Bethune, called Di|vion, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an amazing talent of counterfeiting &s;eals and writings. The forgery however was detected, and Divion, in con&s;equence of her own<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ General $span$ France.</NOTE> confe&s;&s;ion, condemned to the flames. The deed was cancelled, and Robert di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from court with di&s;grace. Being afterwards &s;ummoned before the court of peers to an&s;wer for this &s;ubornation, he refu&s;ed to appear; and after three citations he was bani&s;hed the kingdom, and his e&s;tate confi&s;cated. Thus exiled he retired into Brabant, from whence he came over to England; where he met with a very honourable reception from Edward, who affected to treat him with the &s;ame di&s;tinction which was paid to David de Brus at the court of France. Being a man of extraordinary courage, experience, and capacity, his advice
<PB N="27" REF="290">
had great weight in the councils of England; and as his re&s;entment again&s;t Philip was implacable, all his advice tended to a war with that monarch, founded on &s;uch a principle as would hardly admit of any accommodation. Edward had offered to leave all his di&s;putes about Guienne to the arbitration of the pope, though he knew that pontiff was in the French intere&s;t; and Be|nedict earne&s;tly exhorted Philip to do him ju&s;tice, that peace being re&s;tored, he might engage in the cru&s;ade again&s;t the infidels. All his remon&s;trances producing nought but eva&s;ive an&s;wers, his holine&s;s pre&s;&s;ed him either to begin the voyage, or refu$d the money which had been rai&s;ed from the clergy of France, by the grant of his predece&s;&s;or, towards the charges of the expedition. Philip, who could no longer amu&s;e him with vague promi&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions, at length plainly gave him to under&s;tand, that he would never conclude a peace with Edward &s;o long as he granted protection to Robert D'Artois; and the king of England would not &s;o far derogate from his own dignity as to with|draw his favour from that nobleman. Neverthele&s;s, the pope &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his mediation, and Edward &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the French court to adju&s;t the articles of a peace, which were at one time &s;ettled to the mutual &s;atisfaction of both parties; when Philip in&s;i&s;ting upon Scotland's being included in the treaty, and that David de Brus &s;hould be re&s;tored to the throne of that kingdom, the negotiation was interrupted until the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould receive farther in&s;tructions on that head from their ma&s;ter, who was &s;o much incen&s;ed at the&s;e new demands, that he &s;wore he would &s;ooner de&s;troy the whole realm of Scot|land, than agree to &s;uch unrea&s;onable conditions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron.

<P>Every thing now pre&s;aged an immediate rupture between the crowns of France and England. The French already commenced ho&s;tilities, by making incur&s;ions into Guienne, and &s;eizing the ca&s;tles of that province. Edward calling a parliament in Lent, explained to them the nature of his dif|ference with Philip, the &s;teps he had taken towards an accommodation, and the progre&s;s he had made in contracting foreign alliances to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his quarrel; and they, as well as the nation in general, glowed with uncommon ardour and impatience to retort the ho&s;tilities which the French had begun. The bi&s;hop of Lincoln, and the earls of Sali&s;bury and Huntingdon, were ap|pointed as emba&s;&s;adors to fini&s;h the treaties which had been &s;et on foot with dif|ferent powers; and an attempt was made to engage Lewis count of Flanders in the league, by the propo&s;al of a marriage between his elde&s;t &s;on and the king's daughter: but he was too intimately connected with Philip to be &s;wayed even by that temptation. The amba&s;&s;adors repairing to the court of Hainault, with a long retinue of young noblemen and knights, who made a very &s;plendid appearance, concluded the treaties with that count, the duke of Brabant, the marquis of Juliers, the counts of Gueldres, Lo&s;&s;e, Mons, Marcke, Palatine, with &s;everal other princes of the empire, and even the emperor Lewis of Ba|varia him&s;elf, who agreed to furni&s;h Edward with a certain number of troops, to be maintained at the expence of England. Though the count of Flanders<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;$rt. Rymer.</NOTE> could not be detached from the intere&s;t of Philip, it was thought proper to tamper with the Flemings, who hated the French, and derived con&s;iderable advantage from their commerce with England. The large towns were in a manner independent of the count, and particularly the city of Ghent, which was actually govern$d by a rich brewer called Jacob Van Ardevelt. This plebeian was a man of an enterpri&s;ing genius, extrem$ly popular, &s;o wealthy that he maintai$$d a guar$ of four$$ore &s;oldiers about his per&s;on,
<PB N="28" REF="300">
and employed &s;pies in all the different towns of Flanders, to give him intelli|gence of every thing that was tran&s;acted either in town or country. He was more powerful than the count him&s;elf, and &s;tuck at no mea&s;ures, however cruel and unju&s;t, to &s;trengthen and maintain his intere&s;t. He had employed his $$i&s;&s;aries to di&s;patch &s;everal noblemen, and bani$h others, who pre&s;umed to $ppo&s;e hi$ power: he confi$$ated their e&s;tates for his own u&s;e, and was become &s;o ab&s;olute and ter$ible$ that no per&s;on would venture to contradict whatever $e thought proper to propo&s;e in the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates of Flanders. This demagogue the bi&s;hop of Lincoln undertook to gain over to the intere&s;t of $dward; while his two colleagues repaired to Bruges and Ypres, which they at la&s;t engaged in the confederacy, by promi&s;e o$ granting them particular priv$$eges in trade.</P>

<P>Count Lewis, on the other hand, exerted all his influence in tra|ver&s;ing the negotiations of the Engli&s;h; and e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Philip with &s;uch a degree of fury, as prompted him to put a nobleman of Courtray to death, without form of proce&s;s, becau&s;e he favoured the intere&s;t of Edward. He &s;ent his natural brother, Guy de Rickenbourg, with a body of forces to &s;ecure the i&s;le of Cad&s;ant, cut off the communication between tho&s;e parts and Brabant, and intercept the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors in their return. The&s;e being apprized of his intention, remained at Dort until a fleet of forty &s;hips was &s;ent for their convoy; then they &s;ailed for England, and in their pa&s;&s;age fell in with two large Flemi&s;h &s;hips of war, having on board the bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, with one hundred and fifty Scotti&s;h gentlemen, a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, and a &s;mall body of &s;oldiers, &s;ent from the king of France to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bru&s;&s;ians in Scotland: the &s;hips were taken and plundered, and the bi&s;hop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> with his followers, cut in pieces. As Guy de Rickenbourg, in being ma&s;ter of Cad&s;ant, had it in his power to intercept all pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea to Bruges and Ghent, Edward re&s;olved to di&s;lodge him from that po&s;t, and &s;ent the earls of Derby and Suffolk, with &s;everal other noblemen and knights, five hundred men at arms, and three thou&s;and archers, o$ board his fleet, to expel the Flemings from the i&s;land. Their landing was ob&s;tinately di&s;puted by Guy de Rickenbourg, at the head of five thou&s;and men; in &s;pite of who&s;e efforts the Engli&s;h made good their footing on the beach, though, even after their land|ing$ a de&s;perate engagement en&s;ued. The earl of Derby was felled to the ground, but re&s;cued by Sir Walter Manny, a gallant knight of Hainault, to $ho&s;e prowe&s;s the victory was in a great mea&s;ure owing. Three thou&s;and of the enemy were killed upon the &s;pot, and a great number of per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction taken pri&s;oners, among whom was their commander; by who&s;e $an&s;om Sir William Manny was enriched. Immediately after this action, $hich happened in the beginning of November, Ardevelt, who had warmly e$pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Edward, pre&s;&s;ed him to come over immediately and head the allies in per&s;on; but he thought proper to po&s;tpone the expedition, becau&s;e &s;ome alteration had happened in his affairs. The count of Holland and Hain|$ult had died in June; and though the &s;on engaged in the confederacy, it &s;uf|fered an irreparable lo&s;s in the death of the father. Edward had appointed John duke of Brabant his heutenant and vicar-general in the kingdom of France, and actually directed him to claim and take &s;ei&s;in of that realm in his name; $ut, as war was not yet declared, the pope laboured with great indu&s;try to prevent the calamities that mu&s;t have attended a rupture between two &s;uch powerful mo|$archs; and, in compliance with the $$q$e&s;t of his holine&s;s, Edward named two

commi&s;&s;ioners to treat of a peace with France and Scotland. Two cardinals were &s;ent over to interpo&s;e their good offices in bringing the treaty to perfection; and in the mean time the parties agreed to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities, till Mid|&s;ummer in the following year. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>In a parliament which met in the beginning of February, Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1338.</NOTE> repre&s;ented the extraordinary occa&s;ion he had for large &s;ums of money, to pay the &s;ub&s;idies which he had granted to his foreign allies; and the prelates, nobility, and freeholders, indulged him with a moiety of their wool, which &s;old for four hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; be&s;ides a duty of two &s;hillings a tun upon wine, added to the u&s;ual cu&s;toms, paid by all foreign merchants: over and above this enormous impo&s;ition, the inferior clergy a&s;&s;embled in convo|cation at St. Bride's in London, granted a tenth of their revenues, exclu&s;ive of the tax of a triennial tenth, to which they had before con&s;ented. This was the heavie&s;t burden that ever had been laid upon the nation, to which it was &s;o grievous, that the king de&s;ired the two archbi&s;hops, and their &s;uffra|gans, to repre&s;ent his nece&s;&s;ities to the people, in &s;uch a manner that they &s;hould bear the load with patience. Va&s;t as the &s;ub&s;idy may &s;eem to have<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. Clau&s;. 12. Edw. III.</NOTE> been, con&s;idering the value of money in tho&s;e days, it was unequal to the ex|pence of his armament, and treaties of alliance; for the German princes were ever as in&s;atiable in their demands, as dilatory in the performance of their con|tracts. The king, about this period, prevailed upon the lords of Le Bret, Cau|mont, and other powerful noblemen of Ga&s;cony, to renonunce their engage|ments with Philip, who had by this time con$i&s;cated Guienne and Ponthieu; he then borrowed money of &s;everal abbeys for pre&s;ent u&s;e, and a&s;&s;embled his army and navy without delay. His elde&s;t &s;on Edward was appointed guardian of the realm; and proper precautions being taken for pre&s;erving the peace of the kingdom in his ab&s;ence, he &s;ailed from the port of Orewell on the nine|teenth day of July, with a fleet of three hundred ve&s;&s;els, attended by the prime nobility of England; and after an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age arrived at Antwerp, the capital city of John duke of Brabant. On the day after his arrival he had a conference with Ardevelt, who per&s;uaded him to a&s;&s;ume the title of king of France, that the Flemings might have a colour for taking up arms again&s;t their lord, and elude the payment of two millions of florins, which they had obliged them&s;elves, on pain of interdict, to pay to the pope, if ever they &s;hould make war on the king of France. Edward, who had long he&s;itated on this &s;ubject, at length complied with their reque&s;t. He had, at the de&s;ire of his holine&s;s, &s;ent the prelates of Canterbury and Durham, with three other amba&s;&s;adors, to the French court, with powers to negotiate and conclude a peace with Philip$ whom he &s;tiled king of France: but now he revoked the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, and prohibited them from doing any thing in his name which might be prejudicial to his right, or con&s;trued into an acknowlegment of Philip's title. As for the homage he had formerly done to that prince, im|plying a full recognition of Philip's right to the throne of that kingdom, he con&s;idered, and d$$owned it as the act of a minor, extorted by the fear o$<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer. $word$.</NOTE> lo&s;ing Guienne.</P>

<P>Though he had taken this &s;tep on purpo&s;e to oblige the Flemings, he $ound his a$$airs in a very unpromi&s;ing &s;ituation.

the beginning of Augu&s;t. At that time all of them appeared at the rendez|vous$ except John duke of Brabant, who, though the king's fir&s;t cou&s;in, had given Philip private a&s;&s;urances that he would never enter into any engagement to his prejudice. John's ab&s;ence &s;erved as a pretence for the re&s;t to decline the performance of their contracts until he &s;hould be ready to concur with them in their operations. The king of England was &s;o chagrined at the&s;e $$a&s;ive ex$u&s;es, that he began to repent of having undertaken the expedition: but, as h$ had proceeded too far to retract with honour, he re&s;olved to attach the duke and in$abitants of Brabant to his intere&s;t, by granting them certain immunities in trade, by which they were heartily engaged in his alliance. John now a&s;&s;ured him that he would renounce all connection with Philip, and concur with the re&s;t of the allies in a&s;&s;i&s;ting Edward to the utmo&s;t of his power. They were again conv$ned about th$ middle of the month, and una|nimou$ly re&s;olved to attack France, if they could procure the &s;anction of the imperial authority, to which they were &s;ubject. This they hoped to obtain without difficulty, as Philip had encroached upon the empire, in taking the $a&s;tle of Cre$ecoeur, and putting a garri&s;on into Cambray, at the de&s;ire of the bi&s;hop, who had demanded his protection. The king &s;ent the marquis of Juliers, and &s;ome other commi&s;&s;ioners, to prepare matters at the imperial court; and he him&s;elf afterwards repaired to Coblentz, where the emperor readily granted all he demanded, and even created him vi$ar of the empire; an office<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> by which his German allies were peculiarly &s;ubjected to his orders. He held an|other council at his return to Brabant$ and it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved that their troops &s;hould rendezvous next year on the eighth day of July, in order to undertake the &s;iege of Cambray. Edward thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s the win$er in Brabant, that he might be at hand to quicken their preparations, and overawe the bi&s;hop of Liege, who adhered to France, &s;ent for his queen to Antwerp, where &s;he was in November delivered of her third &s;on, named Lionel, who was afterwards created duke of Clarence. His alliance with the emperor gave great umbrage to the pope, becau&s;e Lewis of Bavaria, who now $a$ on the imperial throne, had been excommunicated and depo&s;ed by the late pontiff, for having &s;et up an anti-pope, from who&s;e hands he had received the crown. Edward was therefore exhorted to break off all corre&s;pondence with<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> &s;$ch an impious u&s;urper, le&s;t he &s;hould be involved in the &s;ame cen&s;ure. The king, however, paid very little regard to the remon&s;trances of a pontiff who had been always in the intere&s;t o$ his enemy; and although his amba&s;|&s;adors were &s;till employed in treating of a peace at Compeigne and Arras, he $ontinued to exert his indu&s;try in making vigorous preparations for the en&s;uing campaign.

reducing ca&s;tles as he advanced. Then he fell upon the Vermandois; though when he entered this country, which properly belonged to France, the counts of Hainault and Namur retired with their troops, declaring they would not &s;erve out of the territories of the empire. Though thus weakened, he re|$olved to undertake the &s;iege of Cambray, and actually encamped before the place, which he found &s;o well provided for &s;u&s;taining a tedious &s;iege, that he abandoned the enterprize, and marched towards the French army, with which Philip lay encamped in the neighbourhood of Peronne. The two monarchs continued a whole week within two leagues of each other, in the fields be|tween Veroufo&s;&s;e and Flemenguere; and on Wedne&s;day the twentieth of Octo|ber, Edward &s;ent a herald to de&s;ire that Philip would appoint a day for the battle. The French king pitched upon the following Friday, when both armies were drawn out early in the morning; the Engli&s;h and their allies not exceeding &s;even and forty thou&s;and men, and the enemy amounting to double that number. After having &s;tood in order of battle, facing one another the whole day, they retired to their re&s;pective camps, and appeared again next morning in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition. In the afternoon the French retreated into their quarters, which they fortified with trenches, and trunks of trees cut down for the purpo&s;e; while Edward wheeled off towards Ave&s;nes, for the benefit of a more convenient encampment, and &s;ent another me&s;&s;age to Philip, im|porting that he would wait for him all Sunday in order of battle. The French king was inclined to hazard an engagement; but his council repre&s;enting the imprudence of ri&s;quing his crown upon a battle with an enemy whom the weather mu&s;t in a little time compel to retire, he provided his frontier towns with &s;trong garri&s;ons, and retired to Paris; and Edward being informed of his retreat, permitted the Germans to go home, while he him&s;elf, with his own troops, returned to Bru&s;&s;els. Among Philip's &s;ubjects, none di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves &s;o much by their zeal as the Normans, who &s;ent deputies to their king at Vincennes, offering, if he would allow his &s;on John to be their com|mander, to make a de&s;cent in England, and defray the greate&s;t part of the expence that would attend the expedition. They propo&s;ed to furni&s;h four thou&s;and men at arms, ten thou&s;and cro&s;s-bow men, and thirty thou&s;and in|fantry, for the conque&s;t of this kingdom, which was to be given to prince John; and this propo&s;al was qualified with &s;ome articles to which Philip gladly gave his a&s;&s;ent.

Neverthele&s;s, the Normans over-ran the i&s;land of Jer$ey, and even in&s;ulted the coa&s;t of England, on which they &s;urprized and burned the towns of Plymouth and Southampton: but the&s;e d$$redations were retorted by Robert lord Morley, who, with the fl$et under his $ommand, de&s;troyed a great number of &s;hips in different parts of Nor|mandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Da T$l$$r. $ny$l$$$.</NOTE> and reduced Treport to a&s;hes.</P>

to &s;a$$$fy, before he could return to his own country. His ab&s;ence had pro|duced manifold di&s;orders in England, chiefly ari&s;ing from bands of free|booters, formed in different parts of the kingdom, who ravaged the country, and &s;et ju&s;tice at defiance; and the Bru&s;&s;ian Scots took this opportunity to re|tr$eve what they had lo&s;t, and even to make incur&s;ions on the Engli&s;h Marches. In the cour&s;e of the preceding year, Sir Andrew Murray, the guardian of Scotland, had reduced all the places of any &s;trength on the north &s;ide of the river Tay; and defeated a body of four thou&s;and Engli&s;h, commanded by the lord Henry Montfort, who lo&s;t his life in the engagement. The earl of Dunbar having renounced the allegiance he had &s;worn to Edward, after the battle of Hallidowne-hill, and taken the field with Murray, while his ca&s;tle was be&s;ieged by &s;ea and land, by the lord Henry Plantagenet, the earls of Sali&s;$bury, Angus, and Arundel, and gallantly defended by the counte&s;s, who re|ceiving a &s;upply of men and provi&s;ions, under the conduct of Sir William Ram&s;ay, made a furious &s;ally, and ruined all the works of the be&s;iegers. The arrival of this reinforcement, together with the news of Montfort's defeat, induced the Engli&s;h noblemen to rai&s;e the &s;iege, that they might advance to the relief of their countrymen. For this purpo&s;e, they &s;ent two large detach|ments from the main army, by different routes, under the command of Wil|liam Talbot, and lord Richard Montague, who joining at Panmuir, in Angus, were defeated, and Talbot was taken pri&s;oner. The ca&s;tles of Edinburgh, Stirling, and Coupar, were now the only places of con&s;equence remaining in the hands of Baliol. Sir William Douglas had made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e; and about this time the Bru&s;&s;ians &s;u&s;tained an irre|parable lo&s;s in the death of their guardian, in which office he was &s;ucceeded by Robert Stewart, who was connected with David by the ties of con&s;anguinity. He inve&s;ted and took the town of Perth, which was well fortified, and &s;upplied with a &s;trong garri&s;on; and the ca&s;tle of Coupar was &s;urrendered to him by William Bullock, trea&s;urer to Edward Baliol, who &s;eems to have betrayed his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ford$n.</NOTE> tru&s;t, and revolted to the Bru&s;&s;ian intere&s;t.</P>

<P>The party of Baliol being now totally &s;ubdued in Scotland, and all the conque&s;ts of Edward in that country lo&s;t in his ab&s;ence, the Bru&s;|&s;ians ventured to retaliate the mi&s;eries they had undergone, by depredations upon his &s;ubjects, and ravaged the northern counties of England. In order to repel the&s;e incur&s;ions, the parliament, which met in October, appointed commi&s;&s;ion|ers of array to levy forces; and the clergy, in the convocation of York, were enjoined to grant an aid for the defence of the Marches. The king had &s;ent over agents to explain the nature of his nece&s;&s;ities to this parliament, and de|mand a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy; in con&s;ideration of which, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was impowered to grant &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions as they could in rea&s;on de&s;ire. The earls and barons taking the affair into deliberation, agreed to give the tythe of their flocks and corn for one year; but the knights of the &s;hire alledged that they could not agree to this &s;ub&s;idy, until they &s;hould have con|&s;ulted their con&s;tituents; and de&s;ired they might be indulged with time for that purpo&s;e.

and the duke of Brabant would not con&s;ent to his going over to England$ until he had given &s;ecurity for his returning within a week after Mid&s;ummer. He pre&s;ented that nobleman with a grant of fifteen hundred pounds a year; and promi&s;ed to gratify the marquis of Juliers with an earldom in England. He made another fruitle&s;s attempt to gain over the count of Flanders to his intere&s;t, by promi&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the recovery of Artois, to which he had &s;ome preten&s;ions, and propo&s;ing a match between his elde&s;t &s;on and Edward's daughter I&s;abel. Though he could not detach the count from Philip, he con|tracted a clo&s;er connection with the Flemings, by engaging to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the recovery of Lille, Douay, and Bethune, which they had been forced to give up to Philip as pledges of their fidelity; and &s;eeing no hope of an ac|commodation, quartered the arms of France with tho&s;e of England. The in|&s;cription on the great &s;eal was altered from Duke of Aquitain to King of France; and, in&s;tead of the former motto, he a&s;&s;umed that of Dieu et mon Droit, alluding to the de&s;ign of &s;upporting his preten&s;ions to the crown of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rainald.

<P>The treaty between Edward and the Flemings being ratified at Ghent, they did homage, and took the oath of allegiance to him, as the lord paramount of their country; and then he publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, a&s;&s;erting his right to the crown of France, and ju&s;tifying the &s;teps he had taken in &s;upport of his claim. In a con&s;ultation with his allies, it was agreed that the next<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1340.</NOTE> campaign &s;hould be opened with the &s;iege of Tournay: then embarking for England, he landed at Harwich in February; and that &s;ame day i&s;&s;ued out writs for convoking a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, on the twenty-ninth day of March. In the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, which was held in January, provi&s;ion had been made for fortifying Southampton, and the i&s;le of Wight, equipping a fleet of one hundred and fifty &s;ail, to guard the channel, &s;ending &s;upplies to the ca&s;tles of Edinburgh and Stirling, and rai&s;ing a number of men at arms, light hor&s;e, and archers, for the defence of the Marches. Some offers had been made of a &s;upply for his maje&s;ty's occa&s;ions, but as he him&s;elf arrived in the mean time, the con&s;ideration of that affair was po&s;tponed to this new parliament, from which he received a very extraordinary aid, con&s;i&s;ting of the ninth &s;heaf of corn, the ninth fleece and lamb for two years, to be levied on the prelates, earls, barons, and all the freeholders and tenants of the kingdom: the citizens and burge&s;&s;es paid a ninth of their goods and merchandize; but &s;uch trade&s;men and inhabitants as lived in wa&s;tes and fore&s;ts were taxed only at a fifteenth of their moveables. In con&s;ideration of the&s;e &s;upplies, the king con&s;ented to the remi&s;&s;$on of old debts and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of the fore&s;t, contracted and committed before his coronation: the two charters, with the privileges and franchi&s;es of boroughs, were confirmed; an uniformity of weights and mea&s;ures was e&s;tabli&s;hed through the whole kingdom; and many whole&s;ome regulations were made for redre&s;&s;ing the grievances of the &s;ubject, in the op|pre&s;&s;ion practi&s;ed by goalers, the delay of law-&s;uits, and the frauds of &s;heriffs, in farming hundreds at higher rates than were paid to the crown. It was decreed that all pardons for murders or felonies, contrary to the tenour of the corona|tion oath, &s;hould be deemed null; and the king waved his right of purveyance, in the contracts to be made with merchants, $or &s;upplying his forces or garri&s;ons with provi&s;ion. The parliament likewi&s;e enacted a &s;tatute, declaring that tho' Edward a&s;&s;umed the title of king of France, the realm of England owed no

Among t$e&s;e the French gained a con&s;iderable advantage over the E$gli&s;h, in an a$tion n$ar Lille, where the $arl of Sali&s;bury, and Robert Uf|for$$<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> $$$e&s;t &s;on to the earl of Su$$olk, were taken pri&s;oners. Edward having ob$$in$d all he could expect from a complying parliament, and created the marquis of Juli$rs $$rl of Cambridge, i&s;&s;ued writs for calling a new a&s;&s;embly, to be held in July, under the au&s;pices of his &s;on prince Edward, duke of Co$$wal; and in t$$ mean time re&s;olved to return to the continent. He was in$$rmed by the duke of Gueldres, that Philip of Valois had marched at the he$$ o$ a v$&s;t army to the frontiers of the Low Countries, and equipped a $word$ of four hun$r$d &s;ail, manned by Normans, Picards, and Genoe&s;e, under t$$ command of three admirals, to intercept the king of England in his re|t$rn to Flanders. Notwith&s;tanding this intelligence, Edward re&s;olved to cro&s;s the &s;ea at the time he had fixed for his departure, which was the thirteenth day of June, and payed &s;o little regard to the remon&s;trances of his chancellor the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, who endeavoured to divert him from his purpo&s;e, that this pr$late re&s;igned the &s;eals, and withdrew from court. The king, &s;tartl$d at his re&s;ignation, con&s;ulted with lord Morley and Crab, his two $hief admirals; and they confirming the &s;ugge&s;tions of the archbi&s;hop, he $rdered the naval force of his kingdom to be a&s;&s;embled, to the number of two hundred and &s;ixty &s;ail, for his convoy, and &s;ending for the archbi&s;hop, r$-delivered the &s;eals into his hand. He ordered this fleet to be well manned with a &s;trong body of men at arms, and archers; and having borrowed twenty th$u&s;and marks of the city of London, for pre&s;ent u&s;e, &s;et &s;ail from Orewell, $tte$ded by the principal nobility of England. Next day, in making the land of Blanckenberg, he de&s;cried the ma&s;ts and &s;treamers of the enemy's f$eet lying in the harbour of Sluys, and &s;et on &s;hore &s;ome knights to ob&s;erve t$em more narrowly, and bring an account of their number: but they returned with their intelligence &s;o late, that he could not begin the engagement that evening; and was obliged to lie all night at anchor. In the morning of Mid|&s;ummer-day, he perceived the French fleet advanced about a mile without the harbour, $lr$ady drawn up in three great divi&s;ions. He forthwith made the $$ke di&s;po&s;it$on, &s;tationing his large&s;t &s;hips in the fir&s;t line, well &s;upplied with archers a$d men at arms alternately. He ordered the &s;econd divi&s;ion to keep $word$ and pr$vent the fir&s;t from being inclo&s;ed by the enemy, as well as to a&s;&s;i&s;t it in any $xigence; and the third was r$&s;erved for the protection$ $f the l$$ies, $nd tran&s;ports loa$ed with baggage, and implements of war. Having thus f$rmed his order of battle, he hauled upon a wind, in order to gain the w$$th$r-gage; and then bearing down upon the enemy, began &agrave;

de&s;perate engagement, which la&s;ted from ten in the morning till &s;even at night. The &s;hips immediately grappling each other, the troops on board fought hand to hand with incredible fury: the noblemen and knights exerted all their prowe$s in &s;ignalizing them&s;elves under the eye of their &s;overeign, who ani|mated them by his own example: the Engli&s;h archers, who excelled all the world in bowman&s;hip, made a terrible &s;laughter among the French and Ge|noe&s;e; and the men at arms boarding their &s;hips, attacked them with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible valour, that they leaped into the &s;ea by hundreds, in order to avoid the horrors of the a&s;&s;ault. The fir&s;t line of the French being thus de|feated by main force, and the &s;econd already di&s;ordered, lord Morley arrived with the northern fleet, and &s;ome Flemi&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and falling in among the &s;hattered &s;quadrons of the enemy, bore down all oppo&s;ition. At length Ed|ward obtained a complete victory. Two of the French admirals were &s;lain, with upwards of twenty thou&s;and men; and though &s;ixty &s;ail e&s;caped under the third admiral, two hundred and thirty of their large&s;t &s;hips were taken. The king was wounded &s;lightly in the thigh, and his lo&s;s amounted to about four thou&s;and men who fell in the battle: he pa&s;&s;ed that night on board, and next day landed with all his forces at Sluys; from whence he marched to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.

<P>This glorious victory not only animated the Engli&s;h to &s;up|port their monarch to the utmo&s;t of their endeavours, but encouraged his al|lies on the continent to redouble their vigour, in executing the plans of the confederacy. The&s;e Edward a&s;&s;embled in a general council at Vilvorden, where the countries of Flanders, Brabant, and Hainault, engaged in a clo&s;e union for their mutual defence, under the arbitration of Edward, whom they impowered to decide in all di&s;putes that might happen in the cour&s;e of their a&s;|&s;ociation. At the &s;ame time it was agreed, that two armies &s;hould be formed without delay; one to be compo&s;ed of Flemings, reinforced with a body of Engli&s;h archers; and the other to con&s;i&s;t of Edward's own troops, with tho&s;e of the allies. The fir&s;t, amounting to fifty thou&s;and men, was &s;ent under the conduct of Robert D'Artois, to inve&s;t St. Omer, the garri&s;on of which was commanded by Eudes IV. duke of Burgundy, and the count D'Armagnac; while the other, which was twice as numerous, was employed by the king in per&s;on in the &s;iege of Tournay. Robert D'Artois &s;at down before St. Omer on the twenty-&s;econd day of July; but his operations were &s;oon at an end, by the cowardice of the Flemi&s;h troops, who being &s;eized with a panic, fled in the utmo&s;t precipitation, even before any enemy appeared. Edward ad|vancing towards Tournay, &s;ent an herald to Philip de Valois, challenging him to decide their quarrel by &s;ingle combat, or by fighting at the head of one hundred men, to &s;pare the effu&s;ion of chri&s;tian blood; or, &s;hould he de|cline accepting this defiance, to appoint a day for a general engagement be|fore the walls of Tournay. Philip di&s;avowed this addre&s;s, becau&s;e it was not directed to the king of France; but &s;ignified that he would not &s;toop &s;o far beneath his own dignity, as to put him&s;elf on a footing with his va&s;&s;al, whom he would cha&s;ti&s;e for his rebellion in a manner more &s;uitable to the in&s;olence and perfidy of his conduct.</P>

and commanded by two mare&s;chals of France; Edward found it impracti|cable to red$ce i$ by force; and after having made &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful a&s;&s;aults, conv$$$ed the &s;iege into a blockade, in hope of compelling them by famine to &s;$rr$nder. Phi$$p had appointed the rendezvous of his forces at Arras, where he was $oined by David de Brus king of Scotland, Philip king of Navarre, John king of Bohemia, the dukes of Brittany and Lorraine, the bi&s;hops of Liege, Me$z, and Verdun, the counts of Bar, Montbeliard, Genoa, and Sa $$y; a$d the &s;uccours brought by the&s;e princes, when joined to the forces of $$$nce, formed an immen&s;e army, which was deemed &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the $$ege of Tournay. With this view Philip marched from Arras, and encamped b$tween the bridges of Cre&s;&s;in and Bouvines, where he lay inactive for &s;everal wee$$; during which many feats of chivalry were performed by the individuals of ea$h army. The town being at la&s;t reduced to extremity for want of pro|v$$ion$, mu&s;t have &s;urrendered $o Edward, or el&s;e Philip mu&s;t have hazarded a battl$ for its relief, had not Jane, counte&s;s dowager of Hainault, &s;i&s;ter to Philip, and mother to Philippa queen of England, quitted the mona&s;tery to which &s;he had retired, and interpo&s;ed her good offices towards an accommoda|tion. Her endeavours were &s;econded by her &s;on-in-law the marquis of Ju$iers, John de Hai$$ult, and the duke of Brabant; and both parties agreed to a ce&s;&s;$tion of ho&s;$$lities for three days, during which they propo&s;ed to &s;e$$le the cond$ti$ns of a p$$ification. Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed, and the confe|r$nces opened in the church of E&s;plechin, where, by dint of Jane's intreaties, they concluded a truce for the Low Countries and Guienne, to continue till Mid&s;ummer. It was &s;tipulated that both &s;ides &s;hould retain the places which they then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; that the &s;iege &s;hould be rai&s;ed; and the Scots, with &s;ome of the allies, have the benefit of the ce&s;&s;ation, provided they &s;hould think it worthy their acceptance. Edward, immediately after this impolitic truce, by which he gave up Tournay, and all the pro&s;pects of a pro&s;perous campaign, ap|pointed plenipotentiaries to treat with tho&s;e of France at Arras, concerning a $olid pacification, which the pope &s;till continued to mediate with very little effect. The king of England was become &s;o moderate that he now in&s;i&s;ted upon nothing but the enjoyment and undi&s;puted &s;overeignty of Guienne: but this the French ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to grant, or even to treat upon the &s;ubject, until he &s;hould renounce the title of king of France, which he had lately a&s;|&s;umed. The&s;e difficulties appearing in&s;urmountable, the conferences were &s;oon broke off, and all that the mediators could obtain was a prolongation of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ R$m$r. $word$ W$$&s;ingham.</NOTE> truce for a year longer, and the exchange of &s;ome pri&s;oners.</P>

<P>By this time Edward found cau&s;e to repent of having incon+&s;$derately engaged in an expen&s;ive war, from which he &s;aw no pro&s;pect of extri|cating him&s;elf with honour. He could not pretend to maintain it without allies; and they were &s;o venal and rapacious, that he could neither depend upon their integrity, nor feed the$r avarice. He had as yet received no re|mittances from England; &s;o that being unab$e to pay their &s;ub&s;idies, his re|putation began to &s;uffer, and their attachment to waver. They were afraid of incen&s;ing France beyond a hope of reconciliation; and, in this apprehen&s;ion, extorted Edward's a&s;&s;ent to the truce which had lately been concluded. He had been obliged to &s;ilence their clamorous demands with bonds at an exorbi|tant intere&s;t; and now leaving Henry of $anca&s;ter earl of Derby, in pawn for $$e payment, &s;tole away privately to Z$aland, where he embarked with his

queen for England. After a very &s;tormy pa&s;&s;age of three days, he landed on the la&s;t day of November, about midnight, at the Tower of London, which he found utterly unguarded. Nicholas de la Beche, the con&s;table, who was ab|&s;ent from his duty, and all his &s;ubalterns, were impri&s;oned for their negli+gence and relaxation of di&s;cipline. But the king's re&s;entment fell &s;till heavier on the officers of the revenue, to whom he imputed the di&s;honour which he had &s;u&s;tained on the continent. The bi&s;hops of Chiche&s;ter and Litchfield were deprived of their offices of chancellor and trea&s;urer; Sir John St. Paul, keeper of the privy &s;eal, the &s;heriffs of counties, the collectors of taxes, and other public officers, were turned out of their employments; and a commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued for enquiring into their failures and mi&s;demeanours, for which they were puni&s;hed with great &s;everity.</P>

<P>John Stratford archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, had been ve&s;ted with the charge of paying the king's debts to the towns and merchants of Brabant and Flanders: tho' the fir&s;t year's ninth had been a&s;&s;igned for that purpo&s;e, the col|lectors neglected to remit the money; and their negligence was one cau&s;e of the king's di&s;grace and di&s;appointment at Tournay. Edward &s;ent Nicholas de Can|taloup with a public notary to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, to warn that pre|late to take care of his bonds, and either di&s;charge them immediately, or cro&s;s the &s;ea to Flanders, and re&s;ide in that country until the money &s;hould be paid. In the mean time he de&s;ired the metropolitan would come to court, and give an account of the proceedings of tho&s;e to whom he had entru&s;ted the management of the revenue. Stratford excu&s;ed him&s;elf from appearing at court, where he &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the malice of his enemies; and &s;aid he would con&s;ider of the other part of the king's propo&s;al. Far from complying with Edward's de&s;ire, he &s;um|moned the clergy and laity of Canterbury to the cathedral, where, in an elaborate harrangue, he extolled the conduct of Thomas Becket, blamed him&s;elf for having been too much engro&s;&s;ed in &s;ecular affairs, declared his re&s;olution for &s;upporting the rights of the church; and, as the impri&s;oned officers were generally clergy|men, denounced the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t all who &s;hould &s;eize the per&s;ons, lands, or effects, of the clergy, invade the liberties of the church and Magna Charta, or inform again&s;t a bi&s;hop for trea&s;on, or any capital of|fence. He afterwards, in a letter to the king, communicated the cen&s;ures he had pa&s;&s;ed, complained of the impri&s;onment of the clergy, which had been owing to the &s;ugge&s;tions of evil coun&s;ellors; exhorted him to &s;ummon the pre|lates and peers of the land, in order to promote a proper enquiry concerning the embezzl$ment of the wool and money, which had been granted in the late parliament; and offered to &s;tand to the judgment of his peers, &s;aving the rights of the holy church, and the dignity of his own order. The king<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1341$</NOTE> having peru&s;ed this letter, &s;ent Ralph lord Stafford, &s;teward of his hou&s;hold, to require the archbi&s;hop's attendance at court, about affairs of the greate&s;t im|portance to the king and kingdom. John pretended that he could not obey the king's order, with any regard to his own per&s;onal &s;afety; but this ob|j$ction being removed by the grant of a &s;afe-conduct, he formed other eva&s;ive excu&s;es to colour his di&s;obedience. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf champion for the liberties of the clergy; &s;ent mandates to his &s;uffragans to publi&s;h his cen&s;ures, and inhibit eccle&s;ia&s;tics from paying the ninth lately granted in parliament, on pretence of their being liable to a tenth whi$h they had before voted in convo|cation. The king, in$en&s;ed $t his conduct, forbade the bi&s;hops to publi&s;h the
<PB N="$$" REF="400">
cen&s;ures or the mandate; and wrote a letter to the prior and chapter of Can|terbury, giving a detail of the archbi&s;hop's mi&s;demeanours, and ordering them to publi&s;h it in all proper places. About this &s;ame time &s;ome merchants of Br$b$nt, empowered by the duke, repaired to Canterbury, and being refu&s;ed a$mittance to the archbi&s;hop, fixed a cit$tion on the public cro&s;s, near the gate of the priory, requiring him in the duke's name to appear in his courts of $u&s;tice, to an&s;wer for the debts in which he was bound, and remain in the Low Countries until they &s;hould be di&s;charged. Stratford made a public de|$ence in the pulpit to the articles of his charge, contained in the king's letter, which he treated as a &s;candalous libel; and publi&s;hed an apology for the vin|dication of his conduct, in which he expatiated upon the &s;ervices he had done the &s;tate, particularly in making two and thirty voyages to the conti|nent at his own expence. The king made a reply to this apology, which he accu&s;ed as fal&s;e and in&s;olent; and forbade him, and all other bi&s;hops, to publi&s;h any &s;piritual cen&s;ures prejudicial to the royal prerogative, as exerci&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;ors. An information was preferred again&s;t the archbi&s;hop in the court of exchequer, before which he was &s;ummoned to appear; but he re|fu&s;ed to plead to a charge of &s;uch importance before any other juri&s;diction than that of the lords &s;piritual and temporal a&s;&s;embled in parliament.</P>

<P>When this a&s;&s;embly met in April at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the metropolitan, &s;ecured by a &s;afe-conduct, appeared with a pompous train of bi&s;hops and clergy; but was not permitted to take his &s;eat until he &s;hould have put in an an&s;wer to the articles exhibited again&s;t him in the exchequer. He received a copy of this accu&s;ation, of which he promi&s;ed to con&s;ider, and then in&s;i&s;ted upon taking his &s;eat as the fir&s;t peer of the realm. Being again denied ad|mittance, he &s;tood at the door gra&s;ping his cro&s;s, and declaring his re&s;olu|tion to maintain the rights of the church; but all his efforts were ineffectual, even though he &s;ollicited &s;ome lords, as they came from the hou&s;e, to u&s;e their good offices with the king in his behalf. Di&s;graced as he was, he had a &s;trong party among the temporal peers, as well as the bi&s;hops, who were deeply in|tere&s;ted in his quarrel; and they re&s;olved to exert them&s;elves in his favour. When the king, in a full meeting of both hou&s;es, de&s;ired they would repre&s;ent all manner of grievances, that the &s;ubjects might obtain redre&s;s, they con&s;ulted together, and brought in a bill, couched in the form of a petition, importing that the peers of the land &s;hould not be bound to an&s;wer for any offences charged upon them by the king, except in parliament: that this demand ap|pearing incon&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of the government, which would not admit of waiting for the convocation of a parliament to puni&s;h every offen|der, they petitioned the king for leave to appoint a committee of twelve per|&s;ons to con&s;ider in what ca&s;es peers &s;hould be bound to an&s;wer in any other court than that of the parliament. After &s;ome debate it was agreed that peers &s;hould be tried only by their peers in parliament; and that their temporalities, lands, tenements, and effects, &s;hould not be &s;eized, nor their per&s;ons arre&s;ted, for any thing relating to any office they &s;hould enjoy under the crown; &s;aving, however, the king's rights, and the &s;uit of parties; and provided that tho&s;e peers who were &s;heriffs, or farmers of counties in fee, or had received any of the king's money and effects, &s;hould accompt for it by them&s;elves, or their at|torneys, in the u&s;ual places. This law immediately affected the ca&s;e of the archbi&s;hop, who declared him&s;elf ready to an&s;wer the articles in full parliament.
<PB N="39" REF="410">
Having made his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the king, in the Painted-Chamber, he was very graciou&s;ly received, admitted to his &s;eat, and a&s;&s;ured of being heard as &s;oon as the affairs of &s;tate &s;hould be regulated. The bi&s;hops of Durham and Sa|rum, the earls of Northampton, Arundel, Warwick, and Sali&s;bury, were ap|pointed to receive and deliberate upon his an&s;wers, which &s;hould be referred to the next parliament; but by that time he found means to recover the king's favour, and the proce&s;s again&s;t him was annulled. Before this &s;e&s;&s;ion broke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Angl. Sacr. Rot. Parl.</NOTE> up, the prelates and nobility in&s;i&s;ted upon Edward's confirming the two char|ters, and redre&s;&s;ing the grievances of the nation. They propo&s;ed that the king &s;hould, on the third day of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, re&s;ume all po&s;ts and places into his own hands, that the officers might be put to an&s;wer all the charges that &s;hould be brought again&s;t them in parliament; that all the great officers of the crown, and the judges, &s;hould be &s;worn to maintain the two charters, and all the privileges of the nobility, clergy, towns, and corporations. But the&s;e two points were over-ruled, as being deemed &s;ufficiently &s;ecured by the laws already in force. They demanded, however, in a more peremptory manner, that the clergy &s;hould be exempted from the attachment of their per&s;ons and effects, as well as from fines impo&s;ed by lay judges without the concurrence of their ordinary; that the king's officers &s;hould not enter their hou&s;es, granges, or churches; and that the civil judges &s;hould not take cognizance of u&s;urers, commutation-money, te&s;tamentary and matrimonial accompts, which they al|ledged were matters belonging to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction. The&s;e, and other articles, were drawn up in the form of a &s;tatute, and confirmed by the great &s;eal; though much again&s;t the inclination of Edward, who&s;e nece&s;|&s;ities obliged him to comply with their demands, as they refu&s;ed to deliberate upon &s;ub&s;idies until this affair was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The chancellor, trea&s;urer, and &s;everal judges, prote&s;ted again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ing of this act; and the king declared he would revoke, with the fir&s;t opportunity, every grant or conce&s;&s;ion that &s;hould be extorted from him in &s;uch a manner. He accordingly, in a great council held about Michaelmas, annulled this &s;tatute, as far as he had power &s;o to do, and inhibited the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury from taking any &s;tep in the en&s;uing provincial &s;ynod, towards the confirmation of that pretended &s;tatute, or the prejudice of his royal dignity and prerogative. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE></P>

<P>Whatever reluctance Edward might have had to a compliance with a demand of this nature, he &s;aw it was the only expedient by which his nece&s;&s;ities could be relieved; and in that light it was very convenient and ef|fectual; for this &s;tatute was no &s;ooner confirmed, than the parliament indulged him with a &s;ub&s;idy of twenty thou&s;and &s;acks of wool, to be tran&s;ported to Flan|ders, before Michaelmas; and all other per&s;ons were prohibited from &s;ending over any quantity of the &s;ame merchandize till after that period, on pain of forfeiting thrice the value, together with life and member. This aid, how|ever, did not arrive in time to repair the damage which his credit had &s;uffered in the preceding campaign. The emperor Lewis, di&s;appointed in his expecta|tion of Engli&s;h money, and influenced by French gold, as well as by the in|&s;tances of his wife, who was niece to Philip de Valois, deprived Edward of the vicariat of the empire, and e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of his enemy. The archbi&s;hops of Mentz and Cologne, with other princes of the empire, en|gaged in the &s;ervice of France; the pope effected an accommodation between the count of Hainault and the bi&s;hop of Cambray; and the French garri&s;on

While Edward found him&s;elf thus abandoned by all his allies $n the continent, and utterly di&s;abled from carrying on the war in Flanders, he was, by an unexpected event, furni&s;hed with an opportunity of attacking Philip, in the very heart of his dominions, with le&s;s expence, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>John III. duke of Brittany dying without i&s;&s;ue, left his dominions to his niece Jane, married to Charles de Blois, nephew to the king of France: but John de Montford claiming the dutchy as his brother, was received as the &s;ucce&s;&s;or by the people of Nantes, where he &s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, that his title might be recognized. The majority of the nobles having already taken the oath to Charles de Blois, whom they con&s;idered as the true heir, in right of his wife, and as a prince who would be &s;upported by the whole power of France, the a&s;&s;embly was very thin, and indeed no per&s;on of con&s;equence attended, except Henry de Leon, a nobleman of great valour, experience, and intere&s;t. John, however, with his brother's money, which he &s;eized, began to levy troops, and a&s;&s;embled an army, with which he re|duced a great number of towns and ca&s;tles that adhered to his rival; but, as he expected a vigorous oppo&s;ition from France, he re&s;olved to &s;trengthen his cau&s;e with &s;ome powerful alliance. With this view he had recour&s;e to Edward king of England, who being now di&s;engaged from his German allies, em|braced his propo&s;als without he&s;itation. John came over to the Engli&s;h court, where, by the interpo&s;ition of his kin&s;man Robert D'Artois, the treaty was &s;oon concluded, and he returned to Nantes, where he received a citation to attend the court of peers in France, in order to prove his title to the dutchy of Bretagne. Con&s;idering the &s;teps he had taken, and the little rea&s;on he had to expect impartiality from Philip, who was uncle to his competitor, &s;ound<NOTE PLACE="marg">D'Argentr&eacute; H$$$ de Bre|tagne.</NOTE> policy, and the dictates of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, ought to have prevented him from obeying the &s;ummons; in con&s;equence of which, however, he went to Paris at the appointed time, with four hundred gentlemen in his retinue. At his fir&s;t audience, Philip told him he had no right to the dutchy; and even charged him with having entered into alliances with the enemies of France: but he excu&s;ed his voyage to England, on pretence of &s;olliciting for the earldom of Richmond, which his brother had enjoyed; and with re&s;pect to the dutchy, he expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to &s;tand trial, and abide by the deci&s;ion of his judges. The king promi&s;ed that his title &s;hould be examined within a fort|night; and in the mean time ordered him to keep within the walls of Paris. John perceiving from this premature declaration, how little he had to expect from the ju&s;tice of Philip; and apprehending that monarch's de&s;ign was to arre&s;t his per&s;on, until he &s;hould have delivered up all the towns and fortre&s;&s;es he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Brittany, was now convinced of the erroneous &s;tep he had taken, and &s;aw no other way of extricating him&s;elf than that of a private and preci|pitate retreat. Having taken his re&s;olution on this &s;ubject, he amu&s;ed Philip with a petition to be admitted to pay homage, and directed his agents to re|double their &s;ollicitations. Mean while, he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the dre&s;s of a burgher, and with four attendants quitted Paris early in the morning. The
<PB N="41" REF="430">
re&s;t of his retinue and dome&s;tics remained at his lodgings, and provided for his table as u&s;ual, giving out that he him&s;elf was confined in his chamber by an indi&s;po&s;ition. In this manner was his departure concealed for four days, during which he arrived in his own territories; but, Philip was no &s;ooner ap|pri&s;ed of his retreat, than he gave way to the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his indigna|tion; ordered the parliament of Paris to adjudge Brittany to Charles de Blois, without waiting to proceed in the u&s;ual forms; and immediately confi&s;cated the county of Montfort. That the fugitive might feel his re&s;entment &s;till more &s;en&s;ibly, he &s;upplied Charles with a numerous army, which rendezvou&s;ed at Angers, under the command of his elde&s;t &s;on John duke of Normandy, at|tended<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE> by &s;everal princes of the blood and the flower of the French nobility. The fir&s;t attempt was on Chantoceaux, which &s;u&s;tained &s;everal a&s;&s;aults before it &s;urrendered; then they inve&s;ted Nantes, the reduction of which they owed to the treachery of the citizens. Henry de Leon the governor having made a &s;ally, in which two hundred of the inhabitants were taken pri&s;oners, John de Montfort reprimanded him for the ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct in &s;uch a manner that he could not dige&s;t the affront, and is &s;aid to have betrayed his ma&s;ter. The gates of the place were next morning opened to the French, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city without re&s;i&s;tance; and &s;eizing John in the ca&s;tle, &s;ent him directly to Paris, where he continued &s;everal years in pri&s;on.</P>

<P>This di&s;a&s;ter would have effectually cru&s;hed his party, had not his intere&s;t been maintained by the extraordinary talents of his wife Jane of Flanders, a lady of a ma&s;culine genius, who fought like a warrior in the field, and &s;poke like a politician in the council. She happened to be at Rennes when her hu&s;band was taken pri&s;oner; but his misfortune did not drive her to de&s;pair. She forthwith a&s;&s;embled the citizens, and holding in her arms her in|fant &s;on, recommended him to their protection, as the la&s;t male heir of the race of their dukes, in &s;uch a pathetic manner that they re&s;olved to &s;pend their lives and fortunes in his &s;ervice: then &s;he &s;ecured the fidelity of the troops by dint of large&s;&s;es; and appointing William Cadoudal governor of the city, conveyed her &s;on to Hennebon, a con&s;iderable port in Brittany, to wait for &s;uccours from England, in pur&s;uance of the treaty concluded between Edward and her hu&s;band. A body of troops had been actually a&s;&s;embled for this &s;er|vice, under Robert D'Artois, Walter de Manny, and the lords Morley, Ferrers, Tibetot, and Bardolph, and a fleet provided for their tran&s;portation; but, be|fore the time fixed for their departure from Port&s;mouth, Edward's pre&s;ence was required in the north to watch the turn of affairs in Scotland.</P>

<P>While he was engaged at the &s;iege of Tournay, in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, William lord Douglas had taken the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh by &s;urprize; and the Scots being comprehended in the truce concluded with Philip, no ho&s;tilities were committed in that country till Mid&s;ummer, when the term of the ce&s;&s;ation expired. Then they inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Stirling, and carried on their attacks with &s;uch vigour that the garri&s;on was obliged to capitulate before Edward could march to its relief. Though he could not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1342.</NOTE> prevent this di&s;a&s;ter, he determined to revenge it with the de&s;olation of all Scotland. For this purpo&s;e he i&s;&s;ued orders for a&s;&s;embling an army of fifty thou&s;and men at Newca&s;tle by the twenty-fourth day of January; and equip|ped a powerful fleet to attend the motions of his land-forces and &s;upply them
<PB N="42" REF="440">
with provi&s;ion in the barren country through which he meaned to penetrate. The lord Robert Steward guardian of Scotland, Douglas, and other noblemen of that realm, alarmed at the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a mighty armament, re&s;olved if po&s;&s;ible to avoid the &s;torm which impended over their country, and &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;adors to Edward to &s;ollicit a truce for &s;ix months, on condition of &s;ub|mitting to his government, provided David de Brus &s;hould not before the fir&s;t day of May return from France with &s;uccours, and a&s;&s;emble a force able to meet the Engli&s;h in fair battle. Perhaps the king of England would have lent a deaf ear to this propo&s;al, had not his fleet, on which he in a great mea&s;ure depended, been di&s;per&s;ed, &s;hattered, and rendered un&s;erviceable by a tempe&s;t; but this being the ca&s;e, he con&s;ented to the truce, upon receiving &s;ecurity for the performance of articles, and returned in the beginning of February to London. This &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities however was of &s;hort duration; for David returning to Scotland, the truce was terminated of cour&s;e. Sir Alexan|der Ram&s;ay took the ca&s;tle of Roxburgh by &s;calade, and was appointed go|vernor of that fortre&s;s; but was afterwards &s;tarved to death by William<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Douglas, who&s;e jealou&s;y could not bear a rival in reputation. William Bul|lock was &s;lain about the &s;ame time by David Barclay; and other de&s;perate f$uds breaking out between powerful noblemen, involved the whole kingdom in carnage and confu&s;ion. This was no time to maintain a war again&s;t &s;uch a powerful neighbour as England; and David Brus, being &s;ollicitous to heal the&s;e fatal divi&s;ions, endeavoured to procure a re&s;pite from ho&s;tilities. Ed|ward, being intent upon the affairs of Brittany, was not aver&s;e to a treaty, which was accordingly brought upon the carpet; and though a &s;olid peace could not be effected, a truce was concluded, with the con&s;ent of France, for<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> two years, and afterwards renewed for two years longer.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Jane of Brittany &s;ent Amaury de Cli&s;&s;on to forward the &s;uccours from England; and that officer brought over her young &s;on to be educated in the court of London, as a place of &s;afety: at the &s;ame time &s;he propo&s;ed a match between him and one of the king's daugh|ters, which afterwards took effect; and offered to put Bre&s;t and &s;ome other for|tre&s;&s;es into his hands, as &s;ecurity for his being reimbur&s;ed whatever he &s;hould expend in her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Edward, being very well &s;atisfied with her propo|&s;als, i&s;&s;ued orders for a&s;&s;embling one hundred &s;hips at Harwich, to tran&s;port Sir Walter de Manny with three thou&s;and archers and a good number of other troops to Brittany; another fleet was ordered to rendezvous at Port&s;mouth, for the conveyance of a &s;tronger reinforcement, under the com|mand of William de Bohun earl of Northampton, whom the king appointed his lieutenant in the realm of France and dutchy of Brittany; and he was ac|companied by Robert D' Artois and a great number of Engli&s;h noblemen$ Mean while Charles de Blois, attended by the dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon, the counts of Alen&ccedil;on, Eu, and Gui&s;nes, Lewis D' E&s;pagne of the hou&s;e of La Cerda, and many other French noblemen, had taken the field with a for|midable army, reduced Rennes and inve&s;ted Hennebon, which was defended by the counte&s;s in per&s;on. This heroine repul&s;ed the be&s;iegers in all their a&s;&s;aults with amazing valour. Ob&s;erving one day that their whole army had quitted the camp to join in a general &s;torm, &s;he &s;allied out by a po&s;tern, at the head of three hundred hor&s;e, &s;et fire to their tents and baggage, put their &s;ut|lers

Thus intercepted &s;he retired to Auray, where &s;he continued five or &s;ix days; then returning at the head of five hundred hor&s;e, fought her way through one quarter of the French camp, and entered Hennebon in triumph. The enemy, enraged at &s;eeing them&s;elves thus baffled by a female, gave a general a&s;&s;ault, which la&s;ted from morning till three in the afternoon, when they were repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter; then judging it impracticable to take the town without the military engines which they had left at Rennes, Charles de Blois left Lewis D' E&s;pagne with part of the army to wait the arrival of tho&s;e im|plements, while he marched off with the re&s;t to be&s;iege Auray$ Lewis, being furni&s;hed with tho&s;e machines, plied them &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that great breaches were made in the ramparts, a number of the defendants was killed by the &s;tones and mi&s;&s;iles, which they threw without intermi&s;&s;ion; and in a word, the place was reduced to extremity, when the Engli&s;h fleet, after having been detained two whole months by contrary winds, arrived in the harbour.

Mean while Charles, having taken Auray, marched to Vannes, which he &s;oon reduced; and flu$$ed with his &s;uc|ce&s;s re&s;umed the &s;iege of Hennebon, but mi&s;carried as before. The &s;uccours from England being too incon&s;iderable to enable the counte&s;s to take the field, &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to England, in order to ha&s;ten the other reinforcement$ and in her return with Robert D' Artois, encountered the French fleet near Guern&s;ey, commanded by Lewis D' E&s;pagne.

<P>Edward &s;et &s;ail from Sandwich on the fifth day of October; and landing in Bretagne, declared he did not come as an enemy to France, but merely as an ally of the count de Montfort. In four days after his arrival he

inve&s;ted Vannes; but the place being well fortified, and provided with a nume|rous garri&s;on, his a&s;&s;aults were not attended with &s;ucce&s;s. He therefore changed the &s;iege into a kind of blockade. Leaving part of his troops for that &s;er|vice, he marched towards Rennes, and took Male&s;troit and Ploermel in his way$ then advancing to Nantes, in hope of drawing Charles de Blois to an engage|ment, before he was reinforced by the &s;uccours he expected from France, he arranged his army in order of battle before the town, and &s;et fire to the &s;u|burbs. Charles, though extremely provoked at this in&s;ult, would not hazard a battle, becau&s;e he expected every day to be joined by the duke of Normandy, who was at this juncture employed in a&s;&s;embling an army at Angers. The king o$ England, leaving a few troops to maintain the appearance of a &s;iege, returned towards Vannes, which was very hard pre&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h, when the duke of Normandy advanced at the head of forty thou&s;and men to the re|lief of Nantes. Edward immediately recalled his troops to &s;trengthen his own army, which did not amount to twenty thou&s;and men at arms, in|fantry, and archers; and when the duke advanced to Vannes, he found the Engli&s;h monarch &s;trongly intrenched. The French followed his example; and, both armies lay facing one another during the be&s;t part of the winter, in the cour&s;e of which they &s;uffered greatly from the &s;everity of the weather, though the Engli&s;h were obliged to endure an additional hard&s;hip in the want of provi&s;ion; for their communication by &s;ea was greatly interrupted by the activity of Lewis D' E&s;pagne, who hovered on the coa&s;t with a fleet of thirty<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$ Argent$&eacute;.</NOTE> &s;hips and one hundred gallies. Yet Edward, as he daily expected relief from this and other difficulties, by the arrival of a fleet and forces from England, would not abandon the &s;iege, in which his reputation was concerned. While the Engli&s;h and French armies continued in this &s;ituation, two cardinals ar|rived at Male&s;troit as emba&s;&s;adors from Clement VI. who had been ju&s;t elevated to the papacy, and expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire of mediating a peace between the kings of France and England. By this time both &s;ides were pretty well di&s;po&s;ed to an accommodation; for the French general dreaded the arrival of &s;uccours from England, and Edward was very much hampered and di&s;|couraged by their delay. At the in&s;tances of the two cardinals, they con|&s;ented to treat on the &s;ubject of a pacification; and at length agreed tha$ the difference &s;hould be referred to a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, in pre&s;ence of the pope, who &s;hould arbitrate as a private per&s;on and common friend, in a treaty to be commenced at Mid&s;ummer, &s;o as that the articles might be finally adju&s;ted before Chri&s;tmas. In the mean time a truce was concluded for three years, on condition that Vannes &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tred till the expiration of that truce in the hands of the cardinals, who might then di&s;po&s;e of it according to their good plea&s;ure: That the Flemings &s;hould be ab&s;olved from the late pope's $en&s;ures: That all other places &s;hould remain in the hands of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; a$d the pri&s;oners on both &s;ides be relea&s;ed, on $a$ment of ran&s;om: That the allies of the contracting princes &s;hould be co$$$ehended in this<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$me$.</NOTE> agreement; and that both &s;hould exert their utmo&s;t endeavours to prevent ho&s;tilities in Guienne, France, and Brittany.</P>

proceeded directly to London. Six days before his arrival, a parliament had been a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, to deliberate upon the truce and the propo&s;ed treaty, as well as to take cognizance of the &s;tate of the government, and pro|vide for the peace and &s;afety of the nation. The&s;e points were debated by the bi&s;hops, prelates, and barons, in the White-Chamber; while the knights of the &s;hires and the commons took them under con&s;ideration in the Painted|Chamber of the palace: and this is the fir&s;t time that we find a clear di&s;tinc|tion between the two hou&s;es, as it is at pre&s;ent maintained. Having maturely con&s;idered the &s;ubject before them, they concurred in approving the truce as honourable and advantageous, and recommended the treaty of peace as a de|&s;irable object, if it could be procured on equitable terms; otherwi&s;e they pro|mi&s;ed to maintain his quarrel to the utmo&s;t of their power. When the king de&s;ired to know if they had &s;u&s;tained any grievances in his ab&s;ence, they com|plained of &s;ome hard&s;hips, and demanded that a commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be given to ju&s;tices, cho&s;en in parliament, to maintain the peace in the &s;everal counties, and hear and determine cau&s;es of felony, con&s;piracy, champerty, breaches of the peace, unlicen&s;ed amorti&s;ement of lands, fu&s;ion of gold coin by gold|&s;miths, exportation of good and importation of bad money by merchants, provi&s;ions and u&s;urpations of the court of Rome. This commi&s;&s;ion was ac|cordingly i&s;&s;ued$ but it proved &s;o di&s;agreeable to the &s;ubjects in general, that it was vacated in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion.

<P>The commencement of the treaty to be held in pre&s;ence of the pope, was po&s;tponed to Lent, on account of &s;ome infractions of the truce by the parti&s;ans of France in Bretagne, for which Philip delayed giving proper &s;ati&s;|faction: and when it was brought upon the carpet, the conferences proved ineffectual; for the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners in&s;i&s;ted upon their beginning with the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of their ma&s;ter's right to the crown of France; and Philip de|clared that the king of England &s;hould never enjoy one foot of land in France, except that which he might hold in va&s;&s;alage. The pope endeavoured to pre|vail upon both &s;ides to relax a little in their preten&s;ions; but they were equally inflexible, and the negotiation proved abortive. By this time the quarrel was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1344.</NOTE> inflamed with per&s;onal rancour, and all thoughts of terminating the war in an amicable manner, had vani&s;hed. Immediately a$ter the truce, Philip had &s;eized as many of the parti&s;ans of John de Montfort as fell into the hands of his officers, pretending they were not included in the agreement; &s;ome of the&s;e were put to death, and the re&s;t confined in loath&s;ome pri&s;ons. He laid the blame of the&s;e outrages on Charles de Blois, who pretended to ju&s;tify his conduct by alledging that he was not mentioned by name; and therefore no$ included in the treaty.

nephew John, elde&s;t &s;on of Bouchard count of Vendome, engaged for the performance of this article. Neverthele&s;s, he was &s;till detained in pri&s;on; and Philip, in an&s;wer to the pope's expo&s;tulation, affirmed that he was not now a pri&s;oner for any public rea&s;on that concerned the king of England, but for &s;ome particular cau&s;es of another nature. The true rea&s;on of this treatment was the ambition of Philip, who refu&s;ed to relea&s;e him, unle&s;s he would give up Bre&s;t and Hennebon, and renounce all claim to the dutchy of Bretagne: but nothing fixed &s;uch an indelible &s;tain on the character of the French king, as his behaviour to Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on, who had &s;erved him and Charles de Blois with uncommon fidelity. He had been taken pri&s;oner in the cour&s;e of the war, and exchanged by Edward for the lord Stafford, at the &s;ollicitation of his brother Amaury, who happened to be in the &s;ervice of the counte&s;s of Brittany. The preference given on this occa&s;ion by the king of England to Oliver over John de Leon, who was al&s;o his pri&s;oner, and the circum&s;tance of his brother's being attached to John de Mont$ort, excited the jealou&s;y of<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$$$.

<P>This act of tyranny was &s;o highly re&s;ented in Bretagne, that the baron de Loheac abandoned the French intere&s;t; and the people of Vannes ri&s;ing in arms, declared for John de Montfort, after having expelled the pope's garri|&s;on. The&s;e circum&s;tances &s;erved to confirm the &s;u&s;picion of Philip, who forthwith i&s;&s;ued orders for apprehending Geffrey de Male&s;troit, with his &s;on John, and eight other noblemen of Bretagne; and though they had all di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of Charles de Blois, they were executed in the &s;ame infamous manner which had been practi&s;ed upon Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on. Edward of England had proclaimed in all parts of Europe a Round Table to be held at Wind&s;or, on the nineteenth day of January; and granted &s;afe-con|ducts to knights of all countries, without di&s;tinction, who &s;hould honour his fe&s;tival with their pre&s;ence. Philip of France, either in&s;pired by emula|tion, or apprehen&s;ive that the brave&s;t knights in Europe, allured by this invi|tation, would engage in the &s;ervice of England, endeavoured to divert them from cro&s;&s;ing the &s;e$ on this occa&s;ion, by proclaiming &s;uch another Round Table, on the very &s;ame day at Paris, on pretence of doing honour to the nupti$$s of his &s;econd &s;on Philip with Blanche, the po&s;thumous daughter of Charles the Fair, his predec$&s;&s;or. This in&s;titution an&s;wered two purpo&s;es: as it not only rivalled the &s;plendour of Edward, but al&s;o decoyed a number of Breton lords to his court, where they were &s;hamefully detaine$ as pri&s;oners, in viola$ion of the truce, as well as of the &s;afe-conduct, which, in &s;uch ca&s;es, was extended to all per&s;on$ without di&s;tinction. Notwith&s;tanding the efforts of t$e French king to dimini&s;h the lu&s;tre of Edward's $e&s;tival, it was cele|brated with &s;urpri&s;ing m$$nificence, a$id&s;t a va&s;t concour&s;e of knights from all parts of Chri&s;tendom. The order o$ king Arthur's knig$ts of the Round Table was revived, under the name of the Garter, in a hall built at Wind&s;or for the purpo&s;e: and after they h$d fea&s;ted for &s;ome days, the tournaments began in pre&s;ence of the queen and all the ladies of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction; &s;o

<P>When the parliament met in June, Edward complained to them of Philip's cru$lty, inju&s;tice, and violation of the truce; for, be&s;ides the infrac|tions we have already mentioned, he had &s;ent a numerous body of troops into Guienne, where they reduced ca&s;tles and towns, and ravaged the country. He likewi&s;e attempted to debauch Edward's allies from his intere&s;t, even during the negotiation before his holine&s;s; and every part of his conduct de|noted a fixed re&s;olution to pro&s;ecute the war. The ear$s of Derby and Arun|del had been &s;ent with &s;ome troops into Guienne, to de$end that country from the incur&s;ions of the French; but as further preparations &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, the parliament exhorted him to pur&s;ue vigorous mea&s;ures, either to conclude a final treaty of peace, or terminate the war by a deci&s;ive battle. This advice was &s;upported with the grant of &s;ub&s;idies to equip an armament again&s;t France, and defend the border from the irruption of the Scots, who pro|fe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves entirely devoted to the intere&s;t of Philip. But this was not the only fund from which Edward derived &s;upplies for the &s;ervice of the year. He &s;ummoned all freeholders po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing forty pounds a year, who were not already knighted, to come and receive that honour; and a con&s;id$rable &s;um aro&s;e $rom the fees of that ceremony. He i&s;&s;ued orders to his military te|nants in Ireland, to furni&s;h two hundred men at arms, and five hundred light hor&s;e, to rendezvous at Port&s;mouth on the fifteenth day of September, in order to be embarked upon a foreign expedition. A number of Genoe&s;e gallies were engaged in the &s;$rvice. The ca&s;tles in Brittany belonging to the counte&s;s of Montfort, were ordered to be well fortified and provided with &s;trong garri&s;ons; and Sir Thomas Dagworth was &s;ent over with a &s;mall re|inforcement to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The troops &s;ent to Ga&s;cony, under the com|mand of the earls of Derby, Arundel, Oxford, and Pembroke, with the lord Stafford and Manny, con&s;i&s;ted of five hundred knights, two thou&s;and archers, and a large body of infantry: and the young earl of Sali&s;bury, with &s;ix h$ndred men at arms and two thou&s;and archers, was &s;ent to &s;erve under<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi$$ar$$ Knyghton.</NOTE> Ba|liol, appointed to defend the northern Marches.</P>

<P>The earl of Derby landing at Bayonne on the &s;ixth day of June, advanced immediately towards Bergerac on the Dodogne, where the French were po&s;ted under the command of Barnard count de l'I&s;le Jourdain, whom he found &s;trongly intrenched in the &s;uburbs; from whence he could not have been di&s;lodged without great difficulty. But the French, confiding in their numbers, mad$ a &s;ally; and, being routed, the Engli&s;h entered with them pell mell into their intrenchments, from which they retired to the city. Here the count &s;tood one a&s;&s;ault, in which the Engli&s;h made a lodgment on the breach; a$d then, retreating in the night to La Reole, di&s;po&s;ed of his troops in &s;everal garri&s;ons, which were all reduced by the victors; after which &s;ucce&s;s the earl of Derby returned to Bourdeaux. The count de l'I&s;le was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of his retreat, than he &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled a body of twelve tho$&s;and men; and inve&s;ting Auberoc$e, def$nded by an Engli&s;h garri&s;on, battered it with engines &s;o $u$iou&s;ly, that in &s;ix days the $ortifications were al|mo&s;t ruined. D$rby, under&s;tanding the di&s;tre&s;s of his countrymen, marched out of Bourdeaux by night, with a &s;mall body of lances and bowmen, after

having &s;ent orders to the earl of Pembroke, who lay at Bergerac, to meet him with a reinforcement at Libourne, which he reached unperceived before morning: here having halted all day in expectation of being joined by Pem|broke, he proceeded on his march at night; and, early in the morning, ar|rived in a wood at the di&s;tance of two leagues from Auberoche. In this &s;ituation he continued the be&s;t part of the day, till de&s;pairing of the reinforce|ment, he, by the advice of the gallant Sir Walter de Manny, re&s;olved to beat up the French quarters, while the enemy &s;hould be at &s;upper. With this view they marched under covert of the wood, till they were clo&s;e to one quarter of their camp; then fell upon them &s;o unexpectedly, that the counts de l'I&s;le, Per$gort, and Valentinois, were taken in their tents before they had time to make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; and their &s;oldiers charged with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that they could make very little oppo&s;ition: but while this quarter was filled with rout and confu&s;ion, the other half of the French army, commanded by the count of Comminges, took to their arms; and, being drawn up in order of battle, advanced again&s;t the Engli&s;h. The earl of Derby, though greatly inferior to them in point of number, re&s;olved to make one vigorous effort to complete the work he had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully begun; and, re-a&s;&s;embling his &s;cattered forces, attacked the enemy with incredible impe|tuo&s;ity. He met with a very warm reception, and, an ob&s;tinate engagement en&s;uing, both &s;ides fought a long time with dubious &s;ucce&s;s, until the garri&s;on of Auberoche hearing the trumpets &s;ounding th$ charge on both &s;ides, and de&s;crying from a tower &s;ome Engli&s;h banners, though it was now the twilight, forthwith made a &s;ally, and, falling on the rear of the French, d$cided the fate of the battle. The enemy was immediately involved in darkne&s;s and di&s;order, and utterly defeated with con&s;iderable &s;laughter; their lo&s;s in both a$tions amounting to &s;even thou&s;and &s;lain, and twelve hundred taken pri|&s;oners; among whom were nine counts and vi&s;counts, and two hundred knights and gentlemen of di&s;tinction. The earl of Pembroke arrived next morning with his reinforcement, and was not a little chagrined to find &s;uch a notable victory obtained without his participation. The $orce of the enemy in tho&s;e parts being now intirely broken, the two earls retired to Bourdeaux; from whence Derby &s;ailed for England to &s;ollicit &s;uccours, after having put<NOTE PLACE="marg">$roi$$art. $word$</NOTE> his troops in winter-quarters.</P>

<P>With the&s;e he returned in June to Guienne, and immediately took the field, in order to recover the other places which had been conquered or<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He accordingly red$ced every town and ca&s;tle which he inve&s;ted, except Blaye, which was &s;o gallantly defended by William Rochechouart and Guichard d'Angle, afterwards knight of the garter, that the earl of Derby, after having made &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful a&s;&s;aults, thought proper to put an end to the campaign, and return to Bourdeaux, as the &s;ea&s;on was already far advanced. About this period John de Montfort, after a &s;evere impri&s;onment of near four years in the Louvre, found means to e&s;cape in the di&s;gui&s;e of a beggar; and, coming over to England, where his wi$e re&s;ided, &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Edward &s;o effectually, that all the conferences being at an end, and every pro&s;pect of a pacification intirely vani&s;hed, the king re&s;olved to declare war again&s;t France, without further he&s;itation. He appointed the earl of Northampton his lieutenant, in that

kingdom and in Brittany, empowering him to defy Philip de Valois as a per|jured truce-breaker; an u&s;urper of the crown of France; and a mortal enemy to king Edward, his lawful &s;overeign. John de Montfort, having done homage at Lambeth for Brittany, to Edward, as king of France, and lord paramount of that dutchy, went thither in the beginning of June, with the earls of Northampton, Oxford, &s;ome other noblemen, and a con&s;iderable body of forces, by which he was enabled to reduce Dinan, and encouraged to inve&s;t Quimper-Corentin, which had lately been taken by Charles de Blois, who ma&s;&s;acred fourteen hundred of the inhabitants: but his competitor ad|vancing with a numerous army to the relief of the place, he was obliged to abandon the enterprize, and retired to Hennebon, where he died of a fever. Neverthele&s;s, the earl of Northampton defeated Charles, in a pitched battle near Morlaix, and took Roche-derien by a&s;&s;ault; but, winter approaching, he left the affairs of Bretagne to the care of Sir Thomas Dagworth, and re|turned to England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>Edward, when he empowered the earl of Northampton to bid Philip defiance in his name, notified this tran&s;action to the pope, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to for the ju&s;tification of his conduct. This &s;olemn declaration of a rupture between the two kingdoms, brought over a number of foreign &s;ol|diers of fortune. They longed to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves under the eye of Ed|ward, who, in valour, gallantry, and genero&s;ity, was univer&s;all$ allowed to exceed all the princes of his time: and among the&s;e was Godfrey d$ Harcourt, lord of St. Sauveur le Vicomte in Normandy, who had been expelled the French court in con&s;equence of a quarrel with Robert Bertrand, baron of Briquebec, marechal of France. They had drawn their &s;words in the king's pre&s;ence, and Godfrey being cited before the parliament of Paris, refu&s;ed to appear. After having been &s;ummoned four times, Philip bani&s;hed him the realm, and confi&s;cated his e&s;tate. Not contented with having puni&s;hed his offence in this manner, he wreaked his vengeance upon his friends and relations: William Bacon, Richard de Percy, and the lord of Roche-Te&s;&s;on, repairing to the tournament at Paris, were arre&s;ted and accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, and underwent the ignominious death which had been inflicted upon Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on, though, like him, they had always faithfully adhered to the intere&s;t of Charles de Blois. Godfrey would have been treated in the &s;ame manner, had not he retired to the court of John duke of Brabant, who being his kin&s;|man, tried in vain to make his peace with Philip: there he continued, boiling with re&s;entment again&s;t his per&s;ecutor, till the defiance of Edward was pub|li&s;hed, and then he ha&s;ted to the court of England, where he did homage to the king for his lands in France, and filled the place of his countryman<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghto$.

<P>Before Edward would engage in an expedition again&s;t France, he &s;ummoned his former allies to perform their engagements, and in particular the duke of Brabant, with whom he had agreed upon a match between Jane, the duke's elde&s;t daughter and heire&s;s, and his own &s;on Edward, who had been declared prince of Wales during the la&s;t parliament. The pope refu&s;ed to grant a di&s;pen&s;ation, as the parties were in the third degree of con&s;anguinity; and the duke was by this time cooled in his attachment to Edward, by the indefatigable intrigues of the French court, which had found means to in|fluence

his cond$ct. A treaty was likewi&s;e &s;et on foot with Lewis of Bavaria, the emperor, and his &s;on Lewis marquis of Brandenburg; but, in all proba|bility, $dward had not money &s;ufficient to gratify the rapacious di&s;po&s;ition of German auxi$$aries; &s;o that the negotiation did not take effect. He placed more dependence upon Jacob van Ardevelt, the demagogue of Ghent, who $ndertook to prevail upon the Flemings to depo&s;e their own count in favour of Edward prince of Wales, who &s;hould erect Flanders into a dutchy. On the &s;trength of his a&s;&s;urances, the king, leaving his &s;on Lionel guardian of the king$om, &s;ailed on the third day of July $rom the port of Sandwich, with the pri$ce of Wales, a &s;plendid retinue, and a &s;trong body of forces on b$ard of a n$merous fleet; and, landing at Sluys, was vi&s;ited by the deputies of the chief towns in Flanders, whom he regaled with a magnificent entertain|ment. On this occa&s;ion Ardevelt propo&s;ed that they &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon their co$nt's renouncing his alliance with Philip de Valois; or, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, &s;hi$t their a$legiance to the prince of Wales, who would erect their country into a dukedom, and who&s;e father would protect them in &s;uch a manner, that they would $$ouri&s;h in commerce above all other nations of Europe. The deputies &s;tartled at this propo&s;al, de&s;ired time to con&s;ult their con&s;tituents, promi&s;i$g to return in one month with a definitive an&s;wer; and Edward, perceiving their aver&s;ion and re&s;entment to the propounder, prevailed upon Ard$velt to accept a guard of five hundred Wel&s;hmen, under the command of Sir John d$ Ma$travers. The deputies of Ghent no &s;ooner returned to that city, than they in$$$med the populace with an exaggerated report of this tran&s;|a$t$on, in$$nuating that Ardevelt wanted to depo&s;e and de&s;troy the antient race of t$eir &s;overeigns, to which they were &s;trongly attached. Gerard Denis, dean of the weavers, and &s;ome other burghers, who envied the wealth and popularity of that citizen, and were well affected to the count's party, dif|f$$ed di&s;advantageous rumours to the prejudice of Ardevelt; alledging that he had embezzled the revenues of his country, and remitted va&s;t &s;ums of money to England, where he intended to fix his habitation. The&s;e accu&s;a|t$$$s gained credit with the multitude, which now raged with indignation $gain&s;t the man whom they had formerly adored; and when Ardevelt re|t$r$ed f$om Bruges, he &s;oon felt the effects of their fury: his hou&s;e was im|media$$ly b$&s;et by the populace, who broke into it like a torrent, and &s;acri|$iced him, with &s;ome of his relations, to their rage; after having &s;laughtered &s;eventy of his Wel&s;h guard. Edward was equally incen&s;ed and concerned at this outrage, which totally overthrew the plan he had projected; but the g$eat towns of Flanders &s;ending deputies to clear them&s;elves from all imputa|tion o$ being acce&s;&s;ary to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and the city of Ghent laying the blame upon the populace, his re&s;entment gave way to his intere&s;t, and he re|newed his alliance with them before he departed. He intended to make ano|ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> expedition into Brittany, before his return to his own dominions; but being detained by contrary winds and tempe&s;tuous weather, he was obliged to po&s;tpone that enterprize, and &s;ail directly for England, where he landed on the twenty-&s;ixth day of July. The advantage which might have accrued from this alliance, was lo&s;t by the untimely fate of William II. count of Hainault, Holland, Zealand, and Frie&s;land, who was killed in an action again&s;t the Fri&s;ians; the death of William marquis of Juliers and earl of

Cambridge; and the defection of John of Hainault, who now declared in favour of Philip. The&s;e di&s;a&s;ters di&s;couraged the re&s;t of the allies in &s;uch a manner, as di&s;pelled all thoughts of invading France by the way of Flanders. But Edward per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to pro&s;ecute the war, notwith&s;tand|ing the remon&s;trances of the pope, who earne&s;tly recommended another treaty; and the winter was employed in making preparations for the expe|dition. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubbo Em|bius.

<P>He appointed the rendezvous of his fleet and forces at Port&s;mouth, on Midlent Sunday: but his navy being di&s;per&s;ed in a &s;torm, it was deferred till the middle of May; and then he was prevented by contrary winds from executing his fir&s;t de&s;ign of landing in Guienne, which was about this time in|vaded by John duke of Normandy, at the head of a prodigious army.

The king reli&s;hed his advice, and &s;ailing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ave&s;bury.</NOTE> from St. Helen's on the tenth day of July, landed in two days at La Hogue St. Vaa&s;t in Normandy. The greate&s;t part of his fleet he &s;ent back immediately; and ordered the earl of Huntingdon, who commanded the re&s;t, to cruize along the coa&s;t, and de&s;troy the &s;hips which the king of France had equipped in different ports for an inva&s;ion of England. This &s;ervice he performed with great &s;ucce&s;s; and having ravaged the country, and burned the towns along &s;hore, returned to La Hogue, in order to attend the motions of the army. Edward, having refre&s;hed his troops, which had been long pent up in ve&s;&s;els, divided his army into three bodies, and began his march towards Valognes, from whence he proceeded to Carentan, which opened its gates at his approach. In the route he him&s;elf commanded the main body, while the earl of Warwick and Godfrey de Harcourt, at the head of the other two divi&s;ions, ravaged the country to a great extent upon the right and left, and found great plenty of provi&s;ions, with a very valuable booty. In this manner he advanced to St. Lo, which was taken after a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance; and, continuing his march, arrived on the twenty-&s;ixth day of the month in the neighbourhood of Caen, the capital of Lower Normandy. This place was garri&s;oned by a body of troops, under the command of the count d'Eu con&s;table of France, and the count de Tancar|ville chamberlain of Normandy, with the bi&s;hop of Bayeux: be&s;ides the&s;e a great number of gentlemen in the adjacent country had thrown them&s;elves into it, at the approach of the Engli&s;h. Over-rating their own &s;trength and valour, they next day made a &s;ally with a great number of the inhabitants, who were &s;o warmly received by the Engli&s;h archers, that they &s;oon betook them&s;elves to flight with great precipitation. The con&s;table had lined the river Orne with regular troops, in order to defend the bridge; but &s;uch was the confu&s;ion of the town&s;men, that they bore down every thing in their retreat; and the Eng|li&s;h pur&s;uing with great impetuo&s;ity, they found all re&s;i&s;tance impracticable. The bridge and barriers were forced, the con&s;table and chamberlain, with about two hundred and fifty knights and gentlemen taken pri&s;oners; and the be&s;t part of their forces put to the &s;word.

<P>The French king had, upon the fir&s;t news of Edward's de&s;cent in Normandy, di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to John the blind king of Bohemia, his &s;on Charles king of the Romans, the king o$ Majorca, the duke of Lorraine, the count of Flanders, and his other allies, de&s;iring them to come and join him with all expedition. He appointed a general rendezvous at Paris of all the military power of France, except &s;uch as was employed in the &s;iege of Aguil|lon, and in the mean time marched with a body of forces to Rouen, where he broke down the bridge over the Seine, to prevent the Engli&s;h from cro&s;&s;ing that river. Edward, after the reduction of Caen, had received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Bayeux and &s;everal other towns, and re&s;olving to profit by the con&s;terna|tion that prevailed over the whole country, continued his march towards Rouen, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances and intreaties of the two cardinal legates, who met him at Li&s;ieux with propo&s;als for a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities. With|out paying the lea&s;t regard to his importunities, he proceeded to the banks of the Seine, where he &s;aw Philip po&s;ted on the other &s;ide with a numerous army, in &s;uch a manner as rendered the pa&s;&s;age impracticable. In order to provoke him to an engagement, he ravaged the country under his eye, took &s;everal towns, and reduced a great number of villages to a&s;hes and de&s;olation. In this employment he continued his progre&s;s, till he arrived at Poi&s;&s;y, where he ordered the bridge which had been broken down to be repaired, and pa&s;&s;ing the river in the face of the militia, which were routed by the earl of Northamp|ton, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Pontoi&s;e, while Philip returned to Paris, the in|habitants of which were terribly alarmed by the &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h, who &s;ent detached parties to ravage the neighbourhood of that capital. Their drooping &s;pirits, however, were &s;oon animated by the appearance of the prodi|gious army which rendezvouzed at St. Denis. Philip, elated at the pro&s;pect, &s;ent a letter to the king of England, containing a challenge to give him battle on the plain of Vaugirard, or between Franconville and Pontoi&s;e; and Ed|ward replied, that Philip &s;hould find him always ready for an engagement, but he would never allow his enemy to pre&s;cribe the day and place of battle. Mean while he marched under the walls of Beauvais, and advanced to Poix, after having routed the militia of Amiens, and a party of hor&s;e belonging to the king of Bohemia. When he arrived at Ayraines, he began to be in want of provi&s;ion, and found him&s;elf enclo&s;ed between the Somme, the &s;ea, and the French army, which amounted to one hundred thou&s;and men. Picquigny and Pont de Remy were too well fortified to be taken by a&s;&s;ault; all the other bridges over the river were broken down, &s;ave tho&s;e at Abbeville, and all the pa&s;&s;ages &s;o well guarded, that he could not attempt them with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. At Oye&s;emont he found a French pri&s;oner, who, in con&s;ideration of his liberty, and the reward of one hundred nobles, conducted him to the ford of Blanchetaque, which he found guarded by Godemar du Fray, at the head of ten thou&s;and regular troops, reinforced by the militia of the country. Edward, &s;eeing the nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing at all events, was the fir&s;t man who entered the river, bidding his &s;oldiers follow him; and they obeying this order with great

alacrity, a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute en&s;ued; for the French cavalry ru&s;hing from the bank, engaged them in the mid&s;t of the river: but they were &s;o terribly galled by the arrows of the Engli&s;h archers, that they did not long &s;tand the &s;hock of the men at arms, who &s;oon forced their pa&s;&s;age to the other &s;ide; and then the enemy fled in great di&s;order to Abbeville, where Philip arrived that &s;ame evening, at the head of an immen&s;e army.</P>

<P>The king of England having re&s;olved to be&s;iege Calais, followed that route by &s;low marches, and halted the fir&s;t night at the ca&s;tle of Noyelle, from whence he detached parties to burn Crotoye and other towns in the neigh|bourhood. Next day he arrived at Crecy, where he encamped on an eminence, with a wood in his rear, and placed the baggage-waggons on the flanks, to &s;e|cure them from the attack of the enemy. While he thus pur&s;ued his purpo&s;e with great intrepidity and deliberation, Philip imagining that he fled before his arms, re&s;olved to overtake and cha&s;ti&s;e the fugitive, who had made &s;uch ha|voc in his kingdom. He accordingly marched from Abbeville towards the village of Crecy; and Edward being informed of his approach, drew up his army, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty thou&s;and men, in order of battle. The fir&s;t line was commanded by the prince of Wales, ju&s;t turned of fifteen, accompanied by the earls of Warwick and Oxford, Godfrey de Harcourt, the lords Stafford, Holland, Chandois, Clifford, with the flower of the Engli&s;h nobility, eight hundr$d men at arms, four thou&s;and archers, and &s;ix thou&s;and Wel&s;h infantry. The &s;econd line was conducted by the earls of Arundel and Northampton, the lords Willoughby, Roos, Ba&s;&s;et of Sipcote and Multon, Sir Lewis Tuf|ton, and a great number of gentlemen, eight thou&s;and men at arms, four thou&s;and halbardiers, and about half that number of archers. Tho&s;e two lines were formed on the declivity of the hill in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;upport one another; and the &s;econd outflanked the fir&s;t, &s;o as to prevent its being &s;ur|rounded by the enemy on the left, where it was &s;ecured by a &s;emi-circular ditch dug in the night for this purpo&s;e, terminating in the park of Crecy, and the &s;mall brook of Maye which waters that village. The king him&s;elf commanded the third line, po&s;ted on the brow of the eminence behind the other two, com|po&s;ed of &s;even hundred men at arms, five thou&s;and three hundred billmen, and &s;ix thou&s;and archers: he was attended by the lords Mowbray, Mortimer, Dagworth, Sir Hugh Ha&s;tings, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. He and the prince of Wales had that morning received the &s;acrament with great de|votion; and his behaviour denoted the calm intrepidity of invincible courage and re&s;ignation. Even the deportment of the prince of Wales, though a boy, was, in all re&s;pects, manly, heroic, and worthy of the great example he pro|po$ed to imitate. The army being thus arranged, the king rode from rank to rank, with a chearful countenance, encouraging the &s;oldiers to exert them&s;elves for the honour of their country, the defence of their &s;overeign, and the pre&s;er|vation of their own lives; and his words, his amiable figure, and his compla|cency, animated them even to a degree of rapturous expectation. That they might have every motive to in&s;pire them with extraordinary courage, he knighted fifty young gentlemen; and among the re&s;t Sir John Beauchamp, whom he appointed to bear the royal &s;tandard in the battle. The&s;e previous di&s;po&s;itions being made, he ordered his men at arms to di$mount, that the hor&s;es might not be $atigued before the battle began, and his &s;oldiers to be re|fre&s;hed
<PB N="54" REF="560">
with a plentiful meal; after which they lay down in their ranks upon the gra&s;s to take their repo&s;e, that they might be fre&s;h and vigorous at the approach of the enemy. The French king had begun his march at &s;un-ri&s;e from Abbe|ville, with an army of one hundred thou&s;and men; and having advanced two leagues, halted to draw up his cavalry in order of battle, while the infantry con|tinued their march. Being now at the di&s;tance of five miles from the Engli&s;h, he detached four knights to view the po&s;ture of the enemy, which they were permitted to &s;urvey at lei&s;ure without mole&s;tation. They were a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ilence, order, and compo&s;ure of the Engli&s;h army; and one of them, who was an experienced &s;oldier belonging to the king of Bohemia, a&s;&s;ured Phi|lip there was no danger of Edward's running away. He told him, there was neither fear nor precipitation in the countenance of the Engli&s;h troops, but great &s;erenity and re&s;olution; he &s;aid their di&s;po&s;ition was excellent, and their bodies in full vigour; and exhorted the king of France to advance no far|ther that night, but allow his infantry to refre&s;h them&s;elves from the fatigue of a tedious march, otherwi&s;e he would not an&s;wer for the con&s;equence, as they were at pre&s;ent &s;pent with hard duty, and moving in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. Philip perceived the &s;anity of this advice, and &s;ent immediate orders to the van to halt, until they &s;hould receive further in&s;tructions. But his commands were very imperfectly obeyed; for his army comprehending a great number of aux|iliaries conducted by independent princes, among whom there was no &s;ubordi|nation, they di&s;puted the po&s;t of honour with each other, and vied in pre&s;&s;ing forward to attack the enemy: when the front ranks halted, tho&s;e who &s;uc|ceeded continuing to move with great impetuo&s;ity, that enormous body was pu&s;hed on towards Crecy in &s;uch confu&s;ion, as di&s;abled them from acting with the lea&s;t regularity. Even Philip him&s;elf, with the princes of the blood, were carried away by the croud; and he found it impo&s;&s;ible to retard their motion, until they came within &s;ight of the Engli&s;h. Then he made &s;hift to arrange them in three di&s;tinct bodies, the fir&s;t of which, commanded by John de Luxemburg the blind king of Bohemia, con&s;i&s;ted of three thou&s;and men at arms, nine and twenty thou&s;and infantry, and fifteen thou&s;and Genoe&s;e $ro&s;s-bows, planted oppo&s;ite to the Engli&s;h archers. The &s;econd divi&s;ion, con|ducted by Charles count of Alen&ccedil;on, was compo&s;ed of four thou&s;and men at arms, and twenty thou&s;and infantry, advanced in a line with the fir&s;t battalia. Philip in per&s;on commanded the third body as a re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve thou&s;and men at arms, and fifty thou&s;and infantry. About three in the after|noon, the French king began the battle, by ordering the Genoe&s;$ to charge; but they were &s;o fatigued with their march, that they cried out for a little re&s;t before they &s;hould engage. The count of Alen&ccedil;on, being informed of their pe|tition, rode up and reviled them as cowards, commanding them to begin the on|&s;et without delay. They advanced with great reluctance, which was increa&s;ed by an heavy &s;hower which fell that in&s;tant, and rendered their bow&s;trings u&s;ele&s;s; &s;o that the di&s;charge they made could produce very little effect. On the other hand, the Engli&s;h arch$rs, who had kept their bows in ca$es, and were favoured by a &s;udden glea$ of &s;un&s;hine that f$a&s;hed in the faces of the enemy, let fly their arr$ws &s;o thick and with &s;uch good aim, that terrible havock was made among the Genoe&s;e, who finding them&s;elves expo&s;ed to certain death, without being able to annoy their enemy, began to fly with di&s;order and precipitation,
<PB N="55" REF="570">
and were trodden down by the men at arms, under the command of the count of Alen&ccedil;on. That nobleman making a wheel in order to avoid the bowmen, charged with great fury the body conducted by the prince of Wales, who &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock without flinching, and gave the count &s;uch a warm reception, that the greate&s;t part of his men at arms was left dead upon the &s;pot. While he main|tained this conflict, the column of archers forty deep, po&s;ted on the right, which had already defeated the Genoe&s;e, was broke, by an impetuous on&s;et of three &s;quadrons of French and German knights, and a great body of men at arms; &s;o that the prince was attacked both in front and flank at the &s;ame time. In this emergency, the earl of Warwick di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to the king, de&s;iring him to advance to the prince's &s;uccour. Edward, whom he found in a windmill viewing the engagement, a&s;ked with great deliberation, if his &s;on was dead, wounded, or unhor&s;ed; and being an&s;wered in the negative, <Q>&startq;Well then, &s;aid he, go back and tell Warwick, that I &s;hall not intermeddle in the fray, but let my boy win his &s;purs by his own valour.&endq;</Q> He perceived the confu&s;ion of the French, and their &s;tandards dropping very fa&s;t in that place where the prince was &s;tationed, &s;o that he concluded the enemy had mi&s;carried in their a&s;&s;ault; and as he had lately be&s;towed the honour of knighthood upon his &s;on, he was loth to deprive him of any &s;hare of the glory. His conjec|ture was ju&s;t: before the knight returned with his an&s;wer, the archers had clo&s;ed, and the earls of Arundel and Northampton advanced with a fre&s;h body, by which the a&s;&s;ailants were &s;urrounded and cut in pieces. The&s;e victorious bands, joining under prince Edward, who fought with amazing prowe&s;s, advanced to attack in their turn the main body of the enemy commanded by Philip, who had been prevented, by the di&s;orderly flight of his fir&s;t line, from coming up to &s;u&s;tain the troops which had broke through the Engli&s;h archers. Here the battle was renewed with great ob&s;tinacy; Philip in per&s;on, the king of Bohe|mia, and his &s;on Charles, with a number of auxiliary princes, animating their &s;oldiers to deeds of glory, not only by words, but by the example of their own per&s;onal prowe&s;s. Nothing, however, could re&s;i&s;t the impetuo&s;ity and valour of the prince of Wales and his attendants. Flu&s;hed with the &s;ucce&s;s he had already obtained, and in&s;pired by the me&s;&s;age he had received from his father$ under who&s;e eye he acted in this fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of his manhood, he redoubled his efforts and bore down all oppo&s;ition. The blind king of Bohemia, who&s;e ambition had for many years embroiled the be&s;t part of Europe, enquiring about the fate of the day, was told that the French were in terrible di&s;order; a great number of noblemen &s;lain; that his &s;on Charles had been obliged to retire dangerou&s;ly wounded; that the Engli&s;h had made a dreadful carnage; and that the prince of Wales bore down every thing before him with irre&s;i&s;tible valour. John having received this information, commanded his knights to lead him into the hotte&s;t part of the battle again&s;t the young warrior. Accordingly four of his attendants placing him in the middle, and interlacing the bridles of their hor&s;es, they ru&s;hed together into the thicke&s;t of the enemy, and the blind king interchanged a few &s;trokes with Edward; but they were &s;oon parted, and the Bohemian, with his followers, fell in the confu&s;ion of the battle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He wore three o$$rich feathers for his cre&s;t; and as he acted in the capacity of a volunteer, he a&s;&s;umed the motto I$h Dien, which, in the Ger|man language, &s;ignifies I Serve. This device young Edward appropriated to him&s;elf; and it has been adopted by all &s;ucceeding princes of Wales.</NOTE>. By this

time Philip him&s;elf, af$er two hor&s;es had been killed under him, was grievou&s;ly wounded in the neck and thigh; and being carried out of the battl$ by John of H$inault, the &s;tandard o$ France was beaten down. Then all r$&s;i&s;tance was $aid a&s;ide; univer&s;al rout and undi&s;tingui&s;hed carnage en&s;ued: though a great number of the French would have e$caped by favour of the approaching night, had not the king of England ordered large fires to be made upon the neighbouring hills, by the light of which the victors prevented them from ral|lying or uniting, and completed the &s;laughter. Edward, &s;eeing the victory ac|compli&s;hed, de&s;cended from the hill, and running up to the prince of Wales, embraced hi$ renderly in the &s;ight of the whole army, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;My valiant &s;on, God grant you may per&s;evere in the cour&s;e you have &s;o gloriou&s;ly begun. You have acquitted your&s;el$ nobly; and well are you worth the kingdom that will be your inheritance.&endq;</Q> The prince made no other reply than that of a profound obei&s;ance; and indeed his mode&s;ty and moderation were altogether &s;urprizing and unexampled. In this $amous battle, which was fought on the twenty-&s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, John king of Bohemia, James king of Majorca, Ralp$ duke of Lorraine, the counts of Alen&ccedil;on, Flanders, Blois, Vaude|mont, Harcourt, Auxerre, Aumale, St. Pol, and Sancerre, four and twenty bannerets, twelve hundred knights, fifteen hundred gentlemen, $our thou&s;and men at arms, and thirty thou&s;and infantry, are &s;aid to have fallen, while the lo$$ of Edward did not exceed three knights, and an incon&s;iderable number of &s;oldiers. Philip, attend$d by five knights and about &s;ixty followers, was car|ried to the ca&s;tle of La Broye, about a league from Crecy, where, having taken &s;ome refre&s;hment, he &s;et out at midnight for Amiens, where he arrived early next morning. The victorious Edward having &s;ounded a retreat, and ordered his men to be upon their guard all night, le&s;t the French &s;hould rally, detached a party of lances and archers at day-light, to pur&s;ue the fugitives, and they meeting in a fog with the militia of Rouen and Beauvais, on their march to join Philip's army, rout$d them at the fir&s;t on&s;et. The archbi&s;hop of Rouen and the grand prior of France, advancing with a fre&s;h reinforcement, were defeated and &s;lain, with two thou&s;and of their followers. The Engli&s;h gather|ing &s;ome French &s;tandards that lay &s;cattered on the field of battle, planted them on a neighbouring hill, as a decoy to the enemy who were di&s;per&s;ed about the villages, and the &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded; for they flocked in numbers to their colours, and were hewn in p$eces without mercy; and indeed the only circum|&s;tance which tarni&s;hed the glory of this victory, was the order which Edward i&s;&s;ued before the engagement, to give no quarter. The &s;ame injunction is &s;aid to have been laid upon the French army by their monarch: but this was an in|&s;tance of barbarity, in which his example ought not to have been followed. Though he refu&s;ed mercy to the living, he was extremely courteous to the dead: he &s;ent the body of John king o$ Bohemia to his family; he ordered the field to be con&s;ecrated, attended the funerals of the noblemen who had lo&s;t their lives in the battle, and ordered the common &s;oldiers to be interred with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ba$$es.

Such act$ of humility and moderation, doubtle&s;s &s;erve to dig|nify the character of a $onarch, and perhaps to quiet any &s;cruples of con&s;cience that might intervene: but a prince ought to be very well &s;atisfied with the ju$tne$s of his quarrel, before $e begins to &s;hed &s;$ch &s;eas of blood, and com|mences the mini&s;ter of horro$, death, ruin, and de$olation.

<P>The king of England having &s;tayed three days on the field of battle, continued his march for Calais, which he inve&s;ted on the third day of Septem|ber; and there we &s;hall leave him to take a retro&s;pective view of the operations in Guienne. At the latter end of the preceding year, Philip had &s;ent his &s;on, duke of Normandy, with a numerous army to recover the places which Henry earl of Lanca&s;ter had reduced in that province; and he accordingly arrived at Tholou&s;e about the end of December. From thence he marched, in the be|ginning of the year, to Miremont, which he reduced: Villefranche met with the &s;ame fate; and then he undertook the &s;iege of Engoule&s;me, the garri&s;on of which was commanded by John de Norwich, who made a gallant defence, un|til his provi&s;ions beginning to fail, he propo&s;ed a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities for Can|dlemas-day, that he might be at lei&s;ure to pay his devotions to the Ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin; John agreeing to the propo&s;al, he packed up his baggage in waggons over night, and marched off with his garri&s;on to Aiguillon, the mo&s;t impor|tant place in all that country. It was well provided with &s;tores and a good garri&s;on, under the command of the earl of Pembroke, Sir Walter de Manny, and John de Mowbray, who repaired the fortifications, and took every other mea&s;ure for making a vigorous defence, in ca&s;e the &s;iege &s;hould be undertaken by the duke of Normandy. The&s;e precautions proved very nece&s;&s;ary; for, a$ter that prince had taken Tonneins, Dama&s;an, Port St. Marie, he inve&s;ted Aiguillon, and began the mo&s;t memorable &s;iege which had been carried on for many ages. Battering engines of a prodigious &s;ize were plied again&s;t the place ince&s;&s;antly, and a&s;&s;aults given for a week together without intermi&s;&s;ion, that the garri&s;on might be tired out with continual fatigue; but the French were repul&s;ed in every attack, and the duke, after an infinite number of fruit|le&s;s attempts, de&s;pairing of taking the place by force, re&s;olved to reduce it by famine. This ta&s;k was rendered impracticable, by the vigilance and activity of the earl of Lanca&s;ter, who, though his forces were not &s;ufficient to hazard a battle with the French, found means to intercept their convoys of provi&s;ion; &s;o that the immen&s;e army of the be&s;iegers was grievou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. What ag|gravated John's chagrin, was a ra&s;h vow he had made, to continue the &s;iege until the town &s;hould capitulate. He therefore &s;truggled with a variety of difficulties, till he received the news of Edward's landing in Normandy; then he made one general effort in an a&s;&s;ault with his whole army, which la&s;ted from morning till night, when he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, after having &s;u&s;tained con&s;i|derable damage: by this time his father commanded him to relinqui&s;h the en|terprize, and even obtained the pope's ab&s;olution, with re&s;pect to the vow which he &s;o religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved. Thus relea&s;ed, he rai&s;ed the &s;iege on the twentieth day of Augu&s;t, and retired with &s;uch precipitation, that great part of his tents and equipage was left behind. Sir Walter de Manny, having obtained a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ave&s;bury$ Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE> &s;afe|conduct from the duke for him&s;elf and his followers, &s;et out immediately for Calais, to join the army commanded by Edward; and the earl of Lanca&s;ter, no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the duke of Normandy had retreated towards Paris, than he made an irruption into the Agenois: there he reduced Villareal, re|covered Tonneins, and &s;ubdued &s;everal other fortre&s;&s;es; then he marched to|wards
<PB N="58" REF="600">
Sa$nt$nge, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Sauveterre, and ravaged the country w$$hout opp$&s;i$ion. Hearing that Sir Walter de Manny and his detachment w$re $rre$ted at S$.

He had already received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Mire|b$a$, Mortagne Surmer, Aunay, Surgeres, Benon, Marans, and Taille|bourg; and now advancing to Lu&s;ignan, reduced the town by a&s;&s;ault, and compelled the ca&s;tle to &s;urrender. Having left a garri&s;on in this important place, he marched to Poitiers, which he carried at the fir&s;t attack, and aban|don$d to p$l$age. As he could not &s;pare a &s;ufficient garri&s;on for &s;uch an ex|ten&s;ive city, he ordered the walls and fortifications to be di&s;mantled; and then<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE> proceeding to Bourdeaux, returned in the beginning of the year to England.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h people were &s;o tran&s;ported with the news of the glo|rious victory which their king had obtained at Crecy, that they forgot the burthen of the heavy taxes under which they laboured, and chearfully re&s;olved to grant what farther &s;ub&s;idies &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecution of the war. The parliament a&s;&s;embled by prince Lionel, on the eleventh day of September, being made acquainted with the particulars of the battle, and pre|&s;e$ted with a paper found in the archives of Caen, containing the propo&s;als of the Normans for the inva&s;ion and conque&s;t of England, they forthwith granted an aid of two fifteenths and tenths, to be levied in two years for the &s;ervice of his maje&s;ty. Being a&s;ked from the throne if they wanted the redre&s;s of any grievances, they pre&s;ented &s;ome petitions to the clerk of the parliament; and they received &s;atisfaction in a &s;tatute, enacting, that merchants importing fal&s;e money, &s;hould be puni&s;hed as fal&s;e coiners; that per&s;ons contributing to the defence of the coa&s;t, &s;hould not be obliged to furni&s;h arms and other warlike nece&s;&s;aries for the land-&s;ervice; that ju&s;tices of the peace and &s;heriffs &s;hould be cho&s;en from among the chief freeholders of every country; and that no grants, either for life or in fee, &s;hould be made of tho&s;e offices. The com|mons likewi&s;e moved, that all monks and friars who were aliens, &s;hould be obliged to quit the realm; that the pen&s;ions granted to cardinals, and the abbot of Clugny, &s;hould be aboli&s;hed; that aliens promoted to livings in this kingdom, the greater part of whom con&s;i&s;ted of taylors, &s;hoemakers, and ve|nial retainers to cardinals, &s;hould be deprived and exi$ed, and their benefices given to poor Engli&s;h &s;cholars. The &s;e&s;&s;ion concluded with a grant by the lords and military tenants of forty &s;hillings a knight's fee, as an u&s;ual aid due upon the knighthood of the king's elde&s;t &s;on, which was now proved in a cer|t$fica$e &s;ub&s;cribed by the earls of Arundel, Northumberland, and other Engli&s;h<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

The&s;e propo&s;als are far from being improbable, if we con&s;ider how eager the king of England was to exert his whole &s;trength again&s;t Philip de Valois, and the experience he had of the difficulty that mu&s;t have attended the intire conque&s;t of Scotland, which in his own reign, as well as in that of his grandfather, had ri&s;en with fre&s;h vigour from every overthrow, and always indemnified it&s;elf at the expence of England. Though David Brus con&s;ented to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ho&s;tilities he did not reli&s;h a treaty, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to detach him&s;elf from the king of France, who had protected him in his adver&s;ity. He concluded that Edward &s;ought only to amu&s;e him until he &s;hould have humbled a more powerful ad|ver&s;ary, that he might &s;ubdue Scotland at his lei&s;ure, when &s;he would have no ally upon who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he could depend. The Scotti&s;h nation &s;eems to have been of the &s;ame opinion: for the parliament of that kingdom approved of his de&s;ign to invade England, which was now unfurni&s;hed of her be&s;t troops; and the French encouraged the re&s;olution, in hope that it would make an effectual diver&s;ion in favour of their monarch, who had not as yet recol|lected him&s;elf from his defeat at Crecy.</P>

<P>Thus in&s;tigated, David, in the month of October, entered England, at the head of fifty thou&s;and men, took Lidel by a&s;&s;ault, and put the garri&s;on to the &s;word, exacted heavy contributions from the monks and church of Durham, levied a capitation tax from all per&s;ons without di&s;tinction, ra|vaged the country, and committed numberle&s;s barbarities. The queen con&s;ort was no &s;ooner informed of this inva&s;ion than &s;he &s;et out for the north, to en|courage the lords of the Marches to do their duty; and in a little time a con&s;i|derable army was a&s;&s;embled at York, from whence it advanced in four divi|&s;ions again&s;t the enemy, who were encamped in Bear-Park, at the di&s;tance of three miles from Durham. The fir&s;t body was commanded by the lord Henry Percy, accompanied by the earl of Angus, the bi&s;hop of Durham, and &s;everal other noblemen of the north; the archbi&s;hop of York conducted the &s;econd divi&s;ion, having under his command the bi&s;hop of Carlile and the lord Nevil; the third body was led by the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, the lord Mow|bray, and Sir Thomas Rokeby; and the rear was brought up by Edward Baliol, attended by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the lord Ro&s;s, and the &s;he|riff of Northumberland. A great number of young noblemen and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction &s;erved as volunteers on this occa&s;ion, partly to expre&s;s their zeal and loyalty in the king's ab&s;ence, and partly to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves under the eye of the queen, who took the field in per&s;on. The army con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of &s;tout borderers, inured to war and hard&s;hip, reinforced by a body of veterans whom Edward had &s;ent over from France, and the whole, when they began their march, amounted to &s;ixteen thou&s;and men; but, in all proba|bility the number was con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, before they came in &s;ight of the enemy, as &s;o many noblemen mu&s;t have been attended by a great concour&s;e of va&s;&s;als, in an expedition upon which the fate of the whole kingdom in a great mea&s;ure depended. David Brus, apprized of their approach, detached
<PB N="60" REF="620">
a body of hor&s;e, under Douglas and Sir David Graham, to ob&s;erve their mo|tions and harra&s;s them in their march; but they were &s;o roughly handled by the Engli&s;h archers that they &s;oon turned their backs, though very few of them e&s;caped with their leaders; and this advantage the Engli&s;h deemed a happy omen of &s;ucce&s;s. The Scotti&s;h army was formed into one line: the high &s;teward of Scotland and the earl of March commanding on the right; the earls of Murray and Douglas being on the left wing; and David, with &s;ome French auxiliaries and the flower of his nobility, being &s;tationed in the center. The Engli&s;h archers began the battle with &s;howers of arrows on the left, which galled the Scots under the high &s;teward in &s;uch a manner, that he ordered his divi&s;ion to charge &s;word in hand, and actually broke the bow|men, who falling back upon the divi&s;ion commanded by the lord Percy, oc|ca&s;ioned great confu&s;ion and di&s;order. The enemy &s;till pre&s;&s;ed on with in|credible impetuo&s;ity$ and victory had almo&s;t declared in their favour, when Baliol coming up, with four thou&s;and choice hor&s;e at a round trot, fell upon the flank of the Scots, who had advanced beyond the re&s;t of their line, and not only &s;u&s;tained the archers, who had given way, but al&s;o cut off the communication between the high &s;teward and the main body where Brus commanded. Thus intercepted, and in great danger of being &s;urrounded, he retreated in good order, while Baliol and the whole force of that wing attacked the centre of the Scots, now left expo&s;ed by the retreat of their left wing. Here the battle was maintained with great fury on both &s;ides for a con&s;iderable time; at length the main body of the Scots gave way: then David refu&s;ing to quit the field, his nobles threw them&s;elves into a circular form, and defended him with great gallantry, he him&s;elf fighting hand to hand with his enemies, until his followers were &s;urrounded and partly &s;lain, and David received two arrows in his body. Even when he was ready to &s;ink, with the lo&s;s of blood, he di&s;|dained to a&s;k for quarter; nor would he receive it but at the hands of a gen|tleman. At la&s;t he was made pri&s;oner by John Coupland, after he had &s;truck out two of that gentleman's teeth with his gauntlet. The left wing &s;till con|tinued to maintain their ground, under the command of Douglas and Murray, till this la&s;t was &s;lain, and Douglas taken, after almo&s;t all his men had been cut in pieces. This victory would have decided the fate of Scotland, had not the high &s;teward retired in good order, and been joined by the fugitives from the battle, &s;o as to form a body which the victors did not think proper to pur|&s;ue. Neverthele&s;s they left fifteen thou&s;and men lying dead upon the &s;pot, and among the&s;e Sir Thomas Charteris chancellor of Scotland, the lord cham|berlain, Edward Keith earl mare&s;chal, the earls of Murray and Stratherne, with &s;everal other noblemen, and a great number of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The earls of Fife, Monteith, Sutherland, Wigton, and Carrick, William lord Douglas, and many other per&s;onages of note, were among the pri&s;oners. The king was conveyed by Coupland to Ogle-Ca&s;tle in Northumberland, of which he was governor; and when the queen di&s;patched a pur&s;uivant with orders to bring him Durham, he refu&s;ed to deliver up his pri&s;oner, becau&s;e in tho&s;e days the ran&s;om belonged to the captor. He thought proper however to con&s;ign David Brus to his friend the lord Nevil, and take &s;hipping imme|diately for Calais, where he communicated the whole tran&s;action to the king, who approved of his conduct, created him a knight baronet, and be&s;towed
<PB N="61" REF="630">
upon him a pen&s;ion of five hundred pounds, until the &s;ame value in lands ad|joining to his e&s;tate could be &s;ettled on him and his heirs for ever; he was or|dered however to obey the commands of the queen, who arrived in per&s;on at the camp before Calais, after having provided for the &s;afety of the kingdom, and left the care of the north to the lords Percy and Nevil, who took Hermi|tage-Ca&s;tle, and ravaged the whole county of Lothian. Coupland returning to England delivered the Scotti&s;h king to the &s;heriffs of York&s;hire, who con|veyed him to the Tower of London. John Graham earl of Monteith, and Duncan earl of Fife, having formerly &s;wore fealty to the king of England, and taken the oath to Edward Baliol as their immediate &s;overeign, were with|out any trial condemned as traytors to be drawn, hanged, and beheaded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hemingford.

<P>Mean while the garri&s;on of Calais made a noble defence under John de Vienne, who repul&s;ed the be&s;iegers in all their a&s;&s;aults. Edward, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of reducing it by force, re&s;olved to &s;tarve them into &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; and with that view, ordered huts to be built for the reception of his &s;oldiers during the winter. He received &s;upplies of men and provi&s;ion from England; and a &s;trong fleet blocked up the harbour, that the governor might receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance by &s;ea. John de Vienne, perceiving his drift, &s;ent above &s;eventeen hundred u&s;ele&s;s mouths out of the town; and Edward allowed them to pa&s;s through the camp without mole&s;tation, after he had ordered a &s;mall &s;um of money to be di&s;tributed among them for their immediate relief. During this blockade, the king of France endeavoured to detatch the Flemings from the intere&s;t of England, by offering to grant them great privileges in point of commerce, and to re&s;tore the towns he had wre&s;ted from them in the beginning of his reign. But they imputed the&s;e advances to the nece&s;&s;ity of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 134$.</NOTE> his affairs, and cho&s;e rather to depend upon the fortune of Edward, who had promi&s;ed to recover tho&s;e places by force of arms, immediately after the re|duction of Calais; they even re&s;olved to improve their connexion with England, by a marriage between Edward's elde&s;t daughter I&s;abel and their young count, who had lo&s;t his father in the battle of Crecy, fighting in the &s;ervice of France. This young prince had attained to the age of &s;ixteen; and, having been edu|cated in the French court, inherited his father's attachment to Philip as well as his aver&s;ion to the king of England. He had lately come to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his county, and the Flemings, being bent upon this alliance, kept him in a kind of honourable confinement at Courtray, until he con&s;ented to their pro|po&s;al; then a league of perpetual amity was concluded between him and Ed|ward, and the contracting powers agreed that the nuptials &s;hould be &s;olem|nized at Ea&s;ter. As Lewis &s;eemed intirely reconciled to the match, and even eager to con&s;ummate the alliance, the Flemings le&s;t off watching him with their u&s;ual vigilance, and he took the fir&s;t opportunity of e&s;caping into France, where he was married to Margaret the daughter and heire&s;s of the duke of Brabant. John, duke of Normandy, marching at the head of a numerous<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> army again&s;t the Flemings, inve&s;ted Ca&s;&s;el; but he was obliged to abandon the &s;iege at the approach of a body of forces, &s;ent by Edward to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his allies. He then made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt on Lillers, and after|wards
<PB N="62" REF="640">
advanced within two or three leagues of Calais; but the country being w$olly wa&s;ted, he was obliged to retire for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. John de Vienne, finding him&s;elf every day more and more hampered by a &s;carcity of provi$ions, turned out five hundred inhabitants from the town; and Edward refu&s;ing to let them pa&s;s, they peri&s;hed mi&s;erably by cold and famine, between the city and the camp of the be&s;iegers, to the eternal reproach of Edward and the governor. The people of Calais were by this time reduced to the la&s;t ex|trem$ty; they had already eaten up all their hor&s;es, dogs, cats, and even rats, and now began to devour one another. Letters, &s;ent by &s;ea with an account of their deplorable condition, were intercepted by Edward, who for|warded them to Philip, with a &s;arca&s;tic me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring him to come with all &s;peed to the relief of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects. The French king had already appointed the rendezvous of his army at Amiens, where his va&s;&s;als and allies a&s;&s;embled to the number of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and men; but as the Flemings with a numerous army had undertaken the &s;iege of Aire, and ra|vaged the adjacent country, he po&s;tponed his march to Calais, and advanced again&s;t the le&s;s formidable enemy, who rai&s;ed the &s;iege and retired at his ap|$roach; then he turned off towards Calais, and, on the thirtieth day of July, $n$amped within a mile of Edward between Sangate and Wit&s;and. The En|gli&s;h camp being &s;urrounded by impa&s;&s;able mora&s;&s;es, except on the &s;ide of t$e Downs of Sand, which was guarded by the navy lying at anchor on the coa&s;t, Philip &s;ent four knights to tell the king of England that he would give him battle next Thur&s;day, if he would come forth from his intrenchment and fight him on equal terms. To this me&s;&s;age Edward replied, that he would not forego the advantages he had gained, or quit the po&s;t where he was certain of reducing the town of Calais, before which he had continued &s;o long; but that it was Philip's bu&s;ine&s;s to force him to a battle if he could. That very day two cardinals arrived as mediators from the pope, and prevailed upon both kings to agree upon a truce for four days, that they might have time to &s;ettle the preliminaries of a treaty. During this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, Edward received a reinforcement of &s;eventeen thou&s;and Flemings and Engli&s;h; and then he &s;ent a letter to Philip in his turn, offering to level all his entrenchments, and give him battle on plain ground, provided he would give &s;ecurity that no pro|vi&s;ion &s;hould in the mean time be conveyed into Calais. The French mo|narch d$d not think proper to embrace this propo&s;al; and the negotiation mi&s;|carrying, he, on the &s;econd day of Augu&s;t, &s;et fire to his tents and retired to Amiens, where he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his army. Next day the governor of Calais de|&s;ired to capitulate; but Edward in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion, that the garri&s;on and inhabitants might be ran&s;omed or puni&s;hed according to his will and plea&s;ure. It was at length $tipulated that &s;ix of the principal burghers &s;hould come forth barefooted, with halters about their necks, and pre|&s;ent the keys of the town and ca&s;tle to Edward, who &s;hould puni&s;h them as he thought proper, and receive all the re&s;t into mercy. Eu&s;tace de St. Pierre and five of his fellow citizens offered them&s;elves voluntarily, as &s;acrifices for the re&s;t of the inhabitants; and in all probability they would have &s;uffered death, had not the genero&s;ity of their behaviour affected queen Philippa, who interceded in their behalf, and obtained their pardon. The town of Calais being thus &s;urrendered, after a &s;iege of eleven months, Edward expelled all
<PB N="$3" REF="650">
the inhabitants and peopled it from England; and afterwards e&s;tabli&s;hed in this place a &s;taple for tin, lead and wool, which redounded greatly to the advantage of his &s;ubjects. We cannot help ob&s;erving however that the inhabi|tants<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rym$r.</NOTE> of Calais had no great rea&s;on to extol the genero&s;ity of Edward, who &s;eemed to per&s;ecute them for the courage and per$everance they exerted in the defence of their country. Such behaviour even in this degenerate age would merit and obtain the favour of the conqueror.</P>

<P>While the king of England was employed in this memorable &s;iege, Edward Baliol entered Scotland by the way of Carlile, at the head of twenty thou&s;and men, and ravaged Galloway, Carrick, and the adjoining provinces, while the lord Percy, with an equal number of troops, made an irruption through Berwick, and wa&s;ted Lothian without oppo&s;ition. The&s;e two armies joining, advanced towards Perth, with a view to over-run the whole kingdom; but the Scotti&s;h nobility purcha&s;ed a truce of Baliol, till the eighth day of September, that they might have an opportunity to treat about the ran&s;om of their king. Edward however would not receive their overtures on this &s;ubject, until they &s;hould have made &s;atisfaction for the ravages they committed when David invaded England: and they were &s;o exa&s;p$ra$ed at this refu&s;al, that they recommenced ho&s;tilities, and made incur&s;ions. The counte&s;s of Mont|fort<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.</NOTE> took the field in Brittany, as &s;oon as the tri$nnial truce concluded for that province was expired, and reduced the for$re&s;s of Roche de Rien. Charles de Blois immediately a&s;&s;embled an army at Nantes to recover the place, which he inve&s;ted accordingly; but, before he had made great pro|gre&s;s in the &s;iege, his quarters were beaten up, his forces routed, and him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner, by Tanneguy de Cha&s;tel and Garnier de Cadoudal, at the head of the troops belonging to the counte&s;s, reinforced by a body of Engli&s;h under the command of Sir Thomas Dagworth, whom Edward had detached to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Charles de Blois, as &s;oon as his wounds were cured, was conveyed to England by this officer, in who&s;e ab&s;ence Roche de Rien was retaken by the parti&s;ans of Charles, who were joined by a &s;trong body of French auxiliaries. But a &s;top was &s;oon put to all tho&s;e ho&s;tilities by a truce, which was mediated between the two crowns by the pope, to begin on the twenty-eighth day of September, and continue till the eighth of July in the &s;ucceeding year, including all the allies of the two kings in Brittany, Flanders, Guienne, and Scotland. It was afterwards renewed by &s;everal treaties in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer</NOTE> &s;equel, but it did not prevent Edward from taking proper mea&s;ures to fortify the town and harbour of Calais, which being properly &s;ecured, and the inter|nal police well regulated, he &s;et &s;ail with his queen and prince Edward for England; and after a dangerous pa&s;&s;age landed on the twelfth day of October at Sandwich, from whence he proceeded immediately to London.</P>

But the king declined their offer, as incompatible with his &s;cheme upon France, and likely to engage him not only in a quarrel with the pope, who &s;upported the preten&s;ions of Charles, elected by another party of the German princes, but al&s;o in a di&s;tant war, the expence of which he was not able to maintain.

The French monarch made &s;uch preparations by &s;ea and land, as &s;eemed to threaten an inva&s;ion of England; and Edward re|ceived a very large aid from the counties and boroughs, on condition that the merchants &s;hould be called to account for defrauding the king of two thirds of the loan of twenty thou&s;and &s;acks of wool; that David Brus and the Scot|ti&s;h pri&s;oners &s;hould not be ran&s;omed nor relea&s;ed; that the duty of forty &s;hil|lings a &s;ack upon wool &s;hould cea&s;e in three years; that no talliage, impo&s;t, or loan &s;hould be levied without the a&s;&s;ent of the commons in parliament; that the king &s;hould repay the wool he had borrowed; that the aid for the mar|riage of his elde&s;t daughter &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended during the exaction of this &s;ub&s;idy, a certain part of which &s;hould not be rai&s;ed in ca&s;e of a peace or long truce with France.

<P>This agreement did not hinder Philip from tampering with Emeric of Pavia, whom the king of England had left governor of Calais. A private contract was carried on with this perfidious Lombard, by Geffrey de Charny, commander of the French forces in the neighbourhood of St. Omer; and he promi&s;ed, for the con&s;ideration of twenty thou&s;and golden crowns, to deliver the town and ca&s;tle into his hands at midnight, on the thirty-fir&s;t day of December. Edward being informed of this bargain by Emeric's &s;ecretary, &s;ent for that officer to London, and pardoned his treachery, on condition that he would &s;till proceed in his negotiation with Charny, that he might have an opport$nity to &s;urprize them in the violation of the truce. The French gene|ral having a&s;&s;embled with great privacy a thou&s;and cho&s;en men at arms, with a proportionable body of infantry, began his march, and arriving at the bridge of Nieulaye at the time appointed, &s;ent two me&s;&s;engers to the po&s;tern of the ca&s;tle, where they found the governor, who a&s;&s;ured them that every thing was prepared for their reception. Then he tran&s;mitted the twenty thou&s;and crowns to Emeric, by the hands of Sir Edward de Renty; and detached twelve knights, with an hundred men at arms, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle. Mean while he him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed the bridge, with the re&s;t of his forces, and took po&s;t before the gate of Boulogne, re&s;olving to enter the town with his banners di&s;|played. Edward had by this time cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, with eight hundred men at
<PB N="65" REF="670">
arms, and a thou&s;and archers, under the command of Sir Walter de Manny, and entered the harbour at night &s;o privately, that no body in the town knew of his arrival. He took po&s;t immediately in the donjon or great tower that commanded the re&s;t of the citadel; and when the French were admitted at the po&s;tern, ru&s;hed out unexpectedly, and took them all pri&s;oners: then mount|ing on hor&s;eback, he proceeded to the town, and making a &s;ally at the gate of Boulogne, fell with great fury upon Charny, who neverthele$s made a gal|lant defence, and maintained his ground till after day broke. In this action the king him&s;elf was on foot, and fought hand to hand with Eu&s;tace de Ribaumont, who, after having twice &s;taggered Edward with the force of his blows, was at length obliged to yield him&s;elf his pri&s;oner. Charny, with tho&s;e who &s;urvived, &s;eeing their retreat by the bridge of Nieulaye cut off by another detachment, and the Engli&s;h continually reinforced by fre&s;h parties from the town, &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; and being conducted into Calais were magnificently entertained in the ca&s;tle-hall by Edward, who then fir&s;t di&s;covered to them that he him&s;elf had been pre&s;ent in the engagement. He declared Ribaumont the brave&s;t knight he had ever encountered, pre&s;ented him with a rich chaplet of pearls, and &s;et him at liberty without ran&s;om. He then removed Emeric from the government of Calais, which he be&s;towed upon Sir John Beauchamp, and returned to England, where he amply re|warded tho&s;e who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves upon this occa&s;ion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE></P>

<P>The plague, which at the latter end of &s;ummer, broke out in the we&s;t of England, had by this time reached London; and therefore the parliament, which had been &s;ummoned to meet in January, was prorogued until that calamity &s;hould abate, though it raged for two years, during which no &s;e&s;&s;ion was held nor any court of ju&s;tice kept open. In the fir&s;t &s;ix months of this year &s;even and fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons are &s;aid to have died of the plague in Norwich and London; and the Church-yards being found too &s;mall for the burial of the dead, Sir Walter de Manny purcha&s;ed a piece of ground, be|longing to St. Bartholomew's ho&s;pital in Smithfield, to &s;erve for the interment of tho&s;e who were carried off by the pe&s;tilence, which no &s;ooner cea&s;ed, than he founded on the &s;pot a convent of Carthu&s;ians. This dreadful vi&s;itation &s;pread into Wales and Ireland, and raged chiefly among the common people, and of the&s;e the old men, women, and children.

<P>About this period, Philip de Valois dying at Nogent le Rotrou, was &s;ucceeded on the throne of France by his &s;on John duke of Normandy, who &s;eemed to inherit his father's animo&s;ity again&s;t Edward; and this de|&s;cended even to objects unworthy of a great king's attention. Thomas de la Marche, an illegitimate &s;on of France, who &s;erved in the army of the king of Sicily, being accu&s;ed by John Vi&s;conti of knowing and concealing the con&s;piracy which Leonard de A&s;&s;i&s;i had hatched again&s;t their monarch, he not only denied the charge, but propo&s;ed to maintain his innocence in &s;ingle com|bat at the court of Edward, who was univer&s;ally allowed to be the flower of chivalry. The duel was accordingly fought at Whitehall, in pre&s;ence of the Engli&s;h court. The combatants having &s;hivered their &s;pears on hor&s;eback, alighted and fought on foot with great fury, until clo&s;ing, Vi&s;conti fell to the ground; but he was &s;o ca&s;ed in armour that his antagoni&s;t could not make u&s;e of his advantage any other way than by driving the rowels of his &s;purs through the grated work of Viconti's vi&s;or. Thus incommoded he called out for quarter, and owned him&s;elf vanqui&s;hed; and Edward di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the victor with an honourable te&s;timony of his innocence and bravery. When he re|turned to France, he found John incen&s;ed at his conduct, in appealing to a prince who was his profe&s;&s;ed rival, and &s;till more exa&s;perated at the prai&s;es which he be&s;towed upon Edward for his genero&s;ity and equitable determination. He pined with envy at the reputation of the Engli&s;h monarch; and this low jealou&s;y prompted him to an action of cruelty and inju&s;tice, which left an un|delible &s;tain upon his character.

Perhaps he really &s;u&s;|pected him $f that collu&s;ion with the king of England which he afterwards charged upon his memory. He ordered the con&s;table to be &s;eized upon the &s;pot, and after having detained him for one day pri&s;oner in the Hotel de Ne&s;le, where he him&s;elf re&s;ided, condemned him to be behead$d, without any form

That prince was nearly related to the French king, and had been educated at the court of his father Philip, where he &s;oon di&s;played very extraordinary talents, and acquired great popularity by his in&s;inuating manners and exqui&s;ite addre&s;s. King John had endeavoured to attach him firmly to his intere&s;t, by giving him his daughter Jane in marriage: but he was of a character which no obligations could bind or influence. He trumped up a claim to the count$$s of Champagne and Brie, as well as to the dutchy of Burgundy, in right of his mother; but as this claim was not allowed, he complained that the county of Engoule&s;me, which he enjoyed by a grant of Cha$les the Fair, was of no advantage to him, as being continually wa&s;ted by the Engli&s;h; and he received in lieu of it the towns of Mante and Meulant, which b$ing added to the counties of Evreux and Mortagne, which he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Normandy, rendered him very power$ul in that province. En|go$le&s;me was be&s;towed upon John's favourite, Charles de la Cerda con&s;table of France, whom the king of Navarre con&s;idered as his mo&s;t inveterate enemy; he therefore hired ru$$ians to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate that nobleman, and even publi&s;hed a mani$e&s;to to ju&s;tify this &s;candalous act of barbarity. At the &s;ame time he treated with the duke of Lanca&s;ter for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from England, and began to

<P>The duke of Lanca&s;ter, appri&s;ed of this reconciliation, and under&s;tanding the coa&s;t of Normandy was guarded by a numerous body of forces, laid a&s;ide his de&s;ign of a de&s;cent, and was afterwards appointed lieute|nant for the king in Brittany: but the prince of Wales, having embarked his forces on board of a fleet of three hundred &s;hips, &s;et &s;ail in September from Plymouth, acco$panied by the earls of Warwick, Oxford, Sali&s;bury, Suf|folk, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction; and landing at Bourdeaux, was joined by the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Ga&s;con nobility. Finding him&s;elf, in con&s;e|quence of this junction, at the head of an army con&s;i&s;ting of three&s;core thou|&s;and men, he began his march, on the fifth day of October, towards Ar|magnac, which together with A&s;tarac, Cominges, La Riviere, and L'I&s;le-en|Jourdain, he ravaged with fire and &s;word; plundering the inhabitants, di&s;|mantling their fortre&s;&s;es, and laying the towns and villages in a&s;hes. Then he advanced to Thoulou&s;e, where the French army, exceeding his own in num|ber, was encamped, under the command of the counts of Armagnac and Foix, the prince of Orange, the con&s;table of Bourbon, and the marechal de Cler|mont. After having e&s;&s;ayed in vain to provoke them to a battle, he pa&s;&s;ed the Garonne above the city, and burned all the fine towns in the neighbourhood. From thence he advanced to Avigonet, which, together with &s;everal other im|portant places, he took and de&s;troyed; and in a word, intirely ruined one of the mo&s;t rich and fertile countries in France. The inhabitants of Montpelier burned their &s;uburbs, in expectation of being be&s;ieged; and the pope, who re&s;ided at Avignon, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the prince of Wales, with propo&s;als for &s;etting on $oot another treaty: but he would not even admit them to an audience; though he referred them to his father, who was at that time in the neighbour|hood of Calais. Innocent, affronted and alarmed at the little re&s;pect &s;hewn to his deputies, began to fortify his palace, and detached his marechal with five hundred men at arms, furni&s;hed by the cardinals and gentry of the country around, to ob&s;erve the motions of the Engli&s;h. This officer, advancing too near the prince's army, was defeated and taken, and obliged to pay fifty thou|&s;and crowns for his ran&s;om. Young Edward had already, in the &s;pace of eight weeks, de&s;troyed five hundred villages and many fortified towns; and would have continued this work of de&s;olation, had not he received intelligence that the Fre$ch army had quitted Tholou&s;e, in order to come and give him battle. He forthwith marched back to meet them; but as he approached they retired towards Tholou&s;e, though he did not know the route they had taken. He pa&s;&s;ed the river at Carbonne, where he under&s;tood they were within two leagues of his army; and a detachment of his troops beating up part of their quarters, they retreated with precipitation to Lombez and Sauve|terre, po&s;ting them&s;elves behind the Sauve, as if they intended to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age of that river. Edward following them thither, found all the bridges broken down; and while he was employed in repairing them, the French re|tired to Gimont, though not &s;o expeditiou&s;ly but that the van of the Engli&s;h

intercepted part of their rear, which was cut in pieces. He arrived with his whole army in the neighbourhood of the place in the evening, and next day drew up his forces in order of battle; but the enemy had marched off in the night, leaving a &s;trong garri&s;on in the town, which was well provided for making an ob&s;tinate defence. The &s;ea&s;on of the year being by this time too far advanced to admit of his undertaking the &s;iege with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, he returned to Bourdeaux, and di&s;tributed his forces into winter-quarters, under commanders of approved valour, who, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the wea|ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.

<P>While the prince of Wales proceeded with this rapidity of con|que&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1355.</NOTE> his father receiving intimation that the French king had advanced with a great army to the marches of Calais, re&s;olved to cro&s;s the &s;ea, and give him battle without delay. In this expedition he was attended by his &s;ons Lionel and John of Ghent, Henry duke of Lanca&s;ter, the earls of Northamp|ton, March, and Stafford, the lords Percy, Manny, and Gray&s;tock, the bi&s;hop of Durham, and a great number of barons from the north; the border being &s;ecured by a truce granted to the Scots, at their own reque&s;t. When Edward landed at Calais, he was joined by one thou&s;and men at arms, under &s;ome German, Brabantine, and Flemi&s;h knights, whom he had re|tained in his &s;ervice; and this reinforcement, added to the troops he carried over from England, con&s;tituted a con&s;iderable army, at the head of which he marched, on the &s;econd day of November, towards St. Omer, where the French king lay encamped with his forces. That prince &s;ending a knight, who had formerly been a pri&s;oner in England, with a frivolous me&s;&s;age to the king, that he might have an opportunity to ob&s;erve the Engli&s;h army, Edward allowed him to take a full view of the troops, and the di&s;po&s;ition he had made; and the knight made &s;uch a report of them to his ma&s;ter, that John thought proper to retire from St. Omer, after having de&s;troyed all the provi|&s;ions in the adjacent country. Edward followed him as far as He&s;din, but was obliged to return to Calais for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and next day &s;ome French knights came to propo&s;e a pitched battle on the Tue&s;day following. The king accepted the propo&s;al, on condition that the&s;e knights would engage to bring their ma&s;ter to the field at the appointed time; or, in default of his coming, yield them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. The Engli&s;h nobility offered to be bound for the appearance of Edward in the &s;ame penalty; but the French declined the expedient: &s;o that the king, after having waited all day on Tue&s;|day in expectation of their coming, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his foreign troops, and returned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.

<P>His return was ha&s;tened by the conduct of the Scots, who, di&s;regarding the truce, had taken the town of Berwick by &s;urprize, in the ab&s;ence of the northern nobility, and were employed in preparations for invading England. In a parliament convened at We&s;tmin&s;ter, on the twenty-third day of November, the lord Manny explained the tran&s;action of the treaty of Calais; the propo&s;al of a league with the king of Navarre; the particulars of the king's la&s;t expedition; and his de&s;ign to recover Berwick, and carry the war into the heart of Scotland. For the&s;e purpo&s;es the commons granted a greater &s;ub&s;idy on wool, wool-fells, and leather, than any parlia|ment

had ever granted before. It was to be continued for &s;ix years, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> amounted to one million five hundred thou&s;and pounds annually. Some re|gulations being made with re&s;pect to juries, and other grievances of the $$tion redre&s;&s;ed, Edward began to prepare for his northern expedition, and appointed the rendezvous of his forces at Newca&s;tle. He him&s;elf &s;et out im|mediately for the &s;ame place; and the Scots being apprized of his approach, abandon$d Berwick, which was not tenable while the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ca&s;tle. The king, advancing as far as Haddington, burned the towns and villages, but &s;aw not the face of an enemy; for the Scotti&s;h forces had retired to their woods and mountains, after having removed all their provi&s;ions and effects from the lowlands, that the Engli&s;h might not find the lea&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This was a very prudent precaution; for Edward's fleet being di&s;per&s;ed in a &s;torm, he found him&s;elf de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, and was obliged to re|turn immediately to Roxburgh. In that place Edward Baliol, now grown old and overwhelmed with infirmities, re&s;igned his title to the crown of Scot|land in favour of the Engli&s;h monarch, who, in con&s;ideration of this ce&s;&s;ion, granted him a pen&s;ion of two thou&s;and pounds a year for life, payed all his debts, and pre&s;ented him with a gratuity of five thou&s;and marks, as a recom|pence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

After this tran&s;action, the king returned to Lon|don in February, where he received a con&s;iderable aid from the prelates and the clergy; and, about this period, the earl of Northampton concluded a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> truce with the Scots till Michaelmas.</P>

<P>Mean while preparations were carrying on in France for the maintenance of a vigorous war. About the latter end of November, John called an a&s;&s;embly of the e&s;tates at Paris; and, for the fir&s;t time, the towns were ordered to &s;end deputies to this convention. Here the members, ap|pearing extremely zealous for the glory of their king, undertook to maintain t$irty thou&s;and men at arms for one year, and con&s;ented to a gabelle upon falt, a duty on all kinds of provi&s;ion, and a capitation-tax upon all per&s;ons in the kingdom without di&s;tinction. The&s;e impo&s;itions produced an in&s;urrection at Arras, and furni&s;hed the king of Navarre with an handle to diffu&s;e the &s;pirit of di&s;affection through the whole province of Normandy. He had already debauched the dauphin from his duty, and per&s;uaded him to quit his $ather's court in re&s;entment, becau&s;e he had as yet received no independent provi&s;ion: but John, by wi&s;e remon&s;trances, and gratifying his &s;on with the dukedom of Normandy, prevailed upon him to abandon this &s;educer of his youth, and even to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a de&s;ign he had formed to &s;eize the king of Na|varre, and all the lords of his party. The dauphin &s;till pretending the warme&s;t affection for Charles and his parti&s;ans, with whom he had been &s;o lately engaged, invited them to an entertainment at Rouen; and, while they &s;at at table in the ca&s;tle, John, who had privately arrived with a &s;mall num|ber of troops, &s;uddenly entered the hall, and ordered all the gue&s;ts to be ap|prehended. The count of Harcourt, with the lord of Graville, and two gentlemen, were immediately beheaded; and the king of Navarre was &s;ent to the $word$ in Paris, from whence he was afterwards removed to Arleux in Artois, where he remained in clo&s;e confinement. His brother Philip d'Ev|reux count of Longueville, incen&s;ed at his impri&s;onment; and Godfrey de Harcourt, exa&s;perated at the execution of his nephew, vowed revenge again&s;t

the tyrant, fortified all the places in their power, and &s;ent to England for &s;uccours. King Edward under&s;tanding that Charles had &s;uffered on account of a pretended league with England, &s;ent a manife&s;to to &s;everal courts, vin|dicating him from that a&s;per&s;ion; and detached Miles lord Stapleton, with a body of troops, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the defence of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Normandy, where the French forces had already reduced Evreux, and inve&s;ted Pontaudemer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE> But the&s;e being too incon&s;iderable to with&s;tand the power of France, Henry duke of Lanca&s;ter was &s;ent thither with another reinforcement; and, landing at La Hogue, was joined by the count of Longueville and Godfrey de Har|court, who had by this time done homage at the court of England to Edward, as the lawful king of France. Lanca&s;ter being at the &s;ame time reinforced by Sir Robert Knolles, with &s;ome troops from Brittany, found him&s;elf at the head of nine hundred men at arms, and fourteen hundred archers, be&s;ides a &s;trong body of infantry. With the&s;e he rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Pontaudemer, as well as that of Breteuil, and reduced Vernueil; then marching in &s;ight of the French army, amounting to forty thou&s;and men, commanded by the duke of Orleans, he encamped near L'Aigle, and returned in July to Montebourg. The affairs of Brittany requiring Lanca&s;ter's pre&s;ence in that province, the command of the forces in Normandy devolved to the count of Longueville and Godfrey de Harcourt, who exerted them&s;elves vigorou&s;ly in the pro&s;ecution of the war; but, being greatly inferior to the enemy in number, they could not prevent Tillieres and Breteuil from being taken by Robert de Clermont, marechal to the duke of Normandy. After the reduction of the&s;e places, he fell into the Cotentin; on the tenth day of November, he &s;urprized Godfrey de Harcourt, who was cut in pieces, together with his whole de|tachment of &s;even hundred men, near Coutances: and, as he died without i&s;&s;ue, the honour of St. Sauveur le Vicomte $word$ to the king of England, who afterwards be&s;towed it upon John lord Chandos. This di&s;a&s;ter was fol|lowed by the reduction of Pont de l'Arche; which, after a brave defence for four months, was &s;urrendered on the fourth day of December: but the&s;e lo&s;&s;es were in &s;ome mea&s;ure repaired by the reduction of the ca&s;tle of Evreux, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Edward prince of Wales having re|duced the greate&s;t part of the Agenois in the winter, and &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed his &s;oldiers after the fatigues of &s;uch a &s;evere campaign, began his march from Bourdeaux, on the &s;ixth day of July, at the head of two thou&s;and men at arms, &s;ix thou&s;and archers, and four thou&s;and infantry. Pa&s;&s;ing through the Agenois, he ravaged Quercy, the Limou&s;in, and Auvergne; fell into Berry, attempted I&s;&s;odun and Bourges without &s;ucce&s;s, and took Vierzon by a&s;&s;ault. Here he fir&s;t under&s;tood that the French king lay encamped at Chartres, with a prodigious army collected from all parts of his kingdom. Su&s;pecting that Edward intended to pa&s;s the Loire, and join the duke of Lan|ca&s;ter in Normandy, he had di&s;po&s;ed his troops in &s;uch a manner as to guard all the towns and pa&s;&s;ages on that river; and the prince of Wales being in|formed of this di&s;po&s;ition, re&s;olved to turn off on the left to Romarantin, ravage Poitou, and return through Saintonge to Bourdeaux. Three hundred lances, under the command of the lords of Craon and Boucicaut, in attempt|ing
<PB N="76" REF="780">
to c$t off his advanced guard, were defeated, and fled to the ca&s;tle of Ro$arant$n, where, in a few days, they were obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cre|tion. The prince in his route had taken above &s;ix thou&s;and men at arms, who were &s;ent pri&s;oners to Bourdeaux, and la$d wa&s;te a prodigious tract of country. Marching through part of Touraine and Anjou, $outh of the Loire, he now entered Po$tou; and, on Saturday the &s;eventeenth day of September, encamped between Beauvoir and Maupertuis, within two leagues of Poitiers. The king of France coming up with an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and hor&s;e, be&s;ides infantry, called a council of war, in which it was re&s;olved to attack the Engli&s;h next morning. Edward was already &s;o &s;traitened for want of provi&s;ions, that, in a few days, he mu&s;t have bee$ &s;tarved into a &s;urren|der; but the French, confiding in their valour and the va&s;t &s;uperiority of their numbers, demanded a battle &s;o eagerly, that John did not think proper to di&s;appoint their ardour and ambition. He divided his army into three bodies; of which the fir&s;t and mo&s;t advanced was commanded by his brother the duke of Orleans; the &s;econd was po&s;ted on the left, under the conduct of the dauphin, a&s;&s;$$ted by his brothers Lewis and John; while the king in per|&s;on, accompanied by his younge&s;t &s;on Philip, commanded the third divi&s;ion, as a body of re&s;erve. This order being &s;ettled, John detached the lords of Ribaumont, La$das, and Beaujeu, to view the countenance and di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy, whom they found po&s;ted among bu&s;hes, hedges, and vineyards, &s;o as to be inacce&s;&s;ible in every quarter, but by a narrow lane lined with hedges, behind which a body of Engli&s;h archers was planted to command the pa&s;&s;age. Ribaumont advi&s;ed the king to di&s;mount all his cavalry, excep$ three hundred cho&s;en men in complete armour, who &s;hould enter the defile, and make way for the attack of the di&s;mounted cavaliers. In con&s;equence of this advice, the three hundred men were armed for this &s;ervice, and all the re&s;t of the troops ordered to charge on foot, except a few German &s;quadrons, which continued on hor&s;eback, to be occa&s;ionally employed according to the emergencies of the action. Ju&s;t when John was going to begin the battle, the cardinal of Perigort, employed by the pope to renew the negotiations be|tween the two crowns, running up to the king, conjured him to $pare the lives of &s;o many French gentlemen, which would nece&s;&s;arily be lo&s;t in the attack, and allow him to repair to the Engli&s;h camp, where he did not doubt of being able to per&s;uade the prince of Wales to &s;urrender. Having obtained this pe$|mi&s;&s;ion, he ha&s;tened to Edward, who being very &s;en&s;ible of his dangerous &s;ituation, declared him&s;elf ready to accept of any terms that &s;hould be con|&s;i&s;tent with his own honour and that of his country. When the cardinal re|turned with this an&s;wer, John &s;ent back his troops to their quarters; and the mediator &s;pent the whole day in pa&s;&s;ing between the two camps, to &s;ettle the articles of accommodation. The prince of Wales offered to re&s;tore all the places and pri$oners he had taken in that campaign; and ab&s;tain, for &s;even years, from carrying arms again&s;t the king of France, on condition of being allowed to retire unmole&s;ted to Bourdeaux. But John peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon Edward's &s;urrendering him&s;elf pri&s;oner, with an hundred knight$; and in that ca&s;e the Engli&s;h army &s;hould be permitted to retire without mole&s;ta|tion. The prince, far from &s;ub&s;cribing to this article, told the cardinal, that he and his knights &s;hould never be taken but in battle; and that he would
<PB N="77" REF="790">
rather lo&s;e his life than agree to &s;uch a propo&s;al. Thus the negotiation was broke off, and both &s;ides prepared for an engagement; though Edward de|rived &s;ome advantage from this &s;mall re&s;pite, during which he had rendered his camp more defen&s;ible by means of ditches and palli&s;adoes. On Monday morning the French army appeared in the order of battle we have already de|&s;cribed; and Edward drew up his handful of troops in three divi&s;ions, ranged in a clo&s;e compacted form, with hedges and ditches in his front, while his flanks were defended on one &s;ide by a mountain, and on the other by a mora&s;s. On the declivity of the hill the van was po&s;ted, under the command of the earl of Warwick; the rear was conducted by the earls of Sali&s;bury and Suffolk; and the prince of Wales took his &s;tation at the end of the lane, to command the main body, which extended it&s;elf into a vineyard. John de Greilly, Captal de Buche, was detached with three hundred men at arms and as many archers, to form an ambu&s;h under cover of the trees, bu&s;hes, and broken ground, at the foot of the mountain, that he might fall upon the enemy's back in the heat of the action: and the open part of the ground, on which the Engli&s;h &s;tood, was enclo&s;ed by the waggons of the army. About nine of the clock in the morning, the cho&s;en body of men at arms entered the lane with great re&s;olution; but they were &s;o galled by the Engli&s;h archers that lined the hedges through which they pa&s;&s;ed, that one half of them fell before they reached the front of Edward's main body, where they were cut in pieces by the lord Audeley. The marechals Clermont and Andrehan, ad|vancing clo&s;e behind tho&s;e men at arms, were greatly embarra&s;&s;ed by the hor&s;es and bodies of the $lain, which choaked up the pa&s;&s;age, while the archers plied them without intermi&s;&s;ion. When they penetrated to the van of the Engli&s;h, they met with a very warm reception from the earl of Warwick; and Sali&s;bury and Suffolk, advancing from the rear, completed their confu|&s;ion. Clermont was killed upon the &s;pot, and Andrehan felled to the ground by the lord Audeley, who took him pri&s;oner. The fate of the&s;e noblemen, and the &s;laughter that en&s;ued, di&s;concerted their followers &s;o much, that they fell into di&s;order, and fled with great precipitation. The fir&s;t body of the French being thus routed, the dauphin advanced to the charge, though his men were already di&s;pirited; but they had no &s;ooner begun the attack, than John de Greilly ru&s;hing from his ambu&s;h, fell upon their rear with &s;uch fury, that they were immediately &s;eized with con&s;ternation, and betook them&s;elves to flight. Tho&s;e noblemen who were particularly entru&s;ted with the care of the dauphin's per&s;on, conveyed him from the field to Chavigny, under a guard of eight hundred lances; and the duke of Orleans, with the greate&s;t part of his command, which had not yet engaged, thought proper to follow the &s;ame route. The prince of Wales &s;eeing tho&s;e two bodies broken and routed, immediately mounted his hor&s;e, and advanced at the head of his men at arms, $o attack the third divi&s;ion, commanded by John him&s;elf, who waited for him without flinching. Notwith&s;tanding the impetuo&s;ity with which Edward began the charge, the battle was a long time maintained with equal valour on both &s;ides, and dubious &s;ucce&s;s, till Gauchet de Brienne duke of Athenes, and con&s;table of France, was $lain; then his brigade gave way, and victory declared in favour of the Engli&s;h. The prince of Wales falling in among the German cavalry, routed them at the fir&s;t on&s;et, in which the
<PB N="78" REF="800">
count of Sarbruck was &s;lain, and the count of Na&s;&s;au taken pri&s;oner. John king of France, attended by his &s;on Phi$ip, endeavoured to rally his troops, and animate them by his own example. He $ought on foot with uncommon valour, until he was de&s;erted by a$l his followers; and Dennis de Morhec, a knight of Artois, who had formerly been in his &s;ervice, exhorting him to &s;urrender without further oppo&s;ition, he de&s;ired to &s;ee his cou&s;in the prince of Wales: but as Edward chanced to be in another part of the field, he threw his gauntlet to Morhec, in &s;ignal of &s;urrender. Mean while a party of Engli&s;h, and another of Ga&s;con$, coming up, deprived him of his royal pri|&s;oner, about whom a di&s;pute en&s;ued, which might have been attended with f$$al con&s;equences to John and his &s;on Philip, who &s;hared his fate, had not the earl of Warwick and Reginald lord Cobham interpo&s;ed, and conducted him to prince Edward, who had retired to his pavilion, where he repo&s;ed him&s;elf after the fatigue of the battle. Upon this occa&s;ion, the Black Prince exhibited all the heroi&s;m of virtue: he received the king of France with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect; he comforted him under his di&s;a&s;ter, by ob|&s;erving that &s;ucce&s;s very often depends upon accident, that he had performed the part of a con&s;ummate general and undaunted hero; and that he had fallen into the hands of tho&s;e who knew how to revere his virtues and misfortune. He expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t profound e&s;teem, and even a warm affection, for the royal family of France, to which he had the honour of being related; and he promi$ed to exert all his influence with his father to promote an honourable peace, which &s;hould be for the advantage of both nations. He even waited upon him at &s;upper, and could not be prevailed upon to &s;it down, notwith|&s;tanding the intreaties of John, who bore his fate with un&s;haken fortitude; and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction, that &s;ince he was doomed to captivity, he had the good fortune to be the pri&s;oner of the mo&s;t gallant prince in the univer&s;e. The French noblemen, who had been taken in the battle, were &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment and reverential awe at this in&s;tance of genero&s;ity and moderation. They looked upon him as a being of &s;ome &s;uperior &s;pecies; and while they manife&s;ted their veneration for his great qualities, could not help lamenting the fate of their country, which was expo&s;ed to the re&s;entment of an enemy, endowed with &s;uch extraordinary talents. The lord Audeley having &s;igna|lized his per&s;onal prowe&s;s above all the noblemen in the field, the prince de|&s;ired to &s;ee him; and he was brought dangerou&s;ly wounded to his tent, where Edward highly extolled his valour, retained him as his knight, with a grant of five hundred marks a year out of his own inheritance; which bounty he forthwith di&s;tributed among his four e&s;quires, who had fought by his &s;ide in the battle. Edward being informed of this particular, applauded his genero|&s;ity, confirmed the donation, and &s;ettled upon Audeley &s;ix hundred marks a<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> year ou$ of the coinage of the &s;tannaries of Cornwall. This great victory was gained without the lo&s;s of one per&s;on of di&s;tinction; whereas the French lo&s;t the flower of their nobility, who, rather than de&s;ert their &s;overeign, cho&s;e to die in his defence. Among tho&s;e were the count of Dammartin, the lords of Rochefoucault, Mathas, La Tour, Montaign, Landas, Charny, and Ribaumont: Gucelard d'Angle was left for dead among the $lain, but recovering of his wounds, he entered into the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, was admitted a knight of the garter, and created earl of Huntingdon.

counts, five thou&s;and men at arms, and about eight $word$ $word$ are &s;aid to have been killed on the French &s;ide in this batt$$$ $wo thou&s;and men at arms were taken pri&s;oners; and among the&s;e the counts of Ponthi$u, Eu, and Tancarville, princes of th$ blood; the archbi&s;hop of Sens, the counts of E&s;t$mpes a$d Vaudemont, the lords of Parthenay, Rochechouart, Chaulny, and many other noblemen. The gates of Poitiers b$ing &s;hut upon the fugitives, le&s;t their pur&s;uers &s;hould enter the town with them pell-mell, &s;uch a multitude of pri&s;oners were taken, that the victors di&s;mi&s;&s;ed great numbers on parole, at very ea&s;y ran&s;oms, which were punctually payed. Every &s;oldier of Edward's army was enriched with the &s;poils of the enemy and the ran&s;om of the pri&s;oners, which belonged to the captors, when it did not exceed ten thou&s;and crowns; in which ca&s;e it was the king's property. Next day prince Edward decamped, and, without undertaking the &s;iege of Poitiers, retired with his pri&s;oners and booty through Saintonge to Bourdeaux; while the dauphin ha&s;tening to Paris, a&s;&s;embled the three e&s;tates, to concert mea&s;ures for the defence of the kingdom, and contribute their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to|wards the ran&s;om of their &s;overeign. Before the &s;tates would grant a &s;upply, they took the advantag$ of their king's di&s;tre&s;s, to humble the power of the crown: they in&s;i&s;ted upon the immediate removal of &s;even principal officers of &s;tate, as well as upon the relea&s;e of the king of Navarre; they appointed a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve prelates, twelve noblemen, and the like number of burge&s;&s;es, without who&s;e advice the dauphin, who acted as lieu|tenant of the realm, &s;hould take no &s;tep in the admini&s;tration; and they de|manded that all the grievances of the nation &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed. John being made acquainted with the&s;e tran&s;actions, de&s;ired the dauphin would by no means agree to &s;uch in&s;olent demands; for he would rather continue pri&s;oner to an honourable enemy, than return home as a &s;lave to his own &s;ubjects. As the e&s;tates would not relax in their propo&s;itions, they were di&s;&s;olved by the dauphin, who had $ecour&s;e to the city of Paris for an aid to maintain the war: but the inhabitants, in&s;tead of complying with his reque&s;t, gave him to under&s;tand, that they were not obliged to pay any &s;ub&s;idy that was not im|po&s;ed by the three e&s;tates, which they exhorted him to re-a&s;&s;emble. Such an&s;wers he received from all the provinces but Champagne and Languedoc, which he found more tractable.</P>

<P>POPE Innocent VI. had, upon hearing of John's being carried to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1357.</NOTE> Bourdeaux, $ent thither the cardinals of Perigort and St. Vital to mediate a peace; and though they did not &s;ucceed in that part of their nego|tiation, they obtained Edward's con&s;ent to a truce for two years by &s;ea and land. The duke of Lanca&s;ter, who had inve&s;ted Rennes, was by an article of this agreement to rai&s;e the &s;iege; but he refu&s;ed to conform to this article, until the truce &s;hould be ratified by the king of England; and in the mean time carried on his operations with &s;uch redoubled vigour, that the inhabitants were glad to pay an hundred thou&s;and crowns to indemnify him for the ex|pence of the &s;iege, and obliged them&s;elves to receive a governor of his own chu&s;ing. After the ratification of this truce, prince Edward bought up all the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

When the tidings of the victory at Poitiers fir&s;t arrived in England, the king, in&s;tead of encouraging revellings and demon&s;trations of joy, de&s;ired that the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury would appoint a whole week to be &s;pent in prayer and thank&s;giving, that he and the nation might not be too much in|toxicated by their &s;ucce&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding this in&s;tance of his moderation and &s;elf-denial, he now directed the lord-mayor to prepare pageants, proce&s;|&s;ions, and triumphal arches, to honour the public entrance of his victorious &s;on, who was me$ in Southwark by the mayor and aldermen in their forma|lities, with one thou&s;and citizens on hor&s;eback. The royal pri&s;oner rode thro' the &s;treets of London in a magnificent habit, mounted on a fine white cour&s;er, and attended by the prince of Wales, on a little black hor&s;e with ordinary trap|pings. The inhabitants vied with each other in di&s;playing plate, tape&s;try, fur|niture, and arms offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, in their &s;hops, windows, and bal|conies. The &s;treets were lined with an infinite concour&s;e of people; and the cavalcade la&s;ted from three in the morning till noon, when they reached We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall, where the king of England &s;at upon a royal throne, in expecta|tion of their coming. He ro&s;e up when John approached, and received him with all that courteous civility which might have been expected from a prince of his character. Then he embraced his &s;on wi$h great tenderne&s;s, and told him, that the victory did not plea&s;e him &s;o muc$ as the mode&s;ty with which he had bore his good fortune. As for the captive king, he was entertained in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous mann$r, and provided with an apartment in the king's palace, until the Savoy could be $itted up for his reception.</P>

<P>Immediately after John's public entrance, which mu&s;t have been a very di&s;agreeable ceremony to a vanqui&s;hed king, the two cardinals arrived in England with &s;ome propo&s;als of peace, which Edward $ound &s;o unrea&s;onable, that he would not even appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to treat upon the &s;ubject. Find|ing him aver&s;e to that negotiation, they demanded the arrears of the tribute which had been formerly payed to Rome; but the king rejected this demand as an ob&s;olete chimera, and plainly told them, as he held his crown of God alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $word$.</NOTE> he would never pay tribute to any mortal what&s;oever. Notwith&s;tanding $$is de$al they took care of them&s;elves, by rai&s;ing procurations upon the clergy; and t$at they might not &s;eem to have come over to no purpo&s;e, they laboured to bring the treaty to perfection, which had been long upon the carpet, for the ran&s;om of David Bruce king of Scotland. At length it was ratified, and David, as acknowledged king of Scotland, and an independent monarch, &s;et at liberty, upon his giving ho&s;tages for the payment of one hundred thou&s;and marks &s;ter$ing, to be advanced in ten years at equal portions; and until the w$ole &s;hould be liquidated, it was agreed that a truce &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t and be in|violably ob&s;erved by both nations. David, after a long captivity, returning to Scotla$d, di&s;inherited his nephew Robert Stuart, who had de&s;erted him at the b$ttle of Durham, and &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his crown upon Alexander, &s;on of the earl of Sutherland, who had married his younger &s;i&s;ter. But this young nobleman dying in a few years, and David's re&s;entment cooling, he con&s;idered Robert's character in a differ$nt light: he found his conduct had been always $u&s;t, &s;teady, and unblemi&s;hed; that he had &s;ignalized his valour and $agacity on many occa&s;ions, in the de$ence and admini&s;tration of the kingdom; and that his b$haviour at the battle of Durham was irreproachable; for his men had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to return to the king's relief: on the&s;e con&s;iderations he took him into favour again; and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne was e&s;tabli&s;hed by act<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$.</NOTE> o$ parliament.</P>

<P>Nothing could be more &s;ea&s;onable to the dauphin of France, than the truce concluded at Bourdea$x. His authority was not yet &s;ettled: the Navar|rois had &s;urprized Hon$$eur; a body of French troops attempting to recover $t$ had been routed by Sir Robert Knolles; and Stephen Marcel, prevot de marchands in Paris, at the head of a mutinous populace, dem$nded that the king of Navarre &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, and the three e&s;tates rea&s;&s;embled. The dauphin, being aver&s;e to a compliance with either of the&s;e demands, $$mmoned deputies from &s;eventy towns; but the&s;e pretending they had no $$wer to rai&s;e &s;ub&s;idies, he was obliged to a&s;&s;emble the e&s;tates. About this $$me, the king of Navarre e&s;caping from the ca&s;tle of Arleux, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance o$ John de Pequigny governor o$ Artois, made a public entry into Paris, where he was received by the pre$ot with his off$cers, and above ten thou&s;and inhabitants in arms. He harrangued the populace from a &s;caffold, on the cruelty and inju&s;tice of his impri&s;onment; and became &s;o formidable by his popularity, that the dauphin was fain to comply with all his demands. He gratified him with a &s;um of money, as a reparation of the injuries he had &s;u&s;|tained; he granted an amne&s;ty to him and all his parti&s;ans; he promi&s;ed to re&s;tore their forfeited e&s;tates; and i&s;&s;ued orders for the re&s;titution o$ all the places that belonged to him in Normandy. The governors, however, looking $pon the&s;e orders as extorted by violence, refu&s;ed to deliver up their charge:
<PB N="83" REF="850">
and the king of Navarre, complaining of this refu&s;al as a breach of &s;tipulation, retired to Normandy, where he began to levy troops, and foment di&s;turbances again&s;t the government. The Pari&s;ians perceiving that the dauphin had levied troops in the provinces, made barricadoes in their &s;treets, and fortified all the avenues of their city, which was divided into different factions. The prevot, at the head of the Navarrois, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by party-coloured hats, exclaimed again&s;t the mini&s;try, and loudly demanded the re&s;titution of the places, according to the agreement made with the king of Navarre. They even carried their outrages &s;o far as to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Robert de Clermont, and John de Conflans, marechal of France and Burgundy, in the king's pre&s;ence. The e&s;tates being a&s;&s;embled at Paris, in&s;tead of taking mea&s;ures to repre&s;s the&s;e violences, demanded that the management of the finances &s;hould be put into the hands of the committee appointed in the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly; and that they &s;hould have the nomination of the per&s;ons that were to compo&s;e the council of &s;tate. The king of Navarre going to Paris, began to in&s;inuate in his harrangues, his pretended right to the crown of France in right of his mother, who was daugh|ter of Lewis Hutin; and at la&s;t formed a de&s;ign to &s;urprize the dauphin. This prince, who had hitherto acted only as the king's lieutenant, was now declared regent of the kingdom by the parliament; and repairing to Com|piegne, convoked an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, who complied with all his de|mands, and granted &s;ub&s;idies for levying troops with all expedition. By this time, the noble&s;&s;e of the provinces were exa&s;perated again&s;t the Pari&s;ians, for the murder of the two marechals; and willingly contributed towards the ven|geance of the dauphin, who, having a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, formed the blockade of Paris, while the king of Navarre encamped at St. Denis with his own troops and a reinforcement of Engli&s;h, who plundered both parties alike.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1358.</NOTE> The licentiou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e auxiliaries provoked the Pari&s;ians to &s;uch a degree, that a great number of tho&s;e who had been formerly attached to Charles of Navarre now declared for the dauphin; the prevot, in order to prevent a general defection, concerted a &s;cheme with the Navarrois, to ma&s;&s;acre all who adhered to the regent, and proclaim Charles of Navarre king of France. Marks were &s;et upon the hou&s;es of tho&s;e doomed to de&s;truction. The fir&s;t day of Au|gu&s;t was appointed for the execution of this execrable de&s;ign; and the troops of Navarre approached the gates of St. Honor&eacute; and St. Antoine in the night. A little before day-break, the prevot going to the Porte de St. Antoine, and finding &s;ome burge&s;&s;es on guard, who were not privy to the de&s;ign, he ordered them to deliver up the keys and return to their own homes, as their &s;tay was no longer nece&s;&s;ary. Some of the&s;e &s;u&s;pecting mi&s;chief, &s;ignified their doubts to John Maillard, who commanded in the next di&s;trict; and he advancing with a party, oppo&s;ed the orders of the prevot. A di&s;pute aro&s;e, and &s;ome bit|ter altercation en&s;uing, John &s;lew the demagogue, with a number o$ his $ol|lowers: then &s;ecuring his parti&s;ans, whom the prevot had po&s;ted at the two gates, he a&s;&s;embled the people, and made them acquainted with the particu|lars of the con&s;piracy, which by this time he had learned from the confe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e whom he had arre&s;ted. The populace were &s;o exa&s;perated at this infor|mation, that they treated the dead body of the prevot with the utmo&s;t indig|nity, inveighed again&s;t the king of Navarre, and called aloud for the regent's return. Two coun&s;ellors were accordingly deputed to invite him to the city,

which he entered amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. The king of Na|varre, &s;eeing all his mea&s;ures defeated, &s;ent an open defiance to the dauphin and the Pari$ians; and he maintained a bloody war with his own forces and a body of Ga&s;cons, whom his kin&s;man the captal de Buche had brought to his<NOTE PLACE="marg">F$$i&s;&s;$rt.

<P>The truce between France and England was prolonged from April to Mid&s;ummer, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the pope, who thought by that time all dif|ferences<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1359.</NOTE> between the two monarchs might be amicably compromi&s;ed. They had already &s;igned a treaty of peace at London, upon the following conditions: That, in con&s;ideration of Edward's quitting all claim to the dutchy of Nor|mandy, the counties of Anjou and Maine, and the crown of France, he and his heirs &s;hould enjoy Ga&s;cony, Guienne, L'Engoumois, Saintonge, Perigort, Quercy, Limo&s;in, Foictou, Touraine, Calais, Gui&s;nes, the Boulonnois, and county of Ponthieu, intirely independent of the kingdom of France: And that John, with the French noblemen who had been taken pri&s;oners, &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, on the payment of four millions of gold crowns for his and their ran&s;om. This treaty being con&s;idered in an a&s;&s;embly of the e&s;tates of France, was rejected as incompatible with the honour and &s;afety of the king|dom; and Edward, incen&s;ed at their refu&s;al, threatened to vi&s;it the dauphin at Paris, as &s;oon as the truce &s;hould be expired. The regent, that he might be the better prepared for his reception, compromi&s;ed his di&s;pute with the king of Navarre and the count of Harcourt; though Philip count of Longueville would not accede to this accommodation. Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many ca&s;tles in Normandy, Picardy, and Champagne, he continued ho&s;tilities, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a number of Engli&s;h knights, who, though they had no commi&s;&s;ions $rom the king, took this opportunity of enriching them&s;elves with plunder.</P>

<P>Edward had begun to make mighty preparations for invading France; and his de&s;ign was no &s;ooner known abroad, than a multitude of knights, with their followers, repaired to his &s;tandard at Calais, from Germany, Brabant, and the Low-Countries: &s;o that the place being exceedingly crouded, a &s;car|city of provi&s;ions en&s;ued, and this was attended with many di&s;orders. To re|move the&s;e inconveniencies, Henry duke of Lanca&s;ter went over in September with a body of forces, and taking the field advanced to Ceri&s;y on the Somm&eacute;, where he continued encamped, until he heard of the king's arrival from Eng|land. Edward landed on the twenty-eighth day of October at Calais, with an army of one hundred thou&s;and men, tran&s;ported in eleven hundred &s;ail of &s;hips, together with a va&s;t quantity of provi&s;ions for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. He was at|tended by the Black Prince and three other &s;ons, namely Lionel of Antwerp earl of Ul&s;ter, John of Ghent earl of Richmond, and Edmund of Langely; the earls of Warwick, Marche, Hereford, Suffolk, Stafford, Sali&s;bury, and Northampton, the lords Percy, Neville, D'E&s;pen&s;er, Chandos, Manny, Cobham, Mowbray, Delawarre, Grey of Codenore, Audeley, Ba&s;&s;et, Char|leton, and Fitzwalter; and the king's fifth &s;on Thomas of Wode&s;toke, though a child, was left guardian of the kingdom, under the direction of a council. On the fourth day of November, Edward began his march from Calais, in two divi&s;ions, one of which the prince of Wales commanded; and being joined by the duke of Lanca&s;ter, continued his progre&s;s in &s;pite of deep roads and rainy $eather, through Artois and Picardy, till he reached the neighbourhood of
<PB N="85" REF="870">
Rheims in Champagne, where the kings of France were generally crowned. Here he propo&s;ed to be inve&s;ted with the royal diadem of France; and the bi&s;hop of Lincoln and Durham attended him, in order to perform the cere|mony: but the place was &s;o well &s;ecured with fortifications and a &s;trong garri|&s;on, that he did not think proper to inve&s;t it in form, but kept it blocked up till the beginning of Lent, and in the mean time reduced &s;ome &s;mall fortre&s;&s;es in the neighbourhood. In the beginning of the year, he marched towards<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1360.</NOTE> Troyes, and entering Burgundy took the town of Tonnere, though he could not reduce the ca&s;tle: thence he proceeded to Montreal, Avallon, and Guillon, where Philip duke of Burgundy purcha&s;ed a truce for three years, at the price of one hundred thou&s;and nobles, payed under the name of a con&s;ideration for the re&s;titution of Flavigny, which had been taken by &s;ome Engli&s;h adven|turers. Edward, advancing to Clamecy, granted a like compo&s;ition to the people of the Nivernois; then ravaged all the Gatenois and Brie, and com|ing in &s;ight of Paris on the la&s;t day of March, fixed his head-quarters at Bourg|la-Reine, from whence his army extended to Lonjumeau, and as far as Cor|beil. A treaty was again &s;et on foot by the pope's mediation, but proved as fruitle&s;s as the former; and the king advancing towards the Faubourg S. Marcel, chall$$ged the dauphin to battle, offering to quit all claim to the crown of France, &s;hould he be defeated. This propo&s;al being rejected, the weather extremely cold, and the ground de&s;titute of forage, he made an un|&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon the &s;uburbs, and began his march next day for Bre|tagne, from whence he propo&s;ed to return in July or Augu&s;t, and undertake the &s;iege of Paris in form.</P>

<P>The regent, dreading the intire reduction of Brittany, and &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of being able to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of &s;uch a powerful army, as the finances of the kingdom were exhau&s;ted, and the neighbourhood of the capital in&s;ulted by the king of Navarre, who had by this time renounced his treaty: for the&s;e rea&s;ons, he re&s;olved to conclude a peace with England, as the only means of preventing the ruin of the kingdom. With this view, he &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Terouenne, chancellor of France, with three other commi&s;&s;ioners, to propo&s;e a treaty; and they overtaking Edward near Gui$lardon in Beauce, he appointed plenipotentiaries to treat with them on the &s;ubject of their amba&s;&s;y; though he did not interrupt his march, until he arrived at Bretigny in the Pais Chartrain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mind of Edward is &s;aid to have been di&s;|po&s;ed to peace, by a dreadful &s;torm that looked like a judgment from heav$n. When he had ad|vanced within two leagues of Chartre$, an hurri|cane began to blow with incredible violence; and a &s;hower of hail&s;tone$ de&s;$ended of &s;uch a prodigi|ous &s;ize, that &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;es and one thou$and men were &s;tru$k dead in&s;tantancou&s;ly, while the cope of heaven &s;eemed to be rent with horrible pe$ls of thunder. The king, affrighted at this tremendous &s;cene, threw him&s;elf from his hor&s;e upon the ground; and, &s;tretching out his hands towards the church of Chartres, &s;olemnly vowed to God, that he would no longer reject the off$rs of peace, if it might be obtained on rea&s;onabl$ conditions.</NOTE>.

<P>King Edward went thither in October, to receive the fir&s;t payment of the ran&s;om, amounting to &s;ix hu$dred thou&s;and crowns of gold; but the country of France had been &s;o gri$$ou&s;ly exhau&s;ted, that not above two thirds of the &s;um could be rai&s;ed; and ho&s;tages were given for the payment of the re|mainder at Candlemas.

<P>Edward, having concluded this important negotiation, returned in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1361.</NOTE> November to England, where the peace was celebrated with all &s;orts of rejoicing; as the people now expected to be ea&s;ed of the grievous taxes under which they had laboured &s;o long. A parliament being convened at We&s;tmin&s;ter, on the twenty|fourth day of January, the articles of the treaty were laid before the two hou&s;es, and unanimou&s;ly approved. But the &s;atisfaction occa&s;ioned by this event was &s;oon damped, by the fatal con&s;equences of a dreadful plague which broke out at this period, and &s;wept away great numbers, among whom were the lords Mowbray, Seymour, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction; but none &s;o regretted as Henry duke of Lanca&s;ter, who was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed and beloved for his great and amiable qualities. The French were likewi&s;e overjoyed at the peace, which not only &s;aved them from immediate ruin, but re&s;tored to li|berty their beloved &s;overeign, for who&s;e ran&s;om they taxed them&s;elves with great chearfulne&s;s, even while their country groaned under di&s;tractions, feuds, and depredations. A great number of ca&s;tles had, during the troubles, been &s;eized by private adventurers, who formed companies of freebooters and ra|vaged the adjacent territories; and now after the conclu&s;ion of the treaty, they refu&s;ed to quit their fortre&s;&s;es and their rapine, alledging, they had no other means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The counts of Foix, Armagnac, Cominges, Perigort, and other powerful barons, refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to transfer their homage from the crown of France to the king of England; and this aver&s;ion created &s;uch diffi|culties and delays in delivering the countries and places according to the &s;tipu|lations of the treaty, that Mid&s;ummer was elap&s;ed before the articles could be performed. At length, however, all tho&s;e places were delivered up to John de Chandos, whom Edward had con&s;tituted his lieutenant in tho&s;e countries, except &s;ome few fortre&s;&s;es po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e lawle&s;s banditti, who refu&s;ed to comply with the orders they received. Tho&s;e who did evacuate their ca&s;tles, after having been u&s;ed to rapine, joined a &s;trong body of freebooters, compo&s;ed of Engli&s;h, Ga&s;cons, French, Brabantines, Flemings, and Germans, who amounted to &s;ixteen thou&s;and, and ravaged all the inland provinces. The count of La Marche advancing again&s;t them, was utterly defeated in the neigh|bourhood of Lion, and died in three days of the wounds he had received in the action. One of their leaders &s;eized An&s;e on the Saone, where he fortified him&s;elf, and from thence made excur&s;ions to ravage all the neighbouring coun|tries; the re&s;t, to the number of thirteen thou&s;and, marched towards Avignon, and &s;urpri&s;ed Pont St. E&s;prit, where they found a prodigious booty. The pope publi&s;hed a cru&s;ade again&s;t them, but this had no &s;or$ of effect to their prejudice; on the contrary, they were daily joined by de&s;erters and di&s;banded &s;oldiers, allured by the hope of plunder and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. At length John mar|quis of Montferrat, being at war with Galeazo and Barnaby Vi&s;conti, lords of
<PB N="88" REF="900">
M$$an, was invited by the pope and cardinals to Avignon, and furni&s;hed with money to take tho&s;e freebooters into his &s;ervice. He accordingly enli&s;ted them, and by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance reduced A$ba Pompeia, Novara, and Pavia; but they were debauched from his &s;ervice by the $$&s;contis, who offered them<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> larger appointments than they rec$ived from the marquis.</P>

<P>Mean while the ki$g of England, in order to reconcile his new &s;ub|jects to the Eng$i&s;h government, re&s;olved to put them under the immediate government of his heir apparent, to who&s;e worth they were no &s;trangers. The Black Prince had lately married his cou&s;in Jane, d$ughter of Edmund Plan|tagenet earl of Kent, and widow of Sir Thomas Holland, by virtue of a di&s;|pen&s;ation from the pope; and the nuptials were &s;olemnized with great mag|ni$icence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1362.</NOTE> at Wi$d&s;or. The king had made a conveyance to him of Poitou and all the provinces lying between that country and the Pyren$es. He now declared him prince of Aquitaine and Ga$cony, to be held of the king by ho|mage liege and an annual trib$te of an ounce of gold: and, this charter being ex$cuted i$ July, prince Edward emp$oyed the r$&s;t of that year in making preparations for his voyage to Bourdeaux, where he propo&s;ed to keep a mag|nificent court. In the beginning of February he d$parted from England, and was joyfully received in his new dominions, where the earls, barons, and knights, &s;wore $ealty to him with the utm$&s;t alacrity; and his politene&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer.</NOTE> and affability &s;oon conc$l$$ted the aff$ction of the people. While his mild and equitable admini&s;tration rendered his &s;$bjects happy in Guienne, his father convoked a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter for the reformation of abu&s;es, and in order to deliberate upon the expedi$ncy of $recting a &s;taple for wool at Calais. Divers grievances were redre&s;&s;ed; a general pardon was pa&s;&s;ed for all tre&s;pa&s;&s;es in fore&s;ts; and the commons granted a $ub&s;idy for three years on wool, wool|fells, and leather. The &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up on the thirteenth day of November, the anniver&s;$ry of the king's birth, on which occa&s;ion he created his &s;on Lio|nel, duke of Clarence; John of Ghent, duke of Lanca&s;ter; and Edmund, earl of Cambridge. Another parliament was called after Michaelmas for the redre&s;s of grievances; and &s;ome new regulations were pa&s;&s;$d in the form of an ord$nance, which was a temporary provi&s;ion, by way of experiment, be|$ore<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$.

<P>At this period, Peter de Lu&s;ignan king of Cyprus vi$ited the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed courts of Europe, with a view to $ngage the Chri&s;tian princes in a cru&s;ade again&s;t the Turks, who now began to be $ormidable in Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia; and he propo&s;ed the recovery of the Holy Land from the hands of the Sara|cens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ Ch. 13$3.</NOTE> w$o had been lately weakened and di&s;pirited by a dreadful pe&s;tilence. Philip de Valois had formerly made a vow to engage in &s;uch a cru&s;ade, and his &s;on John a&s;cribed all the &s;ub&s;equ$nt misfortunes of France to his father's non-performance of this engagement. He therefore re&s;olved to attone for this omi&s;&s;ion; a$d repairing to Av$gnon took upon him the cro&s;s, when his exam|ple was followed by Waldemar $ing of Denmark. Pope Urban extolled the re&s;olution of John, whom he forthwith declared general of all the Chri&s;tian armies engaged in the cru&s;ade; and that prince fixed the fir&s;t day of March, at the d$&s;tance of two years, for the rendezvous of his for$es, in order to embark in the expedition.

<P>The execution of the treaty of Bretigny was &s;till retarded by tho&s;e who were unwilling to evacuate the places that were ceded to the king of England; &s;o that John's two &s;ons the duke of Anjou and Berry, together with his brother the duke of Orleans, who were left as ho&s;tages in the power of Edward, began to be tired of their re&s;idence in England; and gave the king to under&s;tand that they might be &s;erviceable in removing the difficulties, if they could be conveyed to Calais, where they would be nearer the &s;cene of negotiation. They were accordingly carried thither, and allowed to ride about the country for &s;everal days together, either for bu&s;ine&s;s or diver&s;ion; but, their endeavours proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, the duke of Anjou abu&s;ed his pa|role, and made his e&s;cape into the dominions of his father, who chid him &s;e|verely for his di&s;honourable behaviour. In order to make an atonement for the fault of his &s;on, he re&s;olved to go to England in per&s;on, and, in a confe|rence with Edward, endeavour to level the ob&s;tructions that prevented the execution of the treaty. When his mini&s;ters endeavoured to divert him from this re&s;olution, he told them, that though good faith were bani&s;hed out of the re&s;t of the world, it ought to be found in the words of princes; and, that as the execution of the treaty was the condition of his ran&s;om, he was determined to &s;ee the articles punctually performed. He accordingly arrived in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1364.</NOTE> during the Chri&s;tmas holidays, when he met with a very cordial reception; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rainald. Du Tillet. Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE> the kings of Cyprus and Scotland chancing to be there at the &s;ame time, the court of Edward &s;hone with uncommon magnificence. David Bruce had found it impracticable to rai&s;e the money for his relea&s;e in Scotland, and, be|fore the treaty of Bretigny, had entered into a negotiation with the regent and council of France, who promi&s;ed to advance fifty thou&s;and marks towards the di&s;charge of his ran&s;om, if he would heartily engage in the intere&s;t of that kingdom, and make a powerful diver&s;ion in England. A treaty for this purpo&s;e was concluded; but &s;uch was the exhau&s;ted &s;ituation of France, that the regent could not perform his promi&s;e, and David Bruce found him&s;elf utterly unable to execute the treaty of Berwick, by virtue of which he had been &s;et at liberty. Edward, who knew his di&s;tre&s;s, re&s;olved to turn it to his own advantage; the queen of Scotland had died without i&s;&s;ue, and David taking another wife, who likewi$e proved barren, the king of England of|fered to remit the ran&s;om, provided he would &s;ettle the crown upon the royal family of England, in ca&s;e he him&s;elf &s;hould die without children. David, in order to gain time, &s;eemed to reli&s;h the propo&s;al, and even communicated it to the Scotti&s;h parliament, by whom it was rejected with indignation. Ed|ward, notwith&s;tanding this repul&s;e, would not re&s;ign his project, e&s;pecially as it &s;eemed agreeable to David; and, in order to reconcile the Scots to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, propo&s;ed a federal union of the two nations, on terms &s;o honoura|ble and advantageous to the Scots, that nothing but the keene&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t Edward, who had intai$ed &s;uch mi&s;eries on their country, could have prompted them to a &s;econd refu&s;al. This negotiation mi&s;carrying, David Bruce repaired to the court of England, in hope of prevailing upon Edward to mitigate the ran&s;om; and though he failed in his endeavours, he and the

French king were royally entertained with fea&s;ts, ju&s;ts, and hunting-matches, till the beginning of April, when John &s;ickened and died in the palace of the Savoy in London.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of the preceding year he had determined a di&s;pute, about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Burgundy, in favour of his own &s;on Philip, &s;urnamed the Hardy, who was inve$ted with the dukedom, and the title of Fir&s;t Peer of France, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of the king of Navarre, who was certainly next heir to the late duke Philip de Rouvre. As &s;oon as Charles V. &s;ucceeded to the crown of France, he confirmed the deci&s;ion of his father; and the king of Navarre, con&s;idering John's death as a favourable opportu|nity to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice, declared war again&s;t his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Ho&s;tilities were immediately begun on both &s;ides; and the famous Bertrand du Gue&s;clin, who had &s;ignalized his valour in the &s;ervice of Charles de Blois, was now employed to oppo&s;e the Navarrois in Normandy. He accordingly &s;urpri&s;ed Mante and Meulant, and opened a free communication between Paris and Rouen; and the king of Navarre matched this enterpri&s;ing officer with his kin&s;man John de Gre$lly, Captal de Buche, who had acquired great reputation in the &s;ervice of England. He was not however furni&s;hed wit$ a &s;ufficient number of troops to undertake any enterprize of importance, and in the cour&s;e of the campaign, had the misfortune to be routed and taken pri&s;oner at Cocherel, after a very bloody di&s;pute with Bertrand, who was immediately after this battle &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Charles de Blois in Brittany. The di&s;pute between this no|bleman and John de Montfort &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, notwith&s;tanding the endeavours of Edward, who propo&s;ed a partition of the dutchy: and the truce, which had been prolonged from time to time, being now expired, Montfort took the field and inve&s;ted Auray; and Charles being joined by Gue&s;clin, the counts of Auxerre and Joigny, and &s;everal other barons of France with their va&s;&s;als, re&s;olved to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and terminate the competition by one deci&s;ive bat|tle. John, being informed of his competitor's preparations, &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of John de Chandos con&s;table of Guienne, who &s;uccoured him in per&s;on with a &s;mall body of Engli&s;h men at arms and archers, including a good number of brave knights, who had come from England on purpo&s;e to &s;ignalize them&s;elves under the command of &s;uch a gallant officer. Charles, advancing to Vannes, drew up his army in order of battle, and marched to|wards Auray again&s;t his enemy, who was po&s;ted on a plain behind the ca&s;tle. Gue&s;clin commanded the right wing; the counts of Auxerre and Joigny were &s;tationed on the left; and the center was commanded by Charles de B$ois. The di&s;po&s;ition of Montfort's army being left to the lord Chandos, he po&s;ted Sir Robert Knolles oppo&s;ite to Gue&s;clin; Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on oppo&s;ed the count of Auxerre; he him&s;elf and the count de Montfort commanded the main body; and Sir Hugh de Calverly directed the corps de re&s;erve. The whole line of each army engaged at the &s;ame in&s;tant; and Charles de Blois attacked with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that Montfort's &s;tandard was beaten down, and his main body obliged to give way. Calverly immediately advanced from the rear, and kept Charles in play, until the center rallied and returned to its former &s;tation; and then he retired to his po&s;t, according to the directions he had re|ceived from Chandos. Mean while the count of Auxerre being wounded in the eye and taken pri&s;oner, his men were di&s;couraged and began to fall back;
<PB N="91" REF="930">
Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on, taking advantage of their di&s;order, charged them with re|doubled vigour, and &s;oon routed them with great &s;laughter. Calverly, ob&s;erv|ing the enemy's main body left naked by the flight of this wing, advanced through a field of broom, and attacked them in flank with &s;uch fury, that they were immediately broken and di&s;per&s;ed, after Charles had been run thro' the mouth, and left dead upon the &s;pot. Gue&s;clin &s;till kept his ground, and fought with his u&s;ual prowe&s;s, till being grievou&s;ly wounded, and environed on all hands, he was forced to yield him&s;elf pri&s;oner to the lord Chandos, who thus obtained a complete victory, which in a manner extingui&s;hed the compe|tition. Next day the ca&s;tle of Auray &s;urrendered, in con&s;equence of a capitu|lation<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1365.</NOTE> to which the garri&s;on had agreed before the battle, which was attended with the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Vannes and &s;everal other important places. Great part of the noble&s;&s;e of Bretagne, who had e&s;pou&s;ed the claim of Charles, looking upon the cau&s;e as de&s;perate, came over to that of Montfort. This nobleman now advanced to the higher Brittany, and having reduced the town of Iugon, undertook the &s;iege of Dinan, which held out during the greate&s;t part of win|ter, in hope of being &s;uccoured by the duke of Anjou, but was at length obliged to &s;urrender. Then he inve&s;ted Quimper Corentin, and ravaged the adjacent country. The widow of Charles, who&s;e &s;ons were &s;till pri&s;oners in England, finding her&s;elf unable to &s;top his progre&s;s, had recour&s;e to the king of France for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. That prince being re&s;tricted by the treaty of Bretigny from intere&s;ting him&s;elf in her quarrel, and at the &s;ame time afraid of lo&s;ing the &s;overeignty of Bretagne, &s;hould it be conquered by Montfort, propo&s;ed that he &s;hould make an honourable provi&s;ion for the widow of his competitor; and in that ca&s;e he might po&s;&s;e&s;s the dutchy in quiet, and hold it by homage of the crown of France. Montfort, with the con&s;ent of his father-in-law the king of England, clo&s;ed with this propo&s;al, and peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed at Guerande, on condition, That in ca&s;e of Montfort's dying without legiti|ma$$ i&s;&s;ue, the dutchy &s;hould de&s;cend to John elde&s;t &s;on of Charles de Blois:<NOTE PLACE="marg">D'Argentr&eacute;'s Hi&s;t. de Bre|tagne.

In con&s;equence of this treaty, all the places which had hitherto held out for the family of Charles, were delivered to John de Montfort, who remained in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Brittany. By the mediation of the Captal de Buche, while he remained a pri&s;oner, an accommodation was effected between the kings of France and Navarre, which la&s;t received an equivalent for Mante and Meulant; and the pri&s;oners on both &s;ides were &s;et at liberty.</P>

<P>France being now more than ever harra&s;&s;ed by the freebooting companies, who had returned from Italy, and were joined by va&s;t numbers of licentious banditti, Charles V. de&s;ired the king of England to exert his au|thority again&s;t them, as their leaders were chierly Engli&s;h and Ga&s;cons; and it h$d be$n &s;tipulated in the treaty of Bretigny, that in ca&s;e of their proving re$rac$ory, both crowns &s;hould unite their endeavou$s to reduce them by force of arms. Edward had, by repeated proclamations, ordered all his &s;ubjects to quit that infamous &s;ociety, and leave the kingdom of France; but few of the banditti obeying his order, he re&s;olved to march again&s;t them in per&s;on. Charles, alarmed at his preparations, now intreated him to de&s;i&s;t: and this in&s;tance of low &s;u&s;picion provoked the king of England &s;o much, that he &s;wore he would never &s;tir towards his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, even though the companies &s;hould attempt to drive him out of his kingdom. By this time they amounted to forty thou&s;and hardy veterans, who filled all the continent with alarm and con&s;ternation. The pope had at fir&s;t excommunicated the whole body; but afterwards he attemp$ed to &s;oothe them with a promi&s;e of pardon and ab$o$ution. Large appointments were offered to them, and a free pa&s;&s;age t$rough the empire and Hungary, if they would engage in a cru&s;ade again&s;t the Tu$ks, who had lately made terrible irruptions into Europe: but they did not chu&s;e to go &s;o far abroad, while France afforded them plenty of &s;ub|&s;i$t$nce and plunder; though at length they were allured into Spain by the civil wars which broke out in that country.</P>

<P>Pedro king of Ca&s;tile, &s;urnamed The Cruel, among other acts of de$$oti&s;m and barbarity, had put to death three natural &s;ons of $is father Al|phon&s;o XI. and the three that &s;urvived, namely Henry count of Tra&s;tamare, Tello count of Sancelloni, and Sancho, apprehen&s;ive of the &s;ame fate, fled for re$$ge into Arragon, whither they were pur&s;ued by Pedro, at the head of an army, with which he reduced &s;everal towns and ca&s;tles in that kingdom: $o that his brothers, thinking them&s;elves un&s;a$e in Arragon, fled into France, where they were protected by Charles, who was incen&s;ed agai$$t Pedro for $aving poi&s;oned his wife Blanche de Bourbon, &s;$&s;ter to the queen of France. This inhuman Ca&s;tilian no &s;ooner under&s;tood that his brothers had retired to Paris, than he cau&s;ed their mother Leonora de Gu&s;man to be put to death, them&s;$lves to be proclaimed traitors, and their e&s;tates to be con|$i$$ated. He had incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of his holine&s;s by &s;eizing church|lands, i$pri&s;oning the clergy, and breaking the truce with the king of Arra|g$$. The pope had cited him to an&s;wer for his crimes by proxy; but he ridicul$d the citation, and abu&s;ed the me&s;&s;eng$rs; and for the&s;e rea&s;ons was ex$o$municated in the Roman con&s;i&s;tory. Urban not yet &s;atisfied with this ve$gea$ce, w$ich ind$ed the other did not feel, invited the king of Arragon, and Hen$y count of Tra&s;tamare, to a conference at Avignon, where it was r$$$$ved that the pope &s;hould de$ounce a &s;entence of d$po$ition again&s;t Pedro, and d$clare H$nry legitimate, and capable of inheriting the kingdom of Ca&s;|tile, as i$ he had been the only &s;on o$ the late king Alphon&s;o.

than the freebooting companies enli&s;ted in his &s;ervice by the means of Ber|trand du Gue&s;clin, whom the king of France employed for that purpo&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art. Hi&s;t. de Du Gue&s;clin.</NOTE> This renowned warrior repairing to their head-quarters near Chalons &s;ur Saone, per&s;uaded Sir Hugh de Calverly, the &s;ame who had fought &s;o gallantly at the battle of Auray, Sir Matthew Gournay, and the re&s;t of the chie$tains, to engage in this enterprize, for a valuable con&s;ideration to be payed by the pope and the king of France; provided that his holine&s;s would ab&s;olve them from the cen&s;ures they had incurred; that Du Gue&s;clin &s;hould be their commander; and that they &s;hould not be de&s;ired to &s;erve again&s;t the prince of Wales. The&s;e articles were confirmed in a &s;olemn treaty, by which they obliged them|&s;elves to &s;urrender to the king of France all the fortre&s;&s;es they held in his dominions. Then they took the field; and, being joined by great numbers of the French noble&s;&s;e, who were ambitious of &s;erving under the celebrated Du Gue&s;clin, that general &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men. The money &s;tipulated by France was punctually paid; but, the pope delaying the payment of what he had promi&s;ed, Du Gue&s;clin directed his march to Avignon, and demanded it in &s;uch a &s;train, that his holine&s;s being &s;eized with con&s;ternation, rai&s;ed one hundred thou&s;and livres by a capitation on the inhabitants. This &s;um, however, the general obliged them to re&s;tore to the people from whom it had been exacted; and then extorted two hundred thou&s;and florins from the pockets of the pontiff and his cardinals. All the &s;oldiers of this army wore long white cro&s;&s;es on their habits, as if they had engaged in a cru&s;ade; and it was given out that they were on their march again&s;t the Moors of Grenada. But the king of Ca&s;tile was not deceived by that pretence. He knew their de&s;tination; recalled his troops from Arragon, and endeavoured to rai&s;e an army &s;ufficient to cope with the invaders. But he was &s;o hated by his &s;ubjects, that few or none appeared at the rendezvous; and the greate&s;t part of his forces de&s;erted in their return from Arragon. In a word, he found him&s;elf totally abandoned; and the defection was &s;o &s;udden, that he &s;carce had time to &s;ecure him&s;elf and his family, with his trea&s;ure, at Corunna, from whence he fled with his three daughters into Ga&s;cony: while Henry a&s;&s;umed the title of king, and was acknowledged as &s;uch by all the cities and nobility of the kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE></P>

<P>Had the prince of Wales granted an a&s;ylum to this tyrant in his di&s;tre&s;s, his humanity might have been excu&s;ed, and perhaps commended: but &s;urely, his engaging to re&s;tore &s;uch a mon&s;ter of cruelty and inju&s;tice to the throne from which he had been &s;o ju&s;tly expelled, was an indelible &s;tain in that character which had &s;o long &s;hone with unrivalled lu&s;tre. Cruelty, indeed, was a vice, of which the greate&s;t characters of that age cannot be wholly acquitted; witne&s;s the carnage, conflagrations, famine, pe&s;tilence, and ruin, that attended both tho&s;e illu&s;trious Edwards in all their warlike ex|peditions. Notwith&s;tanding that blaze of glory by which their memories are &s;urrounded, the candid and judicious ob&s;erver will perceive that they were not the friends and $athers, but the de&s;troyers, of the human race. The prince's &s;$heme in favour of Pedro is not even free from the &s;u&s;picion of intere&s;ted motives. The Ca&s;tilian monarch gratified him befor$hand for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by conveying to him the dominions of Bi&s;cay, Ca&s;tro de Ordoales, Bilboa$ and all the intermediate countries, in a formal treaty, &s;igned and ratified at

Libou$$e. The king of $word$ not only approved of this expedition, but even contributed towards the expence, by con&s;igning to his &s;on one hundred and twenty thou&s;and crowns, to be payed by the king of France, as part of his father's ran&s;om. The prince of Wales rai&s;ed all the money he could borrow, and melted down his plate for the &s;ervice; $nd Pedro &s;atisfied the Ga&s;con nobility with promi&s;es of large &s;ums for the levy-money, and pay of their forces. As they could not pretend to enter Ca&s;tile, while the kings of Arra|gon and Navarre adhered to the intere&s;t of Henry de Tra&s;tamare, amba&s;&s;a|dors were &s;ent to tamper with Charles, who con&s;ented to a conference with Don Pedro and the prince of Wales at Bayonne; where, in con&s;ideration of a large &s;ub&s;idy, and the ce&s;&s;ion of Guipu&s;coa, Vittoria, Alava, Logrogno, Guduzen, Calahorra, and Alfaro, he not only renounced his engagements with Henry, but undertook to a&s;&s;i&s;t Pedro with a body of forces, and grant<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> him a free pa&s;&s;age through his dominions. While Don Pedro was employed in the&s;e mea&s;ures for recovering his crown, Henry took all po&s;&s;ible precau|tions to maintain his acqui&s;ition. He was no &s;ooner elevated to the throne of Ca&s;tile, than he be&s;towed great large&s;&s;es on the freebooting companies, to which he had in a grea$ mea&s;ure owed his &s;ucce&s;s; and he won the hearts of his &s;ubjects by acts of munificence, from which he acquired the epithet of Liberal. He had immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the French forces, but retained the companies, upon who&s;e valour he chiefly depended. He thought he had at|tached them to his intere&s;t by his liberality; but he found him&s;elf egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken. They were lawle&s;s ru$$ians whom no obligations could bind, and no principle govern. The greate&s;t part of them had &s;erved under the prince of Wales, and were in fact the &s;ubjects of his father. They knew his tal$nts, admired his courage, and dreaded the thoughts of &s;erving again&s;t a leader of &s;uch con&s;ummate capacity; for, in &s;o doing, they not only ran the ri&s;k of being vanqui&s;hed, but al&s;o of being executed as traitors. Edward, by his emi&s;&s;aries, gave them to under&s;tand, that he had occa&s;ion for their &s;ervice, and de&s;ired they would meet him at Guienne; and tho&s;e who received the in|timation, forthwith demanded their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Henry, who had no &s;u&s;picion of their de&s;ign. Twelve thou&s;and immediately began their march to the frontiers of Ga&s;cony; and the re&s;t, who were di&s;per&s;ed in quarters over the country, no &s;ooner heard of the prince's invitation, than they a&s;&s;embled in order to follow their companions. Gue&s;$lin being con&s;ulted by Henry on this emergency, advi&s;ed him to &s;ollicit the king of Arragon to block up the pa&s;&s;es of his country, in order to prevent their return; and he him&s;elf offered to bring a body of auxiliaries from France. The companies being thus inter|$epted, cho&s;e another route; and, after having endured infinite hard&s;hips, arrived on the frontiers of Foix, which the count would not allow them to pa&s;s, left they &s;hould ravage the country. But this ob&s;truction was ea&s;ily re|moved by the a&s;&s;urances of John de Chandos, who went thither, and enli&s;ted them in the prince's &s;ervice. Then they were divided into &s;everal bodies, and took different routes, by which they arrived at Bourdeaux, after one of the divi&s;ions had fought and gained a battle again&s;t a body of French forces, who attacked them at Montauban in Quercy.</P>

which, when added to his other Engli&s;h and Ga&s;con forces, compo&s;ed a for|midable army, he began his march about the latter end of February; and, pa&s;&s;ing the Pyrenees in three divi&s;ions, con&s;i&s;ting each of ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, that marched within a day's di&s;tance of one another, arrived in &s;afety at Pampeluna, where he was abundantly &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries by the king of Navarre. From thence he advanced to Salvaterra, a town on the frontiers of Ca&s;tile, the inhabitants of which &s;ubmitted without re&s;i&s;tance. Neverthele&s;s, Pedro de&s;ired they might be all put to the &s;word, as a terror to other rebels who adhered to the u&s;urper: but Edward di&s;appointed his brutal revenge, by repre&s;enting that the ma&s;&s;acre of tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted, would drive the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects to de&s;pair. From this place they proceeded to Vittoria, re&s;olving to pa&s;s the Ebro at the bridge of Logrogno, and take po&s;t at Navarel. Mean while Don Henry had a&s;&s;embled ten thou&s;and Ca&s;tilian men at arms, well mounted on barbed hor&s;es; be&s;ides twenty thou&s;and com|mon hor&s;emen on genets, armed cap-a$pee; ten thou&s;and cro&s;s-bows, and &s;ix times that number of infantry. With the&s;e he advanced to San Miguel, where he was joined by Bertrand du Gue&s;clin, with four thou&s;and men at arms, which he had rai&s;ed in Brittany, France, and Arragon. Confiding in &s;uch a numerous army of well-appointed &s;oldiers, Henry neglected the advice of the marechal de Andrehan, who propo&s;ed he &s;hould guard the pa&s;&s;age of the Ebro, and ruin the Engli&s;h by cutting off their convoys of provi&s;ion. He had already &s;ent an herald to Pampeluna, to a&s;&s;ure the prince of Wales, that he would fight him as &s;oon as he entered Ca&s;tile: and Edward, having detained the me&s;&s;enger until he had cro&s;&s;ed the Ebro, retorted his defiance; though, at the &s;ame time, he propo&s;ed terms of accommodation, which Henry rejected with di&s;dain, advancing towards Najara, in order to give him battle. Edward, on the third day of April, marched towards the enemy, in the following order: The van was conducted by the duke of Lanca&s;ter and John de Chandos; the prince him&s;elf commanded in the centre; and the rear was brought up by James king of Majorca, attended by Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on, the Captal de Buche, the lords of Armagnac and Albret, with other noble|men of Ga&s;cony. The right wing of the Spaniards was commanded by Ber|trand du Gue&s;clin, and the marechal de Andrehan at the head of the foreign men at arms; the count of Sancelloni was po&s;ted on the left, with his brother Sancho; and the main body was directed by Don Henry in per&s;on. Edward having ob&s;erved their order from a hill which lay between him and the enemy, commanded the duke of Lanca&s;ter and John de Chandos to di&s;mount their hor&s;emen, and attack the right of the Spaniards under Gue&s;clin, whom they accordingly charged with great impetuo&s;ity, at the head of the freebooting companies: but they met with &s;uch a warm reception, that the di&s;pute con|tinued a long time with dubious &s;ucce&s;s. Mean while the prince attacked on the right; and, at the fir&s;t on&s;et, broke the wing commanded by the count of Sancelloni, who in&s;tantly fled with two thou&s;and lances. The prince, leaving the king of Majorca to fini&s;h the route, wheeled about, and fell upon the main body of the enemy, commanded by Henry, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf by very extraordinary acts of valour: though the prince of Wales pene|trated through his battalia three times, he as often rallied it by the help of a body of re&s;erve mounted on genets; nor did he give ground, until the duke

of La$ca&s;$er and Chandos having with great difficulty defeated their right wing, and taken Du Gue&s;clin with the marechal de Andrehan, advanced to join the prince of Wales and the king of Majorca. Then the Spaniards$ on the apprehen&s;ion of being &s;urro$nded and cut in pieces, gave way on $ll hands; and Don Henry quitting the fie$d, retired to Calahorra$ from whence he e&s;caped into Arragon. The victors pur&s;uing the $ugitives to the bridge of Najara, made a terrible &s;laughter: above five thou&s;and gentlemen were found dead upon the fi$ld of battle; and the grand prior o$ the order o$ St. Jago, with the great ma&s;ter of Calatrava, and two thou&s;and Fre$ch and Sp$ni&s;h<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ K$$gh$on.

<P>All the pri&s;oners would have been put to death, had not the prince of Wales interceded warmly in their behalf with Pedro, who was pre|va$led upon to be reconciled with them, on their receiving the oath of a$$e|giance; and to publi&s;h a general amne&s;ty to all his &s;ubjects. He then &s;et out for Burgos, the capital of Old Ca&s;tile, with a guard of five hundred men at arms, commanded by Sir Guichard d'Angle; and was fo$lowed by the prince at the head of the army. There they kept Ea&s;ter with great &s;olemnity; and Pedro received deputies from all the con&s;iderable cities of Ca&s;tile, with tenders of &s;ervice, and a&s;&s;urances of loyalty. The prince now reminded Pedro of the money due to the troops, which he de&s;ired him to pay, that they might return, without being any longer a burthen to the country. The Ca&s;tilian pleaded inability; but propo&s;ed that Edward &s;hould &s;tay with his forces in the neighbourhood of Valladolid, until he could rai&s;e the money at Seville, to which city he repaired, &s;olemnly prote&s;ting that the troops &s;hould be &s;atisfied before Whit&s;untide. Edward having re&s;ided in that city till Mid|&s;ummer, received nothing but trifling excu&s;es, which plainly &s;hewed that Pedro had no intention to fulfil his engagements; and indeed his ingratitude was a ju&s;t judgment upon the prince of Wales for having undertaken the cau&s;e of &s;uch a ruffian. The heats of Spain becoming exce&s;&s;ive, and the troops be|ginning to &s;icken, Edward marched to Agreda, on the borders of Arragon, and made an agreement with the king of that country for the pa&s;&s;age of the freebooting companies; while he him&s;elf, with the re&s;t of his forces, took the route of Navarre, through which he returned to Bourdeaux, where he was re|ceived in triumph amid&s;t the acclamations of the people.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1368.</NOTE> This &s;ea&s;on of rejoicing was not of long duration in Guienne. The prince's glory was &s;o acceptable to the Engli&s;h nation, that the parlia|ment which met in May granted a large &s;ub&s;idy to the king, who explained to both hou&s;es the nature of a treaty, which had been long in negotiation with the king of Scotland. That prince offered to maintain a perpetual peace with England, provided Edward would renounce, for him&s;elf and his heirs, all title to the &s;uperiority of his kingdom: but the lords and commons de|clared, that they could not con&s;ent to &s;uch a peace without di&s;heri&s;on of the king, and his rights, which they were bound by &s;olemn oath to maintain to the utmo&s;t of their power. The king had &s;ent for the prince of Wales from Guienne; but by this time the di&s;contents which began to appear in that country, prevented his departure. His finances were exhau&s;ted by the late expedition; and Pedro's breach of faith reduced him to great difficulties.
<PB N="97" REF="990">
Six thou&s;and of the freebooters, who returned to Guienne, lived at free quarter, becau&s;e Edward could not pay their arrears; and the inhabitants complaining of the injuries they daily &s;u&s;tained from tho&s;e licen&s;ed robbers, the prince ordered them to quit the country. They had &s;uch per&s;onal regard for Edward, that they obeyed his command; and, pa&s;&s;ing the Loire, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed their head-quarters in Champagne: but, even after their departure, there was &s;o much pay due to the re&s;t of the troops, that he could find no other method of di&s;charging the debt, but that of rai&s;ing a tax upon chim|neys; which was extremely di&s;agreeable to the inhabitants, and violently oppo&s;ed by the count of Armagnac, the lord of Albret, who had lately mar|ried Margaret &s;i&s;ter to the queen of France, and other great barons of Ga&s;|cony, who loudly declared it an innovation to which they would not &s;ubmit.

Burgos, Valladolid, Leon, and A&s;torga, admitted him without he&s;itation. He was joined by a great number of the nobility, with their va&s;&s;als and adherents; and met with no oppo&s;ition, until he arrived in the neighbourhood of Toledo, which, refu&s;ing him admittance, he re|&s;olved to be&s;iege it in form. Pedro, who re&s;ided in Seville, began to a&s;&s;emble an army to oppo&s;e his competitor; but very few of his own &s;ubjects repaired to his &s;tandard. Neverthele&s;s, the kings of Grenada and Treme&s;in furni&s;hed him with twenty thou&s;and Moors; and his kin&s;man Ferdinand king of Por|tugal &s;ent a body of forces to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He expected a rein$orcement of &s;ix thou&s;and freebooters, under Sir Hugh Calverly; but, without waiting for their arrival, he began his march from Seville, at the head of forty thou&s;and men, to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Toledo. Bertrand du Gue&s;clin, who had by this time joined Henry with two thou&s;and men at arms, advi&s;ed that prince to abandon the &s;iege, and &s;urprize Pedro on his march.

prejudice of the natives. They affirmed, that &s;hould war be once actually dec$ar$d the whole dutchy would ri&s;e in favour of Charles. They undertook to main$ain the war at their own expence; and promi&s;ed to the king of France, that they wo$ld live and die in his quarrel. Though Charles was not a prince of a very mar$ial di&s;po&s;ition, he longed for an opportunity to recover the terri|tories in Guienne, which had been alienated from his crown in the late peace, as well as to a&s;$ert his &s;overeignty over the whole dutchy; yet he was aver&s;e to engage in a wa$ whi$h he fore&s;aw mu&s;t be attended with great dan|ger and exp$$ce. While he thus fluctuated between fear and ambition, the Ga&s;con noblemen were amu&s;ed with undetermined promi&s;es and rich pre&s;ents, and allowed to &s;ummon the prince of Wales, in his name, before the court of peers, to an&s;wer their complaints. Edward, provoked at this citation, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Charles, importing that he was ready to &s;et out for Paris, at his in|vitation, with &s;ixty thou&s;and men in his retinue. The French king at la&s;t re|&s;olved to break with England, encouraged by the declining age of old Ed|ward, and the lingering di&s;temper which attacked the prince of Wales in his la&s;t expedition, and was generally deemed incurable. Charles began to make preparations in private, and re&s;olving to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of Ponthieu before he &s;hould declare war again&s;t England, tampered with the citizens of Abbe|ville and the noble&s;&s;e of that country, whom he gained over to his intere&s;t. At the &s;ame time he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors into England, with a&s;&s;urances of his pa|c$fic di&s;po&s;ition, and certain overtures for an improvement and fre&s;h confirma|tion of the la&s;t treaty. The&s;e deputies found no difficulty in per&s;uading Ed|ward of their ma&s;ter's &s;incerity; and, in their return to France, met a me&s;&s;enger at Dover, di&s;patched by Charles with an in&s;ulting defiance to the king of Eng|land.

<P>The king of England under&s;tanding that Guienne was al&s;o in|vad$d, Scotland $o$licited to $all upon the northern counties, and a fleet pre|paring for a de&s;cent upon the &s;outhern coa&s;t of England, a&s;&s;embled a parlia|ment in June; and $fter having explained the unju&s;t$fiable conduct of Charles, de&s;ired the a$$h$$&s;hops and prelates to con&s;ider whether he might not rea&s;&s;ume the tit$e and ar$$ of France, re&s;igned in con&s;equence of a treaty which his enemies h$d &s;o $hamef$lly violated.

&s;o unju&s;tly kindled. The dukes of Anjou and Berry, reinforced by the free|booters on the Loire, whom Charles had engaged in his intere&s;t, fell into Guienne on different quarters, and were joined by all the nobility of the province; while Sir Hugh Calverly returning from Spain, with &s;ix thou&s;and of the &s;ame companies, enli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of the prince of Wales. The earls of Cambridge and Pembroke, arriving about the &s;ame time from England, with a reinforcement, were detached into Perigort, where they took Bourdailles by &s;tratagem; and John de Chandos and Guichard d' Angle were &s;ent to Montauban to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the duke of Anjou. The war was carried on in &s;light &s;kirmi&s;hes with various &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;everal places &s;urpri&s;ed on both &s;ides. Among the&s;e, the ca&s;tle of Belle-Perche in the Bourbonnois was taken by the freebooters in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, who found in the place the lady I&s;abella, mother to the queen of France, and to the duke of Bourbon. She was honourably entertained in her own ca&s;tle till next year, when her &s;on at the head of a numerous army inve&s;ted the place, and mu&s;t have reduced it accordingly, had not the earls of Cambridge and Pembroke marched to its relief. The&s;e noblemen challenged the duke of Bour|bon to battle; and, he declining the invitation, they carried off his mother and the garri&s;on at noon-day, without his attempting to re&s;cue her from the hands of her enemies. She was afterwards exchanged for Simon de Burley, one of the chief commanders of the freebooters, who had been &s;urpri&s;ed and taken in an engagement between Mirebeau and Lu&s;ignan. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE></P>

Mean while John of Ghent duke of Lanca&s;ter, landing at Calais with a body of forces, marched directly to Harfleur in Nor|mandy, with a view to burn the &s;hips a&s;&s;embled in that harbour to tran&s;port an army of French into England; but the duke's de&s;ign was defeated by the count of St. Pol, who threw him&s;elf into the place with a &s;trong reinforce|ment: &s;o that John de&s;i&s;ted from the enterprize; and having ravaged great part of Picardy, returned to Calais. The king of England, thinking it high time to &s;trengthen his intere&s;t with foreign alliances, concluded a league with the dukes of Juliers and Gueldres, and Charles king of Navarre, which la&s;t however was in the &s;equel debauched by the offers of Charles.

<P>About Mid&s;ummer Sir Robert Knolles marched from Calais, at the head of a con&s;iderable army, and pa&s;&s;ing by Arras, ravaged Picardy without oppo&s;ition: though he was attended by a flying army of French, who had orders to watch his motions, and harra&s;s him in his march without hazarding an engagement. For this rea&s;on, Knolles was obliged to proceed with great circum&s;pection; &s;o that the country did not &s;uffer much from his &s;traggling parties. He did not attempt any town of con&s;equence; but, after having tra|ver&s;ed
<PB N="101" REF="1030">
the Vermandois, Champagne, and Brie, where he rai&s;ed &s;ome contribu|tions, he arrived in the neighbourhood of Paris, and burned the adjacent vil|lages, in hope of provoking the French to a battle. Charles had a &s;trong body of forces within the city, and his nobility were eager to engage the Engli&s;h; but the king repre&s;&s;ed their vivacity, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to hazard a battle, becau&s;e he $ore&s;aw that the Engli&s;h would not undertake the &s;iege, and could not remain much longer in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, without being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by want of provi&s;ion. Knolles accordingly retired by the way of Montlehery, and having ravaged Beauce and the Gatinois, marched into Le Maine, with de&s;ign to take up his winter-quarters on the frontiers of Brittany. This &s;cheme was oppo&s;ed by Thomas lord Grandi&s;on, Walter Fitzwalter, and other young no|blemen, who payed very little regard to the command or directions of Knolles, becau&s;e he had been a chieftain among the freebootets. Their contempt of this leader was encouraged and augmented by the in&s;inuations of Sir John Min|&s;treworth, whom Knolles had promoted to a con&s;iderable command in the army: but having embezzled large &s;ums de&s;igned for the pay of the &s;oldiers, he endeavoured to ruin his benefactor, that he might have a chance of e&s;caping without being called to account for his fraudulent practices. By the in&s;tiga|tions of this incendiary, tho&s;e young adventurers refu&s;ed to accompany Knolles into Brittany, but &s;eparating from him with their forces, e&s;tabli&s;hed their quarters in Anjou and Touraine. Bertrand du Gue&s;clin being about this time creat$d con&s;table of France, and re&s;olving to begin his office with &s;ome &s;ignal exploit, a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, and advanced to Caen in Normandy, where being joined by the troops of that province, commanded by the marechal de Blain|ville, he directed his march towards Le Maine, where a con&s;iderable body of the Engli&s;h was quartered. Knolles hearing of his intention, &s;ent orders to all his troops to re-unite, in order to give the enemy battle; and among the re&s;t, the lords Grandi&s;on, Fitzwalter, and Min&s;treworth, ha&s;tened towards him, that they might have a &s;hare of the engagement. Gue&s;clin having received in|telligence of their march, &s;urprized them, about the latter end of November, near Pont de Valaines, on the borders of Le Maine; and though they made a gallant re&s;i&s;tance, they were overpowered by numbers, and routed, four thou&s;and of their men being either killed or taken, and Grandi&s;on him&s;elf fall|ing into the hands of the enemy. Min&s;treworth, who was &s;u&s;pected of having given intelligence to the con&s;table, made his e&s;cape, and returning to England blamed Knolles for the di&s;a&s;ter: but that officer's character was afterwards vin|dicated by Sir Allan Boxhull, who had &s;erved in this expedition, &s;o much to the &s;atisfaction of his maje&s;ty, that Min&s;treworth was &s;ummoned before the king and council, to vindicate his own behaviour. Rather than &s;tand trial, he fled the kingdom and revolted to the enemy: then he was outlawed, and being taken in the &s;equel, &s;uffered death as a traytor. After the action at Pont de Valaines, Knolles provided for the defence of S. Sauveur le Vi$omte, and re|tired into Brittany, while the con&s;table di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his forces, and returned to Paris.</P>

were greatly extended: and indeed the Engli&s;h intere&s;t decayed apace in this country, notwith&s;tanding the vigilance of John duke of Lanca&s;ter, who re|duced the fortre&s;s of Montpaon, and made the garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war; then took by a&s;&s;ault the &s;trong town and ca&s;tle of Mont-contour, in the Marches of Poitou, and put all the garri&s;on to the &s;word. The&s;e were the only con&s;ider|able actions that di&s;tingui&s;hed this year in Guienne: but the French king had $o intention to confine his operations to that province. He had meditated a de&s;cent upon England, and made great preparations for that expedition; and Edward notifying this de&s;ign to his parliament, which met in February at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the lords and commons granted an aid of fifty thou&s;and pounds, to provide for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom. This tax was levied at &s;o much for every pari&s;h in England; and the convocations of Canterbury and York<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer. Rot Pa$l.</NOTE> made a grant of the $ame &s;um for the public &s;ervice. As the great offices of the &s;tate had been generally engro&s;&s;ed by the clergy, the lords and commons in this &s;e&s;&s;ion comp$ained of the practice as a di&s;heri&s;on of their rights, and de|&s;ired that the offices of chancellor, trea&s;urer, clerk of the privy &s;eal, barons, and chamberlains of the exchequer, might be be&s;towed for the future on laymen only.

<P>Edward &s;ent part of the fleet prepared to oppo&s;e the French inva|&s;ion, as a convoy to Humphrey de Bohun earl of Hereford and Southampton, who went as amba&s;&s;ador with the king's younge&s;t &s;on Thomas of Wode&s;toke, to conclude an alliance again&s;t France, with the duke of Brittany. That prince, upon receiving a grant of Chi&s;ac, Melle, and Civray in Poitou, agreed to do homage to Edward, and put twelve of his &s;eaports into the hands of the Eng|li&s;h who &s;hould come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This alliance was afterwards improved into a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, cemented by another grant of the honour of Richmond in England, which the duke of Lanca&s;ter re&s;igned in his favour. The king of England had made overtures of &s;uch another league with the towns of Flanders; but his negotiations were defeated by the influence of their count Lewis, a &s;taunch adherent of Charles, who, though he could not prevail upon the e&s;tates of his country to declare for France, found means to engage a great number of individuals in his intere&s;t. Among the&s;e was John Peter&s;on, com|mander of a Flemi&s;h fleet, which, having taking in a loading of wine and &s;alt at Bayonne and La Baye, chanced to fall in with the &s;quadron under the lord Guy de Brian, the Engli&s;h admiral, who cond$cted the earl of Hereford to Brit|tany. Peter&s;on bearing down upon him, in an ho&s;tile manner, a &s;harp action $n&s;ued, in which the Flemi&s;h commander was defeated, with the &s;laughter of four thou&s;and men, and he and his whole fleet were taken and conveyed to Eng|land. Edward re&s;olved to improve this a$t of ho&s;tility, &s;o as to compel the $$emings to declare them&s;elves, with regard to the conduct they de&s;igned to ob&s;erve in the quarrel between him and Charles. He &s;ent a fleet to block up their harbours, take their &s;hipping, and interrupt their commerce; and this vigorous &s;tep &s;oon obliged them to &s;ue for peace, which was accordingly con|cluded<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer.</NOTE> between them, and the count acceded to the treaty. This advantage was counterballanced by another event in Guienne, which was attended with the lo&s;s of great part of that province. Pedro, late king of Ca&s;tile, had left

his two daughters Con&s;tance and I&s;abella at Aire in Ga&s;cony, as pledges for the money expended by the prince of Wales in effecting his re&s;toration. John of Ghent, marrying the elde&s;t of the&s;e prince&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;umed in her right the arms and title of king of Ca&s;tile and Leon; and by a&s;&s;$rting this claim, intailed upon him&s;elf the implacable enmity of Henry of Tra&s;tamare the pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of the throne, who exerted his utmo&s;t endeavours to ruin the Engli&s;h in Guienne, which was the only country that afforded John a convenient oppor|tunity to invade his dominions.</P>

<P>The duke of Lanca&s;ter returning to England with his new con&s;ort, the king appointed John Ha&s;tings earl of Pembroke to &s;ucceed him in the go|vernment of Guienne; and that nobleman embarked in June with a &s;mall body of forces for the defence of the country. When the fleet that conveyed him<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1372.</NOTE> arrived in the road of Rochelle, they were encountered by the Ca&s;tilian navy, con&s;i&s;ting of forty large carracks, be&s;ides ve&s;&s;els of an inferior burthen, under the direction of one Owen, a native of Wales, who had entered into the French &s;ervice. Though the Spani&s;h &s;hips were much larger than the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and &s;upplied with cannon, which the others wanted, the battle was maintained all day with dubious &s;ucce&s;s, the Engli&s;h being joined by John de Harpeden &s;ene&s;|chal of Rochelle, who embarked with the lords of Tonnay-Boulonne, Sur|geres, and Limers, and a &s;mall party, on board of four incon&s;iderable ve&s;&s;els. Next day the engagement was renewed at high-water, and continued till three in the afternoon, when victory declared for the Spaniards. The cannon made terrible havock among the Engli&s;h; the earl of Pembroke was boarded by the enemy and taken alive, with Sir Guichard d'Angle, Sir John Cur&s;on, and &s;e|veral other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The ve&s;&s;el in which the military che&s;t was de|po&s;$ted, peri&s;hed with twenty thou&s;and pounds in ready money; and all the re&s;t of the &s;hips, with the knights, &s;oldiers, and mariners, fell a prey to the vic|tors, who &s;ailed home with their booty. This defeat would in all probability<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE> have been followed by a defection of the Rochellers, had not the Captal de Buche chanced to enter the town next day with &s;ix hundred Engli&s;h and Ga&s;con men at arms. Neverthele&s;s the di&s;a&s;ter diffu&s;ed a general con&s;ternation through the whole country of Guienne; and the French did not fail to make advantage of their apprehen&s;ion. The con&s;table Du Gue&s;clin, entering Poitou with a nu|merous army, took Montmorillon by &s;torm, and Chauvigny, Lu&s;&s;ac, and Moncontour, &s;urrendered without re&s;i&s;tance: S. Sever in the Limou&s;in &s;u&s;|tained &s;everal attacks, and then capitulated, when the Engli&s;h troops were on their march to its relief; Poitiers opened its gates to the con&s;table, while the Engli&s;h taking Niort by &s;torm, put the inhabitants to the &s;word. Soubize being inve&s;ted by the lord of Pons, John de Greilly Captal de Buche, marched p$$vately in the night to his quarters, and took him pri&s;oner; but was that &s;ame night &s;urprized and taken in his turn, together with Thomas Percy, by Owen, who had returned to the coa&s;t of Rochelle, and landing with a body of troops, planted this am$u&s;h, which &s;ucceeded according to his wi&s;h. The lord of $ons was re&s;cued, Soubize &s;urrendered to the victor, and John de Greilly was conveyed to Paris, where he ended his days; for Charles could not debauch him from the &s;ervice of England, and would not admit to ran&s;om one of the mo&s;t brave, experienced, and honourable, of all his enemies.</P>

<P>The Captal being taken, there was no per&s;on left to oppo&s;e the pro|gre&s;s of the con&s;table; and indeed all the inh$bitants of the country were in the French intere&s;t. S. Jean d'Angeley, Engoule&s;me, and Taillebourg, &s;urren|dered without re&s;i&s;tance; the bi&s;hop and people of Saintes compelled Sir William Farringdon to give up the place; the ca&s;tle of Rochelle was &s;urprized by the citizens, but did not &s;ubmit to France until they had obtained a grant $word$ &s;ever$l extraordinary privileges, and demoli&s;hed the citadel; St. Benoit in t$e neighbourhood was taken by &s;torm, and the garri&s;on put to the &s;word; Marans and Surgeres made very little re&s;i&s;tance; Fontenay &s;urrendered, after having &s;tood &s;everal a&s;&s;aults; and Thouars capitulated for a truce till Michael|mas, when the garri&s;on obliged them&s;elves to yield up the place, if not re|lieved before that time by the king of England, or one of his &s;ons in per&s;on. Edward, being informed of this convention, as well as of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed con|d$t$on o$ his adherents in Poitou, ordered his &s;on John of Lanca&s;ter to po&s;t|pone his inva&s;ion of Picardy, for which preparations had been made, and re|$$lved to &s;uccour Poitou in per&s;on. He ordered four hundred large &s;hips to be provided for the tran&s;portation of his army; and as he propo&s;ed that the prince of Wales, who was now thought to be in a way of recovery, &s;hould accom|pany him to that country, he a&s;&s;embled the prelates, lords, knights, and com|mons of the realm, that they might &s;wear to maintain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Richard, &s;on to prince Edward, in ca&s;e his father and grandfather &s;hould die in the ex|pedition. The ceremony being performed, he appointed him guardian of the kingdom, and embarked with his army at Sandwich on the thirtieth day of Augu&s;t, attended by his three &s;ons, and a great number of Engli&s;h nobility: but being detained above a month by contrary winds, &s;o that he could not po&s;&s;ibly reach the coa&s;t of Poitou by Michaelmas, he returned on the &s;ixth day o$ October to Winchel&s;ey, and laid a&s;ide the enterprize for that &s;ea&s;on. His f$$ends in G$ienne had a&s;&s;embled a body of forces to join him at his landing, and though di&s;appointed in that hope, would have attempted the relief of Thouars; but the officers of the garri&s;on declined their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, ju&s;tly ob|&s;erving, that they were excluded, by the articles of their capitulation, from the benefit of being relieved by any per&s;on but the king of England or one of his &s;ons; and therefore they &s;urrendered the place according to the convention. While the king continued on board, prince Richard had &s;ummoned a parlia|ment to meet for the redre&s;s of grievances; but in con&s;equence of Edward's unexpected return, the meeting of it was po&s;tponed till the third day of No|vember, where the lord Guy Brian gave them to under&s;tand, that the prince of Wales had re&s;igned the principality of Guienne into the hands of his father, becau&s;e the revenue was in&s;ufficient, not only to maintain the wars of that country, but even to &s;upport the ordinary expence of the government. The lords and commons were &s;o zealous for their monarch's glory, that, notwith|&s;tanding the va&s;t expence of the late fruitle&s;s armament, they continued the &s;ub&s;idy on wool and &s;kins for two years longer, and granted be&s;ides a fifteenth of their revenues and moveables, a tenth being payed by the boroughs: but the&s;e &s;upplies came too late to prevent the lo&s;s of Poitou and Saintonge, which were very unprofitable acqui&s;itions to England, becau&s;e they drained it of men<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and money; and the defence of them depended in a great mea&s;ure upon the weather, which could not be favourable in every emergency.</P>

Ch. 1374.</NOTE> inve&s;ted Sivray, routed a body of Engli&s;h and Ga&s;cons, who attempted to beat up his quarters, and by the middle of April entirely reduced the provin|ces of Poitou and Saintonge. St. Sauveur in Normandy was be&s;ieged by the French, and Becherel in Brittany inve&s;ted by Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on, and other no|blemen of that country, who, being in the French intere&s;t, hated John de Montfort for his attachment to Edward. Owen of Wales was &s;aid to be at &s;ea with &s;ix thou&s;and men at arms, in order to make a de&s;cent upon England; and Edward, by this report, was induced to equip a large fleet for the defence of the kingdom. William Montacute, earl of Sali&s;bury, being appointed admi|ral, &s;et fail for St. Malo in Brittany, where finding &s;even large Spani&s;h car|racks, he burned them, to the great di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Bretons, who &s;u&s;pect|ing their duke of having given intelligence of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els to his father-in-law the king of England, began to look upon him as an enemy to his country. The king of France made u&s;e of this pretence for confi&s;cating that province; and the con&s;table Du Gue&s;clin, being charged with the execution of this &s;en|tence, entered Bretagne at the head of an army. Rennes, Dinan, Guingamp, Quimper-Corentin, Vannes, and &s;everal other places, &s;ubmitted without re|&s;i&s;tance; Nantes obtained an honourable capitulation; Hennebond and Le Conquet were taken by &s;torm; and all Brittany, except Bre&s;t and two other places, was &s;ubdued before Mid&s;ummer. John de Montfort, finding him&s;elf abandoned by his &s;ubjects, took refuge in England, leaving the management of his affairs in Brittany to Sir Robert Knolles, whom he appointed his lieute|nant. That officer having put his own ca&s;tle of Derval in a po&s;ture of defence, retired with Sir William Neville to Bre&s;t, which was well provided with all nece&s;&s;aries for &s;u&s;taining a &s;iege, and inhabited by people who were &s;taunch to the intere&s;t of their &s;overeign. This place the con&s;table inve&s;ted with &s;ix thou|&s;and men, &s;ending Oliver de Cli&s;&s;on with the re&s;t of his army to be&s;iege Roche-&s;ur-yon, on the borders of Poitou. The garri&s;on, after having &s;tood &s;ome a&s;&s;aults, agreed to &s;urrender, if not relieved in thirty days. Then Cli&s;&s;on undertook the &s;iege of Derval, and was joined by the con&s;table him&s;elf, who had converted the &s;iege of Bre&s;t into a blockade: Derval being hard pre&s;&s;ed, the garri&s;on demanded a capitulation, by which they obliged them&s;elves to &s;urrender, if not relieved in two months by the duke of Brittany, or &s;ome other general able to keep the field again&s;t the French forces; and two knights and an e&s;quire were delivered as ho&s;tages for the performance of the&s;e articles. Knolles &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of relieving his ca&s;tle, but by making the &s;ame ca|pitulation for Bre&s;t, &s;ubmitted to that expedient, and gave ho&s;tages for &s;ur|rendering the place within forty days, in full confidence of being relieved by the earl of Sali&s;bury, who hovered on the coa&s;t, and had lately received a con|&s;iderable reinforcement from England. He accordingly landed his &s;oldiers in the neighbourhood, and &s;ent an herald to the con&s;table at Nantes, with a me&s;|&s;age, importing that he was come to relieve Bre&s;t, and demanding that he would either relea&s;e the ho&s;tages, or come and give him battle. Du Gue&s;clin told him, he was ready to fight if he would advance to Nantes, where the treaty was concluded; and the earl &s;ignified that he would meet him at Nantes, provided he would furni&s;h his troops with hor&s;es for the march. This propo|&s;al being rejected, the earl continued in his camp until the term of the capitu|lation
<PB N="106" REF="1080">
was expired, and then entered Bre&s;t, which he &s;upplied with a reinforce|ment, provi&s;ions, and nece&s;&s;aries; in con&s;equence of which Du Gue&s;clin &s;ent the ho&s;tages to pri&s;on. Sir Robert Knolles, repairing to his ca&s;tle of Derval, gave the French to under&s;tand, that the place being his own inheri|t$nce, could not be given up without his leave; and therefore he rejected the capitulation, which had been made without his authority. At the expiration of the two months the duke of Anjou demanded the place, threatening to behead the ho&s;tages in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. Knolles vowed retaliation upon the French pri&s;oners that were in his hands; and the duke putting his threats in execu|tion, the other cau&s;ed three French knights and an e&s;quire to be beheaded in $ight of the be&s;iegers, who forthwith abandoned the enterprize. By this time the duke of Anjou and the con&s;table were &s;ummoned to Paris, in order to op|po&s;e the progre&s;s of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who began his march from Cala$s in the month of July, with an army of thirty thou&s;and men; and having ra|v$ged the open country of Artois and Picardy, without making any attempt upon the fortified places, which were well provided with garri&s;ons and provi|&s;ions, pa&s;&s;ed through Champagne, Burgundy, Beaujolois, Forez, and Auvergne, into the province of Guienne, having been all the way attended by a body of French troops, which had orders to avoid an engagement. In order to defray the expence of this expedition and the en&s;uing campaign, a parliament was con|voked at We&s;tmin&s;ter in the month of November, when the lords and com|mons, after having conferred together, granted two fifteenths for counties, and as many tenths for boroughs, to be levied in two years, with an additional<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> duty on merchandize; though the&s;e aids were conditional, becau&s;e by this time a treaty was &s;et on foot at Bruges, under the pope's mediation.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> As the count de Foix, who&s;e lands were a parcel of the antient d$tchy of Acquitaine, had hitherto ob&s;erved a &s;trict neutrality, without giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to either party, the duke of Anjou re&s;olved to compel him to a de|c$aration; and taking the field immediately after Ea&s;ter, with the con&s;table and t$e majority of the Ga&s;con lords, reduced Mont de Mar&s;an, compounded with the abbot of St. Sever, to$k Lourde by a&s;&s;ault, and entering Bearne, un|dertook the &s;iege of Sailles. Here he concluded a truce with the count de Fo$x, who agreed to hold his county of the French, provided the Engli&s;h &s;hould fail to meet them on the fifteenth day of Augu&s;t, at Moi&s;&s;ac on the Tarn, to decide their preten&s;ions in battle. After this agreement, the duke of Anjou returning to Perigeux, concluded a ce&s;&s;ation of arms with the duke of Lan|ca&s;ter till the end of Augu&s;t, at the in&s;tances of the pope's legates$ and it was &s;tipulated, that this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion &s;hould be prolonged by a &s;ub&s;equent treaty, to be managed in the beginning of September by Lanca&s;ter at Calais, and Anjou at St. Omer. John of Ghent, confiding in this agreement, by which all acts of ho&s;tility were &s;u&s;pended, embarked for England in July, with the duke of Brittany, and the Engli&s;h noblemen who had &s;erved him in this expedition; and the duke of Anjou appearing at Moi&s;&s;ac on the day appointed, was ad|mitted into the town, where he received the homage of the count de Foix. There he continued till the end of Augu&s;t, when alledging the truce was ex|pired, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of La Reole, and forty towns and ca&s;tles &s;ub|mitted to him without oppo&s;ition; in a word, he, without &s;triking one blow, reduced the whole province of Ga&s;cony, except Bayonne, Bourdeaux, Mor|tagne,

Bergerac, and a few other places on the Dordogne. The duke of An|jou, having properly &s;ecured his conque&s;t, repaired to St. Omer; and the truce was continued till the fir&s;t day of May in the following year.</P>

<P>The conferences for peace at Bruges were &s;till maintained in pre&s;ence of the pope's legates, though hitherto they had little rea&s;on to believe they &s;hould be able to effect an accommodation; and, in the mean time, the ca&s;tle of Becherel in Brittany, which had been gallantly defended by Sir John Cornwal, was &s;urrendered to the French by capitulation. John de Montfort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1375.</NOTE> &s;overeign of that country, accompanied by the earls of Cambridge, Marche, Warwick, Stafford, and Kent, &s;et &s;ail from England in the beginning of May, with a con&s;iderable body of forces, and landed at St. Mah&eacute; in Bretagne, which they took by a&s;&s;ault: the &s;ame fate attended St. Pol de Lion; but Morlaix, Lannion, Lantreguier, Roche-de-rien, Guingamp, and Roche-Bernard, &s;ub|mitted without re&s;i$tance. Then he inve&s;ted St. Brien; and Oliver de Cli&s;|&s;on tried to make a diver&s;ion, by undertaking the &s;iege of a fort lately erected by Sir John Devreux, in the neighbourhood of Quimperly. Montfort im|mediately quitted S. Brien, and advanced again&s;t Cli&s;&s;on with &s;uch &s;ecrecy and expedition, that he had no intimation of his march, until he was within two leagues of his quarters, &s;o that he &s;carce had time to throw him&s;elf into Quim|perly. The duke of Bretagne was extremely incen&s;ed again&s;t this officer, not only as his implacable and indefatigable enemy, but al&s;o as author of all tho&s;e barbarous coun&s;els, which had produced &s;o much blood&s;hed and de&s;olation. It was by his advice that the ho&s;tages of Derval were put to death. He had with his own hands a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated fifteen Engli&s;hmen, who, at the reduction of Benon, had retired to a tower, and &s;urrendered upon capitulation: he had &s;worn that he would never give quarter to any native of that kingdom; and &s;uch was the &s;an|guinary di&s;po&s;ition of the man, that he was generally &s;tiled the Butcher of Brit|tany. Montfort approaching Quimperly, ordered an immediate a&s;&s;ault to be giv|en; but his &s;oldiers were repul&s;ed, by the valour or de&s;pair of the defendants. The vi&s;comte de Rohan and the lord of Beaumanoir commanded the garri&s;on, and had given the duke &s;o many cau&s;es of offence, that they had very little hope of mercy. Finding it impracticable to maintain the place again&s;t the vigour of his a&s;&s;aults, they and Cli&s;&s;on offered to &s;urrender, on condition of being ad|mitted to ran&s;om without lo&s;s of life or limb: but he in&s;i&s;ted on their &s;urren|dering at di&s;cretion. Then they fued for a truce of e$ght days, at the expira|tion of which they would yield them&s;elves up, if not relieved in the interim. This reque&s;t was granted, becau&s;e there was no pro&s;pect of their being &s;uc|coured: yet in that interval, the be&s;iegers received advice of the truce con|cluded at Bruges, together with the duke of Lanca&s;ter's orders to de&s;i&s;t from all ho&s;tilities. Montfort, &s;acrificing his revenge to his honour, rai&s;ed the &s;iege immediately, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h troops, retired to Auray. The French were not &s;o punctilious with re&s;pect to the garri&s;on of St. Sauveur, which, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ame kind of capitulation, were obliged to &s;ur|render,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D'Argentr&eacute;$ Daniel. Rymer.</NOTE> though they claimed the benefit of the truce, which the be&s;iegers inter|preted to their own advantage. The French court, however, being a&s;hamed of the tran&s;action, agreed to pay forty thou&s;and franks of gold for the place, or in default of that payment, to deliver it into the hands of the legates, for the u&s;e of the king of England.</P>

<P>The truce was managed by the duke of Lanca&s;ter, the earl of Sali&s;bury, the bi&s;hop of London, and the lord John Cobham, as commi&s;&s;ioners from Edward: the deputies of France were the dukes of Anjou and Burgundy, the count de Salebruce, with the bi&s;hops of Amiens and Bayeux. After much a$tercation and debate, they at length agreed, that all ho&s;tilities &s;hould cea&s;$ from the twenty-&s;eventh day of June till the fifteenth of September; that du|ring this term there &s;hould be a $ree intercour&s;e between the two nations; tha$ all pri&s;oners &s;hould be relea&s;ed; that no new forts &s;hould be erected by either party, but that they &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing robber$, murder, and other outrages; that Henry king of Ca&s;tile, and John de Montfort duke of Brittany, &s;hould be comprehended in this agreement; that ho&s;tilities &s;hould cea&s;e in Brittany; and the forces of Edward and Montfort be removed from that country, except two hundred men to guard the places which the duke &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and la&s;tly, that the two kings &s;hould &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners to Bruges<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rym$$.</NOTE> by the fifteenth day of September, to &s;ettle the articles of a &s;olid pacification.</P>

<P>This convention was deemed di&s;honourable in England, where the people began to be very much out of humour with the admini&s;tration. They &s;aw the $ruits of the money they had wa&s;ted, and the blood they had &s;hed, almo&s;t bla&s;ted; they &s;aw the Black Prince ha&s;tening to his grave, the nation governed by a knavi&s;h mini&s;try, and the great Edward &s;unk into dotage. He had outlived all his &s;pirit and magnanimity, and become the contemptible &s;lave of an infamous woman called Alice Perrers, who had been a dome&s;tic of his late virtuous queen Philippa, and married to William de Wind&s;or, at one time lieutenant of Ireland. Edward was &s;o infatuated by the per&s;onal charms of this new idol, that he re&s;igned him&s;elf w$olly to her direction; and, in order to gratify her avarice, encouraged certain corrupt practices, which, in the vi|gour of his intellects, he would have di&s;dained to countenance. He was even &s;o weak as to convey to this abandoned favourite, the jewels and moveables of the queen Philippa: &s;he had the pre&s;umption to pre&s;ide in the public courts of j$&s;tice; &s;he created and di&s;placed mini&s;ters at her plea&s;ure; &s;o that no per|&s;on of ability or virtue would be concerned in the admini&s;tration. The royal authority grew into contempt; the reins of government were &s;hamefully &s;lackened; and the whole kingdom complained of mi&s;management and op|pre&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. Eve$ham. Tyrrel.</NOTE> Robert king of Scotland had concluded a treaty with France, in which, among other articles, it was &s;tipulated, that no Frenchman &s;hould &s;erve again&s;t Scotland; nor any Scot enli&s;t with the enemies of France. The Scotti&s;h king accordingly recalled his &s;ubjects from the army of England; and in &s;o doing gave &s;uch umbrage to Edward, that he i&s;&s;ued orders for arraying the northern militia to repel the inva&s;ion which he &s;eemed to think was meditated by the king of Scotland. Robert looked upon this preparation as a de&s;ign to invade his dominions, and arming in his own defence, a petty war en&s;ued between the wardens of the Scotti&s;h and Engli&s;h Marches. The earls of Marche and Murray ma&s;&s;acred the Engli&s;h at a fair in Roxburgh, in revenge for the death of a Scot who had been murdered in the &s;ame place. The Engli&s;h fell into Scotland and plundered the e&s;tate of Sir John Gordon, who indemnified him|&s;elf by entering England, from whence he returned with a large booty, and Sir John Lilburn, whom he had defeated and taken.

<P>The people of England re&s;pected their monarch even in his failings. They remembered the lu&s;tre of his former conduct: they reviewed the glories of his reign, and the vigour of his government; and bore with his infirmities, until the effects of them became pernicious to the commonwealth. The public trea&s;ure was lavi&s;hed without any advantage to the kingdom; the revenues were embezzled; the government had borrowed money at exorbitant intere&s;t, and forced the king's creditors to take the tenth, twentieth, and even the hundredth penny, by way of compo&s;ition: the &s;ubjects laboured under many other grievances, which the parliament now re&s;olved to redre&s;s. It had been &s;ummoned to meet on the twelfth day of February, but did not &s;it for the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s till the twenty-fourth day of April. Sir John Knivet the lord chancellor having opened the a&s;&s;embly with a &s;peech, in which he explained the preparations of France, and repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of granting an aid to defeat the purpo&s;es of that indefatigable enemy, the lords and commons having conferred together, continued the &s;ub&s;idy on wool and &s;kins for three years longer than the term for which it had been granted: and though they excu&s;ed them&s;elves from rai&s;ing a larger &s;upply for the pre|&s;ent, on account of the pe&s;tilence, murrain, and de&s;truction of grain, under which the kingdom had for &s;ome time laboured, they declared they would grant another aid, in ca&s;e any new cau&s;e of expence &s;hould intervene. But before they provided for the nece&s;&s;ities of the government, they made a warm remon&s;trance upon the grievances of the nation. They complained of the embezzlement of the public trea&s;ure, and u&s;urious contracts, which had been made by &s;ome of the king's officers, to the un&s;peakable prejudice of the re|venue. They de&s;ired the king would augment his council to ten or twelve of the chief prelates and nobility; and that nothing of moment &s;hould be tran&s;|acted without the advice and concurrence of four at lea&s;t of that number: provided, neverthele&s;s, that the chancellor, trea&s;urer, privy-&s;eal, and the king's other officers, might perform their functions, independent of tho&s;e coun&s;ellors. They likewi&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's re&s;training his mini&s;ters and officers from receiving gifts and pre&s;ents, except their own pen&s;ions and perqui&s;ites: and they impeached &s;everal individuals for having rai&s;ed money illegally, and committed extortion in the exerci&s;e of their offices. Among the&s;e was Richard Lyon, a merchant of London, who farmed the king's cu&s;|toms: he was accu&s;ed of u&s;ury, as well as of having &s;muggled wool and dif|ferent &s;orts of merchandize, to other ports than Calais, where the &s;taple was e&s;tabli&s;hed. Perhaps they would not have deemed him an object worthy of their regard, had not they expected he would have di&s;covered his abettors and connexion with &s;ome of the greate&s;t noblemen of the kingdom. John of Ghent him&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected of being concerned in the&s;e fraudulent and op|pre&s;&s;ive practices; and though he e&s;caped on this occa&s;ion undi&s;covered, the lord Latimer, who was chamberlain and privy-coun&s;ellor to the king, was convicted of &s;uch clande&s;tine traffic, and other in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion and corruption. That nobleman made a very &s;trong and di&s;tinct defence; but &s;uch was the antimini&s;terial &s;pirit of the parliament, that he was deprived of his employments, and confined in the Mar&s;hal&s;ea until he &s;hould pay a fine of twenty thou&s;and marks.

At her in&s;tigation, the regent impri&s;oned Sir Peter de la Mere, who had &s;poke with great freedom again&s;t her in the late parliament: for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the earl of Marche was deprived of his marechal's &s;taff, which was given to the lord Percy; and all the temporalities of William of Wickham, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, &s;eized upon frivolous pre|tences. Then they began to take mea&s;ures for chu&s;ing another parliament, of a complexion different from that of the la&s;t; and they &s;ucceeded in their endeavours. It was &s;ummoned to meet on the twenty-&s;eventh day of Janu|ary; and, in the interim, conferences for a peace were carried on at Bruges, though with very little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s: for the French king demanded the re&s;titution of Calais, and the repayment of great part of his father's ran|&s;om. Edward not only refu&s;ed the&s;e demands, but even in&s;i&s;ted upon France's renouncing all claim to the &s;overeignty of Guienne. The truce, however, was prolonged to the fir&s;t day of April; and the court of England filled the nation with alarms of inva&s;ion from France, Spain, and Scotland. The mini&s;try likewi&s;e fomented the di&s;contents of the people with re&s;pect to papal u&s;urpations; and cheri&s;hed a &s;pirit of re&s;entment again&s;t all foreigners without di&s;tinction.</P>

<P>The new parliament granted a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy, by way of poll-tax, which was even extended to all the clergy, except the Mendicant Friars: but, as the nece&s;&s;ities of the court would not admit of a delay, until this aid could be collected, the mini&s;ters demanded a loan of four thou&s;and pounds from the city of London, which refu&s;ed to advance the money. This refu&s;al was re&s;ented in &s;uch a manner by the court, that Adam Staple was removed from the mayoralty by a &s;pecial mandamus, and Sir Richard Whittington appointed as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in that office. The commons ma|nife&s;ted their complai&s;ance to the mini&s;try, not only in the &s;upplies which
<PB N="112" REF="1140">
they readily granted, but al&s;o in rever&s;ing a great many uncourtly re&s;olutions which had been taken in the preceding parliament. The &s;entence pronounced again&s;t lord Latimer was revoked; Lyon was pardoned; and Alice Perrers re&s;tored to all h$r former rights, privileges, and e&s;tate, on pretence that &s;he had never been tried before the parliament for the mi&s;demeanours laid to her charge. The citizens of London pre&s;ented &s;everal petitions concerning their trade, and the choice of a coroner; and th$$e being di&s;regarded by the duke of Lanca&s;ter and the mini&s;try, the city was fill$d with clamours and di&s;|content. The enemies of the duke indu&s;triou&s;ly cir$ulated idle &s;tories, im|porting that he had advi&s;ed the king to aboli&s;h the government of the city, and reduce it under the authority of the lord marechal, who, by his beha|viour, &s;eemed to confirm this &s;u&s;picion; for he ordered a per&s;on to be arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned in his own hou&s;e, though it &s;tood within the liberties of London. This outrage, added to their former re&s;entment, incen&s;ed the po|pulace to &s;uch a degree of fury, that a general riot en&s;ued. They plundered and de&s;troyed the hou&s;e of the lord marechal, and would have &s;acrificed him to their revenge, had they found him in his own habitation. Luckily for him, he happened to dine that day with the duke of Lanca&s;ter, at the hou&s;e of a foreign merchant, in a different part of the city. Di&s;appointed in this part of their expectation, the multitude proceeded to the palace of the Savoy, belonging to the regent, which they immediately &s;tripped of all its rich fur|niture, after having murdered a prie&s;t who ventured to blame their proceed|ings. Their intention was to have relea&s;ed Sir Peter de la Mere, and de&s;troy the duke of Lanca&s;ter; but, finding neither, they hung up the arms of John rever&s;ed, as belonging to a traitor; and would have committed much more t$rrible outrages, had not they been pacified by the bi&s;hop of London, who&s;e per&s;on they revered. The duke and the marechal ha&s;tened to Kennington, to advi&s;e with the prince&s;s of Wales; who, being very popular in the city, &s;ent thither four knights of her dome&s;tics to expo&s;tulate with the rioters, and repre&s;ent the iniquity and ill con&s;equences of their proceedings. They forth|with de&s;i&s;ted, in obedience to her commands; but de&s;ired the knights to tell the duke of Lanca&s;ter, they expected the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter and Sir Peter de la Mere &s;hould be tried according to the laws of their country. Then the magi&s;tracy &s;ent a deputation to a&s;&s;ure his maje&s;ty, that they had u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to prevent this di&s;turbance. The king received them graciou&s;ly, and admitted of their excu&s;e: but the duke was &s;o incen&s;ed at the pre&s;umption of the populace, and the injury he had &s;u&s;tained in his effects, that he not only exacted a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the chief citizens, but al&s;o de|prived the mayor and aldermen of their offices, and filled their places with<NOTE PLACE="marg">T$$$$l.</NOTE> his own creatures.</P>

<P>The prolongation of the truce with France being expired, the mi|litia of England received orders to be in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e an inva&s;ion, for which the French were &s;uppo&s;ed to be making preparations. They had ac|tually drawn down their forces towards th$ &s;ea-&s;ide; but, in&s;tead of embark|ing for England, they inve&s;ted the &s;trong fort of Outwick, in the neighbour|hood of Calais, commanded by William We&s;ton, who &s;urrendered almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition: but Sir Hugh Calverly, governor of Calais, &s;oon retoo$ this fortre&s;s, and ravaged the adjoining territories of France, from which he
<PB N="113" REF="1150">
carried off a con&s;iderable booty. This was the la&s;t exploit performed by the Engli&s;h, in the reign of Edward, who had lately removed from Eltham to Sheen in Surry, where he &s;unk into unmanly indolence, and gave him&s;elf up to the enjoyment of loo&s;e de&s;ire in the arms of his favourite concu|bine. His con&s;titution had been impaired by the fatigues of his youth; &s;o that he began to feel the infirmities of old age before they approach in the common cour&s;e of nature: and now he was &s;eized with a fever, attended with violent eruptions, that &s;oon put a period to his life. When his di&s;|temper became &s;o violent that no hope of his recovery remained, all his at|tendants for&s;ook him, as a bankrupt no longer able to requite their &s;ervices; the ungrateful Alice, waiting until &s;he perceived him in the agonies of death, was &s;o inhuman as to &s;trip him of his rings and jewels, and leave him, without one dome&s;tic, to clo&s;e his eyes and do the la&s;t offices to his breathle&s;s coar&s;e. In this deplorable condition, bereft of comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the mighty Edward lay expiring, when a prie&s;t, not quite &s;o &s;avage as the re&s;t of his dome&s;tics, approached his bed; and, finding him &s;till breathing, began to admini&s;ter &s;ome &s;piritual con&s;olation to his &s;oul. Edward had not yet lo&s;t all perception: what then mu&s;t have been his reflections, when he found him&s;elf thus abandoned and forlorn in the la&s;t moments of his life? He was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Eve&s;h. Wal&s;ingham. Tyrrel.</NOTE> ju&s;t able to expre&s;s a deep &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow and contrition for the errors of his conduct, and died pronouncing the name of Je&s;us. Such was the piteous and ob&s;cure exit of Edward III. undoubtedly one of the greate&s;t princes that ever &s;wayed the &s;cepter of England; whether we re&s;pect him as a warrior or law|giver, a monarch or a man. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the courage and romantic &s;pirit of Alexander; the penetration, the fortitude, the poli&s;hed manners of Julius; the munificence, the liberality, the wi&s;dom of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar. He was tall, maje&s;tic, finely &s;haped, with a piercing eye, and aquiline vi&s;age. He ex|celled all his cotemporaries in feats of arms and per&s;onal addre&s;s. He was courteous, affable, and eloquent; of a free deportment, and agreeable con|ver&s;ation: and had the art of commanding the affection of his &s;ubjects with|out &s;eeming to &s;ollicit popularity. He was a con&s;titutional knight errant; and his example diffu&s;ed the &s;pirit of chivalry through the whole nation. In imitation of the youthful monarch, who delighted in tilts and tournaments, every individual betook him&s;elf to the exerci&s;e of arms, every brea&s;t glowed with emulation, every heart panted with the thir&s;t of glory; and when he took the field, there was not a &s;oldier in his army who did not &s;erve from &s;entiment, and fight for reputation. The love of glory was certainly the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of Edward, to the gratification of which he did not &s;cruple to &s;acrifice the feelings of humanity, the lives of his &s;ubjects, and the intere&s;t of his country. And nothing could have induced or enabled his people to bear the load of taxes, with which they were encumbered in this reign, but the love and admiration of his per&s;on, the fame of his victories, and the excellent laws and regulations which the parliaments enacted with his advice and concurrence. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was buried in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey, near his queen Philippa, by whom he had &s;even &s;ons and five daughters, namely, Edward the Black Prince; William of Hatfield, who died in the cradle; Lionel of Antwerp, duke of Clarence, who married Elizabeth, heire&s;s of William de Burgh earl of U$$$er. He was afterwards married to Yola$te, &s;i&s;ter to John Galeazo Vi&s;conti duke of Milan; and by her he had one daughter, called Philippa, who was matched with Edmund Mor$imer earl of Marche: Edward's fourth &s;on was John of Gh$nt, who married Blanche, daughter and coheir of Henry duke of Lanca&s;ter, to which tide he &s;ucceeded; his &s;econd wife was Con&s;tance, elde&s;t daughter of Pedro the Cruel, king of Ca&s;tile, in who&s;e right he a&s;&s;umed the arms and title of that crown; after her death, he married Catharine Swinford, who had already bore to him &s;everal illegit$mate children. The fifth &s;on of Edward was Edmund de Langley, earl of Cambridge, and afterwards duke of York; the &s;ixth was William of Wind&s;or, who died in his infancy; and the &s;eventh, Thomas of Wood|&s;toke.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">&sect; XLI.</HEAD>
<P>The eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory of this period turns chiefly upon the di&s;|putes between the crown of England and the popes, who, &s;ince the &s;hameful re&s;ignation of king John, had always looked upon this country as a tributary kingdom and conquered province, which they had a right to rule and impo|veri$h. The Engli&s;h people, under the reign of the fir&s;t Edward, found the Roman yoke &s;o intolerable, that they began to concert mea&s;ures for redeem|ing them&s;elves from &s;uch infamous &s;lavery, though not before they had, by repeated complaints, repre&s;ented their grievances to the court of Rome, and $word$ in vain for redre&s;s. They complained of the frequent appeals that $b$ged individuals to go and exhau&s;t their time and money, in &s;olliciting cau&s;es at the court of Rome; and that the pope had u&s;urped the collation of almo&s;t all the benefices of the kingdom, contrary to the rights of the king, the chapters, and patrons. Sometimes his holine&s;s, from the plenitude of his apo$tolic power, re&s;erved to him&s;elf the power of filling all the vacancies which aro&s;e from tran&s;lation, death of the incumbent, or any other cau&s;e what&s;oever: by which means tho&s;e pontiffs eluded all the canonical elections in England, without advancing any other rea&s;on but that they had re&s;erved to them&s;elves, beforehand, the right of filling up the benefice. They had certainly formed the de&s;ign of engro&s;&s;ing, by little and little, the collation to all the eccle&s;ia&s;|tical livings in the kingdom: for, when they could not decently pretend to have made &s;uch a re&s;ervation of a right to nominate, they generally found &s;ome objection to the elect, and appointed another in his room; but as tho&s;e who had been canonically elected, were always &s;upported by the kings of England, the popes found means to evade this oppo&s;ition, in conferring bi&s;hoprics and benefices before they were vacant, by provi&s;ion, which the Engli&s;h people con&s;idered as an un&s;ufferable grievance. This was the more provoking, as the benefices be&s;towed by the pope's plenitude of power were generally granted to foreigners, cardinals, or their kin&s;men, who, by virtue of a di&s;pen&s;ation, enjoyed the revenues without re&s;iding in the kingdom. The&s;e benefices were generally farmed by people who employed curates at very &s;mall &s;alaries: the &s;ervice was neglected; the churches went to ruin; all ho&s;|pitality was bani&s;hed; and the practice of in&s;tructing people in the duties of
<PB N="115" REF="1170">
the chri&s;tian religion, intirely neglected. Be&s;ides the&s;e inconveniencies, the money was carried out of the kingdom, to the infinite prejudice of the natives; an hard&s;hip that will appear to have been the more &s;evere, if we con&s;ider that in the reign of Henry III. the income which foreign eccle&s;ia&s;tics drew from England, exceeded the royal revenue. The popes frequently impo&s;ed taxes on the Engli&s;h clergy; &s;ometimes on pretence of cru&s;ades; &s;ometimes to re|lieve the nece&s;&s;ities of the holy &s;ee; and often by granting tythes to the king, who gratified his holine&s;s with &s;hare of the plunder. The clergy of England was obliged to maintain legates and nuncios at a great expence, over and above pre&s;ents and procurations, which they extorted by virtue of the pope's authority: the annates or fir&s;t fruits of all benefices were payed to the Roman pontiff; St. Peter's penny was levied with great rigour; and the tribute in|curred by king John was con&s;idered as a mo&s;t &s;candalous oppre&s;&s;ion. At the &s;ame time, the clergy indu&s;triou&s;ly encroached upon the civil power and prerogatives of the &s;overeign: they extended their juri&s;diction over all matri|monial cau&s;es; they took cognizance of every di&s;pute in which religion could in any &s;hape be intere&s;ted; and, in&s;tead of &s;upporting the rights and preroga|tives of the crown, they always e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of the pope, whom they affected to con&s;ider as their only &s;overeign. The&s;e are the principal grie|vances which the kings and parliaments of England endeavoured, from time to time, to redre&s;s, by occa&s;ional &s;tatutes and ordinances, which furni&s;hed the popes with a pretext to complain in their turn, that the church was in danger, and the cau&s;e of God neglected and betrayed. Pope Clement V. in a bull, in&s;erted among the public acts, enumerates the following cau&s;es of complaint again&s;t the conduct of the Engli&s;h government: The cardinals were not al|lowed to enjoy the prebendaries be&s;towed upon them, as per&s;ons ordained by God to bear a &s;hare in the fatigue of the government of the church. Though the pope had inconte&s;tably the right to confer benefices in England, as well as in other dominions, tho&s;e for whom he provided, were not allowed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, nor even to excommunicate &s;uch as had the pre&s;umption to oppo&s;e their endeavours to avail them&s;elves of their right. The citations i&s;&s;ued from Rome on this &s;ubject, were di&s;regarded: notaries were forbid to publi&s;h them, and the natives to an&s;wer any appeals out of the kingdom. The pope's nuncios were prohibited from exerci&s;ing their functions until they &s;hould have received the king's licence; and &s;ome of them had been confined in public pri&s;ons, from whence they had been obliged to purcha&s;e their relea&s;e with con&s;iderable &s;ums of money. The magi&s;trates would not &s;uffer excommuni|cated per&s;ons to be impri&s;oned, even after the forty days allowed them to give &s;atisfaction to the church. The king frequently inhibited eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts from taking cognizance of cau&s;es that properly belonged to their province; and even deprived them of juri&s;diction over the members of the clergy, with|out con&s;idering that eccle&s;ia&s;tics are altogether independent of lay-tribunals. Clerks were condemned in lay-courts, even without the con&s;ent of their &s;upe|riors: they were obliged to appear in their &s;hirts before civil tribunals, in de|fiance of their immunities; and though they were remitted to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, when reclaimed, they were frequently acquitted and relea&s;ed by lay|judges, before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court had taken cognizance of the affair. Clerks were acquitted or condemned by juries of laymen. The nobility
<PB N="116" REF="1180">
of the kingdom frequently oppre&s;&s;ed the abbeys, by lodging in them at a great expence, under the frivolous pretext that the mona&s;teries had been founded by their ance&s;tors. During the vacancy of abbeys, tho&s;e whom the king ap|pointed to take charge of them damaged the premi&s;es and wa&s;ted the in|come; and finally, the tribute of a thou&s;and marks due to the holy &s;ee was not payed to the pope, but converted to other u&s;es.</P>

<P>The&s;e were the cau&s;es of complaint reciprocally urged again&s;t each other, by the courts of England and Rome, and the &s;ubject upon which di|vers laws and regulations were enacted, as the intere&s;t of either chanced to pre|dominate. At the death of Boniface archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the monks elected their prior William Chiltenden, who going in per&s;on to Rome, in order to &s;ollicit the pope's approbation, was per&s;uaded of his own want of capacity to exerci&s;e that function; he accordingly re&s;igned the archbi&s;hopric, which the pope conferred upon Robert Kilwarby, a Black Friar. This tran&s;|action happening while Edward I. was in Pale&s;tine, the guardians of the kingdom acq$ie$ced in the nomination of his holine&s;s, though they prote&s;ted again&s;t any &s;uch proceedings for the future; and the monks, in order to pre|&s;erve<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch 12$4.</NOTE> their privilege, confirmed Robert by a new election. Edward, in his re|turn from the Holy Land, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the council of Lyons, where a new aid was granted for that &s;ervice; and his holine&s;s &s;ent over a nuncio to collect it from the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of England. In the third year of Edward, a famous &s;ta|t$te was enacted at We&s;tmin&s;ter, providing that a clerk apprehended for fe|lony &s;hall be delivered to the ordinary, if demanded according to the privilege<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 12$$.</NOTE> of the holy church. In a &s;ub&s;equent parliament at the &s;ame place, it was enacted, after a canon pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd council of Lyons, that every per|&s;on twice married &s;hould be utterly deprived of all clerical privileges; and that although they were bigami&s;ts even before this con&s;titution, ju&s;tice &s;hould be executed upon them as upon other laymen. But this law was repealed in the &s;equel.</P>

<P>Kilwarby being created a cardinal and bi&s;hop of Oporto, he was obliged to abdicate his archbi&s;hopric; and the monks of Canterbury cho&s;e in his room Robert Burnel bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, who being di&s;agreeable to the court of Rome, the pope filled the &s;ee with John Peckham, a Franci&s;can Friar; and Edward did not think proper to di&s;pute his nomination. When this prelate arrived in England, he convoked a provincial &s;ynod at Reading, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. Wa$erl.</NOTE> which he confirmed the decrees of the council of Lyons again&s;t pluralities: then he pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal canons directly levelled again&s;t the royal prerogative, denoun|cing the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould obtain orders from the king to hinder certain cau&s;es from being carried into the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court; again&s;t tho&s;e magi&s;trates who &s;hould refu&s;e to impri&s;on excommunicated per&s;ons after the forty days granted by the canons; again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould encroach upon the lands of the clergy, and all who &s;hould &s;ell provi&s;ions to the archbi&s;hop of York within the province of Canterbury. This la&s;t canon was contrived to terminate the di&s;pute between the two archbi&s;hops about carrying the cro&s;s, and had it taken place the prelate of York would have found &s;ome difficulty in attending the parliament at London. Edward no &s;ooner under&s;tood the purport of the&s;e regulations than he ordered Peckham to be &s;ummoned before him and his council in parliament, where he revoked
<PB N="117" REF="1190">
tho&s;e canons which &s;eemed to trench upon the prerogative of the crown; and they were accordingly annulled and aboli&s;hed. The next provincial &s;ynod was held at Lambeth, at which the regulars refu&s;ing to attend, were pro&s;ecuted and puni&s;hed by the archbi&s;hop. This council was convened to review and rein|force<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1281.</NOTE> the former con&s;titutions, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome points of &s;peculative doctrine touching the admini&s;tration of the &s;acrament under one &s;pecies. Peckham is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;everity of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, the &s;crupulous au&s;terity of his own conduct, and his un&s;haken attachment to the immunities of the church as well as to the papal authority. He cen&s;ured &s;ome opinions of one Knapwell, as heretical; and among others, his a&s;&s;erting the authority of the &s;criptures over that of the pope and the fathers. He afterwards pub|li&s;hed a &s;et of articles, to be ob&s;erved by all the pari&s;h-prie&s;ts of his juri&s;diction and dioce&s;e, regulating their morals and recommending the faithful di&s;charge of their pa&s;toral functions. Several dioce&s;an &s;ynods were held in different parts for the&s;e laudable purpo&s;es, and one in particular at Exeter, for enforcing the con&s;titutions of Otho, Ottobon, and the late &s;ynod at Lambeth, touching the adoration of the euchari&s;t. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Thorn.</NOTE></P>

<P>After Peckham's death the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury was vacant for two years, and then the monks of Chri&s;t-church elected Robert Winchel|&s;ey, who was confirmed by the king and the pope. He &s;et out for Rome to &s;ollicit the pall and confirmation, and during his ab&s;ence Edward demanded that aid of the clergy which has been already mentioned in the hi&s;tory of his reign. Robert, being informed of this oppre&s;&s;ion, obtained from Boniface a bull prohibiting the clergy, on pain of excommunication, from paying taxes to the crown, without the con&s;ent of his holine&s;s; and this was the &s;ource of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> that di&s;&s;ention between the king and the clergy, which la&s;t body at length prevailed in the confirmation of the great charter, impowering the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops to denounce the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t all infrac|tors of the public liberty. About this period, the Minorites of England of|fered to pay forty thou&s;and crowns of gold, as a con&s;ideration for a bull, im|powering them to purcha&s;e e&s;tates and live upon the revenues of their order. The pope under&s;tanding that the money was depo&s;ited in the hands of a ban|ker at Rome, &s;eized the prize, for which he gave acquittance and ab&s;olution to the banker, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the deputies without granting their reque&s;t. The archbi&s;hop Winchel&s;ey held a provincial &s;ynod at Merton, in which &s;everal con&s;titutions were enacted for the better regulation of the clergy; and, in the mean time, Edward, having made a conque&s;t of Scotland, filled up the va|cant &s;ees of that kingdom. Lamerton was created bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, not|with&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of the Culdies or Black Monks, who had always enjoyed the right of election. The conce&s;&s;ions which Edward had been obliged to make, by the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs, encouraged the pope to make further encroachments. He inve&s;ted William de Gainborough, who had been pro|moted to the &s;ee of Worce&s;ter, with the temporalities as well as with the &s;piritualities of the dioce&s;e; but the king, who&s;e affairs had by this time taken a more favourable turn, not only obliged the prelate to renounce the clau&s;e in the bull, touching the temporalities, but ordered him to be fined in a thou|&s;and pounds, for having accepted &s;uch a grant.</P>

<P>The di&s;pute between the pope and the French king rendering Edward a nece&s;&s;ary ally to his holine&s;s, who was a native of Bourdeaux, he re&s;olved to humble the clergy, who had joined the great lords in oppo&s;ing his arb$$rary mea&s;ures. Winchel&s;ey was accu&s;ed of having engaged in a con&s;pi|racy to dethrone the king in favour of the prince of Wales; and know|ing he lay at the mercy of his maje&s;ty, he was de&s;erted by all his former re&s;o|lution. He kneeled, wept, &s;upplicated, embraced the knees, and implored the ble&s;&s;ing of Edward, who, having nothing placable or forgiving in his temper, reproached him bitterly for his pa&s;t conduct, and told him he &s;hould be judged by an ecccle&s;ia&s;tical tribunal. He accordingly entered a formal complaint again&s;t him with the pope, for crimes amounting to high trea&s;on; and his hol$$e&s;s being rendered propitious by the pre&s;ent of &s;ome gold plate, &s;ummoned the archbi&s;hop to Rome, &s;u&s;pended him from the execution of his office, and &s;ent commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;eize his temporalities. Winchel&s;ey, be|ing thus reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, repaired to court and begged Edward would allow him to go abroad, and grant him a &s;afe-guard and protection for the &s;$fety of his per&s;on. The king ordering the door of his chamber to be thrown open, that every body might come in and hear the an&s;wer he intended to make, "We grant you (&s;aid he) a pa&s;&s;port to go beyond &s;eas; but you &s;hall have no &s;afeguard or protection for your return: we remember your in|t$$gues and trea&s;onable practices; out of rever$$ce for St. Thomas and the church over which you pre&s;ide, we have delayed taking vengeance upon you by virtue of our own power; but have remitted you to the pope, who we tru&s;t will revenge our injur$es, and treat you as you de&s;erve: we exclude you from our protection and clemency; you have been always mercile&s;s, and have no<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> title to mercy." Such an har&s;h reply mu&s;t have been extremely mortifying, and doubtle&s;s intimidated the archbi&s;hop. Such was the inveteracy of the king's revenge, that the monks of Canterbury were ejected from their con|vent, for having treated him with common humanity in his di&s;tre&s;s, and the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was dive&s;ted of his temporalities, and deprived of the king's protection, becau&s;e he interceded for the metropolitan, and chanced to call him his lord, in the cour&s;e of his mediation. When Winchel&s;ey appear|ed at Rome, the pope treated him with equal &s;everity; and, in all likelihood, his r$in would have been inevitable, had not a di&s;pute happened between his holine&s;s and Edward, about the temporalities of the &s;ee, which the king retain|ed in his own hands, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of the nuncios who had been &s;ent over for the admini&s;tration of the dioce&s;e. His holine&s;s, nettled at Edward's inter$eri$g on this occa&s;ion, removed the &s;piritual &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; and even then he ref$$ed to re&s;tore the temporalities, until the pope in&s;i&s;ted upon his right &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, that the king, rather than run the risk of an open rupture, agreed that the profits of the &s;eque&s;tration &s;hould be payed into the hands of his agent, provided he would give a fair account of what &s;hould be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> received.</P>

<P>From this $eriod the good under&s;tanding between the courts of Rome and England $word$ to decrea&s;e till the death of Edward, though Win|chel&s;ey &s;till continue$ $n di&s;grace. In the la&s;t parliament of his reign, con|vened at Carlile, the remarkable &s;tatute De A&s;portatis Religio&s;orum was en|acted in con&s;equence of the remon&s;trance and complaint of the barons and laity,
<PB N="$" REF="1210">
who repre&s;ented that the &s;uperiors of the $span$ $$$$ding on t$e conti|nent, had made a practice of cro&s;&s;ing into Eng$$nd; and, und$r p$$tence of vi&s;itation, exacted &s;everal contributions from the ho$&s;es o$ $word$ $e&s;pective or|ders e&s;tabli&s;hed in this kingdom. That &s;ame parliament deliberated upon the exactions of the pope, which were managed by his nuncio Te&s;ta. They were dige&s;ted into &s;even articles, giving an account of the great number of the be&s;t &s;piritual preferments, which the pope had granted by way of provi&s;ion to Ita|lians, foreigners, and non re&s;idents, in prejudice and di&s;heri&s;on of the found|ers, benefactors, and &s;uch as had the rights of advow&s;on; of the rents and re|venues of religious hou&s;es, which the pope intended to apply to the u&s;e of divers cardinals; of the fir&s;t-fruits of vacant benefices, re&s;erved to the pope, and col|lected with the utmo&s;t rigour; of the Peter-pence exacted to treble the original value; of legacies for pious u&s;es, extorted from te&s;tators, exacted by the au|thority of the &s;ee of Rome, and converted to other u&s;es, contrary to the inten|tion of the te&s;tator; of the illegal recovery of debts, by bribing the pope's clerks to &s;ummon and di&s;train the creditor, to the di&s;heri&s;on of the king and his crown; and of legacies bequeathed in general terms, which the pope and clerks iniquitou&s;ly appropriated to them&s;elves, or converted to u&s;es contrary to the will of the decea&s;ed. Te&s;ta, the pope's agent, being brought before the parliament, and examined touching the&s;e mal-practices, did not pretend to deny the charge, but ju&s;tified his conduct in affirming that he acted by the pope's authority. It was therefore re&s;olved that the afore&s;aid grievances, oppre&s;&s;ions, injuries, and extortions, ought not to be permitted in the kingdom; and Te&s;ta was enjoined to revoke and annual all &s;uch extortions practi&s;ed by him&s;elf, his commi&s;&s;aries, mini&s;ters, vicegerents, adherents, and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and &s;afely depo&s;ite the money he had levied, until he &s;hould receive further directions from his maje&s;ty. A remon&s;trance upon this &s;ubject was drawn up, in the form of a letter from the parliament to the pope; and all the agents of Te&s;ta were ordered to be pro&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. The&s;e vigorous mea|&s;ures were owing intirely to the &s;pirit of the people, and not at all agreeable to the king, the &s;ituation of who&s;e affairs in Scotland and Guienne would not admit of a rupture with the pope. He therefore, after the rece&s;s of par|liament, put a &s;top to the writs of pro&s;ecution, granted a protection to the per|&s;on of Te&s;ta, and Amalmeni the other agent of the pope, and granted divers privileges to the court of Rome, which were altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the proceedings of parliament. The agents grew in&s;olent upon this triumph over the con&s;titution, and the papal tyranny revived: but, by this time the people were better informed; they adhered to the re&s;olutions of the parliament, and refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the impo&s;ition of the papal agents. Both &s;ides pre|&s;ented addre&s;&s;es to the king, who found the popular re&s;entment &s;o warm, that far from countenancing the agents in their oppre&s;&s;ion, he inhibited them from proceeding to exact the annates or fir&s;t-fruits of benefices, and interfere with the patronage of the king or his &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward II. to the crown of England, the pope de&s;ired to know whether the accu&s;ation brought by the late king again&s;t Winchel&s;ey &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted or dropped; and Edward not only &s;ent an an&s;wer in favour of the culprit, but al&s;o invited him, by the appellation of Father, to return and re&s;ume the dignities and duties of his function. Win|chel&s;ey
<PB N="120" REF="1220">
did not fail to comply with this invitation; and, at his return to England, received all the temporalities whi$h had been &s;eq$e&s;tered while his cau$e was depending. Immediately a$ter h$s re&s;toration, he convoked a &s;ynod at Winche&s;ter, where, among other canons, a very curious con&s;titution was enacted again&s;t the abjuration of fornicators. By an old regulation two per|&s;ons convi$ted of carnal commerce were obliged to abjure each other's com|pany; and this was the extent of their puni&s;hment: but the clergy finding by experience that this abjuration encouraged perjury in the parties, who &s;eldom $$r$pled to break the oath for the gratification of their unruly de&s;ires, it was fo$nd nece&s;&s;ary to lay a&s;ide the abjuration, and decree corporal puni&s;hment again&s;t fornicators for the &s;econd and third offence; but the $ourth could be no other way attoned than by a marriage between the parties, who, at the &s;e|cond relap&s;e, engaged in a conditional contract of matrimony, to take effect<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> from the date of the fourth tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. It was at this junct$re, that in a &s;y|nod a&s;&s;embled at London, the Templars were condemned to perpetual impri|&s;onment, notwith&s;tanding the candid report which was made in their favour by Greenfield archbi&s;hop of York, who, together with the bi&s;hop of London, had been commi&s;&s;ioned to examine their doctrines and conduct. Though Winchel&s;ey &s;eized every opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his gratitude to Edward II. and exerted all his influence to allay the animo&s;ity between the king and peo|ple, with re&s;pect to Gave&s;ton's bani&s;hment, he would not recede from any part of the honour which he thought due to the dignity of his character, even when Edward took umbrage at his inflexibility. He refu&s;ed to attend a par|liament, in which the archbi&s;hop of York appeared with his cro&s;s borne before him; and being &s;econded by the clergy of his province, Edward was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s the other metropolitan. He afterwards thwarted the king's inclina|tions, by adhering to Peckham's con&s;titution again&s;t pluralities, which Ed|ward de&s;ired him to wave in behalf of a favourite chaplain; and &s;o long as he lived he tenaciou&s;ly &s;upported the rights and privileges of the clergy again&s;t all oppo&s;ition. His private conduct was certainly irreproachable: he cen&s;ured &s;inners without re&s;pect of per&s;ons; he rewarded merit; di&s;couraged all in|trigues for church-preferment; and after his death, his memory was held in &s;uch veneration, that miracles were &s;aid to be performed at his tomb, which was at length pulled down, that it might no longer encourage the &s;uper&s;tition of the populace.</P>

<P>About this period, the famous &s;tatute called Articuli Cleri was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The &s;tatute is couched in form of a petition to the king; and his an&s;wer is &s;ubjoined to every article. They complained that the king's ju&s;tices intermeddled in te&s;tamentary cau&s;es, and took cognizance of tythes; that eccle&s;ia&s;tics were charged towards the king's carriages; that the king's mills were exempted from the payment of tythes; that clerks attend|ing on the exchequer could not re&s;ide in their benefices; that, upon their de|cea&s;e, their effects were &s;eized until their accounts were made up; that eccle|&s;ia&s;tical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were wa&s;ted during vacancies; that clerks were admitted to free chapels by laymen; that the king's judges tried cau&s;es of u&s;ury, defama|tion, violence offered to eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &s;acrilege, oblations, fences of church|yards and mortuaries; that prohibitions were granted without &s;urmi&s;e; that clerks were &s;ummoned to an&s;wer in the king's court, and though acquitted, the informers e&s;caped with impunity; that clerks were not allowed their clergy; that, after purgation, clerks were que&s;tioned in the king's court for the &s;ame offence; that per&s;ons were be&s;ieged in &s;anctuary; that the writ De Cautione admittenda was i&s;&s;ued forth, although the church was not &s;atisfied; and excom|municated per&s;ons were relea&s;ed from pri&s;on in the &s;ame irregular manner; that cau&s;es relating to debts between eccle&s;ia&s;tics, were de$ermined in the tem|poral courts; that bi&s;hops were compelled by di&s;tre&s;s to be forthcoming for the appearance of clerks in the lay courts, even without cau&s;e; that the church forfeited its right, by the cea&s;ing of rent or pen&s;ion for the &s;pace of two years; that nuns were compelled to &s;ue in lay-courts, for the rights of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion de|volving to them by the decea&s;e of their kindred; that churches were deprived of their privileges, in default of &s;hewing the Quo Warranto by which they were held; that the proceedings of eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges were &s;topped by &s;he|riffs and noblemen; that the refu&s;als of bi&s;hops, touching clerks pre&s;ented, were examined in lay-courts; that religious hou&s;es were oppre&s;&s;ed, by their patrons living upon them at free quarter; that bigamy and ba&s;tardy were tried in lay-courts; that the king's livings remained long vacant; and that the clergy were injured by the &s;tatute of Mortmain. It was for the redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances, that Edward pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tatute of Articuli Cleri, which, in all pro|bability, the clergy owed to the civil di&s;tractions of the kingdom, during which the king could not venture to di&s;oblige &s;uch a formidable body, whole cau&s;e the pope had e&s;pou&s;ed: neverthele&s;s he made &s;ome efforts again&s;t the $n|croachments of the papal authority.

<P>In the beginning of the third Edward's reign, while the queen &s;at at the helm of government, the pope was thwarted in his de&s;igns upon the &s;ee of Exeter.

Mepham canon of Chiche&s;ter was elected as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the &s;ee of Canterbury, and by dint of money procured the confirmation of the pope at Avignon. At his return to England, he held a provincial council at St. Paul's in London, where the anniver&s;ary of the Conception was appointed as a fe&s;tival; &s;everal con&s;titutions were enacted again&s;t violators of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical immunities, and tho&s;e who ob&s;tructed the te&s;taments of villains apper|tinent to lands, or of any other of a &s;ervile condition. In the cour&s;e of this year, a di&s;pute happened between the crown, and Lewis Beaumont bi&s;hop of Durham. The king had ordered the e&s;tates of &s;everal traitors to be &s;eized within the bi&s;hopric, and Lewis oppo&s;ing the&s;e proceedings as contrary to the privilege of the dioce&s;e, which was a county palatine, the cau&s;e was heard be|fore the lords, who gave judgment in favour of the bi&s;hop. Mepham pro|ceeded with a high hand in making his vi&s;itations to the dioce&s;es of Roche&s;ter, Chiche&s;ter, Sali&s;bury, Bath and Wells, but was oppo&s;ed with an armed force by Grandi&s;on bi&s;hop of Exeter, who enjoyed the king's countenance; &s;o that the metropolitan was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and died in a little time after this di&s;|pute. The king recommended John Stratford, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, as a per&s;on fit to fill the &s;ee of Canterbury; and this prelate being approved by the pope and the monks of Chri&s;t Church, the &s;ee of Winche&s;ter was be&s;towed upon Adam Orleton bi&s;hop of Hereford, who had been &s;o in&s;trumental in the death of Edward II. As the reigning king had given orders to pro&s;ecute all who were &s;u&s;pected of having been concerned in the murder of his father, he affected di&s;plea&s;ure at Orleton's promotion; and he was impeached in the court of Rome in &s;everal articles, to which he gave &s;uch an&s;wers as were &s;atisfactory; for the pro&s;ecution was dropped, and he continued to have a large &s;hare in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

A fray en&s;uing, the town&s;man a&s;&s;embled his fellow citizens, who were joined by two thou&s;and people from the country: the &s;cholars were routed, mur|dered, their books and writings de&s;troyed, and the whole univer&s;ity, except Merton-College, was intirely de&s;erted. Inquiry being made into this affair by the king's order, the town&s;men were found to be the aggre&s;&s;ors. The bi&s;hop of Linco$n laid the city under an interdict; judges were &s;ent down to try the r$oters; the magi&s;trates and high &s;heriff of the county were di&s;charged from their offices; and both city and univer&s;ity re&s;igned all their rights, privileges, and e&s;tates, into the king's hands, that he might di&s;po&s;e of them according to<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 13$$.</NOTE> his good plea&s;ure. The &s;cholars were honourably acquitted; and with re&s;pect to the town&s;men, the king and council at We&s;tmin&s;ter, decreed that they &s;hould be fined in two hundred and fifty pounds by way of damages; that the effects taken from the &s;tudents &s;hould be re&s;tored; and that tho&s;e who were charged with murder and ma$ming &s;hould give &s;ecurity for &s;tanding trial. Many li|bert$$s of the city were granted to the univer&s;ity; and the mayor with &s;ixty|three burge&s;&s;es, were ordered by the bi&s;hop of Lincoln to repair to St. Mary's altar every year, on the tenth day of February, and offer &s;ixty-three pence, for &s;o many ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for the &s;ouls of the &s;cholars who had been murdered.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> In con&s;ideration of this penance, the interdict was taken off, and the &s;cholars returned to the univer&s;ity, the privileges of which were now greatly enlarged.</P>

<P>About this period died William Bateman bi&s;hop of Norwich, a prelate of untainted morals, and an eminent patron of learning; but &s;o rigo|rous in the performance of his function, that he obliged the lord Morley, a favourite of king Edward, who had &s;hot &s;ome of his deer, to do public pe|nance, by walking barefoot, with a taper in his hand, through the city of Norwich to the cathedral, where he a&s;ked pardon of the bi&s;hop for his offence. The king i&s;&s;ued a writ, commanding him to di&s;pen&s;e with the performance of this penance, but he payed no regard to the mandate; and even refu&s;ed to
<PB N="125" REF="1270">
comply, after the king had &s;eized his temporalities. Though Edward was at fir&s;t provoked at his inflexibility, he could not help admiring his fortitude, and not only re&s;tored his temporalities, but al&s;o employed him in the manage|ment of &s;ome important &s;tate affairs. He had obtained a bull from pope Clement VI. annexing to his &s;ee the fir&s;t fruits of all the vacant benefices in his dioce&s;e; and he died at Avignon, where he chanced to be on an emba&s;&s;y to the pope. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame year, Fitz-Ralph archbi&s;hop of Ar|magh in Ireland di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by oppo&s;ing, with great &s;pirit, the principles of the Mendicants, whom he accu&s;ed of encroaching upon the bi&s;hops and parochial clergy; and of engaging in a voluntary vow of beg|gary, which was contrary to the dictates of rea&s;on and &s;cripture. The order being in high favour with the pope, procured a citation to the archbi&s;hop, &s;ummoning him to appear before his holine&s;s at Avignon, to an&s;wer for the propo&s;itions he had advanced. He obeyed the mandate, and maintained his a&s;&s;ertions with great energy and learning. He moreover expo&s;ed the igno|rance and immorality of the Mendicants, to the conviction of all mankind: but they were too hard for him in point of intere&s;t; and he died at Avigno$, without having been able to prevent the confirmation of their privileges.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the bi&s;hop of Ely involved him&s;elf in a long train of pro&s;ecutions, by incurring the king's di&s;plea&s;ure. He was con|victed of having abetted certain incendiaries, who had burned &s;ome hou&s;es belonging to the lady Blanche Wake, daughter of the duke of Lanca&s;ter. The cau&s;e was afterwards reheard, upon a commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer; but the court would not rever&s;e the &s;entence, becau&s;e the record of the former trial could not be found. The bi&s;hop being a man of an impatient temper, hurried up to court, and reproached the king for denying him ju&s;tice. Ed|ward, incen&s;ed at his pre&s;umption, ordered him to be pro&s;ecuted before the parliament. Though the offence was plainly proved, and the other bi&s;hops interceded for him on their knees, he refu&s;ed to join in the &s;upplication; and the king was provoked afre&s;h at the in&s;olence of his deportment. Imme|diately after this trial, he was pro&s;ecuted for harbouring an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who had murdered a dome&s;tic of the lady Wake; and, as the parliament was not &s;itting, he was denied the privilege of being tried by his peers. He had re|cour&s;e to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, de&s;iring he might be admitted to his purgation, by &s;wearing him&s;elf innocent, or by the oaths of twelve re&s;pon|&s;ible compurgators: but the metropolitan being afraid of embroiling him&s;elf with Edward, declined granting his reque&s;t, and advi&s;ed him to throw him|&s;elf on the king's mercy. The haughty prelate would not &s;toop to this con|de&s;cen&s;ion, but fled to Avignon, where he intere&s;ted the pope &s;o warmly in his behalf, that the king's ju&s;tices were &s;ummoned to appear before his holi|ne&s;s, and give an account of their proceedings again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Ely. The judges di&s;regarding this citation, the pope excommunicated their per&s;ons, and laid their e&s;tates under interdict; and the king being unwilling to break with the court of Avignon, ordered his agents to compromi&s;e the affair; but the bi&s;hop died before an accommodation could be effected. Archbi&s;hop I&s;lip not only reformed the di&s;cipline of the church, by watching over the morals of the cl$rgy, and publi&s;hing &s;ome whole&s;ome con&s;titutions again&s;t the avarice, &s;loth, and extravagance of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, but likewi&s;e acted up to

He oppo&s;ed the prince of Wales, who had &s;eized the temporalities of the &s;ee of St. David's during a vacancy, and even obliged him to give them up. The counte&s;s of Kent, after her hu&s;band's death, had taken the veil, but afterwards becoming ena|moured of a French gentleman, called Eu&s;tace Abricourt, &s;he married him in private. Though the archbi&s;hop did not di&s;&s;olve the marriage, he impo&s;ed $evere corporal penance upon the parties, and obliged them to undergo them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>At I&s;lip's decea&s;e, William Addington bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was cho&s;en as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but he declining the dignity, it was conferred upon Stephen Langham bi&s;hop of Ely, and at that time chancellor of England. Immediately after his elevation, when the war with France was renewed, the king publi&s;hed an order, requiring all the prelates to appear per&s;onally in de|fence of the realm, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be invaded; and take care that their te|$ants, dependents, monks, vicars, curates, and all other per&s;ons appertaining to $o$y church, &s;hould be prepared with arms to take the field again&s;t the ene$y. La$gham had not enjoyed his dignity above one year, when the k$ng &s;eized his temporalities for having accepted a cardinal's hat without his kno$$edge. He &s;ubmitted to the king's plea&s;ure; and, after having for &s;ome time li$$d a private li$e at Oxford, retired to Avignon, where he was created bi$$$p of Praene&s;te, though he did not long &s;urvive his promotion: he was &s;ucc$$d$d by William Wittle&s;ey, a prelate of an inoffen&s;ive character, who $word$ $$ttle el&s;e than the exerci&s;e of his pa&s;toral function. At this juncture $$ed John Thort$y archbi&s;hop of York, a man of elegance and learning, and a pro$e$$ed enemy to the Friars Mendicant, an order which was by this time become a public nu&s;ance to the kingdom: he was a benefactor to the cathe|dral of York, and publi&s;hed a &s;et of dioce&s;an con&s;titutions which are &s;till ex|tant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The provi&s;ions made again&s;t papal encroachments were &s;o ill executed, that foreigners engr$&s;&s;ed all the be&s;t livings in England; and the freedom of eccle&s;ia&s;tical elections was almo&s;t utterly de&s;troyed. Edward had made re|peated remon&s;trances to the pope on this &s;ubject, but received no &s;atisfaction; &s;o that the nation was filled with clamour and di&s;content. The king i&s;&s;ued a writ, to inquire into the number and value of the benefices in England po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by foreig$ers; and an incredible number appeared to be in the hands of aliens, and even of &s;uch as were non-re&s;ident. Deputies were &s;ent to the court of Avignon, to complain of this $&s;urpation, and de&s;ire the pope to de|$i&s;t from his provi$$$ns and re&s;ervations; but they trifled away their time in &s;uch a manner, that the parliament began to think there was a collu&s;ion be|tween the pope and th$ mini&s;try. They pre&s;ented a &s;trong remon&s;trance to the king, compla$ning that all the papal power in England was exerted to the di&s;|adv$$tage of the kingdom; a$d that the immen&s;e &s;ums it yearly payed to the pope w$re e$ployed to &s;upport the enemies of the nation; that there was &s;carce one car$$nal in the conclave who did $ot po&s;&s;e&s;s livings in England, yet a$l of the$ a$hered to the ene$ies of t$e $ou$try: they therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon a law, by which ban$$hment &s;hould be $word$ upon all $ho&s;e who &s;up|ported the pope in h$s c$aim $$on $word$ of b$nefi$es and provi&s;ions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$.

Gregory XI. who had lately &s;ucceeded pope Urban, re&s;olved to improve this mi&s;under&s;tanding between Edward and the monks of Canter|bury; and propo&s;ed that Simon Sudbury &s;hould be tran&s;lated from the dioce&s;e of London to the &s;ee of Canterbury, without paying any regard to the monki&s;h election, which he looked upon as an ob&s;truction to the papal power in England. Edward inadvertently embraced this in&s;idious propo&s;al; and Sudbury, otherwi&s;e Tibbald, was con&s;ecrated metropolitan, contrary to the inclinations of the people, who had no other objection to his per&s;on but the manner in which he was elevated to that dignity. He was &s;ucceeded in the &s;ee of London by Courtenay, &s;on to the earl of Devon&s;hire, a prelate of un|common &s;pirit and capacity.</P>

<P>By this time Wickliff began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his doc|trines, under the protection of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who had provided $or him in the rectory of Lutterworth, in the dioce&s;e of Lincoln. He is &s;aid to have quarrelled with a monk about the rector&s;hip of Canterbury college in Oxford; his antagoni&s;t being &s;upported by the archbi&s;hop and the monks of Canterbury, the di&s;pute was appealed to the pope, who decided it again&s;t Wickliff, and thenceforward became the object of his implacable revenge. This &s;eems to be no more than a malicious imputation forged by Wickliff's enemies; for he had avowed his tenets, and even made &s;ome pro&s;elytes in England, before the date of this contention. He maintained that the bread and wine in the euchari&s;t was not the real &s;ub&s;tance, but only a type of Chri&s;t's body: that the church of Rome is not &s;upreme over all other churches; and that Chri&s;t did not give greater power to Peter than to the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles: that a lay-patron may lawfully and meritoriou&s;ly dive&s;t a degenerate church of her temporalities: that the go&s;pel is &s;ufficient for regulating the life and morals of every chri&s;tian; and that all other rules of &s;anctity add no more perfection to the go&s;pel, than whitene&s;s adds to a wall: that neither the pope, nor any chri&s;tian prelate, ought to puni&s;h or confine delinquents; but that every indi|vidual &s;hould do what&s;oever &s;eemed good in his own eyes, until he is appre|hended by the civil magi&s;trate. Wickliff and his followers affected a remark|able<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bibliotheque Angloite.</NOTE> au&s;terity in their way of living, which impre&s;&s;ed the vulgar with an high opinion of their &s;anctity; and the doctrine in favour of lay-patrons was &s;o agreeable to the nobility in general, who wanted to humble the clergy, that he &s;oon numbered a va&s;t multitude of common people, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful lords of the kingdom, among his converts. The pope being in|formed of his tenets and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ent a bull, directed to the metropolitan of Canterbury and the bi&s;hop of London, requiring them to &s;eize and &s;ecure the per&s;on of this arch-heretic; and they, unwilling to proceed at once to extre|mities, contented them&s;elves with &s;ummoning him to a &s;ynod convened at St. Paul's in London. Thither he went, accompanied by his two chief patrons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1377.</NOTE> the duke of Lanca&s;ter and the lord Percy, who in&s;i&s;ted upon Wickliff's being &s;eated, although he appeared as a delinquent; and endeavoured to intimi|date the bi&s;hop of London, by unmanly threats and boi&s;terous language, which excited no pa&s;&s;ion but contempt in that &s;pirited prelate, who knew he had nothing to fear from their re&s;entment, while he retained his popularity. The lower cla&s;s of people in London had not yet imbibed the doctrines of
<PB N="128" REF="1300">
Wickliff, whom they were taught to dete&s;t as an impious heretic; and, being warmly attached to the per&s;on of the bi&s;hop, they had crouded the &s;treets in &s;uch a manner, that the duke of Lanca&s;ter could hardly find ad|mittance. When they under&s;tood that the di&s;pute began to grow warm between him and the prelate, and were informed that Lanca&s;ter had even threatened to pull him out of the church by the hair of the head, they im|mediately took the alarm, and grew &s;o ob&s;treperous, that the duke and lord Percy, with their favouri$e Wickliff, were $ain to retreat in a hurry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> though the &s;ynod inflicted no other puni&s;hment but that of impo&s;ing &s;ilence upon this new apo&s;tle.</P>

<P>WHEN Edward III. re&s;igned his breath, his grand&s;on and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1377.</NOTE> Richard II. had not yet attained the tenth year of his age; and, as his uncle John of Ghent had all the power of England in his hands, he might, in imitation of &s;everal princes who had a&s;cended the Engli&s;h throne, have &s;et a&s;ide the lineal heir without the lea&s;t difficulty, had he been really in|fected with that ambition of reigning, which had been fixed as an imputation upon his character. This charge he owed to the re&s;entment of the monks and clergy, who hated him as the protector of Wickliff. He had, moreover, ac|quired a great number of enemies by the pride, arrogance, and ira&s;cibility of his temper; and he was particularly dete&s;ted by the citizens of London for the vengeance he had taken on account of the late in&s;urrection. We can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that he was intimidated from pur&s;uing his de&s;igns upon the crown by the &s;en&s;e of the nation, which adored the young Richard, both for his per&s;onal beauty and accompli&s;hments, and for the &s;ake of his father, who&s;e memory they revered, even to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The duke of Lanca&s;ter was naturally bold and confident$ and, upon all occa&s;ions, ex|pre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t contempt for the people: nor, indeed, could he have had any ju&s;t cau&s;e of appr$hen&s;ion from their enmity, while all the places of &s;trength in the kingdom were occupied by his creatures, and all the veteran officers at his devotion.</P>

<P>On the very day of Edward's death, John Philpot, with the principal citizens of London, deputed by the common council, repaired to King&s;ton upon Thames, where the young prince then re&s;ided, and implored his favour and protection to the city of London, expre&s;&s;ing their concern at his being re|moved &s;o far from the capital, and a&s;&s;uring him they would venture their lives and fortunes for his &s;ervice. They concluded their addre&s;s with a peti|tion that he would take up his re&s;idence in the city, and put a &s;top to the pro|&s;ecutions which had been &s;et on foot by the duke of Lanca&s;ter. Their reque&s;t was granted, and all differences compromi&s;ed by commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent to Lon|don for that purpo&s;e; and Richard the very next day made a magnificent en|try into London, attended by the dukes of Lanca&s;ter and Brittany, the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the earls of Marche and Warwick, with many other noblemen. The duke &s;till continued at the head of the admini&s;tration, and i&s;&s;ued out orders for guarding the coa&s;t, erecting new beacons at convenient places, for the purpo&s;e of giving the alarm in ca&s;e the kingdom &s;hould be invaded, and even for arraying the clergy for the de|fence of their country. The&s;e precautions were highly nece&s;&s;ary; for the French, having equipped a navy, and being reinforced by the fleet of Ca&s;tile, &s;coured the channel, landed at Ha&s;tings, ravaged the i&s;le of Wight, and laid<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.

<P>It was in the mid&s;t of th$&s;$ ho&s;tilities that Richard &s;ucceeded to the thron$ of Eng$a$d, which he a&s;cended without th$ $$a$t oppo&s;ition; and the c$remony of his coronation was fixed for the &s;ixteenth day of July.

On the eve o$ the coronation, the king rode with a pom|pous cavalcade through the &s;treets of London, from the Tower to his palace at We$$min$$er. Next day h$ walk$d from thence in proce&s;&s;ion to the abbey|ch$r$h at W$$tmi$&s;ter; a$d, a&s;$ending a &s;caffold erected for that purpo&s;e, t$$k the u&s;ual oath, whi$h was admini&s;tred for that purpo&s;e by the arch|bi&s;hop, who afterwards pro$$eded to the ceremony of unction and coronation.

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>A parliament being called about Michaelmas, to concert mea&s;ures for oppo&s;ing the progre&s;s of the French, the commons would not give their opinions on the &s;ubject of their deliberations, without the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and a committee of four bi&s;hops, four earls, and as many barons, whom they nominated for that purpo&s;e; and the king who was pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al. Then the duke, falling upon his knees before his maje&s;ty, de&s;ired he might be excu&s;ed from a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the confe|rence, as the commons had traduced his character, and &s;u&s;pected him of having formed de&s;igns which amounted to high trea&s;on. He prote&s;ted his own innocence in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner; and declared that if any per&s;on would openly charge him with high trea&s;on, di&s;loyalty, or any action preju|dicial to the realm, he was ready to prove the fal&s;ity and malice of the accu|&s;ation, either in &s;ingle combat or in any other manner that the king and the lords &s;hould direct. The prelates and lords, &s;tanding up as one man, inter|rupted him in his harrangue, prote&s;ting they could not imagine any per&s;on upon earth would advance &s;uch a malicious charge; and the commons al|leged, that in chu&s;ing him as the principal coun&s;ellor, they had clearly mani|fe&s;ted their opinion of his honour. The duke, having repre&s;ented the evil con&s;equences of &s;uch reports as might create jealou&s;ies between the king and his be&s;t &s;ubjects, declared that he forgave the authors of &s;uch &s;lander, but ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that a law &s;hould be made again&s;t the inventors and propaga|tors of defamation. The commons, con&s;idering the &s;ituation of the kingdom and the minority of the king, propo&s;ed that certain per&s;ons of unblemi&s;hed morals and undoubted capacity &s;hould be appointed in parliament, as the king's con&s;tant coun&s;ellors, to act in the admini&s;tration, with the great offi|cers of the crown, and direct the application of the money granted for the pro&s;ecution of the French war. Nine per&s;ons were accordingly cho&s;en by the lords, and &s;worn of the council: their tru&s;t was limited to one year, during which they were ab&s;olutely prohibited from receiving any grant of lands, rent, e&s;cheat, ward, or marriage. The commons likewi&s;e petitioned that the parliament &s;hould appoint the &s;ervants of his maje&s;ty; that the charges of the hou&s;hold &s;hould be born by the revenue of the crown; and that the &s;upplies granted for the war &s;hould be applied to that purpo&s;e only. The lords de|clined joining in this motion, becau&s;e they thought it unrea&s;onable to place any &s;ervants about the king's per&s;on but &s;uch as he him&s;elf &s;hould approve; and with regard to the expences of the hou&s;hold they promi&s;ed to confer with the great officers, and inquire whether or not they might be honourably de|&s;rayed by the crown revenue. The next reque&s;t of the commons was, that during the king's minority, the chancellor, trea&s;urer, chief ju&s;tices, and other officers of the crown, &s;hould be appointed by parliament; but this mo|tion was likewi&s;e oppo&s;ed by the lords, who a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the right
<PB N="134" REF="1360">
of nominating the coun&s;ellors, chancellor, an$ &s;teward of the hou&s;hold, and in&s;i&s;t$$ upon leaving the other officers to the king's choice, with the advice and a&s;&s;ent of his council. Notwith&s;tanding this oppo&s;ition on the part of the lords, the commons voted a con&s;id$rab$y &s;upply for the defence of the kingdom, on condition that the money &s;hould be depo&s;ited in the hands of two tru&s;tees; and John Philpot and William Walworth merchants in London were appointed for that office. Having granted this aid, they thought they had a right to demand that the evil coun&s;ellors placed about the late king &s;hould $e removed, and their po&s;ts be&s;towed upon per&s;ons of good morals and i$t$grity. Several officers were di&s;placed in con&s;equence of this petition; but they did not &s;ucceed in another, reque&s;ting that a parliament &s;hould be con|v$$ed once a year to regulate the affairs of the nation, and determine tho&s;e cau&s;es about which the judges were divided in their opinions. In this a&s;&s;em|bly, Sir Richard Le&s;crop &s;teward of the hou&s;hold impeached Alice Perrers $word$ a breach of the ordinance which had been made expre&s;ly again&s;t her in t$e la&s;t parliament. She was accu&s;ed of having procured the pardon of Lyons, and an order to revoke the commi&s;&s;ion of Sir Nicholas Dagworth, who had been appointed to in&s;pect the admini&s;tration of her own hu&s;band William de Wind&s;or, in Ireland. She made no defence, nor did &s;he appear in per|&s;on or by proxy; the duke of Lanca&s;ter, though one of the committee ap|pointed to examine into the affair, conde&s;cended to give evidence in this cau&s;e. She was condemned to bani&s;hment, and all her e&s;tate &s;orfeited; but in the next parliament &s;he obtained a revi&s;ion of the trial and a rever&s;ion of the &s;entence, together with a full pardon to her&s;elf and hu&s;band. This affair being di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, the commons made remon&s;trances again&s;t papal u&s;urpation in pro|vi&s;ions, the admi&s;&s;ion of aliens into benefices, and the commutation of penance<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ P$$$.</NOTE> for money.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; V.</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after this &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up, the duke of Lanca&s;ter, on pretence of taking mea&s;ures for the defence of the kingdom and annoyance of the enemy, demanded an order from the lords of the council, to withdraw the money from the hands of the two tru&s;tees; and his de&s;ire being complied with, he engaged in the &s;ervice nine large &s;hips of Bayonne, with which he attacked a fleet of French merchantmen, and took fourteen ve&s;&s;els laden with wine. At the &s;ame time, alderman Philpot equipped a &s;mall armament at his own ex|pence; and &s;ailing in que&s;t of one Mercer, a Scotti&s;h mariner, who had greatly interrupted the navigation on the northern coa&s;ts of England, engaged and took him, together with fifteen Spani&s;h &s;hips which had entered into his &s;er|vice. This exploit, though univer&s;ally applauded by the people, gave um|brage to the government; and Philpot was &s;ummoned before the council-board, where he received a reprimand for having undertaken &s;uch an expedition con|trary to law; but in re&s;pect of his character, and the &s;ervice he had done the nation, he was no further que&s;tioned on the &s;ubject. The Scots not only com|mitted depredations on the &s;ea, but commenced ho&s;tilities at land, notwith|&s;tanding a truce which had been lately concluded between the two kingdoms. They $ound means to &s;urprize the town and ca&s;tle of Berwick; though this adventure was atchieved by a &s;mall number of freebooters, who had no com|mi&s;&s;ion from the government of Scotland; and the Scotti&s;h earl of Marche offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t the earl of Northumberland, in reducing the place under the
<PB N="135" REF="1370">
Engli&s;h dominion. The earl of Northumberland, a&s;&s;embling a body of ten thou&s;and men, marched to Berwick, and $word$ the ca$$le to &s;urrender, Ram&s;ay, who commanded the garri&s;on, $word$ that th$ place had been taken by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion from the king of France, in who&s;e name he would defend it to the la&s;t extremity. An a&s;&s;ault was immediately given, and the place being taken, every Scot was put to the &s;word. The earl, &s;u&s;pecting that the Scotti&s;h mini&s;try connived at Ram&s;ay's adventure, re&s;olved to cha&s;ti&s;e them for their in&s;incerity; and being joined by the earl of Nottingham, the lords Lacy, Neville, and Stratford, he began his march towards Mclro$s. Sir Thomas Mu&s;grave, being detached with &s;ix hundred men to reconn$itre the country, fell into an ambu&s;h laid by the earl of Douglas, who routed and took him pri&s;oner, and guarded the pa&s;&s;es in &s;uch a manner, that Percy thought proper to de&s;i&s;t from his enterprize, and return to England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>During the&s;e petty operations in the north, the duke of Lanca&s;ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1378.</NOTE> was employed in making gre$t preparations for invading the dominions of the French king, who had by this time reduced all the places belonging to the king of Navarre in Normandy, except Cherbourg, which was defended by an Engli&s;h garri&s;on. Charles of France had detected a plot, in which the king of Navarre had contrived to poi&s;on him. A dome&s;tic belonging to that prince, in the &s;ervice of his two &s;ons, who re&s;ided as ho&s;tages in Paris, was employed as the perpetrator of this &s;cheme, and being apprehended, at once confe&s;&s;ed the particulars: the &s;ecretary of the king of Navarre, being afterwards taken and put to the torture, confirmed the other's confe&s;&s;ion, and both were executed as traitors. The king of Navarre was &s;tripped of Normandy, and all the do|minions he held of France; and the king of Ca&s;tile fell upon Navarre, where he gained &s;everal con&s;iderable advantages. The duke of Lanca&s;ter having pro|vided his fleet and forces, &s;et &s;ail, about the latter end of July, for St. Malo, which was then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French, and took or de&s;troyed a fleet of French and Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, lying laden with wine and other commodities in the harbour: then landing his forces he inve&s;ted the city, which was defended by a brave officer, at the head of a numerous garri&s;on. The con&s;table of France, being then in Brittany, advanced with &s;ixteen thou&s;and choice troops, and encamped in &s;ight of the Engli&s;h, from whom he was divided by a rivulet. The duke of Lanca&s;ter endeavoured to provoke him to battle, which he &s;tu|diou&s;ly avoided, in obedience to the order he had received; but he po&s;ted him|&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that the be&s;iegers could not carry on their a&s;&s;aults, with|out dangerous interruption from his army, which he kept always in readine&s;s to &s;eize every advantage. At length the garri&s;on made a furious &s;ally, in which they de&s;troyed the works, and killed a great number of the be&s;iegers; a di&s;|a&s;ter which the duke imputed to the want of vigilance and conduct in the earl of Arundel, who commanded that night in the trenches. The Engli&s;h being di&s;pirited by this check, as well as by the vivacity of the con&s;table, by whom they were ince&s;&s;antly harra&s;&s;ed, and the winter approaching, it was re&s;olved, in a council of war, that the troops &s;hould be reimbarked; and the French allowed them to retire without mole&s;tation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">H. de Bretag.</NOTE></P>

<P>While the duke of Lanca&s;ter was engaged in this fruitle&s;s expedition, the reigning king of Ca&s;tile blocked up the harbour of Bayonne, with a fleet of two hundred ve&s;&s;els, and landing twenty thou&s;and men inve&s;ted the city, in
<PB N="136" REF="1380">
revenge for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance it had lately given to the Engli&s;h; but the king of $or$ugal threatening to invade Ca&s;t$le, the &s;ea&s;on of the year being pretty far a$vanced, an epid$mical di$ea$e having broke out among the Ca$$il$an troops, and the citizens making a gallant defence, he was obliged to abandon the enter|prize, and re$$rn to his own dominions. In Normandy, the duke of Berry u$de$$ook the &s;i$ge of Cherbourg, defended by Sir Robert Rou&s;e, who com|p$$$ed $$m to rai$e it with di&s;grace and damage, after having taken Oliver Du $word$ br$t$er to the con&s;table of France, while he reconnoitred the $word$ at the $ead of a con&s;iderable detachment. Rou&s;e was afterwards re|c$l$$d to En$$$nd, and the command of Cherbourg given to Sir Robert Har|$$$$$n, a ga$$$$t officer, who had the good fortune to rout and cut in pieces a b$$y of $rench troops, which he encountered in one of his excur&s;ions.</P>
<P N="8">$ VIII. The mi&s;carriage of the expedition to Brittany, which had co&s;t the $word$ $o much trea&s;ure, augmented the hatred of the people towards the duke $span$, whom they con&s;idered as the author of all the&s;e ruinous $word$ T$e Londoners were his inveterate foes; and their enmity had been $word$ in$$$med by an incident in which he was principally concerned. The $word$ $f D$nia, a Spani&s;h nobleman, taken at the battle of Najara, had been p$$$itt$d to return to his own country, on leaving his elde&s;t &s;on as ho&s;tage for hi$ r$n$om. The father happening to die before the money was remitted, and t$$ d$ke of Lanca&s;ter, who had preten&s;ions to the crown of Ca&s;tile, being de&s;irous of making a friend of the young count, who had great intere&s;t in that kingdom, pro$ured an order for his being relea&s;ed without ran&s;om. Hawley and Shakel, the two gentlemen who had taken the father in battle, being in$ormed of the duke's i$tention, repre&s;ented to the young Ca&s;tilian, the injury they &s;hould $u$tain by his relea&s;e. He was &s;o well convinced by their arguments, that h$ $e&s;olved to &s;acrifice his liberty to his honour, and immediately di&s;appeared. Several p$r&s;ons were confined in the Tower, on &s;u&s;picion of having been ac|c$&s;&s;ary to his e&s;cape; and at length a warrant was granted again&s;t Hawley and Sh$kel, who took re$$ge in We$$min&s;ter-abbey, from whence they could not be draw$, either by threats or intreaties. The king, at his uncle's reque&s;t, ordered Sir Al$an de Boxhul, with fi$ty men, to bring them out by force; and t$ough he found them at divine &s;ervice, he commanded his followers to drag them from the altar. Hawley and his &s;ervant were killed, after having made a ga$lant defence; and a prie&s;t who e&s;pou&s;ed his quarrel &s;hared the &s;ame fate, while Shakel was taken alive and carried to the Tower. Such violation of a &s;anctuary was deemed an inexpiable offence; and the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, with five of his &s;uffragans, excommunicated the perpetrators. A ter|rible clamour was rai&s;ed again&s;t the duke of Lanca&s;ter, as the contriver of this impious $acri$ege: neverth$leis he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign, and per&s;uaded the ki$g to propo&s;e to Shakel, that if he would produce his pri&s;oner, he &s;hould have five hu$dred marks in ready money, and enjoy a pen&s;ion of one hundred for life.

<P>The citizens of London had another additional motive of re&s;entment ag$in$t the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have prevailed upon the king to &s;ummon the en&s;uing parliament to meet at Glouce&s;ter, with a view to
<PB N="137" REF="1390">
mortify the city of London. The members being there a&s;&s;embled on the twen|tieth day of October, Richard Le&s;crop, &s;teward of the hou&s;hold, opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, repre&s;enting the danger to which the nation was expo&s;ed from the enemies that &s;urrounded it, and the con&s;iderable &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure Calais; and Bre&s;t, which, by a treaty with the duke of Bretagne, was depo&s;ited in the hands of the Engli&s;h, as well as Cherbourg; and for the de|fence of Bourdeaux and Bayonne, which were threatened by the duke of Anjou and the king of Ca&s;tile. The commons &s;u&s;pecting that part of the late &s;ub&s;idies had been embezzled, or converted to other u&s;es than tho&s;e for which they were granted, in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing in what manner tho&s;e &s;ums had been expended, and who were intended to fill the great offices of &s;tate for the en&s;uing year, according to the ordinance of the la&s;t parliament. Le&s;crop an&s;wered, in the king's name, that although no account of &s;ub&s;idies or other grants had ever been made to the commons, William Walworth, in conjunction with &s;ome members of the council, &s;hould lay before them an account of the receipts and di&s;bur&s;ements; but that &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;hould not be drawn into precedent. He told them, that the officers of &s;tate had been cho&s;en by the advice of the lords, and the king would appoint the privy coun&s;ellors according to his own judgment; but if the commons found any thing defective either in the laws or the admini&s;tration, they might repre&s;ent it in the u&s;ual form of petition; and their grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed. Then they de&s;ired a copy of the enrol|ment of the la&s;t &s;ub&s;idy, that they might deliberate upon the &s;ubject; and this reque&s;t being granted as a &s;pecial favour, they took exceptions to the &s;um of &s;ix and forty thou&s;and pounds expended upon fortre&s;&s;es abroad, which they alledged ought to have been maintained out of the king's own revenue and pa|trimonial e&s;tate. After the&s;e deliberations, the parliament granted a con&s;ider|able aid on wool and leather, be&s;ides an additional duty upon merchandize for one year; but this was in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion revoked, and in lieu of it, a poll-tax laid upon all orders of men throughout the kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>The nation was now animated with the keene&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t France, which had pre&s;umed to in&s;ult her late conquerors. An Engli&s;h fleet from Rye and Winchel&s;ea &s;coured the channel in their turn, and even made de&s;cents upon the coa&s;t of Normandy, where they took and plundered the towns of Port St. Pierre and Willet, and rai&s;ed contributions on the adjacent country. Sir Hugh Calverly, governor of Calais, pillaged the great fair at Sta|pal, burned the &s;uburbs of St. Omer, and &s;urprized a great convoy of pro|vi&s;ion and ammunition, de&s;igned for the town of Ardres. This gallant officer<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>This &s;entence was extremely di&s;agreeable, even to tho&s;e lords of Brit|tany who had been hitherto attached to the intere&s;t of Charles. He had not con&s;ulted them on this occa&s;ion; and when he afterwards &s;ent for them to court, and tried to cajole them with promi&s;es of favour, they loudly com|plained of his having proceeded to &s;uch extremities without their concurrence, refu&s;ed to put his troops in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ca&s;tles, for the defence of the country again&s;t the attempts of the Engli&s;h and Montfort, and retiring to Brittany, engaged in a&s;&s;ociations to maintain their liberties again&s;t all incroach|ment. They even renounced all dependence upon the crown of France, and &s;ent a deputation to England, inviting their duke to return to his own domi|nions, where they would &s;upport him with their lives and fortunes. John could not help di&s;tru&s;ting the &s;incerity of this profe&s;&s;ion, made by people who had &s;o long acted as his open enemies; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the deputies, with a gene|ral promi&s;e of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea with the fir&s;t favourable opportunity. Before they returned, the king of France had &s;ent commi&s;&s;aries into Bretagne, to execute the &s;entence of confi&s;cation; and at the &s;ame time letters patent were publi&s;hed, confirming all the privileges of the nobility. But even this indulgence could not induce them to &s;ubmit; and the French government was &s;o odious to the people, that the commi&s;&s;aries, being denied admittance into Nantes and other places, were ob$iged to return to Anjou, without having executed their com|mi&s;&s;ion. A war being the immediate con&s;equence of this oppo&s;ition, the e&s;tates of Brittany &s;ent a &s;olemn invitation in writing, under the &s;eals of the principal nobility, to the duke, pre&s;&s;ing him to return without delay, and a&s;|&s;uring him, that all the barons and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable towns of the pro|vince, would declare for him at his landing. John, at length convinced of their attachment, embarked at Southampton, with Sir Robert Knolles and a &s;mall body of troops, and landing at Solidor, in the neighbourhood of St. Malo, was received with joyful acclamation. Dinan, Rennes, and Vannes, opened their gates to their &s;overeign: he was joined by almo&s;t the whole no|ble&s;&s;e of the province; the Bretons in the French &s;ervice de&s;erted to him in &s;uch numbers that Charles di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all that remained, becau&s;e he could not de|pend upon their fidelity. By the&s;e the duke's army was con&s;iderably reinforced: towns and fortre&s;&s;es daily declared in his favour; nor could the forces, under the duke of Bourbon and the con&s;table Du Gue&s;clin prevent this almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al defection. In this emergency the duke of Anjou, advancing to the frontiers of Brittany, endeavoured to conciliate the affection of the natives, by promi&s;es of favour and profe&s;&s;ions of good will; and a negotiation was &s;et on &s;oot, but France &s;till in&s;i&s;ting upon Brittany's being united to the crown, the conferences proved ineffectual.</P>

<P>The con&s;table advi&s;ed the king of France to pardon the duke of Bretagne, and detach him by dint of kind offices from his dependence upon England. In that ca&s;e he might engage the hardy &s;oldiers of that province in his &s;ervice, and employ his whole force in the reduction of Guienne, where the Engli&s;h had lately retaken &s;everal places of importance. Charles was
<PB N="139" REF="1410">
inclined to follow this advice; but in the mean time he &s;ent Gue&s;clin with a$ army to check the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h in that province. He undertook the &s;iege of Chateauneuf, which was gallantly defended; and in the cour&s;e of the operations he fell &s;ick and died, ju&s;t when the garri&s;on was on the point of demanding a capitulation. The French king had, by means of this great officer, begun to tamper with Montfort, who was not aver&s;e to an accom|modation; but the death of the con&s;table, and the duke's expectation of &s;uc|cours from England, rendered the treaty abortive. A con&s;iderable armament was actually intended for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but, a war breaking out between the count of Flanders and his &s;ubjects, the Flemings did not purcha&s;e &s;uch quantities of wool as they u&s;ed to employ; &s;o that the &s;ub&s;idy granted upon that commodity fell &s;hort of expectation, and the number of troops de&s;tined for Brittany was curtailed. Neverthele&s;s Sir John Arundel &s;et &s;ail in De|cember for that dutchy with a body of forces; but, being overtaken by a &s;torm, his fleet was di&s;per&s;ed and he him&s;elf peri&s;hed. Such was the di&s;tre&s;s of the government, that the king was obliged to pawn his jewels to rai&s;e mo|ney for this purpo&s;e, though no provi&s;ion was made for paying the garri&s;ons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.

<P>To remove the&s;e nece&s;&s;ities, and provide for the expence of the en|&s;uing campaign, a parliament was called at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and the &s;e&s;&s;ion opened by a &s;peech from the chancellor, who encouraged the commons to ex|plain their grievances; and gave them to under&s;tand that the king had ordered his great officers and others of his council to lay before them an accompt of the money received from the la&s;t &s;ub&s;idy, and of the manner in which it had been di&s;bur&s;ed. The commons, impatient under their burthen&s;ome taxes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1380.</NOTE> and di&s;liking the conduct and oeconomy of the council, moved that the king might be of age, and take upon him&s;elf the admini&s;tration, under the direction of the chancellor, trea&s;urer, privy &s;eal, chamberlain, and &s;teward of the hou&s;|hold, who &s;hould be appointed by parliament. Though this reque&s;t was de|nied, they obtained the renewal of a commi&s;&s;ion which in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion had been granted to &s;everal prelates and noblemen, impowering them to ex|amine into the &s;tate of the revenue, the expences of the king's hou&s;hold, the management of the war, and the conduct of officers. John Imperiale the Genoe&s;e amba&s;&s;ador having been murdered in the &s;treets of London, both hou&s;es joined in declaring the perpetrators guilty of high trea&s;on. The power of ju&s;tices of the peace was lodged in a new commi&s;&s;ion: a &s;tatute was enacted again&s;t papal provi&s;ions, in con&s;equence of the rapacious conduct of pope Urban, who had lately be&s;towed the archdeaconry of Bath upon the cardi|nal of Ci&s;teron, a profe&s;&s;ed enemy of the Engli&s;h, gratified another with the priory of Deerhu&s;t, and granted a great number of provi&s;ions to foreigners, in violation of the agreement between the late king and this pontiff's prede|ce&s;&s;or. After having made the&s;e regulations, the parliament voted a con&s;i|derable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl.</NOTE> aid, and continued the &s;ub&s;idy on wool for a year longer.</P>

<P>The&s;e &s;upplies, together with a tenth given by the clergy, enabled the mini&s;ters to equip a new armament for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the duke of Brittany. Thomas of Wode&s;toke earl of Buckingham was appointed commander in chief of the army, which con&s;i&s;ted of three thou&s;and archers, as many men at arms with their followers, and a numerous body of infantry. He was accompanied by
<PB N="140" REF="1420">
the lord Ba&s;&s;et, Sir Thomas Percy, Sir Hugh Calverly, Sir John Harle&s;ton, Sir Robert Knowles, Sir William de Wind&s;or, and a great number of young gentlemen, who &s;ought an opportunity to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in the &s;ervice. As the &s;hips were not &s;ufficient to tran&s;port &s;uch a numerous army with its ne|ce&s;&s;aries at once, the general could not &s;ail directly for Bretagne; but was obliged to wa$t over the troops at different times from Dover and Sandwich to Cala$s: and this method, together with &s;ome other unaccountable delays in the mini&s;try, detained the &s;oldiers &s;o long upon the coa&s;t, that numbers were obliged to pawn their arms for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This evil however was remedied by the zeal of &s;ome London merchants, and John Philpot in particular, who not only payed the debts of the &s;oldiery, and redeemed their arms, but al&s;o hired tran&s;ports to convoy them to the continent. The earl of Buckingham, landing at Calais in the latter end o$ July, tarried a few days until his army was r$tre&s;hed; and then began his march for Brittany. He met with no oppo&s;ition in his progre&s;s, though the dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon were po&s;ted with a &s;trong body of forces at Troyes. He propo&s;ed to attack them in their intrenchments; but they, being unwilling to &s;tand an attack, $e$ired within the walls of the city. Buckingham, having attempted in vain to provoke them to a general engagement, continued his march through Sens, from whence he proceeded through the Gatinois and Beauce into Le Maine; and pa&s;&s;ed the Sarte on the &s;ixteenth day of September, remarkable for the death of Charles V. king of France. That prince had lately by his emi&s;&s;aries excited the jealou&s;y and antient prejudice of the Bretons again&s;t the Engli&s;h, whom they repre&s;ented as cruel u&s;urpers who wanted to make a conque&s;t of their country; &s;o that the natives looked upon them with abhorrence, and the citizens of Nantes denied them admittance. John de Montfort, dreading the con&s;equences of this animo&s;ity, and believing it would be no difficult ta&s;k to effect an advantageous accommodation with the mini&s;try of the young French monarch, as yet a minor, was not a little perplexed in his mind with regard to his auxiliaries, and he&s;itated for &s;ome time between gratitude and convenience. In this irre&s;olution he continued, until the Engli&s;h had entered his dominions, and advanced to Chateubourg, between Vitr&eacute; and Rennes, where the earl of Buckingham received a &s;olemn deputation of his nobility, who a&s;&s;ured him their duke would meet him at Rennes; and excu&s;ed his not having waited upon him &s;ooner, by repre&s;enting the ill humour of his &s;ubjects, with whom he was obliged to keep mea&s;ures. This was actually the ca&s;e; for, when the earl arrived at Rennes, he and a few of his attendants only were &s;uffered to enter the place; nor did the duke as yet appear. He met him however at Mezieres, and frankly owned him&s;elf re&s;tricted by the malevolence and di&s;|$ffection of his people, over whom he had no influence. He profe&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of obligation to the court of England, and vowed eternal at|$achment to the intere&s;ts of a country which had afforded him an a&s;ylum in his di&s;tre&s;s; but his authority was not e&s;tabli&s;hed, his people were aver&s;e to the Engli&s;h, while his nobility him to &s;end them home immediately, and compromi&s;e his difference with the crown of France. Mean while, as Nantes had openly decl$red again&s;t the Engli&s;h, the earl propo&s;ed to undertake the $ege of that important city, and the duke promi&s;ed upon oath to &s;upply him with provi&s;ions, and join him in a fortnight. The place was accordingly
<PB N="141" REF="1430">
inve&s;ted; but, being &s;trongly fortified and provided with a numerous garri&s;on, the be&s;iegers made but very little progre&s;s, and lay before it two whole months without being joined by the duke. He had indeed endeavoured to rai&s;e for|ces for this purpo&s;e, but no body would repair to his &s;tandard; and the no|bility gave him to under&s;tand, that if he &s;hould pre&s;ume to join the enemies of his country, they would ri&s;e up in arms again&s;t him; whereas they would &s;erve him with all their power in effecting an accommodation with France. He was obliged to &s;ubmit to this propo&s;al, and abandon the earl of Bucking|ham, who &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of reducing Nantes, and finding him&s;elf hampered for want of provi&s;ions, by the activity of the Bretons, who generally inter|cepted his convoys, rai&s;ed the &s;iege during the Chri&s;tmas holidays, and marched to Vannes, where by the duke's influence he was ho&s;pitably received, and pro|vided with convenient quarters in that neighbourhood. Mean while a treaty was brought upon the carpet at Paris, for an accommodation between Mont|fort and the king of France. This being concluded and ratified, the duke con|&s;ented to do homage to the French king, and was rein&s;tated in his dutchy of Bretagne and county of Montfort. This agreement was in all probability<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1381.</NOTE> forwarded by a de&s;ign of the duke of Buckingham to bring another army in the &s;pring from England, as the treaty it&s;elf was managed without his know|lege. Though incen&s;ed at the clande&s;tine conduct of the duke, he did not think proper to manife&s;t his re&s;entment in any violent mea&s;ures; but, being &s;upplied with tran&s;ports by the duke, embarked his army, and on the eleventh<NOTE PLACE="marg">P.

<P>While the earl o$ Buckingham was employed in this fruitle&s;s expe|dition, the Scots made $rruptions into the northern counties, which they ra|vaged with fire and &s;word; and the earl of Northumberland, as warden of the Marches, began to a&s;&s;emble his forces to oppo&s;e the invaders; but, quar|relling with the inhabitants of Hull and Newca&s;tle, about a rich prize they had taken from the Scots at &s;ea, they thwarted his mea&s;ures in &s;uch a manner, that he could not collect a body of troops &s;ufficient to engage the enemy: and he received orders from the mini&s;try, commanding him to ob&s;erve the truce with the utmo&s;t punctuality. The Scots were &s;o far from acting with &s;uch a &s;crupulous regard to good faith, that they invaded We&s;tmoreland and Cum|berland, to the number of twenty thou&s;and, commanded by earl Douglas, who &s;urprized Penrith, wa&s;ted the country, and returned to Scotland with an immen&s;e booty; while the hands of the warden were tied up, by a fre&s;h order to avoid ho&s;tilities, until matters could be amicably compromi&s;ed. The duke of Lanca&s;ter is &s;aid to have been the author of the&s;e inglorious mea&s;ures, that the king's arms might be more di&s;engaged and at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his &s;cheme upon the crown of Ca&s;tile. This conjecture &s;eems to be confirmed by his &s;ub&s;equent conduct; for, when he him&s;elf marched to the north, at the head of a numerous army, towards the end of &s;ummer, in&s;tead of cha&s;|ti&s;ing the enemy, he propo&s;ed conferences for a peace. The&s;e were opened accordingly, and a truce being concluded fo$ three years, he di&s;banded hi$ $orces, and returned to the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom. While he wa$ ab&s;ent upon this expedition, the parliament met at Northampton; and, hav|ing deliberated upon the &s;tate of the nation, found that the debts incurred by the king, &s;ince the la&s;t &s;ub&s;idy, amounted to one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and

$oun$$ $word$ The commons de&s;ired the prelates and lords to con&s;ider in what manner t$e nec$&s;&s;ary &s;um could be rai&s;ed with the lea&s;t inconvenience to the people; and$ after due deliberation, they propo&s;ed a taillage on every per&s;on, male and female, above the age of fifteen. This propo&s;al was ap|proved; and the parliament e&s;tabli&s;hed a poll-tax of three groats upon every per&s;on of the realm, to be levied on each town by collectors appointed for that purpo&s;e. The more &s;ub&s;tantial people were enjoined to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poorer &s;ort, according to the value of their e&s;tates; and the product of the tax was appro|priated to the payment of arrears due to the army of the earl of Buckingham, the equipment of a fleet, and the defence of the kingdom.</P>

<P>This impo&s;ition gave birth to tho&s;e commotions which had like to have de&s;troyed the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. The copyholders and land-tenants in villenage, belonging to the church as well as to lay-lords, had become wealthy, and, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, made divers efforts to recover that freedom to which they thought they had a natural title. They purcha&s;ed exemplifi|cations in the king's court, out of Doom&s;day-book, of the manors and towns to which they belonged, exempting them from all manner of &s;ervitude; and would not &s;uffer di&s;tre&s;s to be taken, either by the &s;ervants of their lords, or the officers of ju&s;tice: they engaged in a&s;&s;ociations to &s;tand by one another, and even threatened their landlords $ith death and de&s;olation. The commons had, in the fir&s;t parliament of this reign, complained of the&s;e rebellious pro|ceedings, by which their property was alienated, their manors were ruined, and the peace of the nation endangered: a &s;tatute was enacted, declaring tho&s;e exemplifications of no validity, and ordering inquiry to be made after &s;uch a&s;&s;ociators and rebels, that they might be tried and brought to condign puni&s;hment. This law for &s;ome time &s;uppre&s;&s;ed their in&s;olence; though the late taxes which fell chiefly upon the lower tenants &s;erved to nouri&s;h their di&s;|contents: and the&s;e were fomented by &s;editious preachers, who a&s;&s;erted in their &s;ermons, that by nature all men were equal; that &s;ervitude was an unju&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, contrary to the will of God; and $$at it was their duty to &s;hake off the yoke, and maintain their birth-right. The minds of the vulgar were thus prepared for mi&s;chief, when the manner of collecting the poll-tax pro|voked them to open revolt and in&s;urrection. The king's nece&s;&s;ities being &s;o importunate, that he could not wait until the money &s;hould be collected, he farmed the tax to a &s;et of $apacious per&s;ons, who committed numberle&s;s acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, which drove the people to de&s;pair; and the mini&s;ters of &s;edition did not fail to inflame their pa&s;&s;ions of indignation and revenge.</P>

<P>The in&s;urrection began in E&s;&s;ex, where a report was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, implying, that the copyholders and pea&s;ants were doomed to death; that their hou&s;es would be burned, and their farms plundered. The country peo$le, alarmed at this intelligence, ro&s;e in their own defence, arming them|&s;elves with clubs, bows, &s;words, and halberds; and, a&s;&s;embling to the number of five thou&s;and, &s;ent deputies acro&s;s the river into Kent, de&s;iring the inhabitants of that county to join them in the common cau&s;e of liberty, that they might reform the &s;tate, and aboli&s;h taxes. This deputation was &s;ent in con&s;equence of an incident, which had already produced a tumult among the Kenti&s;hmen. One of the per&s;ons employed in collecting the poll-tax had entered into a di&s;pute with a plebeian, known by the name of Wat Tyler,
<PB N="143" REF="1450">
who refu&s;ed to pay for his daughter, on pretence of her being under the age mentioned in the act of parliament. The brutal collector in&s;i&s;ted upon her being a full grown woman; and, in order to a&s;certain his conjecture, pro|ceeded to acts of indecency, which provoked the father to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;lew the tax-gatherer on the &s;pot. His cau&s;e was immediately e&s;pou&s;ed by all the populace of the neighbourhood, who, encouraged by the example of their friends in E&s;&s;ex, took to their arms; and the &s;pirit of mutiny &s;pread like a contagion, through Su&s;&s;ex, Surry, Hertford&s;hire, and all the counties which formed the old kingdom of the Ea&s;t Angles. Not only the di&s;con|tented pea&s;ants, but all the debauched, profligate, and de&s;perate villains, in the&s;e counties, took the field upon this occa&s;ion; and every &s;eparate multitude cho&s;e a leader of approved capacity. The people of condition neglected them at fir&s;t, as mobs that would in a little time di&s;per&s;e of them&s;elves; but they &s;oon became too formidable to be quelled by the civil power. They pulled down the hou&s;es of the nobility and gentry, inflicted immediate death upon all the ju&s;tices and practitioners of the law that fell into their hands: they burned all court-rolls and records; and obliged all per&s;ons to &s;wear they would be true to king Richard, admit no king called John, and join with them in oppo&s;ing taxes. At length Wat Tyler, at the head of the Kenti&s;h in&s;urgents, joined tho&s;e of E&s;&s;ex, commanded by Jack Straw; and, on the twel$th day of June advanced to Blackheath, to the number of an hundred thou&s;and, with banners di&s;played. The king &s;ending th$ther me&s;&s;engers to know the rea&s;on of their in&s;urrection, they gave him to under&s;tand, that they were come to &s;peak with him about certain important affairs; and de&s;ired he would come and hear what they had to propo&s;e. Richard being advi&s;ed to comply with their demand, actually cro&s;&s;ed the Thames to give them that &s;a|tisfaction; but, when they &s;aw him approaching, they began to run towards the river, in order to intercept his retreat: &s;o that Simon Sudbury archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, chancellor; and Sir Robert Hales, grand prior of the Knights ho&s;pitallers, trea&s;urer of England, hurried him back to the Tower with all expedition. The rebels, di&s;appointed of their prize, called aloud, Trea&s;on! trea&s;on! Then running towards the bridge, entered the city, where they plun|dered &s;everal hou&s;es, and murdered &s;ome Flemi&s;h merchants. Next day, being joined by the populace of the city, they attacked the palace of the Savoy, belonging to the duke of Lanca&s;ter, which they burned and levelled to the ground, after having de&s;troyed all the rich furniture, and broke in pieces va&s;t quantities of plate and jewels. Thence they proceeded to the Temple, where they burned all the books, papers, and records; and, having demoli&s;hed the buildings, repaired to the priory of St. John at Clerkenwell, which they treated in the &s;ame manner. The&s;e exploits being per$ormed, they divided them&s;elves into three bodies; one of which took the route to Heybury, where they pillaged and reduced to a&s;hes a magnificent hou&s;e be|longing to the knights of St. John; a &s;econd, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of the people of E&s;&s;ex and Hertford&s;hire, po&s;ted them&s;elves on Mile-End-Green; the third took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of St. Catharine's and Tower-Hill.

They pre&s;ented him with a paper of demands, and told him that he &s;hould be detained until they were granted under the great &s;eal. The&s;e were, an exemption of all per&s;ons throughout the realm from bondage and &s;ervi$ude; free liberty of buying and &s;elling in cities, boroughs, market|$owns, and all places what&s;oever; the reduction of the rent of lands held in villenage to four pence an acre; and a general pardon for all offences. The king granted their reque&s;t, on condition that they would return immediately to their own habitations, and leave two or three of each pari&s;h to receive the charters of freedom, which were immediately drawn up and &s;ealed next morn|ing. The&s;e being delivered, the pea&s;ants of E&s;&s;ex and Hertford&s;hire imme|diately di&s;per&s;ed. Richard had no &s;ooner quitted the Tower, than the body po&s;ted in the neighbouring avenues ru&s;hed in, without finding the lea&s;t oppo|&s;ition: they forthwith beheaded the archbi&s;hop and Sir Robert Hales, ma&s;|&s;acred fifteen other per&s;ons in cold blood, and treated the king's mother with the utmo&s;t indignity; while the cowardly knights and their men at arms &s;tood inactive, without daring to oppo&s;e &s;uch a brutal outrage.</P>

<P>The &s;ub&s;tantial citizens of London now began to recollect them|&s;elves from their con&s;ternation; and Walworth, who happened to be mayor, being &s;econded by the gallant Philpot, per&s;uaded them to take arms in defence of their &s;overeign. Mean while the king $ent a me&s;&s;age to Wat Tyler, offer|ing him and his people the &s;ame charters which had &s;atisfied the men of E&s;&s;ex; but this &s;avage plebeian being fle&s;hed in b$ood, and intoxicated with his power and &s;ucce&s;s, had formed the de&s;ign of murdering the king and all the nobles, and erecting a de&s;poti&s;m on the ruins of the con&s;titution: he therefore made no other reply to the king's me&s;&s;enger, but that he would con&s;ent to a peace, provided he liked the terms; and three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive charters were &s;ent to him, and rej$cted, in the compa&s;s of a few hours. At length Richard, riding to|wards Smithfield, invited him to a conference, that he might know and re|move his objections; and he began to move towards that place with his fol|lowers, but &s;o &s;lowly, that Sir John Newton, who delivered the me&s;&s;age, to$d him the king was waiting for him, and de&s;ired he would mend his pace. This pro$d demagogue took umbrage at the freedom of his remon|&s;trance, and repli$d he might make what ha&s;te he would; but, for his own part, he would move as he him&s;elf &s;hould think proper. When he approached the king, he did not offer to alight; and, Sir John Newton blaming the in|decency of his behaviour, he drew his dagger to &s;tab him for his pre&s;umption. Newton dra$ing his weapon in his own defence, the king interpo&s;ed, and or|dered Sir John to d$liver up his dagger to Tyler, who, notwith&s;tanding all his in&s;olence and brutality, &s;eemed di&s;concerted by the pre&s;ence of his prince.
<PB N="145" REF="1470">
In all probability, his intention was to plunge the dagger into Richard's heart; he eyed his &s;overeign with a gloomy a&s;pect; his hand began to &s;hake, and his countenance denoted di&s;traction. His demands were &s;o extravagant, and made in &s;uch unconnected phra&s;e, that Richard neither perfectly under&s;tood his meaning, nor would he give a&s;&s;ent to his propo&s;al. The intention of both was to amu&s;e each other: for Tyler expected a reinforcement next day from Hertford&s;hire; and the king knew that Sir Robert Knolles was on his march, at the head of a thou&s;and veterans, coming to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Neverthele&s;s, the in&s;olent plebeian could not brook a refu&s;al; and, thinking perhaps this was a proper opportunity to &s;trike the blow he had meditated, he lifted up the dagger, as if he intended to plunge it in the bo&s;om of his &s;overeign; when Walworth, perceiving his drift, rode up and &s;tunned him with a blow of his mace: Philpot fini&s;hed his fate by thru&s;ting his &s;word through the ruffian's body, &s;o that he fell dead from his hor&s;e. His followers &s;eeing him drop, ex|claimed, "Our captain is &s;lain; let us revenge his death:" and bent their bows for that purpo&s;e. But the king, though not quite &s;ixteen years of age, rode up to them with admirable courage and pre&s;ence of mind, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;What would you have, my lieges? Give your&s;elves no concern about the death of that traitor. I am your captain: follow me, and I will grant all your rea&s;onable de&s;ires.&endq;</Q> They were &s;o confounded at the death of their leader, and the magnanimity of their prince, that they dur&s;t not venture to let fly their arrows, but followed him, as it were mechanically, into the fields of I&s;lington. Before they could recollect them&s;elves, Sir Robert Knolles ap|peared with his band of veterans, and &s;ome thou&s;ands of Londoners, who took to their arms under Walworth, immediately after the death of Tyler. The &s;ight of the&s;e troops completed the dejection of the in&s;urgents; and the king offering them a general pardon, and the &s;ame kind of charter he had al|ready granted to their companions, they fell down on their knees, and &s;ub|mitted. Sir Robert Knolles, and other officers that were about the king's per&s;on, propo&s;ed that &s;ome hundreds of them &s;hould be put to the &s;word in terrorem; but, as many per&s;ons had been compelled to join them, he would not &s;uffer that example to be made, left the innocent &s;hould be con$ounded with the guilty; yet he ordered proclamation to be made, that none of them &s;hould be admitted within the walls of the city. Next day, however, they received their charter of infranchi&s;ement, and returned to their re&s;pective habitations.</P>

<P>A fre&s;h body of mutineers from Hertford&s;hire was in full march to join Tyler, when they received the news of his death, and the di&s;per&s;ion of their confederates. Neverthele&s;s, they &s;till kept together, and extorted letters of manumi&s;&s;ion from the mona&s;tery of St. Alban's, and other lords to whom they owed va&s;&s;alage; &s;ome of whom they murdered. They likewi&s;e compelled the abbot and convent to deliver up all their charters and privileges, which they committed to the flames in the market-place. They even pleaded the royal authority for the outrages they committed, until the king publi&s;hed a proclamation, commanding all mayors, &s;heriffs, bailiffs, and other officers of the peace, to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e commotions. The re&s;t of the kingdom was not free from the &s;ame kind of in&s;urrections. The pea&s;ants of Suffolk, thinking they had as good a title to liberty as tho&s;e of Kent and E&s;&s;ex, took to their
<PB N="146" REF="1480">
arms, and &s;truck off the head of Sir John Cavendi&s;h, lord chief ju&s;tice of Eng|land: they likewi&s;e murdered two monks belonging to the convent of St. Ed|mund&s;bury, which they robbed of all its charters; while tho&s;e of Norfolk ro&s;e under the conduct of one known by the name of John Litte&s;ter, or the Dyer, who affected great &s;tate, and compelled all the freeholders of the county to countenance his proceedings. He ordered his followers to beat out the brains of Sir Robert Sale, who had pre&s;umed to cen&s;ure his conduct; and obliged Sir William Morley and Sir John Brewes, to &s;et out for the court, in order to in|troduce three of his followers as deputies to his maje&s;ty. The&s;e had in&s;tructions to &s;ollicit an ample charter of liberties, and to pre&s;ent the king with a large &s;um of money, which they had extorted from the city of Norwich. In their jour|ney to London they were met by Henry Spen&s;er, the warlike bi&s;hop of Nor|wich, who, being informed of their errand, ordered them to be beheaded with|out ceremony. Being afterwards joined by &s;ome gentlemen of the county and their adh$rents, he advanced again&s;t the in&s;urgents, who lay at North Wal&s;ham, and was the fir&s;t man who entered their intrenchments &s;word in hand: the rebels $ought for &s;ome time with great fury; but were at length routed by the martial prelate, and a great number was &s;lain in the pur&s;uit. The Dyer and his principal accomplices being taken, were hanged and quartered; and the qui$t of the country was &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. After this victory, the bi&s;hop marched into the counties of Cambridge and Huntingdon, where he reduced all the mutinous pea&s;ants to their duty, and then entering Suffolk, di&s;&s;ipated the r$bels of that county, who had put to death a great number of practitioners of the law, and committed terrible ravages.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e repeated overthrows and executions, the in|&s;urgents of E&s;&s;ex had the pre&s;umption to &s;end deputies to the king for a con|firmation of their charter: but by this time Richard was in a condition to treat with them as they de&s;erved. Immediately after the di&s;per&s;ion of Tyler's ad|herents he had a&s;&s;embled his military tenants, and &s;ummoned his faithful &s;ub|jects to take arms for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on; and in three days he mu&s;|tered forty thou&s;and men on Blackheath. On the thirtieth day of June he publi&s;hed a proclamation, requiring all tenants to do their accu&s;tomed &s;ervices; and &s;ending a detachment of troops into the heart of Kent, to maintain the peace of that county, marched in per&s;on again&s;t the rebels of E&s;&s;ex, who being defeated in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive engagements at Billerecay and Sudbury, &s;ub|mitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$&s;ingham.

During this expedition the king being at Chelmsford, i&s;&s;ued letters patent revoking the charters he had granted to the in&s;urgents of Kent and E&s;&s;ex, alledging that they had forfeited all title to &s;uch indulgence by their &s;ub&s;equent rebellion.</P>

<P>Richard having totally quelled all the in&s;u$rections, during which above &s;even thou&s;and per&s;ons had lo&s;t their lives, in different parts of the country, he granted commi&s;&s;ions for trying the ringleaders of tho&s;e rebellious pea&s;ants; and among the re&s;t, one John B$ll, a fanatic prie&s;t, who acted as principal incendiary, and even from the fir&s;t manife&s;tation of their di&s;content, &s;pirited them up to mi&s;chief and revolt, by inflammatory &s;ermons and circular letters, couched in quaint my&s;terious rhymes, admirably calculated to work up the minds of ignorant ru&s;tics to $ury and enthu&s;ia&s;m. When they fir&s;t a&s;&s;em|bled at Blackheath, he exhorted them in a &s;ermon to be &s;tout in a&s;&s;erting their
<PB N="147" REF="1490">
liberty, which could not be &s;ecured without killing all the great men of the kingdom, the lawyers, ju&s;tices, and jurymen; and then there would be equal freedom, rank, and power, among all per&s;ons. This wretched fanatic, to|gether with Jack Straw, and the other chieftains that were taken, being tried and convicted of trea&s;on, owned before execution, that when they in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's coming to them at Blackheath, their de&s;ign was to have &s;lain all his attendants, and carried him&s;elf in per&s;on round the kingdom, as a &s;anction to their proceedings, until they &s;hould have been joined by the people in all the different counties: then they would have &s;uddenly ma&s;&s;acred all the nobility and knights, who either by their advice or per&s;onal valour were capable of op|po&s;ing their progre&s;s; and la&s;tly, they would have &s;acrificed the king, the bi|&s;hops, and all the clergy, except the mendicant &s;riars, who &s;hould have been allowed a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for confe&s;&s;ing and celebrating divine &s;ervice throughout the kingdom. After having de&s;troyed the form of religion and government, they propo&s;ed to enact new laws, create Wat Tyler king of Kent, and &s;et up a monarch for every county. As for that pretender to the throne of Kent, he had determined to burn and plunder the city of London, and divide the &s;poil among his followers, when his execrable purpo&s;e was pre|vented by the &s;pirit of Walworth and Philpot, who, together with alderman Brembre and Laud, were knighted and recompenced with lands for the &s;er|vices they had performed in extingui&s;hing this dangerous rebellion.</P>

<P>During the&s;e commotions the duke of Lanca&s;ter was in the north, managing the treaty with the Scots, who, in con&s;ideration thereof, had forbore taking advantage of the troubles in the kingdom of England. While this ne|gotiation was on the carpet, a quarrel had happened between the duke and the earl of Northumberland, which la&s;t had refu&s;ed the other admittance into Ber|wick; and now both came, with their followers in arms, to the parliament, which was &s;ummoned to meet on the &s;ixteenth day of September, to take mea|&s;ures for quieting the minds of the people, which were &s;till in agitation: the &s;e&s;&s;ion, however, was prorogued to the fourth day of November; and in the mean time, the difference between tho&s;e two great noblemen was compro|mi&s;ed. The members of both hou&s;es being convened, the king gave them to under&s;tand, that he had been obliged to grant letters of freedom and manu|mi&s;&s;ion to the pea&s;ants, in order to avoid mi&s;chief; and that he had &s;ince re|voked them by the advice of his council, as charters extorted by compul&s;ion, contrary to rea&s;on, law, ju&s;tice, and the rights and privileges of the prelates, lords, and freeholders of the realm: he de&s;ired, however, to know their &s;en|timents on the &s;ubject, according to which they &s;hould either be repealed or confirmed. The lords and commons unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that &s;uch charters obtained by violence, were contrary to law, injurious to the nobility, and de|&s;tructive to the kingdom; for which rea&s;ons they were declared null and void, and repealed by authority of parliament. Then the commons proceeded to an enquiry about the cau&s;es of the late commotion, and having deliberated upon the &s;ubject, imputed it chiefly to the oppre&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed over the pea&s;ants, by the king's officers and the courts of law, which encouraged &s;uits and quarrels in the country. The king appointed a committee of prelates and lords to in|&s;pect the conduct of &s;uch officers, that the grievance might be redre&s;&s;ed: all per&s;ons who&s;e writings and vouchers had been burned by the in&s;urgents, were
<PB N="148" REF="1500">
invited to come and produce proof before the king's council, that they might receive exemplifications, without trouble or expence. The next object of their con&s;ideration was the nece&s;&s;ity of publi&s;hing pardons for tho&s;e lords and gen|tlemen who, in oppo&s;ing the rebels, had committed illegal actions, as well as for the towns, boroughs, and country people, who had been concerned in the in&s;urrection. From this la&s;t act of amne&s;ty the ringleaders of the in&s;urgents were nominally excepted, together with the town of St. Edmund&s;bury, the in|habitants of which were concerned in the murder of the chancellor, trea&s;urer, and chief ju&s;tice; and tho&s;e of Cambridge, who had plundered Bennet-Col|lege, carried away all the charters of the univer&s;ity, extorted bonds from the ma&s;ters and &s;cholars, and committed divers other enormities, by the conni|vance of the magi&s;trates. Their franchi&s;es were therefore forfeited, &s;ome of their privileges granted to the univer&s;ity, and the re&s;t re&s;tored to the town, upon the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants. The&s;e clau&s;es being &s;ettled, the com|mons eagerly de&s;ired they might be pa&s;&s;ed into a law; ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, that, con&s;idering the ill humour of the people, they could not venture to grant any &s;ort of talliage. But the king refu&s;ed to comply with their re|que&s;t, until they &s;hould have made &s;ome provi&s;ion for the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate; then they voted a &s;ub&s;idy on wool and leather, and the pardons pa&s;&s;ing the great &s;eal, the parliament was adjourned to the twenty-fourth day of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro$.

<P>Two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive treaties had been brought upon the carpet for the marriage of Richard, fir&s;t with Catherine, daughter of Barnaby Vi&s;conti duke of Milan, and afterwards with Catherine, daughter of the late emperor Lewis; but both the&s;e proving abortive, a match was at length concluded between him and Anne, &s;i&s;ter of the emperor Wince&s;laus king of Bohemia; a lady who&s;e high rank &s;eems to have been con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for her want of fortune; for, in&s;tead of bringing a portion &s;uitable to her quality, her brother Wince&s;laus &s;tipulated for a loan of eighteen thou&s;and marks, one moiety of which was to be remitted upon the delivery of the prince&s;s at Calais. She arrived in England a few days before Chri&s;tmas; and after the holidays the nuptials were $olemnized: then &s;he was crowned with great pomp in We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Abbey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer. Wa$$ingham.</NOTE> and &s;olemn tournaments were held upon the occa&s;ion. The&s;e di|ver&s;ions being fini&s;hed, the parliament met again, and continued the &s;ub&s;idy on wool and leather, for four years next en$uing. It was in this &s;e&s;&s;ion the duke of Lanca&s;ter propo&s;ed that he &s;hould tran&s;port a body of forces to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the king of Portugal, who was hard pre&s;&s;ed by the king of Ca&s;tile. As the Portugue&s;e monarch was a very u&s;eful ally to England, the earl of Cambridge had been &s;ent in the preceding year, with a &s;mall body of forces to &s;uccour him in his di&s;tre&s;s; and by their valour, they had actually rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Li&s;|bon, which the Spaniards had undertaken: but they were not numerous enough to act offen&s;ively; and the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who never lo&s;t &s;ight of his claim upon Ca&s;tile, attempted to borrow of the parliament &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, for rai&s;ing a &s;ufficient number of forces to drive the Spaniards out of Portugal, promi&s;ing to repay the money in three years, either in &s;pecie or by &s;ome &s;ervice that &s;hould be acceptable to the nation. The propo&s;al was de|bated in both hou&s;es; but the commons were &s;o far from complying with his reque&s;t, that, when they granted the &s;ub&s;idy for the defence of the realm, they
<PB N="149" REF="1510">
expre&s;ly declared, they would not involve them&s;elves in a quarrel with Spain on any pretence what&s;oever.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in England, France was expo&s;ed to all the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1382.</NOTE> inconveniencies of a minority. Lewis duke of Anjou, elde&s;t uncle to the young king Charles VI. burthened the people with &s;uch grievous taxes, as pro|duced in&s;urrections in Paris, Rouen, and other populous cities: his brothers the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, who were a&s;&s;ociated with him in the admi|ni&s;tration, refu&s;ed to concur in his mea&s;ures; and great di&s;order aro&s;e from their di&s;&s;en&s;ions. The&s;e circum&s;tances being con&s;idered, this was judged a fa|vourable conjuncture for invading France with &s;uch an armament as might in|timidate her into a peace, which would be very acceptable to the Engli&s;h, who &s;uffered greatly in their trade by the French depredations. A council being held at Wind&s;or, the lords were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that the king &s;hould invade France with a royal army; and they offered to &s;erve under him with a certain number of men at arms and archers. The merchants of London and other trading towns, being pre&s;&s;ed to advance money for this &s;ervice, declined running any ri&s;k without the &s;ecurity of parliament, which was therefore called on the &s;eventeenth day of May, to remove their &s;cruples, and make provi&s;ion for the government of the realm during the king's ab&s;ence. Even then a com|mittee of merchants appointed to con&s;ider of ways and means to rai&s;e the nece&s;|&s;ary &s;um, which would amount to &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, propo&s;ed that the lords &s;piritual and temporal, together with the knights of the &s;hires, &s;hould lend a con&s;i|derable &s;um for the nece&s;&s;ity of the government, without intere&s;t; and they would expre&s;s their loyalty in the &s;ame manner, upon proper &s;ecurity, without which they declared they would not lend one farthing. The parliament, di&s;appointed in this quarter, enacted ordinances, permitting foreigners to buy and &s;ell their merchandize all over England, by virtue of the king's licence; and permitting aliens as well as natives, to export wool for a certain term, on paying the duties at Calais, and remitting part of the &s;ub&s;idy on wool and leather, to &s;uch as &s;hould make prompt payment within a limited time. The&s;e regulations not an&s;wering the purpo&s;e, the &s;cheme of the expedition was laid a&s;ide; but the merchants of the We&s;t, offering to maintain a fleet for the &s;afe-guard of the coa&s;t, their propo&s;al was accepted, and a tax laid upon wine and merchandize for that &s;ervice.</P>

<P>When the parliament broke up, conferences were opened for a peace between England and France, and the negotiation &s;ucceeded &s;o far that both parties agreed to a &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation of arms: but a final treaty was in a great mea&s;ure prevented by a &s;chi&s;m in the church, by which all Europe was divided. When pope Gregory X. died at Rome, the inhabitants of that city re&s;olved that no per&s;on &s;hould &s;ucceed him in the papal chair, but one who would re&s;ide in Italy. This re&s;olution was &s;ignified to the college of cardinals, who were generally natives of France; and the&s;e, in a formal in&s;trument, pro|te&s;ted again&s;t the validity of the election, in ca&s;e any violence &s;hould be offered to the conclave. The Romans became &s;o furious on the day of election, that the cardinals dur$t not venture to oppo&s;e their will; and the archbi&s;hop of Bari being cho&s;en, a&s;&s;umed the name of Urban VI. The French cardinals were no &s;ooner at liberty, than they retired to the kingdom of Naples, and di&s;|claiming the election as extorted by violence, proceeded to a new choice,
<PB N="150" REF="1520">
which fell upon the cardinal of Geneva, who took the name of Clement VII. Urban, who was naturally &s;our, proud, and inflexible, b$$ng alarmed at this oppo&s;ition in the per&s;on of an accompli&s;hed rival, &s;upported by &s;uch a powerful nation as France, laid a&s;ide his haughty deportment, and endeavoured to in|grati$te him&s;elf with the potentates of Europe. He created nine and twenty cardi$als in one day, and elevated to that dignity Philip $f Alen&ccedil;on, a prince of the blood in France: he confirmed the election of Wince&s;laus to the imperial th$$$e; and that prince e&s;pou&s;ing his cau&s;e, engaged the court of England in the $$me intere&s;t: their example was followed by the northern potentates, while Clement was &s;upported by the kings of France, Ca&s;tile, Scotland, and Cyprus, the counts o$ Savoy and Geneva, which la&s;t was his brother, the duke o$ Au&s;tria, and &s;ome other German princes. All Italy was involved in war; the enterpri&s;ing Jane queen of Naples declared again&s;t Urban, and fur|ni&s;hed his rival with forces; the emperor &s;ent a body of troops to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Urban: two battles en&s;ued, in the fir&s;t of which Clement obtained the vic|tory, but in the la&s;t he was vanqui&s;hed, and flying to France took up his re&s;i|dence at Avignon. The court of France prevailed upon him to preach up a cru&s;ade again&s;t Richard king of England and his &s;ubjects; while his competi|tor excommunicated him as an antipope, and &s;ent over a commi&s;&s;ion to the warlike bi&s;hop of Norwich, to command a cru&s;ade again&s;t him and all his ad|herents. He at the &s;ame time ve&s;ted this prelate with a plenary power as legate, to grant di&s;pen&s;ations to clergymen who &s;hould &s;erve in per&s;on, excu&s;ing them from attending their cures; and to be&s;tow &s;uch indulgences and ab&s;olution as were granted to tho&s;e who had engaged in cru&s;ades again&s;t the infidels. The people inli&s;ted in this expedition with incredible ardour; and all ranks of both &s;exes contributed largely towards the expence, by parting with their money, plate, jewels, and furniture, even before the bi&s;hop was empowered by the king to put the pope's &s;cheme in execution. It was, however, determined in council, that an effort &s;hould be made again&s;t France; and a parliament was convoked on the &s;ixth day of October, in hope of obtaining a &s;upply for that purpo&s;e. The bi&s;hop of Hereford, having explained the cau&s;e of their meet|ing, mentioned two ways of annoying the enemy, either by joining the Flem|ings, who had broke with France, and &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, or accepting the propo&s;al of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who offered to make a di|ver&s;ion in Spain with a certain number of forces, provided they would &s;upply him with three and forty thou&s;and pounds, which he engaged to refund in money or &s;ervice. The commons rejected this propo&s;al of the duke, whom they hated for the haughtine&s;s of his manners, and who&s;e de&s;igns they &s;u&s;|pected of di&s;loyalty, and re&s;olved to encourage and &s;upport the bi&s;hop of Nor|wich in his cru&s;$de, as he propo&s;ed to tran&s;port his troops to Calais, and march to the &s;uccour of the Flemings, who were the antient and mo&s;t u&s;eful allies of the Engli&s;h. They therefore petitioned the throne that the Marches of Calais might be granted for a certain term to that prelate, with a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, out of the large &s;ub&s;idy they had ju&s;t voted for the defence of the kingdom, that he might be enabled to a&s;&s;emble his troops and cro&s;s the<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$t.

A council was immediately convened at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where it was re&s;olved that the king &s;hould &s;et out in per&s;on for the relief of that city; and a parliament was &s;ummoned to meet in February, that they might deliberate upon this re&s;o|lution, which was explained to them, at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, by the bi|&s;hop of London, high chancellor of the realm. The commons having con|&s;ulted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1383.</NOTE> with a committee of the other hou&s;e, on the &s;ubject of his maje&s;ty's voyage, gave it as their opinion, that the truce with the Scots being almo&s;t ex|pired, and that nation actually employed in making preparations to renew their ho&s;tilities, neither the king him&s;elf, nor any one of his three uncles, could be &s;pared out of the realm, until the peace of the borders &s;hould be &s;ecured. They therefore recommended to his maje&s;ty's acceptance, the &s;cheme of the bi&s;hop of Norwich, who offered to rai&s;e a con&s;iderable army for the relief of Ghent and reduction of Flanders; and afterwards to carry the war into France, on con|dition of his receiving the &s;ub&s;idies which had been granted in the la&s;t parlia|ment. By this time the bi&s;hop, having more maturely con&s;idered the nature of the expedition, altered his fir&s;t propo&s;al, and engaged to &s;erve the king one year with five and twenty hundred men at arms, and the like number of archers well mounted and accoutred, for the whole fifteenth granted by the laity; that two thou&s;and of that number, &s;hould be ready to embark within twenty days after the fir&s;t payme$t; and that he would defray the charge of &s;hipping and all other expences. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>This propo&s;al being chearfully embraced by Richard, the bi&s;hop began to a&s;&s;emble his troops, and was joined by a great number of voluntiers and enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who embarked in the expedition from religious motives. With the&s;e he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea in May to Calais, where he propo&s;ed to remain until he &s;hould be reinforced by William de Beauchamp, whom the king had appoint|ed his lieutenant: but he being detained in England by the dilatory proceed|ings of Lanca&s;ter, who endeavoured to thwart the bi&s;hop for having interfered with his de&s;ign, the cru&s;ards became &s;o impatient and mutinous, that their leader took the field, and at$acking Gravelines, reduced it by a de&s;perate a&s;|&s;ault. The inhabitants and garri&s;on of Dunkirk, intimidated by this exploit, opened their gates to the victor; while the count of Flanders, who was intirely under French influence, prepared to give him battle. The bi&s;hop, who was by this time joined by the gallant Sir Hugh de Calverly, marched out to meet him with great confidence, though his army amounted to thirty thou&s;and men. An engagement en&s;uing, the count was totally routed, and Ca&s;&s;el, Dixmuyde. Bourburg, Newport, and Popperen, &s;urrendered to the victorious Engli&s;h. The king of France, alarmed at the progre&s;s of the bi&s;hop, a&s;&s;embled an army of one hundred thou&s;and men, to cha&s;ti&s;e his pre&s;umption; and in the mean time the Engli&s;h were joined by a va&s;t number of fre&s;h cru&s;ards from Eng|land, t$$$&s;ands of whom con&s;i&s;ted of the very dregs of the people, and pro$li|gate mi&s;creants allured by the hope of plunder. The&s;e were tran&s;ported, at the expence of Sir John Philpot, and became &s;uch an incumbrance to the army, that the bi&s;hop de&s;ired he would check his zeal, and &s;end no &s;uch naked ruf|fians for the future. The prelate's forces being now increa&s;ed to ninety thou|&s;and, he re&s;olved to hazard a pitched battle with the French king; but there

was a &s;et of mutineers in his army, who publicly declared that they would not march into France, until they &s;hould have taken Yypres, where they expected immen&s;e plunder: &s;o that he was obliged to und$rtake the &s;iege of that place, contrary to his own judgment. He gave &s;everal furious a&s;&s;auits, but was al|ways repul&s;ed by the French garri&s;on; and the&s;e repeated mi&s;carriages di&s;|piriting the troops, that fought $rom the impul&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;m or the &s;pirit of depredation, which cannot brook much fatigue or oppo&s;ition, they rejected all di&s;cipline and re&s;traint, ravaged the adjacent country, and de&s;erted in &s;uch numbers, that their leader found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to abandon his enter|prize at the approach of the French army, and retire to Dunkirk with &s;ome precipitation, leaving all his artillery and ammunition as a prey to the enemy. Sir Hugh de Calverly and Sir Thomas Trivet threw them&s;elves into Bourburg, which was immediately inve&s;ted by Charles, who &s;ummoned them to &s;urrender on pain of being put to the &s;word without mercy. Far from being intimidated by this menace they &s;tood two de&s;perate a&s;&s;aults, in which the aggre&s;&s;ors were repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter; and then obtained an honourable capitulation, by virtue of which they retired to Calais. The French king, marching to Gravelines, found the bi&s;hop &s;o re&s;olutely determined to make a vigorous de|fence, that they offered to conduct him and his forces to any place he &s;hould name, and pay fi$teen thou&s;and marks as a con&s;ideration for the provi&s;ions, and liberty to demoli&s;h the fortifications. The bi&s;hop, finding the courage of his cru&s;ards con&s;iderably cooled, demanded a truce for a certain number of days, at the expiration of which he promi&s;ed to give a definitive an&s;wer; and, this being granted, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger with a letter to the king, pre&s;&s;ing him to &s;end a reinforcement to his relief. Richard was by this time immer&s;ed in all the riot and debauchery of unthinking youth; he had been debarred the ad|vantage of a proper education, and he had not natural &s;agacity to &s;upply this defect. He indulged his pa&s;&s;ions to exce&s;s; and was giddy, volatile, and voluptuous, without that good &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment which often &s;hine thro' the mi&s;ts of irregularity and intemperance, and promi&s;e an agreeable after-day of rea&s;on and reflection. He was &s;urrounded with pernicious &s;ycophants, and his brain heated with riot and revelling at Daintry in Northampton&s;hire, when he received the bi&s;hop's letter, which he had no &s;ooner peru&s;ed than he called for his hor&s;e, and po&s;ted &s;ingly to London, breathing de&s;truction to France and per&s;onal defiance to Charles. At his arrival, he &s;ent for the duke of Lan|ca&s;ter, and appointed him commander in chief of an army de&s;igned for the bi&s;hop's relief; but, before the troops could be a&s;&s;embled and embarked, the truce expiring, the bi&s;hop was obliged to embrace the terms propo&s;ed; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froiffart.

<P>The bad &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition concurred with other circum|&s;tances to di&s;pirit and di&s;gu&s;t the nation. The Scots had made an irruption into England, and demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tle of Werk: and when the duke of Lanca&s;ter propo&s;ed an interview with the prince of Scotland, the reque&s;t was granted; but, in&s;tead of agreeing to a peace with England, they concluded a treaty of alliance with the French king, who obliged him&s;elf to &s;end a &s;trong body of forces into Scotland, together with a certain number of arms, and forty thou&s;and franks of gold, to be employed in the pro&s;ecution of a war
<PB N="153" REF="1550">
with England. The marechal de Sancerre had expelled the Engli&s;h intirely from the Limou&s;in, and even reduced many of their forts in Poitou; the Norman privateers had taken a large fleet of &s;hips belonging to Engli&s;h merchants; and &s;everal &s;hips of war had been obliged to &s;urrender to the Ca&s;tilian navy on the coa&s;t of Rochelle. All the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters combined did not di&s;courage the people &s;o much as the incon&s;iderate and extravagant conduct of the king, who gave him&s;elf up wholly to a &s;et of worthle&s;s flatterers, who &s;educed him to his ruin and plunged him in all manner of exce&s;s. His uncle the duke of Lanca&s;ter cho&s;e to live at a di&s;tance from court, on various pretences, rather than mingle with the herd of low para&s;ites that &s;urrounded his nephew; and the bi&s;hop of London re&s;igned the great &s;eal, which was delivered to Sir Michael de la Pole, the &s;on of a rich merchant in King&s;ton upon Hull, who rendered him&s;elf famous in the &s;equel. This man, &s;ucceeding to his father's wealth, &s;upplied the king with money at exorbitant u&s;ury; and being of a $unning pliable di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oon in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the confidence and affection of Richard, by exerting all his indu&s;try in gratifying the pa&s;&s;ions and appetites of his prince. While the king &s;quandered away his revenue upon his favourites and plea&s;ures, the queen acted with the &s;ame profu&s;ion towards her needy and rapacious countrymen; &s;o that their finances were &s;oon ex|hau&s;ted; and their nece&s;&s;ities, together with the &s;ituation of public affairs, required the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice of a parliament, which was a&s;&s;embled at We&s;t|min&s;ter on the fir&s;t day of November. The new chancellor opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a detail of the public affairs; and ob&s;erved that as the war had de&s;cended to the king with his crown, the parliament was obliged in honour to &s;up|port it effectually. He told them delays were dangerous; that it was the king's plea&s;ure they &s;hould po&s;tpone all other bu&s;ine&s;s, till that of the ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upplies &s;hould be adju&s;ted; and that no member &s;hould depart from the parliament without &s;pecial leave from his maje&s;ty. The lords and com|mons, in obedience to this addre&s;s, took the nece&s;&s;ities of the war into con|&s;ideration, and voted two half fifteenths, on condition the clergy would make a grant in the u&s;ual proportion; then they proceeded to deliberate upon the cau&s;es of the late mi&s;carriage in Flanders, which the chancellor imputed to the bi&s;hop of Norwich, whom he therefore impeached for non-performance of his engagements with the king. The articles of his charge imported, that he had received eighteen thou&s;and franks of gold from the enemy; that he had not engaged the be&s;t officers that were to be found, or a king's lieutenant to di&s;cipline his troops; and that he had not &s;erved half the time &s;tipulated in his contract, nor mu&s;tered his forces at Calais, according to the nature of his obligation. The bi&s;hop ea&s;ily acquitted him&s;elf of the fir&s;t article, and made &s;uch excu&s;es for the &s;ub&s;equent part of his conduct as plainly proved that he had acted with &s;pirit and capacity; but, as he owned that &s;ome of his followers had mi&s;behaved, and that he had not &s;erved the full time mentioned in his con|tract, he was adjudged to make fine and ran&s;om at the king's plea&s;ure; and the temporalities of his bi&s;hopric were &s;eized for that purpo&s;e. The re&s;ent|ment of the parliament fell next upon the ringleaders of the mutiny, to which all the di&s;a&s;ters of the campaign had certainly owed their origin. Sir Thomas Trivet, Sir Hen$y Ferrers, Sir William Ellingham, and Sir William Har|rendon, were accu&s;ed of having received twenty thou&s;and franks of gold from the French for the &s;urrender of different places. As they had actually touched

<P>This campaign of the bi&s;hop, though unfortunate for him&s;elf, was yet of &s;ome &s;ervice to his country. The duke of Bretagne &s;erved in the army of France; and, as he &s;till retained an uncommon regard for his old benefactors, he took this opportunity to mediate a peace between the two nations.

Conferences were opened with the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, at Lenlingen between Calais and Boulogne; but, the French in&s;i&s;ting upon the re&s;titution of Calais, Cher|bourg, and Bre&s;t, and the Engli&s;h refu&s;ing to give them up, all that could be ob$ained was a truce from January till Michaelmas, including the inhabi|tants of Ghent; but the Scots did not chu&s;e to be comprehended in the agree|ment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The Scots having committed ravages on the borders, the duke of Lanca&s;ter at his return to England was &s;ent with the earl of Buckingham, at the head of a numerous army, to cha&s;ti&s;e that people whom no treaties could re&s;train: but the duke did not engage very warmly in this expedition. He had always endeavoured to promote a good under&s;tanding between the two kingdoms, either becau&s;e he thought that a peace with Scotland would have enabled Richard to a&s;&s;i&s;t him the more effectually in his de&s;igns upon Ca&s;tile, or believed that the French would have been ea&s;ily humbled, could the Scots have been detached from their alliance; or la&s;tly, becau&s;e he had a regard or affection for the nation in which he had been &s;o ho&s;pitably received during the troubles of his own country. Whatever his motives might have been for favouring the Scots at this juncture; certain it is he loitered away his time in Northumberland, until they had removed all their valuable effects beyond the friths: &s;o that, when he entered Scotland about Ea&s;ter, he could find nei|ther booty nor &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Having advanced as far as Edinburgh, which was de&s;erted, he &s;et the empty hou&s;es on fire, and returned to England, after hav|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal$ingham.</NOTE> lo&s;t abundance of men and hor&s;es, which died of cold and famine. The enemy, following him clo&s;e at his heels, entered England, where they burned and plundered towns and villages, and ravaged the open country; and the Engli&s;h made repri&s;als in Scotland, until they thought proper to claim the benefit of the truce, to which both agreed on the &s;eventh day of July. When the duke of Lanca&s;ter returned from this inglorious expedition, he found the popular odium increa&s;ed again&s;t him to a dangerous degree of in|veteracy: every mouth was opened in condemnation of his conduct; the people clamoured again&s;t his in&s;olence and ambition, and did not &s;cruple to accu&s;e him of having betrayed the intere&s;ts of his country. While Richard kept his court at Sali&s;bury, during the Ea&s;ter holidays, an Iri&s;h carmelite friar pre&s;ented him with a paper, containing a circum&s;tantial detail of a con&s;piracy
<PB N="155" REF="1570">
hatched by the duke of Lanca&s;ter again&s;t his maje&s;ty's life; and &s;wore by the &s;acrament of Chri&s;t's body, which he had that day admini&s;tered, that every word of the accu&s;ation was true. Richard, &s;tartled at this intelligence, had recour&s;e to the advice of two clerks belonging to his own chapel; and while the three were employed in a con&s;ultation upon this important &s;ubject, the duke chanced to enter the apartment. The king could not di&s;gui&s;e his &s;enti|ments &s;o much, but that his uncle perceived his re&s;entment and perturbation, and immediately withdrew. Then the timorous clerks, dreading the power of Lanca&s;ter, coun&s;elled Richard to &s;end for him, and put the paper in his hand. The duke accordingly returned, in con&s;equence of the me&s;&s;age; and having peru&s;ed the information, without betraying the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of guilt or con|fu&s;ion, denied every article of the charge, and offered to purge him&s;elf by &s;ingle combat. Though the king &s;eemed perfectly convinced of his innocence, he demanded that the friar &s;hould be apprehended and brought to his trial, and in the mean time &s;ecured in the cu&s;tody of Sir John Holland the king's uterine brother. Richard complied with his reque&s;t; and on the morning of the day fixed for his trial, the carmelite was found murdered in a barbarous manner. This &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tance renewed the king's jealou&s;y, in which he was con|firmed by the clergy of his hou&s;hold and Tre&s;ilian his chief ju&s;ticiary, who propo&s;ed that the duke &s;hould be arre&s;ted, and undertook to proceed again&s;t him as a common traitor. This advice being reported to the earl of Buckingham, who, though a nobleman of good principles, was violent in his affections and pa&s;&s;ionate even to a degree of fren&s;y, he forthwith ru&s;hed into the king's cham|ber; and drawing his &s;word, &s;wore he would &s;acrifice all tho&s;e who &s;hould pre&s;ume to accu&s;e his brother of trea&s;on. This addre&s;s intimidated the king and his attendants to &s;uch a degree, that they dur&s;t not &s;peak their &s;entiments or attempt to take any vigorous mea&s;ures again&s;t the duke, who retired im|mediately to his ca&s;tle of Pontefract, where he knew him&s;elf &s;ecure from the machinations of his enemies. Though the council did not think proper to pro|&s;ecute<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham$ Tyrrel.</NOTE> this nobleman, they re&s;olved to apprehend the lord Zouch, who was mentioned as his accomplice in the friar's information. The gout had con|fined him to his bed, but he was conveyed to town in a litter, and brought to his trial, when he pleaded his own cau&s;e &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully that he was ac|quitted by his peers, who &s;eemed to impute the whole information to the male|volence of the clergy, who were known to be his profe&s;&s;ed enemies. The lord Zouch's acquittal in all probability, removed the king's &s;u&s;picion of his uncle; for he began to li&s;ten to the &s;ugge&s;tions of his mother the prince&s;s of Wales, who laboured to promote a reconciliation between him and the duke, and at length &s;ucceeded in her endeavours. Immediately after this accommodation, the duke and his brother the earl of Buckingham were appointed plenipoten|tiaries to treat of a pacification with the French king, who had named his un|cles the dukes of Berry and Burgundy to manage his intere&s;ts in the congre&s;s which was held in Picardy. The two brothers cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea on this negotia|tion, with a very &s;plendid retinue; but the conferences produced nothing but a truce till the following May, in which the Scots were comprehended, as well as the duke of Lanca&s;ter him&s;elf, in the character of the king of Ca&s;tile. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Before the duke of Lanca&s;ter returned from the Scotti&s;h expedi|tion, he, as warden of the Marches, contracted with the earl of Northumber|land, who, for a certain con&s;ideration, engaged to keep the field from the fir&s;t day of May, till the eleventh day of June, and have a watchful eye over the town of Berwick and the ca&s;tle of Carlile. He acted as lord lieutenant of the counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and We&s;tmoreland, deputy war|den of the Marches, and admiral of the north coa&s;t. The agreement between him and Lanca&s;ter was confirmed by the king at New Sarum; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that he undertook to be an&s;werable for every thing that &s;hould hap|pen within the limits of his command: notwith&s;tanding all his vigilance, the Scots, in the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer, found means to bribe the deputy-governor of Berwick, who betrayed the ca&s;tle into their hands. The duke returning from Picardy, and being informed of the event, re&s;olved to effect the ruin of Northumberland, to whom he had never been heartily reconciled &s;ince their fir&s;t quarrel. He impeached him for the lo&s;s of Berwick, in the parliament which a&s;&s;embled on the twelfth day of November; and as he did not appear when &s;ummoned, he was condemned and forfeited for high trea&s;on. The earl was unwilling to appear until he &s;hould have made amends for his neglect, or rather for his error, in tru&s;ting &s;uch an important charge to a traitor: he a&s;&s;em|bled &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, with which he ravaged the &s;outhern parts of Scot|land, when the tidings of the truce put an end to his ho&s;tilities: neverthele&s;s he thought him&s;elf at liberty to recover Berwick, which had been taken during a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, and inve&s;ted it accordingly. Having planted his artillery, he gave the garri&s;on to under&s;tand, that he would put them all to the &s;word &s;hould they make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; whereas they &s;hould have a gratification of two thou&s;and marks, and be allowed to march out with all the honours of war, if they would &s;urrender the fortre&s;s immediately. The governor com|plied with the propo&s;al; and the earl of Northumberland having thus retrieved his honour, and vindicated his character from all &s;u&s;picion, the &s;entence which had pa&s;&s;ed agai$&s;t him was repealed, though he never could forgive the duke of Lanca&s;ter, for having taken &s;uch a ba&s;e advantage of his ab&s;ence and mi&s;|fortune.</P>

<PB N="157" REF="1590">
the French king for invading England by &s;ea, while Robert king of Scotland &s;hould make an irruption with a numerous army into the northern counties. Though the duke of Burgundy had &s;ucceeded to the va&s;t e&s;tate of the count of Flanders, the citizens of Ghent refu&s;ed to lay down their arms, and &s;ollicitted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection of Richard, who &s;ent over Sir John Bourchier to act as his lieutenant; and under the conduct of that brave officer they ob|tained &s;everal advantages over the French, which obliged them to po&s;tpone their de&s;ign of invading England. This &s;cheme had been projected by the duke of Burgundy; and a numerous fleet was a&s;&s;embled at Sluys for the tran&s;|portation of the forces, under the direction of John de Vienne admiral of France, who actually conveyed to Scotland five hundred men at arms, and a very con&s;iderable &s;um of money, as a pre&s;ent to the Scotti&s;h monarch. The<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> French army intended for the de&s;cent had already marched down to Sluys, and was ready to embark under the command of the con&s;table, the marechal San|cerre, and the lord of Cou&s;y, when the &s;trong town of Damme declared for the inhabitants of Ghent, and admitted a garri&s;on to defend it again&s;t the duke of Burgundy. At the &s;ame time the people of Sluys con&s;pired with them to &s;et on fire the French fleet that lay in their harbour. This &s;cheme being di&s;|covered to the duke, he po&s;tponed the expedition to England, and re&s;olved to cha&s;ti&s;e the Flemings for their rebellion: Damme was taken by &s;torm, and all the garri&s;on put to the &s;word; and the French troops marched from thence into the heart of the country: &s;o that England had nothing to fear for that &s;ea&s;on. Mean while John de Vienne pre&s;&s;ed the king of Scotland to a&s;&s;emble his army and invade England; but that prince refu&s;ed to take the field, until he &s;hould be certainly informed of the French army's being landed on the &s;ou|thern parts of the i&s;land: neverthele&s;s, he furni&s;hed him with a &s;mall body of forces, at the head of which he made a furious irruption into Northumberland, and took &s;everal places of con&s;equence. By this time Richard had re&s;olved to march again&s;t them in per&s;on, and appointed the rendezvous of his forces at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, where a greater number of knights than had ever been known to &s;erve on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, a&s;&s;embled to &s;hare the glory of his fir&s;t campaign. At the &s;ame time a fleet of &s;hips, commanded by the lord Thomas Percy, was ordered to attend the motions of the army, in order to &s;upply it with provi&s;ion, in ca&s;e they &s;hould find no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in Scotland. John duke of Lanca&s;ter was detached with the van of the army, to intercept the Scots in their return from England, which they had ravaged to the gates of York; but they outmarched his forces, and carried intelligence of the king's motions to Robert, who was not a little chagrined to find him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the whole power of England, through the failure of the inva&s;ion.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. Richard maintained the &s;ame luxury and effeminate magnificence in the camp, which had always reigned in his court, &s;ince he was ma&s;ter of his own actions. In his progre&s;s to the north, a quarrel ari&s;ing between his uterine brother Sir John Holland, and Sir Ralph Stafford &s;on of the earl of Stafford; this la&s;t was treacherou&s;ly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the other, who took re|fuge in the church of Beverly. The king was &s;o much incen&s;ed at the murder of his favourite, that he re&s;olved to puni&s;h the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in with the utmo&s;t rigour of the law. His mother, the prince&s;s of W$les, employed all her influence with him in favour of her unhappy &s;on; but he continuing inflexibly &s;evere, &s;he fell
<PB N="158" REF="1600">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wa$&s;ingh$m.</NOTE> ill and expired, through grie$ and vexation. Before Richard entered Scotland, the enemy h$d retired as $&s;ual with their cattle and effects, beyond the frith of Forth; &s;o that he $$w not a living creature, and mu&s;t have &s;tarved in a de|&s;$$t country, had not his f$eet &s;upplied him with prov$$$ons. He advanced as fa$ as Edinburgh, which had for &s;ome time been abandoned; and there the duke of Lanca&s;ter advi&s;ed him to proceed northward, in imitation of his grand|father and the fir&s;t Edwardm who had penetrated to the extremities of the i&s;land. But he was &s;urrounded by &s;ycophants, who dreaded the protraction of the cam|paign, in the cour&s;e of which the duke might &s;uper&s;ede their influence; and there|fore they oppo&s;ed his advice, on pretence of its being calculated for confirming his intere&s;t in the army. In a word, they alarmed this weak prince with &s;uch in|finuations concerning the ambitious de&s;igns of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, as con|vinced him of that nobleman's being a traitor; and as he had not courage enough to manife&s;t his &s;entiments in a princely manner, they broke out in &s;ud|den &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion, which he wanted prudence to re&s;train. When the duke repeated his in&s;tances to pa&s;s the Forth, Richard &s;aid, with marks of great per|turbation, "I and my army will never go farther north, you and yours may." The duke an&s;wered, "I have no will of my own, but am an obedient &s;ubject." "That you are not," exclaimed the king, and then quitted the apartment abruptly. It required &s;ome addre&s;s in the duke, to maintain his footing in &s;uch a $lippery &s;ituation; and he prudently cho&s;e to efface the king's &s;u&s;picions by ob&s;equious behaviour, and a con&s;tant attention to the duties of his office. By this time, the fleet being detained by contrary winds, they began to be in great want of provi&s;ion and forage, by which both men and hor&s;e &s;uffered exceedingly: they had no opportunity of acting effectually again&s;t the Scots, who avoided a general engagement, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed them intercepting their convoys from Berwick, and cutting off their detached parties. A &s;trong body of them a&s;&s;embling in the We&s;t under the earls of Douglas, Marche, and Fife, entered Cumberland, burned Penrith, demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tles of Werk, Ford, and Cornwal, ravaged the country as far as Newca&s;tle, and even in&s;ulted the garri&s;on of Carlile with impunity. The king, being informed of the&s;e tran&s;|actions, re&s;olved to return to his own dominions, according to the advice of his three favourites, Michael de la Pole, Tre&s;ilian, and Robert Vere earl of Oxford; and after having burned the huts of which Edinburgh was compo&s;ed, and all the churches of tolerable architecture, the army began its march in Augu&s;t for Berwick, after an inglorious campaign, during which the Scots amply indemnified them&s;elves for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained, with an im|men&s;e booty which they found in England. Richard no &s;ooner retired, than, in conjunction with the French auxiliaries, they inve&s;ted the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Roxburgh, which in all probability would have fallen into their hands, had not Robert been &s;o di&s;gui&s;ted with his French friends, that he would not longer act in concert with John de Vienne, who had debauched a lady of quality at his court, and in&s;i&s;ted upon Roxburgh's being garri&s;oned by the French troops, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be taken by their joint endeavours. The king of Scotland, in|cen&s;ed at the in&s;olence of this foreigner, and the duke of Burgundy's failure in the performance of his contract, rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and ab&s;tained from all<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$chman.</NOTE> ho&s;tilities during the winter.</P>

<P>When the king returned to We&s;tmin&s;ter he &s;ummoned a parlia|ment to meet on the twentieth day of October; and in the mean time, am|ba&s;&s;adors arrived from the king of Portugal, offering in their ma&s;ter's name to recognize the duke of Lanca&s;ter as king of Ca&s;tile, provided he would join them with a reinforcement of Engli&s;h troops; and to give up in his favour all the conque&s;ts that &s;hould be made in that kingdom. The prince who at this time &s;at upon the Portugue&s;e throne was a natural brother of the late king Ferdinand, whom the &s;ubjects had inve&s;ted with the royal authority, in oppo|&s;ition to the king of Ca&s;tile, who claimed the crown of Portugal, by virtue of his wife, the only legitimate child of the decea&s;ed monarch. He had for|merly invaded the kingdom, from which he had been driven by the help of a body of Engli&s;h auxiliaries, who had not only rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Li&s;bon, but in a great mea&s;ure contributed to the victory which Ferdinand obtained over the Ca&s;tilians at Aljubarata. The king of Ca&s;tile, notwith&s;tanding this over|throw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1386.</NOTE> began to rea&s;&s;emble fre&s;h forces to renew his inva&s;ion; and Ferdinand being informed of his preparations, propo&s;ed this treaty to John duke of Lan|ca&s;ter, who was glad of every opportunity to a&s;&s;ert his preten&s;ions to Ca&s;tile. Richard, who was too volatile to retain re&s;entment, agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t his uncle in this expedition the more willingly, as it would remove a trouble&s;ome in|&s;pector of his conduct, who&s;e ambition would be employed in external objects. His project &s;eems to have been equally agreeable to the parliament, which granted a large &s;ub&s;idy for the voyage of John king of Ca&s;tile and Leon, the &s;ecurity of the coa&s;t, and the &s;afety of the Scotti&s;h Marches. The commons thinking they had a right to &s;ome conde&s;cen&s;ion from the crown, in return for this large &s;upply, petitioned that the oeconomy of the king's hou&s;hold might be in&s;pected by the chancellor, trea&s;urer, and keeper of the privy &s;eal; and that the antient &s;tatutes concerning the hou&s;hold might be ob&s;erved. They likewi&s;e demanded a li&s;t of the mini&s;try for the en&s;uing year; but Ri|chard evaded the fir&s;t by an equivocal an&s;wer, and peremptorily refu&s;ed to comply with the other demand. Far from giving them the lea&s;t hope of re|trenching his expences, he proceeded to new acts of extravagance and profu|&s;ion. The earl of Buckingham was created duke of Glouce&s;ter, and the earl of Cambridge promoted to the dukedom of York; and each received a grant of a thou&s;and pounds a year to &s;upport his new dignity. Michael de la<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl$</NOTE> Pole was created earl of Suffolk, and gratified with a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion, and Robert Vere earl of Oxford dignified with the title of Marquis of Dublin, to which was annexed a grant of all the revenues of Ireland, farmed for five thou&s;and marks a year. Leo, who had been expelled from his kingdom of Armenia, arriving in England, on pretence of negotiating a peace between the crowns of France and England, met with a magnificent reception from Ri|chard, who not only favoured him with a large appointment for his &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence while he re&s;ided in England, but likewi&s;e granted him a pen&s;ion of a thou&s;and pounds for life. The&s;e in&s;tances of extravagance, together with his ineffectual conference for a peace with the Scots and other enemies of the na|tion, increa&s;ed the clamours of the people, and rendered him an object of con|tempt with his own &s;ubjects.</P>

had obtained his pardon for the m$rder of Sir Ralph Stafford, and married the d$ke's daughter Elizabeth. T$e $h$ps being prepared for tran&s;porting his troops, he emba$$ed in the mo$th of July wit$ his wife Con&s;tance and his daughters, and &s;et fa$$ $or Bre$t, whic$ was at that time be&s;ieged b$ the French forces. Having landed his troo$$ he rai$ed the &s;iege, a$d r$$ed th$ works of t$e enem$. Then he proceed$$ on his voyage to Spain, and on the ninth day of Augu$t, arrived at Corun$$ in Galicia. He was readily admitted into the town, and undertook t$e &s;iege of t$e ca&s;t$e, whic$, however, he thou$ht proper to abandon, after having given &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful a&s;&s;aults. T$$$ $e advanced to Santiago de Compo&s;te$$a, w$ich &s;ubmitted at his approach; and from this p$ace he $ent out detachments to reduce the neighbo$ring towns towards the frontiers of Portugal: the&s;e being ea&s;ily &s;ubdued, he had an interview with Fer$inand, in w$ich they re&s;olved to invade Ca&s;t$$e with their united forces, in the be$inning of next &s;ummer. On this occa&s;ion too, the king o$ Portugal d$man$ed J$$n's $$cond daughter Philippa in marriage; and the nuptials were aft$rward$ $$$emnized with great magni$$cence at Oporto, where Ferdinand re+&s;ided. The Engli&s;h and Po$tugue&s;e armies joining in M$y, according to the p$$n wh$$h had been concerted, they entered the kingdom of Leon, where they re$$ced $$v$ral places, before the king of Ca&s;tile received t$e expected rein|forcement from France, which at length arriving, under the command of the duke of Bourbon, the Ca&s;t$lian monarch took the field, in o$$er to &s;top the progre&s;s of the enemy; but he indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided a battle, though the two armies $ay in &s;ight of each other during the greate&s;t part of the campaign, till the heats prod$cing an epidemical d$&s;temper among the Engli&s;h, they died in great numbers; and the &s;urvivors &s;uffered &s;o much $rom a &s;ca$city of provi&s;ions, that the duke and his Portugue&s;e &s;on-in-law were obliged to retire into Portu|gal. There he was &s;eized with a dangerous illne&s;s, which was not alleviated by<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> his hearing that all his conque&s;ts were lo&s;t in a fortnight a$ter his retreat. His knights, di&s;pirited by the mortality among the troops, de&s;ired and obtained leave to quit $$ch an unhealthy climate; and as the Engli&s;h fleet had been &s;ent home from Corunna, a great number of them retired to Ga&s;cony through the territories of Ca&s;tile, by virtue of pa&s;&s;ports granted by the king of that country. Thither al&s;o the duke repaired, after the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his health, and there found &s;ubject o$ con&s;olation for the di&s;a&s;ters he had undergone. The beauty of his daughter Catherine captivated the heart of the duke of Berry, uncle to the French king, who demanded her in marriage; and the father ex|pre&s;&s;ed a particular fondne&s;s for the alliance, though he was obliged to con&s;ult his nephew the king of Engl$nd on the &s;ubject. This an&s;wer &s;atisfied the duke o$ Berry, and John actually wrote an account of his propo&s;al to Richard; but in the mean time the news of this intended match reaching the court of Ca&s;tile, $i$$ed t$e king of that country with alarm: he fore&s;aw that &s;uch an alliance would naturally be attended with a peace between France and England; in wh$ch ca$e, both powers would unite in pro&s;ecuting the claim of Catherine to the crown of Ca&s;tile. In this apprehen&s;ion, he di&s;patched amba&s;&s;adors to the duke of Lanca&s;ter at Bayonne, with propo&s;als of a marriage between Catherine and his &s;on and heir Henry. The duke &s;aw immediately the advantage of &s;uch a coalition, by which his po&s;terity would be &s;ecured on the throne of Ca&s;tile; and made no &s;cruple of giving the preference to this propo&s;al over that of the

duke of Berry. The articles of the treaty were &s;oon &s;ettled, and the contract of marriage concluded on the&s;e terms: The crown of Ca&s;tile, after the death of the reigning prince, &s;hall de&s;cend to Henry and Catherine, and the i&s;&s;ue of their bodies; or, in default of &s;uch i&s;&s;ue, to the children of Edmund duke of York, by I&s;abel, the younger &s;i&s;ter of Con&s;tance: Two hundred thou&s;and crowns &s;hall be payed to the duke of Lanca&s;ter, towards the charges of his late expedition: He and his con&s;ort Con&s;tance &s;hall receive two hundred thou|&s;and florins annually, for their re&s;pective lives; and four Spani&s;h noblemen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingha$$ Froi&s;&s;art$</NOTE> &s;hall be given as ho&s;tages for the payment of the&s;e annuities.

<P>The French, encouraged by the ab&s;ence of this nobleman, with the choice&s;t troops of the kingdom, per&s;i&s;ted in their de&s;ign of invading England, and carried on their preparations with incredible a&s;&s;iduity. At fir&s;t it was &s;urmi&s;ed that they intended to be&s;iege Calais, and young Henry Percy, &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur, went thither to provide for its defence: but, being better informed, he &s;oon returned to England, where he gave notice of their de&s;tina|tion. This was no &s;ooner known, than the city of London was filled with terror and con&s;ternation; and the inhabitants ran about in di&s;traction to pull down the &s;uburbs, as if the enemy had already enoamped before the walls: nor could they recollect them&s;elves from their fears, until the king and council a&s;&s;embled a great number of country militia in the neighbourhood of the city. The ports and harbours were put in a po&s;ture of defence; and all the beacons on the coa&s;t prepared for giving the alarm, whenever the enemy &s;hould appear. A great number of men at arms was po&s;ted in different parts along the &s;hore; and a fleet of &s;hips &s;ent to &s;ea, with a view to watch the motions of the French tran&s;ports, and burn them after the troops &s;hould be landed. While the Engli&s;h were thus employed in putting the kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence, the French army a&s;&s;embled at Arras, to a prodigious number; and above twelve hundred ve&s;&s;els were collected at Sluys, which was the place appointed for their embarkation. They propo&s;ed to &s;ail about the beginning of Augu&s;t; but were obliged to wait till the middle of Sep|tember, for the duke of Berry, who did not much reli&s;h the undertaking, becau&s;e it had been concerted without his concurrence: and after he arrived with a reinforcement, they were detained by contrary winds, till the latter end of October, when they &s;et &s;ail with a favourable gale. They had not, how|ever, proceeded above ten leagues on their voyage, when the wind veered about, and increa&s;ed to a violent &s;torm, which &s;cattered their whole navy: part of it was driven back into the harbour of Sluys; part da&s;hed upon the rocks; and a con&s;iderable number of &s;traggling &s;hips were taken by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juv.

<P>England being now freed from the terrors of that cloud, which had &s;o long hovered over her with portentous a&s;pect, the militia which had been convened for the &s;ecurity of the city of London, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, though not before they had produced inexpre&s;&s;ible odium and rancour in the minds of the people again&s;t the mini&s;ter Michael de la Pole, who had made no provi&s;ion for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and therefore allowed them to live at free|quarter.
<PB N="162" REF="1640">
The councils of England had never been more weak and undeter|mined$ th$n at this juncture. The mini&s;try acted with the utmo&s;t timidity and di&s;traction; while the king, at the head of a mutinous army, indulged h$s pa&s;&s;ions with the mo&s;t unb$$dled licentiou&s;ne&s;s. His profu&s;ion &s;till went hand in hand with his profligacy and intemperance. He now created the marq$is of Dublin duke of Ireland, and he him&s;elf retained nothing but the bare &s;overeignty of that kingdom. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a prelate of worth and ability, was &s;et a&s;ide, and retired from all public concerns; while he of York, a per&s;on of a quite different character, engro&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare o$ his &s;overeign's favour. The dukes of York and Glouce&s;ter repined at their want of importance; the nation was di&s;&s;atisfied, and the people called aloud for an impeachment again&s;t the earl of Suffolk. Such was the &s;ituation of England, when the king a&s;&s;embled a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, on the fir&s;t day of October; and the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened by a &s;peech from the chan|cellor, who, after having explained the nature of the debts which the king had contracted, ventured to demand a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy from the laity and clergy; which he thought he had the better title to a&s;k, as Richard had re|mitted the taxes granted by the la&s;t parliament, on condition that he &s;hould go abroad, and pro&s;ecute the war in per&s;on. The commons, in&s;tead of com|plying with this demand, expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch re&s;entment again&s;t the mini&s;ter, that the king retired to E$tham in Kent; where he cho&s;e to dwell on his nece&s;&s;ity, rather than give &s;anction by his pre&s;ence to their proceedings again&s;t his fa|vourite chancellor. The members no &s;ooner under&s;tood his abrupt retreat, t$an they appointed a committee of lords and commons to wait upon his ma|j$&s;ty, and declare that they could not proceed to public bu&s;ine&s;s until the chancellor &s;hould be removed from his office. Richard, incen&s;ed at their pre&s;umption, commanded them in an imperious manner to con&s;ider and di&s;|patch the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation; and told them flatly, that he would not, at their de&s;ire, remove the meane&s;t &s;cullion from his kitchen. Notwith&s;tanding this repul&s;e, they per&s;i&s;ted in their demand, until the king, &s;eeing them de|termined, thought proper to de&s;ire a conference with forty members, em|powered to act in the name of the whole parliament. This propo&s;al might have been complied with, had not &s;ome intere&s;ted incendiaries indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread a report, that the king's aim was to &s;ecure and murder the&s;e repre&s;en|tatives. The parliament, alarmed at the&s;e in&s;inuations, deputed the duke of Glouce&s;ter and the bi&s;hop of Ely, as amba&s;&s;adors, to expo&s;tulate in a friendly manner with the king, on the indi&s;cretion of his conduct, and the ruinous mea&s;ures of his mini&s;try; as well as to declare the &s;entiments of the whole a&s;|&s;$mbly, touching their full purpo&s;e and final re&s;olution to do ju&s;tice upon tho&s;e evil coun&s;ellors, who had been the &s;ource of &s;uch mi&s;ery and oppre&s;|&s;$on to the nation. Richard is &s;aid to have at fir&s;t re&s;ented the freedom of $word$ addre&s;s; and even threatened to throw him&s;elf into the arms of France, rather than be a &s;lave to his own &s;ubjects. But the deputies demon&s;trating the $word$ con&s;equences of &s;uch a frantic &s;tep, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per|$$$ded; and prevailed u$on the earl of Suffolk to re&s;ign the great &s;eal, which was gi$en to the bi&s;hop of Ely: John de Fordham bi&s;hop of Durham was<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> removed from the o$$ice of trea&s;$rer, which was conferred upon the bi&s;hop $f Hereford; and John de Waltham was made keeper of the privy &s;eal.</P>

All the nobility and prelates, the officers of &s;tate and of the hou&s;hold, judges, ju&s;tices, barons, &s;heriffs, mayors, bailiffs, and all per&s;ons what&s;oever, were enjoined to be obedient, coun&s;elling, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the &s;aid coun&s;ellors, as often as, and in what manner, they &s;hould direct. When they had in this manner circum&s;cribed the king's prerogative, they freely voted a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy for the defence of the nation; and the greate&s;t part of the money ari&s;ing from their grant was depo&s;ited in the hands of the earl of Arundel, lord high admiral of England, to be expended in &s;e|curing the coa&s;t from the de&s;cent of the enemy. In order to make &s;ome amends for the freedoms they had taken with the king and his admini&s;tration, they granted the ran&s;om of the heirs of Charles de Blois to his favourite the duke of Ireland, on condition that he &s;hould repair to that kingdom before Ea&s;ter, and recover at his own expence, from the Iri&s;h rebels, the great e&s;tate which had been granted to him with his la&s;t patent. This indulgence was no other than a gentle method taken to &s;eparate him from the king, who per|ceived their drift, and glowed with indignation at the in&s;ults they had offered to his authority. On the very la&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, when he had nothing further to hope or fear from their re&s;olutions, he gave a loo&s;e to his re&s;ent|ment, which he had hitherto &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and prote&s;ted in full parliament, that nothing done in that &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hould prejudice him, his crown, or royal pre|rogative. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>After the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of this parliament, the new council began to take mea&s;ures for defeating the &s;chemes of the enemy. Treaties of alliance were brought upon the carpet with &s;everal foreign potentates, particularly with the court of Gueldre, and the republic of Genoa, which was at this period one of the &s;tronge&s;t maritime powers in Europe. The Engli&s;h cruizers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e fitted out from the Cinque-Ports, harra&s;&s;ed the trade of France, and committed depredations upon their coa&s;ts with great &s;ucce&s;s; and young Henry Piercy began to render him&s;elf famous by his ho&s;tile excur|&s;ions from Calais, where he &s;erved as a volunteer. Richard, mean while, was reduced to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity by his extravagance and exce&s;s, that he was obliged to borrow money of his &s;ubjects, to whom, as a &s;ecurity, he granted a&s;&s;ignments on the taxes to be laid by the en&s;uing parliament. He relea&s;ed the earl of Suffolk, and re-admitted him into his councils and confidence: he retained the duke of Ireland about his per&s;on; continued immer&s;ed in riot and debauchery; and &s;eemed bent upon revoking every thing which had pa&s;&s;ed in the late parliament. While he thus indulged him&s;elf at Wind&s;or, in the mid&s;t of &s;ycophants and pandars, the citizens of London, being introduced by his two uncles and other noblemen, pre&s;ented a petition, reque&s;ting that he would di&s;mi&s;s his mini&s;ters, who were no other than blood-&s;uckers that preyed upon him and the nation, and allow them to be &s;ecured until they could be brought to trial, and puni&s;hed according to their demerit. Richard, &s;tartled at this application, thought proper to temporize, and &s;oothe them with ge|neral promi&s;es of redre&s;s: but they had no &s;ooner withdrawn, than his fa|vourites interpreted the manner of this addre&s;s into open rebellion; and they are &s;aid to have concerted a plan for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the duke of Glouce&s;ter and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$roiffart.</NOTE> &s;ome other chiefs of the oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The earl of Arundel exerted him&s;elf &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly in equipping a fleet, that in the beginning of the year he was in a condition to put to &s;ea, ju&s;t as the French had laid up their ve&s;&s;els for that &s;ea&s;on. In his crui&s;e he fell in with a rich fleet of Spani&s;h, French, and Flemi&s;h &s;hips, under the convoy of a &s;quadron from Flanders and Ca&s;tile, which he attacked with great fury, and met with a warm reception. The battle was fought for &s;ome time with equal ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides; but victory at length declared for the Engli&s;h, who took the Flemi&s;h admiral and &s;ix and fifty &s;hips that were under his protection. They afterwards pur&s;ued the fugitives two days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, until the number of their prizes amounted to one hundred and twenty-&s;ix, the greater part of which was taken by the earl of Nottingham, a young nobleman of a very pro|mi&s;ing genius. The&s;e &s;hips were &s;carce brought into harbour, when advice came, that Bre&s;t was again be&s;ieged by the French forces. The earl im|mediately &s;et &s;ail for Brittany, where he rai&s;ed the blockade of Bre&s;t, demo|li&s;hed two forts which had been rai&s;ed by the enemy to &s;trengthen the place, and &s;upplied it with a whole year's provi&s;ion.</P>

<P>By this time the French council had altered their plan of inva|&s;ion; and, in&s;tead of embarking at Sluys, re&s;olved to divide their armament, and make two different de&s;cents in Suffolk and Kent, the fir&s;t to be com|manded by John de Vienne, and the other by the con&s;table de Cli&s;&s;on, who was ordered to embark at Lhan Trequier, in Brittany. John de Montfort duke of this province had been &s;o in&s;olently treated, and his &s;ubjects &s;o grie|vou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed by the French government, that he formed the re&s;olution of renouncing his dependence on that crown, and throwing him&s;elf again into the hands of the Engli&s;h. With this view he had actually engaged in a pri|vate negotiation with Richard; and the con&s;table &s;u&s;pecting him of &s;ome &s;uch de&s;ign, kept a watchful eye on his conduct. He had communicated his &s;u&s;|picion to the council of France, and even prevailed with them to ran&s;om the &s;on of his old competitor Charles de Blois, who &s;till remained an ho&s;tage in England. Montfort, alarmed at this tran&s;action, from whence he ea&s;ily con|ceived the motive of the French mini&s;try, which was to &s;et up the young De Blois as his rival in the dutchy; and being moreover actuated by the furies of jealou&s;y again&s;t the con&s;table, who is &s;aid to have been enamoured of his dutche&s;s, he determined to &s;urprize that nobleman before he &s;hould be aware of his intention. The forces under the con&s;table's command being cantoned at Lentriguet in Brittany, the duke invited him to an entertainment at Vannes, where, after having treated him with particular marks of di&s;tinction and friend|&s;hip, he cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted, loaded with &s;hackles, and impri&s;oned in a dungeon: a perfidious breach of ho&s;pitality, by which however he di&s;pelled his own apprehen&s;ion, gratified his per&s;onal re&s;entment, and recommended him&s;elf effectually to the Engli&s;h; for, as the con&s;table was the &s;oul of the pur|po&s;ed inva&s;ion, his misfortune was no &s;ooner known than the French coun&s;els were di&s;concerted; the troops, which placed all their &s;ucce&s;s in the valour and<NOTE PLACE="marg">D' Argentr&eacute;.

but that of its growing into di&s;grace with the people, from the mi&s;carriage of its mea&s;ures. The king repined at the &s;ucce&s;s of the earl of Nottingham, who was lord mare&s;$hal, and even envied his reputation. When that noble|man returned to court, after having &s;o gallantly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf under the admiral, he met with a cold and mortifying reception, though he had been brought up with Richard from his infancy. The earl of Arundel was utterly neglected, and his commi&s;&s;ion of admiral given to Henry Piercy &s;ur|named Hot&s;pur, who&s;e courage, in the opinion of the favourites, would ei|ther eclip&s;e the fame of Nottingham and Arundel, and overballance the popu|larity they had acquired, or induce him to engage in enterprizes that might end in his de&s;truction; for they knew he was no well-wi&s;her to the court, and therefore inve&s;ted him with this command, which would either fini&s;h the ca|reer of his ambition or excite an emulation and re&s;entment between two fac|tious chiefs of the oppo&s;ition. Though he was poorly equipped, he under|took the charge of guarding the coa&s;t, and executed his office with equal acti|vity and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;couring the channel and keeping the enemy in continual alarm. The duke of Ireland, in&s;tead of complying with the ordinance of parliament, in repairing to that kingdom, continued at court, where his in|fluence daily increa&s;ed, and encouraged the king in all his profligacy and li|centiou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o that he was become the object of the people's aver&s;ion, and took &s;o little pains to be well with the nobility, that he &s;eemed to &s;et them all at defiance. He had married Philippa grand-daughter to king Edward III. by his daughter I&s;abel, wife to the lord Coucy, a lady of great virtue and ac|compli&s;hments; and now being captivated by the beauty of one Lancerona, a Bohemian dam&s;el who waited upon the queen, he repudiated the king's kin&s;|woman, and took this foreigner to his bed; while Richard overlooked the<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$$$$gham.</NOTE> indignity.</P>

<P>The duke of Glouce&s;ter was &s;o incen&s;ed at the in&s;ult offered to his family, that he devoted Vere to de&s;truction; and from that day began to take mea&s;ures for delivering the kingdom from &s;uch a pernicious mini&s;try. In an a&s;&s;embly of the principal noblemen at London he voluntarily made oath, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to the bi&s;hop of London, that he had always &s;erved the king to the be&s;t of his judgment and the utmo&s;t of his power, and never har|boured a thought to his prejudice. He then explained the in&s;olence and mi&s;|conduct of the duke of Ireland, who had di&s;honoured the royal family, de|ceived the king, and contributed to the ruin of the nation; and declared his firm re&s;olution to bring him and his confederates to ju&s;tice. The bi&s;hop, con|vinced of Glouce&s;ter's &s;incerity, imparted this a&s;&s;everation to the king; and the earl of Suffolk affecting to turn it into ridicule, <Q>&startq;My lord (&s;aid the pre|late) &s;uch language would come better from any per&s;on than from you, who &s;tand condemned by the parliament, and owe your life to the king's clemency.&endq;</Q> Richard, exa&s;perated at the freedom of this expo&s;tulation, not only reproached the bi&s;hop for his pre&s;umption, but ordered him to be turned out of the apartment with di&s;grace. Every thing now &s;eemed to portend an open rupture between the king and the barons: the emi&s;&s;aries of both &s;ides were employed to revile and expo&s;e each other; every circum&s;tance of mi&s;con|duct in the king or his mini&s;try, was aggravated by the mo&s;t in&s;idious exagge|ration; and on the other hand, every &s;truggle for liberty, and every precau|tion

of &s;elf-defence, was interpreted into the efforts of lawle&s;s ambition, and a premeditated de&s;ign of mutiny and rebellion. The oppo&s;ition was conducted by the king's two uncles, the earls of Nottingham, Arundel, Warwick, and Derby the elde&s;t &s;on of John duke of Lanca&s;ter, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for his courage and &s;agacity, and married the younger daughter and coheir of Humphrey de Bohun earl of Hereford and Northampton. The&s;e two earldoms, with the lord&s;hip of Brecknock, he enjoyed in right of this mar|riage; and the king had two years before this period created him earl of Derby; &s;o that he was one of the mo&s;t powerful noblemen in England, even during the life of his father, whom he greatly excelled in point of under&s;tanding and policy. The&s;e noblemen having engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t the mini&s;try, retired to their re&s;pective habitations in the country, with a view to rai&s;e forces for the execution of their de&s;ign; and they had no &s;ooner quitted London, than the king ordered &s;everal citizens of their faction to be apprehended for high trea&s;on. They were &s;o intimidated by this unexpected arre&s;t, that in order to &s;ave their lives, they confe&s;&s;ed what they knew of the plan which the lords of the oppo&s;ition had formed; and the court di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them without further puni&s;hment, in order to make a merit of &s;uch clemency, and engage the peo|ple in the king's intere&s;t. This mea&s;ure was artfully taken, and produced a con&s;iderable effect in Richard's favour. The &s;ame expedient was repeated at Coventry with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s; and the king and queen, with the archbi&s;hop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, and his other favourites, made a progre&s;s into the we&s;tern counties, in hope of prevailing upon the peo|ple to e&s;pou&s;e the royal cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t of influencing the election for a new parliament, that it might be more propitious than the la&s;t, which had &s;o in&s;o|lently abridged the prerogative.</P>

<P>Having made an excur&s;ion to the borders of Wales they returned to Nottingham, to which place they had &s;ummoned the &s;heriffs of the counties, the principal citizens of London, and the judges of England: they tampered with the fir&s;t to return &s;uch members as would buckle to the court mea&s;ures, with the citizens to furni&s;h men and money to quell the oppo&s;ition, and with the judges to &s;train the laws in favour of the admini&s;tration.

The&s;e being tutored for the purpo&s;e, de|clared, in an authentic in&s;trument, that the ordinance and commi&s;&s;ion enacted and granted in the la&s;t parliament, was derogatory to the king's prerogative; and tho&s;e who procured it, ought to be puni&s;hed with death; that tho&s;e who &s;traitened the king in the exerci&s;e of his prerogative, ought to be puni&s;hed as traitors; that the king had a right to call and govern a parliament, to propo&s;e the &s;ubjects of their deliberation, and pre&s;cribe the method in which they &s;hould proceed; that tho&s;e who po&s;tponed the &s;ubjects &s;o &s;pecified, and proceeded to other bu&s;ine&s;s contrary to the king's plea&s;ure, were guilty of trea&s;on, and ought to be puni&s;hed accordingly; that the king had a right to di&s;&s;olve the parliament, and command the members to depart, on pain of being puni&s;hed as traitors; that the lords and commons had no right to impeach in parliament any of the king's judges or officers, without the leave of his maje&s;ty; and tho&s;e who

<P>While Richard and his cabal endeavoured in vain to rai&s;e forces to &s;upport him in the execution of his weak and arbitrary de&s;igns, he received intelligence that Glouce&s;ter and the confederated lords had a&s;&s;embled a nu|merous army, and were on their march towards London. As the king had &s;e|cured a &s;trong party by his late popular proceedings among the lower cla&s;s of citizens, and Brembre the mayor was entirely at his devotion, he ha&s;tened up to that metropolis, in order to anticipate the &s;ucce&s;s of his adver&s;aries; and was received with great magnificence by Brembre, who undertook to rai&s;e fifty thou|&s;and men for his &s;ervice.

<P>They ab&s;tained from all acts of violence; profe&s;&s;ed a deep &s;en&s;e of the calamities attending civil di&s;cord; propo&s;ed &s;chemes of accommodation; and by their private emi&s;&s;aries inflamed the re&s;entment of the people again&s;t the king, by &s;preading fal&s;e reports to his prejudice. It was reported that, under the pretext of a pilgrimage to Canterbury, Richard intended to cro&s;s the &s;ea, and deliver up Calais to the king of France, who, in con&s;ideration of that ce&s;&s;ion, had agreed to furni&s;h him with an army to &s;ubdue his rebellious &s;ub|jects, and e&s;tabli&s;h an arbitrary government in England. This report, circu|lated with a detail of circum&s;tances which gave it an air of truth, met with the more credit, on account of the late determination of the judges, which alarmed every well-wi&s;her to the con&s;titution of his country. The archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury and the neutral lords, interpo&s;ed their good offices towards a pacifica|tion; but their propo&s;als were cooly received by Richard, until he had made
<PB N="169" REF="1710">
a fruitle&s;s attempt to &s;eize the earl of Arundel in his ca&s;tle at Ryegate; and not only found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his expectations from Brembre, but like|wi&s;e &s;aw the army of the confederates increa&s;ed to a mo&s;t formidable appearance. Then his heart failed him; and he con&s;ented to a per&s;onal interview with the duke of Glouce&s;ter and his a&s;&s;ociates, who would not, however, attend him in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, until they had received a &s;afe-conduct for the &s;ecurity of their per&s;ons. At the very hour fixed for this conference, they pretended to have di&s;covered that a body of armed men, commanded by Sir Thomas Trive$ and Sir Nicholas Brembre, was concealed at the Mews, in order to appre|hend and de&s;troy them; and therefore they refu&s;ed to &s;et out for We&s;tmin&s;ter, until the avenues were examined: &s;o that the king &s;at upon his throne a full hour be$ore they arrived. At length they entered the hall, and approaching the throne with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, fell upon their knees, and remained a con&s;i|derable time in that po&s;ture, before Richard de&s;ired the duke of Glouce&s;ter to ri&s;e. The bi&s;hop of Ely reprimanded them in very &s;evere terms, for having pre&s;umed to take up arms again&s;t their &s;overeign, who could have cru&s;hed them into du&s;t; and then they were commanded to explain their grievances. The lords made no reply to the bi&s;hop, but &s;till retaining the marks of hu|mility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, pre&s;ented a writing, in which they demanded that the archbi&s;hop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Robert Tre&s;i|lian, and Nicholas Brembre, &s;hould be removed from his maje&s;ty's councils and pre&s;ence for ever, as traitors to their king and country. Having delivered this petition they threw down their gauntlets, appealing to the combat-evidence for the truth of their allegations. Richard, intimidated by the coolne&s;s and re&s;olution they manife&s;ted on this occa&s;ion, laid a&s;ide his imperious deport|ment, and with great affability an&s;wered their petition. He told them their grievances &s;hould be con&s;idered and redre&s;&s;ed, in the parliament which he had &s;ummoned to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of the nation; and in the mean time exhort|ing them to avoid all quarrels and di&s;&s;ention, took both parties under his im|mediate protection. Then he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, with a&s;&s;urances of per&s;onal kind|ne&s;s and regard; and to convince them of his &s;incerity, in a few days pub|li&s;hed a proclamation, clearing the duke of Glouce&s;ter and the earls of Arun|del and Warwick from the imputation of trea&s;on, which had been thrown upon them by the five per&s;ons they had appealed to comb$t, and requiring tho&s;e accu&s;ers to an&s;wer for their charge in parliament. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Knyghton.

The&s;e tidings were no &s;ooner reported to the confederates, than they $ent the earl of Derby with a con&s;iderable detachment to &s;top his progre&s;s, and he en|countered him near Radcot-Bridge in Oxford&s;hire. The duke had not courage to &s;tand the fir&s;t charge, but fled towards the bridge, which being broken down,

By this time Richard had taken up his re&s;idence in the Tower, where he found him&s;elf in a very forlorn condition, abandoned by every body but a few atten|dants, who were &s;o di&s;tracted with their own fears, that they could neither pro|perly advi&s;e nor a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;uch an emergency.

This weak prince was no &s;ooner freed from the intimidating pre&s;ence of the confederated lords, than he was per&s;uaded by his courtiers to retract a promi&s;e which derogated &s;o much from the dignity of a monarch; and the lords, having drawn up their whole army on Tower-Hill, which was then very exten&s;ive, that he might be terri|fied by the &s;ight of &s;uch a number, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to declare that if he &s;hould continue to trifle with them, they would deliberate upon rai&s;ing another prince to the throne. Alarmed at this declaration, he promi&s;ed faithfully to keep his appointment at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and punctually fulfilled his engagement. There he complied with every thing they propo&s;ed; and gave up all his favourites, without di&s;tinction of &s;ex or quality. The archbi&s;hop of York and the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter had already accompli&s;hed a retreat. Among tho&s;e that re|mained were the bi&s;hop of Durham, fri$r Ru&s;hak the king's confe&s;&s;or, the lords Zouch of Haringworth, Burnel, and Beaumont, Sir Alberic de Vere, Sir Baldwin Beresford, Sir John Worth, Sir Thomas Clifford, Sir John Lovel, together with &s;everal ladies of loo&s;e morals, who had conduced to the corruption and profligacy of the court. The&s;e were either confined in different parts of the kingdom, obliged to give &s;ecurity for their appearance in court, to whatever might be laid to their charge, or bani&s;hed the king's pre&s;ence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An$ Ch. 1388.</NOTE> Sir Simon Burley, Sir Thomas Trivet, Sir Nicholas Brembre, Sir John Beau|champ of Holt, Sir William Ellingham, John Blake; and the following ec|cle&s;ia$tics, Richard Clifford, John de Lincoln, Richard Matford, and Nicho|las Lake, were committed to clo&s;e pri&s;on, that they might be brought to trial immediately.

<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened by Thomas Fitz-Alan, bi&s;hop of Ely and chancellor of the kingdom, who declared they were a&s;&s;embled to reform the admini&s;tration, advi&s;e the king, and concert mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the &s;ea and the Marches of the kingdom, relieving Guienne, and rai&s;ing mo|ney in the ea&s;ie&s;t manner for the&s;e purpo&s;es. As &s;oon as the chancellor had fini&s;hed his &s;peech, the duke of Glouce&s;ter falling upon his knees, offered to &s;tand trial before his peers, or maintain his innocence in any other &s;hape, touching a malicious report which had been circulated to his prejudice, as if he intended to dethrone the king and u&s;urp the &s;overeign authority: but Richard declaring him&s;elf perfectly convinced of the malice of this a&s;per&s;ion, he was acquitted of all &s;uch &s;u&s;picion. Then the lords &s;piritual and temporal de|manded a confirmation of their claim, liberty, and franchi&s;es, of trying and judging all important cau&s;es, relating to the peers, in the cour&s;e of parliament, independent of the common or civil law of the realm; and their claim was al|lowed and confirmed accordingly, under the &s;anction$of parliament. This ca|pital privilege being a&s;certained, the five noblemen appellants &s;tood up to ex|hibit their appeals, when the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in behalf of him&s;elf and the prelates of his province, entered a prote&s;t, a&s;&s;erting their rights to &s;it as barons and peers of the realm, and hear and determine all cau&s;es what&s;o|ever brought before the tribunal; and declaring that this their right &s;hould not be prejudiced by their withdrawing on this occa&s;ion, in obedience to the canons of the church, that prohibited them from a&s;&s;i&s;ting at any trial again&s;t the life of a fellow creature. Another declaration and prote&s;t of the &s;ame nature was made by the bi&s;hop of Durham and Carlile; and their right being acknow|ledged, they withdrew. The temporal lords being thus left to them&s;elves, the appellants exhibited their charge again&s;t the archbi&s;hop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Tre&s;ilian, and Sir Nicholas Brembre, in thirty-nine articles of various texture, containing accu&s;ations of trea&s;ons and mi&s;demeanors indi&s;criminately. The&s;e la&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in their rendering the king inacce&s;&s;ible to his nobility, except in their pre&s;ence; their intercepting the king's favours, and creating mi&s;under&s;tandings between him and his nobility; their obtaining grants of Ireland, and Okeham, with its fore&s;t, in favour of Ro|bert de Vere; their bribery and corruption; their i$$uing great $ums to the duke of Ireland, and ob&s;tructing the ordinances of parliament; their &s;elling commands of importance in Guienne and the Marches of Scotland, to un|qualified per&s;ons; their ob&s;tructing the cour&s;e of law; procuring pardons for felons and traitors; maintaining &s;uits and quarrels; excluding lords and other members from the king's council; advi&s;ing the king to ab&s;ent him&s;elf, and avoid treating with the la&s;t parliament; per&s;uading him to convene &s;ome lords, judges, and others, and demand their opinions on &s;everal matters, in a &s;u&s;picious manner; prevailing upon gentlemen in England and Wales, to take
<PB N="172" REF="1740">
oaths and give &s;ecurity for &s;tanding by the king again&s;t all per&s;ons, by which obligations the realm was involved in trouble and confu&s;ion; &s;ecluding the king at a di&s;tance from the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed in parliament; ran&s;oming John de Blois, without warrant or con&s;ent of parliament$ er of the great coun|cil; advi&s;ing the king to di&s;tingui&s;h his retinue with badges; procuring the opinions of $al&s;e judges at Nottingham, in order to de&s;troy, under colo$r of l$w, all concerned in the late commi&s;&s;ion and &s;tatute; int$nding to indict the lords and other$ upon tho&s;e opinions, and arre&s;t the duke of Lanca&s;ter, in ca&s;e he had arrived in England; per&s;uading the king that the commi&s;&s;ion and &s;ta|tute were calculated $or depo&s;ing him $rom the throne of his ance&s;tors; pre|vailing upon the companies of London to &s;wear they would $ive and die with the king again&s;t all his enemies, at a time when he looked upon the commi&s;|&s;ioners to be traitors; publi&s;hing a proclamation in that city, forbidding all per&s;ons to aid or a&s;&s;i&s;t the earl of Arundel with arms or provi&s;ions; and ano|ther, forbidding every body to &s;peak with di&s;re&s;pect of the per&s;ons appealed; and per&s;uading the king to &s;end a li&s;t of per&s;ons to his council, that they might be appointed &s;heriffs, with a view to pack a par$iament. Sir Nicholas Brembre was charged with having ordered &s;everal criminals to be taken out of Newgate by night, and executed illegally. The duke of Ireland was accu&s;ed of having acted as chief ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, without warrant or commi&s;&s;ion; of having rai&s;ed forces to de&s;troy the lords and the king's lieges, and attempting to kill the appellants at the battle of Radcot-Bridge. The other articles, amounting to a charge of trea&s;on, were their &s;ugge&s;ting fal&s;hoods to the king, and oblig|ing him to &s;wear he would be governed by their coun&s;els, and live and die in their defence; their advi&s;ing his maje&s;ty to confer the title of king of Ireland on Robert de Vere; and to write to the pope for a confirmation of that title; their coun&s;elling the king to put all the lords and commons of the la&s;t parlia|ment to death, except &s;uch as were of their own party; their per&s;uading his maje&s;ty that the late commi&s;&s;ion and &s;tatute were made to &s;ubvert his royal au|thority; and that all concerned in procuring and advi&s;ing it ought to be pu|ni&s;hed as traitors; their prevailing upon the king to &s;end Nicholas Southwell his valet, and other mean per&s;ons, with letters to the king of France, de&s;iring his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to de&s;troy the lords and others whom he deemed traitors; and in con&s;ideration of &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, promi&s;ing to give up Cherbourg, Bre&s;t, and Calais; their &s;ending to France for &s;afe-conducts for the king, the duke of Ireland, and others, who intended to go thither and execute the&s;e trea&s;onable de&s;ings; advi&s;ing the king to i&s;&s;ue orders for knights and gentlemen to ri&s;e with the duke of Ireland; to write letters to the &s;aid duke, repre&s;enting him&s;elf in the utmo&s;t danger unle&s;s &s;peedily relieved, pre&s;&s;ing him to march to his a&s;&s;i&s;t$nce, and promi&s;ing to meet him with all his forces. Such were the ar|ticles exhibited again&s;t the archbi&s;hop of York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Tre&s;ilian, and Sir Nicholas Brembre, who being &s;um|moned in the chamber of the parliament in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, and at the great gate of the palace, without appearing to an&s;wer to the charge, the appellants moved that the default might be recorded, and the lords proceed to judgment. The king ordered &s;ome judges, &s;erjeants, and others learned in the law, to de|liberate upon the nature of this impeachment, and deliver their opinion to the lords; and the&s;e$ after having con&s;ulted together, declared it informal, and con|trary

to the methods of pro&s;ecution pre&s;cribed by the civil law and the &s;tatutes of the realm. Notwith&s;tanding this declaration, the lords, with the king's con&s;ent, re&s;olved, that in &s;uch a cau&s;e, affecting his maje&s;ty's per&s;on and the &s;tate of the kingdom, and implying &s;uch heinous crimes committed by peers and other a&s;&s;ociates, the right of trying and judging was ve&s;ted in the lords of parliament, according to their franchi&s;e and liberty, to judge and be judged in &s;uch ca&s;es with the king's a&s;&s;ent, independent of any law what&s;oever; that they would proceed in the &s;ame manner with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and determine it by award of parliament: they therefore adjudged, that the ap|peal was well made and duly affirmed, and the proce&s;s valid according to the law and cour&s;e of parliament.</P>

<P>The appellants being thus allowed to proceed, de&s;ired again that the default of the accu&s;ed might be recorded; and, the citation being re|peated, they demanded judgment. The king and the lords temporal, without having examined any evidence, being in their con&s;ciences per&s;uaded of the truth of the articles, pronounced the per&s;ons appealed guilty of high trea&s;on. Their e&s;tates were forfeited, the archbi&s;hop's temporalities &s;eized, and his per&s;on was re&s;erved for further deliberation; but the others were &s;entenced to be drawn and hanged as traitors. Tre&s;ilian being betrayed by his own &s;ervant, was taken in a mean di&s;gui&s;e, and brought before the parliament, which or|dered him to be executed immediately at Tyburn. The earl of Suffolk and duke of Ireland had fled beyond &s;ea. Alexander archbi&s;hop of York was &s;eized at Shields, attempting to go on board of a &s;hip in di&s;gui&s;e; but the duke of Glouce&s;ter would not inflict any puni&s;hment on his per&s;on, le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;oblige the prelates of his party; and prevailed upon the pope to tran&s;late him from York to St. Andrew's in Scotland. This tran&s;lation, how|ever, did not take place, becau&s;e Scotland acknowledged the authority of Clement the antipope; and Alexander was allowed to retire to Flanders, where he &s;erved the cure of a &s;mall pari&s;h till the day of his death. The earl of Suffolk did not many months &s;urvive his di&s;grace; and the duke of Ire|land died in a few years at Louvain, of the wounds he received in hunting a wild boar in Brabant. Sir Nicholas Brembre being brought before the par|liament to hear the articles read, denied the charge; and, as a knight, claimed the privilege of proving his innocence in &s;ingle combat: but this mo|tion being over-ruled by the parliament, he was brought to the bar, con|demned, and delivered into the hands of the earl mare&s;chal; who, with the mayor, aldermen, and &s;heriffs of London, attended at his execution. The&s;e pro&s;ecutions being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the lords &s;piritual and temporal declared that nothing contained in the appeal &s;hould reflect upon the king him&s;elf, or be interpreted to the prejudice of his per&s;on. Then the commons proceeded to impeach the other evil coun&s;ellors, by whom his maje&s;ty had been mi&s;led. The judges, who delivered and &s;igned their opinions at Nottingham, were condemned to die as traitors; their heir$ were di&s;inherited, and their e&s;tates forfeited: the &s;ame &s;entence was denounced again&s;t John Blake for drawing up the que&s;tions, and Thomas Hu&s;ke for aidi$g and abetting the &s;cheme of arre&s;ting and indicting the noblemen of the oppo&s;ition. The&s;e were hurried to immediate execution; but the judges were, through the inter$e&s;&s;ion of the bi&s;hops, pardoned as to life and limb, though &s;ent into perpetual exile in dif|ferent

parts of Ireland. Sir Simon Burley, Sir John Beauchamp of Holt, b$ro$ o$ Kiddermin&s;ter, Sir John Sah&s;b$ry, and Sir James Berners, were im|p$$$hed by the commons, $s aiders and abettors of the five per&s;ons appealed a$d a$taint$d; and B$rl$y, in partic$lar, was charged with having connived at S$ff$$k's e$$ape; with having a&s;&s;i$t$d the d$ke o$ Ireland in rai&s;ing forces; with having in$$$d$ced him i$to co$rt, and proc$red for him a grant of the We$&s;h e&s;t$te which had belong$d to his wi$e's father the lord of Coucy; w$$h having introduced to the $i$g the mayor of Dover, who a&s;&s;ured his ma|je&s;ty he would &s;end a thou&s;and ab$e-bodied m$n of the Cinque-Ports to his a$$i&s;tance again&s;t the app$l$ants. All the&s;e knights denied the charge, and of|fered to a&s;&s;ert their innoc$nce in &s;i$gle combat; and the lords took time to con&s;ider the ca&s;e till the m$$ting of parliament, which was adjourned during the Ea&s;ter hol$days. In t$is interval, great intere&s;t was u&s;ed in favour of Sir Simon B$rley, who had $rought up the king from his infancy, conducted the queen from Bohemia, and was univer&s;al$y beloved for his amiable cha|racter. The q$een her&s;elf interceded earne&s;tly for his life; the earl of Derby $&s;ed all his influence with the duke of Glouce&s;ter to &s;ave him; and, his in|&s;tances proving ineffectual, was &s;o chagrined, that his re&s;entment had well $igh produced di&s;&s;en&s;ion among the appellants. Burley was condemned to die the death of a traitor$ but, as he was a knight of the garter, the king, with the con&s;ent of the lords, remitted part of the &s;entence, and he &s;uffered decapi|tation on Tower-Hill: Beauchamp and Berners were al&s;o beheaded; but the &s;entence was executed in all its rigour upon Sali&s;bury.</P>

<P>The&s;e &s;acrifices being made to ju&s;tice, and, perhaps, to faction and reve$ge, the par$$ament pa&s;&s;ed an act of amne&s;ty and pardon, in favour of all who had been about the king's per&s;on; or of the retinue, company, coun&s;el, a&s;&s;ent, or adherence of tho&s;e who had been attainted and condemned; except|ing, however, certain per&s;ons of the clergy, as well as of the la$ty, who were excl$ded by name from the benefit of this pardon. The attainted per&s;ons, &s;till a$$$e, were rendered incapable of being re&s;tored to the protection of the law; any pardon that they might obtain was, by anticipation, declared null: and it was enact$d, that any per&s;on &s;olliciting or endeavouring to procure any grace in their behalf, &s;hould be tried, condemned, and executed as a traitor. By an$ther act, the commi&s;&s;ion and &s;tatute of the preceding year, with the proceedi$gs of the la&s;t parliament, and all the proc$edings of the appellants and their part$&s;ans, were confirmed; and the$e la&s;t, including the Londo$ers nominally, were ind$lged with a pardon for all $elonies, in&s;urr$ctions, mur|d$rs, and other crimes they might have committed. The appeals, impeach|ments, judgments, and exec$tions, made and awarded in this parliament, were approved, affirmed, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;ence of the lords &s;p$r$t$al; with the provi&s;o, however, that this $pprobation, affirmation, a$d e$tab$$&s;hment, &s;hould not be drawn into examp$e or con&s;equence: and, that although divers po$nts had been adjudged trea&s;on in this parliament, which were not declared to be &s;uch in any &s;t$tute; yet no judges &s;hould be empowered to give judgment in any $ut$re ca&s;es of trea&s;on, $xcept in the u&s;$al manner practi&s;ed b$fore this parliament.

This ceremony being performed, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and his clergy denounced the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t all who &s;hould attempt to di&s;turb the peace and quiet of the kingdom. The commons had already continued the duty upon wine and merchandize, and granted an half tenth and half $ifteenth to defray the charge of a &s;ea-expedition: but now they continued the &s;ub&s;idy on wool and leather; and a&s;&s;igned twenty thou&s;and pounds of the produce to the appellants, for the charges of their pro&s;ecution, and other &s;ervices. After the$e important tran&s;actions, the &s;e&s;&s;ion, which had continued from the third day of February to the fourth day of June, broke up, with the app$$lation of The Mercile&s;s Parliament; and another was held in the &s;ame year at Cambridge, where many whole&s;ome regulations were made, touching the civil polity of the kingdom, and the grievance of re|pairing to Rome for benefices; and, in this a&s;&s;embly, a &s;ub&s;idy was granted both by the clergy and laity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>While the lords and commons of the oppo&s;ition exerted them&s;elves in parliament again&s;t the king's favourites and prerogatives, the earl of Arundel, having received a commi&s;&s;ion as governor of Bre&s;t, and a renewal of that by which he was con&s;tituted lord hi$h admiral of England, went to &s;ea with a &s;quadron immediately a$ter whit&s;$ntide; and, falling in with a French f$$et, took four&s;cor$ of their &s;hips, which he brought &s;afe to England; after having ravaged the i&s;lands of Rh$e and Oleron, and alarmed the whole coa&s;t of France from one end of the channel to the other. He &s;ailed again in autumn with a numerous fleet, having on board the earl of Nottingham, the lord Clifford, Sir Thomas Piercy, and many other volunteers of di&s;tinction, with a body of &s;ix thou&s;and land forces. His purpo&s;e was not only to har|ra&s;s the French, but to per&s;uade the duke of Brittany to declare openly again&s;t Charles. This noble fleet, however, was di&s;per&s;ed by a terrible &s;torm; and the earl him&s;elf, with &s;even and twenty &s;hips, obliged to take refuge in the &s;mall port of La Pates, within a league of Rochelle. The ca&s;tle of Bouteville, in that neighbourhood, was then be&s;ieged by the marechal de Sancerre, who, being informed of the earl's arrival and &s;hattered condition, ordered the in|habitants to block up the harbour with eight gallies; while, rai&s;ing the &s;iege, he marched with his army to attack them by land, &s;o that he thought they could not po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape. But he was baffled by the vigilance and activity of Arundel, who had refitted his &s;hips before the other could execute his plan; and, having intelligence of the marechal's de&s;ign, put to &s;ea, in order to meet the gallies, which he intirely de&s;troyed; then returning to the harbour, and l$nding his men, he drove the French general to the gates of Rochelle. While his troops lay encamped in this place, he was joined by La Bernoy, who commanded the fort of Galu&s;et in the Limou&s;in $or the king of England; and many &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought with various &s;ucce&s;s: but all hope of the duke's d$claring again&s;t France in a little time vani&s;hed; for, although the French king deeply re&s;ented the indignity which had been offered to his con&s;table, Montfort was &s;ecretly favoured by the dukes of Berry and Bur|gundy, who envied the greatne&s;s and reputation of De Cl$&s;&s;on: and it was con&s;idered as a point of &s;uch importance to detach the duke of Brittany from his connexion with England, that Charles thought proper to overlook the outrage he had committed, and even allow him to exact an heavy ran&s;om of

the con&s;table. Several other conce&s;&s;ions were made, in order to facilitate and co$$irm a new accommodation; of which the earl of Arundel was no &s;ooner<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$.</NOTE> i$$ormed, t$an he r$$$rned with his fleet and forces to England.</P>

<P>The intere$ts of England did not pro&s;per &s;o well in other quarters. A qu$rrel breaki$g o$t between the duke of Guelders and the dutche&s;s of Br$b$nt, this la&s;t r$cei$ed a reinforcement of troops from her nephew the d$ke of Burgundy; and, in order to counterballance that &s;upply, her anta|gon$$t &s;o$$icited t$e a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England. Being gratified with an annual pen&s;ion of a tho$&s;$nd pounds, he declared war again&s;t France; but, Charles marching into his country, he was intimidated, and &s;ued for pardon, which he obtai$$d on condition of renouncing his alliance with England. The ac|commod$tion effected between the&s;e powers, left Richard without an ally on the con$$nent whom he could u&s;e for the annoyance of his enemies; while his Briti&s;h dominions were in&s;ulted by the Scots, who made continual irrup|tions into the northern counties. The younger Douglas and the earl of Fife had landed in Ireland, where they took the town of Carlingford, with fifteen &s;hips, defeated the Iri&s;h in battle, and plundered the I&s;le of Man in their re|turn. To revenge the&s;e depredations, the lords of the Marches entered Scot|land, and ravaged the Mer&s;e; but retired in a hurry upon receiving intelli|gence that the Scotti&s;h army was on its march to give them battle. A commi&s;&s;ion was given to the bi&s;hop of Durham, the earl of Northumberland, and other lords, to treat of a pacification with the Scots: but, their endea|vours proving ineffectual, the bi&s;hop of Sodor and Man was empowered to negotiate with Donald lord of the I&s;les, that he might fall upon the north of Scotland; but neither did this negotiation take effect. The Scotti&s;h parlia|ment, a&s;&s;embled at Aberdeen, re&s;olved to &s;end two armies into England; and this &s;cheme was immediately executed. One of the&s;e bodies, commanded by the earls of Douglas, Fife, and Dunbar, advanced beyond Newca&s;tle, and ravaged the whole bi&s;hopric of Durham: then they encamped before New|ca&s;tle, which was defended by the famous Hot&s;pur, his brother Sir Ralph, and almo&s;t all the gentlemen of the northern counties. The Scotti&s;h army con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred hor&s;e and two thou&s;and infantry; and therefore could not pretend to inve&s;t the whole town: &s;o that their intent was only to provoke Piercy to come forth and hazard a battle. While they continued in this &s;ituation, the volunteers on both &s;ides di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in &s;kir|mi&s;hes and trials of valour. At length, the Engli&s;h making a general &s;ally, an engagement en&s;ued, during which Piercy and Douglas encountered each other on hor&s;eback, in &s;ight of both armies: they were nearly of the &s;ame age, and rivals in reputation; &s;o that both &s;ides &s;u&s;pended their efforts to &s;ee the i&s;&s;$e of this combat. At the fir&s;t &s;hock Piercy was unhor&s;ed, and would have fallen into the hands of his antagoni&s;t, had not his men ru&s;hed in be|tween them, and conveyed him to the town; but Douglas had won his lance and pennon, which he waved over his head, calling aloud, that he would carry it as a trophy of his victory into Scotland. So &s;aying, he ordered his people to decamp, le$ving Piercy to all the horrors of mortified ambition. He &s;wore that Douglas &s;hould never carry his lance into Scotland; and, a&s;|&s;embling &s;ix hundred hor&s;e and eight thou&s;and infantry, &s;et out in pur&s;uit of t$e enemy, without waiting for the &s;uccours which were on the march from
<PB N="177" REF="1790">
all quarters, to &s;erve under his banner. The Scots, in their retreat, had un|dertaken the &s;iege of the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Otterburn, before which they lay en|camped when they were overtaken by Piercy, who in&s;tantly attacked them with great impetuo&s;ity, though the day was almo&s;t &s;pent before he could begin the battle. He found Douglas ready to receive him; and the fight was maintained with equal ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides, until the combatants were parted by the darkne&s;s: in a few hours, however, the Engli&s;h renewed the attack by moon-light; and Piercy fought with &s;uch fury to retrieve his ho|nour, that the Scots were put into di&s;order, and began to give ground. Douglas, being informed of this circum&s;tance, ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the Engli&s;h with his battle-axe in his hand, hewing down all before him, until his retreat was intercepted, and he was environed by his enemies, without any other &s;econd than his own chaplain, who had followed his &s;teps, and been animated by his example, to perform wonders of valour. His friends no &s;ooner learned his &s;ituation, than they penetrated to the place, where they $ound him fainting with lo&s;s of blood from three mortal wounds which he had re|ceived, and his chaplain defending him &s;ingly again&s;t a multitude of foes. Having obliged the Engli&s;h to give way in their turn, they would have con|veyed their general from the field; but that valiant chief, feeling his end ap|proaching, would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be moved: he de&s;ired they would conceal his fate, and revenge his death upon the enemy. He expired imme|diately after he had given the&s;e directions: then his friends, throwing a clo$k over his body, erected his &s;tandard; and, pronouncing his name as a word of encouragement, made &s;uch a de&s;perate effort, that the Engli&s;h gave way, and were totally routed, after Piercy, with his brother, and above an hundred gentlemen and officers of di&s;tinction, had been taken pi&s;oners, and twelve hundred left dead on the field of battle. The bi&s;hop of Durham, advancing at the head of ten thou&s;and men to join Piercy, no &s;ooner under&s;tood the fate of this engagement, than, in&s;tead of attacking the victors, who, being ex|hau&s;ted with fatigue, might have been ea&s;ily defeated, $e retired with preci|pitation to Newca&s;tle; and allowed the Scots to carry off their pri&s;oners and booty at their own lei&s;ure. The other body, which had entered England by Car$$le, plundered the we&s;t borders, burned villages, took a great number of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;$rt.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Britain, the duke of Lanca&s;ter, being<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$89.</NOTE> appointed the king's lieutenant in Guien$e, received powers and in&s;tructions to treat with France about an accommodation; and, a treaty being &s;et on foot, emba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent to Paris, in order to adju&s;t the preliminaries. At length, conferences were opened in the church of Lenlinghen, between Calais and Bou|logne, where a truce was conclud$d for thr$e yea$s between the two kingdo$s; and Robert king of Scotland acceded to this agreement. Peace being thus re&s;tored to England, Richard re&s;olved to en&s;ranchi&s;e him&s;elf from the thraldom in which he had been hitherto kept by the lords of the oppo&s;ition. In an ex|traordinary council of the nobility a&s;&s;embled after Ea&s;ter, he, to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of all pre&s;ent, de&s;ired to know his own age; and being told that he was turn$d of two and twenty, "Well then (&s;aid he) I am certainly of age to govern my kingdom; and I &s;$$ no r$a$on for my b$ing deprived of $ $ight
<PB N="178" REF="1800">
which the meane&s;t of my &s;ubjects enjoy." The lords an&s;wered in &s;ome con|fu&s;ion, that he had certainly an indi&s;putable right to take upon him&s;elf the ad|mini&s;tration of his kingdom. "Yes, he repl$$d$ I have been long under the management of tutors, whom I will now remove from my council, and endea|vour to manage my own affairs." Then he ordered Thomas Arundel the new ar$hbi&s;hop of York to give up the &s;eal, which he next day delivered to Wil|l$am of Wickham bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. The duke of Glouce&s;ter, the earl of Warw$ck$ and other lords of the oppo&s;ition, were removed from the council. T$e b$$hop of Hereford lo&s;t his office of trea&s;urer; the earl of Arundel was deprived of his po&s;t of high admiral; the keeper of the privy &s;eal, all the great officers of the &s;tate and the hou&s;hold, together with the judges, were changed, and every place filled with per&s;ons in whom the king thought he could intirely confide. The&s;e mea&s;ures were followed by a procl$mation, &s;ig|nifying to the &s;ubjects that the king had taken the government of the realm into his own hands; and that they might expect to &s;ee the peace of the nation better pre&s;erved, and ju&s;tice more equitably admini&s;tred than they had been be|fore this a$teration. At the &s;ame time he confirmed the pardons of the la&s;t parliament; and as a proof of his moderation and tenderne&s;s for his people, &s;u&s;pend$d the payment of the &s;ub&s;idy granted in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion at Cam|bridge. At this juncture the duke of Lanca&s;ter returned to England, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer.</NOTE> effected a reconciliation between the king and the duke of Glouce&s;ter. As a recompence for this &s;ervice, he was, in the parliament which met at We&s;t|min&s;ter in January, created duke of Aquitaine, and inve&s;ted with the en|&s;igns<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1390.</NOTE> of honour belonging to that dignity. Edward Plantagenet, &s;on to the duke of York, was al&s;o gratified with the earldom of Rutland, and a pen|&s;ion of eight hundred marks to &s;upport his new dignity. On the fourth day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter re&s;igned the great &s;eal to the king; the bi&s;hop of St. David's delivered up the keys of the exchequer, which he kept as trea&s;urer; and all the lords of the council were di&s;charged, at their own de&s;ire. Then they a&s;ked in open parliament, if any per&s;on had ought to &s;ay again&s;t their conduct; which the commons having examined, declared them&s;elves perfectly well &s;atisfied with all their tran&s;actions. The king, im|mediately after this declaration, re&s;tored them to their places, and the dukes of Lanca&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter were added to t$e council; though the king pro|te&s;ted, that for any thing then done, he would retain or remove the&s;e coun&s;el|lors according to his own plea&s;ure. As the oppre&s;&s;ive practices of the court of Rome were by this time grown almo&s;t intolerable, the commons petitioned, that the &s;tatutes enacted again&s;t th$&s;e encroachments upon the royal authority, and the liberties of the nation, in the reigns of Edward I. and his grand&s;on, &s;hould be punctually executed, and further regulations made for the redre&s;s o$ that grievance. The archbi&s;hops, alarmed at this petition, entered a pro|te&s;t, in beha$t of them&s;elves and their clergy; declaring, that they would not give their a&s;&s;ent to the revival of any old &s;tatute, or the pa&s;&s;ing any new law again&s;t the authority of the pope, or in prejudice of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical $$berties. Notwith&s;tanding t$is declaration, Richard &s;o far complied with the reque&s;t of the commons, as to order the former &s;tatute to be put in execution; and they, in con&s;ideration of this indulgence, granted a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy on wool and leather, for the de$ence of the kingdom$ as the duration of the truce was d$|bio$s
<PB N="179" REF="1810">
and uncertain. This &s;ub&s;idy was continued for three years by the next<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl.</NOTE> parliament, which met on the twelfth day of November. It was in this &s;e&s;|&s;ion that the grant of a thou&s;and pounds a year, made to the dukes of York and Glouce&s;ter was confirmed to them and their heirs; the parliament unani|mou&s;ly declared, that the royalty and prerogative of the king and his crown &s;hould be &s;aved and maintained; and whatever had been done or attempted again&s;t them redre&s;&s;ed $nd amended; &s;o as that the king &s;hould be as free as any of his progenitors. Such was the harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Ri|chard and this parliament, that before it broke up the lords and commons pre&s;ented their humble thanks to the king for his good government, and the great affection and zeal he had continually manife&s;ted for the happine&s;s o$ his people.</P>

<P>All oppo&s;ition to the king's mea&s;ures had been &s;u&s;pended &s;ince the la&s;t reconciliation between him and Glouce&s;ter, who had been always at the head of the malecontents; and the earl of Derby, who was the &s;oul of that party, had obtained leave to go abroad and &s;erve as a volunteer again&s;t the infidels in Pru&s;&s;ia, where he acquired great reputation for his military exploits. Richard's new mini&s;ters were men of more capacity and le&s;s exceptionable mo|rals, than were the idle favourites who had formerly influenced his conduct; and his own manner of living, though &s;till extravagant, was &s;uch as generally acquires the favour of the public. He in&s;tituted &s;olemn tilts and tournaments, and revived the &s;pirit of chivalry which prevailed in the reign of his grandfa|ther. Nothing was &s;een but pageantry and proce&s;&s;ion of knights in armour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1391.</NOTE> led in &s;ilver chains by their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to the li&s;ts, where they contended in feats of arms amid&s;t infinite crouds of people. The king him&s;elf and all his courtiers mingled in this mimickry of warfare; and the queen, accompanied by all her ladies, graced the field with her pre&s;ence. All was mu&s;ick and min|&s;trel&s;y, fea&s;ting and rejoicing, the land was ble&s;&s;ed with plenty a$ter two years of dearth, and the &s;ubjects enjoyed a rece&s;s from dreadful ravages and bur|then&s;ome taxes, to which they had been &s;o long expo&s;ed. During this &s;ea&s;on of good humour, another parliament was called at We&s;tmin&s;ter in the begin|ning of November, when the declaration, touching the king's full enjoyment of his royalty, was renewed with this addition, "Notwith&s;tanding any &s;tatute or ordinance formerly made in derogation thereof, particularly in the reign of king Edward II." And this was pa&s;&s;ed into an act of parliament. Over and above this in&s;tance of their loyalty and affection, they voted him a whole tenth and fifteenth to defray the expence of his voyage to France, whither he was in|vited by the French monarch, in order to compromi&s;e per&s;onally all their differences, and e&s;tabli&s;h a la&s;ting accommodation. Be&s;ides this aid, they granted others for the occa&s;ions of &s;tate, and thought they had a right to expect &s;ome extraordinary conde&s;cen&s;ion on the &s;ide of his maje&s;ty. In the&s;e &s;enti|ments, the knights of the &s;hires petitioned, that, as it was a common practice in corporations to admit as burge&s;&s;es into their communities, all villains or copyholders, after they had lived a year and a day among them unreclaimed, the lords of the manour might be impowered to enter &s;uch burroughs, and bring away the villains who were parcel of their property. This petition was rejected, as an attack upon the privileges of corporations; nor did he think proper to grant the other, in which the whole body of the commons concur|red, propo&s;ing an act for di&s;abling the villains of copyholders, of prelates and
<PB N="180" REF="1820">
mona&s;teries, to purcha&s;e lands in &s;ee; and from hindering all villains from &s;end|ing their &s;ons to &s;chool, wher$ by they obtained learning, and freed them&s;elves from their &s;ervility, to the prejudice of the right and honour of the freeholders in England. Nowith&s;tanding the&s;e repul&s;es, the parliament had great rea&s;on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. P$rl.</NOTE> to be plea&s;ed with Richard's conduct in this &s;e&s;&s;ion. The &s;chi&s;m in the church &s;till continued; and Boniface IX. being elect$d in the place of Urban, &s;ent a nuncio to the court of England, to u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours for a repeal of the &s;tatutes of provi&s;o, and others which had been $nacted again&s;t the encroach|ments of papal authority; as well as for preventi$g a peace between Richard and Charles of France, who &s;upported the antipope Benedict XIII. The nuncio executed his commi&s;&s;ion with great ability, and Richard &s;eemed to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to his &s;ugge&s;tions; but, as he would take no &s;tep that would deviate from the &s;cheme of popularity he had projected, he referred the pope's propo|&s;itions to the parliament, by which they were di&s;approved; while a peace with France was &s;trongly recommended. Richard acquie&s;ced in their &s;enti|ments, and declared his intention to confer with the king of France in per&s;on. The great corporations, convents, and other communities of the kingdom, vied with each other in a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to make an appearance &s;uitable to his dig|nity. He was furni&s;hed with rich equipages, and pre&s;ented with large &s;ums of money; and a great number of young noblemen and knights re&s;olved to ac|company him to this interview. In the mean time, commi&s;&s;ioners were ap|pointed to treat with France and Scotland, and all parties agreed that a gene|ral congre&s;s &s;hould be held at Amiens, where the treaty of peace might be con|cluded and ratified in pre&s;ence of the two monarchs.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$n. Ch. 1392.</NOTE> At the time appointed, Charles of France, with his brother and three uncles, repaired to Amiens; and Richard went as far as Dover in his way to the interview; but whether he altered his re&s;olution of his own accord, or was diverted from his purpo&s;e by the repre&s;entations of his council, his voyage was po&s;tponed, and he remained in Dover-Ca&s;tle with the duke of Glouce&s;ter, while his other two uncles, with the earls of Huntingdon and Derby, the bi&s;hops of London and Derby, Sir Thomas Piercy, and others of his council, proceeded to Amiens in quality of amba&s;&s;adors and plenipotentiaries. They entered that place with a train of twelve hundred hor&s;e, and during their &s;tay were maintained at the expence of the French king, who treated them in a &s;umptuous manner. The conferences were immediately opened; but &s;uch dif|ficulties occurred, as there was no probability of &s;urmounting. The French in|&s;i&s;ted upon the demolition of Calais; and the Engli&s;h demanded the re&s;titution of all the places they had lo&s;t in France, &s;ince the treaty of Bretigny, together with the payment of the la&s;t moiety of king John's ran&s;om. Charles was willing that $he crown of England &s;hould enjoy the nine bi&s;hopri$s, and all its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Guienne, independent of any &s;overeignty, and even offered to pay the ran&s;om within three years, on condition that Calais &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; but this was an artic$e concerning which the duke of Lanca&s;ter remained inflexible, declaring he had no powers to grant him &s;uch conce&s;&s;ion. The truce was therefore prolonged till Michaelmas of the en&s;uing year, and the terms of the peace as propo&s;ed by France referred to the con&s;ideration of the Engli&s;h council. Two French knights accompanied the amba&s;&s;adors, in their return to Dover, $o know the king's determination on this &s;ubject; and a council being called, $he plenipotentiaries communicated the particulars of their negotiation. A

debate en&s;uing, the duke of Glouce&s;ter ob&s;erved that they had no power to proceed with the treaty without the advice and con&s;ent of a parliament, as the affair of Calais was of the utmo&s;t importance to the kingdom: a definitive an|&s;wer therefore could not be given, until the matter &s;hould have been debated in the great a&s;&s;embly of the nation; but in the mean time the prolongation of the truce was ratified by his maje&s;ty in council.</P>

<P>The treaty at Amiens produced little advantage to any per&s;on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE> but the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who received the whole &s;ub&s;idy granted in the la&s;t parliament, or at lea&s;t the better part of it, to indemnify him for the expence of his voyage. With re&s;pect to the grant of Guienne, which he had obtained, he met with &s;ome difficulties that were not ea&s;ily &s;urmounted. The order which the king had &s;ent for his being put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that dutchy was di&s;puted by the people of Bourdeaux, Bayonne, and other principal cities, as well as the noble&s;&s;e of the country, who imagined this grant implied an alienation of the province, and an intire &s;eparation from the crown of England, contrary to the privilege of holding their lands immediately of the king or his elde&s;t &s;on, and of no other per&s;on. They likewi&s;e found a defection in the grant, which, though it conveyed to the duke of Lanca&s;ter the dutchy with all its rights, revenues, and appurtenances, requiring all per&s;ons to do homage and fealty to him, contained no clau&s;e which relea&s;ed them from the allegiance they had &s;worn to Richard. They moreover &s;u&s;pected that the grant was obtained in a &s;urreptitious manner, or by compul&s;ion; and, in order to di&s;pel their doubts, and remove their exceptions, the prelates, nobility, and cities of Guienne, &s;ent over deputies to learn the king's plea&s;ure from his own mouth. The&s;e arrived about Mid&s;umme$ at Nottingham, where Richard had a&s;&s;embled a great coun|cil to deliberate upon the treaty with France$ and having explained their em|ba&s;&s;y, the king a&s;&s;ured them that he had made the grant of his own free will, with the con&s;ent of parliament, for the duke's natural life only. He con|firmed all liberties and privileges of the clergy, nobility, cities, and commons of Guienne, in an in&s;trument &s;igned by him&s;elf, and authenticated by the great &s;eal of England.</P>

<P>During the &s;e&s;&s;ion of this council, a dangerous in&s;urrection happened<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> at London. Richard, who&s;e extravagance and profu&s;ion very often reduced him to great nece&s;&s;ities, had attempted to borrow a thou&s;and pounds of the ci|tizens of London, who not only refu&s;ed to grant his reque&s;t, but in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed a Lombard merchant who offered to accommodate his maje&s;ty. The king, incen&s;ed at this aggravated affront, revoked all exemptions which had been granted by his father and him&s;elf, to excu&s;e individuals from public offices in cities, counties, and corporations; and the mayor of London with the &s;heriffs were ordered to attend the council at Nottingham, where they and the whole city were convicted of a riot, and obliged to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the king's mercy in a bond of one hundred thou&s;and pounds. In the mean time they were deprived of their offices and committed to pri&s;on; and Sir Edward Dalyngrygge was appointed warden of the city: yet they were &s;oon relea&s;ed, and their antient form of government re&s;tored. The Londoners in general favoured the doctrine of Wickliff, and were of con&s;equence expo&s;ed to the ill offices of the bi&s;hops, whom they hated accordingly. A baker having been in&s;ulted in the &s;treet, by a dome&s;tic belonging to the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, the common people took the alarm; and, a&s;&s;embling in great numbers, would have &s;et fire
<PB N="182" REF="1840">
to the prelate's palace, had not they been with difficulty re&s;trained by the ma|g &s;tracy. The bi&s;hop complaining to the king of this outrage, Richard i&s;&s;ued out a writ for commi&s;&s;ioners of oyer and terminer, to &s;it at Eaton and try the de$$nquents; and the dukes of Glo$ce$ter and York pre&s;ided at the trial. The Lond$ners being found guilty, were fined in three thou&s;and marks, their liberties &s;eized into the king's hand, the &s;$eri$$s and aldermen changed, and Sir Baldwin Radynton appointed warden of the city. The citizens, humbled by the lo&s;s of their franchi&s;es, and dreading the bond which hung over their heads, implored the queen's interce&s;&s;ion with great humility, and were par|doned at her reque&s;t. The king made a public entry into the city, where he was received amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, and received very valuable<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1393.</NOTE> pre&s;ents: the fine was remitted, the bond cancelled, their liberties were re|&s;tored, and their charters confirmed.</P>

The commons granted a conditional &s;ub&s;idy, in ca&s;e of a war with France or Scotland, or of the king's heading an expedition in per&s;on; for, as they knew his want of oeconomy, they did not think proper to grant him any &s;uperfluous &s;upply. Several laws had been enacted, in the four pre|ceding parliaments, again&s;t the encroachments of the papal power in England. The pope's agent had been obliged to &s;wear he would be true to the king and his crown, and keep his laws and rights inviolate; that he would take no &s;tep that &s;hould be prejudicial to the royal authority, or the laws of the kingdom, nor execute any papal bulls or mandates to the detriment of the king, or con|trary to the laws of the realm; that he would not receive or publi&s;h any of the pope's letters, without having fir&s;t communicated them to the council; no$ $$nd any money or plate out of the kingdom, without a &s;pecial licence from the king or his council. Every per&s;on was &s;ubjected to a premunire, who &s;hould go or &s;end out of England to provide or purcha&s;e for him&s;elf any eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefice: &s;tatutes again&s;t provi&s;ors were revived, and a &s;top was put to the collection of a tenth impo&s;ed by the pope upon the clergy of England. The archbi&s;hops and prelates had i&s;&s;ued mandates for levying this tax, but were ordered to revoke them, and return the money which had been rai&s;ed; and the agent was prohibited on pain of life and limb from proceeding farther in the collection. His holine&s;s, alarmed at the&s;e mea&s;ures, $ent over a nuncio (as we have already ob&s;erved) to &s;ollicit the repeal or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the &s;tatute again&s;t provi&s;ors; but all he could obtain was a permi&s;&s;ion of collating to the benefices that &s;hould fall vacant in the court of his holine&s;s. This permi&s;|&s;ion he had egregiou&s;ly abu&s;ed, in i&s;&s;uing bulls for tran&s;lating bi&s;hops to poorer $ees, with their own con&s;ent; and then filling up the rich vacancies in favour of tho&s;e who payed exorbitant &s;ums for the nomination. In this parliament the commons made a &s;trong remon&s;trance, complaining, that the pope tran&s;|lated Engli&s;h prelates to foreign &s;ees, and from one bi&s;hopric to another, with|out the knowledge and con&s;ent of the king, and even of the bi&s;hops &s;o tran&s;|lated; a practice by which the &s;tatutes of the kingdom would be defeated, the lieges of his maje&s;ty's council removed o$t of the realm again&s;t their own in|clinations,

and the trea&s;ure of the nation exported; &s;o that it would in a little time become de&s;titute of wealth and council, to its utter impoveri&s;hment and de&s;truction. The crown of England, which had been always free and inde|pendent of every earthly &s;overeign, would be made &s;ubject to the pope, and the &s;tatutes of the realm rendered of no effect; to the di&s;grace of the king, his crown and royalty, and the ruin of the whole kingdom. They declared they would &s;tand by him with their lives and fortunes again&s;t all proce&s;&s;es in the court of Rome, about rights of patronage, bulls, and mandates, and all at|tempts again&s;t his crown and royalty. All the lords &s;piritual and temporal made the &s;ame declaration, though the prelates entered a prote&s;t that they did not intend to deny the pope's canonical authority; and the famous Statute of Premunire was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t all that purcha&s;ed or &s;ollicited, in the court of Rome, or el&s;ewhere, any tran&s;lations of bi&s;hops, proce&s;&s;es and &s;entences of excommunication, bulls, in&s;truments, or any thing el&s;e to the prejudice of the king, his crown, regality, or kingdom.

The conferences were held at Lenlinghen, between Calais and Boulogne, and continued nine days, during which the truce was prolonged till Michaelmas of the en&s;uing year; but the former difficulties touching a final peace recurred, and they were obliged to &s;u&s;pend their negotiation until they &s;hould have received fur|ther in&s;tructions. Both courts were tired of the war, and &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to|wards an accommodation; therefore the treaty was renewed, and &s;ome pro|gre&s;s made towards a pacification. The French con&s;ented to re&s;tore Bigorre, the Agenois, and Perigort; but would not cede Rouvergne, Quercy, the Li|mou&s;in, Ponthieu, or any part of Gui&s;nes but what was actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h. Richard's plenipotentiaries would not &s;uffer Calais to be men|tioned; but with re&s;pect to Cherbourg and Bre&s;t, a propo&s;al was made, that the king of France &s;hould pay a certain &s;um of money to Richard for the re&s;|titution of the&s;e places to the king of Navarre and the duke of Brittany. All the articles were well nigh adju&s;ted, when Charles, who re&s;ided at Abbeville, being &s;eized with a return of his frenzy, the conferences were &s;uddenly &s;u&s;|pended: but they were renewed in September, by which time he had retrieved the u&s;e of his reflection; and, the affair of Cherbourg being &s;ettled, orders<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> were given for &s;urrendering it immediately to the king of Navarre.</P>

<P>The other articles being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, a plan of the treaty was laid<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1394.</NOTE> before the parliament, which met at We&s;tmin&s;ter in January, when the pro|ceedings of the plenipotentiaries were approved by both hou&s;es: but they una|nimou&s;ly joined in de&s;iring that the king would not pay liege homage; that there &s;hould be a &s;aving of the liberty of his per&s;on, and the crown of Eng|land; that he and his heirs might re&s;ume their claim to the crown of France, if the peace &s;hould be infringed by Charles; and that mea&s;ures &s;hould be ta|ken to prevent any future confi&s;cation of Guienne. This reque&s;t and advice was delivered in writing by the hands of Sir John Bu&s;&s;y the &s;peaker, who de|clared,

in the name of the commons, that they would decline giving their ad|vice touching the treaty of peace, unle&s;s the&s;e preliminaries &s;hould be &s;ettled. $$$s declaration produced a debate $mong the lords; and &s;ome bitter alterca|t$on pa&s;&s;ed between the d$ke of Lanca&s;ter and the earl of Arundel, who, as rivals in power and influence, had long $ate$ each other in &s;ecret. During the duke's ab$ence in Picardy, the people of Che&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire, who lived under the government of the king's two uncles, rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection again&s;t their officers; and being headed by Sir Thomas Talbot, threatened to de&s;troy all the $&s;tat$s belonging to the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who returning &s;uddenly to England, to q$ell this di&s;turbance, under&s;tood that the $arl of Arundel had remained in the neighbourhood at his ca&s;tle of Holt, without taking any &s;tep to di&s;p$r&s;e the in&s;urgents. Incen&s;ed at his indifference, he accu&s;ed the earl of having conn$ved at the violences they committed; but he ju&s;tified him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as convinced even the duke of his innocence. He re&s;olved however to be revenged upon his accu&s;er for this in&s;ult offered to his honour, and impeached the duke, in his turn, for being too familiar with the king, whom he had obliged to wear his colour and livery; for intimidating the mem|bers of the council, &s;o as that they could not &s;peak their &s;entiments freely; for having obtained an illegal grant of Guienne, and an exorbitant &s;um of money for his expedition into Spain; and for mi&s;conduct in the management of the late treaty. The king, who dete&s;ted Arundel, made him&s;elf a party in this quarrel: he told the hou&s;e the whole was fal&s;e and frivolous; that he admitted the duke to no familiarity, but what was con&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;anguinity and affection &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them; that he wore his uncle's colour as a mark of that affection; that the grant of Guienne was made with the con&s;ent of par|liament, which had likewi&s;e gratified him with part of the money expended in the Spani&s;h expedition; that the after-payment was le&s;s than he de&s;erved, con|&s;idering the relief of Bre&s;t and other &s;ervices; and that his conduct in ma|naging the treaty was warranted by the in&s;tructions he had received from the $ing and council. After this declaration of the &s;overeign, the parliament could not decently avoid pa&s;&s;ing a vote, acquitting the duke of the imputations laid to his charge; and the earl of Ar$ndel was obliged to a&s;k his pardon in<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> $$ll parliament. Then the dukes of Lanca&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter, as count pa|latine of Lanca&s;ter and lord chief ju&s;tice of Che&s;ter, petitioned the king and lords $or judgment again&s;t Sir Thomas Talbot and others, for having engaged in a $word$ to take away their lives, and rai&s;ed forces for that purpo&s;e. The king, with the concurrence of the lords, declared the offence to be high trea&s;on, and ordered Talbot to be apprehended and brought to trial. If not found by the &s;her$$f, it was re&s;olved that he &s;hould be $$mmoned to appear at next Ea&s;ter term, in the court of king's bench, on pain of being deemed convicted of trea&s;on, with the $or$e$$ure of his lands and chattels; and that all who h$rbo$r$d him &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the &s;ame penalty. The&s;e mea&s;ures being taken, the king declared his intention of going to Ireland in per&s;on; and, demanding a &s;$b&s;idy for that purpo&s;e, was accommodated, according to his de|&s;ire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$. Pa$l.</NOTE> with an a$d on wool, wine, and other merchandize. Immediately after the parliament r$&s;$, the dukes of Lanca&s;ter and $word$ r$$urn$d to $rance, in order to p$t the fini$hing ha$d to the treaty of peace.

<P>While John duke of Lanca&s;ter was employed in this negotiation, his own wife Con&s;tance of Ca&s;tile died in England; and her death was fol|lowed by that of his daughter-in-law the counte&s;s of Derby. The&s;e ladies were not long &s;urvived by the queen, who was regretted by the whole nation, as a good-natured, &s;en&s;ible, compa&s;&s;ionate prince&s;s: from the meekne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he had acquired the epithet of The Good Queen Anne; and her death made &s;uch a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of Richard, that he was for &s;ome time di&s;con&s;olate, and never could bear the &s;ight of the palace at Sheen, where &s;he expired. This melancholy event confirmed him in his re&s;olution<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE> of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea to Ireland, where the Engli&s;h intere&s;t was by this time in a very declining &s;ituation. The Engli&s;h noblemen, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed large e&s;tates in that country, cho&s;e to fix their re&s;idence in England, &s;o that Ireland was left almo&s;t altogether defencele&s;s, and expo&s;ed to the efforts of the old Iri&s;h &s;epts, who did not neglect this opportunity to recover their antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The&s;e they retook by force of arms, and plundered all the re&s;t of the country which belonged to the E$gli&s;h; in&s;omuch that, whereas Edward III. had drawn a con&s;iderable revenue from that kingdom, Richard, far from reaping any &s;uch advantage from it, was obliged to expend thirty thou&s;and marks yearly, for the pre&s;ervation of what little &s;till remained under his dominion. In Augu&s;t, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, commanding all the ab&s;ent proprietors to repair to Ireland by the eighth day of September, and wait the king's ar|rival. The military tenants of the crown were &s;ummoned; the Cinque-Ports required to furni&s;h their armament of fifty-&s;even &s;hips, well manned: and, as the duke of Lanca&s;ter had re&s;olved to &s;et out for Guienne, his brother the duke of York was appointed guardian of England during the king's ab&s;ence. The forces being a&s;&s;embled, and the navy equipped, Richard &s;et out for Wales, accompanied by the duke of Glouce&s;ter, the earls of Marche, Not|tingham, and Rutland; and, embarking about Michaelmas at Milford-Haven, landed in Ireland, with an army of thirty thou&s;and men. The native Iri&s;h, intimidated by &s;uch a powerful armament, either retired to their fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, or made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and Richard treated them with great clemency. He not only pardoned tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted, but even allotted pen&s;ions to their chiefs; and endeavoured to reclaim them from their native barbarity. The earl of Nottingham was empowered to receive, in the king's name, the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and homage of all the Iri&s;h in Lein&s;ter; and they gave bonds for their peaceable behaviour. O Neal, who pretended to be lord paramount over the other princes of Ireland, made a voluntary tender of allegiance to Richard, and did homage to him at Drogheda; though he &s;till re&s;erved to him&s;elf a kind of &s;overeign power, which the king did not think it worth his while to di&s;pute. His example was followed by O Hanlon, O Donnel, Mac Mahon, and other toparchs, who engaged for them&s;elves and their whole clans, that they &s;hould not di&s;turb the peace of the kingdom. Richard in|vited all the chiefs to an entertainment at Dublin, during the Chri&s;tmas fe&s;|tival; and not only entertained them with royal munificence, but al&s;o con|ferred upon them the order of knighthood; and encouraged them to adapt the Engli&s;h cu&s;toms, habit, and way of living. He afterwards &s;ummoned a par|liament in the &s;ame city, with a view to redre&s;s their grievances; with re&s;pect to which they obtained full &s;atisfaction in the puni&s;hment and removal of
<PB N="186" REF="1880">
tho&s;e officers by whom they had been injured and oppre&s;&s;ed: in a word, he behaved with &s;uch lenity and prudence as acquired the affection and e$teem of the native Iri&s;h, the greater part of whom quietly &s;ubmitted to his dominion.</P>
<P N="65"><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$95.</NOTE> &s;ect; LXV. While he was thus laudably employed in Ireland, the guardian convoked a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in the month of January; and the duke of Glouce&s;ter was &s;ent over to manage the intere&s;t of the crown in this a&s;&s;embly, which being made acquainted with the king's proceedings in Ire|land, approved of his conduct, and granted a &s;ub&s;idy to enable him to fini&s;h the reduction of that country. A nuncio from the pope attended at this &s;e&s;|&s;ion to &s;ollicit a repeal of the &s;tatute again&s;t provi&s;ors; but all his &s;ollicitations proved ineffectual. A remon&s;trance was al&s;o pre&s;ented by the Wickliffites, who had by this time acquired the appellation of Lollards, and were become &s;o numerous and confident, as to preach, write, and declaim openly again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. Under the protection of &s;ome powerful noblemen, they publicly impeached the morals and doctrines of the clergy; they fixed l$bels on the doors of churches; and a writing, containing the articles of their charge, was now brought into parliament, by Sir Thomas Latimer, Sir Richard Story, and other members, who had adopted their per&s;ua&s;ion. The archbi&s;hop of York and the bi&s;hop of London, alarmed at this bold attack, made a voyage to Dublin, where they repre&s;ented tho&s;e Lollards as enemies both to church and &s;tate; they practi&s;ed &s;o effectually on the weak mind and jealous di&s;po&s;ition of Richard, that he abandoned the fair pro&s;pect of reducing Ireland, and returned to England, with a view to cru&s;h tho&s;e dangerous in|novators. When he arrived, they were threatened with death if they &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in their errors; and the chancellor of Oxford was ordered to expel all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>This affair being &s;ettled, the attention of the king and council was employed upon an object of as great importance to the peace of the na|tion. The queen having died without i&s;&s;ue, tho&s;e who &s;incerely wi&s;hed well to their country began to be unea&s;y about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: for though Richard, before his departure on the Iri&s;h expedition, is &s;aid to have declared Edmund Mortimer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was the only &s;on of Roger Mortimer, $word$ of Mortimer earl of Marche, who married Philippa, &s;ole daughter of Lionel duke of Cla|rence, third &s;on of Edward III.</NOTE>, &s;on of Roger earl of Marche, pre&s;umptive heir of the crown; had the king died without legitimate offspring, the kingdom would, in all probability, have been embroiled by the ambition of the dukes of Lanca&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter. In order to prevent &s;uch civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions, Richard was ad|vi&s;ed to engage in a &s;econd marriage; and the council ca&s;ting their eyes upon I&s;abel, elde&s;t daughter of the French king, as a &s;uitable con&s;ort for the Eng|li&s;h monarch, the archbi&s;hop of Dublin, the bi&s;hop of St. David's, the earls of Rutland and Nottingham, the lord Beaumont, and William Le Scroop, chamberlain of the hou&s;hold, were &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the court of France, to demand that prince&s;s in marriage for Richard: they were in&s;tructed to in&s;i&s;t upon a con&s;iderable portion, and empowered to offer ten thou&s;and marks a year for her jointure; and after this match &s;hould have been tran&s;acted, the other part of their commi&s;&s;ion was to effect a marriage between I&s;abel's younger

<DIV4 N="67" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The next affair that fell under the con&s;ideration of the council, was a di&s;pute between the duke of Lanca&s;ter and the natives of Guienne, from whom he had not met with that reception which was due to a &s;overeign. The prelates, nobility, and cities had engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation to treat him with deference and civility, as the brother of the Black Prince, and the uncle of king Richard; but without doing homage to him as their &s;overeign. He ex|erted all his artifice to prevail upon them to acknowledge his authority, in obedience to the patent of king Richard, and the &s;anction of the Engli&s;h par|liament. He endeavoured to cajole them with promi&s;es of a mild admini&s;tra|tion, and other particular advantages; he overwhelmed the individuals with civility, and even tempted them with valuable pre&s;ents. But they were proof again&s;t all his efforts; and, as he had not &s;trength &s;ufficient to compel them to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the di&s;pute was referred to the deci&s;ion of the king and council. The cities of Bourdeaux and Bayonne &s;ent over deputies to &s;ollicit a repeal of the grant; and the duke employed John de Greilly, natural &s;on of the famous Captal de Buche, as his agent at the court of England. Both parties were heard in a great council of the prelates and nobility, convoked at Sheen for that purpo&s;e. The official of Bourdeaux explained the privileges of the Ga&s;cons, with which this grant was incompatible; and repre&s;ented, with &s;uch energy, the mi&s;chiefs that would accrue from it to the crown of England, that the hearers were convinced of the truth of what he alledged, and gene|rally di&s;po&s;ed to comply with the de&s;ire of his con&s;tituents. But the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who looked upon the pre&s;ence of his brother as a check upon his own ambition, was very de&s;irous of his being detained at a di&s;tance from England; and therefore oppo&s;ed the remon&s;trance of the official with all his influence. He was &s;econded by his nephew the earl of Derby, who naturally e&s;pou&s;ed his father's cau&s;e; but, perceiving the other members were of a dif|ferent opinion, he withdrew abruptly, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they would not take any re&s;olution in his ab&s;ence. In this hope, however, he was di&s;ap|pointed; for, after he had retired, they &s;poke their &s;entiments with more free|dom, and the king concurring with them in their deliberations, it was unani|mou&s;ly re&s;olved, that the duke of Lanca&s;ter &s;hould be recalled. Richard accordingly &s;ent for him to England, where he arrived in the beginning of the next year, and re&s;igned his grant of Guienne into the hands of his maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>Mean while the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, arriving at Paris, ex|plained the nature of their emba&s;&s;y; and Richard's propo&s;al was debated in the French council. Some of the members &s;ugge&s;ted, that there was &s;omething incon&s;i&s;tent and unnatural in the propo&s;ition of &s;uch a marriage, before peace was concluded between the two nations; but the duke of Burgundy was well affected to the &s;cheme, which he ob&s;erved was the mo&s;t likely expedie$$ to effect and con&s;olidate an accommodation. Through his influence, the am|ba&s;&s;adors met with a favourable reception from the mini&s;try; and though the alliance was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the dukes of Berry and Orleans, the king him&s;elf favoured the propo&s;al, which was accepted accordingly. A treaty was immediately &s;et on foot, and the articles being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the plenipo|tentiaries,
<PB N="188" REF="1900">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. $word$ 1$96.</NOTE> both kings at la&s;t agreed, that Richard &s;hould marry the prince&s;s I&s;abel, and receive with her a portion of eight hundred thou&s;and franks in gold, at yearly payments: That he &s;hould make an ab&s;olute renunciation of all his claim to the crown of France, either from his own hereditary preten|&s;ions, or by virtue of this marriage: That the truce &s;hould be prolonged for five and twenty years; and that the king of France &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his whole power again&s;t his rebellious &s;ubjects. The&s;e points being ratified, the young prince&s;s, though &s;till a child, was intitled queen of England, and a$$$anced by the $arl of No$$ingham as Richard's proxy. Richard re&s;olved to make a voyage to France, and wed the prince&s;s in per&s;on; and, for that purpo&s;e, the greate&s;t part of the &s;ummer was employed in making prepara|tions for the ceremony. His marriage was not the only pretence he u&s;ed for cro&s;&s;ing the channel. He expre$$ed a de&s;ire of examining, repairing, and im|provi$g the $orti$$cations of Calais: but the real motive of his voyage was to concert mea&s;ures with the French court, for &s;urmounting all oppo&s;ition in England; and particularly for humbling the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who&s;e pride and ambition were equally di$$greeable and dangerous to Richard, and who had, from the beginning of this negotiation, violently oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ure. Such was his popularity in the nation, and influence in the council, that the king would not v$nture to conclude the treaty without his concurrence; and &s;ignified to the French court, that he was inacce&s;&s;ible on every &s;ide, except that of av$$ice. When he attended Richard to France, the mini&s;try of that kingdom care$$ed him with extraordinary civilities, and even tempted him with &s;ome valuable pre&s;ents: but he &s;aw through all this complai$ance, for which he de&s;pi&s;ed them in his heart; and treated their advances with &s;uch contempt, that the duke of Burgundy declared the match &s;hould not have been concluded, but for the deference he payed to the per&s;onal character of the Engli&s;h monarch. Glouce&s;ter's aver&s;ion to this alliance proceeded partly from his own di&s;appointed ambition, and partly from a regard to the intere&s;t of his country. He had propo&s;ed a marri$ge between Richard and his own daughter, which the king waved on pretence of con&s;anguinity. He found that the rendition of Bre&s;t was one article of the treaty; and he dreaded the $ate of Calais: yet the&s;e con&s;iderations gave way to what he conceived to be his own immediate intere&s;t. Richard, who was well acquainted with his di&s;|po&s;$$ion, promi&s;ed to gratify him with a p$e&s;ent of fifty thou&s;and nobles on their return to England, and to be&s;tow upon his &s;on the earldom of Ro|che&s;ter, with an e&s;tate of two thou&s;and pounds a year to maintain that dignity. Glouce&s;ter was caught by this magnificent bait. All his patrioti&s;m and re|$entment &s;ub$ided; and he became perfectly reconciled to the treaty which he had &s;o bi$$$rly oppo&s;ed. The two kings met under a magnificent pavilion between A$dres and Calais, each attended by $our hundred followers in the nat$re of guards; and every thing was tran&s;acted to their mutual &s;atisfac|tio$$ The ceremony of the marr$age was per$ormed at Calais by the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterb$ry: then Richard returned immed$at$$y to England with his bride, who had ju&s;t at$ai$$d the eighth year of h$r age; and, on the &s;eventh day of January, her coronation was &s;olemnized at We&s;tmin&s;ter with<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> uncommon magnificence.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; LXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The $own and ca&s;tle of Bre&s;t had been conditionally put into the hands of the Engli&s;h, by the duke of Brittany, to be re-delivered whenever a long truce or treaty with France &s;hould be concluded: and now he claimed the requi&s;ition of Richard, who gave orders for its being &s;urrendered accord|ingly. This &s;tep, which he could not have avoided with any regard to good faith and equity, was extremely unpopular in England; and Glouce&s;ter, by this time, finding him&s;elf the dupe of Richard, who had amu&s;ed him with promi&s;es he never intended to perform, made it an handle for the gratification of his re&s;entment, if not to pave the way $or his own ambitious de&s;igns. He $omented the di&s;contents of the people, who were already di&s;gu$ed at the profu&s;ion of Richard, and the profligacy of his court; and exclaim$d again&s;t the French alliance, and the rendition of Bre&s;t, as preludes to the lo&s;s of all that England po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the continent. His re&s;entment was the more dangerous to Richard, as he had now no rival in the council; $or his brother the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who, &s;ince his la&s;t arrival in England, counterballanced his influence, had lately lo&s;t all his credit with the council, and the nation in general, by marrying Catherine Swinford, an ob&s;cure foreigner, educated in the court of queen Philippa$ who had been retained as governe&s;s to the duke's daughters by his fir&s;t con$ort, and bore to him $our ill$gitimate children: the&s;e were John, Henry, Thomas, and Jane, married fir&s;t to Robert lo$d Ferrers, and afterwards to Ralph Nevil earl of We&s;tmoreland. The duke's intention in this di&s;honourable match was, in all probability, to render the&s;e children legitim$te, for which purpo&s;e he obtained a bull from the pope, upon his marriage with their mother. This alliance gave great offence to all the princes of the blood and their wives, who could not bear the thought of yielding in precedency to a woman o$ low birth, who h$d b$en openly maintained as a concubine; and the duke $$m&s;el$ was expo&s;$d to innu|merable in&s;ults and affronts, which he bore patiently until his relations had exhau&s;ted the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their indignation: but he gradually recovered all his former importance.</P>

<P>During this temporary eclip&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, his brother Glouce&s;ter triumphed in his popularity, and exerted all his endeavours in preparing for a vigorous oppo&s;ition in the en&s;uing parliament. He engaged in his party the earls of Arundel and Warwick, with the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was brother to the earl of Arundel; and the&s;e a&s;&s;ociates de$iberated on very dangerous and illegal methods for the reformation of the government. The earls of Derby and Nottingham were in &s;ome mea&s;ure concerned in the oppo|&s;ition; but not &s;o deeply engaged as the other $our, who had actually re&s;olved to redre&s;s the grievances of the nation by force of arms, and, according to &s;ome hi&s;torians, to have kept the king in perpetual impri&s;onment. They had certainly acquired a very dangerous influence among the people, and &s;educed a great number of pa$ti&s;ans, by the indefatigable pains they took to inve$gh again&s;t the extravagance of the co$rt, the levity of Richard's own character, the danger of lo$in$ Calais, and the taxes by which the nation was in a fair way of being utterly impoveri&s;hed. Such $n&s;inuations had great effect upon the people in general, and upon the citizens of London in particular, who, with the magi&s;trates of &s;ome other towns, waited upon the king at Sheen$ and demanded an immediate abatement o$ the duties upon merchandize.

The duke of Glouce&s;ter, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at that a&s;&s;embly on purpo&s;e to countenance the petitioners, in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's complying with their de|mands; but the re&s;t of the members being of a different opinion, the duke of L$nca&s;ter, in the king's name, told them, that tho&s;e duties had been laid with the con&s;ent of their repre&s;entatives, and the deputies o$ all the good towns in the nation, for their common defence; that the king had indulged them with grants which would be recalled, &s;hould they behave them&s;elves in a &s;editious manner; that the revenue of the crown was not &s;o con&s;iderable as it had been in former times, and the expence much greater, ari&s;ing from the war in Ireland, the late treaty and marriage, the queen's coronation, the de|fence of the ports and frontiers of the realm, the &s;upport of the garri&s;ons in Cal$is and Guienne; and that after all the&s;e payments, the taxes in England were not &s;o heavy as tho&s;e of any other kingdom in Europe. The petitioners went away &s;eemingly &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, to which indeed they could have $ound but little objection: but they were afterwards incen&s;ed by the conduct of Richard, who, finding the &s;ub&s;idies in&s;ufficient to &s;upport his extravagance, extorted loans from the trading towns and rich abbeys of the kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer$ Wal$ingham.</NOTE> without the lea&s;t intention to refund the lenders.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 139$.</NOTE> All the efforts of Glouce&s;ter and his confederates had not been able to prevent the court from &s;ecuring a parliament that favoured the treaty, and the other mea&s;ures which had been lately taken; and for that rea&s;on the duke and earl of Arundel would not a&s;&s;i&s;t in their deliberations: not but that there was a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition among the commons; for the &s;e&s;&s;ion being opened on the twenty-&s;econd day of January, and a &s;ub&s;idy granted for the de|fence of the Scotti&s;h Marches, and the pro&s;ecution of the war in Ireland, a bill was brought into the hou&s;e by one Haxey a clergyman, complaining of the exce&s;&s;ive number of prelates, ladies, and idle dependents, maintained at court, and petitioning that the charges of the hou&s;hold might be retrenched. The king, con&s;cious of his own &s;trength, re&s;ented this as an in&s;ult upon his dignity, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, importing that the bill contained certain articles intrenching upon his honour and prerogative, which he was re&s;olved to maintain again&s;t all encroachment; he therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon their delivering the bill to the lords, together with the name of the member who had pre&s;umed to bring it into the hou&s;e. The commons, intimidated by this lofty me&s;&s;age, humbled them&s;elves before his maje&s;ty in the mo&s;t abject manner. They pro|te&s;ted they had no intention to encroach upon his royal e&s;tate and liberty, e&s;|pecially with regard to his per&s;on, and the oeconomy of his hou&s;hold; that they had no other de&s;ign, but that of prevailing upon the lords to advi&s;e him to con&s;ult the honour of his &s;tate in all his tran&s;actions, according to his own good plea&s;ure; they therefore &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to his will and favour, and begged $e would graciou&s;ly excu&s;e the freedom they had taken, pro$e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves always ready to &s;upport his royal e&s;tate and dignity, and to perform in body and goods like loyal &s;ubjects, whatever &s;hould be for his honour and &s;afety. Notwith&s;tanding this piteous addre&s;s, Richard in&s;i&s;ted upon Haxey's being brought to trial before the lords, who condemned him to &s;uffer death as a traitor. The &s;entence was no &s;ooner known, than the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury,

at the head of the prelates, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the king, and de|claring that it ever was and &s;hould be their full re&s;olution to maintain his royal e&s;tate and dignity without diminution, be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to &s;pare the life of Haxey, and order him to be delivered into their cu&s;tody, out of his &s;pecial grace and favour. The king complied with this their humble reque&s;t, and or|dered the criminal to be delivered to the archbi&s;hop. The &s;ub&s;idy upon wool being continued, the king confirmed the dignity of earl mare&s;chal to Thomas de Mowbray, and the heirs male of his body. John de Beaufort, natural &s;on of Lanca&s;ter by Catherine Swinford, was created earl of Somer&s;et; and Sir Robert Belknap, Sir John Holt, and Sir William Burgh, three of the judges who had been bani&s;hed to Ireland for the opinions at Nottingham, were, by the a&s;&s;ent of the lords and commons, allowed to return from exile. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>After the parliament broke up, the duke of Glouce&s;ter and his a&s;&s;ociates pro&s;ecuted their intrigues with great &s;ucce&s;s, in alienating the affec|tions of the people from Richard: nor did they make any &s;ecret of their di&s;|content; they and their parti&s;ans publicly declared that Richard was not fit to govern; that the &s;pirit of the nation was quite broken, by his mi&s;management and pu&s;illanimity; and that he ought to be immured for life, and pa&s;s his days in that indolence which had di&s;graced his admini&s;tration. The&s;e proceedings were reported to the king with &s;uch exaggerations as alarmed that weak prince, who believed or &s;eemed to believe that his life was not &s;ecure from their machi|nations. His uterine brother John Holland earl of Huntingdon, who had been governor of Bre&s;t, employed emi&s;&s;aries to watch the conduct of the a&s;&s;ociates. He was a man of profligate morals, and a profe&s;&s;ed enemy of Glouce&s;ter, who&s;e ruin he &s;ought with the mo&s;t eager indu&s;try; he therefore repre&s;ented every thing again&s;t that nobleman in the mo&s;t unfavourable light, to arou&s;e his appre|hen&s;ion and inflame his re&s;entment. The&s;e circum&s;tances of intelligence Ri|chard communicated to the dukes of Lanca&s;ter and York, who endeavoured to remove the jealou&s;ies &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the king and their brother, by employ|ing friendly remon&s;trances with both. Glouce&s;ter &s;till profe&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t ve|neration for the king's per&s;on, but in&s;i&s;ted upon a change of mea&s;ures. Ri|chard attempted to engage his other two uncles, in a violent pro&s;ecution again&s;t Glouce&s;ter: but they refu&s;ed to be concerned in any &s;cheme again&s;t the life of their own brother; and retired to their hou&s;es in the country, in order to avoid cen&s;ure and $u$picion. Their example was followed by Sir Thomas Piercy brother to the earl of Northumberland, who re&s;igned his office of &s;teward of the hou&s;hold, and withdrew from a court which was altogether abandoned to riot and indi&s;cretion. Richard was now left entirely to the management of raw$ un&s;teady, hot-headed coun&s;ellors, who per&s;uaded him that there was no other way to prevent his own ruin, but that of effecting the &s;peedy de&s;truction of Glouce&s;ter; and this advice was &s;econded by the count of St. Pol, a French nobleman, who came over to vi&s;it the young queen of England. The duke was too powerful to be apprehended openly, and puni&s;hed according to the forms of ju&s;tice. All the people in the neighbourhood of Ple&s;hy, where he l$ved, would have taken arms to defend him from violence; and Richard ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed that his two brothers would not tamely behold him &s;acrificed to &s;u&s;|picion or convenience: he therefore re&s;olved to u&s;e a more effectual expedient, and take him off by private treachery. As he had always maintained the ap|pearance
<PB N="192" REF="1940">
of affection and familiarity with his uncle Glouce&s;ter, he made a pre|t$nce o$ hunting in E$$ex; $span$ the ev$ning vi&s;ited the duke at Ple&s;hy, where he was received with the $word$ cordial ho&s;pitality, both by his uncle and the d$tche&s;s. While they $$t at $upper, he told the duke that he wanted to con&s;ult him on &s;ome very important affair relating to the &s;tate, and de&s;ired he would accompany him to Lo$don, where a council &s;hould be called in the morning. The un&s;u&s;pecting duke chearfully complied with his de&s;ire, and &s;et out with the king on hor&s;eback, attended by four or five dome&s;tics. As th$y approached Epping Fore&s;t Richard rode off at full gallop; and Glouce&s;ter was immediately &s;urrounded by armed men, who conveyed him to the river, and put him on board of a &s;hip which weighed anchor immediately, and arrived next day at Ca$ais. The duke's a&s;&s;ociates the earls of Arundel, Warwick, lord Cobham, Sir John Cheney, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction who had al&s;o been invited to the council, were next day arre&s;ted at London. Le&s;t the$e proceedings &s;hould create &s;ome di&s;turbance among the people, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, declaring that the lords were arre&s;ted upon fre&s;h matter of trea&s;on laid to their charge: and that they &s;hould be tried by a great co$ncil of their peers, which was &s;ummoned to meet on the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t at Nottingham. There they accordingly met at the time appointed; when an appeal for trea&s;on was brought again&s;t the duke of Glouce&s;ter, and the earls of Arundel and Warwick, by the earls of Rutland, Kent, Huntingdon, Nottingham, Somer&s;et, Sali&s;bury, the lord Spen&s;er, and Wil$iam Scroop chamberlain of the ho$&s;hol$: the bill being read and con&s;idered, the appealed lords were indulged with time till the four|teenth day of September, to prepare an&s;wers to the articles of their impeach|ment in parliament. But it was not Richard's intention to allow Glouce&s;ter the privilege of a trial. He had &s;ent Sir William Rickhill, one of the ju&s;tices of the common pleas, with a commi&s;&s;ion to examine the duke at Calais, hoping that this artful l$wyer wo$ld have extracted a confe&s;&s;ion of trea$onable practices from the duke, by tampe$ing with the heat and impatience of his temper. But as he acknowledged nothing that amounted to trea&s;on, Richard ordered the e$rl of Nottingham, who was governor of Calais, to give directions for his be$ng privately murdered. The&s;e directions were executed by four a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins ca$$ed Hall, Loveto$t, Serle, and Frances, who conveyed the duke from the $a$t$e of Calais to a public i$n, where he was informed of his de&s;tiny, in which he acqu$$&s;ced without emotion, and was &s;mothered between two &s;ea|t$er-beds on a pallet: then they &s;tripped the body, and laying it under the bed cloaths, pretended that he died in the night of an apoplexy. Thus died Tho|mas Wode&s;toke duke of Glo$ce&s;ter, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many virtues with an alloy or weakne&s;s and human infirmity, to which he fell a &s;ac$ifice. He was brave, open, $incere, and a well-wi&s;her to his country: but withal pa&s;&s;ionate, tur|bulent, ambitious of power, and fond of popularity; failings by which he int$$$ed upon him&s;elf the $word$ of the ki$g, and the hatred of the nobility, wh$le he acq$ired unbounded infl$$nce among the p$ople, by whom he was revered almo&s;t to idolatry: no wo$$er then that the whole nation was alarmed at th$ $word$ of his $ntimely fate. The d$kes of Lanca&s;ter and York breathed noth$$$ $$t revenge, and with a &s;mall body of forces ha&s;tened up to London, w$ere t$e, w$$$ r$$eived with open arms by the citizens; and Lanca&s;ter re&s;olv|ed to $word$ $or $word$ $$om $ortu$$$ and $$$t$e. In the mean time, how|ever

they found them&s;elves anticipated by the vigilance and fore&s;ight of R$|chard and his coun&s;ellors, who had reinforced his guards with ten thou&s;and archers; and expended the &s;ums of money which he had received by loan and &s;ub&s;idy, in &s;ecuring a majority in the en&s;uing parliament. Knowing that the duke of York implicitly followed the advice of Lanca&s;ter, and that this la&s;t was open to flattery and ambition, he employed his favourite Rutland to di&s;&s;uade his uncles from all oppo&s;ition; and that young nobleman &s;ucceeded in his negotiation. He expatiated upon the calamities of civil war; in&s;inuated that Richard would be obliged to have recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his father-in-law the French king, who might, on pretence of &s;upporting him, en&s;lave the country: he ob|&s;erved that though Glouce&s;ter's fate was l$mentable, it could not now be re|called; a&s;&s;ured them that the king remembred it with unfeigned &s;orrow and contrition; and finally promi&s;ed, in his maje&s;ty's name, that if they would lay a&s;ide all &s;chemes of re&s;entment, and con&s;ent to an hearty reconciliation with the king, they &s;hould pre&s;ide in his councils, and wholly direct him in all his fu|ture conduct. The dukes yielded to this remon&s;trance, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their adhe|rents, and all di&s;putes between the king and them were for the pre&s;ent com|promi&s;ed.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting at We&s;tmin&s;ter in the middle of Sep|tember, Sir John Bu&s;hy, a creature of the court, was, at the king's recom|mendation, cho&s;en &s;peaker, after he, with Sir William Bagot and Sir Henry Green, had undertaken to manage all the pro&s;ecutions which had been pre|viou&s;ly planned again&s;t the lords of the oppo&s;ition. The &s;e&s;&s;ion began with the con&s;ideration of a bill, enacting that holy church, the lords &s;piritual and tem|poral, all cities, boroughs, and commonalities of the realm, &s;hould enjoy their liberties and franchi&s;es as they had been enjoyed under his maje&s;ty's noble pro|genitors kings of England. This law being pa&s;&s;ed, the commons moved that whereas &s;everal judgments had been rever&s;ed, becau&s;e the clergy had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the trial, they &s;hould now appoint a general proctor, impowered to act for them in their ab&s;ence: Sir Thomas Piercy was accordingly appointed for this purpo&s;e, by the two archbi&s;hops and their clergy. Then the commi&s;&s;ion and &s;tatute made in the eleventh year of this reign was repealed, as being traiter|ou&s;ly obtained by con&s;traint and compul&s;ion, again&s;t the king's will, and to the prejudice of his crown and dignity. It was ordained that no &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould take place for the future; and that all per&s;ons endeavouring to procure any &s;uch in&s;trument, &s;hould &s;uffer as traitors: the pardons granted to the duke of Glouce&s;ter, the earls of Arundel and Warwick, in the eleventh year of the king's reign, as well as that afterwards pa&s;&s;ed in favour of Arundel at Wind&s;or, in the &s;eventeenth year of his maje&s;ty's reign, were revoked and annulled, as having been obtained by compul&s;ion. After the&s;e preliminary re&s;olutions, the commons prote&s;ted to the king in full parliament, that it was their intention, with his maje&s;ty's leave, to impeach any per&s;on or per&s;ons as often as they &s;hould think proper, during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of this parliament; and their prote&s;t was accepted and enrolled. This &s;tep being taken, they impeached Thomas Arun|del archbi&s;hop of Canterbury of high trea&s;on; for having been aiding, pro|curing, and advi&s;ing, in making a commi&s;&s;ion directed to Thomas duke of Glouce&s;ter, Richard earl of Arundel, and others, in the tenth year of his ma|je&s;ty's reign; which commi&s;&s;ion was made in prejudice of the king, his crown,
<PB N="194" REF="1960">
and dignity. He was likewi&s;e accu&s;ed of having advi&s;ed the duke of Glou|ce&s;ter and the earls of Arundel and Warwick to a&s;&s;ume the royal power, and arre&s;t the king's lieges Simon Burley and James Berners, whom they adjudged to death, contrary to the will of his maje&s;ty. The commons petitioned that the king would order the &s;aid Thomas to be put in &s;afe cu&s;tody; and the king replied, that as the impeachment affected a peer of the realm, he would avi&s;e with his council on the &s;ubject. They afterwards dem$nded judgment again&s;t the archbi&s;hop, who acknowledged in the king's pre&s;ence that he had been mi&s;|taken, and erred in his conduct relating to that commi&s;&s;ion; and therefore &s;ub|mitted to his maje&s;ty's mercy. He was declared a traitor, and condemned to perpetual bani&s;hment; his temporalities were &s;eized, his goods and chattels for$eited, and he him&s;elf was ordered to quit the kingdom in &s;ix weeks after the &s;entence was pronounced. This prelate had been cajoled by the king, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. $word$.</NOTE> a&s;&s;ured him in private, that if he would confe&s;s the charge and make no defence in parliament, he &s;hould have his maje&s;ty's pardon, and nothing would be done to his prejudice. But after he was condemned unheard in his ab&s;ence, the king, far from performing his promi&s;e, &s;ollicited and obtained his deprivation from the pope, who, at Richard's de&s;ire, nominated Roger Walden the king's trea&s;urer, to fill up the vacant bi&s;hoprick.</P>

<P>The archbi&s;hop's trial being fini&s;hed, the lords appellants exhibit|ed their bill of impeachment again&s;t the duke of Glouce&s;ter, the earls of Arun|del and Warwick, and Thomas Mortimer, accu&s;ing them of having procured the afore&s;aid commi&s;&s;ion; of having taken up arms again&s;t his majecty; of having effected the death and impri&s;onment of &s;everal li$ge &s;ubjects; and of hav|ing con&s;pired to depo&s;e the king, who in all probability would have fallen a &s;acrifice to their trea&s;on, had not they been re&s;trained from executing their &s;cheme, by the remon&s;trances of Henry of Lanca&s;ter earl of Derby, and Tho|mas Mowbray earl of Nottingham. The duke of Lanca&s;ter being appointed lord high &s;teward, the earl of Arundel was brought to his trial; and the appeal being read in his hearing, he pleaded his general pardon granted by the king and confirmed by the parliament. But this having been already repealed in the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, he was found guilty of high trea&s;on, condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, and all his e&s;tate real and per&s;onal was forfeited to the king's u&s;e; yet the &s;entence was mitigated into &s;imple decapitation. The duke of Glouce&s;ter, though dead, was declared a traitor to his king and coun|try, his e&s;tate forfeited, and his bl$od attainted. Then the appellants peti|tioned that his confe&s;&s;ion might be road in full parliament; and Sir William Rickhill produced a paper &s;igned by the duke's own hand, in which he acknow|ledged that he had been guilty of divers indi&s;creet actions, and offered &s;everal in&s;ults to his maje&s;ty, whom he had al&s;o &s;landered in the heat and precipitation of his pa&s;&s;ion; but at the &s;ame time he declared upon his &s;oul, that he had never entertained one thought to the prejudice of his royal dignity. Thomas earl of Warwick being brought by the con&s;table of the Tower into parliament, was by the &s;teward made acquainted with the nature of the appeal which had been lodged again&s;t him; and he pleading guilty and throwing him&s;elf on the king's mercy, was &s;ubjected to the &s;ame &s;entence which had been pronounced again&s;t the earl of Arundel; but the king changed the puni&s;hment into perpetual exile and confinement in the I&s;le of Man; with this provi&s;o, that if any means &s;hould
<PB N="195" REF="1970">
be u&s;ed for his e&s;cape, the &s;entence of the lord &s;teward &s;hould be executed with|out any further examination. Thomas Mortimer having fled into Ireland, and taken refuge in the mountains among the rebellious natives, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued through that kingdom, requiring him to appear within three months, and an&s;wer to the impeachment; otherwi&s;e he was declared a traitor, and all his e&s;tate forfeited.</P>

<P>After the&s;e &s;evere pro$criptions, which reflected di&s;grace upon the whole parliament, and particularly upon the dukes of Lanca&s;ter and York, and the earl of Derby, who acted &s;o officiou&s;ly again&s;t their neare&s;t relations and for|mer confederates, the commons interceded with the king in behalf of the lords and bi&s;hops, who had been named in the commi&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed in the tenth year of his reign, without procuring or acting in the execution thereof. The&s;e were the duke of York, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and Sir Richard Le Scroope, who&s;e loyalty and innocence were now acknowledged by a &s;tatute enacted in full par|liament. The commons likewi&s;e be&s;ought his maje&s;ty, that he would con&s;ider the &s;ervices of Henry of Lanca&s;ter earl of Derby, and Thomas de Mowbray earl of Nottingham, who had expre&s;ly hindered the rebellious lords from &s;eiz|ing the per&s;on of the king, renounced their &s;ociety, and given intimation of their traitorous intent. The commons recommended the&s;e noblemen in a &s;pe|cial manner to his maje&s;ty's favour, and reque&s;ted that he would publicly de|clare in parliament their good fame and loyal behaviour. Richard, &s;itting upon his throne, complied with their de&s;ire, declaring that to his own knowledge, the earls of Derby and Nottingham were good and faithful &s;ubjects; and it was voted that this declaration &s;hould have the force of a &s;tatute. All the&s;e tran&s;actions were clo&s;ed with &s;ome acts of the king's munificence, calculated to attach certain noblemen the more &s;trongly to his intere&s;t. The earl of Derby was created duke of Hereford, the earl of Rutland made duke of Albemar$e; Thomas Holland earl of Kent was promoted to the dukedom of Surrey; his brother John earl of Huntingdon to that of Ex$ter; and Thomas Mowbray earl of Nottingham was declared duke of Norfolk. The earldom of Somer|&s;et and marqui&s;ate of Dor&s;et were conferred upon John Beaufort; Thomas lord Spen&s;er was created earl of Glouce&s;ter, Ralph Nevil earl of We&s;tmoreland, Thomas Piercy earl of Worce&s;ter, and William Le Scroope earl of Wilt&s;hire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl. Tyrrel.</NOTE> The&s;e promotions being made, the parliament was adjourned to the twenty|&s;eventh day of January, when it was required to meet at Shrew&s;bury: but be|fore the members withdrew from London, the lords &s;piritual and temporal, to|gether with the knights of &s;hires, &s;wore &s;olemnly before the &s;hrine of St. Ed|ward in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, that they would maintain all the &s;tatutes, e&s;tabli&s;hments, ordinances, and judgments, enacted and given in this parlia|ment, without &s;uffering them to be revoked, rever&s;ed, or annulled, &s;aving to the king his right and royalty. Then the king, accompanied by the lords &s;pi|ritual and temporal, proceeded to the high altar, where the prelates and ordi|naries of the provinces of Canterbury and York, pronounced the &s;entence of the greater excommunication again&s;t all who &s;hould openly or privately, by deed or coun&s;el, contravene or oppo&s;e the &s;tatutes and regulations which the parliament had enacted and &s;worn to maintain, &s;aving &s;till the king's royalty and prerogative.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$98.</NOTE> When the parliament met again at Shrew&s;bury on the twenty|&s;eventh day of January, the chancellor having opened the &s;e$$ on with a &s;peech to the u&s;ual purport, de&s;ired they would take into con&s;ideration the &s;upplies that would be nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of England, Ireland, Guienne, the Marches of Calais, and the borders of Scotland, in ca&s;e the truce &s;hould not be pro|longed. Then the d$kes of Albemarle, Surrey, and Exeter, the marquis of Dor$$t, the earls of Sali&s;bury, Glouce&s;ter, and W$$$t&s;hire, as lords appellants, petitioned that the proceedings in the parliament of the eleventh year of his ma|je&s;ty's reign, again&s;t the judges who had given their opinions at Nottingham, &s;hould be repealed. The que&s;tions and an&s;wers there made, being now read p$blicly before the e&s;tates of parliament, they unanimou&s;$y declared that the &s;aid an&s;wers were good and lawful; and all the judges prote&s;ted, that had the &s;ame que&s;tions been &s;ubmitted to their con&s;ideration, they would have an|&s;wer$d them to the &s;ame effect. A &s;tatute was therefore enacted, annu$ling the parliament holden in the eleventh year of his maje&s;ty's reign; and all the judg|ments, &s;tatutes, and ordin$nces, made in that a&s;&s;$mbly, were rever&s;ed and re|pealed. John B$&s;&s;y the &s;peaker, ob$$r$$ng that many ordinances and &s;tatute$ made in different parliaments had been occa&s;ionally rever&s;ed, petitioned the
<PB N="197" REF="1990">
king, in the name of the commons, that the ordinances and judgments of this might be e&s;tabli&s;hed with all po&s;&s;ibe &s;ecurity. Richard advi&s;ed with the lords &s;piritual and temporal, as well as with the ju&s;tices and lawyers, on the &s;ubject of this petition; and they unanimou&s;ly declared there could be no greater &s;$cu|rity than the authority of parliament, which, however was reinforced by a re|newal of the oath taken by the lords and commons, to &s;upp$rt and maintain the proceedings of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e affairs of importance being di&s;patched, Tho|mas le D'E&s;pen&s;er petitioned that the &s;entence of exile and di&s;heri&s;on, pro|nounced again&s;t his grandfather and great grandfather, which had been re|pealed in the fifteenth year of the reign of Edward II. and afterwards renewed under Edward III. &s;hould now be repealed a &s;econd time, for the cau&s;es &s;pecified in the former repeal. The &s;entence was accordingly once more rever&s;ed; though in the &s;ucceeding reign of Henry IV. this favour was again annulled. The parliaments had made a practice, during the reigns of weak princes, of rever&s;ing the decrees of each other, according to the prevalency of intere&s;t in the court or oppo&s;ition. On the la&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the duke of Here$ord falling on his knees before the king, acknowledged that he had been concerned in many di&s;turbances and meetings, contrary to the peace of the kingdom and his maje&s;ty's royalty, though not with any intention to injure his &s;overeign; but as he now under&s;tood they were offences, he begged pardon with great hu|mility, and hoped he &s;hould obtain his maje&s;ty's forgivene&s;s. Richard gra|ciou&s;ly accepted of his acknowledgment, pardoned him in full parliament for any offence he might have committed, and promi&s;ed him his particular favour and protection. Then the parliament granted a more ample &s;ub&s;idy than had ever been given to his grandfather, de&s;iring he would be plea&s;ed to be&s;tow a certain &s;um of money upon tho&s;e who had been plundered at Radcot-Bridge, and defray the expences of the lords appellants. A general pardon was granted for pa&s;t offences in favour of all the king's &s;ubjects; though with a clau&s;e which excluded from the benefit of this amne&s;ty fifty per&s;ons, who&s;e names were not expre&s;&s;ed, but re&s;erved to the particular knowledge and plea&s;ure of the king, who might nominate them occa&s;ionally: &s;o that no man in England could a&s;&s;$re him&s;elf that he was not excepted. As many private petitions had not been an&s;wered, and a good de$l of bu&s;ine&s;s left undone, the commons petitioned that the ki$g would empower a committee of lords and others, whom they named for th$$ p$rpo&s;e, to di&s;patch tho&s;e affairs that were left unfini&s;hed; and his ma$e&s;ty co$piying with their reque&s;t, the whole authority of parliament devolved upon the king, twelve peers, and &s;ix commoners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were John duke of Lanca&s;ter, Ed|mund duke of York, Edward duke of Albemarle, Thomas duke of S$rr$y, John duke of Ex$ter, John marquis of Dor&s;et, Roger earl of $arche, John earl of Sali&s;bury, Henry earl of Northum|berland, Thomas earl of Glouce&s;ter, Thomas earl of Winche&s;ter, and William earl of Wilt$hire, John Bu&s;&s;ey, Henry Green, John Ru&s;&s;$l, Henry Chelme&s;wicke, Robert Tey, and John Golo$re, knights.</NOTE>.

<P>The fir&s;t object that fell under the con&s;ideration of the com|mittee was a charge exhibited again&s;t the duke of Norfolk by Henry duke of Hereford, who taxed him with having &s;poken &s;editious words again&s;t his ma|je&s;ty, in a privat$ conver&s;ation between Brentford and London. A paper, con|taining the &s;ub&s;tance of this conver&s;ation, being read before the king and the lords in parliament, it was referred to the committee; and after much debate and examination of the accu&s;ed, who denied the charge, the king and the &s;aid committee decreed, that, for want of &s;ufficient proof the di&s;pute &s;hould be de|cided by &s;ingle combat, according to the laws of chivalry. The twenty-ninth day of April was fixed for the duel, and the li&s;ts were appointed at Coventry, to which place the king repaired, accompanied by all his peers, and created the duke of Albemarle high con&s;table, and the duke of Surrey lord mare&s;chal for the occa&s;ion. Hereford the challenger fir&s;t appeared on a white cour&s;er gayly capari&s;oned, and armed cap-a-pee, with his drawn &s;word in his hand. When he approached the li&s;ts, the mare&s;chal demanded who he was; and he an&s;wered, "I am Henry of Lanca&s;ter duke of Hereford, come hither accord|ing to my duty again&s;t Thomas Mowbray duke of Norfolk, a fal&s;e traitor to God, the king, the realm, and me." Then taking the oath that his quarrel was ju&s;t and true, he de&s;ired to enter the li&s;ts, which being granted, he &s;heathed his &s;word, pulled down his beaver, cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on the forehead, &s;eized his lance, pa&s;&s;ed the barrier, alighted, and &s;at down, in a chair of green velvet placed at one end of the li&s;ts. He had &s;carce taken his &s;eat, when the king came into the field with great pomp, attended by the peers, the count of St. Pol, who came from France on purpo&s;e to &s;ee this famous trial, and ten thou&s;and men at arms to prevent tumults and di&s;turbance. His ma|je&s;ty, being &s;eated in his chair of &s;tate, the king at arms proclaimed, that none but &s;uch as were appointed to mar&s;hal the field, &s;hould pre&s;ume to touch the li$ts on pain of death. Then another herald pronounced aloud, "Behold here Henry of Lanca&s;ter duke of Hereford, who has entered the li&s;ts to per|f$rm his devoir, again&s;t Thomas Mowbray duke of Norfolk, on pain of be|ing counted fal&s;e and recreant." The duke of Norfolk immediately appeared in arms, mounted upon a barbed hor&s;e, with a coat of arms of crim&s;on velvet embroidered with lions of &s;ilver and mulberry trees; and, having taken his oath before the con&s;table and mare&s;chal, entered the field, exclaiming aloud, "God de$end the right." Alighting from his hor&s;e, he placed him&s;elf in a chair of crim&s;on velvet, oppo&s;ite to his antagoni&s;t, at the other end of the li&s;ts. Then the mare&s;chal, having mea&s;ured their lances, delivered one to the challenger, and &s;ent a knight with the other to the duke of Norfolk, and pro|clamation was made that they &s;hould prepare for the combat. They imme|diately mounted their hor&s;es, clo&s;ed their beavers, fixed their lances in the re&s;ts, and, the trumpets &s;ounding a charge, the duke of Hereford began his career with great violence; but, before he could join his antagoni&s;t, the king threw down his warder, and the heralds interpo&s;ed. Richard ordered their lances to be taken away, and they returned to their chairs, while the king re|$ired to council, where their doom was determined without blood&s;hed. Sir John Bouray returned to the field at the king's command; and, &s;ilence being enjoined by proclamation$ pronounced their &s;entence to this effect: That fora&s;much as the appellant and defendant had honourably appeared in the
<PB N="199" REF="2010">
li&s;ts, ready and even forward to engage in &s;ingle combat, their courage was &s;ufficiently a&s;certained; and the king, in order to prevent the effu&s;ion of chri&s;|tian blood, had decreed, with the advice of his council and committee of par|liament, that Henry duke of Hereford &s;hould within fifteen days depart the kingdom, and go into exile for the &s;pace of ten years, on pain of death; that the duke of Norfolk &s;hould be bani&s;hed for life, becau&s;e he had not been able to clear him&s;elf of the imputation of having &s;poken &s;editious words again&s;t his maje&s;ty; and that all his revenues &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tred, until the king &s;hould be reimbur&s;ed in all the &s;ums which Mowbray had embezzled, on pretence of paying the garri&s;on of Calais. Then proclamation was made, that no per&s;on &s;hould pre&s;ume to intercede with the king in behalf of each party, on pain of incurring his maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure; and the dukes were obliged to promi&s;e upon oath, that they would never meet willingly, nor maintain the lea&s;t intercour&s;e in foreign countries, nor carry on any &s;ort of corre&s;pondence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Placit.

<P>Nothing can be a &s;tronger proof of the arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition of the king and his committee than this &s;entence, by which the duke of Here|ford was driven into exile without having been charged with any offence, and perpetual bani&s;hment inflicted upon Thomas Mowbray, who had appealed to the only trial by which his innocence could be manife&s;ted, if not &s;ufficiently a&s;certained by his accu&s;er's failing to convict him by legal evidence. There was &s;omething mean and perfidious in Hereford's betraying the particulars of a private conver&s;ation, which appears to have contained nothing dangerous to the &s;tate or the &s;overeign. He in all probability con&s;idered Mowbray as his rival in intere&s;t, con&s;equently a trouble&s;ome bar to the execution of that &s;cheme he had projected; and perhaps he longed for an opportunity to revenge the murder of his uncle Glouce&s;ter, in which the duke of Norfolk was prin|cipally concerned. Richard dreaded both equally, as noblemen of dangerous power and ambition, and was glad of a pretence for expelling Mowbray from the kingdom; but that he &s;hould venture to bani&s;h Hereford, without any cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned, is a very extraordinary circum&s;tance; and that his own father the duke of Lanca&s;ter &s;hould tamely acquie&s;ce in the &s;entence, is &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing. By this time, the &s;pirit of that nobleman &s;eems to have been evaporated with the vigour of his youth; for he complied with every mea&s;ure the king propo&s;ed, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be made a tool, for effecting the ruin of his own family. The duke of Norfolk was overwhelmed with grief and de&s;pondence at the judgment which was awarded again&s;t him. He re|tired to Germany, from whence he repaired to Venice, where in a little time he died of &s;orrow and chagrin. Hereford on the contrary bore his fate with great re&s;ignation, and behaved with &s;uch re&s;pectful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, when he went to take his leave of the king at Eltham, that Richard, plea&s;ed with his deportment, re|mitted four years of his exile. He withdrew to Paris, where he met with a favourable reception from the French king, and in all probability would have married the only daughter of the duke of Berry, had not the match been de|feated by the interpo&s;ition of Richard, who &s;ent the earl of Sali&s;bury as his amba&s;&s;ador to repre&s;ent Hereford as a per&s;on who had been guilty of trea&s;on|able practices; and to a&s;&s;ure the French court that he would never be permitted to return to his own country. The princes of the blood, alarmed at this de|claration,
<PB N="200" REF="2020">
broke off the match abruptly, and, when Hereford expo&s;tulated with t$em on the &s;ub$ect, ma$e h$m $cquainted with their rea&s;ons for retract|ing the a&s;&s;$nt they h$d already g$ven to his propo&s;al.

<P>This tran&s;action was &s;o $nju&s;t and arbitrary, that Richard mu&s;t have laid a&s;ide all intention to keep mea&s;ures with his people, and laid his account with being expo&s;ed to the re$entment of Here$or$, be$ore he ven|tured to give it the $anction of his authority. By the death of his uncle, he thought him&s;elf freed from all re&s;traint: he plunged $nto all manner of effeminate debauchery and profligate profu&s;ion, and took the mo&s;t unju&s;ti|fiable methods to rai&s;e money $or the &s;upport of his extravagance. Over and above the great &s;ub&s;idies, granted by a corrupt parliament, he extorted loans under the name of Benevolence; he trumped up a charge of high trea&s;on again&s;t &s;eventeen counties for having &s;ided with the duke of Glouce&s;ter and the lords of the oppo&s;ition; and, notwith&s;tanding the pardon which had been confirmed in parliament, threatened to &s;poil and de&s;troy them as public enemies, unle&s;s they would &s;ubmit wholly to his plea&s;ure; &s;o that the inhabitants were obliged to redeem their lives and e&s;tates with exorbitant &s;ums of money, by the payment of which they were utterly impoveri&s;hed. He impo&s;ed new oaths upon the &s;heriffs of counties, by which they bound them&s;elves to obey him in all his arbitrary and illegal commands: the garri&s;ons abroad were neglected:
<PB N="201" REF="2030">
the northern counties ruined by the incur&s;ions of the Scots, whom he had not &s;pirit enough to repel: the native Iri&s;h made great progre&s;s in wre&s;ting their antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from the hands of the Engli&s;h: no care was taken to protect the trade of the nation: the government was de$pi$ed abroad, and in&s;ulted at home: and univer&s;al di&s;affection prevailed again&s;t the king and his mini&s;try. The people naturally turned their eyes upon the duke of Lanca&s;ter as the only per&s;on from whom they could hope redre&s;s. He was a prince of the royal blood, di&s;tingui&s;hed by his great talents, beloved by the Engli&s;h in general, and $timulated by injuries again&s;t Richard, who&s;e per&s;on they contemned and who&s;e &s;way they dete&s;ted. The malecontents, among the nobility and gen|try, made private overtures to the duke of Lanca&s;ter, re&s;iding in France, &s;olliciting him to return &s;peedily to England, and head the oppo&s;ition, in which ca&s;e they would &s;upply him with a powerful army, and hazard their lives and fortunes in his &s;ervice. Though the duke was perfectly well plea&s;ed with the&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE> advances, he received them at fir&s;t with great caution, until he had no longer any rea&s;on to doubt the &s;incerity of tho&s;e by whom he was addre&s;&s;ed; and he was confirmed in his purpo&s;e by the remon&s;trances of Thomas archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, who vi&s;ited him in the di&s;gui&s;e of a $riar's habit, and per&s;uaded him that the people of England would unanimou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e again&s;t Richard.

<P>The earl of Marche, pre&s;umptive heir of the crown, having been appointed the king's lieutenant in Ireland, was &s;lain in a &s;kirmi$h by the native Iri&s;h; and Richard was &s;o exa&s;perated at the fate of his kin&s;man, that he de|termined to revenge his death in per&s;on. With this view he a&s;&s;embled a nume|rous army, which was enli&s;ted, payed, and accommodated, by means of &s;uch illegal exactions and oppre&s;&s;ion as completed the di&s;gu$$ of the nation. About Whit&s;untide he proceeded to Bri&s;tol, in order to embark, and was at|tended by the dukes of Albemarle and Exeter, with &s;everal other noble|men, including the &s;ons of Lanca&s;ter and Glouce&s;ter, whom he detained as ho&s;tages for the quiet of the kingdom in his ab&s;ence, during which he ap|pointed the duke of York guardian of England. While he tarried at Bri&s;tol for a favourable wind, he &s;ent a pur&s;uivant to the earl of Northumberland, commanding him to join him immediately with all the forces he could rai&s;e; but that nobleman excu&s;ed him&s;elf from engaging in the expedition, on pre|tence of his being obliged to defend the Scotti&s;h marches. Richard, a$$ronted at his refu&s;al, p$oclaimed the earl and all his adherents traitors, and ordered his e&s;tates to be &s;eized for the benefit of the royal trea&s;ury. This imprudent &s;tep furni&s;hed Northumberland with a &s;pecious pretext for renouncing his alle|giance, and perhaps provoked him to a revolt, in which he would not other|wi&s;e have engaged.

<PB N="202" REF="2040">
with his intention, that they might be prepared to receive him at his landing; and, knowing the French king was aver&s;e to his &s;cheme, de&s;ired that mo|n$r$h would favour him with a &s;afe-conduct to Brittany, where he wanted to vi&s;it the duke, who was his kin&s;man. This being readily granted, he &s;et out $or Nantes, where he hired three &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and embarked with the arch|b$$hop of Canterbury, that prelate's nephew the &s;on and heir of the late earl of Arundel, lord Cobham, Sir Thomas Erpington, Sir Thomas Ram&s;tone, and a retinue of about four&s;core per&s;ons. After having cruized along the coa&s;ts, and touched at &s;everal places, in order to di&s;cover the inclinations of the people, he at length landed at Raven&s;purre in York&s;hire, pretending that his &s;ole aim was to recover his rightful inheritance, which the king unlawfully detained; and there he was joined by the lords Willoughby, Ro&s;s, Darcy, and Beaumont. Then he proceeded to Donca&s;ter, where his cau&s;e was e&s;pou$ed by the earl of Northumberland and his &s;on Hot&s;pur, the earl of We&s;tmore|land, with many gentlemen, attended by a numerous body of va&s;&s;als and ad|herents. The duke of York no &s;ooner received intelligence of his arrival, than he &s;ummoned the warlike bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, the lord chancellor Scrope, the earl of Wilt&s;hire lord trea&s;urer, Sir John Bu&s;&s;y, Sir Henry Green, Sir William Bagot, and Sir John Ru&s;&s;el, to meet in London, and concert mea|&s;ures for the defence of the kingdom; and there they re&s;olved to a&s;&s;emble the military tenants of the crown with all expedition, appointing the rendez|vous at St. Alban's. Thither they re&s;orted in great numbers; but the ma|jority refu&s;ed to &s;erve again&s;t the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who, they publicly af|firmed, had been unju&s;tly bani&s;hed and deprived of his lawful inheritance. They had another motive equally &s;trong, for refu&s;ing their a&s;&s;i&s;tance on this occa&s;ion: they could not bear the pre&s;ence of the earl of Wilt&s;hire, Bu&s;&s;y, Green, and Bagot, who farmed the revenues of the whole kingdom; and were univer&s;ally dete&s;ted as the mon&s;ters of iniquity and corruption who had per|verted the mind of Richard by their pernicious coun&s;el. Many people who had a&s;&s;embled at St. Alban's, and were well di&s;po&s;ed towards the king, retired at &s;ight of the&s;e four unpopular mini&s;ters; who, &s;eeing York in danger of being wholly abandoned, fled with precipitation to Bri&s;tol, in order to em|bark for Ireland. The duke of York, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the tor|rent of Lanca&s;ter's pop$larity, broke his &s;taff of office, and laid a&s;ide all thoughts of oppo&s;ition: then all the re&s;t of the nobility either declared openly for the duke of Lanca&s;ter, or held private corre&s;pondence with him and his adherents. His followers by this time amounted to three&s;core thou&s;and fight|ing men; and, in his march towards the capital, far from meeting with any interruption, he was favoured by every country through which he pa&s;&s;ed, and received in London with all the marks of triumph and exultation.</P>

When he arrived at Eve&s;ham, he under&s;tood his uncle York was at Berkeley-Ca&s;tle in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, with a body of forces, which he had rai&s;ed in order to join Richard at his landing from Ireland: Lan|ca&s;ter, advancing towards his quarters, invited him to a conference; and they had an interview in the church, where matters were compromi&s;ed, and the guar|dian joined his nephew. Then they pa&s;&s;ed quietly along, and every place and

per&s;on &s;ubmitted to them, until they came before the ca&s;tle of Bri&s;tol, which was well fortified and provided for a &s;iege; the garri&s;on being commanded by Sir Peter Courteney, under the direction o$ the earl of Wilt&s;hire, accompanied by Sir John Bu&s;&s;y, and Sir Henry Green, who had fled thither from St. Al|ban's. He forthwith inve&s;ted the place, and repeated his a&s;&s;aults with &s;uch vigour, that in four days the be&s;ieged were fain to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. The earl of Wilt&s;hire and his two companions were that &s;ame day beheaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham. Froi$&s;art. Chr. Otterb$ Rymer.</NOTE> at the importunate de&s;ire of the people; but, Sir William Bagot had e&s;caped to Che&s;ter, where he embarked for Ireland, and was the fir&s;t per$on who made the king acquainted with the de&s;cent and proceedings of Lanca&s;ter. Richard is &s;aid to have &s;lighted the&s;e tidings at fir&s;t, until he was &s;timulated by the exhortations of the noblemen who attended him in the Iri&s;h expedition. The earl of Sali&s;bury was &s;ent over to rai&s;e an army in Wales, and the king promi&s;ed to follow him in &s;ix days: but he was detained much longer by fri|volous delays in the embarkation of his troops; and the&s;e delays proved the de&s;truction of his affairs. Sali&s;bury met with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s in his levies, that in a few days he was at the head of forty thou&s;and men; but as the king did not arrive at the appointed time, they began to murmur, and were with great difficulty per&s;uaded to wait for him a few days beyond the time he had fixed for his return; but that being expired, they concluded he had met with &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter, and di&s;per&s;ing, retired to their own habitations.</P>

<P>At length the king, having committed the &s;ons of Glouce&s;ter and Lanca&s;ter clo&s;e pri&s;oners to the ca&s;tle of Trim, embarked for England with his forces; and, landing at Milford-Haven, proceeded to Caermarthen, where he received a particular detail of his own misfortune. He under&s;tood that the troops, a&s;&s;embled by Sali&s;bury, were di&s;banded and di&s;per&s;ed; that almo&s;t all his ca&s;tles, from the borders of Scotland to the Marches of Wales, had &s;urrendered to the duke of Lanca&s;ter; that the city of London had de|clared in his favour; that he was &s;upported by the principal nobility of the kingdom; that the duke of York had joined him with the forces he had rai&s;ed to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s; and that his favourites had lo&s;t their lives at Bri&s;tol. This concurrence of di&s;a&s;trous circum&s;tances quite overwhelmed the weak mind of Richard, who abandoned him&s;elf to womani&s;h complaints and de|&s;pondence. In vain did his faithful Che&s;hiremen endeavour to rai&s;e his droop|ing &s;pirits, by a&s;&s;uring him they would &s;pend the la&s;t drop of their blood in his &s;ervice. His courage was quite di&s;&s;ipated: he dur&s;t not venture a battle again&s;t the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who&s;e army was increa&s;ed to an hundred thou|$and fighting men, commanded by experienced officers. The earl of Sali&s;|bury advi&s;ed him to embark for Bourdeaux; and the bi&s;hop of Carlile, with Sir Stephen Scrope, were of the &s;ame opinion: but their advice was over-ruled by his uterine brother John Holland duke of Exeter, at who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion he &s;tole away in the night from his forces, and repaired with about twenty at|tendants to Conway-Ca&s;tle. From thence lord Thomas Piercy, &s;teward o$ the hou&s;hold, withdrew, after having publicly broke his &s;taff of office in the ca&s;tle-hall, and joined his brother the earl of Northumberland, who was th$ chief coun&s;ellor and confident of Henry duke of Lanca&s;ter. The duke of Albemarle, who, as con&s;table of England, commanded Richard's litt$e army, was no &s;ooner informed of the king's retreat, than he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the troops, and
<PB N="204" REF="2060">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> rep$ired to his father York, whom the duke of Lanca&s;ter had left at Bri&s;tol. A$$er the reduction of that fortre&s;s, he marched to Glouce&s;ter, and from thence to Ro&s;s and Hereford, where he was joined by the bi&s;hop of that &s;ee and Sir Edmund Mort$mer. He next vi&s;ited Leym&s;te$, Ludlow, and Shrew&s;bury, where he received tenders of &s;ervice from all the noblemen in the neighbour|hood, and a deputation from Che&s;ter, to which place he repaired. From thence he di&s;patched an expre&s;s to Ireland, for the relea&s;e of his own &s;on, and the heir of the late duke of Glouce&s;ter, who had been impri&s;oned by Richard: the governor of the ca&s;tle of Trim dur&s;t not refu&s;e to &s;et them at liberty; and Lanca&s;ter's &s;on came over immediately to his father at Che&s;ter, but his cou&s;in, embarking on board of another ve&s;&s;el, had the misfortune to be drowned.</P>

<P>Mean while king Richard, being bereft of all a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;alutary advice, and di&s;tracted by a thou&s;and fears, in the ca&s;tle of Conway, &s;ent his brother the duke of Exeter to treat with the duke of Lanca&s;ter about an accommodation, and the duke of Surrey obtained leave to accompany him in this emba&s;&s;y; which, however, proved very unfortunate, for they were both detained as pri&s;oners at Che&s;ter. The duke of Lanca&s;ter having con|&s;ulted with his two chief confidents, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and the earl of Northumberland, about the means for preventing the king from leav|ing the realm by the &s;ea, which was &s;till open for his e&s;cape, &s;ent the earl to amu&s;e him with promi&s;es, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring him off by &s;tratagem from the ca&s;tle of Conway. Northumberland, advancing to the river of Conway, &s;ent an herald to Richard, de&s;iring a &s;afe-conduct for him&s;elf only; which being granted, he went to the ca&s;tle, and being admitted into the king's pre|&s;ence, demanded, in the name of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, that a parliament &s;hould be immediately &s;ummoned to rever&s;e the &s;entence of bani&s;hment which had been pronounced again&s;t the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and re&s;tore him to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate: that the dukes of Surrey and Exeter, the earl of Sa|li&s;bury, and bi&s;hop of Carlile, &s;hould be tried for the offences they had com|mitted, together with all tho&s;e who were concerned in the death of the duke of Glouce&s;ter. If his maje&s;ty would a&s;&s;ent to the&s;e propo&s;als, Northumber|land declared in the name of his principal, that Richard &s;hould be re&s;tored to all the prerogatives of the royal dignity; that Lanca&s;ter had &s;worn by the body of Chri&s;t to fulfil the articles with the utmo&s;t punctuality; and that he (Northumberland) was ready to incur the &s;ame obligation. The king him&s;elf did not much rely upon the &s;incerity of this amba&s;&s;ador; but the earl of Sa|li&s;bury, the bi&s;hop of Carlile, and &s;everal other knights, being unwilling to drive matters to extremity, per&s;uaded him to tru&s;t the earl upon his oath, which he took accordingly in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner upon the &s;acrament. Then Richard de&s;ired him to ride on before, and he would follow him to Flint-Ca&s;tle, where he would be nearer the duke, to &s;ettle the terms of accom|modation. This ca&s;tle had already &s;urrendered to Northumberland; who, placing an ambu&s;h behind a rock on the road through which the king was obliged to pa&s;s, &s;uddenly &s;urrounded that unfortunate monarch, who was con|veyed a pri&s;oner to Flint-Ca&s;tle. When he found him&s;elf betrayed, he de|clared he would return to Conway: but the earl, &s;eizing his hor&s;e's bridle, told him plainly, that he &s;hould not return; for he would conduct him to the
<PB N="205" REF="2070">
duke of Lanca&s;ter. Richard told him, that the God by whom he had &s;worn would do ju&s;tice at the day of judgment: but Northumberland, without &s;eeming to entertain any religious &s;cruples, hurried him into the ca&s;tle, where he left him with the earl of Sali&s;bury and the bi&s;hop of Carlile, in the utmo&s;t terror and &s;u&s;pence; while he him&s;elf proceeded to Che&s;ter, to make the duke acquainted with the &s;ucce&s;s of his expedition. Next morning Lanca&s;ter ad|vanced at the head of his army towards Flint-Ca&s;tle; and &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury before, with the earl of Rutland and the lord Thomas Piercy, to prepare the king for his arrival. Richard, de&s;crying them from the walls, went down to receive them; and, when they approached his pre&s;ence, they fell down upon their knees with all the marks of the mo&s;t profound veneration. Then the king conferred with the archbi&s;hop in private; and afterwards this pre|late returned to Lanca&s;ter, with his two companions, to give an account of his emba&s;&s;y. Immediately after their departure, the earl of Northumberland came and told the king, that the duke would not enter the ca&s;tle until his maje&s;ty &s;hould have dined. Richard &s;at down at table with the earl, bi&s;hop, and &s;e|veral knights, who had followed his fortune; but their meal was very di&s;|agreeably di&s;turbed by the intru&s;ion and in&s;olence of &s;everal knights and e&s;quires, belonging to the duke, who pre&s;&s;ed into the apartment, and in&s;ulted the king's company with rude menaces of death and de&s;truction; &s;o that they were overwhelmed with terror and di&s;may. In the afternoon, the duke of Lanca&s;ter entered the ca&s;tle in complete armour, &s;ave that his head was bare; and the king coming down from the tower, attended by Sali&s;bury and the bi&s;hop, received him with the &s;alutation of <Q>&startq;Cou&s;in of Lanca&s;ter, you are welcome.&endq;</Q> The duke, bowing three times to the ground, replied in the&s;e terms: <Q>&startq;My lord the king, I am come &s;ooner than you appointed, becau&s;e your people &s;ay you have for one and twenty years governed with rigour and indi&s;cretion; &s;o that they are very ill &s;atisfied with your conduct: but, if it plea&s;e God, I will help you to govern them better for the time to come.&endq;</Q> To this declaration the king made no other an&s;wer, but <Q>&startq;Fair cou&s;in, &s;ince it plea&s;es you, it plea&s;es us likewi&s;e.&endq;</Q> Then the duke &s;poke to the bi&s;hop of Carlile, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the earl of Sali&s;bury, import|ing, that &s;ince he had di&s;dained to &s;peak to him at Paris, he &s;hould now in his turn be treated with the &s;ame di&s;re&s;pect. After this &s;hort dialogue, the duke ordered the king's hor&s;es to be brought out of the &s;table; and, two wretched animals being produced, Richard mounted one, while Sali&s;bury made u&s;e of the other. In this &s;orry equipage they rode to Che&s;ter, and were conveyed to the ca&s;tle with a great noi&s;e of trumpets, through a va&s;t concour&s;e of people, who &s;coffed at them as they pa&s;&s;ed along. Richard and his com|panions were lodged in the Great Tower, where they found the duke of Exeter, and there they remained three days; during which the duke di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a great number of his forces, retaining only about thirty thou&s;and men, which he deemed a &s;ufficient number to conduct the king to London, and execute the other parts of his de&s;ign.</P>

<P>At the head of this convoy, the duke began his march for the capital, with his royal pri&s;oner, who had well nigh e&s;caped at Litchfield, by creeping through the window of a tower into a garden, where he lay for &s;ome time concealed; but, being di&s;covered, he was u&s;ed with great barbarity, and
<PB N="206" REF="2080">
brought back to the Tower, where he was committed to the cu&s;tody of twelve armed men, who watched continually in his apartment. At &s;ome di&s;tance from London, the duke was met by the recorder, and a number of knights and e&s;quires, who de&s;ired, in the name of the commons of London, that he would b$head Richard, and all tho&s;e that were taken in his &s;ervice: but Lan|ca&s;ter re$ected the propo&s;al, telling them, that &s;uch conduct would reflect ever|la&s;ting d$$gr$$e upon him and all his adherents; and that he would leave the delinquents to the judgment of a free parliament. The duke was received at London by all the city companies in their liveries; and he made his entrance amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, who cried aloud, "Long live the "good duke of Lanca&s;ter our deliverer." Richard was conveyed to the Tower, where the royal lodgings were prepared for his reception; but the duke re|paired to St. Paul's church, where he performed his devotion at the high altar, and then kneeled at his father's tomb, which he bedewed with his tears. Having lodged a few days in the palace belonging to the bi&s;hop of London, he cho&s;e his habitation in the hou&s;e of the knights of St. John in the &s;uburbs, where he re&s;ided till the meeting of parliament, which he had already &s;um|moned, in Richard's name, to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the la&s;t day of Sep|tember.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ de L$$b. $word$ T$rrel. $word$ Pol$d. Virgil.</NOTE> Nothing demon&s;trates the mi&s;conduct of the king, and the op|pre&s;&s;ion that prevailed in this reign, &s;o clearly as the univer&s;al defection of the people in favour of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who, in &s;even and forty days, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all England without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, except from the garri&s;on of Bri$tol-Ca&s;tle He was al&s;o particularly fortunate in another re&s;pect; for, in Holt-Ca&s;tle, he found all Richard's jewels and trea&s;ure, amounting to &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds, together with all his hor&s;es and baggage.</P>

<DIV4 N="88" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LXXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all his &s;ucce&s;s, the duke met with &s;ome ob&s;tacles between him and the throne, which he found &s;ome difficulty in fur|mounting. To claim the crown by conque&s;t, would have been an impolitic &s;tep, that mu&s;t have ruined all his popularity, and rai&s;ed up powerful enemies again&s;t his preten&s;ions: and he could not, with any &s;hadow of rea&s;on, demand it by hereditary right, during the life of Edmund, &s;on of Roger Mor|timer, who had been declared pre&s;umptive heir of the crown, as &s;ineal de|&s;cendant of Lionel duke of Clarence. He, therefore, by the advice of his uncle the duke of York, re&s;olved to a&s;cend the throne upon a mixed title, a$$&s;ing from the voluntary re&s;ignation of Richard, the depo&s;ition of that prince by parliament, and his own &s;ervices to the nation, added to a my&s;terious claim deduced from Edmund Crouchback earl of Lanca&s;ter, who he pre|tended was in fact the elde&s;t &s;on of Henry III. This re&s;olution being formed, they tampered with Richard, who began to be refractory, and even retracted the promi&s;e of re&s;igning the crown, which it &s;eems he had made to the arch|bi&s;hop at Conway-Ca&s;tle. In all probability, he was provoked by the arrogant behaviour of Lanca$ter, and the per&s;onal in&s;ults he had received &s;ince his cap|tivity. For when the duke vi&s;ited him in the Tower, and told him that his uncle of York and cou&s;in Aumerle had &s;omething to communicate to him in private, he could not help giving way to his indignation, even in pre&s;ence of the&s;e noblemen, whom he taxed with having betrayed him and the kingdom. Aumerle, who &s;tood covered in his apartment, no &s;ooner heard the&s;e words,
<PB N="207" REF="2090">
than he threw his hat on the ground, telling him he lied; and Richard an|&s;wered, that he was an in&s;olent traitor unworthy of his notice. Lanca&s;ter in|terpo&s;ing, checked Aumerle for the indecency of his behaviour; and treated the king with more exterior civility than he had hitherto &s;hewn to that unfor|tunate prince, who, when his pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided and he reflected cooly on his de|plorable &s;ituation, re&s;olved to comply with all the propo&s;als of his adver&s;ary, well knowing that otherwi&s;e he had no mercy to expect from a conqueror of his character. When the form of re&s;ignation was brought to him on Michael|mas day in the morning, he deferred &s;igning the in&s;trument until he &s;hould have conferred with his cou&s;in Henry, who going to him in the afternoon, he execu|ted the deed with &s;eeming chearfulne&s;s, in pre&s;ence of the archbi&s;hop of York and bi&s;hop of Hereford, whom he de&s;ired to notify his re&s;ignation to the par|liament, and tell the e&s;tates in his name, that he wi&s;hed his cou&s;in the duke of Lanca&s;ter might be cho&s;en as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. At the &s;ame time he pulled his &s;ignet|ring from his finger, and delivered it to the duke as a further te&s;timony of his good will, which he de&s;ired they would al&s;o communicate to the parliament. The in&s;trument, which he him&s;elf read aloud in the hearing of tho&s;e prelates, the earls of Northumberland and We&s;tmoreland, with &s;everal other noblemen, eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and lawyers, contained a relea&s;e of fealty and homage formerly &s;worn by his &s;ubjects; a renunciation of the royal dignity, crown, dominions, and government, for which he owned him&s;elf altogether unqualified; and a promi&s;e that he would never retract this re&s;ignation.</P>

<DIV4 N="89" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LXXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Next day the parliament a&s;&s;embling at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the pre|lates of York and Hereford publicly declared the king's me&s;&s;age, and produced the re&s;ignation, which being read in Latin and Engli&s;h, was admitted with the unanimous a&s;&s;ent of the a&s;&s;embly. Then it was agreed, that for the advantage of the nation, and in order to remove all &s;cruples and &s;ini&s;ter &s;u&s;picions, the crimes and mi&s;conduct of the king during his admini&s;tration &s;hould be &s;um|med up in writing, and publi&s;hed to the nation, that it might more plainly per|ceive the nece&s;&s;ity for his being depo&s;ed. Articles of impeachment were ac|cordingly exhibited again&s;t Richard in three and thirty articles, implying, That he had, without judgment or di&s;cretion, &s;quandered away the crown revenues, and committed the admini&s;tration to per&s;ons without parts or integrity, who oppre&s;&s;ed the people with intolerable exactions: That he had unju&s;tly accu&s;ed and puni&s;hed as traitors, the commi&s;&s;ioners e&s;tabli&s;hed by parliament to reform the abu&s;es of government: That he had extorted from the judges an a&s;&s;ent to illegal opinions, with a view to condemn the earls of Arundel, Warwick, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction: That his uncle the duke of Glouce&s;ter was mur|dered by his private direction: That he had levied troops to make war upon tho&s;e three noblemen, and countenanced his &s;oldiers in the commi&s;&s;ion of all manner of outrages: That notwith&s;tanding his proclamation, declaring that tho&s;e three noblemen were arre&s;ted for &s;light mi&s;demeanors, he had procured their condemnation upon a charge of high trea&s;on: That he had extorted ex|ce&s;&s;ive fines from &s;everal counties, on pretence of crimes which had been par|doned in the general amne&s;ty: That he had refu&s;ed to communicate the pub|lic affairs to the commi&s;&s;ioners e&s;tabli&s;hed in parliament, to take charge of the admini&s;tration: That he had forbid his &s;ubjects, on pain of death, to &s;ollicit in behalf of the duke of Hereford: That although he held his crown of God

and confirming laws, &s;tatutes, ordinances, and judgments, which were erro|neous, unju&s;t, and repugnant to all law and rea&s;on; and by this clau&s;e endea|voured to infringe the l$berty of &s;ucceeding parliaments: That although he had of his own accord &s;olemnly &s;worn upon the &s;acrament in the chapel of his ma|nor at Langley, that he would pardon the duke of Glouce&s;ter for all offences he was &s;aid to have committed again&s;t the king's per&s;on or government; yet afterwards, notwith&s;tanding that &s;olemn oath and obligation, he cau&s;ed the duke for tho&s;e very offences to be horribly and cruelly murdered, thereby ad|ding the guilt of perjury to murder: That he had earne&s;tly de&s;ired the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury to forbear an&s;wering the articles of his impeachment, and per&s;uaded him to remain quiet at his own hou&s;e, in full a&s;&s;urance that he &s;hould receive no lo&s;s and prejudice in his ab&s;ence; notwith&s;tanding which a&s;|&s;urance$ the archbi&s;hop was bani&s;hed and his e&s;tate confi&s;cated, contrary to all law and equity: That the king afterwards cajoled the archbi&s;hop with flatter|ing and fraudulent &s;peeches, laying the blame of his being bani&s;hed upon other per&s;ons, until he found means to per&s;uade the &s;aid prelate to tru&s;t him with the jewels belonging to his chapel, as a &s;acred depo&s;it, which he detained for his own u&s;e, and di&s;tributed among his favourites according to his plea&s;ure: That he promi&s;ed the archbi&s;hop's &s;entence &s;hould be rever&s;ed, and &s;wore upon the cro&s;s of St. Thomas the martyr, that he &s;hould not lo&s;e the archbi&s;ho$|ric; notwith&s;tanding which &s;acred and &s;olemn engagements, he expelled the archbi&s;hop from the kingdom, and wrote to the pope, de&s;iring his holine&s;s would tran&s;late him to &s;ome mean dioce&s;e in a foreign country. The&s;e articles being publicly read, the three e&s;tates unanimou&s;ly agreed that the&s;e offences, together with Richard's own confe&s;&s;ion and re&s;ignation, furni&s;hed them with &s;ufficient cau&s;e and authority to depo&s;e him, for the &s;ecurity and quiet of the people, and the advantage of the kingdom. They therefore appointed the bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, the abbot of Gla&s;tonbury, the earl of Glouce&s;ter, the lord Berkley, Thomas Erpyngham, and Thomas Grey, knights, and William Thyrning ju&s;tice, as commi&s;&s;ioners to pronounce &s;entence of depo&s;ition again&s;t king Richard from all royal dignity, maje&s;ty, and honour, in the name and by the authority of all the e&s;tates, as in like ca&s;es according to the ancient cu&s;|tom of the kingdom had been ob&s;erved. The &s;entence being drawn up by the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, was pronounced by the bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph; and the three e&s;tates con&s;tituted certain per&s;ons as their proctors and agents, to go and re&s;ign to king Richard the homage and fealty which they had formerly done and promi&s;ed, and to notify the &s;entence of his depo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The throne of England being thus vacated, Henry duke of La$|ca&s;ter ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, calling upon the name of Chri&s;t, and cro&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf on the forehead and brea&s;t, claimed the crown with all its members and appurtenances, as the li$eal de&s;cendant and right heir of blood from king Henry III. The three e&s;tates were a&s;ked &s;everally their opinions of this ridicu|lous claim, which they unanimou&s;ly admitted, con&s;enting that the duke of Lanca&s;ter &s;hould reign over them. Then the archbi&s;hop taking Henry by the right hand, led him to the royal throne, be$ore which he kneeled and prayed with marks of great devotion; after which the two metropolitans a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in a&s;cending the throne, on which he &s;eated him&s;elf amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury having harrangued, or ra$her
<PB N="210" REF="2120">
prea$hed to the people on this &s;ing$lar occa&s;ion, the new king, in an audible voice, thanked the lords &s;piritual and temporal and all the e&s;tates of the land, f$r their chearful concurrence in his elevation; and a&s;&s;ured them that he would not a&s;&s;ume the rights of a conqueror to alter the laws and cu&s;toms of the realm, or d$prive any man of his inheritan$e and privileges, excepting &s;uch as had op|p$$ed his endeavours for the common advantage of the kingdom. That the $dmini&s;tration of ju&s;tice might not be delayed, he forthwith named his principal officers and judges, who took the u&s;ual oaths; and proclamation was made that the parliament &s;hould meet on Monday after Michaelmas. The corona|$$on was fixed for the Monday next en&s;uing; then the king retired to White|hall, where the nobility and others were regaled with a &s;plendid entertainment. Next day the commi&s;&s;ioners vi&s;ited Richard in the Tower, who received their renunciation of homage and the news of his depo&s;ition with great fortitude, and even &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the thought of being di&s;encumbered o$ the burthen of royalty. He was in a little time removed to the ca&s;tle of Ledes in Kent, and from thence to Pontefract in York&s;hire, which was the la&s;t &s;tage of his mortal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro$. Parl. $word$ $$b$an.</NOTE> pilgrimage. Such was the conclu&s;ion of the inglorious reign of Richard II. a weak, vain, frivolous, and incon&s;tant prince; without weight to ballance the &s;cales of government; without di&s;cretion to chu&s;e a good mi$i&s;try; without virtue to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures and advice of evil coun&s;ellors, even when they happened to cla&s;h with his own principles and opinion. He was a dupe to flat|tery, and a $lave to o$tentation; and not more apt to give up his rea&s;on to the $$gge&s;t$ons of &s;ycophants and vitious mini&s;ters, than to &s;acrifice tho&s;e mini&s;ters to his own &s;afety. He was idle, profu&s;e, and profligate; and though brave by $tarts, naturally pu&s;illanimous and irre&s;olute. His pride and re&s;entment prompted him to cruelty and breach of faith; while his nece&s;&s;ities obliged him to fleece his people and degrade the dignity of his character and &s;tation. Though we find none of his charities on record, all hi&s;torians agree that he ex|celled all his predece&s;&s;ors in &s;tate and ho&s;pitality, and fed a thou&s;and mouths every day from his kitchen. Notwith&s;tanding his di&s;&s;olute life, he never was accu&s;ed of incontinence; and though left a widower in the prime of his youth, was never known to be engaged in any particular amour that produced ille|gitimate i&s;&s;ue. Perhaps his want of children was owing to &s;ome natural frigidity of con&s;titution; for $e had no i&s;&s;ue by his fi$&s;t queen Anne, daughter of Charles IV. emperor of Germany, who was an amiable prince&s;s, with whom he lived twelve years in all the comfort of happy wedlock: as for his &s;econd wife I&s;abella elde&s;t daughter of Charles VI. king of France, her nuptials with him were never actually con$$mmated; for &s;he was but ju&s;t turned of ten years of age when he was treacherou&s;ly murdered.</P>

<P>DURING the interval between the parliament which depo&s;ed Ri|chard, and that which was convoked by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, this prince filled $ome places that were either vacant, or occupied by per&s;ons who were not agreeable to his inclinations and de&s;igns. The $arl of Northumberland was

created high con&s;table; and the dig$ity of earl mare$chal conferred upon Ralph N$v$l earl of We$tmoreland. In a few days after this promotion, he be&s;towed the I$$e of Man upon the former of the&s;e noblemen, with the privilege of ca$|r$i$g at the c$ronation the $word of Lanca&s;ter, which was the very indivi$$al w$$p$$ he w$$e w$$n he landed $t Raven&s;pur.

Henry &s;$ems<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$t$ Pub.</NOTE> to have made his religion &s;ub&s;ervient to his intere&s;t. We have &s;een how he $a&s;|cinated the eyes of the people with public $cts of devotion in St. Paul's church, when he brought $is &s;overeign a pri&s;oner to London, as well as at his u&s;urpation in We&s;tmin&s;ter$Hall; and now to carry on t$e &s;ame &s;uper&s;titious mummery, in which he found his account, he re&s;olved to be a$ointed at his coronation, with a certain oil &s;aid to have been pre&s;ented by the Virgin Mary to Thomas Becket during his exile. The phial that contained this precious balm had fallen into the hands of a$ hermit, who gave it to Henry duke of Lanca&s;ter grand&s;on of Henry III. a&s;&s;uring him, that all the kings anointed with that oil would become the true champions of the church. The duke made a pre&s;ent of it to Edward the Black Prince, who intended to be anointed with it, had he lived to his co|ronation: but after his death the phial, which was of &s;tone &s;$rmounted by a golden eagle adorned with precious &s;tones, &s;tood for &s;ome time unheeded among his jewels until the latter part of his reig$, immediately before his la&s;t expedition to Ireland, when he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of being crowned a &s;econd time, that he might have the benefit of unction from this &s;acred ve&s;&s;el; but he was diverted from his purpo&s;e by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who told him, that the unction of kings ought not to be repeated. At length the phial being &s;eized by Henry among the other jewels of Richard, he &s;eemed to rejoice at the thought of his being the fir&s;t king con&s;ecrated from &s;uch a miraculous pitcher. He was crowned with all the u&s;ual formalities on the thirteenth day o$ October, being the fea&s;t of St. Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, in the thirty-third year of his age; and on that &s;ame day i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, declaring that he had a&s;cended the thro$e by the right o$ conque&s;t, the re&s;ignation of Richard in his favour, and as next heir male of the late ki$g. Thus he excluded the only t$tle of which he ought to have availed him&s;elf, namely, the con&s;ent of the peo|ple; and trumped up an hereditary claim than which nothing could be more $b&s;urd during the life of Edmund Mortimer$ who yielded to the torrent of La$ca&s;ter's fortune, and retired to his e&s;tate of Wigm$r on the Wel&s;h Marches, where he lived privately, without expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t de&s;ire of oppo&s;ition to the new government; for he knew the character of the u$urper, and cautiou&s;ly avoided ever$ &s;tep which could po&s;&s;ibly wake his &s;$&s;picion. He$ry's procla|mation was not $o much calculated to impo&s;e upon the people, by means of a pretended right of &s;$cce&s;&s;$on, as to caution them again&s;t all me$&s;ures for re&s;trict|ing his authority$ which they might have been apt to concert in the &s;equel, on $he &s;$ppo&s;it$on, t$at they had a right to limit the prerogative which was founded on their election, where$s they now plainly pe$ce$ved from his declaration$
<PB N="213" REF="2150">
that he a$rogated to him&s;elf the united rights of blood and conque&s;t, that he might reign without controul. On the &s;ame day that his proclamation was pub|li&s;hed, he created his elde&s;t &s;on Henry, at that time in the thirteenth year of his age, duke of Cornwal, prince of Wales, and earl of Che&s;ter; and on the morrow the parliament a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was to pa&s;s an act of indemnity, in fa|vour of tho&s;e who had taken up arms for the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter in the late troubles. Then they repealed all the &s;tatutes of the two la&s;t parliaments con|voked by Richard, touching the condemnation of the three noblemen, and the exce&s;&s;ive prerogatives which they had granted to the king, &s;o contrary to the liberties of the &s;ubject. At the &s;ame time they renewed and confirmed the &s;ta|tut$s which the parliament of Shrew&s;bury had repealed. They enacted a law again&s;t the pope's bull, which Richard had &s;ollicited and obtained to enforce and confirm the proceedings of his parliament. As this was in effect an ac|knowledgment of the pope's &s;overeignty over England, the commons declared in this act, that the kingdom of England was independent of all foreign power; and that the pope in particular, had no right to intermeddle in the civil govern|ment of the kingdom. The parliament at Shrew&s;bury, having extended the crime of trea&s;on to &s;o many ca&s;es that every per&s;on mu&s;t have been guilty, ex|cept tho&s;e who acknowledged an unlimited authority in the &s;overeign, that &s;ta|tute was now repealed; and the crime of trea&s;on reduced to tho&s;e ca&s;es which were &s;pecified in a law enacted in the reign of Edward III. on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject. The rights and privileges of the people being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, the par|liament proceeded again&s;$ the evil coun&s;ellors, who advi&s;ed all the exce&s;&s;es which Richard had committed in the latter part of his admini&s;tration; and this inquiry produced &s;uch violent di&s;putes as had well nigh terminated in &s;laughter. The lord Fitzwalter challenged Aumerle as a traitor to king Richard; and the lord Morley taxed the earl of Sali&s;bury with having betrayed both Richard and Henry. Other noblemen e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of tho&s;e di&s;putants, forty gaunt|lets were thrown down in the hou&s;e of lords, by individuals who defied each other to &s;ingle combat; &s;o that Henry was obliged to interpo&s;e and compro|mi&s;e their differences. The &s;entence again&s;t the earls of Arundel and War|wick was repealed, as unju&s;t and contrary to the pardon they had fo$merly obt$ined: and their accu&s;ers were deprived of their new titles, as well as of the lands of tho&s;e noblemen which had been di&s;tributed among them; but their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were left to the king's di&s;po&s;al. Henry, re&s;olving to begin his reign with acts of clemency, allowed them to enjoy their own fortunes; though the dukes of Aumerle, Surrey, and Exeter, were now reduced to their former titles of the earls of Rutland, Kent, and Huntingdon; and the earl of Glou|ce&s;ter was compelled to re&s;ign that title for his former appellation of lord D'E&s;|pen&s;er. Sali&s;bury and Morley, who had been principally concerned in the mur|der of the duke of Glouce&s;ter, and in all the arbitrary mea&s;ures of Richard, re|ceived no other puni&s;hment than that of a &s;hort impri&s;onment; though the peo|ple demanded with loud clamour, that they &s;hould be put to death as traitors to their country. The&s;e noblemen alledged, in their own excu&s;e, that they had ac$$d under Richard upon compul&s;ion; and therefore the parliament in a n$w &s;$$t$te, declared, that for the future &s;uch compul&s;ion &s;hould be deemed no excu&s;e $or illegal actions. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the hou&s;$ of

This was $$omas Merks b$$hop of Carlile, who, in a public harrangue, affirmed, and undertook to prove, that there was no authority upon earth which could l$w$ully depo&s;e a ki$g of England: that the crimes imputed to Richard did not d$&s;$$ve &s;uch puni&s;hment, and be&s;ides, were not pr$ved; and that the crown had been unju&s;tly adjudged to the duke of Lanca&s;ter. The bi&s;hop's intention was to convince the parliament of their erroneous conduct, and en|c$$rage the friends of Richard to &s;peak their &s;entiments; but his &s;peech pro|du$ed neit$er of the&s;e effects, and happened to be &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable, that he was immedi$tely arr$&s;ted, and &s;ent pri&s;oner to the abbey of St. Alban's, from whence, however, he was &s;oon relea&s;ed.

The affairs of the nation being &s;ettled in this parliament, to the &s;ati&s;|faction of Henry and the people of England, he di&s;&s;olved that a&s;&s;embly, and converted his attention to foreign affairs.

This pri$ce being intere&s;ted in the cau&s;e of Richard, who was his &s;$n-in-law, the amba&s;&s;adors met with a very cold reception; but, as they had i$&s;tr$$tions to behave with moderation, and $$erlook little &s;lights or marks of re&s;entment, they re&s;olved to wa$t patiently until the fir&s;t fi$e of the French<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ P$b.</NOTE> court's indign$tion &s;hould be exhau&s;ted.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to the other &s;ov$reigns of the continent, Henry found no difficulty in reconciling them to his elevation. The emperor Wince&s;laus was a be$o$ted prince, who took no co$cern in the affairs of his neighbours; and the kings o$ Ca&s;tile and Portugal were gainers by a revolution that pro|moted their brother-in-law to the crown of England. This was not the ca&s;e with the Ga&s;cons, who deplored the misfortunes of a prince whom they loved as the &s;on of the val$ant Edward, and &s;till more as their own countryman; for Ri$hard was born at Bourdeaux, the citizens of which re&s;ented his depo&s;ition &s;o highly, as to threaten openly to &s;$bmit to the king of France, rather than obey the u$urp$r. The re&s;t of the province was influenced by the example of this gr$$t city; and the whole dutchy o$ Guien$e was on the point of revolting. The

court of France, re&s;olving to make her advantage of this conjuncture, &s;ent thither the duke of Bourbon to foment the di&s;affection and di&s;gu&s;t of the Ga&s;cons; &s;o that all the di&s;cretion of Sir Robert Knolles the governor was re|quired to repre&s;s the &s;pirit of rebellion. Perhaps his endeavours would have proved ineffectual, had not the earl of Worce&s;ter, one of the amba&s;&s;adors at Paris, ha&s;tened to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance at Bourdeaux, and co-operated with him &s;o effectually, that the commotions were appea&s;ed. The&s;e two were rein|forced by the intere&s;t and influence of the archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux, who acknowledged the Roman pontiff Boniface; and fore&s;aw that, if Guienne &s;hould fall under the French dominion, he would be obliged to &s;ubmit to Benedict, who re&s;ided at Avignon, and was patronized by the French monarch. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Froi&s;&s;art.</NOTE></P>

<P>The&s;e troubles were &s;carce pacified, when Henry found him&s;elf ex|po&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of his neighbours. Robert III. king of Scotland, taking it for granted that this revolution in England mu&s;t be attended with dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and that the king of France would not fail to exert him|&s;elf in favour of his &s;on-in-law Richard, thought he could not find a more fa|vourable juncture for invading the northern provinces, which he ravaged accordingly, and took the ca&s;tle of Werk in Northumberland. Henry, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to avoid foreign quarrels, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Scotland, to demand reparation for this in&s;ult, and, at the &s;ame time, to propo&s;e a renewal of the truce; to which Robert the more readily a&s;&s;ented, as he perceived the French king took no &s;tep to the prejudice of the u&s;urper. The difference with Scotland being compromi&s;ed, Henry neglected no opportunity to recommend him&s;elf to the affections of his people: he upon all occa&s;ions expre&s;&s;ed the ut|mo&s;t horror at the arbitrary proceedings of his predece&s;&s;or; affected to con&s;ult the intere&s;ts of his &s;ubjects preferably to his own; and, as a convincing proof of his &s;incerity, condemned to the flames all the blank bonds which Richard had extorted from the citizens of London, and the &s;eventeen counties which had fallen under his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e popular mea&s;ures, he had well nigh fallen a &s;acrifice to a dangerous con&s;piracy, formed by the noblemen who had &s;uffered from his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The plan is &s;aid to have been projected by the abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter, who&s;e hou&s;e was the place of rendezvous for the con&s;pirators. The&s;e were the dukes of Aumerle, Surrey, and Exeter, the earls of Glouce&s;ter and Sali&s;bury, the bi&s;hop of Carlile, and Sir Thomas Blount; and they engaged as their tool one Maudlin, who had been chaplain to Richard, and re&s;embled that prince &s;o eactly in his lineaments and per&s;on, that they thought they could ea&s;ily impo&s;e him upon the people for that mo|narch. They re&s;olved to in&s;titute a tournament at Oxford; and the duke of Aumerle, who enjoyed a good &s;hare of Henry's con&s;idence, undertook to in|vite him to that diver&s;ion, when it would be in their power to &s;eize or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nate his per&s;on. The particulars of the &s;cheme were committed to writing, and each con&s;pirator was provided with a copy, &s;igned and &s;ealed by his con|federates. The tournament being proclaimed by the duke of Exeter and the earl of Sali&s;bury, all the con&s;pirators repaired to Oxford, with numerous re|tinues, on pretence of curio&s;ity; except the duke of Aume$le, whom they expected in vain. That nobleman, chancing to vi&s;it his father the duke of
<PB N="216" REF="2180">
York at Langley, was detected by his parents; who, while he &s;at at dinner, perceived a paper in his bo&s;om: when York que&s;tioned him about the con|tents, his countenance betrayed &s;uch contu&s;ion, that his father's &s;u&s;picion was alarmed; he &s;natched the paper, and, peru&s;ing the &s;cheme, ordered his hor&s;es to be &s;addled with the utmo&s;t expedition. Aumerle, gue&s;&s;ing his intention, mounted his hor&s;e, and riding full &s;peed to the king at Wind&s;or, di&s;covered the whole con&s;piracy, and obtained his pardon before the arrival of his father, who produced the paper, &s;igned and &s;ealed by the other con&s;pirators. Henry, alarmed at this intelligence, laid a&s;ide his de&s;ign of going to Oxford, and continued at Wind&s;or until he &s;hould &s;ee what &s;teps the confederates would take in con&s;equence of their di&s;appointment. When they under&s;tood that the dukes of York and Aumerle had vi&s;ited the king at Wind&s;or, they no longer doubted but that their &s;cheme was di&s;covered$ and re&s;olved to execute imme|diately by force what they could not accompli&s;h by &s;tratagem. They forth|with produced Maudlin in royal attire; affirming and publi&s;hing that he was Richard e&s;caped from pri&s;on, and come to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his loving &s;ubjects. By this time the fate of that unhappy prince had wrought upon the compa&s;&s;ion of the people. They forgot all his vices, remembered his birth, his comely appearance, his former magnificence, and his pre&s;ent misfortune. They flocked to his &s;tandard in &s;uch crouds, that the lords of the con&s;piracy found them&s;elves in a few days at the head of a numerous army, with which they began their march to Wind&s;or, where they hoped to take the king by &s;urprize. Henry had retired, during the preceding night, to London, where he a&s;&s;embled a body of twenty thou&s;and men, and marched back as far as Houn&s;low-Heath, in order to give battle to the rebels, &s;hould they take the route to the capital.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The chiefs took up their quarters in the city; the duke of Surrey and earl of Sali&s;bury lodging at one public inn, while the duke of Exeter and the earl of Glouce&s;ter lay at another: but they were &s;o carele&s;s, or unexperienced in war, that they neglected to place proper guards at the gates and avenues of the town. The mayor of the place, ob&s;erving this neg|ligence, a&s;&s;embled four hundred men in the night; and, &s;ecuring the gates, &s;o as to exclude the troops that were encamped without the walls, attacked the four noblemen in their quarters. The duke of Surrey and earl of Sali&s;|bury were taken, after an ob&s;tinate defence, and beheaded on the &s;pot by the mayor's order; while the duke of Exeter and the earl of Glouce&s;ter e&s;caped by the tops of hou&s;es, and repaired to the camp, with a view to &s;torm the town at the head of their forces; but they found the tents and baggage aban|doned by the &s;oldiers, who, hearing the noi&s;e and tumult of fighting within the town, concluded that a detachment of the king's army had entered the place, and on that &s;uppo&s;ition fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation. The two noblemen took leave of each other, that they might have the better chance of e&s;caping &s;ingle; but they were apprehended, and lo&s;t their heads in the &s;equel. Henry, advancing to Cirence&s;ter, found the rebels already di&s;|per&s;ed, and did not fail to reward the mayor and inhabitants for their valour

and fidelity. From thence he proceeded to Oxford, where Sir Thomas Blount and Sir Benedict Sely, with &s;ix and twenty per&s;ons who had followed the duke of Exeter, were executed: and about the &s;ame time the earl of Glou|ce&s;ter and the lord Lumley, who had been al&s;o concerned in the con&s;piracy, were beheaded by the populace at Bri&s;tol. Maudlin, and another clergyman, called William Feriby, together with Sir Bernard Brocas and Sir John Scheveley, were executed at Tyburn. The duke of Exeter was taken at Prittlewell, and beheaded at Ple&s;hy in E&s;&s;ex, without any form of proce&s;s, although he had married Henry's own &s;i&s;ter. Roger Walden late archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and Thomas Merks bi&s;hop of Carlile, were committed to the Tower, on &s;u&s;picion of having privately a&s;&s;i&s;ted the con&s;pirators: the fir&s;t was &s;oon relea&s;ed, and promoted to the &s;ee of London; but Merks was brought to his trial, and convicted of trea&s;on. He was remanded to the Tower, where he remained above twelve months; then he was removed to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, and afterwards obtained the king's pardon, though he was deprived of his bi&s;hopric, and died rector of Todenham in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire. The abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter, who had taken the field with the con&s;pirators, was &s;o terrified at the rout and di&s;per&s;ion of their troops, in the neighbour|hood of Cirence&s;ter, that he fell into an apoplectic $it, of which he never<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer$ Hall.

<P>In all probability, this di&s;turbance ha&s;tened the fate of the unfortu|nate Richard. Henry could plainly perceive that the impri&s;oned king did not want parti&s;ans who favoured his cau&s;e, both from affection to his per&s;on, and di&s;gu&s;t to Bolingbroke, by whom they had been deceived in the motives of his inva&s;ion: he therefore concluded, that his royalty would be expo&s;ed to the attempts of malecontents while Richard was alive; and mea&s;ures were taken for depriving that wretched captive of his life. The manner of his death is variou&s;ly related. The adherents of Henry gave out that he &s;tarved him&s;elf to death, from grief and vexation at the mi&s;carriage and fate of his friends. Others alledge that he was doomed to this lingering de&s;tiny by the private direction of Henry. But the generally received opinion is, that he was murdered by Sir Piers de Exton, in the following manner: This knight, hearing Henry complain that he had no fears nor apprehen&s;ions but from one quarter, to di&s;turb him in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, interpreted the hint according to his own conjecture, and repaired to Pontefract, with eight fol|lowers, to perpetrate the execrable &s;cheme he had projected. Richard per|ceiving that, while he &s;at at dinner, his victuals were not ta&s;ted according to cu&s;tom, demanded the cau&s;e of this omi&s;&s;ion; and the ta&s;ter telling him, that the king had &s;ent an order to de&s;i&s;t from that ceremony, Richard &s;truck him on the face with a knife, exclaiming, "The devil take Harry of Lanca&s;ter "and thee together." Exton, hearing the noi&s;e occa&s;ioned by this fray, ru&s;hed into the room with eight followers in arms; and the king, concluding their de&s;ign was to take away his life, re&s;olved to $ell it as dearly as he could. He wre&s;ted a pole-axe from one of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and defended him&s;elf &s;o man|fully, as to lay four of the number dead at his feet; when the treacherous Exton came behind his back, and with his battle-axe felled him to the ground. Had the tragedy been really acted in this manner, the marks of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>
<PB N="218" REF="2200">
violence would have certainly appeared in the dead body, which was brought to London, and publicly expo&s;ed in St. Paul's church to the eyes and in&s;pec|tion of every ob&s;erver. It &s;eems more likely, therefore, that he peri&s;hed by famine; e&s;pecially as the archbi&s;hop of York, with the earls of Northumber|land and Worce&s;ter, when they afterwards revolted again&s;t Henry, affirmed in their manif$$to, that he was &s;tarved, by being kept fifteen days without &s;u&s;tenance. Thus died the unfortunate Richard, in the thirty-third year of his age; and his fate excited pity and regret in every compa&s;&s;ionate bo&s;om. He was buried at Langley in Hertford&s;hire; but his body was afterwards re|moved by Henry V. to We&s;tmin&s;ter, and interred with great &s;olemnity among his ance&s;tors. The death of Richard, how&s;oever procured, was very &s;ea&s;onable for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Charles of France had made great preparations for invading England, in order to re&s;tore his &s;on-in law to the throne; and Henry was &s;o alarmed at the importance of the armament, that, be&s;ides the u&s;ual precautions taken for the defence of the kingdom, he ordered archbi&s;hop Arundel to arm and array all the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of his province, that they might be ready to take the field on the fir&s;t notice. Perhaps tho&s;e preparations of France abridged the days of Richard. His death was no &s;ooner known at the French court, than all thoughts of an inva&s;ion were laid a&s;ide: a truce for eight and twenty years was concluded between the two crowns; and it was agreed that queen I&s;abel, who&s;e marriage had never been con&s;ummated, &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ H$$$. de Charl. $word$</NOTE> return to her own country.</P>

<P>Henry's accommodation with France &s;eems to have rendered him le&s;s &s;crupulous in maintaining a good under&s;tanding with Scotland. George Dunbar earl of Marche thinking him&s;elf outraged by his &s;overeign, in the ca&s;e of a match which had been contracted between his daughter and David prince of Scotland, abandoned his own country, and retired to England; from whence he made incur&s;ions into Lothian, in conjunction with Henry Pier$y, &s;urnamed Hot&s;pur. Robert the Scotti&s;h king &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Henry, demanding that the traitor might be &s;urrendered to ju&s;tice; and, the Engli&s;h monarch refu&s;ing this &s;atisfaction, Robert declared war again&s;t him, and began to prepare for an inva&s;ion. Henry re&s;olved to anticipate his ope|rations; and, having obtained a &s;upply from the lords &s;piritual and temporal, a&s;&s;embled in council, levied an army, which rendezvou&s;ed at Newca&s;tle: from thence he &s;ent an herald to &s;ummon the Scotti&s;h king to meet him at Edinburgh, on the twenty-third day of Augu&s;t, in order to do homage for his kingdom; and immediately began his march for that city, at which he ar|rived without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. He forthwith inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle, which was &s;o vigorou&s;ly defended by the earl of Douglas and his &s;on-in-law David prince of Scotland, that very little progre&s;s was made in the &s;iege; when Henry thought proper to abandon the enterprize, and return to his own do|minions. Thither he was followed by two bodies of Scots, commanded by Hepburn and Haliburton, who fell upon the northern counties, and cruelly revenged the ravages which the Engli&s;h had committed in Scotland; though Hepburn was defeated and &s;lain in his return from this expedition. The i&s;&s;ue of this incur&s;ion di&s;po&s;ed the Scots to agree to the propo&s;al of a truce for &s;ix weeks; which was afterwards prolonged according to the emergency of Henry's affairs.</P>

<P>His abrupt retreat from Scotland was not &s;o much owing to the ad|vanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, as to the news of an in&s;urrection in Wales, headed by Owen Glendourdwy, commonly called Glendower. This gentleman had been educated as a lawyer at the inns of court, and afterwards &s;erved Richard II. as one of his body e&s;quires. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable e&s;tate in Wales; and was de&s;cended by his mother from Llewellyn ap Griffith, the la&s;t prince of that country. He conceived him&s;elf injured in the i&s;&s;ue of a law-&s;uit with Reginald lord Grey of Ruthyn, and did him&s;elf ju&s;tice by force of arms. Re|ginald complaining of this violence to the king, with whom he was in high favour, Henry &s;ent the lord Talbot, with a reinforcement to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and they fell upon Owen &s;o unexpectedly, that he had &s;carce time to retreat to the woods and mountains. Finding that his di&s;pute with lord Grey was no longer con&s;idered as a private quarrel, he endeavoured to intere&s;t his country|men in his behalf; and, by dint of eloquence, in&s;inuation, and family-in|fluence, per&s;uaded them not only to renounce their dependence upon England, but al&s;o to declare him their prince and &s;overeign, as the lineal de&s;cendant from Llewellyn ap Griffith. Then, a&s;&s;embling a body of &s;tout Wel&s;hmen, he attacked the town of Ruthyn, which he plundered and reduced to a&s;hes. He afterwards gave battle to that nobleman, on the banks of the river Vurn|way in Montgomery&s;hire, where Reginald was defeated, taken pri&s;oner, and compelled to marry the daughter of Glendourdwy. Emboldened by this &s;ucce&s;s, Owen made an irruption into the county of Hereford; and Edmund Mortimer, thinking this was a favourable opportunity to acquire the favour of Henry, rai&s;ed a body of twelve thou&s;and men to &s;top the progre&s;s of this Wel&s;h invader. The two armies meeting at Pitleth in Radnor&s;hire, a de&s;pe|rate engagement en&s;ued: the Engli&s;h were totally routed, after having lo&s;t eleven hundred men killed on the field of battle; and Mortimer him&s;elf was taken pri&s;oner. Owen refu&s;ed to admit him to ran&s;om, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, that a per&s;on of his con&s;equence would be redeemed by a formal negotiation; in which ca&s;e he would have an opportunity of treating with Henry as an in|dependent prince: but he was mi&s;taken in his conjecture. Henry was too well plea&s;ed with the captivity of the true heir of the crown, to contribute to his relea&s;e; and Owen, perceiving his drift, thought proper to alter his &s;cheme, and project an alliance with his pri&s;oner. Mean while he advanced to the &s;ide of the Severn, and ravaged the country without oppo&s;ition. The&s;e events,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian.

He was entertained with great magnifi|cence, and received &s;everal rich pre&s;ents: but Henry would not pretend to oblige him with &s;uccours, until the affairs of his own kingdom &s;hould be better e&s;tabli&s;hed.

The &s;ect of Lollards daily increa&s;ing, it was provided that none &s;hould preach without a licence from the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e; and as to tho&s;e who either refu&s;ed to abjure their here&s;y, or relap&s;ed after abjura|$on, it was enacted that, upon a certificate from the dioce&s;an bi&s;hop, or his commi&s;&s;aries, delivering them over to the &s;ecular arm, the civil magi&s;trate &s;hould receive their bodies, and cau&s;e them to be burned in public.

The penalties in the &s;tatute of pro|vi&s;ors were now extended to &s;uch as procured bulls from the pope, either ex|empting them from obedience to their ordinary, or qualifying them to hold pluralities, or di&s;pen&s;ing with them for not re&s;iding on their benefices.

<P>Since the confirmation of the truce with France, Charles VI. or rather his brother the duke of Orleans, and his uncles of Berry and Burgundy, who governed the kingdom of France in his name, had often reclaimed the young queen I&s;abel, widow of Richard II. and Henry had artfully eluded a categorical an&s;wer on that &s;ubject. Being extremely de&s;irous of effecting a match between that prince&s;s and his elde&s;t &s;on, he propo&s;ed that alliance to the French admini&s;tration, by whom it was rejected, on pretence that the king was not in a condition to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation; and that this was an affair of too great con&s;equence to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed without his know|ledge and participation.

Then he repaired with a very &s;mall body of troops to the hills of Plimlymmon, which he had ap|pointed for the rendezvous of his forces, and from thence &s;ent out detachments $o ravage the county of Pembroke, and the neighbourhood of Cardigan, in|habited by the de&s;cendents of tho&s;e Flemi&s;h and Engli&s;h families who had for|merly &s;ettled in that country: the&s;e a&s;&s;embling to the number of fifteen hundred, &s;urrounded him &s;o &s;uddenly in one of his incur&s;ions, that he mu&s;t have been taken, had not he and his men made a de&s;perate effort of courage, and attacked the enemy with &s;uch fury that they were entirely routed. This victory was a great addition to the reputation of Owen, who&s;e countrymen began to look upon him as the per&s;on de&s;tined to re&s;tore their former indepen|dency, and flocked to his banner from all quarters. Henry, alarmed at his &s;ucce&s;s, invaded Wales again in October, when Owen retiring as before to his fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, nothing of con&s;equence was tran&s;acted, and the king marched back to London, extremely di&s;gu$ted at the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his undertaking. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>He was in &s;ome mea&s;ure con&s;oled for the&s;e dome&s;tic troubles, by the alliances which he contracted on the continent. The duke of Gueldres renewed his league with England, which had been formed under the preceding reign; and Henry's elde&s;t daughter Blanche was married to Lewis duke of Bavaria, elde&s;t &s;on of Rupert the German emperor. Next year &s;he was con|ducted into Germany, with a fortune of twenty thou&s;and marks, which was levied by an aid of twenty &s;hillings for a knight's fee, or twenty pounds a year in lands held immediately of the crown. This aid was rai&s;ed, by virtue of the royal prerogative, throughout the whole kingdom. Another treaty of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1402.</NOTE> mar|riage was &s;et on foot between Henry's daughter Philippa, and Eric king of Denmark, who married the prince&s;s accordingly; though a match which had been projected between the Dane's &s;i&s;ter Catherine, and Henry prince of Wales, did not &s;ucceed. Henry him&s;elf had for &s;ome time made his addre&s;&s;es to Jane of Navarre, widow of John IV. duke of Brittany, who privately ob|tained from the Avignon pope Benedict, two di&s;pen&s;ations, without which thi$ marriage could not have taken effect. One permitted her to marry a relation, in the third or fourth degree of con&s;anguinity; and by the other &s;he was al|lowed to communicate with &s;uch as payed canonical obedience to pope Boni|face, who was acknowledged in England. The duche&s;s, thus ea&s;ed of her &s;cruples, &s;ent over Anthony Ro&s;e as her proxy, and was contracted to Henry at Eltham: but before &s;he could come in per&s;on, the nobility of Bretagne received intimation of her de&s;ign, and being apprehen&s;ive of her carrying the young duke with her to England, obliged her to deliver him up to Philip duke of Burgundy, his neare&s;t relation. That nobleman, with the con&s;ent of the &s;tates, took upon him the tuition of her children, with the government of the country, and conveyed the young duke to Paris for his education. His mother &s;etting $ail from Brittany, under the conduct of the earl of Worce&s;ter, landed after a dangerous pa&s;&s;age at Falmouth, from whence &s;he proceeded to Winche&s;ter, where the nuptials were &s;olemnized; and &s;he was afterwards crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>It was at this period that Henry received the intelligence of Glen|do$r$wy's &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t lord Grey and Mortimer; and though he &s;ecretly rejo$ced at Edmund's captivity, he intere&s;ted him&s;elf deeply for his favourite Grey, and a&s;&s;embled another large army to take vengeance on the conqueror. The rendezvo$s of his $orces was at Shrew&s;bury, where he divided them into three b$dies, giving the command of one to the prince of Wales, and of an|other to the earl of Arundel, while the third marched under his own au&s;pices. The&s;e divi&s;ions entered Wales at three different places, in order to &s;urround Glendourdwy, who had retired to the mountains of Snowdun. But they met with &s;uch tempe&s;tuous weather, that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to keep the field, and they were obliged to retire without having performed any military exploit. Henry was extremely mortified at three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mi&s;carriages; and is &s;aid to have employed treacherous means to take away the life of Glendourdwy, who baffled all his de&s;igns of per$idy as well as open war, and acquired the reputa|tion of a magician among the Engli&s;h people, who &s;uppo&s;ed he had made a compact with the devil. This bold Briton at length agreed $o treat with the lord Grey for his ran&s;om, which was fixed at ten thou&s;and marks; and &s;ecurity being given for the payment, Reginald was relea&s;ed; though he found it con|venient to marry Owen's daughter Jane, that he and his tenants might enjoy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> their e&s;tates in quiet.</P>

<P>The king's ill &s;ucce&s;s in Wales was recompen&s;ed by the fortune of his arms in the north of England. Archibald earl of Douglas, with the flower of the Scotti&s;h nobility, made an irruption into the Engli&s;h Marches, at the head of thirteen thou&s;and men, and ravaged the country for &s;ome time without oppo&s;ition; but on their return to Scotland, they found them&s;elves intercepted by a &s;trong body of Engli&s;h troops, commanded by the earl of Northumberland, his &s;on Henry Hot&s;pur, George earl of Dunbar, who was a refugee in England, and the lord Grey&s;toke. The two armies engaged each other at Holmedon-hill, near Wallover, on the borders of Northum|berland towards Scotland; but victory did not long hover in &s;u&s;pence. The Scots were drawn up on the declivity of the hill, &s;o as to &s;tand quite expo&s;ed to the arrows of the Engli&s;h archers, who plied them &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that no armour could re&s;i&s;t the force of their mi&s;&s;iles. Douglas perceiving their advantage, or|dered his men at arms to advance and attack the Engli&s;h bowmen, who retired as they approached, &s;till letting fly their arrows, until that body of Scots was fatigued with the weight of their armour, and the re&s;t of their army left ex|po&s;ed to the Engli&s;h archery, which made &s;uch havock among them, that they could no longer &s;tand the &s;hock, but fled with great precipitation. In this battle, which was fought on Holyrood-day, &s;even hundred Scots were left dead upon the field of battle, be&s;ides a great number that peri&s;hed in the Tweed. The earl of Douglas, who was dangerou&s;ly wounded, and lo&s;t an eye in the engagement, was taken pri&s;oner, together with Mordack earl of Fi$e, &s;on to the duke of Albany; the earls of Murray, Angus, and Orkney, the lords Montgomery and Erskine, and about four&s;core knights of di&s;tinc|tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$al$$$gham.</NOTE> Henry having received advice of this victory, &s;ent orders to the victors forbidding them to ran&s;om their pri&s;oners; declaring at the &s;ame time, that he did not mean to deprive them of their right, but de&s;ired the captives might not be di&s;po&s;ed of without his directions.</P>

<P>The parliament being a&s;&s;embled on the thirtieth day of Septem|ber at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the pri&s;oners were pre&s;ented to both hou&s;es, who thanked the earl of Northumberland for his &s;ervices. But it was not without re|luctance that they granted a continuation of the &s;ub&s;idy on wool and leather, the tonnage on wines, the poundage on merchandi&s;e, and a tenth and fifteenth, tho' on condition that they &s;hould not be drawn into a precedent. The clergy in this &s;e&s;&s;ion obtained a confirmation of all their privileges, particularly that which exempted them from pro&s;ecutions in the king's courts for felonies, ex|cept &s;uch as touched his per&s;on, crown, and royal dignity. By this time a dangerous &s;pirit of di&s;affection was diffu&s;ed throughout the whole kingdom, by tho&s;e who regreted and re&s;ented the depo&s;ition and murder of Richard. A report was indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated all over England, that the late king was &s;till alive, and had levied an army in Scotland, in order to expel the u&s;urper. Pa|pers were affixed to the church-doors, and in other public places, containing invectives again&s;t Henry, and affirming that the faults for which Richard had been depo&s;ed were trifles in compari&s;on with the tyranny which Bolingbroke had exerci&s;ed &s;ince his u&s;urpation. Henry was &s;o exa&s;perated at the&s;e &s;arca&s;ms, that he &s;wore he would never pardon any per&s;on who &s;hould be convicted of having offered them to the public. Sir Roger Clarendon, natural &s;on of the Black Prince, was apprehended on &s;u&s;picion of being concerned in a plot again&s;t the government, with the prie&s;t of Ware, the prior of Lawne, and nine other Franci&s;can friars, who were hanged at Tyburn without any formal conviction.

<P>In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, the Bretons being now entirely in|fluenced by French coun&s;els, committed depredations upon the coa&s;t of Eng|land; and the Engli&s;h deputies, at the congre&s;s at Lelinghen, complained of this violation of the truce. The French amba&s;&s;adors alledged that the Engli&s;h had been the aggre&s;&s;ors: but, as a rupture was deemed equally incon|venient by both &s;ides, they waved all punctilios, and the truce was again confirmed. This affair being amicably terminated, the French amba&s;&s;adors demanded the re&s;titution of I&s;abel's dower; and the Engli&s;h replied, that they did not doubt but their ma&s;ter, with a view to maintain a good under&s;tand|ing between the two crowns, would be content to deduct that &s;um from the million and a half of crowns &s;till due for the ran&s;om of king John. The plenipotentiaries of France were not a little &s;urprized at this declaration, which they declined an&s;wering, until they &s;hould have received farther in&s;tructions. But, while the court of England was engro&s;&s;ed with fea&s;ting and rejoicings on account of the king's marriage, the French made a de&s;cent upon the i&s;le of Wight, under the conduct of Valeran, count de St. Pol of the hou&s;e of Lux|embourg, who had married an uterine &s;i&s;ter of Richard II. and now pretended, in his own name, to revenge the death of his brother-in-law. The court of France connived at his de&s;ign, and even furni&s;hed him with troops for the en|terprize, which, however, did not &s;ucceeed according to his expectation; for, after having plundered &s;ome villages, he was &s;hamefully repul&s;ed to his &s;hips by the inhabitants, without any military reinforcement. Henry complained of this inva&s;ion to the court of France, from which he could extract no other.

reply, but that the king's intention was to ob&s;erve the truce, which was again confirmed; and the king of England put up with the affront, rather than in|volve him&s;elf in a foreign war, while &s;uch di&s;contents prevailed within his own kingdom. The mini&s;try of Charles were not ignorant of Henry's &s;itua|tion and &s;entiments; and, as they hated his per&s;on, they took no pains to<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> di&s;&s;emble their aver&s;ion. The duke of Orleans, as champion for Richard's memory, challenged him to &s;ingle combat, at the head of an hundred knights: but Henry rejected his defiance, as coming from an inferior, telling him at the &s;ame time, that they might chance to meet in battle, where they would have an opportunity of mea&s;uring their &s;words according to his de&s;ire. The duke, incen&s;ed at the contempt with which Henry had treated him, reproached him, in a &s;econd letter, with the epithets of traitor, u&s;urper, and regicide. Bolingbroke, in an&s;wer to this outrage, gave him the lie in form, and accu&s;ed him of having practi&s;ed &s;orcery, in order to intail upon his brother Charles the malady with which he was afflicted. The Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, who &s;till continued their conferences at Lelinghen, demanded, in the king's name, whether or not this challenge was avowed by their ma&s;ter; for, if it was, Henry would look upon it as an open rupture; and the French plenipoten|tiaries would make no other an&s;wer, but that it was their king's intention to ob&s;erve the truce with good faith and punctuality. The&s;e, in their turn, de|manded the dower of I&s;abel; and the king of England per&s;i&s;ting in his pre|ten&s;ions to the ran&s;om of king John, the one debt balanced the other, and there the affair re&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XIX.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time a dangerous &s;torm impended over Henry's head in England, which had been brewed by the mo&s;t powerful noblemen of the kingdom. We have already ob&s;erved, that immediately after the victory at Holme$on, the king forbad the victors to di&s;po&s;e of their pri&s;oners without his direction. He afterwards &s;ent a peremptory order, demanding they &s;hould be delivered into his hands; and the earl of Northumberland ex|po&s;tulated with him, upon the inju&s;tice of depriving them of the ran&s;om to which they were intitled by the laws of war. The earl pre&s;umed too much upon his own &s;ervice; and talked in &s;uch terms as di&s;gu&s;ted Henry, who re|buked him for the freedom of his di&s;cour&s;e, and de&s;ired him to keep his proper di&s;tance for the future. The impatient &s;pirit of the Piercies took fire at this behaviour in the king, which they con&s;idered as an unpardonable indignity. The father and &s;on looked upon them&s;elves as the &s;upport of his government; and they thought they were as able to depo&s;e him as they had been in&s;tru|mental in rai&s;ing him to the throne: Northumberland's brother Thomas earl of Worce&s;ter not only e&s;pou&s;ed their quarrel, but al&s;o laid a plan of revenge, which had well nigh deprived Bolingbroke of his royalty. He propo&s;ed a cor|re&s;pondence with Mortimer, who had by this time married the daughter of Owen Glendourdwy; and that nobleman, with his father-in-law, readily con|curred in a &s;cheme for dethroning Henry, and elevating Mortimer as the true heir of blood to the throne of England. Douglas and others of the Scotti&s;h pri|&s;oners were engaged as their a&s;&s;ociates, on condition of being relea&s;ed without ran&s;om; and they returned to their own country, in order to rai&s;e forces for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e by whom they had &s;o lately been defeated. Worce&s;ter was the &s;oul of this con&s;piracy. He not only projected the plan, but executed a
<PB N="225" REF="2270">
contract of partition among the parties; by which the crown and kingdom of England was a&s;&s;igned to Mortimer; the whole country to the northward of the Trent fell to the &s;hare of Northumberland, to be held by homage to the king; and Owen Glendourdwy was to be gratified with all the counties to the we&s;tward of the Severne. An immediate pretence for revolt being &s;till wanting, the earl of Northumberland, who di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment, repre&s;ented to the king, that as Mortimer had been taken in his &s;ervice, it was but rea&s;onable that he &s;hould pay his ran&s;om. Henry, piqued at this remon&s;trance, replied, that the earl of Marche had taken the field of his own accord for the defence of his own e&s;tate; and therefore his di&s;pute with Owen was a private quarrel with which the king had no manner of concern: he at the &s;ame time hinted, that Morti|mer had &s;urrendered to Owen on purpo&s;e to carry on a corre&s;pondence with that traitor more conveniently; and flatly refu&s;ed to contribute one farthing towards his relea&s;e. Young Piercy, who had married Mortimer's aunt, loudly ex|claimed again&s;t this refu&s;al, which he &s;aid was a &s;ure proof that Henry dreaded the right and title of Mortimer, who he hoped would die in captivity; and this argument had great weight with &s;uch people as were attached to the right of lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>The earl of Northumberland with his brother and &s;on retired to the north, in order to levy forces and wait for the Scotti&s;h auxiliaries; and tho&s;e arriving, Worce&s;ter and Hot&s;pur began their march towards Che&s;hire, where they expected to be joined by the natives of that country, as well as by a &s;trong body of Wel&s;h under Mortimer and Glendourdwy, who had promi&s;ed to meet them on the Marches. In the mean time the earl of Northumberland remained at Berwick, on pretence of being indi&s;po&s;ed; though in reality to a&s;&s;emble another body of troops, with which he might join the confederates in ca&s;e they &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful in their fir&s;t attempt; and that he might be at hand to retire into Scotland, provided the enterprize &s;hould mi&s;carry, and he him&s;elf be con&s;idered by Henry as an accomplice of the rebels. Before they took the field they had pulled off the ma&s;k, renounced their allegiance to Henry of Bolingbroke, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, charging him with treachery and perfidy, in having de|throned his lawful prince, contrary to the oath which he had taken in their hearing at Donca&s;ter, immediately after his arrival in England. They likewi&s;e accu&s;ed him of having ruled in a tyrannous manner, and rendered him&s;elf in|acce&s;&s;ible to every body but the clergy, in&s;omuch that the greate&s;t nobleman of the land could not be admitted to his pre&s;ence, unle&s;s introduced by &s;ome bi|&s;hop; and they afhrmed that he had converted to his own private u&s;es, the &s;ub&s;idies which had been granted for the occa&s;ions of the public. The king publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to this declaration; and by the advice of the Scotti&s;h earl of Dunbar, who re&s;ided at his court, took the field immediately, with the forces which he had luckily provided for another Wel$h expedition. Having pro|ceeded as far as Burton upon Trent, he received intelligence that Worce&s;ter and his nephew had marched towards the frontiers of Wales, in order to join Mortimer and Glendourdwy: and here again Dunbar with &s;ome difficulty pre|vailed upon him to alter his route, and hinder if po&s;&s;ible their conjunction. He accordingly wheeled about, and directed his march towards Shrop&s;hire; and this motion in all probability &s;aved him from de&s;truction; for Owen had actually advanced as far as O&s;we&s;tre, with a body of twelve thou&s;and men, in
<PB N="226" REF="2280">
order to join Piercy, who was already reinforced by the people of Che&s;hire, the co$tant adherents of Richard in all his di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The Piercies had given out that the late king was &s;till ahve, and that their intention was to deliver him from captivity; and this a&s;&s;ertion brought numbers to &s;erve under their ban|ners. They had marched to Shrew&s;bury, and even inve&s;ted the place, when the king's army appeared in fight$ then Hot&s;pur abandoned the &s;iege, and with|drew his forces to Hartlefield, about three miles from Shrew&s;bury, where he re&s;olved to hazard an engagement.</P>

<P>His troops did not exced fourteen thou&s;and fighting men, includ|ing the Scotti&s;h auxi&s;&s;aries under the earl of Douglas; and the king's forces were not much more numerous. After both armies were drawn up in order of battle, Henry's re&s;olution &s;eemed to fail him. He had formerly fought for glory as a private adventurer, but now his crown as well as his life was at &s;take$ and he found him&s;elf on the eve of a battle, with two noblemen counted the brave&s;t and the be&s;t commanders in Chri&s;tendom. Staggered by the&s;e re|flections, he &s;ent the abbot of Shrew&s;bury with propo&s;als of accommodation to Worce&s;ter; and made &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, as would in all probability have &s;atis|fied the unexperienced Piercy, who was but little acquainted with the arts and equivocation of mankind. His uncle knew how little was to be depended upon the promi&s;e or conce&s;&s;ions of a prince, who acts from the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs; and mi&s;repre&s;ented the king's me&s;&s;age to Hot&s;pur, who &s;ent a defiance to Hen|ry, and made a &s;hort &s;peech to his &s;oldiers, encouraging them to exert all their manhood to &s;ave them&s;elves from di&s;grace, and the hands of the common execu|tioner, which, &s;hould they be conquered, would fini&s;h what the &s;word &s;hould leave. Henry &s;eeing his terms rejected and the rebels preparing to give him battle, recollected all his fortitude, and with the help of the earl of Dunbar and his &s;on Henry prince of Wales, made an excellent di&s;po&s;ition of his forces. His Scotti&s;h coun&s;ellor, who was upon this occa&s;ion not only actuated by his attachment to his benefactor, but al&s;o by his hatred of Douglas the rival of his hou&s;e and reputation, &s;uppo&s;ing that an effort would be made again&s;t the per|&s;on of Henry, advi&s;ed that &s;everal per&s;ons might be cloathed in the &s;ame kind of attire, and followed by the &s;ame &s;ort of attendants and equipage that u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed the king. The advice was approved, and in all likelihood &s;aved<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 14$3.</NOTE> the life of Bolingbroke. The battle began with a di&s;charge of arrows on both &s;ides; then the Scots under Douglas, and a choice body commanded by Hot|&s;pur, charged the front of the king's line with &s;uch fury, that they bore down all before them, until they had penetrated to the royal &s;tandard, which was beaten down. The king's hor&s;e was killed under him; and the prince of Wales received a wound in the face, while he fought with incredible prowe&s;s. The impetuo&s;ity of Piercy and Douglas was the cau&s;e of their overthrow; they r$$hed on with &s;uch precipitation, that their &s;oldiers could not follow them; and the line which they had broken clo&s;ing again, intercepted their retreat. They &s;ought clo&s;e by one another, and performed miracles of valour with the few who had fo$$owed their $span$ and Douglas &s;lew three different per&s;ons who pa&s;&s;ed for the $word$ of England by their coats of armour and di&s;tinctions: but all their followers being &s;lain, they found them&s;elves hemmed in on all &s;ides, without any pro&s;pect of being joined or relieved by the re&s;t of their forces, who knew not how to act when thus deprived of their leaders. The king per|ceiving
<PB N="227" REF="2290">
their confu&s;ion, put him&s;elf at the head of a body of re&s;erve, and fall|ing in among them, made terrible havock; while Piercy and Douglas re&s;olved to cut their way back to their own forces. All oppo&s;ition failed before them, until Hot&s;pur was &s;lain by an arrow; and his death was no &s;ooner known, than his whole army betook them&s;elves to flight with the utmo&s;t precipitation, after the battle had la&s;ted three hours, during which it was maintained with equal valour on both &s;ides. The king him&s;elf expo&s;ed his per&s;on like the meane&s;t &s;oldier in his army, charged the enemy &s;word in hand, and is &s;aid to have &s;lain &s;ix and thirty men with his &s;ingle arm. The prince of Wales be|haved with the utmo&s;t gallantry; and the victory was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the conduct and &s;edate valour of the earl of Dunbar. On the king's &s;ide, Edmund earl of Stafford, who commanded the fir&s;t line, Sir Hugh Shirley, Sir John Clifton, Sir John Cokaine, Sir Nicholas Gau&s;el, Sir John Calverley, Sir John Ma&s;&s;ey, Sir Hugh Mortimer, and about &s;ixteen hundred men were left dead upon the &s;pot, and above three thou&s;and grievou&s;ly wounded. The rebel army lo&s;t double that number: the earls of Worce&s;ter and Douglas were taken pri&s;oners, together with the baron of Kinderton, and Sir Richard Vernon. All the&s;e were beheaded at Shrew&s;bury, except Douglas, whom the king di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed without ran&s;om on account of his valour. Hot&s;pur's body was at fir&s;t buried by the permi&s;&s;ion of Henry; but he afterwards ordered it to be dug up and quartered, that the different parts might be expo&s;ed in different places of the kingdom. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal$ingham.</NOTE></P>

That nobleman had ad|vanced into the bi&s;hopric of Durham, in his way to join his brother; and the earl of We&s;tmoreland had already a&s;&s;embled a body of forces to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age; but Piercy, receiving intelligence of the di&s;a&s;ter at Shrew&s;bury, marched back to Newca&s;tle, from whence he retired to his ca&s;tle of Werkworth, where he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops, and remained until king Henry arrived at York, and &s;ummoned him to appear in that city. Thither he repaired with a &s;mall retinue, after having previou&s;ly received an a&s;&s;urance of pardon; and the king admitted the apology which he made for his conduct: though he treated him with great coldne&s;s and indifference, and obliged him to give &s;ecurity for his appearance at the en&s;uing parliament. Perhaps he would have met with more rigorous treatment, had not Henry thought it impolitic to drive a nobleman to de&s;pair, who was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Berwick, Alnewick, and Werkworth; be|&s;ides the ca&s;tles that were occupied by his friends and va&s;&s;als, who had e&s;caped from the battle of Shrew&s;bury. The king having exacted a new oath of alle|giance from the noblemen and freeholders of the northern counties, and forbid, on &s;evere penalties, all depredations upon tho&s;e who had been concerned in the in&s;urrection, returned towards the borders of Wales, in order to proceed upon another expedition again&s;t Owen Glendourdwy; but this de&s;ign was de|feated by his w$nt of money for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his army. He called a coun|cil of war to deliberate upon ways and means for removing this difficulty; and &s;ome of the courtiers propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould &s;eize the money and rich equi|pages of the prelates who &s;erved in the expedition.

<P>While Henry was thus employed in the north of England, the court of France re&s;olved to take advantage of the troubles of the nation. The duke of Orleans intended to make a de&s;cent upon the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, while John, the young duke of Burgundy, &s;hould undertake the &s;iege of Calais: but Henry's &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the rebels defeated the&s;e projects; though the French mini&s;try encouraged the inhabitants of Bretagne, to commit depreda|tions upon the Engli&s;h. They accordingly fitted out a number of &s;hips, with which they harraffed the we&s;tern coa&s;t, and even plundered the town of Ply|mouth. Henry, complaining of this violation of the truce, and receiving very little &s;atisfaction from the French court, permitted the inhabitants of Plymouth to make repri&s;als; and they equipped a &s;mall fleet, of which they gave the command to William Wilford, who took vengeance effectually upon the Bre|tons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. C$. 14$4.</NOTE> The parliament meeting at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the fourteenth day of January, the earl of Northumberland pre&s;ented a petition to the king, implo|ring his clemency, and the performance of the promi&s;e of pardon which he had made at York. Henry referred this petition to the judges; but the lords ent$red a prote&s;t again&s;t this reference, declaring, that judgment in ca&s;es of trea&s;on belonged to them only. Then they took into con&s;ideration the charge again&s;t the earl, and pronounced that the facts alledged again&s;t him did not amount to trea&s;on no$ felony, but only a tre&s;pa&s;s, for which the &s;aid earl ought to make fine and ran&s;om to his maje&s;ty. Thus acquitted, the earl petitioned that he might renew his oath of allegiance, which he &s;wore anew upon the cro&s;s of Canterbury; and then the king remitted his fine and ran&s;om. The com|mons having thanked the king and lords in full parliament for their ju&s;t and equitable judgment, petitioned that his maje&s;ty would abo$i&s;h all animo&s;ities &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the noblemen of the realm; and at his command, the earl of No$thumberland and We&s;tmoreland embraced each other with marks of the mo&s;t perfect reconciliation, promi&s;ing that they them&s;elves, and their tenants and va&s;&s;als, &s;hould for the future live in peace and amity. The earl of Dunbar was likewi&s;e reconciled to Northumberland; and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the duke of York, with &s;everal prelates and lords, &s;u&s;pected of having been concerned in the late con&s;piracy, were cleared by the king, and declared true and loyal &s;ubjects. Certain Bretons who came over with the queen, being $word$ of carrying on a corre&s;pondence with the French, articles of complaint were pre&s;ented again&s;t the king's confe&s;&s;or, the abbot of Dore, and two gentle|me$ of the bed-chamber, who were immediat$ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the king; and his $word$ declared that he would retain no per&s;on in his &s;ervice, who $word$ be di&s;agreeable to his people. Then the commons petitioned that he $word$ $$move all foreigners from his hou&s;hold, except five or &s;ix who attended $word$ q$ee$'s $word$ and he forthwith complied with their reque&s;t. $word$ by the$e in&s;tances of conde&s;cen&s;ion, they repre&s;ented to the king, that

the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his affairs required great management and oeconomy. They de&s;ired he would re&s;ume all the grants on the dutchy of Cornwal, made by him&s;elf or his predece&s;&s;ors, that they might be re-annexed to the crown for the maintenance of the prince of Wales; they reque&s;ted that he would not grant away the profits of his ca&s;tles, which were repaired at the charge of the na|tion, but that he would &s;ettle the expence of his hou&s;hold upon a certain e&s;tab|li&s;hment. The king made &s;atisfactory an&s;wers to all the&s;e petitions; reduced the charges of his family to ten thou&s;and one hundred pounds a year; declared his intention to reform the abu&s;es which had crept into his hou&s;ekeeping; and a&s;&s;ured the commons, by the mouth of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, that the proceedings of the common law &s;hould not for the future be di&s;turbed or de|layed by letters under the privy &s;eal, or any other interpo&s;ition whatever. In the mean time, he de&s;ired the parliament would take orders for di&s;charging the debts of his hou&s;hold, and appoint trea&s;urers to in&s;pect the management of the money appropriated for the &s;ervice of the public. How this money was rai&s;ed does not appear in the proceedings of this parliament: though we are told by a certain hi&s;torian, that a very oppre&s;&s;ive tax was impo&s;ed upon the people, on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE> condition that it &s;hould not be drawn into a preceden$; and that no evidences of &s;uch a tax &s;hould be pre&s;erved in the trea&s;ury or exchequer. No briefs or commi&s;&s;ions were i&s;&s;ued for bringing the collectors to account; and all the writings and entries of this extraordinary aid were committed to the flames. A general pardon had been publi&s;hed in favour of all the adherents and abet|tors of the earl of Worce&s;ter and the lord Henry Piercy, provided they would &s;ubmit before the &s;ixth of January; and now an act of grace was pa&s;&s;ed for all trea&s;ons, in&s;urrections, and mi&s;demeanors, except rapes, murders, forging royal &s;eals, and fal&s;e coining, extending to the fourteenth day of January, in favour of all per&s;ons, except &s;uch as were actually impri&s;oned for tho&s;e offences. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, a body of Bretons landed near Portland, and burned &s;ome villages; but were repul&s;ed by the inhabitants, and afterwards defeated at &s;ea by the Engli&s;h fleet, which took their admiral Cha$tel, and the greater part of his armament. A petty war was carried on between the Bre|tons and the Engli&s;h, though both courts di&s;claimed the ho&s;tilities that were committed$ The duke of Orleans entered Guienne, and made an attempt upon the town of Bergi, but was obliged to retire with lo&s;s, by the valour of Sir Robert Anteville, who defended the place with a garri&s;on of three hundred Engli&s;hmen. The duke's conduct was influenced by a per&s;onal aver&s;ion to Henry; and the French mini&s;try connived at the&s;e infringements of the truce, in hope that &s;ome in&s;urrection in England, joined to the efforts of Glendour|dwy, would afford an opportunity to declare open war again&s;t Henry, whom they con&s;idered as an u&s;urper. He was well acquainted with their &s;entiments, and found it convenient to temporize, until he &s;hould have triumphed over all dome&s;tic oppo&s;ition. It certainly was his intere&s;t to avoid a war with his neigh|bours at &s;uch a juncture; and for that rea&s;on, he not only winked at the in|&s;ults which he &s;uffered from the French, but even &s;ollicited a truce with Scot|land, which was concluded in the month of July, to continue till the en&s;uing Ea&s;ter.</P>

an $word$ well worthy of his mo$t &s;erious attention. This was the progre&s;s of $word$ who had lately reduced the ca&s;tles of Harlegh and Abery&s;twith, defeated a &s;trong body o$ Eng$$$h at Cra$gydorth near Monmouth, and ra|vaged the country as $ar as the banks of the Severne: in a word, he proceeded wi$$ &s;uch rapidity of &s;ucce&s;s, that no Engli&s;hman on the Ma$ches could pre|tend to po&s;&s;e&s;s his e&s;tate, without &s;ubmitting to his dominion; and he was joined by a great number of Henry's &s;ubjects, among whom was Trevor bi&s;hop of St. A$$ph. The king &s;eemed to be aver&s;e to another expedition into Wales, where he had been already &s;o unfortunate: and at pre&s;ent he was re&s;trained from pro&s;ecuting that war, by a ferment in the mid&s;t of his kingdom, rai&s;ed by a very trivia$ incident. The idle report of Richard's being alive was now revived, and gained more credit than ever. One Serle, who had been his do|me&s;tic, repaired to Scotland to &s;ee his old ma&s;ter, and engaging as an accom|plice in the deceit, wrote letters to different people in England, a&s;&s;uring them that king Richard was in being and in good health. The evidence of a man, who could not po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken in the per&s;on of a prince whom he had long attended, produced &s;uch an effect, that one half of the nation was deceived by the impo&s;ture, which was greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the old counte&s;s of Oxford, mo|ther of the duke of Ireland, who had been attainted in the reign of Richard. This lady not only pretended to confirm the report from her own knowledge, but pre&s;ented a great number of per&s;ons, in his name, with little harts made of &s;il|ver, like tho&s;e with which that prince u&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h his favourites. The king, alarmed at the con&s;equence of this deceit, which was propagated and &s;upported in all parts of the kingdom by artful monks, who acted as her emi&s;&s;aries, ar|re&s;ted the counte&s;s, who was confined to clo&s;e pri&s;on, and deprived of her e&s;tate; and &s;ome of her agents were convicted and executed as &s;editious im|po&s;tors. As the earl of Northumberland was &s;u&s;pected of favouring the cheat, Henry made a progre&s;s to Pontefract, where that nobleman &s;urrendered him|&s;elf, with all his grand&s;ons and de&s;cendants; &s;o that the king was fully convin|ced of his innocence: though he obliged the earl to give up the town and ca&s;|tle of Berwick, and the fortre&s;s and fore&s;t of Jedburgh, with all its appurtenan|ces; in con&s;ideration of which Henry agreed to gratify him and his heirs with an equivalent, by the advice of the parliament o$ council. Ser$e, being tired of maintaining the per&s;on who had a&s;&s;umed the name of Richard, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Sir William Clifford governor of Berwick, whom he knew to be upon bad terms with Henry$ but that officer, in&s;tead of &s;upplying him with money to carry on the impo&s;ture, made his peace with the king, by delivering him up to ju&s;tice. Finding him&s;elf convicted and condemned, he not only explained the deceit, but owned that he had been concerned in the murder of the duke of Glouce&s;ter at Calais; &s;o that he ju&s;tly &s;uffered the death of a traitor, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Speed.</NOTE> nation was at length di&s;abu&s;ed.</P>

<P>This alarm being pa&s;t, the king re&s;olved to act again&s;t Glendour|dwy with his whole power, &s;o as to reduce that rebel in one campaign; but as he wanted money to defray the expence of the expedition, he convoked a par|liament at Coventry on the &s;ixth day of October; and as he had always been thwarted in his mea&s;ures by the meddling clergy and practitioners of the law, who piqued them&s;elves upon knowing the con&s;titution, he &s;tretched his prero|gative in a very unju&s;tifiable manner, by in&s;erting a clau&s;e in the writ of &s;um|mons,

excluding all per&s;ons who under&s;tood the law from being elected; and when the members were returned, it was not without rea&s;on that they acquired the name of the Illiterate Parliament. The bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who was Hen|ry's brother, and chancellor of England, ob&s;erved, in his &s;peech at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the &s;upplies granted by the late parliament had not been adequate to the nece&s;&s;ities of the government; and that it was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to vote a con&s;iderable &s;ub$idy for the reduction of Wales, and the de|fence of the kingdom from foreign adver&s;aries, as the truce with Scotland would expire in the &s;pring, and the French mini&s;try &s;eemed very much di&s;po&s;ed to an open rupture with England. The commons, by way of an&s;wer to this demand, went in a body and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, importing, that without burthening his people, he might relieve the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate by &s;eizing the revenues of the clergy, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one third of the riches in the kingdom, and ought to contribute largely to the occa&s;ions of the government, as they were totally exempted from per&s;onal &s;ervice. The archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, who was pre&s;ent when they delivered this addre&s;s, perceiving by the king's countenance that the propo&s;al was not all di&s;agreeable, &s;tood up and op|po&s;ed it with great vehemence. He refuted the allegations in the addre&s;s, by repre&s;enting, that although the clergy did not &s;erve per&s;onally in the wars, they could not therefore be deemed u&s;ele&s;s members of &s;ociety; ina&s;much as they &s;ent their va&s;&s;als and tenants to &s;erve in the army, when their &s;ervice was re|quired. He &s;aid, that in &s;tripping the clergy of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he would put a &s;top to the prayers which they offered up ince&s;&s;antly to heaven for the prof|perity of the &s;tate; and that he could not expect that God would vouch&s;afe his protection to the kingdom, i$ &s;o little regard &s;hould be payed to the intere&s;t of the clergy. He de&s;ired the commons to take notice, that they would not find it an ea&s;y matter to deprive the clergy of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, without ex|po&s;ing the kingdom to the mo&s;t dangerous convul&s;ions; and declared, that while he occupied the &s;ee of Canterbury, he would oppo&s;e &s;uch inju&s;tice to the la&s;t moment of his life. He then fell upon his knees before the king, and con|jured him, as he valued his eternal &s;alvation, to avoid a &s;tep which would not only be a direct violation of his coronation oath, but al&s;o oblige the clergy to proceed to &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen$ures, as would throw the wh$$e kingdom into confu&s;ion. Henry, &s;tartled perhaps at this la&s;t in&s;inuation, a&s;&s;ured him that his fears were altogether without foundation; for that he was firmly determined to execute the re&s;olution he had made when he a$cended the throne, and would maintain the church in all her rights and privileges. The archbi&s;hop, en|couraged by this a&s;&s;urance, turned to the commons, and rebuked them &s;everely for their pre&s;umption in pre&s;enting &s;uch an addre&s;s, which was the effect of impiety and avarice. Notwith&s;tanding this reproof, to which they made no reply, they per&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;olution, and brought in a bill for &s;eizing the re|venues of the clergy; but the&s;e la&s;t had &s;uch influence among the nobility, that it was thrown out by the hou&s;e of lords; and the commons were obliged to devi&s;e other ways and means for &s;upplying the king's nece&s;&s;ities. After &s;ome<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wa$$ingham.</NOTE> debate, they, with the a&s;&s;ent of the lords, granted a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy on wool and wool-fells, wine, and other merchandize, on condition that it &s;hould be applied to the expence of the war and the de$ence of the realm, under the in|&s;pection of the lord Furnival and Sir John Pelham, appointed trea&s;urers for
<PB N="232" REF="2340">
that purpo&s;$. The antient inheritance of the crown having been parcelled out i$ grants to private per&s;ons, the commons complained of &s;uch alienation; a$d n$t only advi&s;ed a re&s;umption, but enacted a &s;tatute, empowering the king to take, for one year, the profits of all annuities, fees, or wages, granted &s;i$ce th$ reign of Edward III. excepting, however, from this re&s;umption, c$rtain officers of &s;tate, ju&s;tices, barons of the exchequer, and other mini&s;ters of a$y of his courts of judicature. It was al&s;o decreed, that he &s;hould enjoy for t$$ like term all hereditaments a$$enated from the crown, except &s;uch as were granted to the queen, or the royal family, or confirmed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by act of parliament. They re&s;olved to make proclamation, that all who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed patents of any annual value, granted &s;ince the fortieth year of Edward III. &s;hould, on pain of forfeiture, bring them in by a certain day ap|pointed, that the merits of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors might be examined, and their patents continued or revoked accordingly. After the&s;e &s;teps towards a reformation of the revenues, the commons, upon a petition of the prince of Wales, exhibited in parliament, voted him a thou&s;and marks a year for maintaining a body of men to defend the Wel&s;h Marches. They recommended the king's &s;ons John and Humphrey to their father for honourable preferment. They, in an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, de$ired the duke of York might receive the arrears due to him for his &s;ervices in Guienne, which they hoped the king would not forget; and reque&s;ted that he would order re&s;titution to be made to Richard, brother to the duke of York, of &s;ome valuable jewels which were in the hands of the late king.</P>

The kingdom was filled with murmurs and di&s;content, indu&s;triou&s;ly fomented by the emi&s;&s;aries of tho&s;e, who either wi&s;hed well to the heir of blood, or &s;marted from the &s;everity of the reigning king, or dreaded the de|&s;igns of his policy, and the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of his avarice, which was not yet &s;atisfied with the great &s;um belonging to Richard that fell into his hands, and the exorbitant &s;ub&s;idies granted by parliament. The nation in general &s;eemed ripe for revolt, and naturally turned their eyes upon Mortimer, who &s;till re|mained in captivity. Henry, far from treating for his ran&s;om, had &s;eized his children, and confined them in the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or, as ho&s;tages for the conduct of their father, whom the king &s;u&s;pected of intrigues again&s;t his go|vernment, in conjunction with Glendourdwy. The counte&s;s dowager of Thomas Spen&s;er e$$l of Glouce&s;ter, who had been beheaded at Bri&s;tol, un|dertook to effect the deliverance of tho&s;e children; and, by means of fal&s;e keys that opened the locks under which they were confined, accompli&s;hed their e&s;cape from Wind&s;or: &s;he had even conveyed them as far as the Marches of Wales, when &s;he was &s;eized by the officers of Henry, who or|dered the &s;ons of Mortimer to be more clo&s;ely confined and narrowly watched for the future. The counte&s;s being examined before the council, not only confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had been in&s;tigated to this attempt by her brother the duke of York, but al&s;o accu&s;ed him of having formed a de&s;ign to &s;cale the walls of Eltham, and take away the life of his &s;overeign.

He a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, the command of which he b$&s;towed upon the prince of Wales, who marched thither in the &s;pring, and routed part of the Wel&s;h army. He &s;till continued to advance after this action; and, in two months, fought another battle, near Gro&s;mont in Monmouth&s;hire, again&s;t a body of eight thou&s;and men, commanded by Griffith, elde&s;t &s;on of Owen Glendourdwy, who was routed and taken pri&s;oner; his uncle Tudor being killed upon the &s;pot. He re&s;embled his brother &s;o exactly, that his body being found among the &s;lain, was mi&s;taken for Owen; and this report, added to the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the battle, overwhelmed the Wel&s;h with con&s;ternation. The prince of Wales, after his victory, advancing farther into South Wales, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Lampader in Cardigan&s;hire; and the garri&s;on agreed to &s;urrender, if not relieved by the fir&s;t day of October. The Wel&s;h would have been di&s;pirited by this bad &s;ucce&s;s, had not they been amu&s;ed by France, from which they expected powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The duke of Orleans, who go|verned that kingdom, payed no regard to the truce &s;ub&s;i&s;ting with England. He engaged in a league with Glendourdwy; &s;ent the con&s;table d'Albert and the count d'Armagnac with an army into Guienne, where they reduced &s;ixty places belonging to the Engli&s;h.

<P>Ralph earl of We&s;tmoreland being appri&s;ed of their intention, rai$ed a body of troops; and, joining the forces under John of Lanca&s;ter, warden of the Ea&s;t Marches, advanced again&s;t the revolting lords, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion, before they &s;hould be joined by the earl of Northum|berland. He found them encamped on Shipton-Moor, about two leagues to the northward of York; but, perceiving they already out-numbered his fol|lowers, and waited with impatience for an engagement, he altered his plan, and re&s;olved to defeat them by &s;tratagem or treachery. He &s;ent an agent to propo&s;e an interview, which being granted, he met the archbi&s;hop of York, the earl mare&s;chal, and the re&s;t of the confederate lords, in fight of both ar|mies. There he prote&s;ted that he heartily concurred with them in their con|cern for the welfare and pro&s;perity of his country; and in general approved the articles of their manife&s;to. Then he propo&s;ed &s;ome mea&s;ures for the ac|compli&s;hment of their de&s;ign; and cajoled them in &s;uch a manner, that they were convinced of his being a &s;incere well-wi&s;her to the &s;cheme they had pro|$ected. He called for wine, and they drank together in token of amity: he even affected to embrace them with the mo&s;t cordial affection; and ordered his attendants to retire, as a proof of his confidence in their honour and friend|&s;hip. This frank manner of proceeding had &s;uch an effect $pon the confede|rates, that they likewi&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their followers, who were no &s;ooner out of &s;ight, than We&s;tmoreland's guard returned at $ull &s;peed, and &s;eized the arch|bi&s;hop and Mowbray, before they could receive any &s;uccour from their ad|herents. Their army being thus deprived o$ their chie$s, was &s;eized with con&s;ternation, and di&s;per&s;ed immediately: the earl of Northumberland being informed of this di&s;a&s;ter, took refuge in Berwick, of which he was go|vernor, and from thence retired with lord Bardolfe to Scotland.

was on his march to the north, when the archbi&s;hop and Mowbray were &s;urprized by We&s;tmoreland, who delivered them into his maje&s;ty's hands at the ca&s;tle of Pontefract. The king ordered the liberties of York to be &s;eized; and, when he arrived at Bi&s;hop&s;thorp, on the eighth day of June, commanded Sir William Ga&s;coigne, chief ju&s;tice of England, to try the archbi&s;hop for high trea&s;on: but he declining the office, Sir William Ful|thorp, another judge, pronounced &s;entence of death again&s;t him as a traitor; and he was beheaded immediately after condemnation.</P>

<P>He had acquired &s;uch a character for &s;anctity, and died with &s;uch compo&s;ure and re&s;olution, that the common people looked upon him as a martyr; and he was &s;aid to work miracles after death. He was the fir&s;t bi&s;hop that ever &s;uffered death in England, by a &s;entence of the civil judge; and the pope was &s;o much incen&s;ed at this infringement of eccle&s;ia&s;tical li|berty, that he excommunicated all who were concerned in his death and con|demnation. Mowbray earl mare&s;chal &s;uffered in the &s;ame manner, without arraignment, trial, or defence; and heavy fines were impo&s;ed upon the re&s;t who had been engaged in the in&s;urrection. The lands and ca&s;tles belonging to the earl of Northumberland and the lord Bardolfe were confi&s;cated; and all the military tenants of the crown &s;ummoned to meet at Newca&s;tle, from whence the king propo&s;ed to march in per&s;on, and undertake the &s;iege of Berwick. Before he approached the place, the two noblemen had fled to Scotland, leaving the command of the town to Sir William Grey&s;tock, who was well prepared for a vigorous defence. But one of the towers being demo|li&s;hed by the &s;hot from a large piece of cannon, the garri&s;on was &s;o intimi|dated, that he was obliged to &s;urrender the place without farther re&s;i&s;tance: Warkworth, Alnwick, and the earl's other ca&s;tles in that country, were re|duced with equal ea&s;e by Henry, who, having quelled the commotions of the north, directed his arms again&s;t Owen Glendourdwy, by this time<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$&s;ingham$ Ry$er.</NOTE> ren|dered more and more formidable by his French alliance. While the king was employed in &s;ettling the affairs of the north, the marechal de Montmorency arrived in Wales with a numerous fleet, from which he landed t$elve thou|&s;and men; then, joining Glendourdwy, took Caermarthen, Worce&s;ter, and &s;everal other places, ravaging the country with fire and &s;word, and carrying off immen&s;e booty. Henry began his march $rom the north, in order to &s;top the progre&s;s of tho&s;e invaders; but he was retarded in &s;uch a manner by bad weather, that, before he arrived in the Marches of Wales, the French auxi|liaries were embarked, and the &s;ea&s;on &s;o far advanced, that he could under|take nothing of con&s;equence again&s;t Owen, who found means to intercept fifty waggons, laden with provi&s;ions and money for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army. This misfortune ha&s;tened his retreat towards London, where he applied to the bi&s;hops for a fre&s;h &s;upply, which was granted in the next convocation.</P>

Then he demanded a &s;upply, which they bluntly refu&s;ed; alledging, that their former &s;ub&s;idies had been &s;quandered away without any benefit to the nation. Henry was ex|tremely

ince$&s;ed at this mortifying repul&s;e, but di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment, and re&s;o$ved to $$re them into compliance. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was continued till the lat|ter end o$ Augu&s;t, to the infinite prejudice of their private affairs, and great expence of their con&s;tituents who payed their wages; and then they voted a &s;ub&s;idy, under &s;uch re&s;trictions, however, that Henry could not touch above &s;ix thou&s;and pounds $or his own u&s;e, the re&s;t having been appropriated to the pub|l$c &s;ervices.

During the &s;e&s;&s;ion of this par$$ament, the king carried on a private negotiation with &s;ome Scotti&s;h noble|men, who promi&s;ed to deliver the earl of Northumberland and the lord Bar|do$fe into his hands, on condition that he would relea&s;e without ran&s;om their r$lations who had been taken at the battle of Holmedon.

<P>The contract between Henry and the Scots was managed by the duke of Albany, brother to Robert III. king of Scotland, who, having de&s;igns upon the crown to the prejudice of his nephews, maintained a friendly corr$&s;pondence with Henry, who he hoped would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his u&s;urpation. Robert was a prince of &s;u$$ weak intellects, and &s;o &s;lothful and irre&s;olute, that the duke of Albany had already engro&s;&s;ed the whole admini&s;tration, and gained &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over the king, that the &s;imple monarch dur&s;t not avow his &s;entiments on tho&s;e &s;ubjects that mo&s;t nearly concerned the intere&s;t of his own family. The duke, on pretence of &s;ome irregularities, had extorted an order from Robert to confine his elde&s;t &s;on David prince of Scotland in the ca&s;tle of Falkland, where that unhappy prince was &s;tarved to death by his inhuman uncle. The father being appri&s;ed of this tragedy, and afraid of taking ven|geance upon the perfidious actor, re&s;olved to remove his other &s;on James with|out the reach of Albany's influence, and &s;ent him on board of a &s;hip to be con|veyed to France for his education. This young prince, who had attained the fourteenth year of his age, was provided with two tutors, whom the father f$rni&s;hed with letters of recommendation, not only to the French mini&s;try, but al&s;o to Henry king of England, in ca$e the prince &s;hould be driven into any part of his territories by &s;tre&s;s of weather. James being very much incommo|ded by the nau&s;ea, to which many people are &s;ubject at &s;ea, was &s;et a&s;hore on the coa&s;t of Norfolk. There he was immediately apprehended and brought to Henry, who committed him pri&s;oner to the Tower, in violation of the truce that full &s;ub$$$$ed between the two nations; and of the rites of ho&s;pitality, to the benefit of which he was pathetically recommended by his unhappy father. Tha$ $word$ died of grief in t$ree days after he received the tidings of his &s;on's capt$v$$y; and the du$e of Albany continued to act as regent of the kingdom, in which capacity he re$ewed the truce with England.</P>

returned to Brittany in a &s;hattered condition.

Having pa&s;&s;ed part of the &s;ummer in this habitation, he re|&s;olved to vi&s;it another country-hou&s;e in Norfolk by &s;ea, and went on board of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, attended by four &s;hips loaded with his baggage and dome&s;tics.

<P>Henry's affairs had been &s;o &s;ituated &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1407.</NOTE> throne, that he had never been able to &s;pare troops for the defence of Guienne; and the French taking advantage of his neglect in this particular, made a con|&s;tant practice of wre&s;ting the places of that province out of his hands, either by open force, or bribing the governors to &s;urrender. The duke of Orleans, who had all along treated Henry with the mo&s;t provoking in&s;olence, made another fruitle&s;s attempt upon Bourg and Blaye, while the duke of Burgundy renewed his &s;cheme of be&s;ieging Calais. He did not venture, however, to en|gage in this enterprize; and loudly complained that the duke of Orleans had wilfully thrown ob&s;tacles in the way of his de&s;ign. The quarrel between the&s;e two princes of the blood proceeded to &s;uch a degree of rancour, that Orleans was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the emi&s;&s;aries of Burgundy, who avowed the murder with impunity, although the defunct was the king's own brother. The death of the duke of Orleans, who had encouraged and protected the Bretons in their ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Engli&s;h, alarmed that people with apprehen&s;ions of their being left at the mercy of England, in ca&s;e an accommodation &s;hould be effect|ed between the two crowns; they therefore willingly li&s;tened to Henry's pro|po&s;al of a truce for one year, before the expiration of which they thought they &s;hould be able to judge of the &s;y&s;tem of politics which the French court would pur&s;ue. Henry was not ignorant of their views, though he di&s;&s;embled his &s;en|timents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pu$</NOTE> and laid it down as a maxim, that it was more prudent to temporize with his neighbours, than be expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of his own &s;ubjects. He concluded at this period, a treaty of commerce with the duke of Burgundy and the &s;tates of Flanders; and in October convened a parliament at Glou|ce&s;ter, where he demanded a &s;ub&s;idy which introduced an inquiry into the ap|plication of the la&s;t aid granted in parliament. Warm debates aro&s;e on this &s;ubject; and the king's conduct was cen&s;ured with great freedom. But at length they granted a &s;ub&s;idy, though upon expre&s;s condition that he would not demand another aid for two years, nor load the &s;ubjects with any new charge or impo&s;ition.

The&s;e noblemen had made application to the co$rts of France and Scotland, which amu&s;ed them with promi&s;es of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But now that the d$ke o$ O$leans was dead, and the truce between England and the duke of Albany renewed, they had very little rea&s;on to expect $uccour from tho&s;e quarters, and re&s;olved, by the help of their own friends, and the other malecontents of the nation, to rai&s;e an in&s;ur|rection in the north of England. For this purpo&s;e, they went thither and a&s;|&s;embled a large number of troops, which were reinforced by a body of Scot|ti&s;h freebooters, and retook &s;everal ca&s;tles which the king had reduced after the battle of Shrew&s;bury. Henry was no &s;ooner informed of the&s;e proceedings, than he &s;ummoned his military tenants, re&s;olving to march in per&s;on again&s;t the rebels, who having advanced as far as Thir&s;k in the North-Riding of York|&s;hire, publi&s;hed a mani$e&s;to, declaring their intention was to redre&s;s the grie|vances of the nation, and inviting all its well-wi&s;hers to join them in &s;uch a laudable undertaking. They were accordingly joined by great numbers of the country people, ill armed and totally ignorant of di&s;cipline, who committed terrible outrages in their march, and proceeded in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. Sir Thomas Rokeby &s;heriff of York&s;hire, knowing the king was in full march again&s;t them with a con&s;iderable army, $$mmoned the freeholders of the county, with their va&s;&s;als, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;s of Knare&s;borough, which they would not attempt to force; but turning off towards Wolherby, continued their route to Tadca&s;ter, from whence they marched to Braham-Moor, where the earl drew them up in order of battle. The &s;heriff followed them at &s;ome di&s;tance, in order to watch their motions; and being joined in his march by a con&s;ider|able number of gentlemen in the neighbourhood, re&s;olved to give the rebels battle without further he&s;itation. The earl of Northumberland was prepared for the attack; his followers, however, did not long &s;u&s;tain the on&s;et. The engagement began with great $ury on both &s;ides; but the rebel army, con&s;i&s;t|ing either of raw undi&s;ciplined people irregularly armed, or &s;uch as &s;erved in hope of plunder, w$re &s;oon broken and routed, in &s;pite of all the efforts of the earl o$ Northumberland, who was killed on the field o$ battle. The lord Bardolfe died of his wounds; the abbot of Hales being taken in armour, was hanged; but the bi&s;hop of Bangor's life was &s;pared, becau&s;e, though taken on the &s;pot, he was found in his ordinary habit. Henry had advanced as far as Nottingham, where he received the news of this victory; notwith&s;tanding which, he continued his march northwards as far as York, where he puni&s;hed the &s;urviving rebels with death, fine, or forfeiture; and rewarded Rokeby<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chro$.

<P>After the de$eat and death of the earl of Northumberland, Owen Glendourdwy's affairs declined apace. Prince Henry was &s;o active and &s;ucce&s;sful in his operations, that, in the cour&s;e of this year, he completed the

conque&s;t of South-Wales, and reduced Harlech in Merioneth&s;hire; &s;o that Owen was in a manner be&s;ieged in Snowdun, where he was greatly &s;traitened for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. From thence he detached part of his troops to ravage Shrop|&s;hire, under the command of Rees Du and Philpot Scudamore, his two be&s;t officers, who were defeated, taken, and executed at London. As Owen's fortune began to change, he was gradually for&s;aken by the be&s;t part of his adherents, who &s;ubmitted, and were pardoned by prince Henry. He him&s;elf might have enjoyed the &s;ame indulgence, could he have &s;tooped to &s;uch &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion: but he cho&s;e rather to lead the remainder of his life as an independent vagrant, &s;hifting from place to place, than to purcha&s;e &s;afety and ea&s;e at the expence of freedom. For two years he led this wandering life, &s;ometimes at the head of a party, and &s;ometimes quite &s;olitary; and at la&s;t died at his daughter's hou&s;e in Hereford&s;hire, where he was entertained in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;hepherd.

That nobleman attacked the place with great gallantry; but the Bretons made &s;uch a vigorous attempt, that he was repul&s;ed, after having received a wound in his head which proved mortal. The Engli&s;h, enraged at the death of their commander, gave another a&s;&s;ault with &s;uch fury, that they carried the place, put all who were found in arms to the &s;word, and brought the re&s;t as pri&s;oners to England.</P>

As they did not think proper to appear, the council declared them perjured heretics, and &s;tripped them both of the pontifical dignity, which they a&s;&s;umed. At the &s;ame time the cardinals being empowered to chu&s;e a new pontiff, elected Peter Philargi, a Candiot, who took the name of Alex|ander V.

brought in a bill again&s;t frauds in returning-officers, to which the king a&s;|&s;ented with reluctance. Then he demanded a &s;ub&s;idy to defray the expence of the government; and the commons took this occa&s;ion to renew their addre&s;s again&s;t the clergy. The majority of that hou&s;e leaned towards Lollardi&s;m; and therefore they pre&s;ented two addre&s;&s;es to his maje&s;ty: in one of which they repre&s;ented, that the clergy made a bad u&s;e of their wealth, converting it to purpo&s;es widely different from tho&s;e for which it was intended by the ori|ginal donors: that their revenues, being &s;ufficient to maintain one hundred and fifty earls, fifteen hundred barons, &s;ix thou&s;and two hundred knights, and one hundred ho&s;pitals, ought to be appropriated to the&s;e u&s;es; in which ca&s;e the kingdom would be in a better po&s;ture of defence, the poor more comfortably &s;upported, and the clergy more attentive to their duty. In the other addre&s;s, the commons petitioned that the act pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Lollards might be repealed, or at lea&s;t mitigated, for the $a&s;e of the &s;ubject. Henry, being no longer over-awed by the fear of inte&s;tine trouble and foreign inva|&s;ion, began to di&s;cover that arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition which he had hitherto endea|voured to conceal. In&s;tead of complying as formerly with the demands of his commons, he replied, with great &s;everity, that he neither would nor could con&s;ent to their petitions, and peremptorily forbade them to meddle for the future with the affairs of the church: not that he had the lea&s;t regard for the clergy, but he cho&s;e to e&s;pou&s;e their intere&s;t in oppo&s;ition to the commons, whom he was re&s;olved to humble. With regard to the Lollards, he &s;aid, that far from a&s;&s;enting to the repeal of the act, he wi&s;hed that a more rigo|rous &s;tatute might be pa&s;&s;ed, in order to extirpate &s;uch an execrable here&s;y. The commons, di&s;appointed in this hope, demanded that clerks, accu&s;ed of felony or other crimes, might not be judged in courts of eccle&s;ia&s;tical judica|ture, becau&s;e daily experience proved that &s;uch malefactors always e&s;caped the puni&s;hment they de&s;erved to undergo. This reque&s;t was likewi&s;e rejected by Henry, who affected upon this occa&s;ion an extraordinary zeal for the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical intere&s;t. He &s;eemed bent upon mortifying the commons; for, though he knew they were in general favourers of Wickliff's tenets, he &s;igned a death-warrant again&s;t one Bodby, a taylor, who had exclaimed again&s;t the doctrine of the real pre&s;ence in the &s;acrament. That poor fanatic was brought to the &s;take; and, when the fire began to con&s;ume his body, uttered &s;uch di&s;mal &s;hrieks and exclamations, that the prince of Wales, who was pre&s;ent at the execution, commanded the fire to be extingui&s;hed. When the mi&s;e|rable victim recollected his &s;pirits, the prince offered to procure his pardon, and allow him a pen&s;ion for life, if he would recant: but he refu&s;ed to live upon &s;uch terms; and, the fire being re-kindled, died a martyr to his per&s;ua&s;ion. The commons con&s;idered the execution of this man as an out|rageous aggravation of the refu&s;al they had already &s;u&s;tained; and &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity to manife&s;t their re&s;entment. When the king demanded permi&s;&s;ion to levy a certain yearly &s;ub&s;idy, even though the parliament &s;hould not be a&s;&s;embled, they rejected the propo&s;al with marks of a&s;perity; nor would they have granted a &s;ub&s;idy for the occa&s;ions of the &s;tate, had not he repeated his former expedient of detaining them until they were tired into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal$ingha$.</NOTE> compliance.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, the truce with Scotland expiring, ho&s;ti|lities were renewed on the borders, and the Scotti&s;h cruizers interrupted the navigation and trade of the Engli&s;h. In order to cha&s;ti&s;e the&s;e adventurers, Robert de Humpreville, vice-admiral of England, entered the Frith of Edin|burgh, with ten capital &s;hips, and not only de&s;troyed the whole naval force of Scotland, but ravaged the whole coa&s;t; from whence he brought off &s;uch a booty in goods, corn, and cattle, as removed the horrors of a dearth in the north of England; where he acquired the appellation of Robert Mendmarket. At the &s;ame time Sir John Pendergrace and William Long were &s;ent to &s;ea, with a fleet to act again&s;t the French cor&s;airs, of which they effectually &s;coured the channel: but, whether they had entered into &s;ome private engagement with Henry touching the prizes, which agreement they did not ob&s;erve; or offended him in &s;ome other particulars of their conduct; he i&s;&s;ued a warrant to arre&s;t Pendergrace when he came a&s;hore; and that officer was obliged to take &s;anctuary in the porch of We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, where he was &s;ur|rounded by a guard of &s;oldiers, and continued for &s;ome time, until he thought proper to throw him&s;elf upon the mercy of the king, who committed him to pri&s;on.

<P>About this period, &s;everal negotiations were carried on in different<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. C$ $word$</NOTE> parts of the continent, and produced a prolongation of the truce with France for five years, with Ca&s;tile for two, and with Brittany for ten: but a treaty was concluded with the duke of Burgundy, the nature of which it will not be improper to explain. After this prince had effected the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> duke of Orleans, he retired to his dominions in Flanders, with a view to re|&s;tore the brother of his dutche&s;s, who had been expelled from the bi&s;hopric of Liege by the inhabitants of that city. While he was employed in making preparations for this war, the dutche&s;s of Orleans, with her three &s;ons, went to the French court, and, throwing them&s;elves at the king's feet, demanded ju&s;tice again&s;t the murderer of his brother. Although the duke of Burgundy had obtained his pardon for this murder, his enemies had &s;uch credit at court, that the pardon was revoked, and he was declared an enemy to the &s;tate. Mean while the duke marched again&s;t the Liegeois, over whom he obtained a complete victory, which was no &s;ooner known at Paris, than his adver&s;aries left that city, where he had a great number of parti&s;ans, and retired to Tours with the king, who was not in a condition to regulate his own conduct. The duke of Burgundy, being informed of the&s;e tran&s;actions, &s;et out immediately at the head of four thou&s;and hor&s;e for Paris, where he was received with triumphal honours; and the citizens, at his de&s;ire, &s;ent deputies to the king, to reque&s;t that he would return to their city. Charles, who happened to be in one of his lucid intervals, declared that he would not countenance the ene|mies of the duke of Burgundy; and, returning immediately to Paris, em|ployed &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons of the &s;tate to mediate an ac|commodation between that prince and the children of his brother the duke of Orleans. With great difficulty they &s;ucceeded in their endeavours: the young duke of Orleans, who had ju&s;t attained the &s;ixteenth year of his age, found him&s;elf obliged to be reconciled to his mo&s;t mortal enemy; and his

<P>Henry of England, having always at heart an alliance with France, re&s;olved i$ po&s;&s;ible to effect a match between the prince of Wales and one of the $word$ of the duke of Burgundy; but this prince was not &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed as the king of England imagined. The dukes of Berry, Or|leans, Alen$on, and Brittany, with the counts of Clermont and Armagnac, a$$$mbling at G$e$, formed an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t the duke of Burgundy, and advanced at the head of an army towards Paris. Their antagoni&s;t, who had the king in his power, a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, and prepared for their re|ception; but both &s;ides &s;eemed aver&s;e to a battle, which mu&s;t have been fatal to France, whatever party might have obtained the victory. Mea&s;ures were there|fore taken for an accommodation, which was concluded, on condition that the duke of Burgundy &s;hould quit Paris; that the confederates &s;hould not enter $word$ $word$ nor any chief of either $action repair to court, unle&s;s commanded to give his attendance, by letters under the great &s;eal. The duke of Burgundy, in conformity with this agreement, retired to the Low Countries; but the confederates did not act with the &s;ame &s;crupulous integrity: the other was no &s;ooner arrived in his own territories, than they levied another army, and ap|proached Paris, in hope of enriching them&s;elves with the plunder of that city, which was of the Burgundian faction. The place was accordingly inve&s;ted; and the duke, finding him&s;elf duped by the perfidy of his enemies, imme|diately concluded an alliance with the king of England, who &s;ent a con&s;ider|able body of archers to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus reinforced, the duke began his march; but the Flemings and Picards, who compo&s;ed his army, quarrelling after he had reduced the town of Ham, di&s;per&s;ed and returned to their own habitations; &s;o that the duke found him&s;elf abandoned by all but the Engli&s;h auxiliaries, under the earl of Arundel, amounting to eight hundred men at arms and one thou&s;and bowmen. With the&s;e he proceeded to Paris, the blockade of which had been &s;ome time formed by the duke of Orleans; and, forcing his way through the quarters of the enemy, entered the city, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. As the Engli&s;h troops were not very agree|able to the inhabitants, who looked upon them through the mi&s;t of national prejudice, the duke re&s;olved to employ his auxiliaries in action, not doubting but their exploits would &s;oon reconcile them to the Pari&s;ians. On the very next day after their arrival, he ordered them to attack the important po&s;ts of Montma$tre and La Chappelle, from which they drove the enemy with great &s;laughter; and, in a few days after this atchievement, they attacked St. Cloud, which was defended by $$ri and Bournonville, two officers of equal courage and experience, at the head of the be&s;t troops in France: and, notwith&s;tand|ing all the endeavours of the defendants, the Engli&s;h, &s;upported by a body of Picards and Pari$$ans, carried on the a&s;&s;ault with &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible fury, that the place was taken, about nine hundred gentlemen were put to the &s;word, and a great number taken pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the&s;e places obliged the duke of Orleans to rai&s;e the blockade of Paris, and retire towards the provinces, where his troops di&s;per&s;ed. After his retreat, the duke of Burgundy reduced all the ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es in the I&s;le of France, which had been &s;eized by the

In con&s;ideration of this conce&s;|&s;ion, the commons granted a &s;ub&s;idy for the occa&s;ions of the king; and &s;ome regulations were made touching the reformation of the coin, which had been notoriou&s;ly adulterated.

<P>Charles $ing of France, recovering the u&s;e of his intellects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1412.</NOTE> de|clared warmly in favour of the duke of Burgundy, and removed all the great officers of &s;tate, who had been engaged in the faction of Orleans, known by the name of Armagnacs, from the count of that denomination. The duke of Burgundy, thus &s;trengthened by the whole intere&s;t of the royal fa|mily, and the favour of the Pari&s;ians, began to treat his Engli&s;h auxiliaries with indifference, and evade the con&s;ummation of the match between his daughter and the prince of Wales, which had been &s;tipulated in his treaty of alliance with Henry. The chiefs of the Armagnac faction being well appri&s;ed of the&s;e circum&s;tances, and pre&s;uming upon the re&s;entment of Henry towards the duke, who had thus made a tool of him for his own purpo&s;es, re&s;olved to gain him over to their intere&s;t, in hope that an alliance with England would throw the ballance in their favour. Having a&s;&s;embled at Bourges, where they deliberated on this &s;ubject, they &s;ent deputies to treat with Henry, and make &s;uch offers as were likely to detach him from the Burgundian fac|tion. The duke no &s;ooner was informed of this negotiation, than he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to pre&s;s the conclu&s;ion of the marriage-contract, which he had hitherto eluded; and Henry pretended to receive the propo&s;al with plea&s;ure: but this affectation was no more than a feint, calculated to extort more advantageous terms from the faction of Armagnac; and it was attended with the de&s;ired effect. The envoys of that confederacy no longer he&s;itated in com|plying with all his demands; and the treaty was concluded on the following terms: The confederate princes engaged to deliver into the hands of the Eng|li&s;h king fifteen hundred towns, ca&s;tles, or bailliages, which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Guienne and Poitou: To conquer for him all the re&s;t of the&s;e provinces that remained under the dominion of France; &s;o that he &s;hould enjoy Guienne and its dependencies in the &s;ame manner as it was formerly enjoyed by his predece&s;&s;ors. On the other hand, Henry agreed that the duke of Berry &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s Poitou for life, on condition of doing homage for it to the king of England, and &s;urrendering to him in the mean time the towns of Poitiers, Niort, and Lu&s;ignan. As for the other places, the duke was per|mitted to appoint governors, who &s;hould bind them&s;elves by oath to give
<PB N="244" REF="2460">
them up to the king of England, immediately after the death of their ma&s;ter. It was agre$d, that the duke of Orleans &s;hould retain the dutchy of Angouleme, and the count of Armagnac certain chattelanies in Guienne, on the &s;ame con|d$$$ons$ a$d Henry undertook to &s;upply the princes with one thou&s;and men at arms, and three times that number o$ archers to rendezvous at Blois, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> they &s;hould be received and enter into pay of the confederates.

Henry him&s;elf intended to make a voyage in per&s;on to Guienne, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the places in that dutchy, according to the &s;tipulations of the treaty; but he was either prevented by ill health, or diverted from his purpo&s;e by a new turn, which happened in the affairs of France at that juncture.</P>

<P>The duke of Burgundy, while the league between Henry and th$ French prince was upon the carpet, a&s;&s;embled an army and be&s;ieged them in Bourges, which they defended &s;o vigorou&s;ly in expectation of being relieved by the Engli&s;h auxiliaries, that he thought proper to offer favourable terms of accommodation. As they were &s;till uncertain with re&s;pect to the arrival of the Engli&s;h &s;uccours, they embraced his propo&s;als; and the peace was ratified in all its forms. Mean while the duke of Clarence landing in Normandy, advan|ced towards Blois with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, ab&s;taining from all violence in his route, until he was informed of the accommodation; then he con&s;idered France as an enemy's country, and ravaged it accordingly. The duke of Or|leans, in order to put a &s;top to the&s;e outrages, delivered his own brother the count de Angouleme, as an ho&s;tage for the payment of the money which was already due to the Engli&s;h forces; and Clarence retired to Guienne, where he recovered &s;ome places for Henry, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the count de Armagnac and the lord of Albret, who were di&s;&s;atisfied with the terms of the pacification.</P>

<P>Henry had now &s;urvived all his troubles; and the kingdom of England enjoyed the mo&s;t profound tranquility. He had nothing to fear $rom France, di&s;tracted by its own inte&s;tine divi&s;ions; the Wel&s;h &s;ued for peace; the regent of S$otland dreaded a rupture with England, le&s;t Henry &s;hould &s;end home the king, who was his pri&s;oner; and the malecontents in England were too incon&s;iderable to attempt any thing further again&s;t the go|vernment. During this calm, the king endeavoured to efface the impre&s;&s;ions o$ &s;everity, which his conduct had made upon the people, by affecting a popu|larity and regard for the welfare of the &s;ubject, which never fails to conciliate the aff$ction of the Engli&s;h in favour of their &s;overeign. While he thus la|boured, not without &s;$cce&s;s, to retrieve the reputation he had lo&s;t, his &s;on the prince of Wales &s;eemed b$nt upon incurring the public aver&s;ion. He gave a loo$e to all kinds o$ de$auchery; and was &s;urrounded by a crew of profligate wretches, who made a practice of committing the mo&s;t illegal acts of violence.

Neverthele&s;s, in the mid&s;t
<PB N="245" REF="2470">
of the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, the noblene&s;s of his heart &s;eemed every now and then to emerge from the torrent by which it was overwhelmed. One of his di&s;&s;olute companions having been brought to trial for &s;ome mi&s;demeanor, was con|demned, notwith&s;tanding all the intere&s;t he could make in his favour; and he was &s;o exa&s;perated at the i&s;&s;ue of the trial, that he &s;truck the judge upon the bench. This magi&s;trate, who&s;e name was Sir William Ga&s;coigne, behaved with the dignity that became his office; he forthwith ordered the prince to be committed to pri&s;on: and young Henry, by this time con&s;cious of the flagrant in&s;ult he had offered to the laws of his country, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be quietly conducted to goal by the officers of ju&s;tice. When this tran&s;action was re|ported to the king, who was an excellent judge of mankind, he could not help exclaiming, in a tran&s;port of joy, <Q>&startq;Happy is the king who has a magi&s;trate endowed with courage to execute the laws upon &s;uch an offender; and &s;till more happy in having a &s;on who will &s;ubmit to &s;uch cha&s;ti&s;ement.&endq;</Q> Henry was naturally jealous of the lea&s;t &s;hadow of competition, and therefore lent an ear to officious para&s;ites, who in&s;inuated that the prince had an evil de&s;ign upon his crown and authority. Such in&s;inuations filled his brea&s;t with anxiety; and perhaps he might have proceeded to &s;ome extremities, in order to a&s;certain his own &s;ecurity, had not all his &s;u&s;picion been di&s;pelled by the prudent &s;tep which the prince took, as &s;oon as he was made acquainted with the jealou&s;y of his father. He repaired to the king's court in a &s;trange habit, invented as an emblem of the &s;orrow and anxiety of his heart. Demanding a private au|dience of the king, he threw him&s;elf on his knees, and acco&s;ted him to this effect. <Q>&startq;I under&s;tand, my liege, that you &s;u&s;pect me of harbouring de&s;igns to the prejudice of your crown and per&s;on.

This ma|lady co-operating with &s;cruples of con&s;cience, touching the means he had u&s;ed to a&s;cend the throne, and an idle prophecy importing that he &s;hould die in Je|ru&s;alem, di&s;po&s;ed his mind to the duties of devotion; and he took the cro&s;s with full re&s;olution to con&s;ecrate the remaining part of his life to a war again&s;t the infidels. He imparted his de&s;ign to a great council a&s;&s;embled for that pur|po&s;e; and began to make preparations for the expedition, when his di&s;order encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that he was obliged to lay a&s;ide his intention, and think of a voyage which &s;eemed to be of greater importance. As his con&s;titution de|cayed, his fears of lo&s;ing the crown redoubled, even to a childi&s;h anxiety. He
<PB N="246" REF="2480">
would not &s;leep unle&s;s the royal diadem was placed by his pillow. One day he continued &s;o long in a &s;woon, that his attendants believed he was actually dead, and the prince of Wales conveyed the crown into his own apartment. The $$$g recovering the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es, and perceiving the crown was removed, asked who had prefumed to take it from his pillow; and under&s;tanding the a$$e$ had carried it away, ordered him to be brought immediately into his pre&s;ence. When young Henry appeared, "What!" &s;aid the king, with marks o$ m$d$gnation, "would you rob me of my dignity before my death." "No," replied the prince, <Q>&startq;thinking your maje&s;ty was dead, I took the crown as my lawful inheritance; but now I &s;ee you alive, I re&s;tore it with much more plea&s;ure; and may God grant you many happy days to enjoy it in peace.&endq;</Q> So laying, he placed the crown upon the pillow, and having received his father's ble&s;&s;ing, retired. The king was &s;urprized by his la&s;t fit, at his devotions be|fore the &s;hrine of St. Edward the Confe&s;&s;or in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, from w$ence he was carried to Jeru&s;alem Chamber. When he recovered from his &s;woon, and perceived him&s;elf in a &s;trange place, he de&s;ired to know if the apartment had any particular name, and being informed of its appellation, con|cluded that his la&s;t hour approached, and that he &s;hould die, according to the prophecy, in Jeru&s;alem. In this &s;entiment, he de&s;ired to &s;ee the prince of Wales, whom he enriched with &s;ome whole&s;ome advice touching his govern|ment: though he could not help expre&s;&s;ing great unea&s;ine&s;s, with re&s;pect to his own u&s;urpation; as well as concerning the duke of Clarence, who he &s;eemed to think would di&s;pute the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with Henry. The prince of Wales pro|mi&s;ed to keep his exhortations e$graven on his heart, and de&s;ired he would make him&s;elf ea&s;y on account of the duke of Clarence; for if that prince &s;hould be|have according to the dictates of his duty, he might expect to be treated with brotherly affection; but &s;hould he endeavour to di&s;turb the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he, the prince, would puni&s;h him according to his demerit. The king &s;eemed to be well plea&s;ed with Henry's re&s;olution; and having recommended him to the protection of heaven, expired on the twentieth day of March, in the forty|&s;ixth year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign. Henry IV. was of the middle &s;tature, well proportioned, and perfect in all the exerci&s;es of arms and chivalry: his countenance was &s;evere rather than &s;erene; and his di&s;po&s;ition four, &s;ullen, and re&s;erved: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare of courage, fortitude, and penetration; was naturally imperious, though he bridled his temper with cau|tion; &s;uper&s;titious, though without the lea&s;t tincture of virtue and true reli|gion; and meanly par&s;imonious, though ju&s;tly cen&s;ured for want of oeconomy, and ill-judged profu&s;ion. He was tame from caution, humble from fear, cruel from<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> policy, and rapacious from indigence. He ro&s;e to the throne by perfidy and trea|&s;on; e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority in the blood of his &s;ubjects; and died a penitent for his &s;ins becau&s;e he could no longer enjoy the fruits of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During this reign, William of Wickham bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, Sir Robert Kr$$$es, and Richard Whittington mayor of London, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves for their works of charity and public foundations.

<HEAD>&sect; I.</HEAD>
<P>THE death of Henry IV. would have been very little regretted at any juncture by the Engli&s;h, among whom he was far from being popular: but now it was the more agreeable as the prince of Wales was their darling, notwith&s;tanding all the extravagance and profligacy of his youth, through which they had already di&s;covered the dawn of great and good qua|lities. This prince, who was called Henry of Monmouth from the place of his birth, had been educated at Oxford under the eye of his uncle the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who was chancellor of that univer&s;ity. We have already &s;een how early in life he di&s;tingui&s;hed his valour and military capacity, in the battle of Shrew&s;bury and the war with Owen Glendourdwy, over who&s;e troops he ob|tained two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive victories. His father &s;eems to have been jealous of his talents and growing reputation; and for that rea&s;on to have put a &s;top to his warlike atchievements, and excluded him from all &s;hare in the council or ad|mini&s;tration. It was in this rece&s;s from more important avocations, that his bu&s;y genius, rather than be inactive, hurried him into tho&s;e &s;cenes of debauchery which in &s;ome mea&s;ure tarni&s;hed his reputation; though they did not much mi&s;become a prince of his youth and vivacity. Immediately after his father's death, he was proclaimed by the name of Henry V. to the general &s;atisfaction of the nation; and the parliament meeting on the twenty-fourth day of March, offered to take the oath of allegiance even before his coronation; a propo&s;al which he mode&s;tly declined, as an in&s;tance of their confidence which he did not de&s;erve. He was crowned, on the ninth day of April, by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and began his reign in &s;uch a manner, as captivated the hearts of his new &s;ubjects. He publi&s;hed a general amne&s;ty for all crimes, except murder and rape. He di&s;carded all the di&s;&s;olute companions of his youth, after having exhorted them to amend their lives, and provided for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. He cho&s;e a new coun|cil, con&s;i&s;ting of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men of the realm: he reformed the benches, by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing unqualified judges, and filling their places with per&s;ons of courage, knowledge, and integrity. The &s;ame care extended to inferior magi&s;|trates and vacant benefices, to which he preferred none but eccle&s;ia&s;tics of known worth and unblemi&s;hed morals. He expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t concern for the misfortunes of Richard, who&s;e corp&s;e he ordered to be removed from Langley to We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, where it was depo&s;ited by his queen Anne of Luxemburg with great funeral &s;olemnity, at which Henry a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on: he even acted the part of chief mourner on this occa&s;ion; and afterwards, by way of attonement for his father's u&s;urpation, he founded three mona&s;teries near Shene in Surrey, where prayers were continually preferred for the &s;oul of Richard. He relea&s;ed Edmund earl of Marche, who had been detained in cu&s;tody during the preceding reign; and treated him with &s;uch benevolence,
<PB N="249" REF="2510">
as won the heart of that young nobleman, who &s;erved him with the utmo&s;t fidelity. Henry likewi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed a noble pity for the &s;ufferings of the Piercy family; and invited the &s;on and heir of Hot&s;pur to come from Scotland, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.

<P>Though never prince a&s;cended the throne under more favourable au&s;pices, he could not e&s;cape the envy and hatred of &s;ome individuals. A con|&s;piracy was formed again&s;t him by means of one Wightlock, who endeavoured to &s;oment a rebellion by means of papers that were fixed up in all public places, containing affirmations that Richard was &s;till alive. This incendiary being ap|prehended was committed pri&s;oner to the Tower, from whence he e&s;caped, by the connivance of the con&s;table Edmund duke of York, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have projected the con&s;piracy. That nobleman was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office; and one of the warders, convicted of having favoured the pri&s;oner's e&s;cape, was executed as a traitor. The lieutenant of the Tower was mulcted in a thou&s;and marks for his negligence; and indictments were found again&s;t &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. But Henry, who de&s;pi&s;ed the authors of this attempt too much to think them worthy of revenge, impo&s;ed &s;light fines upon &s;ome, and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed all the other pro&s;ecutions.</P>

<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, which met on the fifteenth day of May, was opened with a &s;peech by the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter the king's uncle, who a&s;&s;ured them of Henry's zeal to promote the intere&s;t of church and &s;tate. The commons having cho&s;en William Stourton for their &s;peaker, pre&s;ented an ad|dre&s;s, de&s;iring that the laws might be duly executed, and the grievances of the nation redre&s;&s;ed. Then they petitioned that his maje&s;ty would provide for the de$ence of Ireland, Wales, the Marches of Scotland, Calais, and Guienne. They afterwards granted a &s;ub&s;idy of wool and leather for four years, together with the tonnage and poundage for one year, and a fifteenth and an half, ex|pre&s;&s;ing their hope of being &s;oon ea&s;ed of &s;uch taxes and tailliages by his wi$e ad|mini&s;tration. They complained loudly of the clergy's exacting pecuniary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl.</NOTE> commutations; and the king promi&s;ed to interpo&s;e with the bi&s;hops, that the&s;e abu&s;es might be reformed. Several &s;tatutes were enacted for the better pre&s;er|vation of the public peace, and the maintenance of the people's privil$ges; and one in particular calculated for preventing frauds and fal&s;e returns, in the election for members of parliament.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>While the commons were thus employed in making whole&s;ome regu|lations for the public welfare, the convocation of the clergy was held by Tho|mas Arundel archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had obtained from the late king an order to appoint commi&s;&s;ioneres in Oxford to take informations concerning the doctrines of the Wickli$$ites. The archbi&s;hop now communicated the re&s;ult of their inquiries to the convocation, which, after &s;ome debates, unanimou&s;ly agreed, that there was no other way of extirpating the here&s;y of the Lollards, but that of making examples of the principal favourers of their doctrine: that John Oldca&s;tle baron of Cobham, was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable protector of this pernicious &s;ect; that in order to &s;trike terror into the re&s;t, it would be nece&s;|&s;ary to begin with him, again&s;t whom they de&s;ired that a proce&s;s might be im|mediately in&s;tituted. As this nobleman was a per&s;on of great con&s;ideration with Henry, who&s;e e&s;teem he had acquired by his valour and military experience, the archbi&s;hop would not begin the pro&s;ecution, until he had fir&s;t obtained the
<PB N="250" REF="2520">
king's permi&s;&s;ion; and this he did not obtain, till after his maje&s;ty had expo|&s;tulated with Oldca&s;tle in private, and found him un&s;haken in his principles. Henry him&s;elf was a zealot for the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and &s;o exa&s;perated at the inflexibility of Cobham, that he withdrew all the regard he had hitherto profe&s;&s;ed for that Lollard, and allowed the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts to proceed again&s;t him with the utmo&s;t rigour Oldca&s;tle was &s;o extremely popular among t$e people of his own per&s;ua&s;ion, who $ere generally enthu&s;ia&s;tic fanatics, that they ex$laimed again&s;t the king as an oppre&s;&s;or, and did not even refrain from denouncing vengeance again&s;t him and his government. The&s;e clamours and menaces were repeated to the king by the clergy with &s;uch exaggerations, that his aver&s;ion to their principles increa&s;ed; and he began to look upon them as enemies both to the church and &s;tate in England. Lord Cobham being con|victed and condemned by the archbi&s;hop, was delivered over to the &s;ecular arm, but found means to e&s;cape from the Tower; and it was generally believed he intended to put him&s;elf at the head of the Lollards, and bid defiance to the government.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">

<P>Henry publi&s;hed a proclamation again&s;t their conventicles, forbidding them under $evere penalties, and prohibiting all per&s;ons from embracing their opinions, favouring their &s;ect, or preaching without a licence from the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e. They were exa&s;perated at this prohibition; and, in papers fixed upon the church-doors of London, not only complained of it as an act of per&s;ecution, but al&s;o declared they were both able and willing to repel force by force. Oldca&s;tle him&s;elf was now ripe for revolt, and actually began to make preparations for unhinging the con&s;titution. He &s;ent emi&s;&s;aries to all parts of the kingdom to reconcile the &s;ectaries to the &s;cheme he had projected. By means of Sir Roger Acton, John Brown e&s;quire, Sir John Beverely a preacher, one Murle a rich brewer of Dun&s;table, and the precentor of St Alban's, a great number of people were inflamed to his wi&s;h, and promi&s;ed to appear in arms at the rendezvous, which was fixed in St. Gile's fields, where they generally a&s;&s;embled to wor&s;hip. This place was deemed the more proper, on account of its vicinity to the court, and to the city of London, from which they ex|pected to be joined by a va&s;t number of apprentices. Henry, who re&s;ided at Eltham in Kent, was duly informed of every circum&s;tance of their de&s;ign, and took his precautions accordingly. He ordered a good body of &s;oldiers to march in &s;mall parties towards We&s;tmin&s;ter, where they had directions to a&s;&s;emble on the night appointed for the rendezvous of the Lollards. When the day ar|rived, he commanded the mayor to &s;hut the city gates, and po&s;ted guards at all the avenues, to prevent all egre&s;s: then he detached parties to &s;cour the country, while he him&s;elf marched with his banner di&s;played to St. Giles's fields, at that time covered with heath and furze, among which he found an incon&s;iderable number of the Lollards lying concealed in arms. Some of the&s;e were immediately put to the &s;word, and the re&s;t taken pri&s;oners. Among the&s;e, Acton, Brown, and Beverley were apprehended, and &s;uffered death as heretics and traitors, together with &s;ix and thirty of their followers. A good number was &s;$ain by the &s;couring parties, before they could join their brethren. Many were executed in other parts of the kingdom; and Cobham, who did<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ T$. $word$ Wal$$ngham.</NOTE> not appear on this occa&s;ion, was outlawed and pro&s;cribed. About four years after this period, he was taken, drawn, hanged, and burned, for here&s;y and trea&s;on.</P>

<P>Having thus given a detail of a commotion which has been dif|ferently related by different hi&s;torians, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain the &s;itua|tion of affairs in France, as an introduction to that war which continued &s;o long, and was &s;o productive of mi&s;chief and calamity to both nations. Charles VI. of France had three &s;ons$ namely, Lewis, John, and Charles. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Dauphin and duke of Guienne, was a worthle&s;s prince, plunged in all manner of debauchery, and in&s;pired with the mo&s;t arbitrary principles of de&s;potic power. He was now about &s;ix|teen years of age, when, by the advice of his favourites, he re&s;olved to de|prive the duke of Burgundy of the management of affairs, which that prince wholly ingro&s;&s;ed during the di&s;temper of Charles, and to take into his hands the reins of the admini&s;tration. For this purpo&s;e, he bribed the governor of the Ba&s;tile to &s;urrender that fortre&s;s, which he entru&s;ted to one of his own adherents. But the Pari&s;ians, who adored the duke of Burgundy, took to their arms, and a&s;&s;embled to the number of twelve thou&s;and men, in &s;upport of their favourite. This body being formed in two divi&s;ions, one half, com|manded by a &s;urgeon, repaired to the dauphin's palace, which they forced, and dragged twenty per&s;ons to pri&s;on, as evil coun&s;ellors, by whom he had been mi&s;led; the other party inve&s;ting the Ba&s;tile, the new governor was &s;o terrified that he &s;urrendered without oppo&s;ition; and the duke of Burgundy &s;aw his admini&s;tration re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. The inhabitants of Paris, intoxicated with their &s;ucce&s;s, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by white hoods or caps, and obliged not only the dauphin, but even the king him&s;elf, to wear this badge of di&s;|tinction. John de Troye the &s;urgeon, at the head of his in&s;urgents, repaired to court, and regardle&s;s of all the intreaties of the dauphin and king, &s;eized a good number of courtiers of both &s;exes, who were in&s;tantly committed to pri&s;on. Among the&s;e was Lewis of Bavaria the queen's own brother, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. Charles was fain to yield to the torrent, and pa&s;s whatever edicts they were plea&s;ed to demand. The dauphin finding him&s;elf thus en&s;laved by the &s;editious multitude, or rather by his father-in-law the duke of Burgundy, who privately actuated the machine, re&s;olved to make an effort to free him&s;elf from &s;uch di&s;agreeable re&s;traint, and &s;et on foot a ne|gotiation with the chiefs of the Orleans faction, who had been obliged to &s;ign a peace, by which they were &s;ecluded from Paris, and his maje&s;ty's coun|cil. He therefore went to confer with them in per&s;on, on pretence of healing up &s;ome little breaches which had been made in the peace of Bourges; and after having taken his mea&s;ures with the confederates, effected a confirmation of the peace, in a new treaty &s;igned at Pontoi&s;e, by which they were left at liberty to pay their re&s;pects to his maje&s;ty.</P>

<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VII.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Burgundy, judging from the attempt which the dauphin had already made, that he had nothing to expect from him but animo&s;ity and oppo&s;ition, determined to &s;ecure him&s;elf by means of an alliance to which he could have recour&s;e in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; and for this purpo&s;e turned his eyes upon the king of England. In the month of June, he &s;ent over an emba&s;&s;y, as count of Flanders, on pretence of renewing the treaty of commerce be|tween the Flemings and the Engli&s;h; but in reality to propo&s;e a league of an|other nature with Henry, which, however, did not immediately take effect. Before the king of England would conclude an alliance with the duke of Bur|gundy,
<PB N="252" REF="2540">
he was willing to be better acquainted with the real &s;tate of the French politics; and for that purpo&s;e &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Paris. By their public commi&s;&s;ion they were empowered to de$$nd, that the court of France would ob&s;erve the truce with more punctuanty than they had hitherto &s;hewn: that the &s;aid truce might be confir$$d or renewed; and that all differences between<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 1413.</NOTE> the two crowns might be a$$on modated. But they were in&s;tructed in private, to conclude an al$ance with the duke of Burg$ndy, in ca&s;e they &s;hould find<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$$ Pu$lic.</NOTE> his influence as great as it had been repre&s;ented.</P>
</DIV4>

<HEAD>&sect; VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The affairs of the French court &s;oon a&s;&s;umed another a&s;pect: the dukes of Orleans, Berry, Bo$rbon, A$$$&ccedil;on, the counts of Eu and Vendome, ha&s;tened to Paris, in con&s;equence of the permi&s;&s;ion the$ had obtained. The dauphin having gained over a great number $word$ the Pari&s;ians to his intere&s;t, and finding him&s;elf &s;o powerfully &s;upported by the confederates, &s;ent private orders to his parti&s;ans to a&s;&s;emble; &s;o that he $ound him&s;elf at the head of thirty thou&s;and men. With the&s;e he $coured the &s;treets of Paris, and &s;truck &s;uch terror into the oppo&s;ite faction that they abandoned the Louvre, Hotel de Ville, and Ba&s;tile, without oppo&s;ition; and the duke of Burgundy finding him&s;elf unable to &s;top their progre&s;s, retired into Flanders. Then the faction of the confederates prevailed at court, and the king being in one of his lucid intervals, conceived &s;uch affection for his nephew the duke of Orleans, that he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be directed intirely by his coun&s;els; &s;o that the dauphin reaped no advantage from the revolution he had effected. The new mini&s;ter began his admini&s;tration with &s;everal edicts again&s;t the duke of Burgundy, and pro&s;ecuted the authors of the former &s;edition, many of whom were executed as traitors.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; IX.</HEAD>
<P>The court of France being thus new-modelled, appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries, and the conferences were opened at Lelinghen in Picardy, where it was immediately agreed that the truce &s;hould be inviolably ob&s;erved till the month of June in the following year: but, in the cour&s;e of the negotiation, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors gave the commi&s;&s;ioners of France to under&s;tand, that the king their ma&s;ter expected France would re&s;tore all &s;he had wre&s;ted from England &s;ince the peace of Bretigny. The French mini&s;try, alarmed at this dec$aration, as being altogether unprepared for a war, &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Bourges, the con&s;table D'Albret, and the king's &s;ecretary, as amba&s;&s;adors to London, on pretence of facilitating the negotia|tions at Lelinghen; but in reality to di&s;cover the de&s;igns of Henry. While the&s;e re&s;ided in England, the French court continued its pro&s;ecutions again&s;t the Burgundian party, a great number of which fell by the hands of the com|mon executioner. Lewis of Anjou king of Sicily, &s;ent back the daughter of the duke of Burgundy, who had been betrothed to his elde&s;t &s;on, and procured a match between one of his own daughters and Charles count of Ponthieu, the third &s;on of the French king, a youth in the thirteenth year of his age. Nothing could be more fatal to France than this marriage. The young prince entered warmly into all the intere&s;t and re&s;entment of his father$in-law. He became a &s;worn enemy to the duke of Burgundy, who hated him with equal ran|cour; and their mutual animo&s;ity intailed a world of mi&s;chief on the unhappy kingdom. The dauphin could not without great chagrin behold the duke of Orleans at the helm of government, while he him&s;elf, by who&s;e means that
<PB N="253" REF="2550">
nobleman had been promoted, remained, without power or credit, a kind of pri&s;oner in the Louvre, where his conduct was narrowly ob&s;erved by the mi|ni&s;ter. Such re&s;traint was altogether in&s;upportable to a prince of his cha|racter; and therefore he lent a wi$ling year to the propo&s;als of the duke of Burgundy, who offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his power, in acquiring that influence and importance to which he was intitled by his birth and expecta|tions. They engaged in a &s;ecret alliance, with de&s;ign to drive the duke of Orleans from the admini&s;tration: and Burgundy a&s;&s;embled an army, with which he advanced towards the capital. His pretext was, that he came to deliver his &s;on-in-law the dauphin from captivity; and he hoped that Paris would declare in his favour. But the mini&s;try took &s;uch mea&s;ures as pre|vented all commotion; and the king i&s;&s;ued a declaration again&s;t the duke of Burgundy, in which he treated him as a traitor, and enemy to his country. Thus di&s;appointed, the duke de&s;i&s;ted from his enterprize, and returned to Flanders to wait for a more favourable opportunity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE></P>

<P>The archbi&s;hop of Bourges, and the con&s;table D'Albret, &s;oon per|ceived that Henry of England had re&s;olved to make his advantage of the troubles of France, by means of his alliance with the duke of Burgundy; and, in order to divert him from his purpo&s;e, propo&s;ed a marriage between him and Catherine, daughter of Charles. The propo&s;al &s;eemed to be reli&s;hed by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1414.</NOTE> Engli&s;h court; though Henry &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titution of all that had been taken from England &s;ince the peace of Bretigny; and as the amba&s;&s;adors had not powers &s;ufficient to treat upon that &s;ubject, all the effect of their ne|gotiation was a prolongation of the truce. Immediately after their return to France, Henry &s;ent thither five plenipotentiaries to continue the treaty of marriage and re&s;titution. The&s;e envoys were afterwards reinforced by the bi&s;hop of Norwich, the earls of Dor&s;et, Warwick, Sali&s;bury, and the lord Gray. Charles appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with them, the chief being his own uncle the duke of Berry. The Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;a$ors at fir&s;t demanded the whole kingdom of France for king Henry, as the heir of Edward III. But this demand they afterwards waved, with a &s;alvo to the rights of their &s;ove|reign, and re&s;tricted them&s;elves to the following requi&s;itions: namely, that Normandy, Anjou, le Maine, the &s;overeignty of Flanders and Britanny, all that France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Guienne, all in general that had been yielded to Ed|ward III$ by the treaty of Bretigny, and all the country under the French do|minion, between the Somme and Gravelines, &s;hould be ceded to the king of England, to be held by him as paramount, without homage or dependence. Before an an&s;wer was made to the&s;e demands, the duke of Berry pre&s;&s;ed the amba&s;&s;adors to begin with the marriage, as the mo&s;t effectual expedient for e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;olid peace between the two nations: but the Engli&s;h deput$es would not con&s;ider the match as the foundation, but rather as the appendage of the treaty. After warm debates, and much altercation, the amba&s;&s;adors re|duced their demands to the three following articles; upon which they demanded a categorical an&s;wer before they would proceed with the negotiation. They de|ma$ded all that had been ceded to England by the peace of Bretigny: the half of Provence, with the counties of Beaufo$t and Nogent; and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns that remained unpayed of king John's ran&s;om. With re|gard to the marriage, they plainly declared that the king their ma&s;ter would
<PB N="254" REF="2560">
never marry the prince&s;s Catherine, unle&s;s a firm and durable peace could be previou&s;ly e&s;tab$$$hed between the two crowns; and even if that &s;hould take effect, they hinted that Henry would expect at lea&s;t two millions as her por|tion. In a few days after this declaration, the d$ke of Berry delivered a w$$ting to the amba&s;&s;adors, containing the following propo&s;itions. The king of France is willing to cede to the Engli&s;h monarch the Agenois, the Ba&s;a|d$$s, part of A$ch, Perigord, L'E&s;carre, Oleron, La Bigorre, Saintonge on the other &s;ide of the Charente, all Quercy, except Montauban, with all the country between the Tarn and the Aveiron, Angoumois, and Rouvergne. His maje&s;ty cannot di&s;po&s;e of Provence, becau&s;e it is not in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but a$ he is willing, for the &s;ake of peace, to part with &s;o many fair provinces, he hopes the king of England will de&s;i&s;t from his demand in this particular. With regard to the marriage; although the portion of the daughters of France was reg$$ated at a much &s;maller &s;um than that which he had already offered, he would on this occa&s;ion augment it to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns. The&s;e propo&s;als produced a great number of conferences, during which the Engli&s;h again contracted their demands to the treaty of Bretigny, and one million for the portion of Catherine; but the French mini&s;try thinking even the&s;e too ex|orbitant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer.</NOTE> the negotiation proved ineffectual.</P>

<P>During this tran&s;action, Charles was per&s;uaded to declare war again&s;t the duke of Burgundy; and, taking the field in per&s;on, reduced Soi&s;&s;ons and Compiegne, of which the duke had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter. That prince was unable to make any re&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e his Flemi&s;h &s;ubjects refu&s;ed to &s;erve again&s;t the king of France; &s;o that the duke of Bourbon found no dif|ficulty in reducing Bapaume: and perhaps the duke of Burgundy might have &s;uffered much more &s;everely, had not Charles relap&s;ed into one of his pa|roxy&s;ms of lunacy, during which the operations were &s;u&s;pended, and Bur|gundy had time to &s;ecure Arras, with a numerous garri&s;on. The dauphin n$$ $ook po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the regency, becau&s;e there was no other per&s;on in the army who had intere&s;t enough to di&s;pute his preten&s;ions; and whether he had by this time quarrelled with his father-in-law, or did not think he had further occa&s;ion for his alliance, he marched again&s;t Arras, and undertook the &s;iege of that city. The place was well provided, and the garri&s;on made a vigorous defence; &s;o that the dauphin found the enterprize more difficult than he ima|gined it would have proved. This difficulty, joined to the &s;ollicitations of the counte&s;s of Ha$nault, who was &s;i&s;ter to the duke of Burgundy, and, per|haps, the &s;$gge&s;tions of the dauphin's own intere&s;t, di&s;po&s;ed him to li&s;ten to propo&s;als of an accommodation; and a treaty of peace was concluded on conditions that were by no means favourable to the duke of Burgundy. It was &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould enjoy the benefit of a pardon, from which, however, five hundred of his adherents were nominally excluded; that all his friends and favourites &s;hould be removed from court; that he him&s;elf &s;hould not pre&s;ume to go thither without the particular order of the king and council; and that the colours of France &s;hould be di&s;played upon the<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$z$r$$.</NOTE> walls of Arras.</P>

<P>It was at the beginning of this war, that the duke of Burgundy, finding him&s;elf very $$ch embarra&s;&s;ed by the ob&s;tinacy of the Flemings, had &s;ent the provo&s;t of St. Donas, as an envoy, to renew the treaty he had for|merly
<PB N="255" REF="2570">
begun with Henry king of England. This agent was not only in&s;truc|ted to conclude an alliance between the king and the duke, but al&s;o to treat about Henry's marriage with the prince&s;s Catherine, which he promi&s;ed to effect to the &s;atisfaction of the Engli&s;h monarch, after he &s;hould, by his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, re&s;ume his influence at the court of Charles. His propo&s;als met with a favourable reception from Henry, who &s;till retained his de&s;ign of profiting by the divi&s;ions of France, which he was re&s;olved to invade with a powerful army; fore&s;eeing that he &s;hould meet with little oppo&s;ition in a kingdom di|vided into two powerful factions, one of which would declare in his favour. He therefore convoked a parliament at Leice&s;ter, in order to procure &s;uch &s;upplies as would be nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of this important enterprize.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The commons had not yet laid a&s;ide their de&s;ign of humbling the clergy, though they had already mi&s;carried in two attempts. The propo&s;als they had made for &s;eizing the revenues of that body had been repre&s;ented to the king as the effects of impious here&s;y, which had crept in among the mem|bers, &s;ome of whom were profe&s;&s;ed Lollards; and therefore he had rejected their propo&s;ition. But this parliament changed their battery. In order to vindicate them&s;elves from the a&s;per&s;ion of Lollardi&s;m, they enacted a &s;evere &s;tatute again&s;t that &s;ect, importing, that all the magi&s;trates of the kingdom, and all tho&s;e who exerci&s;ed public employments, &s;hould engage upon oath to u&s;e all their endeavours to extermin$te heretics, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the bi&s;hops in the execution of that pious de&s;ign. This act was immediately followed by a vio|lent per&s;ecution again&s;t the Lollards; $ome of whom were committed to the flames; &s;ome quitted the kingdom, and others abjured their here&s;y. As the rolls of parliament were often vitiated, by in&s;erting the petitions of the com|mons in terms that conveyed a meaning quite different from that which they had intended to expre&s;s; and as the king and lords for &s;ome time pa&s;t had af|fected to treat the commons as petitioners only, who&s;e a&s;&s;ent was not nece&s;&s;ary to any act of the legi&s;lature, they now petitioned that no act or &s;tatute &s;hould pa&s;s without their a&s;&s;ent; that nothing &s;hould be entered on the rolls as their petitions, but in the very terms which they had u&s;ed; and that the hou&s;e of commons &s;hould, according to their privilege, be declared and e&s;tabli&s;hed as a con&s;tituent part of the legi&s;lature. The king having readily given his a&s;&s;ent to this petition, the commons concurred with the lords in an unanimous re&s;olution to &s;upport his maje&s;ty in his war with France; towards the maintenance of which, they intreated him to &s;eize the revenues of the clergy. This unexpected &s;troke was the more alarming to that venerable body, as the king &s;eemed to lend an ear to the propo&s;al of the commons. After divers con&s;ultations upon this important &s;ubject, they re&s;olved to give up part of their wealth, in order to &s;ecure the remainder; and offered, as a free gift, the whole wealth and revenues of one hundred and ten mona&s;teries of aliens: the king, rather than quarrel with the clergy, agreed to the pro|po&s;al; and the mona&s;teries were appropriated to his u&s;e by act of parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. $word$</NOTE> That his attention might be effectually weaned from a &s;ubject, which they did not chu&s;e he &s;hould con&s;ider, archbi&s;hop Chicheley, who had lately &s;uc|ceeded to the &s;ee of Canterbury upon the death of Arundel, compo&s;ed an elaborate &s;peech, which he pronounced before the king in full parliament, exhorting his maje&s;ty to engage in a war with France, for the recovery of the
<PB N="256" REF="2580">
crown of that kingdom, which he affirmed to be his lawful inheritance. He pretended to refute the Salique Law, as repugnant to the law of nature and the divine in&s;titution. He expatiated upon the pre&s;ent opportunity of a&s;&s;ert|ing his right, while France was di&s;tracted by inte&s;tine divi&s;ions, and England enjoyed the mo&s;t pro$ound tranquillity; and a&s;&s;ured his maje&s;ty, that if he would undertake the war in earne&s;t, the clergy would expre&s;s their loyalty and zeal for his &s;ucce&s;s, not only in their prayers to heaven, but al&s;o in giv|i$g larger &s;upplies than ever were granted to any of his predece&s;&s;ors. This harrangue, which, in all probability, was directed in private by the king him&s;elf, that he might &s;ound the inclinations of his people, met with uni|ver&s;al applau&s;e. Henry declared his re&s;olution to undertake the war: the $lergy indulged him with a very extraordinary &s;upply; and the laity, who &s;eemed to vie with them in affection to the cau&s;e, granted a &s;ub&s;idy of two whole tenths and as many fifteenths, which amounted to a prodigious &s;um of money.</P>

<P>The negotiation &s;till continued between the courts of France and England, and amba&s;&s;adors were continually going and coming between Paris and London. The French mini&s;try hoped to divert Henry from the pro&s;ecu|t$on of his de&s;ign, by means of the marriage with the prince&s;s Catherine; and the king pretended to be amu&s;ed with their propo&s;als; &s;o that the truce was prolonged from time to time, as if both &s;ides had thought that a pacifi|cation would en&s;ue: but the real de&s;ign of both was to gain time, though upon very different motives. The French court could not believe that the &s;on of an u&s;urper, who had been embroiled in &s;uch dangerous quarrels and di&s;|&s;en&s;ions with his own &s;ubjects, &s;hould be all at once &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne, but that &s;ome new di&s;turbance would employ him in his own do|minions; and that in the mean time all the differences among the princes of France might be compromi&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that they would heartily unite in defence of the nation. Henry, on the other hand, protracted the ne|gotiation, that he might be prepared to &s;trike the meditated blow, immediately after the conferences &s;hould break up, and before France &s;hould be in a con|dition to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. The French mini&s;try it&s;elf was divided on the &s;ubject of the$e negotiations: the duke of Berry was &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to an accommodation with England upon equitable terms; but the dauphin was ex|tremely aver&s;e to any terms that would di&s;member the dominions of France. He had conceived a very mean opinion of Henry's character from the report of his ind$$cretion and exce&s;s during the life of his father; and, when he de|manded the crow$ of France by his amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ent him a ca&s;k of tennis balls in der$$ion, as a pre&s;ent that implied his being better calcu$ated for that diver&s;ion, than for the maintenance of a war upon which the fate of kingdoms would depend. Henry was p$qued at this &s;ar$a&s;tic compliment; in an&s;wer to which, he declared, that when his balls &s;ho$ld be matched with racquets, he would play a game that would &s;hake the walls of the Louvre. The dauphin &s;oon changed $is opin$on of Henry's talents, when he perceived with what art and management he $$rried on his negotiations; and with what vigour, ca|pacity, and per&s;everance, he pur&s;ued the important de&s;ign which he had pro|jected. A$$$med at the re&s;olutions of the parliament of Leice&s;ter, and the preparations which Henry had begun to make for the pro&s;ecution of the war,
<PB N="257" REF="2590">
he, with the advice of the council, &s;ent over the &s;ecretary Col, with new of|fers, which he hoped would be accepted as a full and final &s;atisfaction; but he was di&s;appointed in his expectation. Henry, finding him&s;elf &s;upported by parliament, had rather ri&s;en than &s;unk in his demands: yet he &s;till continued to amu&s;e the French mini&s;try, in expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to &s;ee the di&s;pute ter|minated by negotiation$ $word$ to &s;hew that he had the treaty of marriage at heart, prolonged the time $word$ $$d fixed for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that affair, and even empowered his amba&s;&s;adors at Paris to protract it occa&s;ionally, as they &s;hould judge expedient.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XV.</HEAD>
<P>This tran&s;action, however, neither interrupted his mea&s;ures for in|vading France, nor hindered him fr$m treating with the duke of Burgundy, who was not &s;o &s;atisfied with the peace of Arras, but that he wi&s;hed to &s;ecure the alliance of Henry. Philip Morgan, an intelligent agent, whom the king of England employed in his mo&s;t important negotiations, was &s;ent to Flanders, on pretence of renewing the truce with the Flemings; but he had &s;ecret in&s;tructions to propo&s;e a league of a different nature: and the duke &s;ent an envoy to England, to manage his intere&s;t with Henry; though he he&s;i|tated with re&s;pect to the proffered alliance, as a &s;tep which he did not chu&s;e to take, unle&s;s he &s;hould be compelled by nece&s;&s;ity to throw him&s;elf into the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> arms of the Engli&s;h monarch. In the beginning of the year, Henry con|&s;ented<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1415.</NOTE> to a prolongation of the truce with France till the f$r&s;t day of May; and, in the interim, the French mini&s;try, being more and more &s;tartled at the expedition with which Henry prepared his armament, &s;ent over twelve amba&s;&s;a|dors, at the head of whom was the archbi&s;hop of Bourges, who, in all pro|bability, was empowered to make &s;ome new offer, which was rejected as the former; and all he could obtain was another &s;hort prolongation of the truce. While the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors re&s;ided at London$ Henry a$$embled a great council of the lords temporal and &s;piritual, and declared t$ them, by the mouth of his uncle the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, that he was $$&s;olved to invade France in per&s;on, in order to recover the inh$$itance of his ance&s;tors. This notification of a de&s;ign which all the kingdom already knew, was intended for extracting from the French amba&s;&s;adors the la&s;t terms they had to propo&s;e, which the king imagined they were ordered to &s;uppre&s;s, until matters &s;hould be brought almo&s;t to extremity. He did not doubt but that France would con&s;ent to a peace, according to the &s;tipulations of the treaty of Bretigny, rather than ha|zard a war during the di&s;tractions of the kingdom; and on the&s;e terms, he, in all probability, would have agreed to a &s;olid pacification. The archbi&s;hop perceived his drift; and, having no longer the lea&s;t room to doubt of his ho&s;|tile intention, de&s;ired he might be indulged with time to return to France for fre&s;h in&s;tructions: Henry granted his reque&s;t; and the truce was again pro|longed till the fifteenth day of July. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>By this time he had levied his army, and equipped a large fleet for tran&s;porting it to the continent. A large train of artillery was provided; Southampton was appointed the place of rendezvous. He had made a pro|gre&s;s through the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom, and arrayed the counties and the clergy. At Reading he publi&s;hed a proclamation, directed to all his &s;ubjects, importing that the money granted by parliament was not &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the &s;econd payment of his troops; and de&s;iring they would lend
<PB N="258" REF="2600">
him a &s;um of money upon &s;uch &s;ecurity as he &s;hould propo&s;e. Such was the eagerne&s;s o$ the nation, that he $ound him&s;elf amply &s;upplied and accommo|da$ed with al$ the money and nece&s;&s;aries that he wanted. The young earl of Northumberland being re&s;tored to his honours and e&s;tate, maintained forty m$n at arms, with one hundred and twenty archers: the &s;ame force was levied by the earl of We&s;tmoreland. The ea$$ of Su$$olk defrayed the ex|pence o$ $alf a &s;hip, twenty men at arms, and forty archers; and his example w$s followed by the lords Lovel, Berkeley, Darcy, Seymour, Roos, and Willoughby. Six men at arms and twenty archers were &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the lord Morley: the lords S$ales and Randolfe &s;erved without pay; and all the other nobility contributed in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition. Provi&s;ion was made for the defence of the Scotti&s;h and Wel&s;h Marches, as well as for tho&s;e of Calais; and the king's brother the duke of Bedford con|&s;tituted lieutenant of the kingdom in Henry's ab&s;ence, to be directed by a council, at the head of which was the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. The truce was almo&s;t expired, when the archbi&s;hop of Bourges returned; and Henry granted him a public audience at Winche&s;ter, &s;itting in his robes of &s;tate, and &s;urrounded by the princes of the blood, the prelates, and the nobility. The amba&s;&s;ador produced very re&s;pectful letters from the king of France, offering the prince&s;s Catherine, with a portion of eight hundred thou&s;and crowns, a larger &s;um than ever had been given on &s;uch an occa&s;ion before: but, this offer being coldly received, the amba&s;&s;ador agreed to an addition of fifty thou&s;and crowns, and the principality of Limoges. Henry, in con&s;ider|ation of the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, replied, that if the French court would fix a day for the departure of the prince&s;s, and the payment of the money, and deliver up the proffered places and provinces, he would prolong the truce for fifty days; during which a congre&s;s might be held for &s;ettling the articles of the peace: and, in the mean time, he would give &s;ecurity for re&s;toring the places to the crown of France, provided the treaty &s;hould not take effect. The am|ba&s;&s;ador declaring that his power did not extend &s;o far, the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, by the king's command, ob&s;erved, at his next audience, that the French court had been in&s;incere in all the negotiations; that their offers were not adequate to what the king of England had a right to demand; that they had infringed the treaty of Bretigny, contrary to all ju&s;tice and good faith; and that Henry now appealed to the &s;word and deci&s;ion of heaven. A decla|ration to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in writing under the great &s;eal, was delivered to the archbi&s;hop, who, being a prelate of an hot fiery di&s;po&s;ition, was &s;o pro|voked at the inflexibility of the Engli&s;h monarch, that he lo&s;t all patience. Forgetting his own character, he raved, blu&s;tered, and threatened in a very indecent manner; and even reproached Henry as a tyrant and u&s;urper. This un&s;eemly tran&s;port was overlooked with the mo&s;t contemptuous indifference: he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in peace; and Henry proceeded in his preparations with re|doubled<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$$ $$b.</NOTE> vigour.</P>

<P>When the truce expired, ho&s;tilities were commenced in Picardy, between the French forces and the garri&s;on of Calais, commanded by the ea$l of Warwick. The army and navy had been a&s;&s;embled at Southampton; and the king him&s;elf repaired to that place in order to embark, when he received $$timation of a con&s;piracy formed again&s;t his per&s;on by Richard earl of Cam|bridge,
<PB N="259" REF="2610">
brother to the duke of York, Henry lord Scrope of Ma&s;ham, trea&s;urer of England, and Sir Thomas Grey of Heton in Northumberland. The earl of Cambridge had married Anne Mortimer daughter to Roger earl of Marche, by Philippa daughter and heir of Lionel duke of Clarence, third &s;on of Edward III. &s;o that in right of this lady he was in blood nearer the crown than Henry. It was his ambition in all probability that projected this con&s;piracy, in hope that &s;hould the &s;cheme pro&s;per, he or his children might one day &s;ucceed to the throne, at the death of Mortimer earl of Marche, who had no i&s;&s;ue. The de&s;ign &s;eems to have been half formed, or rather a vague and di&s;tant pro&s;pect than a full concerted plan. There appears to have been an ab&s;urd incon&s;i&s;tency in their intention; for they purpo&s;ed to rai&s;e an army in Scotland, under the &s;tale pretence of Richard's being alive; and at the &s;ame time to crown Mortimer in Wales, as the legal heir of that monarch. They knew Mortimer was a young nobleman of weak intellects, who had often told Cambridge that his confe&s;&s;or daily importuned him to claim the crown as his inheritance; and they did not &s;uppo&s;e they &s;hould find any difficulty in prevailing upon him to countenance their de&s;ign. In the&s;e &s;entiments they exacted from him an oath of &s;ecre&s;y, and then communicated the plan they had projected in his favour. His fear immediately overcame his ambition: he de&s;ired they would give him time to con&s;ider their propo&s;al, and imparted their whole conver&s;ation to Henry. The con&s;pirators were immediately arre&s;ted and impri&s;oned in the ca&s;tle of South|ampton; to the con&s;table of which they confe&s;&s;ed their guilt, and &s;ubmitted to his maje&s;ty's mercy. Sir Henry Gray was tried and convicted on this evidence by a common jury. A commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued for judging the two noblemen by their peers. They pleaded guilty; and the earl of Cambridge wrote a peni|tent and pathetic letter to the king, imploring his forgivene&s;s and clemency. But mercy was not Henry's predominant virtue: the earl and knight were be|headed; and lord Scrope was hanged, drawn, and quartered as a traitor, ac|cording to the literal tenour of his &s;entence, becau&s;e his guilt was aggravated with ingratitude to the king, who had honoured him with particular marks of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>This affair delayed the king's departure till the fifteenth day of Augu&s;t, when he &s;ailed from the port of Southampton with &s;ix thou&s;and lances, four and twenty thou&s;and archers, and about twenty thou&s;and common infan|try, on board of a fleet con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen hundred ve&s;&s;els. After an ea$y pa&s;&s;age he landed at the mouth of the Seine in Normandy, about three leagues from Harfleur, the &s;iege of which he undertook without any interruption from the con&s;table d'Albret, who lay encamped at Rouen with a &s;trong army, in order to watch the motions of the Engli&s;h. Harfleur was &s;trongly fortified, and provided with a numerous garri&s;on, which made a very gallant defence, under the command of the lord E&s;touteville, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of the be&s;t officers in France. But Henry carried on his attacks with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, and plied his artillery with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that a con&s;iderable breach was made; and the be&s;ieged, finding it impracticable to maintain the place, capitulated on condi|tion of &s;urrendering, if not relieved by the Sunday after Michaelmas. A body of French troops, under the marechal l'I&s;le d'Adam, attempted to &s;uccour the town, but were defeated and repul&s;ed; &s;o that the term pre&s;cribed in the capi|tulation
<PB N="260" REF="2620">
being expired, the garri&s;on &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war; and Henry took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Har$$eur, which he peopled with an Engli&s;h colony. While his army was employed in repairing the $word$ of the place, he &s;ent a cha$lenge to the dauphin, propo&s;ing to decide $word$ $i&s;pute be|tween the two crowns in &s;ingle combat; but no regard was payed to his de$$ance. The r$duction of Harf$eur was a conque&s;t of grea$ importance, though it &s;carce attoned for the mortality which prevailed in the Engli&s;h army, which was $o wea$ened and dimini&s;hed by the dy&s;entery, that before Henry quitted Har|fleur, not above one fourth part of tho&s;e who$ he had brought from England r$mained fit for &s;ervice: nor was it confined to the comm$$ &s;oldiers, who, from their manner of living, are mo$$ &s;ubject to this di$$emper$ it had already proved fatal to the bi&s;hop of Norwich and the earl of Suffolk$ and the duke of Clarence, with the earl of Arundel, and many other officers of di&s;tinction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> were obliged to return to England, in hope of recovering in their native cli|ma$e. Henry was much mor$$fied at this di&s;tre&s;s of his people, which was the more unlucky as he expected to be attacked by the French, who were now in|du&s;tri$$$ly employed in a&s;&s;embling troops from all quarters. The&s;e con&s;idera|tions, with the approach of winter, would in all p$o$$$ility have determined the ki$g of England to return to his own dominions, had not part of his tran&s;|ports been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at his fir&s;t landing in France, and the remainder lately di&s;|per&s;ed by a tempe&s;t.</P>

<P>So &s;ituated, and finding it would be impracticable to winter at Har|fleur for want of provi&s;ion and forage, he, with the advice of his council, re|&s;olved to begin his march by land for Calais, and pa&s;s the Somme at the place, where it was forded by his great grandfather Edward III. This enterprize was rendered extremely difficult, by a long &s;u$$$&s;&s;ion of rainy weather which had &s;poiled the roads; but what &s;eemed to $word$ it quite impracticable, was the precaution of the enemy. Su&s;pecting th$$ $e entertained &s;ome &s;uch de&s;ign, they had broken down all the bridges, de&s;troyed the cau&s;eways, and wa&s;ted the country, &s;o that he could expect to find no &s;upply in his route, either of forage or provi&s;ion; and the con&s;table d'Albret was at hand with a choice body of troops to attend his motions, and harra&s;s him in his march by cutting off his detached parties. Henry was not ignorant of the&s;e circum&s;tances, and knew that the whole kingdom of France was in arms to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. He might have &s;tayed at Har$$eur, and been &s;upplied by &s;ea with provi&s;ion and other nece&s;&s;aries: he might have a&s;&s;embled a fleet that would have tran&s;ported his army to England, without the lea&s;t ri&s;que from the enemy: but he was in|flamed with ambition to rival the exploits of his ance&s;tors, who had triumphed at Crecy and Po$$iers, and undertook an expedition which even &s;ucce&s;s could<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> not ju&s;tify, and which &s;eems to have been the re&s;ult of ra&s;hne&s;s, ob&s;tinacy, and pre&s;umption. Having con&s;tituted his uncle the earl of D$r&s;et governor of Harfleur, and Sir John Fa&s;tolfe, his lieutenant, at the head of a garri&s;on $mounting to three thou&s;and men, he began his march towards the Somme with an army of twenty thou&s;and $o$diers, the greater part of which was weakened by &s;ick|ne&s;s. When he reached the ford of Blanquetaque, he found the pa&s;&s;age ren|dered impracticable, by &s;harp &s;takes driven into the bed of the river, and a &s;trong body of forces po&s;ted on the other &s;ide. He was not a little chagrined at this di&s;appointment, which would have i$duced any other general to
<PB N="261" REF="2630">
retreat to Harfleur: but Henry was one of tho&s;e heroes who are animated by difficulties; he re&s;olved to march farther up the river, until he &s;hould find an opportunity of cro&s;&s;ing; and this &s;cheme he executed in &s;pite of a thou&s;and dangers and difficulties. He &s;aw all the bridges broken down, all the pa&s;&s;es defended, and was &s;o harra&s;&s;ed by the enemy, that he could not &s;end off a de|tachment from the line of march, without running the ri&s;que of its being cut in pieces. His troops were afflicted with a dearth of provi&s;ion and total want of nece&s;&s;aries, which, added to their di&s;temper and the fatigues they underwent, would have driven them to de&s;pair, had not they been animated by the pre|&s;ence and example of their beloved monarch, who &s;hared in all their hard&s;hips, and encouraged them by his alacrity. Perhaps even the&s;e cordials would have failed at la&s;t, if his affairs had not taken a favourable turn from an incident which at fir&s;t had a very unfavourable a&s;pect. The con&s;table of France being reinforced by forty thou&s;and men at arms, and joined by all the princes and noblemen of the kingdom, except the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, a council of war was held, and they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to allow Henry to cro&s;s the Somme, and give him battle between that river and Calais. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, they withdrew their detachments from the pa&s;&s;es, and marched into the county of St. Pol, with a view to attack the king of England after he &s;hould have cro&s;&s;ed the river, &s;o that his retreat &s;hould be intirety cut off.</P>

<P>Henry, finding the pa&s;&s;es clear, forded the river between St. Quintin and Peronne, and advancing to Blagney, perceived the whole French army on the march towards Rou&s;&s;eauville and Agincourt, which lay in his route to Calais. He now &s;aw his difficulties increa&s;e, and began to repent of the ra&s;h|ne&s;s of his conduct. He found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of an enemy's country, during the &s;evere&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year, at the head of an handful of men, ex|hau&s;ted by di&s;temper and fatigue, de&s;titute of provi&s;ion and proper accommo|dation, while a prodigious army, amounting to one hundred thou&s;and fighting men, blocked up the pa&s;&s;age to the only place where he could expect to find &s;helter and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In this emergency he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the French con|&s;table, offering to re&s;tore Harfleur, and repair all the damage he had done to the French, nay even to give &s;ecurity that he would never again attempt to in|vade France, if they would allow him to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted to Calais. Such was the offer made by the Black Prince, when he found him&s;elf &s;urrounded at Poitiers; and the an&s;wer which Edward received was the &s;ame which they now returned to Henry; they rejected his offer, and propo&s;ed that he and his army &s;hould &s;ubmit at di&s;cretion. When he treated this propo&s;al with di&s;dain, they &s;ent three heralds to defy him to battle, leaving the time and place to his choice: he replied, that weakened and fatigued as he was, he would not &s;eek an engagement; but as he intended to continue his route to Calais, they might attack him when and where they &s;hould think proper to chu&s;e the &s;cene of action. Then they took po&s;t between Rou&s;&s;eauville and Agincourt, and gave him notice they would engage him on the twenty-fifth day of October. As he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1415.</NOTE> could not po&s;&s;ibly avoid an action, he accepted the challenge, and pre&s;ented the herald who brought it with a gratification of a rich robe and two hundred crowns.</P>

<P>During this interval of three days, he took all the precautions which the experience of the mo&s;t able commander could have dictated. He
<PB N="262" REF="2640">
procured for his &s;oldiers &s;uch refre&s;hments as the nature of their &s;ituation would afford: he ordered their weapons and armour to be refitted and repaired: he invented a kind of &s;harp &s;takes for the defence of the archers: he continued night and day upon hor&s;eback, riding through the lines to animate the &s;oldiers, and &s;uperintend the oeconomy of the camp: he encouraged the army with hope of &s;ucce&s;s, by reminding them of the great victories obtained in France by their forefathers; a&s;&s;uring them that the enemy, though numerous, were raw, undi&s;ciplined, and imprudent; and he gave them plainly to under|&s;tand, they had no re&s;ource from death or captivity, but in the extraordinary efforts of their own valour. His affability, activity, and confidence, in&s;pired the &s;oldiers with &s;uch re&s;olution and ardour, that far from dreading the num|ber of the foe, they wi&s;hed eagerly for the battle; and bore their di&s;tre&s;&s;es with heroic patience, in hope of being relieved by a &s;peedy victory. Indeed they &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of di&s;tinction in numbers; for, on the day that preceded the battle, David Gam, a Wel&s;h captain whom the king had &s;ent to ob&s;erve the po&s;ture of the enemy, being in$errogated by his maje&s;ty concerning the number of the French army, replied, with great compo&s;ure, that there was number enough to be killed, enough to be taken pri&s;oners, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit Liv. $word$.</NOTE> enough to run away. While Henry thus acted the part of an able and dili|gent commander, the French officers &s;pent their time in riot and rejoicing. When they con&s;idered the handful of Engli&s;h, who did not exceed fourteen thou&s;and en&s;eebled wretches, half dead with famine and di&s;ea&s;e, they looked upon the victory as having already declared in their favour. They are even &s;aid to have played at dice for the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners before they were taken, and to have &s;ent orders to the neighbouring villages to prepare lodging for tho&s;e &s;trangers: on the morning of the engagement, their in&s;olence and pre&s;umption ro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch, that they detached another herald to Henry, to know what he propo&s;ed to give for his ran&s;ome. This in&s;ult he received with the mo&s;t contemptuous moderation, de&s;iring the me&s;&s;enger to tell tho&s;e that &s;ent him, a little time would decide to whom the ran&s;om would belong.</P>

<P>On the day appointed for the deci&s;ion of this great conte&s;t, both armies were drawn up at break of day in order of battle; and the con&s;table D'Albret, who commanded the French, committed an error which was alto|gether inexcu&s;able, in chu&s;ing a narrow piece of ground, flanked by a rivulet and a thick wood, where he could not extend his front &s;o as to enclo&s;e the Engli&s;h; where his cavalry could not act, and his &s;uperiority of number, in|&s;tead of being an advantage, was an encumbrance and misfortune. He di|vided his army into three bodies, and $e him&s;elf commanded the van, accom|panied by the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts of Eu, Vendome, and Richemont, the famous marechal de Boucicaut, the great ma&s;ter of the cro&s;s|bows, the lord Dampierre admiral of France, the dauphin D'Auvergne, and &s;e|veral other officers of di&s;tinction. The &s;econd line was commanded by the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the duke of Bar, the counts of Vaudemont, Nevers, Sa|lines, Rou&s;&s;i, and Grand Pr&eacute;. At the head of the third body were the counts of Marle, Dampmartin, Faquenberg, and the &s;ieur de Lauroy. While the French were employed in arranging the&s;e lines, which &s;tood &s;o thick that the &s;oldiers had not room to u&s;e their weapons, Henry concealed four hundred lances in a wood upon the right, and about two hundred and fifty choice
<PB N="263" REF="2650">
archers on the left, in a low meadow covered with bu&s;hes. In order to extend his front equal to that of the enemy, he was obliged to form his little army into one line: the right wing commanded by the duke of York, with the lords Beaumont, Willoughby, and Stanhope, was advanced a little way before the center, which the king took under his own conduct, attended by his brother the duke of Glouce&s;ter, the earl Mare&s;chal, and the young earl of Suffolk, who&s;e father had died at Harfleur. The left, which may be denominated the rear, as it had not advanced &s;o far as the other two divi&s;ions, was left under the di|rection of the duke of Exeter; and nothing could be more prudent than this di&s;po&s;ition, which was made by the advice of Sir Thomas Erpyngham, a re|nowned &s;oldier, who acted as Henry's mar&s;hal, and was the per&s;on who after|wards gave the &s;ignal for the attack. The king him&s;elf appeared in the front of the line, mounted on a &s;tately white cour&s;er, in &s;plendid armour, with a golden crown fixed by way of cre&s;t to his helmet: four royal banners were di&s;played before him: he was followed by a great number of led hor&s;es in rich capari&s;ons, and &s;urrounded by the chief officers of his court and army. Whether the French generals were &s;tartled at the admirable di&s;po&s;ition, and the firm countenance of the Engli&s;h, or had received orders to avoid a battle, certain it is, they &s;tood in array, at the di&s;tance of two hundred and fifty paces, without proceeding to the attack; and the king of England began to imagine their intention was to &s;tarve him into a &s;urrender. This was the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e they could have taken; and mu&s;t have been attended with &s;ucce&s;s, had Henry continued inactive; for his provi&s;ions were already quite exhau&s;ted, and the weather was &s;o rainy that it would have been impracticable to keep the field much longer. Perceiving their drift, and con&s;cious of his own &s;itua|tion, he ordered the archers to &s;trike their &s;takes, which they planted by way of pali&s;adoes in the front and flank; &s;o that they could advance before and re|tire behind them occa&s;ionally. He rode along the line, exhorting and en|couraging the &s;oldiers to behave like Engli&s;hmen. Then, alighting from his hor&s;e, he took his &s;tation in the main body, and commanded Sir Thomas Erpyngham to throw up his truncheon as the &s;ignal for the attack. The whole line rai&s;ing a loud &s;hout, advanced again&s;t the enemy; but Henry fear|ing they would be out of breath before they could come to clo&s;e fight, ordered them to halt about mid-way, and there the archers planted their piquets, to &s;ecure them from the French cavalry. The battle was begun by a flight of arrows, which did great execution, becau&s;e the enemy &s;tood &s;o thick that every &s;haft took place, and even penetrated the armour of the French men at arms. The Engli&s;h bowmen had advanced beyond their &s;takes to make this general di&s;|charge; but &s;eeing the enemy's cavalry in motion to attack them, they re|tired within their pali&s;adoes with admirable order and dexterity, and plied the a&s;&s;ailants &s;o warmly, that they began to fall into confu&s;ion. The troops that lay in ambu&s;h on the right and left, charging them &s;uddenly in flank, completed the di&s;order; at the &s;ame time the archers &s;linging their bows, ru&s;hed out upon them with their battle-axes and daggers, and a terrible &s;laughter en&s;ued. Though this front line of the French con&s;i&s;ted of the be&s;t troops, animated by the pre&s;ence and example of &s;o many noblemen, and was commanded by the con&s;table in per&s;on, it could not &s;u&s;tain the impetuo$$ty of the attack, and being once di&s;ordered, all oppo&s;ition was at an end: far from
<PB N="264" REF="2660">
being able to rally, they had not room to turn, and were &s;o encumbered by one another, that they them&s;elves contributed to the victory of the Engli&s;h, who &s;laughtered them in heaps, until their arms were tired with the work of carnage. Though the con&s;table, with a great number of principal officers, was $$ain, and the fir&s;t line of the French entirely routed, the battle continued &s;t$$$ undecided; and the &s;econd line, commanded by the duke of Alencon, &s;tood firm and eager to engage. The Engli&s;h, who were fatigued with action, retiring behind the main body, to take breath and form them&s;elves anew, Henry in per&s;on led up his divi&s;ion to the charge, and being animated by the &s;ucce&s;s of his fir&s;t effort, added to his natural courage and vivacity, performed exploits of valour which equally a&s;toni&s;hed his own &s;oldiers and tho&s;e of the enemy.</P>

<P>While he thus exerted him&s;elf, in a manner that did much more honour to his per&s;onal prowe&s;s than to his conduct, eighteen French knights, who had engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation to take him dead or alive, made their way &s;word in hand to the place where he fought, and one of them &s;tunned him with the blow of his battle-ax, which, however, did not penetrate his helmet. In all probability he mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice to the determined re&s;olution of tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociates, had not David Gam the Wel&s;h captain, and two other of|ficers of the &s;ame nation, ru&s;hed between him and the a&s;&s;ailants, and lo&s;t their lives in his defence. When he recollected his &s;pirits, he found tho&s;e three gal|lant &s;oldiers dying of the wounds they had received, and knighted them as they lay upon the field of battle. The eighteen French knights were killed to a man; and Henry, &s;till more &s;timulated by the danger he had e&s;caped, ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the $word$ with redoubled impetuo&s;ity, until he and his brother Glouce&s;ter, who fought by his &s;ide, found them&s;elves quite &s;epa|rated from the troops they commanded. In this hazardous &s;ituation, Glou|ce&s;ter was felled to the ground by the &s;troke of a mace; and Henry covering him with his &s;hield, &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock of a whole ho&s;t of a&s;&s;ailants, until the duke of York came to his relief. At that very in&s;tant he received a blow upon the head, that made him &s;tagger and fall upon his knees; but he &s;prang up in a moment, and laid the aggre&s;&s;or at his fect. His troops, in&s;pired by his example to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, ru&s;hed forward as one man with irre|&s;i&s;table fury, which bore down all before them, and di&s;ordered the enemy in &s;uch a manner, that all the endeavours of their officers could not reduce them to form, or per&s;uade them to oppo&s;e the career of the Engli&s;h. The duke of Alen$on &s;eeing his divi&s;ion in danger of being totally defeated, re&s;olved to make one attack that &s;hould either re&s;tore the battle or &s;ave him the mortifica|tion of &s;urviving the di&s;grace of his country. He put him&s;elf at the head of &s;ome cho&s;en volunteers, and cutting his way to the &s;pot where Henry fought, exclaimed that he was the duke of Alencon; then ru&s;hing upon the Engli&s;h monarch, cleft his crown with the fir&s;t &s;troke of his &s;word: he had not an opportunity of repeating his blow; for Henry returned the &s;alutation in &s;uch a manner as brought him to the ground; and with his own hand &s;lew two of his followers. He endeavoured to &s;ave the life of Alen&ccedil;on; but the guards were &s;o exa&s;perated at his attempt, that they di&s;patched him immediately, be|fore the king could interpo&s;e effectually in his behalf. After the death of this nobleman, the French made no oppo&s;ition; but either endeavoured to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight, or voluntarily offered their throats to the &s;laughter.</P>

<P>The third line was &s;till intire, and much more numerous than the whole Engli&s;h army. They were fre&s;h and vigorous, while the victors fainted with the fatigue of the action, added to the weakne&s;s occa&s;ioned by their di&s;|temper, which was &s;o violent that they are &s;aid to have fought without breeches, to &s;ave the trouble of untru&s;&s;ing: but the third divi&s;ion of the French were &s;o intimidated by the di&s;a&s;ter of the other two lines, and the dreadful &s;cene of carnage acting before their eyes, that they refu&s;ed to obey the command of their generals, and, in&s;tead of advancing to the charge, retired from the field of battle: though they &s;till continued in a body, until Henry &s;ent an herald to declare that &s;hould they remain in that po&s;ture until he could come up with them, they &s;hould be all ma&s;&s;acred without mercy. Intimidated by this me&s;|&s;age, they di&s;per&s;ed, and left him intirely ma&s;ter of the field. He had not time to congratulate him&s;elf upon the victory, when he was informed that the enemy were in his rear, and already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his camp. Concluding they intended to renew the battle, he forthwith commanded all the pri&s;oners to be put to the &s;word, except tho&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed quality; and this inhuman order was punctually executed. He then marched towards the camp, and found it already plundered by a body of fugitives under the com|mand of Robert de Bournonville, who retired at his approach. Nothing now remaining to oppo&s;e his arms, he returned thanks to heaven in public for this extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s; and proclaimed that it &s;hould be a&s;cribed to no other but God alone. Then he commanded a French herald to declare to whom he thought the victory belonged; and he adjudging it to the Engli&s;h, the king a&s;ked the name of a ca&s;tle to which he pointed with his finger. Being informed that it was known by the name of Agincourt, "Henceforward then," &s;aid he, "this action &s;hall be named the battle of Agincourt." In this memorable battle, which began about ten in the morning and la&s;ted till three in the after|noon, the French lo&s;t the con&s;table d'Albret, the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, who was a prince of the blood, the duke of Brabant and count de Nevers, brothers to the duke of Burgundy, the duke de Bar, the counts of Vaudemont, Marle, Rou&s;&s;i, Faquenberg, &s;everal officers of great di&s;tinction, and about ten thou|&s;and &s;oldiers left dead upon the field. Among the pri&s;oners, who were very numerous before the ma&s;&s;acre, the Engli&s;h found the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts of Eu, Vendome, Richemont, E&s;touteville, the mare|chal de Boucicaut, and &s;ixteen hundred per&s;ons of di&s;tinction: but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;trelet.

<P>Henry, after having given orders touching the dead and wounded, marched back to Marcoucelly, where he had encamped the preceding night, that his troops might be more conveniently refre&s;hed, and next day proceeded on his route to Calais: when he pa&s;&s;ed by the field of battle, he took that op|portunity to commend his army for their gallant behaviour; but at the &s;ame time exhorted them to bear their good fortune with moderation, and attribute their &s;ucce&s;s to the God of battles, who had wrought a miracle in their favour. He treated the French pri&s;oners with all the politene&s;s of his great uncle the Black Prince, declaring that the victory was not owing to his &s;uperior valour, but to the immediate interpo&s;ition of providence, which had made u&s;e of them as an in&s;trument to puni&s;h the &s;ins of the French nation; and he a&s;&s;ured them,
<PB N="266" REF="2720">
that he was now more di&s;po&s;ed to peace than he had been immediately be|fore<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ P$$.</NOTE> the battle. Some days after his arrival at Calais, he received a me&s;&s;age from the duke of Burgundy, who challenged him to &s;ingle combat, that he might have an opportunity to revenge the death of his two brothers, who had been barbarou&s;ly ma&s;&s;acred by Henry's order on the field of Agincourt. The king, de&s;irous of preventing a rupture with a prince from who&s;e alliance he ex|pected great advantages, re&s;tored the duke's gauntlet to the herald, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him with a civil an&s;wer, importing that he had no hand in the death of his brothers, which was entirely owing to his own &s;ubject Robert de Bour|nonville, whom he de&s;ired him to puni&s;h for his treachery. The duke would have followed his advice, had not that plunderer been protected by his &s;on the count de Charol$is, to whom Bournonville pre&s;ented a curious &s;word adorned with diamonds, which he found among the baggage belonging to the king of England. About the middle of November, Henry embarked for England with his pri&s;oners, and after a dangerous pa&s;&s;age landed at Dover. From thence he proceeded to London, where he was received in triumph amid&s;t the acclamations of his people. The fir&s;t &s;tep he took was to appoint a day of religious thank&s;giving for the &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign: then he be&s;towed the mo&s;t honourable ob&s;equies on the duke of York and the earl of Suffolk; and the former of the&s;e noblemen was &s;ucceeded in his title and e&s;tate by Richard, &s;on of the earl of Cambridge, who had been beheaded at Southampton.</P>

<P>The battle of Agincourt produced no other advantage to Henry, but that of increa&s;ing the dome&s;tic troubles of France; for he had not gained a &s;ingle foot of land by his victory; and all the &s;poil and the ran&s;om was not &s;ufficient to defray the expence of the campaign: but he found his account in the divi&s;ions which that event renewed among the French princes. The duke of Burgundy &s;eized this opportunity to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in the admini&s;tration, from which he had been excluded by the treaty of Arras. He &s;aid, that at a time when the kingdom was threatened with de&s;truction, he, as a prince of the blood, and fir&s;t peer of France, had a title to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king with his ad|vice; and he re&s;olved to &s;upport his right with force of arms. For this pur|po&s;e he approached Paris at the head of an army: but the dauphin, though his own &s;on-in-law, oppo&s;ed his preten&s;ions with all his influence. That prince be&s;towed the office of con&s;table on the count of Armagnac, the duke's inveterate enemy, who pro&s;ecuted all the Burgundians with the utmo&s;t ran|cour; and this inflamed the two factions to &s;uch a degree, that they never could unite again&s;t the common enemy of the kingdom. The dauphin, who was at the head of the admini&s;tration, entered blindly into all the re&s;entments of the con&s;table, and utterly neglected all mea&s;ures that could contribute to the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of the affairs of the realm. In a few months he was taken off by poi&s;on, and then the con&s;table remained &s;ole ma&s;ter of the king's per&s;on and the government, till the return of John duke of Touraine, upon whom the title of dauphin devolved, and who at that time re&s;ided with his father-in-law the count of Hainault. Re&s;olving to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality, he &s;ent orders to both factions to lay down their arms. The duke of Burgundy, who had mi&s;carried in his attempt upon Lagny, obeyed his command, on pretence of pure deference, and retired to his own dominions: but the con&s;table was not &s;o pliable. Being ma&s;ter of the king's per&s;on, he did not think the dauphin had a right to
<PB N="267" REF="2730">
command him, until he &s;hould be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the regency, which the con&s;table determined to keep out of his reach, unle&s;s he would declare again&s;t the Bur|gundians. This oppo&s;ition of the con&s;table hindered the dauphin from returning to the kingdom. France could not po&s;&s;ibly take proper mea&s;ures for her own defence, while the duke of Burgundy negotiated privately with the king of England; while the duke of Hainault courted the favour of that monarch, that his &s;on-in-law the dauphin might be fixed in the regency; and while Lewis of Anjou, king of Sicily, who headed the faction of Orleans, had pro|jected a plan for depriving the dauphin of his birthright, that the crown might devolve upon Charles count of Ponthieu, who had married his daughter. All the&s;e princes thought they could not take a more effec$ual method to ac|compli&s;h their &s;everal aims, than that of having recour&s;e to the alliance of Henry; &s;o that all the princes of France, from different views, &s;ollicited the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> friend&s;hip of that king, again&s;t whom they ought to have united as the common enemy of their country.</P>

<P>Henry, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, &s;eemed to have<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1416.</NOTE> laid a&s;ide all thoughts of pro&s;ecuting the war, and turned his attention wholly to the bu&s;ine&s;s of negotiation. He was extremely de&s;irous of concluding an alliance with the duke of Burgundy; and for this purpo&s;e, agents were con|tinually pa&s;&s;ing a$d repa&s;&s;ing, between Flanders and England, on pretence of &s;ettling a treaty of commerce between the &s;ubjects of the two powers, who had $or many ages maintained an intercour&s;e of this nature. The duke &s;ought to conceal the true motives of this negotiation, le&s;t it &s;hould give umbrage to the Pari&s;ians who favoured his intere&s;t; and Henry did not chu&s;e that it &s;hould be known, le$t the court of France, being alarmed at the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a conjunction, &s;hould find means to fru&s;trate his de&s;ign, by a coalition with the duke of Burgundy. In the beginning of the year, the emperor Sigi&s;mund had arrived at Paris, on purpo&s;e, as he affirmed, to mediate a peace between the two crowns of France and England; and he was permitted to exerci&s;e acts of &s;overeignty, by pre&s;iding in the parliament of Paris, and creating a knight, as if he had a right of paramount over all the kings in Europe. He had pro|jected a truce for four years between the two crowns, which was rejected by the con&s;table: and finding his endeavours ineffectual at Paris, he repaired to England, with a view, if he could not mediate a peace between Charles and Henry, to form an alliance between him&s;elf and the Engli&s;h monarch; and this indeed &s;eems to have been the chief intent of his journey from his own dominions. He was brought over with his train from Calais in Engli&s;h bot|toms; but when he approached the &s;hore in a &s;haloupe, the duke of Glou|ce&s;ter, and &s;ome other noblemen, ru&s;hed into the &s;ea with their &s;words drawn, and &s;topped the ve&s;&s;el, to the no &s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment and terror of the emperor, who de&s;iring to know the meaning of &s;uch an extraordinary reception, the duke told him, that if he came with preten&s;ions to any right of &s;overeignty in England, they had orders from the king to prevent his landing; but i$ his &s;ole aim in coming was to act the part of a friend and peace-maker, he &s;hould be received with all the honours due to his imperial dignity. Sigi&s;mund a&s;&s;uring him that he was come in character of a mediator, they received him on &s;hore with marks of the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect; and he was magnificently entertained upon the road from Dover to London. Henry in per&s;on met him on Black-Heath,

<P>A$$er al$ th$&s;e ceremonies and rejoicings, Sigi&s;mund, in $word$ with W$$$iam of Bavaria, count of Holland and Zeal$nd, who had $span$ in England $or the &s;ame purpo&s;e, proceeded to the work of $word$ w$$ch th$y $$$nd more difficult t$an they had imagined it would $$$ve; f$r H$nry thinking he had a right to ri&s;e in his demands &s;ince the v$c$$ry of Agincou$t, in&s;i&s;ted upon hav$$g the town and territory of Har$leur added to t$e ce&s;&s;$$n of all the other places which had been given up to Edward by t$e treaty o$ Bretigny. This ob&s;truction being in&s;urmountable, they pro|p$$$$ a tr$ce $or t$ree years, during which Harfl$ur &s;hould remain as a de|$$&s;ite in their h$nds. The con&s;table &s;eemed to li&s;ten to this propo&s;ition, w$$ch was not di&s;$gree$ble to Henry; but, when every article was agreed, t$e Fr$nch $ri$$es who were pri&s;oners in England refu&s;ed to guarantee the treaty, which therefore did not take effect. The count of Armagnac had re|&s; $$ed to be&s;iege Harfleur, and amu&s;ed Henry with this negotiation, until he $$s ready to execute his de&s;ign. He had engaged with the Genoe&s;e for &s;ome large carr$cks, with a number of cro&s;s-bows, to join the French navy: he found &s;ome pretext for conveying king Charles to Rouen, that he him&s;elf might be at hand to &s;uperintend the operations; and took his mea&s;ures with &s;uch &s;ecrecy that Henry never dreamed of his intention. The earl of Dor&s;et, who commanded in Harfleur, made incur&s;ions to the very gates of Rouen, from whence he carried off a great booty, even whi$e the count re&s;ided in that city; and the con&s;table, with a body of choice troops, endeavoured to cut off his retreat. At fir&s;t he obtained &s;ome advantages; but, the Engli&s;h perceiv|ing his de&s;ign was to prevent their return to Harfleur, &s;ought $o de&s;perately, that though he greatly outnumbered them, they were ob$$ged to retreat with great precipitation. The Genoe&s;e carracks being arrived, and all the previous mea&s;ures taken, the con&s;table ordered his troops to a&s;&s;emble privately from the different quarters in which they had been di&s;per&s;ed, and putting him&s;elf at the head of a large army, inve&s;ted Harfleur by land, while the vi&s;count de Narbonne blocked it up by &s;ea in &s;uch a manner that no &s;upplies could enter the place.</P>

<P>Henry was confounded at this attempt; for he imagined France was not in a condition to undertake &s;uch an enterprize. He now plainly perceived him&s;elf a dupe to the con&s;table's negotiation; and he endeavour|ed to amu&s;e him in his turn. He expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t &s;incere inclination to peace, and propo&s;ed an interview with his cou&s;in, &s;o he now termed Charles, whom he had before di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of his Adver&s;ary of France. He hoped an interview would produce a truce, during which he might &s;uccour Harfleur, which was but indifferently provided. His propo&s;al of an interview being rejected, he &s;ent Morgan, as his envoy, to demand a truce, which the con&s;table did not think fit to grant at &s;uch a juncture. The&s;e attempts, however, did not hinder him from equipping an armament for the relief of Harfleur, which was &s;o vigorou&s;ly defended by the earl of Dor&s;et, that although the &s;iege began in the middle of June, the con&s;table had made very little progre&s;s at the end of July. Henry having a&s;&s;embled his forces and fleet, re&s;olved to embark in per&s;on; and it was with great difficulty that
<PB N="269" REF="2750">
the emperor at length di&s;&s;uaded him from engaging per&s;onally in an expedition, the &s;ucce&s;s of which depended as much upon the weather as upon the courage and conduct of the commander. He &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per&s;uaded; and de|legated the chief command to his brother the duke of Bedford, who &s;et &s;ail about the fifteenth day of Augu&s;t, with a fleet of four hundred &s;hips, having on board twenty thou&s;and land forces under the conduct of the earls Mare&s;chal, Oxford, Huntingdon, Warwick, Arundel, Sali&s;bury, and Devon&s;hire. The duke directed his cour&s;e to the mouth of the Seine, where the French and Genoe&s;e f$eet lay ready to receive him; and here an ob&s;tinate engagement en&s;ued. The enemy's g$llies being provided with oars, were more ea&s;ily wrought and floated in &s;hallower water than the Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els; and the Genoe&s;e cro&s;s-bow men were counted the be&s;t marines in the world. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ad|vantages, when they came to clo&s;e quarters, the Engli&s;h boarded them with great intrepidity, and fought with &s;uch fury that the enemy were entirely defeated. Two thou&s;and of their be&s;t men were &s;lain, &s;even of their large&s;t &s;hips &s;unk in the engagement, four taken, and &s;everal driven by the victors on the coa&s;t, where they peri&s;hed. The duke of Bedford having thus cleared the mouth of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul. Aemil.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the duke of Burgundy continued to carry on his private negotiations with Henry under various pretexts; &s;ome|times pretending to renew the truce between England and Flanders; and &s;ome|times to con&s;ult about the affairs of the church, depending in the council of Con&s;tance. The duke of Burgundy &s;till he&s;itated between his duty and what he apprehended to be his intere&s;t. As a prince of the blood-royal of France and fir&s;t peer of the realm, he could not conclude an alliance with England, without acting in diametrical oppo&s;ition to his honour and his duty, and even di&s;obliging his own parti&s;ans: he therefore &s;pun out the negotiation, without any de&s;ign of concluding the alliance, except in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, until the beha|viour of the con&s;table provoked him to throw him&s;elf into the arms of England. As the dauphin &s;till re&s;ided with his father-in-law at the court of Hainault, the duke of Burgundy re&s;olved, in the mean time, to &s;trengthen his intere&s;t by a league with that young prince, who was excluded from his father's court by the power and intrigues of the con&s;table. They had an interview at Valen|ciennes, where it was agreed, that the dauphin &s;hould try once more by fair means to obtain admittance to his father's court and councils, that he might acquire that rank and influence in the admini&s;tration, to which he was intitled by his birth and expectations; that &s;hould the attempt &s;ucceed, the duke of Burgundy &s;hould be invited to court; but in ca&s;e of its failure, they &s;hould take other mea&s;ures for di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the con&s;table, and &s;etting the king at li|berty from the re&s;traint in which he lived. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, the dauphin and his father-in-law repaired to Compeigne, from whence the count of Hainault went by him&s;elf to Paris, with a view to negotiate the demands of the dauphin, and the return of the duke of Burgundy. But he had no &s;ooner mentioned the name of this nobleman, than he was interrupted by the con&s;ta|ble, who declared that the dauphin &s;hould never be received at court, until he &s;hould have renounced all connexion with the duke of Burgundy. The count of $ainault, provoked at his pre&s;umption, could not help dropping &s;ome me|nacing
<PB N="270" REF="2760">
hi$$s, implying that his &s;on-in-law would be obliged to do him&s;elf ju&s;|tice, by means of the duke's power and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, in order to prevent &s;uch effor$s, the court of France re&s;olved to rid their hands of the dauphin, who, in a few days after this conference, died by poi&s;on at Compeigne. He was &s;uc|ceeded in the title of dauphin by his younger brother Charles count of Pon|thieu, &s;on-in-law to the king of Sicily, who was &s;u&s;pected of having effected<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> the death of John, whom he him&s;elf did not long &s;urvive.</P>

<P>Charles, who was now pre&s;umptive heir of the crown, declared in $avour of the Armagnac faction; and the con&s;table was more than ever con|firmed in the po&s;t of mini&s;ter. His hatred to the duke of Burgundy induced him to &s;eize every opportunity to per&s;ecute that prince's adherents, who were very numerous at Paris, until they could no longer endure his tyranny and ru|pacious di&s;po&s;ition; and then they projected a &s;cheme for introducing their chief into the city. The con&s;piracy was di&s;covered; and the count d'Armagnac wreaked his vengeance upon the whole party of the Burgundians, in &s;uch a bar|barous manner, as incen&s;ed the duke to an eager de&s;ire of making repri&s;als upon the count's adherents. All his &s;cruples now yielded to his re&s;entment. He publicly concluded a truce with Henry for all his dominions, comprehending even tho&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in France; and by his emba&s;&s;adors at the court of Eng|land, agreed to an interview with that prince at Calais, where he promi&s;ed to do him homage as lawful king of France and his liege &s;overeign. Mean while the emperor having tried in vain to effect an accommodation between the two crowns, concluded a perpetual alliance with Henry, whom he promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in recovering the kingdom of France; and the Engli&s;h monarch engaged to &s;up|port him in obliging Charles and &s;ome other princes to do him homage for cer|tain<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> countries which, as he alledged, were fiefs of the empire. This treaty was &s;igned at Canterbury in his way to Dover, where he embarked for Calais, pur|po&s;ing to &s;tay at that place for Henry, who had agreed to meet the duke of Burgundy in the beginning of October. The court of France, alarmed at the report of this interview, &s;ent thither the archbi&s;hop of Rheims and &s;ome other emba&s;&s;adors, on pretence of treating about an accommodation: though the real de&s;ign of their journey was to di&s;cover what &s;hould pa&s;s at the interview. Henry perceived their drift, and had no objection to their being witne&s;&s;es of the duke's arrival at Calais; he therefore immediately complied with the reque&s;t of the French court, when they demanded &s;afe-conducts, and appointed com|mi&s;&s;ioners to treat with them upon the &s;ubject of their propo&s;als: but he took &s;uch pre$autions, that they could not, with all their art, dive into the true na|ture of his tran&s;action with the duke of Burgundy, who&s;e pretence for meeting Henry was to confirm and ratify the truce already publi&s;hed at London.</P>

<P>The king of England cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea about the latter end of September, granted a &s;afe-conduct to the duke of Burgundy and his retinue, amounting to eight hundred hor&s;emen; and &s;ent his brother the duke of Glou|ce&s;ter to St. Omers, there to remain as an ho&s;tage for the &s;afety of the duke's per&s;on. Thus &s;ecured, he arrived at Calais, where he was received with great magnificence; and &s;ub&s;cribed and &s;wore to the following articles, which had been preconcerted between their re&s;pective agents and emba&s;&s;adors: The king having explained to the duke of Burgundy his right and title to the crown of France, and his intention to obtain by force of arms, the &s;atisfaction which his
<PB N="271" REF="2770">
adver&s;ary has hitherto refu&s;ed, the duke promi&s;es to give his letters patent to the following effect: That although, for want of information, he had hitherto adhered to the contrary party, which he thought was in the right, yet now being better informed, he promi&s;es henceforth to be firmly attached to the king of England, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as true and lawful kings of France, in the &s;ame manner as if they were actually in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown: Although for the pre&s;ent the king does not exact homage from the duke, neverthele&s;s the &s;aid duke acknowledges it to be due; and promi&s;es that as &s;oon as Henry &s;hall be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any con&s;iderable part of France, he will do him liege homage, and take the oath of allegiance, as any other va&s;&s;al of the crown of France ought to do to his &s;overeign: The duke of Burgundy likewi&s;e pro|mi&s;es to pur&s;ue all the means and u&s;e all the methods which have been &s;ecretly &s;tipulated, for putting the king of England in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom of France: While the king is employed in the pro&s;ecution of his ju&s;t rights, the duke of Burgundy &s;hall make war with all his might upon Henry's enemies in the kingdom of France; namely A. B. C. D. and all their territories and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, who &s;hall prove di&s;obedient to the king of England: In all the al|liances or letters patent concluded and ratified between the king and the duke, in which the &s;aid duke may have excepted the king's adver&s;ary or his &s;on, he does not under&s;tand that &s;uch exception &s;hall prejudice his engagements to the king, which &s;hall be punctually fulfilled: If the duke, from political views, may have made &s;ome exceptions in favour of the &s;aid adver&s;ary and his &s;on, he wills and under&s;tands, that all &s;uch exceptions &s;hall be null and void, and of no value. The&s;e articles were reduced to the form of letters patent, written and &s;igned by the duke's own hand, &s;ealed with his privy &s;eal; and both he and his &s;on the count of Charolois, &s;olemnly &s;wore that they &s;hould be punctually performed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry having gained a con&s;iderable point by this alliance, which reflects eternal di&s;grace upon the duke of Burgundy and his &s;on, as traitors to their country, concluded a truce with France till the &s;econd day of February, and returned to England, fully determined to recommence the war with re|doubled vigour. The parliament meeting on the nineteenth day of October, the chancellor gave them to under&s;tand, that all the king's intentions had been fru&s;trated by the pride and pre&s;umption of the enemy; and that, &s;eeing the di&s;pute mu&s;t be appealed to the &s;word, he had concluded treaties of alliance with the emperor and other German princes, of which, however, he could not avail him&s;elf without the &s;upport of his parliament, who&s;e advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance he craved accordingly. The members were &s;o well plea&s;ed with his character and declaration, that they granted two whole tenths and two fifteenths; while the clergy voted two tenths to be rai&s;ed from their own body. In the mean time, as this &s;upply could not produce ready money for pre&s;ent &s;ervice, they voted indemnification to all per&s;ons who &s;hould accommodate the king for his pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions before the &s;ub&s;idies could be levied. Then the king pub|li&s;hed a general pardon for all crimes, $except &s;uch as were capital; and created the earl of Dor&s;et duke of Exeter, in con&s;ideration of his gallant defence of Harfleur. Notwith&s;tanding the parliament's liberality, and the convenience of the loan for which they had given &s;ecurity, the &s;upplies proved in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer the mighty views of Henry, who had re&s;olved to take a body of foreign

troops into his &s;ervice, and pay &s;ub&s;idies to &s;ome German princes, who&s;e $riend$hip or neutrality he thought it his intere&s;t to &s;ecure. To an&s;wer the&s;e demands, he mortgaged all his own valuable effects: the crown he wore, upon the days of ceremony, was pledged with his uncle the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; and he pawned his jewels to the mayor of London.</P>

<P>The court of France, &s;tartled at Henry's preparations, revolved every mea&s;ure they could divert to retard his expedition. The con&s;table knew that any propo&s;itions coming from him would be deemed in&s;incere at the $$urt of England; and, therefore, he concerted a &s;cheme with the French n$b$emen who were pri&s;oners at London. In con&s;equence of his in&s;tructions, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, with the counts of Eu and Vendome, p$$$end$ng to look upon the affairs of France as de&s;perate, took occa&s;ion to $word$ to the Engli&s;h courtiers, that they were di&s;po&s;ed to treat with the king for them&s;elves in particular; and they imagined that Henry would break the ice, and make advances to them on this &s;ubject. But, he payed very little regard to their overtures, which he ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed were calculated to divert him from his purpo&s;e; and they being di&s;appointed in this expectation, at length demanded an audience, in which they de&s;ired to know his preten&s;ions, that they might deliberate with them&s;elves, whether or not they could in honour<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1$1$.</NOTE> comply with his propo&s;als. Henry told them plainly, that he had no other propo&s;al to make, but that they &s;hould acknowledge him as king of France, and their lawful &s;overeign: a declaration &s;o di&s;agreeable, that the duke of Or|leans told the king, there was no an&s;wer to be made to &s;uch a demand; and nothing farther pa&s;&s;ed at this conference. In a few weeks after this audience, the duke of Bourbon gave Henry to under&s;tand, that, by means of certain per|&s;ons &s;ent to France to make inquiry about the nature of his maje&s;ty's preten|&s;ions, he and the other pri&s;oners had received new lights; and that, for his own part, he was perfectly convinced of Henry's ju&s;t title to the crown, which he claimed by right of inheritance: but, that as his maje&s;ty was willing to de|&s;i&s;t from that claim, in con&s;ideration of certain provinces which he demanded, it was the &s;entiment of him, and all the pri&s;oners, that the French court &s;hould comply with his demands; and that they were re&s;olved to employ all their power and influence towards his &s;atisfaction. He therefore a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion to go to France, where he would, in the name of him&s;elf and fellow-pri&s;oners, exhort the king to embrace &s;uch rea&s;onable propo&s;als; and &s;hould their advice be rejected, they would deem them&s;elves ab&s;olved from their allegiance to Charles. The duke engaged for him&s;elf in particular, to put all his places in the hands of governors devoted to his intere&s;t; to return to England at any time the king &s;hould pre&s;cribe, and do him homage as his lawful &s;overeign. But, in the mean time, he begged his maje&s;ty would not divulge his propo&s;als until he &s;hould return, that he might not be expo&s;ed to the re&s;entment of the French court, during his re&s;idence in that country. Tho' Henry &s;till doubted the duke's &s;incerity, he was &s;o agreeably flattered with the pro&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;o many fair provinces, without ri&s;que or expence, that he complied with Bourbon's reque&s;t: but he did not intermit a moment in his preparations. The duke &s;tayed &s;ome time in France, but performed no part of his engage|ments to Henry, who was &s;o piqued at the attempt to impo&s;e on him, that when the duke returned to England, he and his fellow-pri&s;oners were con|fined

The king incapable of managing the reins of government; the duke of Burgundy, fir&s;t peer of the realm, and head of a powerful party, engaged in &s;ecret alliance with the enemy of his country; the other princes of the blood pri&s;oners in Eng|land; and the kingdom governed by a young prince of fourteen years of age, under the guidance of the count d'Armagnac, a nobleman of the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ions, who knew no gratification equal to that of revenge, and openly &s;a|crificed the public good to his re&s;entment and ambition. Henry was not a prince to neglect &s;uch a favourable opportunity of executing the great de&s;igns he had projected. He ordered his navy to be equipped, and his army to ren|dezvous at Southampton, by the fourteenth of February. There they a&s;&s;em|bled, to the number of about eight and twenty thou&s;and men, the flower of the Engli&s;h &s;oldiery, better armed and appointed than any other troops in the world, and commanded by officers of birth, experience, and di&s;tinction. Be|fore the king embarked, he &s;ent the earl of Huntingdon, with a &s;quadron, to &s;cour the channel, where he fell in with nine large Genoe&s;e &s;hips, in the &s;ervice of France, which he engaged and defeated, after having &s;unk three, and taken the like number, on board of which was the ba&s;tard of Bourbon, admiral of France, with half a year's pay for the whole French navy: the&s;e Huntingdon brought in triumph to the harbour of Southampton.</P>

<P>Henry having appointed the duke of Bedford regent of the kingdom, embarked at Port&s;mouth on the twenty-third day of July, and landed on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t at Beville in Normandy. The fir&s;t place he inve&s;ted was the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Touque, which &s;urrendered on the ninth day of the month; and the reduction of this place was followed by that of Dam|bierres, which &s;ubmitted to the earl of Sali&s;bury. By this time the duke of Burgundy had penetrated to the heart of France. The imperious di&s;po&s;ition of the con&s;table, the death of the two dauphins, which was imputed to his treachery, and the exile of the queen, whom he had per&s;uaded the dauphin to bani&s;h from Paris to Tours, furni&s;hed the duke with a plau&s;ible pretext for making a diver&s;ion in favour of the Engli&s;h monarch. He publi&s;hed a mani|fe&s;to again&s;t the con&s;table, in which he exaggerated his vices and mi&s;conduct: then he wrote to the king, &s;ignifying, that, as fir&s;t peer of the realm, he could not help endeavouring to prevent the total ruin of the nation; and, finding that &s;ome towns of con&s;equence declared in his favour, he began his march, at the head of an army, for Paris, hoping that the dauphin and con&s;table would either abandon that city, in order to oppo&s;e the Engli&s;h, or be obliged to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of oppo&s;ition to the progre&s;s of Henry. This la&s;t part of the alternative was what they cho&s;e, as being much more willing to &s;ee part of the kingdom conquered by the public enemy, than the government wre&s;ted out of their hands by their private adver&s;aries. For this rea&s;on, Henry met with no oppo&s;ition in the field; tho' the city of Caen, which he be&s;i$ged, made a vigorous defence for &s;ome time, until the walls, being undermined, he ef|fected a breach in two different parts, and took the place by &s;torm. After having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city, he convened the principal inhabitants in the town-hall, commanded them to deliver up their arms, and then ordered

<P>The French court, &s;eeing their affairs almo&s;t de&s;perate, had recour&s;e again to negotiation, and de&s;ired that conferences might be opened for an accommodation. Henry a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al, without interrupting the progre&s;s of his arms, and appointed the earl of Warwick, and &s;ome others, as amba&s;&s;adors, to treat with the archbi&s;hop of Rheims, chief of the French $$enipotentiaries, at Bernonville in Normandy. But the&s;e conferences cea&s;ed in a very little time; for, in the beginning of the congre&s;s, the Engli&s;h envoys declared, that Henry would abate nothing of the following propo&s;itions: That the king of England &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Catherine: That king Charles &s;ho$$d enjoy the crown for life; but that, after his death, it &s;hould devolve upon t$e king of England; and, in the mean time, as Charles was incapable of go|verning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Henry &s;hould act as regent of France. As the French plenipoten|$$aries $ad not power &s;ufficient to treat upon the&s;e articles, the conferences pro|$$ced $word$ effect, and the Engli&s;h pur&s;ued their operations.

<P>While Henry was employed in the &s;iege of Cherbourg, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. C$$ $word$</NOTE> court of France underwent a new revolution: the council of Con&s;tance, after having depo&s;ed three pretended popes, had at length elected the cardinal Co|lonna, who a&s;&s;umed the name of Martin V. and this pontiff, immediately after his elevation, &s;ent two legates to France, to reconcile the two factions of that nation. The&s;e agents were &s;o pre&s;&s;ing in their &s;ollicitations, that both parties &s;ent deputies to Montereau-faute-yonne, where, after warm di&s;putes and alter|cation, it was agreed, that the dauphin, and the duke of Burgundy, &s;hould govern the kingdom conjunctly, during the prevalence of the king's di&s;order. But this convention was fru&s;trated by the intrigues of the con&s;table, who could not endure the thought of the duke's being at the head of the admini&s;tration. The violent oppo&s;ition which the count d'Armagnac made to this agreement, which was the mea&s;ure that bade faire&s;t for the advantage of the kingdom, ex|cited a clamour again&s;t him through the whole nation, and particularly in Paris, which had always favoured the cau&s;e of Burgundy. The inhabitants, who adhered to that faction, held &s;everal con&s;ulations in private: they, at length, found means to introduce, by night, Li&s;le d'Adam, governor of Pontoi&s;e, one of the duke's mo&s;t zealous parti&s;ans, who entered the city with eight hun|dred hor&s;e; and the Pari&s;ians, immediately taking up arms, made a terrible ma&s;&s;acre among tho&s;e that wi&s;hed well to the Armagnac intere&s;t. Tanneguy de Ch&acirc;tel, governor of the Ba&s;tile, finding it impracticable to quell this in|&s;urrection, ran directly to the Louvre, and, &s;eizing the dauphin in his &s;hirt, conveyed him to his fortre&s;s, from whence he, the next day, retired to Melun, becau&s;e he did not think him&s;elf &s;afe in the Ba&s;tile, from the rage of the popu|lace, who &s;ecured the king's per&s;on, and committed the con&s;table to pri&s;on. Tho&s;e who had been exiled from Paris, on account of their attachment to the duke of Burgundy, no &s;ooner heard of this tran&s;action, than they returned from all quarters, and inflamed the people with redoubled rage again&s;t their adver&s;aries. The ma&s;&s;acre was renewed on the twelfth day of June, when the con&s;table was brought from pri&s;on, and murthered in the &s;treet, through which his body was dragged with the utmo&s;t indignity; and his creature the chancellor, &s;everal bi&s;hops, and others, amounting to the number of two thou|&s;and, fell &s;acrifices to the &s;ame unbridled barbarity. When the&s;e tumults &s;ub|&s;ided, the queen and the duke of Burgundy repaired to that city, which they entered in triumph; and, having the king in their power, i&s;&s;ued whatever edicts, or orders, they thought might be conducive to their own intere&s;t; while the dauphin, who likewi&s;e a&s;&s;umed the title of regent, threatened all tho&s;e who &s;hould obey the duke of Burgundy: &s;o that the parti&s;ans of each faction were treated as rebels by the other; and even a neutrality was ac|counted criminal. To the&s;e di&s;tractions, if we add the progre&s;s of a conquer|ing enemy in the bowels of the country, and a dreadful plague that ravaged the city of Paris, every reader mu&s;t own, that the condition of France was truly wretched. <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE></P>

<P>This revolution in the court of France, was, at fir&s;t, favourable to $span$ I he new count of Armagnac, the lord of Albret, and $span$ of the &s;ame party, who had been very active again&s;t $span$ now $ound it their intere&s;t to conclude a truce, by $span$ from a very trouble&s;ome diver&s;ion, and enabled to $span$ that country, with which he $word$ his army in $span$ after a &s;iege of three months, had capitulated; and Pont $span$ almo$t without opposition: &s;o that the city of Rouen $span$ of Henry's de&s;ire in Normandy; and he re&s;olved to under his com$nion. This was an enterprize of great difficulty, as $span$ and defended by a garri&s;on of four thou&s;and $span$ about $eventy thou&s;and inhabitants, fit for $ervice. Guy de $span$ who commanded in the place, turned out all the u&s;e$$&s;s mouths, $word$ in a great quantity of provi&s;ions, cleared the ditches, and made all the preparations for a vigorous defence. Henry having &s;ummoned him to &s;ur|render, and received for an&s;wer, that he would hold out to the la&s;t extremity, ordered the town to be inve&s;ted on all &s;ides; and, in the di&s;po&s;itions he made for this purpo&s;e, took &s;uch precautions as might &s;erve for a model to a mo|dern engineer. The be&s;ieged made a great number of &s;allies, but were conti|nually repul&s;ed with lo&s;s; 'till, at length, they were &s;o hampered, by his lines of circumva$lation, that they dur&s;t not venture to come forth, and all commu|nication with the Seine being cut off, both above and below the town, they began to feel the mi&s;eries of want. Then they addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the duke of Burgundy for &s;uccour. That prince followed the maxims of his predece&s;&s;or and antagoni&s;t, the count of Armagnac, and was much more intent upon main|taining him&s;elf again&s;t the practices of his private enemies, than upon oppo&s;ing the progre&s;s of the king of England. He employed, however, the pope's legate to u&s;e their endeavours with Henry to relinqui&s;h the &s;iege of Rouen; and the cardinal d'Ur&s;ini repaired to the Engli&s;h camp, and offered him&s;elf as a mediator; but Henry perceived his drift, and lent a deaf ear to all his pro|po&s;itions.</P>

<P>Then the duke a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, and pretended he would give battle to the Engli&s;h. On this pretence, he conveyed the king as far as Beauvois; but attempted nothing further again&s;t the enemies of his country. By this time, in all probability, he had altered his &s;entiments with regard to the king of England, becau&s;e his revenge was now &s;atiated with the blood of the con&s;table and his adherents; &s;o that he had no further occa&s;ion for Henry's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and his affection for his own country and family recurring, he could not be well plea&s;ed to &s;ee the mo&s;t inveterate enemy of France in the heart of the kingdom which he him&s;elf governed. On the other hand, he was obliged to keep mea&s;ures with Henry, who had it in his power to de&s;troy all the duke's po|pularity, by publi&s;hing the &s;ecret treaty of alliance, which would have ren|dered him odious to all his countrymen. Thus &s;ituated, he had ob&s;erved a kind of equivocal conduct &s;ince his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in the mini&s;try, and &s;eemed to be perfectly neutral in every thing that concerned Henry's &s;ucce&s;s or ope|rations. The be&s;ieged, de&s;pairing of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, had recour&s;e to the dauphin, who was not in a condition to rai&s;e the &s;iege by force of arms; and, therefore, attempted it by the method of negotiation. Whether he was really inclined
<PB N="277" REF="2830">
to conclude a la&s;ting peace with Henry, as he pretended, or only endeavoured to amu&s;e him with a treaty; certain it is, he made overtures to the Engli&s;h monarch, and even expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of treating, not only concerning the peace with France, and the match between Henry and Catherine, but al&s;o about an alliance between the king of England and the dauphin, again&s;t the duke of Burgundy. Henry, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to widen the breach between the dauphin and the duke, li&s;tened to the propo&s;al, in a congre&s;s, with plea&s;ure, and appointed the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the earls of Warwick and Sali&s;|bury, Philip Morgan, and &s;everal other able negociators, his amba&s;&s;adors, to treat with the dauphin's plenipotentiaries. On this occa&s;ion, Henry acted the part of a crafty politician, rather than of a di&s;intere&s;ted hero; for, on the very day that he &s;igned the in&s;tructions of tho&s;e amba&s;&s;adors, he wrote a let|ter to the duke of Burgundy, a&s;&s;uring him, that if the negotiation for peace &s;hould be renewed, he would do all that lay in his power to bring it to a happy i&s;&s;ue. This declaration induced the mini&s;ter to appoint the bi&s;hops of Arras and Beauvois, the fir&s;t pre&s;ident de Morvillers, and &s;ome others, plenipo|tentiaries to negotiate the accommodation. Thus the king of England, by treating with both parties at one time, imagined he &s;hould manage their mu|tual jealou&s;y, in &s;uch a manner, as would tend to his own advantage. The conference between the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, and tho&s;e of the dauphin, were opened on the twenty-&s;ixth day of November, at Alen&ccedil;on, where the former declared, they would not treat of the match until the articles of the peace &s;hould be adju&s;ted. Then they in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing the utmo&s;t offers the French envoys had power to make; and, after numberle&s;s arts and eva&s;ions practi&s;ed by the dauphin's agents, under&s;tood that he was willing to give up the towns and provinces ceded to England by the treaty of Bretigny, on con|dition of Henry's doing homage for them to the crown of France. The En|gli&s;h rejected the propo&s;al concerning homage, and demanded Normandy, as an addition to the other provinces: they likewi&s;e de&s;ired to know, what &s;ecu|rity the dauphin could give for the execution of the treaty; and the French amba&s;&s;adors, having no power to treat on the&s;e &s;ubjects, the conferences proved abortive. This negotiation was hardly at an end, when the amba&s;&s;a|dors of the two crowns began another at Pont de l'Arche, under the mediation of the pope's legate: but this was interrupted almo&s;t as &s;oon as begun, by a frivolous punctilio, which plainly proved, that the duke of Burgundy was not in earne&s;t. The plenipotentiaries of Charles demanded, that the writings &s;hould be engro&s;&s;ed in the French language; and the Engli&s;h refu&s;ed to comply with the propo&s;al: in vain did the legates recommend a medium, and advi&s;e, that there &s;hould be two copies written, one in French, and the other in Latin; an expedient to which Henry con&s;ented: the duke of Burgundy was inflexible; and the end of the congre&s;s was fru&s;trated. Neverthele&s;s, it did not fail to alarm the dauphin, who, being ignorant of the particulars of the tran&s;action, apprehended a peace between Henry and the duke of Burgundy, which could not but be to his prejudice: he therefore intreated Henry to ap|point a place for renewing the negotiation begun at Alen&ccedil;on; and the king of England finding his account in blowing the coals of di&s;&s;ention, agreed to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Louviers, in the beginning of February. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The$e po$itical mea&s;ures did not at all affect his warlike opera|tions. The &s;iege of Rouen had la&s;t$d from July to January, and the be&s;ieged, a$ter having m$de a noble de$ence, were reduced to the utmo&s;t extremities; they h$d eaten up all their hor&s;es and dome&s;tic animals, including even rats, $word$ and v$rmin. They had turned out above twenty thou&s;and mi&s;erable wr$tches, men, women, and children, whom Henry wou$d not allow to pa&s;s, b$t drove back to the walls, under which they lay expiring in heaps, the victims of cold and hunger. At length tho&s;e that remained within the town, re$o$ved to make one de&s;perate effort in a general $ally, and endeavoured to $$t th$ir way through the line$ of the be&s;iegers. Ten thou&s;and men were c$$$en for this attempt; but when two thou&s;and of the number had pa&s;&s;ed t$e bridge, it gave way; and this accident prevented their being joined by their companions. That handful, however, &s;eeing their return cut off, attacked the be$iegers with incredible $ury, and fought until the greater part of them was c$t in pieces; while tho&s;e that remained at the other end of the bridge, $word$ from another gate, and made good their retreat, though not without great lo&s;s and difficulty. During this &s;iege and blockade, above fifty thou&s;and of the inhabitants had peri&s;hed by the &s;word, by famine, and di&s;temper; and the $$rvivors &s;eeing nothing before them but the like mi&s;ery or &s;laughter, &s;ent deputies to Henry to &s;ollicit terms of capitulation; but he in&s;i&s;ted upon their &s;$rrendering at di&s;cretion. Tho&s;e deputies could not help upbraiding him with his crue$ty in reducing them by famine, when he had &s;uch a fair opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing his valour in taking it by a&s;&s;ault; and he was not a little pro|voked by their reproach. When they reported his inflexibility and imperious behavio$r to their fellow-citizens, they collected fre&s;h courage from re&s;entment and de&s;pair, and re&s;olved to undermine a large part of the wall; &s;o that, upon its falling, they might ru&s;h out in a body, and either force their way through the be&s;iegers, or die at once upon the &s;words of the enemy. Henry being informed of their de&s;perate de&s;ign, thought proper to abate of his rigour, and offer terms which, though &s;evere, they accepted. They agreed that the city and ca$$le of Rouen &s;hould be &s;urrendered to the king of England, if not $word$ before the nineteenth day of January: That all the inhabitants &s;hould &s;ubmit to his mercy: That they &s;hould pay three hundred thou&s;and crowns of go$d, by way of ra$$om: And that all the &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on &s;hould &s;wear upon t$e evange$$&s;ts that they would not bear arms again&s;t the king of Eng|land be$$re the f$r$t day of January next en&s;uing.

<P>After the reduction of Rouen, Henry &s;ent part of his army into Picardy, under the command of the duke of Exeter, who &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Dieppe and Montreuil; while he him&s;elf received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all the country as far as Ponthoi&s;e, Beauvais, and Abbeville. Hitherto the duke of Burgundy had he&s;itated between motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t and affection for his country; but now the progre&s;s of Henry determined him in favour o$ his duty. He re&s;olved to reconcile him&s;elf in good earne&s;t with the dauphin, that the force of the kingdom might be united again&s;t the common enemy. But he found this a very diffiult ta&s;k; for &s;uch was the hatred of young Charles towards the duke, that he cho&s;e rather to run the ri&s;que of being deprived of his inheritance, than to &s;acrifice his private animo&s;ity to the advantage of the kingdom. The conferences were renewed at Louvieres, between his amba&s;&s;a|dors and the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners; but the &s;ame difficulties that were &s;tarted at Alen&ccedil;on now rendered the congre&s;s ineffectual; though it was agreed that the king and the dauphin &s;hould confer together per&s;onally. This interview, however, was po&s;tponed from time to time, till at length the dauphin took other mea&s;ures, which prevented it entirely. Mean while Henry indulged him with a truce, from the twelfth day of February till Ea&s;ter, for all the country &s;ituated between the Loire and the Seine, Normandy excepted. The duke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> of Burgundy, according to the laudable &s;cheme he had projected, made a proffer of his friend&s;hip to the dauphin, with prof$&s;&s;ions of the warme&s;t cor|diali$y; and propo&s;ed an interview, that they might confirm their mutual re|conciliation, and concert mea&s;ures for the advantage of the kingdom. His propo&s;al being rejected with di&s;dain, the duke found him&s;elf reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of making peace with England.

<P>All France was ju&s;tly alarmed at this re&s;olution; becau&s;e every per&s;on of intelligence fore&s;aw that no peace could be made at &s;uch a con|juncture, but what mu&s;t have been of infinite prejudice to their country. Several noblemen interpo&s;ed their be&s;t offices in procuring a reconciliation, or at lea&s;t a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of animo&s;ity, between the dauphin and the duke of Bur|gundy; and the fir&s;t would have con&s;ented to a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities for three years; but the duke in&s;i&s;ted upon its being limited to two months, during which he purpo&s;ed to conclude an accommodation with Henry, &s;hould the dauphin continue aver&s;e to a coalition: thus the negotiation mi&s;carried. At length the two kings agreed to meet under a magnificent tent pitched in the neighbourhood of Meulant: but as the di&s;order of Charles prevented him from appearing in per&s;on, it was &s;tipulated that the queen and the duke of Burgundy &s;hould act as his proxies; that the duke of Brittany &s;hould be pre|&s;ent at the conferences; and that commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be appointed on $oth &s;ides, to di&s;cu&s;s the articles by them&s;elves, that no di&s;pute or altercation might ari&s;e between the principals. The dukes of Clarence and Glouce&s;ter were con&s;tituted the plenipotentiaries of Henry, who repaired to Mante, that
<PB N="280" REF="2860">
he might be near the place of conference, while the court of France removed to P$$th$$$e for the &s;ame rea&s;on. From the&s;e two places the French and $ng$$$h courts came every day to the congre&s;s; and at the fir&s;t interview, t$e q$een of France was accompanied by her daughter Catherine, who&s;e b$$$ty made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of the Engli&s;h monarch. Th$ m$ther perceived the conque&s;t which the prince&s;s had made; and, by the ad|vi$$ $f t$e duke of Burgundy, kept her up for the future, in hope of irri|tating the impatience of Henry into &s;ome ha&s;ty conce&s;&s;ion. The king at on$$ divined their intention, at which he took umbrage, and in the fir&s;t tran&s;port o$ his ind gnation told the duke, that he would never lay down his arms, $nt$$ he &s;ho$$d have the king and the prince&s;s in his power; and that he would $rive him o$t of the kingdom, &s;hould he pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e his de&s;ign. This was a mo$t$fying declaration to a prince of the duke's haughty di$po&s;ition, w$o nevert$ele$s bri$$ed his pa&s;&s;ion, and mode&s;tly replied that he hoped means w$$$d be found to make Henry tired of the war.</P>

<P>The conferences turned upon three articles, which the Engli&s;h p$$nipotentiaries propo&s;ed as preliminaries to the peace; namely, That the king $f England &s;hould be p$t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that was ceded to Edward III. by the treaty of Bretigny: That Normandy &s;hould be added to that ce&s;&s;ion: And that he &s;hould po&s;$e&s;s the $ull &s;overeignty of all that might be ceded to him by the treaty, without homage or dependence. The duke of Burgundy perceived, from the ob$tinacy of Henry's temper, that a direct oppo&s;ition to the&s;e articles would at once put an end to the conference, which it was his intere&s;t to continue, as the only means of effecting a reconciliation with the dauphin$ he therefore, without di&s;puting the king's preten&s;ions, delivered to him the counter-demands of France, which we &s;hall mention &s;eparately, together w$th Henry's an&s;wer to each apart. Charles demanded that the king of England &s;hould renounce his preten&s;ions to the crown of France; and Henry agreed to renounce all but that which &s;hould be ceded by the treaty. Charles demanded that he would renounce Touraine, Anjou, Maine, and the &s;overeig$ty of Bretagne: but the king di&s;approved of this article. Charles demanded that the king of England &s;hould &s;wear, in behalf of him&s;elf and his $$cce&s;&s;ors, that he or they &s;hould at no time$ nor upon any cau&s;e what|&s;oever, receive the crown of France as transferred $rom any p$r&s;on, what right &s;oever he or &s;he might pretend to have or convey: The king a&s;&s;ented to this propo&s;a$, on condit$on that his adv$r&s;ary would t$ke an o$th of the &s;ame na|tur$, to$chi$g the crown of England. Charles demanded that the king of England &s;ho$ld cau&s;e his renunciations, promi&s;es and engageme$ts, to be en|ro$$ed, co$firmed, and rat$fied, in the mo&s;t authentic manner the French king and h$s counc$$ cou$d devi&s;e: The king would not a&s;&s;ent to this propo&s;ition. Char$es in&s;i&s;ted upon his being at liberty to give an equivalent for Ponthieu and Montre$$$, in any other part of his kingdom: This article was by no means agreeab$e to Henry. Charles demanded that as there were &s;everal places in Normandy which the king of England had not conquered, and which never|the$e&s;s were to be ceded to him by the treaty, he would, in con&s;ideration of that ce&s;&s;ion, re&s;ign all the conque&s;ts he had made in other places; that each &s;h$$$d be re-e&s;tab$$&s;hed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, where&s;oever it might be &s;$tuated; and that an alliance &s;hould take place between the two crowns:
<PB N="281" REF="2870">
The king approved of this article, on condition that the Scots and rebels &s;hould not be comprehended in the alliance. Charles demanded re&s;titution of the &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns given to king Richard II. as part of the &s;tipulated portion of queen I&s;abel; as al&s;o the payment of four hundred thou|&s;and crowns for the jewels of that prince&s;s, which were detained in England: The king con&s;ented that this &s;um &s;hould be balanced out of the arrears due for the ran&s;om of king John; though he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize that the French king &s;hould demand four hundred thou&s;and crowns for the jewels of queen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>From the nature of the&s;e demands, it plainly appears that the difficulties might have been ea&s;ily &s;urmounted, if both parties had been earne&s;t in their de&s;ire of peace: but at the &s;ame time they were &s;ufficient to keep the treaty in &s;u&s;pence, as long as the duke of Burgundy &s;hould chu&s;e to protract it for the furtherance of his de&s;igns. Henry actually believed that he was on the eve of a pacification, and inve&s;ted the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury with full power to go to Paris, and in his name conclude the treaty with Charles. But his own arts were now retorted upon him&s;elf: he had often carried on nego|tiations to amu&s;e the duke and the dauphin; and now he him&s;elf became a dupe to the &s;ame policy. The duke's chief aim in the congre&s;s at Meulant, was to excite the apprehen&s;ion of the dauphin; and it produced the de&s;ired effect. That young prince, alarmed at the near pro&s;pect of a peace &s;o di&s;ad|vantageous to France, and prejudicial to his own intere&s;t, con&s;ented to a re|conciliation with the duke of Burgundy, as the only expedient that could pre|vent &s;uch calamity; and, after divers private conferences between their con|federates, they at length agreed to a coalition. On the eleventh day of July, they met on the road to Paris, where they embraced each other with &s;eeming affection; and afterwards they &s;igned and ratified a treaty, in which they mu|tually engaged to love each other like brothers, and re&s;i&s;t in common the damnable enterprize of the Engli&s;h, the antient enemies of the kingdom. This accommodation being effected, the duke of Burgundy altered his de|portment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> at the conferences, which were &s;till continued in Meulant. Fearing that Henry's de&s;ire of peace would &s;urmount the difficulties he had already &s;tarted, he added &s;ome new articles, to rai&s;e fre&s;h ob&s;tructions, and expre&s;&s;ed di&s;like to the demands of the king, which he &s;aid were vague, ob&s;cure, equi|vocal, and unrea&s;onable. He in&s;i&s;ted upon Henry's accepting the offers of France, purely and &s;imply, without entering into any &s;ort of explanation; and even refu&s;ed to allow tho&s;e points which were already &s;ettled to be com|mitted to writing. This alteration in his manner of acting, at length opened the eyes of Henry; the conferences were broke off abruptly, and each &s;ide prepared for the recommencement of ho&s;tilities. On the twenty-eighth day of July, the king detached the duke of Clarence and the earl of Huntingdon, with a body of troops to &s;urprize Pontoi&s;e; and this enterprize was atchieved by &s;calade, with all the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. L'I&s;le Adam, who commanded in the place, found him&s;elf &s;o &s;uddenly attacked, that he could hardly e&s;cape with a &s;mall part of the garri&s;on, the re&s;t of which was either taken or cut in pieces. This was a very valuable acqui&s;ition to Henry, as it opened his way to the gates of Paris, from which it was di&s;tant only a few leagues, contained a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Juv$nal de$ Ur&s;in. Hi&s;t. de C$ar. $I.</NOTE> va&s;t quantity of warlike &s;tores, and enriched his army with plunder, exclu&s;ive of a large &s;um of money, which was a very &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this advantage, which filled Paris with $word$ Henry's affairs began to a&s;&s;ume a very unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect. Since his $word$ $word$ upon France he had met with no oppo&s;ition in the field, becau&s;e $word$ $word$ $word$ power$$l factions in the kingdom favoured his progre&s;s; but $word$ the whole $trength of the nation was on the point of being united again&s;t his inter$$t. The people of England were by this time tired of the war, which had already drained them of men and money; for the king had received divers large rein$orcements from his own dominions &s;ince he landed in Normandy; and the parliament had granted aid upon aid, and &s;ub&s;idy after &s;ub&s;idy, until the $word$ exclaimed that the conque&s;t of France would ruin England. The $$$phin had engaged the kings of Ca&s;tile and Arragon in his intere&s;t. Their united forces had already entered Bearn, and ravaged the country to the gates of Bayonne, which they threatened to be&s;iege; and a large ca&s;tilian fleet had re|ceived orders to &s;ail to Scotland, and tran&s;port from thence a body of troops a$$$$b$ed for the &s;ervice of the dauphin. Henry had likewi&s;e great rea&s;on to believe that the Flemings, who had refu&s;ed to &s;erve under the duke of Bur|gundy as an enemy to France, would chearfully join him in defence of that kingdom.</P>

<P>Embarra&s;&s;ed as he mu&s;t have been by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he maintained his preten&s;ions, without any &s;igns of doubt or de&s;pondence; and even affected to declare that he would not be contented with the conce&s;&s;ions of Charles to what he demanded at Meulant, without the addition of Pontoi&s;e, which he had conquered &s;ince that congre&s;s. In all probability he would have found it convenient to change his &s;train, had not the rancour and perfidy of the dauphin co-operated with his endeavours. Mean while he undertook the &s;iege of Gi&s;ors, which he carried on with &s;uch vigour, that, notwith&s;tanding the ad|vantage of its &s;ituation in the mid&s;t of fens and mar&s;hes that rendered it very difficult of acce&s;s, and a numerous garri&s;on command by experienced officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> it was obliged to &s;urrender upon capitulation. Chateau Galliard was reduced by the duke of Glouce&s;ter, after having made an ob&s;tinate defence for &s;ix months; and Roche-guyon, with the ca&s;tle of Aumaule, was taken by a detach|ment under the command of the earl of Warwick. Then Ivry fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, together with the ca&s;tles of Montjoye and St. Germaine|en-laye; and la&s;tly, he be&s;ieged and took Meulant, from whence he detached the duke of Clarence with a body of forces to the neighbourhood of Paris.</P>

<P>The dauphin, though &s;eemingly reconciled to the duke of Bur|gundy, &s;till harboured in his heart that animo&s;ity which he had imbibed from his intancy; and which now, like a fire half &s;mothered, glowed more inten&s;ely than before. He refu&s;ed to appear at court while the duke maintained any in|fluence in the council; and as he wanted to engro&s;s the admini&s;tration into his own hands, he $crupled at no means, how treacherous &s;oever, for the accom|pli&s;hment of that aim. He re&s;olved to proceed by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and to execute his purpo&s;e at Pouilly; but thought proper to po&s;tpone his de&s;ign, becau&s;e the duke was &s;urrounded by a &s;trong body of forces. The dauphin afterwards advancing at the head of twenty thou&s;and men towards Montereau-&s;ur-yonne, invited the duke to a conference on a bridge between the town and ca&s;tle, where they might concert mea&s;ures for the campaign again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and &s;ettle &s;ome other affairs of importance. The duke readily complied with his propo|&s;al;
<PB N="283" REF="2890">
and though appri&s;ed on the road of the dauphin's de&s;ign, rather than give a handle for a rupture, by exhibiting any marks of &s;u&s;picion, he proceeded to the appointed place, where he was murdered by Tanneguy de Ch&acirc;tel and his accomplices. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;tr$$$$.</NOTE></P>

<P>The po&s;ture of affairs was totally changed by this event. The Pari|&s;ians were exa&s;perated at the murder of their favourite; and his &s;on Philip $as tran&s;ported with the de&s;ire of revenge to &s;uch a degree, that he re&s;olved to &s;a|crifice the welfare of his country to that pa&s;&s;ion. He fir&s;t of all renewed his father's connexion with queen I&s;abel, who had always acted as the inveterate enemy of her &s;on; and thus becoming ma&s;ter of the king's per&s;on, was con|&s;idered as regent by tho&s;e who did not obey the dauphin. Then he b$gan a negotiation with the king of England, which was in effect a con&s;piracy again&s;t his country. Since the reduction of Pontoi&s;e the court had removed to $roye, on account of the enemy's incur&s;ions to the very gates of Paris, the inhabitants of which finding them&s;elves hampered and harra&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h, &s;ollicited and obtained of Henry a particular truce for five days, during which the treaty was concluded between him and Charles, by the interpo&s;ition of the queen and the duke of Burgundy$ Since the death of the la&s;t duke, Henry had ri&s;en in his demands. Renouncing the propo&s;als he had made at Meulant, he now re&s;umed his preten&s;ions to the crown of France, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the following articles: He offered to marry the prince&s;s Catherine without a dower: He pro|mi&s;ed that he would not interrupt king Charles in the enjoyment of his crown, or intermeddle with his revenues during the natural life of that monarch: And that the queen &s;hould maintain her dignity in the &s;ame manner: But he de|manded that after the death of Charles, the crown of France &s;hould devolve upon the king of England and his heirs for ever: That, on account of the di&s;|order of king Charles, which hindered him from managing the reins of govern|ment, the king of England &s;hould undertake the admini&s;tration, in quality of regent, even during the life of his father-in-law: That the princes, noblemen, communities, and burghers of the kingdom, &s;hould take the oath to the king of England, as regent, promi&s;ing to acknowledge him for their &s;overeign after the death of Charles: That the king of France &s;hould deliver to the king of England letters patent under his great &s;eal, as a confirmation and &s;ecurity for the punc|tual ob&s;ervance of the&s;e articles: That letters of the &s;ame nature &s;hould be &s;igned by the queen, the duke of Burgundy, and the peers of the realm, in explicit terms, free from all equivocation: And the king of England promi&s;ed on his part to grant letters patent of the &s;ame import.</P>

<P>The&s;e fundamental points being &s;ettled, the duke of Burgundy ratified them as whole&s;ome, u&s;eful, rea&s;onable, and tending to the advantage of France and of all Chri&s;tendom.

About the middle of July the confederate army undertook the &s;iege of Melun, a place of great importance, &s;trongly for|tified, and &s;ecured by a numerous garri&s;on commanded by Barbazan, an officer of great courage and experience, who was &s;u&s;pected of having been concerned in the murder of the duke of Burgundy. The king had ju&s;t received a rein|forcement of two thou&s;and archers and eight hundred men at arms from Eng|land, under the command of the duke of Bedford, who had left his brother Glouce&s;ter regent in his ab&s;ence. All the troops that both chiefs could a&s;&s;em|ble, were &s;carce &s;ufficient to atchieve the enterprize they had undertaken. The be&s;ieged attacked them and de&s;troyed their works in repeated &s;allies: the be|&s;iegers were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s in &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;&s;aults; and when they proceeded by the method of &s;apping, they found them&s;elves countermined by the indefatigable Barbazan, who encountered Henry in a mine, and fought with him hand to hand, until the king admiring his valour, a&s;ked his name, when he an&s;wered Barbazan, "Well," &s;aid Henry, <Q>&startq;you have fought with the king of England.&endq;</Q> Even after con&s;iderable breaches were made in the walls, Henry would not venture to give the a&s;&s;ault again&s;t &s;uch de&s;perate defendants, and converted the &s;iege into a blockade. The dauphin marched to the relief of the place at the head of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, but found all the avenues guarded in &s;uch a manner, as prevented him from throwing in &s;upplies; and he retreated without having made any attempt upon the quarters of the be&s;iegers. At length the garri&s;on having con&s;umed all their provi&s;ions, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time on the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, dogs, and other dome&s;tic ani|mals, and &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of relief, Barbazan was obliged to &s;urrender on capitulation; by which all the French troops in garri&s;on were en&s;ured in their lives, except &s;uch as &s;hould be found to have been concerned in the death of the duke of Burgundy. Barbazan him&s;elf lay under this imputation, and would certainly have lo&s;t his life, had not he pleaded that he was Henry's brother at arms, as having fought him in &s;ingle combat. This plea exempted him from an ignominious death; though he was detained pri&s;oner above twenty years in the Chateau Galliard. Henry ordered twenty Scots who were found in the place to be hanged up as rebels, on pretence that they had carried arms again&s;t their own king, who being Henry's pri&s;oner, &s;erved as a volun|teer on this occa&s;ion.

This prince as well as the French p$ers and officers in gene|ral, was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted with the manners of Henry, who, being naturally proud and imperious, treated them with marks of indifference and contempt. The prince of Orange had retired with his forces from the &s;iege of Melun, and even refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe to the treaty of Troye, again&s;t which he loudly ex|claimed, merely becau&s;e he had received &s;ome per&s;onal affront from the king of

As it was found nece&s;&s;ary to alter the form of the articles of the general peace between France and England, in order to avoid all doubts and ob&s;curi$ies, the truce was prolonged, that Henry's am|b$&s;&s;$dors might have time $o concert the form of the treaty with the duke of Burgundy at Troye, where the peace was confirmed on the twenty-fir&s;t day of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 14$$.</NOTE> May by the oaths of the contracting parties, the queen and the duke of Bur|gundy &s;wearing as proxies for Charles.

The king had ju&s;t received a rein|forcement of two thou&s;and archers and eight hundred men at arms from Eng|land, under the command of the duke of Bedford, who had left his brother Glouce&s;ter regent in his ab&s;ence. All the troops that both chiefs could a&s;&s;em|ble, were &s;carce &s;ufficient to atchieve the enterprize they had undertaken. The be&s;ieged attacked them and de&s;troyed their works in repeated &s;allies: the be|&s;iegers were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s in &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;&s;aults; and when they proceeded by the method of &s;apping, they found them&s;elves countermined by the indefatigable Barbazan, who encountered Henry in a mine, and fought with him hand to hand, until the king admiring his valour, a&s;ked his name, when he an&s;wered Barbazan, "Well," &s;aid H$nry, <Q>&startq;you have fought with the king of England.&endq;</Q> Even after con&s;iderable breaches were made in the walls, Henry would not venture to give the a&s;&s;ault again&s;t &s;uch de&s;perate defendants, and converted the &s;iege into a blockade. The dauphin marched to the relief of the place at the head of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, but found all the avenues guarded in &s;uch a manner, as prevented him from throwing in &s;upplies; and he retreated without having made any attempt upon the quarters of the be&s;iegers. At length the garri&s;on having con&s;umed all their provi&s;ions, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time on the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, dogs, and other dome&s;tic ani|mals, and &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of relief, Barbazan was obliged to &s;urrender on capitulation; by which all the French troops in garri&s;on were en&s;ured in their lives, except &s;uch as &s;hould be found to have been concerned in the death of the duke of Burgundy. Barbazan him&s;elf lay under this imputation, and would certainly have lo&s;t his life, had not he pleaded that he was Henry's brother at arms, as having fought him in &s;ingle combat. This plea exempted him from an ignominious death; though he was detained pri&s;oner above twenty years in the Chateau Galliard. Henry ordered twenty Scots who were found in the place to be hanged up as rebels, on pretence that they had carried arms again&s;t their own king, who being Henry's pri&s;oner, &s;erved as a volun|teer on this occa&s;ion.

<P>Melun being reduced, and the earl of Huntingdon appointed gover|nor of the place, the two courts repaired to the capital; and Henry, with his father-in-law, made his public entry with great magni$icence. By this time, however, the &s;eeds of contention were &s;own between the king of England and the duke of Burgundy. This prince as well as the French peers and officers in gene|ral, was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted with the manners of Henry, who, being naturally proud and imperious, treated them with marks of indifference and contempt. The prince of Orange had retired with his forces from the &s;iege of Melun, and even refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe to the treaty of Troye, again&s;t which he loudly ex|claimed, merely becau&s;e he had received &s;ome per&s;onal affront from the king of

England: but nothing gave &s;uch umbrage to the duke, as Henry's engro&s;&s;ing the whole direction o$ affairs, and leaving him a mere cypher in the admini&s;|tration. The king had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ba&s;tile, after having expelled the duke's garri&s;on: he &s;urprized and &s;ecured the ca&s;tle of Vincennes, and &s;e|veral other $ortre&s;&s;es in the &s;ame manner; and &s;uper&s;eded the count of St. Pol governor of Paris, in favour of his brother the duke of Clarence: he took up his re&s;idence in the Louvre, where his court was numerous and magnificent, w$ile that of Charles was mean and &s;ol$tary: the Engli&s;h troops were cantoned in the avenues of Paris, and part of them quartered in the heart of the city, where, in &s;pite of all the king's di&s;cipline, they committed numberle&s;s out|rages, and rendered them&s;elves extremely odious to the inhabitants. In the beginning of December the e&s;tates of the kingdom a&s;&s;embled at Paris: Charles being then in one of his lucid intervals, pre&s;ided in per&s;on, and declared that he had, of his own free will and motion, concluded a peace with the king of England, which he was per&s;uaded would be for the advantage of the kingdom; he therefore de&s;ired they would confirm it by their &s;anction and authority. Though they had very little rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with this pacification, they would not be &s;o ra&s;h as to &s;peak their real &s;entiments at &s;uch a conjuncture; but, on the contrary, unanimou&s;ly decreed that the peace of Troye &s;hould be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

The dauphin, with his accomplices, being &s;ummoned to appear at the marble table, and paying no regard to the citation, were convicted, attainted, and condemned to perpetual exile; and he, on the other hand, appealed to God and his own &s;word from this &s;entence, as well as from all proceedings that might be carried on to his prejudice in the name of his father. He &s;till pre&s;erved the title of regent, in which quality he transferred the parliament and univer&s;ity of Paris to Poitiers, where &s;ome members of tho&s;e two bodies actually a&s;&s;embled; &s;o that France at this period exhibited two kings, two queens, two regents, all the officers of the crown doubled, &s;even or eight marechals of France on each &s;ide, with two parliaments and two univer&s;ities of Paris.

Having therefore appointed Engli&s;h commanders in the &s;trong places he had taken, and con&s;tituted the duke of Exeter governor of Paris, he took the road to Rouen in Normandy, where he convoked an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates of that province, and received a con&s;iderable &s;upply from the laity and clery. Leaving the duke of Clarence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE> to command the army, he embarked, at the latter end of January, for Eng|land, with his young queen, who was crowned on the third Sunday of Lent, at We&s;tmin&s;ter, with great magnificence. Immediately after his arrival in his Briti&s;h dominions, he &s;ummoned a parliament to meet on the &s;econd day of May, at Leice&s;ter; and, in the mean time, made a progre&s;s through great part of England, on pretence of gratifying the queen with a &s;ight of the country: tho' his real de&s;ign was, to influence the elections, that the en|&s;uing parliament might be favourable to his views.

<P>The duke of Clarence had marched with ten thou&s;and men into Anjou, with a view to reduce that province, which adhered to the dauphin; being informed that &s;even thou&s;and Scots, commanded by the earl of Bu|chan, were encamped at Baug&eacute;, in &s;uch a &s;traggling manner, that the van might be ea&s;ily cut off before the rear could come to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he re&s;olved to at|tack them immediately; and, putting him&s;elf at the head of his hor&s;e, began his march, after having ordered the earl of Sali&s;bury to follow with the re&s;t of the forces. When the duke reached Baug&eacute;, he found &s;ome Scotti&s;h troops in|trenched in a church-yard, and &s;pent &s;o much time in attempting to di&s;lodge them, that the earl of Buchan being alarmed, a&s;&s;embled his forces, and marched up to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Clarence, in&s;tead of waiting for the earl of Sali&s;bury, attacked the new-comers with great impetuo&s;ity, and performed many exploits of per&s;onal valour, until he was wounded in the face with a &s;pear by a Scotti&s;h knight called Swinton, and afterwards killed with a truncheon by the earl of Buchan. His cavalry were totally routed, fifteen hundred left dead on the &s;pot, among which number were the lord Roos, Sir John Grey, and Sir Gil|bert Umfreville; and the earls of Huntingdon, Somer&s;et, and Mortagne, the lord Fitzwalter, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, were taken pri&s;oners. The earl of Sali&s;bury did not come up 'till after the battle; but he favoured the retreat of the fugitives, and recovered the body of the duke of Clarence, who&s;e death was ju&s;tly regretted by all his countrymen. The dauphin was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this victory, that he created the earl of Buchan con&s;table of France; and that nobleman, in order to maintain the reputation he had ac|quired, undertook the &s;iege of Alen&ccedil;on, which the earl of Sali&s;bury attempted to rai&s;e; but he was repul&s;ed with &s;ome lo&s;s by the be&s;iegers, though Buchan was afterwards obliged to abandon the enterprize for want of artillery. Ne|verthele&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;trelet.</NOTE> the dauphin's party began to recover their &s;pirits, and gained &s;eve|ral advantages over the Burgundians. Lahire, one of the dauphin's parti&s;ans, defeated a body of troops under the count de Vaudemon$, who was taken pri|&s;oner; and the war was carried on with great vivacity in Ponthieu, where the Burgundians were wor&s;ted in &s;everal encounters.</P>

<P>The&s;e tran&s;actions induced Henry to ha&s;ten his return to France: but, in the mean time, his attention was employed on the affairs of parlia|ment, which, meeting at the appointed time, chearfully confirmed the treaty of Troye, a peace &s;o glorious for England, and granted a &s;ub&s;idy for the continuation of the war again&s;t the dauphin; but, at the &s;ame time, they pre|&s;ented an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, in which they ob&s;erved, that the conque&s;t of France would be the ruin of England. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, &s;eve|ral whole&s;ome laws were enacted; and, among the re&s;t, it was decreed, that no eccle&s;ia&s;tic, appointed by the pope, &s;hould be admitted to a benefice with|out the con&s;ent of the patron. This &s;tatute was a mortal blow to the clau&s;e Non Ob&s;tante, which had been &s;o often u&s;ed by the popes in the exerci&s;e of their u&s;urped authority, with re&s;pect to the collation of benefices. Before the parliament broke up, a treaty was concluded and ratified between England and Genoa, which was very advantageous to Henry, as it deprived the French of a u&s;eful ally. His next care was, to per&s;uade his pri&s;oner, James king of Scotland, to recall the troops which had been &s;ent over to France, under the command of the earl of Buchan; and that prince, in con&s;equence of &s;ome pri|vate &s;tipulation with the king of England, laid his commands upon his &s;ub|jects, to quit the &s;ervice of the dauphin; but the earl replied, that they did not think them&s;elves bound, by any ties, to obey the orders of their king, while he remained in the hands of his adver&s;ary, and mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to act from compul&s;ion. This order of James, however, furni&s;hed Henry with a pretence for treating, as rebels, all the Scots that were taken in the &s;ervice of the dauphin. By this time, the duke of Albany was dead, and &s;ucceeded in the regency of Scotland by his &s;on Murdoc earl of Fife, who had been lately relea&s;ed from his captivity in England. It was &s;ince his a$ce&s;&s;ion to the mini|&s;try, that the auxiliaries had been &s;ent to France; and, therefore, he became di&s;agreeable to the king of England, who, in order to encourage a party that &s;hould counterballance his intere&s;t in Scotland, permitted James to revi&s;it his own country, on his giving &s;ecurity for his return, and a&s;&s;uring Henry he would do his endeavour to di&s;&s;olve the alliance between Scotland and the dauphin.</P>

<P>Henry having thus fini&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s that called him into England, appointed the duke of Bedford regent of the kingdom; and, leaving the queen pretty far advanced in her pregnancy, &s;et &s;ail for Calais, on the tenth day of June, with a new-rai&s;ed army, amounting to thirty thou&s;and men, the greater part of whom were archers. On his arrival at Calais, he detatched twelve hundred cho&s;en hor&s;e, under the command of the earl of Dort&s;et and lord Clifford, to the relief of the duke of Exeter, who was be&s;ieged in Paris by the dauphin: but when this reinforcement entered the city, he withdrew his forces, and, in a little time, undertook the &s;iege of Chartres. The king hav|ing &s;ent off divers detatchments to reduce &s;ome ca&s;tles in Picardy, which &s;till held for the dauphin, marched in per&s;on with the re&s;t of his army to Bois le Vincennes, and from thence went to Paris on a vi&s;it to his father-in-law. Un|der&s;tanding that the dauphin had inve&s;ted Chartres, he directed his route to that place, in hope of deciding the di&s;pute by a battle; but, as he ap|proached, the other retired, and Henry pur&s;ued him for a con&s;iderable way, until perceiving that he could not undertake or draw him to an engagement,

he turned off to Dreux, which made no re&s;i&s;tance, but &s;urrendered at the fir&s;t &s;ummons. After the reduction of this place, his army was &s;o terribly afflicted with the dy&s;entery, that he ordered them into quarters of refre&s;hment, while he him&s;elf retured to Paris, where he formed the de&s;ign of be&s;ieging Meaux, one of the mo&s;t important places that owned the dauphin's authority; &s;trongly fortified by art and nature, and provided with a numerous garri&s;on, commanded by the ba&s;tard of Vaurus, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his activity and rancour again&s;t the Burgundians.</P>

<P>This place was inve&s;ted by Henry on the &s;ixth day of October, and the $iege la&s;ted all the winter; during which, he lo&s;t a great number of men by the inclemency of the weather and fatigue, as well as by the valour of the be&s;ieged, who made incredible efforts in their own defence. The town was di|vided into two parts, called the City and the March&eacute;; the fir&s;t of which was taken by &s;torm in the winter; but the other was defended with infinite ob&s;ti|nacy. The lord Cornwal's &s;on, a youth of great expectation, and the earl of Dor&s;et, lo&s;t their lives at this memorable &s;iege, be&s;ides a great number of other gallant officers, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;&s;aults, that mi&s;carried in &s;pite of all Henry's conduct and intrepidity. At length, the garri&s;on, being reduced to the utmo&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

They were obliged to &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms as he was plea&s;ed to impo&s;e. After he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, he commanded three officers to be in&s;tantly beheaded, and the ba$tard of Vaurus to be hanged upon a tree, which was di&s;tingui&s;hed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elmham$ Monftre$$$ Rymer.</NOTE> by his name, becau&s;e he had u&s;ed it as a gibbet for the execution of all the Burgundians that fell into his hands.</P>

<P>While Henry was employed in the fiege of Meaux, he received the agreeable news of his queen's being &s;afely delivered of a &s;on at Wind&s;or, who was baptized by the name of Henry, and lived to be one of the mo&s;t unfortu|nate monarchs that ever &s;at upon the throne of England. About the time that Meaux capitulated, the queen was in a condition to travel, and arrived in France, accompanied by the duke of Bedford, who left his brother Glouce&s;ter regent in his ab&s;ence. The two courts joining at Bois de Vincennes, went to|gether to Paris, to pa&s;s the Whit&s;untide holidays. On the day of Penteco&s;t, the two kings and queens dined together in public, with their crowns upon their heads; and the French, who wi&s;hed well to their country, could not, without deep-felt &s;orrow, behold the king o$ England governing France with ab&s;olute authority. Their di&s;gu&s;t was augmented by an arbitrary tax he im|po&s;ed in relation to a new coinage, at which the Pari&s;ians murmured in vain. Their &s;ituation was no longer what it &s;eemed to be a few years before, when they held the ballance between the two factions, and had it in their power to make either &s;cale preponderate. While Henry enjoyed this rece&s;s from the fatigues of war, the dauphin made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of la Charit&eacute;, opened the pa&s;&s;age of the Loire, and afterwards inve&s;ted Co&s;ne on the &s;ame river, which agree$ to &s;urrender, if not relieved by the duke of Burgundy, by the eighteenth day of Augu&s;t.</P>

<P>The duke's honour being thus engaged for the relief of the place, he &s;ent to the king for a reinforcement of troops; and Henry gave him to under|$tand he would be there in per&s;on. He accordingly began his march for this purpo&s;e; but was attacked by a dy&s;entery, which obliged him to halt at Senlis, $rom whence he was carried to Bois de Vincennes, a$ter having be&s;towed the command of the troops upon the duke of Bedford, and ordered him to join the duke of Burgundy with all expedition. The dauphin being informed of their junction, and finding him&s;el$ too weak to cope with them in the field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E$m$a$.</NOTE> retired behind the Loire, and the two dukes marched to Troye in Champagne. Mean while Henry's malady encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that the phy&s;icians de&s;paired of his recovery, and he began to prepare for death, with that courage and intrepidity by which he had never been for&s;aken. Feeling his la&s;t hour approaching, he &s;ent for the dukes of Bedford and Exeter, the earl of War|wick, and all the Engli&s;h no$lemen who happened to be in that neighbour|hood, that they might hear his la&s;t in&s;tructions. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to them, $ith an audible voice and chearful countenance, he ob&s;erved that his reign, though &s;hort, had been glorious; that though his wars had occa&s;ioned a great deal of blood&s;hed, it could not be ju&s;tly imputed to him; but to the French, who would not li&s;ten to equitable terms of accommodation: that with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, he could meet death without the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion; but he could not help lamenting the fate of the prince his &s;on, who, being an infant, could not fini&s;h the work he had &s;o happily begun. He, therefore, conjured them, in the name of God, to unite their intere&s;ts and zeal in behalf of that young prince who was born to be their &s;overeign; to watch over his education, and as much as lay in their power, con&s;ole the queen in her affliction: he exhorted t$em to cultivate the friend&s;hip of the duke of Burgundy; to de$ain the pri|&s;oners who had been taken at Agincourt, until his &s;on &s;hould be of age to a&s;|&s;ume the reins of government; and whatever peace they might find it con|venient to make with France, to pre&s;erve the &s;overeignty of Normandy to England. Finally, he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that the duke of Bedford might be charged with the admini&s;tration of France; and that the duke of Glouce&s;ter might govern England during the prince's minority.</P>

<P>Having &s;poke to this effect, he enquired of his phy&s;icians how long they thought he &s;hould live; when one of them kneeling by the bed-&s;ide, while the tears trickled down his cheeks, declared, that without a miracle, two hours would put an end to his life. He heard this dreadful &s;entence without the lea&s;t emotion, and having made confe&s;&s;ion of his &s;ins, ordered his chaplains to recite the &s;even penitential p&s;alms. When they pronoun$$d the&s;e words, "Rebuild the walls of $$ru&s;alem," he interrupted them, and declared, on the word of a dying prince, that his intention was to turn his arms again&s;t the in$idels in the Holy Land, as &s;oon as he &s;hould have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;olid peace with France. This exerci&s;e of devotion being ended, Henry expired on the thirty-fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, and in the thirty-fourth year of his age, after a glorious reign of nine years, four months, and eleven days. His body was conveyed to England, and interred at We&s;tmin&s;ter, among his ance&s;tors, with &s;uch pomp and magnificence as befitted the &s;plendor of his reign; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry$$$$ $word$.</NOTE> the queen, in memory of &s;uch an illu&s;trious con&s;ort, placed upon his monu|ment his $ta$ue of &s;ilver as big as the life, which it perfectly re&s;embled.

Henry was tall and &s;lender, with a long neck, engaging a&s;pect, and limbs of the mo&s;t elegant turn. He excelled all the youth of that age in agility, and the exerci&s;e of arms; was hardy, patient, and laborious, and more capable of enduring cold, hunger, and fatigue, than any individual of his army. His valour was &s;uch as no danger could &s;tartle and no difficulty oppo&s;e: nor was his policy inferior to his courage. He managed the di&s;&s;en&s;ions among his enemies with &s;uch addre&s;s as &s;poke him con&s;ummate in the arts of the cabinet. He fomented their jealou&s;ies, and converted their mutual re&s;entment to his own advantage. Henry po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;elf-taught genius, that blazed out at once without the aid of in&s;truction or experience; and a fund of natural &s;agacity that made ample amends for the&s;e defects. He was cha&s;te, temperate, mo|de&s;t, and devout, &s;crupulou&s;ly ju&s;t in his admini&s;tration, and &s;everely exact in the di&s;cipline of his army, upon which he knew his glory and &s;ucce&s;s in a great mea&s;ure depended. In a word, it mu&s;t be owned he was without an equal in the arts of war, policy, and government. But we cannot be &s;o far dazzled with his great qualities, as to overlook the defects in his character. His pride and imperious temper lo&s;t him the hearts of the French nobility, and frequently broke out in outrage and abu&s;e; as at the &s;iege of Melun, where he treated the marechal l'I&s;le d'Adam with the utmo&s;t indignity, although that nobleman had given him no other offence than that of coming into his pre&s;ence in plain, though decent apparel. That his di&s;po&s;ition was cruel, ap|pears too plainly from the ma&s;&s;acre of the pri&s;oners at Agincourt; from his behaviour to the garri&s;ons of Rouen, Melun, and other places, which he found difficulty in reducing; as well as from the per&s;ecution of the Lollards, which could not have been countenanced by a prince of humanity. Tho&s;e un|happy wretches &s;eem to have been &s;acrificed to his intere&s;t, as well as to his religious bigotry; for they were &s;o many victims, by which he rendered the clergy propitious to his aims. All his renown was founded upon the mo&s;t pernicious ambition, which &s;eemed to &s;wallow up every principle of ju&s;tice, and every con&s;ideration of humanity. He could not but know the weakne&s;s of that title in &s;upport of which he &s;hed the blood of two hundred thou&s;and men, ruined a &s;till greater number of families, laid wa&s;te the faire&s;t provinces of Europe, and encouraged, nay bribed with offers of friend&s;hip and alliance the fir&s;t noblemen in France, to renounce their allegiance and betray their country. It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that the&s;e were the vices of the times rather than of Henry. Europe was not yet humanized from the &s;avage man|ners of the northern barbarians, by which it had been over-run; and it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that from the conque&s;t of England by William of Normandy to the period of which we now treat, the throne had not been filled with one prince who&s;e reign was not marked with &s;uch acts of cruelty or perfidy as would fix an indelible &s;tain of infamy on any modern character. This was likewi&s;e the ca&s;e of all the neighbouring nations, which &s;eem to have been ruled by princes of the &s;ame family and complexion. Without im|bibing any tincture of the liberal arts, which enlarge the faculties of the &s;oul, and determine it to pur&s;uits more worthy of humanity; without being taught the le&s;&s;ons of univer&s;al benevolence and true morality, the &s;ole objects of their education were war and &s;uper&s;tition. They were trained up in maxims of ar|bitrary power, that con&s;idered the bulk of mankind as &s;laves &s;ub&s;ervient to
<PB N="292" REF="3020">
their intere&s;t and ambition: They were taught from their infancy to be|lieve that the mo&s;t flagrant crimes might be expiated by benefactions to the church; and that common inju&s;tice and u&s;urpation were &s;ufficiently atoned by a regular performance of religious exerci&s;e. Henry had been encouraged and exhorted by his prelates to undertake the war with France. In his la&s;t moments he appealed to heaven for the ju&s;tification of his conduct. He had attacked the kingdom of France without the lea&s;t provocation: he had filled it with widows and orphans, lamentation, mi&s;ery, and every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s; and yet he died in full conviction of having acted according to the dictates of equity. There is no room to &s;u&s;pect him of di&s;&s;imulation at &s;uch a juncture; and tho&s;e who are acquainted with the human mind, will conceive how ea&s;ily con&s;cience is brought over to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of any ruling pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; I.</HEAD>
<P>THE death of Henry V. was no &s;ooner known than the duke of Glou|ce&s;ter, who exerci&s;ed the office of guardian, i&s;&s;ued writs in the name of young Henry, for a parliament to meet on the ninth day of November at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and in the mean time the young king, being about nine months old, was proclaimed at London. The parliament meeting at the appointed time, payed no regard to the verbal declaration of the late king, appointing Glouce&s;ter regent of England. They ve&s;ted this high tru&s;t in his elder brother John duke of Bedford; though Humphrey was allowed to act in his ab&s;ence. The duke of Bedford was therefore cho&s;en protector, defender of the realm and the church of England, and the king's principal coun&s;ellor, with a &s;alary of eight thou&s;and marks to &s;upport the dignity of that office. At the &s;ame time they appointed a council, by who&s;e advice all the affairs of the kingdom were to be admini&s;tred; the protector, in their deliberations, having no other prerogative than that of a deciding voice, in ca&s;e of an equal divi&s;ion. This important point being e&s;tabli&s;hed, they made &s;ome other regulations touching &s;heriffs, bailiffs, and ju&s;tice of the peace; and having continued the tonnage and poundage, with the &s;ub&s;idy on wool, for two years longer, were di&s;&s;olved. Before they broke up, however, they appointed governors to take charge of the king's per&s;on and education. The&s;e were Thomas Beaufort duke of Exeter, and his brother Henry bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the king's great uncles. This la&s;t was a prelate of great wealth, arrogance, and ambition; and by this office he acquired great influence in the councils of England; and even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the duke of Glouce&s;ter in credit. There &s;eemed to be a conte&s;t between them in point of authority, which turned out very prejudicial to the intere&s;t of their &s;overeign. The duke of Glouce&s;ter had &s;carce taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new dignity, when he married Jaquelina daughter of William V. duke of Bavaria, and heire&s;s of Hainault, Holland, Zealand, and Frie&s;land. She had been married to John dauphin of France, and after his death compelled by her mother to wed the duke of Brabant, who&s;e per&s;on &s;he dete&s;ted. Indeed they &s;eemed to hate one another; and after they had lived together &s;ome time in continual di&s;&s;en|tion, &s;he made an elopement to England, where &s;he was ho&s;pitably received by the late king, and applied to the pope for a divorce; but as this could not be obtained, &s;he gave her hand to the duke of Glouce&s;ter, by virtue of a licence from the antipope Benedict; and this prepo&s;terous marriage was pro|ductive of a great mi&s;chief to England.</P>

<P>Charles VI. of France &s;urvived his &s;on-in-law but fifty days$ and his death produced a total revolution in the affairs of that kingdom. Many French noblemen, who thought it their duty to obey the king, without examining nar|rowly

whether or not his conduct was for the advantage of their country, now believed them&s;elves under the &s;ame obligation to the dauphin, notwith&s;tanding the treaty of Troye, which was the effect of violence and compul&s;ion. The duke of Bedford was not ignorant of their &s;entiments; and therefore the eyes of Charles were no &s;ooner clo&s;ed, than he proclaimed Henry, king of France, and a&s;&s;umed the title of regent, according to the appointment of his late brother Henry king of England. He then a&s;&s;embled all the French noblemen who ad|hered to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, and they took the oath of allegiance to young Henry; which was likewi&s;e exacted of all the towns that were under the domi|nion of the Engli&s;h. After this ceremony the council of France and the city of Paris &s;ent deputi$s to London, to congratulate the young king upon his ac|ce&s;&s;ion to both crowns; and they had in&s;tructions to pa&s;s through t$$ Low Countries, and exhort the duke of Burgundy to continue firm to the articles of his alliance.</P>

<P>While the duke of Bedford took the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary precautions in behalf of his nephew, the dauphin, who was at E&s;paly, an hou&s;e belonging to the bi|&s;hop of Puy, cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be immediately proclaimed king of France, and repaired to Poitiers, where he was con&s;$crated in the beginning of Novem|ber. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all Languedoc, Dauphin&eacute;, Berry, Auvergne, Toutaine, part of Saintonge, the town of Rochelle, and Poitou; and be&s;ides the&s;e pro|vinces he looked upon Provence, Maine, and Anjou, as countries on who&s;e attachment he might depend. On the other hand, Henry's intere&s;t prev&aacute;iled in Normandy and Guienne, Picardy, Champagne, Brie, the I&s;le of France, and the city of Paris, be&s;ides the two Burgundies, Flanders, and Artois,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai$ Monf$relet.</NOTE> which belonged to the duke of Burgundy, who was his va&s;&s;al and ally. Such being the &s;ituation of affairs, the war might have been carried on in all the pro|vinces of France, except Bretagne, which ob&s;erved an exact neutrality; though the &s;cene of action was chiefly confined to Picardy, Champagne, La Brie, and the I&s;le of France; becau&s;e the Engli&s;h were de&s;irous of expelling the dauphin's garri&s;ons from the&s;e provinces, before they would carry the war to the other &s;ide of the Loire; and it was the intere&s;t of Charles to make his chief efforts i$ tho&s;e countries, that his enemies might be prevented from penetrating into the more &s;outhern provinces. John V. duke of Bretagne &s;till adhered to his neu|trality, as well as his brother Arthur count de Richemont; though both leaned towards the Engli&s;h intere&s;t. The duke of Burgundy re&s;olved to ob&s;erve punc|tually the articles of his alliance, on account of his per&s;onal hatred to Charles, who had murdered his father. Lewis III. duke of Anjou and king of Sicily$ e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Charles, who had married his &s;i&s;ter. The count de Foix and his brothers declared for the Engli&s;h; though they afterwards changed their party. The hou&s;es of Armagnac and Albert had made their peace with Henry V. but now they engaged in the intere&s;t of Charles. The duke of Or|leans and his brother the count de Angouleme, were both pri&s;oners in Eng|land; but Charles was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their friends, adherents, and influence. The &s;ame party was embraced by John duke of Alen$on, and his b$other Peter the Ba&s;tard, who was counted one of the be&s;t warriors in the kingdom. John duke of Bourbon being pri&s;oner in England, could have no per&s;onal &s;hare in the&s;e conte&s;ts; but his elde&s;t &s;on, the count of Clermont, was &s;trongly attached to Charles, for who&s;e &s;ervice he maintained all the places belonging to the duke

<P>Among the parti&s;ans and officers of Henry, he that filled the fir&s;t place, was the duke of Bedford regent of France, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed princ$s in Europe either for the field or cabinet; and infinitely &s;uperior in merit to all the other per&s;ons employed in the &s;ervice.

<P>After the death of Charles VI. which happened on the twenty-fir&s;t day of October, the &s;ea&s;on would not permit the troops on either &s;ide to undertake any action of great importance, except the &s;iege of St. Valery, which was &s;ur|rendered to the Engli&s;h on capitulation. Bu&s;&s;i in the county of Gui&s;e, was likewi&s;e taken by the count de Ligni, general of the Burgundians, while Jaque de Harcour and Lahire reduced La Rue in Picardy, and Vitry in Cham|pagne, to the dominion of Charles. The duke of Bedford, in pur&s;uance of the plan which his brother Henry had projected, re&s;olved to &s;ubdue all the places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Charles on this &s;ide the Loire; and while he was employed in making preparations for executing this plan, Graville, one of the officer$ of Charles, &s;urprized Meulan by &s;calade, on the fourth day of January. As this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1423$</NOTE> place was &s;ituated within &s;ix leagues of Paris, and the reduction of it u$der his eye an in&s;ult offered to his arms, he determined to begin the campaign with the &s;iege of it, which he accordingly undertook in per&s;on in the beginning of February. Charles ordered the count d'Aumale to join the Scotti&s;h auxiliaries under general Stuart, and march to its relief; but the&s;e officers di&s;puting the chief command with each other, parted without having undertaken any thing in favour of Meulan, which Graville was obliged to &s;urrender on capitulation. After the reduction of this place, the regent repaired to Amiens, where he had an interview with the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne, which la&s;t together with his brother the count de Richemont, &s;igned a league and confederacy again&s;t Charles; and this alliance was cemented by a marriage between Bedford and Anne &s;i&s;ter of the duke of Burgundy; while the count de Richemont mar|ried an elder &s;i&s;ter of the &s;ame prince, who was widow of the dauphin Lewis.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>While he was engaged in the&s;e operations, Charles ordered Tannegui de Ch&acirc;tel to march to the relief of Montaign; but Sali&s;bury, being appri&s;ed of his intent, joined Suffolk with &s;uch expedition, that the French general was almo&s;t &s;urprized, and retreated into Burgundy, whither he was pur&s;ued by the Engli&s;h forces. Sali&s;bury, finding he could not overtake the French, inve&s;ted Crevant, a &s;trong place &s;ituated upon the Yonne, about three leagues above Auxerre. Charles then commanded Stuart to withdraw &s;ome troop$ from the neighbouring garri&s;ons, and join Ch&acirc;tel, in order to attempt the relief of the town. All the&s;e forces when joined amounted to ten thou&s;and, of which $he marechal de Severac took the command; but before the junction was effected, Sali&s;bury had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Crevant, and returned to the &s;$ege of Montaign. Though the French army could not prevent the reduction of Cre|vant, they re&s;olved to retake it immediately, and marched thither with all ex|pedition.
<PB N="298" REF="3080">
The d$tche&s;s dowager of Burgundy being then at Dijon, ordered the marechal Toulongeon to a&s;&s;emble the militia and gentlemen of that neigh|bourhood; and de&s;ired the earl of Sali&s;bury to join them with his forces, and attempt to rai&s;e the &s;iege. That nobleman complied with her reque&s;t, and &s;et out for Auxerre, at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and cho&s;en troops; there, joining the Burg$ndians, they directed their route to Crevant; and the army of Charles, being appri&s;ed of their march, took po&s;t upon a mountain, from whence they could not ea&s;ily be di&s;lodged. The Engli&s;h and Burgundians made a feint, as if they had intended to pa&s;s the river Yonne at Cologne-le-Vimeux; upon which the French quitted the ground, and po&s;ted them&s;elves on the bank of the river, in order to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age. The two armies faced one another for two hours on different &s;ides of the river, till, at length, a body of Engli&s;h, pa&s;&s;ing by a bridge, maintained their ground again&s;t the efforts of the whole French army, until all their countrymen, and the Burgundians, had made their pa&s;&s;age good. Then they attacked, in their turn, with &s;uch impetuo|&s;ity, that the marechal de St. Severac could not &s;u&s;tain the a&s;&s;ault, but retired, with his French forces, leaving the Scots under Stuart to bear the brunt of the whole battle. They fought, for a con&s;iderable time, with great ob&s;tinacy, until they were overpowered, and obliged to quit the field with the lo&s;s of twelve hundred men, who were killed upon the &s;pot, or taken pri&s;oners. Stuart and Xaintrailles, with about forty officers of di&s;tinction, fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, who did not obtain a bloodle&s;s victory; for above four hundred of their be&s;t men lo$t their lives in the engagement; and among the&s;e Sir John<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Grey, Sir William Kalk, Sir Gilbert Ha$$el, and Richard ap Madock.</P>

<P>After this victory, the earl of Sali&s;bury returned to the blockade of Montaign, the garri&s;on of which being, by this time, reduced to twenty men, capitulated; and he ordered the fortifications to be razed. Then he divided his forces with the earl of Suffolk, who made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Macon, while Sali&s;bury fini&s;hed the conque&s;t of Champagne; from whence he marched into the i$$e of France, where he reduced Coucy, and &s;ome other cattles. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the regent ordered Ralph de Boutieller to be&s;iege Crotoy in Pi$|ardy, &s;ituated on the Somme, oppo&s;ite to St. Valery, and commanded by Jaques de Harcour, who, after having made a gallant defence, agreed to &s;urrender by the fir&s;t of March, if not relieved before that time; and, as Charles made no at|tempt in his favour, he &s;urrendered accordingly to the duke of Bedford. Tho' Charles was but very ill &s;upplied with money, he payed the ran&s;om of Xain|trailles, who no &s;ooner recovered his liberty, than he found means to &s;urprize Ham and Gui&s;e, while La Hire took Compeigne in the &s;ame manner: but all the&s;e places were immediately retaken by the troops of the regent and the duke of Burgundy. About this period, Charles received a reinforcement of a thou|&s;and men at arms, and five hundred lances, from Philip Maria Vi&s;conti duke of Milan; and the&s;e troops entering the Bajolois, not only prevented the town of la Bou&s;&s;iere from falling into the hands of Toulongeon, but al&s;o &s;ur|prized that general, who was taken pri&s;oner, with &s;even hundred men, whom he had brought to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fortre&s;s, according to capitulation; but he was immediately exchanged for Stuart, who had been taken at Crevant.</P>

<P>This &s;mall advantage was followed by another of greater con&s;e|quence to Charles. John de la Pole, brother to the earl of Suffolk, with a body of troops, drawn from different garri&s;ons, had fallen into Anjou, where he burned the &s;uburbs of Angers, and obtained a con&s;iderable booty: but, in his return to Normandy, he was intercepted by the count d'Aumale, the young duke of Alen&ccedil;on, Loheac, Coutonge, and the ba&s;tard of Alen&ccedil;on, who had a&s;&s;embled a &s;trong body of troops to cut off his retreat. They came up with him at Graville in Le Maine, where, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, he was de|feated, and taken pri&s;oner, and fourteen hundred of his men killed on the field of battle. This victory revived the hopes of Charles, which the battle of Crevant had well nigh extingui&s;hed; and, what in&s;pired him with fre&s;h confi|dence, was the arrival of five thou&s;and men, whom the earl of Buchan, at this period, brought from Scotland, under the command of Archibald earl of Douglas, one of the mo&s;t renowned warriors of the age. The&s;e &s;uccours ar|rived<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> at Rochelle at a very &s;ea&s;onable juricture for Charles, who care&s;&s;ed the Scotti&s;h officers in a very extraordinary manner. Douglas was created duke of Touraine; Stuart honoured with the title of baron d'Aubigny, and afterwards made count d'Evreux: Charles cho&s;e a company of Scots for the guard of his own per&s;on, as a mark of his confidence and e&s;teem. To crown this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of favourable events, the count de Richemont being af|fronted by the regent, who refu&s;ed to tru&s;t him with the command of the army, re&s;olved to detach his brother, the duke of Brittany, from the Engli&s;h intere&s;t; and, by the mediation of the duke of Savoy, a truce was concluded between Charles and the duke of Burgundy, for the Lionnois and Burgundy, which, as well as the neighbouring provinces of France, were terribly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the interruption of commerce.</P>

<P>While France was thus expo&s;ed to all the mi&s;eries of war, England enjoyed the mo&s;t profound tranquility. The parliament meeting on the twen|tieth day of October, a new council was appointed for the government of the realm, by the intrigues of the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who, having quarreled with the duke of Glouce&s;ter, rai&s;ed an oppo&s;ition in parliament, with a view to curb the protector's powers, by enlarging tho&s;e of the council, which were accordingly augmented. This affair being &s;ettled, the mini&s;try laid before both hou&s;es, the &s;tate of a negotiation with the Scots, touching the ran&s;om of king James; and the parliament approved of the &s;teps which had been taken. A law was enacted again&s;t the exportation of gold and &s;ilver out of the kingdom, except what was barely nece&s;&s;ary for the payment of the troops in France, and a &s;ub&s;idy was granted for the maintenance of the war in that country.</P>

<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; X.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Glouce&s;ter and the council perceiving, that the Scotti&s;h nation adopted other maxims than tho&s;e they had pur&s;ued under the regency of the late duke of Albany; and that they exerted them&s;elves in behalf of the French king, with a &s;pirit that &s;eemed to be the re&s;ult of their re&s;enting their own king's captivity, re&s;olved, in good earne&s;t, to &s;et James at liberty, on &s;uch condi|tions as would attach him to the intere&s;t of England. His &s;ubjects were ex|tremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing him return, and take the admini&s;tration of the realm from Murdoc duke of Albany, who was a weak prince, without re&s;olution or authority; and &s;everal negotiations had been &s;et on foot for the relea&s;e of their lawful &s;overeign: but hitherto they had proved ineffectual, becau&s;e the Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="300" REF="3100">
thought it their intere&s;t to detain him in their power$ &s;uppo&s;ing, that while he remained in captivity, his &s;ubjects would take no material &s;teps to the prejudice of England. By this time, however, they had found them&s;elves mi&s;taken in their conjecture, and &s;aw no expedient &s;o likely to put an end to the alliance between France and Scotland, as that of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing king James in terms of friend&s;hip with England. Safe-conducts were granted to the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners to come to London, in order to treat about their king's deli|verance; and the bi&s;hops of Durham and Worce&s;ter, the earls of Northum|berland and We&s;tmoreland, the lords Nevil, Cornwal, and Chaworth, were ap|pointed as deputies to di&s;cu&s;s the articles. They were impowered, by their in&s;truc|tions, to con&s;ent to the relea&s;e of James, on condition, that he &s;hould pay forty thou&s;and marks for the expence of his maintenance during his captivity in Eng|land: and that he &s;hould conclude a truce with Henry, during which, the two kings &s;hould not a&s;&s;i&s;t the enemies of each other. They were likewi&s;e de&s;ired to in&s;inuate, that this peace might be happily cemented by a marriage between the king of Scotland, and &s;ome Engli&s;h lady of the blood$royal. The fir&s;t conference was held at York, when the plenipotentiaries agreed upon the ar|ticles of the king's relea&s;e; and, in the &s;econd at London, they regulated the manner in which the &s;um &s;hould be payed, together with the quality of the ho&s;tages to be left by way of &s;ecurity. There too, it was &s;tipulated, that the king of Scotland &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e Jane of Somer&s;et, &s;i&s;ter to the duke of that name, and niece to the duke of Exeter and bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; and that Henry's council &s;hould abate ten thou&s;and marks of the &s;um, in con&s;ideration of this marriage. Then the commi&s;&s;ioners of both nations &s;igned a truce for &s;even years, by which James engaged to recal his troops from France before the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> month of May next en&s;uing; tho' he could not an&s;wer for their obedience. This treaty was confirmed by the parliament, which was prorogued from De|cember to January; and, James, after a captivity of &s;eventeen years, returned to his own country.</P>

<P>The war in France was &s;till maintained with various &s;ucce&s;s; and the regent exerted all his activity and conduct in attempting to clear the nor|thern provinces of the troops and adherents of Charles; but he found this a very difficult ta&s;k; for he had no &s;ooner reduced one place by force, than the enemy took another by &s;urprize; &s;o that his labour &s;eemed to be endle&s;s and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1424.</NOTE> ineffectual. While he was employed in the reduction of &s;everal little ca&s;tles in the i&s;le of France, he received intelligence that Giraut, one of the officers of Charles, had &s;urpri&s;ed Ivry, a place of importance, on the frontiers of Nor|mandy; and he forthwith marched thither to retake it, before the French could have time to put it in a proper po&s;ture of defence. The &s;iege was undertaken in the beginning of July, and Giraut capitulated to &s;urrender, if not relieved by the fifteenth day of Augu&s;t. Charles, being informed of this agreement, re&s;olved to &s;uccour the place, though at the hazard of a battle; and immedi|ately a&s;&s;embled an army in Le Maine, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty thou&s;and men, Scots, French, and Italians. The command naturally belonged to the earl of Buchan, as con&s;table of France; but he yielded that honour to his father|in-law the earl of Douglas, whom Charles con&s;tituted his lieutenant-general for the whole kingdom. All the nobility, who adhered to Charles, joined the army on this occa&s;ion, in order to &s;ignalize their courage; and, on the
<PB N="301" REF="3110">
twelfth day of Augu&s;t, they marched by the walls of Vernueil, which was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h. Next day they came in &s;ight of the regent's army, which was &s;o &s;trongly intrenched before Ivry, that Douglas deemed the at|tack impracticable, and marched back towards Vernueil, which &s;urrendered on the fir&s;t &s;ummons, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Engli&s;h army was defeated, and the &s;iege of Ivry rai&s;ed, according to the report of the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XII.</HEAD>
<P>The earl of Sali&s;bury being appri&s;ed of the enemy's march, ha&s;tened to the regent with a reinforcement of a thou&s;and men at arms, and two thou&s;and $rchers, which augmented the number of the Engli&s;h to thirteen thou&s;and vete|rans, who were more than a match for the like number of any troops in Europe. Ivry was &s;urrendered at the appointed time, according to the capitulation; and next day the duke of Bedford marched towards Vernueil, in order to bring the enemy to a battle. He halted at the di&s;tance of a league from their camp, and &s;ent an herald with a defiance, and a particular me&s;&s;age to Douglas, import|ing, that he was come to dine with him: To this the other replied, that he &s;hould be welcome, and find the cloth ready laid. The regent, in&s;tead of proceeding to the attack, pitched upon a convenient &s;pot for a field of battle, flanked by a hill, on which he po&s;ted two thou&s;and archers; and he provided his &s;oldiers with &s;harp &s;takes, like tho&s;e that were u&s;ed at Agincourt, to re$i&s;t the French cavalry, among which he knew there was a great number of young noblemen, who would not $ail to attack him on the ground he h$d cho&s;en for his own advantage: nor was he mi&s;taken in his notion of that head&s;trong im|petuo&s;ity, by which the French had lo&s;t &s;o many deci&s;ive battles. Douglas having, in per&s;on, ob&s;erved the Engli&s;h camp, a&s;&s;embled a council of wa$, and repre&s;ented, that as the duke of Bedford had cho&s;en his own ground, where he could not be attacked without manife&s;t di&s;advantage, their bu&s;ine&s;s was to maintain their po&s;t, and n$t hazard a battle, in which the king's in|tere&s;t mu&s;t run an unnece&s;&s;ary ri&s;que.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XIII.</HEAD>
<P>This &s;alutary advice, which the con&s;table, and all the officers of ex|perience, approved, was vehemently oppo&s;ed by Aymervi&s;count of Navbonne, who treated it as the effect of timidity, and declaimed upon the glory of France, and the di&s;grace that would be entailed upon the arms of the king, &s;hould they avoid an engagment, when they were &s;o &s;uperior to the enemy in number. He was &s;e|conded by all the young nobility; and the council was filled with tumult and debate: at length this ra&s;h, unthinking nobleman, exclaimed, "Let tho&s;e who love the "king follow me;" then, ru&s;hing from the council, attended by tho&s;e who e&s;|pou&s;ed his opinion, he drew up his men in order of battle, and commanded them to di&s;play his banner. Douglas and the con&s;table finding all their remon&s;trances ineffectual, and their authority de&s;pi&s;ed, re&s;olved to do their utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;upport tho&s;e head&s;trong adventurers; or, if that &s;hould prove ineffectual, to wa&s;h out, with their own blood, the &s;tain which had been &s;o unju&s;tly thrown upon their honour. With this view they endeavoured to form their troops, but the vi&s;count of Narbonne, and his a&s;&s;ociates, had already began their career, and the re&s;t of the army followed them in &s;uch a tumultuous manner, that it was found impo&s;&s;ible to bring them under any regularity of rank or di&s;cipline, while the two chiefs were hurried along with the multitude. By that time the Engli&s;h camp appeared in view, their breath and &s;pirits were almo&s;t exhau&s;ted; and here the generals made another effort to reduce them to order, by exhort|ing
<PB N="302" REF="3120">
them to halt, and recover breath before they &s;hould begin the battle; but they &s;till lent a deaf ear to all their intreaties; and the French and Scots vied with each other, in ru&s;hing foremo&s;t to the &s;cene of their de&s;truction. The Ita|lians having received a &s;hower of arrows from the Engli&s;h archers that $$anked them upon the hill, betook them&s;elves to flight in the very beginning of the on&s;et; but the re&s;t of the$ army charged with incredible impetuo&s;ity, &s;o as to di&s;order one of the wings of the Engli&s;h. They even broke through them as far as a barricade formed in the rear with the waggons of the army, behind which was po&s;ted a body of archers that received them with a terrible di&s;charge. When they wheeled, in order to attack the&s;e bowmen on the flanks, they found them defended by their &s;takes, in &s;uch a manner, that they could make no impre&s;&s;ion; while they them&s;elves were &s;o expo&s;ed to the flights of arrows, that few or none of them e&s;caped with life from this encounter. Mean while the main bodies of both armies fought with &s;uch equal fury and re&s;olu|tion, that, for three hours, it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern any advantage on ei|ther &s;ide; at length, the Engli&s;h body of re&s;erve, which had defeated the Ita|lian men at arms and French cavalry, fell upon the flank of the S$ots, and decided the fortune of the day. Douglas and the con&s;table &s;eeing their over|throw inevitable, &s;corned to outlive the di&s;a&s;ter, and, ru&s;hing into the hotte&s;t part of the battle, fell in the mid&s;t of their enemies. This was likewi&s;e the $ate of the indi&s;creet Narbonne, Ventadour, Graville, and Rambouillet. The other principal officers were &s;o grievou&s;ly wounded, that they could no longer act; &s;o that the me$, being deprived of their leaders, fought at random, until they were ro$ted and di&s;per&s;ed with great &s;laughter. The Italians, who had quitted the field in the beginning of the engagement, being informed that the French had the advantage, returned for their &s;hare of the plunder, and were received by the victorious Engli&s;h in &s;uch a manner, that not a man would have e&s;caped alive, had not they been favoured by the night. Five thou&s;and Scots and French were left dead upon the field of battle, and a great number was wounded and taken; among others, the marechal de la Fayette and Gau|cour; and the young duke of Alen&ccedil;on, being found &s;till breathing, was ch$|ri&s;hed with &s;uch care by the regent, that he recovered of his wounds, which were extremely dangerous. This victory, though of infinite importance to the regent, was not purcha&s;ed cheaply; ina&s;much as he lo&s;t &s;eventeen hun|dred of his be&s;t men, who fell in the field; and, among the&s;e, &s;ome officers of di&s;$i$ctio$. Next day the duke of Bedford inve&s;ted Vernueil, the garri&s;on of which was commanded by Rambure, who being but very ill provided with nece&s;&s;aries, &s;urrendered in three days on capitulation. In this place the Eng|li&s;h $ound all the baggage belonging to the French, Scotti&s;h, and Italian ge|nerals, together with the money de&s;tined for the pay of the &s;oldiers; and, meet|ing with the corp&s;e of the vi&s;count Narbonne, on the way to interment, they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul. Aemil. Sto$e. Gagui$.</NOTE> &s;eized and hung it on a gibbet, becau&s;e that nobleman had been concerned in the murder of the duke of Burgundy.</P>

<P>After the victory at Vernueil, the duke of Bedford returned to Paris to quell an in&s;urrection which had been rai&s;ed in that city, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he would be defeated; while the earl of Sali&s;bury reduced the city of Mans, St. Su&s;anne, and La-fert&eacute; Bernard, and fini&s;hed the conque&s;t of Le Maine. All the places that favoured Charles were now filled with con&s;terna|tion;
<PB N="303" REF="3130">
and all his friends began to de&s;pair of his cau&s;e. He him&s;elf, though a prince of great vivacity and per&s;everance, would in all probability have yielded to the torrent of misfortune, had not the approach of winter afforded him &s;ome re&s;pite from the pur&s;uit of his enemies. But even the winter would not have prevented his ruin, if another unexpected event had not intervened. This was no other than a quarrel between the dukes of Burgundy and Glouce&s;ter, which without all que&s;tion pre&s;erved the crown of France to the hou&s;e of Valois. We have already ob&s;erved that the duke of Glouce&s;ter had married Jaquelina, heire&s;s of Hainault, even during the life of her other hu&s;band the duke of Brabant, who was fir&s;t cou&s;in to the duke of Burgundy. This la&s;t prince fore&s;eeing that &s;uch a marriage would be productive of animo&s;ity and war be|tween the two hu&s;bands, had a conference on the &s;ubject with the duke of Bedford at Amiens, and afterwards another at Paris, where they agreed in opinion that the affair ought to be left to the deci&s;ion of the pope, who was the natural judge in all &s;uch cau&s;es. The duke of Brabant $&s;&s;ented to the pro|po&s;al, in full confidence that his holine&s;s would &s;ee no cau&s;e to annul his mar|riage with J$q$$lina; but the duke of Glouce&s;ter refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent for the &s;ame rea&s;on, though he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf inclined to a rea&s;onable accommo|dation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XV.</HEAD>
<P>The affair continued in &s;u&s;pence till the battle of Vernueil; after which the duke of Glouce&s;ter cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to Calais, with his wife, and a body of five thou&s;and men, to wre&s;t Jaquelina's dominions from the hands of the duke of Brabant. His de&s;ign was altogether a &s;ecret to the duke of Bur|gundy, who believed he was come to reinforce the regent; he was therefore not $ little &s;urprized when he heard, during his re&s;idence at Dijon, that the duke of Glouce$ter had traver&s;ed part of his dominions; and that all the towns of Hainaul$ had &s;ubmitted and taken the oath of allegiance to him and Jaquelina. He forthwith ordered his generals Ligni and l'I&s;le Adam to a&s;&s;emble an army, and join the count of St. Pol, who was employed at Bru&s;&s;els in rai&s;ing forces for the &s;ervice of his brother the duke of Brabant. How un&s;ea&s;on|able for England this rupture with the duke of Burgundy mu&s;t have been, will appear, when we ob&s;erve that the affairs of Charles were at this juncture in a de&s;perate condition. The battles of Crevant and Vern$cil had deprived him of his be&s;t troops and generals. He was without money and credit, ut|terly incapable of bringing an army into the field. The dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne, the mo&s;t powerful va&s;&s;als of his crown, were intimately con|nected with the Engli&s;h. His brother-in-law the king of Sicily had lo&s;t L$ Maine, and could hardly pre&s;erve his other dominions; and the king of Scot|land, the ancient ally of France, was by his truce with England hindered from &s;upplying him with a reinforcement. Reduced to this melancholy &s;ituation, he $aw him&s;elf repul&s;ed to the other &s;ide of the Loire, and in imminent dan|ger of being hunted out of the provinces of Berry, La$guedoc, and Da$phin$$ the Engli&s;h gave him no other title than that of count of Po$thieu, or king of $ou$ges, in deri&s;ion. The duke of Bedford was &s;en&s;ible of all his advantages, and knew that if his brother Glouce&s;ter would have, at this criti$$l period, joined him with $he forces and money he had brought to Calais, the conque&s;t of Franc$ would have been fini&s;hed in one camp$ign. He wrote to him on this &s;ubject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 142$.</NOTE> conju$ing him to po$$pone his de&s;igns again&s;t the duke of Brabant, until he
<PB N="304" REF="3140">
could be &s;upported with the united &s;trength of France and England. But his remon$$rances had no weight with Glouce&s;ter, who could not be prevailed upon to let &s;l$p this opportunity of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the four faire&s;t provinces in the Low Countries. The regent, on account of this unlucky diver&s;ion, could draw no new reinforcement $rom England; and his army being almo&s;t wholly divided among a great number of ca&s;ties and towns, which he was obliged to garri&s;on, he found him&s;elf di&s;abled from pro&s;ecuting his conque&s;ts.</P>

<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XVI.</HEAD>
<P>In the orders which the duke of Burgundy i&s;&s;ued to his generals for levying troops in favour of his kin&s;man the duke of Brabant, he declared that this prince had agreed to the expedient propo&s;ed, with the con&s;ent of the duke of Bedford; and that Glouce&s;ter had rejected the equitable propo&s;al. Hum|phrey, incen&s;ed at this a&s;&s;ertion, wrote a letter to him from Mons, in which he taxed him with having advanced what was not &s;trictly conformable to truth. The duke of Burgundy, in his an&s;wer, gave him the lie, and offered to main|tain his a&s;&s;ertion in &s;ingle combat, to be judged by his own brother the duke of Bedford. Glouce&s;ter accepted the challenge; the fe&s;tival of St. George was fixed for the day of trial; and in the mean time, tho&s;e two princes in|&s;ulted each other in the mo&s;t outrageous manner, both by letters and me&s;|&s;ages. In this interval, the count of St. Pol be&s;ieged and took the little town of Braine in Hainault; putting the Engli&s;h garri&s;on to the &s;wo$d, notwith&s;tand|ing the capitulation, and then reduced the place to a&s;hes. Neverthele&s;s, as the quarrel between the dukes of Glouce&s;ter and Brabant might be terminated by the combat between Humphrey and the duke of Burgundy, they agreed to a truce until that affair &s;hould be decided, and Glouce&s;ter returned to Eng|land. He would have carried his duche&s;s along with him, had not the inha|bitants of Mons de&s;ired, with the mo&s;t earne&s;t intreaties, that &s;he might be permitted to remain in that city. He could not re&s;i&s;t their pre&s;&s;ing $ollicita|tions; but he exacted a &s;olemn oath of the magi&s;trates, that they would de|fend<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo$$$relet.</NOTE> her at the hazard of their lives again&s;t all her enemies.</P>

<P>Charles, in order to make his advantage of the&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions, en|deavoured to detach the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne from the intere&s;ts of the Engli&s;h. He knew that the count de Richemont was incen&s;ed again&s;t the duke of Bedford, who had refu&s;ed to confer upon him the command of the army: he was well acquainted with the pride and vanity of that nobleman; and the&s;e, by proper emi&s;&s;aries, he flattered in &s;uch a manner, that the count agreed to accept of the conftable's office, vacant &s;ince the death of B$chan; and even undertook to bring over his brother the duke of Bretagne to the intere&s;t of Charles, provided that prince would bani&s;h Louvet from his councils, and procure the con&s;ent of the duke of Burgundy to his engaging in the king's &s;ervice. Charles accordingly declared him con&s;table of France, as the duke did not object to this promotion; but this prince, though irritated again&s;t the duke of Glouce&s;ter, and the Engli&s;h in general, had not &s;o entirely forgot his father's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, as to li&s;ten to the propo&s;als of the king, who had &s;ent the bi&s;hops of Puy and Chartres, to detach him, if po&s;&s;ible, from the intere&s;t of Henry. They endeavoured to excu&s;e Charles with regard to his father's death, by &s;aying he was mi&s;led by evil coun&s;ellors; and the duke took this opportunity to tell them, that when his maje&s;ty &s;hould have bani&s;hed tho&s;e
<PB N="305" REF="3150">
evil coun&s;ellors from his pre&s;ence, it would then be a proper time to talk of accommodation. The&s;e were Tann$gui de Cha$el and Louvet, who &s;till main|tained the foremo&s;t place in his favour. The fir&s;t being apprized of the duke's declaration, in&s;i&s;ted upon being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice; and Charles granted his reque&s;t with great reluctance: but the other was not &s;o hone&s;t as to &s;acri|fice his own private advantage to his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t. He not only enjoyed a large &s;hare of his &s;overeign's favour; but his credit was corroborated by the influence of his daughter, married to the lord of Joyeu&s;e, who, with the fa|mous Agnes Sorel, divided the affection of Charles.

<P>The court of Henry was as much di&s;turbed by faction as that of Charles. The duke of Glouce&s;ter, and his uncle the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;t$r, hated each other with implacable rancour. That prelate had oppo&s;ed with all his might the expedition to Hainault; though the duke's inter$&s;t prevailed in the council: but, in the ab&s;ence of Glouce&s;ter, the other acquired &s;uch in|fluence, that when he returned, the bi&s;hop's credit &s;eemed to preponderate. Their quarrel was immediately revived, and broke out in divers tumults and frays between their parti&s;ans. The bi&s;hop wrote a letter to the duke of B$d|ford, intreating him in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner to return and reform the abu&s;es occa&s;ioned by his brother's mi&s;conduct; and Glouce&s;ter drew up ar|ticles of impeachment, to be pre&s;ented again&s;t Winche&s;ter at the en&s;uing parlia|ment. The duke of Bedford, finding his pre&s;ence ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in England, left the command of the army in France to the earl of Warwick, and arrived on the twentieth day of December in England, where he was received by the council and the nation, in quality of protector. In a few days after his return, he explained the &s;tate of affairs in France to the council; and, in par|ticular, expatiated on the infidelity of the count de Richemont, and his bro|ther the duke of Brittany, again&s;t whom war was declared by public procla|mation, on the fifteenth day of January. The next affair which engro&s;&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the attention of the protector, was the quarrel between his brother and uncle, which he employed all his influence to accommodate. He convoked an a&s;|&s;embly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

There the duke of Glouce&s;ter exhibited his articles of impeach|ment, which being examined by a committee, appeared frivolous, and the bi&s;hop was acquitted. Then the parliament exhorted both parties to lay a&s;ide their mutual animo&s;ity; and they $mbraced each other with exterior marks of

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Engla$d, t$$ con&s;table Richemont a&s;|&s;embled an army of twenty thou&s;and men in Britanny; and entering Nor|$$ndy, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Po$tor&s;on about the l$tter end of February: then he undertook the $$$ge of St. James de $euvron, where was a numerous garri&s;on of Engli&s;h troops, which defended it with extraordinary $alour. He expected a &s;upply of money from De Giac, who had &s;ucc$eded Louvet in the management of the finances; but that mini&s;ter fearing he would become in|tolerably in&s;olent, and govern the court according to his own fancy, &s;hould $e &s;ucceed in this enterprize, re&s;olved to di&s;appoint him in his expectation. The con&s;table &s;eeing his army dimini&s;h every day by de&s;ertion, conceived the mo&s;t violent indignation again&s;t De Giac, and became almo&s;t frantic with the apprehen&s;ion of being di&s;graced in his fir&s;t military undertaking. At length, being alarmed with a fal&s;e report that the enemies were on their march to the relief of the place, he re&s;olved to give the a&s;&s;ault, tho$gh the breach was hardly practicable; and detached two thou&s;and men upon the road to Avranche, in order to keep the Engli&s;h in play, &s;hould they come up during the attack. This di&s;po&s;ition being made, he &s;tormed the breach with great fury; but met with &s;uch a warm reception, that there was very little appear|ance of his carrying the place by a&s;&s;ault. The detachment &s;eeing no enemy approaching, de&s;erted their po&s;t, and returned to the camp, with a view to &s;hare in the glory and &s;poils of the day; and they came on in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that the a$$ailants concluded they were repul&s;ed by the Engli&s;h army, and $ere in&s;tantly &s;eized with c$n&s;ternation. They forthwith quitted the a&s;&s;ault; and &s;uch was the pannic which prevailed among them, that all the con&s;table's endeavours could not bring them back to the charge. The be&s;ieged per|ceiving their di&s;order, made a furious &s;ally, and fell among them with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that they fled with precipitation, leaving their baggage and ar|tillery in the hands of the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>Richemont was infinitely $ortified at this di&s;grace, and &s;o ex|a&s;perated again&s;t De Giac, to whom he imputed the di&s;a&s;ter, that $e vowed revenge again&s;t him, and ex$cuted it with the fir&s;t opportunity. Having

rallied his forces, he fell into Anjou, where he reduced La Fleche and Gal|lerande; and the campaign being ended, returned to court, where he cau&s;ed De Giac to be &s;trangled in his bed, and thr$wn into the Loire; and publicly declared he would treat in the &s;ame manner, any man who &s;hould pre&s;ume to engro&s;s the king's favour. Accordingly the Camus of Beaulieu, who ventured to accept of the place vacated by the death of De Giac, was in a few days a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in the king's palace by the direction of this $erocious con&s;table, who would &s;uffer none to re&s;ide at court but &s;uch as depended entirely on his favour. Charles was &s;o incen&s;ed at his in&s;olence and pre&s;umption, that he not only re|fu&s;ed to &s;ee him, but even trembled with rage when his name was mentioned; neverthele&s;s, &s;uch was the de&s;porate &s;ituation of his affairs, that he had no other re&s;ource but his army of Bretons, and was therefore obliged to keep terms with Richemont.</P>

<P>The earl of Warwick, who commanded the Engli&s;h troops in the ab&s;ence of the regent, was &s;o weakened by the duke of Glouce&s;ter's war in Hai|nault, that he had not forces &s;ufficient to take the field again&s;t the con&s;table: but now that the troops of Brittany were dimini&s;hed by de&s;ertion, and the court of Charles was embroiled with di&s;&s;en&s;ions, he a&s;&s;embled a body of five thou&s;and men; and after having retaken &s;ome ca&s;tles in Le Maine, which had fallen into the hands of the $retons, he undertook the &s;iege of Montargis, a place of great importance, &s;ituated on the $iver Loin, where it divides into three branches. His army being too incon&s;iderable to attack the town in form, he converted the &s;iege into a blockade, and of con&s;equence divided his forces into three bodies, &s;eparated by the branches of the river, over which, however, he threw wooden bridges of communication. The&s;e different divi&s;ions were commanded by him|&s;elf, the earl of Suffolk, and John de la Pole, brother to that nobleman. The blockade had already continued three months, and the be$ieged were reduced to extremity, when Charles de&s;ired the con&s;table to attempt their relief; but his army being by this time di&s;$anded, he would not expo&s;e him&s;elf to another di&s;grace with raw troops occa&s;ionally rai&s;ed. What he declined was undertaken by the Ba&s;tard of Orleans, who, though no more than two and twenty years of age, had already given repeated p$oofs of extraordinary courage and conduct. He a&s;&s;embled about &s;ixteen hundred men, and con&s;idently marched towards Montargis, upon an enterprize of the utmo&s;t difficulty, to be atchieved again&s;t the earl of Warwick, who&s;e reputation was equal to that of the greate&s;t gene|rals. The be&s;i$ged had by this time opened their &s;luices, &s;o as to overflow the bridges of communication between the Engli&s;h quarters; and the Ba&s;tard re|&s;olved to attack them &s;eparately before the water &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide. He gave one half of his troops to Lahire, with orders to attack the quarter of de la Pole, while $e him&s;elf charged the earl of Suffolk. After an ob&s;tinate engagement the earl and his brother were defea$ed, with the lo&s;s of fifteen hundred men, the greater part of whom was drowned in the river; and the earl of Warwick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai. Mon&s;trelet.</NOTE> finding it impo&s;&s;ible to give them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, retired in good order. The place was immediately relieved; and this exploit was con&s;idered as an happy omen of the Ba&s;tard's future &s;ucce&s;s: but this advantage was followed by no other operation of con&s;equence; for both &s;ides were &s;o weak, that they thought proper to act on the defen&s;ive only.</P>

<P>The duel between the dukes of Glouce&s;ter and Burgundy had been put off by common con&s;ent; and in the mean time this la&s;t employed his emi&s;&s;aries among the people of Hainault, in order to form a party that &s;hould deliver Jaqueline into the hands of her lawful hu&s;band the duke of Bra|bant. The&s;e negotiations being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the prince&s;s's own mother, who was bia$&s;ed in favour of Burgundy, were attended with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that all of a &s;udden the towns of Hainault declared for the duke of Brabant; and his bro|ther the count of St. Pol, pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the head of an army before Mons, where the dutche&s;s re&s;ided. The magi&s;trates, feigning the utmo&s;t terror at his approach, declared them&s;elves altogether incapable of defending the town, and entered into a treaty with him, by which it was &s;tipulated that Jaqueline &s;hould be delivered into the hands of the duke of Burgundy, who &s;hould take charge of her per&s;on until the di&s;pute could be terminated by the pope's deci&s;ion. She was accordingly conducted to Ghent by the prince of Orange; and all the dutchy of Hainault unanimou&s;ly acknowledged the duke of Brabant for their &s;overeign.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1427.</NOTE> The war in France &s;till langui&s;hed, for want of men on both &s;ides to undertake any enterprize of importance. The earl of Suffolk was &s;urprized in Mans by the count d'Orval of the hou&s;e of Albret, and obliged to take re|fuge in a tower, from whence he was delivered by the gallantry of Talbot, who expelled the French in his turn; and after having taken Laval in Maine, joined the earl of Warwick, in order to carry on the &s;iege of Pontor&s;on, which had been reduced by the con&s;table during the cour&s;e of the preceding year. About this period the duke of Bedford arrived in France, with a reinforcement of troops that enabled him to execute &s;chemes of importance. He was accompanied by the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who received the cardinal's hat at Calais with great &s;olemnity; and, as being a prince of the blood, was afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Cardinal of England: in a little time after this promotion he was appointed the pope's legate in this kingdom; an office which enabled him to im|prove his wealth and influence, to the prejudice and ruin of his enemy the duke of Glouce&s;ter. Mean while the court of Charles was more and more di&s;tracted by di&s;&s;en&s;ions of the mini&s;ters and nobility. La Tremouille had now engro&s;&s;ed the king's favour; and though he had formerly profe&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip for the con&s;table, he no &s;ooner &s;ucceeded Beaulieu in the management of the finances, than he changed his conduct towards Richemont, and $omented the king's aver|&s;ion to that nobleman. The other courtiers were incen&s;ed at his behaviour, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that there was no other per&s;on but the con&s;table who could re|e&s;tabli&s;h the affairs of France; and they entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the life of the mini&s;ter. The counts of Clermont and La Marche were at the head of this a&s;&s;ociation, and a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, with which they endeavoured to &s;urprize him at Bourges; but under&s;tanding that he had followed the king
<PB N="309" REF="3190">
to Loches, they re&s;olved to &s;eize his two creatures La Borde and De Prie, who fled for refuge into the great tower, which was immediately inve&s;ted. De Prie was killed fighting in his own defence, but the other held out until he was relieved by the king in per&s;on. This quarrel degenerated into a civil war which raged &s;everal months, and was at la&s;t terminated by the mediation of the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, who had been taken at the battle of Verneuil, and lately ran&s;omed for two hundred thou&s;and crowns, a &s;um he could not rai&s;e without &s;elling all his jewels, together with the town of Fougeres to the duke of Brit|tany: but by this time the con&s;table had retired in di&s;gu&s;t to Vannes, and Charles had very little rea&s;on to hope for a continuation of his &s;ervice and good offices. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE></P>

<P>The deplorable condition of Charles, de&s;titute of forces, officers, and money, and embroiled in tho&s;e dome&s;tic di&s;quiets, furni&s;hed the regent with an opportunity to execute a &s;cheme he had projected in England. Pontor|&s;on having &s;urrendered after a long &s;iege, he took the field in per&s;on, at the head of twenty thou&s;and men, in order to fall upon Brittany, which he threatened with ruin and de&s;olation. Whether the &s;overeign of that country was actually intimidated by the regent's menaces, or glad of a pretence for abandoning a &s;inking cau&s;e, which he e&s;pou&s;ed merely out of complai&s;ance to his brother Richemont, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the duke of Bedford, &s;olliciting peace on his own terms; and it was granted on condition of his &s;wearing to ob&s;erve the peace of Troye, and to do homage to young Henry, whenever it &s;hould be re|quired.

At length, by the interce&s;&s;ion of the regent, the de&s;ign of the duel was laid a&s;ide, and a truce concluded, during which Glou|ce&s;ter was prevailed upon to leave his di&s;pute with the duke of Brabant to the pope's determination. His holine&s;s, in a little time after this reference, pub|li&s;hed his &s;entence, by which he annulled and di&s;&s;olved the marriage between Jaquelina and the duke of Glouce&s;ter, and confirmed her former contract with the duke of Brabant, who did not long &s;urvive this arbitration. Upon the death of that prince, who was &s;ucceeded by his brother the count of St. Pol, Jaquelina ought to have retaken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her own territories; but the in|trigues of the duke of Burgundy had &s;uch an effect upon her &s;ubjects, that they refu&s;ed to acknowledge her for their &s;overeign; and the duke being cho&s;en umpire between her and them, obliged her to put the government of her do|minions into his hands, to con&s;titute him her heir, and oblige her&s;elf to pa&s;s the re&s;t of her days in a &s;tate of widowhood.

As &s;oon as he brought that reinforcement to Paris, the rege$t be&s;towed upon him the command of an army amounting to &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, in order to reduce all the places that were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Charles on this $ide of the Loire, and to drive him intirely out of the northern provinces. He began his march towards the Loire, accompanied by the earl of Suffolk, by Talbot, Fa$tol$e, and &s;everal other officers of di&s;tinction, and in a council of war re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of Orleans; though this re&s;olu|tion was taken without the knowledge and contrary to the opinion of the duke of Bedford.

About the latter end of Fe|bruary, a country wench called Joan of Arc, native of the village of Danremy in Lorraine, addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Robert de Baudricourt governor of Vau-cou|leurs; and affirmed that &s;he had a commi&s;&s;ion from heaven to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Orleans, and conduct Charles to Rheims, where he &s;hould be anointed and con|&s;ecrated. Robert &s;ent this dam&s;el to the king at Chinon; and whether &s;he was really a vi&s;ionary, who thought her&s;elf actuated by divine in&s;piration, or only u&s;ed as an in&s;trument for the execution of a &s;cheme which the court had con|trived to revive the &s;pirits of the French, broken by &s;o many repeated defeats, certain it is &s;he was received as &s;omething &s;upernatural. She di&s;covered the king, whom &s;he had never &s;een before, in &s;pite of a di&s;gui&s;e he had a&s;&s;umed to deceive her; and the doctors of theology being ordered to examine her, de|clared that her vocation was altogether miraculous. The parliament of Poi|$iers, after the like enquiry, e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ame opinion; and the king gave out that &s;he had explained to him certain &s;ecrets, which &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly know but by divine revelation. By the&s;e means every body was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the Maiden; and the people in general believed &s;he was expre&s;ly &s;ent

of God for the Talvation of the kingdom. Hitherto the &s;cheme, as in all pro|bability it was, &s;ucceeded to the wi&s;h of the projector. Joan of Arc was looked upon with adoration; and the French troops glowed with impatience to retrieve their honour, under the au&s;pices of this female champion. She was certainly endowed with the courage and add$e&s;s of an amazon, and her natural intrepidity was flattered by the arts of &s;uper&s;tition; &s;o that &s;he was wrought up to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m that overlooked every &s;pecies of danger. She a&s;|&s;umed the habit and armour of a man, and was furni&s;hed with a &s;word from the tomb of a renowned knight, in the church of St. Catherine de Fierbois.</P>

<P>The French &s;oldiery being thus animated, Charles &s;ent a convoy towards Orleans, guarded by a &s;trong body of troops, whom the Maiden had a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s; and when they approached the gate of Burgundy, the Ba&s;tard made a &s;ally to favour their entrance: a long and ob&s;tinate engagement en&s;ued; and, the Engli&s;h being defeated, Joan entered Orleans at the head of the convoy, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, who were now fully &s;ati&s;|fied of her divine mi&s;&s;ion. That this &s;pirit might not be allowed to cool, &s;he, on the fourth day of May, attacked the fort of St. Loup, which was one of tho&s;e the Engli&s;h had rai&s;ed for the blockade of the place; and, after a furious di&s;pute of four hours, carried it &s;word in hand, again&s;t a garri&s;on of twelve hundred men, four hundred of whom were killed in the a&s;&s;ault. In two days after this action, &s;he proceeded again&s;t the fort of St. John, where &s;he met with very little re&s;i&s;tance from the Engli&s;h, who had well nigh abandoned it before her approach. Having &s;ecured this conque&s;t, &s;he marched immedi|ately again&s;t the fort of London, which was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the whole number, and took it by &s;trom, after a very ob&s;tinate engagement. Without giving her troops the lea&s;t re&s;pite, &s;he led them, that &s;ame evening, again$t the fort of Tournelles, but, for want of day$light, was obliged to po&s;t|pone the attack till next morning, when &s;he began the a$$ault, which conti|$ued fourteen hours without intermi&s;&s;ion. The French were repul&s;ed four times, and as often led back to the charge by Joan in per&s;on, notwith&s;tand|ing her being &s;hot with an arrow between the neck and the &s;houlder; at length the fort was taken, and &s;ix hundred of the garri&s;on cut in pieces.</P>

<P>Such a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s, evidently owing to the valour of this vir$go, who was extolled as an apo&s;tle from heaven, produced univer&s;al con|&s;ternation among the Engli&s;h. Though they did not believe the divinity of her mi&s;&s;ion, they conceived a notion rather more ab&s;urd, and &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he acted by compact with the devil. The lo&s;s of &s;o many forts, and the dejection of the &s;oldiers, rendering it impo&s;&s;ible to carry on the operations of the &s;iege, the earl of Suffolk abandoned the enterprize, after having lain &s;even months before the place, and retired in di&s;order, not without con&s;iderable lo&s;s from the be&s;ieged, who now pur&s;ued them, in their turn, though greatly inferior in number. Such a panic prevailed among the Engli&s;h, that they were afraid of facing tho&s;e troops whom they had &s;o often defeated, and &s;o lately de&s;pi&s;ed. The very generals &s;eemed to be &s;tupified with terror; for, in&s;tead of keeping their forces together in a body, until they &s;hould have recollected them&s;elves from this infa$uation, they di&s;tributed great part of the army in places near the Loire, which they had reduced before they undertook the &s;iege of Or|leans, and retreated with the re&s;t to a great di&s;tance: &s;o that the enemy had
<PB N="313" REF="3230">
lei&s;ure to retake the towns and fortre&s;&s;es which they had thus garri&s;oned. The earl of Suffolk had imprudently thrown him&s;elf, with four hundred men only, into Gergeau, where he was made pri&s;oner; and all the other places but Baugency, were again brought under the dominion of Charles, who now re|&s;olved to go and be con&s;ecrated at Rheims, though that city was &s;till in the hands of the Engli&s;h. This expedition, however, he would not undertake until he &s;hould have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Baugency, which he immediately inve&s;ted; and, while employed in this &s;iege, he was joined by the con&s;table de Richemont, who, hearing of his &s;ucce&s;s, laid a&s;ide his re&s;entment, and rai&s;ed twelve hundred hor&s;e, and as many thou&s;and infantry, in Bretagne, for his &s;ervice.</P>

<P>The place being reduced, Charles, by the advice of his council, marched into Beauce again&s;t the remainder of the Engli&s;h troops, amounting to &s;ix thou&s;and men, encamped near Patay, under the conduct of Talbot, who had &s;ucceeded to the command after the di&s;a&s;ter of Suffolk. The French came upon them &s;o &s;uddenly, that they &s;carce had time to be formed. When they were charged, &s;uch was their pannic and confu&s;ion, that the greater part fled without making the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; and Sir John Fa&s;tolfe him&s;elf was hurried away in the mid&s;t of the fugitives. The lords Talbot, Scales, and Hungerford, maintained the battle with great valour, until they were overpowered by num|bers, and two thou&s;and of their men lay dead on the field of battle; then they were obliged to yield to the fortune of the day, and were taken pri&s;oners, to|gether with Sir Thomas Remp&s;ton, and other officers of di&s;tinction. Jenville, a &s;trong place in the neighbourhood of Patay, garri&s;oned with Engli&s;h troops, &s;urrendered to the victors without re&s;i&s;tance; and all the ca&s;tles, that held for Henry, about Orleans, were abandoned by the defendants, who retired to|wards Paris. The mi&s;carriage before Orleans, and their defeat, were &s;o fatal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon$trelet:</NOTE> to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, that the duke of Bedford was obliged to confine him|&s;elf within the walls of the capital; while the affairs of Charles a&s;&s;umed a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing a&s;pect. His brother-in-law Lewis III. duke of Anjou, and king of Sicily, joined him with a reinforcement of &s;oldiers, and &s;ome excellent of|ficers, whom he had lately brought back from Italy; &s;o that, when he re|viewed his army at Gien, it amounted to fifteen thou&s;and fighting men, five of which he &s;ent off in two detachments; one under the con&s;table, to make a diver&s;ion in Normandy; and the other to carry the war into the heart of Guienne, under the conduct of the count de Perdriac. The king him&s;elf, at the head of the remaining ten thou&s;and, began his march for Rheims; and in his route, received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Troye and Chalons, while the inhabitants of Auxerre promi&s;ed to follow the example of the principal towns of Cham|pagne. Tho&s;e of Rheims expelled the Engli&s;h garri&s;on, and &s;ent deputies with their keys to the king, who entered the city in triumph, and was con&s;ecrated with great &s;olemnity. When the ceremony was performed, the Maid of Or|leans de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to retire, alledging that &s;he had now accompli&s;hed the end of her calling; but the king pre&s;&s;ed her &s;o earne&s;tly to &s;tay, that &s;he at length complied with his reque&s;t. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mez$ra$$</NOTE></P>

<P>Du$ing this &s;urpri&s;ing revolution in the affairs of Charles, the court of Henry in England was again embroiled by a revival of the quarrel between the duke of Glouce&s;ter and the cardinal of England. This prel$te
<PB N="314" REF="3240">
was now become more in&s;olent than ever, &s;ince his elevation; and the duke, in order to mortify his pride, would not allow him to officiate at the fe&s;tival of St. George, patron of the order of the garter, tho' prelate of the order, in quality o$ bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. The duke affirmed, that he could not per|form the functions of cardinal and bi&s;hop, without the expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion of his maje&s;ty; and this being the opinion of the council, two noblemen were &s;ent to give him notice, that he &s;hould de&s;i&s;t from acting as bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. Next day, he appeared at council, and de&s;ired to know for what rea&s;on he was deprived of his right: but, the council gave him to under&s;tand, that his acting in &s;uch a double capacity would prejudice the prerogative of the crown; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$t. $word$.</NOTE> they per$$$ted in their re&s;olution. This was a &s;en&s;ible mortification to the car|dinal, as it afforded matter of triumph to his adver&s;ary; but he was &s;oon con|&s;oled for the di&s;grace, by a bull from the pope, appointing him legate for Germany, and general of a cru&s;ade again&s;t the Bohemian heretics, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Hu&s;&s;ites. He no &s;ooner received this com|mi&s;&s;ion, than he &s;ollicited the council for leave to rai&s;e five hundred lances, and as many thou&s;and archers for that &s;ervice; and his reque&s;t being granted under certain re&s;trictions, he began his levies with equal diligence and &s;ucce&s;s. In the mean time the news of the battle of Patay arriving in England, the council immediately ordered new levies to be rai&s;ed, under the command of Radcliffe; but, as the&s;e could not be a&s;&s;embled &s;o &s;oon as &s;uccours were required in France, they made a new convention with the cardinal, who engaged to &s;erve with his troops in France, under the duke of Bedford, 'till the end of Decem|ber, on condition that they &s;hould not be employed in any &s;iege. In a few days after this contract, Garter king at arms arrived with letters from the re|gent, pre&s;&s;ing the council to &s;end over a reinforcement with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, and de&s;iring that the king might go over and be con&s;ecrated at Paris. Henry was now about eight years of age, and his council agreed to the expediency of his going thither; but at the &s;ame time re&s;olved th$t he &s;hould be fir&s;t crowned king of England. This ceremony was accordingly performed on the &s;ixth day of November; and then the parliament, which was a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion, decreed that the dignity of protector &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the duke of Glouce&s;ter be thenceforward di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of King's fir&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">$y$er.</NOTE> coun&s;ellor.</P>

<P>While the Engli&s;h council was thus employed, the duke of Bedford repaired to Picardy, in order to make draughts from garri&s;ons, and wait for the &s;uccours from England; while Soi&s;&s;ons, Provins, Chateau-Thierry, Crepi, and &s;ome other places, &s;ubmitted to Charles. The regent having received the reinforcement levied by the cardinal, marched towards Crepi, in order to give the French king battle; and, in a few days, the two armies came in &s;ight of each other in a large plain, where Bedford, who had few hor&s;e, cho&s;e an advantageous &s;ituation, in hope of being attacked by the French impetuo&s;ity, to which he had owed his $ucce&s;s at Vernueil. But, for once he was di&s;ap|pointed. Charles, grown wi&s;e by experience, forbore to attack him within his lines; but, after having tried in vain to provoke the Engli&s;h to forego the ad|vantage of the &s;ituation, he decamped, in order to continue his conque&s;ts; and the regent, who followed him in hope of finding an opportunity to fight with a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, had the mortification to &s;ee him admitted into Senlis,
<PB N="315" REF="3250">
Beauvais, and &s;even or eight other places of importance from which the Eng|li&s;h garrri&s;ons had been withdrawn. What augmented his chagrin was, the &s;ucce&s;s of the con&s;table de Richemont, who had been detached into Normandy, where having increa&s;ed his forces to the number of eight thou&s;and men, he reduced Evreux, and threatened to de&s;olate the whole province. The duke dreading the lo&s;s of a country from whence he drew the greate&s;t part of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, marched thither with the utmo&s;t expedition, and drove the con&s;ta|ble out of that dutchy: but, in his ab&s;ence, Charles made an attempt upon the city of Paris. He encamped on Montmartre, and publi&s;hed an amne&s;ty in favour of the Pari&s;ians, who he hoped would have expelled the Engli&s;h forces, and &s;ubmitted: but, the regent had taken &s;uch wi&s;e precautions, that his declaration produced no effect. Then he ordered the &s;uburbs of St. Ho|nor&eacute; to be attacked; but the troops were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s, and the Maid of Orleans being wounded, was overtuned in the ditch, where &s;he lay &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead, until &s;he was brought off in the night, and found alive. After this un&s;ucce&s;sful a&s;&s;ault, Charles retired to Bourges, where he pa&s;&s;ed the winter; and the regent returned to Paris, from which, during the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, he &s;ent out detachments, which took St. Denys and Lagni by &s;calade. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;$relet.</NOTE></P>

<P>The turn of affairs in France filled England with murmurs and di&s;content. Some accu&s;ed the generals of having neglected their duty; and others affirmed, that this alteration was produced by the machination of the devil, who made u&s;e of Joan of Arc as the in&s;trument of his malice: but, there was a third &s;et, who imputed the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h to the mi&s;|conduct of the king's council; and in particular, to the ambition of the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who had undertaken a war in Hainault for his own private advantage, at a time when, if the whole &s;trength of England had been united, the entire conque&s;t of France might have been ea&s;ily completed. There were not wanting a fourth &s;pecies of politicians, who affirmed that the council had acted with imprudence in detaining &s;o long the dukes of Orleans and Bour|bon pri&s;oners in England. They ob&s;erved that the late king had derived great advantages from the divi&s;ions of the French princes; that therefore the pri&s;on|ers ought to have been &s;ent back to their own country, where, in all likelihood, they would have revived their antient quarrels; whereas, by their detention in England, France enjoyed a kind of tranquillity which enabled it to unite again&s;t the common enemy; that, if the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon had been in France, the duke of Burgundy would certainly have brought a greater number of troops into the field than he had hitherto $urni&s;hed; and that their ran&s;ome would &s;erve at lea&s;t to recruit the finances of England, which were almo&s;t exhau&s;ted. This la&s;t argument had &s;uch weight with the council, that nothing but the expre&s;s de&s;ire of the late king could have prevented them from practi&s;ing the expedient; at length they thought them&s;elves at liberty to di&s;|pen&s;e with that re&s;triction in favour of the duke of Bourbon, who by a pri|vate contract with Henry, had engaged to &s;wear to the peace of Troye, to pay a certain &s;um by way of ran&s;ome, and to deliver two of his &s;ons and for|tre&s;&s;es, as ho&s;tages for the performance of his promi&s;e. Tho' Henry V. died<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> before this treaty could be executed, it had been renewed with &s;ome alteration; and young Henry had, as king of France, received the duke's homage. The treaty was ratified; but, &s;ome intervening ob&s;tacles prevented the duke's re|lea&s;e;
<PB N="316" REF="3260">
and, after a captivity of eighteen years, he died at la&s;t a pri&s;oner in<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. $h. 1430.</NOTE> England. The council was the more di&s;po&s;ed to this accommodation, as it would have afforded a fund to defray the expence of the king's voyage to France; but this re&s;ource failing, they practi&s;ed another &s;hift that an&s;wered the purpo&s;e. All per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing forty pounds a year in land were &s;um|moned to receive the honour of knighthood; the jewels of the crown were pawned, and &s;ums of money borrowed from towns, corporations, and indivi|duals: the cardinal, by whom he was attended, advanced above nine thou&s;and pounds upon the occa&s;ion. By means of this &s;upply, the king was attended in his voyage by a con&s;iderable body of forces; but the Engli&s;h in general were &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with dreadful notions of Joan's enchantments, that many o$$icers and &s;oldiers de&s;erted before their embarkation; and a great number of tho&s;e who cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, being intimidated by the accounts they heard of her exploits, withdrew privately from their colours, and returned to England.</P>

<P>Henry arrived about the latter end of April at Calais, from whence he repaired to Rouen, where he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ummer, while the regent was employed in making preparations for the ceremony of his con&s;ecration at Paris, which was performed on the &s;eventeenth day of December. During the king's re&s;idence at Rouen, the duke of Bedford, &s;u&s;pecting that the duke of Burgundy began to li&s;ten to the &s;ollicitations of tho&s;e agents who were in|ce$&s;antly employed by Charles to detach him from the intere&s;t of England, thought p$oper to engage him more &s;trongly in the alliance, at the expence of all the places the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Champagne and Brie, which he ceded to that prince, in order to &s;trengthen the connexion. What likewi&s;e contri|buted to retain him the longer in his Engli&s;h engagements, was his third mar|riage with I&s;abel of Portugal, who was nearly related to Henry. The&s;e mo|tives induced the duke to &s;upply the regent with a reinforcement, which en|abled him to take the field, and reduce &s;ome places in the I&s;le of France, by which the Pari&s;ians had been very much incommoded.</P>

<P>Burgundy in per&s;on entered France at the head of a powerful army, with which he reduced Tor&s;y and Soi&s;&s;ons, and then undertook the fiege of Comp$egne, defended by Flavy, with a numerous garri&s;on, well provided with &s;tores and ammunition. At the fir&s;t report of this enterprize, the Maid of Orleans and Xaintrailles, threw them&s;elves into the place, to the no &s;mall mortification of the governor, who could not bear the thought of lo&s;ing any part of the glory that might be acquired in the defence. On the twenty-fifth day of May Joan made a &s;ally, and fought with her u&s;ual intrepidity; but being obliged to retire, placed her&s;elf in the rear, to amu&s;e the enemy until her troops &s;hould make good their retreat. Having performed this &s;ervice e$$$ctually, &s;he attempted to follow them into the city, and found the gates &s;hut and the bridge drawn up, by order of the governor, who is &s;aid to have $hut her out knowingly, that &s;he might fall into the hands of the be&s;iegers. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, &s;he &s;urrendered to the Ba&s;tard of Vendome, who de$ivered her immediately to the count de Ligny, the Burgundian gene|ral. The regent was no &s;ooner informed of her being taken, than he pur|cha&s;ed her of the count for a very valuable con&s;ideration. When the place was reduced to extremity, it was &s;uccoured by the count de Vendome, with a co$&s;iderable reinforcement of troops, provi&s;ion, and ammunition; &s;o that the

It appears from the regent's letter to the king, after the &s;iege of Orleans was rai&s;ed, that he believed the Maid to be an inchantre&s;s in&s;pired by the devil; and an incident that happened at this juncture plainly proves that the French generals imagined the cau&s;e of Charles was e&s;pou&s;ed by a particular providence.

Having therefore a&s;&s;embled a body of cho&s;en troops, they followed the &s;hepherd, who conducted them into an ambu&s;cade formed by Talbot, who de&s;troyed the greater part of their forces, and took Xaintrailles pri&s;oner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon&s;trelet.</NOTE></P>

for want of money, that he could not maintain an army in the field. Henry was nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation; for his French &s;ubjects were exhau&s;ted, as well as generally di&s;affected to his government; and the people of England were by this time heartily tired of a ruinous war, which afforded no pro&s;pect of a termination. This being the ca&s;e on both &s;ides, the war was maintained in petty incur&s;ions, and little &s;tratagems for the &s;urpri&s;al of towns and fortre&s;&s;es. The French made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Chartres by means of a waggon loaded with wine, which was overturned under the portcullis. The Engli&s;h on the other hand &s;urprized Montargis, by carrying on a corre&s;pondence with a dam&s;el of the town, who prevailed upon her lover, a barber, to give them admittance. Charles was concerned in another di&s;pute, be&s;ides that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and Henry. Ren&eacute;, &s;econd &s;on of Lewis II. king of Sicily, and duke of Anjou, having &s;ucceeded to the dutchy of Bar, by the death of his uncle the cardinal de Bar, and marquis of Pont-a-Mou&s;&s;on, wanted to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf al&s;o in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lorraine, on the demi&s;e of the duke his father-in-law. But the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was di&s;puted with him by Anthony, count de Vaudemont, &s;on of Frederic the younger brother of duke Charles. This conte&s;t produced a war, in which the French king &s;upported the party of Ren&eacute;, who was his brother-in-law, while that of his competitor was e&s;pou&s;ed by the duke of Burgundy. On the &s;econd day of July, the two princes meet|ing at Bulegneville, a bloody battle en&s;ued, in which Ren&eacute; was vanqui&s;hed, taken, and conducted to Dijon; and twelve hundred French troops being<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ de Lor|r$$ne.</NOTE> killed in this engagement, Charles was di&s;abled from attempting any thing of con&s;equence again&s;t the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>While Henry re&s;ided in France, pope Eugenius II. &s;ent thither the cardinal of Santa Cruz to per&s;uade the two kings to an accommodation; and that legate prevailed upon them to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Auxerre, where, how|ever, the conferences were not opened, becau&s;e the Engli&s;h would not own the plenipotentiaries of Charles for the amba&s;&s;adors of France. Notwith|&s;tanding this mi&s;carriage, the cardinal continued his good offices, and another day was appointed for their meeting again in the &s;ucceeding year; but they could not agree upon the place, and the negotiation mi&s;carried. Henry quit|ting Paris immediately after Chri&s;tmas, retired to Rouen as a place of greater &s;afety; though it was very near being &s;urprized by the treachery of one Peter Audebeauf, a native of Bearne, retained in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, who introduced an hundred and twenty men, commanded by one Recarville, into the great tower of the ca&s;tle. To &s;upport the&s;e, a larger body of troops had advanced within a league of the place; but the officers quarrelling among them&s;elves about the manner of &s;haring the booty which they hoped to obtain, confu&s;ion en&s;ued, and the whole number returned to Beauvais. Tho&s;e who had been admitted into the tower were obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion; and Henry's governors, alarmed at this attempt, conveyed him immediately to his Engli&s;h dominions, where the animo&s;ity between the duke of Glouce&s;ter and the car|dinal &s;till glowed with unabating rancour.</P>

of the great &s;ervices the cardinal had done the &s;tate, he would grant an amne&s;ty in his favour, for every thing he might have tran&s;acted contrary to the laws, particularly to the &s;tatutes of premunire. Notwith&s;tanding this addre&s;s, with which his maje&s;ty complied, the duke of Glouce&s;ter would not relinqui&s;h the pur&s;uit. He pretended that he had proofs in his hands &s;ufficient to convict the cardinal of high trea&s;on; a crime which could not be implied in the pardon he had received. Winche&s;ter, who was at that time in Flanders tran&s;acting the king's affairs, returned to London, without having demanded permi&s;&s;ion, and the duke made this a pretext for &s;eizing his baggage. Next day the cardinal went to the hou&s;e of lords, where he declared he was come to ju&s;tify his conduct, and prove his innocence again&s;t any per&s;on who &s;hould charge him with delinquency. As Glouce&s;ter did not think proper to main|tain what he had advanced, he was acknowledged as a faithful &s;ubject, by an authentic act pa&s;&s;ed at his earne&s;t de&s;ire. Then he complained that his bag|gage had been &s;eized at Sandwich, and demanded re&s;titution. He offered to depo&s;it &s;ix thou&s;and pounds in the king's hands for &s;ix years; and if in that time the baggage &s;hould appear to have been lawfully &s;eized, the money &s;hould be confi&s;cated for the u&s;e of his maje&s;ty.

<P>England was more attentive to the conte&s;t between the&s;e two am|bitious rivals, than to the war of France, which they &s;eemed almo&s;t to have forgot; though the pre&s;ent juncture afforded them a fair opportunity to repair the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained, and retrieve the credit of their arms. Charles gave him&s;elf up to the delights of indolence, in the embraces of Agnes Sorel, and left the care of his mo&s;t important affairs to his mini&s;ters and generals. His favourite La Tremouille was accu&s;ed of encouraging him in this habit of idlene&s;s and indifference; but this was not the ca&s;e. Charles began to be di&s;|gu&s;ted with this mini&s;ter, and grow unea&s;y under the yoke he had impo&s;ed. The con&s;table being informed, by his emi&s;&s;aries at court, of this alienation, re|&s;olved to re$act the tragedy of Louvet, De Giac, and Beaulieu, and having &s;ecured the intere&s;t of the courtiers who hated the mini&s;ter, he cau&s;ed him to be apprehended in his bed, at Chinon, within the king's palace, and conveyed to pri&s;on at Montre&s;or. Charles was equally &s;urprized and incen&s;ed at this outrage, which he &s;wore he would revenge upon the con&s;table: but, when he heard all the princes of the blood, and all the nobles of his court, declare again&s;t La Tremouille, he che$ked his indignation. He remembered with fear the league which had been formed again&s;t him in the ca&s;e of Louvet$ and the di&s;gu&s;t he had begun to conceive for the mini&s;ter, enabled him to give him up with the le&s;s reluctance.

with r$info$cement$ from England. But for &s;ome time the&s;e had been intirely interrupted; &s;o that he could not keep the field without unfurni&s;hing the places of their garri&s;ons, and leaving them at liberty to declare for Charles. In the beginning of the year, Bedford detached the earl of Arundel and the mar$chal de $'I&s;le Adam, to be&s;iege Lagin, in the neighbourhood of Paris, whi$h had been lately &s;urpri&s;ed by Foucaut; but the garri&s;on made &s;uch a vigorous $ally, that they were obliged to abandon the enterprize. In the month of Augu&s;t, the regent undertook the &s;iege of it in per&s;on, with an army of &s;ix thou&s;and men; but, in $pite of his vigilance and precaution, the Ba$$ard of Orleans introduced a convoy into the place; and the duke fearing he carried on &s;ome intelligence with the Pari&s;ians, &s;uddenly rai&s;ed the &s;ieg$ and returned to the capital. A &s;mall body of French forces, drawn from different garri&s;ons, &s;ur|pri&s;ed the town of Montargis; but the ca&s;tle defended it&s;elf &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they were obliged to abandon their conque&s;t.

<P>The&s;e were events of little con&s;equence, in compari&s;on with that which happened on the thirteenth day of November. This was the death of Anne of Burgundy dutche&s;s of Bedford, which not only affected her hu&s;|band in particular, but al&s;o the whole Engli&s;h nation, as it entirely broke that bond of connexion which had united the dukes of Bedford and Burgundy; and the mutual re&s;entment which &s;ucceeded their union was fatal to the intere&s;t of England. In the beginning of the year, there was a dangerous in&s;urrection of the pea&s;ants in Normandy, who, taking arms to the number of &s;ixty thou&s;and, two thirds of the&s;e proceeded to the Vexin; and the other body of twenty thou|&s;and marched to C$en, which they took, together with Harfleur, Dieppe, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1433.</NOTE> Lillebonne. The earl of Arundel was no &s;ooner apprized of the in&s;urrection, than he marched again&s;t tho&s;e who were a&s;&s;embled at the Vexin, and charging them in the night, obtained an ea&s;y victory. Tho&s;e in Caen might have been more trouble&s;ome, as they were headed by the marechal de Rieux; but they were &s;o intimidated by the defeat of their companions, that the greate&s;t part of them di&s;per&s;ed to their own habitations. The marechal, with &s;ome of the mo&s;t courageous, threw him&s;elf into Dieppe, which, together with Harfleur, re|mained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French king, though Arundel reduced Caen and Lillebonne. In the cour&s;e of this year, the duke of Bedford married Jaqueline of Lux$$bourg, daughter of James count of St. Pol; a match that gave great umbrage to the duke of Burgundy, who not only looked upon it as an in|&s;ult to the memory of his &s;i&s;ter &s;o lately decea&s;ed, but al&s;o re&s;ented the regent's marrying the daughter of his va&s;&s;al, without his con&s;ent or knowledge. The cardinal of England endeavoured to repair this breach, and mediate a reconci|liation. He &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to obtain their mutual con&s;ent to an interview at St. Omer, where all differences might be amicably adju&s;ted; but when they rep$$red to this place, a fre&s;h di&s;pute en&s;ued about rank and precedence. Neither would yield in point of punctilio; and they parted, more than ever incen&s;ed again&s;t each other. In all probability the duke of Burgundy had already de|termined to abandon the Engli&s;h intere&s;t, and u&s;ed this trivial di&s;pute as a pre|tence for breaking with the regent: though he re&s;olved to have it in his power to make his own terms with Charles, and for that purpo&s;e per&s;i&s;ted in
<PB N="321" REF="3310">
his ho&s;tilities. He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of St. Valery, Ham, Laon, and Pro|vins; and the earl of Arundel be&s;ieged and took Silley-le-Guillaume, in the province of Le Maine.</P>

<P>By this time the council of England were become more de&s;irous of peace, than of engaging in any new mea&s;ures for retrieving what the king had lo&s;t in France. The duke of Orleans, who &s;till continued a pri&s;oner at London, had offered to employ all his influence in forwarding a treaty, on which all his hope of liberty depended. He propo&s;ed that the queen dowager of Sicily, her &s;on Charles of Anjou, the duke of Brittany, with his brothers the counts of Richemont and of St. Gilles, the duke of Alen$on, the counts of Armagnac, Foix, Perdriac, Clermont, and the archbi&s;hop of Paris, &s;hould meet the plenipotentiaries of England at Calais, or any other place pitched upon by the Engli&s;h council; and he de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the congre&s;s, in order to enforce the negotiation. At the &s;ame time he pre&s;ented a &s;et of articles, which were &s;o favourable for England, that the council embraced his propo&s;al without he&s;itation; and he &s;igned, &s;ealed, and &s;wore to the perfor|mance of the treaty which he had planned. Pa&s;sports were expedited for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> queen dowager of Sicily, and the other per&s;ons named in his propo&s;al$ the month of October was fixed for the time of the conferences; and the council appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the plenipotentiaries of Charles. The duke of Orleans acted on this occa&s;ion in concert with the court of France, who&s;e aim was to dupe the council of England. The articles of a &s;eparate peace between Charles and the duke of Burgundy were already adju&s;ted, by the means of the con&s;table of Richemont, who had conferred with the duke at Nevers, on pretence of accommodating a difference between that prince and the count de Clermont; and nothing was wanting but an opportunity to fini&s;h and confirm the treaty. For this purpo&s;e they projected the plan of a congre&s;s for a general peace, well knowing that the Engli&s;h would reject the conditions that would be propo&s;ed; and their refu&s;al would furni&s;h the duke with a pre|text for concluding a &s;eparate accommodation. This was the true motive of the magnificent offers made by the duke of Orleans to the king of England, in ca&s;e the conferences &s;hould prove ineffectual. They knew nothing was &s;o<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1434$</NOTE> likely to engage Henry's council in the negotiation, as the hope of its producing &s;omething advantageous to England, even though it &s;hould not &s;ucceed; and the duke of Bedford, as well as the council, being utterly ignorant of what had pa&s;&s;ed between the duke of Burgundy and Charles, were the more ea&s;ily caught in the &s;nare. As &s;oon as they had con&s;ented to the congre&s;s, the duke of Bur|gundy, who &s;till maintained the appearance of union with the Engli&s;h, ma|naged matters in &s;uch a manner, that in&s;tead of Calais they fixed upon Arras for the place of congre&s;s, to which all the parties concerned agreed to &s;end their amba&s;&s;adors.</P>

<P>Mean while the war degenerated into petty excur&s;ions; both kings were to weak to &s;end armies into the field; and therefore nothing of moment was tran&s;acted. The French having &s;urprized Rue in Picardy, the earl of Arundel re&s;olved to retake the place; but under&s;tanding on his march that the enemy had fortified Herberoi near Beauvais, he judged it expedient to drive them thence before the works could be brought to perfection, and &s;at down before the town. Receiving intelligence that Vignol$s and Xaintrailles
<PB N="322" REF="3320">
advanced with twelve hundred men to its relief, he rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and gave them battle. In this action, which was extremely ob&s;tinate, he was mortally wounded and taken pri&s;oner, and in a few days died, to the un&s;peakable regret of the duke of Bed$ord. The count de Clermont, now become duke of Bour|bon by the death of his father, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Corbeil and Brie-Comt&eacute;|Robert, by bribing the governors; and a Scotti&s;h officer &s;urprized Vincennes, which, however, he could not maintain. At length Talbot, arriving from England with a reinforcement of three of four thou&s;and men, to whom he joined &s;ome troops drawn from garri&s;ons, became ma&s;ter of the field, and re|took a good number of towns, without being interrupted in his progre&s;s by the enemy.</P>

Charles &s;ent thither &s;eventeen plenipotentiaries, at the head of whom was the con&s;table de Richemont; and Henry appointed twenty-&s;even for France and England, the duke of Burgundy being the principal. Hitherto the regent and the Engli&s;h council were per&s;uaded that the duke acted upon good faith: but they &s;oon received intelligence that he had &s;ollicited the pope to ab&s;olve him from the oath which he had taken to the late king Henry. Eugenius being que&s;tioned on this &s;ubject, declared that no French prince had ever made any &s;uch demand; and that for the future he would ob&s;erve &s;uch conduct as would be &s;atisfactory to the king of England. The conferences began on the &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, with the propo&s;als of Charles, who&s;e amba&s;&s;adors offered to Henry all Normandy and Guienne, on condition that he would renounce his preten&s;ions to the crown of France, and do homage for tho&s;e two provinces. The Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries, equally &s;urprized and incen&s;ed at a propo&s;al &s;o widely different from the articles agreed upon with the duke of Orleans, broke off the conference abruptly, and retired without deigning to make the lea&s;t reply.</P>

<P>The duke of Burgundy made their &s;udden departure a pretext for con|cluding a &s;eparate peace. He ob&s;erved that he was not obliged to follow their caprice, and gratify their pride at the expence of his own intere&s;t. The pope's legate ab&s;olved him of all the oaths he had taken to Henry V. and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and his treaty with Charles was &s;oon ratified, as all the articles had been adju&s;ted before hand. Charles obliged him&s;elf by this treaty to a&s;k par|don of Philip, either in per&s;on or by his delegates, for the murder of his father, as a crime which had been perpetrated in his youth, at the in&s;tigation of evil coun&s;ellors; to deliver up all the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to ju&s;tice; to found chapels and ma&s;&s;es for the &s;ouls of John duke of Burgundy, and his attendants who were killed by his &s;ide; to make good all damages &s;u&s;tained by &s;uch as were taken on the day of the murder; to erect a cro&s;s on the place where it was committed, and pay fifty thou&s;and crowns in gold, in lieu of the duke's jewels, which were &s;eized, at his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. He agreed to cede to Philip and his heirs the cities and counties of Boulogne-&s;ur-Mer, Macon, St. Jangout, and Auxerre, with all their dependencies, together with all the taxes called aids, impo&s;ed on tho&s;e parts of Macon, Chalons, Autun, and Langres, that lay with|in Burgundy; the ca&s;tles, towns, and di&s;tricts of Bar-&s;ur-Seine, Peronne,

Roye, and Mondidier, and all their appendages; the whole county of Ponthie$, Dourlens, St. Ri&s;quier, Crevecour, Arleux, Mortagne, St. Quintin, Corbie, Amiens, and Abbeville, were mortgag$d to Philip and his heirs, until four hundred thou&s;and crowns &s;hould be payed for their redemption. Philip him&s;elf was exempted from doing homage for the&s;e territories during the life of Charles, as were his va&s;&s;als from obeying the &s;ummons of Charles, without his order. The French king promi&s;ed to &s;uccour him in ca&s;e he &s;hould be attacked by the Engli&s;h; and both parties declared they would make no agreement with the enemy, without the con&s;ent of each other. The duke's va&s;&s;als, and others, who had borne St. Andrew's cro&s;s, which was the en&s;ign of Burgundy, were exempted from &s;erving under any other; and a general pardon was granted to all per&s;ons except the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins a$orementioned. Both parties renounced all al|liances to the prejudice of one another; and by letters patent declared their re&s;|pective &s;ubjects ab&s;olved from their allegiance to him who &s;hould violate this treaty. The princes of the blood in France, and the nobles of Burgundy, ratified this agreement under their hands and &s;eals: and it was afterwards confirmed by the council of Ba&s;il, which denounced the cen$ures of excommunication and interdict again&s;t him who &s;hould in$ringe the articles. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon$trelet.</NOTE></P>

<P>During the conference at Arras, the inhabitants of Houdan, St. Denys, Pontoi&s;e, Melun, Pont St. Maixance, Meulan, opened the$r gates to the forces of Charles: the duke of Bedford retook St. Denys, and ordered the walls of it to be razed to the ground; but he was obliged to rai&s;e the $iege of Meulan by the Ba&s;tard of Orleans, and E&s;pernay fell into the hands of the French. I&s;abel, queen dowager of France, &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;s of her $on Charles, whom &s;he always hated, and the de&s;perate condition of the Eng|li&s;h intere&s;t, died at Paris of vexation, very little regretted by the French, who looked upon her as the principal cau&s;e of the ruin of the kingdom. Her death was of very little con&s;equence to either party; but this was not the ca&s;e with that of the regent, who died in the ca&s;tle of Rouen on the fourteenth day of September, univer&s;ally lamented by the Engli&s;h, not only as the &s;ole &s;upport of their intere&s;t in France, but al&s;o as a prince of the mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;ition. He certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the heroi&s;m of his brother Henry, without his defects; and, by his admirable conduct, maintained the war in France almo&s;t without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from England.

The death of this worthy prince was no &s;ooner known in England, than Richard Plantagenet duke of York was appointed regent of France: but Henry duke of Somer&s;et, who had been his competitor for that dignity, managed his intrigues in the council with &s;uch art, that his patent was not expedited for &s;even months, during which the parti&s;ans of Charles extended their conque&s;ts without oppo&s;ition.</P>

as a fr$$h in$$$t. The council would not even vouch&s;afe to an&s;wer the letter$ and the heralds were not &s;uffered to &s;tir abroad.

In all likelihood the&s;e in&s;ults and com|motions were far from being di&s;agreeable to the duke of Burgu$dy, as they furni&s;hed him with a pretext for exclaiming again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and joining<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 143$.</NOTE> his forces to tho&s;e of Charles. In the month of March, he &s;ent a reinforce|ment of five hundred lances to the con&s;table Richemont, who, having made &s;h$$t to a&s;&s;emble &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men, marched directly to Paris, where the emi&s;&s;aries of Charles and the duke of Burgundy had already formed a very con&s;iderable party. He &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;everal &s;mall places in t$e n$$ghbo$$hood of that capital; and then encamped before one of the gat$s, where continual conferences were carried on between his troops and the citizens, n$twith&s;tanding all the precaution that could be taken by Robert lord Wi$$oughby, who commanded the Engli&s;h garri&s;on, amounting to fifteen hun|dred men. On the thirteenth day of April, the inhabitants &s;uddenly took to their arms, while the marechal L'I$$e d'Adam &s;caled the walls; and when the garri&s;on advanced again&s;t the a&s;&s;ailants, they were &s;aluted with &s;howers of &s;tones $rom the windows, while the whole city re&s;ounded with repeated acclamations of "Long live the king and the duke of Burgundy."

<P>The duke of York, having at length received his commi&s;&s;ion of regent, landed in Normandy with a good body of troops from England, and retook many &s;mall places or ca&s;tles, which the French had reduced &s;ince the death of the duke of Bedford. While he was employed in the conque&s;t of Nor|mandy, he received intelligence that the duke of Burgundy had made great pre|parations for a &s;iege$ and &s;u&s;pecting that his de&s;ign was to inve&s;t Calais, he imparted his conjectures to the council, pre&s;&s;ing them to put that place in a proper po&s;ture of defence. Before they could take any mea&s;ures for this pur|po&s;e, the duke inve&s;ted the town with an army of fifty thou&s;and men; and this circum&s;tance being known in England, increa&s;ed the animo&s;ity of the nation to a mo&s;t virulent degree again&s;t that prince, whom they reviled as the wor&s;t of all apo&s;tates. Orders were i&s;&s;ued to levy fifteen thou&s;and troops for the relief of the place; and the command of the&s;e was given to the duke of Glouce&s;ter, while at the &s;ame time this nobleman and the lord Beaumont were gratified by Henry with grants of all the territories belonging to the hou&s;e of Bur|gundy in France and Flanders. The&s;e forces being levied, the duke of Glou|ce&s;ter &s;et &s;ail, and landed with them in Normandy about &s;ix weeks after the duke of Burgundy had begun the &s;iege. He had not as yet made much pro|gre&s;s in his operations; but on the contrary &s;u&s;tained &s;ome checks, which not a little di&s;heartened his Flemi&s;h forces. Several vigorous and &s;ucce&s;sful fallies had been made by the garri&s;on. Part of the duke's fleet which blocked up

the place by &s;ea, having been left a-ground at low-water, the inhabitants of Calais found means to &s;et the &s;hips on fire and de&s;troy them entirely; a wooden fort erected by the be&s;iegers, and well &s;upplied with cannon, was taken by the Engli&s;h, and all the Flemings $ound in it were put to the &s;word; and la&s;tly, the duke of Glouce&s;ter, before he embarked, &s;ent an herald to challenge Bur|gundy to battle. All the&s;e circum&s;tances concurred to intimidate the troops of Flanders, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of raw undi&s;ciplined militia; and when they under|&s;tood that the duke of Glouce&s;ter was on his march towards Calais, their whole camp was filled with mutiny and confu&s;ion. They &s;truck their tents of their own accord; and, in &s;pite of all the duke's remon&s;trances and authority, began to retreat in the utmo&s;t di&s;order. He was obliged to follow them to Gravelines, whither they fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation, leaving behind their baggage, artillery, and ammunition.</P>

<P>This was not the only mortification that Philip received. He had &s;carce returned to his dominions, when the towns of Flanders revolted.

The truce between England and Scotland had expired, and ho&s;tilities were recommenced between the two nations. The earl of Northumberland, with the other lords of the Engli&s;h Marches, invaded Scotland with a &s;trong body of forces, and were encountered by William Douglas earl of Angus, and &s;ome other Scotti&s;h noblemen, at a place called Poperden, where, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, the Engli&s;h were defeated with the lo&s;s of fifteen hundred men killed upon the &s;pot, be&s;ides four hundred that were taken pri&s;oners. Henry's council had employed all their influence to prevent the match between Margaret and the dauphin, in the way of negotiation; but finding James determined in favour of his French alliance, they fitted out a fleet to intercept the prince&s;s in her pa&s;&s;age to France; though the Scotti&s;h king eluded their vigilance by &s;ending her with a convoy of forty &s;hips around the we&s;tern i&s;les, and &s;he landed in &s;a$ety at Rochelle. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE></P>

<P>The en&s;uing year was remarkable for the death of Jane of Navarre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1437.</NOTE> and Catherine of France, both queen dowagers of England. The former, who was widow of Henry IV. had been &s;u&s;pected of intrigues again&s;t the royal family, but lived to get the better of that calumny; and the other, who was relict of Henry V. had, after his death, given her hand to Owen Tudor, a private gentleman of Wales, remarkable for his per&s;onal accompli&s;hments. This match, &s;o unequal to her rank, and the dignity of her fir&s;t marriage, gave great di&s;gu&s;t to the Engli&s;h nation, and in particular to the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who thinking the honour of his family degraded by &s;uch an al|liance, committed Owen to Newgate, from whence he e&s;caped, and was after|wards &s;lain fighting for the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. By Catherine he had three

Jaquelina of Luxembourg, widow of John duke of Bedford, followed the example of queen Catherine; and, after her hu&s;band's death, married Sir Richard Woodville, a young &s;oldier of fortune, although &s;he had &s;worn before king Henry's chancellor of France, and the lord Talbot, that &s;he would never marry without the king's permi&s;&s;ion; an oath &s;he was obliged to take before &s;he could be confirmed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>In a parliament held at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the duke of Glouce&s;ter, as governor of Calais, repre&s;ented the precarious &s;ituation of that fortre&s;s, on account of the mutinous di&s;po&s;ition of the garri&s;on, which had not for a long time been regularly payed; and he entered a formal prote&s;t, importing that in ca&s;e the town &s;hould be lo&s;t by this neglect in the payment of the &s;oldiers, the misfortune &s;hould not be imputed to his mi&s;conduct. A declaration which induced the parliament to pa&s;s an act, empowering the trea&s;urer of England to make good the deficiencies of the cu&s;toms allotted for this &s;ervice.

<P>Since the arrival of the duke of York in France, the affairs of the Engli&s;h a&s;&s;umed a more favourable a&s;pect in that country. Charles had no confiderable army in the field; nor could he expect much a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the duke of Burgundy, who had occa&s;ion for all his forces to quell the revolt of his own &s;ubjects. The beginning of the year was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively cold, that the generals of both &s;ides co$ld not undertake any regular operation in the field. Neverthele&s;s, the indefatigable Talbot found means to turn this un|common rigour of the &s;ea&s;on to the advantage of his country. He a&s;&s;embled a body of forces$ and dre&s;&s;ing &s;ome of them in white apparel, they crept into the dir$h of Po$$oi&s;e, without being perceived by the garri&s;on, who could not di&s;tingui&s;h them from the &s;now with which the ground was covered. Mean while the re&s;t of the detachment approached the place in the dark, in order to &s;u&s;tain their companions, who applying their &s;caling-ladders, at the time when the g$rri&s;on relieved the watch at day-break, made their way into the town, and opened the gates for Talbot, who entered the place on one &s;ide, while the French fled at the other. The &s;urprize of this important town was a &s;evere blow to Charles; and greatly incommoded the Pari&s;ians, who &s;aw the Engli&s;h garri&s;on make daily incur&s;ions to the &s;uburbs of their capital. The duke of Burgundy, alarmed at the &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h, which if not &s;ea&s;onably checked might produce a revolution that would prove fatal to his intere&s;t,
<PB N="327" REF="3370">
re&s;olved to rou&s;e Charles from that lethargy of &s;loth and indolence which he had hitherto indulged; and gave him to under&s;tand, that if he would con&s;ult his own glory and advantage, &s;o far as to a$&s;emble all his troops, and march at their head towards Paris, in order to drive the Engli&s;h from the heart of the kingdom, he, the duke, would contribute towards his &s;ucce&s;s by making a powerful diver&s;ion in Picardy. This remon&s;trance &s;eemed to wake him from his &s;lumber. He forthwith a&s;&s;embled his forces; and, in his route to Paris, attacked Montereau-faut-Yonne, while the duke of Burgundy under|took the &s;iege of Crotoy, a &s;trong place in Picardy. It was inve&s;ted by a numerous land-army, while the harbour was blocked up by four large French ve&s;&s;els. The duke of York being at that time recalled to England, through the intrigues of Somer&s;et, detached Talbot to the relief of the be&s;ieged, with a body of five thou&s;and men; and that intrepid chief undertook the ta&s;k, tho' the Burgundian army amounted to five times the number, and he was obliged to pa&s;s the river Somme in the face of the enemy. The duke being informed of his approach, left part of his troops to continue the &s;iege, and with the remainder took po&s;t on the &s;ide of the river, to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age of the Engli&s;h, who hated him to &s;uch a degree, that no danger could deter them from gratifying their revenge. Talbot profiting by this di&s;po&s;ition, was the fir&s;t man who ru&s;hed into the &s;tream, and they followed him with &s;uch alacrity as intimidated the Burgundians on the other &s;ide, who believing they were devils rather than men, betook them&s;elves to flight with the utmo&s;t precipitation; and their pannic infecting tho&s;e who continued in the lines be|fore the town, the whole army di&s;per$ed, in &s;pite of all the efforts of their commander. Talbot entered the town in triumph, de&s;troyed the works of the be&s;iegers, reduced five or &s;ix places in Picardy, retook Tancarville in Nor|mandy, and returned to Rouen covered with laurels.</P>

<P>Mean while Charles carried on the &s;iege of Montereau, which was bravely defended by Thomas Gerard, though he had not above four hundred men under his command. Hitherto Charles had not greatly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by his per&s;onal courage; but on this occa&s;ion he &s;ignalized his valour in a very remarkable manner. He not only expo&s;ed him&s;elf in the trenches, like the meane&s;t &s;oldier in hi$ army; but when, after a long &s;iege the place was carried by a&s;&s;ault, he was one of the $ir&s;t who entered the breach &s;word in hand, and fought &s;ingly with &s;urpri&s;ing prowe&s;s. The intrepidity of his behaviour in this a&s;&s;ault produced a very favourable effect in behalf of his character: and yet he &s;eemed to have exhau&s;ted all his vivacity in this effort; for Gerard retiring to the ca&s;tle, the king relap&s;ed into his former indolence, and left the care and conduct of this &s;econd &s;iege to his &s;on the dauphin. The Engli&s;h commander, after having &s;u&s;tained a &s;eries of a&s;&s;aults for fifteen days in this fortre&s;s, was at length obliged to capitulate. When he appeared in the pre&s;ence of Lewis, he told him, that again&s;t any other be&s;ieger he &s;hould have made a longer defence; a compliment, which though it agreeably flat|tered the vanity of that young prince, was extremely mortifying to his father, who, from that day, conceived a jealou&s;y again&s;t his &s;on, which was of pernicious con&s;equence. Charles, from Montereau marched to Paris, which he entered in triumph, amid&s;t the acclammations of the people; and certainly tho&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions of joy were perfectly &s;incere, as they now &s;aw their native king re|&s;tored

to his capital, after it had remained &s;o long in the power of a tri|umphant enemy; and found him di&s;po&s;ed to forget all the unkindne&s;s he had $uffered at their hands. He forthwith re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the parliament and the courts of judicature, and confirmed all the privileges of the city: but this happy calm was of &s;hort duration. The re&s;ort of multitudes who followed the court to Paris, not only produced a dearth, but likewi&s;e introduced a dreadful infection, which reged to &s;uch a degree, that the king and royal fa|mily were obliged in a few days to abandon the city, which in a little time be|came<NOTE PLACE="marg">P Daniel.

<P>This tedious war had exhau&s;ted England in &s;uch a manner, that the council was always ready to li&s;ten to all propo&s;als of accommodation; and, as the duke of Orleans &s;aw no other pro&s;pect of obtaining his liberty, he be|came very &s;incere in his endeavours to promote a pacification. For this pur|po&s;e, he demanded permi&s;&s;ion to go to Calais, and confer with the duke of Brittany, whom he looked upon as the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to act the part of mediator. The council would have readily complied with this reque&s;t, had they believed Charles was di&s;po&s;ed to an equitable peace; but, until they &s;hould be better informed of his inclinations, they did not think proper to make any advances, e&s;pecially as the duke of Glouce&s;ter violently oppo&s;ed the projected negotiation, on pretence that they could not expect an advantageous peace at &s;uch a conjuncture; though his real aim was to thwart the cardinal, who had countenanced the propo&s;al of the duke of Orleans. Not but that this prelate began to gain ground upon his antagoni&s;t, in proportion as the king advanced in years. His wealth enabled him to accommodate Henry with &s;upplies of money, at a time when a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that kind was counted the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice that could be done to the &s;tate; and the young prince, who was naturally &s;uper&s;titious, had been trained up in the mo&s;t abject veneration of the clergy. The cardinal did not fail to make u&s;e of the&s;e ad|vantages, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the king's mind &s;o much in his favour, that he granted him a general pardon for all crimes he might have committed, of what nature &s;oever they might be, from the creation of the world down to the twenty-eighth of June in the current year; &s;o that his adver&s;ary was to|tally<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme$.</NOTE> di&s;abled $rom pro&s;ecuting his revenge.</P>

<P>About this period, James king of Scotland, a prince of truly royal virtues, fell a &s;acrifice to the ambition of his own uncle Walter earl of Athol, who, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a bold outlaw called Graeme, broke into the con|vent of Dominicans at Perth, where the king was lodged, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated him in the night. A young lady of the name of Douglas, who attended the queen, being alarmed with the noi&s;e, ran to &s;ecure the door of the apartment, and perceiving that the bolt was purpo&s;ely removed, by &s;ome of the dome&s;tics who were concerned in the con&s;piracy, &s;he &s;upplied the want of it with her own arm, which was cru&s;hed by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. James, though naked, &s;eized his &s;word, and bravely defended him&s;elf again&s;t a great number of foes, &s;ome of whom he killed upon the &s;pot, till at length he was overpowered, and fell pierced with eight and twenty wounds, &s;everal of which were mortal. Nor &s;hould the &s;pirit and affection of his Engli&s;h queen pa&s;s unheeded: &s;he interpo&s;ed between her hu&s;band and the &s;words of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and received
<PB N="329" REF="3390">
&s;ome dangerous wounds in his defence. The tragical fate of James was at|tended<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> with an advantage to the king of England, who was not only freed from a dangerous neighbour, attached to his enemy of France, but &s;aw him &s;ucceeded by an infant, during who&s;e minority the governor of Scotland was influenced by the queen-mother, Henry's kin&s;woman, and &s;he &s;oon ef|fected a truce for nine years between the two nations. England, as well as France, being afflicted with the pe&s;tilence, the war langui&s;hed for want of re|inforcements; and nothing was undertaken on either &s;ide of greater importance than &s;ome petty &s;iege, or pillaging excur&s;ion. The duke of Burgundy$ in|deed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

No other event worth mentioning occurred in the cour&s;e of this year, except the exchange of the count d'Eu, who had been taken in the battle of Agincourt, for John Beaufort, brother to Henry duke of Somer&s;et, whom he &s;ucceeded in that title, though he too died without male i&s;&s;ue, and the dukedom devolved upon his fourth brother Edmund, of whom we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay many things in the &s;equel.</P>

<P>In the month of March, the con&s;table Richemont a&s;&s;embling a con&s;iderable body of troops, inve&s;ted the city of Meaux, one of the &s;tronge&s;t places in France, which had formerly held out &s;even months again&s;t Henry V. It was now defended by the Ba&s;tard of Han, an officer of di&s;tingui&s;hed valour; but, notwith&s;tanding all his vigilance and conduct, the town was, after a &s;iege of three weeks, taken by a&s;&s;ault, and the governor made pri&s;oner in the action. The garri&s;on retired into the part called the Market, which is on the other &s;ide of the Maine, and broke down the bridge of communication; &s;o that the con&s;table was obliged to begin a new &s;iege more di$ficult than the former. In the mean time, he ordered the governor to be beheaded, becau&s;e, though a native of France, he &s;erved in the army of England. Then he &s;urrounded his camp with lines of contravallation, &s;trengthened by redoubts, to prevent all &s;uccour from being thrown into the place; and the king repaired to the &s;iege, that his pre&s;ence might animate the &s;oldiers to redouble their endeavours. Talbot, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e precautions, re&s;olved to &s;uccour the be|&s;ieged. He marched at the head of a &s;mall body of cho&s;en men towards the French lines, and taking by &s;torm one of the redoubts that ob&s;tructed his pa&s;&s;age, entered the place with a convoy. Next day he retired in the &s;ame manner, before the enemy had recovered of their con&s;ternation, determined to throw in another more con&s;iderable &s;upply: but, before this could be pre|pared, the con&s;table, en$aged at the affront he had &s;u&s;tained from &s;uch an handful of Engli&s;h, pre&s;&s;ed the garri&s;on with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity and per&s;eve|rance, as obliged them to capitulate. The &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize encou|raged him to undertake the &s;iege of Avranche, which he had carried on for three weeks, when Talbo$, with the troops prepared for the relief of Meaux, forced his lines and revictualled the place. After this exploit he took the route<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1439.</NOTE> to Harfleur; and, as he had not a &s;ufficient number of forces to undertake
<PB N="330" REF="3400">
the &s;iege in form, he re&s;olved to reduce the town by blockade. For this purpo&s;e he entrenched him&s;elf &s;o advantageou&s;ly, that he might have &s;et an army of fifty thou&s;and men at defiance; while the place was blocked up by &s;ea with a fleet of &s;hips commanded by the duke of Somer&s;et. The count d'Eu, lately arrived from England, advanced with a body of troops to attack the Engli&s;h entrenchments; but, perceiving the nature of their &s;ituation, he thought proper to retire, after having made a &s;light attempt, in which Gaucour fell into the hands of Talbot. The blockade la&s;ted four months, at the end of which Talbot reduced the town; then he proceeded to clear the re&s;t of Normandy of the French garri&s;ons that po$&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal ca&s;tles, until the whole province was conquered except the town of Dieppe.</P>

<P>WHILE the generals amu&s;ed them&s;elves in taking and retak|ing towns, the &s;en&s;ible part of both nations &s;aw with regret the war protracted, without any pro&s;pect of a conclu&s;ion. The pope directed the cardinal de S$$. Croce to exhort the two kings in his name to put an end to the $$$u$ion of chri&s;tian blood, which had been &s;hed &s;o profu&s;ely in the cau&s;e of their quarrel; and at the &s;ame time, his holine&s;s wrote to the duke of Brit|tany, intreating him to undertake the office of mediator. That prince having communicated the pope's letter to both kings, found them equally di&s;po&s;ed to begin a new negotiation; and the duke of Burgundy was overjoyed at the pro|po&s;ed, becau&s;e, while the war continued, he ran &s;ome ri$que from the re&s;entment of the Engli&s;h, and could expect no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Charles towards the re|duction of his rebellious &s;ubjects in Flanders. The duke of Orleans &s;eized this opportunity of offering his mediation in conjunction with that of the duke of Brittany; and renewed his &s;ollicitations for leave to confer with that prince at Calais. This was granted, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who fore&s;aw that Orleans would not act the part of an impartial mediator. But the cardinal had by this time &s;uper&s;eded all the duke's intere&s;t in council; and the members were &s;o defirous of peace, that they &s;eemed to have forgot the vain hopes with which they had been amu&s;ed by Orleans, when he per&s;uaded them to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to the congre&s;s at Arras. The two courts therefore appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to adju&s;t the preparatory conventions for the congre&s;s; and the&s;e meeting, agreed, that a truce was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary towards the &s;ucce&s;s of the negotiation. Henry inve&s;ted his agents with power to ratify &s;uch a ce&s;&s;ation, which however did not take place. In the month of January, I&s;abel of Portugal, dutche&s;s of Burgundy, and the cardinal of Win|che&s;ter, conferred together between Calais and Gravelines, where they agreed, that the conferences &s;hould be opened between the two crowns, under the medi|ation of the dukes of Brittany and Orleans; and the plenipotentiaries on each &s;ide were cho&s;en from the principal noblemen of both kingdoms. Tho&s;e of England were furni&s;hed with in&s;tructions which plainly demon&s;trated the &s;in|cerity of Henry's council; and if the envoys had not been too &s;crupulous in concealing the extent of their re&s;pective powers, in all probability, the nego|tiation would have &s;ucceeded. But, they were &s;o cautious of betraying any part of their in&s;tructions that might give their opponents an advantage over them, that the conferences broke up before they had an opportunity of coming to a right under&s;tanding. The Engli&s;h did not think proper to advance be|yond the &s;econd article of their in&s;tructions, which directed them to propo&s;e, that Charles &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the provinces on the other &s;ide of the Loire, on condition of doing homage to Henry; and the French limited their conce&s;|&s;ions to the propo&s;al made in the conference at Arras, importing that their ma&s;ter, as &s;ole king of France, &s;hould cede Guienne and Normandy to Henry, as dependent f$efs of the French king, for which the Engli&s;h monarch &s;hould do homage. They mentioned this as an in&s;tance of great conde&s;cen&s;ion in Charles, who had not ri&s;en in his demands &s;ince the congre&s;s at Arras, although he had lately extended his conque&s;ts, and even made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the ca|pital.

<P>The dukes of Burgundy and Orleans were the only per&s;ons who reaped any advantage from this con$eren$e. The fir&s;t was determined to do &s;omething for the relief of his &s;ubjects in Flanders, Brabant, Holland, and Zealand, who had &s;u$$ered grievou&s;ly from the interruption of their trade with England. He therefore, employed the good offices of his dut$he&s;s, who being nearly related to king Henry, held &s;everal conferences with the cardinal of Winche&s;ter, on pre|tence of mediating an accommodation between the two crowns; and negotiated a commercial truce between England and the Low Countries. But, the duke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> of Orleans was $till a greater gainer by the conference; in con&s;equence of which, $e obtained his liberty after a captivity that la$ted five and twenty years. We have already ob&s;erved, that the cardinal had gained the a&s;cendancy over the &s;pirit of the king, who being a w$ak, timorous prince, was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded that the duke of Glouce&s;ter intended to keep him in perpetual &s;ervitude; and that his ambition was prejudicial to the intere&s;t of the kingdom. Henry's pa&s;&s;ions had been &s;o artfully prepoffe&s;&s;ed again&s;t his uncle, that he conceived an aver&s;ion to his character, and con&s;tantly declared again&s;t every propo&s;al which the duke made in council. This nobleman had always oppo&s;ed the relea&s;e of the duke of Orleans; not only in deference to the dying reque&s;t of his brother; but al&s;o, becau&s;e he was per&s;uaded that in relea&s;ing the duke of Orleans, they &s;hould a$gment the enemies of England. Glouce&s;ter's oppo&s;ition was of advantage to his propo&s;al of a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the congre&s;s. His mediation was accepted, and when the conferences opened, he &s;eemed extremely zealous for an accommo|dation. By means of the dutche&s;s of Burgundy he was reconciled to the duke her hu&s;band; and the cardinal, at his return to England, repre&s;ented hi$ con|duct in the mo&s;t advantageous light to the council, ob&s;erving, that &s;ince he had exerted his utmo&s;t endeavours for the benefit of the nation, he ought not to be a lo&s;er by the mi&s;carriage of the treaty. His friends took this opportunity of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1440.</NOTE> advancing the two arguments which have been already mentioned in his behalf; namely, that the divi&s;ion between him and the duke of Burgundy might revive, and be productive of advantage to England; and that his ran&s;ome would help to maintain the war. They propo&s;ed, however, that before his relea&s;e he &s;hould take an oath to the king, and &s;wear that he would in no &s;hape &s;upport the in|tere&s;t of Charles.</P>

<P>The duke of Glouce&s;ter perceiving that the council was determined to treat with Orleans about his enlargement, entered a formal prote&s;t to the $ol|lowing purpo&s;e: That, con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of Charles and his &s;on the dauphin, together with the capacity, in&s;inuation, and influence of the duke of Orleans, there was the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe the &s;tates of France would con$er upon him the admini&s;tration of affairs; an event, than which nothing could be more prejudicial to England, as that prince was &s;o well acquainted with the we$k parts of this government and kingdom: That, in all probability, the duke of Orleans would mediate a reconciliation between Charles and the dau|phin;
<PB N="334" REF="3440">
&s;o that England would lo&s;e all the advantages &s;he might otherwi&s;e derive$ $rom that di&s;&s;en&s;ion: That the duke having already acknowledged Charles for his &s;overeign, could not take an oath to Henry, without laying him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of infringing one or other of the&s;e obligations; and that therefore, he would naturally ob&s;erve the fir&s;t rather than the la&s;t; which he would always c$$&s;ider as extorted during his captivity, and which indeed, he could not ob|&s;erve without forfeiting his title and e&s;tate: That he could give no &s;ecurity to which they might have recour&s;e, in ca&s;e he &s;hould violate his oath, on pretence of obeying the ab&s;ol$te commands of his &s;overeign: That the reconciliation la$ely effected at Calais between the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, &s;eemed rather to pre&s;age an union of their intere&s;ts again&s;t the Engli&s;h, than a di&s;&s;en&s;ion which might be &s;erviceable to his maje&s;ty: That, if any of the noblemen who &s;erved the king in France, &s;hould happen to be taken in the cour&s;e of the war, four or five of &s;uch pri&s;oners might be exchanged for the duke of Orleans; but, this advantage would be lo&s;t by his relea&s;e: That, &s;hould the enlargement of that prince occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of all the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts in France, the people would not fail to exclaim again&s;t the king's coun&s;ellors, who advi&s;ed a mea&s;ure by which the king had been deprived of all the glory and advantage acquired at the price of the late king's life, and of the lives of the dukes of Claren$e, Bedford, and &s;uch an infinite number of princes, nobles, and gentle|men, as had died or fallen in France, &s;ince the beginning of the di&s;pute: la$tly, That the late king, wi&s;ely fore&s;eeing the danger that would ari&s;e from the relea&s;e of the duke of Orleans, had in his la&s;t moments recommended the de$ention of that prince, until a &s;olid peace could be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. Such were the principal articles of the prote&s;t which the duke of Glouce&s;ter made in council, intreating his maje&s;ty would order it to be enrolled; and that a copy of it, aut$enticated by the great &s;eal, &s;hould be delivered into his hands, that it might &s;erve to acquit him in any future inquiry. The king complied with his de&s;ire in this particular; but, his prote&s;t did not hinder the council from ex|ecuting the re&s;olution they had taken in behalf of the duke of Orleans.</P>

<P>The conventions relating to his enlargement were &s;igned and &s;ealed by both parties on the &s;econd day of July; and, he obtained his liberty on much ea&s;ier conditions than tho&s;e he had offered of his own accord before the congre&s;s at Arras. He was not obliged to acknowledge Henry as king of France; much le&s;s, to deliver the towns which he had formerly offered as a &s;ecurity for the performance of his contract. His word and oath were deemed &s;ufficient for the payment of his ran&s;ome; which was fixed at one hundred and twenty thou&s;and crowns. He engaged, indeed, to pay one half of the &s;um before his departure from England, and give the obligations of the dauphin, the duke of Bretagne, and &s;ome other princes, for the remainder, to be remitted after his relea&s;e. He likewi&s;e undertook to deliver into the hands of his ma|je&s;ty, letters patent of king Charles, authori&s;ing this agreement; and promi&s;ing to hold the duke of Orleans as infamous, &s;hould $e violate his engagements. Before he quitted England, however, he declared to the council, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;e the fir&s;t moiety of his ran&s;ome, unle&s;s they would permit him to vi&s;it his e&s;tate in France; and he was indulged with leave to ab&s;ent him&s;elf<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. P$b.</NOTE> for a whole year on that account. Yet, in order to dazzle the eyes of the pub|lic, which could not, without murmuring, behold the injunction of the late
<PB N="335" REF="3450">
king &s;o palpably neglected, Henry declared, by a public act, $hat in &s;etting the duke of Orleans at liberty, he did not intend to $ontradict the will of his father; and, that his &s;ole view was to ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion of a peace. For this purpo&s;e, a new convention was made with the duke; in which it was $$$|pulated, that he &s;hould exert his utmo&s;t endeavours to effect an accommod$|tion between the two crowns; and, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;hould be acqui$$ed of his whole ran&s;ome; but, &s;hould his efforts mi&s;carry, he promi&s;ed to return to his captivity in England. This agreement was intirely calculated for the &s;ati$|faction of the people, without any intention of performance. The duke taking leave of England, was conducted to Gravelines, where he renewed his oath for the performance of his engagements, and, on the twelf$h day of No|vember was met by the duke of Burgundy, who&s;e niece, Margaret of Clev$s, he married at St. Omer, according to a late agreement between him and Philip, when the dutche&s;s of Burgundy became re&s;pon&s;ible to the king of England for the dauphin's obligation, to pay thirty thou&s;and crowns of the ran&s;ome.</P>

<P>The duke of Brittany &s;till pretended to ob&s;erve a neutrality, although the &s;uccours which his brother the con&s;table brought, from time to time, into the army of Charles, could not be levied in his country, without his con&s;ent or connivance. At another juncture, the Engli&s;h would have re&s;ented this col|lu&s;ion; but, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of their affairs, they &s;eemed con|tented with the duke's forbearing to declare openly in favour of their enemies. Neverthele&s;s, as the Engli&s;h and Bretons mole&s;ted one another by &s;ea, and in|terrupted trade, to the mutual prejudice of both nations; the king and duke found it convenient to conclude a treaty, by which they mutually engaged to hinder all armaments from being equipped in their harbours, with a view to injure the &s;ubjects of each other. The earl of Warwick, who had &s;uper&s;eded<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the duke of York as regent of France, dying in the cour&s;e of this year, the duke re&s;umed that office; and had he been properly &s;upported, might have re|&s;tored the affairs of England to their former lu&s;tre; for, at this period, the dauphin and all the princes of the blood, except the duke of Burgundy, and the count D'Eu, engaged in a league to depo&s;e Charles, and rai&s;e his &s;on to the throne. Luckily for the French king, they numbered La Tremo$ille among their a&s;&s;ociates; and, as the con&s;table mortally hated that nobleman, he the more warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Charle$; and &s;upported him &s;o powerfully, that he was in a condition to maintain his royalty again&s;t all the con$ederates. This civil war, known by the name of La Praguerie, was &s;o ill conducted by them, that in a little time, they were obliged to implore the king's mercy. While this in&s;urrection continued, the Engli&s;h did not attempt to &s;trike any &s;troke of importance, contenting them&s;eves with a few &s;light incur$$ons into the neighbourhood of Paris, to which Charles returned a$ter the termination of the civil war.</P>

<P>The dutche&s;s of Burgundy having employed all her intere&s;t in per&s;uading the two kings to renew the conferences for a peace, they were at length prevailed upon to appoint plenipotentiaries for that purpo&s;e; St. Omer was the place pitched upon for the congre&s;s; and, the duke of Orleans cho&s;en as one of the mediators. This conference proved as ineffectual as the former. The count<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1441.</NOTE> de Vendome, chief of the French emba&s;&s;y, re$u&s;ed to treat with the Engli&s;h envoys, on pretence of their being his inferiors in rank and quality; though
<PB N="336" REF="3460">
they were both peers of England, namely, the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and the l$rd Fanhop. In the reign of Henry V. the French did not take &s;uch excep|tions. They were then glad to confer with &s;imple doctors of the law, pro|perly authori&s;ed. During this negotiation Charles a&s;&s;embled an army, wi$h which he inve&s;ted Cr$il on the river Oy&s;e, which capitulated about the end of April. His next enterprize was the &s;iege of Pontoi&s;e, which he undertook with twelve thou&s;and men, in the beginning of July. The dauphin and all the be&s;t generals in France were pre&s;ent upon this occa&s;ion; and the attacks were carried on with extraordinary valour. The garri&s;on defended them&s;elves with $qual prowe&s;s; and, Talbot forcing one of the French quarters, introduced a convoy, which in&s;pired them with $re&s;h courage; &s;o that the be&s;iegers made but &s;low progre&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding all their care and vigilance again&s;t the at|tempts of &s;uch a formidable warrior, he found means at three different times, to &s;uccour the be&s;ieged; but, Charles &s;till ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to take the place, which he had be&s;ieged at the reque&s;t of the Pari&s;ians, who defrayed the whole expence of the enterprize. At length, the duke of York having received a &s;mall reinforcement from England, which rai&s;ed the number of his troops to eight thou&s;and, he approached Pontoi&s;e, and &s;ent a herald with a me&s;&s;age to the king, challenging him to battle. Charles replied, that he did not intend to regulate his conduct according to the de&s;ires of his enemy. The river Oy&s;e ran between the two armies, and the bridge was guarded by a detachment of a thou&s;and men; &s;o that he continued the &s;iege at lei&s;ure, with|out any apprehen&s;ion of being attacked. The duke of York, however, tran&s;|ported five or &s;ix hundred men by night, in boats made of tanned leather: this detachment falling &s;uddenly upon the guard of the bridge, put them all to the &s;word, and opened the pa&s;&s;age for the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h army. Charles was &s;eized with &s;uch con&s;ternation at this unfore&s;een a&s;&s;ault, that he forthwith rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and retired under the cannon of Poi&s;&s;i. Thither he was fol|lowed by the duke of York, who again challenged him to battle; but, he refu&s;ed to quit his po&s;t; and the regent retreated, after having pillaged the abbey of Poi&s;&s;i, and the neighbouhood. This precipitate retreat from Pontoi&s;e, before an army much le&s;s numerous than his own, produced great clamours again&s;t Charles; who&s;e reputation &s;uffered to &s;uch a degree, that his friends gave him to under&s;tand, it would be ab&s;olutel$ nece&s;&s;ary to re-e&s;tabli&s;h his character by &s;ome &s;ignal exploit. Thus ro$$ed, he marched back to Ponto$&s;e, when he was l$a&s;t expected, recommenced the &s;iege, which he carried on with &s;urpr$$$ng vigour; and at length, took the place by a&s;&s;ault, he him&s;elf $ounting the breach among the foremo&s;t, and fighting hand to hand with the brave&s;t o$ the defenders. This atchievement intirely effaced the bad impre&s;&s;ions his ret$eat had made, and convinced his &s;ubjects, that his aver&s;ion to military operations was not owing to want of per&s;onal courage, but the effect of an indolent di&s;|po&s;ition, which he could not help indulging. Some time after this exploit, he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi$$. d$ Ch$r. $II.</NOTE> reduced the town of Evreux, by means of a fi&s;herman, who introduced a body of French forces &s;ufficient to expel the Engli&s;h garri&s;on.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in France, the cardinal of Winche&s;ter, not contented with having ruined the intere&s;t of the duke of Glouce&s;ter in the $oun|cil, concerted &s;chemes again&s;t the life of that prince, by endeavouring to fix upon him the imputation of high trea&s;on. He hoped, that the neglect of the king$

and the repeated $lights he had &s;u&s;tained from the council, would have pr$|voked a man of his warm $emper to u&s;e &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions that might be $$$|&s;trued to his prejudice; and he introduced &s;pies into his family, in order $word$ watch his conver&s;ation. But the d$ke, with all his imperfections, was to$ warmly attached to his &s;overeign, to furni&s;h the lea&s;t handle of this &s;ort again&s;t him&s;elf; and, the cardinal was obliged to change his battery. Being perfectly well acquainted with the weakne&s;s, pride, and ambition of Humphrey's dutch|e&s;s, he directed his agents to ob&s;erve her conduct; and they perceived, that &s;h$ maintained a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with a prie&s;t called Roger Bolinbroke, who pretended to under&s;tand negromancy, and a woman who dealt in love-powders and incantations. Sir John Hume another prie&s;t, and one Woodhame, who acted as the cardinal's emi&s;&s;aries, found means to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into this cabal; and made &s;uch reports of their communication as were judged &s;ufficient grounds for granting a warrant again&s;t Bolinbroke; who was no &s;ooner com|mitted to pri&s;on, than the dutche&s;s retired to the &s;anctuary of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The re&s;t of the accomplices being &s;eized and examined, a proce&s;s was formed again&s;t her, for having practi&s;ed $orcery again&s;t the life of the king; by making an image of wax to re&s;emble his maje&s;ty, and melting it gradually before the fire, in hope that, as this con&s;umed, the king's con&s;titution would decay. The dutche&s;s being per&s;uaded to quit the &s;anctuary, was confronted with B$lin|broke, who denied that there was any intention to deal with the devil, or injure his maje&s;ty; and all that the dutche&s;s confe&s;&s;ed was, her having con&s;ulted tho&s;e accomplices about giving a love-potion to her hu&s;band, to prevent the alienation of his affection. Hume and Woodhame in&s;i&s;ted on the circum|&s;tance of the image; and, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and York, the car|dinal of Winche&s;ter, and the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, who were appointed to in|quire into this my&s;terious affair, made a report &s;o unfavourable for the $word$ that a court, con&s;i&s;ting of the earls of Huntingdon, Stafford, Suffolk, and Northumberland, was erected to try her for high trea&s;on. After having ex|amined all the evidence, they referred the matter to the ec$le&s;ia&s;tical court; by which &s;he was &s;entenced to do public pennance for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, by walk|ing barefoot and bareheaded, with a wax taper in her hand, through the &s;treets of London to St. Paul's church; and then to be committed to pri&s;on for life, to the cu&s;tody of Sir Thomas Stanley. A &s;entence which was literally ex$cuted; the enemies of Glouce&s;ter hoping, that this public di&s;grace would either ruin his popularity, or provoke him to take &s;ome de&s;perate mea&s;ures again&s;t the government: but, they were di&s;appointed in their expectation. The duke was an enthu&s;ia&s;t in loyalty, and bore his wrongs with the utmo&s;t re&s;ignation; and the di&s;grace of his wife, in&s;tead of bringing him into contempt with the people, &s;erved only to incen&s;e them again&s;t his adver&s;aries.</P>

<P>Ever &s;ince the duke's credit declined in the council, the war in France &s;eemed almo&s;t utterly neglected; and every favourable opportunity of retriev|ing the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts, was overlooked. Immediately after the reduction of Pontoi&s;e, the princes of France engaged in a new league again&s;t Charles; and this a&s;&s;ociation was headed by the duke of Orleans, who had been incen&s;ed at the cold reception he met with from the king, after a captivity of five and twenty years, incurred in the defence of his &s;overeign$ during which, he had
<PB N="338" REF="3480">
done important &s;$rvices to his country. This confederacy would have been much more dangerous than the former, if the king had not pru|dently detached the duke from it by con&s;iderable conce&s;&s;ions; and the defec|tion of this prince broke the me$&s;ures of the a&s;&s;ociates, who had recour&s;e again to the king's clemency. This &s;torm being overblown, Charles a&s;&s;embled a numerous army to relieve Tartas, a town of Guienne, belonging to the hou&s;e of Albret; which was be&s;ieged by the earl of Huntingdon. The garri&s;on having made a gallant defence till the month of January, at length capitulated, on condition, that the place &s;hould be depo&s;ited in the hands of two noblemen in that country, to be delivered to the Engli&s;h, if not relieved by the twenty|fourth day of June. Charles having time enough to make preparations, pa&s;&s;ed the winter in Poictou, where he mu&s;tered a very numerous army; to which all<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1442.</NOTE> the noblemen of the kingdom re&s;orted. In the &s;pring, he began his march to Limoges, from whence he advanced to Montauban; and then took the route to Tholou&s;e, where he &s;ummoned the counts of Armagnac and Comminges, to app$$$ before the parliament of that city, and an&s;wer to the charge of Margaret, wi$$ to the latter; whom they had detained two and twenty years pri&s;oner in a ca&s;tle, becau&s;e &s;he refu&s;ed to bequeath to her hu&s;band the county of Com|minges, which was her own patrimony. She had married Matthew de Grailly, brother of John $$unt de Foix; by whom &s;he had one daughter, of an infirm con&s;titution. The father &s;uppo&s;ing, that the life of this child would not be of long duration$ pre&s;&s;ed the counte&s;s to declare him heir to his own daughter; but, &s;he re&s;i&s;ted all his &s;ollicitations. Her refu&s;al produced a quarrel and &s;epa|ration. The hu&s;band agreed to a partition of her territories with the count d'Armagnac; who attacked, defeated, and took the counte&s;s pri&s;oner. During her confinement, however, &s;he found means to make a will in favour of her daughter; and, in ca&s;e of her death, beque$thing her county of Comminges to Charles VII. king of France. The daughter dying in a little time after this will was executed; and Charles being informed of the clau&s;e in his favour, he re&s;olved to &s;et the counte&s;s at liberty, and obtain her confirmation of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$$$relet.</NOTE> will. It was for this purpo&s;e that he &s;ummoned her hu&s;band and the count de Armagnac to Tholou&s;e; whither this la&s;t was obliged to bring the old coun|te&s;s now turned of four&s;core. She was immediately &s;et at liberty; and her will being confirmed by a decree of the parliament, Charles took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the county of Comminges. The count of Armagnac was not only obliged to part with his acqui&s;ition; but, even forbid to exerci&s;e the rights of regality within his own territories. He looked upon this &s;everity as a very ungrateful requital for all the &s;ervices which his family had done to the crown of France; and re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity of revenging him&s;elf upon Charles. In the&s;e &s;entiments, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to demand the protection of Henry, and offer one of his daughters in marriage to that monarch. His propo&s;al be|ing examined in council, was accepted. The king forthwith appointed am|ba&s;&s;adors to regula$e the $o$ditions of the match, and conclude the alliance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

The Engli&s;h council was not ignorant of the French king's preparations for this expedition; but they took no &s;teps to oppo&s;e his de&s;ign; and &s;eemed in|tirely
<PB N="339" REF="3490">
to neglect the defence of Guienne, which was now upon the point of being withdrawn from the dominion of England. Charles made him&s;elf ma$ter of St. Sever; inve&s;ted Ais, which &s;urrendered after a &s;iege of &s;even weeks; La Reole was taken by &s;torm; Marmande fell into the hands of the French; and Charles after the&s;e conque&s;ts retired to Tholou&s;e, where he &s;pent the winter.</P>

<P>At length the Engli&s;h &s;eemed to wake from their infatuation, and re|&s;olved to make a diver&s;ion, at the other end of the kingdom. Five thou&s;and men being levied in England, the command of them was given to Talbot, lately created earl of Shrew&s;bury, who, landing in Normandy, &s;oon compelled the Ba&s;tard of Orleans to quit the field. While the earl be&s;ieged the ca$tle of Couches, the other, who was lately honoured with the title of count de Dunois, endeavoured to make a diver&s;ion, by inve&s;ting Galardon; but Couches being taken in a few days, h$ did not think proper to wait for the Engli&s;h, who ad|vanced to give him battle. When Dunois retired, the earl of Shrew&s;bury marched to Dieppe, the mo&s;t important place which the French king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Normandy; and as he had not a &s;ufficient number of troops to carry on the &s;iege in form, he took by a&s;&s;ault the fort of Charles-Me&s;nil, &s;ituated on the mountain of Polet, &s;o as to command the avenues of the town; and as the month of November was already well advanced, he re&s;olved to block up the town during the winter. With this view he enlarged the fort he had taken, repaired the works, rai&s;ed his batteries, and leaving the conduct of the &s;iege to his natural &s;on, returned to England, to &s;ollicit a more con&s;iderable reinforce|ment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi$t. de Char.

<P>The public clamour was &s;o loud again&s;t this meddling prelate, as a fu|rious per&s;ecutor of all tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the pope's u&s;urpation, that the duke of Glouce&s;ter ventured to impeach him before the council, in fourteen articles, importing, That he had accepted the dignity of cardinal, contrary to the order of the late king, and to the prejudice of the metropolitan church of Canterbury: That, in procuring a bull from the pope, to &s;ecure him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bi|&s;hopric of Winche&s;ter, after he had forfeited his right to that $ee, he had acted contrary to the laws of the kingdom, and in particular to the &s;tatute of Prem$|nire: That, in conjunction with John Kemp archbi&s;hop of York, he had en|gro&s;&s;ed the government of the king's per&s;on, without legal authority: That he had defrauded the king of his jewels: That, while chancellor of the realm, he had &s;ealed an order for relea&s;ing the king of Scotland; and another for remit|ting the ran&s;om of that prince, on condition that he &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e his niece: That he had deprived the king of his revenues, in receiving for his own u&s;e the cu&s;tom for wool in the port of Southampton: That he had pre&s;umed to &s;um|mon per&s;ons before him, to the prejudice of the rights of the crown and the royal authority: That he had obtained from Rome an exemption from taxes, in favour of his dioce&s;e, to the prejudice of his maje&s;ty, thereby &s;etting a per$i|cious example to other prelates: That he had been the in&s;trument for recon|ciling the duke of Burgundy with king Charles and the duke of Orleans, to t$e mani$e&s;t di&s;advantage of England: That, while he acted as amba&s;&s;ador and
<PB N="340" REF="3500">
plenipote$$iary for-negotiating a peace, he had &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of York to per&s;uade his maje$$y to renounce his title to the crown of France, to the di&s;grace of the king and his illu&s;trious ance&s;tors: That the enlargement of the duke of Or$eans had been procured by his intrigues and tho&s;e of the duke of York, agai$$t the expre&s;s injunction of the late king: That, in the &s;tation of chancel|lor, he him&s;$lf had purcha&s;ed lands of the king, in&s;tead of preventing &s;uch alie|n$tions, according to the duty of his office: That, in granting commi&s;&s;ions in the army to none but his own creatures, he had been the occa&s;ion of all the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained in France: And that he had &s;old commi&s;&s;ions to per&s;ons un|qualified for the &s;ervice. The&s;e articles were read in council; but, as all the members were devoted to the cardinal, they admitted the act of amne&s;ty which had been pa&s;&s;ed in favour of that prelate, to whom the king granted a new<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ac$$ Pa$.</NOTE> pardon. The cardinal was by this time in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the court and coun|cil. He had introduced the earl of Suffolk into the &s;ervice of Henry, who conceived &s;uch an affection for that nobleman, that he was entirely guided by his direction. This favourite repre&s;ented Winche&s;ter as the &s;ubject upon who&s;e parts and fidelity his chief dependence ought to be placed; and John Kemp archbi$hop of York &s;econded his recommendation. Not contented with extol|ling the character of the cardinal, they took all opportunities of reviling Glou|ce&s;ter, whom they painted as a very dangerous nobleman, who had de&s;igns upon the crown, and who endeavoured to engage his maje&s;ty in fal&s;e mea&s;ures, by which he might incur the hatred and contempt of his &s;ubjects. The king, who was equally de&s;titute of &s;pirit and penetration, believed the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions: and the duke's impatient temper &s;eemed to confirm their accu&s;ations; for he could not endu$e the daily mortifications to which he was expo&s;ed, without expre&s;&s;ing his re&s;entment, and even denouncing vengeance again&s;t his adver&s;aries.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ Ch. 1443.</NOTE> In the beginning of the year, a &s;ecret negotiation$ was brought upon the carpet between Henry and the duke of Burgundy, who, de&s;pairing of a general accommodation, re&s;olved to extricate him&s;elf from a ruinous war, by means of a particular truce with England. This he was the rather di&s;po&s;ed to conclude, as he had rea&s;ons to be di&s;&s;atisfied with Charles; to believe the recon|ciliation was altogether political on the &s;ide of the French king; and that &s;o &s;oon as his affairs &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, his former animo&s;ity would be re|vived. He therefore thought he &s;hould act again&s;t his own intere&s;t in a&s;&s;i&s;ting him to fini&s;h a war, the &s;ucce&s;s of which might render him too powerful; and he ve&s;ted his dutche&s;s with full power, to conclude a general truce for all his $ominions with the king of England. That which was already made, related only to the commerce between the Low Countries and that kingdom; but this which the dutche&s;s concluded in April, comprehended Burgundy and all the duke's territories in general, to continue in force until one of the parties &s;hould renounce the engagement; in which ca&s;e, he &s;hould give notice of his intention<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo$$$$elet.</NOTE> three months before the actual rupture. The blockade of Dieppe had now contin$ed eight months, during which no &s;uccours arrived from England; and Charles re&s;olving to relieve the place before the arrival of the expected re|inforcement, the dauphin earne&s;tly &s;ollicited the command of this expedition. It was not without reluctance that his father complied with his reque&s;t. He dreaded the turbulent di&s;po&s;ition of that young prince; and was afraid of tru&s;t|ing him with a body of $orces, at the head of which he might renew his rebel|lious
<PB N="341" REF="3510">
mea&s;ures. The&s;e con&s;iderations, however, yielded to the nece&s;&s;ity of relieving Dieppe, which was now reduced to extremity. The dauphin began his march from Guienne with four thou&s;and hor&s;e; and perceiving that the fort of Charles-Me&s;nil, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h, was impregnable from the &s;ide of the country, he threw him&s;elf into the place in &s;pite of all their oppo&s;i|tion. Without giving them time to recollect them&s;elves, he made a &s;ally with all his forces; and attacking it on the &s;ide of the town, was $epul&s;ed in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;&s;aults: in the fourth, however, he carried the place &s;word in hand; and the Engli&s;h, finding them&s;elves thus di&s;abled from continuing the blockade, retired in good order. John duke of Somer&s;et arrived from England in about five days after their retreat, and brought a reinforcement of five thou&s;and men, which, had it landed &s;ooner, might have prevented the dauphi$$'s &s;ucce&s;s: but the blockade being rai&s;ed, all he could do was to ravage part of the country, and reduce &s;ome incon&s;iderable ca&s;tl$s.</P>

<P>While the dauphin gathered laurels in Normandy, the count d'Ar|magnac a&s;&s;embled a body of $orces, and r$took part of the county of Cominges, which he had lo&s;t by the award of the parliament of Th$lou&s;e; and Charles, who was immer&s;ed in voluptuous plea&s;ures at Tours, could not be prevailed upon to relinqui&s;h his ea&s;e, and check the progre&s;s of this new enemy. He re|&s;erved the glory of this expedition for the da$phi$, who, at his return from Normandy, undertook it without he&s;itation. At his approach the count found him&s;elf abandoned by all his friends; nor did the Engli&s;h take the lea&s;t &s;tep for &s;upporting his intere&s;t, although their king was contracted to his daughter. The dauphin therefore met with very little oppo&s;ition in reducing Ro$verg$e, and all the dominions of the count, except the little town of Li&s;le in Jourdain, which was for a long time be&s;ieged in vain. At length the dauphin, de&s;pairing of being able to reduce it by force, invited the count to a conference, on the faith of a &s;ate-conduct, and &s;ent him to the king, who detained him without &s;cru|ple; though, after a confinement of two years, he was relea&s;ed and re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his territories, at the inter$e&s;&s;ion of the kings of Ca&s;tile and Navarre.

<P>France and England were by this time equally tired of a pernicious<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1444$</NOTE> war, which had raged for thirty years without interruption. The princes and grandees of France were quite di&s;heartened by the fatigues and lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained; the country and towns were de&s;erted; and the kingdom, though formerly populous, could no longer furni&s;h &s;oldie$s for the &s;ervice: the duke of Orleans, in pur&s;uance of his engagements, continually &s;ollicited Charles to li&s;ten to terms of accommodation; the duke of Burgundy pre&s;&s;ed him on the &s;ame &s;ubject; and all the people ardently wi&s;hed for an end to the calam$|ties of war. England was no le&s;s de&s;irous of peace: all the money of the king|dom was &s;unk in the bottomle&s;s gul$h of this war, from when$e it never could be retrieved. The king was naturally pacific; and his council, chiefly com|po&s;ed of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, plainly perceived that the continuation of an un&s;ucce&s;sful war mu&s;t render them odious to the people, who generally impute every mi$|carriage to the mi&s;conduct of the admini&s;tration. The duke of Glouce&s;t$r alone was of opinion that they ought to make fre&s;h efforts, to reap the advan|tage
<PB N="342" REF="3520">
of the French king's weakne&s;s, and the &s;eparate truce lately concluded with the duke of Burgu$dy; but his opinion was of no weight with a council made up of his profe&s;&s;ed enemies. The two kings at length agreed to a con|gre&s;s; and the Engli&s;h mini$try was &s;o $ame as to con$ent to its being held at Tours, where Charles re$$ded, as if they h$d gone to his court to beg an accom|modation. The earl of Su$$olk was appointed chief of the emba&s;&s;y; and as his power $$$ched even farther than a treaty with France, he was furni&s;hed with an $uthentic $$der of council, directing him to execute every point of his in&s;truc|tions. The conferences being opened, &s;everal propo&s;itions were &s;tarted on both &s;ides, on the &s;ubject of a general peace; but as they were mutually rejected, the whole re&s;ult o$ the negotiation was a truce for about two years between the two crowns; and, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame year, another for &s;even years<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme$.</NOTE> was concluded at Edinburgh between England and Scotland.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XIV.</HEAD>
<P>This affair being terminated, the earl of Suffolk proceeded to exe|cu$e the other part of his commi&s;&s;ion. He propo&s;ed a match between the king his ma&s;ter, and Margaret of A$jou, $aughter of Ren&eacute;, who, &s;ince the death of his elder brother Lewis, had $&s;&s;$med the ti$le of king of Sicily. She was a prince&s;s of great beauty, &s;pirit, pe$etration, and fortitude; and extremely well calculated for an&s;we$ing the expect$$ion of Suffolk, who had already pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Henry in her $$vour, in hope of eng$ging her in the cabal again&s;t the popular duke of Glou$$$$er. Though the propo&s;al was extremely agreeable to France, Charles, who knew the impati$$ce of Henry and his council, managed the treaty with &s;uch addre&s;s, that the earl of Suffolk, in&s;tead of demanding a dower with Margaret, promi$ed, in the name of his ma&s;ter, that the whole pro|vince of Maine $hould be e$ded to her uncle, Charles of Anjou. The articles of the marriage being adju$$ed, the earl returned to England to lay his tran&s;actions before the mini&s;try, that they might be approved and confirmed by the king and council. The duke of Glouce&s;ter, who now for the fir&s;t time under&s;tood the nature of the treaty, vehemently oppo&s;ed it with two rea&s;ons, which indeed were unan&s;werable. He ob&s;erved, that the king was already engaged in a con|tract of marriage with the daughter of the count of Armagnac, which he could not renounce with any regard to honour and good faith; and that Maine, being the bulwark of Normandy, could not be ceded without expo&s;ing this whole province to the mo&s;t imminent danger. This, like all his other remon&s;trances, was neglected, and the earl of Suffolk empowered to e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Mar|garet, as Henry's pro$y. That weak prince was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this pre|po&s;terous alliance, that, in token of his &s;atisfaction, he created the earl marquis of Suffolk; John Holland earl of Huntingdon was promoted to the dukedom of Exeter; Humphrey earl of S$rafford was honoured with the title of duke of Buckingham; and that of duke of Warwick be&s;towed upon Henry, &s;on of the late earl, who had been regent in France. The nuptials were &s;olemnized in the city of Tours, in pre&s;ence of king Charles and all his court, with &s;uch mag|nificence as but ill agreed with the poverty of the bride, and the low circum|&s;tances of both nations. This ceremony was performed in November; and in &s;pring the new $ueen &s;et out for England, accompanied by an honourable train of Engli$h l$d$$s, who had rep$ired to France $or that purpo&s;e.

<P>The parliament had m$t before Margaret's arrival; and, after her co|ronation, the marquis of Suffolk made a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, expatiating upon the advantages o$ this alliance, a$ well as upon his own &s;ervices$ both i$ the cabinet and in the field; but in particular he held for$h upon $he conduct, prudence, and addre&s;s, with which $e had adju$$ed the articles of this l$&s;t treaty, which would be attended with peace and &s;atisfaction to the w$ole na|tion. The parliament took his own word for the impor$ance of his &s;ervices, approved his management, and out of two fifteenths, which $hey granted for the occa&s;ions of the &s;tate, allotted one half to this nobleman, to d$$ray the expence of bringing over the prince$$. The re&s;t of the year was employed in negotiations for renewing the conferences, and facilitating an interview between the two king$, which they imagined would contribute more than any other mea&s;ure, towards a &s;olid pacification.

On the very fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, he was arre&s;ted and committed to clo&s;e pri&s;on, on p$etence of an infor$ation charging him with a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king, &s;eize the crown, and deliver his wife from the ca&s;tle of Kenilworth, where &s;he was detained a pri&s;oner. All the duke's well-wi&s;hers, though incen&s;ed at the i$ju&s;tice of this arre&s;t, took it for granted that he would acquit him&s;el$ honour|ably on his trial, and were the le&s;s alarmed for that very rea&s;on: but the un|fort$na$$ prince had no opportunity to manife$t the fal&s;ity of the charge.

<P>Even this in&s;tance of lenity, &s;o contrary to the nature of Suffolk, could not efface the impre&s;&s;ions which had been made upon the public by the murder of Good Duke Humphrey. Henry him&s;elf was not &s;u&s;pected of having been concerned in this tragedy, but the queen was univer&s;ally reviled as the author of the deed; and the marquis, with the re&s;t of the mini&s;try, were cur&s;ed by the people with the mo&s;t bitter impr$$ations. Nothing more clearly de|mon&s;trates the weakne&s;s of human fore&s;ight, than the fate of the duke of Glouce&s;ter; in con&s;equence of which the queen believed her&s;elf $$i&s;ed above all oppo&s;ition; whereas it proved the introduction of numberle&s;s ealamities, which &s;he and her family underwent in the &s;equel, b$cau&s;e it furni&s;hed the duke of York with an opportunity to advance his pre$$$&s;ions to the crown, which in all probability he would not have maintained, or even $word$ to publi&s;h, during the life of the duke of Glouce&s;ter. The cardinal of Win|che&s;ter did not long &s;urvive the death of his adver&s;ary, in which he had been principally concerned. In le&s;s than five weeks after the duke's dec$a&s;e, this haughty prelate was &s;eized with a di&s;temper that brought him to hi$ grave; and he died with all the terrors of a guilty con&s;cience. His d$$$h deprived the queen, and her favourite Suffolk, of the great weight and influence which was attached to the cardinal's power and immen&s;e fortune; and left the marquis more than ever expo&s;ed to the hatred and invectives of the people.</P>

<P>The time fixed for the conclu&s;ion of the peace with France being elap&s;ed, and no &s;teps taken towards that de&s;irable event, they clamoured again&s;t Suffolk, and did not &s;cruple to tax him aloud with having betrayed the intere&s;t of his country, in yielding Le Maine to the French; and, in lieu of a &s;olid peace, trumping up a ruinous truce, during which the enemy forti$$ed them&s;elves at lei&s;ure. The&s;e clamours increa&s;ing every day, the marquis de|&s;ired he might be allowed to ju&s;tify his conduct before the king; and a day being fixed for that purpo&s;e, he, in pre&s;ence of &s;everal noblemen attached to his intere&s;t, explained all his tran&s;actions in France, and produced the order of council by virtue of which he had acted. The king was &s;o well &s;ati$$$ed with his defence, that he publicly acquitted him of all mi&s;conduct; i&s;&s;ued letters$patent under the great &s;eal, declaring him innocent of $ll the imputa|tions laid to his charge, and forbidding his &s;ubjects, on pain of incurring his di&s;plea&s;ure, to &s;ay or act any thing to the prejudice of his character. Even this te&s;timony of his innocence could not &s;ilence the murmurs of the public. They not only abhorred him as the author of Glouce&s;ter's death, and as the traitor who had given away Le Maine; but they hated him &s;till more im|placably, for having effected the marriage between the king and Margaret, which they looked upon as one of the greate&s;t calamities that ever had hap|pened to England. They could not bear the admini&s;tration of this foreign prince&s;s, who&s;e rule was in&s;olent and arbitrary, and who made no other u&s;e of the king but that of giving a &s;anction to her own mea&s;ures. He was generally employed at his devotions; and &s;he took care to encourage him in tho&s;e exerci&s;es of religion, that his mind and attention might be wholly aliena$ed from the affairs of government. She &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e her murmurs of the people, in defiance of whom &s;he rai&s;ed her favourite to the dignity of duke of Suffolk, and cultivated &s;uch an intimacy of communication with that noblemen as proved of very little advantage to her character.</P>

<P>The univer&s;al odium th$t prevailed again&s;t the qu$en and her mini|&s;ter, added to the inactive di&s;po&s;ition and incap$city of the king him&s;elf, en|couraged Richard duke of York to rai&s;e his views to the throne of England. We have already ob&s;erved that he was heir to $word$ de&s;cended from Lio$el, third &s;on of Edward III. and con&s;equently his ti$$e was pre&s;erable to that of Henry, who &s;prang from the lions of John of Ga$$t, who was Lio|nel's younger brother. Before Richard would embark in any mea&s;ures for the &s;upport of his preten&s;ions, he thought proper to $ound the inclinations of the people, by emi&s;&s;aries who took occa&s;ion, from the de$potic government of Margaret, to ob&s;erve, that the people were $word$ to a double u$urpation: that Margaret u&s;urped a power which &s;he had no right to exerci&s;e, &s;uppo$$ng her hu&s;band to be lawful king of England; but that the royalty of the hou$e of Lanca&s;ter was founded upon u&s;urpation, which, though it had been ren|dered tolerable by the &s;hining vi$tues of the l$$e king$ was n$w become in|&s;upportable, con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of Henry, and the pride of his queen, the de&s;cendant of a family which had always been at mortal enmity with the Engli&s;h nation; and that, in &s;uch an emergency, the people ought to turn their eyes upon the duke of York, who was the true heir of the crown, a prince of great qualities and eminent virtue, who had already done the mo&s;t impor|tant &s;ervices to his country. Such in&s;inuations, artfully circulated, rai&s;ed up a great number of parti&s;ans to the duke, who did not &s;eem to intere&s;t him&s;elf in the &s;ubject; though the ob&s;ervations of the people on this occa&s;ion alarmed the queen and the whole hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. They did not doubt but Richard was at the bottom of all this clamour; and they re&s;olved to dimini&s;h his credit, by &s;ubjecting him to &s;ome mortification, and encouraging the rival of his power and reputation. This was Edmund duke of Somer&s;et, who was created regent of France, without any regard to the commi&s;&s;ion of the duke of York, granted for a term of years not yet expired. Somer&s;et's brother had been always at variance with Richard; and at this juncture Edmund treated him with &s;uch in&s;olence as produced an irreconcilable animo&s;ity between the hou&s;es; though the duke of York at pre&s;ent di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment.</P>

<P>Surienne, an Arragonian, knight of the garter, and governor of Lower Normandy for the king of England, &s;urprized the town of Fougeres, belonging to the duke of Brittany, and plundered the inhabitants. The duke being informed of this outrage, &s;ent an herald to the duke of Somer&s;et, then re&s;iding at Rouen, to demand the re&s;titution of the place and the pillage; and the regent promi&s;ed that he &s;hould receive proper &s;atisfaction. Yet, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to examine the particulars of the affair, that they might be com|municated to the court of England, the duke of Bretagne could not brook the delay, but complained to the king of France of this infraction of the truce$ in which his dominions had been expre&s;ly comprehended. Charles thought this a favourable opportunity to make advantage of Henry's weakne&s;s, and the di&s;contents of the Engli&s;h people, to which he was no &s;tranger. He af|fected to enter warmly into the re&s;entment of the duke, and &s;ent two amba&s;|&s;adors to London to demand reparation for the affront, as well as the payment of &s;ixteen hundred thou&s;and crowns, to indemnify his va&s;&s;al for the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained. The court of England was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at the de|mand of &s;uch an exorbitant &s;um, as well as at the eagerne&s;s with which Charles e&s;pou&s;ed the quarrel of the duke of Bretagne, who had not been com|prehended in the treaty as his ally or va&s;&s;al, but merely as a neutral prince, who had often acted as mediator between the two monarchs. The mini&s;try, however, a&s;&s;ured the amba&s;&s;adors that the king would indemnify the duke, as &s;oon as the particulars of his lo&s;s &s;hould be a&s;certained; and they were given to under&s;tand, that if Charles would &s;end envoys to Louviers, they &s;hould be met by amba&s;&s;adors from England, empowered to &s;ettle all matters in di&s;pute between them and their allies. Conferences were accordingly opened at this place, where the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries ob&s;erved that Fou|geres had been &s;urprized without the con&s;ent or knowledge of the regent; and that the &s;um demanded greatly exceeded the damage which the duke had &s;u&s;|tained. The French amba&s;&s;adors, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the&s;e remon&s;trances, told them in a peremptory manner, that unle&s;s the duke of Bretagne &s;hould receive the &s;atisfaction required, their ma&s;ter would con&s;ider the truce as infringed; &s;o that the conferences were immediately at an end. Charles was &s;o intent upon recommencing ho&s;tilities, while Henry was altogether unprepared for a rupture, that if the court of England had agreed to comply with his demand, he would have found another cau&s;e for rekindling the flames of war; and even made a pretence of their having vio|lated the truce with Scotland, before the death of James, the manner of which we have already related. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;till amu&s;ed the Engli&s;h mini&s;try with negotiations, under the cover of which he prepared for opening the campaign; while Henry's council &s;eemed to &s;leep at the helm, and took not the lea&s;t precaution again&s;t the brewing &s;torm. They did not even re&s;tore the town of Fougeres, or endeavour in any &s;hape to appea&s;e the duke of Brittany, who was &s;o ju&s;tly incen&s;ed. One would be apt to imagine, that Margaret, having no children of her own to engage her intere&s;t and affection in the cau&s;e of the Engli&s;h, co-operated with the de&s;igns of her family in France, and by her negligence favoured the expul&s;ion of her hu&s;band's troops from her na|tive country. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1449.</NOTE> As &s;oon as Charles found him&s;elf in a condition to renew the war, he, in the name of the duke of Bretagne, &s;urprized the ca&s;tle of Couches, and Pont-de l'Arche in Normandy, Gerbay in the Beauvoi&s;is, Cognac and St. Ma$grin in Guienne. The Engli&s;h complained of the violation of the truce; but were given to under&s;tand, the&s;e were acts of repri&s;al on account of Fou|geres. Thus the war recommenced, at a time when the duke of Somer&s;et was a$together unprovided with troops to defend the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; &s;o that the field was left free for Charles to extend his conque&s;ts. His principal aim was to reduce Normandy to his obedience: for which purpo&s;e he had prepared four different armies, one of which he headed in per&s;on; the command of another he be&s;towed upon the count de Dunois, lately created count of Longueville; the duke o$ Alen&ccedil;on conducted the third; and the duke of Brittany commanded the fourth, totally compo&s;ed of his own forces. All the places of Normandy were ill provided with garri&s;ons and ammunition, and the majority of the governors confiding in the truce, had repaired to Eng|land; &s;o that Charles met with very little oppo&s;ition in &s;ubduing the province. Many places &s;urrendered at &s;ight of the French army. In &s;ome towns the in|habitants expelled the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons; others were &s;old by their com|manders. None of them made any re&s;i&s;tance but Pont-audemer, and Chateau|gail$$rd: in a word, before the end of the campaign, Charles was in a con|cition to be&s;iege the capital city of Rouen, which was inve&s;ted on the eighth day of October.</P>

<P>He did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to undertake the &s;iege in form, becau&s;e he knew that the duke of Somer&s;et and the earl of Shrew&s;bury, who commanded the garri&s;on, which did not exceed three thou&s;and men, would not be able to defend the place again&s;t the inhabitants; for he carried on a corre&s;pondence with the town&s;men, and they a&s;&s;ured him that they would take arms in his favour. On the fir&s;t day of the &s;iege, the count of Dunois was on the point of being introduced with three hundred men, when Shrew&s;bury chancing to come up, had the good fortune to repul&s;e the detachment. This mi&s;carriage did not alter the re&s;olution of the inhabitants, who, on the nine|teenth day of October, ro&s;e as one man, and opened the gates to the be|&s;iegers. All that the regent could do, was to &s;tation the garri&s;on at the prin|cipal po&s;ts of the city, from which, however, they were &s;oon di&s;lodged. So|mer&s;et and Shrew&s;bury retreated to the palace with eight hundred men; but, as they fore&s;aw their provi&s;ion would &s;oon fail, the duke demanded a parley with king Charles. This being granted, he offered to retire on honourable con|ditions; but the king in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion, unle&s;s he had a mind to treat for the re&s;t of Normandy that remained in the hands of the Engli&s;h. Thus repul&s;ed, the duke retired to the palace, which he defended twelve days; at the expiration of which he &s;aw him&s;elf obliged to capitulate, on condition of leaving all his artillery, paying fifty thou&s;and crowns of gold, and re&s;toring to the French king Caudebec, Arques, Lillebonne, Tancarville, Montrevil|$$ers, and Har$leur. The earl of &s;hrew&s;bury remained as ho&s;tage for the per|formance of the&s;e articles; and the Engli&s;h garri&s;on marched out of Rouen, which Charles entered in triumph on the nineteenth day of November.

<P>The&s;e di&s;a&s;ters were the more &s;everely felt at the court of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Neverthele&s;s, the queen and the duke of Suffolk hoped to derive &s;ome advantage from that in|&s;urrection. They &s;eized this opportunity of removing the duke of York, on pretence of creating him governor of Ireland, where they thought he would peri&s;h. But he baffled their expectation; and, by his obliging and in&s;inuating manners, not only appea&s;ed the commotion, without drawing his &s;word, but even engaged the people of that country in his intere&s;t, to which they con|tinued firmly attached in the &s;equel. The lo&s;s of Normandy in one campaign, after &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure had been expended in the conque&s;t of that province, together with the rapid progre&s;s of Charles in other pa$ts of France, began to produce a violent fermentation in the impatient humour of the Engli&s;h. The whole kingdom re&s;ounded with complaints again&s;t the duke of Suffolk, who was publicly reproached with having betrayed the $ta$e, and co-operated with the queen in favour of the French monarch. The coun|cil con&s;i&s;ted wholly of their creatures, who likewi&s;e filled all the po&s;ts of dig|nity and profit. The duke of Somer&s;et, who had contracted for the defence of Normandy, was accu&s;ed of having mi&s;applied the money payed for that &s;ervice. A numerous body of men at arms having been rai&s;ed by Humphrey duke of Buckingham, on condition that they &s;hould receive a whole year$s pay in advance; the trea&s;urer refu&s;ed to comply with the terms of the con|tract, and the duke returning to court from the &s;ea-&s;ide, when they were ready to embark, re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, &s;aying publicly to the king, <Q>&startq;Sir, take heed of your government; you are mi&s;led by traitors: and if I had landed in Normandy with your forces, I am per&s;uaded we &s;hould have been &s;old to the enemy.&endq;</Q> Suffolk being pre&s;ent, and &s;uppo&s;ing this decla|ration aimed at him, was &s;o incen&s;ed that he drew a dagger, and would have &s;lain Humphrey, had not the bye&s;tanders interpo&s;ed.

When the parliament met after this adjournment, the duke thinking it was incumbent upon him to vindicate his character in this particular, $arrangued both hou&s;es, in a &s;peec$ containing an enumeration of the &s;ervices of him&s;elf and his family, and a ve$er+me$t pro$e&s;&s;ion of his loyalty; and he concluded with defying all the world to prove him guilty of di&s;loyalty or mi&s;conduct. The commons, far $rom being inti$idated by this declaration, petitioned the crown that Suffolk might be comm$$ed to ward, according to law, until he &s;hould clear him&s;elf of the crime$ charged upon him by common $ame and report. The judges being con&s;ulted o$ t$e $$ture of this petition, were of opinion, that as no &s;pecial matter of &s;lander or i$$amy was dec$ared, he &s;hould not $e committed. The common$, in|$$$med of this d$ci&s;ion, rep$e&s;ented next da$ a &s;p$cial matter of report; namely$ t$$t the realm of England would be &s;old to France; and that preparations were making in that kingdom for an inva&s;ion, by contrivance of the duke of Suffolk, who had fortified Walingford-ca&s;tle, to &s;erve as a place of refuge$ On the &s;eventh day of February, the commons, by their $peaker, impeached Suffolk of divers articles of trea$on, co$tained in a bill delivered to the chan|cellor, i$porting, That he had con&s;ulted with the count of Dunois, Bertrand de Pre$$$gny, and W.

<P>The duke of Suffolk having received a copy of the&s;e articles, was committed to a tower in the royal palace of We&s;tmin&s;ter; from w$$nce being brought before the lords on the thirteenth day of March, to give in his an&s;wer, he kneeled down and declared the eight articles of high trea&s;on to be fal&s;e and malicious. He ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t, relating to Margaret, could not po&s;&s;ibly be true, &s;ince &s;he was not the next heir of the crown by law; and, he appealed to &s;everal lords, to vouch for his de&s;ign of marrying his &s;on to the duke of Warwick's daughter. With re&s;pect to the other articles, he referred to acts of council and parliament for his ju&s;tification; and affirmed, that the bi|&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter had mi&s;repre&s;ented the words &s;poken by him in the St$r|chamber. On the &s;eventeenth day of March, the lords &s;piritual and temporal were a&s;&s;embled in the king's chamber. Suffolk being brought before them, kneeled down; and the chancellor a&s;king, what he had to &s;ay in his own de|fence, he again prote&s;ted he was innocent, affirmed the articles to be fal&s;e, and
<PB N="352" REF="3620">
&s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the king's plea&s;ure. Then the chancellor gave him to under&s;tand, that his maje&s;ty did not hold him convicted on the fir&s;t bill of ar|ticles of high trea&s;on; and, as to the &s;econd, charging him with mi&s;pri&s;ions or mi&s;demeanors, the king, by virtue of his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, out of his own motion, and not by way of judgment, bani&s;hed him the realm for the term of five years, during which, he &s;hould not abide in France, or any country under the French dominion; nor &s;hould he by word, deed, or writing, by him&s;elf, or his adherents, &s;hew malice to the commons in parliament. At the &s;ame time, the lords joined the vi&s;count Beaumont, in a prote&s;t, that this &s;entence was not the re&s;ult of their advice, but, purely the king's own act, which &s;hould not at all dero|gate<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>The death of this nobleman was the prelude to a great many popular commotions. John Ay&s;cough, bi&s;hop of Sarum, was murdered in Wilt&s;hire. Thomas Thany, a fuller, attempted to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection in Kent, but was taken and executed at Canterbury. The whole nation was now in a ferment; and nothing was heard but complaints and menaces again&s;t the queen and mini&s;try. The duke of York, who &s;till remained in Ireland, being by Suffolk's fate freed from a powerful antagoni&s;t, re&s;olved to improve the po|pular di&s;content for his own advantage; but, before he would per&s;onally ap|pear in &s;upport of his preten&s;ions, he thought it would be nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the nation for his de&s;ign, by exciting their affection for the hou&s;e of Mortimer. For this purpo&s;e, $e employed an Iri&s;hman, called John Cade, who had &s;erved under him as a &s;oldier in France, to rai&s;e a &s;edition in England in favour of the family of March, that their title, which had lain dormant &s;o long, might once more attract the attention of the public. Cade, who was a man of un|daunted re&s;olution, great cunning, and &s;ome di&s;cernment, being properly in|&s;tructed by the duke's agents, a&s;&s;umed the name of John Mortimer, pretending to be &s;on of Sir John Mortimer, who had been beheaded for trea&s;on in the la&s;t reign; and, repairing to the county of Kent, in which the duke of York had a great number of parti&s;ans, he a&s;&s;embled a &s;trong body of malecontents, on pretence of reforming the government and ea&s;ing the people of their taxes. The number of his followers increa&s;ed in a few days to &s;uch a degree, that he thought him&s;elf in a condition to execute his &s;cheme; and, approaching London, encamped on Blackheath. The king being informed of this com|motion, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to demand the cau&s;e of their a&s;&s;embling in arms; and, Cade an&s;wered, in the name of the community, that they had no intention to hurt the per&s;on of his maje&s;ty; but, their de&s;ign was to addre&s;s the parliament, that all civil mini&s;ters might be brought to condign puni&s;hment, and the people be allowed to live more happily than they had lived &s;ince the beginning of Suffolk's mini&s;try. They accordingly pre&s;ented two addre&s;&s;es to parliament, ex|plaining the grievances of the nation; and, among other things, demanded that
<PB N="353" REF="3630">
the duke of Somer&s;et &s;hould be puni&s;hed for the lo&s;s of Normandy; and, that the king's council might be compo&s;ed of princes of the blood, and other wi$e and worthy per&s;ons; not by vicious wretches, void of virtue and capacity. The&s;e petitions being communicated to the king, the council deemed them &s;editious; and re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urrection by $orce of arms. Henry, having a&s;&s;embled a body of fifteen thou&s;and men, marched at their head towards Blackheath. At his approach Cade retired, as if he had been afraid of an engagement, and lay in $mbu&s;h in a wood, not doubting but that he &s;hould be pur&s;ued by the king's whole army; but, Henry believing they were totally di&s;per&s;ed, returned towards London, after having &s;ent a detachment in pur&s;uit of the fugitives, under the command of the lord Stra$$ord, who falling into the amb$&s;cade, was cut in pie$es with all his followers. Cade, immediately after this action, began his march to London, while the king and court leaving a garri&s;on in the Tower, commanded by the $ord Sca$es, retired with precipita|tion to the ca&s;tle of Kenilworth. The city of London, intimidated by the &s;ucce&s;s of the in&s;urgents, opened its gates at their approach; and, Cade entered in tri|umph, at the head of his forces, which had been con$iderably increa&s;ed &s;ince his late advantage. But, he forbade his followers, on the mo&s;t &s;evere penalties, to commit the lea&s;t di&s;order, or give any cau&s;e of complaint to the inhabitants. Next day, being informed that the trea&s;urer, lord Say, was in the city, he cau&s;ed him to be apprehended and beheaded, without any form of trial; and, in the evening, retired to the Borough of Southwark. For &s;ome days, he continued the prac|tice of entering the city in the morning, and quitting it at night, that he might not give umbrage to the burghers, with whom he lived at fir&s;t in very good under&s;tanding. But, at length, the in&s;urgents having plundered &s;ome hou&s;es, and committed other outrages, Cade, one morning, found the gate of the bridge &s;hut and &s;ec$red again&s;t him. Endeavouring to force his way, an engagement en$ued between the rebels and citizens, which la&s;ted all day, and was not interrupted until the combatants could &s;ee no longer to fight. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the chancellor, who had taken re$uge in the Tower, being informed by their emi&s;&s;aries of the di&s;po&s;ition of the in&s;urgents, who were di&s;heartened by this check, and heartily tired of rebellion, drew up an act of amne&s;ty, confirmed by the $anction of the great &s;eal, and found means to publi&s;h it by night in the Borough of Southwark. The effect of this expedient was &s;o &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing, that by day-break, Cade &s;aw him&s;elf abandoned by the greater number of his followers, and retreated to Roche&s;ter, where the re&s;t of them di&s;per&s;ed, notwith$tanding all his remon&s;trances and artful &s;peeches, in which he endeavoured to per&s;uade them, that the pardon was ineffectual, with|out the authority of parliament. Thus de&s;erted, Cade was obliged to fly alone into the wolds of Kent; and a price being &s;et upon his head by proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian. Stowe. Grafto$.</NOTE> he was di&s;covered, and &s;lain by Alexander Eden, who for this &s;ervice was re|compenced with the government of Dover ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>While the peace of England was interrupted by this in&s;urrection, the war continued in France; but, &s;till to the di&s;advantage of the Engli&s;h. The queen perceiving, that the di&s;&s;atisfaction of the people proceeded in a great mea&s;ure from the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms in that kingdom, had made an effort to retrieve her credit, by &s;ending a reinforcement of four thou|&s;and men, under the command of Sir Thomas Kyrle, who landed at Cherbourg
<PB N="354" REF="3640">
in Normandy; and proceeded for Caen, where the duke at that time re&s;ided. In his march he was joined by &s;everal &s;mall detachments from Engli&s;h garri|&s;ons in that neighbourhood, and took Valognes, after a &s;iege of three weeks. The con&s;table of Richemont informed of the&s;e operations, a&s;&s;embled a body $f &s;even thou&s;and men, and po&s;ted him&s;elf at Fourmigni, to intercept the Eng|li&s;h in their route. Kyrle, tho' greatly inferior in number, attacked them with|out he&s;itation; but, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, his troops were defeated, and he him&s;elf remained in the hands of the enemy. This reinforcement being de&s;troyed, the duke of Somer&s;et was obliged to keep within the walls of Caen, and &s;ee the French extend their conque&s;ts without oppo&s;ition. The towns of Vere, Bayeux, St. Sauveur le Vicomte, Valognes, Avranches, and Tombe|laine, &s;urrendered almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance; and, upon the &s;eventh day of June, the city of Caen was inve&s;ted. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of four thou&s;and men inured to &s;ervice; but, the duke capitulated to &s;urrender the place, if not relieved by the fir&s;t day of July, on condition, that the garri&s;on &s;hould be at liberty to retire with their effects to England. Falai&s;e being inve&s;ted at the &s;ame time, Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen hundred men, capitulated on the &s;ame conditions; and the reduction of Cherbourg, the garri&s;on of which &s;ubmitted on the twelfth day of Augu&s;t$ fini&s;hed the intire conque&s;t of Normandy. In the month of September, the count de Dunois was &s;ent with a detachment into Guienne, where he reduced Berg$rac, Jen&s;ac, Montferrand, St. Foy, and Chalais, before the end of the campaign. In May he took the field again; and, in the cour&s;e of that month, took Montguyon, Blaye, Bourg, Fron$ac, Libourne, and Ca|&s;tillon in Perigord: and Bourdeaux was &s;urrendered by capitulation, becau&s;e not relieved before Mid&s;ummer. This was the ca&s;e with all the places in that neighbourhood. Dax was reduced by the counts of Foix and Armagnac, the lord of Albret, and other Ga&s;con barons; and Bayonne, which was blocked up by &s;ea and land, &s;ubmitted on the twenty-&s;ixth day of Augu&s;t. Thus, the whole province of Guienne fell under the dominion of Charles, after it had been united three hundred years to the crown of England. The towns were well affected to the Engli&s;h government; but, the great lords, tempted with the hope of preferment at the court of France, co-operated with the efforts of Charles, in wre&s;ting this country from the king of England, who was now di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every foot of land which his ance&s;tors had acquired in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi$$. de Charles VII.</NOTE> except Calais and its dependencies.</P>

<P>When the duke of Somer&s;et returned to England, the parliament was &s;itting; and the outcry again&s;$ him was &s;o loud and univer&s;al, that the commons could not help taking &s;ome notice of his conduct. They accord|ingly pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, de&s;iring, that the regent might be committed to the Tower, until his behaviour in France could be properly ex|amined. Henry did not think proper to refu&s;e the reque&s;t of the commons at &s;uch a juncture; and the populace were &s;o tran&s;ported with joy at the news of the duke's commitment, that they went immediately to his hou&s;e, which they pillaged; and, notwith&s;tanding a proclamation i&s;&s;ued to di&s;per&s;e them, conti|nued in a body, doing abundance of mi&s;chief, until &s;ome o$ their leaders were apprehended, and hanged in terrorem. The commons then petitioned Henry, to remove from his pre&s;ence Edmund duke of Somer&s;et, Alice dutche&s;s dow|ager
<PB N="355" REF="3650">
of Suffolk, William Bothe bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, John Sutton, lord Dudley, and others; but, Henry amu&s;ed them with an equivocal an&s;wer. Then they brought in an act of attainder for corrupting the blood, and confi&s;cating the lands of the late duke of Suffolk; but, this act was rejected by the king, and the humour of the commons growing every day more and more ob&s;tinate, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>The court was now involved in great perplexity and unea&s;ine&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 145$.</NOTE> about the duke of York, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have excited the late in&s;urrection, and to be employed in hatching other more dangerous &s;chemes again&s;t the go|vernment. The &s;udden death of Cade had prevented any confe&s;&s;ion, of which they might have taken the advantage to the prejudice of Richard, whom they could not now arre&s;t without incurring the imputation of inju&s;tice; but, as they were apprehen&s;ive of his rai&s;ing an army in Ireland, to &s;upport his title to the crown, the king i&s;&s;ued orders to the &s;heriffs of Wales, Shrop&s;hire, and Che&s;hire, to a&s;&s;emble, each, his different po&s;&s;e, and oppo&s;e his landing. This was a very impolitic precaution, as it not only publi&s;hed his apprehen&s;ion of the duke of York, which it was his intere&s;t to conceal; but, it alarmed the duke &s;o as to put him on his guard, and furni&s;hed him with a plau&s;ible pretext to take arms in his own defence. As the duke had not yet formed any dige&s;ted project, nor taken the lea&s;t &s;tep that could be con&s;trued into a mi&s;deanour, he wrote a letter to Henry, complaining of his &s;u&s;picion as injurious, and calcu|lated for a pretence to ruin his character and fortune. He received a mild an|&s;wer from the king, who promi&s;ed, that he &s;hould have &s;atisfaction; but in the mean time the orders were not recalled. Tho' Cade's enterprize had not &s;uc|ceeded, the duke of York did not fail to reap con&s;iderable advantages from that in&s;urrection. The great number of people who joined or favoured that cau&s;e, plainly demon&s;trated, that the nation was full of malecontents; and, that the title of the hou&s;e of March was &s;till remembered with regard. He conceived fre&s;h hopes from the&s;e con&s;iderations; believing, that if the very name of a per&s;on belonging to that family had armed &s;uch a number in his cau&s;e, he who was a prince of the blood royal, and the lawful repre&s;entative of Mortimer, could not fail to rai&s;e the better part of the kingdom in &s;upport of his preten|&s;ions. That he might not, however, ruin his project by too much precipitation, he re&s;olved to con&s;ult his friends, before he would engage in an enterprize of &s;uch moment; and, when the term of his government in Ireland was expired, he embarked for England, in order to confer with them upon this &s;ubject. Not|with&s;tanding the vigilance of the &s;heriffs, he landed without oppo&s;ition, and repaired to London, where his adherents waited for him with impatience. The principal of the&s;e were, John Mowbray duke of Norfolk; Richard Nevil earl of Sali&s;bury, in right of his wife, daughter to him who was &s;lain at the &s;iege of Orleans; his &s;on Richard Nevil, afterwards earl of Warwick, by his marriage with Anne Beauchamp, daughter of that earl who died in France; Thomas Courtney, earl of Devon&s;hire, the &s;on-in-law of the duke of Somer&s;et; and Edward Brook, baron of Cobham.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. The court being on a progre&s;s to the we&s;tern counties, the&s;e con|federates had an opportunity of concerting their mea&s;ures without mole&s;tation;
<PB N="356" REF="3660">
and the re&s;ult of their conferences was, that the duke of York &s;hould retire to Wales, where the hou&s;e of March had always great influence, and &s;ecure the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends, in &s;uch manner, that he &s;hould be able to a&s;&s;emble an army at plea&s;ure. The&s;e previous &s;teps being taken, he &s;hould write to the king, informing him of the di&s;contents of the people; and, de&s;iring that ju&s;tice might be done upon the duke of Somer&s;et. According to this re&s;olution, he retired; and having &s;ecured the people of Wales in his intere&s;t, wrote a remon&s;trance to Henry, importing that the whole kingdom was di&s;gu&s;ted at his conduct in countenancing traitors; and, that he could not help taking the l$berty of advi&s;ing him to prevent the fatal con&s;equences of popular di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction. He exhorted him to bring delinquents to ju&s;tice; and in particular, to give up the duke of Somer&s;et, who, tho' accu&s;ed by the hou&s;e of commons, had been &s;et at liberty, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his maje&s;ty's favour, without hav|ing undergone the lea&s;t examination; and, in ca&s;e the king &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to grant that &s;atisfaction to the people, he offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his power in the execution of &s;uch a laudable de&s;ign. The court ea&s;ily perceived, that he wanted no more than a pretence for revolting; and, as they were re|&s;olved, that the odium of a rupture &s;hould not lie with them, the king favoured him with a civil an&s;wer, in which he a&s;&s;ured him, that he had laid down a re|&s;olution to reform the abu&s;es of his government; for which purpo&s;e, he was determined to choo&s;e a certain number of wi$e and virtuous coun&s;ellors, among whom, the duke of York &s;hould be one of the fir&s;t; that no traitor &s;hould be countenanced, or even pa&s;s with impunity; but, the puni&s;hment of &s;uch delinquents being an affair of great con&s;equence, required the mo&s;t ma|ture deliberation: as to the duke of Somer&s;et, in particular, he &s;hould be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stoae$s $$|nals.</NOTE> brought to an&s;wer any accu&s;ations laid to his charge in a legal manner.</P>

Neverthele&s;s, as he had prepared an army, and looked upon this &s;hew of moderation as a lure to decoy him into blind &s;ecurity, he re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute his de&s;ign of removing the duke of Somer&s;et from the council, and proceed or de&s;i$$ as he him&s;elf &s;hould &s;ee it convenient or practicable. He therefore a&s;&s;embled his troops, and began his march for London; but, he did not find the court &s;o unprepared as he had imagined: the queen no &s;ooner under&s;tood that he had retired to Wales, than gue&s;&s;ing his de&s;ign, &s;he began to levy forces in the king's name, without mentioning the &s;ervice for which they were de&s;tined; &s;o that the duke had &s;carce begun his march, when he received intelligence, that the king was ad|vancing at the head of an army to give him battle. Surpri&s;ed at this infor|mation, he did not think proper to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the i&s;&s;ue of an engage|ment, until he &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a better pretext for fighting again&s;t his &s;overeign. He hoped the people would e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, and was very de|&s;irous of engaging the city of London in his intere&s;t, before he &s;hould venture to declare his real de&s;ign. He therefore, in&s;tead of waiting for the king's ap|proach, changed his route; and, by forced marches arrived before him at Lon|don, where he expected to be received with open arms. He had the mortifi|cation, however, to find the gates &s;hut upon him, and the inhabitants deter|mined again&s;t taking any &s;tep in his favour, while the king was at his heels with a more numerous army than that which he commanded. In this emer|gency,
<PB N="357" REF="3670">
gency, he was obliged to pa&s;s the Thames at King&s;ton, and intrench him&s;elf at Brentheath, at the di&s;tance of twelve miles from London. The king follow|ing him by the way of London-bridge, encamped within four miles of him; and &s;ent two bi&s;hops to know the cau&s;e of his appearing in arms again&s;t the government.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The duke, di&s;appointed in one part of his expectations, re&s;olved to temporize, that he might not ruin his affairs by too much precipitation. He replied, that his intention was not to renounce his obedience to the king, but &s;olely to remove from him all the evil coun&s;ellors, of whom the duke of Somer&s;et was the principal; and, that if his maje&s;ty would commit that noble|man to pri&s;on, and detain him in confinement till the meeting of the next par|liament, he would immediately di&s;band his forces. He concluded that his demand would be rejected by the king and queen, as they were intirely governed by the per&s;on again&s;t whom he had remon&s;trated; and he hoped their refu&s;al would be of great &s;ervice to his cau&s;e, in demon&s;trating the queen's re&s;olution to involve the nation in a civil war, rather than part with her minion, who was odious to the whole kingdom. Here again, he was mi&s;taken in his conjec|ture. The king immediately accepted the propo&s;al, a&s;&s;uring him, that Somer|&s;et &s;hould be &s;ent to the Tower; and, that nobleman was immediately put under arre&s;t. The duke of York was not a little &s;urprized at this conde&s;cen|&s;ion, and wi&s;hed he could have revoked his engagement; but, as he could not retract without declaring his real aim too openly, he determined to run &s;ome ri&s;que in his own per&s;on, rather than forfeit the favour of the people, on which his chief hope of &s;ucce&s;s was founded. Without the lea&s;t he&s;itation he di&s;banded his troops; and vi&s;ited the king, tho' unprovided with any &s;ecurity for the &s;afety of his per&s;on. When he was introduced to his maje&s;ty, he accu&s;ed the duke of Somer&s;et as a traitor who had $acrificed the intere&s;t of the kingdom to his avarice and ambition. The duke, who &s;tood concealed in the tent, hearing his character thus impeached, quitted his hiding-place; and not only denied the charge with great warmth, but in his turn, taxed York with a traiterous de&s;ign to dethrone his maje&s;ty. Richard, &s;eeing his antagoni&s;t at liberty in the king's tent, after having been a&s;&s;ured, that he was in confinement, perceived he had been duped; and at once comprehended the danger of his own &s;itua|tion. Neverthele&s;s, without appearing di$concerted, he complained of the deceit which had been practi$ed upon him by the &s;ugge&s;tions of the duke of Somer&s;et, on whom he affected to lay the blame of this double-dealing. The court was at very little pains to excu&s;e the collu&s;ion; and when York took his leave of Henry, and would have retired, he was arre&s;ted by the king's order. If his enemies had followed the impul&s;e of their anim$&s;ity, he never would have extricated him&s;elf from the &s;nare in which he was intangled by his own imprudence: but, &s;everal circum&s;tances concurred towards his pre&s;ervation. The queen and Somer$et dreaded the re&s;entment of the people, among whom he had acquired great influence and favour. The court had received fal&s;e intel|ligence, that his &s;on Edward, the young earl of March, accompanied by all the friends of the family, was at the head of a &s;trong army advancing to the duke's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, at this very juncture, deputies arrived from Ga&s;cony, with offers of renouncing the dominion of France, if the king of England would &s;end a body of troops for their &s;upport. They fore&s;aw, that the death of the
<PB N="358" REF="3680">
d$ke of York wo$ld involve them in a civil war, which, exclu&s;ive of other con&s;equences, would hinder them from &s;ending a &s;upply of forces for the re|covery of Guienne. The&s;e con&s;iderations induced them to &s;et the duke at li|b$rty, tho$gh the &s;afety of them&s;elves and the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter &s;eemed to de|mand the &s;acrifice of his life; but, befor$ his enlargement, they compelled him to take a new oath of allegiance, by which he obliged him&s;elf to remain faith|ful to Henry till death, and promi&s;ed he would never take arms again&s;t him on any pretence what&s;oever; then he was permitted to retire to his e&s;tate of Wig|more, and the duke of Somer&s;et continued to enjoy his influence at court with|out<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ $peed.</NOTE> a rival.</P>

<P>King Henry was not more di&s;turbed by the influence and de&s;igns of York, than Charles of France was perplexed and chagrined with the con|d$ct of the dauphin, who was proud, turbulent, and ambitious. He re&s;ided in Dauphin&eacute;, where he acted as &s;overeign, and payed very little regard to the orders of his father. He had even demanded in marriage Yolante daughter to the duke of Savoy; and that prince had granted his reque&s;t, without deigning to intimate the de&s;ign to king Charles, who was &s;o much incen&s;ed at their pre|&s;umption, that he a&s;&s;embled an army of thirty thou&s;and men, and marched towards Lyons, to cha&s;ti&s;e his &s;on, and puni&s;h the duke of Savoy for this con|tempt of his character and authority: but he was diverted from his purpo&s;e by an unexpected revolution in Guienne. The Ga&s;cons had acknowleged the French dominion for no other rea&s;on than that of being left de&s;titute of re&s;ource by the Engli&s;h; and the army of Charles had no &s;ooner quitted Guienne, than the nobility, in concert with the inhabitants of Bourdeaux, re&s;olved to recal their ancient ma&s;ters. For this purpo&s;e they &s;ent deputies to London; and as &s;oon as the commotions were appea&s;ed, the queen and council deliberated upon their propo&s;als, which they approved. They concluded that the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an enterprize would rai&s;e their credit among the people; and they determined to &s;end over a body of forces, under the command of the renowned Talbot earl of Shrew&s;bury, who had lately returned from a voyage to Italy. Though he was now four&s;core years of age, he engaged in the &s;ervice with his u&s;ual alacrity, and immediately embarked with &s;even hundred men at arms, leaving the re&s;t of the troops de&s;tined for that expedition, to follow with the fir&s;t opportunity. He landed near Bourdeaux on the twenty-fir&s;t day of October; and next day, being introduced into that city by the burghers, &s;urprized and took the greater part of the French garri&s;on. Being joined in a few days by the re&s;t of the troops from England, he took the field at the head of &s;even thou&s;and men, and reduced Fron&s;ac and Ca&s;tillon, together with &s;ome other places, before he was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pere Daniel.</NOTE> obliged to put his troops into winter-quarters.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1453.</NOTE> Charles was at Lyons when he received the di&s;agreeable news of Talbot's arrival and progre&s;s; and immediately altered his re&s;olution with regard to the dauphin, that he might unite all his endeavours for the pre&s;erva|tion of Guienne. He approved of the match between his &s;on and Yolante; and be&s;towed one of his own daughters on the prince of Piedmont. He re&s;olved to &s;end all his forces into Guienne in the &s;pring; and in the mean time detached a body of ten thou&s;and men, under the command of Chabanes and the count de Penthievre, who, arriving in Saintonge, inve&s;ted Chalain and Ca&s;tillon, while the count of Clermont followed with the re&s;t of the army. Chabanes, having
<PB N="359" REF="3690">
reduced Chalain in the beginning of June, joined Penthievre before Ca&s;tillon, which continued to make a vigorous defence; and the dread of Talbot's valour and experience induced them to fortify their camp with lines, pali&s;adoes, and artillery. The earl of Shrew&s;bury remained in the neighbourhood of Bour|deaux with &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men, and wavered in his re&s;olutions. He ar|dently wi&s;hed to relieve the place, but was apprehen&s;ive of finding it impracti|cable, con&s;idering the &s;trength of the French camp, and the &s;uperiority of their number. On the other hand, knowing that the count of Clermont was on his march, he thought there was a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;triking &s;ome de&s;perate blow before the arrival of that general, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould never have an opportunity of acting with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t their united efforts. This con&s;idera|tion determined him to hazard an attack again&s;t the two officers employed in the &s;iege of Ca&s;tillon; and he forthwith began his march for this purpo&s;e. He at once defeated a body of four thou&s;and men, commanded by Chabanes on the out&s;ide of the intrenchments; and, in &s;pite of the cannon of the enemy, which de&s;troyed the Engli&s;h in heaps, he charged the lines with &s;uch amazing impe|tuo&s;ity, that they would certainly have been forced, had not a body of cavalry quitted the intrenchments at a different place, and fallen upon the rear of the Engli&s;h, who now found them&s;elves &s;urrounded on all hands, and expo&s;ed to the fire of a very numerous train of artillery. Shrew&s;bury, though over|whelmed with old age, behaved with all the vigour and activity of youth; and his &s;on the lord L'I&s;le approved him&s;elf worthy of &s;uch a valiant father: but all their efforts proved ineffectual; and the earl, &s;eeing his defeat inevitable, &s;corned to outlive his di&s;grace. He conjured his &s;on to retire while yet there was a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, that he might re&s;erve his courage for the occa&s;ions of his country; but that gallant youth di&s;dained the thoughts of leaving his fa|ther in the power of his enemies, and declared that as they had fought, they &s;hould fall together. They accordingly ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t of the battle; where the earl's hor&s;e being killed by a cannon-ball, he fell to the ground, and as he lay was transfixed by a bayonet, while the lord L'I&s;le lo&s;t his own life, in attempting to &s;ave that of his parent. The Engli&s;h were &s;o di&s;couraged by the fate of this renowned chief, that they betook them&s;elves to flight, leaving twelve hundred of their fellow-&s;oldiers dead on the field of battle; and the lord Molins, with about two hundred officers and &s;oldiers, were taken pri&s;oners. This defeat was attended with the &s;urrender of Ca&s;tillon, and the arrival of the count de Clermont with the re&s;t of the army; then Charles, repairing to the camp, divided his forces into four different bodies, which at the &s;ame time in|ve&s;ted Cadillac, Libourne, Fron&s;ac, and Bourdeaux. All the&s;e places were taken with very little difficulty, except the la&s;t, which held out till the &s;even|teenth day of October, when the garri&s;on capitulated, and were allowed to return to England. Thus the Engli&s;h were again expelled from Guienne; and of all the conque&s;ts made by Edward III. in France, nothing remained but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. de C$ar$ $II.</NOTE> towns of Calais and Gui&s;nes, which Charles was not yet able to reduce.</P>

<P>A parliament had met on the &s;ixth day of March, when the fir&s;t news of Talbot's &s;ucce&s;s arrived in England; and the members were &s;o well plea&s;ed with his conduct, that they granted con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idies for the pro|&s;ecution of the war in Guienne. They voted twenty thou&s;and archers$ leaving the nomination of the officers to the king; but &s;even thou&s;and of the&s;e were
<PB N="360" REF="3700">
a$terwards $emitted, and the $$ole levy &s;u&s;pended, until the king &s;hould be in a condition to go over and h$$d t$$m in per&s;on. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;upplies, the d$ke of Somer$et ob$ained a g$ant of nine thou&s;and three hundred pounds for repa$ring the $ortifications of Calais; and provi&s;$on was made for the promp$ payment of the garri&s;on. Edmund of Hadham and Ja&s;per of Hatfield, &s;ons o$ queen Ca$$erine by Owen Tudor, were declared u$erine brothers of the king; the fir&s;t $$s created earl of Richmond, and the other earl of Pembroke, with right of precedence above all ear$s in council and parliament. In this &s;e&s;&s;ion Tho|mas Yonge, citizen of Bri&s;tol and barri$ter at law, moved in the hou&s;e of com|mons, that, as king Henry had no i&s;&s;ue, the duke of York might be declared heir $pparent of the crown: but he was committed to the Tower for this mo|tion, which was the more un$ea&s;onable as queen Margaret was &s;ome months advanced in her pr$gnancy, and on the thirteenth day of October delivered o$ a &s;on called Edward, who was created prince of Wales and earl of C$$&s;ter. The&s;e $itles were confirmed by this parliament, which, though freq$$n$$$ $r$|rog$ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. P$$l.</NOTE> was not di$$olved till the following year. Mean while $word$ was &s;eized with a violent di&s;temper, which a$$ected his mind as well as his $word$ and &s;erved to confirm reports to the prejudice of the queen's ch$$$$ter. Some people were bold enough to &s;ay that the young prince was not begotten by Henry, who was impotent and infirm; others alledged that the child was al|together &s;uppo&s;ititious: though many people, who were well-wi&s;hers to their country, not only acquitted the queen of all imputation, but conceived happy omens from the birth of this &s;on, who they hoped would attach the mother more warmly than ever to the intere&s;t of England.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The clamour again&s;t the queen and mini&s;try was encouraged by the friends and emi&s;&s;aries of Richard duke of York, who, far from thinking him&s;elf bound by the oath which had been extorted from him during his con|$inement, per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to a&s;&s;ert his preten&s;ions to the crown, with the fir&s;t convenient opportunity: but, as he did not think it would be politic to di$ulge his real de&s;ign, until he &s;hould have &s;ecured a majority in the council, $e re&s;olved to renew his per&s;ecution again&s;t the duke of Somer&s;et, who was either hated or envied by the whole nation: but even this aim he carefully con|cealed at the pre&s;ent juncture. The parliament had been adjourned to Read|ing, and af$erwards to We&s;tmin&s;ter, for the fourteenth day of February, the king having &s;uffered a dangerous relap&s;e. In this interval, the &s;ecret friends of the duke o$ York, who &s;till maintained the appearance of attachment to the court party, in&s;inuated to the queen and Somer&s;et, that, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent ferment of the nation, they had very little rea&s;on to expect the parliament would be agreeable to their views; that while the king enjoyed a good &s;tate of health, the orders i&s;&s;ued in his name were &s;uppo&s;ed to be dictated according to his will and direction; but that, during the prevalence of his di&s;temper, their admini&s;|tration would want the &s;anction of his authority; and in all probability the par|liament, in compliance with the &s;en&s;e of the nation, would appoint a new mi|ni&s;try. In order to prevent this misfortune, they ob&s;erved that it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to admit into the council the duke of York, the earls of Sali&s;bury and Warwick, and &s;ome other popular noblemen, to convince the public that they had no intention to govern by de&s;potic authority. This advice appeared &s;o plau&s;ible, that the queen and her favourite ran headlong into the &s;nare; and
<PB N="361" REF="3710">
tho&s;e noblemen were created members of the council before the meeting of par|liament. They no &s;ooner gained footing in this new &s;tation, than they &s;uper|&s;eded the credit of their adver&s;aries, and even ventured to arre&s;t the duke of Somer&s;et in the queen's chamber. He was immediately committed pri&s;oner to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1454.</NOTE> the Tower; and the parliament was again prorogued to the fifteenth day of March, that the duke of York and his adherents might have time to tamper with the members. Mean while the council expedited a commi&s;&s;ion to the duke, empowering him to hold the &s;e&s;&s;ion as the king's repre&s;entative; and the fir&s;t days of that a&s;&s;embly were &s;pent by the commons in preparing an impeach|ment again&s;t Somer&s;et, for the lo&s;s of Normandy by his mi&s;conduct. On the &s;econd day of April, the great &s;eal was committed to the charge of the earl of Sali&s;bury. Next day the parliament appointed the duke of York protector of the realm, defender of the church, and fir&s;t coun&s;ellor of the king, during the $inority of Edward prince of Wales. York, being thus inve&s;ted with the whole power of the admini&s;tration, deprived his rival of the government of Calai$$ which he him&s;elf a&s;&s;umed by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion in the name of $word$ and every body believed that the impeachment of Somer&s;et would b$ carried on with equal vigour and di&s;patch: but it dragged on to the end of the year, and was delayed, in all probability, for want of &s;ufficient evidence. In the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parliam.</NOTE> beginning of the next year, the king recovering from his tedious di&s;temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1455.</NOTE> the authority which had been ve&s;ted in the duke of York cea&s;ed of cour&s;e; and he did not as yet think his affairs ripe enough to di&s;pute his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure. The admini&s;tration therefore returned into its former channel; and the duke of Somer&s;et was di&s;charged from his confinement.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="40" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XL.</HEAD>
<P>As he had been committed by a &s;imple order of council, he might have been enlarged by the &s;ame authority, had not the impeachment of the commons intervened, &s;o that he was obliged to find &s;ecurity; and the duke of Buckingham, with the earl of Wilt&s;hire and two knights, became his &s;ureties; though they were afterwards di&s;charged from their obligation, by a &s;tretch of prerogative contrary to the laws of the kingdom. The duke of York and his parti&s;ans now lo&s;t all their influence in the council, which reverted to the queen and Somer&s;et, by virtue of the king's recovery. Some noblemen, dreading the fatal con&s;equences of an open rupture between the dukes of York and Somer&s;et, interpo&s;ed their good offices towards an accommodation. As it was the in|tere&s;t of both to keep terms with the public, they agreed to refer their di&s;pute to arbitration, and bound them&s;elves to &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ion of the arbiters, in the penalty of twenty thou&s;and marks, provided the &s;entence &s;hould be pro|nounced by the twentieth day of June. While this affair was depending, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pu$$</NOTE> duke of Somer&s;et repre&s;ented to the king, that, as he had been deprived of the government of Calais on a &s;imple accu&s;ation, the particulars of which had never been proved, it was not ju&s;t that his adver&s;ary &s;hould continue po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his &s;poils, before the difference between them &s;hould be determined. The king, upon this remon&s;trance, dive&s;ted the duke of York of this command, though his commi&s;&s;ion had been made out for the term of &s;even years; and, on pre|tence of ob&s;erving a perfect neutrality between the two competitors, declared him&s;elf governor of Calais.</P>

<P>This tran&s;action gave &s;uch umbrage to York, that he retired from court, where he had nothing to expect but di&s;grace and oppo&s;ition from the
<PB N="362" REF="3720">
queen and Somer&s;et, whom he re&s;olved to attack in a more effectual manner than that of political intrigues. The relea&s;e of his rival from the Tower, &s;o co$$rary to law and the inclinations of the people, was a pretext which he hoped would engage the public in his intere&s;t; and this he u&s;ed with all the &s;uc|ce$s he could have expected. He repaired to Wales, where he levied a body o$ $orces, and in a little time found him&s;elf at the head of a numerous army$ with which he advanced towards the king, who had a&s;&s;embled his troop$, and marched out of London to give him $word$ The duke of York was accom|panied by the ea$ls of Sali&s;bury and W$$wick.

<P>York and his a&s;&s;ociates renewed their reque&s;t, when they arrived on the twenty-&s;econd day of May in the neighbourhood of St. Alban's, but it was rejected with di&s;dain; and they were threatened with the penalties of high trea&s;on. The earl of Warwick, who commanded the van-guard, was &s;o ex|a&s;perated at this contemptuous treatment, that, without waiting for the duke's directions, he attacked the king's army &s;o furiou&s;ly, that it was &s;oon thrown into confu&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of Somer&s;et. York, advancing in the mean time, charged them with equal impetuo&s;ity in flank; &s;o that they were totally routed with the lo&s;s of five thou&s;and men. The duke of Somer|&s;et, the earl of Northumberland, the earl of Str$fford, elde&s;t &s;on of the duke of Buckingham, the lord Clifford, and &s;everal officers of di&s;tinction, were &s;lain upon the &s;pot. The duke of Buckingham being wounded, retired from battle in the beginning of the engagement; and his retreat increa&s;ed the di&s;order of the royali&s;ts. The king him&s;elf, having received an arrow in his neck, was abandoned by his army, and retired into a little hou&s;e, where he was imme|diately inve&s;ted. But the duke of York and his confederates were no &s;ooner in|formed of his &s;ituation, than they ran thither, and falling on their knees before him, declared that the enemy of the public being now dead, they were entirely devoted to his &s;ervice, and ready to obey his commands. The violence of Henry's fear was in &s;ome mea&s;ure allayed by this declaration; and he begged, in the name of God, that they would put an end to the carnage. The duke immediately ordered a retreat to be &s;ounded, and proclamation to be made for preventing the further effu&s;ion of blood. Then they conducted Henry to St.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$$we.</NOTE> Alban's, from whence they accompanied him to London.</P>

<P>At their de&s;ire writs were i&s;&s;ued for calling a parliament, which met on the ninth day of July, when Henry declared from the throne, that he looked upon York, Sali&s;bury, and Warwick, as his faithful lieges; and their late conduct was ju&s;tified by the authority of both hou&s;es. They decreed, that the nation had been mi&s;governed by the queen and the duke of Somer&s;et, who had abu&s;ed the goodne&s;s and confidence of his maje&s;ty; that the late duke of Glou|ce&s;ter
<PB N="363" REF="3730">

The king was p$$i|tioned to nominate a protector, becau&s;e his own indi$po&s;$$ion hindered him $rom managing the affairs of the public; and this addre&s;s was &s;eve$$l times r$peated, without their receiving any an&s;wer from He$ry. At length the parliament was pro$ogued till the twelfth day of November; and by th$t time the king had &s;igned a patent, expre&s;&s;ing that, having been freque$tly intreated by b$th hou&s;es to appoint a protector, he had pitched upon the d$$e of York for th$t important office, $$til he &s;hould be di&s;ch$rged of it by p$rliament, or the yo$$g prince of Wales attain to the years of di&s;cretion. This &s;e$$ion l$$$$d a month, and then the parliament was prorogued till the fourteenth day of January.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

Henry the new duke of So|mer&s;et, &s;on of him who fell at St. Alban's, glowed with imp$ti$nce to revenge the death of his father; the duke of Buckingham breathed nothing but vengeance for the lo&s;s of his &s;on, who peri&s;hed on the &s;ame occa&s;ion; and all the princes and noblemen, allied or attached to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, perceiv|ing the duke of York taking long &s;trides towards the throne, re&s;olved to exert all their endeavours to &s;top his progre&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding this oppo&s;ition, he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1456.</NOTE> lived in &s;uch &s;eeming &s;ecurity as a&s;toni&s;hed his enemies. He thought he &s;hould run too great a ri&s;k in pretending openly to the crown, which had re|mained &s;ix and fifty years in the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter; and therefore he waited for &s;ome favourable opportunity to broach his preten&s;ions.

<P>The king having recovered his health, the enemies of the duke re&s;olved to &s;eize t$is opportunity to deprive him of his protector&s;hip. The parliament re-a&s;&s;embling, Henry appeared in per&s;on, and declared from the throne, that as he now enjoyed perfect health, and was in a condition to re|&s;ume the reins of government, he did not think the kingdom had any further occa&s;ion for a protector: he therefore de&s;ired the parliament would di&s;charge the duke of York from the toils of that trouble&s;ome office. Whether the two hou&s;es thought the reque&s;t rea&s;onable, or the members had been tutored for the purpo&s;e, they readily complied with his de&s;ire; and he &s;ent an order to the duke to ab&s;tain from the function of protector. York was not a little confounded at finding him&s;elf thus over-reached; but, making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, he and his adherents &s;ubmitted with a good grace to the orders of the king and parliament. But, on pretence of their having no further bu&s;i|ne&s;s at court, they retired to York&s;hire, where they lived in the &s;ame neigh|bourhood.
<PB N="364" REF="3740">
In a little time after they had withdrawn them&s;elves, an in&s;ur|rection happened in London, occa&s;ioned by a quarrel between an Engli&s;h and Italian merchant; and the duke of Buckingham and Exeter, being empowered to try and puni&s;h the delinquents, were prevented by the populace from exe|cuting their commi&s;&s;ion. The queen &s;u&s;pecting that this tumult was excited by the parti&s;ans of the duke of York, and thinking the king's per&s;on wa$ not &s;$fe in London, conveyed him to Coventry, on pretence of his enjoying the benefit of a change of air; though her real de&s;ign in taking this route, was that &s;he might be nearer the di&s;contented lords, who had retired from the council. She had received intelligence of their holding &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive meetings in the north; and &s;he re&s;olved to arre&s;t them, if po&s;&s;ible, in Co|ventry, where they had fewer friends than in London. With this view &s;he cau&s;ed the king to write letters with his own hand, inviting them to court, where he had occa&s;ion for their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in an affair of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence. As the duke of York and his a&s;&s;ociates had taken n$ &s;tep towards publi&s;hing his de&s;ign upon the crown, but covered all their con|duct with the pretext of patrioti&s;m, they re&s;olved to comply with the invita|tion of Henry, who they imagined had at length opened his eyes with re&s;pect to the conduct of the queen and the mini&s;try, and really de&s;ired their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order to reform the admini&s;tration. They therefore &s;et out for Coventry; but being apprized on the road of the queen's intentions, they &s;uddenly changed their re&s;olution, and &s;eparated immediately, in order to provide for their own &s;afety. The duke of York ha$tened to his e&s;tate of Wigmore, on the borders of Wales; the earl of Sali&s;bury retired to his own hou&s;e in York&s;hire; and Warwick took &s;hipping immediately for Calais, of which place he had continued governor &s;ince the battle of St. Alban's. Tho' the queen was mortified at her di&s;appointment, &s;he enjoyed the con&s;olation of having parted three noblemen who&s;e union was very dangerous to her<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$owe.</NOTE> intere&s;t.</P>

<P>The mutual jealou&s;y and machinations of the two parties were at this period interrupted by other con&s;iderations. As the Engli&s;h had for|merly taken advantage of the divi&s;ions in France, to make conque&s;ts in that kingdom, Charles VII. re&s;olved to follow the &s;ame maxims of policy, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1457.</NOTE> profit by the quarrels that began to divide England. He prepared two &s;qua|drons to attack the kingdom in different parts. One of the&s;e pillaged the town of Sandwich, and the other made a de&s;cent upon Cornwal: but, as they were very ill provided with nece&s;&s;aries, they did not undertake any en|terprize of importance, and this was rather an in&s;ult than an inva&s;ion; for their troops reimbarked and returned to their own country, after having plun|dered a few incon&s;iderable villages. In all probability the French court had engaged the Scots to co-operate with its mea&s;ures again&s;t England, as they invaded the northern counties, notwith&s;tanding the truce &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two nations, and carried off a con&s;iderable booty. The truces were &s;o ill ob&s;erved on both &s;ides, that a predatory war was generally carried on without intermi&s;&s;ion between the borderers; and the mutual incu$&s;ions of private adventurers furni&s;hed continual pretences for infringing the truce or accom|modation. The Engli&s;h authors alledge that this inva&s;ion was headed by king James in per&s;on, who retired at the approach of the earl of Northumberland;
<PB N="365" REF="3750">
whereas the Scotti&s;h hi&s;torians affirm that Piercy, and the earl of Douglas, at that time a refugee in England, entered Scotland and ravaged the country, until they were encountered and defeated by the earl of Angus and Sir James Hamilton: be that as it will, the truce between the two kingdoms was renewed, and afterwards prolonged for four years, though both kings had been greatly in|cen&s;ed, and written outrageous letters to each other. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>This di&s;pute being happily terminated, Henry, who was of a mild, pacific di&s;po&s;ition, and dreaded nothing &s;o much as the revival of do|me&s;tic troubles, pre&s;&s;ed his queen to li&s;ten to terms of accommodation, to which &s;he did not appear aver&s;e; nor indeed was it her intere&s;t to pro&s;ecute a quarrel with &s;uch powerful antagoni&s;ts, at a juncture when her admini&s;tration was &s;o odious to the people. On the other hand, York and his confederates did not think their &s;cheme ripe for an open revolt again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed king, who, though a prince of mean capacity, had, by the innocence of his life, and the piety of his devotion, acquired, if not the e&s;teem, at lea&s;t the good will of his &s;ubjects. They, therefore, lent a willing ear to the overtures of peace and reconciliation, which were made in the king's name, by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and other prelates; and both parties agreed to meet at London<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1458.</NOTE> in January, that all di&s;putes might be agreeably determined. Not but that the queen and York mutually di&s;tru&s;ted each other's &s;incerity; and, upon the duke's &s;ignifying his &s;u&s;picion, the king con&s;ented to his coming with his friends in a po&s;ture of defence. Sali&s;bury arrived at the time and place ap|pointed, with a retinue of five hundred men; York repaired to the congre&s;s with four hundred followers, and took up his quarters at Baynard's ca&s;tle, while Sali&s;bury re&s;ided at Cold-harbour; on the fourteenth day of February, Warwick landed from Calais with &s;ix hundred men, and cho&s;e the Grey|friars for the place of his re&s;idence; the re&s;t of the party lodged within the city. Somer&s;et, Exeter, Northumberland, Egremond, and Clifford, came with nume|rous retinues, who were quartered in the &s;uburbs; and the mayor of London, at the head of five thou&s;and men, kept guard within the city, and patroled through the &s;treets, to maintain the public tranquillity. The conferences were begun; and, after &s;ome di&s;pute, the warmth of which was moderated by the mediat|ing bi&s;hops, the treaty was concluded to their mutual &s;atisfaction. Some ma&s;&s;es were founded for the &s;ouls of the people killed at St. Alban's, and a pecuniary &s;atisfaction made to their heirs: both parties &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to lay a&s;ide their animo&s;ity, and live together in perfect friend&s;hip for the future; and the duke of York with his a&s;&s;ociates were re-admitted into the council. The fifth day of April was appointed for a thank&s;giving, and a &s;olemn pro|ce&s;&s;ion to St. Paul's church. The king, queen, and all the noblemen, a&s;&s;i&s;ted on this occa&s;ion: tho&s;e of different parties walked hand in hand, in token of amity, and the duke of York handed the queen, who affected to treat him with public marks of e&s;teem and confidence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.

<P>Neverthele&s;s, there was little &s;incerity on either &s;ide. The duke of York and his friends &s;till dreaded &s;ome deceit or perfidy on the part of Margaret, who had formerly endeavoured to entrap them; and they quit|ted the court on various pretences. The duke and the earl of Sali&s;bury re|paired to York, and the earl of Warwick returned to his government of Ca|lais. In his pa&s;&s;age he fell in with &s;ome &s;hips belonging to Genoa and Lubec,

and a quarrel en$uing$ in con&s;equence of their r$$u&s;ing $o pay proper de$e|rence to the Engli&s;h flag, $e &s;unk &s;ome of the number, and carried the re&s;t into Calais. The republics complained to the king of this outrage; his ma|je&s;ty appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to enquire into the particulars, and Warwick was obliged to come over and ju&s;tify his conduct. During his &s;tay at Lon|don on this account, he occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ted at council; and a dome&s;tic be|longing to his train happening to quarrel one day with a &s;ervant of the $$ng, who was wounded in the fray, all the retainers at court took to their arms, to revenge the in&s;ult offered to their companion. The delinquent having made his e&s;cape, they attacked the earl him&s;elf as he came from council; &s;o that it was not without the greate&s;t difficulty that he reached his boat, which waited for him on the &s;ide of the river, and which conveyed him to the city, after he had &s;een &s;ome of his followers killed in his defence. He forthwith conjectured that the queen had contrived this &s;cheme for his de|&s;truction; and this conjecture was confirmed that &s;ame day, when he under|&s;tood that the king had granted a warrant to commit him pri&s;oner to the Tower. He received this intelligence in time enough to elude the order; and retired to his father the earl of Sali&s;bury, to con&s;ult about mea&s;ures to be taken again&s;t the queen, upon who&s;e promi&s;es, oaths, and engagements, they would place no dependance. The father and &s;on agreed in opinion, that this la&s;t at|tack was a &s;nare laid by Margaret for the life of Warwick; and that as this nobleman was the idol of the &s;oldiery, they &s;hould make it a pretence for decla|ring open war again&s;t the queen and her adherents. In the&s;e &s;entiments they vi&s;ited the duke of York, who adopted their ideas on this &s;ubject; and they concerted their mea&s;ures accordingly. Warwick returned immediately to Calais, in order to &s;ecure that fortre&s;s, while York began to levy forces in Wales, while Sali&s;bury a&s;&s;embled five or &s;ix thou&s;and men, with which he in|tended to advance to London, and demand &s;atisfaction for the outrage com|mitted again&s;t his &s;on Warwick.</P>

<P>Mean while Margaret &s;et out with the king on a progre&s;s into the counties of Warwick, Stafford, and Che&s;ter, in order to conciliate the affections of the people; and, by means of her artful behaviour and a&s;&s;umed affability, formed a &s;trong a&s;&s;ociation in behalf of her&s;elf and her &s;on Edward. Under|&s;tanding that the earl of Sali&s;bury had rai&s;ed a body of forces, and was on his march to join the duke of York in Here$ord&s;hire, &s;he granted a commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He accordingly levied ten thou&s;and men, with whom he advanced again&s;t Sali&s;bury, who had proceeded as far as Bloreheath on the borders of S$$$$ord&s;hire and Shrop&s;hire. Here the two armies came in &s;ight of each other; and the earl, though his forces were not above half the number of the enemy, re&s;olved to give them battle. They were parted by a rivulet; and on the twenty third day of September, Sali&s;bury made a feint of retreating, as if he had been afraid of an attack. Audley, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, pa&s;&s;ed the rivulet with great precipitation$ in order to pur&s;ue the fugitives; and when part of his troops had cro$$ed the brook, the earl, wheeling about all of a &s;udden, fell upon them with &s;uch impetuo$$ty, before they could form, that, after an ob&s;tinate engage|ment, which la&s;ted five hours, the royali&s;ts were utterly defeated with the lo&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of their general and four and twenty hundred men, &s;lain upon the field of battle.</P>

<P>Sali&s;bury, having thus opened his pa&s;&s;age, marched into Wales, where he joined the duke of York, who was employed in rai&s;ing an army for the pro|&s;ecution of his de&s;ign. The queen, in order to repair the damage &s;he had &s;u&s;tained at Blor$heath, and oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the malecontents, with who&s;e motions &s;he was perfectly well acquainted, exerted her endeavours with incredible activity, in a&s;&s;embling forces, and appointed the rendezvous at Coventry: while her enemies wrote to Warwick, de&s;iring he would join them with &s;ome troops from Calais. On the receipt of his father's letter, he lo&s;t that fortre&s;s under the command of his uncle the lord Faloonbridge, and brought over part of the garri&s;on, commanded by Sir Andrew Trollop, an officer of great reputation. The king's army being a&s;&s;embled, he began his march from Coventry towards Ludlow, where the rebels were encamped; and, halting at Glouce&s;ter, offered a pardon to the in&s;urgents, provided they could lay down their arms. To this offer they replied, That they would not confide in &s;uch promi&s;es, which were no other than &s;nares laid for their de&s;truction; but that they were ready to &s;ubmit to the king, provided he could find any &s;ecurity for the performance of his promi&s;e. Henry, having received this an&s;wer, &s;uper|&s;eded the earl of Warwick in the government of Calais, which he be&s;towed upon the duke of Somer&s;et, and advanced to give battle to the malecontents. They wrote a letter to him, declaring that their &s;ole view in taking up arms, was to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the attempts of their enemies; that they had no intention to fight, unle&s;s forced to an engagement; that all they required, was a reformation of the abu&s;es which had crept into the government, through the mi&s;conduct of the mini&s;try; and they be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to look upon them as his faithful &s;ubjects, who had no de&s;ign to the prejudice of his per&s;on, and wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to be rein&s;tated in his favour. The queen, imputing all this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to fear, approached within half a mile of them in the evening, re&s;olved to give battle next day, and in the mean time di&s;per&s;ed through the enemy's camp a proclamation, promi&s;ing pardon to all tho&s;e who &s;hould lay down their arms and &s;ubmit. This expedient produced a &s;urpri&s;ing effect: the troops of the duke of York, &s;uppo&s;ing, from the king's making &s;uch an offer, that he had a great &s;uperiority of &s;trength, and that there was no time to be lo&s;t, began to di&s;per&s;e in&s;tantaneou&s;ly. Sir Andrew Trollop, who now for the fir&s;t time perceived that the duke of York had a de&s;ign upon the crown, de&s;erted in the night, with the detachment he commanded; and his example was followed by &s;uch a number, that the lords, fearing they &s;hould be wholly abandoned, before day-break con&s;ulted their &s;afety in flight. The duke of York, with his &s;econd &s;on the earl of Rutland, retired to Wales, where they embarked for Ireland; and the earl of Warwick ha&s;tened over to Calais, whither he was &s;oon followed by his father Sali&s;bury, and York's elde&s;t &s;on, the earl of March, at that time in the nineteenth year of his age. The officers and &s;oldiers, who remained after the retreat of their chiefs, &s;ubmitted to the mercy of the king, who di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them in peace, after having cau&s;ed &s;ome of them to be put to death for example.</P>

As &s;oon as the &s;e&s;&s;ion broke

up, the duke of Somer&s;et embarked with a body of troops in order to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Calais; but he met with &s;uch a reception as obliged him to land in another place, from which he marched to Gui&s;nes, and there he &s;ent out de|tachments to &s;kirmi&s;h with the garri&s;on of Calais, by whom his men were generally repul&s;ed to their quarters. Warwick was &s;o beloved by the nation in general, that when Somer&s;et landed with his troops, the &s;ailors &s;teered their &s;hips directly into the harbour of Calais. The queen being determined to wre&s;t the government of this fortre&s;s from the hands of her enemies, equipped a fleet for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Somer&s;et, and ordered a con&s;iderable body of troops to be put on board, under the command of the lord Rivers, and his &s;on Sir Anthony Wideville. While the fleet lay in the harbour of Sandwich, waiting for a fair wind, the earl of Warwick, having received intelligence of their de|&s;tination, manned the &s;hips which had lately de&s;erted to him, and embarking &s;ome troops, with Sir John Denham, they failed to Sandwich, where they &s;urprized Rivers and all his officers, who were conveyed to Calais, together<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> with their &s;hips; the &s;ailors them&s;elves favouring the enterprize. Warwick, being thus reinforced with &s;hipping, &s;ailed for Ireland, in order to con&s;ult the duke of York about the mea&s;ures to be taken for another in&s;urrection in Eng|land, where the people e&s;pou&s;ed their cau&s;e, and their friends expected them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The duke agreed with him in opinion that the lords at Calais &s;hould make a de&s;cent among their adherents and well-wi&s;hers in the county of Kent, and proceed directly to the capital, which they did not doubt would receive them with open arms. The earl of Warwick, in his return to Calais, fell in with the Engli&s;h fleet, commanded by the duke of Exeter, who had lately &s;uper&s;eded him in the po&s;t of admiral, and been &s;ent out to intercept him in his pa&s;&s;age: but the &s;ailors and &s;oldiers on board of the duke's &s;qua|dron, refu&s;ing to fight again&s;t their old commander, he, in order to prevent a total revolt, &s;ailed into Dartmouth, where the greater part of his men de&s;erted for want of pay and provi&s;ion.</P>

<P>The queen and the mini&s;try did not doubt but the interview be|tween the duke of York and the earl of Warwick would produce a new rebellion, which in order to weaken by anticipation, the council re&s;olved to &s;et on foot an exact inqui&s;ition in all the towns and counties of the kingdom, for the di&s;|covery and puni&s;hment of all the parti&s;ans of the malecontents; the earl of Wilt&s;hire and the lord Scales were ve&s;ted with a commi&s;&s;ion to make this in|quiry, and puni&s;h all tho&s;e who had carried arms for York and his adherents in the late rebellion; and they began to execute their powers with great &s;everity in &s;ome towns that openly favoured the lords of the oppo&s;ition. Of all the coun|ties in England Kent had the greate&s;t cau&s;e to dread the re&s;entment of the court, for it had always expre&s;&s;ed a particular attachment to the duke of York; and the conduct of the inhabitants under Cade was not forgotten: believing therefore that their ruin was inevitable, if not prevented by &s;ome vigorous re&s;olution, they &s;ent an intimation to the lords at Calais, a&s;&s;uring them, that if they would land in Kent, the inhabitants would receive them with open arms, and hazard their lives and fortunes in their &s;ervice. Sir Simon Montford had been detached by Mar|garet with a body of fre&s;h forces to guard Sandwich and other harbours that lay neare&s;t the enemy; and &s;hips had been equipped for convoying the duke of Somer&s;et to England, where his pre&s;ence was thought nece&s;&s;ary by the council.
<PB N="369" REF="3790">
But Warwick &s;urprized this armament, pillaged the town of Sandwich, took Montfort, and carried the &s;hips to Calais. It was during this &s;hort expedition, that he became acquainted with the &s;tate of affairs in England; the knowledge of which, together with the invitation of the Kenti&s;h men, determined him and his a&s;&s;ociates to land without delay. Nothing was wanting but a &s;um of money to purcha&s;e nece&s;&s;aries; and the earl of Warwick borrowed on his own credit eighteen thou&s;and pounds from the merchants of the &s;taple. Thus &s;up|plied, he began to make preparations, and in the mean time &s;ent over his uncle, the lord Falconbridge, to Kent; where he was joined by a great number of people belonging to that and the adjacent counties. He was &s;oon followed by Warwick him&s;elf, with the earls of March and Sali&s;bury, who landed at Sandwich, where they were met by Thomas Bourchier, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, the lord Cobham, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. Before they &s;et &s;ail from Calais, they had di&s;per&s;ed a manife&s;to in England, a&s;&s;uring the nation that their &s;ole motive for taking arms, was to deliver the people from the op|pre&s;&s;ion under which they groaned, and to &s;ecure their liberties and privileges; towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of which they &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all true|hearted Engli&s;hmen. They had informed the duke of York of their intended operations, and the day on which they &s;et &s;ail for England. They brought over about fifteen hundred men, who being reinforced by four thou&s;and, under the lord Cobham, they began their march towards London; and &s;uch numbers joined them in their route, that they entered the city in triumph with an army of forty<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

As &s;oon as the young earl of March under|&s;tood that &s;he was advancing towards London, he left the earl of Sali&s;bury with good part of his troops in that capital, and marched out with the earl of Warwick, at the head of five and twenty thou&s;and men, to attack her before her army &s;hould be increa&s;ed. The two parties met in the neighbourhood of Northampton; after the queen had pa&s;&s;ed a river by which they were divided. Before they proceeded to battle, the a&s;&s;ociated lords &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury to the king, with a me&s;&s;age, intreating his maje&s;ty would &s;u&s;pend his indignation, and join with them in &s;ome &s;alutary mea&s;ures to prevent the effu&s;ion of Engli&s;h blood. This addre&s;s was looked upon as a meer ceremony to &s;ave appearances; and being rejected as &s;uch, both &s;ides prepared for an engagement. On the nineteenth day of July the malecontents drew up their army in order of battle; the earl of Warwick commanded the right wing; the lord Cobham conducted the left; and the earl of March took his &s;tation in the center. The royal army was commanded by the dukes of Somer&s;et and Buckingham; the queen remained at a little di&s;tance, from whence &s;he could
<PB N="370" REF="3800">
ob&s;erve the particulars of the action, and give her directions according to the emergency of the occa&s;ion; and Henry &s;tayed in his tent, waiting the event of a battle on which the fate of his crown depended. The Yorki&s;ts, having publi&s;hed orders through their army to re&s;pect the king's per&s;on, and &s;pare the common &s;ol|diers, but to give no quarter to the officers, proceeded to the attack about two o$clock in the afternoon; and the action beginning with equal fury on both &s;ides, continued till &s;even in the evening; when the lord Grey of Ruthwin, who commanded a con$iderable part of Henry's army, &s;uddenly revolted to the reb$$s. This unexpected de$ection threw the re$t of the king$s forces into &s;uch con&s;ternation, that they $orthwith began to give ground, and were routed with great &s;laughter. The duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shrew&s;bury, &s;on o$ the famous Talbot, the lord Beaumont, and many other per&s;ons of di|&s;tinction, were killed upon the &s;pot. The queen, the prince of Wales, and the duke of Somer&s;et, $$ed with &s;uch precipitation, that they did not halt un|til they had reached Durham. Henry fell into the hands of the victors, who tre$$ed him with all the exterior re&s;pect due to their &s;overeign; and this defe|rence, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, con&s;oled him for the mi&s;chance of the day, which would have rendered him a very great object of compa&s;&s;ion, had not his natural indolence and want of &s;en&s;ibility fortified him again&s;t all the vici$$itudes of fortune. He was immediately conducted to Northampton, with all the marks of honour and regard; and, after a &s;hort &s;tay in that place, repaired to London, &s;urrounded by a crowd of noblemen and others, who had &s;o lately appeared again&s;t him in the field of battle. Mean time the queen, who did<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer. Sto$e.</NOTE> not think her&s;elf &s;afe at Durham, retired privately to Wales, in order to $lude the &s;earch of her enemies; but &s;he &s;oon quitted that retreat, and with her &s;on took refuge in Scotland. Immediately after his arrival in London, the Tower &s;urrendered for want of provi&s;ions; and the lord Scales, who acted as gover|nor, attempting to go by water in di&s;gui&s;e to the &s;anctuary at We&s;tmin&s;ter, was di&s;covered and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the watermen. A commi&s;&s;ion was granted to the earl of Sali&s;bury, impowering him to march with an army to the relief of Roxburgh ca&s;tle, be&s;ieged by James II. of Scotland, who infringed the tr$ce that he might take advantage of the inte&s;tine troubles of England. The garri&s;on was already reduced to extremity, when that prince happened to lo&s;e his life by a cannon's bur&s;ting in the explo&s;ion: neverthele&s;s, the queen con|tinued the $iege, and the place was obliged to capitulate. The earl of War|wick was confirmed in the government of Calais and Gui&s;nes, by virtue of a new commi&s;&s;ion; and the duke of York and his adherents were declared good and faithful &s;ubjects. At this period died Charles VII. king of France, who is &s;aid to have &s;tarved him&s;elf to death from apprehen&s;ion of being poi&s;oned by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co$$$. $word$.</NOTE> the d$uphin, who &s;ucceeded him under the name of Lewis XI.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting at We&s;tm$n&s;ter on the &s;eventh day of October, according to the writs which had been i&s;&s;ued before the battle of Northampton, the king a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on; and, the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s on which they proceeded, was a repeal of the tran&s;actions of the la&s;t parliament held at Coventry, on pretence of its having been unduly &s;ummoned, and con&s;tituted of unqualified per&s;ons, who aimed at the de$truction of the realm. The duke of York having been ap|prized of his &s;on's &s;ucce&s;s, returned immediately from Ireland; and, arriving $t London on the third day of the &s;e$$ion, went directly to the hou&s;e of lords,
<PB N="371" REF="3810">
who were then &s;itting. He &s;tood for &s;ome time under the canopy with his hand upon the throne, waiting until he &s;hould be de&s;ired to a&s;cend: but, the whole a&s;&s;embly maintained a profound &s;ilence; and, the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury advancing to him, a&s;ked, if he had waited upon the king &s;ince his arrival. He could not help blu&s;hing at this que&s;tion; and after &s;ome pau&s;e, replied, that he did not know any per&s;on to whom he owed that re&s;pect. So &s;aying, he retired to his own hou&s;e; and next day &s;ent a writing to the parliament, containing the rea&s;ons upon which his preten&s;ions to the crown were founded. He pretended to mount the throne as heir to the hou&s;e of March; de&s;ired, that he might be heard by his coun&s;el; and, that the parliament would do him ju&s;tice. It was not without &s;ome difficulty that the lords allowed his claim to be read in the hou&s;e; but, they re&s;olved to proceed no farther, without com|municating the affair to his maje&s;ty. When Henry was informed of their re|&s;olution, he de&s;ired, that the claim might be con&s;idered by his judges, &s;erjeants, and attorney. The&s;e being &s;ummoned, declined giving their opinions in a matter &s;o far above their cognizance. Then the lords, after another debate, ordered the &s;erjeants and attorney to come and defend the king's title: it was likewi&s;e re&s;olved, that there &s;hould be an entire freedom of debate; and, that no lord &s;hould be called in que&s;tion for what he &s;hould &s;ay in &s;upport of his own opinion.</P>

<P>We have already mentioned the pedigree of Richard duke of York, as de&s;cended from Lionel duke of Clarence, elder brother of John of Gaunt, the founder of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter; and, we &s;hall now take notice of the objections that were made to Richard's claim. Henry's friends ob&s;erved, that when his grandfather Henry IV. took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, no per&s;on pre|tended to di&s;pute his title. The Yorki&s;ts replied, that as Edmund earl of March, who was then alive, could not a&s;&s;ert his title without running the ri&s;que of his life, his &s;ilence could not be interpreted into acquie&s;cence in the right of the u&s;urper. When Henry's favourers alledged, that his grandfather had re|ceived the crown by the authority of parliament, the favourers of the duke of York an&s;wered, that he did not pretend to claim it without the &s;anction of the &s;aid authority, as plainly appeared from his memorial pre&s;ented to both hou&s;es; but, as the parliament had formerly &s;trong rea&s;ons to &s;et a&s;ide the true heir in favour of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, &s;o now they had powerful motives for doing ju&s;tice to the duke of York. The re&s;ignation of Richard II. was advanced in behalf of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, and, the other &s;ide denied that Richard's re&s;ignation regarded that hou&s;e in particular, or even the per&s;on of Henry IV. but, even allowing this to have been the ca&s;e, a king who was actually in confinement, and on the point of being depo&s;ed, had no power to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. It was objected to the duke of York, that his father, the earl of Cambridge, had been executed for high trea&s;on, and his po&s;terity de|clared incapable of all inheritance: but, this objection $as obviated by tho&s;e who ob&s;erved, that the duke of York had been re&s;tored to the honours, and all the rights of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by the king him&s;elf; and acknowledged as duke of York and earl of March by Henry, as well as the whole kingdom. Then the friends of the king ob&s;erved, that the crown had been above &s;ixty years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. To this ob&s;ervation the others replied,
<PB N="372" REF="3820">
that natural rights were indefea&s;ible, and that no po&s;itive law could bring them into pre&s;cription. The la&s;t argument advanced in favour of Henry imported, t$at having already reigned t$irty years, and led an innocent and inoffen&s;ive $$fe, it would be cruel to deprive him of the crown. To invalidate this argu|ment, the Yorki&s;ts ob&s;erved, that as Henry was incapable of governing by him&s;elf, &s;uch indulgence would only operate in favour of the queen and her mini&s;ters, who ab$&s;ed his name and authority: that, out of tenderne&s;s to him, they ought not to prejudice the whole kingdom, nor commit a flagrant piece of inju&s;tice from a motive of charity.</P>
<P N="55">LV. Such were the principal rea&s;ons advanced on both &s;ides of this very remarkable di&s;pute, which was maintained with great &s;pirit and capacity for &s;ome days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, until they agreed to a &s;ort of modification, which they hoped would prevent all tho&s;e mi&s;chievous con&s;equences that might have at|tended a total revolution. They unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that Henry &s;hould en|joy the crown for his natural life; and the duke of York be declared his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This re&s;olution was &s;ignified to the king by the chancellor, and afterwards reduced to an act of parliament to the following effect: That, altho' the duke of York had an inconte&s;tible right to the throne, he con&s;ented to Henry's enjoying it for life, and even to take the oath to him as to his lawful &s;overeign; but, in ca&s;e Henry &s;hould in any &s;hape violate this<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$owe. Gra$ton. Fa$i$n.</NOTE> agreement, the crown &s;hould from that moment devolve to the duke of York, or his lawful heirs. After this act was pa&s;&s;ed, the king, with the crown upon his head, went in proce&s;&s;ion to St. Paul's, accompanied by the duke of York, in token of reconciliation; and, indeed, he &s;eemed to be quite ea&s;y under this revolution of his affairs. Without &s;eeming affected by the misfortunes of his family, he lived in tranquillity, employing him&s;elf wholly in the exerci&s;es of de|votion; and leaving the admini&s;tration to tho&s;e who managed under the &s;anction of his name and authority. The duke of York finding him&s;elf ab&s;olutely ma&s;ter of Henry's per&s;on, obliged him to &s;ign an order for the queen to repair to London; well knowing, that &s;he would not obey the injunction: but, his de|&s;ign was to render her criminal in the eyes of the world, from her refu&s;al to comply with the command of her lord and hu&s;band; which would in &s;ome mea&s;ure authori&s;e the mea&s;ures he intended to take again&s;t that prince&s;s. He thought her ab&s;olutely without re&s;ource, and per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that nothing was wanting but a pretext for rai&s;ing invincible ob&s;tacles to her return, that he might be altogether delivered from &s;uch an active enemy. But, he was mi|&s;taken in his conjecture.</P>

<P>Margaret, far from being di&s;pirited by the misfortunes of her hu&s;band, had already returned to England with her &s;on the prince of Wales; and rai&s;ed an army of eighteen thou&s;and men in the northern counties. In order to engage the people of that country in her intere&s;t, &s;he found means to diffu&s;e a report among them, that they &s;hould be allowed to pillage all Eng|land to the &s;outhward of the Trent; and, in all probability, her &s;ucce&s;s in le|vying forces was owing to this expedient. The duke of York, being in|formed of her de&s;igns, re&s;olved to arre&s;t her in the middle of her career; and for that purpo&s;e &s;et out from London with four or five thou&s;and men, leaving an order with his &s;on the earl of March, to conduct the re&s;t of the army into
<PB N="373" REF="3830">
quarters of refre&s;hment in Wales; and afterwards join him in the northern coun|ties. As the duke advanced towards the north, he was not a little alarmed by the news of the queen's &s;ucce&s;s in levying forces, with which he had not been acquainted before he left London; and, when he arrived in the neigh|bourhood of Wakefield in York&s;hire, he received intelligence, that &s;he was in full march again&s;t him, at the head of eighteen thou&s;and men. He forthwith threw him&s;elf into his own ca&s;tle of Sandal, by the advice of the earl of Sali&s;|bury, who ob&s;erved, that as the queen had no artillery, he could not be forced in that place, until he &s;hould be joined by his &s;on Edward. Margaret, ne|glected no artifice which &s;he thought could induce him to quit this retreat before his &s;on's arrival. She affected to continue her route towards the &s;outh; then &s;he placed the greater part of her forces behind an eminence; and with the re&s;t approaching the ca&s;tle of Sandal, provoked him to battle by the mo&s;t in&s;ulting me&s;&s;ages. Whether the duke was &s;timulated by her reproaches, or found him&s;elf obliged to make a de&s;perate effort, for want of provi&s;ion; or la&s;tly, was deceived in the number of the enemy; certain it is, he drew out his men, and re&s;olved to hazard a battle. The action was begun by York, who charged the queen's troops with great impetuo&s;ity: but, her numbers overballanced his courage; and tho&s;e troops who had been po&s;ted in ambu&s;h behind the hill, falling &s;uddenly upon his rear, the Yorki&s;ts were immediately routed: the duke him&s;elf was &s;lain fighting valiantly on foot; Sir Thomas Harrington, Sir David Hall, Sir Hugh Ha&s;tings, Sir Thomas Nevil, third &s;on to the earl of Sali&s;bury, Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, with many other gentlemen, and about two thou&s;and eight hundred &s;oldiers, met with the &s;ame fate. The duke's &s;on Edmund Plantagenet, earl of Rutland, was after the battle inhumanly killed in cold blood, upon Wakefield bridge, by the lord Clifford: the earl of Sali&s;bury being wounded and taken pri&s;oner, was &s;ent to Pomfret, where he &s;uffered decapitation, and his head was fixed on the walls of York, as well as the duke's, upon which Clifford &s;et a crown of paper, in de|ri&s;ion of his title. Thus fell Richard, duke of York, a prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many great and amiable qualities, and blameworthy alone, for having involved his country in the mi&s;eries of civil war, with a view to a&s;&s;ert a di&s;puted claim, &s;uch as had often been di&s;regarded in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h kings, both before and after the conque&s;t; a claim which, in all probability, would have lain dormant, had not the imbecility of Henry, and the arbitrary mea&s;ures and unpopular deportment of his queen, awaked and invited it from the &s;hade of oblivion.</P>

The earl of March, far from being di&s;pirited by the defeat and death of his father, was inflamed with the mo&s;t eager de&s;ire of revenge; and re&s;olved to hazard his life and fortune in the &s;up|port of his preten&s;ions. He now found him&s;elf in Wales, at the head of three and twenty thou&s;and men, be&s;ides tho&s;e who had been left under the command of Warwick for the defence of the capital; and, with the&s;e he determined to go in que&s;t of Margaret, on whom he longed to revenge the misfortunes of his family. That prince&s;s had begun her march for London; and hearing of

March, being informed of the queen's motions, had altered his fir&s;t re&s;olution of giving her battle, and changed his route, in hope of reaching London before her arrival: but, when he under&s;tood, that Tudor had been detached again&s;t him, rather than run the ri&s;que of being hemmed in between two ho&s;tile armies, he marched directly into Hereford&s;hire, in order to give him battle. The two armies met near Mortimer's cro&s;s, on Candlemas eve; and Edward being greatly &s;uperior in number to the Lanca&s;trians, the&s;e la&s;t were &s;oon defeated, with the lo&s;s of three thou&s;and and eight hundred men killed on the field of action.

<P>Mean while the queen, with her &s;on, attended by the dukes of So|mer&s;et and Exeter, the earls of Northumberland, Devon&s;hire, and Shrew&s;bury, the lords Fitzhugh, Grey of Codemore, Roos, Grey&s;tock, Willes, and Wil|loughby, continued her march towards London, in full hope, that whenever her victorious army &s;hould appear, the citizens would expel the earl of War|wick, and receive her in triumph. Warwick him&s;elf &s;eemed to dread &s;ome &s;uch event; for, rather than keep him&s;elf &s;ecure within the walls of London, he marched out with an handful to hazard an engagement: a &s;tep which he certainly would not have taken, had he been &s;ecure in the affection of the ci|tizens. Margaret had advanced as far as St. Alban's, when &s;he received intel|ligence, that Warwick was on his march towards that place, with the king in his army, which was reinforced by a body of Londoners. The&s;e had joined him, in order to prevent the mi&s;chie&s;s they apprehended from the queen's troops, who were northern free-booters accu&s;tomed to rapine, and had ravaged the whole country in their pa&s;&s;age. On Shrove-Tue&s;day the opppo&s;ite armies came in &s;ight of each other, and engaged on Barnard's-Heath near St. Alban's; where, for &s;ome time, the fortune of Warwick &s;eemed to prevail, until the lord Lovelace, who commanded one of his wings, wheeled off, leaving the main body expo&s;ed; and then victory declared for Margaret. The earl on this oc|ca&s;ion lo&s;t two thou&s;and men, who were killed either in the action or in the pur&s;uit; tho' he rallied his broken troops, and made an excellent retreat. The lord Bonvil, and Sir Thomas Kyreil, to who&s;e care he had committed the per&s;on of Henry, were per&s;uaded to &s;tay with that prince, on his a&s;&s;urance, that they &s;hould receive no injury; but, he had not intere&s;t enough to &s;ave their lives: Margaret ordered them to be beheaded at St. Alban's on A&s;h-Wed|ne&s;day. The chief advantage which Margaret reaped from the victory, was the relea&s;e of her hu&s;band, who&s;e name &s;erved to authori&s;e her tran&s;actions: but, &s;he &s;eems to have been very much wanting to her own intere&s;t, in neglecting to march directly to the capital, while the news of her victory operated &s;o &s;trongly on the minds of the inhabitants, that they would have opened their gates at her approach. The citizens, indeed, were afraid of being plun|dered by her forces, who had already pillaged the town of St. Alban's: but, they were &s;till more afraid of incurring the re&s;entment of a victorious army, which they did not think them&s;elves in a condition to oppo&s;e. The ravages of
<PB N="375" REF="3850">
he$ troops having occa&s;ioned a &s;carcity of provi&s;ion in her camp, &s;he demanded a &s;upply $rom the mayor of London, who did not think proper to refu&s;e her in &s;uch a conjuncture. He ordered &s;everal waggons to be loaded with all &s;orts of lenten provi&s;ion; but, they were &s;topped at Newgate by the populace, who were incen&s;ed at the licentious behaviour of her troops; and declared, that no nece&s;&s;aries &s;hould be furni&s;hed by the city, for the u&s;e of an army that did not come to defend, but to pillage their effects. The queen &s;ent a body of forces, commanded by Sir Baldwin Fulford, and Sir Alexander Hody, to make an effort towards gaining admittance to the city, and they attempted to force Cripplegate; but were repul&s;ed. Margaret denounced vengeance again&s;t the Londoners for this in&s;ult; tho' &s;he never had an opportunity to execute the &s;cheme of her re&s;entment; for, receiving intelligence that the earls of March and Warwick had joined their forces at Chiping-Norton in Oxford&s;hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grafton.</NOTE> and begun their progre&s;s for London, &s;he retired to the north, where &s;he hoped to increa&s;e her army to &s;uch a formidable number, as would in&s;ure &s;uc|ce&s;s again&s;t all oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The earl of March arriving at London in the beginning of March, entered the city in triumph, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, by whom he was adored, for his affability and per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, in which he excelled all the princes of his age. His friends, tru&s;ting to this popularity, re&s;olved to &s;ave him the trouble and uncertainty of a parliamentary deci&s;ion, and rai&s;e him at once to the throne by the con&s;ent of the people, and the grandees. With this view, the earl of Warwick drew up his army in order of battle, in the fields near Clerkenwell, on pretence of exerci&s;ing the &s;oldiers: an immen&s;e multitude of people being a&s;&s;embled to indulge their curio&s;ity, the earl rode into the mid&s;t of this concour&s;e, and read aloud the convention made between Henry and the duke of York, and confirmed by act of parlia|ment. Then he gave them to under&s;tand, that as the king had notoriou&s;ly violated this agreement, he had indi&s;putably forfeited his right to the crown, which now belonged to Edward Plantagenet, the &s;ole and true heir of the hou&s;e of Mortimer. He thus prepared the people for his purpo&s;e, by an a&s;&s;ertion which was ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, ina&s;much as Henry had been his own pri&s;oner from the time of the agreement till the battle of Barnet, after which he was com|pelled to act according to the views of Margaret. Then he rai&s;ed his voice, and a&s;ked, if they would have Henry of Lanca&s;ter for their king: the whole multitude an&s;wered, No, No: but when he demanded, if they would acknow|ledge Edward for their &s;overeign, they replied in the affirmative with loud ac|clamations. The con&s;ent of the people being thus obtained, the Yorki&s;ts convoked a great council of all the lords &s;piritual and temporal, magi&s;trates, and gentlemen, who happened to be in London; and, Edward having ex|plained his right to the crown, both by birth, and the agreement between Henry and his father, d$&s;ired it might be adjudged to him by the determina|tion of this a&s;&s;embly. He mu&s;t have had more courage than di&s;cretion, who would have attempted to impugn his preten&s;ions at &s;uch a juncture; therefore, the council unanimou&s;ly declared, that Henry of Lanca&s;ter had forfeited all right to the crown, in violating the &s;olemn agreement made with the late duke of York, which was confirmed by parliament; and, that it now devolved to

the duke's elde&s;t &s;on, Edward Plantagenet earl of March. After this decla|ration, the crown was offered to the earl, who received it with a mode&s;t ac|knowledgment of his own in&s;ufficiency; adding, that tho' his youth and in|experience rendered him fearful of loading him&s;elf with &s;uch a heavy burthen, he would do his utmo&s;t endeavours, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to make his people rich and happy. Next day he repaired to St. Paul's church, where he &s;at in the royal chair, with the &s;ceptre of St. Edward in his hand. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury demanding aloud, if the people would own Edward, earl of M$rch, as their king, they replied as before, with acclamations of joy; and then the king received the homage of the nobility. This ceremony being con|cluded with a &s;olemn Te Deum, Edward was conducted to the bi&s;hop's palace, in which the kings u&s;ed to re&s;ide; and, on the fifth day of March, he was pro|claimed by the name of Edward IV. in the city of London, and the neigh|bourhood.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t act of fovere$gnty that di&s;tingui&s;hed the reign of Edward, is &s;aid to have been $he execution of one Walker, a citizen and grocer, who joco&s;ely &s;aid to his neighbours that he would make his &s;on heir to the crown, meaning the &s;ign of the crown that hung over his door: this innocent je&s;t was con&s;trued into high trea&s;on, and the unhappy man &s;uffered death; though, in all probability, his chief crime was his adherence to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, which Edward re&s;olved to p$ni&s;h with the utmo&s;t rigour. He had not e$joyed his new dign$ty above eight days, when he found him&s;elf obliged to begin his march again&s;t Ma$garet, who had &s;uc$$eded &s;o well in recruiting her army amo$g her northern friends, that by this time &s;he found her&s;elf at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, ready to &s;acrifice their lives for her &s;ervice. Edward did not &s;o much depend upon his election, which had been extremely irregular and defective, as upon the &s;trength of his faction, and the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms. Replete with all the fire of youth, courage, and ambi|tion, he confided in his va$our and fort$ne, again&s;t all odds of oppo&s;ition; and, putting him&s;elf at the head of his forces, &s;et out for the north, in hope of &s;triking a deci&s;ive &s;troke again&s;t the queen and her adherents.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">

<P>On his arrival at Pontefract, he detached the lord Fitzwalter to &s;ieze the pa&s;s of Ferryb$$dge, on the river Aire; and this &s;ervice he performed without $ppo&s;ition. Heary and his queen hearing of Edward's approach, be&s;towed the command of their army on the duke of Somer&s;et, while they them&s;elves remained at York, waiting the i&s;&s;ue of an engagement, by which their fate was likely to be decided for ever. Some$&s;et being informed that Fitzwalter had &s;$$zed the p$$s of Fe$rybridge, concluded that Edward's de&s;ign was to give him battle; and that he might attack him with le&s;s advantage, he re|&s;olved to repel the troops of Fitzwalter to the other &s;ide of the river. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent a detachment under lord Clifford, who &s;urprized the $word$ and drove them from the pa&s;s with great &s;laughter, after an ob&s;ti|nate action, in which Fitzwalter and the Ba&s;tard of Sali&s;bury lo&s;t their lives. The earl of Warwick was extremely alarmed at the news of this di&s;a&s;ter, wh$ch he no &s;ooner received than he rode full &s;peed to Edward, and commu|nicated
<PB N="379" REF="3890">
the tidings with marks of uncommon emotion; but, to convince his &s;overeign that his confu&s;ion did not proceed from any fear of his own per&s;o|nal danger, he killed his hor&s;e on the &s;pot, and ki&s;&s;ing the hilt of his &s;word, which was made in the form of a cro&s;s, &s;wore that even if the whole army &s;hould for&s;ake the king, he would remain alone, and &s;pend the la$t drop of his blood in defence of his maje&s;ty. Edward, far from being di&s;pirited by this check, which &s;eemed to di&s;order Warwick &s;o much, ordered proclam$tion to be made in his army, that all per&s;ons who were afraid of &s;taying &s;hould have free leave to retire: That he would reward tho&s;e who &s;hould do their duty; but that he would &s;hew no mercy to any per&s;on who &s;hould fly from the battl$. Then he ordered lord Falconbridge to pa&s;s the Aire at Ca&s;tleford, about a league above Ferrybridge, and retake the po&s;t which the enemy had won. This order was executed with &s;uch diligence and $ecre$y, that the deta$hment had cro&s;&s;ed the river before the Lanca&s;trians had the lea$t intimation of their de&s;ign; then attacking Clifford by &s;urprize, that nobleman and the brother of the earl of We&s;tmoreland were $lain, and their forces intirely routed.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>The pa&s;s of Ferrybridge being thus regained, Edward cro&s;&s;ed the river, and, early in the morning of Palm-&s;unday, advanced towards the Lan|ca&s;trians, who, to the number of &s;ixty thou&s;and, occupied the fields between Towton and Saxton. Though the Yorki&s;ts did not exceed nine and forty thou&s;and, they were cho&s;en men, and Edward did not entertain the lea&s;t doubt of victory, but, before the battle joined, he publi&s;hed an o$der through his army, that his &s;oldiers &s;hould not encumber them&s;elves with pri&s;oners. About nine in the morning it began to &s;now, and a &s;harp wind drove the $leet full into the faces of the Lanca&s;trians, di&s;ordering their &s;ight in &s;uch a manner, that they could not judge the di&s;tance between them&s;elves and the enemy. The lord Falconbridge, who commanded the van of Edward's army, taking ad|vantage of this accident, ordered his archers to advance within &s;ho$ of Henry's line, and let fly a &s;hower of arrows, which were no &s;ooner di&s;charged than they retired again to their former &s;tation. The Lanca&s;trian$ feeling the effect$ of this flight, believed the Yorki&s;ts were within their reach, and plied their bows until their quiver$ were quite exhau&s;ted, without having done the lea&s;t execution. Then Falconbridge advanced again with his archers, who now &s;hot their arrows without oppo&s;ition, and &s;lew a va&s;t number of the enemy, even with the &s;hafts which they picked from the field, after their own quivers were emptied. The earl of Northumberland and Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded the van of Henry's army, &s;eeing the di&s;advantage under which they laboured, in this way of fighting, advanced to clo&s;e combat, and each &s;ide fought with equal courage, ob&s;tinacy, and rancour. The battle raged with great fury from morning till night; and Edward exhibited &s;uch proofs of &s;urprizing courage, activity, and conduct, that the fate of the day depended in a great mea&s;ure on his per&s;onal behaviour, and that of the earl of Warwick. Towards the evening, the Lanca&s;trians being di&s;couraged by the death of the earls of Northumberland and We&s;tmoreland, the lords Dacres and Willes, Sir Andrew Trollop, and many other officers of di&s;tinction, began to give ground, though not in great di&s;order, intending to retreat to the bridge of Tadca&s;ter. They accordingly pre&s;erved their ranks, and wheeled about occa&s;ionally as they retired, until Edward and Warwick animating their men to render the
<PB N="380" REF="3900">
action deci&s;ive, they redoubled their efforts, and charged with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the Lanca&s;trians were broken and entirely routed. Great numbers were &s;lain in the field of battle and in the pur&s;uit; but the chief carnage happened at the &s;mall river Coc, which di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Warf. Thither the fugitives f$ed in hope of fording the &s;tream; but it was &s;o &s;welled with the rains as to be rendered impa&s;&s;able, until a kind of bridge or mound was formed by the dead bodies of the Lanca&s;trians, who were &s;laughtered on the banks or drowned in the river, which ran purple with their blood. Nor will this circum&s;tance appear incredible, when we con&s;ider that above &s;ix and thirty thou&s;and men were killed in this battle. The dukes of Somer&s;et and Exeter e&s;caped with great difficulty; but the earl of Devon&s;hire was taken.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sto$e. Gra$$on. B$o$di. Speed.</NOTE> Immediately after this great victory, Edward advanced to York, in hope of &s;eizing the per&s;ons of Henry and Margaret; but this prince&s;s had retired with her hu&s;band to Berwick. There being joined by the dukes of Somer&s;et and Exeter, &s;he concluded a t$eaty with the Scotti&s;h mini&s;try, and repaired to that kingdom, wh$re $he and her hu&s;band met with a very ho&s;pitable reception. This, however, &s;he purcha&s;ed at a dear rate, in ceding the town and ca&s;tle of Berwick to the Scotti&s;h monarch, who was at that time a minor, under the tuition of George Douglas earl of Angus, with whom Henry engaged in a particular convention. Edward, on his arrival at York, ordered the heads of his father and the earl of Sali&s;bury to be taken down from the walls, and tho&s;e of the earl of Devon&s;hire and &s;ome others, who were beheaded as traitors, to be &s;et up in their room.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>The battle of Towton intirely decided the fate of the hou&s;e of Lan|ca&s;ter. The north, which u&s;ed to &s;upply it with forces, was now exhau&s;ted, and the brave$t warriors of tho&s;e parts had peri&s;hed in &s;uch a &s;eries of engage|ments. The queen had no re&s;ource left but the friend&s;hip of Scotland, from which &s;he could expect but little a$$i$tance during the minority of James III. Edward was ma&s;ter of all England and Wales, except Harlegh and Mer|ioneth&s;hire, and &s;ome ca$tles in Northumberland, which he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to reduce. Perhaps he was afraid of their being delivered to the Scots, &s;hould they be hard pre&s;&s;ed by his forces; or imagined they would &s;ubmit of their own accord, upon his title's being univer&s;ally acknowledged in all other parts of the kingdom, and confirmed by the ceremony of his co|ronation, which he would no longer defer. He had proceeded as far as New|ca&s;tle, where having made &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary regulations for pre&s;erving the peace of the country, and left a body of troops &s;ufficient to repel the incur&s;ions that might be made from tho&s;e ca&s;tles that did not yet acknowledge his &s;overeignty, he returned to his palace of She$e, in the neighbourhood of London. The twentieth day of June was fixed for his coronation; and, in the mean time, by the advice of the earl of Douglas, who had been long a refugee in England, he re&s;olved to find &s;uch employment for the Scots as would prevent them from giving any con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Henry and Margaret. For this purpo&s;e he entered into a negotiation with the earl of Ro&s;s, lord of the I&s;les, who had revolted from James, and promi&s;ed to wa&s;te the northern parts of Scotland with fire and &s;word: but, as the articles of this treaty, which was managed by the earl of Douglas, could not be executed immediately, Edward propo&s;ed a truce to the regency of Scotland, and commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed to treat
<PB N="381" REF="3910">
on this &s;ubject; but the conferences were rendered ineffectual by the intrigues of Margaret, who re&s;ided at Edinburgh, and by this time had ingratiated her&s;elf with Mary of Gueldres, the Scotti&s;h king's mother.</P>

<P>Mean while the new king of England was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and i&s;&s;ued out writs for calling a parliament to meet on the &s;ixth day of July, from which it was prorogued to the fourth day of November. Immediately after the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened, the commons attended Edward with an addre&s;s, congratulating him on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and reque&s;ting him to puni&s;h all per&s;ons guilty of &s;uch extortions, riots, rapes, murders, and other iniquities, as had been committed with impunity, during the preceding$ reign. Then an act was pa&s;&s;ed, confirming the title of Edward. All tho&s;e which had been made again&s;t the hou&s;e of York were repealed. Henry VI. after a reign of eight and thirty years, was declared an u&s;urper, and all his tran&s;ac|tions were annulled as illegal; and la&s;tly, he him&s;elf, his queen, and all their adherents, were attainted as traitors. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, Edward created his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. Rot. Parl.</NOTE> brother George duke of Clarence; his younger brother Richard was made duke of Glouce&s;ter; the lord Falconbridge promoted to the earldom of Kent; Henry Bourchier the king's uncle, was honoured with the earldom of E&s;&s;ex; and John Nevil, brother to the earl of Warwick, was created baron of Mon|tague. The&s;e promotions were followed by &s;everities which &s;erve to evince that cruelty which was inherent in all, even the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed princes of the Norman line. Be&s;ides Henry him&s;elf, his wife Margaret, and their &s;on Edward, who were attainted, the &s;ame act included the dukes of Somer&s;et and Exeter, the earls of Northumberland, Wilts, and Pembroke, the vi&s;count Beaumont, the lords Roos, Nevil, Willes, Clifford, Grey of Rugemont, Dacres, and Hungerford, Sir Richard Ton&s;tall, and a great number of gentle|men who&s;e e&s;tates were confi&s;cated. John earl of Oxford, a venerable old<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 146$.</NOTE> nobleman of unblemi&s;hed character, was arre&s;ted on pretence of having en|gaged in a corre&s;pondence with Margaret; and, without having enjoyed the benefit of a trial, beheaded on Tower-hill, together with his elde&s;t &s;on Aubrey de Vere, Sir Thomas Todenham, Sir Walter Tirrel, and Sir John Montgo|mery; and Sir Baldwin Fulford &s;uffered afterwards in Bri&s;tol. The lands and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian.</NOTE> effects of tho&s;e victims he di&s;tributed among his own adherents, and conciliated the affection of the clergy by confirming their privileges, exempting them from being pro&s;ecuted in civil courts for felonies and other offences; e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the juri&s;diction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts with regard to tythes, and al|lowing them to i&s;&s;ue &s;piritual cen&s;ures again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould invade their pre|rogatives. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Edward having regulated his dome&s;tic affairs, converted his attention to foreign occurrences. England was actually at war with France, Scotland, Brittany, and the Low Countries; and if all the&s;e powers had joined again&s;t Edward at this juncture, his royalty would have been of &s;hort duration. Luckily for him, he had nothing to fear from Lewis XI. of France, who&s;e mind was wholly engro&s;&s;ed by a project for rendering him&s;elf ab&s;olute in his own dominions, and de&s;troying the power of the nobles, of whom the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne were the principal. He therefore had no inclina|tion to renew the war with England. The duke of Brittany was in no condition to cope with &s;uch a powerful kingdom. The duke of Burgundy, though
<PB N="$82" REF="3920">
a friend to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, was &s;o well acquainted with the di&s;po&s;ition of Lewis, that he divined his &s;cheme; and de&s;ired to live in peace with Eng|land, that he might be the more able to anticipace the French king's de&s;igns. In the&s;e &s;entiments, $e &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to congratulate Edward on his ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and to complain of &s;ome infractions of the truce &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between England and the Low Countries. They met with a very favourable reception, and commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed to examine the parti|culars of the complaint, that all differences might be amicably compromi&s;ed. Scotland then was the only place from whence he could apprehend the lea&s;t mole&s;tation. Margaret had concluded a contract of marriage between her &s;on Edward, and the &s;i&s;ter of James, though both parties were in&s;ants; and leaving her hu&s;band at Edinburgh, made a voyage to France to crave the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of Lewis: but that prince was not of a character to engage in any enterprize from which he &s;aw no pro&s;pect of advantage. He courteou&s;ly re|ceived Margaret, who was his near relation, and even amu&s;ed her with pro|mi&s;e of &s;uccour; but all &s;he could obtain was a pre&s;ent of twenty thou&s;and li$res, and a declaration that all the adherents of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter &s;hould meet with a friendly reception in his dominions. Edward, in order to baffle her intrigues in Scotland, &s;till employed Douglas in a negotiation with John lord of the I&s;les, who had lately &s;ucceeded his father. The bi&s;hop of Dur|ham, the earl of Worce&s;ter, and &s;ome others, were empowered to fini&s;h the treaty, which was concluded on the following conditions: That John earl of Ro&s;s, lord of the i&s;les, Donald Ballach his brother, and John the &s;on of Do|nald, &s;hould do homage to king Edward: That they &s;hould never acknowledge any other king of England but Edward, or his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, de&s;cended from Lionel duke of Clarence: That they &s;hould be ready to &s;erve him in all his wars again&s;t the Scots in Britain and Ireland: That, in time of peace, the earl of Ro&s;s &s;hould enjoy a yearly pen&s;ion of one hundred pounds &s;terling, forty be allowed to Donald, and ten to John the &s;on of Donald; and that the&s;e pen&s;ions &s;hould be doubled in time of war or actual &s;ervice: That in ca&s;e Scotland &s;hould be conquered by the arms of Edward, he &s;hould inve&s;t them with the property of all the i&s;les &s;ituated to the northward of the Scotti&s;h &s;ea: That James earl of Douglas &s;hould in like manner receive the inve&s;titure of all the lands he had formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Scotland, from the north &s;ea to the borders of England; and that Edward &s;hould make neither peace nor truce<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> with Scotland, without comprehending them in the treaty.</P>

<P>Edward had intimated his elevation to pope Pius II. who now think|ing him &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne, addre&s;&s;ed him in a brief, con|gratulating him upon his acce&s;&s;ion; but couched in &s;uch a manner as re&s;erved to him&s;elf the liberty of un&s;aying his compliment, in ca&s;e the king &s;hould ex|perience a vi&s;&s;icitude of fortune; for his approbation was conditional, and founded upon the proofs which Edward him&s;elf advanced in behalf of his pre|ten&s;ions. The lord Falconbridge, lately created earl of Kent, was now pro|moted to the po&s;t of high admiral of England; and the kingdom enjoying profound tranquillity, after the &s;torm by which it had been agitated, the duke of Somer&s;et, and Ralph Piercy, brother to the earl of Northumberland, im|plored<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$$ Public.</NOTE> the mercy of the king, by whom they were generou&s;ly pardoned.

in France, commanded by Peter De Brez&eacute; $en$&s;chal of Normandy, &s;et &s;ail for England, in full confidence of being joined by the inhabitants of the northern provinces. But, when $he landed at Tinmouth, &s;he found her&s;elf in danger of being &s;urrounded by a body of Edward's troops, which obliged her to retire on board of her &s;hips with the utmo$t precipitation. A &s;torm imme|diately beginning to blow, her &s;hip was &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the $$eet, and with great difficulty made the harbour of Berwick, while the other ve&s;&s;els were driven towards Bamburg, where the French attempted to land; but their de&s;|cent being oppo&s;ed by the Ba&s;tard Ogle, at the head of &s;ome forces, they retired to the &s;mall i&s;land of Lindisfarne. There they were attacked by Ogle, who $lew part of their number, and took the re&s;t pri&s;oners; and their commander De Brez&eacute; made his e&s;cape in a fi&s;hing-boat to Berwick. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Biondi.</NOTE></P>

Margaret had actually entered No$thumberland with a body of &s;reebooters, who e$li$ted on promi&s;e of being allowed to plunder; and her army encrea$ed to &s;uch a degree, that the duke of Somer&s;et and Sir Ralph $$ercy began to imagine &s;he would &s;ucceed in her enterprize; and notwith&s;tanding the late oath they had taken to Edward, joined her with all their adherents. Montague having advanced as far as Dur|ham, halted &s;ome days in that place until he recei$ed a reinforcement; then continuing his march, encountered a detachment of the enemy's army, com|manded by the lords Hungerford and Roos, on Hedgeley-Moor, where $hey were routed; and Sir Ralph Piercy lo&s;t his life on this occa&s;ion. Montague, encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, re&s;olved to have the whole honour of defeating Margaret before the king &s;hould come up, and marching directly to He$ham, where her army was intrenched, he attacked them in their lines before they had intimation of his approach, and obtained a complete victory. The duke of So|mer&s;et was taken pri&s;oner, together with the lords Roos and Hunger$ord; but Henry, his queen, and &s;on, e&s;caped into Scotland, though they were &s;o hotly pur&s;ued, that &s;ome of Henry's attendants were taken almo&s;t by his &s;$de; and among the&s;e the per&s;on who carried his cap of &s;tate, which was deli$ered to Edward. The pri&s;oners were not &s;uffered to langui&s;h in confinement; Somer|&s;et, Roos, Hungerford, W. Tailboys earl of Kyme, and Sir John Finderne, were immediately beheaded, the fir&s;t at Hexham and the re&s;t at Newca&s;tle; Sir Humphrey Nevil and twelve other gentlemen were executed at York; their e&s;tates were di&s;tributed among the adherents of the victor, and the lo$d Montague was created earl of Northumberland; though Henry Piercy, &s;ub|mitting to Edward in the &s;equel, was re&s;tored to his honours with the con&s;ent of Nevil, who contented him&s;elf with the title of marquis of Montague.</P>

Edward's la&s;t victory cooled that friend&s;hip which the French and Scots had hitherto manife&s;ted for the unfortunate Henry, who&s;e affairs they now looked upon as de&s;perate. The Scots perceiving the precautions which were taken by Montague, whom the king of England had ju&s;t declared warden of the Marches, &s;aw no pro&s;pect of eluding his vigilance by incur&s;ions, and de&s;ired that Edward would grant &s;afe-conducts for amba&s;&s;a|dors to come and treat of a pacification: at the &s;ame time Lewis XI. negotiated a truce with him for one year, by the mediation of the duke of Burgundy, who likewi&s;e renewed the truce of commerce between England and the Low Coun|tries.

<P>Henry being thus abandoned by all his allies, and thinking his per&s;on un&s;afe at Edinburgh &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of this la&s;t agreement, took the im|prudent re&s;olution of repairing privately to England, where perhaps he hoped the northern counties would again ri&s;e in his favour. He accordingly &s;et out $rom Edinburgh, in di&s;gui&s;e, attended by three divines, and reached Wadding|ton-Hall in Lanca&s;hire, where, after he had lain concealed for &s;ome time, he was di&s;covered by Sir James Harrington, who treated this unfortunate prince with the utmo&s;t indignity. He was &s;eized as he &s;at at dinner, and being placed upon a hor&s;e, his legs were tied under the belly of the bea&s;t, as if he had been the vile&s;t malefactor. In this manner he was conducted to London, and being met upon the road by the earl of Warwick, that nobleman in&s;ulted him in the mo&s;t opprobrious terms, even encouraging the multitude to deride the unfortunate monarch. After the capture of Henry, his queen and &s;on, afraid of tru&s;ting to any per&s;on's fidelity, fled for refuge into woods and de&s;erts, where they &s;uffered all the extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, till at length they were rifled by rob|bers, who would, in all probability, have deprived them of their lives as well as of their apparel and effects, had not the thieves quarrelled about the booty, and attacking one another, afforded an oppertunity for the royal pri&s;oners to make their e&s;cape. They had not proceeded far when they were met by another ru$$ian, who approached them with a drawn &s;word in his hand and fury in his a&s;pect. On this occa&s;ion, Margaret exhibited a remarkable proof of pre&s;ence of mind and re&s;olution. Taking her &s;on by the hand, and a&s;&s;uming an air of confidence and maje&s;ty, "Here, friend," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;ave my &s;on, the &s;on of good king "Henry."

His &s;avage heart was melted with compa&s;&s;ion, at &s;ight of his queen and prince in &s;uch deplora|ble di&s;tre&s;s. He comforted them with a&s;&s;urances of fidelity and protection; and carefully conducted them to a village near the &s;ea-&s;ide, where they found an opportunity of embarking in a ve&s;&s;el for Flanders.

<P>Edward having Henry in his power, and Margaret having quitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1464.</NOTE> the kingdom, there was no other per&s;on capable of di&s;turbing his tranquility. He therefore &s;eized this opportunity of acquiring the affection of his &s;ubjects, who had been alarmed and di&s;gu&s;ted by his late acts of &s;everity. He had pub|li&s;hed a general amne&s;ty in favour of all the Lanca&s;trians who, within a certain &s;pecified time, &s;hould &s;ubmit to his government, and take the oath of alle|giance. He exerted all his talents in efforts to render him&s;elf popular. He treated all his noblemen as if they had been his own brothers: he affected to appear the father of his people. His per&s;onal accompli&s;hments and gallantry recommended him to the favour of the female &s;ex, which he cultivated with the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous addre&s;s. By his affable deportment he ingratiated him&s;elf with all degrees of people; the meane&s;t &s;uppliant was admitted to his pre&s;ence, and every day was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his acts of compa&s;&s;ion and genero&s;ity. During this &s;ea&s;on of peace and good humour, his chief coun&s;ellors advi&s;ed him to con|vert his thoughts to matrimony, that he might &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ettled upon his own i&s;&s;ue. He &s;eemed to reli&s;h the advice; and three matches were pro|po&s;ed for his acceptance. The fir&s;t was Margaret &s;i&s;ter of the Scotti&s;h king; but be&s;ides that this prince&s;s was already betrothed to Edward the &s;on of Henry, &s;he was too young for con&s;ummation. The &s;econd was I&s;abel of Ca&s;tile, who afterwards married Ferdinand king of Arragon; but &s;he too was judged to be too young for wedlock. Bona of Savoy, &s;i&s;ter to the queen of France, was the third prince&s;s propo&s;ed as a con&s;ort for Edward, who deter|mined to demand her in marriage; and for this purpo&s;e, the earl of Warwick was appointed amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the French court, where the lady re&s;ided. We have already ob&s;erved, that the chief aim of Lewis was to reduce the exorbitant power of his grandees, and particularly to aba&s;e the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was &s;o powerful that he dur&s;t not attack him openly; and therefore he re&s;olved to begin with the duke of Brit|tany, on pretence of a di&s;pute which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the crown of France and the &s;overeigns of that province, touching the nature of the homage which the duke &s;hould pay to the French monarch. The kings of France had always demanded liege, and the dukes never granted more than &s;imple homage; &s;o that both &s;ides u&s;ed to enter a prote&s;t at every new inve&s;titure. Lewis, re|&s;olving to make u&s;e of this pretext, ordered a body of troops to rendezvous in Anjou, and then &s;ent the chancellor de Morvilliers with an order to the duke of Bretagne, prohibiting him from a&s;&s;uming any right of &s;overeignty within his own dominions. The duke being in no condition to oppo&s;e &s;uch an antagoni&s;t in the field, had recour&s;e to &s;tratagem, and de&s;ired he might be indulged with a delay of three months, that he might con&s;ult the e&s;tates of his dutchy. His reque&s;t being granted, he employed this interval in caballing among the peers

<P>Such was the &s;ituation of affairs in France, when Edward &s;ent the earl of Warwick to demand Bona of Savoy in marriage; and nothing could have been more agreeable than this propo&s;al to Lewis, who earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for an alliance with England, which would prevent Edward from interfering with his de&s;igns. He accordingly a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;ition; and that he might reap all the advantage that could be produced from &s;uch a connexion, he &s;pun out the treaty of marriage, in hope of concluding a la&s;ting peace, and en|gaging in a bond of per&s;onal friend&s;hip with the king of England: he was al&s;o de&s;irous of extending this alliance to the duke of Burgundy, that Francis duke of Bretagne might be deprived of all a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection. With this view, he agreed with Edward and Philip to hold a congre&s;s at He&s;din, from whence it was afterwards transferred to St. Omer. But this produced nothing but a prolongation of the truce. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame year, another truce was concluded with Sco$land for fifteen years; and in the month of Augu&s;t amba&s;&s;adors arrived in England from the duke of Brittany, who, finding him|&s;elf hard pre&s;&s;ed by the king of France, &s;ollicited a truce for one year with Ed|ward, who, notwith&s;tanding his negotiation with Lewis, granted the duke's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1465.</NOTE> Mean while the earl of Warwick &s;ettled all the articles of the mar|riage-contract, between the king and the prince&s;s Bona; and Lewis appointed the count of Dammartin as his amba&s;&s;ador and plenipo$entiary at the court of London, to put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to that negotiation, which, however, was defeated by an extraordinary accident. Edward, chancing to hunt in Nor|thamp$on&s;$ire, went to vi&s;it Jaquelina of Luxemburg, the dutche&s;s of Bedford, who, after the death of her fir&s;t hu&s;band, had given her hand to Sir Richard Wideville. By this &s;econd ma$riage &s;he had among other children a daughter called Elizabeth, married to Sir John Grey of Groby, who had been $lain in the &s;ervice of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. The young widow had retired to her father's hou&s;e at Gra$ton, after having &s;een her husband's e&s;tate con$i&s;cated; and &s;he took this opportunity of throwing her&s;elf at Edward's feet, and im|ploring a maintenance for her&s;elf and children, out of their father's fortune. Edward, naturally of an amorous complexion, could not behold this beau|$eous widow at his $eet without emotion. He was in&s;tantly captivated by her charms, and rai$ing her from the ground, made a favourable an&s;wer to her reque&s;t. He con$ided &s;o much in his &s;tation and per&s;onal qualifications, as to imagine he &s;hould ea$ily triumph over her virtue and caution; and found op|portunities to make $er acquainted with the nature of his pa&s;&s;ion. He had for o$ce, however, over-rated his own addre&s;s; &s;he rejected his propo&s;als with di&s;dain, and told him; that, although &s;he was unworthy of being his queen, &s;he thought her&s;elf too good to be his concubine. This declaration completed her conque&s;t over the heart of Edward, who now approved of her &s;pirit and di&s;cretion, as much as he admired her beauty: in a word, he laid a&s;ide his for|mer &s;uit, which &s;he could not have granted with any regard to her honour, and offered his hand as the price of her conde&s;cen&s;ion. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he could have any rea&s;on to refu&s;e &s;uch an offer from a young prince of Ed|ward's

<P>Neverthele&s;s, he would not proceed farther in this affair, without communicating his intention to his mother the dutche&s;s of York, who was extremely &s;urprized and concerned at his pa&s;&s;ion, and u&s;ed all her endeavours to di&s;&s;uade him from engaging in &s;uch an impolitic alliance. She ob&s;erved, that &s;uch a precipitate engagement would be an irreparable injury and affront to the earl of Wawick, as well as to the French king; and, in all probability, intail upon him the re&s;entment of both, to the reproach of his character and imminent danger of his crown; that the nobles in England would ju&s;tly take umbrage at his rai&s;ing the family of Wideville &s;o far above all their honours; that he could not, without degrading his dignity, give his hand to a private gentlewoman, his own &s;ubject, who had &s;everal children by a former husband; and la&s;tly &s;he told him, that &s;ince he was determined to take an Engli&s;h wife, without the con&s;iderations of high birth and opulent fortune, he ought to give the preference to a young lady called Elizabeth Lucy, whom he had formerly promi&s;ed to e&s;pou&s;e. To the&s;e ob&s;ervations Edward replied, that he could not think of &s;acrificing his pa&s;&s;ion which was certain, to the re&s;entment of Warwick which was uncertain; that the king of France would be too much engaged with his own dome&s;tic affairs, to think of troubling his neighbours; that his taking a wife from among his &s;ubjects, far from giving umbrage, would be agreeable to his nobility, as all their families for the future might a&s;pire at the &s;ame ho|nour; and with re&s;pect to Elizabeth Lucy, he denied that any promi&s;e of mar|riage had been made to that young lady. But le&s;t the report of &s;uch an en|gagement might be afterwards u&s;ed as a pretext for invalidating the match upon which he had now &s;et his heart, he de&s;ired that Elizabeth might be ex|amined by the bi&s;hops, touching the nature of her corre&s;pondence with him; when &s;he owned that he had never engaged him&s;elf to her by promi&s;e of mar|riage; though at the &s;ame time &s;he declared that &s;he would never have con|&s;ented to the gratification of his de&s;ires, if &s;he had not thought his intentions were honourable. From this an&s;wer, the prelates determined that he might marry another woman with a &s;afe con&s;cience; and Edward e&s;pou&s;ed Elizabeth Wideville &s;o privately, that the marriage was not divulged until he thought proper to i&s;&s;ue orders for her coronation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe.</NOTE></P>

<P>The nobility and people were not a little &s;urprized when they under|&s;tood that this extraordinary match had been concluded, while the king carried on a negotiation at the court of France $or a marriage with the prince&s;s of Sa|voy. The fir&s;t families of the kingdom were extremely di&s;gu&s;ted at the pro|motion of Elizabeth and her relations; for her father was elevated to the dig|nity of earl of Rivers; her &s;i&s;ter Margaret was matched with Thomas lord Matravers, &s;on and heir of William earl of Arundel; her brother Anthony Wideville e&s;pou&s;ed the only daughter and heir of the lord Scales the riche&s;t for|tune in the kingdom; and her &s;on Thomas being created marquis of Dor&s;et, married the heire&s;s of the lord Bonneville. But the di&s;gu&s;t of the nation in general was a trifling circum&s;tance, when compared with the re&s;entment of the earl of Warwick, who looked upon this clande&s;tine match as the greate&s;t in&s;ult and affront that could be offered to his honour. He con&s;idered it as a
<PB N="388" REF="3980">
fl$grant proof of ingratitude in Edward, whom he had rai&s;ed to the throne; and he could not help communicating his &s;entiments to the king of France, who did not fail to encourage and $oment his indignation. That prince was incen&s;ed again&s;t Edward for the outrage offered to the honour of his family; but his own affairs would not allow him to manife&s;t his re&s;entment, which he therefore re&s;olved to di&s;&s;emble until he &s;hould find &s;ome favourable opportunity to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice. Lewis had nothing princely in his di&s;po&s;ition, except per&s;onal courage, of which he had exhibited repeated proofs before he a&s;cended the throne of France: but he was a cool, &s;elfi&s;h, di&s;&s;embling politician, who knew how to di&s;gui&s;e his &s;entiments and de&s;igns; who could &s;toop to the meane&s;t co$de&s;cen&s;ions, when he thought his intere&s;t would be promoted by &s;uch compliance; and who&s;e reign was a continual exertion of low cunning, by which he &s;ometimes over&s;hot his purpo&s;e, and never failed to incur the con|tempt of his neighbours.</P>

<P>The earl of Warwick returned to England glowing with re&s;ent|ment and revenge, which, however, $e concealed with great care and circum|&s;pection; and from this very di&s;&s;imulation, Edward divined the nature of his &s;e$timents: but, as it was the intere&s;t of both to di&s;gui&s;e their real thoughts, the king continued to treat him with exterior marks of re&s;pect; and the earl maintained his place in the council, until his credit and influence were wholly &s;uper&s;eded by the earl of Rivers. In the mean time the ceremony of the queen's coronation was performed at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the twenty-&s;ixth day of May, with great pomp and magnificence; though neither Warwick nor his brothers the earl of Northumberland, and George lately promoted to the archbi&s;hopric of York, a&s;&s;i&s;ted on this occa&s;ion.

This negotiation mi&s;carried through the count's attachment to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, from which he was de&s;cended by his mother: but Warwick and his colleagues, being empowered to treat with the amba&s;&s;adors of France and Brittany, concluded a truce with both the&s;e powers, though they were at war with each other.</P>

<P>The duke of Brittany had not only engaged the count de Charolois and the duke of Bourbon in the war of the Public Good, but even brought over the French king's brother the duke of Berry, to the intere&s;t of the confederates.

His &s;cheme being detected, the count de Charolois was &s;o exa&s;perated at his per$idy, that he rai&s;ed a numerous army and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ de $word$.</NOTE> approached Paris, while the duke of Brittany and the re&s;t of the confederates made preparations to join him with a &s;trong reinforcement.

&s;uch precautions for the defence of that capital, that, when the confederates joined, they found it &s;o well fortified, that they could not undertake the &s;iege with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. At length the war was terminated by a treaty &s;igned at Conflans, by which Lewis re&s;tored to the duke of Burgundy the towns &s;ituated upon the Somme; and granted Normandy as an appanage to his brother the duke of Berry. After the ratification of this agreement, the count de Charo|lois returned to the Low Countries; and the duke of Berry, accompanied by the duke of Brittany, went to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Normandy, where, in a few days the&s;e two princes happening to quarrel, the duke of Brittany retired to his own dominions. Lewis, taking advantage of this di&s;&s;en&s;ion, marched without delay into Normandy, from whence he expelled his brother, who found him|&s;elf obliged to take refuge in Brittany, where, notwith&s;tanding his quarrel with the duke, he met with an ho&s;pitable reception.</P>

During the&s;e tran&s;actions, I&s;abel de Bourbon, &s;econd wife of the count de Charolois, dying, he began to look upon Edward in a different light from that in which he had con&s;idered him before. He &s;aw him triumphing over all op|po&s;ition, and firmly &s;ettled on the throne of England; he fore&s;aw nothing but mi&s;chief to him&s;elf from the conjunction of Edward and Lewis; and the faire&s;t advantage from an alliance with the king of England. In the&s;e &s;entiments he demanded Edward's &s;i&s;ter Margaret in marriage; and this propo&s;al was very agreeable to the Engli&s;h monarch, who knew that Lewis hated him in his heart on account of his &s;i&s;ter-in-law Bona; that all his advances aad profe&s;&s;ions were in&s;incere; and that &s;ooner or later he would manife&s;t his re&s;entment: be&s;ides, it was not the intere&s;t of England to &s;it tamely neutral, and &s;ee the French king ruin the dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne.

But his father Philip having undertaken a war again&s;t the inhabitants of Liege, the count could not po&s;&s;ibly perform his promi&s;e; &s;o that the duke of Brittany was obliged to temporize with Lewis, by entering into a negotiation with him about his giving up his right of &s;overeignty.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 145.</NOTE> Lewis of France continued his operations again&s;t the duke of Brit|tany, who lo&s;t all the places he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Lower Normandy, and &s;aw him&s;elf on the brink of being attacked in his own proper dominions, while the forces of Burgundy were &s;till employed again&s;t the inhabitants of Liege: but the French king under&s;tanding by his &s;pies, that the negotiation between Edward and Phi|lip related to the defence of Bretagne, he exerted all his art and influence to divert the king of England from tho&s;e engagements with his enemies. He &s;ent the Ba&s;tard of Bourbon and the archbi&s;hop of Narbonne, as his amba&s;&s;adors to London, with propo&s;als of alliance with Edward, who pretended to be intirely free of all connexions, and immediately appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the&s;e envoys: but he found means to protract the negotiation; and Lewis was afraid to drive the duke of Bretagne to extremity, left the king of England &s;hould break off the treaty, and declare in that prince's favour. Such was the &s;ituation of affairs when Philip duke of Burgundy died; and was &s;ucceeded by his only &s;on the count de Charolois, who, on the very day of his father's death, ratified the alliance with Edward, and declared him&s;elf more zealous than ever in &s;upport of the duke of Brittany.</P>

<P>Mean while the court of England underwent con&s;iderable changes, which were productive of infinite mi&s;chief to the nation. As the queen's rela|tions advanced in Edward's favour, the earl of Warwick and his brothers de|clined in their intere&s;t, and were every day &s;ubjected to new mortifications. The po&s;t of chancellor, which had been occupied by the archbi&s;hop of York, was taken in an abrupt and di&s;obliging manner from that prelate, and given to the bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, one of the queen's mo&s;t zealous parti&s;ans. The earl of Warwick was no longer employed in any affair of importance; and his brother the marquis of Montague was kept at a di&s;tance from court, by his office of warden of the Scotti&s;h marches. On the other hand, the earl of Rivers was elevated to the highe&s;t pinnacle of greatne&s;s. To the po&s;t of lord high trea&s;urer, which he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was added that of high con&s;table, vacant by the re&s;ignation of the earl of Worce&s;ter, whom the king created his lieute|nant in Ireland under the duke of Clarence; and the &s;urvivancy of the con&s;ta|ble's place was conferred upon the earl's &s;on Anthony Wideville. The queen's &s;i&s;ter Catherine was married to Henry duke of Buckingham; and another &s;i&s;ter called Anne matched with George &s;on and heir of the earl of Kent, for|merly Edmund lord Grey of Ruthvin: William, elde&s;t &s;on of the lord Herbert, e&s;pou&s;ing Mary a third &s;i&s;ter of the queen, was created lo$d of Dun&s;tar, and afterwards earl of Huntingdon; and his &s;i&s;ter Margaret was given in marriage to Thomas Talbot vi&s;count L'I&s;le. The&s;e honours and alliances given and contracted in favour of an ob&s;cure family, excited the hatred and envy of the commons as well as of the nobility, who could not but repine at the king's par|tiality in behalf of his wife's relations. But of all the nobility, the earl of War|wick and his brothers had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to complain of the&s;e promotions, to &s;ome of which they were more than any other per&s;ons in the kingdom in|titled,
<PB N="391" REF="4010">
by the great &s;ervices they had done to Edward. In&s;tead of being re|compenced as they de&s;erved, over and above the indelible affront offered to the earl in the affair of the lady Bona, he was excluded from all &s;hare in the admi|ni&s;tration, &s;ubjected to a &s;eries of &s;lights and in&s;ults from the queen and her kindred, who &s;eemed intent upon driving him from court, le&s;t he &s;hould one day retrieve his credit at the council; and at la&s;t, the king, by act of parlia|ment, re&s;umed all grants of lands and offices &s;ince the day of his acce&s;&s;ion, except in certain ca&s;es mentioned in &s;pecial provi&s;os, added to the act when it obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent. The&s;e were chiefly in favour of the clergy and cor|porations; but, Edward's real view in this bill, was to render the hou&s;e of Nevil dependent on his plea&s;ure, for the enjoyment of tho&s;e e&s;tates with which their &s;ervices had been rewarded. So many concurring motives could not fail to operate &s;trongly on the re&s;entment of Warwick, who was one of the proude&s;t noblemen that England ever produced: he therefore could no longer di&s;&s;emble his di&s;gu&s;t, but retired to his ca&s;tle of Middleham in York&s;hire.</P>

<P>In the mean time Edward amu&s;ed the amba&s;&s;adors of Lewis with hopes of a perpetual alliance, until the marriage between the duke of Burgundy and his &s;i&s;ter Margaret was concluded; then &s;he departed from England, accom|panied by the dutche&s;s of Exeter and Suffolk; and the nuptials were &s;olem|nized at Bruges with incredible magnificence. The remaining part of the win|ter was employed in negotiating an alliance with the duke of Brittany, under the mediation of Edward's new brother-in-law, who was &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed by the war of Liege, that he could yield very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that ally. At<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

In the beginning of Augu&s;t, the king &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to France, on pretence of treating with Lewis about a perpe|tual peace; and in le&s;s than three days after their departure, &s;ub&s;cribed a treaty, by which he obliged him&s;elf to reinforce the duke of Brittany with three thou|&s;and archers. The&s;e troops being levied, the king be&s;towed the command of them upon his brother-in-law Anthony Wideville, lord Scales, who propo&s;ed to &s;et &s;ail for Brittany in the beginning of October. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>During the&s;e negotiations at London, the dukes of Bretagne and Berry were reduced to great difficulties. The truce they had obtained of Lewi$ was almo&s;t expired; the Engli&s;h &s;uccours were not yet arrived; and the duke of Burgundy was &s;till hindered by the war of Liege, from marching to their relief. At length, however, that prince found an opportunity to bring his enemies to a battle, in which they were defeated, and obliged to &s;ue for peace; which was granted on pretty favourable conditions. Immediately after the rati$$cation of the treaty, he began his march into Picardy, and had already advanced to the banks of the Somme, when he was informed, that his allies had mad$ pe$ce with Lewis; that the duke of Berry had renounced all foreign alliances; and re&s;igned all claim upon Normandy, in con&s;ideration of a moderate pen&s;ion, and a &s;mall e&s;tate in land. Charles was not a little confounded, when he received the account of this tran&s;action: neverthele&s;s, he would not retire, but continued $ncamped in the &s;ame place; on this &s;uppo&s;ition, that as the duke of Brittany had &s;ubmitted on compul&s;ion, he would retract his eng$gements with Lewis, upon &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;o powerfully &s;upported. This re&s;olution of Ch$rl$$

alarmed the king of France, who began to fear what the other hoped; and in this apprehen&s;ion &s;et out for Picardy, to treat of an accommodation with the duke of Burgundy. That prince, uncertain with re&s;pect to the re&s;olves of the duke of Bretagne, con&s;ented to retire, on payment of four hundred thou&s;and crowns, which Lewis di&s;bur&s;ed for the expence of his expedition.</P>

<P>Hitherto the French king had &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h, in di&s;&s;olving the league which had been formed again&s;t him, and reducing his brother to an incapacity of hurting him for the future; but, &s;till he hankered after the ex|ecution of his fir&s;t project, to ruin the duke of Brittany, that he might after|wards humble the re&s;t of his nobility; and even reduce the over-grown power of the duke of Burgundy. This was his favourite &s;cheme; and &s;eemed to en|gro&s;s his whole attention &s;o much, that he was betrayed by it into the mo&s;t dangerous inadvertency. After having &s;igned his treaty with the duke of Bur|gundy, he re&s;olved to con$er with him per&s;onally; hoping, by his eloquence and in&s;inuation, to detach him intirely from the intere&s;ts of the duke of Bre|tagne: at lea&s;t, he thought he &s;hould be able to &s;ow &s;uch jealou&s;ies between the&s;e allies, as would produce an harve&s;t that would turn out to his advantage. With this view, he demanded a &s;afe-conduct from the duke, by virtue of which he might vi&s;it him at Peronne; and, this being granted, he repaired to that place with a very &s;lender retinue. Before he took this re&s;olution, he had &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to per&s;uade the inhabitants of Liege to renounce the la&s;t peace, and take arms again&s;t Charles; in which ca&s;e he promi&s;ed to &s;upply them with powerful &s;uccours. He had even forgot to recal the amba&s;&s;adors, who &s;uc|ceeded &s;o well in their negotiation, that the Ligeois immediately recommenced ho&s;tilities; and, intelligence of this was brought to Charles while the king of France was with him at Peronne. The duke of Burgundy was &s;o incen&s;ed at this double-dealing in Lewis, who&s;e aim he imagined was to &s;urprize him un|provided for his own defence, that he put the French king under arre&s;t in the ca&s;tle of Peronne; and detained him pri&s;oner for &s;ome days, during which he wavered in his re&s;olution, about the conduct he &s;hould ob&s;erve upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. Lewis, who&s;e own knavi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition taught him to dread the de|&s;igns of his enemy, remained all that time under the utmo&s;t terror and agitation; and re&s;olved to purcha&s;e his liberty, by &s;ubmitting to all the conditions that the duke &s;hould plea&s;e to impo&s;e. But, he found in Charles &s;uch genero&s;ity, as even tran&s;cended his warme&s;t hope. All that he demanded was, that Lewis &s;hould be&s;tow Champagne and Brie on his brother, the duke of Berry, in lieu of Normandy, which was granted to him by the treaty of Con$$ans; and, that he would accompany the duke in his war again&s;t the Lig$ois. In a few days after this convention, they &s;et out together for the country of Liege; and, Lewis had the mortification to be an eye-witne&s;s of the de&s;truction of the ca|pital city, which he him&s;elf had in&s;tigated to its own ruin. At length he ob|t$ined<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ph$$. d$ Co|mmes.</NOTE> his liberty, after having undergone the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing his life, or being detained in perpetual impri&s;onment.</P>

<P>About this period, Edward renewed the antient alliance between England and Arragon; &s;o that being at peace with almo&s;t all the princes of the continent, he had nothing to fear but from dome&s;tic troubles; and of the&s;e he &s;eemed to have but little apprehen&s;ion: tho' a &s;pirit of di&s;content began to diffu&s;e it&s;elf through the nation, which was di&s;gu&s;ted by the pride and in&s;o|lence

of the queen's relations. Sir Thomas Cooke, who had been mayor of London, was accu&s;ed of trea&s;on by one Hawkins, a &s;ervant to lord Wenlock, and arre&s;ted; but, bailed at the reque&s;t of the prince&s;s Margaret, before her marriage with the duke of Burgundy: after her departure, he was again ap|prehended, and &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower; and his hou&s;e and effects, to a very con&s;iderable value, were &s;eized by the earl of Rivers, as trea&s;urer of England. After having lain a long time in pri&s;on, he was tried and acquitted by &s;everal juries, tho' not relea&s;ed: then a bill being found again&s;t him, for mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, he was committed to the Counter, and from thence conveyed to the King's Bench in Southwark. There he continued for a long time, while the &s;ervants of Rivers plundered his hou&s;es, until he purcha&s;ed his liberty with eight thou&s;and pounds, by way of fine to the king for his offence. Nor was this the end of his per&s;ecution. The queen demanded an hundred marks for every thou&s;and pounds of his fine; and this exaction he was obliged to pay, over and above large pre&s;ents to her council. His accu&s;er, with &s;ome others, was afterwards hanged at Tyburn, for corre&s;ponding with Margaret of Anjou and the duke of Somer&s;et. He was apprehended on the information of a &s;ervant belonging to Robert Whittingham, taken at Queenborough with letters from France.

<P>The earl of Warwick him&s;elf incurred the like imputation. The family of the Widevilles had u&s;ed all their endeavours to render this nobleman &s;u&s;pected to the king, who had, indeed, very little rea&s;on to confide in his at|tachment, con&s;idering the ingratitude with which his &s;ervices had been repayed. He had even attempted to debauch the earl's daughter, one of the mo&s;t beau|tiful young ladies, and the riche&s;t heire&s;s in England: an in&s;ult, for which he never could hope forgivene&s;s from a man of Warwick's character. One would be apt to imagine, that the king and his new mini&s;try practi&s;ed every method they could devi&s;e to provoke the earl to a declaration, which would free them from a di&s;agreeable &s;u&s;pence; and furni&s;h them with a pretext to complete his de&s;truc|tion. Ja&s;per earl of Pembroke arrived with a &s;mall body of troops from France, and landing near Ha$dlegh in Merioneth&s;hire, which was &s;till occupied by the Lanca&s;trians, was joined by a con&s;iderable number of the natives. With the&s;e he ravaged great part of North Wales, and burned the town of Denbigh; but, was encountered and defeated by Sir Richard Herbert. After this action, Hardlegh ca&s;tle &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; and, Sir Richard Tonftal, Sir Henry Bellingham, Sir William Stoke, and about fifty other gentlemen, being taken in it, were &s;ent pri&s;oners to the Tower of London, where two of the number, condemned by the earl of Rivers as con&s;table of England, were beheaded. With the&s;e Herbert, who was for this &s;ervice created earl of Pembroke, &s;ent a per&s;on who had brought letters from Margaret of Anjou; and he, in order to &s;ave his life, impeached, among others, the earl of Warwick; tho' the whole charge amounted to no more than that he had heard beyond &s;ea, the earl fa|voured the cau&s;e of Margaret and her hu&s;band. Commi&s;&s;aries were &s;ent down to Middleham to examine him, and they found the accu&s;ation groundle&s;s; tho' this fre&s;h in&s;ult gave a keener edge to his re&s;entment.</P>

Warwick. With this view Edward &s;et out for Nottingham, where he effected an accommodation between the archbi&s;hop of York and the earl of Rivers; a great council was afterwards held at Coventry, to which that prelate brought his brother Warwick, and reconciled him to the lords Herbert, Staf$ord, and Audeley. The king was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the archbi&s;hop's conduct on this occa&s;ion, that he re&s;tored to him the manor of Denley, and other lands which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wyrceftre. Rymer.</NOTE> he had lo&s;t by the act of re&s;umption. The accommodation between Warwick and tho&s;e noblemen was &s;o far from being &s;incere, that as &s;oon as the cere|mony was over, the earl repaired to his government of Calais, in order to ex|ecute a &s;cheme of revenge which he had already projected. He knew that George duke of Clarence, the king's brother, was incen&s;ed again&s;t Edward and his mini&s;try, who had excluded him from all advantageous offices, and all &s;hare in the admini&s;tration; and, as he was, after Elizabeth, pre&s;umptive heir to the crown, Warwick re&s;olved to engage him in his intere&s;t. For this purpo&s;e he offered to him his daughter I&s;abel in marriage, and Clarence readily embraced an alliance that would put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the riche$t and mo&s;t beautiful young ladies in England. This match alarmed Edward, who en|deavoured to prevent it by intrigues and remon&s;trances at the court of Rome, to which the parties had applied for a di&s;pen&s;ation: but, by this time, Warwick had entered into a private negotiation with the French king, by who&s;e influence the di&s;pen&s;ation was obtained, and the marriage celebrated in the church of Notre Dame at Calais.</P>

<P>While Warwick re&s;ided in this place, he &s;eems to have felt the pul&s;e of the Engli&s;h nation, by employing his emi&s;&s;aries to excite an in&s;urrection in York&s;hire. The people refu&s;ing to contribute to the maintenance of the an|tient ho&s;pital of St. Leonard near York, they were pro&s;ecuted at law, and their effects di&s;trained; and as they imagined the ho&s;pital &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by voluntary con|tribution, they looked upon tho&s;e &s;uits as the effect of oppre&s;&s;ion. This di&s;|content was fomented to &s;uch a degree, that they took to their arms, and a&s;&s;em|bling to the number of fifteen thou&s;and, began their march to the city of York, which was overwhelmed with con&s;ternation, until Warwick's brother Montague threw him&s;elf into the town with a &s;mall body of choice &s;oldiers; and, in a &s;ally, took Robert Hillyard their chieftain, commonly called Robin of Reddi&s;dale, whom he ordered to immediate execution. The pea&s;ants were not di&s;couraged by this di&s;a&s;ter; but, choo&s;ing Sir Henry Nevil, &s;on of lord Latimer, and Sir John Conyers, for their leaders, they advanced to Dane&s;more in Northampton&s;hire, about three miles from Banbury. The king had ordered the earl of Pembroke to march again&s;t them, at the head of twelve thou&s;and Wel&s;hmen, and they were joined by Humphrey Stafford, lately created earl of Devon, at the head of five thou&s;and archers; but, the two chiefs quarrelling about lodgings at Banbury, they &s;eparated forces, and Pembroke hazarding an engagement, was defeated and &s;lain. Sir Henry Nevil had been taken in a &s;kirmi&s;h on the eve of the battle, and killed in cold blood; a circum&s;tance which exa&s;perated the York&s;hire men to &s;uch a degree, that they gave no quar|ter to the Wel&s;h, five thou&s;and of whom were &s;lain on the field, or in the pur&s;uit. The earl of Devon was &s;eized in his return by the king's order, and beheaded at Bridgwater; and Richard earl of Rivers, with his &s;on John, being taken at Gra&s;ton, by a detachment of the rebel army, lo&s;t their heads at Northampton, by command of Sir John Conyers, who, without

<P>Whether Edward was ignorant of this connexion, or thought proper to temporize, certain it is, that when Warwick, and his &s;on-in-law Clarence, arrived in England, and offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the tranquillity of the kingdom, he received them with an appearance of &s;atis|faction, creating Warwick chief ju&s;ticiary of South Wales, con&s;table of the ca&s;tle of Cardigan, and &s;ene&s;chal of all the courts and fore&s;ts in the &s;hires of Carmarthen and Cardigan, offices vacant by the death of the earl of Pembroke. The king was likewi&s;e per&s;uaded to grant a general pardon to Conyers and his followers, $ho had by this time increa&s;ed to &s;ixty thou&s;and. As the nation in general was di&s;contented, and Margaret of Anjou, with her &s;on and a &s;mall body of troops, reported to be at Harfleur in Normandy, ready to embark, and take advantage of the commotions in England, commi&s;&s;ions of array were i&s;&s;ued for rai&s;ing the militia of Norfolk, Suffolk, and other maritime counties; and the queen's brother Anthony, now earl of Rivers, was &s;ent to &s;ea, with a &s;trong &s;quadron to prevent any attempts of the enemy. Whatever<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe. Fabian.</NOTE> were the king's &s;entiments towards Warwick, he &s;eems to have been bent upon making a friend of his brother Montague, perhaps with a view to le&s;&s;en the power of the earl, which was very formidable. In a great council held on the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1470.</NOTE> &s;ixth day of November, Edward a&s;ked the advice of the prelates and nobility, about providing an hu&s;band for his daughter Elizabeth, heir to the crown of England; and they unanimou&s;ly concurred in recommending George, the &s;on of Montague, as the mo&s;t proper match for the young prince&s;s. Their &s;enti|ments on this &s;ubject being agreeable to tho&s;e of Edward, he, by letters patent, advanced that young nobleman to the dignity of duke of Bedford. Such a te&s;timony of the king's favour could not but be agreeable to Warwick and his brothers, who began again to live in a friendly corre&s;pondence with Edward, until it was interrupted by an artifice of the mini&s;try, who dreaded the revival of that family's intere&s;t. The king, while he re&s;ided at Langley in Hertford|&s;hire, was invited by the archbi&s;hop of York to an entertainment, at his &s;eat of More-park in that neighbourhood; and while the gue&s;ts were employed, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of the time, in wa&s;hing hands before &s;upper, John Ra$|cliffe, afterwards lord Fitzwalter, told the king privately, that the archb$$hop had a&s;&s;embled an hundred men at arms, to &s;eize and convey his maje&s;ty to the ca&s;tle of Middleham. Edward, alarmed at this intelligence, which was feigned for the purpo&s;e, made a pretence to go out; and mounting his hor&s;e, rode at full &s;peed to Wind$or. Such an abrupt retreat was con&s;trued into a gro&s;s af|front by the archbi&s;hop as well as by Warwick, and his &s;on-in-law Clarence, who imagined it was a concerted &s;cheme to $ix the imputation of perfidy on them and their adherents: the former animo&s;ity was rekindled by this circum|&s;tance, and both &s;ides reproached one another with great bitterne&s;s.</P>

<P>Cicely, dutche&s;s of York, the king's mother, endeavoured to ef|fect a reconciliation, and they met in her hou&s;e of Baynard's ca&s;tle; but their mutual jealou&s;y was too deeply fixed to be eradicated at this interview. Never|thele&s;s, Edward impowered Clarence and Warwick to array men in the counties of Warwick and Worce&s;ter, in order to &s;uppre&s;s an in&s;urrection in Lincoln&s;hire, headed by Robert, the &s;on of Richard lord Willes, Sir Thomas Dymock, and
<PB N="396" REF="4060">
Sir Thomas de la Launde. The pretext for this commotion was the conduct of Sir Thomas Burgh, an o$$icer of the king's hou&s;hold, who had oppre&s;&s;ed the people$ though it afterwards appeared that Warwick and Clarence had in|&s;tigated the leaders to rai&s;e the di&s;turbance.

They &s;et out accordingly; but being informed on the road that the king was incen&s;ed again&s;t them as the authors of the ri&s;ing, they took re$uge in the &s;anctuary at We&s;tmin&s;ter, from whence they were drawn by the king's promi&s;e of pardon; and the lord Willes, by Edward's command, wrote a letter to his &s;on, de&s;iring he would lay down his arms, and &s;ubmit to the king's mercy. To this injunc|tion, however, Robert payed no regard; and Edward, advancing with an army again&s;t him to Staniford, was &s;o incen&s;ed at his ob&s;tinacy, that he ordered his father and Dymock to be beheaded. This act of barbarity enraged him to &s;uch a degree, that although his army con&s;i&s;ted of raw, undi&s;ciplined troops, and he expected to be joined by Warwick and Clarence, who had already a&s;|&s;embled a &s;trong body of forces, he re&s;olved to revenge his father's death without delay, and attacked Edward with incredible fury, on the fourteenth day of March. The battle was maintained for &s;ome time with equal re&s;olution on both &s;ides: but, at length, the rebels were obliged to yield to the di&s;cipline and valour of the royal army, and were defeated with great &s;laughter.

In order to facilitate that junction, they employed emi&s;&s;aries to alarm them with reports that the king intended to revoke the pardon he had granted: they were di&s;appointed however in both expectations. Stanley refu&s;ed to em|bark in their undertaking, and the king got the &s;tart of them in York&s;hire; where he publi&s;hed a proc$amation confirming the former amne&s;ty. The two chi$fs, being thus di&s;appointed, retired to the we&s;tern parts of England; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry$er. Frag. Ed. IV. $word$ 10 Ed.

While Clarence and Warwick were employed in Devon&s;hire, in equipping a number of ve&s;&s;els to convey them and their families to Calais, Edward obliged Warwick's brother, John Nevil, to re&s;ign what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Piercy e&s;tate, with his patent for the honour of Northumberland; and, by way of recompence, created him marquis of Montacute. In con$equence of his re&s;ignation, Henry Piercy was declared earl of Northumberland, re&s;tored to all his e&s;tate, and appointed warden of the Ea&s;t and Middle Marches towards Scotland. John Tiptot, earl of Worce&s;ter, and con&s;table of England for life, was con&s;tituted lord-lieutenant of Ireland, in the room of the duke of Clarence; and a price &s;et upon the heads of that prince and his father-in-law the earl of Warwick. At the &s;ame time the king pub|li&s;hed a declaration, repre&s;enting that George duke of Clarence, and Richard earl of Warwick, had formed an unnatural de&s;ign to dethrone his maje&s;ty;
<PB N="397" REF="4070">
that they had encouraged Sir Robert Willes in his rebellion, with promi&s;e of &s;uccours, as appeared from the confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid Sir Robert and Sir Tho|mas de la Launde; that the king had &s;ummoned the duke and earl to his pre|&s;ence, to clear them&s;elves of tho&s;e accu&s;ations; but, in&s;tead of obeying his order, they had marched into Lanca&s;hire, in order to rai&s;e a greater number of forces, with which they hoped to execute their treacherous de&s;igns: that, notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e repeated acts of rebellion, he was &s;till willing to forgive them, on their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and giving &s;ureties for their future behaviour; and therefore &s;ummoned them to appear before him by the twenty-eighth day of March, on pain of being denounced rebels and traitors. As they paid no regard to this declaration, another was actually publi&s;hed at Nottingham, on the thirty-fir&s;t day of March, declaring them rebels and traitors; offering rewards for taking them, and prohibiting all per&s;ons, on the &s;evere&s;t penalties, from a&s;&s;i&s;ting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clau&s;. 10 Ed.

<P>That his brother and Warwick might not have time to a&s;&s;emble an army in the We&s;t, Edward marched thither with great expedition; and from Exeter i&s;&s;ued commi&s;&s;ions to the earl of Wilts, the lord Mountjoye, Sir John Forte&s;cue, and others, for arraying men in Devon and Cornwall: but before the&s;e troops could be a&s;&s;embled, Clarence and Warwick embarked at Dart|mouth. When they attempted to enter the harbour of Calais, the cannon of the place began to play upon them; &s;o that they were obliged to &s;tand out to &s;ea; and the dutche&s;s of Clarence falling in labour, was delivered of a &s;on named Edward, who was afterwards earl of Warwick. The grandfather of this child was not a little mortified at this treatment from his own lieutenant Vaucler, a Ga&s;con, who was prevailed upon to con&s;ent to the inf$nt's being chri&s;tened in the place, and found means to let the earl know the meaning of his unexpected behaviour. The place was not provided for a &s;iege again&s;t the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. de Co|mines.</NOTE> power of Edward and the duke of Burgundy: the inhabitants were apprehen|&s;ive of lo&s;ing their trade; and the lord of Duras, who was Warwick's enemy, commanded a good part of the garri&s;on. Vaucler therefore advi&s;ed the earl to retire into France; and depend upon his fidelity. Perhaps this Ga&s;con played a double game, and re&s;olved to declare for the &s;tronge&s;t: but in the mean time his behaviour was very agreeable to Edward, who gratified him with the government of the place; while a pen&s;ion of a thou&s;and crowns was &s;ettled on him by the duke of Burgundy. Warwick, being obliged to admit of his excu&s;es, $ailed for Normandy, and landed at Honfleur, where he was courteou&s;ly received by the ba&s;tard of Bourbon, lieutenant-general of the pro|vince; from thence he and his &s;on-in-law &s;et out for the court of France at Amboi&s;e, where he met with a very favourable reception.</P>

<P>Lewis would not intermeddle in the affairs of England, while the crown was in di&s;pute between Edward and Henry: but now that Edward had contracted &s;uch a firm alliance with the duke of Burgundy, his intere&s;t prompted him to effect the ruin of both, and his intere&s;t on this occa&s;ion co-operated with his de&s;ire of revenging the affront he had received from Edward in the affair of the marriage. Be&s;ides, the &s;uccours which that monarch intended for the duke of Brittany, plainly demon&s;trated, that while he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the throne of England, the princes of France would always have recour&s;e to his protection. All the&s;e con&s;iderations concurred in favour of the Engli&s;h fugitives, to

whom he promi$$d a very powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance. That the civil war, which he hoped to kindle in England, might rage with the greater violence, he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to reconcile Margaret of Anjou and Warwick; and in the mean time &s;ent for Margaret, who had retired to the habitation of her father. She looked upon Warwick as the author of all the mi&s;eries to which &s;he and her family had been &s;ubjected; and the mo&s;t rancorous and inveterate enmity &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between them: neverthele&s;s the accommodation was ea&s;ily effected, be|cau&s;e they &s;tood in need of each other. Warwick wanted a pretext for de|throning Edward, and the mo&s;t plau&s;ible he could u&s;e was the re&s;toration of Henry, which he could not undertake without the queen's concurrence. Mar|garet, on the other hand, &s;aw no pro&s;pect of the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of her family, b$t in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Warwick; and therefore made no &s;cruple to a&s;k the pro|t$ction of her antient adver&s;ary. Lewis managed the treaty between them, which was concluded, on condition that the duke of Clarence and the earl of Warwick &s;hould exert all their endeavours for Henry's re&s;toration; that the queen &s;hould engage upon oath to leave the admini&s;tration in their hands, du|$ing the life of Henry, or the minority of his &s;on, in ca&s;e of his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne before $e &s;hould be of age; and that the prince of Wales &s;hould marry Anne, the younger daughter of the earl of Warwick.

<P>The duke of Burgundy, being informed by his &s;pies of this tr$n&s;action, tran&s;mitted an account of it to Edward, who payed very little regard to the intimation; believing that the earl of Warwick, who had been obliged to quit the kingdom for want of proper &s;upport, could never in his ab&s;ence excite the people of England to rebel in his favour. He was not at all alarmed by the preparations in France, becau&s;e he thought England could not be con|quered by any foreign nation, unle&s;s the people &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in $n&s;laving them|&s;$lves; and rea&s;oning upon very precarious principles, namely, the affection of his &s;ubjects for his per&s;on and government, and Warwick's want of intere&s;t, he took no manner of precautions in his own defence, but indulged him&s;elf in all the plea&s;ures of effeminacy and volup$uou&s;ne&s;s. While $e abandoned him&s;elf to the&s;e delights, his mini&s;try gratified their private re&s;entment by committing acts of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, which ruin$d the character of their ma&s;ter. John Clapham, one of Warwick's officers, with about twenty other gentlemen, being taken in a naval &s;kirmi&s;h near Southampton, were condemned as traitors by the earl of Worce&s;ter, con&s;table of England, and executed with &s;uch circum&s;tances of barbarity as filled the &s;pectators with horror. All per|&s;ons of any con&s;ideration, &s;u&s;pected of affection to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, were pro&s;ecuted, plundered, and forced into &s;anctuary or exile; a great number of the&s;e refugees retired to France, and gave an account of the temper of the na|tion to the earl of Warwick, whom they pre&s;&s;ed to embark for his own country, where all &s;orts of people ardently wi&s;hed for his return. What contributed more than any other con&s;ideration to Edward's &s;ecurity, was the &s;ucce&s;s of a private negotiation, into which he had entered with his brother Clarence. He won over to his intere&s;t a female dome&s;tic and favourite of the dutche&s;s; and, after having tutor$d her for his purpo&s;e, granted her a pa&s;&s;port, by virtue of which &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea unmole&s;ted to her mi&s;tre&s;s. She took the fir&s;t oppor|tunity
<PB N="399" REF="4090">
of executing her commi&s;&s;ion, repre&s;enting to the duke, in the name of his brother Edward, that by e&s;pou&s;ing the party of Warwick he contributed to his own ruin; for, if the de&s;igns of that nobleman &s;hould &s;ucceed, he could not imagine that the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter would place any confidence in a prince of the family of York; or even &s;uffer him to live, after they &s;hould have effected their pur|po&s;es: that, far from depending upon the oath of Margaret, he ought to con&s;i|der it as a &s;hare laid for his de&s;truction; the earl of Warwick would be the fir&s;t to cru&s;h him, not only to remove a rival in the admini&s;tration, but al&s;o to de|liver him&s;elf from the de&s;igns of a prince, who might one day be in a condition to return the wrongs of his family: that his brother Edward having but one child, and that an infant, which death might remove, he was next heir to the crown; whereas, &s;hould the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter be re&s;tored, he mu&s;t re&s;ign all hopes of attaining that dignity, as Henry's &s;on was healthy and vigorous, and would in all probability have a numerous i&s;&s;ue. The&s;e arguments were rein|forced by the con&s;iderations of con&s;anguinity, and warm profe&s;&s;ions and promi&s;es from Edward in behalf of his brother Clarence; who being naturally ea&s;y, fickle, and irre&s;olute, was convinced by the&s;e in&s;inuations; and de&s;ired the agent to let the king his brother know, that he would not fail to declare in his favour, whenever an opportunity &s;hould offer of doing him any con&s;iderable piece of &s;ervice. Edward was made acquainted with this declaration, which entirely ba|ni&s;hed every anxious reflexion; and he gave a loo&s;e to his plea&s;ures, in full con|fidence that all Warwick's efforts would prove abortive, as he was no longer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Biondi.

<P>While Edward lived in this deceitful &s;ecurity, the earl, having received a &s;mall &s;upply in money and troops from Lewis, prepared for his voyage to Eng|land, under the convoy of &s;ome French &s;hips of war, commanded by the ba&s;tard of Bourbon. The duke of Burgundy however blocked up the mouth of the Seine with a much more numerous fleet, in order to intercept Warwick, whom he affected to con&s;ider as a pirate; becau&s;e, in his pa&s;&s;age from Calais to Hon|fleur, he had taken and &s;old fome Flemi&s;h ve&s;&s;els. Notwith&s;tanding all the duke's precautions for preventing the earl's voyage, that nobleman repaired to Havre de Grace, and taking the opportunity of a &s;torm that di&s;per&s;ed the Bur|gundian &s;quadron, embarked and landed &s;afely at Dartmouth, in the month of September. Edward rejoiced at his de&s;cent, in full per&s;ua&s;ion that his de&s;ign mu&s;t mi&s;carry, and his antagoni&s;t fall into his hands. In the&s;e &s;entiments he de&s;ired the duke of Burgundy would order his fleet to keep the &s;ea, to intercept Warwick, in ca&s;e he &s;hould attempt to make his e&s;cape; but he &s;oon per|ceived the folly of his expectation. Warwick, immediately after his landing, was joined by &s;uch numbers of his countrymen, that in a few days he found him&s;elf at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and fighting men, with whom he began his march again&s;t Edward, who had made a progre&s;s into the North, to quell an in|&s;urrection rai&s;ed in York&s;hire by the lord Fitzhugh, married to Alice, &s;i&s;ter of the earl of Warwick. His de&s;ign, in all probability, was to make a di|ver&s;ion in favour of his brother-in-law; and in this he &s;ucceeded. At the king's approach he retired to Scotland, and Edward repaired to York, where he fir&s;t heard that Warwick had landed and proclaimed Henry VI. king of Eng|land; publi&s;hing at the &s;ame time an order to all his &s;ubjects, from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty, to take arms again&s;t Edward, and expel the u&s;urper.</P>

<P>The king immediately advanced as far as Nottingham, in his way to London; but, Warwick being re&s;olved to engage him before he &s;hould reach that capital, where he knew he was very popular, came in &s;ight of him within three miles of Nottingham, and prepared for battle. Edward was &s;o weak as to depend upon the fidelity of the marquis of Montacute, tho' the brother of his adver&s;ary, and a nobleman whom he had &s;o lately injured by depriving him of the great e&s;tate and honour of Northumberland. He had rai&s;ed &s;ix thou&s;and men, with whom he followed the king at &s;ome di&s;tance, as if his intention had been to reinforce his maje&s;ty; but, his real aim was to join his brother, and he had already conce$$$d the affair with his officers. When he therefore under&s;tood that Warwick was &s;o near the royali&s;ts, he quickened his march, in order to fall upon the $ear of Edward, who had no intimation of his de&s;ign until he was within two leagues of his camp, and the air refounded with the cries of Long live King Henry. In this emergency he called a coun|cil of war, in which the lord Ha&s;tings gave it as his opinion, that great part of the army would revolt to the earl of Warwick; or that even$ tho' they &s;hould do their duty, they would not be able to cope with the rebels, &s;ince this defection of Montacute. He therefore advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty to provide for his per&s;onal &s;afety, by retreating to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where he might find an opportunity to e&s;cape into Holland. As there was no time to be lo&s;t, Edward, in compliance with this advice, &s;et out at midnight for Lynne, without money or baggage, at|tended by eight hundred light hor&s;e: finding in the harbour of that town two or three &s;hips bound for Holland, he in&s;tantly embarked with his brother Glouce&s;ter, and a &s;mall retinue; and, after having narrowly e&s;caped a fleet of Ea&s;terlings, landed at Alkmar. In the morning after Edward's retreat, his army &s;ubmitted to Warwick, who forthwith directed his march to London, which he entered in triumph on the &s;ixth day of October, and removed Hen|ry VI. from the Tower to the bi&s;hop's palace; while Edward's queen took re|fuge<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe.

In con&s;equence of this &s;urpri&s;ing revolution, which had been effected in eleven days, without blood&s;hed, all the judges, &s;heriffs, and coro|ners, of the kingdom were changed: Lan&s;trother prior of St. John's was ap|pointed trea&s;urer; the chancellor's office was conferred on the archbi&s;hop of York; the earl of Warwick was created admiral of England; and the duke of Clarence con&s;tituted lord lieutenant of Ireland. On this occa&s;ion no life was taken but that of John Tiptot earl of Worce&s;ter, who &s;eems to have been &s;a|crificed to the public hatred, as a corrupted mini&s;ter, and a mon&s;ter of cruelty, for which he was &s;o remarkable, that he acquired the appellation of John the Butcher. Being taken on the top of an high tree in the fore&s;t of Wavebrig, in Huntingdon&s;hire, he was brought to London, tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall by John carl of Oxford, convicted of high trea&s;on, condemned, and beheaded on Tower-Hill. Writs were i&s;&s;ued for &s;ummoning a parliament, which met on the twenty-&s;ixth day of November. Edward was declared a traitor and u&s;ur|per, his e&s;tate and effects were confi&s;cated; all &s;tatutes made by his authority re|pealed; and the duke of Glouce&s;ter, and all his adherents, attainted.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Engl$nd, the fugitive Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1471$</NOTE> met with a very cold reception from his brother-in-l$w the duke of Burgu$dy, who would have been much better plea&s;ed with the news of his death, than with th$ account of his exile. While the king of Engl$$d remained at the Hague, living $t the expence of the lord of Gruthuy&s;en, extremely morti$ied at the duke's coldne&s;s and neglect, that prince found him&s;elf involved in the utmo&s;t p$rpl$xity. Lewis XI. had declared war ag$in&s;t him, and &s;eized St. Quintin and Amiens; and now that Edward was expelled from his throne, he was afr$$d of intailing upon him&s;elf the joint $$mity of France and England, &s;hould he a&s;&s;i&s;t the exiled monarch. The dukes of Som$r&s;et and Exeter, who &s;till continued at his court, pre&s;&s;ed him &s;trongly to abandon Edward, and even threaten$d him with the ind$gnation of Henry, &s;hould $e protect, or patronize the fugitive; and the earl of Warwi$k had already &s;$nt a body of troops to Calais, that they might be at hand to join the French, and invade &s;ome pro|vince of the Low Countries. When the duke &s;ent Philip de Comin$$ to Ca|lais, to confirm the commercial truce betwee$ the inhabitants of that town and his Flemi&s;h &s;ubjects, he found Vau$$er the governor with his garti&s;on, and all the burghers, wearing Warwick's device, and profe&s;&s;ing their attachment to king Henry. Seeing no other way of &s;ucceeding in his negotiation, he ob&s;erved, that the truce having been made with England, and not with the per&s;on of Edward, it ought not to be affected by the revolution in England; and as the nation was very much intere&s;ted in this trade, the truce was upon the&s;e princi|ples, renewed.</P>

<P>Edward, impatient of his &s;ituation, after his &s;i$$er the dutche&s;s of Burgundy had in vain &s;olli$ited her hu&s;band to take &s;ome vigorous &s;teps in his favour, demanded an interview with that prince, which he could not with any decency re$$&s;e. At this conference, he rep$e&s;ented that delays would be ex|tremely prejudicial to his intere&s;t, as his f$$ends and adh$r$nts in England would drop off, while Warwick would be every day more and more &s;treng$h|ened in the power and authority he had u&s;urped; that therefore, the duke ought either to a&s;&s;i&s;t him immediately, or abandon him intirely to his evil fortune. In order to reinforce this remon&s;trance, he imparted to him the engagement he had contracted with his brother Clarence: he reminded him of the o$th by which he had bound him&s;elf to contribute his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in c$$e it &s;hould be wanted by Edward: he de&s;ired him to con$$der, that in a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in hi$ di&s;tre&s;s, he would act f$r the benefit of his own family, which might one day need &s;uppo$t and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and at the &s;ame time have the glory of re|&s;toring

a brother-in-law to his throne. He &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to unite with him in the clo&s;$&s;t con$exion again&s;t France, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be re-e&s;ta|b$$&s;hed; a$d ob&s;erved$ that the neutrality which the duke had hitherto ob|&s;erved, could an&s;wer no purpo&s;e for his advantage, no$ even hinder Lewis and<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$$i$es.</NOTE> the earl of Warwick from taking mea&s;ures for his de&s;truction. This expo&s;tu|lation had an effect upon the duke of Burgundy; and, though he was &s;till afraid of furni&s;hing Warwick with a pretext to attack his domi$ions, he contrived an expedient, by which he was enabled to accommodate the $ugitive king, with|o$t runni$g the ri&s;que of a rupture with that $ormidable nobleman. He pri|vately adv$nced a &s;$m of money to certain individu$$s, who equipped $our large ve&s;&s;els at Terveer, which was a free port in Zealand; and engaged fourteen &s;hips b$longing to the Ea&s;terlings, to convoy Edward to England, on the coa$t of which they were directed to remain fifteen d$ys after his landing, in order to carry him back, in ca&s;e his efforts &s;hould not be attended with &s;uc|ce$s. The king of England being thus &s;upplied with &s;hips and money, em|barked at Terveer; and he had no &s;ooner di&s;appeared from Holland, than the duke of Burgundy, by pro$lamation, prohibited all his &s;ubjects, on pain of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry$er.</NOTE> from a&s;&s;i&s;ting him directly or indirectly. But, if the &s;cheme of Edward had proved abortive, this artifice would not have deceived the earl of Warwick, who at this period, concluded a long truce with Lewis, to &s;erve in lieu of an alliance, which could not be immediately effected on account of Henry's pre|ten&s;ions to the crown of France; and at the &s;ame time, the earl &s;ent the great prior o$ the order of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, to conduct queen Margaret and the prince of Wales from France into England.</P>

<P>Edward &s;ailing from Terveer, with the lords Ha&s;tings, Say, and about fi$teen hundred men, partly Engli&s;h, and partly Fl$mings, attempted to land on the coa&s;t of E&s;&s;ex; but, being repul&s;ed by a brother of the earl of Oxford, he &s;tood away to the northward, and made a de&s;cent at Raven&s;pur in York&s;hire, abou$ the latter end of March, hoping, that he &s;hould be joined by the people of tho&s;e parts, as &s;oon as he &s;hould produce the letters of invitation he had received from the earl of Northumberland. B$t, he met with a very cold reception; and the inhabitants of Holderne&s;&s;e took up arms to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. He likewi&s;e under&s;tood by his emi&s;&s;aries, that the citizens of York were not at all di&s;po&s;ed to receive him as &s;overeign of England. He therefore profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a liegeman to king Henry, wore the badge of the prince of Wales, which was an o&s;trich feather; and declared, that all he demanded was the dutchy of his father. Tru&s;ting to the effect of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, and the affection of the people of York, of which he was intirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, although the magi&s;trates were devoted to Warwick, he marched towards that city, and was vi&s;ited by a deputation of the aldermen, who de&s;ired that he would choo&s;e another road, that they might not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of refu&s;ing him ad|mittance. He now again repeated his former declaration, touching his demand; and expo&s;tulated with them in a mode&s;t manner, upon the cruelty of refu&s;ing him admittance into a city, from which he derived his title, and on which he had conferred &s;o many benefits; but, he depended more upon the attachment of the inhabitants, than the power of his eloquence; and he was not di&s;ap|pointed in his expectation. His parti&s;ans excited a commotion in the city, and the magi&s;trates went forth again to offer him the keys, and &s;tipulate for

<P>The news of Edward's landing had no &s;ooner reached the court of Henry, than commi&s;&s;ions of array were i&s;&s;ued to the duke of Clarence, and the earls of Warwick and Pembroke, for rai&s;ing forces to repel the invader: the marquis of Montacute, who had been lately appointed warden of the Scotti&s;h Marches, received an order to intercept Edward in his march to York, and engage him before he &s;hould be in a condition to fight with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Whether this nobleman had entered into any new engage|ment with Edward, or wavered in his re&s;olutions between a weak prince already on the throne, and a powerful competitor, with whom he hoped one day to be joined by the alliance of that marriage which had been formerly projected; certain it is, he remained quiet in his camp at Pontefract, and allowed Edward to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted, within four miles of his &s;tation. When this prince arrived at Not|tingham, he was joined by Sir William Stanley, Sir William Parr, Sir Thomas Burgh, Sir William Norris, and a great number of other gentlemen, with their va&s;&s;als. This junction encouraged him to publi&s;h his claim to the crown; and his number was every hour augmented, during his progre&s;s towards Lon|don. Mean while, the earl of Warwick having levied a body of troops, ad|vanced to Leice&s;ter, in order to join his brother Montacute, and receiving in|telligence that Edward had taken the route to Coventry, he marched thither, with a view to hazard an engagement. When the two armies were in &s;ight of each other, the earl received a letter from the duke of Clarence, giving him to under&s;tand that he was on the march to join him, and de&s;iring, he would not give Edward battle until he &s;hould arrive with his forces. In compliance with this reque&s;t, Warwick altered his re&s;olution, and allowed his antagoni&s;t to proceed to London, believing that city would hold out until he &s;hould advance to its relief. This was a very flagrant piece of mi&s;conduct, even &s;uppo&s;ing him ignorant of the intelligence which the enemy carried on with the Londoners, as well as of the treachery of his own relations: he ought to have known, that the rich merchants, who had formerly lent &s;ums of money to Edward, had $o other pro&s;pect of payment than that of his re&s;toration; that all the ladies were devoted to a prince of his gallantry and per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, and would nece&s;&s;arily influence their hu&s;bands and kindred in his behalf; that the archbi|&s;hop of Canterbury, the earl of E&s;&s;ex, with &s;ome other prelates and noblem$n, were well-wi&s;hers to his cau&s;e; and, that the &s;anctuaries and franchi&s;es of Lon|don and We&s;tmin&s;ter contained above two thou&s;and of his parti&s;ans, including four hundred knights and gentlemen, ready to take arms in his favour. Perhaps all the&s;$ advantages might have proved ineffectual, had the archbi&s;hop of York, to who&s;e care the per&s;on of Henry, and the city of London were committed, been true to the intere&s;t of his brother Warwick. But, he had by this time made his

peace with Edward, who, by his connivance, was admitt$d into the city, and &s;e$zed king Henry in the palace of the bi&s;hop o$ London.

<P>Mean while Warwick being joined by his &s;on-in-law Cl$rence and his brother Montacu$e, advanced towards London; and, on the thirteenth day o$ April, encamped on a heath in the neighbourhood of Barnet, the $own it|&s;elf being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the troops of Edward, who had marched thither from London to give him battle, in con&s;equence of a me&s;&s;age he had received from Clarence, importing that he would join him with all his forces. In the night that preceded the action, Richard duke of Glouce&s;t$r repa$red without any &s;afe|guard to the tent of Clarence, where the two brothers embraced with all the marks of the mo&s;t cordial affection; and after &s;ome private di&s;cour&s;e, they went off together towards Edw$rd's camp, with abo$t twelve thou&s;and fol|lowers. Immediately after this &s;candalous de&s;ertion, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to Warwick to excu&s;e the part he had acted, and tell him he had made his peace with Edward, who had promi&s;ed to pardon him upon his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But the earl rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain, either believing Edward in&s;incere in his promi$e, or that he him&s;elf was &s;till able to cope with him in the field of battle. In all probability, his brother Montacute had found means to convince him of his $$de$ity, and was by this time determined to act heartily again&s;t Edward; otherwi&s;e he would, on this occa&s;ion, have imitated the example of Clarence. Early in the morning of the fourteenth day of April, the action began with in|credible fury on both &s;ides, which were ex$&s;perated again&s;t each other to the mo&s;t virulent degree of rancour, that &s;lighted friend&s;hip, per&s;onal animo&s;ity, and civil war, could produce. The troops of Warwic$, though inferior in number to the enemy, fought with a kind of de&s;perate re&s;olution, fore&s;eeing they &s;hould be treated as rebe$s if vanqui&s;hed; and the earl him&s;elf was deter|mined to conquer or die. Such was th$ir impetuo&s;ity that Edward's fir&s;t line was obliged to give ground: and &s;ome of his hor&s;e riding full &s;peed to Lon|don, reported that he was utterly defeated. In this emergency, he ordered his body of re&s;erve to advance and charge the enemy in flank; and this expedient was the more &s;ucce&s;sful, as the earl of Oxford had pu&s;hed the Yorki&s;ts &s;o far, that Warwick's main body was left defe$cele&s;s. That nobleman, however, no &s;oo$er recollected this circum&s;tance, than he wheeled about to re&s;ume his &s;ta|tion; and that movement occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of the battle. The device on his arms and e$$igns was a &s;tar &s;hooting forth rays; and that of Edward was a &s;un. The followers of Warwick &s;eeing the &s;tar advancing through the medium of a fog, mi&s;took it for Edward's &s;tandard, and $ell upon their friends with &s;uch $ury, that they were broken and di&s;per&s;ed before the earl of Oxford could rectify the $atal error. The&s;$ la&s;t, b$lieving them&s;elves betrayed, fled towards the enemy with great precipitation. Other parts of Warwick's army &s;eeing them fly, imagined they had been a$tacked in the rear, and of con&s;equence that they them&s;elves were &s;urrounded: they began to be &s;eized with con&s;$$rnation; the pannic &s;pread from rank to rank, and univer$al confu&s;ion en&s;$ed. Edward, taking the advantage of their di&s;order, charged them w$th redouble$ $$gour; and Warwick in vain u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to rally and re-animate them
<PB N="405" REF="4150">
by his own example. In former battles he had always fought on hor&s;eback, that he might ride along the line, and perceive at once the particulars of the action: but on this occa&s;ion he had &s;ent away his hor&s;e, and determined to fight on foot, that his &s;oldiers might &s;ee he was re&s;olved to &s;hare their fate in the i&s;&s;ue of the day. Even this re&s;olution contributed to his defeat; becau&s;e he could not be per&s;onally pre&s;ent at every place where the men &s;tood in need of his direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and they were no longer encouraged by the &s;ight of their commander. After having exerted all his capacity as an officer and hero, in fruitle&s;s attempts, he ru&s;hed into the hotte&s;t part of the battle, and fell covered with wounds; and his brother Montacute, endeavouring to di&s;en|gage him, met with the &s;ame fate. All oppo&s;ition ended with the life of the two generals; and about noon Edward obtained a complete victory over his enemies, five thou&s;and of whom were left dead upon the field; though the car|nage would not have been &s;o great, had not the king forbid his &s;oldiers to give quarter. The earl of Oxford fled into Wales, where the earl of Pembroke was employed in rai&s;ing forces for the &s;ervice of Warwick; the duke of Exeter was wounded, &s;tripped, and le$t for dead on the field, where he remained till the evening, when he recovered the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es, and made &s;hift to crawl to the hou&s;e of one Rutland, where his wounds were cured; but he was after|wards di&s;covered and impri&s;oned in the Tower. Nor was the victory blood|le&s;s to Edward, who lo&s;t the lord Berners and fifteen hundred men, &s;lain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian. Stowe.</NOTE> in the action. Such was the end of the famous earl of Warwick, who, from his great power, influence, military talents, and fortune, had acquired the epithet of the King-Maker. He was certainly a nobleman of great abilities and magnanimity; and if he had not been betrayed by tho&s;e in whom he chiefly confided, Edward would not have triumphed over the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. On the day that &s;ucceeded the battle, the king returned to London, and ordered the naked bodies of Warwick and Montacute to be expo&s;ed in the cathedral of St. Paul's, from whence they were carried to Bi&s;ham in Berk|&s;hire, and interred in the priory founded by their ance&s;tors of the hou&s;e of Montacute.</P>

<P>Edward had not time to enjoy the fruits of his victory, until he was obliged to run the ri&s;k of another battle. Margaret of Anjou, after a te|dious and dangerous pa&s;&s;age, landed on Ea&s;ter day at Weymouth in Dor&s;et|&s;hire, accompanied by the prince of Wales and Edmund duke of Somer&s;et, with a &s;mall body of French forces. When &s;he received the tidings of War|wick's death, and her hu&s;band's impri&s;onment$ all her former courage &s;eemed to for&s;ake her: &s;he was overwhelmed with grief and con&s;ternation; and took refuge with her &s;on in the &s;anctuary of Beaulieu, $ Ci&s;tertian mona&s;tery in Hamp&s;hire. Her &s;pirits, however, revived, when &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf joined by John Courtenay earl of Devon, the vi&s;count Beaumont, the lord Wenlock, Sir Hugh Courtenay, Sir John Beaufort, Sir Thomas Fulford, Sir John For|te&s;cue, Sir Thomas Tre&s;ham, Sir Gerva&s;e Clifton, Sir Thomas Seymour, and other gentlemen, with their va&s;&s;als and adherents. She then took the field, and marching through the counties of Devon and Somer&s;et, her followers increa&s;ed to a very con&s;iderable army; until &s;he advanced to Tewke&s;bury in Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, from whence &s;he propo&s;ed to march towards Wales, and join the earl of Pembroke.</P>

<P>This &s;cheme, however, was defeated by the vigilance and activ$$y of Edward, who pro&s;cribed her and all her ad$erents by proclamation $ and began his march immediately towards the banks of the Severne, in order to en|gage her before &s;he &s;hould be joined by the earl of Pembroke. As &s;he had been denied entrance into Glo$ce&s;ter, where &s;he purpo&s;ed to cro&s;s the river, &s;he had marched to Tewke&s;bury with the &s;ame de&s;ign; but Edward was &s;o clo&s;e at her $eels, that &s;he could not pa&s;s the Severne without expo&s;ing her rear to de&s;truction: it was therefore re&s;olved in a council of war, that her army &s;hould be intrenched in a park adjoining to the town, and remain in that &s;ituation till the arrival of Pembroke. This &s;cheme was immediately put in execution; and Edw$rd coming up, re&s;olved to attack them in their intrenchments before they &s;hould be better fortified or reinforced. For this purpo&s;e he drew up his army in two lines, one of which was commanded by his brother the duke of Glouce&s;ter, while he and Clarence took their &s;tation in the &s;econd. The duke of Somer&s;et di&s;po&s;ed the queen's army in three lines within the intrenchments$ and he him&s;elf commanded the van, that he might &s;u&s;tain the fir&s;t &s;hock of the enemy. The &s;econd line was commanded by the lord Wenlock, under the prince of Wales, who was con&s;idered as general in chief; and the rear was con|ducted by the duke of Devon&s;hire. Edward, ob&s;erving that Somer&s;et had left &s;ome openings in the front, through which he propo&s;ed to $ally, and being well acquainted with the impetuous di&s;po&s;ition of that nobleman, directed his bro|ther Glouce&s;ter, who began the attack, to decoy Somer&s;et from his intrench|ments, by giving ground and retreating with precipitation, until he &s;hould &s;ee the duke and his line in the open plain, and then to turn and renew the charge$ in which ca&s;e, $e &s;hould properly be &s;u&s;tained. Glouce&s;ter, being thus in&s;truct|ed, attacked the intrenchments with great vigour, and meeting with a very warm recep$ion, retired in &s;uch hurry and &s;eeming con&s;u&s;ion, that the duke of So|mer&s;et, believing they fled, &s;allied forth from his works to pur&s;ue them, after having &s;ent an order to Wenlock to follow and &s;u&s;tain him, in ca&s;e of emer|gency. The duke of Glouce&s;ter having drawn his antagoni&s;t into the open plain, practi&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s the le&s;&s;on he had received. His troops h$lt|ing, were in$tantly ranged in their former order; and he led them back to the charge, to the a&s;toni&s;hment and con&s;ternation of the enemy, who had begun the pur&s;uit in &s;ome di&s;order, and were now &s;o confounded, that, in&s;tead of &s;tanding the a$$ault, they thought of nothing but &s;aving them&s;elves within their intrenchments. The duke of Somer&s;et perceiving that the lord Wenlock had not &s;tirred from his &s;tation to &s;upport the fir&s;t line, was &s;o incen&s;ed that he rode up and cle$t his head with a battle-ax; and the duke of Glouce&s;ter entering the intrenchments with the fugitives, made a terrible carnage. The young prince of Wales, &s;eeing all his army in confu&s;ion, did not know on which &s;ide to turn; and the duke of Somer&s;et was &s;o choaked with indignation, that he could hardly &s;peak, much le&s;s take the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps for reducing his troops to order. King Edw$rd, following his brother with the &s;econd line, completed the overthrow of the queen's army, which was routed with great &s;laughter, the &s;econd and third lines having betaken them&s;elves to flight, without &s;triking one &s;troke. The earl of Devon&s;hire and Sir John Beaufort were &s;ound among the dead, which amounted to three thou&s;and; the duke of Some$&s;et, the great prior of St. John, and about twenty other gentlemen, retired to the abbey-church,

thinking they would have been &s;afe in the &s;anctuary: from which, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian. Stowe.</NOTE> they were forcibly dragged to execution. The prince of Wales falling into the hands of his enemies, was brought into the pre&s;ence of Edward, who, with an air of in&s;olence, demanded how he dur&s;t pre&s;ume to enter his kingdom in arms. To this arrogant que&s;tion he replied, with great fortitude and dignity, that he had come to recover his father's crown and his own inheritance, which Edward unju&s;tly $$urped. He had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, which would have excited the admiration and e&s;teem of a generous enemy, than Ed|ward &s;truck him on the face with his gauntlet, and retired; and this &s;eems to have been a preconcerted &s;ignal to the dukes of Clarence and Glouce&s;ter, the lord Ha&s;tings, and Thomas Grey, the &s;on of queen Elizabeth, who in$tantly fell upon him like &s;o many wild bea&s;ts, and hewed him in pieces. His mother Margaret of Anjou, being found on the field of battle in a waggon, where $he lay more dead than alive, was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower, where $he remained about four years, until the king of France payed fifty thou&s;and crowns for her ran&s;om. Such was the ca$a&s;trophe of this French prince&s;s, who&s;e ambition and arbitrary temper co&s;t England oceans of blood and incredible mi&s;ery, and in|volved her&s;elf and her whole family in ruin.</P>

<P>The battle of Tewke&s;bury, which was fought on the fourth day of May, extingui&s;hed the hopes of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter; though there was &s;till a &s;mall army in the field, under the command of the earl of Pembroke: but this di&s;per&s;ed of its own accord, upon hearing the news of the engagement; and the earl, leaving the defence of Pembroke to Sir John Scudamore, fled into Brittany, with his nephew Henry the young earl of Richmond. While Edward was thus employed in the we&s;t, Thomas Nevil ba&s;tard of Falconbridge, who had been created vice-admiral of the channel during the admini&s;tration of Warwick, and lo&s;t his employment after the death of that nobleman, a&s;&s;embled &s;ome ve&s;&s;els, and enli&s;ting a good number of vagabonds, and people of de$pe|rate fortune, cruized along the coa&s;t of Kent, exerci&s;ing the trade of piracy. At length his followers increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that he ventured to make a de&s;cent at Sandwich; and was admitted into Canterbury by Nicholas F$unte the mayor. His number daily augmenting, he began his march for London, at the head of &s;eventeen thou&s;and men; and on the fourteenth day of May entered the &s;uburbs of Southwark, but found him&s;elf excluded from London-Bridge by the citi|zens, who had by this time received the news of the battle of Tewke&s;bury. He detached part of his army cro&s;s the river, with orders to attack the city in three different places, while he him&s;elf &s;hould &s;torm the bridge; and one of his detachments forced its way through Aldgate into the city, but was repul$ed by the valour of alderman Robert Ba$$et. This attempt mi&s;carrying, and the in&s;urgents de&s;erting their leader, in con&s;equence of the di&s;appointment, Thomas embarked on board of his &s;hips at Blackwall, and $ailed round to Sandwich. Mean while Edward, returning to London with a body of three thou&s;and men, p$r&s;ued him to the place of his retreat, and reduced the town, after Nevil had made his e&s;cape by &s;ea; but he was afterwards taken and executed at South|ampton. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian.</NOTE></P>

<P>This in&s;urrection in all probability ha&s;tened the death of the unfor|tunate Henry, who was found dead in the Tower, to which he had been con|fined &s;ince the re&s;toration of Edward. The greater part of hi&s;torians has al|ledged
<PB N="40$" REF="4180">
that he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who was a prince of the mo&s;t brutal di&s;po&s;ition; while &s;ome moderns, from an affectation of &s;ingu|larity, a$$i$m that Henry died of grief and vexation. This, no doubt, might have been the ca&s;e; and it mu&s;t be owned that nothing appears in hi&s;tory, from which either Edward or Richard could be convicted of having contrived or perpetrated this murder: but at the &s;ame time, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve &s;ome concur|ring circum&s;tances that amount to &s;trong pr$&s;umptions again&s;t the reigning monarch. Henry was of a hale con&s;titution, but ju&s;t t$rned of fifty, naturally in&s;en&s;ible of affliction, and hackneyed in the vi$i&s;&s;itu$es of fortune; &s;o that one would not expect he &s;hould have died of age and infirmity, or that his life would have been affected by grief ari&s;ing from his la&s;t di&s;a&s;ter. His &s;udden death was &s;u&s;picious, as well as the conjuncture at which he died, immediately after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a rebel$ion, which &s;eemed to declare that Edward would never be quiet, while the head of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter remained alive; and la&s;tly, the &s;u&s;picion is confirmed by the characters of the reigning king and his brother Richard, who were bloody, barbarous, and unrelenting. Very dif|$erent was the di&s;po&s;ition of the ill-fated Henry, who, without any princely vir$$e or q$alification, was totally free from cruelty and revenge: on the con|trary, he could not, without reluctance, con&s;ent to the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e ma|lefactors who were &s;acrificed to the public &s;afety; and frequently &s;u&s;tained per|&s;onal indignities of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t nature, without di&s;covering the lea&s;t mark of re&s;entment. He was cha&s;te, pious, compa&s;&s;ionate, and charitable, and &s;o in|offen&s;ive, that the bi$hop, who was his confe&s;&s;or for ten years, declared, tha$ in all that time he had never committed any &s;in that required pennance or re|buke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> In a word, he would have adorned a cloi&s;ter, though he di&s;graced a crown; and was rather re&s;pectable for tho&s;e vices he wanted, than for the vir|tues he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He founded the college of Eaton near Wind&s;or, and King's college in Cambridge, $or the reception of tho&s;e &s;cholars who had begun their &s;tudies at Eaton. On the morning that &s;ucceeded his death, his body was ex|po&s;ed i$ St. Paul's church, in order to prevent unfavourable conjectures, and next day &s;ent by water to the abbey of Chert&s;ey, where it was interr$d; but it was afterwards remov$d, by order of Richard III. to Wind$or, and there buried with great funeral &s;olemnity.</P>

The king, alarmed at this exploit, ordered a detachment of troops to march again&s;t him before he &s;hould have time to form an army; and being inve&s;ted, he &s;urrendered on promi&s;e of life; but he lo&s;t his liberty and e&s;tate, which Edward confi&s;cated, without allowing the lea&s;t trifle for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his counte&s;s, who was &s;i&s;ter to the earl of Warwick; and he him&s;elf was conveyed to the ca&s;tle of Hammes near Calais, where he remained twelve years a pri&s;oner. John Holland duke of Exeter, who had been left for dead on the field at Barnet, retired to the &s;anctuary at We&s;tmin|&s;ter; and intreated his wife, who was Edward's &s;i&s;ter, to employ her good offices in his behalf: they had lived &s;eparate &s;ince the beginning of the civil war. She was now &s;o far from befriending him with her brother, that &s;he de&s;ired the &s;eparation might be confirmed by law; and &s;he obtained her re|que&s;t, although no &s;ufficient cau&s;e could be &s;hewn for &s;uch confirmation. The duke, &s;eeing him&s;elf precluded from all hope of pardon, and tired of living in confinement on the charity of a few friends, quitted his a&s;ylum $o privately, that no per&s;on knew the time or manner of his retreat; and in about two years after he di&s;appeared, his body was found on the &s;ea-&s;ide in the county of Kent. $$is nobleman was the la&s;t branch of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter that could give

Edward any di$tu$b$nce, except the earl of Richmond, who re&s;ided at the court of Brittany with $is uncle Pembroke; and although the&s;e were in no condition to interrupt the quiet of his reign, he eagerly de&s;ired to have the young earl in his power. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the duke of Bre|tagne, demanding they &s;hould be delivered up: but that prince would not &s;o far violate the laws of ho&s;pitality, as to comply with his demand; though he a&s;&s;ured Edward he would keep them in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;hould never di&s;turb his government; and in con&s;ideration of this promi&s;e the king payed a yearly pen&s;ion, on pr$tence of a maintenance for the two pri&s;oners. The fears of Edward being appea$ed by this convention, he te&s;tified his grati|tude to Lewis de Bruges lord of Gruth$y$en, by whom he had been &s;o ho&s;pi|tably entertained in Holland, and created him a peer of England by the title of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in England, Lewis XI. of France un|der&s;tand$ng that there was a treaty of marriage on foot between his brother the duke of Guienne, and the daughter of Charles duke of Burgundy, re&s;olved to p$$vent an $li$$$ce which mu&s;t have formed &s;uch an intimate connexion be|t$$en $is own family, and that hou&s;e which he wanted to humble: he therefore ca$$ed a do&s;e of $low poi&s;on to be admini&s;tred to the duke of Guienne. In the mean $word$ he co$c$$ded a truce for a whole year with the duke of Burgundy, who willingly agr$$d to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, as he had already lo$t Amiens and S$. Quin|ti$ by the war, which of him&s;elf he was not able to maintain. In a few weeks after the conclu&s;ion of this treaty the duke of Guienne died, and Lewis &s;eized hi$ du$chy without oppo&s;ition. Then the duke of Burgundy perceived that he had been duped by the French king, who had negotiated the truce, that he might be at liberty to execute his de&s;ign upon Guienne; and he was &s;o in|&s;tamed with re&s;entment at finding him&s;elf over-reached, that he entered France with a$ army, wa&s;ting the country with fire and &s;word. The duke of Brit|tany, who&s;e &s;chemes were fru&s;trated by the death of the duke of Guienne, re&s;olved to join Burgundy in earne&s;t, as the only means practicable for their mutual pre&s;ervation; but Lewis, &s;u&s;pecting that he would take this re&s;olution, had already ordered a body of troops to a&s;&s;emble in Anjou, in order to over|awe his conduct. Mean while Charles made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Ne&s;le and R$ye, and inve&s;ted Beauvais, which, however, he could not reduce$ From thence $e $$$ched into Normandy, in hope of being joined by the duke of Bretagne, who could not &s;tir from his own dominions: though Lewis, by keeping his army in Anjou, left Normandy and Picardy at the me$cy of the Bu$gundians. At length, $owever, the French king $ound means to make a &s;eparate truce with B$$ttany; and the d$ke of Burgundy, finding him&s;elf abandoned by his ally, followed his example in concluding a truce with Lewis, which was fre|quently prolonged.</P>

<P>Immediately after the conclu&s;ion of the truce between France and Bur|gundy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1474.</NOTE> Charles had invaded Guelderland, as a donation made to him by Arnold duke of that country, who had quarrelled with his own &s;on Adolphus. On this pretence the duke of Burgundy entered Guelderland, defeated and took Adolphus, and reduced the whole dutchy under his dominion. Then he re|&s;olved to extend his conque&s;ts on the &s;ide of Germany, as &s;oon as an opportu|nity &s;hould offer. A conte&s;t for the archibi&s;hopric of Cologne happening between Robert of Bavaria and the brother of the landgrave of H$&s;&s;e, he e&s;|pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the former, and undertook the &s;iege of Nuys, a &s;trong town in the archbi&s;hopric, which he hoped to reduce before the expiration of his truce with Lewis: but that prince, by his intrigues, rai&s;ed &s;uch ob&s;tacles to his &s;ucce&s;s, as he could by no means &s;urmount. At his in&s;tigation the empe|ror F$ede$ic rai&s;ed a numerous army, to compel him to rai&s;e the &s;$ege; and a confederacy was formed again&s;t him by the Swi&s;s, the dukes of Au&s;tria and Lorraine. Thus circum&s;tanced, he &s;aw no other way to free him&s;elf from the per&s;ecution of Lewis, but that of prevailing upon Edward king of England, to make a powerful diver&s;ion in France; and for this purpo&s;e, he &s;ent a$ba&s;|&s;adors to London while he continued at Nuys, which he be&s;ieged for ten months without &s;ucce&s;s. In order to engage Edward in his views, he promi&s;ed to join him with all his forces, as &s;oon as he &s;hould make a de&s;cent in Picardy; he flattered him with the hope of St. Quintin's being delivered to him by the con&s;table of St. Pol, and of the duke of Bretagne's entering into their a$&s;ocia|tion. He at the &s;ame time amu&s;ed the Engli&s;h mo$arch with a$ account of a corre&s;pondence which he maintained with the French princes, and per&s;uaded him that the conque&s;t of France would be much ea&s;ier at this juncture, than it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.

<P>Edward longed with impatience for &s;uch an opportunity of being re|venged upon Lewis; and every thing &s;eemed to con&s;pire the ruin of that tur|bulent prince, who would not have been able to cope with three &s;uch formida|ble enemies, had they acted again&s;t him with unanimity: but the &s;ole aim of Charles was to procure &s;uch a diver&s;ion in France, as would prevent Lewis from interrupting his own progre&s;s in Germany. Neverthele&s;s, he pretended to be hearty in his re&s;olution to a&s;&s;i&s;t Edward in making a conque&s;t of France, and inve&s;ted his amba&s;&s;adors with full powers to treat on this &s;ubject. The con|ferences were immediately begun by the plenipotentiaries of both &s;ides; and in July, they &s;igned divers treaties relating to that important enterprize. The fir&s;t was a league of friend&s;hip, alliance, and confederacy, between Edward and the duke of Burgundy, who engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other with all their power. The &s;econd comprehe$ded certain particular conventions, relating to the war again&s;t France. The&s;e imported$ That Edward &s;hould invade France before a certain &s;pecified time, at the head of ten thou&s;and men at lea&s;t, in order to recover his dutchies of Guienne and Normandy, together with the whole

kingdom: That the duke of Burgundy &s;hould per&s;onally a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his forces, in the execution of this de&s;ign: That the king &s;hould li&s;ten to no propo|&s;al of peace or truce, without the duke's con&s;ent; and that the duke &s;hould act i$ the &s;ame manner with re&s;pect to Edward: That both princes &s;hould proclaim war again&s;t Lewis as their common enemy: That, if either of them &s;hould be be&s;ieged, or find it nece&s;&s;ary to give battle, the other &s;hould join him with all his forces, and at his own expence, that they might &s;hare the &s;ame fate; and that their lieutenants &s;hould act on the &s;ame principle: That immediately after the declaration of war, the two allies &s;hould attack their common enemy in the mo&s;t convenient places, and in &s;uch a manner as that they &s;hould be at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other: That the war being once begun, one party &s;hould not de&s;i&s;t while the other &s;hould proceed with his operations; and, that in ca&s;e of one's being ab&s;ent, his lieutenant &s;hould obey the other in every thing relat|ing to the common advantage of the allies. The third treaty regulated the number of troops that each obliged him&s;elf to furni&s;h for the expedition; and the fourth contained a donation to the duke of Burgundy, of &s;everal provinces in France, with which Edward promi&s;ed to recompence his friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The fifth convention related to the payment of the troops furni&s;hed by the duke of Burgundy; and the la&s;t was expedited in form of let|ters patent, by which the duke impowered and allowed Edward and his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, kings of France, to enter Rheims, and be con&s;ecrated with the holy oil, without mole&s;tation.

<P>We are not to &s;uppo&s;e that either party imagined France could be conquered by the forces they intended to a&s;&s;emble for this expedition. They endeavoured to deceive one another; for, as we have already ob&s;erved, the d$ke had no other view than that of making a diver&s;ion, and Edward's ambi|tion was limited to the recovery of Normandy and Guienne. Tho&s;e treaties being ratified, and approved by the parliament in its fifth &s;e&s;&s;ion, which granted the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, the king began to i&s;&s;ue commi&s;&s;ions for levying troops; and in the mean time, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to different courts of Europe, to form new alliances, or at lea&s;t prevent the union of the &s;everal powers with his enemy. The peace with Scotland was cemented by a contract of marriage be|tween Edward's &s;econd daughter Cecilia, and James the &s;on and heir of James III. king of that country; and the parties being infants, were a&s;&s;ianced by proxy. In the mean time, Edward engaged to pay twenty thou&s;and marks as her portion, at different terms, on condition of retouching the &s;um in ca&s;e the marriage &s;hould not take effect. The truce was prolonged for &s;ix and forty years; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ P$b.</NOTE> the two kings engaged mutually to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all rebellions. Edward having taken the&s;e prudent precautions to &s;creen his dominions from ho&s;tile inva&s;ion, carried on his preparations with redoubled vigour; and as the &s;ub&s;idies granted by parliament would not an&s;wer the expence of the expedi|tion, he &s;ollicited a benevolence or free-gift from his &s;ubjects, according to their<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ Ch. 1475.</NOTE> abilities. This expedient &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. Some contributed with a good grace; others were gained over by the eloquence and in&s;inuation of Ed|ward: the female &s;ex exerted them&s;elves in favour of a prince whom they ad|mired. Many individuals cho&s;e rather to part with their money, than run the ri&s;que of incurring his indignation; and a war with France was a very popular
<PB N="413" REF="4230">
pretence at this juncture. The king did not &s;cruple to vi&s;it particular per&s;ons, and receive their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in per&s;on. Among others, he $ddre&s;&s;$d him&s;elf to a rich widow, who told him, &s;he could not help contributing twenty pounds to a hand&s;ome young prince who begged with &s;uch a good grace: Edward, in return for this compliment, approached, and ki&s;&s;ed her with great cordiality; and &s;he was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the unexpected honour, that &s;he doubled her benevolence. Of the new levie$ three thou&s;and men were d$&s;tined for the &s;er|vice of the duke of Brittany, who, tho' he had changed his tr$ce with Lewis into a perpetual peace, $o &s;ooner under&s;tood that a league was formed by the king of England and the duke of Burgundy, than he privately de&s;ired to be comprehended in the treaty; and his reque&s;t being $word$ this body of troops, commanded by the lords Audley and De Duras, was de$$$$ed for his defence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>Edward having a&s;&s;embled an army of fi$$$$n hundred men at arms$ fifteen thou&s;and archers on hor&s;eback, and a great number of infantry, ap|pointed his &s;on Edward prince of Wales, tho' an infant, guardian of the king|dom, and embarked at Sandwich for Calais, on the twentieth day of June; tho' he was &s;o ill provided with tran&s;ports, that he &s;pent three weeks in con|veying his troops to the continent.

<P>Mean while Edward advanced into Picardy, where he expected to be joined by the duke of Burgundy: but that prince, in&s;tead of fulfilling his en|gagement with his ally, was &s;till employed in the &s;iege of Nuys. He ob|&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in that enterprize, although the emperor had approached the place with an army four times as numerous as that which he commanded, and harra&s;&s;ed him in &s;uch a manner, that he could not proceed with his operations; at the &s;ame time Sigi$mund duke of Au&s;tria made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Feretti, the duke of Lorraine ravaged Luxemburg, and his truce with France was no &s;ooner expired, than Lewis reduced Roye, Corbie, and Montdidier. Notwith&s;tanding all this oppo&s;ition, he would not rai&s;e the &s;iege until Edward threatened to renounce his alliance; then he con&s;ented, that the place &s;hould be delivered into the hands of the pope's legate, in order to be di&s;po&s;ed of according to the arbi|tration of his holine&s;s: but, when he rai&s;ed the &s;iege, his army was in &s;uch a condition, that he was obliged to put the troops in quarters of refre&s;hment, while he him&s;elf &s;et out with a &s;mall body to excu&s;e him&s;elf in per&s;on to Ed|ward. The king of England could hardly dige&s;t this conduct of his ally; and began to perceive, that he had engaged in war for the intere&s;t of another power, in&s;tead of its b$$ng undertaken for the &s;upport of his own preten&s;ions.
<PB N="414" REF="4240">
He was &s;till more confirmed in this opi$ion, when he &s;aw the duke of Bur|gu$dy would not &s;uff$r his troops to enter Pe$onne, except in &s;mall unarmed companies; and that the con&s;table of St. Pol refu&s;ed to deliver up St. Quintin, which he had promi&s;ed to put into the hands of Edward, as a pledge for his ob$$r$ance of t$e treaty. Edward finding him&s;elf thus abandoned by the duke of B$$gu$dy and the constable, while the duke of Bretagne took no &s;tep to|wards the performance of articles, and the malecontents of France did not &s;eem incli$ed to rai&s;e the lea&s;t commotion, was equally mortified and perpl$ked in his re&s;olution; and heartily repented of having embarked in the expedition.</P>

<P>While he remained thus embarra&s;&s;ed in his thoughts, a French gen|tleman, who had been taken pri&s;oner, was relea&s;ed by his order, and the lords Howard and Stanley de$$ring him to pre&s;ent their re&s;pects to the king of France, he complied with their de&s;ire. Lewis concluded from this compli|ment, that the court of England wanted to enter into a negotiation, but were unwilling to make the fir&s;t advances; and as he him&s;elf had no &s;cruples of that nature, he re&s;olved to &s;pare Edward the confu&s;ion of &s;olliciting a treaty. He forthwith ordered a herald's coat to be made for a man, with who&s;e di&s;cretion and addre&s;s he was well acquainted$ and having in&s;tructed him for the purpo&s;e, &s;ent him to the Engli&s;h army$ to demand a &s;$$e-conduct for the amba&s;&s;adors of France, that they might come and treat of a pacification. He addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to the lords Howard and Stanley; and they introduced him to the king, who received his remon&s;trance in good part, granted the &s;afe-conduct which he demanded, and di&s;$i&s;&s;$d him with a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent. The lord Stanley, and two other noblemen, were appointed as plenipotentiaries to treat with the French amba&s;&s;adors, in the neighbourhood of Amiens, between the two ar|mies; and, on the twenty-eighth day of Augu&s;t, the peace was concluded, on condition, That Lewis &s;hould pay &s;eventy-five thou&s;and crowns, to indemnify Edward for the expe$$e of the armament; on the receipt of which, the king of England &s;hould immediately retire with his forces: That Lewis &s;hould like|wi&s;e grant him an a$$uity of fifty thou&s;and crowns: That the dauphin of France &s;hould marry the prince&s;s Elizabeth, daughter of Edward, and &s;ettle &s;ixty thou&s;and li$$es a year upon her as a jointure: and, That neither party &s;hould encourage civil wars in the other's kingdom; but, that both &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co$ines.

<P>The duke of Burgundy no &s;ooner under&s;tood that a treaty was on the carp$$, between Lewis and Edward, than he repaired to the Engli&s;h army, in order to prevent its taking effect; but, before he arrived, the peace was ra|ti$$ed, and Edward gave him to under&s;tand, that he might, if he would, be comprehended in the treaty, together with his other allies, the duke of Bretagne and the con&s;table. Charles was &s;o incen&s;ed at this accommodation, that he rejected Edward's offer with di$dain, and returned to his own country glowing with re&s;$$tment again&s;t the king of England. The con&s;table exerted all his en|deavours in per&s;u$ding Edward to renounce the treaty. He even offered to
<PB N="415" REF="4250">
deliver St. Quintin into his hands, and a$commodat$ him with the loan of f$$ty thou&s;and crowns: but the Engli&s;h monarch was not &s;o weak as to recommence the war upon the promi&s;es of a per&s;on whom he had great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect of in&s;incerity. Before his return to England, he and Lewis agreed to have an in|terview on the bridge of Pequigny, with a barrier between them. The French king was accompanied by the cardinal of Bourbon, and five other noblemen, and Edward was attended by &s;ome of the Engli&s;h nobility. After they had ra|$ified the treaty upon oath, Lewis invited Edward to Paris, where he &s;aid the ladies would endeavour to entertain him agreeably, and &s;hould he be tempted to commit any piccadillo, he &s;hould have $or his confe&s;&s;or the cardinal of Bour|bon, who would not be very rigid in point of penance. The two kings rallied one $$other with great good humour, until Lewis made a &s;ignal for his atten|dants to withdraw: the Engli&s;h likewi&s;e retired on their &s;ide, and their ma&s;ters conferred together a con&s;iderable time; their conver&s;ation tur$ing upon the dukes of Burgundy, Bretagne, and the con&s;table. Lewis de&s;iring to know the &s;entiments o$ Edward touching the&s;e three allies; the king of England told him, th$t if the duke of Burgundy and the con&s;table &s;hould refu$e to be compre|h$nded in the treaty, the king of France might act towards them according to his own plea&s;ure; but, that &s;hould the duke of Brittany be attacked, he would a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all his power. The tenderne&s;s which Edward expre&s;&s;ed for that prince, proceeded from his having in his power the &s;ole remaining branch of the hou&s;e of Lanca$ter, by who$e means he could at any time have rai&s;ed com|motions in England; and therefore, Edward thought proper to cultivate the duke's friend&s;hip. Lewis did not pre&s;s him upon this &s;ubject; and the two kings parted very well &s;atisfied with each another.</P>

<P>The French king repaired to Amiens, accompanied by the lord Howard, who remained as ho&s;tage for Edward's performance of articles; and this nobleman, while the king wa&s;hed his hands, gave his maje&s;ty to under|&s;tand, that Edward was not aver&s;e to an excur&s;ion to Paris. Lewis made no reply to this in&s;inuation, until it was repeated; and then he &s;aid, that the war in which he was engaged with the duke of Burgundy, would not permit him to go to Paris; and therefore, he was &s;orry he could not have the honour of receiving the vi&s;it of the king of England. He dreaded nothing &s;o much as Edward's taking a liking to France; and, above all things, wi&s;hed he would re|turn to his own kingdom. He was &s;o apprehen&s;ive of his retracting his en|gagements, that he di&s;tributed con&s;iderable pen&s;ions among the principal members of Edward's council, that they might u&s;e their influence in prevent|ing an infraction of the truce. The E$gli&s;h army approaching Amiens, $e ordered the gates to be thrown open, and all the inn-keepers of the place to treat the &s;oldiers at his expence; nay, he &s;ent three hundred waggon loads of wine to Edward's camp, as a pre$ent to the army. All this genero&s;ity and com|pliment was the effect of fear, from which he was at length d$livered by the departure of the Engli&s;h, who returned to their own country, extremely well plea&s;ed with their entertainment. The duke of Burgundy, when his choler &s;ub&s;ided, accep$ed a &s;eparat$ truce, which was offered to him by Lewis: and, the con&s;table &s;eeing him&s;elf de$erted by his allies, retired into the duke's do|minions, on the faith of a &s;afe-conduct; notwith&s;tanding which, he was deli|vered up to Lewis, who ordered him to be beheaded as a traitor. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Comines.</NOTE></P>

Ch. 1$$6.</NOTE> Edward hoping, that the friend&s;hip he had expre&s;&s;ed for the duke of Brittany, would render that prince more propitious to h$s great aim of get|ting the earl of Richmond into his hands, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to his court, on pretence of renewing the truce, which was confirmed without difficulty; and this affair being tran&s;acted, they proceeded to unfold the real de&s;ign of their emba&s;&s;y. They told him, that the king their ma&s;ter was extremely de&s;irous of extingui&s;hing the embers of tho&s;e factions which had raged with &s;uch violence in England: that the earl of Richmond being the only &s;urviving prince of the ho$&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, his intention was, to match him with one of his own daugh|$$rs, that the two hou&s;es might be united by &s;uch an alliance: he therefore h$ped the duke of Brittany would give up the earl, that he might di&s;tingui&s;h him by marks of his bounty, and convince the world of his extreme de&s;ire to e&s;tabli$h the peace and tranquillity of his kingdom. The duke of Brittany either b$lieving Edward &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ions, or convinced by the pre&s;ent of a large &s;um of money, ordered the young earl, and his uncle Pembroke, to be put into the hands of the amba&s;&s;adors, who immediately &s;et out with their prize for St. Malo, in order to embark for England. Before they reached that port, however, the duke changed his mind, either through remor&s;e, or &s;u&s;picion of Edward's intent; and forthwith di&s;patched his favourite Peter Landais to St. Malo, to reclaim the refugees. He arrived ju&s;t as they were going to embark, and gave &s;uch directions to the people who attended him, that while he amu&s;ed the amba&s;&s;adors, the earl of Richmond, and his uncle Pembroke, found means to e&s;cape, and take &s;anctuary in a church, from whence Landais would not &s;uffer them to be taken. The amba&s;&s;adors loudly complained of this artifice; and he made &s;ome frivolous apologies, which they would by no means admit; then he frankly told them, that the duke his ma&s;ter having reflected on the &s;ubject, thought he could not deliver up his gue&s;ts without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing again&s;t the laws of honour and ho&s;pitality; but, he a&s;&s;ured them the two earls &s;hould be guarded in &s;uch a manner as would effectually prevent them from interrupt|ing the peace of England.</P>

<P>Immediately after the duke of Burgundy had &s;igned the truce with Lewis, he marched again&s;t the duke of Lorrain, and &s;ubdued his whole coun|try, without having met with any con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance; then he propo&s;ed a &s;cheme for humbling the Swi&s;s, who had declared again&s;t him while he was em|ployed in the &s;iege o$ Nuys; and the pretext he u&s;ed for denouncing war again&s;t them, was, the injury they had done to Jaques de Savoy, Count de Romont, whom they had expelled from his territories. The Swi&s;s, terrified at the im|pending &s;torm, &s;ollicited peace with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: but he remained inexo|rable; and marching from Lorraine through Burgundy, entered the country of Vaux, in which he took three or four places without difficulty. Then he inve&s;ted Gran&s;on, which was garri&s;oned by eight hundred Swi&s;s, who made a very gallant defence; at length they were obliged to &s;ubmit, and the duke ordered them to be put to the &s;word, in contempt of the capitulation. Hearing that another body was on the march to their relief, he advanced again&s;t them with his whole army, and detached an hundred archers on hor&s;eback to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a defile in the mountains, through which the Swi&s;s were obliged to pa&s;s, in their route to the open country. The&s;e archers, being en|countered by the enemy, retreated with precipitation towards the army, which,
<PB N="417" REF="4270">
o$ the &s;uppo&s;ition of their $$in$ p$r&s;$$d by the Swi&s;s, was &s;eized with &s;uch a pan$$c that it $$$d in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, in &s;pite of all the efforts of the duke$ who, though he lo&s;t but &s;eve$ men a$ arm$ on this occa&s;ion, was obliged to leave all his baggage in the hands of the enemy. Yet, far from being di&s;cou|raged by this ac$ident, he re-a&s;&s;embled his troops; and in fifteen days inve&s;ted Morat, a &s;mall town in the neighbourhood of Berne. Mean while the Swi&s;s, having received reinforcements from &s;everal princes, began their march to the number of thirty thou&s;and men; and, giving the duke battle, he wa$ entirely de$eated with great &s;laughter. He was &s;o &s;hocked at this overthrow, that he fell &s;ick of grief and mortification, and kept him&s;elf concealed in a village call|ed La Riviere, for &s;ix weeks, during which, he refu&s;ed all con&s;olation: and now divers princes, who had been formerly his friends, renounced his alliance, and joined his enemies. The duke of Lorrain &s;eized this opportunity of in|ve&s;ting Na$ci, and gained the place by compo&s;ition, before the duke of Bur|gundy took any &s;tep towards its relief; but after it had &s;urrendered, that prince appro$$hed with his army, and, the enemy retiring, he undertook the &s;iege$ which wa$ the cau&s;e of his ruin. The duke of Lorrain, having received rein|fo$$$ments from different quarters, and a&s;&s;embled a &s;trong army, by means of a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, with which he was furni&s;hed by the French king, adv$$ced t$ward$ Nanci, and e$camped at St. Nicholas, in order to &s;ee the eff$ct of a corre&s;pondence which he maintained with a Neapolitan officer, called Camp$ Ba&s;&s;o, who enjoyed the confidence of the duke of Burgundy. The tow$ was already reduced to extremity, when that prince drew up his army in order of battle; and then Campo Ba&s;&s;o de&s;erted to the enemy with two hundred men at arms, leaving fourteen accomplices, whom he had in&s;tructed to in$ect the Burgundians with a pannic; and to &s;lay the duke during the engagement, &s;hould they find an opportunity. The battle was fought on the fifth day of Ja|nuary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The death of this imperious prince produced great changes not only in the affairs of the Low Countries, but even i$ tho&s;e of all the neighbouring princes. He left but one daughter, called M$ry, heire&s;$ of his exten&s;ive domi|nions, whom he intended to match with Maximilian of Au&s;tri$, &s;on of Frede|rick $mperor of Germany. The prince&s;s, who was nineteen years of age, &s;uc|ceeded to her father at a time when her family was de&s;erted by all its antient friends; &s;o that &s;he was expo&s;ed in a peculiar manner to the avarice of Lewis XI. who forthwith &s;eized Burgundy, and the town$ &s;ituated upon the Som$e; and formed a &s;cheme for depriving her of all the re&s;t of her dominions. In this di&s;|tre&s;s &s;he implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to oppo&s;e the projects of the French king; but that prince had corrupted the whole council of Edward, who could afford nothing in behalf of Mary but unavailing compli|ments; and what completed the misfortune of this orphan prince&s;s, was the rebellion of the inhabitants of Ghen$, who &s;eized and confined her per&s;on, $e|headed two of her coun&s;ellors, and forced upon her a new council compo&s;ed of their creatures. Several princes, allured by this noble inheritance, re&s;olved to<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$zera$:</NOTE> demand Mary in marriage. The dauphin of France hankered after this match,
<PB N="418" REF="4280">
but Lewis had already entered into engagements with Edward, whom he did not choo&s;e to di&s;oblige at &s;uch a juncture. The duke of Gu$$derland and di|vers Germa$ princes a&s;pired at this alliance; and in the month of May the emperor &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Ghent, to renew the negotiation for a ma$ch be|tween the prince&s;s and his &s;on Maximilian. The dutche&s;s d$w$ger de&s;ired her brother, the king of England, to &s;end envoys to Flanders to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in negotiating this affair, and &s;o far he complied with her reque&s;t; but he could not be per&s;uaded to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mary again&s;t the French king, who &s;till continued extending his conque&s;ts at her expence; on the contrary, Edward prolonged the truce of Amiens from the term of &s;even years till one year after the death<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> of either party, acting diametrically oppo&s;ite to the intere&s;t of England, in conniving at the ruin of the hou&s;e of Burgundy, to aggrandize the power of Lewis. But by this time Edward was grown corpulent, and unfit for carrying on a war in per&s;on: he was di&s;&s;uaded from engaging in behalf of Mary by his coun&s;ellors, who were pen&s;ioners of France; and he was extremely $nwilling to take any &s;tep which might ob&s;truct the marriage between the d$uphin and his daughter Elizabeth: be&s;ides, Lewis was very punctual in the payment of the fifty thou&s;and crowns; a gratuity which he was very loth to forego. Mary of Burgundy, being thus abandoned by all tho&s;e from whom &s;he had rea&s;on to expect effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, con&s;ented to wed Maximilian, though &s;he knew he was in no condition to defend her territories. The marriage was celebrated in July; and Lewis, in token of his regard for the emperor, not only granted a truce of one year to the new duke of Burgundy, but al&s;o re&s;tored $ome places<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> which he had reduced in Hainault.</P>

<P>Edward, now being at peace with all his neighbours, and his king|dom enjoying the mo&s;t profound tranquility, applied him&s;elf to the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice, and made a circuit through his do$i$ions to clear the roads of robbers, by which they had been grievou&s;ly infe&s;ted &s;ince he di&s;banded his ar|my. He exerted him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion with equal vigilance and impartiality, puni&s;hing the offenders without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, and even &s;acri$$cing his own &s;ervants to the good of the publick, when they were convicted of delinquency: This expedition was nece&s;&s;ary to hu$h the clamours of the people, who had be|gun to complain loudly of the expence to which they were expo&s;ed by the la&s;t $ruitle&s;s armament; and Edward was &s;o alarmed at their murmurs, that he would not venture to a&s;k further &s;upplies from his parliament. He therefore had recour&s;e to other methods for filling his exhau&s;ted exchequer: he engaged in com|merce, which he carried on to a great extent, as a private adventurer; he &s;old the profits of vacant prelacies; exacted fines for the re&s;titution of temporalities: he &s;earched into offices of record to find out defective titles to lands, and com|pelled the proprietors by irregular pro&s;ecutions to pay large &s;ums for their con|firmation. He likewi&s;e laid frequent impo&s;itions on the clergy, and became totally infected with the vice of avarice: tho' yet &s;till part of his time was ex|pended i$ the mo&s;t effeminate amu&s;ements.</P>
<P N="63"><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. C$. 147$.</NOTE> LXIII. The admini&s;tration was wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the queen and her $word$ who rendered them&s;elves odious to the nation not only by their in&s;a|$$able<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> thir&s;t of power, but al&s;o by their in&s;olent demeanour, and the pride they &s;ee$ed to take in $lighting and thwarting the &s;chemes of the king's brothers.

him $nd the mini&s;try; but George duke of Clarence, a we$k pri$ce, of great pride, ambition, and impetuo&s;ity, could not &s;uppre&s;s his indignation, which broke out with great indecency on all occa&s;ions. While Edward lived in celi|bacy he had flattered him&s;elf with the hope of &s;ucceeding to the throne of Eng|land; and was &s;o extremely mortified at his marriage, that he had never loved his brother heartily &s;ince that event: he hated the queen for the &s;ame rea&s;on, and his rancour extended to her whole family. This animo&s;ity was increa&s;ed by their gra&s;ping at all the power of the admini&s;tration, and interfering with him in the &s;chemes he had formed for his own advantage. By the act of re&s;ump|tion they had deprived him of the honour of Tutbury, and many other lands which he had enjoyed by the king's donation. His dutche&s;s, dying imme|diately before the death of Charles duke of Burgundy, he &s;ollicited the good offices of his &s;i&s;ter Margaret, widow of that prince, to effect a match between him and her &s;tep-daughter, the prince&s;s Mary. Thi$ would have been a very advantageous alliance for England; and the dutche&s;s dowager, who loved Cl$re$ce above all her brothers, engaged &s;o heartily in his intere&s;t, that in all probability the &s;cheme would have &s;ucceeded, h$d it not been indu$$riou&s;ly ob|&s;tructed by the intrigues of Edward, who was either je$lous of his brother'$ acce&s;&s;ion to &s;uch power, or influenced by the quee$, who wanted to procure this match for her brother Anthony Wideville, earl of Rivers.</P>

<P>Such a di&s;appointment could not $ail to inflame the hatred of Clarence, who exclaimed again&s;t the king with great virulence; and his di&s;content was encouraged and fomented by the cunning in&s;inuatio$s of Richard duke of Glouce&s;ter. This prince had already formed a de&s;ign upon the crown, which could not &s;ucceed &s;o long as Clarence &s;tood between him and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: he therefore re&s;olved to effect his ruin, as the prelude to that u&s;urpation, which he knew the infant children of Edward would not be able to prevent. With this view he artfully exa&s;perated the re&s;entment of Clarence again&s;t the king, until he uttered &s;ome ra&s;h menaces and impreca|tions; and the&s;e he afterwards repeated with exaggerations to Edward, on pretence of cautioning him again&s;t the other's trea&s;onable de&s;igns. The queen and her kindred, who hated Clarence, reinforced the &s;ugge&s;tions of Richard; &s;o that Edward looked upon his brother George as a traitor, who formed &s;chemes again&s;t his life. This &s;u&s;picion produced a coldne&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t to|wards Clarence, who was more and more incen&s;ed at the king's n$glect $nd &s;ullen behaviour. He became louder in his complaints, and the mini$$ry re|&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity to accompli&s;h his de&s;truction. In order to provoke him to &s;ome act of indi&s;cretion that would furni&s;h a handle for his ruin, they attacked him in his favourites and confidents, again&s;t whom they trumped up ridiculous accu&s;ations. John Stacy, a learned clergyman, and no|ted a&s;tronomer, was charged with the exerci&s;e of negromancy; and Thom$s Burdet, of Arrow, in Warwick&s;hire, a gentleman of unblemi&s;hed character$ was arre&s;ted as his accomplice, as well as on account of his having cur$ed $$e king, who had killed a favourite white hind in one of his enclo&s;ures. They were tried for the&s;e crimes in the King's bench in We&s;tmin&s;ter; and, being found guilty, executed at Tyburn; where both prote&s;ted their inno$ence with great &s;pirit and con&s;tancy. Clarence, enraged at this &s;acrifice of his friends, went next day to the council$chamber at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and pro$$ced to the &s;itting lords the private confe&s;&s;ion and public declar$tion of tho&s;e innocent

victims. He c$uld not help on this occa&s;ion expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in terms of acrimony again&s;t the king, to whom they were repeated by &s;ome courtier. Edwar$ was $o i$ce$&s;ed at his pre&s;umption, that in the fir&s;t tran&s;port of his $a&s;&s;i$n he repaired from Wind&s;or to We&s;tmin&s;ter, and &s;ummoned Clarence to appear before the council. There he upbraided the duke with his in&s;olence in pre&s;$ming t$ arraig$ the $u&s;tice of the courts of law; $e &s;aid his behaviour $word$ a de&s;ign to int$m$date the judges and juries of the realm, as well as an $word$ on the ro$al $$$$ority: he repeated all the malicious &s;tories that had been $old to his pre$$dice; reviled him as an ungrateful traitor; and &s;igned a warrant $or committing him pri&s;oner to the Tower.</P>

<P>A parliament meeting at We&s;tmin&s;ter, on the &s;ixteenth day of Ja|nuary, Henry duke of Buckingham was appointed high &s;teward of England, to pre$$de at the trial of Clarence, who&s;e impeachment was dige&s;ted into eight a$$$cles; importing, That by his &s;editious di&s;cour&s;e he had endeavoured to prejudice the king in the minds of his &s;ub$ects, accu&s;ing his maje&s;ty of having p$t B$rd$t $word$ to death: Th$t he had &s;uborned his dome&s;ticks and others to &s;pread this $$$&s;e report: That he had accu&s;ed the king of negromancy, of having de&s;troyed by po$&s;on divers innocent per&s;ons, who&s;e lives could not be affected by any juridical proce&s;s: That he had affirmed the king was not the $on of his reputed father, but a ba&s;tard, begotten by another man, whom the d$$che&s;s of York admitted to her embraces: That Clarence, from this circum|&s;tance arrogating to him&s;elf a right to the crown, had demon&s;trated his de&s;ign o$ &s;eizing it, by exacting from &s;everal per&s;ons an oath to &s;erve him again&s;t all $ankind, not even excep$i$g his &s;overeign. That he had accu&s;ed the king of u$ing witchcraft to deprive him of his life: And that he had plainly betrayed a de&s;ign to det$rone the king, in taking an exemplification of the act of parlia|ment pa&s;&s;ed during the u$$rpation of Warwick, by which the crown was &s;ettled upon Clarence, in default of Henry VI. and the male i&s;&s;ue of his body. The d$ke denied every part of the charge, and offered to prove his innocence in &s;ingle combat; but Edward him&s;elf being his accu&s;er, and declaring him&s;elf well &s;atisfied and convinced of the truth of the impeachment, no evidence was examined, and no member pre&s;umed to &s;peak in behalf of this unfortunate prince, who was therefore pronounced guilty of the charge, and condemned to die as a traitor. The &s;entence was not immediately executed; and in all pro|bability his life would have been &s;pared, had not the k$ng's indignation been kept up by the artful intrigues of the queen and Glouce&s;ter, and his apprehen|&s;ion arou&s;ed by a ridiculous prophecy; implying that the name of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould begin with a G. which was applied to George duke of Clarence. Ne|verthele&s;s the mini&s;try would not venture to execute the &s;entence without &s;ome further pretext, which, in order to procure, they employed one Roger Twynho, to pre&s;ent a petition to the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t the duke of Clarence, for having $ubo$$ed a jury to give a fal&s;e verdict again&s;t his kin&s;woman An|keret, la$e wife of William Twynho, e&s;quire, whom he charged with having poi&s;oned his d$tche&s;s; in con&s;equence of which verdict the &s;aid Ankeret had &s;uffered an ignominious death. The parliament, having con&s;idered the merits of this petition, annulled the proce&s;s, as having been unj$&s;tly carried on by the influence of the duke of Clarence; and petitioned that the &s;entence again&s;t that prince might be executed without further delay. Even then they were afraid
<PB N="421" REF="4310">
to run the ri&s;que of popular re&s;entment by a public execution; but he was im|mediately di&s;patched in the Tower, having, according to &s;ome hi&s;torians, been drowned in a butt of malm&s;ey. Such was the end of George duke of Clarence, who left one &s;on called Edward earl of Warwick, and a daughter who was after|wards counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury. The duke's death excited &s;uch a clamour among the populace, that the court thought proper to conceal the manner of his ex|ecution, and gave out that he had died &s;uddenly of grief and vexation: to convince the world that no violence had been u&s;ed, his body was expo&s;ed in St. Paul's church; but this expedient was &s;o &s;tale, tha it &s;erved only to confirm the conjectures of the people, who did not &s;cruple to exclaim with great vehe|mence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the truce between Lewis and Maxi|milian expiring, this la&s;t invaded Burgundy, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;everal places with great facility, on account of the affection of the inhabitants for the hou&s;e of Burgundy; and, in all probability, he would have recovered the whole dutchy, had he been properly &s;upplied by his father. Lewis was not &s;o much afraid of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might receive from the emperor, as of his en|gaging in alliance with Edward, which he employed all his arts to prevent. In the month of July he &s;ent a plenipotentiary to London, to prolong the truce for an hundred years after the death of either party; and to engage for the annual payment of the fifty thou&s;and crowns, while that treaty &s;hould remain in force. As the term which had been affixed for adju&s;ting all differences between the two crowns was expired, the amba&s;&s;ador was likewi&s;e impowered to prolong it for three years; and Edward, appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with this envoy, the propo&s;als of Lewis were embraced without he&s;itation, though the treaty was not concluded till the month of February in the following year. Edward<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry$$r.</NOTE> would have willingly &s;een the con&s;ummation of the marriage-contract between the dauphin and his daughter Elizabeth, before the other tran&s;action &s;hould be fini&s;hed; and &s;ent two amba&s;&s;adors to France to conclude that affair: but, by this time Lewis had &s;ome other match in view for the dauphin; and, as that prince was not yet eight years of age, he found an excu&s;e for delaying the affi|ancing ceremony. Yet, that Edward might not be chagrined at this procra&s;ti|nation, he payed part of the ran&s;om of Margaret of Anjou, which he had en|gaged to liquidate at different terms; and &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Elna to London to offer &s;ecurity for the payment of the fifty thou&s;and crowns, for the long term to which the treaty had been lately extended. The &s;ecurity which the prelate offered was the oath of Lewis, together with bonds of the bank of Medicis, and letters patent confirmed by the e&s;tates of France and the papal authority, denouncing excommunication in ca&s;e of failure. Edward's conduct was now wholly influ|enced by Lewis, or rather by his own mini&s;ters, whom that prince had corrupted. The French king, not contented with having diverted him from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould &s;hare between them the do|minions of that prince&s;s; and that Edward &s;hould have Flanders and Brabant. The propo&s;al was accepted, on condition, that in exchange for the&s;e countries Lewis &s;hould cede Boulogne and &s;ome other places in Picardy to the king of England. This was an article however which the French king would never have performed; and indeed his de&s;ign in propo&s;ing this partition was to amu&s;e Edward, and engage him in a war with Maximilian, who might otherwi&s;e have
<PB N="422" REF="4320">
brought him over to his intere&s;t: but the Engli&s;h monarch was grown too in|dolent to undertake any enterprize that required per&s;onal activity; and he exerted him&s;elf in nothing but in negotiations with foreign princes, who&s;e friend&s;hip might &s;ecure his tranquillity.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Ch $word$</NOTE> The treaty with Denmark having been violated in &s;everal re|&s;pects$ was now renewed and confirmed; and the two kings agreed that a congre&s;s &s;hould be held at Hamburgh, to terminate all differences in an $word$ manner. Notwith&s;tanding the pacification with France, Edward agreed to a propo&s;al of Maximilian, importing, That his infant &s;on Philip &s;hould marry Anne, the third daughter of the king of England; and this convention was ratified by letters patent on both &s;ides, in which the two princes engaged, that for the &s;pace of three years they &s;hould not, without the con&s;ent of each other, be&s;tow their re&s;pective children in marriage. At the &s;ame time Edward projected another match between his fourth daughter Catherine, and John infant of Ca&s;tile and Arragon, &s;on of Ferdinand and I&s;abella; and &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;adors to Spain to manage the negotiation, which however proved ineffec|tual. Tired at length of the delays which retarded the marriage of his elde&s;t daughter, he appointed the lord Howard, and Thomas Langton, trea&s;urer of the church of Exeter, as amba&s;&s;adors extraordinary to demand of Lewis in a preremptory manner the performance of his promi&s;e; and that prince, with all his cunning, found it difficult to elude the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances of the&s;e envoys. He had already de&s;tined the dauphin for the prince&s;s Margaret, the new-born daughter of Maximilian; but he did not think proper to avow his de&s;ign, un|til<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ac$ $word$</NOTE> he &s;hould be in a condition to baffle the re&s;entment of Edward. In the mean time he &s;till practi&s;ed his di&s;&s;imulation; and, as the lord Howard was in his in|tere&s;t, found means to evade the purport of the emba&s;&s;y with general promi&s;es, and the punctual payment of the annuity. But, fore&s;eeing that he &s;hould not be able to amu&s;e Edward much longer, he re&s;olved to employ his attention in a different manner. By his amba&s;&s;ador in Scotland he per&s;uaded James III. to break the truce with England, and invade the territories of Edward. He found no difficulty in this negotiation, as James was wholly governed by three venal up&s;tarts, whom he had rai&s;ed from the du&s;t, in contempt of his antient nobility, who were extremely incen&s;ed at his conduct. The&s;e mini&s;ters, being bribed with French gold, per&s;uaded their ma&s;ter to enter into the views of Lewis; and he began to make preparations which plainly indicated a de&s;ign again&s;t England.</P>

<P>Edward perceived his drift, and i&s;&s;ued orders for levying an army for the defence of the kingdom; and now for the fir&s;t time began to open his eyes to the perfidy and di&s;&s;imulation of Lewis, again&s;t whom he vowed ven|geance: but in the mean time he determined to combat him with his own wea|pons<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of fraud and artifice.

The archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, the bi&s;hop of Dunkeld, the chancellor, and the earl of Ar|gyle, obliged them&s;elves to procure his pardon; and the duke promi&s;ed to ac|knowlege his brother as his &s;overeign, and take the oath of allegiance to him a$new.

<P>The king of England was equally a&s;toni&s;hed and incen&s;ed at this event, which he looked upon as an unpardonable affront offered to his family in the per&s;on of his daughter Elizabeth, who had for &s;ome time been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the appellation of Dauphine&s;s, in which &s;he was now &s;upplanted by an infant. Edward did not con&s;ider that Lewis, on this occa&s;ion, had done no|thing more than retort his own behaviour in the ca&s;e of the lady Bona. He li&s;tened to the &s;ugge&s;tions of his re&s;entment only, which, however, he could not obey with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; for he was now deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Flemings, who favoured Lewis; and the duke of Bretagne was oppre&s;&s;ed with melancholy to &s;uch a degree, that he could no longer manage his own affairs. In &s;pite of all the&s;e di&s;advantages, the king of England re&s;olved to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentr&eacute;.</NOTE> carry war into the bowels of France: he convoked a general a&s;&s;embly of his nobles, who approved of his re&s;olution; and the whole nation rejoiced as much at the pro&s;pect, as if they had already obtained a victory.

<P>IMmediately after the death of the fourth Edward, his &s;on was proclaimed king of England by the name of Edward V. though that young prince, who was but ju&s;t turned o$ twelve years of age, never received the crown, or exerci&s;ed any function of royalty; &s;o that the interval between the death of his father and the u&s;urpation of his uncle, was properly an interregnum, during which the duke of Glouce&s;ter took his mea&s;ures for wre&s;ting the crown from his nephew. Young Edward kept his court at Ludlow-Ca&s;tle in Shrop&s;hire, under the direction of his uncle Anthony earl of Rivers, who had been appointed his governor. His uterine brother Sir Richard Gray enjoyed another great $ffice about his per&s;on; Sir Thomas Vaughan was his chamb$rlain; and all the other po&s;ts of his hou&s;hold were filled with the queen's creatures. Notwith|&s;tanding the a&s;cendancy &s;he had acquired over the late king, &s;he had never
<PB N="427" REF="4370">
been able to prevail upon him to di&s;mi&s;s from his council &s;ome old officers and &s;ervants, who had adhered to him in all the vici&s;&s;itudes of his fortune. The&s;e were well acquainted with her endeavours; and &s;uppo&s;ing their &s;afety con&s;i&s;ted in their union, formed a party for their mutual defence and &s;upport, as well as to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of Elizabeth and her family. At the head of this party, were Henry Stafford duke of Buckingham, William lord Ha&s;tings, and Tho|mas lord Stanley. The fir&s;t was de&s;cended from a daughter of Thomas of Wode&s;toke duke of Glouce&s;ter, and &s;on of Edward III. and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the of|fice of lord high con&s;table; the lord Ha&s;tings was chamberlain, and particu|larly beloved by Edward IV. on account of his un&s;haken attachment and fide|lity; and the lord Stanley was the repre&s;entative of an antient family, and a nobleman of virtue and courage, devoted to the intere&s;t of his ma&s;ter. The&s;e three were con&s;idered as the chiefs of the antient nobility, in contradi&s;tinction to tho&s;e who had been enobled by the queen's influence; and tho' their credit in the council was not equal to that of the Widevilles and Grays, they di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves with great &s;pirit in the oppo&s;ition, and the king had been often ob|liged to interpo&s;e in their di&s;putes. The duke of Glouce&s;ter would have been very much perplexed between the&s;e two parties, had he not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an un|common fund of &s;agacity and di&s;&s;imulation; for, in order to live upon good terms with the king, he was obliged to cultivate the good graces of his &s;i&s;ter-in-law; and, in behaving re&s;pectfully to her, he ran the ri&s;que of di&s;obliging the antient nobility, upon who$e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he in a great mea&s;ure depended for the accom|pli&s;hment of his de&s;igns: he therefore made his court in public to the queen; but, at the &s;ame time, engaged in private connexions with the duke of Bucking|ham and his party. Edward, on his death-bed, had &s;trongly recommended unanimity and coalition to the two factions: he had even propo&s;ed a reconciliation, to which they readily con&s;ented; and the ceremony was performed in his pre|&s;ence. The queen engaged for the earl of Rivers, who was ab&s;ent, and her elde&s;t &s;on the marquis of Dor&s;et embraced the duke of Buckingham and lord Ha&s;tings, with all the exterior marks of cordiality. The duke of Glouce&s;ter being then at York on his maje&s;ty's affairs, could not ob&s;truct this accommo|dation, which would have been very prejudicial to his intere&s;t, had the parties been &s;incere in their pro$e&s;$ions. But, this was not the ca&s;e.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>As &s;oon as Edward's eyes were clo&s;ed, they forgot their mutual pro|te&s;tations; and each faction exerted all its efforts to gain the advantage over the other, in &s;ecuring the per&s;on of the young king, in who&s;e name they might be able to govern the kingdom. The queen, upon the death of her hu&s;band, di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to her brother Rivers, with the tidings of that event, and a letter, in which &s;he advi&s;ed him to rai&s;e a body of troops in Wales, and conduct the new king to London, that he might be crowned immediately. On the other hand, the duke of Buckingham and the lord Ha&s;tings made the duke of Glouce&s;ter acquainted with his brother's death, and the queen's mea|&s;ures; and as the protector&s;hip of the realm, of right belonged to him during the king's mino$$ty, they exhorted him to claim his privilege, offering to pro|vide a body of a thou&s;and men well armed, which &s;hould be ready to march at his command. Richa$d de&s;ired they would meet him at Northampton, where they accordingly $&s;$$mbled with a great number of their friends; and there, in a &s;tu$ied h$rrangue, he expatiated on the danger to which they would be ex|po&s;ed,

&s;hou$$ the queen continue at the head of the admini&s;tration. He ob|$$rved, t$$t i$ was bo$h his right, and his intere&s;t, to manage the reins of go|v$rnment d$ring the $$nority of his nephew; th$t every body knew the at|tachment he h$d con$t$nt$y pre&s;erved $or his brother; that his tender affection f$r Edwar$'s ch$ldren wou$d not &s;uffer him to abandon them to the di&s;cretion of people, who$e &s;ole view was to aggrandize them&s;elves at the expence of their &s;overeign; for $hic$ rea&s;on, he was re&s;olved to u&s;e all his endeavours for the good of the nation, and the advantage of the young king, on whom he would b$&s;tow &s;uch education $s would enable him to follow the &s;teps of his glorious a$ce&s;tors: but, that as &s;uch a project could not be executed without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|$$ce of true hearted Engli&s;hmen, he had a&s;&s;embled them to con&s;ult about the mea&s;ures which ought to be t$ken at the pre&s;ent juncture; and declared, that he would be wholly conducted by their advice. Having thus prepared the mind$ of the audience for the execution of his purpo&s;e, they entered into a &s;erious con|&s;ult$tion about the means for rendering them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the king's per&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$$ T.

They re&s;olved to appear extremely zealous for the intere&s;t of their new &s;overeign, that the queen might have no pretence for a&s;&s;embling or maintaining an army; that the duke of Glouce&s;ter &s;hould per&s;uade her to di&s;mi&s;s the troops that were already levied; and, &s;hould his arguments &s;ucceed, endeavour to &s;ecure the king's per&s;on before his arrival in London. But, &s;hould the queen turn a deaf ear to his remon&s;trances, he determined to amu&s;e her with negotiations, until he &s;hould be in a condition to oppo&s;e her de&s;igns in a more effectual manner.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>This plan being projected, Ha&s;tings returned to London, where he had acquired great popularity; and the duke of Glouce&s;ter wrote a letter of condolance to the queen, in which, after the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, regard, and loyalty, to her and his young &s;overeign, he exhorted her to u&s;e her be&s;t endeavours to bani&s;h all jealous animo&s;ity that might &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the nobles; and to confirm the reconciliation which had been &s;o lately, and &s;o happily effected. He ob&s;erved, that her levying troops for the defence of the king$ at a time when the whole nation &s;eemed to breathe one &s;pirit of loy|alty and affection, might wake the jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion of tho&s;e noblemen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi$$. Croy|l$$d.</NOTE> who had been reconciled to her family: that their &s;u&s;picion would naturally prompt them to take mea&s;ures for their own pre&s;ervation: and that one mi&s;|under&s;tanding might produce another, until the whole kingdom &s;hould be in|volved in civil war and confu&s;ion. In order to prevent the&s;e calamities, he earne&s;tly intreated her to di&s;band her troops, that all the nobles of the kingdom might, without fear or &s;u&s;picion, pay their re&s;pects to their young &s;overeign, and con|$$ibute with all their power towards the maintenance of the public tranquillity. The queen had no rea&s;on to doubt the &s;incerity of Glouce&s;ter, who had always treated her with the utmo&s;t deference, and manife&s;ted uncommon zeal for the intere&s;t of her children: &s;he believed his letter was the effect of his loyalty and good &s;en&s;e. As he had not yet dropped the lea&s;t hint of his intention to claim the admini&s;tration, &s;he followed his advice as the whole&s;ome coun&s;el of a friend; and, &s;ent an order to Rivers to di&s;band his forces, that they might not give umbrage to the nation.</P>

Young Edward was met by the dukes of Glouce&s;ter and Buckingham, in the neighbourhood of Northampton, which they had already &s;ecured with nine hun|dred men; and they approached him with marks of the mo&s;t profound regard and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Glouce&s;ter told him, that as the town of Northampton was crouded with &s;trangers, his maje&s;ty would be more at his ea&s;e in Stony-Stratford, about twelve miles farther on the London road, where they would join him in the morning, and in the mean time pa&s;s the night at Northampton. His propo&s;al being approved, they invited the earl of Rivers to make merry with them at their lodgings; and he accompanied them to Northampton, glad of this opportunity to cement the late reconciliation by his unre&s;erved compliance. They &s;pent good part of the night in &s;eeming harmony, and mutual profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip; but, next morning they ordered him to be put in arre&s;t, and &s;et out for Stony-Stratford, where they found the king ready to proceed on his jour|ney. Before they quitted that place, they took occa&s;ion to quarrel with his uterine brother Sir Richard Gray, whom they accu&s;ed of having, in conjunction with the marquis of Dor&s;et, and the earl of Rivers, formed a de&s;ign to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the king's per&s;on: they likewi&s;e affirmed, that the mar|quis had &s;eized the trea&s;ure of the late king, with which he was intru&s;ted. Ed|ward him&s;elf interpo&s;ing on this occa&s;ion, &s;aid he would not pretend to ju&s;tify the conduct of Dor&s;et, with which he was unacquainted; but, that he would an&s;wer for his uncle Rivers, and his brother Richard, who had been always with him &s;ince his father's decea&s;e. The duke of Buckingham told his maje&s;ty, they were too cunning to make him acquainted with their &s;chemes; and imme|diately ordered his followers to take Sir Richard Gray, and Sir Thomas Vaughan, into cu&s;tody. The king was conveyed back to Northampton; and the next day, the pri&s;oners were &s;ent to the ca&s;tle of Pontefract, notwith&s;tand|ing the intreaties and tears of Edward, which flowed in great abundance; tho' they &s;till treated him with all the exterior marks of the mo&s;t re&s;pectful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>The queen was no &s;ooner informed of the&s;e proceedings, than &s;he com|prehended the whole &s;cheme of the duke of Glouce&s;ter, and looking upon her brother and two &s;ons as lo&s;t, fled for refuge to the &s;anctuary in We&s;tmin&s;ter, with the duke of York, who was about nine years of age, the marquis of Dor|&s;et, and the re&s;t of her children. The lord Ha&s;tings having received an ac|count of the tran&s;action at Northampton, repaired immediately to the hou&s;e of the archbi&s;hop of York, to whom he communicated the&s;e tidings; a&s;&s;uring him at the &s;ame time, that no harm was intended to the king, to whom indeed, he was &s;incerely attached, without knowing the de&s;igns of Glouce&s;ter. The archbi&s;hop aro&s;e immediately from his bed; and, tho' it was midnight, went to vi&s;it the queen, whom he found &s;itting on the floor in the utmo&s;t agony of di&s;tre&s;s, deploring the fate of her children. The prelate endeavoured to con|&s;ole her with the a&s;&s;urances of Ha&s;tings; but, &s;he could derive no comfort from any thing which came from that quarter. Then he prote&s;ted, that if her enemies &s;hould be wicked enough to take away the life of the king, he would forthwith crown the duke of York; and as a pledge of his &s;incerity, he left the great &s;eal in her hands: but afterwards reflecting, that he ought not to have parted with that mark of the late king's confidence, he de&s;ired it might be &s;ent back, and &s;he complied with his reque&s;t. Mean while, the news of the affair
<PB N="430" REF="4400">
at Northampton filled the whole city of London with tumult and con&s;terna|tion; and a great number of the citizens took to their arms, without knowing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowe.</NOTE> what would be the con&s;equence of Glouce&s;ter's conduct. But, their fears were appea&s;ed by the lord Ha&s;tings, who a&s;&s;ured them, that the king was in no danger; and that Rivers and Gray had been apprehended for a con&s;piracy again&s;t the lives of the dukes of Glouce&s;ter and Buckingham; but that they would be fairly tried by the laws of their country.</P>

<P>In a few days after this di&s;turbance, the king was brought to Lon|don, which he entered amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, accompanied by the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who rode behind him bare-headed, and a great num|ber of noblemen, who &s;eemed zealou&s;ly attached to his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. He was conducted to the bi&s;hop's palace, as a place of &s;afety, under the protection of the citizens; and this mark of confidence, together with the re&s;pect which was paid to the per&s;on of the king, intirely di&s;&s;ipated tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions which the affair of Northampton had produced. Immediately after the rejoicings which were made on the king's arrival, the duke of Glouce&s;ter convoked a great council of the nobility, to regulate the admini&s;tration; and the&s;e being chiefly compo&s;ed of his own friends, or &s;uch as hated the queen's family, he was declared Protector of the King and Kingdom; tho' the council on this occa&s;ion u&s;$rped a prerogative which re&s;ided in the parliament alone. As &s;oon as Richard found him&s;elf ve&s;ted with this high office, he deprived the arch|bi&s;hop of York of the great &s;eal, which he gave to the bi&s;hop of Lincoln; and filled with his own creatures all tho&s;e places which had been occupied by the queen's adherents. Then he propo&s;ed in council, that a deputation &s;hould be &s;ent to de&s;ire the queen would allow the duke of York to attend his brother, and be pre&s;ent at his coronation. He ob&s;erved, that Elizabeth's retreat into the &s;anctuary implied a di&s;tru&s;t, which might kindle jealou&s;ies, and revive fac|tions, to the manife&s;t prejudice of the nation: that the circum&s;tance of York's remaining in the a&s;ylum, while his brother received the crown, would di&s;grace the government in the eyes of foreign potentates: and that, in all probability, the queen's de&s;ign was to e&s;cape from the &s;anctuary, and rai&s;e a flame in the kingdom, on pretence of defending her &s;econd &s;on from violence. It was therefore, his opinion, that the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury &s;hould endeavour to per&s;uade the queen to part with the duke of York; and that, &s;hould &s;he refu&s;e to comply in this particular with the de&s;ire of the council, the duke of York &s;hould be taken from her by force. The archbi&s;hop undertook to per&s;uade her to compliance; but vehemently oppo&s;ed the propo&s;al for violating the &s;anc|tuary, which had been &s;o long kept &s;acred. The duke of Buckingham in|veighed again&s;t the abu&s;e of &s;anctuaries, and &s;econded the opinion of the pro|tector, which was e&s;pou&s;ed by all the re&s;t of the council, the eccle&s;ia&s;tics<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> excepted.</P>

<P>The cardinal archbi&s;hop being &s;ent as deputy from the council to the queen, employed all his eloquence in vain, to per&s;uade her that &s;he ought to part with the duke of York; and finding her inflexible, plainly told her, that a re|&s;olution was taken to withdraw him by force from the &s;anctuary. The haple&s;s mother, terrified at this declaration, imparted to the cardinal her &s;u&s;picions of Glouce&s;ter, whom &s;he taxed with a de&s;ign upon the crown, which he could not accompli&s;h without having both her &s;ons in his power. The archbi&s;hop, who
<PB N="431" REF="4410">
never dreamed of Richard's ambition, took umbrage at the queen's in&s;inua|tions; and told her with great warmth, that her &s;u&s;picions were injurious to the character of a prince who had nothing more at heart than the intere&s;t of his &s;overeign, as well as to the honour of the nobility and prelates in council, who could not be &s;o wicked as to concur in any &s;uch trea&s;onable de&s;ign. He &s;aid that, without their concurrence, the protector would find &s;uch a &s;cheme impracticable; tho' he was fully per&s;uaded in his own mind, that no thought of that nature ever entered the brea&s;t of the duke of Glouce&s;ter. The good cardinal was really convinced of the protector's integrity; therefore his di&s;|cour&s;e was the more emphatic, and had the greater effect upon Elizabeth, who began to abate in her apprehen&s;ion, tho' not &s;o much, but that in parting with her &s;on, &s;he &s;hed a torrent of tears, and underwent the mo&s;t violent agi|tation of &s;orrow. At length, after having embraced him with all the eagerne&s;s of maternal affection, heightened by the fear of lo&s;ing the beloved obj$ct for ever, &s;he delivered him into the hands of the archbi&s;hop, by whom he was con|ducted to the protector; and Richard received him with all the marks of p$|rental tenderne&s;s, de&s;iring he would look upon him as his guardian and father. The two young princes &s;eemed extremely happy at meeting, and began to think their uncle Richard &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ions of duty and friend&s;hip: but, this happine&s;s was not of long duration; for, in a few days, they were conveyed from the bi&s;hop's palace to the Tower, from whence the kings of England u&s;ed to ride in proce&s;&s;ion through the &s;treets of London to their coronation at We&s;t|min&s;ter; a cu&s;tom which now furni&s;hed Glouce&s;ter with a pretext for &s;ecuring his nephews in clo&s;e cu&s;tody.</P>

<P>It was at this juncture that Richard is &s;aid to have communicated his &s;cheme to the duke of Buckingham, who was a nobleman without principle; and therefore ea&s;ily engaged in the project of Glouce&s;ter, who promi&s;ed to re|compence his &s;ervices with a grant of certain lands in Hereford&s;hire, the late king's wardrobe, and a patent for rendering the office of con&s;table hereditary in his family. The protector having &s;ecured Buckingham in his intere&s;t, re|&s;olved to rid his hands of the pri&s;oners at Pontefract, who&s;e death would de|prive the royal family of their chief &s;upport. For this purpo&s;e he held con&s;ul|tations with his friends, and found Ha&s;tings particularly plea&s;ed with the de|&s;ign of di&s;patching Rivers and Gray, who had done him many ill offices in the late reign. The lord Howard likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ented to the &s;cheme for the &s;ame rea|&s;on; and Sir Thomas Radcliffe governor of Pontefract, received in&s;tructions to put it in execution. He had already a&s;&s;embled five thou&s;and men for the &s;er|vice of Richard; &s;o that having nothing to fear from the re&s;entment of the people in the neighbourhood, he cau&s;ed the earl of Rivers, Sir Richard Gray, and Sir Thomas Vaughan, to be beheaded, without any form of trial. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir T.

<P>In the mean time the duke of Glouce&s;ter endeavoured to engage in his &s;ervice a great number of profligate per&s;ons of de&s;perate fortunes, without fear, con&s;cience, or any other principle of action than &s;elf-intere&s;t; who would execute his commands and directions, how wicked and cruel &s;oever they might be, without remor&s;e or he&s;itation. While he privately inli&s;ted this band of de&s;peradoes, he &s;till maintained his di&s;&s;imulation in the eyes of the world, af|fecting to prepare for the coronation of his nephew, at which he &s;ummoned all gentlemen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing forty pounds a year, to attend and receive the honour of

<P>The&s;e reports were di&s;&s;eminated in &s;uch an artful manner, that they g$$ned credit among the lower cla&s;s of people, while they gave umbrage to tho&s;e nob$emen who were attached to the family of the late king, and in particular<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> to lord Ha&s;tings, who was &s;t$$l intirely ignorant of Richard's real de&s;ign. The pro$ector was well acquainted with his &s;entiments; but had hitherto lived upon terms of friend&s;hip with him, on account of his great intere&s;t in the city of London; nor was he altogether without hope of bringing him intirely over to his intere&s;t. He $ikewi&s;e cultivated a &s;eeming friend&s;hip with the two archbi|&s;hops, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and the lord Stanley, who were well-wi&s;hers to the two young princes, becau&s;e he found his account in their countenance; and re&s;olved to wear the ma&s;que until he &s;hould have no further occa&s;ion for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>Mean while, Richard thought it was now high time, either to make a convert of Ha&s;tings to his views, or to de&s;troy him at once: for this purpo&s;e he employed Cate&s;by to &s;ound that nobleman, touching his opinion of the pro|tector's right, which happened at that time to be the common &s;ubject of conver|&s;ation. Ha&s;tings not only refuted all the &s;ugge&s;tions concerning the ba&s;tardy of Edward and his children; but a&s;&s;ured Cate&s;by, that he would with all his intere&s;t, and even his heart's blood, &s;upport the young princes again&s;t all their enemies. This declaration was immediately reported to the protector, who being extremely de&s;irous of engaging Ha&s;tings in his de&s;ign, directed Cate&s;by to try him once more, and even hint the project which was formed for the exclu&s;ion of his nephews. Cate&s;by, in this &s;econd conver&s;ation, found him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabian.</NOTE> more than ever determined to oppo&s;e any enterprize that &s;hould be formed again&s;t his ma&s;ter's children; and Richard, for that very rea&s;on, devoted him to immediate death. He repaired in the morning to the council in the Tower, where he behaved with remarkable affability to the members, and after &s;ome &s;tay withdrew, de&s;iring them to continue their deliberations, and give the la&s;t orders touching the ceremony of the coronation, which had been too long de|layed. In about an hour after his departure, he returned with a frowning a&s;pect, biting his lips, and exhibiting all the marks of internal agitation. After &s;ome pau&s;e, <Q>&startq;My lords, (&s;aid he) what puni&s;hment do tho&s;e de&s;erve who have con|&s;pired again&s;t my life?&endq;</Q> The whole council was confounded at this que&s;tion; and the lord Ha&s;tings replied, in the name of the re&s;t, that whoever was guilty of &s;uch a crime ought to be puni&s;hed as a traitor. <Q>&startq;It is no other (cried Rich|ard) than that &s;orcere&s;s my &s;i&s;ter-in-law, with her accomplices.&endq;</Q> Before his hearers had time to recollect them&s;elves from the fear and a&s;toni&s;hment which this prelude produced, he bared his left arm which was withered, and pre&s;ent|ing it to the council, <Q>&startq;Behold, (&s;aid he) what that &s;orcere&s;s, and the wretched Shore have done by the power of their incantations! they have reduced this arm to the condition in which you now &s;ee it; and the re&s;t of my body would have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, if, by the &s;ingular protection of heaven, their in|famous practices had not been di&s;covered.&endq;</Q> The&s;e words redoubled their amaze|ment and terror, as they well knew his arm had been always in that &s;hrivelled condition; and as they were fully per&s;uaded, that if the queen had formed any &s;uch de&s;ign, &s;he would never have communicated it to Jane Shore, who had been the concubine of her hu&s;band, and now lived on the &s;ame footing with the lord Ha&s;tings, who was the queen's profe&s;&s;ed enemy. This nobleman could not help expre&s;&s;ing his doubts about the truth of the information, by &s;aying, if they were guilty, they de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed. <Q>&startq;How!

&s;aid, "I arre&s;t thee for the crime of trea&s;on." "Who, me, my lord!" re|p$ied that un$ortunate nobleman: "Yes, thee, thou traitor," exclaimed the pro$ector, and ordered him to be &s;eized by the &s;oldiers. This arre&s;t occa&s;ioned a $umult in the apartment, during which one of the &s;oldiers attempted to cleave the head of lord Stanley with a battle-ax, on pretence of keeping the peace, but $e mi&s;&s;ed his aim; and Stanley, by creeping under the table, &s;aved his life at the expence of a dangerous wound. Neverthele&s;s, he was arre&s;ted, toge|ther with the archbi&s;hop of York, and the bi&s;hop of Ely: but as for Ha&s;tings, Richard was &s;o bent upon his de$$ruction, that he &s;wore he would not dine, until hi$ head &s;hould be &s;evered from his &s;houlders; &s;o that he had ju&s;t time to confe&s;s him&s;elf to the fir$t prie&s;t that could be found, and then was beheaded on a log of timber.</P>

<P>Richard, knowing how much Ha&s;tings was beloved by the citizens of London, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e &s;ome pretext for this precipitate execu|tion, and &s;ent a me$$age to the mayor and aldermen, de&s;iring to &s;ee them im|medi$$$ly. In the mean time he and Buckingham ca&s;ed them&s;elves up in ru&s;ty armour; and when the magi$$racy of London repaired to the Tower, in obe|dience to his me&s;&s;age, $e told them that the lord Ha&s;tings and &s;ome others h$d co$&s;pired again&s;t his life. He &s;aid he had not been informed of their de&s;ign till ten in the morning, when the proofs appeared &s;o plain, that the king and cou$cil thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to execute Ha&s;tings without delay, as they under&s;tood a great number of people were ready to ri&s;e in his favour; that, in &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ing emergency, he was fain to put on the fir&s;t armour he could find, for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on; and that he had &s;ent for them to be witne&s;&s;es of the truth, that they might inform the people, and prevent or ap|pea$$ the tumults which ill-de&s;igning per&s;ons might rai&s;e in the city. The mayor and aldermen $aw through the pretext: they dur&s;t not, however, &s;ignify<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Th. Mo$e.</NOTE> their real &s;entiments, but promi&s;ed to obey his orders, and withdrew. Imme|diately after this conference, a proclamation was publi&s;hed in the king's name, d$$laring that, as the lord Ha&s;tings had entered into a con&s;piracy to &s;eize his maje&s;ty's per&s;on, and &s;lay the protector and the duke of Buckingham, that he might govern the realm according to his own plea&s;ure, the king, for the prevention of this wicked de&s;ign, had, by the advice of his council, puni&s;hed him without delay: that no per&s;on was eve$ more de&s;erving of the death of a tr$itor th$$ Ha&s;tings, who had advi&s;ed the late king to take &s;o many fatal &s;teps contrary to the liberty and privileges of the people: that he had been the con|d$ctor and companion of Edward's debauchery: and that he had &s;pent the la&s;t $ight with Jane Shore, the accomplice of all his crimes, and of that in parti|cular for which he &s;uffered. This proclamation contained many other a&s;per|&s;ions calculated to dimini&s;h the affection which the people had always expre&s;&s;ed for lord Ha$tings, and anticipate their compa&s;&s;ion; but it did not produce the de$ired effect. Jane Shore being apprehended and brought before the council, the duke of Glouce&s;ter accu&s;ed her of having practi&s;ed witchcraft, and entered into the con&s;piracy of Ha$$ings again&s;t his life. But &s;he made her innocence appear &s;o plain, that they could not, with any &s;hadow of ju&s;tice, condemn her upon this accu&s;ation: then &s;he was pro&s;ecuted for the irregularities of her life, which &s;he could not deny; and being delivered to the eccle$ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, was condemned to do public penance in St. Paul's church, and to walk in pro|ce&s;&s;ion

This was a juncture at which he re&s;olved to manife&s;t his intention; but, as he de&s;ired to have the approbation of the Londoners, he con&s;$lted with his confident the duke of Buckingham, about means for procuring this advan|tage. They re&s;olved to redouble their indu&s;try in per&s;uading the people that the children of Edward were ba&s;tards, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that tho&s;e whom their $mi$$aries could not convince, would be deterred from attempting to undeceive their neighbours. Doctor Ralf Shaw, the mayor's brother, preached a &s;er$on at St. Paul's Cro&s;s, in which he not only enlarged upon Edward's previous marriage with Elizabeth Lucy, which rendered his other children illegitimate, but al&s;o expatiated upon the ba&s;tardy of Edward him&s;elf and his brother Clarence, who he affirmed were begotten by per&s;ons whom the dutche&s;s of York admitted to her bed in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band: then he made a tran&s;ition to the duke of $louce&s;ter, whom he repre&s;ented as the true &s;on of York, whom he perfectly $e&s;emb$ed in his features as well as in his virtues, and poured forth an extrava|gant panegyric on this prince, during which he int$nded to have pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the p$ople, in hope that, moved by the cloquence of the preacher, they would have &s;al$ted him as king. The duke, however, did not arrive un|til the doctor had exhau&s;ted his encomium, and began to di&s;cu&s;s another &s;ub|ject. Neverthele&s;s, &s;eeing the protector approach, he repeated his prai&s;e with the mo&s;t $ul&s;ome exaggeration, while Richard walked through the croud to his place. But, in&s;tead of hearing the acclamation of "Long live king Richard!" he &s;aw the audience hang their heads in profound &s;ilence, dete&s;ting the ven$|lity of the preacher, who for$eited all his popularity by this &s;hameful pro&s;titu|tion of his talent, and concealed him&s;elf in retirement, where he &s;oon died of &s;orrow and remor&s;e.</P>

<P>Shaw's &s;ermon having been &s;o unfavourably received, the duke of Buckingham, who was $amed for his elocution, undertook to harrangue the people on the Tue&s;day following at Guildhall; there the aldermen and com|mon council being a&s;&s;embled by the lord mayor, the duke re&s;umed the topics which doctor Shaw had handled &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sfully. He told them, the lords in council and commons of the kingdom, had declared that no ba&s;tard &s;hould $it upon the throne of England, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the crown's being adjudged to the duke of Glouce&s;ter, the only &s;on of the late duke of York: he &s;aid there was rea&s;on to fear that magnanimous prince would reject the offer; but he hoped that if all the people, e&s;pecially the citizens of London, would unite in their &s;ollicitations, Richard might be per&s;uaded to bear the weighty bur$hen of government, which was too heavy for an infant's &s;houlders. He therefore de|&s;ired, in his own name, and that of the council, they would declare their opi|nion; and here he pau&s;ed, in expectation of hearing them exclaim <Q>&startq;King Ri|chard! King Richard!&endq;</Q> But, to his great &s;urprize, an univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed. He repeated his harrangue with &s;ome variation$ and &s;till they con|tinued mute and mclancholy. He then expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure to the mayor,
<PB N="$36" REF="4460">
who told him, that the people were not u&s;ed to be harrangued by any per&s;on but the recorder, who was the city orator. This officer being ordered to &s;peak, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, recapitulated all that the duke had &s;aid; and concluded with de&s;iring they would an&s;wer po&s;$tively, whether o$ not they would have the duke of Glouce$ter for their king. A confu&s;ed murmur ran through the mul|tit$de; and &s;ome of the duke's dome$tics, having in&s;inuated them&s;elves among the c$oud, cri$$ "Long live king Richard!" A few bu$ghers, who had been previou&s;ly corrupted, joined in this acclamation; and the apprentices and popul$ce who &s;tood at the ga$e threw up their caps in honour of the duke of Glouce&s;ter. Buckingh$m, commanding &s;ilence, told them, he was rejoiced to $$nd his propo&s;al met with &s;uch univer&s;al approbation; and de&s;ired they would $$et him next day at the &s;ame time and place, that they might go to|gether and p$e&s;ent an humble &s;upplication to his highne&s;s, be&s;eeching him to mou$t the thro$e, and govern the people as his own &s;ubjects.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot. Parl.</NOTE> The c$$izens were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for that day. On the $orrow, the duke of B$cking$$m, with the mayor, aldermen, and a multitude of the pro|tecto$'s $$$ere$ts, rep$ired to Ba$nard's-Ca&s;tle, where he re&s;ided, in order to pre$ent an addre&s;s, in the name of the three e&s;tates, declaring the b$&s;tardy of Edward's children; and intreating him to a&s;&s;ume the crow$, which was his true inhe$i$ance. Richard pretended to be terrified at &s;uch a concour&s;e of pe$|ple, as if he had thought they came with &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign upon his per&s;on$ and when at length Buckingham prevailed upon him to give them audience, he came forth with all the marks of terror and di&s;tru&s;t. He affec$ed g$eat &s;urp$i$e at the$$ propo&s;al, which he declined, ob&s;erving that he loved his brother's chil|dren above all the crowns in the world: though he con&s;idered their addre&s;s as a proof of their affection, which he &s;hould never forget. He exhorted them to live quie$$y under the &s;overeign to whom they owed their obedience; and he p$omi&s;ed for him&s;elf that he would, to the be&s;t of his power, advi&s;e his $$phew to govern in &s;uch a manner as to render his people flouri&s;hing and happy. The duke of Buckingham, appearing very much di&s;&s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, de|clared, that the people were unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved that none of Edward's chil|dren &s;$ould &s;it upon the throne; and that, if he would not receive the crown, they &s;hould be obliged to offer it to &s;ome other per&s;on. This declara$io$ &s;oftened the protector into compliance. He told them, that &s;ince they were determined to reject the children of Edward, he was contented to accept the crown, which was undoubtedly his lawful inheritance, though he r$ceived it with more plea&s;ure, as the free gift of a free people. This conde&s;cen&s;ion in Ri|chard was applauded with loud acclamations. Next day he repaired to We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, where, placing him&s;elf in the royal &s;eat, he made a &s;peech to the audience, and gave the judges a &s;trict charge for the due admini&s;tration of ju$tice.</P>

<P>This farce being acted with all imaginable &s;ucce&s;s, the duke of Glou|ce&s;ter was proclaimed king of England and France, by the name of Richard III. on the twenty-&s;econd day of June, and the &s;ixth day of July fixed for the ce|remony o$ his coronation, which he deferred till that time, in expectation of being reinforced by five thou&s;and men from the north, as he did not much confide in the attachment of the Londoners. During this interval, he con|ferred the office of chancellor upon the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, who was one of his
<PB N="437" REF="4470">
favourites. He be&s;towed the office of mare&s;chal on lord John Howard, toge|ther with the title of duke of Norfolk; and next day appointed him high con$t$|ble for the coronation. His &s;on Thomas Howard was created earl of S$rrey; William Berkeley was promoted to the title of earl of Nottingham; and l$$d Lovel, one of Richard'$ chief confidents, was rai&s;ed to t$$ title of vi&s;count. T$om$$ Rotheram archbi&s;hop of York was di&s;charged from confinement; and the lord Stanley was not only relea&s;ed, but even appointed &s;teward of the hou&s;hold: not that Richard had any real regard for this nobleman, but this indulgence was the effect of his apprehen&s;ion; for Stanley's &s;o$ the lord Strange had b$$$n to levy troops in Lincoln&s;hire, and Richard thought this w$$ the mo$$ $word$ ex|pedient for preventing the con&s;equences of a rebellion. Th$ u$$ver&s;i$y of Ox|ford pre&s;ented a petition in favour of Morton bi$$op of Ely$ and though the new king mortally hated that prelate, he would $ot, in $he beginning of his reign, di&s;oblige &s;uch a venerable body by a $word$ refu&s;$$: nor would he &s;et the bi&s;hop altogether at liberty; but he cho&s;e a medium, and commit$ed $word$ $o the ca$e of the duke of Buckingham, who &s;ent him to his ca$$le of B$$ckno$$ in Wal$$. On the &s;ixth day of July, he and Anne his queen, daughter of Richard<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Th. More.</NOTE> earl of Warwick, were crowned with great po$p $word$ We&s;tmin&s;ter. All the $o|blemen in the kingdom a&s;&s;i&s;ted at this ceremony, that they might not, by their ab&s;ence, inc$r the &s;u&s;picion of the new king, who&s;e character was &s;o $ormid$ble; and the queen's train was borne up by Margare$ coun$$$$ of Richmond, wi$$ of lord Stanley, and mother to the earl of Richmond the$ $n exile in Brittany.</P>

<P>Richard now &s;eemed &s;ecure from all oppo&s;iti$n. There was not a nobleman in the kingdom who had intere$$ enough to rai&s;e the lea&s;t di&s;t$r|bance, except tho&s;e who were intirely devoted to his intere&s;t. The queen dow|ager, with her five daughters, and her brother the m$rquis of Dor&s;et, &s;till re|mained in the &s;anctuary. Sir Richard Wideville lived in concealment; while Edward V. and his brother the duke of York continued clo&s;e pri&s;oners in the Tower, the government of which was conferred on Sir Richard Brackenbury, on who&s;e $idelity Richard placed the greate&s;t dependence. Neverthele&s;s, th$t he might &s;trengthen his power with foreign alliances, and prevent his enemies from receiving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance abroad, he &s;ent Bernard de la Force as his amba&s;|&s;ador into Ca&s;tile, to renew the antient alliance with Ferdinand and $&s;abe$$a. He appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with France about certain infractions of the truce, that it might be renewed and confirmed; he ve&s;ted Thomas Hut|ton with full power to prolong the truce with Francis II. duke of Brittany; and this amba&s;&s;ador received in&s;tructions about a new treaty with that prince, touching his delivering up the earl of Richmond. <NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer.</NOTE></P>

<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures being taken, Richard is &s;aid to have compa$$ed the death of his two nephews in the Tower; and, in order to avoid the &s;u&s;pi|cion of being concerned in this tragedy, to have made a progre&s;s through &s;e|veral counties, on pretence of reforming the abu&s;es which had $$$pt into the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. In the cour&s;e of this circuit he re&s;ided &s;ome time at Glouce&s;ter, which he affected to favour as the place from which he d$rived his title. He was accompanied by the duke of Buckingham, who now &s;eemed to think his &s;ervices could never be &s;ufficiently recompenced, and was become &s;o arrogant, that the king found it nece&s;&s;ary to humble his pride. When re&s;o|lutions of this kind are taken, opportunities are never wanting. Richard af|fected
<PB N="438" REF="4480">
to treat him &s;uperciliou&s;ly, and even to refu&s;e &s;ome little favours he had occa&s;ion to a&s;k; for, with regard to the e&s;tate of Hereford, which &s;ome hi|&s;torians have made the cau&s;e of this difference, it appears, by a grant of Richard, mentioned by Dugdale, that the duke had actually received all the lands he could have rea&s;onably claimed, as belonging to that family from which he was de&s;cended. In all probability therefore, he took umbrage at &s;ome other re|pu$&s;e or mortifying &s;light; and having obtained permi&s;&s;ion to go and regulate his dome&s;tic affairs, retired in di&s;gu&s;t to his ca&s;tle of Brecknock. After his departure, the king proceeded to the execution of the &s;cheme he had projected for making away with his nephews in the Tower. He had $ounded Brakenbury the governor upon this &s;ubject; and finding him too con&s;cientious to be con|cerned in the perpetr$tion of &s;uch a cruel murder, he employed Sir James Tyr|rel, who had acted as a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in-general during the reign of Edward IV. under the title of vice-con&s;table, by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion, impowering him to take cog|niz$nce of all ca&s;es of trea&s;on; and, upon a bare in&s;pection of the fact, &s;ee ju&s;tice immediately executed upon the criminal, without noi&s;e, form of trial, or appeal. This murdering commi&s;&s;ion was renewed by Richard; and Tyr|rel, having received his in&s;tructions, found acce&s;s to the Tower, where he is &s;$$d to have taken away the lives of the two innocent princes, by the hands of two ru$$ians, who &s;mothered them in their beds, and buried their bodies under $ &s;tair-ca&s;e. This is the account given by Sir Thomas More, which ought to be read with caution, becau&s;e written in the &s;ub&s;equent reign, when every hi|&s;torian and writer endeavoured to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the favour of Henry, by bl$ckening the character of his predece&s;&s;or. True it is Tyrrel is &s;aid to have con$$&s;&s;ed the f$ct, when he was arre&s;ted for trea&s;on again&s;t Henry; but very little dependence ought to be pl$ced on extorted confe&s;&s;ions. At this period, the two young princes certainly di&s;appeared; and, in the reign of Charles II. the workmen employed in repairing that part of the Tower, found the bones of a &s;mall human &s;keleton, which were interred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, as the re|mains of tho&s;e two unhappy princes. If they were put to death at this juncture, Richard mu&s;t have acted from mere wantonne&s;s of barbarity; for his throne &s;eemed to be &s;trongly e&s;tabli&s;hed, the whole kingdom was quiet, all the parti|&s;ans of Edward's children were cru&s;hed and ruined, and the children them&s;elves declared illegitimate. Perhaps young Edward, who was of a weakly con&s;titu|tion, died of grief and terror, with which he certainly was overwhelmed from the moment of his depo&s;ition; and his brother the duke of York was con|veyed beyond &s;ea, where he lived &s;ome time in ob&s;curity, and afterwards ap|peared as a pretender to the Engli&s;h crown. Even this conjecture is attended with material objections. Had Edward died of a natural death, Richard would have found his account in publi&s;hing his fate to the world, and honouring the body with a magnificent funeral. If the duke of York had e&s;caped into Flan|ders, his aunt the dutche&s;s of Burgundy would naturally have owned him as &s;uch from the beginning, that there might be no doubt of his birth and quality in the &s;equel, when an opportunity &s;hould offer to a&s;&s;ert his preten&s;ions. After all$ when we con&s;ider the &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;ition of Richard, and the my&s;terious di&s;appearance of the two princes, we cannot pretend to acquit him of the im|putation which hath been fixed upon his memory; notwith&s;tanding all the $ains which have been taken to gild over his character, by Buck, who was in
<PB N="439" REF="4490">
all re&s;pects a mo&s;t de&s;picable hi&s;torian, and &s;eems to have commenced the pane|gyri&s;t of Richard, becau&s;e one of his ance&s;tors was engaged in the &s;ervice of that inhuman tyrant. We are told by Sir Thomas More, that although Richard expre&s;&s;ed great joy when Tyrrel gave him to under&s;tand his order was executed on the two princes, he was afterwards haunted by the furies of re|mor&s;e; that he often &s;tarted from his &s;leep in the utmo&s;t trepidation; that he frequently rolled his eyes, bit his lip, and fumbled with his dagger, exhibiting in his countenance and demeanour all the marks of terror and di&s;tru&s;t.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be owned however that the king, in his progre&s;s, admini&s;tered ju&s;tice with great impartiality; and, by an unwearied attention to the intere&s;t of his &s;ubjects, &s;eemed bent upon making an attonement for the blood through which he had waded to the throne. From Glouce&s;ter he repaired to York, where he had the &s;atisfaction of receiving Geoffry de Sa&s;iola, amba&s;&s;ador from Spain, whom Ferdinand and I&s;abella had &s;ent on purpo&s;e to renew the antient alliance between Ca&s;tile and England. He was &s;o well plea&s;ed to find him&s;elf<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> acknowledged by that prince&s;s, who was de&s;cended from the hou&s;e of Lan|ca&s;ter, that he knighted and care&s;&s;ed the amba&s;&s;ador: he wrote very affec|tionate and re&s;pectful letters to their catholic maje&s;ties, and even to their mini&s;ters. While Richard re&s;ided at York he was a &s;econd time crowned in the cathedral of that city; and his &s;on, a boy ten years of age, was created prince of Wales with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities. Here too he received the tidings of the death of Lewis XI. king of France, who was &s;ucceeded by his only &s;on Charles VIII. a minor, under the guardian&s;hip of his &s;i&s;ter Anne, wife of Pe|ter de Bourbon, lord of Beaujeu: but the duke of Orleans, as fir&s;t prince of the blood, di&s;puted the regency with her; and this conte&s;t produced &s;uch troubles in the French court as hindered the renewal or confirmation of the truce with England, which Richard eagerly &s;ollicited.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XX.</HEAD>
<P>While the king enjoyed the&s;e events at York, the duke of Bucking|ham brewed a &s;torm again&s;t him, big with danger and expectation. That no|bleman, who was naturally loud, imperious, and indi&s;creet, had not &s;pent many days at Brecknock, when his di&s;content and hatred towards Richard were perceived by his pri&s;oner, Morton bi&s;hop of Ely, a prelate of &s;ingular pene|tration and addre&s;s. He had formerly been a zealous parti&s;an of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, but yielded to the torrent at the acce&s;&s;ion of Edward, who found him u&s;eful in his affairs, and appointed him a member of his council. He &s;till retained the warme&s;t inclinations for the Lanca&s;trian intere&s;t; and perceiv|ing the re&s;entment of Buckingham, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his confidence, by reviling Richard, whom he dete&s;ted as a tyrant and a ruffian, who, not con|tented with having &s;hed the be&s;t blood of the nobility, and u&s;urped the crown, had now crowned his inhumanity with the murder of the two innocent princes. Buckingham, in the tran&s;ports of his pa&s;&s;ion, denounced vengeance again&s;t this mon&s;ter of barbarity and ingratitude; and Morton is &s;aid to have advi&s;ed him to claim the crown in his own right, as de&s;cended from Anne, daughter of Thomas de Wode&s;toke, earl of Glouce&s;ter, and third &s;on of the third Edward; but the duke fore&s;eeing that in &s;uch a ca&s;e the friends of Henry earl of Rich|mond would join the hou&s;e of York again&s;t him, declined following the bi&s;hop's advice, and declared in favour of that nobleman, who was the true heir of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. He propo&s;ed that Henry &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e Elizabeth, the
<PB N="440" REF="4500">
elde&s;t daughter of Edward IV. and by this alliance reunite the two hou&s;es in his $avour. The bi&s;hop reli&s;hed the expedient, as a &s;cheme con&s;ormable to ju&s;tice, that in all probability would effectually extingui&s;h the embers of tho&s;e civil wars by which the kingdom had been &s;o long har$a&s;&s;ed and depopulated. Henry earl of Richmond was the &s;on of a Wel&s;hman, as we have already ob|&s;erved; but his mother Margaret was daughter of John de Beaufort, duke of Somer&s;et, and grand&s;on of John of Ghent, d$ke of Lanca&s;ter. Margaret's father, dying without male $$&s;ue, his younger brother Edmund &s;ucceeded to his title; but he and all his po&s;terity being de&s;troyed in the civil war. Mar|garet and her &s;on were the only &s;urviving branches of that family, and con&s;e|quently the heirs of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. Neverthele&s;s, their title was liable to one great objection: They were de&s;cended from Catherine Rouet, who had been conc$bine to John of Ghent; and although her children were declared legitimate by act of parliament, and capable of inheriting titles and e&s;tates, they were not allowed to a&s;&s;ume the name of Plantagenet; nor did the act of their legitimation extend to their being rendered capable of &s;ucceeding to the throne: even &s;uppo&s;ing their right had extended &s;o $ar, they could have hardly pre|tended to come in competition with the de&s;cendants of the duke of Lanca&s;ter by his lawful marriage; who amounted to ten or twelve different princes and prince&s;&s;es in Spain, Portugal, and Germany. The&s;e however &s;eemed to be excluded from the crown, in the opinion of the Engli&s;h; and Richmond's right was tacitly acknowledged by the repeated efforts which Edward IV. and Richard made to &s;ecure his per&s;on. Had not the intere&s;t of this nobleman been very great, and his title e&s;pou&s;ed by all the friends of the hou&s;e of Lan|ca&s;ter, a man of Buckingham's ambition would in all probability have &s;et up for him&s;elf. At pre&s;ent he &s;eems to have been actuated intirely by a &s;pirit of revenge again&s;t Richard, though he coloured it with a more plau&s;ible pretext; for we can hardly believe that a per&s;on of his character would engage in &s;uch a dangerous &s;cheme, on a more laudable principle.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXI.</HEAD>
<P>Be that as it will, he and the bi&s;hop, after divers con&s;ultations, con|cluded that the whole hope of &s;ucce&s;s in this enterprize depended upon the marriage between Henry and Elizabeth; and that they ought to &s;ecure this alliance, as a nece&s;&s;ary preliminary to all their other mea&s;ures. For this pur|po&s;e they re&s;olved to communicate the &s;cheme to the old counte&s;s of Rich|mond, that &s;he might take the fir&s;t opportunity to make her &s;on acquainted with the de&s;ign, and endeavour to obtain the con&s;ent of the queen dowager. The bi&s;hop, being intimately acquainted with Reginald Bray, one of the dome&s;|ticks belonging to the counte&s;s, &s;ent for him to Brecknock, where he was en|t$$&s;ted with the &s;ecret, and undertook to engage his mi&s;tre&s;s in the de&s;ign. This man was no &s;ooner returned to the counte&s;s with his emba&s;&s;y, than the bi&s;hop de&s;ired the duke would permit him to retire to his dioce&s;e; but Buck|ingham excu&s;ing him&s;elf by &s;aying &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion would rou&s;e the &s;u&s;picion of Richard, the prelate found means to e&s;cape, and cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to Flanders, from whence he wrote an apology to the duke, encouraging him to proceed with his undertaking, and a&s;&s;uring him he could &s;erve the cau&s;e much more effectually on the continent than in England. Morton, knowing the duke's heat and precipitation, was afraid of being per&s;onally involved in &s;ome ra&s;h project, that might have co&s;t him his life before their de&s;ign could be brought
<PB N="441" REF="4510">
to maturity; and therefore he withdrew from his habitation. In the mean time the counte&s;s of Richmond, being informed of their plan, &s;ent back Bray to the duke to &s;ignify her approbation and gratitude; and a&s;&s;ure him that &s;he would, without lo&s;s of time, endeavour to obtain the con&s;ent of the queen dowager to the projected marriage. She did not doubt of meeting with &s;uc|ce&s;s in this negotiation, as the queen &s;till continued in the &s;anctuary at We&s;t|min&s;ter, deploring the untimely death of her two &s;ons, and pouring forth im|precations again&s;t their inhuman butcher. The counte&s;s employed her phy&s;i|cian, who&s;e name was Lewis, to vi&s;it Elizabeth in the way of his profe&s;&s;ion, and make her acquainted with the de&s;ign which was formed in behalf of her children again&s;t the inhuman u&s;urper; and &s;he received the intimation with ea|gerne&s;s and joy. She a&s;&s;ured him that all the friends of her late hu&s;band &s;hould join the earl of Richmond, but in the mean time &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon that noble|man's engaging by oath to marry her daughter Elizabeth, or her younger &s;i&s;ter Cecilia, in ca&s;e the other &s;hould die before the con&s;ummation of the marriage.</P>

<P>A good under&s;tanding being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed between the queen dowager, the counte&s;s of Richmond, and the duke of Buckingham, each in particular began to engage a number of adherents; and they &s;ucceeded even beyond expectation. Richard had by his cruelty rendered him&s;elf odious to the nation in general, and almo&s;t all the parti&s;ans of the hou&s;e of York were incen&s;ed again&s;t him on account of the murder of the two princes. All the Lanca&s;trians joyfully embraced a project that tended to re-e&s;tabli&s;h a prince of that hou&s;e on the throne of England; and moderate people, who had nothing in view but the good of their country, could not but favour a de&s;ign, the &s;uc|ce&s;s of which would put an end to tho&s;e civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions with which the realm had been &s;o long afflicted. The duke of Buckingham, as chief of the enterprize, employed his friends in Wales to enli&s;t men privately, that he might be able to a&s;&s;emble an army all at once, when it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary to declare their intention: at the &s;ame time he entered into engagements with the gentle|men of Dor&s;et&s;hire, Devon&s;hire, and Cornwall, who promi&s;ed to levy troops, and join the earl of Richmond at his landing. This was likewi&s;e his own de|&s;ign; while others of his adherents were in&s;tructed to excite in&s;urrections in different parts of the country, in order to divide Richard's forces, and di&s;tract his attention. The marq$is of Dor&s;et, who had lately quitted the &s;anctuary, his brother Sir Richard Wideville, the bi&s;hop of Exeter, his brother Sir Ed|ward Courtney, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, engaged in this a&s;&s;o|ciation. The counte&s;s of Richmond &s;ent two me&s;&s;engers to her &s;on in Britanny, by different ways, to inform him of the re&s;olution which had been taken in his favour, and the conditions on which he was invited to land in England. He then re&s;ided at Vannes, where he had been kept &s;everal years a kind of pri|&s;oner at large, in con&s;equence of the convention &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the duke and the fourth Edward.</P>

<P>The earl was not more rejoiced at the &s;teps which were taken in his favour by his friends in England, than embarra&s;&s;ed about the means of return|ing in a &s;uitable manner to his native country. He was not ignorant of the agreement between Edward IV. and the duke of Britanny, touching the con|finement of his per&s;on; and he knew that Richard had made advances to the duke on the &s;ame &s;ubject: but, as he could not pretend to take the advantage of
<PB N="442" REF="4520">
his good fortune without the concurrence of that prince, he frankly com|municated to him every circum&s;tance of the plan, and &s;ollicited his friend|&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He found the duke very very well di&s;po&s;ed to favour his e$$erprize. He had not engaged in any treaty with Richard, whom he dete&s;ted for his tyranny, and inhuman di&s;po&s;ition; and he had &s;ome preten&s;ions to the earldom of Richmond in England, which his ance&s;tors had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which he did not de&s;pair of retrieving, provided the earl &s;hould by his means a&s;cend the throne of England. This is &s;aid to have been the principal article of their agreement, in con&s;ideration of which the duke engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holli$g&s;hed.</NOTE> him with troops and ve&s;&s;els. Henry having &s;ecured this point with the duke of Brittany, di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger with letters to his mother, and the duke of Buckingham, informing them o$ the progre&s;s he had made, and de&s;iring they would be ready to receive him in the beginning of October. By the&s;e tidings all the con&s;pirators were put in motion; and each individual repaired to the po&s;t a&s;&s;igned to him, in order to levy troops, or excite in&s;urrections.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all their precautions, the&s;e &s;teps could not be taken with &s;uch &s;ecrecy as to elude the vigilance of Richard, who di&s;covered that &s;ome plot was $ormed again&s;t him, tho' he was &s;till ignorant of the quar|ter from which the &s;torm impended. He forthwith advanced from York to|wards the centre of his kingdom; and i&s;&s;ued orders into different parts, di|recting the troops to be in readine&s;s to march at the fir&s;t notice. His reflexion $oon pointed out to him the duke of Buckingham as the author of tho&s;e com|motions, as he had retired from court in di&s;gu&s;t; was the only nobleman in England, who by his genius, wealth, and influence, could form and execute any &s;cheme of &s;uch importance; and the e&s;cape of the bi&s;hop of Ely bore all the marks of the duke's connivance. Alarmed by the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, he &s;ent for the duke to court, that he might con&s;ult him on &s;ome affairs of con&s;equence; and Buckingham excu&s;ed him&s;elf, on pretence of indi&s;po&s;ition. The king be|ing more and more confirmed in his conjectures, by this eva&s;ion, in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing him, by a peremptory order that would admit of no apology; and to this the duke an&s;wered, that he did not choo&s;e to tru&s;t his per&s;on with his mo&s;t inverterate enemy, on whom he neither could, nor would, for the future, place the &s;malle&s;t dependence. After this declaration, he knew there was no medium to be ob&s;erved. He immediately a&s;&s;embled his troops, and began his march towards the we&s;tern provinces, where the earl of Richmond intended to land, and where he expected to be joined by the re&s;t of the confederacy.</P>

<P>Tho' Richard was not a little &s;urprized to find the duke &s;o well prepared, he had taken &s;uch precautions as enabled him to bring an army into the field without delay; and he appointed the rendezvous at Leice&s;ter, re&s;olving to go in que&s;t of the enemy, and engage him before he &s;hould be reinforced. He would have found it difficult$ however, to prevent the junction of the con|federates, had they not been kept a&s;under by an unfore&s;een accident. The duke of $$ck$ngham advanced by long marches to the &s;ide of the Severne, in his way to $oin his friends in the counties of Devon and Dor&s;et; but, the river had overflowed its banks in &s;uch an extraordinary manner, as to deluge the whole adjacent country; &s;o that $or &s;ix days, he could neither pa&s;s the &s;tream, nor find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the place where he encamped. His Wel&s;h followers, di&s;pirited by the want of provi&s;ion, the exce&s;&s;ive rains, the intolerable fatigues to which they
<PB N="443" REF="4530">
were expo&s;ed, as well as by the inundation, which they looked upon as an unfa|vourable omen, retired to their mountains, in &s;pite of all his remon&s;trances and intreatries; and the de&s;ertion was &s;o general, that he was left with one dome|&s;tic only. In this forlorn &s;ituation, he &s;aw no other re&s;ource than that of con|cealing him&s;elf, until he &s;hould be able to take other mea&s;ures. He therefore re|tired to the hou&s;e of one Bani&s;ter, who had lived in his &s;ervice, and owed his all to the bounty of the duke and his father. Richard was no &s;ooner informed of the di&s;per&s;ion of his enemies, than he publi&s;hed a proclamation, &s;etting the price of a thou&s;and pounds on the head of the duke of Buckingham; and Bani&s;ter was &s;uch an ungrateful wretch, as to betray his ma&s;ter and benefactor for the $ake of this reward. He di&s;covered him to the &s;heriff of Shrop&s;hire, who with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

He was conveyed to Shrew&s;bury, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired he might be admitted into the king's pre&s;ence; but, this was a favour he could not obtain: and he was immediately beheaded by Richard's order, without any form of proce&s;s. His friends, who waited for his cro&s;&s;ing the Severne, being informed of the d$&s;ertion of his Wel&s;h troops, di&s;per&s;ed immediately. Some concealed them&s;elves in the hou&s;es of their relations; others fled to &s;anctuaries; but, the greater part embarked for Brittany, and the marquis of Dor&s;et was of that number.</P>

<P>While the duke of Buckingham thus ha&s;ted to de&s;truction, Henry earl of Richmond, &s;uppo&s;ing that his affairs in England were &s;till in a pro&s;perous train, &s;et $ail from St. Malo, in the latter end of October, with five thou&s;and men, embarked in forty ve&s;&s;els, an armament with which he had been &s;upplied by the duke of Brittany; but, his fleet was di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, which forced part of his &s;hips on the coa&s;t of France, while the re&s;t were driven back to the place from whence they had taken their departure. The &s;hip in which the earl him|&s;elf embarked, having weathered the &s;torm, arrived at Pool in Dor&s;et&s;hire, where finding the &s;hore crouded with armed men, he would not land, but &s;ent &s;ome per&s;ons a&s;hore in the boat, to learn whether they were friends or enemies. The commander of the Engli&s;h troops told them, he belonged to the duke of Buckingham, who had &s;ent him to that place to receive the earl of Richmond. But, whether Henry di&s;covered them to be the militia of the country, a&s;&s;em|bled by Richard's officers, or was determined again&s;t landing without the forces which had embarked in the expedition, he continued &s;ome days hovering on the coa&s;t, in hope of being joined by his $leet; and, as none of his ve&s;&s;els appeared, he &s;ailed back to Normandy, where he was informed of Buckingham's di&s;a&s;ter. Then he returned to Brittany, where he found the marquis of Dor&s;et, and the other refugees, who in &s;ome mea&s;ure con&s;oled him for his mi&s;carriage, by a&s;&s;ur|ing him, that Richard was univer&s;ally hated by his &s;ubjects; and that they would ri&s;e again&s;t him with the very fir&s;t opportunity. Henry conceived a good omen from this information; and the duke of Brittany promi&s;ing to con|tinue his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he re&s;olved to make another attempt with all convenient ex|pedition. In the mean time, he &s;olemnly &s;wore, on Chri&s;tmas day, in the ca|thedral of Rennes, that he would marry the prince&s;s Elizabeth; or, in ca&s;e of her death, her younger &s;i&s;ter Cecilia; and he no &s;ooner took the oath, than all the Engli&s;h who were pre&s;ent, &s;wore allegiance to him as king of England.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Brittany, Richard &s;acrificed a great number of victims to his vengeance; and among the $e&s;t, Sir Thomas St. Leger, who had married his own &s;i&s;ter Anne, widow of the duke of Exeter. In or|der to di&s;patch the&s;e executions, and avoid the tedious formalities of the law, he granted to Sir Ralph A&s;hton a commi&s;&s;ion, to exerc$&s;e the office of vice|con&s;table, with the &s;ame murdering power which had been formerly ve&s;ted in Tyrrel; and this officer making a progre&s;s into the we&s;tern counties, filled<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> them with blood&s;hed and lamentation. All oppo&s;ition being thus quelled, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1484.</NOTE> king called a parliament, which met in the month of January; and, as none of the members dur&s;t contradict his will, an act was pa&s;&s;ed, declaring Edward's children ba&s;tards, and confirming the pretended right and irregular election of Richard. They likewi&s;e brought a bill of attainder again&s;t Henry earl of Richmond, and all his adherents, comprehending all tho&s;e who were concerned in the duke of Buckingham's con&s;piracy, except the counte&s;s of Richmond, again&s;t whom no information had been pre&s;ented. Richard, however, de&s;ired her hu&s;band lord Stanley to keep a watchful eye over her conduct; and, in order to attach that nobleman &s;till more firmly to his intere&s;t, he created him lord high con&s;table of England, with authority over A&s;hton, who had by this time performed the &s;ervice for which he was appointed.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>When Richard thought he had, by the&s;e executions, intirely ex|tingui&s;hed the con&s;piracy; Thomas Ha$ton, whom he had &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to the court o$ Brittany, on his return to England, gave him to under&s;tand that the de&s;ign of the inva&s;ion &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted: that the duke had promi&s;ed to continue his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the earl of Richmond: and, that Henry and the Engli&s;h refugees held frequent conferences, to concert mea&s;ures for the execution of their project. Richard, tho' he believed him&s;elf &s;o much ma&s;ter in England, that no per&s;on would pre&s;ume to take arms again&s;t his government, re&s;olved to render him|&s;elf &s;till more &s;ecure by foreign alliances. He had already renewed the treaties with Spain and Portugal, and he now &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the archduke Maxi|milian, governor of the Low Countries for his &s;on Philip, who, by his mo|ther, was, like the princes of Ca&s;tile and Portugal, de&s;cended from the hou&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of Lanca&s;ter. The pretence of this emba&s;&s;y was to renew the commercial truce between Flanders and England; but, the amba&s;&s;adors had in&s;tructions to en|quire whether or not that court entertained any de&s;ign upon the crown of Eng|land, or had engaged in alliance with the pretender: at the &s;ame time, the king of England &s;ent envoys to the court of France, to confirm and prolong the truce with that kingdom. As he knew the duke of Brittany was embarked in the intere&s;ts of the earl of Richmond, he determined to exert his utmo&s;t en|deavours, to detach him from the cau&s;e of that nobleman; and an accident pre&s;ented him with a very favourable opportunity. The duke being old and infirm, was intirely directed by his trea&s;urer Peter Landais, the &s;on of a taylor, who u&s;ed his credit with &s;uch in&s;olence, as intailed upon him the hatred of all the Bretons. In the cour&s;e of this very year, the nobility had entered into an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t him, and even attempted to &s;eize his per&s;on in the duke's palace; but, their &s;cheme mi&s;carried, and they were declared rebels and trai|to$s by means of the incen&s;ed favourite. Landais knowing he was the object of univer&s;al hate in his own country, thought it would be nece&s;&s;ary to fortify
<PB N="445" REF="4550">
him&s;elf with &s;ome foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tances; and with this view &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Richard, who gladly li&s;tened to his propo&s;als. A truce was concluded between England and Britanny; but by another private treaty, the king engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the duke with a thou&s;and archers for the defence of his mini&s;ter, who, in all probability undertook to deliver the earl of Richmond into the hands of Richard: at lea&s;t he promi&s;ed that Henry &s;hould have no further a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the duke his ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>This affair being &s;ettled to the king's &s;atisfaction, he turned his attention to James IV. of Scotland, whom, as a de&s;cendant of the hou&s;e of So|mer&s;et, he imagined a favourer of Richmond. With this prince he negotiated a truce for one year, and &s;ettled the contract of marriage between his niece Anne, daughter of the duke of Suffolk, and the duke of Roth&s;ay, elde&s;t &s;on of the Scotti&s;h monarch. Richard's &s;on, the prince of Wales, dying about<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer$</NOTE> this period, he declared the young lady's brother, the earl of Lincoln, pre|&s;umptive heir of the crown, and re&s;olved that his declaration &s;hould be ratified by parliament. Over and above the&s;e precautions, he &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y of obedience to pope Innocent VIII. who had ju&s;t &s;ucceeded Sixtus IV. in the pontifical chair; and, in a little time after he had taken the&s;e &s;alutary mea&s;ures, Charles VIII. king of France, de&s;ired a &s;afe-conduct for the amba&s;&s;adors he intended for the court of London.</P>

<P>As Peter Landais, mini&s;ter of the duke of Bretagne, had no oc|ca&s;ion for the archers which had been &s;tipulated in the treaty, Richard perceiv|ed that he had nothing to expect from that quarter, unle&s;s he could indulge him with other advantages. He therefore, on pretence of prolonging the truce, entered into a new negotiation with the duke and his favourite, and is &s;aid to have offered very valuable rewards for the per&s;on of Henry; during who&s;e life he could enjoy no internal quiet. The duke, by this time, was quite &s;uper|annuated, and his intellects greatly impaired; &s;o that in effect Landais acted as &s;overeign of Britanny; and to him Richard's chief attention was directed. The king of England is &s;aid to have granted letters patent, re&s;toring to Francis II. duke of Bretagne, the earldom of Richmond and all its dependances: but with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentre.</NOTE> re&s;pect to Landais, the nature of the gratification which he expected is not &s;o perfectly known. Certain it is, Richard was very liberal in his promi&s;es, but the other in&s;i&s;ted upon having &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial; and, before the treaty was fini&s;hed, the earl of Richmond was informed of the negotiation by Morton bi&s;hop of Ely, who, having &s;pies in the court of England, under&s;tood that the king often conferred in private with the bi&s;hop of Leon, amba&s;&s;ador from the duke of Bretagne. Henry, alarmed at this intelligence, re&s;olved to retire into France, and for that purpo&s;e &s;ecretly obtained a pa&s;&s;port from king Charles; but, as he naturally &s;uppo&s;ed that Landais had employed emi&s;&s;aries to watch his motions, he found him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed about the means of accom|pli&s;hing his e&s;cape. The duke of Bretagne had ju&s;t recovered of a lethargy, during which his mini&s;ter had negotiated with Richard; and the earl of Rich|mond &s;ent all his Engli&s;h friends and followers to congratulate that prince, in his name, on the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his health, ju&s;tly concluding that they would not &s;u&s;pect him of any de&s;ign to retire while &s;uch a number of ho&s;tages remained at the court of Britanny. The &s;cheme &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h: being left almo&s;t alone at Vannes, he found an opportunity to withdraw in di&s;gui&s;e,
<PB N="446" REF="4560">
accompanied by five per&s;ons; he immediately quitted the high road, and rode acro&s;s the country through lanes and unfrequented paths, without halting, until he arrived at Angers, the capital of Anjou. Without &s;uch diligence he mu&s;t have certainly been taken; for his e&s;cape from Vannes was no &s;ooner known, than tho&s;e who were employed to watch his conduct pur&s;ued him with &s;uch &s;peed, that they arrived upon the frontiers in le&s;s than one hour after he had pa$&s;ed the confines of Britanny. The duke, under&s;tanding that he had retired from apprehen&s;ion of being betrayed by Landais, was incen&s;ed again&s;t his fa|vourite, and allowed all the Engli&s;h in his dominions to join the earl, to whom he &s;ent his compliments and proffers of &s;ervice. From Angers Henry repaired to Langeais, where he met with an ho&s;pitable reception at the court of Charles, though it was &s;till di&s;tracted by different factions; and here he was joined by the earl of Oxford, who had been impri&s;oned by order of Edward IV. in the ca&s;tle of Ha$mes in Picardy. Hearing in his confinement that the earl of Richmond laid claim to the crown of England, he had prevailed upon the go|vernor of that fortre&s;s to declare for Henry, and now they went together to vi&s;it him at the court of France. The earl of Oxford was a con&s;iderable acce&s;|&s;ion to his party; and &s;everal other noblemen in England &s;ent him &s;ecret a&s;&s;uran|ces that he might depend upon their &s;ervice whenever they &s;hould find a proper opportunity to declare again&s;t Richard: among the&s;e was the lord Stanley, who had married the earl's mother; and on that account was &s;o much &s;u&s;pected by the king, that he could not obtain leave to retire to his hou&s;e in the country, until he had left his &s;on at court as an ho&s;tage.</P>

<P>Richard was at &s;uch pains to learn the nature of the plan which his enemies projected again&s;t him, that he at la&s;t di&s;covered the mo&s;t material circum&s;tance, which was the union of the queen's friends with the parti&s;ans of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, by means of Henry's marriage with Elizabeth. Rou|&s;ed at this intelligence he re&s;olved to prevent a match which could not fail to &s;hake the foundations of his government; and he &s;aw no method &s;o effectual as that of making Elizabeth his own confort. This would have appeared an impracticable expedient to any other per&s;on but Richard, as it was attended with three ob&s;tacles &s;eemingly un&s;urmountable, before &s;uch a marriage could take effect: there was a nece&s;&s;ity for removing his pre&s;ent wife; for obtaining the con&s;ent of the queen dowager, who&s;e brothers and &s;ons he had butchered; and for prevailing upon the pope to grant a di&s;pen&s;ation for an ince&s;tuous mar|riage between an uncle and a niece. He began the execution of this &s;trange project by &s;ending &s;everal civil me&s;&s;ages to the queen dowager, importing that he wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to live in a good under&s;tanding with her, that he might have an opportunity to give her convincing proofs of his friend|&s;hip. He owned &s;he had met with cruel treatment, in order to attone for which he promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; to be&s;tow profitable employments on her two brothers, and to procure advantageous matches for her daughters. As he knew the&s;e advances would appear &s;u&s;picious to the queen, he in&s;tructed his emi&s;&s;aries to a&s;cribe them to the dictates of his con&s;cience, which was di&s;turbed by the remembrance of the wrongs he had done her family. They declared that his intention was to rai&s;e the pri$ce&s;s Elizabeth to the throne, as death had deprived him of his own &s;on; and that he would revoke the declaration he had made in favour of the earl of Lincoln. The
<PB N="447" REF="4570">
other part of his promi&s;e, touching the &s;afety of the queen and her family, as well as the intended provi&s;ion, he confirmed by a &s;olemn oath, taken at an a&s;&s;embly of the lords &s;piritual and temporal.</P>

<P>The&s;e promi&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions made an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the queen, who was heartily tired with being cooped up in a fanctuary, very ill provided with the nece&s;&s;aries of life; who loved her brothers with the warm$&s;t affection, and who reflected that &s;he and her daughters had nothing to expect but mi&s;chief and de&s;truction, &s;hould &s;he irritate the king by rejecting his offers. Swayed by the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;he not only went to court with her five daugh|ters, where they met with a mo&s;t gracious reception, but al&s;o wrote to her brother, the marquis o$ Dor&s;et, to abandon the earl of Richmond, and return to Eng|land, where he might depend upon Richard's genero&s;ity. The marquis, equally weak and ambitious, was &s;o agreeably flattered with this pro&s;pect of the king's favour, that he withdrew privately from Paris, with de&s;ign to return to England; but he was pur&s;ued and brought back by the adherents of Henry, who per&s;uaded him to &s;tay and &s;hare his fortune. Richard, having thus ac|compli&s;hed the mo&s;t difficult part of his plan, began to contrive means for removing his wife, that he might be at liberty to e&s;pou&s;e his niece Elizabeth; and whatever expedient he u&s;ed, certain it is, &s;he did not long &s;urvive her &s;on the prince of Wales: if we may believe Buck, &s;he died of grie$ at the lo&s;s of that young prince; but all the other hi&s;torians alledge, that Richard killed her either with unkindne&s;s or poi&s;on; and thus &s;he &s;uffered the puni&s;hment which &s;he in &s;ome mea&s;ure de&s;erved, for having thrown her&s;elf into the arms of the barbarian who had murdered her fir&s;t hu&s;band the prince of Wales, &s;on of Henry VI. at Tewke&s;bury.</P>

She received his addre&s;&s;es with horror, and begged he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hall.

<P>The earl of Richmond, eager to &s;eize this opportunity, &s;ollicited the French mini&s;try for &s;uccours with &s;uch importunity, that they re&s;olved to grant his reque&s;t; not that they imagined his enterprize would be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, but they thought it was the intere&s;t of France to foment the di$|&s;en&s;ions of England. They therefore engaged to &s;upply him with two thou|&s;and men, and ve&s;&s;els for tran&s;porting them to England, and even furni&s;hed

him with a &s;um of money; tho' they in&s;i&s;ted upon his leaving ho&s;tages in<NOTE PLACE="marg">P$il. de Co|mines.</NOTE> France, as a &s;ecurity for refunding the charges of this expedition. The earl, who had no great confidence in the marquis of Dor&s;et, was glad of this occa|&s;ion to leave him at Paris, while he him&s;elf repaired to Rouen, where the troops were ordered to a&s;&s;emble. There he received the di&s;agreeable news of the queen's death, and under&s;tood that Richard intended to marry his niece Eli|zabeth, and be&s;tow her &s;i&s;ter Cecilia on one of his favourites. He forthwith called a council of his friends, to deliberate on the&s;e unfavourable tidings; and they advi&s;ed him to marry the &s;i&s;ter of Sir Thomas Herbert, a very powerful knight in Wales, who&s;e intere&s;t would be a great acqui&s;ition. Henry reli&s;hed the advice, and di&s;patched a member to Herbert with his propo&s;al; but the pa&s;&s;es were &s;o guarded, that he could not execute his commi&s;&s;ion; and this was a very lucky di&s;appointment for the earl of Richmond, who, if the alliance had taken place, would in all probability have lo&s;t the intere&s;t of Edward's family, and their adherents, who engaged in his cau&s;e meerly from the hope that he would unite the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter by his marriage with the prince&s;s Elizabeth. Henry, in a few days after his arrival at Rouen, received letters from England, inviting him to land in Wales, where he would find the people ready to take arms in his favour, together with a large &s;um of money which had been collected for his &s;ervice. He was likewi&s;e given to under&s;tand, that the whole kingdom was di&s;contented at the conduct and character of Ri|chard; and that there could not be a more favourable juncture for Henry's landing, as the tyrant had made no preparations $or oppo&s;ing his de&s;cent.</P>

<P>Encouraged by this information the earl ha&s;tened his departure, and embarking with his troops at Harfleur on the la&s;t day of July, arrived on the &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t in Milford haven in Wales. Next day he advanced to Haverford, where he was received amid&s;t the acclamations of the inhabitants: from hence he di&s;patched an expre&s;s to his mother, with an account of his ar|rival, and intended march to London; then he &s;ent intimation to his friends to join him upon his route, and &s;et out for Shrew&s;bury, where he purpo&s;ed to pa&s;s the Severne. Richard, being informed of his landing, o$dered Sir Thomas Herbert to a&s;&s;emble the militia of Wales, and &s;top the earl's progre&s;s until he &s;hould be in a condition to march again&s;t him; but Herbert having been already gained over by Henry's friends, allowed him to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted. He was joined on his route by Sir Rees ap Thomas, the mo&s;t powerful commoner in Wales, and a great number of gentlemen of that country; &s;o that his army daily increa&s;ed, and in a few day as he arrived at Shrew&s;bury, which he entered without oppo&s;ition. Mean while a body of five thou&s;and men was rai&s;ed by the lord Stanley and his brother Sir William, on pretence of &s;erving Richard; and they advanced to Litchfield, as if their de&s;ign was to oppo&s;e the invader: but Sir William had a private interview with Henry, whom he a&s;&s;ured of his bro|ther's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as &s;oon as he could declare him&s;elf with any &s;a$ety to his &s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holling&s;hed.</NOTE> the lord Strange, who was detained as an ho&s;tage by the tyrant.</P>

<P>Richard had by this time a&s;&s;embled his forces at Nottingham. Hearing that the earl's de&s;ign was to march to London, he re&s;olved to give him battle on his rou$e; and with that view en$$mped between Leice&s;ter and Coventry. Henry, in the mean time $dvan$ed to Litchfield$ from whe$ce the lord Stanley re$ired at his approach, and took po&s;t at Ather$one$ and the earl
<PB N="449" REF="4590">
having taken his mea&s;ures with the two brothers, continued his march to Lei|ce&s;ter, where he propo&s;ed to venture a deci&s;ive engagement. In the neigh|bourhood of Tamworth he dropped behind his army, and in a fit of mu&s;ing lo&s;t his way; &s;o that he was obliged to lie all night at a village, without daring to a&s;k the road, for fear of being &s;u&s;pected and falling into the hands of his enemies. Next morning he made &s;hift to rejoin his army at Tamworth, where, finding his friends had been greatly alarmed at his ab&s;ence, he told them he had gone to confer with &s;ome particular noblemen, who did not chu&s;e to appear as yet in his behalf. That &s;ame day he privately vi&s;ited the lord Stanley at Ather|&s;tone; and on the morrow, being informed that Richard had marched from Leice&s;ter to give him battle, he re&s;olved to &s;pare him one half of the way. On the twenty-&s;econd day of Augu&s;t, the two armies came in &s;ight of each other, at Bo&s;worth, which is rendered famous in hi&s;tory by the battle which ter|minated the di&s;pute between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter. Richard's arm$ con&s;i&s;ted of twelve thou&s;and men well accoutred. The command of the van he conferred on the duke of Norfolk; and he him&s;elf took po&s;t in the centre$ with the crown upon his head, either as a mark of di&s;tinction, or a challenge to his adver&s;ary. The earl of Richmond drew up his troops, amounting to five thou&s;and men ill armed, in two lines; the command of the fir&s;t he gave to the earl of Oxford, while he him&s;elf conducted the other. Lord Stanley, who quitted Ather&s;tone, took po&s;t in a piece of ground fronting the interval be|tween the two armies; and his brother, at the head of two thou&s;and men, &s;tood facing him on the other &s;ide. Richard, &s;u&s;pecting Stanley's de&s;ign, or|dered<NOTE PLACE="marg">More.</NOTE> him to join his army, and receiving an equivocal an&s;wer, would have put his &s;on to death, had not he been diverted from his purpo&s;e by the remon|&s;trances of his generals, who ob&s;erved that &s;uch a &s;acrifice could be of no ad|vantage to the royal cau&s;e, but would infallibly provoke Stanley and his brother to join the foe; though perhaps their intention was to remain neuter, and de|clare for the victor. Richard was per&s;uaded by this repre&s;entation: but he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buck.</NOTE> committed a fatal error in leaving the two brothers at liberty to act as they &s;hould think proper. His army being equal in number to that of Richmond and the Stanleys, when joined together, he ought to have po&s;ted two bodies oppo&s;ite to the brothers, with order to attack them if they &s;hould attempt to join the enemy, while he him&s;elf with the remainder might have given battle to Henry.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The two leaders having harrangued their &s;oldiers, the earl of Richmond made a motion to the left, in order to avoid a mora&s;s that divided the two armies; and, by this prudent mea&s;ure, not only &s;ecured his right flank, but gained another advantage, in having the &s;un at his back, while it &s;hone full in the face of the enemy. Richard, &s;eeing him approach, commanded the trumpets to &s;ound; and the battle began with a general di&s;charge of arrows, after which the king's army advanced to clo&s;e combat. The lord Stanley, per|ceiving that the duke of Norfolk extended his line to the left, in order to &s;ur|round the enemy, &s;uddenly joined the earl of Richmond's right wing$ in order to &s;u&s;tain the attack; and Norfolk, &s;eeing this junction, made a halt to clo&s;e his files, which had been too much opened for the exten&s;ion of the line. The match being now pretty equal, the fight was renewed, though not with equal ardour on both &s;ides. The king's troops &s;eemed to act with reluctance,
<PB N="450" REF="4600">
and were, in all probability, di&s;pirited by the conduct of the two Stanleys, not knowing but their example might be followed by others in the heat of the engagement: on the other hand, the earl of Oxford charged them with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, as contributed to damp their courage, and fill their hearts with de&s;|po$dence. Richard, in order to animate them with his pre&s;ence and example, advanced to the front of the battle: there perceiving his competitor, who had quitted the &s;econd line for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, he couched his lance, and, clap|ping &s;purs to his hor&s;e, ran again&s;t him with &s;uch fury, that he killed his &s;tan|dard-bearer Sir William Brandon, father of Charles Brandon afterwards duke of Suffolk, and unhor&s;ed Sir John Cheyney, an officer remarkable for his &s;trength and prowe&s;s. Henry, though he did not &s;eem very eager to engage &s;uch an $ntagoni&s;t, advanced to meet him, and kept him at his &s;word's point, until they were parted by the &s;oldiers, who interpo&s;ed. While Richard made this furious effort again&s;t the per&s;on of his adver&s;ary, Sir William Stanley de|clared for Richmond, and attacking the royali&s;ts in flank, drove their right wing upon the centre, which was &s;o di&s;ordered by the &s;hock, that it began to fly with the utmo&s;t precipitation; while the earl of Northumberland, who commanded a &s;eparate body, &s;tood motionle&s;s, and refu&s;ed to act again&s;t the enemy. The king, &s;eeing all his endeavours ineffectual to rally his troops, which were by this time in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and either &s;corning to out|live the di&s;grace of an overthrow, or dreading the thought of falling alive into the hands of his enemy, ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the battle, where he fought with the mo&s;t de&s;perate courage, until he was overpowered by numbers, and fell dead in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e whom he had &s;lain. Though the battle la&s;ted about two hours, including the time &s;pent in the pur&s;uit, there was not above one thou&s;and of the royali&s;ts killed on the occa&s;ion, becau&s;e the greater part $$ed betimes without fighting; and the earl did not lo&s;e above an hundred men, of whom Sir William Brandon was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.

We mu&s;t acknowledge, however, that, after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, his admini&s;tration in general was con|ducted by the rules of ju&s;tice; that he enacted &s;alutary laws, and e&s;tabli&s;hed wi&s;e regulations; and that, if his reign had been protracted, he might have proved an excellent king to the Engli&s;h nation. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon &s;olidity of judgment, a natural fund of eloquence, the mo&s;t acute penetration, and &s;uch courage as no danger could di&s;may. He was dark, &s;ilent, and re|&s;erved, and &s;o much ma&s;ter of di&s;&s;imulation, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to dive into his real &s;entiments, when he wanted to conceal his de&s;igns. His &s;ta|ture was &s;mall, his a&s;pect cloudy, &s;evere, and forbidding; one of his arms was withered, and one &s;houlder higher than the other, from which circum&s;tances of deformity he acquired the epithet of Crook-Back. Richard III. was the la&s;t of the Anjevin race &s;urnamed Plantagenet, which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the crown of England for the &s;pace of three hundred and thirty years: but he was not the la&s;t male of that family in England; for the earl of Warwick, &s;on to his bro|ther Clarence, was &s;till alive, and the only remaining branch of all the nume|rous po&s;terity of the third Edward, which had been almo&s;t totally extingui&s;hed in the civil war; a war which had raged for thirty years, and was terminated by the battle of Bo&s;worth, after having co&s;t the lives of above one hundred thou|&s;and Engli&s;hmen, including a great number of princes of the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter.</P>

In the cour&s;e of this year, one Thorp an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, was committed to pri&s;on by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, for certain articles of faith, which were deemed $eretical.

He believed him&s;elf in&s;pired by the &s;ame &s;pirit which directed the apo&s;tles; and publi&s;hed a performance called Thorp's T$&s;tament, in which he inveighed again&s;t the hierarchy, affirming, that bi$$ops and prie$$s ought to earn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by the work of their hands, $nd when pa&s;t their labour, &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon charity.

The&s;e &s;everities, however, could not hinder Lollardi&s;m from gaining ground in the univer&s;ity, which the archbi&s;hop vi&s;ited with great pomp, accompanied by his nephew the earl of Arundel: he was met at $ome di&s;tance from the city by the members of the colleges, headed by Richard Courtney the chancellor, who told the metropolitan, that they &s;hould be proud to entertain his grace, who, he hoped, had no other de&s;ign than to &s;ee the uni|ver&s;ity, as they enjoyed an immunity by a papal b$ll from all archiepi&s;copal vi$itation.

<P>When Henry V. &s;ucceeded to the throne, the Lollards expected more indulgence, as this prince &s;eemed to be a latitudinarian in his religious prin|ciples, and was particularly connected by the ties of friend&s;hip with Sir John Oldca&s;tle, who was their great patron. They were mi&s;erably di&s;appointed in this hope; for, Henry V. was not only bigotted to the religion in which he had been educated, but re&s;olved to live upon good terms with the clergy, who&s;e a$$i&s;tance he fore&s;aw would be nece&s;&s;ary towards the execution of the great &s;cheme he had projected again&s;t France. Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he left them in the full enjoyment of their juri&s;diction; and one of the fir&s;t per|&s;ons again&s;t whom they exerted their authority, was Sir John Oldca&s;tle, who e&s;pou&s;ed the opinions of Wickliff, which we have already explained. He was &s;ummoned to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court by repeated citations, to which he paid no regard: then he was apprehended, and brought before the archbi&s;hop, who declared him&s;elf ready to ab&s;olve him, if he would recant his errors, and move for ab&s;olution. In an&s;wer to this in&s;inuation, Sir John pulled a paper from his bo&s;om, and delivered it to the prelate, who having peru&s;ed the contents, &s;aid his principles were good in the main; but there was a nece&s;&s;ity for his explain|ing him&s;elf further on tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and auricular confe&s;&s;ion. The knight<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1413.</NOTE> refu&s;ing to make any other declaration on the&s;e points, but what was contained in the written paper, was committed to the Tower, and next day received &s;ome queries from the archbi&s;hop, touching his opinion of the bread and wine in the &s;acrament of the altar, auricular confe&s;&s;ion, the power of the pope, pil|grimage, and the wor&s;hip of relics and images; he was de&s;ired to con&s;ider the&s;e articles, and prepare his an&s;wers by the twenty-&s;eventh day of September, when the convocation would &s;it at Black-Friars. Being brought into this a&s;&s;embly by Sir Robert Morley lieutenant of the Tower, he behaved with all the indi&s;cretion of an hot-headed enthu&s;ia&s;t. When the archbi&s;hop admoni&s;hed him to crave the benediction of the court, he an&s;wered, Maledicam benedictionibus ve&s;tris, Cur&s;e on your benedictions. Even after this indecent reply, the archbi&s;hop told him, that if he would de&s;ire ab&s;olution in the common form, he &s;hould have it without he&s;itation. To this intimation he an&s;wered, that he would
<PB N="460" REF="4700">
demand no ab&s;olution where he had given no offence. So &s;aying, he fell upon his knees, and in an enthu&s;ia&s;tic rhap&s;ody, con$e&s;&s;ed all his &s;ins to God, in the hearing of the whole a&s;&s;embly. Being que&s;tioned concerning the euchari&s;t, he profe&s;&s;ed his belief, that, after con&s;ecration, Chri&s;t's very body was pre&s;ent in $orm of bread, the &s;ame individual body that was born of the Virgin Mary. Then he was a&s;ked, whether or not it was the material bread after con&s;ecration; and turning to the archbi&s;hop, "I believe &s;aid he$ it is Chri&s;t's body in form of bread. Sir, believe you not this?" "Yes, marry, do I!" replied the archbi&s;hop. The doctors then interpo&s;ing, de&s;ired to know if he thought any part of the bread remained after con&s;ecration; and, he replied, it is both Chri&s;t's body and bread. This was the rock upon which he &s;p$it; for, notwith&s;tand|i$g his explanation, &s;upported by texts of &s;cripture, they declared the opinion h$retical; and, when he challenged them to prove it here&s;y, they appealed to the determination of holy-church. Sir John being warmed in his own defence, treated the doctors with contempt; and would not even allow the church to be holy, &s;ince &s;he had been infected with the poi&s;on of wordly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Doctor Walden, a noted theologi&s;t of tho&s;e times, undertook to confute Old|ca&s;tle by argument, and the di&s;pute was inflamed to the mo&s;t bitter altercation; but very little to the purpo&s;e was &s;aid on either &s;ide: Sir John compared them to Annas and Ca$phas, who &s;ate in judgment upon Chri&s;t, and afterwards on his apo&s;tles. <Q>&startq;The bi&s;hops of Rome (&s;aid he) were formerly pious martyrs; but, &s;ince they were infected with the poi&s;on of worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they have depo&s;ed, poi&s;oned, cur&s;ed and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated one another: they have filled the whole earth with cruelty and mi&s;chief. Chri&s;t was meek and merciful: the pope is proud and tyrranous. Chri&s;t was poor and compa&s;&s;ionate: the pope is rich, arrogant, and a barbarous man&s;layer. Rome is the very ne&s;t of An|tichri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> from whence come all his di&s;ciples: prelates, prie&s;ts, and monks, are the body, and their &s;haven friars the tail, which covereth his mo&s;t filthy part.&endq;</Q> Such obloquy could not fail to exa&s;perate the a&s;&s;embly, which being $$animous in finding him guilty, the archbi&s;hop pronounced the &s;entence of condemnation; and, tho' he made his e&s;cape from the Tower, he was after|wards apprehended, and &s;uffered death both as a traitor and heretic, by being hanged and burned at Tyburn.</P>

<P>Upon the death of Alexander V. Baltha&s;ar Co&s;&s;a was cho&s;en his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, under the name of John XXIII. and convoked a general council at Con|&s;tance, with the con&s;ent of the emperor Sigi&s;mund; who&s;e aim was not only to aboli&s;h the &s;chi&s;m which &s;till continued in the church, but al&s;o to root out the here&s;y of Wickliff, which had by this time made great progre&s;s in Bohe|mia, by the teaching and preaching of John Hu&s;s, and Jerome of Prague.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> When the council met on the &s;ixteenth day of November, the officers and &s;er|vants of the a&s;&s;embly were equally elected out of the five nations of which it was compo&s;ed, namely, Engli&s;h, Italians, French, Spaniards, and Germans. They agreed to range the fathers of the council under the&s;e five nations; and that the plurality of voices &s;hould determine all matters propo&s;ed. On the twenty-eig$th day of November, John Hu&s;s arrived at Con&s;tance; and, tho' h$ pleaded the &s;a$e-conduct of the emperor, was arre&s;ted by order of the pope, who told him, he had never granted a &s;afe-conduct, and was not bound by that $f the emperor. On the twenty-third day of December, the emperor appeared
<PB N="461" REF="4710">
in council, which proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s; and after much debate, it was found ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace and union in the church, that not only the antipopes, Gregory and Benedict, &s;hould be dive&s;ted of all authority, but even John XXIII. &s;hould abdicate his papal dignity. This la&s;t, con&s;cious of many enormities in his own conduct, for which he dreaded pro&s;ecution, &s;eemingly agreed to the propo&s;al. The emperor was &s;o plea&s;ed with his compliance, that he took off his crown, and ki&s;&s;ed the pope's feet; and all the members of the council promi&s;ed to &s;upport him again&s;t his two rivals, &s;hould they refu&s;e to follow his example. John's con&s;ent was the effect of di&s;&s;imulation. On pretence of going to Nice, that he and Benedict might make their renunciation together, he wanted to e&s;cape from Con&s;tance, that he might put an end to the council. Sigi&s;mund &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;ign, or|dered the avenues of the city to be guarded; and &s;ent the patriarch of Antioch to John, requiring him to appoint proctors for making the renunciation in his name. The pope declining this propo&s;al, he was pre&s;ented with the following re&s;olutions of the a&s;&s;embly: That the council had been ju&s;tly called, and fairly a&s;&s;embled: That even, tho' de&s;erted by the pope, or any other prelates, it &s;hould continue in being and authority, until the &s;chi&s;m &s;hould be extirpated, and a univer&s;al reformation in faith and morals take place, both in the head and members of the church: That the council &s;hould not be removed to any other place, nor any prelates or others, depart without &s;ufficient rea&s;on: That the pope him&s;elf &s;hould not quit the a&s;&s;embly, but appoint a proctor, to renounce in his name all title to the papal authority. To the&s;e articles John replied, that it would be more convenient for him&s;elf and the council to remove to Nice, where the king of Arragon and Benedict might confer with the empe|ror; and that the appointment of a proctor was unnece&s;&s;ary, as he intended to make the renunciation in his own per&s;on. This an&s;wer plainly demon&s;trated the intention of the pope, who, notwith&s;tanding the emperor's precautions, made his e&s;cape by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the duke of Au&s;tria, and the elector of Mentz, to Schaffhou&s;en, from whence he &s;ent four cardinals to di&s;&s;olve the council. This conduct produced the famous decree, importing, that this council repre&s;ent|ing the catholic church militant, had received immediately from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, a power, which per&s;ons of all conditions, even popes them&s;elves, were obliged to obey in every thing concerning the faith, the extirpation of the &s;chi&s;m, and re|formation of the church. John prote&s;ted again&s;t their proceedings; and they &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors, inviting him to return: but, he in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;uch high terms, that they altered their &s;train, and &s;ummoned him to appear in nine days, on pain of being proceeded again&s;t as a &s;ugitive and delinquent. The emperor perceiving, that he depended intirely upon the protection of the duke of Au&s;tria, invaded that dutchy with a numerous army, to the great terror of the duke, who humbled him&s;elf before Sigi&s;mund, and purcha&s;ed his peace, by making the pope pri&s;oner at Fribourg. In the mean time, the council condemned the doctrines of Wickliff, pronounced him and his memory accur&s;ed, and decreed, that his bones &s;hould be dug up and &s;cattered about with infamy. Then they cho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners to manage the proce&s;s again&s;t the pope, who was accu&s;ed of having by &s;imony obtained the dignity of cardinal: of having &s;old eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal preferments: of having attempted to poi&s;on his predece&s;&s;or; &s;old in|dulgences and relics, alienated the goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of churches and mo|na&s;teries,

denied the re&s;urrection, and a future &s;tate: of having led a very di$|$$lu$e l$$e, addicted to all manner of vices: of having neglected the duties of religion: of having debauched nuns, and lived in criminal and ince&s;tuous com|munication with his own brother's wife. Being convicted on the&s;e articles, the council &s;u&s;pended him from the exerci&s;e of all papal power, &s;piritual and tempo|ral; and a deputation of cardinals was &s;ent to inform him of the &s;entence. He ex|pre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t re&s;ignation to the decrees of the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;aid, he hoped they would have &s;ome regard to the condition of life in which he had hitherto appeared; at the &s;ame time, he wrote a very humble letter to Sigi&s;mund, crav|ing his favour and protection: but, notwith&s;tanding all his &s;ub$i&s;&s;ion and in|treaties, the council proceeded to the &s;entence of depo&s;ition; and decreed, that neither of the three competitors &s;hould be mentioned in the en&s;uing election.</P>

<P>The papacy being thus declared vacant, they began the trial of John Hu&s;s the famous Bohemian reformer, who was convicted of Here&s;y, and committed to the flames, in direct violation of the &s;afe-conduct which had been granted to him by Sigi&s;mund; a breach of faith that will reflect eternal di&s;|grace on the memory of that emperor. His friend and companion Jerome de Prague, met with the &s;ame fate; and both behaved with the courage, &s;implicity, and chri&s;tian charity of the primitive martyrs. They were accu&s;ed of having maintained impious$ horrible, and damnable opinions. They were con|demned as &s;editious, ob$tinate, incorrigible di&s;ciples and defenders of Wick|liff, hardened, crafty, malicious, and convicted heretics. Notwith&s;tanding this heavy charge, John Hu&s;s adopted no part of Wickliff's doctrine, but $hat concerned the hierarchy of the church, and the manners of the clergy. He believed tran&s;ub&s;tantiation and the expediency of image-wor&s;hip: but, he af|firmed the hierarchy of the church was not founded in &s;cripture: that the ex|ce&s;&s;ive authority of popes, cardinals, and bi&s;hops, was mere u&s;urpation: that the clergy in general were corrupted in their manners; and the benefactions to the church &s;hamefully mi&s;applied. The council u&s;ed all their art to draw him into a doubt or denial of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; and as he would not con$e&s;s any &s;uch p$inciple, he was convicted of it on the depo&s;ition of evidence. This ar|ticle was in&s;erted in his &s;entence merely as a pretext; but every unprejudiced per&s;on will perceive and own, that he and his companion were &s;acrificed to the temporal intere&s;t of the clergy. It was not the faith, but the authority of the church which they thought in danger: the &s;ame principle manife&s;ted it&s;elf in thus condemning the admini&s;tration of the communion in both &s;pecies. This they did not condemn as a thing $vil in it&s;elf; on the contrary, they owned it had been practi&s;ed in the antient church. But, they pronounced an anathema again&s;t tho&s;e who a$$erted, that the church had no right to aboli&s;h that prac|tice. With re&s;pect to &s;ome other &s;trange doctrines which $ell under their cog|nizance, as they did not affect the power of the clergy, the council pro|ceeded upon them with &s;urprizing indifference. John $$etit a lawyer, in the dominions of the duke of Burgundy, maintained, that each individual had a right to $lay a tyrant even by treachery: and this propo&s;ition being pre&s;ented to the council, that a&s;&s;embly, after much &s;oll$citation, declared it erroneous, without puni&s;hing, or even naming the author. The &s;ect of Flagillators a&s;&s;erted many capital errors, which being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the council, it was re&s;olved to find o$t &s;ome gentle means for bringing them back into the pale of the church.

The &s;ame coldne&s;s they manife&s;ted in the work of reformation, which was &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary. A li&s;t of abu&s;es indeed was made out, and they agreed upon the mo|del of reformation: but, by the artifice and intrigues of the cardinals and others, the execution of this plan was po&s;tponed, and afterwards wholly laid a&s;ide. The council now re&s;olved to choo&s;e a new pope, and, for this purpo&s;e, &s;ix prelates were cho&s;en out of each of the five nations, and joined as a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to the cardinals in whom the power of electing was formerly ve&s;ted: it was de|creed that no per&s;on &s;hould be deemed duly elected without having in his fa|vour two thirds of the cardinals and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and that the &s;tadhou&s;e of the city &s;hould be prepared as a conclave to be guarded by the emperor and magi&s;trates.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baronius.

<P>In the mean time the per&s;ecution raged among the Lollards in Eng|land, where John Cleyden, a citizen of London, and one Richard Turming, a baker, were burned in Smithfield. The archbi&s;hop, in convocation, enacted a con&s;titution directed to his &s;uffragans, enjoining them to make &s;trict &s;earch and inquiry twice a year after the per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y, that they might be proceeded again&s;t according to law, and either committed to pri&s;on or to the flames, as the nature of their crimes might require. A &s;ynod, being con|vened by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury at London, granted two tenths as a &s;upply for the war in France; and the duke of Bedford notified to the a&s;&s;embly the election of pope Martin V. who&s;e elevation was celebrated with rejoicings, anthems, and other acts of devotion. The a&s;&s;embly then enacted a decree for regulating the graduations at the two univer&s;ities, which decree met with great oppo&s;ition at Oxford and Cambridge; though it was at la&s;t received by the in|terpo&s;ition of king Henry V. who was him&s;elf a patron of learning. Pope Mar|tin began to encroach upon the liberties of the Engli&s;h church with the &s;ame arbitrary power which had been exerci&s;ed by his predece&s;&s;ors: he di&s;po&s;ed of bi&s;hoprics by way of provi&s;ion, and vacated the elections of the chapters. Henry, in order to put a &s;top to this u&s;urpation, as al&s;o to reform a number of abu&s;es which had crept in among the clergy, &s;ent John Ketterick, bi&s;hop of Co|ventry and Litchfield, to demand of the pope an expre&s;s Concordat, to which his holine&s;s agreed. In a convocation, held at this period in London, one Richard Walker, a prie&s;t, of Worce&s;ter, was tried and convicted of witchcraft, which he &s;olemnly renounced, and did publick penance. Many people were likewi&s;e obliged to abjure Lollardi&s;m; and the a&s;&s;embly granted a large &s;ub&s;idy to the king, who &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the French mona&s;teries in England, and granted their lands to other colleges of the learned. After this king's marriage, a convo|cation held at London pre&s;ented the king with a tenth, on condition that his purveyors &s;hould not encroach upon the goods of churchmen; and that no clergyman &s;hould be impri&s;oned but for theft and murder. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Goodwin.</NOTE></P>

<P>Towards the latter end of the reign of the fifth Henry, the Bene|dictine monks were become &s;o luxurious and di&s;&s;olute, that the king in&s;i&s;ted upon a reformation; and a provincial Capitulary for that purpo&s;e wa$ held in the Charter-hou&s;e at We&s;tmin&s;ter; where it was ordai$ed, That the ab$ors &s;hould employ their attention in the care of &s;ouls: That the extravagance of their equi|page &s;hould be retrenched, &s;o as that none &s;hould be attended by above twenty hor&s;e, under a &s;evere temporal penalty: That they &s;hould never make a gift of the effects of the convent above the value of forty &s;hillings: That they &s;hould be uniform in the colour and fa&s;hion of their habits: That their nece&s;&s;ities &s;hould be &s;upplied in kind and not in money: That they &s;hould not have di|&s;tinct private cells for the entertainment of female gue&s;ts; and, That they &s;hould be re&s;tricted from going into cities and towns to a&s;&s;i&s;t at compotations and merry-makings. By writs dated July 10, 1422, the king ordered the two archbi&s;hops to a&s;&s;emble their clergy in convocation, that they might grant a &s;ub&s;idy for the &s;upport of the French war; but the lower clergy alledged they were not properly impowered by their con&s;tituents to grant money; &s;o that the a&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olved without having come to any re&s;olution in the king's fa|vour. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, Robert Hake and Thomas Drayton, two prie&s;ts, were accu&s;ed of here&s;y, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to kneel to a crucifix, were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of books written again&s;t the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and inveighed again&s;t auricular confe&s;&s;ion as an invention of the devil.

<P>Archbi&s;hop Chichely was certainly a great enemy to Lollardi&s;m; but, at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be owned, he was a bold defender of the church of England again&s;t papal encroachments. In his fir&s;t convocation he moved for annulling papal exemptions; he oppo&s;ed the great power with which the pope
<PB N="465" REF="4750">
had inve&s;ted the cardinal bi&s;hop of England. He pre&s;ented to the king a full e$$ract of the nature, extent, and mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of the legatine of|fice. As the cardinal was impowered to hold the bi&s;hop$ic of Winche&s;ter in comm$nda$, he rem$n$$rated again&s;t the practice, as wholly unprecedented<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE> in England; he repre&s;ented that the Engli&s;h church needed no &s;uch &s;upple|mental buttre$$es as the power of legates a latere: that this office had been always dangerous to the crown of England, even when limited to one year; and that the danger mu$$ be much greater from the cardinal's commi&s;&s;ion, which was for life. Henry V. protected the archbi&s;hop again&s;t the vengeance of the pope, who was incen&s;ed again&s;t that prelate for his oppo&s;ition to the encroach|ments of Rome, and much more &s;o for his acquie&s;cence in the &s;tatute of pre|muni$e. The king's eyes were no &s;ooner clo&s;ed, than he poured forth his indig|nation in a $word$ to Chichely, wherein he accu&s;ed him of having neglected his p$$toral care, and minding nothing but the means of ama&s;&s;ing wealth. He &s;aid the archbi&s;hop &s;uffered his flock to brouze on poi&s;onous herbs; and that when wolves came to devour them, he &s;tood like a dumb dog, without &s;o much as $$cking. Then he inveighed again&s;t the &s;tatute of premunire, as an act that re|pealed the laws of God and the church, and de&s;troyed the antient u&s;ages of the kingdom. He complained that Jews, Turks, and infidels of all &s;orts, were al|lowed to land in Eng$$$d; whereas any per&s;on commi&s;&s;ioned by the holy &s;ee, was $$eat$d as a common enemy: and he concluded with an order to the arch|bi&s;hop to repair to the council, and u&s;e all his intere&s;t there and in the parlia|ment for the repeal of this &s;tatute; otherwi&s;e he &s;hould incur the penalty of excommunication. Chichely &s;ent an apology for his conduct to Rome; not|with&s;tanding which he was again &s;everely reprimanded, and his legatine power &s;u&s;pended. From this &s;ente$ce he appealed to a future council; or, if that &s;hould not fi$, to the tribunal of God. Martin wrote monitory letters to all the clergy in England, expatiating upon the illegality of the acts of provi&s;ors and pre|munire. He &s;ent a letter to the two archbi&s;hops, annulling all tho&s;e &s;tatutes, and forbidding the metropolitans to act upon the authority of &s;uch laws on pain of excommunication; and at the &s;ame time wrote a monitory letter, addre&s;&s;ed to the people of England, which he charged the archbi&s;hop to publi&s;h and affix in all public places. The archbi&s;hop of York, and the bi&s;hops of London, Durham, and Lincoln, wrote to his holine&s;s in favour of Chichely. Their ex|ample was followed by the univer&s;ity of Oxford, which gave te&s;timony greatly to the honour of the archbi&s;hop's character, and termed him the golden candle|&s;tick of the church of England. The&s;e recommendations were accompanied with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letter of the prelates own writing: but, in&s;pite of all this inter|po&s;ition, Martin remained implacable, and &s;ummoned Chichely to Rome, as an enemy to the pope in England. His holine&s;s was the more exa&s;perated, as the $uncio, who delivered his letters and bulls, had been impri&s;oned by the govern|ment. This outrage produced letters from the pope to the king, the duke of Bedford, and the parliament, complaining of &s;uch barbarous treatment, and exhorting them to concur in repealing the &s;tatutes. When the parliament met the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, attended by him of York, and the bi&s;hops of London, St. David's, Ely, Norwich, together with the abbots of We&s;tmin&s;ter and Reading, repaired to the hou&s;e of commons; and, in an elaborate &s;peech, advi&s;ed them to repeal the &s;tatutes which had given &s;uch offence: but, the

members &s;uppo&s;ing this harangue was the effect of compul&s;ion, payed no re|gard to the remon&s;trance; but pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty would write to the pope for the purgation of the archbi&s;hop. When the cru&s;ade again&s;t the Bohemians was preached up, and the cardinal of Win|che&s;ter declared general of that enterprize, the pope ordered that prelate to col|lect a te$th from the Engli&s;h clergy for the expence of the expedition: but all the convocation would grant was eight-pence in the mark, on condition it &s;hould be $ound con&s;i&s;tent with the king's prerogative and the laws of the king|dom.

Thomas, bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter; William, prior of Norwich; Thomas Brown, dean of Sali&s;bury; Peter Patrick, chancellor of Lincoln; Ro|bert Barton, precentor of Lincoln; John Sali&s;bury, doctor of divinity; and John Simon De&s;borough, batchelor in common law, were cho&s;en for this pur|po&s;e, and received in&s;tructions to act again&s;t all papal di&s;pen&s;ations and other abu&s;es which had crept into the church of Rome; e&s;pecially that of providing livings for unqualified per&s;ons. Pope Martia would have avoided convening this council, if it had been in his power, but finding him&s;elf &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed by the emperor and other powers in Chri&s;tendom, he ordered cardinal Juli$$ to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1431.</NOTE> open and pre&s;ide in the a&s;&s;embly. Since the council of Con&s;tance, the Hu$$i$es of Bohemia had been treated with &s;uch rigour, as &s;erved only to $word$ them in the belief of their tenets, which they re&s;olved to maintain in &s;pite of the decrees of the council. The principal article on which they in&s;i&s;ted, was the communion in both &s;pecies; and their re&s;olution, in this particular, was oppo|&s;ed by the pope and the catholics in &s;uch a manner, as filled Bohemia with civil war and confu&s;ion. On the death of their king Wince&s;$aus, his brother Sigi&s;mund, the emperor, claimed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but was rejected by the H$$|&s;ites, as a per&s;ecutor of their &s;ect, and a notorious faith-breaker. Martin V. e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of Sigi&s;mund, and publi&s;hing cru&s;ades again&s;t the Hu&s;&s;ites, they found them&s;elves obliged to &s;tand in their own defence, and cho&s;e for their general one Zi&s;ca, who defeated the emperor in &s;everal engagements. This war continued till the meeting of the council at Ba&s;il; which, con&s;idering the bad &s;ucce&s;s of Sigi&s;mund, re&s;olved to make peace with the Hu&s;&s;ites. With this view the fathers invited them to &s;end deputies to the council, who, being &s;ent accordingly, pre&s;ented four articles; to which, &s;hould the council agree, they offered to re$$ite them&s;elves with the church. They demanded, that the communion &s;hould be admini&s;tered in both &s;pecies to the $aity in Bohemia: that &s;inners &s;hould be corrected according to the law of God, by tho&s;e to whom &s;uch correction properly belonged: that the word of God &s;hould be preached by well qualified pa&s;tors: and, that the clergy &s;hould have no ju|ri&s;diction over temporalities. The fathers of the council exhau&s;ted all their art and eloquence in per&s;uading the $ohemians to &s;ubmit to the church at di&s;cretion; b$t, $nding them inflexible, re&s;olved to grant their demands$ on condition that they &s;hould be previou&s;ly explained, in order to avoid new di&s;|putes. They accordingly explained them in their own way, and a Concordat
<PB N="467" REF="4770">
was &s;ettled, to the &s;atisfaction of all parties. This affair being accommodated, Sigi&s;mund was acknowledged king of Bohemia, after having approved of the Concordat, and &s;ub&s;cribed &s;ome other conditions: but, he had no &s;ooner mounted the t$ro$e, than he broke his promi&s;e; and the pope refu&s;ed to &s;ign the Concordat. The troubles of Bohemia were renewed; and, being &s;omen$od by the court of Rome, continued till the Hu&s;&s;ites were entirely ruined.</P>

<P>Though the council of B$&s;il had been convoked by pope Martin V. that po$tiff died before the meeting of the a&s;&s;embly, and was &s;ucceeded in the papacy by Eugenius IV. who took umbrage at the invitation which had been &s;ent to the Hu$$ites; all$dging, that as they were heretics who had been al|ready condemned in the council of Con&s;tance, they de&s;erved no indulgence$ and on that pretence he publi&s;hed a bull to di&s;&s;olve the council. The fa$hers, far from &s;ubmitting to this mandate, re&s;olved by a majority to continue the &s;$&s;|&s;ions: and this di&s;pute produced a real &s;chi&s;m; &s;ome acknowledging the au|t$ority of th$ council, and others adhering to the pope. Several d$$rees were made to exalt the authority of the council above that of the pope; and the&s;e, as fa&s;t as they were enacted, did his holine&s;s cancel and annul; affirming that the member$ could not act without the direction of the head. A$ the emperor, the king of France, and almo&s;t all the other princes of Europe, declared for the council, Euge$ius was fain to conform, and allow it to proceed: but, when he $ont other legates to pre&s;ide in his name, they refu&s;ed to receive them in that quali$y; and this refu&s;al was a new cau&s;e of di&s;&s;en&s;ion. The pope threatened again to di&s;&s;olve the council, and this la&s;t menaced his holine&s;s with a &s;entence of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; at length, however, Eugenius, finding him&s;elf u$equal to th$ conte&s;t, dropped all oppo&s;ition, and confirmed the council. The&s;e advances<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spondan. Aen. Sylv. Na$cler.</NOTE> of the pope were deemed &s;atisfactory by the council, which admitted his le|gate$: but the emperor Sigi&s;mund dying, and the Greeks declaring for Eu|genius, he retracted his conde&s;cen&s;ion, and tran&s;lated the council to Ferr$$a. The fathers at Ba&s;il, exa&s;perated at this &s;tep, filled all Europe with remon&s;trances touching the pope's perfidy: they prote&s;ted again&s;t the a&s;&s;embly at Ferrara, &s;um|moned all the prelates to repair to Ba&s;il in thirty days, and denounced excom|munication again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould ob&s;truct their coming. The council was &s;upport$d by the Germans, Spaniards, and the majority of the Italians. Charles VII. of France convoked an a&s;&s;embly of his prelates, in which it was re&s;olved that France &s;hould own the authority of the council at Ba&s;il; but, at the &s;ame time, yield obedience to pope Eugenius: the Engli&s;h, however, fa|voured Eugenius, becau&s;e the council had refu&s;ed to ratify the treaty of Troyes, by which Charles VII. was excluded from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and king Henry promi|&s;ed to &s;end delegates to the council of Ferrara. Cardinal Julian, the pre&s;ident of the council, and all the other cardinals, except one, abandoned Ba$$$, and carried along with them a good number of bi&s;hops to the pope's council, which acquired &s;till more reputation and authority from the arrival of the Gr$$k em|peror with a numerous train of his prelates at Ferrara; from which place, in the &s;ucceeding year, Eugenius tran&s;lated the council to Florence, where i$+formed a &s;ort of union between the Greek and Latin churches, though this was of very &s;hort duration.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, Chichely archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury dying, was &s;ucceeded by John Strafford, &s;on of the earl of Strafford,
<PB N="468" REF="4780">
b$&s;h$p of B$th and Wells, and lord high trea&s;urer of England. Soon after his elevation to the metropolitan &s;ee, the clergy, in con$$cation, complained that the act of premunire was, by the chicanery of common lawyers, turned into an engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, which &s;ubjected them to vexatious &s;uits: they t$erefore moved that either application might be made to parliament for re|p$$ling the &s;t$$$tes of provi&s;or and premunire, or for &s;ettling the true &s;en&s;e $nd meani$g, &s;o as that the clergy might not &s;uffer by the arts of quibbling l$wyers. B$t the&s;e were deemed, by the majority, points of too delicate a na|t$re $or them to d$$cu&s;s, and the motion was laid a&s;ide. This grievance, how|$ver, becoming more and more intolerable, the b$&s;hops afterwards took it in|to con&s;ideration; and, after various debates, both hou&s;es of the convocation re&s;$lved to addre&s;s his maje&s;ty, and petition that the clau&s;e "Or El&s;ewhere" $n the &s;ta$ute of premunire &s;hould be expunged. It was enacted in the &s;tatute, <Q>&startq;That if any purcha&s;e, or pur&s;ue, or cau&s;e to be purcha&s;ed or pur&s;ued, in the $h$rch of Rome, "Or El&s;ewhere," any &s;uch tran&s;lations, proce&s;&s;es, &s;entences o$ excommunication, bulls, in&s;truments, or any thing affecting the king's $$gats, &amp;c.&endq;</Q> And common lawyers, di&s;po&s;ed to harra&s;s the clergy, u&s;ed to p$t &s;uch con&s;truction upon the words "Or El&s;ewhere," as brought them wi$hin the &s;tatute, even when they pro&s;ecuted any matter of eccle&s;ia&s;tical right before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts within the kingdom. They therefore ob&s;erved that tho&s;e words, "Or El&s;ewhere," referred only to the place in which the pope might chance to pre&s;ide; and prayed that &s;ome remedy might be ap|plied to this evil: but the times were too un&s;ettled for t$em to expect imme|diate &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>During the&s;e efforts of the clergy in England, the council of Ba&s;il continued to proceed again&s;t pope Eugenius, whom they at length depo&s;ed, and cho&s;e in his room Amadeus, duke of Savoy, who had re&s;igned the admi|ni&s;tration of his dominions, and retired to a life of &s;olitude at Ripaile. This new pontiff a&s;&s;umed the name of Felix V. and now a double &s;chi&s;m was formed in the church between two general councils and two popes, who condemned<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1441.</NOTE> and excommunicated one another, and all their adherents mutually. In order to concert mea&s;ures for terminating this &s;candalous contention, an a&s;&s;embly was held in Germany by the princes and prelates of the empire; who could find no other expedient for that purpo&s;e than the convocation of a new council, till the meeting of which they &s;hould remain neuter. This propo&s;al was con|firmed by the diet of Frankfort, and the council of Ba&s;il a&s;&s;ented to it, though<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1442.</NOTE> with reluctance. Mean while pope Felix, being di&s;contented at the proceed|ings of the fathers at Ba&s;il, who he thought acted with too high a hand, reti|red to Lau&s;anne, on pretence that the air of this place was more healthy than that of Ba&s;il; and Eugenius t$an&s;lated his council from Florence to Rome, where the &s;e&s;&s;ion was held in the church of St. John of Lateran.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXV.</HEAD>
<P>At length, the German princes, a&s;&s;embling at Frankfort, unani|mou&s;ly re&s;olved that if Eugenius &s;hould refu&s;e to give them &s;atisfaction with re&s;pect to certain grievances of which they complained, they would acknow|ledge the election and authority of Felix. Eugenius &s;crupled at $ir&s;t to com|ply with their demands; but the emperor, giving him to under&s;tand that he would infallibly lo&s;e all Germany by his non-compliance, he conde&s;cended to grant all that the Germans de&s;ired; and a Concordat was ratified accordingly.
<PB N="469" REF="4790">
This was a terrible &s;troke to the council of Ba&s;il, which had been already di&s;|owned by Italy, Arragon, and &s;everal other countries, be&s;ides France and Eng|land: though it conceived fre&s;h hopes from the death of its antagoni&s;t Euge|nius, who was &s;ucceeded by Nicholas V. Neverthele&s;s, it gained very little advantage from this alteration: on the contrary, its authority dimini&s;hed every day; and Felix retained but a very &s;mall number of p$rti&s;ans. The king of France a&s;&s;embling an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council at Lyons, to deliberate upon mea|&s;ures for terminating the &s;chi&s;m, Felix &s;ent thither his legates, and con&s;ented to re&s;ign the pontificate upon certain conditions. This offer was the &s;ubject of a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trithemius Aventinus Mutius.</NOTE> negotiation with Nicholas, who having granted almo&s;t all the demands of his competitor, Felix re&s;igned his dignity with the approbation of his council, which had by this time removed to Lau&s;anne, where, in its la&s;t decree, it ap|proved the ce&s;&s;ion of Felix, created him cardinal and legate a latere in Savoy and the Tarentai&s;e; and allowed him to wear for life the pontifical habit. Ni|cholas confirmed this decree according to agreement; and thus ended the di&s;|pute which had produced a complication of three &s;chi&s;ms; fir&s;t between Eu|genius and the council of Ba&s;il, then between the two general councils, and la&s;tly between the two popes.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The zeal of the Engli&s;h clergy, in &s;upporting the pope again&s;t the council, encouraged Nicholas to renew the papal encroachments in England. He &s;ent a pompous epi&s;tle to the king, together with a con&s;ecrated ro&s;e; and at the &s;ame time demanded a t$nth on the clergy. He was, however, di&s;ap|pointed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1452.</NOTE> in his hope. His reque&s;t was denied; and the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury prohibited from executing the pope's bull, or &s;uffering any money to be collected. In a &s;ub&s;equent convocation held at London, the pope's agent &s;o$|licited a &s;upply for his ma&s;ter. He expatiated upon the narrow e&s;cape of his holine&s;s from the wicked attempt of Stephen Porchard, inveighed again&s;t the degeneracy of the Roman people; and declared, that if the Engli&s;h would grant a proper &s;upply, the pope would immediately quit Rome and Italy, and re&s;ide in &s;ome place near England. All that the Engli&s;h clergy would grant, in con&s;equence of this remon&s;trance, was a form of prayer for the per&s;onal &s;afety of his holine&s;s. It was about this period, that Strafford archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury died, and had for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or John Kemp cardinal archbi&s;hop of York, who had been dean of the arches, vicar-general to archbi&s;hop Chicheley, and governor of Normandy: then he was created bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, from whence he was tran&s;lated to Chiche&s;ter, and afterwards to London and York. This prelate dying within the year after his elevation, the vacant &s;ee was filled by Thomas Bourchier brother to the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and cardinal bi&s;hop of Ely, who made a vi&s;itation into Kent, and compo&s;ed a &s;et of articles of reformation for his province.</P>

<P>But the mo&s;t remarkable churchman that lived at this period, was Peacock bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, a per&s;on of great learning and reputation, who publicly a&s;&s;erted, that the Latin fathers St. Jerome, St. Ambro&s;e, St. Augu&s;tine, and St. Gregory, ought to have no greater authority than the &s;trength of their rea&s;oning, and the merit of their doctrine, acquired; that matters of faith could be judged by rea&s;on alone, to which he likewi&s;e referred all controver&s;y; that the apo&s;tles were not the authors of the creed which they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have framed; that the meaning of the Holy Scriptures was to be learned from
<PB N="470" REF="4800">
natural rea&s;on only; that Chri&s;t never de&s;cended into hell; and that chri&s;tians were not $bliged to ob&s;erve the canons, any further than they &s;hould appear agreeable to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. He inveighed agai$&s;t the o$tentation and mag$ificen$e of churchmen; he repro$ched them for their neglect of pa|roc$$al duties: he &s;aid they them&s;elves might &s;it as originals of the defo$mities they la&s;$ed; and that they recommended tho&s;e qualifications of whi$h they fo$nd them&s;elves de&s;titute. His &s;atire again&s;t the pride and luxury of the pre|la$$s inflamed the populace to &s;uch a degree, that they rai&s;ed violent commo|tio$s in diff$rent parts of the kingdo$. The bi&s;hops of Chiche&s;ter and Sa|li&s;bury were murdered, and their hou&s;es pillaged; tho&s;e of Litchfield and No$|wich were $xpelled from their h$bitation; and &s;everal other eccle&s;ia$$ics lo&s;t their lives. Peacock was patronized by the duke of Suffolk, at who&s;e death<NOTE PLACE="marg">$ayle.</NOTE> the bi&s;hop's books were ex$mined in a &s;ynod at Lambeth, and he him&s;elf obliged to r$cant great p$rt of his doctrine. Then he wa$ &s;ent to d$ pen$$ce at Canterbury, where $e began again to bro$ch the $$me $en$ts, declaring pub|licly, that t$e te&s;t of the Script$res was rea&s;on; that the practice of pu$c$a&s;ing preferme$$s from the pope was unwa$$$ntable; that no per&s;on was bound $o obey the determination of the Roman church; that the belief of Chri$$'s p$e|&s;ence in the $$chari&s;t was not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; a$d that the church may $rr in points of faith.

<P>Edward IV. found the friend&s;hip of the clergy &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that he granted a charter, exempting them from the juri&s;diction of the civil power in criminal cau&s;es, remitting all &s;uch to the judgment of their ordinaries. The&s;e favours, while they &s;erved to e&s;tabli&s;h Edward's throne, at the &s;ame time excited the pride of the clergy and t$e envy of t$e lay &s;ubject$, which co|operated in paving the way for the reformation.

Geoffrey Chaucer, a man of a good family, was care&s;&s;ed for his talent in po$try by Edward III. who allowed him a pi$cher of wine every day from his cellar. Richard II. fixed this pe$qui&s;ite at one hog&s;h$$d of wine a year, and twenty pounds out of the exch$$uer; and Henry IV. continued to indulge him with the &s;ame allowance, which is &s;aid to have been the origin of that pen&s;ion which is &s;till payed to the poet laure$$.

He publi&s;hed a book upon the articles of faith of the Roman catholic church; and compo&s;ed a per|formance in Latin, upon the reformation of the clergy. Peter Clark, ma&s;ter of arts in the univer&s;ity of Oxford, was a follower of Wickliff, and di&s;puted about the controverted points with Thomas Walden.

When he fir&s;t undertook this enterprize, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen his claim by a matrimo|nial union with the hou&s;e of York; and now he acquired an additional title from co$que&s;t: but, as he knew this la&s;t would not be admitted by the Eng|li&s;$, and could not bear the thought of reigning in right of his wife, de&s;cended

from a family to which he had an unconquerable aver&s;ion, he re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the &s;overeignty as heir of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter; and in the mean time to take &s;uch precautions as would prevent any rival&s;hip. With this view, he &s;ent Sir Robert Willoughby with a detachment of hor&s;e, to remove the earl of War|wick to the Tower, from the ca&s;tle of Sheriff-Hutton in York&s;hire, in which he had been confined by Richard. As this nobleman, the &s;on of the duke of Clarence, was the only male branch of the hou&s;e of York, &s;uppo&s;ed to be then living, Henry ordered him to be &s;trictly guarded in the Tower, and kept from all communication, until the unfortunate prince fell by the hands of the common executioner. The prince&s;s Elizabeth had been likewi&s;e detained as a pri&s;oner at large by the late king, in the ca&s;tle of Sheriff-Hutton; and now &s;he received a me&s;&s;age from Henry, de&s;iring &s;he would repair to London, and live with her mother, until the celebration of their nuptials, which, however, he intended to po&s;tpone, until his own title &s;hould be recognized by par|liament. He him&s;elf took the &s;ame route, and cho&s;e to enter the city on a Sa|turday, becau&s;e he had obtained the victory at Bo&s;worth on that day of the week, which he ever after accounted propitious to his fortune. The mayor and companies of London received him at Shoreditch, from when$$ he made his public entry, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, who looked upon him as their deliverer, and the per&s;on in who&s;e union with Elizabeth, all the $ni|mo&s;ity between the two Ro&s;es would be extingui&s;hed. Never$hele&s;s, the popu|lace were a little di&s;&s;atisfied at his pa&s;&s;ing through the city in a clo&s;e chariot, &s;o as that he could not be &s;een like their former kings, who had always entered the city on hor&s;eback. He proceeded directly to St. Paul's church, where he offered up the &s;tandards he had won; and Te Deum being again celebrated, he repaired to his lodging at the bi&s;hop's palace.</P>

<P>In a few days after his arrival at London, he a&s;&s;embled a council of all the nobility and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction who happened to be at his court, or in the neighbourhood; and &s;olemnly renewed the oath he had formerly taken to wed the prince&s;s Elizabeth. He found this $tep ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to de|&s;troy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> a report that he was actually engaged to marry Anne da$ghter and heir of the duke of Brittany. He had always intended to fulfil his fir&s;t obligation; but his intention was to defer his marriage until he &s;hould have received the crown, le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;trengthen his right by that union with the hou&s;e of York. In the month of September, the city of London and &s;ome other parts of the kingdom were afflicted with a new di&s;temper called the &s;weat|ing &s;ickne&s;s, a kind of malignant fever which made great havock, and of which the patient commonly died in four and twenty hours, after his being fir&s;t taken. This malady, however, was of &s;hort duration; and even before it di&s;appeared, the method of cure was pretty well a&s;certained. Among the fir&s;t acts of Hen|ry's &s;overeignty, he be&s;towed the government of the Tower upon the earl of Ox|ford, who had been always a zealous parti&s;an for the hou&s;e of L$$ca&s;ter. Then he publi&s;hed a proclamation, &s;pecifying that he had concluded one year's t$$ce with the king of France: a circum&s;tance that opera$ed to his advantage in Eng|land, which was the better di&s;po&s;ed to obey his government, on account of his t$tle's being acknowledged by &s;uch a prince as Charles, even before it was re|cogni$ed by his own parliament. His next &s;tep was to recompence tho&s;e to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> whom he lay under the greate&s;t obligations. His uncle J$$per ear$ of $$mbroke$$
<PB N="476" REF="4860">
who had $cted the part of a father to him in his youth, and more than once delivered him from the &s;nares of his enemies, was created duke of Bedford. The $word$ of Derby was con&s;erred upon Thomas lord Stanley his own father-in|law, to whom he owed the victory at Bo&s;worth; and, Edward Courtney was ho$o$$ed with the $itle of earl of Devon&s;hire.</P>

<P>The ceremony of the coronation was performed on the thirtieth day of October, by cardinal Bourchier archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; and that &s;ame day Henry in&s;tituted a body-guard of fifty archers, called yeomen, under the com|mand of a captain, to be in continual attendance on his per&s;on; which band has been kept up by all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. On the &s;eventh day of November, the parliament meeting at We&s;tmin&s;ter, intailed the crown upon Henry, not by way of recog|$ition $word$ ordinance, but in the manner of &s;ettlement; enacting, That the $word$ of the crown &s;hould re&s;t, remain and abide, in him and the heirs of his body; and this &s;tatute was afterwards confirmed by the pope's bull, in which, however, his titles of de&s;cent and conque&s;t were recited. The act of &s;ettle|ment and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion being pa&s;&s;ed, a difficulty aro&s;e about the rever&s;al of the &s;entences of attainder, which had been denounced again&s;t Henry's adherents. A good number of the&s;e were actually returned to &s;erve in this parliament; and &s;ome members ob&s;erved, that they could not with any ju&s;tice &s;it as judges in their own cau&s;e. The king referred this point to the deci&s;ion of the judges, who were $nanimou&s;ly of opinion, that the members in que&s;tion &s;hould ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the parliament, until their attainder &s;hould be annulled by a $ew $t$tute. Another debate en&s;ued, touching the king him&s;elf, who had been declared traitor and rebel by an authentic act of parliament. This was a $o$e knotty point than the former; becau&s;e he could not detach him&s;elf from parliament without its being di&s;&s;olved: not was he at all di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ub|mit to a parliamentary inquiry. On this occa&s;ion the judges declared, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne takes away all defects, and clears the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or from all &s;e$$ence, crime, or attainder. The&s;e affairs being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the parliament pro|ceeded to p$&s;$ a bill of attainder again&s;t the late king, under the name of Rich|$$d duke of Glouce&s;ter, as well as again&s;t the duke of Nor&s;olk, the earl of Surrey, lord Lovel, lord Ferrers, lord Zouch, Richard Ratcli$$e, William Ca$$&s;$y, and &s;everal other adherents of Richard. Thus, he at once gratified his revenge and his avarice; for, the confi&s;cations produced &s;uch large &s;ums, that he could not with any decency a&s;k a &s;ub&s;idy from parliament. When he had in this manner taken vengeance on his enemies, and filled his coffers; he publi&s;hed a general a$ne&s;ty in favour of all tho&s;e who had taken up arms again&s;t him, provided they &s;hould make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion within a limited time; and imme|diately a great number quitted &s;anctuary, and took the $ath of allegiance. Before the parliament broke up, the lord of Chandos, a native of Brittany, was created earl of Bath, Sir Giles D'Aubeny was promoted to the title of a baron, and Sir Robert Willoug$by was made lord Brooke: at the &s;ame time, the king re|&s;tored to Edward Strafford the title of duke of Buckingham, which he had lo&s;t by the attainder of his father; and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fami|ly-e$ta$e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> which had been confi&s;cated in the la&s;t reign.</P>

<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion being fini&s;hed about the latter end of November, Henry &s;ent into France Oliver King archdeacon of Oxford, with money to reimbur&s;e king Charles, for the &s;ums he had lent towards the equipment of the armament

which had conveyed the earl of Richmond into England$ &s;o th$t the $word$ of Dor&s;et and Sir John Bo$rchier, who remained as ho$tages, were &s;et $word$ li$erty. Oliver was likewi&s;e ve&s;ted with power to prolong the truce between the two kingdoms, &s;hould $e find Charles inclined to that expedient. In ord$r to di&s;|charge the obligation of the loan, Henry attempted to borro$ &s;ix $word$ marks of the city of London; but, it was with great diffi$ulty that they $on|&s;ented to lend him two thou&s;and pounds, which he thankfully r$ceived, and punctually repayed. About this period John Mor$on, and Richard Fox bi&s;hops of Ely and Exeter, were admitted into the privy council. The former was, after the death of archbi&s;hop Bourchier, promoted to the &s;ee of Canterb$ry; while Fox was made keeper of the privy &s;eal, and afterwa$ds advanced thro$$h the &s;ees of Bath and Durham, to the bi&s;hoprick of Winche&s;ter$ The&s;e $wo p$$|lates, and one Ur&s;ewick the king's chaplain, were always e$$loyed in the $o$t important commi&s;&s;ions, emba&s;&s;ies, and negotiations. The king cho$$ eccle$$$&s;|tics for his mini&s;ters, not only becau&s;e they were generally better qualified than the laity, but al&s;o becau&s;e it was in his power to recompence their &s;ervices with church benefices, which &s;aved him the expence of gratifying them fro$ his own private finances: and this was a very powerful con$ideratio$ $ith a prince who&s;e predominant pa&s;&s;ion was avarice.</P>

<P>Although Henry hated the hou&s;e of York in his heart, he $ound it ab|&s;olutely<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1486.</NOTE> nece&s;&s;ary to fulfil the promi&s;e he had made to marry the pri$ce&s;s Elizabeth; and the nuptials were &s;olemnized on the eightee$th day of Janu|ary, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the nation. The demon&s;trations of popul$r &s;atisfaction which appeared on this occa&s;ion, were extremely mortifying to the king, who con&s;idered them as &s;o many marks of affection to the hou&s;e of York, for which he had conceived &s;uch aver&s;ion, that his queen was alway$ treat$d by him with the utmo&s;t coldne&s;s and indifference. He never let &s;lip an op|portunity to humble the parti&s;ans of that hou&s;e, towards whom he ever acted rather as the chief of a party, than as an equitable &s;overeign. The &s;ol$$ni|zation of the king's nuptials was the more agreeable to the people, as it was immediately preceded by the tidings of a truce concluded for th$ee $word$ with Charles of France, who had formed a project again&s;t Brittany, and willingly li&s;tened to the propo&s;al of a truce, which would hinder the king of Eng$$nd from &s;upporting that dutchy. Henry, on the other hand, being ignorant of his de&s;igns, thought the friend&s;hip of &s;uch a monarch would render him the more<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> formidable to his dome&s;tic enemies.</P>

<P>After his marriage he made a progre&s;s into the northern cou$ties, which had been in a particular manner attached to the per&s;on of Richard; and pa&s;&s;ed his Ea&s;ter holidays at Lincoln, hoping that his pre&s;ence$ and &s;ome acts of favour, would intirely di&s;pel any di&s;content that might prevail in that coun|try. While he re&s;ided in this city, he received intimation, that the lord Lovel, with Humphrey and Thomas Stafford, had privately withdrawn from th$ &s;anc|tuary at Colche&s;ter. But, he payed very little regard to this intelligenc$, and proceeded to York, where he under&s;tood that Lovel was on his ma$ch tow$$ds that place, at the head of three or four thou&s;and men; and, tha$ th$ two Staf|fords had inve&s;ted the city of Worce&s;ter. Henry was the more alarmed at this information, as he found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of the malecontents, with whom he &s;uppo&s;ed the rebels cairied on a corre&s;pondence. Nev$r$hle&s;s, he concea$ed
<PB N="478" REF="4880">
his fears and &s;u&s;picion, and imm$diately i&s;&s;$ed commi&s;&s;ions for levying troops in the neighbourhood of York, where his officers met with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in a little time, th$y rai$$d a body of three thou&s;and men; the command of which was give$ $o the king's uncle the duke of Bedford. This nobleman was &s;ent again&s;t th$ rebels, with expre&s;s order to avoid a battle, as the men were raw, undi&s;ciplin$d, and but indifferently affected to the cau&s;e; but he was in&s;tructed to appro$ch them with a good counten$nce, and publi&s;h a pardon in the king's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi$$. Croy|land. Co$t.</NOTE> name, to all tho&s;e who &s;hould lay down their arms and &s;ubmit. This expedi|dient &s;ucceeded to the king's wi&s;h. The pardon was no &s;ooner proclaimed, than lord Lovel, in apprehe$&s;ion of being abandoned by his troops, retired alo$e into L$$ca$$ire, where he lay for &s;ome time concealed in the hou&s;e of his friend Sir Thomas Broughton; and then cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea, repaired to the court of the du$che&s;s dow$ger of Burgundy. The two Straffords no &s;ooner heard of this tran&s;action, than they rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Worce&s;ter; and being for&s;aken by their followers, retir$d to the church of Colnham, where they took &s;anctuary. But, the court of Kings-Bench declaring, that the privilege of this place did not ex$end to traitors, they were taken thence by force: the elder brother Hu$p$$ey was ex$cuted at Tyburn, and the younger pardoned, in con&s;idera|tion of his youth, and of his having been &s;educed by the other.</P>

<P>On the third day of July, a truce for th$ee years was concluded with James king of Scotland; and, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame month, John le Bout|$ill$r lord of Ma$per$$is, amba&s;&s;ador from Francis II. duke of Bretagne, pro|lo$ged, in his ma$$er's name, the truce between England and that country, until the dea$$ of one of the contracting princes; but, it was &s;tipulated, that the treaty of commerce between the two nations &s;hould continue to the death of the la&s;t liver. On the twentieth day of September, the queen was in the eighth $onth of her pregnancy, delivered of a &s;on, who was baptized by the name of Arthur, in memory of the famous Briti$$ Arthur, from whom the king affected to derive his origin. The people hoped, that the birth of this pri$$e would w$rm the king's indifference into a real affection for the mother; b$t, when they perceived it had no &s;uch effect; that he delayed her corona|tion; took all opportunities of depre&s;&s;ing the friends of the hou&s;e of York, which was generally beloved throughout the whole kingdom; that his di&s;po|&s;$$ion was &s;ordid and illiberal; and, that his temper was &s;ullen and re&s;erved: th$y b$gan to look upon him with dete&s;tation, and even to think they had made a bad exchange for the tyrant Richard. His enemies took this opportunity to $word$ that he in$ended to murder the earl of Warwick in the Tower; and the emi&s;&s;aries of the hou&s;e of York whi&s;pered about, that the duke of York had made his e&s;cape from the cru$lty of his uncle, and was &s;till alive on the contin$$t.</P>

<P>The univer&s;al joy expre&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h people at this report, encouraged Richard Simon, a prie&s;t of Oxford, to devi&s;e a &s;cheme which was equally e$$$avagant and enterprizing. He had a pupil called Lambert Sim|nel, the illegitimate &s;on of a joiner, a youth of uncommon vivacity and extraordinary per&s;onal accompli$$ments; and, him he re&s;olved to pa&s;s upon the world as Richard duke of York, the &s;econd &s;on of the fourth Edward. While he was empl$yed in preparing this actor for the &s;tage, it was rumoured, that Edward Plantagenet earl of Warwick had e&s;caped from the Tower; and
<PB N="479" REF="4890">
Simon immediately changing his plan, determined that his p$pil &s;$ould p$$|&s;ona$e this nobleman; a &s;cheme much more e$$rava$$$t than th$ oth$r, i$ we con&s;ider, that the &s;on of Clarence had been, after his f$ther's death, honourably maintained in the court of his u$cle Edward, until he wa$ t$n years of $ge$ and that therefore, his per&s;on was well known to a g$$$t number of peop$$. Notwith&s;tanding this ob&s;tacle, Simon continued to in$$r$ct hi$ p$pil in hi$ new part; and when he thought the impo&s;ture rip$, h$ co$veyed him to Ire|land, where he knew he &s;hould not run &s;uch a ri&s;que of d$t$ction as in Eng|land. There he hoped the young man would be powerfully &s;$pported, as that kingdom revered the memory of Clarence, who h$d been their gov$$nor$ and as Henry had not yet &s;uper&s;$ded the public officers wh$ $$d b$$n ap|pointed by Richard. For, tho' the duke of Bedfod had b$$n d$cl$red vice$$y of Ireland, he &s;till continued in England: Thomas Fitz$erald earl of Kildare governed as his deputy, and his brother po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the po&s;t of chancellor in tha$ kingdom. As they were both parti&s;ans of the hou&s;e of York, in all p$$b$$i|lity, they had by their emi&s;&s;aries privately concerted this &s;cheme with Si$$$, who was likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to have been encouraged by the quee$ dow$$er$ who deeply re&s;ented Henry's behaviour to her daughter. The king had been informed, that &s;omething was brewing in Ireland, to the prejudice of his go|vernment, and ordered the earl of Kildare to appear at his court in Londo$: but, that nobleman had &s;uch intere&s;t in the council, that they wrote a let$er to Henry, repre&s;enting the earl's pre&s;ence a$ ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in Ireland; and he was excu&s;ed in con&s;equence of this remon&s;trance.</P>

<P>When Simnel arrived at Dublin, he forthwith addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the earl, in quality of earl of Warwick, recounting the manner in which he pre|tended to have e&s;caped from the Tower; and tho' the deputy-lieuten$nt and his brother did not openly e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e at his fi$$t landing, their omitting to apprehend &s;uch a pretender, plainly indicates their co$niva$ce at the imp$$|ture. They waited to &s;ee the effects of the deceit am$$g the common people, who received Simnel with tran&s;ports of joy, as the &s;on o$ their beloved Cla|rence. Then the earl of Kildare, and his brother the chancellor, having con$erred with their friends and confidents, waited upon Sim$el at his lodgings; from whence he was conducted with great &s;olemnity to the ca&s;tle, where he was treated as a prince, and behaved with &s;uch dignity of deportment, as ove$came the &s;u&s;picion of many people, who at fir&s;t doubted the truth of his preten&s;ions. The popular &s;tream was &s;o much in his favo$r, that in a few days he was pro|claimed king of England, and lord of Ireland, under the name of Edward VI. and not a &s;word was drawn, nor one mouth opened in behalf of Henry.</P>

<P>Such an event could not but be alarming to the king, who now &s;aw him&s;elf attacked in his weake&s;t part, namely, his title, and in a country wholly devoted to his adver&s;aries, which he could not pretend to &s;ubdue without a very con&s;iderable expence: be&s;ides, he apprehended, that the fire which had broke out in Ireland would &s;oon communicate to the other kingdom$ by means of &s;ecret corre&s;pondence, the nature and manner of which he did not know. Perplexed by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he convened his privy council, in order to deliberate upon the mea&s;ures to be taken in &s;uch an emergency; and here, in all probability, he &s;ignified his &s;u&s;picion of his mother-in-law the queen do$|ager; for &s;he was immediately confined in the mona&s;tery of Bermond&s;$y;
<PB N="480" REF="4900">
and deprived of her whole e&s;tate without any form of proce&s;s. The whole nation exclaimed again&s;t this act of &s;everity, which he in vain endeavoured to palliate, by giving out that this puni&s;hment was inflicted upon her for hav|ing delivered her daughters into the hands of Richard: a pretence which &s;erved only to inflame the re&s;entment of the people, who thought it very &s;trange, that the queen &s;hould be &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed for that which was rather maternal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> weakne&s;s than any premeditated crime. Be&s;ides, they could not comprehend the meaning of Henry's having &s;o long delayed to take cognizance of this af|fair: they thought his marrying the daughter was an acknowledgment of the mother's innocence, or at lea&s;t, a tacit forgivene&s;s of the fault. They con&s;i|dered that &s;he had been one of the chief in&s;truments of his elevation to the throne, and therefore could not help dete&s;ting his ingratitude; and, in this rigorous treatment, they perceived a formed de&s;ign to &s;eize all opportunities of completing the ruin of the hou&s;e of York, and its adherents. There was &s;ome my&s;tery in this confinement of the queen-mother, which never was ex|plained to the public. As all hi&s;torians agree, that &s;he was certainly concerned in the affair of Simnel, the king, in all probability, could have convicted her in a legal manner of the con&s;piracy; or at lea&s;t fixed upon her &s;uch &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, as would have given a plau&s;ible colour to the &s;teps he took for &s;ecur|ing her per&s;on. But, &s;uch a proce&s;s would have introduced an inquiry, which he &s;eemed to avoid. Perhaps, it would have appeared, that the queen-mother had not complied with Richard's de&s;ire in &s;ending her daughters to court, un|til he had taken &s;ome extraordinary &s;tep to quiet her fears. Perhaps, that &s;a|tisfaction con&s;i&s;ted in his conniving at the e&s;cape of his &s;urviving nephew from the Tower. By means of this conjecture we can account for the queen's con|fidence in the tyrant, who had brought her kindred to the &s;caffold, as well as for Henry's behaviour at this juncture, when, perhaps, &s;he played off the phan|tom Simnel, in order to &s;ound the inclination of the people, and pave the way for exhibiting her own &s;on upon the &s;tage. This &s;uppo&s;ition likewi&s;e explains the ca&s;e of Perkin Warbeck, and the inflexibility of Henry, who could never be pre|vailed upon to relea&s;e his mother-in-law, tho' the whole nation clamoured at her impri&s;onment, which continued for &s;ome years, until death &s;et her at liberty.</P>

<P>The queen being &s;ecured in the mona&s;tery of Bermond&s;ey, Henry, in order to undeceive the populace, who began to believe, that the earl of War|wick was actually in Ireland, ordered that young prince to be conducted pub|licly through the &s;treets of London, from the Tower to St. Paul's church, whither the people went in va&s;t crouds to behold him; and he was permitted to conve$&s;e with &s;everal individuals, who were well acquainted with his per&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$$.</NOTE> and well aff$cted to his family. After this proce&s;&s;ion$ he was &s;ent back to the Tower; but, the I$i&s;h retorted the impo&s;ture upon Henry, affirming, that the youth whom he had produced was a counterfeit; and that Simnel was the true earl of Warwick. The king fearing the contagion would &s;pread into England, publi&s;hed a general amne&s;ty for tho&s;e who &s;hould quit the party of the rebels, with promi&s;e of reward to &s;uch as &s;hould come and di&s;cover the particulars of the co$&s;piracy. At the &s;ame time, he ordered the coa&s;ts to be guarded, to cut off all c$rre&s;pondence between the malecontents of the two kingdoms. Notwith&s;tanding all his precautions, the pretender acquired &s;ome powerful

friends in England; or rather, the prie&s;t who tutored Simnel, had been encou|raged by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality, to produce this impo&s;tor, whom he would have hardly pre&s;umed to exhibit without &s;ome promi&s;e of con&s;ider|able &s;upport. He no &s;ooner made his appearance in Ireland, than John earl of Lincoln, whom his uncle Richard III. had declared pre&s;umptive heir of the crown, openly e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, and embarked for Flanders, in order to con|cert with his aunt Margaret dutche&s;s dowager of Burgundy, the proper mea&s;ures for in&s;uring &s;ucce&s;s to this enterprize. That prince&s;s being incen&s;ed at Henry's behaviour to her niece, and the virulence with which he per&s;ecuted all$ the par|ti&s;ans of the hou&s;e of York, readily$ engaged in the &s;cheme of Simnel, which in all probability had been projected with her privity and concurrence; and after having deliberated with Lincoln and Lovel, promi&s;ed to furni&s;h two thou&s;and veteran German troops, commanded by Martin Swart, an officer of reputation, which &s;hould accompany them to Ireland, and join the new king's party. They<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> ceremony being performed with a crown taken from a &s;tatue of the Virgin Mary, the new king a&s;&s;embled a kind of parliament, in which the clergy granted a &s;ub&s;idy to the pope, in hope of rendering his holine&s;s propitious to their undertaking. Then a council was held, to regulate the mea&s;ures to be next pur&s;ued; and after &s;ome debate they agreed, that the &s;eat of the war &s;hould be transferred to England, where they expected to be joined by all the favourers of the hou&s;e of York, &s;o as to be able to depo&s;e the u&s;urper without the lea&s;t difficulty.</P>

<P>In the mean time, Henry was employed in making preparations to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the impending &s;torm. He was no &s;ooner in|formed of Lincoln's retreat to Flanders, than he took it for granted that the dutche&s;s of Burgundy was concerned in the con&s;piracy, and was the more alarmed as he knew the enterprizing di&s;po&s;ition of that prince&s;s, who&s;e hatred he had incurred. He forthwith levied two armies, the command of which he be&s;towed upon the duke of Bedford and the earl of Oxford, in order to guard both &s;ides of the i&s;land from inva&s;ion; and during the winter he made a progre&s;s in per&s;on to the counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, where he had mo&s;t rea&s;on to expect a de&s;cent, on account of their neighbourhood to the Low Coun|tries. When he arrived at St. Edmund&s;bury, he received intimation that the marquis of Dor&s;et was on the road to vi&s;it him, that he might vindicate him|&s;elf from &s;ome malicious imputations, and offer his &s;ervice to his maje&s;ty: but, Henry, in&s;tead of accepting his offer, &s;ent the earl of Oxford to meet and conduct him pri&s;oner to the Tower, tho' he was de&s;ired to a&s;&s;ure the marquis, that, after the extinction of the rebellion, he &s;hould have a fair hearing; and, that his pre&s;ent arre&s;t would conduce to his own &s;afety, by hindering him from being mi&s;led by evil coun&s;ellors. From Edmund&s;bury the king repaired to Norwich, where he kept his Chri&s;tmas, thence he proceeded in pilgrimage to vi&s;it our Lady's church of Wal&s;ingham; and then returned by the way of Cambridge to London. Here he learned, that the earl of Lincoln with his foreign auxiliaries had landed in Ireland: &s;o that being &s;reed from his appre|hen&s;ion of a de&s;cent from Flanders, he a&s;&s;embled all his troops in the neighbour|hood

<P>He had not remained long in this &s;ituation, when he was informed that Simnel and his friends were landed in Lanca&s;hire, and joined by Sir Tho|mas Broughton, and a &s;mall number of Engli&s;h malecontents. They had be|gun their march towards York, in hope of &s;eeing their numbers daily increa&s;e; and they forbore all acts of ho&s;tility in the country through which they pa&s;&s;ed, with a view to intere&s;t the people in their favour. They were, however, mi&s;erably di&s;appointed in their expectation. The natives, either dreading the $agacity and fortune of Henry, or aver&s;e to a king introduced by the Iri&s;h and Ger|mans, f$r from taking arms in his favour, exhibited no marks of good will to the enterprize; and the earl of Lincoln $earing that his army, con&s;i&s;ting of eight thou$and men, would rather dimini&s;h than increa&s;e, re&s;olved to give battle to the king before all his reinforcements &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled. For this purpo&s;e, he changed his rou$e, and marched towards Newark, in hope of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that place before the arrival of the enemy. Henry had advanced to No$$ingham, at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and men; and being joined by an equal number, under the command of the earl of Shrew&s;bury, the lord Strange, with a con&s;iderable number of knights and gentlemen; he, with the advice of his council, determined to engage the rebels without delay. Gue&s;&s;ing Lincoln's de&s;ign upon the town of Newark, he marched thither with great expedition, and po&s;ted him&s;elf between the enemy and the town, while the earl of Lincoln encamped on the declivity of a hill near the village of Stoke. Next day, being the &s;ixth of June, Henry drew up his army in order of battle upon the plain, which was &s;o narrow, that he could not extend his front; and, therefore he was obliged to form his troops into three lines, placing his be&s;t men in the fir&s;t, to the number of &s;ix thou&s;and. The enemy did not decline the en|gagement; on the contrary, they marched down in order, and attacked the royali&s;ts with great intrepidity, hoping, that &s;hould they be able to break the king's fir&s;t line, it would fall back on the other two, and put the whole army in confu&s;ion. The naked Iri&s;h, tho' terribly galled by the Engli&s;h arrows, maintained their ground without flinching; and the German troops being well di&s;ciplined and inured to war, fought with great ob&s;tinacy for three hours &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> until by far the greater part was &s;lain, with Martin Swart their leader. The earls of Lincoln and Kildare met with the &s;ame fate; and their army was to|tally routed, with the lo&s;s of four thou&s;and men killed upon the field of battle. Nor was the victory cheaply purcha&s;ed by the king, one half of who&s;e fir&s;t line was cut in pieces. Lambert Simnel and his tutor were taken pri&s;oners; and Henry affected to de&s;pi&s;e his rival &s;o much, that he would not deprive him of his life; but, retained him as a &s;cullion in his kitchen, from which low &s;tation he was afterwards promoted to the place of a falconer. Simons the prie&s;t was committed to pri&s;on, and never heard of after his commitment. The lord Lovel is by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed to have been drowned in the Trent, endeavouring to ford that river after the battle; others affirm he was &s;lain in the action; and a third &s;et believe he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his life in a vault or cavern <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This la$$ $otion is $word$ by a di&s;co|very made abo$$ $ixty years ago at this noble|$an's $eat of Min$$er-Lovel in Oxford&s;hire.

<P>Immediately after the battle, the king marched to Lincoln, from whence he advanced to York; and, in this progre&s;s &s;everely puni&s;hed all tho&s;e who had favoured the rebels, or were convicted of having circulated a report, that the king's army was defeated: a report which had hindered &s;ome powerful &s;uccours from joining Henry before the battle. Tho&s;e delinquents were tried partly by commi&s;&s;ioners, and partly by martial law; but, the puni&s;hment fell upon their e&s;tates only, the king being &s;atisfied with filling his coffers by fines and con$i&s;cations. When he had fleeced the malecontents in this manner, he procured a bull from the pope, impowering the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to ab&s;olve them of the excommunication they had incurred by the former bull of &s;ettlement, as if he had been &s;ollicitous about the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who &s;ought his ruin. At the &s;ame time, Innocent VIII. &s;ent over another bull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pu$$</NOTE> re&s;training the privilege of &s;anctuaries within proper bounds. He ordained, that malefactors who had quitted the &s;anctuary to commit fre&s;h crimes, and returned again to it for $helter, might be forcibly taken from it by the king's officers: that, with re&s;pect to debtors who took &s;anctuary, in order to defraud their creditors, the privilege &s;hould extend to their per&s;ons only, and not to their e&s;tates; and that the king might &s;ent guards into the &s;anctuary, to prevent the e&s;cape of traitors and rebels. While Henry re&s;ided at York, deputies ar|rived from Scotland, to terminate &s;ome difference concerning the fi&s;hery of the river E&s;k; and the king took this opportunity of beginning a negotiation with James the Scotti&s;h monarch, to who&s;e court he &s;ent Fox bi&s;hop of Exeter, and Sir Richard Edgecomb, as his amba&s;&s;adors, to treat of a triple alliance. The treaty was projected, and they agreed to the following articles: That the Scotti&s;h marquis of Ormond &s;hould marry Catherine daughter of the fourth Edward: That James him&s;elf &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e Edward's widow: That his &s;on the prince of Scotland &s;hould be matched with another daughter of that mo|narch: That the king of England &s;hould cede for ever the town and ca$tle of Berwick to the Scots: That the articles and conditions of tho&s;e three mar|riages &s;hould be regulated by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the two kings, to be a&s;|&s;embled at Edinburgh, fir&s;t in January, and then in May: That the two kings &s;hould have an interview in the month of July: and, That the truce &s;hould be prolonged for thirteen months. Henry ratified the&s;e conventions on the twen|tieth day of November: but, the execution of the treaty was prevented by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ryme$.</NOTE> troubles that en&s;ued in Scotland.</P>

<P>The king in his journey to the North had occa&s;ion to perceive, that the di&s;contents of the people proceeded in a great mea&s;ure from his &s;everity to the parti&s;ans of the hou&s;e of York, and in particular, to his having &s;o long delayed the queen's coronation. He therefore re&s;olved to remove this &s;ubject of complaint. About the beginning of November he returned to London, which he entered in triumph; and next day went in proce&s;&s;ion to St. Paul's church, where Te Deum was &s;ung for the victory he had obtained over the rebels. Then he appointed the duke of Bedford high &s;teward for the corona|tion of the queen, which was performed with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities, on the twenty-fifth day of November, two years after her marriage. Upon this oc|ca&s;ion, he &s;et at liberty the marquis of Dor&s;et, without having brought him to any trial; and towards the latter end of the year, &s;ent a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y to

<P>The war &s;till continued in the Low Countries, where the troops of Charles VIII. &s;urprized St. Omer and Terouenne, and the inhabitants of Ghent were incited by a nobleman, called Raffingham, to revolt again&s;t Maximilian. By this time Francis II. duke of Britanny, was old, infirm, and at certain times deprived of his &s;en&s;es: having no &s;ons, he, with the con&s;ent of his e&s;tates, &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion upon his two daughters, Anne and I&s;abel, which la&s;t died before her father; &s;o that Anne became &s;ole heire&s;s of Bretagne. Charles VIII. was de&s;irous of uniting that dutchy with France, by marrying this prince&s;s; but his views were thwarted by Lewis duke of Orleans, whom he had per&s;ecuted at the in&s;tigation of his &s;i&s;ter Madam de Beaujeu, and compelled to fly for &s;helter into Britanny, where he met with a very ho&s;pitable reception, and gained an a&s;cendancy over Francis. This prince being incen&s;ed again&s;t his own nobility, who had put his favourite Landa$s to death, gladly entertained the duke o$ Or|leans, with the prince of Orange, the count de Dunois, and &s;ome other French noblemen of that party; and the lords of Bretagne entered into a negotiation with Charles, though their motives were very different from tho&s;e by which the Fre$ch king was actuated when he concluded the alliance. He thought the treaty would furni&s;h him with an opportunity to make a compleat conque&s;t of Bretagne, while they hoped his protection would &s;creen them from the re&s;ent|ment and arbitrary de&s;igns of their own &s;overeign. In pur&s;uance of this treaty, Charles invaded Britanny with &s;ix different armies; and the duke, retiring to Mal$troit, a&s;&s;embled &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, with whom he began his march, to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentr&eacute;.</NOTE> rai&s;e the &s;$$ge of P$oermel, which the enemy had undertaken; but, as he ad|vanced, he found him&s;elf abandoned by all his forces, except about four thou|&s;and; and retreated with great precipitation to Nantz, which was be&s;ieged by the French after they had reduced Ploermel, Vannes, and Dinant$ The duke had commi&s;&s;ioned the count de Dunois, as his amba&s;&s;ador, to &s;ollicit &s;uccours of the king of England; and that nobleman had embarked four different times on this emba&s;&s;y, but was always driven back by contrary winds or tempe&s;tuous weather.</P>

<P>While Charles was employed in the &s;iege of Nantz he received ad|vice of the victory which Henry had obtained at Stokefield, and immediately di&s;patched amba&s;&s;adors to congratulate him upon his good fortune, and endeavour to di&s;&s;uad$ him from intermeddling in the affairs of Bretagne. They found him at Leice&s;ter, where they were admitted to an audience; in which, after the compliments of congratulation, they ob&s;erved that the king their $overeign found him&s;elf obliged to engage in a war with the duke of Bri|tanny, who had given protection to the duke of Orleans, the declared enemy of Charles; and even a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in exciting$ $oubles in the kingdom of France: that therefore the duke of Britanny was in effect the aggre&s;&s;or; and the French king hoped, from the equity of Henry, that he would con&s;ider him in no other light. That, although the king had formerly lain under &s;ome obligations to the duke of Britanny, he would likewi&s;e remember the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he h$d received from the French monarch, at a time when the duke had not only abandoned his intere&s;t, but even agreed to deliver him into the hands of his enemy. For which rea&s;ons, Charles hoped the king of Eng|land$
<PB N="485" REF="4950">
far from engaging in the defence of the duke of Britanny, who protected and encouraged the rebellious &s;ubjects of his neighbour prince, would e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;t of his real friend, or at lea&s;t ob&s;erve an exact neutrality. Henry was not ignorant of the de&s;ign with which Charles had taken the field; but, as the French amba&s;&s;adors had carefully avoided touching upon their ma&s;ter's real &s;cheme of reuniting Britanny to the kingdom of France, he di&s;&s;embled in his turn, and replied, That as the French king and the duke of Britanny were the two princes to whom he was more obliged than to all the world be&s;ides, he longed for an opportunity of manife&s;ting his gratitude to both. He &s;aid he would, upon this occa&s;ion, fulfil the duty of a real friend, and endeavour to compromi&s;e their difference in an amicable manner. He did not imagine that Bretagne would be ea&s;ily conquered. He did not doubt that Charles would accept of his mediation rather than incur his re&s;entment; and he fore&s;aw that this affair would furni&s;h him with a pretence for demanding a &s;ub&s;idy, which he &s;hould have no occa&s;ion to expend.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the&s;e &s;entiments he di&s;patched amba&s;&s;adors with offers of his mediation to king Charles; and, &s;hould the&s;e be accepted, they were ordered to proceed to the duke of Bretagne with the &s;ame propo&s;al. Charles was then employed in the &s;iege of Nantz; and, as it was his intere&s;t to amu&s;e Henry until the place &s;hould be taken, he not only accepted his mediation, but al&s;o offered to &s;ubmit the di&s;pute to his final deci&s;ion; hoping either that the duke of Britanny would reject the arbitration, or that the negotiation might be &s;pun out until he &s;hould be ma&s;ter of the dutchy. When the Engli&s;h am|ba&s;&s;adors propo&s;ed their ma&s;ter's mediation to the duke, who was be&s;ieged in Nantz, the duke of Orleans replied, in the name of that prince, that in &s;uch a perilous conjuncture, he expected &s;ub&s;tantial a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the king of Eng|land, rather than offers of mediation, which could not prevent the lo&s;s of his dominions: he de&s;ired their king would remember the benefits he had receiv|ed from the duke of Britanny, and con&s;ider how much it imported England to hinder that dutchy from becoming a province of France. With this an|&s;wer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentr&eacute;.</NOTE> the amba&s;&s;adors were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and Charles triumphed greatly in his affected moderation. Mean while he carried on his attacks with &s;uch vigour, that the place mu&s;t have been &s;urrendered, had not the count de Dunoi$ a&s;&s;embled a great multitude of pea&s;ants, who were anxious about the fate of their &s;overeign, and relieved the town in the face of the French army. This &s;upply obliged Charles to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and Henry being now fully per&s;uaded that the French king would not be able to conquer Britanny, re&s;olved to con|tinue neuter; but at the &s;ame time affected to intere&s;t him&s;elf warmly in the duke's favour, that he might have a pretext for demanding a &s;ub&s;idy from the parliament which he had convoked for the ninth day of November.

as a clande&s;tine tran$action, Charles was &s;atisfied, becau&s;e it was not his intere&s;t to break with the king of England at &s;uch a juncture; for by this time the noblemen of Britanny, perceiving the intention of the French king was to make a conque&s;t of their country, had made peace with their &s;overeign, who could not however prevent Charles from taking the town of Dol by a&s;&s;ault; &s;o that the duke, thinking him&s;elf un&s;afe at Nantz, retired to Rennes, in hope of being &s;uccoured by &s;ome of his allies: there finding him&s;elf hard pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy, and &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be per&s;uaded by the prince of Orange to promi&s;e he would be&s;tow his daugh|ter Anne in marriage upon the king of the Romans; and that prince engaged to bring a powerful army into Bretagne; but he was prevented by the revolt of Ghent, which employed all his forces in Flanders.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions on the continent, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors returned to London, and reported to Henry that the intention of Charles was to amu&s;e him with a negotiation until Bretagn$ &s;hould be conquered. The parliament meeting at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened with a &s;peech by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, chancellor of the realm, who, in the king's name, having thanked the two hou&s;es for the acts they had pa&s;&s;ed in his ta|vour at their la&s;t $itting, gave them to under&s;tand, that with re&s;pect to the war between France and Bret$gne, Charles had de&s;ired he would ob&s;erve a neu|trality, and the duke had &s;ollicited his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: that he had offered his media|tion, which was accepted by the French king, on condition that he &s;hould not di&s;continue ho&s;tilities, until the difference &s;hould be compromi&s;ed; but that this condition was rejected by the duke of Britanny, who di&s;tru&s;ted the $$ncerity of Charles, and ob&s;erved that his aim was to &s;pin out the negotiation until the dutchy &s;hould be &s;ubdued: that after having ineffectually employed $is be&s;t offices to terminate the di&s;pute by an accommodation, he begged the advice of his parliament; and de&s;ired they would con&s;ider whether or not he ought to interpo&s;e more effectual mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of Bretaghe. This was a que&s;tion that required very little con&s;ideration: the Engli&s;h were too jealous of the power of France to &s;tand $amely, and &s;ee it augmented by the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a maritime province, which they coun&s;elled the king to defend with all his might; and that he might be enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t the duke effectually, they granted a &s;upply of two fifteenths, be&s;ides a poll tax upon aliens, and ano|ther act of re&s;umption. In this &s;e&s;&s;ion they confirmed the authority of the Star|chamber, a court which had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the antient common laws of the realm. It con&s;i&s;ted of the members of the king's council, who &s;at in an apartment called the Star-chamber, to judge offences u$der the degree of capital. The parliament likewi&s;e enacted a &s;tatute, by which any &s;ervant of the king, under the degree of a nobleman, con&s;piring the death of any member of the council, or lord of the realm, &s;hould be deemed guilty of a capital crime.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$$on.

Another &s;tatute ordained that clerks convicted &s;hould be burned in the hand, for a ta&s;te of puni&s;hment and brand of infamy, from which they had been hi|therto exempted.

<P>Henry having accompli&s;hed his aim, which was a &s;ub&s;idy, in&s;tead of employing it in vigorous mea&s;ures, re&s;umed the method of negotiation, and &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors again to Charles, to make him acquainted with the re&s;olution of the parliament. The French king, who was no &s;tranger to Henry's &s;enti|ments and di&s;po&s;ition, &s;till continued to amu&s;e him by declaring him&s;elf ready to abide by the deci&s;ion of the king of England; but he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to interrupt his operations, alledging that &s;uch interruption would enable his ad|v$r&s;ary to retrieve his affairs: neverthele&s;s the duke of Bretagne gained by the approach of winter what he could not obtain by Henry's &s;ollicitations. The king of France was obliged to put his troops in quarters, and return to Paris: while the duke not only enjoyed a re&s;pite, but, by the valour and activity of the mare&s;chal Rieux, retook Vannes and Dinan, in the month of March, and &s;ecu|red<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1488.</NOTE> Ancennis and Chateaubriant with &s;trong garri&s;ons: at the &s;ame time a &s;mall body of men at arms, belonging to the lord of Albret, de&s;erted the &s;ervice of France, and joined the duke of Britanny. This &s;mile of fortune was of &s;hort<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> duration: in the month of April Charles began the campaign, retook and de|moli&s;hed Ancennis and Chateaubriant, and at one time inve&s;ted Fougeres and St. Aubin de Cormier. In the beginning of the war the duke of Bretagne had endeavoured to detach the lord of Albret from the intere&s;t of France, by promi&s;ing to give him his daughter in marriage; and now that nobleman em|bracing the propo&s;al, joined him with a body of a thou&s;and hor&s;e, in expecta|tion of &s;eeing his promi&s;e immediately fulfilled. Francis, who had in private betrothed his daughter to Maximilian, tutored the prince&s;s, who was about eleven years of age, to expre&s;s a per&s;onal aver&s;ion to the match; and this &s;erved as a pretence for delaying the marriage. Mean while, finding him&s;elf a$$$gether unable to cope with the French, and being di&s;appointed in his expectations from Henry and the king of the Romans, he &s;ent the count de Dunois to &s;ollicit Charles for peace. That king was then engaged in a private negotiation for a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> truce with the king of England; and therefore deferred giving a po&s;itive an&s;wer, on various pretences, until he received advice that the treaty was concluded at Wind&s;or: then having nothing to fear from Henry, he rejected the duke's propo&s;als, and re&s;olved to continue the war until he &s;hould have made an in|tire conque&s;t of the dutchy. The duke's affairs being now de&s;perate, his chief coun&s;ellors, the duke of Orleans, the prince of Orange, and the ma$echal Rieux, re&s;olved to make one vigorous effort, by giving battle to the enemy. With this view they marched towards St. Aubin, which had capitulated before they ar|rived; and the French army being reunited under the command of Lewis de la Tremouille, a battle en&s;ued on the twenty-eighth day of July, when the forces of Britanny were rou$ed with great &s;laughter: the duke of Orleans and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argentr$.</NOTE> the prince of Orange, who fought on foot, were taken pri&s;oners, and the lord Wideville was &s;lain, with all his followers.</P>

<P>While the duke of Bretagne thus precipitated his own ruin, the king of England made his di&s;tre&s;s a pretext for levying the &s;ub&s;idy with the ut|mo&s;t expedition; and all the counties payed it without murmuring, except the inhabitants of York&s;hire and the bi&s;hopric of Durham, who, as old par|ti&s;an$

of the hou&s;e of York, hated Henry, and refu&s;ed to comply with the con|ditions of the tax, which they &s;aid was a grievous oppre&s;&s;ion. The commi&s;|&s;ioners, being thus repul&s;ed, addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the earl of Northumber|land, who wrote to court for directions; and the king in&s;i&s;ted peremptorily on their paying their proportion of the &s;ub&s;idy which had been granted by par|liament; ob&s;erving that the affairs of Bretagne were very pre&s;&s;ing; and that, &s;hould he relinqui&s;h his right on this occa&s;ion, other counties would be en|couraged to claim the &s;ame exemption. The earl no &s;ooner received this an|&s;wer, than he a&s;&s;embled the ju&s;tices and freeholders of the county, and &s;igni|fied his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure in &s;uch imperious terms, as not only confirmed them in their re&s;olution to refu&s;e payment, but al&s;o excited their re&s;entment again&s;t the earl, whom they con&s;idered as the per&s;on who had fomented the king's in|dignation. Thus in&s;tigated, the populace immmediately a&s;&s;embled, and, break|ing into his hou&s;e, &s;lew him with a good number of his &s;ervants. They were ani|mated by a popular incendiary called John a Chamber, and choo&s;ing for their leader Sir John Egremont, a very turbulent parti&s;an of the hou&s;e of York, they avo$ed their rebellion; declaring they would march to London, and give battle to Henry. The news of this in&s;urrection did not much alarm the king, though $e forthwith &s;ent a body of troops again&s;t the rebels, under the com|mand of the earl of Surrey, whom he had relea&s;ed from the Tower, and ad|mitted into his favour. That nobleman, engaging the in&s;urgents, routed them at the fir&s;t on&s;et, and made John a Chamber pri&s;oner; but Sir John Egre|mont e&s;caped, and, cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea, took refuge with the dutche&s;s dowager of Burgu$dy. The king, who followed the earl of Surrey with another body of troops, proceeded in his progre&s;s northward as far as York, where he ordered John a Chamber to be hanged, with a great number of his accomplices, and granted a general pardon to the re&s;t of the rebels. Having con&s;tituted the earl S$rrey his lieutenant in the northern parts, and appointed Sir Richard Tun|$tall his pri$cipal commi&s;&s;ioner for levying the &s;ub&s;idy, he returned to London, where he was &s;urprized with the tidings of the duke of Bretagne's being de|feated at St. Aubin.</P>

<P>That prince was now reduced to a deplorable condition: he had nothing to expect from Henry but frui$le&s;s negotiations. Maximilian, in&s;tead of &s;uccouring his future father-in-law, was him&s;elf impri&s;oned by the Flemings at Bruges, and remained in confinement until his father Frederick, the empe|ror, marched into the Low Countries at the head of a numerous army to his re|lief. He was &s;o intent upon fortifying him&s;elf again&s;t the mutinous &s;pirit of the Flemings, that, forgetting all his engagements with the duke of Britanny, he &s;ent an emb$&s;&s;y into Spain to demand of Ferdinand and his queen their elde&s;t da$ghter I&s;abel for him&s;elf, and the younger infanta Jane for his &s;on Philip: the former was already promi&s;ed to the prince of Portugal, but the &s;econd part of his propo&s;al took effect in the &s;equel. Mean while Philip de Cleves, lord of Raven&s;tein, being cho&s;en general by the inhabitants of Ghent, &s;urprized the city of Bru&s;&s;els; and Maximilian retired to Germany, leaving Albert duke of S$xony to comma$d for his &s;on Philip in the Low Countries. The duke of Britanny, being thus abandoned by all the world, $ued for peace in the mo&s;t $umble ma$$er; and found Ch$rles very well di&s;po&s;ed to grant his reque&s;t. That politic monarch, though he h$d co$cluded a truce with Henry, perceived

<P>Immediately after the ratification of this treaty, Francis II. duke of Britanny died in a very old age, leaving his daughter Anne under the tuition of the marechal de Rieux and the count de Cominge: but Philip de Mon|tauban chancellor of the dutchy carried the young prince&s;s to Guerande, where he made u&s;e of her name and authority to cloak his own de&s;igns; and his influence with her produced a quarrel between him and the m$rechal, which proved very detrimental to her own intere&s;t, as well as to that of her &s;ubjects. The king of England, being informed of the duke's death, declared openly that he would con&s;ider the intere&s;t of the orphan dutche&s;s as his own, and af|fected to make preparations for &s;uccouring her in the mo&s;t effectual manner. As the late treaty between France and Brittany was provi&s;ional, until the pre|ten&s;ions of Charles to the &s;overeignty of that dutchy could be regulated, Hen|ry's aim was to hinder the French king from taking the advantage of the duke's death, and the con&s;ternation of the Bretons. He thought this purpo&s;e would be an&s;wered by his openly e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of the dutche&s;s; that Charles, rather than come to an open rupture with England, would abate in his preten|&s;ions; that he him&s;elf would be cho&s;en umpire of the difference, and con&s;e|quently avoid a war which would oblige him to empty his coffers. In order to intimidate the French king, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the king of the Romans and his &s;on Philip the archduke, and di&s;patched envoys to the kings of Spain and Portugal, as if he intended to form a league again&s;t Charles, whom, by a third emba&s;&s;y, he pre&s;&s;ed to fini&s;h all difference with Bretagne by a new treaty; at the &s;ame time, he &s;ent Edgecomb and Henry Ay$e&s;worth with offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the young dutche&s;s, and powers to engage in his name for a certain number of troops, on &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for a reimbur&s;ement of the expence. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE></P>

<P>The affairs of Britanny engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the kings of England and France to &s;uch a degree, that they neglected &s;ending &s;uccours to their ally James III. king of Scotland, who&s;e nobles, with his &s;on at their head, had ri&s;en in rebellion. He had retired to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and &s;olli|cited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Charles and Henry, who promi&s;ed to &s;end forces to his aid; but his friends advi&s;ed him to remove to the ca&s;tle of Stirling, which he would find more commodious for receiving the &s;uccours he expected from abroad. In compliance with this advice, he quitted Edinburgh, and marched with a &s;mall body of troops to Stirling, where he was refu&s;ed admittance by the governor. He then endeavoured to return to the place from which he had departed; but was prevented by the rebellious noblemen who had engaged him at Bannockburn, where he was defeated and &s;lain. His &s;on James, at that time but fifteen years of age, was proclaimed king of Scotland on the field of battle by the victors; and in the month of July &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Henry, to notify his acce&s;&s;ion to the Scotti&s;h throne. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucha$$$.</NOTE></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> On the tenth day of February, the Engli&s;h envoys concluded a treaty with the dutche&s;s of Bretagne, by which Henry engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t her with a reinforcement of &s;ix thou&s;and men, on condition of being put in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of certain places, by way of &s;ecurity for the expence of this armament: &s;o that by this negotiation he provided for the &s;afety of Bretagne, without ex|pending any part of the money he had received from parliament; on the con|trary, he contrived a method $or laying it out to the be&s;t advantage; for by re|taining the &s;ecurities, he found means to be repayed with intere&s;t. The dutche&s;s was glad to receive the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England upon any terms. She &s;aw a French army in the heart of her dominions: &s;he found her&s;elf without troops and money; and her principal &s;ubjects were divided among them&s;elves, by the mo&s;t rancorous feuds and factions.

Philip in$inuated that he was a creature of the king of France, by who&s;e direction he wanted to effect a marriage be|tween her and the lord of Albret, a nobleman un&s;upported by any alliance, who would not be able to protect her dominions.

<P>The Engli&s;h troops being landed in Brittany in the month of March, the French king began to think that Henry intended to act with vi|gour in defence of the dutche&s;s; and from the emba&s;&s;ies to &s;o many different powers, he no longer doubted that his aim was to form a powerful confederacy again&s;t France. By the mediation of the German princes, a&s;&s;embled at Franck|$ort, a treaty was brought upon the anvil, for a pacification between him and Maximilian, as well as between Maximilian and the Flemings. He had in his power Margaret daughter of the king of the Romans, whom by treaty he was obliged to marry, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould be of age; and he was entirely ig|norant of the private contract between the late duke of Bretagne and Maximi|lian, touching the marriage of the duke's daughter. He therefore did not doubt, that his future father-in-law would be favourable to his intere&s;t; and in this opinion propo&s;ed to the dutche&s;s Anne, that their difference &s;hould be le$t to the arbitration of Maximilian. Her mini&s;try joyfully embraced this propo|&s;al, in full confidence that &s;he would be favoured by a prince de&s;tined to be her hu&s;band; and the king of the Romans was very well plea&s;ed with this oppor|tunity of acting as umpire, in an affair that &s;o nearly concerned his own intere&s;t. The envoys of the two parties a&s;&s;embling at Franckfort, &s;oon concluded, under Maximilian's arbitration, a provi&s;ional treaty, importing, That Charles &s;hould re&s;tore all the places he had conquered in Brittany, except Dinan, St. Aubin, Fougeres, and St. Malo, which &s;hould be depo&s;ited in the hands of Maximilian and the duke of Bourbon; and that the French troops &s;hould evacuate all the other parts of the dutchy: That Anne &s;hould &s;end back the Engli&s;h troops: That in April of the &s;ucceeding year, a congre&s;s &s;hould be held at Tournay, where all differences &s;hould be determined; and, in the mean time, the parties

&s;hould &s;end their rea&s;ons to Avignon, to be examined and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by civilians, that their opinions might &s;erve as in&s;tructions to their mediators. Though the articles of this treaty were agreeable to both parties, it proved ineffectual. The places which Anne had delivered by way of &s;ecurity to Henry, were garri&s;oned by five hundred Engli&s;h troops; and though the other auxiliaries of that na|tion returned to their own country after the treaty with France, the&s;e five hun|dred would not quit Brittany until the king of England &s;hould be reimbur&s;ed; a condition which the dutche&s;s could not $ulfil.

He was per&s;uaded that Charles dreaded his junction with the dutche&s;s &s;o much, that he would not only be glad to embrace equitable propo&s;als of peace, but even to purcha&s;e it at any price he &s;hould think proper to impo&s;e: in this opinion he ordered his amba&s;&s;adors to demand the arrears of the pen&s;ion which Lewis XI. had agreed to pay to Edward IV. by the treaty of Pequigny. In the mean time, he appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the envoys from Britanny; and the whole re&s;ult of the negotiation was a further &s;ecurity for the money he had already di&s;bur&s;ed. With re&s;pect to the &s;uccours &s;he demanded, there was no article in the treaty. He confined him&s;elf to verbal promi&s;es, that he would never abandon the dutche&s;s. Imagining that Charles was &s;incerely de&s;irous of peace, he thought &s;uch &s;uccours were altogether unnece&s;&s;ary: but having &s;till an eye to the reimbur&s;ement of his money, he demanded that the town of Nantz &s;hould be put into his power, on pretence that it was in danger of falling into the hands of the French; and he promi&s;ed faithfully to re&s;tore it on the fir&s;t requi&s;ition. Before he could gain this point, however, the lord of Albret, having re&s;igned all hope of e&s;pou&s;ing the dutche&s;s, &s;urprized that rich city, and embraced the French party. Charles mean while amu&s;ed the Engli&s;h amba&s;|&s;adors with eva&s;ive profe&s;&s;ions, in order to gain time, that he might be able to terminate the war to his own advantage, without referring the di&s;pute to Henry, who&s;e arbitration he had no mind to adopt.</P>

<P>During the&s;e negotiations, the duke of Saxony, who commanded in the Low-Countries in the name of Maximilian, publi&s;hed an edict touching the coin, to which the inhabitants of Bruges refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit; and tho&s;e of Ghent joined in their revolt. The king of France, who&s;e con&s;tant aim was to &s;oment dome&s;tic troubles in the dominions of his neighbours, &s;ent &s;uccours to the r$bels, under the command of marechal D$&s;querdes governor of Picardy; and, on the other hand, Maximilian &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Henry to form a<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> league again&s;t Charles. The king of England, piqued at the indifference with which his amba&s;&s;adors were treated in France, and unwilling to &s;ee the arch|duke oppre&s;&s;ed by his own &s;ubjects, &s;ent a reinforcement of a thou&s;and men to Calais; and ordered the lord Daubigney, governor of that fortre&s;s, to march to the relief of Dixmuyd, which the Flemings, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French, had inve&s;ted, after having taken Ypres and Sluys.

This affair produced great coldne&s;s between the kings of France and England; but Charles dur&s;t not complain, becau&s;e Henry had as good a right to &s;upport the &s;overeign as he had to a&s;&s;i&s;t the rebellious &s;ubjects. The Engli&s;h monarch, finding Charles &s;till more and more aver&s;e to an accom|modation with the dutche&s;s of Bretagne, thought proper to take &s;uch public $word$ as would intimidate that prince into more pacific re&s;olutions. In the beginning of the year he had renewed the treaties of alliance with Portugal and Denmark. In September, he concluded with Maximilian and his &s;on Philip a league again&s;t France, for their mutual defence and that of the dutche&s;s of Brit|tany. At the &s;ame time he publi&s;hed a treaty concluded with Ferdinand and I&s;abella &s;overeigns of Spain; by which the two parties engaged to maintain a war again&s;t France, until Charles &s;hould have re&s;to$ed Rou&s;&s;illon to Ferdinand, and Guienne and Nor$$ndy to Henry. They likewi&s;e agreed that Arthur prince of Wales &s;hould wed Catherine infanta of Spain, as &s;oon as the parties<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> &s;hould be marriageable. The league with the king of the Romans referred to this treaty; and tho&s;e three princes engaged to invade France at one time, each at the head of a &s;eparate army, to act for the intere&s;t of the alliance, and the defence of the dutche&s;s of B$etagne. This league, however, was no more than a bugbear, rai&s;ed to terrify Charles into pacific mea&s;ures. It was with the &s;ame view, that Henry concluded a treaty of alliance with John Galeazo duke of Milan. Nor was this artifice altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful. The French king began to be afraid of a league, which would not only interrupt him in the conque&s;t of Bretagne, but al&s;o baffle tho&s;e de&s;igns which he had for &s;ome time meditated upon the kingdom of Naples This apprehen&s;ion hindered him from recommencing ho&s;tilities in Bretagne, though he had a &s;trong army in the heart of that province, and the dutche&s;s was in no condition to check his progre&s;s.</P>

order of the trinity. The&s;e amba&s;&s;adors arriving in England, had an audience of the king at London, at which nothing material was tran&s;acted: but Richard Fox bi&s;hop of Exeter, Thomas earl of Ormond, and &s;ome others, being ap|pointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with them, the general of the trinity, at their fir&s;t conference, in a very humble &s;peech ob&s;erved$ $hat he and his colleagues were &s;ent to demand peace of the king of England, for whom Charles had the mo&s;t profound e&s;teem; that their ma&s;ter propo&s;ed to make a conque&s;t of Na|ples, which was unju&s;tly detained from him by a ba&s;tard of the hou&s;e of Ar|ragon; and that, after having fini&s;hed that enterprize, his intention was to carry his arms into the ea&s;t, and overthrow the Ottoman empire$ that in the&s;e &s;entiments he made no &s;cruple to demand peace of all the European princes$ that he might not, by their means, be diverted from the execution of a project that would redound &s;o much to the glory and advantage of the ch$i$$ian reli|gion; and finally, that, as a mark of his eager de&s;ire to maintain a good cor|re&s;pond$nce with the king of England, he, though undoubted lord paramount of Bretagne, and con&s;equently intitled to the ward&s;hip of the dutche$s$ de&s;ired that king Henry would con&s;ent to his di&s;po&s;ing of her in marriage as he &s;hould think proper. To this lowly remo$&s;trance, the chancellor, in the king's name, made a very lofty reply. He &s;aid the good under&s;tanding between his ma&s;ter and the French king, was not to be re&s;tored by words but by actions$ that, with re&s;pect to the marriage of Anne dutche&s;s of Britanny, king Henry had no intention to intermeddle in the affair, provided Charles would act by the law and not by the &s;word; and as for his de&s;igns upon the kingdom of Naples, he would only make one ob&s;ervation, which was, that if Charles thought his ho|nour engaged to recover that realm, he could not be &s;urprized that the king of England &s;hould do his utmo&s;t endeavour to retrieve the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Guienne, Normandy, and the whole kingdom of France, which was his lawful inheri|tance. The French amba&s;&s;adors, &s;urprized at this declaration, an&s;wered with &s;ome warmth, that the king their &s;overeign was not afraid of &s;uch menaces, and knew how to defend his ju&s;t rights again&s;t any prince or per&s;on who &s;hould attempt to invade them. The chancellor replied without emotion, that the king expected no other an&s;wer from them, but that he would in a little time &s;end amba&s;&s;adors into France, in order to explain his intentions to their ma&s;ter. Mean while he a&s;ked if Charles would be contented, &s;hould the king of England con&s;ent to his di&s;po&s;ing of the dutche&s;s of Bretagne in marriage, with an exclu&s;ion of his own per&s;on. To this que&s;tion the amba&s;&s;adors replied, that their king was &s;o<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baco$$</NOTE> far from entertaining any thought of e&s;pou&s;ing the dutche&s;s, that he $ad given them no in&s;tructions on the &s;ubject. Henry, upon this occa&s;ion, &s;pun his thread of politics too fine. His intention was to intimidate Charles; and for that purpo&s;e, he made u&s;e of a rhodomontade which produced a contrary effect. The French king knew he was too wi$e to embark in &s;uch an enterprize as the conque&s;t of France; and therefore interpreted his menaces into an artifice for deterring him from the conque&s;t of Britanny, which he re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute without further he&s;itation.</P>

Anne. Thinking it un$ece&s;&s;ary to conceal her marriage longer from the know|lege of Henry, who a&s;&s;umed the name of her protector, &s;he &s;ent a &s;olemn de|putation, compo&s;ed of the prince of Orange, the count de Dunois, and the chancel$or, to notify her marriage with Maximilian, and &s;ollicit immediate &s;uccour of the king of England. Charles was no &s;ooner informed of this match, than he be&s;ieged the dutche&s;s in her capital city of Rennes; and during the &s;iege, which la&s;ted &s;everal months, &s;he &s;ent repeated envoys to Henry, de|manding a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He made u&s;e of the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing &s;ollicitations, as a pretence for rai&s;ing loans of mo$ey through the whole kingdom. He renewed the league with Ferdinand and Maximilian, who &s;ent two thou&s;and men to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his wife, while his allies engaged to enter France at the head of two good armies, by the month of June in the following year. Not that either of the&s;e allies intended to fulfil this engagement. Ferdinand was otherwi&s;e employed in the war of Grenada; the king of the Romans was de&s;titute of troops and money; a$d Henry, perceiving at la&s;t that Bretagne mu&s;t certainly be con|quered, would by no means engage alone in its defence. Their views there|fore in this alliance had a very different termination. Ferdinand hoped his league with Henry would induce Charles to purcha&s;e his forbearance with the re&s;titution of Rou&s;illon. The king of the Romans wanted to involve Fer|dinan$ and Henry in a war, of which he would reap the whole fruit, without bearing any &s;hare of the labour; and the &s;ole aim of Henry was, by the terror of this triple alliance, to extort from Charles &s;ecurity for the payment of the demands which $e had upon France and Brittany.</P>

<P>The French king, without being much di&s;turbed by the&s;e nego|tiations, continued the &s;iege of Rennes; but, as he made little progre&s;s in his operations, and the &s;ea&s;on was already far advanced, he took a more e$$icacious method to &s;ecure the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bretagne. He bribed all the coun&s;ellors of the young dutche&s;s, to per&s;uade her to renounce her marriage with Maximilian, and receive him&s;elf as her hu&s;band. The prince&s;s, who was then about fifteen years of age, at fir&s;t re&s;i&s;ted all their &s;ollicitations, ob&s;erving that &s;he could not in honour abandon a prince whom &s;he had voluntarily married. But they al|ledged that Maximilian had abandoned her, in relinqui&s;hing her intere&s;t and living quietly in Germany, without offering to come in per&s;on and undertake her defence, or &s;ending &s;uccours proportioned to her occa&s;ions. They repre|&s;ented that, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, Brittany would certainly become a province of France, and Maximilian would manife&s;t &s;till le&s;s regard for her, when he &s;hould &s;ee her &s;tripped of her dominions; &s;o that &s;he would have the completed mortification to lo&s;e her hu&s;band and her dutchy, and &s;ee her &s;ubjects reduced to &s;lavery: that in marrying the king of France &s;he might &s;ecure to her&s;elf the &s;overeignty of Bretagne, and pre&s;erve the liberty of her people: and that the age of Charles was more &s;uitable to her own than that of Maximilian, who was already advanced in years. The king of France, find|ing her deaf to all the&s;e remon&s;trances, devi&s;ed another expedient to overcome her ob&s;tinacy. Knowing what an a&s;cendency the duke of Orleans had gained over the mind of this young prince&s;s, he relea&s;ed him from the tower of Bourges, in which he had been confined &s;ince the battle of St. Aubin, on condition that he &s;hould employ all his influence with the dutche&s;s, in obtaining her con&s;ent $o the marriage.

<P>While this affair was in agitation, Charles continued to amu&s;e the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, who were no &s;ooner informed of the purpo&s;ed mar|riage, than they retired without taking leave, and reported their di&s;covery to Henry, who was not a little confounded at finding him&s;elf &s;o egregiou&s;ly du|ped, and in &s;uch danger of lo&s;ing the money which he had expended in the de|fence of Bretagne. Neverthele&s;s, he had &s;till another advantage over Charles, of which he did not fail to avail him&s;elf. That prince had projected the conque&s;t of Naples; and as a rupture in England would have greatly interfered with the execution of his de&s;ign, he &s;ought to avoid it with the utmo&s;t care and circum&s;pection. Henry, being well acquainted with his views, affected the warme&s;t re&s;entment of the affront he had received, and threatened vengeance again&s;t the author. As &s;oon as his amba&s;&s;adors had made their report, he i&s;&s;ued orders for levying troops and preparing tran&s;ports, and declared he would forthwith carry the war into the bowels of France. Maximilian breathed nothing but revenge, when he under&s;tood that he was deprived of his wife in &s;uch an outrageous manner: he, like Henry, threatened to lay wa&s;te the kingdom of France with fire and &s;word; and the archduke Philip de|manded that his &s;i&s;ter Margaret, who had been betrothed to Charles, might be &s;ent back from Paris, where &s;he re&s;ided for her education. The court of France however would not as yet comply with this demand, and &s;eemed to di&s;regard the threats of father and &s;on by the mo&s;t &s;upercilious neglect. All the attention of Charles was employed in averting the &s;torm with which he was threatened from Spain and England; for, by this time, Ferdinand and I&s;abella had fini&s;hed the war again&s;t the Moors with the reduction of Grenada, and loudly menaced France with an inva&s;ion. Henry &s;eemed actually in earne&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> in his preparations for war. That his dominions might be &s;ecure on the &s;ide of Scotland, he concluded a truce at Cold&s;tream with the amba&s;&s;adors of James IV. &s;overeign of that kingdom. In the beginning of the year he a&s;&s;embled a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1492.</NOTE> parliament, to which he declared in per&s;on his re&s;olution to recover the kingdom of France, as the inheritance of his ance&s;tors. He reminded the members of the victories gained at Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, by a &s;mall number of Engli&s;h over the mo&s;t powerful armies of France; men|tioned the different powers that were ready to co-operate with his mea&s;ures in attacking that kingdom; demanded a &s;upply &s;uitable to the greatne&s;s of the occa&s;ion, exhorting the commons to &s;pare the pur&s;e of the poor, and let the burthen of the tax fall upon the wealthy. Though the commons had very little rea&s;on to grant a &s;ub&s;idy, con&s;idering how the la&s;t was embezzled, the conque&s;t of France was &s;uch a temptation as they could not re&s;i&s;t. They not only advi&s;ed him to engage in this enterprize, which in reality he had no mind to undertake, but they &s;upplied him with uncommon alacrity; and, according to his de&s;ire, impowered him to rai&s;e a benevolence from the weal|thy part of his &s;ubjects. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

<P>After the &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up, the king received an emba&s;&s;y from Charles of France, with certain propo&s;als, the nature of which never tran&s;pired; tho' in all probability, tho&s;e envoys laid the foundation of that peace which was concluded before the end of the year. In the month of June, the queen
<PB N="496" REF="5060">
was delivered of a &s;econd &s;on called Henry, who &s;ucceeded his father on the throne of England. Immediately after that event, the king &s;ent a reinforce|ment of two and twenty $h$ps, and two thou&s;and five hundred men, to the arch|duke Philip, who had marched again&s;t Philip de Cleves the leader of the revolted $word$ That chief retiring to Sluys, was there be&s;ieged, and &s;o hard pre&s;|&s;ed by the Engli&s;h auxiliaries, that he was obliged to &s;ue for peace, and &s;ur|$$$der the town to the archduke. Henry, who had no intention to pro&s;ecute the war with vigour, &s;oon began to flag in his preparations; and &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to France on pretence of manife&s;ting his de&s;ire to terminate the di&s;pute by fair means, before he would u$&s;heath the &s;word of vengeance: at the &s;ame time, $word$ di&s;patched envoys to &s;ummon Maximilian and Ferdinand, to invade France $word$ to their engagements. But, he knew very well they had neither the $word$ nor the power to comply with the articles of the treaty. Maximi|$ian was de&s;ticute of troops, and Ferdinand had actually begun a negotiation with Charles, for the re&s;titution of Rou&s;&s;illon. In the beginning of Augu&s;t, Hentry i&s;&s;ued new orders for fre&s;h levies; and, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame month, the appointed commi&s;&s;ioners, to treat with the Scotti&s;h deputies at Cold&s;tream, $word$ a &s;olid peace between the two nations. At length, he con&s;tituted his &s;on Arthur prince of Wales guardian of the kingdom; and in the begin|ning of October repaired to Sandwich, where he embarked his army. Before he went on board, he received a letter from the marechal De&s;querdes, propo&s;|ing that a negotiation for peace might be carried on in England: but, the king $e&s;ol $ed to negotiate in France, in order to &s;ave appearances.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. He had &s;carce arrived at Calais, when his amba&s;&s;adors returned from the king of the Romans, with an account of that prince's being altoge|ther $$$ble to fulfil his engagements; and in a few days after their arrival, he received letters from his envoys in Spain, giving him to under&s;tand, that Fer|di$$nd had made peace with Charles, on condition of being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rou&s;&s;illon. Henry a Tected great &s;urprize and confu&s;ion when he $word$ the&s;e $idings, which were carefully promulgated, as preliminaries of the pea$$ which $e meant to conclude.

King Charles was then at Tours; and tho' he, could not be ignorant of Henry's preparations, he had not even a&s;&s;embled an army to oppo&s;e the invader: a circum&s;tance which plainly proves, that the whole tran&s;action was concer$ed between the two kings; and that the &s;iege of Boulog$e was no other than an artifice to di&s;courage the Engli&s;h army with a winter campaign, that they might be the le&s;s plea&s;ed with a pacification.</P>

<P>In eight days after Henry undertook this &s;iege, he received the articles of peace concluded between the commi&s;&s;ioners of both kingdoms, to this effect: That the king of France &s;hould di&s;charge the debt contracted by his queen for the defence of Britanny: That he &s;hould moreover pay to Henry the arrears of the pen&s;ion which his father granted to Edward IV. That, as there was no &s;um &s;pecified in the obligation of the dutche&s;s of Britanny to the king of England, this la&s;t &s;hould produce vouchers of his accounts to French commi&s;&s;ioners, who &s;hould be &s;ent to England for that purpo&s;e: That the two
<PB N="497" REF="5070">
kings &s;hould name tho&s;e of their allies whom they de&s;ired to compr$$end in the treaty; and that they &s;hould declare in four months wheth$r they would or would not be comprehended: That, &s;hould the king of the Romans and his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> &s;on Philip de&s;ire to be included, and $fterwards $he king of Fra$ce pre$u$e to invade their country on any pretext what&s;oever, the king o$ England $$o$ld be at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t them; but &s;hould they, on the contrary, at$ack the do$i|nions of France, he &s;hould yield them no a&s;&s;i&s;tance: That, &s;hould the two kings approve the&s;e articles, they &s;hould mutually give ho$$ages until the treaty could be &s;igned and ratified. Though the&s;e articles were extremely agreeable to Henry, he affected to he&s;itate and &s;tart objections; and $word$ length referred them to the con&s;ideration of a general council, compo&s;ed of all the noble$en and principal offi$ers in the army. The&s;e were influen$$d and directed by &s;$$e of his own creatures, and unanimou&s;ly gave it as their opinion, that the co$di|tion$ ought to be accepted. The king, pretending to be determined by $he advice of the council, confirmed the treaty, which was ratified in like manner by Charles; a$d both &s;overeign$ undertook for its receiving the &s;anction of the e&s;tates of their re&s;pective realms. The nature of this peace pl$inly proves that the war was undertaken &s;olely with a view to the payment of the money expended in defence of B$etagne, and the revival of the pen&s;ion; for there is not one word in the articles relating to Henry's title to Guienne, Normandy, and the crown of France, which was his pretence for beginning the war. It was &s;tipulated th$t the treaty &s;hould remain in force till the d$ath of both kings; and that the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of him who &s;hould die fir&s;t &s;hould ratify the peace within a year after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. On the &s;ame day that t$e peace was &s;igned at E&s;taples, the amba&s;&s;adors of England and Scotland conclud$d a truce for two years, at Cold&s;tream. This treaty between France and England g$ve great umbrage to Henry's &s;ubjects, who not only repined at Britanny's being annexed to the French crown, but al&s;o complained that he had $$e$ced his people for the maintenance of a war which he undertook merely with $ $i$w to fill his own coffers. The nobility and officers who had $old or $word$ their e&s;tates, in hope of preferment in the &s;ervice, &s;crupled not $o $word$ that the king had plucked his people to feather him&s;elf. Henry w$$ not $t $ll di&s;turbed by the&s;e murmurs, which he was enabled to di&s;regard by the payment of &s;even hundred and forty-five thou&s;and ducats for the expence of his $$ma|ment, and the promi&s;e of five and twenty thou&s;and crowns yearly, whic$ w$r$ punctually remitted in the &s;equel.

He was by this time<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 149$.</NOTE> become extremely odious to the Engli&s;h, who imputed the lo&s;s of $r$tanny to his avarice and neglect. They accu&s;ed him of trepanning the commons into a grant of exorb$tant taxes, on fal&s;e pretences; of having extorted i$m$n$e $$ms illegally, under the term of a Benevolence; of having concluded an inglo$ious peace with the king of France; of treating the queen har&s;hly; and of depre$$ing all tho&s;e who had been well-wi&s;hers to the hou&s;e of York.</P>

<P>He was not ignorant of his people's di&s;content, and fo$e$$w the &s;torm to which he was afterwards expo&s;ed. A new pretender to hi$ crown$ more dangerous than L$mbert Sim$el, had $$arted up on the $word$ $word$ a&s;&s;umed the name of R$$hard Plantagenet, duke of York, &s;econd &s;on of the

fourth Edward, &s;uppo&s;ed to have e&s;caped from the Tower, after the death of his elder brother. This pretender was a youth of a very engaging appearanc$ and in&s;inuating addre&s;s, who is &s;aid to have been the &s;on of one O&s;beck, a converted j$$ of Tournay, from whence he removed to London, where the impo$$o$ was born and chri&s;tened by the name of Peter: king Edward, being acquainted with O&s;b$ck and his wife, &s;tood godfather to the child; who, from the delicacy of his per&s;on, acquired the diminutive appellation of Peterkin or Perkin. Edward him&s;elf is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had an amour with his mother, and, $rom his re&s;emblance to that prince, he was thought a proper agent to per&s;onate the duke of York. After having re&s;ided &s;ome years in England, he was by his parents conveyed to Flanders, where he con&s;orted chiefly with Engli&s;h company, &s;o as to pre&s;erve his original language; and as he grew up, he exhibited &s;uch accompli&s;hments both of body and under&s;tanding as recom|mended him to the notice of Margaret dutche&s;s of Burgundy, who re&s;olved to play him off as a pretender to the crown of England. For thi$ purpo&s;e &s;he tu|$ored him in private, until he was perfectly in&s;tructed wi$h regard to the deport|ment he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume. He was made acquainted with all the particulars relating to Richard duke of York, whom he was de&s;igned to per&s;onate, as well as wi$h the &s;tature and lineaments of his pretended father, mother, brother, &s;i$ters, and relations; together with all the tran&s;actions of Edward's court which a child of eleven years of age might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ob&s;erve and remem|ber. He likewi&s;e r$ceived a minute detail of what pa&s;&s;ed while he was in the &s;anctuary and in the To$er; the manner of his brother's death, and his own e&s;cape. When he was fully in&s;tructed, the dutche&s;s re&s;olved that he &s;hould openly claim the Engli&s;h crown; but, in the mean time, that her &s;ecret inten|tion might not be prematurely divulged, &s;he &s;ent him to Portugal with the lady Br$mpton: there he continued a whole year, until Henry declared war again&s;t France: then &s;he de$ired him by letter to take &s;hipping for Ireland, and produce him&s;elf in that country, which was devoted to the hou&s;e of York. He follo$ed her directions without he&s;itation; and, landing in Cork, per&s;onated Richard Plantagenet, &s;econd &s;on of Edward IV. He was immediately joined by a great number of parti&s;ans, and wrote to the earls of De&s;mond and Kildare, exhorting them to acknowledge his title, and join him with their va&s;&s;als and dependants. Charles VIII. was no &s;ooner informed of his appearance in Ireland, than he &s;ent Stephen Tryon, who had been formerly in Henry's &s;er|vice, and one Lucas, as amba&s;&s;adors to Perkin, to a&s;&s;ure him of his protection, and invite him to his court. On his arrival at Paris he was honourably received, ackno$ledged as duke of York, and accommodated in a princely manner, $ill the peace of E$$aples, when Henry endeavoured, without &s;ucce&s;s, to per&s;u$de Charles to deliver up this pretender. The French king would not violate the laws of ho&s;pitality, though he promi&s;ed that he &s;hould have no a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from Fr$nce in his de&s;igns upon the Engli&s;h throne.

of his being the real duke of York. She forthwith acknowledged him as her nephew, di&s;tingui&s;hed him by the title of the White Ro&s;e of England, appointed a guard for his per&s;on, and treated him in all re&s;pects as the true heir of the Engli&s;h throne. When the&s;e circum&s;tances were known in England, the people were extremely well inclined to adopt the impo&s;ture, partly through hatred to the king, but chiefly from a per&s;ua&s;ion that Perkin was the real Richard Plantagenet. Sir William Stanley, lord chamberlain of the hou&s;ehold, the lord Fitzwalter, Sir Simon Montfort, Sir Thomas Thwaites, and others, engaged in a &s;ecret con&s;piracy to favour this youth's title, and &s;ent over Sir Robert Clifford and W. Bailey, of Aldeburgh in Hertford&s;hire, to learn the truth of what was tran&s;acted at the court of Margaret dutche&s;s of Burgundy. Sir Robert had &s;everal conferences with this prince&s;s on the &s;ubject, After having conver&s;ed frequently with Perkin, he wrote a letter to his confederates, in which he declared that he knew the per&s;on of the duke of York as well as he knew his own; and that this youth was undoubtedly the true Richard Plantagenet.</P>

<P>Henry was not idle at this juncture; he had received a confu|&s;ed intimation of the con&s;piracy, and employed emi&s;&s;aries abroad to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the confidence of Perkin and his protectre&s;s, that they might learn the particulars of the pretender's birth and education, as well as the names of tho&s;e who favoured him in England. That tho&s;e &s;pies might be &s;creened from all &s;u&s;picion among the parti&s;ans of Perkin, he cau&s;ed them to be excom|municated at St. Paul's, by name, in the bead-roll of the king's enemies, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of the times; and he tampered with the chaplains and confe&s;&s;ors of his nobility, in order to di&s;cover their &s;ecret inclinations. While he took the&s;e mea&s;ures for di&s;covering and defeating the con&s;piracy, he was equally indu&s;trious in finding out and promulgating proofs of the real duke of York's having been murdered in the Tower. Sir James Tyrrel, who had been one of Henry's plenipotentiaries in France; and his &s;ervant Dighton, &s;aid to have been concerned in that tragedy, were examined, and confe&s;&s;ed the fact, as it hath been related in the hi&s;tory of the preceding reign: but, how|ever, their account left the affair in &s;ome perplexity, and the king made no u&s;e of it in any of his declarations. Dighton however was &s;et at liberty, and earned his pardon by divulging this tradition; which, in all probability, was invented for the purpo&s;e. All the intelligence that Henry obtained abroad amounted to no more than the &s;ame detail which we have repeated; and therefore it did not fully an&s;wer his end, which was to convince the world of the impo&s;ture: on the contrary, it &s;erved to confirm the opinion of many people in favour of Perkin, becau&s;e it was &s;o defective and ill-atte&s;ted. They concluded, from Henry's known &s;agacity, that if the youth had really been an impo&s;tor, he would have traced him from his cradle to his appearance in the character of Richard Plantagenet, in &s;uch a manner as would have left no doubt of his identity. They could hardly believe that Charles king of France, and the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, would have pro&s;tituted the dignity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> of princes &s;o far, as to be&s;tow it upon a common adventurer; and they took it for granted, that if the duke of York had been actually murdered in the Tower, king Henry would have been able to prove the fact &s;o clearly
<PB N="5$0" REF="5100">
as to confute the preten&s;ions of any counterfeit. There was &s;omething very my&s;terious in the king's conduct upon this occa&s;ion; for the intelligence he pretended to have received from his &s;pies abroad, touching the life and ad|ventures of Perkin War$e$k, was not publi&s;hed by proclamation, or in any other authentic manner; but circulated in vague and contradictory reports by the courtiers and their adherents. With re&s;pect to the death of the real duke of York, Henry's amba&s;&s;ador at the court of the archduke, when de&s;ired to produce the evidence, &s;aid his ma&s;ter declined that &s;ort of proof, becau&s;e it might be &s;aid he had tutored the witne&s;&s;es. The&s;e circum&s;tances, added to the uncommon jealou&s;y he manife&s;ted towards the pretender, the great pains he took, and the &s;ums which, contrary to his nature, he expended in countermining the efforts of Perkin, per&s;uaded many people that the youth was<NOTE PLACE="marg">P$mer.</NOTE> not an impo&s;tor.</P>

<P>Be that as it may, Henry found means to win over Sir Robert Clifford to his intere&s;t. He &s;ent Sir Edward Poynings and Sir William War|ham as amba&s;&s;adors to the archduke, to complain of the dutche&s;s Margaret as the author of this impo&s;ture; and demand that Perkin might be delivered into his hands, as a pyrate or common enemy of mankind, who ought not to be protected by the law of nations. The council of the archduke, having de|liberated on this demand, replied to the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, That, in con|&s;ideration of the archduke's friend&s;hip for Henry, no aid &s;hould be granted to the pretender; but, that the dutche&s;s dowager being ab&s;olute in the lands a&s;|&s;igned as her dowry, he had no authority over her conduct. Philip was the more indifferent towards Henry on this occa&s;ion, as he had ju&s;t concluded a treaty with Charles of France, who had delivered up his &s;i&s;ter Margaret, with the counties of Artois and Burgundy; though he &s;till retained &s;ome places, which he promi&s;ed to re&s;tore when Philip &s;hould be of age. The amba&s;&s;adors, in re|porting the archduke's an&s;wer, gave the king to under&s;tand, that there was a collu&s;ion between that prince and the dutche&s;s dowager, in the affair of Perkin; and Henry was &s;o incen&s;ed at Philip's conduct, that he not only broke off all corre&s;pondence with him, but al&s;o expelled his &s;ubjects from the dominions of England. The archduke retorted this animo&s;ity upon all the Engli&s;h who re&s;ided in Flanders; but their re&s;entment proceeded no farther, becau&s;e they were afraid of each other.</P>

<P>Mean while the king of England was exactly informed by Sir Robert Clifford of the corre&s;pondence which the dutche&s;s and Perkin maintained with England. In order to cru&s;h the con&s;piracy before it &s;hould become too dangerous, he i&s;&s;ued orders privately for arre&s;ting John Ratcliff, lord Fitz|walter, Sir Simon Mountford, Sir Thomas Thwaites, William Daubigney, Robert Ratcliff, Thomas Chre&s;&s;enor, and Thomas A&s;hwood, who were ap|prehended at the &s;ame time, tried, convicted of holding trea&s;onable corre&s;pon|dence with Perkin, and condemned to die the death of traitors.

<P>The con&s;piracy being thus quelled in England, Henry re&s;olved to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He appointed his &s;econd &s;on Henry$ an infant of two years of age, vice$oy of that kingdom; and Sir Edward Poy|nings, his deputy, with a very exten&s;ive power over the civil as well as the mili|tary admini&s;tration. At his arrival in Ireland he &s;et on foot a &s;evere inquiry about tho&s;e who were &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection, and in a particular manner attacked the earls of De&s;mond and Kildare, to whom Perkins had written, when he fir&s;t landed at Cork. The fir&s;t &s;tood upon the defen&s;ive, and eluded the power of the deputy; but the earl of Kildare was &s;ent pri&s;oner to England, from whence he was &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to his own country, with marks of the king's e&s;teem and $avour, Henry judging that, at &s;uch a conjuncture, he &s;hould gain more by acts of clemency and indulgence, than by the exerci&s;e of rigour and &s;everity. In this opinion he &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ioner to Ireland, with a formal amne&s;ty in favour of the earl of De&s;mond and all the rebels of that country, re&s;olving, if po&s;|&s;ible, by fair means, to &s;tifle the very &s;eeds of rebellion in an i&s;land where the hou&s;e of York had &s;uch a number of parti&s;ans. While Poynings re&s;ided in Ireland he convened a parliament, which is famous on record for the acts it pa&s;&s;ed to the advantage of England, and the Engli&s;h &s;ettled among the Iri&s;h. One of the&s;e, &s;till known by the name of Poynings' Act, decreed, That the parliament of Ireland could not be a&s;&s;embled until the governor and council &s;hould have made the king acquainted with the cau&s;es of its meeting, and received his maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion, under the great &s;eal.

<P>Henry's avarice increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree of rapacity, that he em|ployed all his invention to find out pretences for ama&s;&s;ing &s;ums of money; and trumped up the mo&s;t frivolous accu&s;ations again&s;t wealthy individuals, that he might fill his coffers at their expence. The&s;e were the genuine effects of a covetous di&s;po&s;ition, which was altogether in$atiable; for he had no real u&s;e for the money he thus extorted. He was at peace with all the world. He had obtained from parliament two very con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idies, of which he had ex|pended no part but what was repayed with u&s;ury. He had enriched him&s;elf with divers confi&s;cations, and received annually $ifty thou&s;and livres from the king of France. The&s;e re&s;ources, added to his ordinary revenues, rendered him the riche&s;t king in Europe: yet, not &s;atisfied, he could not refrain from &s;queezing money out of his people by forfeitures on penal laws. The fir&s;t per|&s;on of note who &s;uffered in this manner was Sir William Capel, alderman of London, condemned in the &s;um of &s;even and twenty hundred pounds, &s;ixteen hundred of which he payed to the king by way of compo&s;ition; but no part of Henry's conduct redounded more to his di&s;honour, than his pro&s;ecution of the lord chamberlain Stanley, to whom he, in a great mea&s;ure, owed his ele|vation to the throne.</P>

<P>We have already ob&s;erved that this nobleman favoured the cau&s;e of Perkin Warbeck, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he was the real &s;on of Edward IV. and perhaps he was influenced on this occa&s;ion by re&s;entment again&s;t Henry, from whom he is &s;aid to have &s;uffered a repul&s;e, when he a&s;ked the earldom of Che&s;ter. The king certainly had rea&s;on to $read the ill offices of &s;uch a powerful nobleman; but, in all probability, his greate&s;t crime was his great wealth, which exceeded that of any other Engli&s;h &s;ubject, and captivated the heart of Henry; for the charge again&s;t him was con&s;trued into $rea&s;on, by a very high-&s;trained interpretation. In order to accompli&s;h his aim, he di|rected his informer, Clifford, to come over from Flanders; and no &s;ooner un|der&s;tood he was arrived in England, than he took up his re&s;idence in the Tower, that he might the more conveniently apprehend the delinquent. Clif|ford, according to his in&s;tructions, appeared before the council; and throwing him&s;elf at the king's feet, implored his clemency, which he &s;aid he would de|&s;erve by declaring all that he knew of the con&s;piracy. Henry promi&s;ed to par|don him, on that condition; then he proceeded to impeach &s;undry per&s;ons, and among the re&s;t the lord chamberlain. The king affected great &s;urprize at this declaration, bidding him take heed; and threatening him with death, &s;hould his accu&s;ation be $ound fal&s;e and malicious. Clifford per&s;i&s;ted in the charge, and the chamberlain was immediately put under arre&s;t: next day, be|ing examined before the council, he owned what was laid to his charge, and was condemned on his own confe&s;&s;ion; though his whole crime amounted to no more than that he had &s;aid, He would never bear arms again&s;t Perkin Warbeck, was he certain that the youth was really the &s;on of Edward IV. Perhaps he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure in the &s;ervice he had done the king, and the great credit of his brother, the earl of Derby, who had married Henry's mo|ther.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> But he fell a &s;acrifice to his great wealth; and all the favour he could $btain was the re&s;pite of a few weeks, that he might prepare him&s;elf for death, which he did not &s;uffer till the beginning of the following year; when his po&s;t of chamberlain was filled with Giles lord Dawbeny, a nobleman of approved valour and &s;ufficiency. The king found in Stanley's ca&s;tle of Holt forty thou|&s;and marks of money, and plate, be&s;ides jewels, furniture, cattle, and effects to an immen&s;e value; and an e&s;tate of three thou&s;and pounds a year. With this boo$y he con&s;oled him&s;elf for the &s;ecret cur&s;es of his people, who not only de$e&s;ted his avarice and ingratitude, but were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation at the fate of the chamberlain, who had been condemned for that of which very few Engli&s;h &s;ubjects were innocent; namely, for preferring the right of the hou&s;e of York to that of the reigning king. What augmented their fear was their perceiving that Henry ma$ntained &s;pies to watch the conduct of the chamberlain; and, in all probability, followed the &s;ame practice with other noblemen, who d$r&s;t no longer communicate their &s;entiments, le$t tho&s;e whom they tru&s;ted as friends, &s;hould turn out informers, and betray their con|fidence: but, what they dur&s;t not impart to their intimates, they vented in &s;evere libels and $atires again&s;t the judges, the council, and the king him|&s;elf; who was &s;o provoked by tho&s;e $arca$ms, that he ordered five mean<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$id.</NOTE> per&s;ons, detected in di&s;per&s;ing the papers, to be executed as traitors.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, his favourite Richard Fox bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells was tran&s;lated to the &s;ee of Durham; and the king's &s;on Hen|ry was created duke of York: he was at the &s;ame time made knight of the Bath, and &s;everal noblemen and per&s;ons of rank were likewi&s;e admitted into that order. Young Henry was afterwards appointed warden of the northern Marches, for defence of which the earl of Surrey began to levy forces, as the king had &s;ome rea&s;on to doubt the friend&s;hip of James IV. king of Scotland. In the &s;ummer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1495.</NOTE> king Henry, in order to convince the world, that the proceedings again&s;t Sir William Stanley had not at all dimini&s;hed his regard for his brother the earl of Derby, or his affection for his own mother the wife of that nobleman, made an excur&s;ion to the earl's hou&s;e at Latham, where he &s;tayed three days, and &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed with his entertainment. From thence he made a progre&s;s through York&s;hire; and while he was ab&s;ent from the &s;outhern parts of this kingdom, Perkin Warbeck re&s;olved to try his fortune in England. Being &s;upplied with &s;ome troops and ve&s;&s;els by the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, he &s;et &s;ail in July, and arriving on the co$&s;t of Kent near Sandwich, landed &s;ome of his people, to $ound the inclinations of the natives. The&s;e endeavoured to cajole the Kenti&s;hmen, by a&s;&s;uring them that there was a &s;trong armament fit|ted out in Flanders for &s;upporting the title of the duke of York; but, the Engli&s;h perceiving they were all foreigners and freebooters, in&s;tead of joining them, con&s;ulted the gentlemen of the county, who advi&s;ed them to allure Per|kins a&s;hore with fair promi&s;es, and then make &s;ure of his per&s;on. They ac|cordingly took to their arms, and marching down to the &s;ea-&s;ide, invited the pretender to land, with a&s;&s;urances of ri&s;king their lives in his &s;ervice. But, he was di&s;&s;uaded $rom tru&s;ting him&s;elf in their hands, by his &s;ecretary Frion$ who from their delaying this declaration &s;o long, and then appearing in regular bands, concluded they were part of Henry's forces. On this &s;uppo&s;ition he hindered Perkin from landing in per&s;on. The Engli&s;h finding he &s;u&s;pected their de|&s;ign, fell upon tho&s;e whom he had &s;ent on &s;hore, and put them all to the &s;word, except about one hundred and fifty, who were brought pri&s;oners to London, and hanged in different parts of the coa&s;t by the king's order: mean while Per|kin, &s;eeing the di&s;a&s;ter of his people, hoi&s;ted $ail and returned to Flanders.</P>

This &s;tatute appears at fir&s;t &s;ight to have been enacted in favour of the people; but, in reality it was calculated to hinder individuals from prying too narrowly into the king's title, which they would have no longer occa&s;ion to inve&s;tigate, as this provi&s;ion was made for their &s;afety. There was another law pa&s;&s;ed for obliging<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rot.

&s;upport from the friends of the hou&s;e of York, from whom he had formerly met with a favourable reception. Bu$, by this time, the king and his deputy Poynings, had taken &s;uch pr$dent mea&s;$res to prevent any di&s;turbance in that kingdom, that no per&s;on of any con&s;equence declared in his behalf; &s;o that his friends advi$ed him to &s;o$$icit &s;uccour of James king of Scotland, who was upon very indifferent terms with Henry. The dutche&s;s of Burgundy had en|tered into a &s;ecret negotiation with that prince, who, in all probability, had en|gaged to a&s;&s;i$$ him before he &s;ailed from Flanders; and the youth is &s;aid to have b$$n recommended to his protection by Maximilian, who had &s;ucceeded his $a$her Freder$$ as emperor of Germany, the archduke Philip, and Charles king of France. Perkin, &s;eeing no hopes of being &s;upported in Ireland, and Henry having put the whole coa&s;t of England in a po&s;ture of defence, $ailed to Scotland, and repairing to Edinburgh, dema$$ed an audience of James, in quality of duke of York.

<P>Charles had pa&s;&s;ed the Alps at the invitation of Ludovico S$orza, nephew to John Galeazo duke of Milan. He entered Italy without oppo&s;ition, obliged Peter de Medicis, who governed the republic of Florence, to &s;urrender four of his &s;tronge&s;t places into his $ands, and accommodate him with a &s;um of money. He made a triumphal entry into that capital, where he publi&s;hed a mani$e&s;to, explaining his p$eten&s;ions to the kingdom of Naples: then he re|paired to Rome, of which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, while pope Alexander VI. &s;hut him&s;elf up in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo, for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on. After hav|ing garri&s;oned the be&s;t places in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, and received cardinal Cae&s;ar Borgia the pope's ba&s;tard as an ho&s;tage, he began his march from Rome to Naples.

His &s;on advanced towards the fron|tiers, in order to &s;top the progre&s;s of Charles; but was abandoned by his forces, and returning to Naples, was refu&s;ed admittance: in this extremity he retired to the little i&s;land of I$chia, after having left garri&s;ons in the ca&s;tles that com|manded his capital. Mean while the French king continued his march; was received into Capua; all the other towns of the kingdom &s;ubmitted to his power: the city of Naples opened its gates at his appr$ach; and, in a few days he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tles. He was &s;o intoxicated by &s;uch a torrent of &s;ucce&s;s, that he neglected to take proper mea&s;ures for the pre&s;erva|tion of his conque&s;ts.

of Naples. As he had not troops &s;ufficient to garri&s;on all the towns that had &s;ubmitted, they gradually fell off, and declared for their own &s;overeign; and a powerful league was formed again&s;t him by the pope, the emperor, the king of Spain, the archduke, the king of Naples, the republic of Venice, and his old friend Ludovico Sfor&s;a, who had by this time poi&s;oned his uncle, and &s;ucceeded to the dutchy of Milan; &s;o that he had no farther occa&s;ion for the friend&s;hip of Charles. Thus circum&s;tanced, he thought it high time to retreat to his own<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> dominions; but, the allies had already a&s;&s;embled an army of forty thou&s;and men, and po&s;ted them&s;elves at Fornova, in order to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age. Tho' inferior in number he gave them battle without he&s;itation, and obtained a vic|tory, by which he made his retreat good.

By one of the articles of this treaty, Philip<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> engaged to hinder the dutche&s;s dowager of Burgundy, from giving &s;helter or protection to the rebellious &s;ubjects of the king: and by another, it was &s;tipu|lated, That a ve&s;&s;el belonging to the &s;ubjects of either prince, &s;hipwrecked on the coa&s;t of England, or the Low Countries, &s;hould not be liable to confi&s;cation, provided a man, a dog, a cat, or a cock, remained alive on board. The Flemings called this the Great treaty of Commerce, not only becau&s;e it contained many articles, but al&s;o in contradi&s;tinction to another, which was made in the &s;equel, and known by the appellation of the Bad treaty, becau&s;e not &s;o advantageous to the Low Countries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this year, the king granted a patent to John Cabot, a Venetian, and his three &s;ons, for di&s;covering new lands under the Engli&s;h flag, on condition, that after all the expence &s;hould be de|ducted, he &s;hould receive one fifth of the profit.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Perkin Warbeck in&s;inuated him&s;elf &s;o far into the good graces of the Scotti&s;h king, that he undertook to place him on the throne of England; and being a&s;&s;ured that the Engli&s;h would declare for him in great numbers, as &s;oon as he &s;hould appear in that kingdom, properly attended, he rai&s;ed a numerous army, which he conducted in per&s;on to Nor|thumberland, accompanied by the pretender. There he publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, in which he inveighed again&s;t Henry, as an u&s;urper, tyrant, and murderer; and

promi&s;ed honours and advantages to tho&s;e who &s;hould join their lawful prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baco$.</NOTE> and help to de&s;troy the robber who had deprived him of his throne. This, tho' a &s;pirited remon&s;trance, had very little effect upon the Engli&s;h, who were na|tionally aver&s;e to the Scots, and by this time &s;o intimidated by the &s;ucce&s;s and $everity of the reigning king, that they would no longer ri&s;que their lives and fortunes in behalf of a &s;tranger, even tho' they believed him to be the &s;on of Edward. James, &s;eeing no hopes of being joined by the Engli&s;h, and unwill|ing to lo&s;e his labour, ravaged the county of Northumberland with fire and &s;word. Then Perkin, pretending to be touched with the misfortunes of the people, conjured him in public, with tears in his eyes, to &s;pare his wretched &s;ub|jects; prote&s;ting he would rather live the life of a fugitive and vagabond, than be the cau&s;e of mi&s;chief to his countrymen. The Scot an&s;wered, with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile, that he was too generous and tender of that which did not belong to him; and that he would make an excellent &s;teward for his adver&s;ary. James hearing that an Engli&s;h army was on the march to give him battle, was loth to expo&s;e the immen$e booty he had obtained, to the chance of an engagement; and therefore retired with expedition into his own country. Henry was not a little di&s;gu&s;ted at this expedition, though it had not been attended with any important con&s;equence. He knew his &s;ubjects were generally di&s;affected; that the Iri&s;h were &s;trongly attached to the hou&s;e of York; and that Perkin was &s;till at hand, to profit by the fir&s;t favourable opportunity that might occur. In order to &s;ecure him&s;elf on all hands, he granted a general amne&s;ty to all the Iri&s;h who had declared for the pretender, that they might not be induced to rebel again by the fear of puni&s;hment. He employed Richard Fox bi&s;hop of Durham, to enter into a negotiation with James, as of his own accord, and treat of a mar|riage between that prince and his elde&s;t daughter Margaret: he had already en|gaged in the league of Italy again&s;t Charles VIII. of France; and now he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Ferdinand and I&s;abella, to confirm the former alliance, and re|new the engagements for the marriage between his &s;on Arthur prince of Wales and their third daughter Catherine.</P>

<P>With re&s;pect to Scotland, notwith&s;tanding the plan he had formed for a pacification with that kingdom, he would not let &s;lip any opportunity of de|manding a &s;ub&s;idy from parliament, which he therefore convoked in the month<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of January. In a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, he expatiated upon the in&s;ult he had received from the king of Scotland; drew a pathetic picture of the mi&s;eries which the people of the north had undergone, in the time of a truce, when they had no rea&s;on to expect &s;uch ho&s;tilities; and declared, that the honour of his crown, and the duty he owed to his &s;ubjects, would not permit him to bear &s;uch an indignity, without taking &s;ignal vengeance on the invader. The parlia|ment under&s;tood the hint, and voted a &s;ub&s;idy of one hundred and twenty thou|&s;and pounds, be&s;ides two fifteenths; which were no &s;ooner granted than the a&s;|&s;embly was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. He did not at all doubt that his negotiation with Scot|land would &s;ucceed; and therefore, that he might have the &s;ub&s;idy in his coffers before the peace &s;hould be concluded, he ordered his commi&s;&s;ioners to levy it with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. The&s;e collectors met with unexpected oppo&s;ition in the county of Cornwal$ the inhabitants of which loudly complained that they &s;hould be &s;addled with &s;uch a grievous impo&s;ition, on account of &s;ome damage which had been done at the other end of the kingdom. The&s;e murmurs were
<PB N="507" REF="5170">
encouraged by one Michael Jo&s;eph, a popular and factious black&s;mith of Bod|min, and Thomas Flammock, a lawyer of a $very turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, who a&s;&s;ured the common people, that the fiefs depending upon the crown were the proper funds a&s;&s;igned for the maintenance of war; that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e fiefs held them on condition of defending the frontiers; that the king ought to apply to them, in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion from Scotland, and not pillage the king|dom, under the &s;anction of parliament. He &s;aid it would be &s;hameful to &s;ubmit to &s;uch impo&s;ition, which was the work of evil mini&s;ters, that made their court to the king at the expence of the poor people; that they ought to take arms in their own defence; without injury to any per&s;on what&s;oever, go and pre|&s;ent a petition to his maje&s;ty, intreating him to ea&s;e them of &s;uch a burthen|&s;ome tax, and puni&s;h his pernicious coun&s;ellors, the chief of whom were arch|bi&s;hop Morton and Sir Reginald Bray, the two mini&s;ters whom he con&s;ulted in all his money tran&s;actions. The populace being thus inflamed, the Lawyer and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> the Black&s;mith offered to conduct them, until they &s;hould be headed by &s;ome per&s;on of quality, which he a&s;&s;ured them would be the ca&s;e; and they forthwith armed them&s;elves with &s;uch weapons as they could procure. Under the di|rection of tho&s;e two incendiaries, they marched through the counties of Devon and Somer&s;et, their numbers continually increa&s;ing in their route. At Taun|ton they murdered a collector, who had been very rigorous in the execution of his office; and this was the only act of violence they committed. At Wells they were joined by the lord Audeley, an unquiet and ambitious nobleman, who, being cho&s;en their general, conducted them to Sali&s;bury and Winche&s;ter, without allowing them to do the lea&s;t injury to the places through which they pa&s;&s;ed. In&s;tead of marching directly to London, according to their original de&s;ign, they turned off towards Kent, in hope of being joined by the people of that county, who were &s;aid to be very zealous for the liberty of the &s;ubject: but they were di&s;appointed in their expectation. The noblemen and freeholders of Kent had taken &s;uch precautions to prevent an in&s;urrection, that the Corni&s;h|men were not joined by one per&s;on in the county: a circum&s;tance which di&s;|couraged a great number of the in&s;urgents to &s;uch a degree, that they retired to their own habitations. The re&s;t, however, animated by the backwardne&s;s of the king, who had made no attempt to &s;top their progre&s;s, continued their march, boa&s;ting that they would either give him battle, or take London, under his eye; and with this re&s;olution they proceeded as far as Blackheath, encamp|ing between El$ham and Greenwich.</P>

<P>When the king fir&s;t heard of this in&s;urrection, he had already rai&s;ed an army for the Scotti&s;h war, and given the command of it to the lord cham|berlain Daubeney; but now he re&s;olved to keep the be&s;t part of the troops in the &s;outhern part of the kingdom, and &s;ent the earl of Surrey with a detach|ment to guard the northern frontiers. Under&s;tanding that the rebels did not wa&s;te the country in their march, he continued inactive, that he migh judge of the di&s;affection that prevailed in the counties through which they pa&s;&s;ed, by the number that would join them in their route: he was not without hope that they would di&s;per&s;e of them&s;elves, tired of the length and hard&s;hips of their march; and, &s;hould they proceed to the neighbourhood of London, he fore&s;aw that they would be more ea&s;ily and effectually cru&s;hed, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from their own country, than they could have been in the we&s;tern parrs of England$
<PB N="508" REF="5180">
The citizens of London were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation at their approach, until they &s;aw the king exert him&s;elf in earne&s;t for their defence, and even place him&s;elf between them and the danger. He no &s;ooner under&s;tood that they had encamped at Blackheath, than he divided his army into three bodies, one of which, commanded by the earl of Oxford, marched round the hill, in order to cut off their retreat, and attack them in the rear, &s;hould it be found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pract$$e that expedient. The &s;econd, under the conduct of the lord Daube$ey, was de&s;tined to charge them in front; and Henry him&s;elf, with the third divi&s;ion, encamped in St. George's Fields, with a view to reinforce the others occa&s;ionally, or throw him&s;elf into London, in ca&s;e of mi&s;chance. The&s;e di&s;po&s;itions being made, he declared that he would give the rebels battle on Monday, though his intention was to engage them on Saturday, which he deemed fortunate in all his enterprizes. By this feint he hoped to find them unprepared; and it &s;ucceeded according to his wi&s;h. On the twenty-&s;econd day of June, towards the clo&s;e of the day, the lord Daubeney marched towards them, in order of battle. Having defeated an advanced guard at Deptford|Bridge, where they made a vigorous &s;tand, he a&s;cended the hill, and &s;ound them pretty far in the heath, drawing up in battalia, not without manife&s;t con|fu&s;ion; for they did not expect to be attacked till Monday, and in that notion &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;urprized. Neverthele&s;s, they fought with uncom|mon courage, though in a tumultuary manner, and killed above three hundred of the king's &s;oldiers, with arrows of a very uncommon length. The lord Dau|beney attacked them with &s;uch fury and precipitation, that he was taken pri|&s;oner in the beginning of the action, but immediately re&s;cued by the valour of his men, who charged with irre&s;i&s;tible fury, and the rebels were routed with great &s;laughter; for when they attempted to fly, they found them&s;elves inter|cepted by the earl of Oxford's divi&s;ion. The lord Audeley, Flammock, and the Black&s;mith, were taken; and of &s;ixteen thou&s;and, to which their number amounted, two thou&s;and fell in the field of battle: as for the re&s;t, they &s;ub|mitted to the king's plea&s;ure. Audeley was beheaded on Tower-Hill; Flam|mock and the Black&s;mith &s;uffered at Tyburn, the latter expre&s;&s;ing great &s;atisfac|tion, that his name &s;hould be famous in after-times; and all the re&s;t were par|doned by proclamation.</P>

<P>While Henry was employed in quelling this rebellion, the king of Scotland, judging this a favourable opportunity, made a &s;econd irruption into England, and inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Norham; but the earl of Surrey marching to its relief, he retired to his own country, whither he was pur&s;ued by the Engli&s;h general, who took the ca&s;tle of Ayton, &s;ituated between Berwick and Edinburgh. The king of England de&s;ired nothing more than a peace with James, by which he would not only be freed from his apprehen&s;ion of Perkin Warbeck, but al&s;o be enabled to &s;ave the &s;ub&s;idy in his own coffers: but he was afraid to make the fir&s;t overtures, le&s;t he &s;hould meet with a repul&s;e. In reflecting upon this &s;ubject, he bethought him&s;elf of a fit agent for nego|tiating a peace between the two nations, without his &s;uffering in point of ho|nour. This was Don Pedro D'Ayala the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, &s;ent by Ferdinand and I&s;abella to conclude the contract of marriage between the prince of Wales<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and the infanta Catherine. This envoy, who enjoyed a great &s;hare of Henry's confidence, undertook to vi&s;it the king of Scotland, and as from him&s;elf pro|po&s;e
<PB N="509" REF="5190">
an accommodation. He accordingly &s;et out for Edinburgh, and executed his commi&s;&s;ion, on pretence that nothing would afford more plea&s;ure to his ma&s;ter the king of Spain, than to &s;ee two monarchs, who were his friends and allies, live in good under&s;tanding with each other. He found the Scotti&s;h king<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to a treaty, that he wrote to Henry, a&s;&s;uring him of &s;ucce&s;s; and a congre&s;s was immediately opened at Ay$on, under the mediation of this amba&s;&s;ador. The greate&s;t difficulty that occurred was on the &s;ubject of Perkin Warbeck, who&s;e per&s;on Henry demanded, and whom James po&s;itively refu&s;ed to deliver. The bi&s;hop of Durham propo&s;ed an interview between the two kings at Newca&s;tle; but the Scot rejected this propo&s;al, ob&s;erving, that how de&s;irous &s;oever he might be of peace, he would not go and beg it in his enemy's country. At length both &s;ides agreed that James &s;hould honourably di&s;mi&s;s the pretended duke of York, and afterwards proceed with the negotiation, as if Perkin had never been in Scotland. In pur&s;uance of this convention, that mo|narch told this adventurer, that he had done every thing in his power to &s;upport him in his preten&s;ions; that he had twice entered England at the head of an army; but that, as the Engli&s;h had refu&s;ed to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, he could not expect that the Scots would, without their concurrence, be able to e&s;tabli&s;h him on the throne of England. He therefore advi&s;ed him to form &s;ome more fea&s;ible plan, and chu&s;e &s;ome other country for the place of his re&s;idence: at the &s;ame time he a&s;&s;ured him, that he would punctually fulfil his promi&s;e, that he &s;hould not repent of having put him&s;elf into his hands; for he &s;hould be honourably accommodated with &s;hips and nece&s;&s;aries for his voyage. Perkin<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir J. Ware.</NOTE> bore his misfortune with a good grace; thanked the king of Scotland for the protection and other favours he had enjoyed from his bounty; and de&s;ired that he and his wife might be conveyed to Ireland. James complied with his re|que&s;t; and he arrived at Cork, where he &s;till found friends and adherents. He had no &s;ooner quitted Scotland, than the amba&s;&s;adors at Ayton &s;igned a treaty of truce for &s;even years, importing, That the two kings &s;hould no$ make war upon each other by them&s;elves, their &s;ubjects, or any other per&s;on what&s;oever: That certain points about which the amba&s;&s;adors could not agree, &s;hould be referred to the arbitration of Ferdinand and I&s;abella: And that the truce &s;hould be prolonged till one year after the death of that party, who &s;hould die before the other.

When they returned to their own country, they pub|licly proclaimed, that the gentlene&s;s with which they had been treated was not owing to the king's mercy, but his apprehen&s;ion of his own &s;ubjects, three fourths of whom were of the &s;ame &s;entiments which they profe&s;&s;ed. The&s;e in|&s;inuations per&s;uading their friends and neighbours that the whole kingdom was ready to take arms again&s;t Henry, they began to a&s;&s;emble in companies, and concert mea&s;ures for making another attempt again&s;t the government. Some of the mo$t zealous among them, under$tanding that Perkin Warbeck was in Ireland, propo&s;ed that he &s;hould be invited over, and cho&s;en general of their intended expedition.

Perkin, finding him&s;elf without re&s;ource, and abandoned by all tho&s;e foreign powers who had formerly countenanced his projects, ac|cepted the invitation, by the advice of his three chief coun&s;ellors, namely, a bankrupt mercer called Herne, one Skelton a taylor, and a &s;crivener of the name of A&s;tley. He forthwith embarked with about &s;eventy men in four &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and, arriving at Whit&s;and-Bay, in September, repaired to Bodmin, where the former in&s;urrection had begun. There being joined with about three thou&s;and men, he publi&s;hed a proclamation, in which he a&s;&s;umed the title of Richard IV. king of England, inveighed bitterly again&s;t Henry Tudor; and e$horted the people, with promi&s;e of extraordinary rewards, to take arms, in or|der to depo&s;e the u&s;urper.

While the truce &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between England and Scotland, &s;ome Scotti$h gentlemen happening to be at Norham, were in&s;ulted by the garri&s;on, and a quarrel en&s;uing, &s;ome of them lo&s;t their lives. Complaint of this out|rage being made to the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, who acted as con&s;ervators of the truce, the affair was treated with &s;uch contempt, that the king of Scotland &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors into England, to demand immediate &s;atisfaction. Henry, who carefully avoided all cau&s;es of rupture with James, di&s;owned the violators of the truce, and forthwith appointed envoys, to terminate the difference in an<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1499.</NOTE> amicable manner. It was in the cour&s;e of this negotiation, that James pro|po&s;ed a match between him&s;elf and Margaret the elde&s;t daughter of Henry, than which nothing could be more agreeable to the king of England. After the truce was renewed at Stirling, with the addition of &s;ome new arti$les, Rich|ard Fo$ bi&s;hop of Durham rec$ived a commi&s;&s;ion, to &s;ettle the conditions of<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$mer.</NOTE> the marriage, which was actually celebrated in the &s;equel.</P>

<P>Tho$ Henry had by this time triumphed over all his enemies, and the pope had granted a di&s;pen&s;ation for the marriage of his &s;on Arthur with Catherine of Arragon, Ferdinand &s;eemed &s;till aver&s;e to this match while Hen|ry$s title was liable to the lea&s;t objection. That cautio$s Spaniard &s;eemed to harbour &s;ome doubts concerning the impo&s;ture of Warbeck; and even hinted, that Henry's throne could not be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed while any prince of the hou&s;e of York remained alive. The king of England was &s;o intent upon the Spani&s;h alliance, and &s;o tired of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive in&s;urrections by which his reign had been di&s;turbed, that he re&s;olved to &s;acrifice the youth called Perkin, as well as Edward earl of Warwick, to his intere&s;t and &s;afety. Edward, the &s;on of George duke of Clarence, had &s;ince the death of his uncle Richard been clo&s;ely confined in the Tower, debarred of the benefit of air, exerci&s;e, and conver&s;ation; and kept in &s;uch ignorance, that he could &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;h the dome&s;tic animals<NOTE PLACE="marg">P$$$d. V$rg$l. Ha$$.</NOTE> by name. Perkin Warbeck, who doubtle&s;s, fe$t that de&s;ire of liberty which is &s;o natural to the mind of man, and had rea&s;on to dread every thing from Henry's di&s;po&s;ition, was permitted to conver&s;e with this haple&s;s nobleman, as well as with the dome&s;tics of lord Digby, lieutenant of the Tower; and, in all probability, he was indulged with this permi&s;&s;ion by the connivance of the king, who hoped that his enterprizing geni$$, and in&s;inuating addre&s;s, would engage the &s;imp$e earl of Warwick in &s;ome project, that would furni&s;h a pre|text for taking away their lives under colour o$ ju&s;tice. Perkin fell into the &s;nare, according to Henry's expectation: he t$mpered with Warwick, and gained over four &s;ervants of Sir John Digby, who are &s;a$d to have undertaken the murder of their ma&s;ter, that they might &s;ecure the keys of the Tower, and e&s;cape with the two pri&s;oners, to &s;ome part of the kingdom, where a new in&s;urrection might be rai&s;ed in favour of the pretender.</P>

<P>That the danger might appear the more imminent and pre&s;&s;ing, &s;o as to ju&s;tify the &s;teps which Henry intended to take, another di&s;turbance was rai&s;ed at the &s;ame time$ in Kent, where a young man called Ralph Wilford, the &s;on of a cordwainer, per&s;onated the earl of Warwick, under the conduct and direction of one Patrick, an Augu&s;tine monk, who in public &s;ermons exhorted the people to take arms in his favour. This friar, who $ad been u&s;ed as a tool by the king's

emi&s;&s;aries, was arre&s;ted together with his pupil; and Wilford was hanged with|out ceremony, but the tutor obtained his pardon. This was the prelude to the fate of Perkin and the earl of Warwick, who&s;e pretended plot being now di&s;covered, Perkin was tried at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and being convicted on the evi|dence of the lord Digby's &s;ervants, was hanged at Tyburn, with John Walter mayor of Cork, who had con&s;tanly adhered to his cau&s;e, in all the vici$$itudes of his fortune. Blewet and A&s;twood, two of Digby's &s;ervants, underwent the &s;ame fate: but, &s;ix other per&s;ons condemned as accomplices in the &s;ame con&s;piracy, were pardoned.

<P>About this period, the peace of E&s;taples between France and Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Lewis was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the more inclined to live on good terms with England, as he had formed the de&s;ign to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Milan, by means of a league with the Vene|tians. He accordingly joined the&s;e confederates, and attacked Ludovico Sforz$, &s;overeign of that dutchy, who was obliged to fly for refuge to the em|peror, after having lo&s;t all his dominions. But the ca&s;tle of Milan, and Genoa, of which he had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, voluntarily &s;ubmitted to Lewis. Pope Alexander VI. having publi&s;hed a jubilee for the beginning of the century, permitted tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who lived at a great di&s;tance from Rome, to pur|cha&s;e the privilege of the fe&s;tival, without being obliged to vi&s;it the churches of that city. In order to collect the &s;ums ari$ing from this indulgence, he &s;ent agents into all the &s;tates of Chri&s;tendom; and employed a Spaniard called Ga&s;|par Pons, for that purpo&s;e in England, where he rai&s;ed a large contribution. This nuncio was directed to inform the king, that his holine&s;s had re&s;olved to publi&s;h a cru&s;ade again&s;t the Turks, and even to go in per&s;on with the Engli&s;h monarch, the Venetians, and the princes of Italy, to attack Con&s;tantinople by &s;ea, while the other powers of Europe &s;hould fall upon them in Thrace, Greece, and different parts of the continent. Henry plainly perceived that Alexander's drift was to ama&s;s money by contributions for this expedition; but, he di&s;|&s;embled his opinion, expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t zeal for the &s;ucce&s;s of the enter|prize; offered to furni&s;h a large proportion of men and money; to &s;erve under his holine&s;s in per&s;on; and demanded, that &s;ome &s;trong places on the coa&s;t of Italy might be put into his hands, to &s;erve as a retreat, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. He even appointed amba&s;&s;adors to go and treat with the pontiff on this &s;ubject; and made &s;uch a parade of his zeal for the intere&s;t of religion, that the knig$ts

But as this was a chimeri|cal project which Alexander had no intention to execute: he enjoyed the credit of his forwardne&s;s, without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to the lea&s;t expence; and the other potentates of E$rope receiving the pope's propo&s;al with great coldne&s;s and indifference, the whole &s;cheme vani&s;hed into &s;moke.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baco$.</NOTE> England being grievou&s;ly afflicted with the plague, Henry, after having &s;everal times changed the place of his re&s;idence, retired with his queen and family to Calais, where he received an emba&s;&s;y from the archduke Philip, de&s;iring a friendly interview; and the king agreed to meet him in the church of St. Peter, which &s;tands without the gates of Calais, as the archduke expre&s;&s;ed a reluctance to enter a fortified city. At the time fixed for their meeting, Henry being informed of his approach, rode out to receive him on hor&s;eback, and Philip alighting, ran up to hold his &s;tirrup; but Henry would not admit of &s;uch humiliation, and they embraced each other with marks of the mo&s;t cordial af|fection. Then they entered the church, where they had a long conference, in which the archduke expre&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t eager de&s;ire to live in friend&s;hip with the Engli&s;h monarch, whom he addre&s;&s;ed with the appellation of his good patron, father, and protector. During Henry's re&s;idence at Calais, he was al&s;o vi&s;ited by the governor of Picardy, and bailiff of Amiens, &s;ent by the French king, to congratulate him upon his coming to the continent; and notify his conque&s;t of Milan. That prince, in order to te&s;tify his good will to the king of England, had &s;ollicited and obtained a bull from the pope, declaring him excommunicated, &s;hould he ever fail in the yearly payments to Henry, &s;tipu|lated in the treaty of E&s;taples. The pope, at the &s;ame time, granted a di&s;pen|&s;ation for the marriage of James king of Scotland, with the prince&s;s Margaret, tho', on account of her tender years, the con&s;ummation was po&s;tponed.</P>

<P>Henry being now at peace with all Europe, and his dominions enjoying the mo&s;t profound repo&s;e, the avarice of his di&s;po&s;ition had lei&s;ure to exert it&s;elf, and his de&s;ire of ama&s;&s;ing became every day more and more rapa|cious. As he had no longer any pretence for demanding &s;ub&s;idies from parlia|ment, he re&s;olved to drain the party of Warbeck, until they &s;hould be quite exhau&s;ted. On the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the adherents of this pretender were &s;till &s;ubject to the rigour of the laws, he in&s;i&s;ted upon their being indulged with &s;eparate pardons, which they did not at all &s;ollicit; and compelled them to pay largely for this indulgence. He appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;et on foot a new inquiry about tho&s;e who had in any manner a&s;&s;erted or favoured the revolt of the Black&s;mith, and that of Perkin Warbeck. The&s;e inqui&s;itors were im|powered to amerce at di&s;cretion every individual who &s;hould have the benefit of the pardon; and even to &s;eize the effects of the decea&s;ed, &s;hould their heirs refu&s;e to make a compo&s;ition. Such oppre&s;&s;ion augmented the popular cla|mour again&s;t Henry, and was in a great mea&s;ure attributed to the coun&s;els of cardinal Morton archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who died at this period, very little regretted by the Engli&s;h. He was &s;ucceeded in his metropolitan &s;ee by Henry Dean bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury; and now the nation perceived, that Henry's avarice and extortion were not the effects of Morton's advice, but qualities inherent in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry$$r.</NOTE> his own con&s;titution. Never was king of England more hated by his &s;ubjects, though this hatred was mingled with fear, produced by his uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s, and the opinion of his great ability both as a monarch and a politician. All

the powers upon the continent courted his alliance; and all the malecontents of England were overawed into forbearance.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; LXIII.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this felicity, he was not a little di&s;turbed by an accident which at this juncture encroached upon his repo&s;e. The earl of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1501.</NOTE> Suffolk, nephew to king Edward IV. and brother to the earl of Lincoln, who had fallen in the battle of Stoke, chanced to kill a man, in his pa&s;&s;ion; and, though he was a branch of the hou&s;e of York, the king con&s;ented to indulge him with a pardon; but, in order to leave a &s;tigma upon his character, he ob|liged him to appear per&s;onally, and plead his pardon in public. The earl being of an haughty di&s;po&s;ition, re&s;ented this di&s;grace &s;o deeply, that he retired in di&s;gu&s;t to his aunt Margaret dutche&s;s dowager of Flanders; and Henry was not a little &s;tartled at his retreat. In order to anticipate any de&s;igns he might<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE> hatch to his prejudice, he &s;ent over emi&s;&s;aries, who by dint of promi&s;es and profe&s;|&s;ions, per&s;uaded him to return and be reconciled to the government. Henry's throne being now &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that there was hardly a po&s;&s;ibility to &s;hake it, Ferdinand king of Arragon, parted with his daughter Catherine, who arriv|ing in England in the month of October, was married to Arthur prince of Wales, and the nuptials were celebrated at London, with great pomp and &s;olemnity, on the fourteenth day of November, the prince being then turned of fifteen, and the lady about the age of eighteen. Her dower amounted to two hundred thou&s;and ducats in money, jewels and plate; and a third part of the principality of Wales, dukedom of Cornwal, and earldom of Che&s;ter, was a&s;&s;igned to her as a jointure, provided her hu&s;band &s;hould die before his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne.</P>

<P>This match was &s;ucceeded by the contract of another marriage, be|tween<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the king of Scotland, and Henry's daughter Margaret, on whom her father be&s;towed a portion of thirty thou&s;and crowns. The marriage-treaty was rati|fied by the Scotti&s;h amba&s;&s;adors at London, on the twenty-fourth day of Janu|ary;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1502.</NOTE> and the nuptials were &s;olemnized by proxy, amid&s;t the rejoicings of the people, who hoped the mi&s;chiefs attending the mutual enmity of the two king|doms would cea&s;e, by virtue of this alliance, tho' perhaps, they did not fore|&s;ee the union which it afterwards produced. When this affair was debated in council, an Engli&s;h nobleman ob&s;erved, that if Henry &s;hould &s;urvive his male-i&s;&s;ue, the crown would devolve to the king of Scotland; to which in&s;inu|ation Henry replied, that in &s;uch a ca&s;e Scotland would become an acce&s;&s;ion to England, as the &s;maller would always be &s;wallowed up in the greater dominion. On this occa&s;ion a treaty of perpetual peace between the two nations was &s;ign|ed and confirmed, together with certain articles for preventing incur&s;ions on either &s;ide; but, the con&s;ummation of marriage was, on account of the tender years of the prince&s;s, po&s;tponed till the following year, when the king accom|pained her on her way as far as Colli-We&s;ton, where he con&s;igned her and her attendants to the care of the earl of Northumberland, who, with a con&s;iderable retinue of noblemen and ladies, conveyed her to the king her hu&s;band at Edinburgh. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon.</NOTE></P>

<P>The joy produced by this marriage was &s;oon damped by the death of Arthur prince of Wales, who did not &s;urvive his nuptials above five months. He died at Ludlow-Ca&s;tle, univer&s;ally regretted by the Engli&s;h nation, who had conceived happy omens from his promi&s;ing talents; and, in about three months after his decea&s;e, his brother Henry was, in the twelfth year of his

During the cour&s;e of this year the emperor Maximilian &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to England, to propo&s;e a league again&s;t the Turks, and to borrow money of Henry, who cho&s;e rather to pre&s;ent him with ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, as a free gift for that purpo&s;e, than to en|gage in the league, or begin a traffic of lending money to &s;uch a beggarly potentate.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He even rejoiced at her death, as an event that freed him from a hateful rival in his title to the throne. He was now rai&s;ed to the very &s;ummit of pro&s;perity. He lived in peace with all his neighbours, and all dome&s;tic troubles had cea&s;ed. But, he was re&s;olved that his &s;ubjects &s;hould not &s;hare in his felicity; for, his avarice becoming every day more and more in&s;atiable, he employed all his invention in devi&s;ing new me|thods of extortion. For the&s;e &s;ordid purpo&s;es he retained two infamous mi|ni&s;ters called Emp&s;on and Dudley, who followed the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, and practi&s;ed all its &s;ubterfuges and chicanery, in oppre&s;&s;ing the &s;ubjects with fal&s;e accu&s;ations and impri&s;onment, until they were fain to purcha&s;e what was called a mitigation, with the be&s;t part of their &s;$b&s;tance. Such was their in&s;olence, that they did not even ob&s;erve the common forms of ju&s;tice; but, proceeded with the mo&s;t arbitrary licence, to attack pretended delinquents, and try them in private, without fair examination o$ verdict of jury: and the&s;e acts of violence they ex|erci&s;ed under the authority of the king, who &s;hared the fruits of their oppre&s;|&s;ion. He even in&s;i&s;ted upon their keeping regular accompts of this &s;candalous commerce, and maintained a kind of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, even in the practice of corruption&mdash;. He let &s;lip no occa&s;ion for ama&s;&s;ing money, how&s;oever mean or ungrateful it might be. One day, while he was magnificently entertained by the earl of Oxford, to who&s;e &s;ervices he was in great mea&s;ure indebted for the crown he enjoyed, he perceived a greater number of dome&s;tics in livery than the law allowed him to maintain; and turning to the earl, <Q>&startq;My lord (&s;aid he) I have heard much of your ho&s;pitality; but, it exceeds report.

<P>Such conduct in the king and his mini&s;ters could not $ail to render them extremely odious to the people, who murmured ince&s;&s;antly again&s;t the government; and this di&s;content encouraged the earl of Suffolk, who&s;e for|tune was by this time greatly reduced by his own extravagance, to form new projects again&s;t the per&s;on and government of Henry. He had acquired a degree of popularity as the &s;urviving branch of the hou&s;e of York: he privately engaged &s;ome per&s;ons of con&s;ideration in his intere&s;t; and then retired to Flanders, in hope of receiving countenance and &s;uccour from the old dutche&s;s of Burgundy. The king$ alarmed at his retreat, and eager to know his &s;cheme, with the names of his a&s;$ociates, repeated the expedient he had u&s;ed in the ca&s;e of Perkin War|beck. Sir Robert Cur&s;on, govern$r of the ca&s;tle of H$mmes, being properly in&s;tructed, abandoned his charge, on pretence of having been injured by the king; and retiring to Flanders, off$red his &s;ervice to the earl of Suffolk. H$ acted his part with &s;uch dexterity, that in a little time he in&s;$nuated him&s;elf into the confidence of that nobleman; and &s;oon di&s;covered all his a&s;&s;ociates. The in$elligence was forthwith conveyed to Henry, who immediately i&s;&s;ued warrants for arre&s;ting his own brother-in-law William Courtney earl of Devon|&s;hire$ hu&s;band to the prince&s;s Catherine$ daughter o$ Edward IV. William De la Pole brother to the earl of Suffolk, Sir James Tyrrel, and Sir John Wyndham; George lord Abergavenny, and Sir Thomas Green, were appre|hended at the &s;ame time, upon &s;light &s;u&s;picion, but &s;oon di&s;charged. The earl of Devon&s;hire, and De la Pole, tho' nothing material appeared again&s;t them, were detained pri&s;oners during the king's life. Tyrrel, who had been con|cerned in the death of Edward V. was beheaded together with Wyndham; and &s;everal others of inferior note were executed as traitors. Henry, willing to be &s;till better informed, touching the particular de&s;igns of the earl of Suffolk, took a very extraordinary method to maintain Cur&s;on in the confidence of that nobleman. He publi&s;hed in St. Paul's church, the bull of pope Innocent VIII. denouncing the cen&s;ures of the church again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould di&s;turb his government; and cau&s;ed the earl of Suffolk and Sir Robert Cur&s;on to be ex|communicated by name. When this emi$&s;ary had di&s;covered all the earl's &s;e|crets, he r$turned to England; and was readmitted into the king's favour, which, however, he did not enjoy without the cur&s;es of the people, who abhor|red his perfidy. Suffolk finding him&s;elf betrayed, led for &s;ome time a vagrant life in Germany, and at length returned to Flanders, where the archduke took him under his protection, after the death of the dutche&s;s dowager.</P>

This complai&s;ant parliament de&s;ired him to accept of forty thou&s;and pounds, in lieu of aids, for knighting his elde&s;t &s;on Arthur, and the marriage of his daughter Margaret; and he, in token of his moderation and regard to his &s;ubjects, remitted one fourth of that &s;um, the re&s;t being levied on the cities, boroughs, towns, and landholders of the kingdom. He likewi&s;e filled his coffers by an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, at|tainting a great number of per&s;ons who had been concerned in the in&s;urrections from the very beginning of his reign; as well as by another, di&s;annulling all patents and grants enjoyed by tho&s;e who either refu&s;ed to appear, when &s;um|mo$ed, in the king's defence again&s;t enemies and rebels, or retired from that &s;ervice without licence. The patents of goals were likewi&s;e re&s;umed and re|annexed to the &s;heriffwicks; foreign manufactures of &s;ilk were prohibited; a law was enacted again&s;t the currency of dimini&s;hed &s;ilver pieces, which under|went a recoinage: and &s;everal regulations were made for the maintenance of ci|vil policy. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;ources of wealth, Henry, before the expi|ration of the year, i&s;&s;ued commi&s;&s;ions for a general benevolence, though he could not a&s;&s;ign the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a rea&s;on for this impo&s;ition; and the city of London was fain to pay five thou&s;and marks for the confirmation of its liber|ties. Not &s;atisfied with the payment of the &s;econd moiety of Catherine's por|tion, the &s;ub&s;idy granted by parliament, the confi&s;cation of e&s;tates, the profits of a recoinage, the benevolence, and redemption of the city's liberties, he &s;till continued to grind the face of the &s;ubjects by means of Emp&s;on and Dudley, who ama$&s;ed great fortunes, as the tools of his rapacity.</P>

<P>In order to make &s;ome &s;ort of atonement for the&s;e extortions, and do &s;omething that might recommend him to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, he or|dered the body of king Henry VI$ to be removed from Wind&s;or $o We&s;tmin&s;ter, where it was interred $ith great pomp; and applied to the pope for a bull to canonize that monarch: b$t the miracles, attributed to that prince after his death, were &s;o ill a&s;&s;erted, that his ho$$ne&s;s would not admit him to a place among the &s;aints, without &s;uch a con&s;ideration as Henry did not think proper to afford; and therefore the de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide. I&s;abel, queen of Ca&s;tile, dying in November, her hu&s;band Ferdinand immediately notified her decea&s;e to Henry, giving him to under&s;tand, that &s;he had appointed him (Ferdinand) admini&s;trator of the kingdom of Ca&s;tile, for their daughter Joan, married to Philip archduke of Au&s;tria. This prince, being engaged in a war with the duke of G$elderland, could not immediately repair to Spain to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this inheritance, and therefore connived, for the pre&s;ent, at the admini&s;tration of his father-in-law; re&s;olving, however, to deprive him of it with the fir&s;t op|portunity.
<PB N="519" REF="5290">
On the other hand, Ferdinand, by virtue of I&s;abel's la$t will, pre|tended to enjoy the admini&s;tration till his dying day. This was a very inte|re&s;ting difference to Henry, who re&s;embled Ferdinand not only in his di&s;po|&s;ition, but even in the nature of his &s;ituation. He knew the majority of his &s;ubjects looked upon his late con&s;ort Elizabeth as the rightful queen of Eng|land; and that her right had now, of con&s;equence, devolved to the prince of Wales, her &s;on and lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He, therefore, con&s;idered the termination of the difference between Ferdinand and Philip, as a precedent for or again&s;t his own title. He was afraid that Philip would engage in a league with Lewis XII. and the emperor, in order to expel his father-in-law from Ca&s;tile, in which ca&s;e he &s;hould be obliged to &s;upport his ally again&s;t three powerful adver&s;aries. He fore&s;aw that &s;uch contention would involve him in new dangers, and drain his coffers which he had been at &s;uch pains to fill, and in the contemplation of which he placed his chief happine&s;s. This was the goal to which all his endea|vours<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1505.</NOTE> tended. He formed the de&s;ign of e&s;pou&s;ing the widow of Ferdinand king of Naples, that he might enjoy the great dower which had been a&s;&s;igned to her in that kingdom: and perhaps he thought, that, in con&s;equence of this match, he might be cho&s;en arbiter of the difference &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the kings of France and Arragon, touching the territories of Naples. That kingdom had been conquered and divided between them, though this partition was at|tended by a quarrel, which produced two battles, and the&s;e proved fatal to the French intere&s;t in Italy.</P>

<P>Henry was &s;o eager to know the di&s;po&s;ition of the Ca&s;tilians to|wards Ferdinand, and the particulars relating to the per&s;onal qualities and cir|cum&s;tances of the queen of Naples, that he &s;ent three per&s;ons in whom he could confide; namely, Francis Mar&s;en, James Braybrook, and John Stile, to obtain intelligence on the &s;pot. They &s;et out on pretence of travelling for plea&s;ure; but they were furni&s;hed with letters of compliment from Catherine prince&s;s of Wales to her aunt and niece the two dowagers of Naples; and they were in&s;tructed to &s;end home an exact de&s;cription of the complexion, features, &s;tature, age, health, cu&s;toms, deportment, and di&s;po&s;ition of the younger queen; together with a circum&s;tantial account of the dower &s;he enjoyed. How&s;oever<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holling&s;hed.</NOTE> he might have reli&s;hed the qualifications of her per&s;on, he dropped his matri|monial &s;cheme, when he under&s;tood that although the &s;ettlement of that prin|ce&s;s was very con&s;iderable, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the marriage-contract, yet &s;he had been reduced to an uncertain pen&s;ion &s;ince Ferdinand had &s;ubdued the king|dom. The intelligence which Henry's agents &s;ent from Ca&s;tile, was not much more agreeable. Ferdinand &s;till continued in the po&s;t of admini&s;trator, which he hoped to maintain for life, partly by his influence with Philip's coun|&s;ellors, &s;ome of whom he had gained over to his intere&s;t; and partly by threatening that, in ca&s;e the archduke &s;hould prove refractory, he would take another wife, and beget an heir to the kingdom of Arragon: but, at the &s;ame time, the nobles and people of Spain were better affected to Philip in right of his wife than to Ferdinand, who had loaded them with burthen&s;ome impo|&s;itions. Henry's &s;ecret envoys gave him to under&s;tand, that there was actually a project of marriage between Ferdinand and madam de Foix, which would certainly take place &s;hould Philip attempt to thwart his father-in-law.

<P>Mean while Philip and Jean were proclaimed king and queen of Ca&s;til$ at Bru&s;&s;els; though they were prevented from going to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that kingdom by the war of Guelderland and the pregnancy of the queen, who was in a little time delivered of a prince&s;s called Mary, afterwards queen of Hungary. The war being happily terminated$ and Joan in a condition to travel, Philip equipped a numerous fleet, and with his queen embarked on the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1506.</NOTE> tenth day of January. In the channel they were overtaken by a violent &s;torm that di&s;per&s;ed their &s;hips, and the ve&s;&s;el that carried Philip and his confort was driven into the harbour of Weymouth in Dor$et&s;hire. The country people, alarmed at the appearance of &s;uch a numerous navy, took to their arms. Sir Thomas Trenchard, advancing at the head of &s;ome troops, no &s;ooner learned that the king and queen of Ca&s;tile were landed, than he went to offer his re|&s;pects to there in per&s;on, and begged they would do him the honour to lodge at his hou&s;e, until the king &s;hould be informed of their arrival. Philip, per|ceiving that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of re-imbarking immediately, accepted this invitation with a good grace. Henry, being appri&s;ed of their landing, &s;ent the earl of Arundel to compliment them in his name, to a&s;&s;ure them that he would, with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, have the plea&s;ure of embracing them; and in the mean time that they might command in his dominions. Philip, in order to $$orten the vi&s;it, &s;et out immediately for the court at Wind&s;or, where he and his confort were received with all the marks of the mo&s;t cordial friend|&s;hip: though Henry was re&s;olved to derive &s;ome advantage from the accident that brought them into his dominions. He propo&s;ed that as Philip had changed his condition, in becoming king of Ca&s;tile, the treaty of commerce between England and the Low Countries &s;hould be renewed. That prince com|prehending perfectly well the delicate nature of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, did not think proper to make any objections to this propo&s;al, and the treaty was re|newed, with &s;ome alteration in favour of the Engli&s;h; among other things they &s;uppre&s;&s;ed that article of the former treaty by which Philip's &s;ubjects were permitted to fi$h on the coa&s;t of England.

<P>This affair being fini&s;hed, Henry propo&s;ed a marriage between him&s;elf and Philip's &s;i&s;ter Margaret, widow of the duke of Savoy; and the king of Ca&s;tile, being well plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of &s;uch an alliance, the marriage-contract was immediately &s;ettled; Philip engaging to pay three hun|dred thou&s;and crowns, in lieu of a dower to his &s;i&s;ter, together with an annuity of three thou&s;and eight hundred and fifty.

But the king had re&s;olved that his royal gue&s;ts &s;hould not quit his dominions until the earl's arrival; and, in order to di&s;gui&s;e the re&s;traint, he entertained them with fea&s;ting and pa&s;times: through which, however, Philip ea&s;ily perceived his intention, and therefore expre&s;&s;ed no de&s;ire of departing, un|til the earl was actually &s;ecured.

<P>On his arrival at Ca&s;tile, he and his con&s;ort were &s;o much ca|re&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards, that Ferdinand did not think proper to in&s;i&s;t upon the admini&s;tration, but retired to his own kingdom of Arragon. Philip dying in a few months after he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, his queen was &s;o overwhelmed with grief, that &s;he lo&s;t her rea&s;on; and the government of Ca&s;tile reverted to her father Ferdinand, who is &s;aid to have u&s;ed no endeavour for her cure, le&s;t he &s;hould have been &s;ent back to Arragon.

He inhe|rited a natural fund of &s;agacity, which was improved by &s;tudy and experi|ence; nor was he deficient in per&s;onal bravery, or political courage. He was cool, clo&s;e, cunning, dark, di&s;tru&s;tful, and de&s;igning; and, of all the princes who had &s;at upon the Engli&s;h throne, the mo&s;t fordid, &s;elfi&s;h, and ignoble. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a peculiar manner the art of turning all his dome&s;tic troubles, and all his foreign di&s;putes, to his own advantage: hence he acquired the ap|pellation of the Engli&s;h Solomon; and all the powers of the continent courted his alliance on account of his wealth, wi&s;dom, and uninterrupted pro&s;perity. The nobility he excluded entirely from the admini&s;tration of public affairs, and employed clergymen and lawyers, who, as they had no intere&s;t in the nation, and depended intirely upon his favour, were more ob&s;equious to his will, and ready to concur in all his arbitrary mea&s;ures. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be owned he was a wi&s;e legi&s;lator, cha&s;te, temperate, a&s;&s;iduous in the exerci&s;e of religious duties; decent in his deportment, and exact in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, when his own private intere&s;t was not concerned; though he fre|quently u&s;ed religion and ju&s;tice as cloaks for perfidy and oppre&s;&s;ion. His &s;oul was continually actuated by two ruling pa&s;&s;ions, equally ba&s;e and unkingly; namely, the fear of lo&s;ing his crown, and the de&s;ire of ama&s;&s;ing riches; and the&s;e motives influenced his whole conduct. Neverthele&s;s, his apprehen&s;ion and avarice redounded on the whole to the advantage of the nation. The fir&s;t induced him to depre&s;s the nobility, and aboli&s;h the feudal tenures, which rendered them equally formidable to the prince and the people; and his ava|rice prompted him to encourage indu&s;try and trade, becau&s;e it improved his cu&s;toms, and enriched his &s;ubjects, whom he could afterwards pillage at di&s;cretion.</P>

<P>HENRY VIII. the &s;ole &s;urviving &s;on of the late king, a&s;cended the throne in the eighteenth year of his age, with all the advantages that &s;uch a young prince could enjoy. His kingdom was free from all dome|&s;tic troubles; his neighbours courted his friend&s;hip; his coffers were full of money; and he &s;ucceeded a prince, who&s;e avarice &s;erved as a foil to his libera|lity: &s;o that his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne could not but be agreeable to the Eng|li&s;h nation. His father, with a view to detach him from the con&s;ideration of &s;tate-affairs, had engaged him in the &s;tudy of &s;chool-learning, and he made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the languages, theology, and the philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;to|tle. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this learning, added to the impetuo&s;ity of a pa&s;&s;io|nate temper, and the contemplation of his own per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, which were really extraordinary, in&s;pired him with &s;uch a &s;hare of &s;elf-conceit as laid him open to the penetration and artifice of other potentates. He was frank, open, and o&s;tentatious. His father was not more penurious than he was prodigal; and what was &s;till more remarkable; the earl of Surry, who had e$|joyed the po&s;t of lord high trea&s;urer in the former reign, on account of his re|&s;embling the king in par&s;imony and backwardne&s;s to part with money, &s;till maintained his place, by his conformity to the expen&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition of young Henry; &s;o that he &s;eemed to change his nature with his &s;overeign.</P>

<P>While preparations were making for the funeral of the decea&s;ed king, who was interred with incredible magnificence, the new mo$$rch retired to the Tower, in order to con&s;ult his father's mini&s;ters, about the mea&s;ures nece&s;|&s;ary to be taken in the beginning of his reign. The lord Stafford, brother to the duke of Buckingham, was arre&s;ted upon &s;ome fal&s;e information; but &s;oon relea&s;ed, and created earl of Wilt&s;hire. The bi&s;hop$ic of Durham being vacant, by the tran&s;lation of Chri&s;topher B$mbridge to the &s;ee of York, the king be|&s;towed it on Thom$s Ruth$l doctor of law, and member of the privy council. He likewi&s;e confirmed an amne&s;ty in favour of his &s;ubjects, which his father $ad granted on his death-bed: tho' this did not extend to all delinquents; for, he &s;oon publi&s;hed a proclamation, inviting his people to prefer complaints again&s;t tho&s;e who had oppre&s;&s;ed them, on pretence of maintaining the prerogative; and immediately an infinite number of petitions was pre&s;ented again&s;t Emp&s;on and Dudley, who being examined before the council, were committed to the Tow|er, as victims devoted to de&s;truction. As they had &s;hel$ered t$em&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, under the &s;hadow of the law, that they could not be condemned for their exactions, they were tried on a frivolous accu&s;ation, of a de&s;ign to rebel again&s;t the reigning prince; and received &s;entence of death for a crime of which they were intirely innocent. Dudley was tried in July at London, and Emp&s;on convicted at Northampton in October; but the &s;entences were not executed, until the parliament confirmed them by an act of attainder.</P>

<P>The next affair that employed the king's attention, was his marriage with his brother's widow, which he had not yet con&s;ummated. Notwith&s;tand|ing the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation, young Henry, at the de&s;ire of his father, who had in all probability laid &s;ome &s;cheme for deceiving Ferdinand, no &s;ooner attained to the fourteenth year of his age, than he prote&s;ted in a formal manner again&s;t the con&s;ent he had given to this match; tho' this prote&s;tation was kept &s;o &s;ecret, that it never came to light until it was thought nece&s;&s;ary that the public &s;hould be made acquainted with the tran&s;action. Ferdinand, as &s;oon as he was in|formed of old Henry's death, inve&s;ted the count de Fuen&s;alida, his amba&s;&s;ador in England, with full power to renew the treaty of alliance which had been concluded between him and the late king; and at the &s;ame time, he ordered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polyd. Virgil.</NOTE> him to demand the confirmation and execution of that relating to his daugh|ter's &s;econd marriage. When the amba&s;&s;ador delivered his memorial on this &s;ubject, the council was a&s;&s;embled, to deliberate and give their advice, whe|th$r or not the king ought to con&s;ummate the marriage. Warham archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, affirmed, that it was without precedent in a Chri&s;tian land; that he doubted, whether the pope had power to di&s;pen&s;e with the former mar|riage$ and therefore he looked upon this as unnatural ince&s;t. His opinion was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by Fox bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who in&s;i&s;ted upon the un|limited power ve&s;ted in the vicar of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and expatiated upon the con|veniencies of the match, as well as upon the danger of incen&s;ing Ferdinand, and the virtues of the prince&s;s, who declared &s;he was &s;till a virgin; and referred to the examination of matrons for the truth of her allegations. The king him|&s;elf e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;entiments of Fox; and the archbi&s;hop de&s;i&s;ting from his op|po&s;ition, through fear of exa&s;perating pope Julius II. one of the mo&s;t enter|prizing pontiffs that had ever filled the papal chair, the council decreed, that the marriage &s;hould be con&s;ummated, tho' not before the prince&s;s &s;hould have

<P>Henry, in the beginning of his reign, addicted him&s;elf wholly to plea|&s;$res and pa&s;time, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive nature; &s;o that the old bi|&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was extremely chagrined at the di&s;&s;ipation of that trea&s;ur$ which Henry VII. had be$towed &s;uch pains in ama&s;&s;ing. He complained Ioudly on this &s;ubject, and exclaimed in particular again&s;t the earl of Surry$ for en|couraging the king in &s;uch exce&s;$es: but, perceiving that all his remon&s;trance$ were di$$egarded at a court which was become the &s;eat of &s;en&s;uality, and that his influence declined apace, he endeavoured to &s;upplant Surry, who was his rival in the king's favour, by introducing Thomas Wol&s;ey, on who&s;e capacity and attachment he could depend. This eccle&s;ia&s;tic was the &s;on of an ob&s;cure butcher at Ip&s;wich, who already began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by his uncommon talents and addre&s;s; and the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter fore&s;eeing, that he would &s;oon in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the king's good graces, procured for him the place of almone$ to his maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, the treaty between England and the Scot|ti&s;h king was renewed and confirmed, by the mini&s;try of the bi&s;hop of Mur|ray, who had come to England, with compliments of congratulation from his brother-in-law, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The emperor Maximilian &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y of the &s;ame nature: and Henry appointed Chri&s;topher Bam|bridge archbi&s;hop of York, his envoy at the court of Rome, to which he had repaired, to &s;ollicit the confirmation of his holine&s;s, upon his being tran&s;lated to the &s;ee of York. It was the intere&s;t of the king of England to maintain an amba&s;&s;ador at Rome for intelligence at this juncture, when pope Julius was employed in forming a powerful confederacy of the European princes. He had laid the de$ign of reannexing to the holy &s;ee all the dominions of which it had been di&s;membered; and the&s;e being chiefly in the hands of the Veneti|ans, he re&s;olved to humble that in&s;olent republic. His project was reli&s;hed by the king of France, becau&s;e they had encroached upon his dutchy of Milan; the emperor was very well di&s;po&s;ed to concur in any mea&s;ure by which he might regain &s;ome footing in Italy, which had belonged to his predece&s;&s;ors; and Ferdinand was glad of an opportunity to retrieve, without repayment, &s;ome places in the kingdom of Naples, which he had pawned to the Venetians for a $um of money. The duke of Ferrara wanted to recover Rovigo, and the Pole&s;in, which were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Venetians; and the Florentines were in|cen&s;ed again&s;t that republic, for having &s;upported Pi&s;a, which they wanted to &s;ubdue. The&s;e were the motives of the famous league formed again&s;t Venice, at Cambrary, where the congre&s;s was opened, on pretence of accommodating the difference between Charles of Au&s;tria, and the duke of Guelderland. In order to deceive the &s;pies of Venice, they at fir&s;t concluded a treaty of perpe|tual peace between the pope, the emperor, and the kings of France and Spain: but, at the &s;ame time, they ratified an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive league again&s;t the

Venetians. In compliance with the conditions of this alliance, Lewis marched from Milan in the beginning of April, at the head of a numerous army; while the pope's forces entered Romagna, tho&s;e of Arragon invaded Lombardy; the duke of Ferrara fell upon the Pole&s;in; and, the emperor remained at Trent, that he might be at hand to reap the fruits of their &s;ucce&s;s. In the mean time, the Venetians took the field, under the conduct of the count de Petigliano, who engaging the French at Gieradadda, was intirely defeated. Lewis, in fifteen days after this victory, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Cremona, Pexhiera, Crema, Bre&s;cia, and Bergama: Vicenza, Verona, Padua, together with Friuli, and all the towns of I&s;tria, &s;ubmitted to the emperor. The pope's general reduced Ravenna, Cervia, Faenza, and Rimini; while the duke of Ferrara recovered Rovigo: &s;o that in the cour&s;e of one &s;hort campaign, the Venetians &s;aw all their exten&s;ive territories reduced to the &s;ingle city of Venice; and the five places in the kingdom of Naples, which had been mortgaged to them by Ferdinand. Their di&s;after was fatal to the Pi&s;ans, who being no longer &s;upported by that republic, were obliged to &s;urrender to the Florentines, after a tedious &s;iege, during which they were reduced to the utmo&s;t extremity. Lewis, having ac|compli&s;hed his aim, returned to France, after he had detached a body of troops to join the emperor, who&s;e army was far from being in a flouri&s;hing condition. The French king's departure afforded &s;ome re&s;pite to the Venetians: they &s;um|moned up all their fortitude, to repair the damages they had &s;u&s;tained: they brought a new army into the field, which kept Maximilian at bay, and took Padua by &s;urprize: they appea&s;ed the pope by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and detached Fer|dinand from the league, by promi&s;ing to re&s;tore his five towns which they po&s;|$e&s;&s;ed. By this time, pope Julius began to be terribly diq$ieted by the union that &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the king of France and the emperor; he con|cluded, that they had engaged in a &s;ecret treaty to &s;ubdue and divide between them the whole country of Italy. In order to prevent the execution of this de&s;ign, he made peace with the Venetians, on condition, that they &s;hould re|nounce all preten&s;ions to the towns of Romagna, which the holy &s;ee had re|covered.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Then the parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act of attainder, condemning Dudley and Emp&s;on, without &s;pecifying the particular crimes of which they were convicted; tho' Henry did not grant a warrant for their exe|cution until the month of Augu&s;t, when the clamour of the people was &s;o loud again&s;t them, that he thought proper to &s;acrifice them to the public re&s;entment, without further delay.

<P>While his time pa&s;&s;ed &s;o agreeably in the&s;e amu&s;ements, he left the care of the admini&s;tration to his mini&s;ters, among whom Wol&s;ey began al|ready to enjoy a great &s;hare of his favour; for he was promoted to the deanery of Lincoln, and pre&s;ented by the king with a fine country-hou&s;e in the neigh|bourhood of London, which had belonged to Sir Thomas Emp&s;on, lately be|headed. The pope, having privately engaged in a league with Ferdinand and the Venetians, indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought an occa&s;ion of quarrelling with the king of France, by giving away a bi&s;hopric in Provence, contrary to his engagement with Lewis. When this monarch complained of the infraction, the pope denied that he had ever entered into any &s;uch engagement; and they gave one another the lie without ceremony. Julius, being thus furni&s;hed with a pretext for a rupture, found means, by the bi&s;hop of Sion, to create a di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the crown of France and the Swi&s;s, who, in a die$ at Lucerne, declared for the pope, and re&s;olved to &s;end an army into the Milane&s;e. His holine&s;s was &s;o &s;ecret in his negotiations, that Lewis, far from &s;u&s;pecting his intention was to form a &s;trong league which &s;hould drive the French out of Italy, believed he had no other de&s;ign but that of &s;eizing Ferrara$ and ordered Chaumont go|vernor of Milan to &s;uccour the duke of Ferrara, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be attacked. The fleet of Venice and the pope's army, however, having attempted to &s;ur|prize Genoa, the king of France con&s;idered the affair in a more &s;erious light, and directed Chaumont to keep a watchful eye over the conduct of Julius, whom that general accordingly had well nigh &s;urprized at Bologna. The pope complained loudly of this in&s;ult at all the courts in Europe, and in particular at London. He excommunicated the French generals; made another un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempt upon Genoa, in conjunction with the Venetian gallies; &s;ent for twelve thou&s;and Swi&s;s, who began their march for the Milane&s;e, under the conduct of the bi&s;hop of Sion: but finding the pa&s;&s;es &s;trongly guarded, they returned to their own country. Lewis formed two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive treaties with Maximilian, by the la&s;t of which, they agreed to a&s;&s;emble a general council at Pi&s;a, in order to depo&s;e Julius; and they actually gained over nine cardinals to their intere&s;t. Mean while, the pope and Venetians being joined by the Spa|ni&s;h army from Naples, his holine&s;s inve&s;ted Mirandols in per&s;on; and the place being reduced, entered by the breach as a conqueror.

Ferdinand, with a view to engage his &s;on-in-law in&s;en&s;ibly in their alliance again&s;t France, di&s;&s;embled his real de&s;ign; and, on pretence of equipping an armament again&s;t the Moors of Africa, &s;ollicited a reinforcement of a thou&s;and Engli&s;h archers.

He appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to mu&s;ter and arm the militia of the kingdom, on pretence of putting the nation in a po&s;ture of de|fence, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be invaded; and that he might avoid a rupture with the king of Scotland, who he knew was attached to Lewis, he appointed en|voys to regulate all differences, which had happened &s;ince the la&s;t treaty. James, however, found a pretext, in &s;pite of all his precautions. Andrew Breton, a Scotti&s;h merchant, having obtained from his &s;overeign a com|mi&s;&s;ion to make repri&s;als on the Portugue&s;e who had plundered and murdered his father on the high &s;eas, equipped two &s;hips of war, with which he made prize of all the Portugue&s;e ve&s;&s;els that traded through the Engli&s;h channel. The amba&s;&s;ador of Portugal repre&s;enting this conduct to Henry as an in&s;ult upon the Engli&s;h flag, he ordered two large &s;hips to be fitted out, and be&s;towed the command of them upon the two &s;ons of the earl of Surry, who attacked the Scotti&s;h cor&s;air, and took his ve&s;&s;el, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, in which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buc$anan.

The king of Scotland demanded re&s;titution of the prizes, as well as reparation for an outrage committed again&s;t the articles of peace &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between the two kingdoms: Henry refu&s;ed the &s;atisfaction he demanded, all$dging, that pyrates and cor&s;airs were never comprehended in treaties; and James prote&s;ted again&s;t this refu&s;al, as an affront which he would revenge with the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Lewis made &s;ome advances towards a paci|fication with the pope; but all his propo&s;als being rejected, he ordered Chau|mont to carry on the war with vigour. That general, though inferior in num|ber to the allies, commanded a body of &s;uch veterans, that they were afraid to hazard an engagement: at length he advanced towards Modena, in order to be&s;iege that city; and the pope, rather than it &s;hould fall into the hands of Lewis, ceded it to the emperor, who began about this time to act very coldly
<PB N="531" REF="5410">
for the intere&s;t of his ally. Neverthele&s;s, the army of the confederates being very hard pre&s;&s;ed by Chaumont, Ferdinand, who &s;till profe&s;&s;ed neutrality, pro|po&s;ed a congre&s;s at Mantua, which produced no other effect than a delay, that was very prejudicial to the French intere&s;t. After this ineffectual effort towards an accommodation, Maximilian, who was not yet altogether detached from Lewis, con&s;ented that the council at Pi&s;a &s;hould be &s;ummoned in his name, to meet on the fir&s;t day of September, and deliberate upon mea&s;ures for the reformation of the church, in its head and members. Not that Lewis was altogether free of &s;u&s;picion: he was informed of a conference at Bologna, between the pope and the bi&s;hop of Gurch, the emperor's mini&s;ter; and Ferdi|nand's great preparations filled him with jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t. Thus alarmed, he ordered Trivulci, who had &s;ucceeded to the command of his army on the death of Chaumont, to act again&s;t the enemy with all po&s;&s;ible diligence. He accordingly took Concordia, and approached Bologna, from whence the pope retired to Ravenna, after having endeavoured in vain to per&s;uade his allies to hazard a battle. He had no &s;ooner withdrawn him&s;elf, than an in&s;urrection en&s;ued in Bologna. The cardinal of Pavia whom the pope had left governor of the place, abandoned his charge. The army of the allies, which had advanced to one of the gates, under&s;tanding this commotion, fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation, leaving their artillery, baggage, and ammunition, to the in|habitants; and to complete the mortification of the pope, his favourite cardi|nal of Pavia, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by his nephew the duke d' Urbino, who accu&s;ed him of having lo&s;t Bologna by his cowardice. His holine&s;s, therefore, &s;eeing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> his army di&s;per&s;ed, and all his de&s;igns upon Ferrara defeated, retired from Ravenna to Rome; and on the road had the mortification, at &s;everal places, to &s;ee the placards for the council of Pi&s;a, by which he him&s;elf was &s;ummoned to appear in per&s;on. In this extremity, he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the diffe|rence<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> between him and France accommodated; and Lewis accepted of his propo&s;als, provided they &s;hould be approved by the emperor: but, the Spa|ni&s;h fleet no &s;ooner arrived at Naples for his &s;ervice, than he rai&s;ed his demands in &s;uch a manner, that Lewis plainly perceived his former propo&s;als had been made &s;olely with a view to gain time; and forth with ordered Trivulci to &s;end &s;uccours to Bologna, which, with the princes of Bentivoglio, he took under his protection. Mean while, Julius, with a view to countermine the council at Pi&s;a, i&s;&s;ued a bull, convoking another in the church of the Lateran. When the a&s;&s;embly of Pi&s;a was actually opened, he excommunicated that city, as well as Florence, to which it belonged; and laid both places under an interdict. Maxi|milian &s;till &s;eemed to he&s;itate between his alliance with France and the proffers of the pope and Venetians; or rather he kept aloof at In&s;pruck, that he might take the advantage of the di&s;tre&s;s of either party.</P>

<P>Ferdinand on the other hand pretended, that his armament was de|&s;igned again&s;t the Moors of Afric; but as &s;oon as he had won over his &s;on|in-law Henry of England, he changed his pretext, and declared, his intention was to protect the church again&s;t the violence of Lewis. He and Henry &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to that monarch, requiring him to de&s;i&s;t from his ho&s;tilities again&s;t the pope; otherwi&s;e, as chri&s;tian princes, they could not help defending the church, which was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by his ambition. Lewis perceiving that their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezera$</NOTE> mea&s;ures were already taken, would not deign to ju&s;tify his conduct; but re|turned
<PB N="532" REF="5420">
&s;uch a lofty an&s;wer as they wanted to receive. Immediately after this tran&s;action, the pope, the king of Arragon, and the Venetians, concluded a league at Rome, leaving a place for the king of England, tho' his amba&s;&s;ador cardinal Bambridge did not &s;ign the treaty. Henry hoped to conclude a &s;eparate al$rance, which &s;hould be more advantageous to England, than this league, which only re&s;pected the intere&s;ts of Italy, or rather the convenience of the pope; for, the profe&s;&s;ed aim of it was to retrieve the city of Bologna, and all the other territories which had been wre&s;ted from the holy &s;ee, by any prince or per&s;on what&s;over. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e negotiations, the council of Pi&s;a held two &s;e&s;&s;ions in that city, although Julius had excommunicated all the car|dinals and prelates of which it was compo&s;ed, as well as all the princes by whom it was countenanced; but, an in&s;urrection of the populace di&s;turbing their deliberations, they transferred the council to Milan, where they thought they might take their mea&s;ures with more &s;afety. Among the adherents of Lewis was John d'Albret king of Navarre, who no &s;ooner declared for the coun|cil of Pi&s;a, than Ferdinand formed the de&s;ign of depriving him of his king|dom on this pretence, and re&s;olved to u&s;e Henry of England as the in&s;trument, for putting this de&s;ign in execution. He gave him to under&s;tand, that this was a favourable opportunity for recovering Guienne, which had belonged to his predece&s;&s;ors, as the Italian league would find &s;uch employment for Lewis, that he &s;hould not be in a condition to defend his own country. That as Guienne was &s;o remote from England, he (Ferdinand) from his affection to Henry, would &s;upply him with troops, tran&s;ports, artillery, and ammunition, without de&s;iring any advantage for him&s;elf, but the plea&s;ure of contributing to the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;on-in-law. This was the bait which allured Henry to enterheartily into the league with the pope, the king of Arragon, and the Venetians; as well as to violate the peace which he had &s;o &s;olemnly renewed with France, and which was &s;o much for the intere&s;t of England. Far from interfering in the affairs of Italy, he ought to have encouraged Lewis in his de&s;igns upon that country, the pro&s;ecution of which would have effectually &s;ecured his kingdom from any danger of a French inva&s;ion.</P>

<P>In about &s;ix weeks after the ratification of the league of Rome, Henry and Ferdinand concluded another at London, in the preamble to which they expatiated upon the ambition and impiety of the French king, who had waged war again&s;t his holine&s;s; made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Bologna; endea|voured to &s;urprize the per&s;on of the pope, an old, infirm valetudinary; routed the army of the holy &s;ee; and refu&s;ed to ab&s;tain from &s;uch cruel ho&s;tilities, when advi&s;ed by the king of Arragon, and England, ro reconcile him&s;elf with the &s;piritual father of Chri&s;tendom. In con&s;equence of this ob&s;tinacy, they had for the prai&s;e and glory of God almighty, our lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the whole triumphant ho&s;t of heaven; for the defence, exaltation, and increa&s;e of the catholic faith, the chri&s;tian religion, and the holy Roman church, unju&s;tly op|pre&s;&s;ed; engaged in a &s;olemn league and alliance, importing, That the two kings &s;hould undertake the defence and protection of the holy Roman &s;ee, again&s;t all aggre&s;&s;ors: That Ferdinand &s;hould take arms for that purpo&s;e in Italy: and, That with the &s;ame view of protecting the holy &s;ee, they &s;hould di&s;tre&s;s the king of France, by carrying the war into Guienne, which &s;hould be conquered for the king of England, to whom it of right belonged. For the
<PB N="533" REF="5430">
execution of this article, Henry engaged to &s;end thither a body of &s;ix thou&s;and infantry, which &s;hould not b$ recalled without the con&s;ent of Ferdinand, who $ndertook to furni&s;h five hundred men at arms, fifteen hundred light hor&s;e, and four thou&s;and infantry, on the &s;ame condition. Be&s;ides, he promi&s;ed to furni&s;h the Engli&s;h troops with provi&s;ion, and munitions of war at a moderate price$ and the two kings agreed to equip a con&s;iderable fleet for the purpo&s;es of this expedition. It was &s;tipulated, That Ferdinand &s;hould provide forty ve&s;&s;els, at a rea&s;onable price, for tran&s;porting the Engli&s;h troops to Guien$e: That the places taken in that country, or el&s;ewhere, &s;hould be delivered to him of the two kings who &s;hould appear to have the prior claim to &s;uch acqui&s;itions: That the army belonging to one of the kings, being in Guienne, or el&s;ewhere, they &s;hould both act with all their power for the defence of either's dominions, provided they &s;hould require a&s;&s;i&s;tance: That they &s;hould adhere to the council of the Lateran, and oppo&s;e that of Pi&s;a$ with all its favo$rers and adherents: That neither king &s;hould make peace or truce without the other's con&s;ent: That this treaty &s;hould not cancel tho&s;e which had been formerly concluded: and, That it &s;hould be ratified in four months by the contracting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> parties.</P>

<P>Immediately after the conclu&s;ion of this treaty, which was commu|nicated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1512.</NOTE> to Lewis by the pope's agent at London, whom he had bribed for in|telligence, Henry called a parliament, which meeting on the fourth day of February, he made them acquainted with his de&s;ign again&s;t France, &s;olemnly prote&s;ting, that his &s;ole aim was to defend the pope and aboli&s;h the &s;chi&s;matic council, which had been transferred from Pi&s;a to Milan. A war with France was never unwelcome to the Engli&s;h people. The commons voted a con&s;idera|ble &s;ub&s;idy; and &s;everal laws were enacted, relating to the conduct of the expe|dition. At length the &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up, after having removed the attainder of Sir<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.</NOTE> Edmund Dudley, and re&s;tored his &s;on John to the rank, e&s;tate, and honours of his family. Then Henry &s;ent Silve&s;ter bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, and Sir Robert Wing|field, as his amba&s;&s;adors to the council of the Lateran, with full power to con|&s;ent, in his name, to every decree that &s;hould be made for the reformation of the church, in its head and members. This &s;tep being taken, he conferred the command of his fleet upon Edward Howard, elde&s;t &s;on of the earl of Surry$ and that of the army de&s;tined to act on &s;hore, on Thomas Grey marquis of Dor&s;et. The troops intended for the Guienne expedition, embarking in the month of May, arrived in the province of Guipu&s;coa about the beginning of June, where they landed with the general, and met with a very cordial re|ception from the commi&s;&s;ioners of Ferdinand. Admiral Howard, who had conveyed them thither, in his return made a de&s;cent upon the coa&s;t of Britanny, from whence he carried off a con&s;iderable booty. He afterwards received a rein|forcement, which Henry $ent upon hearing, that the French king had fitted out a powerful navy; and the enemy &s;ailing from Bre&s;t, both $$eets met in the channel, where a de&s;perate engagement en&s;ued. In the cour&s;e of the battle, the Regent, a large &s;hip, commanded by Sir Thomas Knevit, grappled with the Cor|deliere, one of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;hips of France, the captain of which finding him|&s;elf overpowered, &s;et fire to the magazine, and blew up both ve&s;&s;els$ &s;o that every per&s;on on board of them peri&s;hed, to the amount of &s;ixteen hundred cho&s;en men. This dreadful &s;cene interrupted the combat, and affected both &s;ides in &s;uch

<HEAD>&sect; XIII.</HEAD>
<P>Ferdinand, notwith&s;tanding the terms of his league with Henry, had no other intention but that of conquering Navarre; and therefore his general, the duke of Alva, in&s;tead of joining the marquis of Dor&s;et, who had encamped at Fontarabia, with a view to inve&s;t Bayonne, remained at Logrogno with his forces, alledging that it would be dangerous to undertake the &s;iege of Bayonne, while the king of Navarre continued attached to the intere&s;t of Lewis; becau&s;e while they &s;hould be employed at the &s;iege he might introduce the French into his dominions; and, encamping between the mountains and the &s;ea, cut off their convoys, without hazarding a battle. He therefore propo&s;ed that they &s;hould try to bring over that prince to their mea&s;ures, before they &s;hould em|bark in &s;uch an important enterprize. The marquis, per&s;uaded by this remon|&s;trance, di&s;patched an Engli&s;h officer, to de&s;ire the king of Navarre to join the allies; and Ferdinand &s;ent him a me&s;&s;age to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. He declared he would ob&s;erve an exact neutrality; but, they pre&s;&s;ing him either to join them, or deliver four places for their &s;ecurity, he rejected their propo&s;als, without he|&s;itation. Mean while a French army, commanded by the duke of Longue|ville, approaching the frontiers of Bearne, the marquis complained, that the time lo&s;t in the negotiation with the king of Navarre had given the French an opportuity to come and defend their frontiers; and he in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing whether or not Ferdinand would attack Guienne, according to the treaty of London. The king of Arragon replied, that it would be imprudent in him to let his army march to Fontarabia, and be&s;iege Bayonne, while his own domi|nions &s;hould be left expo&s;ed to inva&s;ion from the enemy; that it would be more for their advantage to march through Navarre, and &s;ecure three or four places of that kingdom, by way of prevention. He, for this rea&s;on, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that the Engli&s;h troops would join the duke of Alva for that purpo&s;e; and he did not doubt that the king of Navarre would engage in the league, as &s;oon as he &s;hould find him&s;elf hard pre&s;&s;ed, &s;o as to ju&s;tify his conduct, &s;hould he be que&s;tioned by Lewis; in which ca&s;e the &s;iege of Bayonne would be un|dertaken with a much better pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. The Engli&s;h general gave him to under&s;tand, that he had no in&s;tructions to act again&s;t the king of Na|varre; and that he could not re&s;olve to make &s;uch a long circuit as would be nece&s;&s;ary for joining the duke of Alva. Ferdinand, not &s;atisfied with this an|&s;wer, &s;till pre&s;&s;ed him to join his army; and in the mean time ordered his ge|neral to inve&s;t Pampeluna, the capital of Navarre, which in a little time &s;ur|rendered upon capitulation; while the king of that country retired to France, and entered into a treaty with Lewis for their mutual defence. After the re|duction of Pampeluna, Ferdinand, in&s;tead of joining the Engli&s;h forces, ac|cording to his promi&s;e, ordered the duke of Alva to continue his conque&s;ts; while the troops, under the marquis of Dor&s;et, &s;erved as an army of ob&s;er|vation, and intimidated the French from entering Navarre; &s;o that the Spa|ni&s;h general was enabled to &s;ubdue the greate&s;t part of that kingdom, without interruption. The king of Arragon, in the mean time, di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to England, to cajole Henry with an unfair account of his proceedings; and, as the king of England had received no intelligence, to the contrary, from the marquis of Dor&s;et, he, at the reque&s;t of Ferdinand, ordered that general to
<PB N="535" REF="5450">
co-operate with the Spani&s;h army. Before the marquis received this order, the duke of Alba reduced St. Jean de pied de port; and then the king of Arragon offered, that if the marquis of Dor&s;et would join his forces, they &s;hould march directly into Guienne, and be&s;iege Bayonne; but this propo&s;al was rejected, as an impracticable &s;cheme, by the marquis, who knew that the French army was intrenched between Bayonne and Salvatierra; &s;o that he could not pa&s;s the river Bida&s;&s;oa, without running the ri&s;k of lo&s;ing his forces; and, Bayonne was by this time &s;o well provided, that it could not be be&s;ieged with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>Ferdinand was well acquainted with the&s;e circum&s;tances; and the &s;ole de&s;ign of his propo&s;al was to obtain a pretence for charging upon the mar|quis the whole blame of leaving Guienne uninvaded. That nobleman, incen&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter Martyr.</NOTE> at his di&s;ingenuous conduct, and &s;eeing his army daily dimini&s;h by &s;ickne&s;s and<NOTE PLACE="marg">R.

The&s;e were granted, with a &s;eeming reluctance, by Ferdinand, who, though he prote&s;ted again&s;t their departure, was very little concerned at their retreat, becau&s;e he had already made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole king|dom of Navarre. At this period the marquis of Dor&s;et falling$&s;ick, was &s;uc|ceeded in command by lord Thomas Howard; and ju&s;t as the troops were ready to embark, the herald arrived with an order to the general to obey king Ferdinand in all his directions. The&s;e news produced a mutiny in the army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> which could not be re&s;trained from embarking; and, when they were returned to their own country, the king was at fir&s;t incen&s;ed again&s;t the general: but his indignation &s;ub&s;ided when he was informed of all the tran&s;actions of the cam|paign, by which he plainly perceived that he had been egregiou&s;ly duped by his father-in-law. He found it convenient, however, to di&s;&s;emble and tem|pori&s;e, le&s;t Ferdinand &s;hould leave him in the lurch, by making a &s;eparate ac|commodation with Lewis. Before the end of the year, the king of Arragon was in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Navarre, which he had no other pretext for retaining but the pope's bull, denouncing excommunication again&s;t John d'Albret, king of Navarre; and be&s;towing his dominions upon the prince by whom they &s;hould be fir&s;t conquered. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. $word$</NOTE></P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Navarre, the army of the allies in Italy, commanded by the viceroy of Naples, undertook the &s;iege of Bologna; but they were obliged to lay a&s;ide that enterprize at the approach of Ga&s;ton de Foix, duke de Nemours, who afterwards routed them near Ravenna, but was him&s;elf killed in the pur&s;uit: then all the towns of Romagna &s;urrendered voluntarily to the cardinal St. Severin, who attended the French army as legate from the council of Pi&s;a, tran&s;lated to Milan. The cardinals at Rome were &s;o terrified at the&s;e events, that they went in a body, and &s;upplicated Julius to make peace with France; but he had re&s;ources of which they were ignorant. The Swi&s;s, at the in&s;tigation of the cardinal of Sion, re&s;olved to invade the dutchy of Mi|lan; and la Pali&s;&s;e, the French general, being apprized of their preparations, ha&s;tened to the defence of that country, leaving St. Severin with a &s;mall body of troops in the Romagna; &s;o that Rome was freed of its apprehen&s;ions, and Julius opened the council of the Lateran. Immediately after the retreat of la Pali&s;&s;e, the towns of Romagna &s;ubmitted to the pope; Lewis was fain to &s;end an army into Bearn, to hinder the Engli&s;h and Spaniards from invading Gui|enne;
<PB N="5$6" REF="5460">
the emperor concluded a truce with the Venetians, and withdrew his troops from the army of France left to defend the Milane&s;e; &s;o that cardinal St. Severin was recalled for the &s;uccour of that dutchy. Sixteen thou&s;and Swi&s;s began their march for Italy by the way of Trent, through which they were al|lowed free pa&s;&s;age by Maximilian, who excu&s;ed him&s;elf to Lewis, by &s;aying, that his alliance with the cantons would not allow him to refu&s;e them a pa&s;&s;age through his dominions. Being joined by the Venetians at Verona, they ap|proached Milan: Pali&s;&s;e, being &s;o weakened that he could not pretend to op|po&s;e their progre&s;s, re&s;olved to repa&s;s the mountains, and retire to France; and he was immediately followed by the fathers of the council, which, by a ha&s;ty decree, was transferred from Milan to Lyon. All the places of the Milane&s;e immediately &s;urrendered to the Swi&s;s and Venetians, except Parma, Placentia, and Reggio. Alexander Bentivoglio quitted Bologna, which was abandoned to the pope's di&s;cretion; &s;o that, by a very &s;urprizing revolution, that pontiff recovered Ravenna, Bologna, the whole country of Romagna; and the French were driven from Italy. On this occa&s;ion the allies held a congre&s;s at Mantua, where they agreed that Maximilian S$orza &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in Milan, and the hou&s;e of Medicis at Florence. The inhabitants of this la&s;t city received the individuals of that family as private citizens; but, the cardinal of Medicis, entering the place while the army of the confederates was at the gates, introduced a good number of officers and &s;oldiers, by which means he excited an in&s;ur|rection, that rendered him ma&s;ter of the place; and the &s;overeignty of his<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> hou&s;e was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<P>A &s;econd a&s;&s;embly was held at Rome, at the de&s;ire of the pope, who wanted to per&s;uade his allies to act again&s;t the duke of Ferrara, and to effect a peace between the emperor and the Venetians, &s;o as that Maximilian &s;hould abandon the council at Lyon. The duke of Ferrara was protected by the king of Arragon, and the Venetians refu&s;ed to &s;upply the pope with troops and mo|ney to &s;ubdue that dutchy: as to the peace between the emperor and the repub|lic, it was re$dered impracticable by the intolerable terms which Maximilian pretended to impo&s;e. At length, Julius, re&s;olving at all hazards to di&s;&s;o$ve the council of Pi&s;a, and hinder Lewis from re-entering Italy, engaged with the em|peror in a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, again&s;t Venice. Maximilian con|&s;ented to the pope's keeping Parma, Placentia, and Reggio, &s;aving &s;till the r$ghts of the empire; to renounce the council of Pi&s;a, and abandon the duke of Ferrara, and the Bentivoglios. Julius engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the emperor with all his power, to launch his thunder again&s;t the Venetians, and declare them ex|cluded from the league of Rome. This treaty being ratified, Maximilian re|nounced the a&s;&s;embly of Pi&s;a, and Sforza was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dutchy of Milan, according to the re&s;olution taken by the allies at Mantua.</P>

He forthwith &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;adors to Bru&s;&s;els, to conclude a league again&s;t Lewis, with the pope, the emperor, the king of Arragon, and Charles of Au&s;tria, &s;overeign of the Low<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$t. $$b.</NOTE> Countries. Then he a&s;&s;embled a parliament, to demand a &s;ub&s;idy, which was

chearfully granted; and, during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, he received a bull from the pope, granting a plenary indulgence to all his &s;ubjects who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this war, with their per&s;ons or money. Henry would willingly have lived in peace with his brother-in-law, James king of Scotland; but that prince, partly from the maxims of policy, and partly from his re&s;entment of Henry's refu|&s;ing to give him &s;atisfaction in the affair of Barton, was altogether bya&s;&s;ed in favour of Lewis. He fitted out a fleet of &s;hips, under the command of Andrew Barton, brother to the cor&s;air of that name; and this officer took a great number of Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els. As &s;oon as Henry declared war again&s;t France, James engaged in a league with Lewis, and began to a&s;&s;emble an army for making an irruption into England, after the forces of that kingdom &s;hould have embarked in the expedition to the continent. Henry, alarmed at the Scotti&s;h armament, &s;ent two amba&s;&s;adors to expo&s;tulate with James; who &s;aid, That being allied to both crowns, his intention was to ob&s;erve an exact neutra|lity: but the king of England, being afterwards informed of his league with Lewis, appointed the earl of Surry warden of the northern provinces, with power to rai&s;e an army, and act again&s;t Scotland, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>While affairs remained in this &s;ituation, pope Julius II. died, and was &s;ucceeded in the papacy by cardinal John de Medicis, who a&s;&s;umed the name of Leo X. and began his pontificate in the thirty-&s;eventh year of his age. He was not &s;o fiery and in&s;olent as his predece&s;&s;or, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great fund of art and addre&s;s; and was already well experienced in the political tran|&s;actions of Europe, as he had been employed by Julius in the mo&s;t important negotiations. He accordingly pro&s;ecuted the plan which that pontiff had pro|jected. He was doubly intere&s;ted to keep the French out of Italy, as pope and a prince of the hou&s;e of Medicis; and he was bent upon the ruin of the council of Pi&s;a, which he could not effect, without exciting wars again&s;t Lewis, which &s;hould compel him to make peace with the church. Ferdinand's aim was to employ the French king, at a di&s;tance from Navarre, Rou&s;&s;illon, and Naples$ and the emperor wi&s;hed that France might be di&s;abled from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Ve|netians: but, as none of the&s;e powers were inclined to carry the war into the dominions of Lewis, their bu&s;ine&s;s was to find &s;ome other power, who &s;hould make this diver&s;ion: and, for that purpo&s;e, they ca&s;t their eyes upon Henry king of England, who had plenty of money and warlike &s;ubjects; and was fired with the ambition o$ di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by &s;ome atchievement of impor|tance. All the allies, therefore, &s;eparately encouraged him to undertake the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Never was le&s;s &s;incerity mani$e&s;ted in any negotiation. Of all the confederates Henry alone intended to fulfil his en|gagements. The pope never ratified the treaty; Ferdinand di&s;avowed his amba&s;&s;ador, by whom it had been confirmed; and the emperor received Henry's money, without any de&s;ign of ob&s;erving the other articles.</P>

<P>While the French and Venetians experienced the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune in Italy, the king of England employed all his attention in preparing a $$eet and army for his expedition into France. By this time, Thomas Wol&s;ey had been created a privy coun&s;ellor; and, by his in&s;inuating addre&s;s, become a favourite with Henry, as well as the companion of all his plea&s;ures. Not that his talents were limited to the arts of a courtier; he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to acquire a perfect in$ight into &s;tate-affairs. He pointed out the impolitic &s;teps which the king had taken &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. He di&s;covered and demo$&s;trated the craft and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of his allies, who had taken &s;uch advan|tage of the king's youth and inexperience, and convinced him of the nece&s;&s;ity o$ choo$ing an able mini&s;ter, for the management of his mo&s;t difficult affairs $word$ home and abroad. He him&s;elf became that very mini&s;ter, and the king re|po$ed the utmo&s;t confidence in his attachment and abilities. The favour of his &s;overeign rendered him proud, in&s;olent, and ungrateful; and he &s;oon incurred the h$tred of the whole nation; tho', as this extended, his cr$dit and influence w$$h Henry &s;eemed to increa&s;e, until all the mo&s;t powerful princes of Europe cour$$d his friend&s;hip and good offices.

<P>Henry, having fini&s;hed his preparations, &s;ummoned his allies to ful$il their &s;everal engagements according to the treaty of Mechlin. The pope had no intention to &s;end an army into Provence; the emperor was in no con|dition to enter Burgundy. The king of Arragon had privately concluded a truce for one year with Lewis, and even comprehended the king of England, without his knowledge. Henry, being informed of this tran$$ction, was &s;o incen&s;ed, that he &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to reproach his father-in-law for $$ch $$|ceitful conduct, and &s;ummon him to execute the treaty of Mechlin, which his envoy had &s;olemnly ratified in his name at London. Ferdinand now alledged that this envoy had exceeded his in&s;tructions; that he had been $word$ by the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs to conclude the truce with Lewis; but he promi$ed to exert him&s;elf vigorou&s;ly after it &s;hould be expired, and advi&s;ed hi$ &s;on-in-law to accede to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion: in which ca&s;e they would afterwards $$ite their forces, and act together again&s;t the common enemy. Henry would no longer depend upon his promi&s;e$; and now, for the fir&s;t time, di&s;covered the $n$$nce|rity of his allies, and found him&s;elf &s;ubjected to the expence of a war again&s;t France, which he expected would have been attacked at the &s;ame time from four different quarters. About this time, he received a letter of ex$$$e from the emperor, giving him to under&s;tand, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly invade Burgundy till next year; but, in the mean time, he would &s;erve in per&s;on as a volunteer in the army of England. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;appointments, the king was &s;o animated with ambition, and the thir&s;t of glory, that he re|&s;olved to maintain the war at his own hazard: tho' he was, at this juncture, in|flamed with a pa&s;&s;ion of a much more $ordid nature.</P>

<P>One would imagine Henry had been born to be the dupe of his $word$ M$$imilian, who had &s;erved as a volunteer only at this &s;iege, per&s;uaded the king to deliver the town into his hands; and he ordered the walls to be r$$$d to the fo$$dation, that the dominions of his grand&s;on Charles of Au&s;tria, might no longer be expo&s;ed to in&s;ults from the garri&s;on of this fortre&s;s.

In&s;tead of razing the fortifications, he &s;ecured the place with a good garri&s;on, commanded by Sir Edward Poynings, tho' it la$ at a greater di&s;tance from Calais than Terouenne, which he had de|moli&s;hed: but, he was on this occa&s;ion influenced by the coun&s;el of Wol&s;ey$ who h$d ca&s;t hi$ eyes on the bi&s;hopric of Tournay, of which he was afterward$ cre$$ed admini&s;trator, on pretence, that the bi&s;hop had refu&s;ed to take the oath of a$$egi$nce to the king of England.

<P>James, without waiting for this an&s;wer, entered Northumberland in the month of Augu&s;t, at the head of a numerous army, and reduced No$|ham, with &s;everal other places. This expedition was ha&s;tened by the defeat of the earl of Hume, who had been &s;ent with &s;ix thou&s;and men, to make an in$$r|&s;ion into England; and in his return $ell into an ambu&s;h laid by Sir William Bulmer, who routed him at the pa&s;s of Broomhou&s;e. This di&s;grace exa&s;perated James, and induced him to pr$cipita$e his inva&s;ion, contrary to the advice of his nobles, and the inclination of his queen, who exerted all her influence in di&s;&s;uading him from the enterprize. He remained, however, dea$ to all tho&s;e rem$n&s;trances; and &s;uffered him$elf to be hurried to his own ruin by a fal&s;e punctilio, aided by the in&s;inuation of De la Mothe the French amba&s;&s;ador. The earl of Surry was no &s;ooner informed of his motions, than he appointed Newca&s;tle as the place of r$nde$vous for the forces of the northern counties$ and on the thirtieth day of Augu&s;t, he was there joined by the lord Dacres, Sir Wil|liam Bulmer, Sir Marmaduke Con$table, and many other per&s;ons of di$tin$|tion. James, &s;ince the reduction of Norham, had lo&s;t &s;ome precious time in i$le d$lli$$ce with the daughter of a northern baron, owner of the ca$$le of Ford; and the Engli&s;h general re&s;olved to go in que&s;t of him without delay. On the third day of September he marched to Alnwic, where he was rein$$$ced by his own &s;on the lord admiral, at the he$d of five thou&s;and cho&s;en men$ &s;o that the army now amounted to &s;ix and twenty thou&s;and men eage$ for battle. James had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong ca$p on a mountain called F$$dden-hill, in the neighbourhood of Ford, where he indulged him&s;elf in his $morous commerce, &s;o as to give umbrage to the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of his &s;ubjects. G$eat pa$t of his army de&s;erted to their own country, with the plunder they

had gained. The earl of Angus returned to Scotland in di&s;gu&s;t; and the earl of Hume, with many others, expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch indifference, at $uch a juncture, as even amounted to treachery. In a word, the king of Scotland &s;aw his troops dimini&s;hed one half; but, he was &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, that the Engli&s;h could not attack him with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. The earl of Surry, knowing his di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ent an herald with a defiance, couched in the mo&s;t provoking terms; and James declared he would give him battle on the Friday following. Surry forthwith drew up his army in order of battle, and march|ing to Wo$$er-ha$gh, within three miles of the Scotti&s;h camp, made a motion towards the left, along the river Till, which he pa&s;&s;ed, and then directed his march towards the Tw$ed, as if he intended to cut off the communication be|tween the enemy and Scotland.</P>

<P>The country was by this time &s;o wa&s;ted by the Scots, the roads &s;o broken, and the rivers &s;o &s;welled by the rains, that he would have found it im|po&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h magazines, or &s;ub&s;i&s;t for any length of time, while the enemy enjoyed abundance. The Scots were not ignorant of the advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and the earl of Huntley, in a council of war, expatiated upon them with great &s;trength of argument; ob&s;erving, that it would be madne&s;s to $ight the Engli&s;h on their own terms, e&s;pecially as they were &s;uperior in num|ber of men; and that in a few days they would be obliged to retire for want of provi&s;ion. James rejected this advice, as a propo&s;al that derogated from his ho|nour, and determined to fight them according to his promi&s;e. He forthwith ordered his hutts to be &s;et on fire; and, under favour of the &s;moke, quitted his advantageous &s;ituation, that he might draw up his army in the plain, where he already found the Engli&s;h in order of battle, &s;o near, that his artillery planted on the d$clivity of a hill, could do no execution. They were formed into three lines; the fir&s;t commanded by the lord admiral; the &s;econd by Sir Edwa$d Howard; and Sir Mar$aduke Con&s;table; and the third by the earl of Surry, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the lord D$cres, and Sir Edward Stanley. The king of Scotland drew up his ar|my on the ri$ing-ground, not without great damage from the Engli&s;h artillery, planted at the pa&s;s of Mill$ield. The command of the van was given to the earl of Huntley; the &s;econd line was commanded by the earls of Le$nox and Argyle; while the earls of Crawford and Montro&s;e conducted the body of re|&s;erve; and James him&s;elf acted as a volunteer in his own army. Huntley charged the divi&s;ion of Howard with &s;uch $ury, that it was immediately put in confu&s;ion and routed: but, it was &s;o &s;ea&s;onably &s;upported by the lord Dacres, that the men rallied, and the battle became general. Both &s;ides fought for a long time with incredible impetuo&s;ity, until the Highlanders being galled by the Engli&s;h artillery, broke in &s;word in hand upon the main body commanded by the earl of Surry; and at the head of the&s;e, James $ought in per&s;on with the mo&s;t forward of his nobility. They attacked with &s;uch velocity, that the o$her line could not advance in time to &s;u&s;tain them$ &s;o that a body of the Engli&s;h intercepted their ret$eat: the earls of Craw$ord and Montro&s;e were $outed by the lord admiral, and his rallied forces, while the earl of Hume and his followers &s;tood inactive, without making the lea&s;t motion to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. In the mean time, James being almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the enemy, refu&s;ed $o quit the field, while it was yet in his power. He &s;corned to &s;urvive the di&s;grace of a d$$eat: but, alighting from his hor&s;e, formed his little body into an orb, re$olving that the Engli&s;h &s;hould pay dear for the victor$. In this po&s;ture $e

<P>Henry, notwith&s;tanding the laurels he had gathered in the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer, began to be tired of the war with France, in proportion as $e became more and more convinced of the treachery of his allies. After the battle of Guinega&s;te, the Swi&s;s, in&s;tigated by the pope and the emperor, made an irruption into Burgundy, and inve&s;ted Dijon, which was defended by L$ Tremouille lately returned from Italy. This officer, finding him&s;elf reduced to ex|tremity, concluded a capitulation with the be&s;iegers, by which he bound him|&s;elf to pay four hundred thou&s;and crowns; and promi&s;ed, in his ma&s;ter's name, that the king &s;hould renounce all his preten&s;ions to the dutchy of Milan. The Swi&s;s received twenty thou&s;and crowns of the money from La Tremouille, and four ho&s;tages, with which they returned very well &s;atisfied to their own country: but, the&s;e found means to e&s;cape, when Lewis refu&s;ed to ratify the capitulation. That monarch finding him&s;elf unable to cope with &s;o many adver&s;aries, re&s;olved to reconcile him&s;elf to the pope, who having no per&s;onal enmity again&s;t him, and being now rid of his fears for Italy, exacted no other condition, but that of his renouncing the co$ncil of Pi&s;a, which he immediately abandoned. The accommodation was no &s;ooner effected, than Leo &s;e$t a brief to $ing Henry, exhorting him earne&s;tly to a peace, as he had taken up arms for the defence of the holy &s;ee, and already accompli&s;hed that purpo&s;e, by his victories over her enemy, in con&s;equence of which he had returned to his ob$dience. Henry's eyes were now fully opened. He and his allies had u&s;ed the pret$nce of defend|ing the church, as a pretence only, to cover their own &s;eparate intere$ts: and now the pope had accompli&s;hed his own aim, he pretended to interp$et the p$e|amble of their league in the literal acceptation. He had been more than once duped by his father-in-law the king of Arragon, he had nothing to expect either from the power or &s;incerity of the emperor, and he $ore$aw that he &s;hould not $e able of him&s;elf to main$ain a war again$$ the whole &s;trongth of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Lewis, fir$d with the ambition of recovering Milan and Genoa$ re$$$ved to &s;ow jealou$ies and di$$en$ion amon$ the allies; and with this view renewed a negotiation with the emperor, touching a marriage bet$een his daughter Ren$$, and Charles $rchduke of Au$tri$. Such an alliance would have been very agreeable to Maximilian and Ferdi$and: but, the pope could not behold the pro&s;pect of it without the utmo&s;t di&s;quiet$ for, he was not more afraid of $eeing Milan in the hands of the French, than of its being po$$e$$ed by a grand&s;on of the emperor, and king of Arragon. He and the Swi&s;s pa&s;&s;ionately de$ired to &s;ee the family of the Sforzas in po$$e$&s;ion of that dutchy. The chief $$m of the Venetians was, to procure an equitable peace with th$ emperor, which they could not obtain without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France; and this was not to be acqu$red but by aidi$g Lewis to recover the Milane$e. Maximili$n was the more aver&s;e to peace, as $e fou$d his account in the war, which was carried on at the expence of his allies again&s;t Venice; and it was the intere$t of Ferdi|nand to keep the affairs of Italy embroiled, that Lewis might not have lei&s;ure to convert his attention to Navarre, which the Spaniard had conquered. For this purpo&s;e he acted a great variety of parts; &s;ometimes he a&s;$$&s;ted the empe|ror again$t Venice; &s;ometimes he u&s;ed his good offices with Maximilian, in $avour of the republic; at other times he in&s;tigated the pope and the Swi&s;s again&s;t Lewis; and then he offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that prince, in conquering the dutchy of Milan. His whole conduct was made up of artifice and deceit, prac|ti&s;ed for his own &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es: but, at length his cunning over&s;hot it&s;elf; for, he lo&s;t his reputation to &s;uch a degree, that no prince, would con$ide in his pro$e$$ions. Pope Leo, alarmed at the negotiation which Lewis had renewed with the emperor, endeavoured to reconcile the French king with the Swi&s;s, that he might be the le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to uni$e with Maximilian, and the king of Arragon; but, all his $fforts proved ine$$ectual. Ferdinand, afraid of being l$ft alone in the lurch, prolonged the truce for another year with Lewis; and his holine&s;s en$eavoured to promote an accommodation between the emperor and the Vene|tians, th$$ the French might be di&s;courag$d from revi&s;iting Italy. After &s;ome negotiation, they c$o&s;e him arbiter of their difference$ and he pronounced a provi$ional &s;entence, orda$ning, That both parties &s;hould lay down their arms: That the emperor &s;hould put, by way of depo&s;it, in his hands, the town of Vi|cenza, and all that the Spaniards occupied in the terri$orie$ of Padu$ and T$e|vi&s;o: That the Venetians &s;hould act in the &s;ame manner with re&s;pect to Crema; and pay fifty thou&s;and ducats to the em$eror: but, That this provi&s;ional agr$e|$$nt $$ou$$ be null, if not rati$$ed by both parties$ and in that ca&s;e$ he en|ga$ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> to pronounce a definitive &s;entence within the year. This award was ac|co$dingly rej$cted by the Venetians, who thought a tru$e would be more pre|$udicial to their affairs th$n a continu$tion of the war.</P>

<P>While the pope took the&s;e mea&s;ures to render the mini$ter of Eng|land propitious to his views, Lewis king of France made overtures of peace to Henry, by means of the duke of Longueville, who had been taken in the battle of Guinega&s;te. That nobleman acted as a private amba&s;&s;ador, in open|ing the eyes of the Engli&s;h monarch with regard to the conduct of his allies; and, demanded his &s;i&s;ter Mary in marriage for Lewis, who had left his wife Anne of Britanny in the beginning of the preceding year. No Eng|li&s;hman was privy to this negotiation but the king him&s;elf, and Wol$ey bi&s;hop of Lincoln, until both parties had agreed to almo&s;t all the articles pro|po&s;ed; and then the French king &s;ending over two public amba&s;&s;adors, a ce&s;|&s;ation of arms took place while the affair was on the carpet. After &s;ome debate and difficulty, three different treaties were &s;igned on the &s;eventh day of Augu&s;t. The fir&s;t imported, That peace and friend&s;hip &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t until one of the parties &s;hould die; and that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould within the year give notice to the &s;urvivor, whether or not he would renew the treaty: That all impo&s;itions laid within two and fifty years, by either king, to the prejudice of the other's &s;ubjects, &s;hould be aboli&s;hed: That this peace &s;hould not be deemed broken and annulled on account of whatever violations might be committed on either &s;ide: That one party &s;hould not afford refuge and protection to the other's rebels. Both kings obliged them&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, for the mutual defence of their dominions: for the recovery of territories retained by other princes, and in ca&s;e of either's being attacked on account of this treaty: in which the pope, the Swi&s;s, and the king of Scotland, were comprehended as the allies of Lewis, while Henry nominated as his friends, the pope, Bologna, with all the cities of St. Peter's patrimony, the archduke of Au&s;tria, and the Swi&s;s. The &s;econd treaty &s;tipulated, That the marriage between Lewis and the prin|ce&s;s Mary &s;hould be contracted by proxy, and celebrated in ten days after the date of the treaty: That the king of England &s;hould &s;end the prince&s;s at his own expence to Abbeville: and, That the French king &s;hould con&s;ummate the nuptials in four days after her arrival: That Mary's dower &s;hould amount to four hundred thou&s;and crowns, one half of which &s;hould be expended in jew|els: and, That in ca&s;e of requi&s;ition, Lewis &s;hould not be obliged to re&s;tore above that value: That, with regard to the other half, Henry &s;hould pay it by giving an acquittance to the French king, for &s;o much of one million which Lewis obliged him&s;elf by this treaty to pay to the king of England: That the jointure of Mary &s;hould be as great as that which had been a&s;&s;igned to any queen of France; and, in ca&s;e of her &s;urviving Lewis, $word$ &s;hould have it in her power to live in France or England, according to her own $word$ In the third treaty Lewis acknowledged, That Charles VII. of France had, in the pacification of E&s;taples, engaged to pay to Henry VII. of England and his &s;u$ce$&s;ors, the &s;um of &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and crowns, the arrears of which it was incumbent upon him (Lewis) to di&s;charge: That his father Charles

Before this treaty was $igned, Mary declared, in pre&s;ence of a notary and witne$$es, that &s;he had been $or$$d to plight her $roth to the prince of Ca&s;tile, archduke of Au&s;tria, who had failed in the performance of his promi&s;e to marry her by proxy, as &s;oon as &s;he $hould have attained to the fourteenth year of her age; be&s;ides, &s;he alledged, that the coun|&s;ellors and con&s;ederates of Charles exer$$d all th$ir influence, in attempts to in|&s;pire him with ha$red again&s;t her brother the king of England.

<P>In the mean time cardinal $ambridge dying at Rome, his arch|bi&s;hopric of York was be&s;towed on Wol&s;ey, who directed the helm of government with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority. By this pacification Henry ex$$icated him&s;elf from an expen&s;ive war: and now his kingdom enjoyed pro|found tranquillity; for, James IV. of Scotland, who was killed at $loddon, had le$t two infant &s;ons, under the tuition of his queen, whom he had likewi&s;e in his la$t will appointed regent of the kingdom during her widowhood.

By that time they returned to England the parliament was a$$e$bled; and, among &s;ome other regulations of a do|me&s;tic nature, enacted three remarkable $tatu$es.

all patents lately obtained, which contradicted the purport of anterior patents$ not expre&s;ly mentioned in the latter; and the third ordained, that no member of parliament &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf before the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, without expre&s;s leave, on pain of for$eiting his wages. The&s;e affairs being tran&s;acted, Francis I. being re&s;olved to march into Italy for the recovery of Milan, thought it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the friend&s;hip of England, and &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to London to renew the alliance with Henry, together with the obligation for paying the million which had been &s;tipulated with Lewis. This negotiation met with no difficulty, and a new treaty was immediately concluded. Henry thought proper at the &s;ame time to &s;end amba$&s;adors to Bru&s;&s;els, to excu&s;e his conduct to the archduke, in the affair of his &s;i&s;ter's marriage, and to propo&s;e a new alliance; but they were received with great indifference, and a con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed before they received an an&s;wer.</P>

<P>Mean while Francis began to make great preparations for his Ita|lian expedition; and Ferdinand, being apprehen&s;ive that his real de&s;ign was upon Navarre, engaged in a league with the emperor, the duke of Milan, and the Swi$s, for ob&s;tructing his progre&s;s, whether he &s;hould attack that kingdom, or penetrate into Italy. The pope him&s;elf acceded privately to this treaty$ and &s;ent an army into Lombardy, under the command of Laurence de Medi|cis. The king of Arragon rai&s;ed forces for the defence of Navarre, and the Swi&s;s $ent troops to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;es into Italy: but Ferdinand no &s;ooner under&s;tood the real de&s;ign of France, than he di&s;banded his army which he had rai&s;ed for the protection of Navarre, and forbad the viceroy of Naples, who commanded his forces in Italy, to join the allies. The emperor continued inactive at In&s;p$uck, according to cu&s;tom, and Leo made no motion towards a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Swi&s;s, who were left to bear the whole burthen of the war. Fran|cis, having found means to pa&s;s the mountains by a way which was thought impracticable, the Swi&s;s ret$red to Milan; and he, approaching the &s;ame city, offered them a great &s;um of money if they would return to their own country. The negotiation was already pretty $ar advanced, when they received a rein|forcement of fifteen thou&s;and men, and not only rejected his propo&s;al, but re|&s;olved to give him ba$$le without delay.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the joy with which he received the news of his promotion, he would not forgive the author of his elevation for the injury he &s;u&s;tained at his hands in the affair of Tournay; but re&s;olved to engage Henry in a new league again&s;t France. His three predominant pa&s;&s;ions were pride, in|tere&s;t, and revenge; and the&s;e three he re&s;olved to gratify on this occa&s;ion. He wanted to &s;hew that even &s;overeigns &s;hould not offend him with impunity. He con&s;ulted his revenge in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Francis; and his intere&s;t in pre&s;erving the admini$tration of the bi&s;hopric of Tournay, which he had no pro&s;pect of retain|ing any other way than by a rupture between France and England. The king was wholly guided by his coun&s;els, without perceiving his a&s;cendancy. Ri|chard Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, his benefactor, together with the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, received &s;uch mortifications from this imperious pr$|late, as obliged them to retire from court, that they might be no longer expo&s;ed to his in&s;olence; and the re&s;t of the privy council was chiefly compo&s;ed of his crea|tures. He now fomented the king's pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t Francis, by exaggerating the greatne&s;s and glory of that monarch, and in&s;inuating that it was the intere&s;t of England to humble his prid$, and hinder him from growing more powerful. When he had thus prepared the king's di&s;po&s;ition, he gave the emperor to un|der&s;tand that it would not be impo&s;&s;ible to detach his ma&s;ter from the intere&s;t of Francis; and, in the mean time, he prevailed upon Henry to renew the al|liance between Spain and England, notwith&s;tanding the repeated per$idy of<NOTE PLACE="marg">L$.

Henry, on this occa&s;ion, convoked a general council, to which the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, were parti|cularly &s;ummoned. The cardinal opened the a&s;&s;embly with a &s;tudied &s;peech again&s;t Francis, endeavouring to demon&s;trate that it was the intere&s;t of Eng|land to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of his ambition. His &s;entiments were e&s;pou&s;ed by the bi&s;hop of Durham, and the majority of the members; but the antient coun|&s;ellors di&s;&s;uaded the king from infringing the peace to which he had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn; and advi&s;ed him to turn his arms again&s;t Scotland, where the French

party prevailed over the intere&s;t of his &s;i&s;ter. Henry him&s;elf &s;eemed to follow a middle cour&s;e; which, in all probability, was pre&s;cribed by his mini&s;ter.

Since his being inve&s;ted with the dignity of cardinal, he had become more vain, proud, and imperious than ever. He never appeared in public without the retinue of a &s;overeign prince. His cardinal's hat was carried as a trophy before him; and, when he entered the chapel, placed upon the altar. He was preceded by his &s;erjeant at arms and mace, two gentlemen carrying pillars of &s;ilver, and his cro&s;s-bearer. His habit was of &s;ilk; and the very harne&s;s of his hor&s;es em|broidered with gold. Warham, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was &s;hocked at his o$tentation; and &s;till more chagrined at his pre&s;umption, in ordering the cro&s;s of York to be carried erect in the province of Canterbury. Knowing him&s;elf unable to cope with Wol&s;ey in point of intere&s;t, he begged leave to retire to his own &s;ee, and re&s;ign the office of chancellor, which was immediately con|ferred on the favourite cardinal, whom the king enabled to &s;upport his a&s;&s;u|med dignity with continual benefactions of prebends, ward&s;hips, and other perqui&s;ites. Be&s;ides the income of his archbi&s;hopric and office of chancellor, he farmed at a mean price the &s;ees of Bath, Wells, and Hereford, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Italians re&s;iding at Rome; and his avarice increa&s;ed with his revenue. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

In this treaty a place was left for Henry of England, whom the pope earne&s;tly exhorted, to concur in oppo&s;ing the progre&s;s of the Turks again&s;t the Mamelukes of Aegypt, alledging, that the infidels, after hav|ing &s;ubdued the Aegyptians, would certainly turn their arms again&s;t the Chri|&s;tians: but, it afterwards appeared, that the &s;ole de&s;ign of his holine&s;s was, to enrich him&s;elf and his family with the &s;poils of Chri&s;tendom.

<P>The &s;ame pretext he u&s;ed for &s;elling plenary indulgences at a very moderate price, to all who would purcha&s;e their &s;alvation. Chri&s;tendom was divided into different departments, in which collectors were appointed to re|ceive the money, together with certain prie&s;ts in&s;tructed to preach up the utility of the indulgences. The archbi&s;hop of Mentz, who nominated the preachers in Germany, a&s;&s;igned the province of Saxony to the Jacobins, whereas in the preceding cru&s;ades, that employment had been always be&s;towed upon the Augu|&s;tines.

Martin Luther, an Augu&s;tine monk,

and p$ofe&s;&s;or of theology in the new univer&s;ity of Wirtemberg, wrote again&s;t tho&s;e agents; and in his writings in&s;erted &s;ome &s;evere animadver&s;ions again&s;t the nature of the indulgences. By the&s;e bold attacks he incurred the re|&s;entment of a great number of $ccle&s;ia$$ics, and their oppo&s;ition in&s;en&s;ibly en|gaged him in a careful examination of the authority on which indulgences were<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> founded. He was &s;oon &s;atisfied of their being altogether un&s;upported by &s;crip|ture; and from that day laboured to di&s;abu&s;e the public with re&s;pect to their opinion of the papal power: tho' he is &s;aid to have been animated by the dic|ta$$s of private re&s;entment, in forwarding the reformation, which &s;oon diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over great part of Germany; and afterwards extended into other coun|tries. The pope payed very little regard at fir&s;t to L$ther's efforts, thinking it impo&s;&s;ible, that a &s;imple monk could ever affect the power and authority of the &s;overeign pontiff; he therefore continued to $ell his indulgences, and to exhort all good chri&s;tians to contribute towards the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary war. Among others he applied to the king of England, whom he extolled with the mo$t extravagant encomiums, for his zeal in behalf of holy church; and then demanded a &s;ub&s;idy of two hundred thou&s;and ducats, tho' he did not &s;ucceed in this negotiation.</P>

<P>Henry's imagination was much more engaged by the propo&s;al of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ H$$bert.</NOTE> Maximilian, who had promi&s;ed to re&s;ign the empire in his favour. Though he at fir&s;t &s;eemed to decline this honour, it made an impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind; and now that the emperor was in the Low Countries on a vi&s;it to his grand&s;on, he &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and doctor Cuthbert Ton&s;tal, to treat with him on the &s;ubject, and propo&s;e an interview. Maximilian told them, he would &s;pare their king the trouble of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea, by going in per&s;on to England; but, when they talked to him on the other &s;ubject, he an&s;wered with equivocation, and $ought to evade his promi&s;e, on various pretences; alledging, that he mu&s;t fir&s;t obtain the con&s;ent of the diet, that he him&s;elf might re|tain the title of king of the Romans, and render it hereditary in his family: at other times, he &s;aid his intention was to procure the imperial crown to his grand&s;on Charles, to create Henry king of the Romans, and to erect Au&s;tria into a kingdom for Ferdinand the brother of Charles. From the&s;e vague de|clarations, the amba&s;&s;adors concluded, that he had no intention to part with the imperial crown; and that his original propo&s;al was no more than a &s;cheme of adulation to extort money from the king of England. Henry had very little rea&s;on to be chagrined at his being di&s;appointed in the hope of &s;uch a trouble&s;ome dignity. He ruled over a wealthy nation, which intirely acqui|e&s;ced in his government; and the tranquillity of his people was uninter|rupted, except by petty commotions, which were ea&s;ily quelled. One of the&s;e happened at this juncture, in the city of London, where the apprentices rai&s;ed a riot again&s;t foreigners, &s;ome of whom were robbed and murdered. The earls of Sali&s;bury and Surry a&s;&s;embling the inns of court men, cleared the &s;treets of the populace; and in about three days after the riot, the duke of Norfolk en|$$ring the city at the head of thirteen hundred armed men, joined the mayor, and proceeded legally again&s;t the offenders. John Lincoln, a broker, and three other ringleaders, were hanged, drawn and quartered. Ten were hung on gib|b$ts in the &s;treets; the recorder and aldermen went in mourning to court, and deprecated the wrath of the king, who referred the affair to the cognizance of

the cardinal, who was chancellor of the realm. In con&s;equence of his award, all the pri&s;oners in white &s;hirts, with halters about their necks, appeared before the king at We&s;tmin$ter, and craving mercy, were pardoned. This di&s;turbance was &s;ucceeded by the Sweating &s;ickne&s;s, which rag$d in England with &s;uch ma|lignity, that a great number of people died in three hours after they were &s;eized with the di&s;temper, which in &s;ome towns de&s;troyed one third, and in others, one half of the inhabitants.</P>

<P>Though there was not one prince in Europe that thought the pope was really in earne&s;t in his project for a general league again&s;t the Infidels, or even believed &s;uch a &s;cheme practicable, almo&s;t every individual potentate u&s;ed it as a pretext for covering his own intere&s;ted de$igns. The emperor $e|i$g de&s;irous of &s;eeing one of his grand-children elected king of the Romans, availed him&s;elf of this pretended war again&s;t the Turks, to per&s;uade the Ger|mans, that the imperial dignity ought to be pre&s;erved in the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, as no other family in the empire had power enough to re&s;i&s;t their attempts. Charles king of Spain made u&s;e of the &s;ame pretence for the &s;ame purpo&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1518.</NOTE> and as he had occa&s;ion for &s;ome years of peace, &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon the conclu&s;ion of a general truce, that the chri&s;tian princes might be at liberty to unite their forces again&s;t the Infidels. Such a propo&s;al could not be di&s;agree|able to the French king, alarmed by the defen&s;ive league which had been formed again&s;t him, and eager to recover Tournay, which he could not hope to retrieve in time of peace; and Henry VIII. was glad to engage in the alli$nce formed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> by the pope, the emperor, the kings of France and Spain; becau&s;e his re|fu&s;al might have furni&s;hed them with a pretence for undertaking &s;omething to his prejudice.

<P>The king of France fore&s;eeing that he &s;hould never be able to re|trieve Tournay, without gaining over to his intere&s;t cardinal Wol$ey, who was admini&s;trator of that bi&s;hopric, &s;pared neither flattery, promi&s;es, nor pre|&s;ents, to render that prelate propitious to his views; and at length, he pre|vailed upon him to agree to the re&s;titution, on condition that the car|dinal &s;hould be indemnified for the lo&s;s of the admini&s;tration, by a yearly pen|&s;ion: that the French king &s;hould pay &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns to Henry for the city of Tournay: and, that a match &s;hould be effected between the dau|phin and the prince&s;s Mary, daughter to the king of England. This private convention being &s;ettled, Wol&s;ey all of a &s;udden, changing his u&s;ual &s;train, re|pre&s;ented to the king, that the expence of the garri&s;on of Tournay greatly &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed all the advantages he could derive from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a place which was at &s;uch a di&s;tance from Calais; that it could not be maintained i$ ca&s;e of a rupture between the two crowns. He therefore advi&s;ed him to fill his coffers with the money which was offered by Francis; and embrace the propo&s;al of the match, which would con&s;olidate their friend&s;hip, render them the arbiters of Europe, and $orm a &s;ea&s;onable bulwark again&s;t the growing power of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the empire, Spain, the Low Countries, and the kingdom of Naples and Sicily. Henry plainly perceived Wol&s;ey's motives for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. H$rbert.</NOTE> changing the tenor of his di&s;cour&s;e in this manner; and publicly declared, that $e

&s;aw Wol$ey was re&s;olved to govern both him&s;elf and the king of France. In|deed, the cardinal had made a merit of di&s;clo&s;ing to the king the advances which the French monarch had made to him in private, ob&s;erving, that the prince mu&s;t be very de&s;irous of Henry's friend&s;hip, who would &s;ue &s;o &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ively to his &s;ervants. Wol&s;ey had gained &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over the mind of his &s;overeign, that $e could have per&s;uaded him to follow any mea&s;ure what|&s;oever, even though it had been oppo&s;ite to his own intere&s;t: but, here his favou|rite's inclination, and his own intere&s;t happened to coincide; and he accordingly a$$ented to the propo&s;al. The conditions of the alliance being regulated be|tween the cardinal and M. de Villeroy &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who repaired to Lon|don for that purpo&s;e, the king of France &s;ent over a &s;olemn emba$$y, compo&s;ed of the admiral de Bonnivet, Stephen Po$cher bi&s;hop of Paris, joined to Villeroy, and impowered to renew the treaty of friend&s;hip between the two kings; to treat of a league with the pope, and other princes of Chri&s;tendom, for the de|fence of religion, and the catholic church; of the match between the dauphin and the pri$ce&s;s Mary; of the re&s;titution of Tournay, St. Amand, and Mor|t$gne; and of an interview between the two kings. They brought over letters patent, by which Francis obliged him&s;elf to pay to his Dear Friend the cardin$l of York, a pen&s;ion of ten thou&s;and livres, in return for his giving up the admini&s;tration of the bi&s;hopric of Tournay. All the&s;e articles being duly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, four &s;eparate treaties were &s;igned and ratified in October. In the fir&s;t, the contracting parties agreed, That the marriage &s;hould be celebrated when the dauphin &s;hould have attained the fourteenth year of his age: That Mary's portion &s;hould amount to three hundred and thirty thou&s;a$d crowns of gold: and, That her jointure &s;hould be equal to that of Anne of Bret$gne, and Mary of England, who had been wives to Lewis XII. The &s;econd related to the re&s;titution of Tournay, for which Francis engaged to pay &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns; but from this &s;um he was left at liberty to deduct the portion of the prince&s;s Mary. The third concerned certain precautions taken, to prevent an infraction of the peace, as well as to procure prompt reparation for the damage that might be &s;u&s;tained by the &s;ubjects of either power. And the fourth &s;tipu|lated an interview between the two monarchs, in the village of Sandenfelt, near Ar|dres<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ry$er.</NOTE> in Picardy. The&s;e treaties being ratified, the prince&s;s Mary was betrothed to the dauphin, in St. Paul's church at London; and the earl of Worce$te$, with We&s;t bi&s;hop of Ely, and a magnificent train &s;ent over to demand the per|formance of Francis, who &s;wore to the ob&s;ervance of the treaties, delivered $o$tages for the payment of the money, and in the name of his &s;on, fulfilled the contract of marriage.</P>

The king of England had &s;till a ha$|kering after the imperial dignity, and &s;ent Richard Pace, as his am$a&s;&s;$d$r, to &s;ound the electors; but, he was too late in his application: and at length, the intere&s;t of Charles prevailing, he was elected emperor at the diet of Frankfort. Leo finding all oppo&s;ition would be in vain, a&s;&s;ented to the election with $ good grace; but Francis was extremely mortified at his di&s;appointment, which inflamed the jealou&s;y that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and Charles$ and ha&s;t$n$d the rupture that en&s;ued. Indeed, their differences were &s;uch as could not be ea&s;ily terminated in an amicable manner. Francis had preten&s;ions to the king|dom of Naples, and rea&s;on to complain, that his rival had not re&s;tored the kingdom of Navarre to John D'Albret, according to the &s;tipulations of the treaty of Noyons. On the other hand, Charles laid claim to the dutchy of Burgundy, as heir to the antient dukes, as well as to the dutchy of Mil$n, which, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Francis, was a $ie$ of the empire. Another &s;ource of contention was the duke of Guelderl$$d, who, tho' a profe&s;&s;ed enemy of the emperor, was publicly protected by Francis. The pope was obliged to tem|porize with both, though of the two he was inclined to favour Charles; and Hen|ry of England, by a &s;teady and di&s;creet conduct, might have held the ballance of power b$twixt tho&s;e two rivals, as to cau&s;e either &s;cale to preponderate$ ac|cording to the nece&s;&s;ity of the times, or the dictates of his own intere&s;t.

however, he did not always regard, bec$u&s;e he was ab&s;olutely ruled $y the pa&s;&s;ions and cap$ice of his favouri$e Wol$ey, whom Charles and Francis cul|tivated with the $tmo&s;t a$$iduity, well knowing, there was no other way to pro|cure the friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England, which was deemed &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce$s of their different de&s;igns. Be&s;ides pre&s;ents and pen&s;ions offered to this idol, they vied with $ach other in care$$ing him with the gro$$e$t adula|tion, calling him in their letters, their friend, their patron, and their father; and ex$olling his virtue, prudence, and cap$city, in the mo&s;t hyperbolical ex|pre&s;&s;ions. He cunningly made u&s;e of the&s;e te&s;timonies, not only to flatter his ma&s;ter's vanity, by repre&s;enting how formidable he mu&s;t be to tho&s;e two poten|$a$es, who &s;tooped &s;o low as to court the good graces of his mini&s;ter; but, like|wi$e to enhance his own merit in the opinion of Henry, who could not help ob&s;erving, that Wol$ey's parts mu$t have been greatly &s;uperior to tho&s;e of all other favourites, when they were thus acknowledged by the greate&s;t princes of Chri$tendo$$. He actually looked upon him&s;elf as the arbiter of Europe, and rem$ined &s;o f$lly convinced of his cardinal's capacity, that he $aw nothing but with his eyes, and was in every thing directed &s;olely by his advice. Wol$ey had now attained the very highe&s;t pinnacle of $$rtune; he was favourite, prime mini&s;ter, lord high chancellor, admini&s;trator of the &s;ee of Bath and Wells, archbi|&s;hop of York, cardinal, and legate a latere. He received annual pen&s;ions from the emperor, and the king of France, drew immen&s;e profits from the office of chancellor, by means of the privileges annexed to it by his maje&s;ty; and the king not only loaded him with rich pre&s;ents, but al&s;o furni&s;hed him with a great number of opportunities to increa&s;e his revenues. The pope, the emperor, the king of France, and the republic of Venice, courted his favour with the utmo&s;t emulation; and Francis in particular &s;ent him letters patent, con$en$|ing, that $e &s;hould regulate the ceremonial of his interview with Henry.</P>

<P>Wol$ey was &s;o intoxicated by this flow of pro&s;perity, that his pride and arrogance &s;urmounted all bounds. He could no longer bear equality in his l$gation, and therefore prevailed upon the pope to recal Campejus; and leave him inve&s;ted with the &s;ole leg$$ine power. He now celebrated ma&s;s as if he had been pope in reality, attended by bi&s;hops and dukes; and earls pre&s;ented him with the water and towel. He ordered the cro&s;s of York, and another for his legatine function, to be carried before him by two of the talle$t prie&s;ts that could be found. He erected a new court of judicature, called, the Legate's court, in effect a court of con&s;cience, that took cognizance of almo&s;t all the actions of life; and one John Allen being appointed judge of this bench, acted with incredible rapaciou&s;ne&s;s and extortion, on pretence of reforming the morals of the people. He pretended that his juri&s;diction extended to all &s;uits ari&s;ing from wills, and contracts of marriage; and tried an infinite number of cau&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.</NOTE> while the king's judges dur$t not oppo&s;e this innovation. At the &s;ame time, the cardinal legate di&s;po&s;ed of all the benefices of the kingdom in favour of his own creatures, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the rights of churches, mona$teries, or patrons. At length, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, from a mo|tive of co$&s;cience, informed the king of this oppre&s;&s;ion; and Henry not only $eemed &s;urprized at the cardinal's in&s;olence, but, de&s;ired $he old bi&s;hop to tell him, that he expected he would re$orm a$l $ho&s;e abu&s;es. This remon&s;trance pro|duced $o other effect, than that of augmenting Wolfey's hatred to the archbi|&s;hop.
<PB N="557" REF="5670">
But his agent, Allen, being afterwards accu&s;ed by one John London, a &s;imple prie&s;t, the complaint reached the ears of the king, who $ep$imanded the cardinal with &s;uch &s;everity, that he was more circum&s;pect in the &s;equel. The great wealth, power, and authority, which he enjoyed in England, could not &s;atisfy his ambition, while there was one degree of eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity which he had not yet attained. He had already begun to take mea&s;ures for obtain|ing the papacy, whenever the holy &s;ee &s;hould become vacant; and the king of France had a&s;&s;ured him of the votes of fourteen cardinals: but, &s;ince Charles was elected emperor, he &s;eemed to think that prince more capable of rai&s;ing him to St. Peter's chair, and began gradually to wean his ma&s;ter from the in|tere&s;t of France, and engage him in behalf of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Never|thele&s;s he would not declare him&s;elf &s;o far as to prevent the interview between Henry and Francis, becau&s;e he could not prevail upon him&s;elf to re&s;ign the plea&s;ure of appearing at the court of France, with all the pomp of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical magnificence; and of &s;hewing him&s;elf to his countrymen, honoured and care&s;&s;ed by &s;uch a powerful monarch. But he was re&s;olved to take &s;uch mea|&s;ures as would hinder Francis from turning this interview to the prejudice of the emperor, who at this period gained an incredible acce&s;&s;ion of wealth by the prowe&s;s of Fernando Cortez, in his conque&s;t of the Mexican empire. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>Wol&s;ey having regolated the ceremonial of the interview, the king repaired to Canterbury in the latter end of May, in order to pa&s;s his Whit&s;un|tide<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1520.</NOTE> in that city, and from thence proceed to Calais; but next day he was given to under&s;tand that the emperor had landed at Dover. The whole court, and even the king him&s;elf, was &s;urprized at the arrival of Charles, which had been preconcerted between that prince and the cardinal, to whom he had promi&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> his influence with the pope, towards procuring for him the bi&s;hopric of Baja|dox. Wol&s;ey was &s;ent to compliment the emperor at Dover, where the king met him next day, and conducted him to Canterbury; whither al&s;o the queen came to vi&s;it her nephew, whom &s;he had never &s;een before. The emperor's de|&s;ign in this voyage was to divert Henry from his purpo&s;ed interview with Francis, from which, however, the king of England thought he could not recede with honour; but, in all probability, he gained over Wol&s;ey entirely to his intere&s;t, by promi&s;ing to &s;upport his de&s;igns upon the papacy; and Henry a&s;&s;ured him that he would never engage with the French king in any mea&s;ure that &s;hould be prejudicial to his imperial maje&s;ty. After having been magnificently entertained during the holidays, he took leave of his aunt Catherine and Henry, and embarked at Sandwich for Flanders, very well &s;a|tisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it. That &s;ame day the king of England &s;ailed from Dover for Calais; and, on the fourth day of June, he removed with his own queen, the queen dowager of France, and all his retinue, to a &s;u|perb wooden hou&s;e, erected near the place of interview: it was furni&s;hed in the mo&s;t o&s;tentatious manner, and from the chappel there was a private gallery, that reached to the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Gui&s;nes. The hou&s;e, which Francis pitched near Ardres, was rather large than &s;umptuous; for he had intended to lodge in a pavilion of cloth of gold, which was blown down by the wind: &s;o that he was obliged to build a wooden edifice in a hurry. Before the two monarchs met, cardinal Wol&s;ey waited upon the French king with &s;ome propo&s;als touching the late alliance; and, after &s;ome conferences, Francis agreed that when the
<PB N="558" REF="5680">
million of crowns, &s;tipulated in the la&s;t treaty, &s;hould be liquidated, he &s;hould continue to pay to the king of England an annual pen&s;ion of one hundred thou&s;and livres; that, in ca&s;e of the dauphin's becoming king of England by his marriage with the prince&s;s Mary, this pen&s;ion &s;hould be continued to her and his heirs for ever; and that the differences between England and Scotland &s;hould be referred to the arbitration of Loui&s;a of Savoy, mother to the king of France, and cardinal Wol&s;ey. On the &s;eventh day of June the two kings met on hor&s;eback, in the valley of Arden, where they alighted; and, after mu|tual &s;alutation, walked arm in arm into a rich tent, pitched for their accom|modation. On Monday the eleventh day of the month, the ju&s;ts and tourna|ments began in &s;ight of the ladies, for whom &s;caffolds were erected. Both kings entered the li&s;ts, and behaved with great dexterity; though Henry bore away the honour of the field. He ran a tilt again&s;t mon&s;ieur de Grandeville, whom he di&s;abled at the &s;econd encounter. He engaged mon&s;ieur de Montmo|rency, whom, however, he could not unhor&s;e. He fought at faulchion with a French nobleman, who pre&s;ented him with his hor&s;e, in token of &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; he di&s;armed mon&s;ieur de Fleurange; and &s;ignalized him&s;elf above all others in throwing the javelin, wielding the &s;word and target, and fighting with the two handed &s;word, an exerci&s;e at which Francis was likewi&s;e very ex|pert. This monarch, probably, thought he &s;hould find his account in grati|fying Henry's vanity, by allowing him to enjoy this petty preheminence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polvd. Verg. H$ll. Herbert.</NOTE> The&s;e exerci&s;es being fini&s;hed, the two kings regaled each other with fea&s;ting, balls, ma&s;querades, and mutual pre&s;ents. They &s;eemed to vye with each other in &s;plendour and magnificence; in&s;omuch that the place of this interview was &s;tiled, The field of cloth of gold. At length they parted on the twenty|fourth day of June; and Henry, with his train, returned to Calais. On the tenth of July the king returned the emperor's compliment, by vi&s;iting him and his aunt Margaret at Gravelines; and next day they accompanied him back to Calais, where they were royally entertained. Francis was greatly alarmed at the&s;e reciprocal vi&s;its: and his jealou&s;y was not without foundation; for, on this occa&s;ion, they, in all probability, projected the alliance which was conclud|ed in the &s;equel. In the mean time Henry &s;ailed with the fir&s;t fair wind for England, where he and his retinue arrived in &s;afety; and Charles repaired to Aix-la-Chapelie, where he was &s;olemnly crowned emperor on the twenty-fir&s;t day of October.</P>

<P>Luther's doctrine having by this time gained ground in almo&s;t every di&s;trict of Germany, pope Leo, after having in vain attempted to &s;oothe him with promi&s;es, and intimidate him with threats, at length publi&s;hed a bull of excommunication again&s;t him and all his adherents. Luther appealed from this &s;entence to a general council, and &s;et his holine&s;s at defiance. Then the pope endeavoured to per&s;uade the elector of Saxony to put him to death, or &s;end him to Rome; but, that prince refu&s;ing to comply with his reque&s;t, the papal nuncio ordered Luther's books to be publicly burned at Cologne; and Luther, in revenge, committed the body of the canon law to the flames at Wirtemberg$ and publi&s;hed a book to ju&s;tify his conduct. He was &s;upported by the elector of Saxony, who pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to &s;ee a reformation in the church: he was &s;econded in his endeavours by Ulricus, Zuinglius, and Phi|lip Melancthon, a man of equal piety and learning; and he was encouraged to

Every zealous<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleidan.</NOTE> papi&s;t drew his pen again&s;t this performer; and, among the re&s;t, Henry king of England declared him&s;elf a champion of the Roman church. He was par|ticularly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE> ince$&s;ed again&s;t Luther for the liberties he had taken with Thomas Aquinas, an author in great reque&s;t both with the king and the cardinal. Thus animated, he compo&s;ed a book De Septem Sacramentis, in which he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed Luther in the article of indulgences, the number of &s;acra|ments, and the papal authority. This performance was pre&s;ented by John Clarke, dean of Wind&s;or, in full con&s;i&s;tory, to the pope, who received it with great &s;olemnity of applau&s;e; and, with the unanimous con&s;ent of the college of cardinals, i&s;&s;ued a bull, in which he be&s;towed upon Henry the honourable title of Fidei Defen&s;or, or, Defender of the Faith.</P>

<P>The emperor and the king of France were &s;o jealous of each other, that they wanted nothing but a pretext for commencing ho&s;tilities. Francis, therefore, on pretence of his rival's having infringed the treaty of Noyon, &s;ent an army into Navarre, under the command of Le&s;parre of the hou&s;e of Foix; who, finding that kingdom almo&s;t wholly de&s;titute of troops, reduced it in the &s;pace of fifteen days. Elevated with this &s;ucce&s;s, he entered Spain, and laid &s;iege to Logrogno, in the province of Guipu&s;coa. The Spaniards, though divided into factions, were &s;o alarmed at this inva&s;ion, that they united for their common &s;afety. Having a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, they defeated and took the French general, and recovered Navarre in le&s;s time than Le&s;parre had &s;pent in the conque&s;t of that kingdom. Francis, not contented with this at|tack, &s;pirited up a new enemy again&s;t Charles, in the per&s;on of Robert de la Marck, prince of Sedan, and &s;overeign of Bouillon; who, thinking him&s;elf injured by the emperor, &s;ent him a me&s;&s;age of defiance; and, putting him&s;elf at the head of five thou&s;and men, whom he had e$li$ted in France, inve&s;ted Vireton, a place in the province of Luxembourg. Charles immediately &s;um|moned the king of England to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, according to the &s;tipulations of the league of London; and Henry, influenced by the cardinal, was glad of this opportunity to lay the blame of the repture upon Francis. He forthwith &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to that prince, requiring him to de&s;i&s;t from all ho&s;tilities again&s;t the emperor, not only in Luxembourg, but likewi&s;e in Navarre; and Francis thought proper to comply with his demand, rather than furni&s;h Henry with a colour to declare for his rival. The French king had already concluded a league with the pope for conquering and dividing between them the king|dom of Naples; but, Francis di&s;tru&s;ting Leo's &s;incerity, and procra&s;tinating the ratification of this treaty, the pope &s;u&s;pected him in his turn, and privately engaged in a league with the emperor for driving the French out of the Mila|ne&s;e, and re&s;toring that dutchy to Francis Sforza. The pope enli&s;ted &s;ix thou|&s;and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> Swi&s;s in his &s;ervice, and augmented his forces on various pretences. The emperor ordered the viceroy of Naples to hold the troops of that kingdom
<PB N="560" REF="5700">
ready to march at the fir&s;t notice; and Pro&s;per Colonna was declared general of the league. Before they declared them&s;elves openly, they made un&s;ucce&s;s|ful attempts to &s;urprize Geno$, Milan, and Como; and, the &s;u&s;picion of Francis being a$ length arou&s;ed, he levied twenty thou&s;and Swi&s;s, and &s;ent them to Milan under the command of Lautrec. By this time Pro&s;per Colonna, having a&s;&s;embled his forces, inve&s;ted Parma; but was obliged to rai&s;e the $$ege by Lautrec, who pur&s;ued him beyond the boundaries of the Milane&s;e; and, &s;uppo&s;ing he had nothing further to fear from his efforts, withdrew L$&s;cun with his garri&s;on from Parma. The inhabitants immediately declared for the pope; Lautrec was abandoned by the Swi&s;s; and Pro&s;per Colo$$a, pur&s;$ing him in his turn, not only obliged him to retire to Como, but al&s;o &s;ubdued the whole Milane&s;e, except a few incon&s;iderable places.</P>

<P>The French, in all likelihood, would have been entirely expelled from Italy before the end of the campaign, had not the progre&s;s of the allies been &s;topped by the death of pope Leo, who is &s;aid to have died of exce&s;s of joy, at the &s;ucce&s;s of the league. The news of his decea&s;e no &s;ooner reached the army than the troops which he had enli&s;ted di&s;per&s;ed; and the Flore$tines returned to their own country: the duke of Ferrara recovered &s;ome of his pla|ces in the Romagna; and Francis Maria de la Rovera retrieved the dutchy of Urbino. Lautrec might now have triumphed in his turn, had he been properly &s;upported; but Francis was entirely engro&s;&s;ed by the means of de$e$ding him|&s;elf in Picardy and Flanders. The emperor, not contented with having hum|bled Robert de la Marck, a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, and be&s;towed the com|mand of it upon the count de Na$$au, who approaching Champagne, Francis repre&s;ented to the king of England that he could no longer forbear taking arms in his own defence, as Charles certainly intended to invade his dominions. Henry pretended $e would remain neuter in the quarrel; of which, however, he offered him&s;elf as the arbitrator, propo&s;ing, that they &s;hould &s;end their ple|nipo$$ntiaries, by the beginning of Augu&s;t, to Calais, where they &s;hould fi$d<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> cardinal Wol&s;ey, ve&s;ted with full power to act in his name as mediator. Charles willingly embraced this propo&s;al, becau&s;e he had made &s;ure of the favou$ite; and Francis dur&s;t not reject it, left he &s;hould di&s;oblige the king of England: it was therefore agreed that the plenipotenti$ries of the two monarchs, the pope's nuncio, and the cardinal, &s;hould meet at the appointed time and place; but, before this congre&s;s was opened, the lord of Liques, with an army of the em|peror's &s;ubjects, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Mortagne, and St. A$and, to which he laid &s;ome family claim; the governor of Flanders inve&s;ted Tour$$y, and the Imperiali&s;ts razed the town of Ardres.</P>

During this negotiation, the imperial ge|neral took Mouzon in Champagne, and be&s;ieged Mezieres; which, however, he could not reduce. Then he retired into the county of Namur; and, the French army, being by this time a&s;&s;embled, marched into Flanders; where they &s;ubdued &s;everal places of importance, and had well nigh &s;urprized the

<P>Wol&s;ey, after &s;ome feigned endeavours to find out other expedi|ents for a pacification, repaired to Bruges, where he concluded a league between Henry and the emperor again&s;t France, by which the king of England obliged him&s;elf, to attack Francis with an army of forty thou&s;and men; and to be&s;tow upon Charles the prince&s;s Mary, who had already been betrothed to the dau|phin. Thus, Henry declared him&s;elf the enemy of Francis, without the lea&s;t provocation; and, contrary to all the rules of &s;ound policy, con&s;idering the va&s;t power of the emperor, which it was his intere&s;t to ballance. But, this &s;tep was like all the re&s;t of his conduct, &s;ugge&s;ted by cardinal Wol$ey, who&s;e heart was &s;et upon the papacy, which he hoped to obtain by the influence of Charles, who had already procured for him the bi&s;hopric of Palencia in Ca&s;tile, with the admini&s;tration of the &s;ee of Badajox. His legation was protracted for two years; and Leo before his death had i&s;&s;ued a bull, impowering him to create fifty knights, as many counts palatine, the like number of acolytes and chap|lains, and forty apo&s;tolical notaries: to legitimate ba&s;tards, grant the doctor's degree in all the faculties, as well as all &s;orts of di&s;pen&s;ations: nay, to all the honours, wealth, and power he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he this year received the ad|dition of the rich abbey of St. Alban's in commendam. No wonder that a prelate of his ambition, thus forwarded by every gale of pro&s;perity, &s;hould a&s;pire at the highe&s;t dignity of the church. He is even &s;aid, to have been &s;o impatient to po&s;&s;e&s;s St. Peter's chair, that he was concerned in abridging the days of Leo by poi&s;on. Be that as it may, he was certainly &s;o arrogant as to affect con|tempt for the nobility of the kingdom; and &s;o vindictive, that the mo&s;t power|ful peer in England could not di&s;oblige him with impuity.</P>

<P>His revengef$l di&s;po&s;ition appeared too plainly in the fate of th$ duke of Buckingham, a we$k nobleman of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and the mo&s;t chil$i&s;h vanity, who was &s;o u$guarded as to &s;ay, in a private company, That &s;hould the king die without i&s;&s;ue, $e would lay claim to the crown as the de&s;cendant of Anne of Glouce&s;ter, grand-daughter of Edward III. and that, &s;hould he over a&s;cend the throne, $e would puni&s;h Wol&s;ey according to his demerit. This expre&s;&s;ion was reported to the cardinal, who fo$th with devoted hi$ to de&s;truction. He bribed &s;ome of his dome&s;tics to betray the private li$e and conver$ation of their ma&s;$er. From their i$formation, the cardinal learned that he corre&s;ponded with one Hopkins, a monk in the priory of Hinton, who pretended to the gift of prophecy; and flattered the duke with a&s;&s;urances of his &s;ucceeding to the throne of England. Wol&s;ey having thus collected &s;ufficient matter for an im|peachment, depriv$d him of his two principal &s;upports, the earl of Northum|berland, his father-in-law, who was committed to the Tower, on the frivolous pretence of his clai$ing &s;ome wa$ds to which he had no title; and his &s;on|in-law the earl of Surry, who was appointed governor of Ireland, that he might be at a di&s;tance from London. The&s;e previous &s;teps being taken, Edward Staf|ford duke of Buckingha$ was arre&s;ted, and accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on. The chief evidence again&s;t him was one K$evit, whom he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his &s;ervice $or &s;ome mi&s;de$ea$ours. He was taxed with having frequently con|&s;ulted Hopkins the monk, touching the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, as well as with $aving affected popularity; with having declared to Knevit, that if he were ill u&s;ed he would execute again&s;t Henry the &s;cheme which his father had project|ed again&s;t Richard III. whom that nobleman meaned to have a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated with a kni$e, had he been admitted into his pre&s;ence; and with having &s;aid to lord Abergavenny, that &s;hould the king die he would a&s;&s;ume the rule of the realm, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition; adding, that &s;hould the lord Abergavenny di&s;clo&s;e his purpo&s;e, be would call him to account in &s;ingle combat. He was tried by one duke, one marquis, &s;even earls, and twelve barons, before the duke of Norfolk, appointed high &s;teward for the occa&s;ion. When he heard the indictment read, he &s;aid, it was a fal&s;e, forged con&s;piracy: neverthele$s, he was convicted upon the evidence of Knevit, Hopkins, and two others; and condemned to die the death of a traitor. The duke of Norfolk could not help &s;hedding tears when he pronounced his &s;entence, to which he replied, <Q>&startq;My lord of Norfolk, you &s;peak to me as to a traitor; but, traitor was I never. My lords, I malign you not for what you have done; but, may the eternal God forgive you my death, as I do.

again&s;t the French king, for allowing the duke of Albany to r$turn to Scot|land from France, where he had been detained for &s;ome years at the reque&s;t of the Engli&s;h monarch, that he might intermeddle the more &s;ucce&s;sfully in the Scotti&s;h affairs during the ab&s;ence of the regent. Be&s;ides, he imagined the duke intended to marry his &s;i&s;ter, the queen dowager of Scotland, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;ued for a divorce from her hu&s;band the $arl of Angus; and the d$ke of Albany had &s;upported her &s;uit a$ the court of Rome. Notwith&s;tanding the pains which the regent took to clear him&s;elf of this &s;u&s;picion, by a&s;&s;uring Hen|ry he had no &s;uch intention; and t$at his own wife was alive, the king of England wrote a letter to the Scot$$&s;$ parliament, accu&s;ing the duke of a de&s;ign upon the crown, to the prejudice of the lawful &s;overeign; and de&s;iring them to expel him from the realm. To this charge they an&s;wered, That he had been mi&s;informed touching the de&s;igns of the duke of Albany, which were up|right and honourable: that he him&s;elf had acted again&s;t the $$tere&s;ts of his own nephew in &s;omenting di&s;turbances in his kingdom: and, that if he was not in|clined to renew the truce with the regent, they would e$deavour to defend their country from his attacks. When he received this an&s;wer, together with a let|ter from his &s;i&s;ter, reproaching him for his &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns upon her &s;on James, he ordered the lord Dacres to march with five hundred men to the borders of Scotland, and proclaim, that the Scotti&s;h parliament &s;hould make peace with him within a certain time at their peril. His aim was to furni&s;h his own party in that kingdom with a pretence for refu&s;ing to &s;erve the r$gent, &s;hould he at|tempt to make a diver&s;ion in favour of Francis. So far the expedient &s;ucceeded.

<P>Wol&s;ey was not &s;o chagrined at this mi&s;carriage, as at his di&s;ap|pointment with re&s;pect to the papacy. Though the emperor had promi&s;ed to &s;upport his preten&s;ions with all his intere&s;t, he had no intention to keep his word. He wanted to have a pope who &s;hould be wholly devoted to his intere&s;t; and he knew Wol&s;ey too well, to think he &s;hould be able to govern &s;uch a pon|tiff: he therefore re&s;olved to promote his own preceptor cardinal Adrian Flo|rentius, a native of Utrecht, to the papacy; and to conduct his election in &s;uch a manner, that he &s;hould not run the ri&s;que of for&s;eiting the friend&s;hip of Wol|&s;ey, who had reminded him of his promi&s;e; and &s;ent Richard Pace to manage his intere&s;t at Rome, immediately after the decea&s;e of Leo. Charles took his mea&s;ures on this occa&s;ion with &s;uch art and addre&s;s, that Adrian was unani|mou&s;ly cho&s;en pope in the conclave, without the emperor's appearing to inter|meddle<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicci$$dini.</NOTE> in the affair. The very choice, however, of this per&s;on, plainly pointed out the director of the election; and doubtle&s;s, Wol&s;ey mu&s;t have been equal|ly mortified and incen&s;ed again&s;t Charles; tho' he thought proper to &s;uppre&s;s his re&s;entment, in hope of being able to profit by the emperor's friend&s;hip on &s;ome future occa&s;ion, as the new pontiff Adrian VI. was old and infirm. On the other hand, Charles found it nece&s;&s;ary to keep up a friendly corre&s;pondence with the Engli&s;h cardinal, well knowing it intirely depended on that prelate, whe|ther or not he &s;hould live on amicable terms with Henry. It was therefore with a view to cultivate this friend&s;hip, that the emperor in his voyage to Spain, touched on the twenty-&s;ixth day of May at Dover, where he found the cardinal waiting for him with a magnificent retinue; and Henry in per&s;on, repairing to the &s;ame place, conducted him to Greenwich. From thence they went toge|ther to London, where they were entertained with great &s;plendor, the cardinal celebrating ma&s;s before them, with all the pomp of a &s;overeign pontiff: then the king invited Charles to Wind&s;or, where he was in&s;talled in the order of the garter, to which his brother Ferdinand had likewi&s;e been admitted.</P>

<P>After this ceremony, the two monarchs conferred together upon more important &s;ubjects, and ratified the treaty of Bruges in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner.

The contracting parties agreed, That Charles &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Mary, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould have attained the twelfth year of her age; and receive as her portion four hun|dred thou&s;and crowns, from which, however, Henry &s;hould deduct what he had lent to Maximilian: That if either party &s;hould recede from this contract of marriage, he &s;hould pay four hundred thou&s;and crowns to the other: That by a certain limited time, the emperor &s;hould invade France on the &s;ide of Spain with an army of forty thou&s;and men, while the king of England &s;hould enter Picardy with the like number: That neither peace nor truce &s;hould be concluded without their mutual con&s;ent: That the conque&s;ts made in France &s;hould belong to him who had the be&s;t preten&s;ions to the conquered places;

and, That in order to avoid all di&s;pute on this &s;ubject, they &s;hould declare their &s;eparate preten&s;ions before the beginning of the campaign: That the two powers &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t each other reciprocally, in ca&s;e the king of England might be inclined to &s;ubdue Scotland, or reduce Ireland to implicit obedience; or the emperor be di&s;po&s;ed to recover Guelderland or Frie&s;land; and in ca&s;e England &s;hould be attacked by the Scots, or Flanders by the duke of Guelderland: That they &s;hould &s;ubmit to the &s;piritual juri&s;diction of the cardinal of York, as pope's legate, and require him to pronounce the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t that prince who &s;hould fir&s;t violate the treaty, which in the mean time &s;hould be concealed from the knowledge of the common enemy: That the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<PB N="566" REF="5760">
in convocation at the &s;ame time, Wol&s;ey demanded a &s;ub&s;idy of half their re|venue, payable in five years; and tho' this exorbitant demand was oppo&s;ed by Fox and Fi$her, bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Roche&s;ter, the a&s;&s;embly was &s;o in|timidated by his great power, and vindictive di&s;po&s;ition, that they complied with his reque&s;t. Having carried his point in the convocation, he harangued the hou&s;e of commons upon the injuries which the king had &s;uffered at the hands of Francis, the nece&s;&s;ity of engaging in a war with that monarch; and concluded with a&s;king one fi$th of all lay effects, payable in four years. This extraordinary demand, tho' inforced by Sir Thomas Moo$e the &s;peaker, met with great oppo&s;ition; yet after ob$tinate debates, the commons agreed, That every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of twenty pounds and upwards, of yearly rent, &s;hould pay two &s;hillings in the pound; and the re&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing above two pounds, &s;hould give one &s;hilling in the pound: all under that &s;um, and above the age of &s;ixteen, were taxed at four pence a-head, to be payed in two years. The cardinal, incen&s;ed at their re|jecting his propo&s;al, repaired to the hou&s;e, and de&s;ired to hear their rea&s;ons for refu&s;ing his demands; but, they gave him to under&s;tand, that they never ar|gued in pre&s;ence of &s;trangers: and he thought proper to retire, extremely mor|tified at his repul&s;e. Yet the commons, to manife&s;t their zeal for the king's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE> &s;ervice, voted a con&s;iderable addition to the &s;ub&s;idy. In this parliament, &s;ome $tatutes were enacted in favour of deni&s;ons, who trafficked in the &s;ame commo|dities that were &s;old by aliens: for the regulation of the coin: for the conve|nience of &s;oldiers in the king's &s;ervice: for attainting the duke of Buckingham, and r$$toring his &s;on lord Henry Stafford, to his honours and e&s;tate: and, for impowering the king to repeal attainders, by his letters patent.</P>

Francis, who never dreamed of the&s;e machinations, was wholly employed in making preparations for recovering the dutchy of Milan; and the pope's heart was &s;et upon a general war again&s;t the Infidels. For this purpo&s;e he endeavoured to effect a truce between the European powers; and

the emperor d$clared, he would $illingly a&s;&s;$nt to the $word$ provided the truce could be &s;ettled for a term of years, during which t$$y $ight have time to execute &s;ome &s;cheme of import$nce.

The king, however, was at length informed by two of his dome&s;tics, that he carried on a private corre|&s;pondence with Charles, and repaired directly to Moulins, where he taxed him with this trea&s;onable communication.

Whether Francis believed his profe&s;&s;ions, or thought it would be dangerous to arre&s;t him in the mid&s;t of his own adherents, he ordered him to follow him to Lyon, and the con&s;table actually began the journey in a litter; but, under|&s;tanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du $ellay.</NOTE> that two of his confidents were arre&s;ted at court, he retired privately from his train with one attendant, and travelling through bye-ro$ds, arrived &s;afely in Germany.

<P>With re&s;pect to the campaign in Picardy, the king of England &s;ent an army of &s;ix hundred demilances, two hundred archers on hor&s;eback, three thou&s;and on foot, five thou&s;and billmen, and half that number of pioneers, to Calais, under the command of the duke of Suffolk, who dr$ughted as an addition &s;eventeen hundred &s;oldiers from that garri&s;on; and with the&s;e he made an irruption into the enemy's country. On the twentieth day of September he was joined by the count de Bure, with &s;uch a number of men as formed, together with the Engli&s;h, about twenty thou&s;and. Thus reinforced, the duke coa&s;ted the river Soam, and be&s;ieged Bray, which he took by a&s;&s;ault; then, pa&s;&s;ing the river, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Roye and Montdidier; and, in a word, advanced within eleven leagues of Paris, without meeting with the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, except in a &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;h with a body of French, commanded by mon&s;ieur de Pontdormy, who e&s;caped with great difficulty. Francis, ex|tremely alarmed at their progre&s;s, detached from Lyon the duke de Vendome, with all the troops he could a&s;&s;emble for the defence of his capital; and, the winter approaching with great &s;everity, the allies thought proper to retire, tho' they took Bouchain in their retreat; neverthele&s;s, all the places they had gar|ri&s;oned were immediately retaken by the French general. Henry had ordered the lord Montjoy to carry a reinforcement of &s;ix thou&s;and men to the duke of Suffolk, when he under&s;tood that nobleman had left his artillery at Valencien|nes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions pope Adrian died, not without &s;u&s;picion of poi&s;on, and the conclave was divided between cardinal Colonna and Julio de Medicis, ba&s;tard of pope Leo's uncle; who, after a debate that la&s;ted fifty days, was unanimou&s;ly elected pope, and a&s;&s;umed the name of Clement VII. Wol&s;ey no &s;ooner heard of Adrian's death, than he de&s;ired the king to write a letter with his own hand to the emperor, recommending him in the &s;tronge&s;t manner to the papacy: but Charles had already taken his mea&s;ures in favour of Julio; and the Engli&s;h cardinal affected to bear his di&s;appointment with a good grace.

<P>Henry was not $o engr$$$ed by his war with France, b$t that he &s;till inter$$ddl$d in the affairs of Scotland. His aim was to take the advan|tage of his nephew's minority, in order to &s;ubdue his country; and, as the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to this de&s;ign was the vigilance and activity of the duke of Al|bany, he endeavo$red to prevent that nobleman's return from France: $word$ o$|dered his admiral to intercept him, if po&s;&s;ible, on the narrow &s;eas; and, in the mean time, &s;ent the earl of Surry with an a$my, to intimidate his parti&s;ans in Scotland. The Engli&s;h forces entered that kingdom accordingly, where they took J$dburgh, and ravaged the neighbourhood; while the Scotti&s;h party, whom Henry had bribed to his intere&s;t, in$e&s;&s;$ntly exclaimed that nothing could &s;ave the kingdom from total ruin, but a peace with Engl$$d. At length the regent $ound $word$ to deceive the Engli&s;h admiral, and ar$ived at Edin|burgh$ where, convening the nobility, he exhorted them to oppo&s;e the de|$igas of Henry with vigour and di&s;patch. Though he found them generally aver&s;e to his propo&s;al, he a&s;&s;embled an army, and advanced to the frontiers; $$t the $ajority of the Scotti&s;h lords ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to cro&s;s the Engli&s;h border, all$dgi$g$ that it was &s;ufficient for them to defend their own country from i$va&s;ion. The duke, extremely morti$$ed at their refu&s;al, ordered the French $uxiliaries to be$iege the ca$tle of Wark, in which they made &s;ome pro|gro$$; and, when the breach was thought practicable, gave a de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault: but th$y were repul&s;ed with gre$t &s;laughter; and the regent, under&s;tanding that the ear$ of Surry was on his march to a$$ack him with a formidable army, t$ought proper to retire. In the mid&s;t of tho&s;e quarrels that divided the powers of Europe, the reformation gained ground in Germany: the canton of Zurich$ c$$verted by the preaching of Zuinglius, renounced civers articles of the Ro|mi&s;h religion; and Luther continued to w$$te in defence of his doctrine. Among other compo&s;itions he publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to Henry's performance, in which that prince finding him&s;elf abu&s;ed with great &s;currility, complained to the Saxon princes of Luther's in&s;olence, and de&s;ired they would prohibit him from publi&s;hing a tran&s;lation of the Bible in the High Dutch language: but his re|$on&s;trance produced very little effect.</P>

The duke of Bourbon, being rein|forced by &s;ix thou&s;and Land$que$$ts, and a body of Venetians, reduced the ca&s;tle of Cremona, and obliged Bonnivet to repa&s;s the Alps, when all the pla|c$s$ po$$e$$ed by the French in the Milane&s;e &s;urrendered to the Imperiali&s;ts. Th$n the duke, by the direction of the emperor, and the king of England, en|tered Provence, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Aix, and &s;ome other places$ and undertook the &s;iege of Mar&s;eilles; which, however, he was fain to rai&s;e at the approach of Fran$is, with an army of forty thou&s;and men. The duke of Bourbon, being obliged to retreat into Italy, Francis re&s;olved to march forthwith into the Milane&s;e by a &s;horter route; and the con&s;table, being appri&s;ed of his de&s;ign, redoubled his diligence, in order to fru&s;trate his intention.

viceroy of Naples at Pavia, threw &s;trong garri&s;ons into that city and Alexan|dria; and, as the plague raged at Milan, retired to Soncino. Francis now took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Milan without oppo&s;ition, and undertook the &s;iege of Pavia in the beginning of November. By this time he had detached the Venetians and Florentines from the intere&s;t of Charles; and now he engaged in a &s;ecret treaty with the pope, who obliged him&s;elf to grant a free pa&s;&s;age to his troops, de&s;tined for the conque&s;t of Naples. He accordingly in the &s;pring &s;ent thither a detachment of five or &s;ix thou&s;and men, under the command of the duke of Albany, who had then quitted Scotland; and though the pope feigned to op|po&s;e them at fir&s;t, he admitted them into the heart of his dominions, and then publi&s;hed his accommodation with the French king as the effect of compul&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The emperor, notwith&s;tanding his natural phlegm, was incen&s;ed at the defec|tion of his holine&s;s, and even threatened revenge; tho' Clement's league with Francis, in a great mea&s;ure, contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of the Imperial arms, as it induced Francis to divide his forces and weaken his army.</P>

<P>Mean while the court of England &s;eemed to adopt new maxims. Henry made no diver&s;ion in Picardy; he di&s;continued the payment of the &s;ub&s;idy he had granted to the duke of Bourbon; and even demanded reimbur&s;ement of the money he had lent to the emperor at his departure from England. Charles was alarmed at the&s;e concurring circum&s;tances, which &s;eemed to indicate an alienation in Henry; and his &s;u&s;picion was confirmed when he received intelligence from his amba&s;&s;ador in England, that a per&s;on, &s;ent by the dutche&s;s of Angouleme, regent of France, had long and frequent conferences with cardinal Wol&s;ey. He no longer doubted that this vindictive prelate, whom he had twice di&s;obliged in the affair of the papacy, would per|&s;uade the king of England to abandon his cau&s;e, and engage in a league with his enemy. He fore&s;aw that the cardinal would be &s;econded in his endeavours by the pope, who now payed great re&s;pect to the court of England. He con|firmed the title of Fidei Defen&s;or, which the king had obtained from Leo; at the de&s;ire of Wol&s;ey, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the mona&s;tery of St. Fride&s;wide in Ox|ford, on which &s;pot the cardinal intended to found a college, and endow it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act P$b.</NOTE> with the revenues of the convent. He, in the cour&s;e of this &s;ame year, i&s;&s;ued another bull, impowering the cardinal to &s;uppre&s;s as many mona&s;teries as he &s;hould think proper, to rai&s;e the yearly rent of three thou&s;and ducats for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and, in the month of December, he, with the king's con&s;ent, appointed cardinal Laurentius Campegius, bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1525.</NOTE> The French king &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in carrying on the &s;iege of Pavia, though his operations were very much impeded by the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on; and his convoys were greatly interrupted by the Imperial army, which had taken po&s;t at Ca$$ano. At length the duke of Bourbon, who had gone to Germany for a reinforcement, arrived with eleven thou&s;and men, an addition which ren|dered the Imperiali&s;ts more numerous than the French; and, on the twenty|fifth day of February, he attacked the camp of Francis, who was totally routed, and taken pri&s;oner. This unexpected event produced great alteration in the politics of the European princes. The kingdom of France was overwhelmed with con&s;ternation, and mu&s;t have been totally ruined, if the emperor had fol|lowed his blow, and the king of England acted in Picardy. But Charles was now become &s;o formidable, that the other princes began to deliberate upon the
<PB N="541" REF="5810">
formation of a league to counterpoi&s;e his greatne&s;s. The Venetians, in parti|cular, no &s;ooner were informed of the battle of Pavia, than they propo&s;ed &s;uch an alliance to the pope. But he preferred his own intere&s;t to the pub|lic cau&s;e, and concluded a &s;eparate treaty with the viceroy of Naples, who acted in the name of the emperor. Mean while Charles affected to receive the ti|dings of his victory with great moderation; and even pretended to &s;ympathize with the misfortunes of Francis, who was conveyed to Spain, and committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Madrid; not but that he had already propo&s;ed conditions of peace to Francis, which that monarch rejected as oppre&s;&s;ive and di&s;honourable. His &s;i&s;ter, the dutche&s;s of Alen&ccedil;on, arrived at the place of his confinement, with full powers from her mother the regent, to negotiate a peace; but the emperor in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;uch terms as were judged unrea&s;onable, and the captive king delivered to his &s;i&s;ter a writing &s;igned with his own hand; by which he ordered the &s;tates of France to crown his &s;on the dauphin. The parliament of Paris, however, did not think this mandate, which was called the edict of Madrid, a &s;ufficient authority to contravene the laws of the realm, in an affair of &s;uch importance. Charles, at bottom, was void of genero&s;ity, integrity, and compa&s;&s;ion. He inherited the phlegm of Maximilian, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Bellay.</NOTE> fraud of Ferdinand. He amu&s;ed Francis with a vague negotiation, and refu|&s;ed to ratify the treaty which his viceroy had concluded with the pope. Though he re-admitted Sforza into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Milan, according to his &s;ti|pulations with the allies, he, by means of his general in Italy, &s;educed him into a con&s;piracy which afforded a pretence for depriving him of his dominions. The Venetians, who were re&s;olved to hazard every thing rather than this dutchy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> &s;hould remain in the emperor's hands, told his amba&s;&s;ador, who pre&s;&s;ed them to re-unite with his ma&s;ter, that the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Sforza was a previous &s;tep, without which they would never enter into his mea&s;ures. The pope did not act with the &s;ame &s;pirit and fortitude; for, while be &s;eemed to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to the propo&s;als of Venice, touching a general league again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, he maintained a legate in Spain, to treat of a &s;eparate alliance. As this, however, was protracted until he began to de&s;pair of its being brought to perfection, he fixed a day for &s;igning the league with France and the Vene|tians; but, in this interval, he received intelligence of the treaty's being con|cluded at Madrid, and then retracted his promi&s;e to tho&s;e two powers. When the treaty arrived, he found it couched in terms &s;o dark and ambiguous, that he began to perceive he had been duped, and refu&s;ed to ratify &s;uch an equi|vocal engagement. The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador affirmed, that tho&s;e ambiguities<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> were unde&s;igned, and in order to gain time, de&s;ired he would draw up another according to his own judgment; engaging that in two months it &s;hould be &s;igned by the emperor.</P>

<P>The friend&s;hip between Charles and the king of England &s;eemed to be on the wane even before the battle of Pavia. Though the princeis Mary was betrothed to the emperor, her father offered her in marriage to the king of Scotland; and, on the other hand, the emperor made no &s;cruple to conclude his marriage with I&s;abella of Portugal, notwith&s;tanding his engagement to the Engli&s;h prince&s;s. Neverthele&s;s, in the month of March he had &s;ent the lord of Bure and the pre&s;ident of the council of Mechlin into England, to demand
<PB N="572" REF="5820">
that the prince&s;s and her portion &s;hould be &s;ent to him without delay; and that Henry &s;hould, according to his engagement, enter Picardy with a powerful army. Not but that Charles had real cau&s;e to complain. The king of England had promi&s;ed to furni&s;h one hundred thou&s;and crowns a month, towards the duke of Bourbon's expedition into France; but, after the fir&s;t payment, he put a &s;top to this &s;ob&s;$dy. At the &s;ame time he demanded reimbur&s;ement of the &s;ums he had l$$t the emperor, when he knew that prince was in no con|dition to comply with his demand. Before the amba&s;&s;adors of Charles received their an&s;wer at the court of London, the news of the battle of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis, arrived in England, in a letter from the gouveruante of Flanders; and though this account was by no means agreeable to Henry, he di&s;&s;embled his &s;entiments &s;o far as to order a &s;olemn Te Deum to be celebrated at St. Paul's, he him&s;elf a&s;&s;$$ling in per&s;on at the ceremony. In a few days after the arrival of the&s;e $$dings he a&s;&s;embled his council to deliberate upon the po$$ure of affairs in Europe; and the debates turned upon this que&s;tion: Whether the king &s;hould &s;eize this opportunity to make conque&s;ts in France, and avail him&s;elf of his right to that kingdom; or &s;uccour France with a view to countexpoi&s;e the exorbitant power of the empetor? The inclinations of the king and cardinal, which at this time happened to coincide with the dictates of found policy, determined the council in favour of the captive king: and now nothing was wa$$ing but a pr$$$$e to ju&s;tify a rupture with the emperor.</P>

<P>Henry forth with di&s;patched Cuthbert Ton&s;tal, bi&s;hop of London, and Sir Robert Wingfield, as his amba&s;&s;adors, into Spain, to repre&s;ent to the emperor, that as the war had been carried on at the common expence, it was but rea&s;onable that the king of England &s;hould reap &s;ome advantage from the victory of Pavis. He therefore de&s;ired, that in the treaty with the captive king, which was on the carpet, it might be &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould be put in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of what properly belonged to him in France. If this ju&s;tice could not be ob|tained by fair means, he demanded, the emperor, in pur&s;uance of his treaty with Henry, &s;hould invade France on the &s;ide of Spain, while the Engli&s;h &s;hould act in Picardy; and that the war &s;hould not be di&s;continued until the Engli&s;h monarch &s;hould have received full &s;atisfaction. He likewi&s;e ob&s;erved that the contracting parties of the treaty of Wind&s;or had mutually engaged to deliver the pri&s;oners to him of the two who&s;e dominions tho&s;e pri&s;oners &s;hould appear to have u&s;urped; he, therefore, required Charles to give up the captive king to the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, as &s;oon as he him&s;elf &s;hould receive the prince&s;s Mary, to whom he was contracted. Henry knew that he could not fulfil his engage|ment with his daughter, becau&s;e he had already re&s;olved upon a marriage with I&s;a|bella of Portugal; and that he would not act &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to his own intere&s;t, as to give up a pri&s;oner of &s;uch con&s;equence: accordingly the em|peror an&s;wered in vague and general terms, &s;uch as implied a refu&s;al. Then<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.

Not that he intended to declare war again&s;t Charles. He ordered his amba&s;&s;adors in Spain to intercede in favour of the captive monarch; and, in the mean time, &s;ignified his &s;entiments to the regent of France, who immediately appointed Jean Joachin de Pa&s;&s;au, lord of

<P>Henry in$ru$ted the management of this, as of every other af|fair, to Wol&s;ey; and tho' his friend&s;hip was of &s;uch importance to France, that he might have &s;old it at a very high price, he would take no advantage of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of its king; all he demanded was &s;ecurity for the &s;ums legally due to him from that monarch. All the articles being adju&s;ted, five &s;eparate treaties were &s;igned at Moore, on the thirtieth day of Augu&s;t. The fir&s;t contained a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive between France and England, comprehending the allies of both kings. The &s;econd related to the payment of the &s;ums due to Henry by the king of France, as &s;pecified in &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive treaties. In lieu of the&s;e, the regent engaged in her &s;on's name, to pay two millions of crowns of gold, at different in&s;tallments; and that, in ca&s;e of Henry's dying before the debt &s;hould be liquidated, the remainder &s;hould be made good to his heirs and &s;uc$e&s;&s;o$s: whereas, &s;hould he &s;urvive the entire payment of the &s;um, he &s;hould afterward$ receive a pen&s;ion of one hundred thou&s;and crowns for life. In the third treaty, the regent obliged her&s;elf to pay up all the arrears o$ jointu$e due to Henry's &s;i&s;ter Mary, queen dowager of France, and take mea&s;ures for her being punc|tually &s;upplied for the future. The fourth imported, that the king of Scot|land &s;hould not be deemed as an ally of France, included in this agreement, provided the Scots &s;hould commit any act of ho&s;tility again&s;t England after the twenty-fifth day of December. In the fifth treaty, the court of France promi&s;ed, that it would not directly nor indirectly, con&s;ent to the return of the duke of Albany to Scotland during the minority of James V. All the&s;e treaties<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> were rati$ied upon oath, by the regent of France, approved by the parliaments of Paris, Tholou&s;e, and Bourdeaux; the noblemen and cities obliged them&s;elves by letters patent to ob&s;erve them; and Francis I. &s;ent a ratification of them under his own hand, in a writing dated on the twenty-&s;eventh day of December. Nor did the regent of France forget the good offices of cardinal Wol&s;ey on this occa&s;ion. She obliged her&s;elf to pay the arrears of the pen&s;ion which had been &s;ettled upon him in lieu of the admini&s;tration of the bi&s;hopric of Tour|nay; and for other good rea&s;ons, promi&s;ed to gratify him with one hundred thou&s;and crowns of gold.</P>

<P>This pre&s;ent helped to con&s;ole him for the anx$ety he had lately experienced from the king's diplea&s;ure. Money being wanted for the occa&s;ions o$ government, Wol&s;ey, in&s;tead of applying to parliament, where he had already &s;uffered a repul&s;e, i&s;&s;ued a decree, in the king's name, to levy through the whole kingdom, one &s;ixth of all lay revenues, and a fourth of the clergy's effects. This was con&s;idered as &s;uch a $lagrant infraction of the Magna charta, that it excit$d univer&s;al cla$our over the whole nation, and had well nigh produced a rebel|lion. The king being informed of the commotions among his people, pub|li&s;hed a proclamation, d$$avowing the commi$$ions expedited in his name, de|claring, that he would never exact any thing of his people by co$pul&s;ion$ and demanding nothing but what they &s;hould plea&s;e to contribut$ in the way of Benevolence, an expedient which had been practi&s;ed in the reign of the fourth Edward.

name, what the &s;ubjects refu&s;ed to give under that of a decree or commi&s;|&s;ion; for, certain &s;ums were demanded at the king's plea&s;ure; &s;o that the bene$volence was equivalent to a grievous taxation. The magi&s;trates of London refu&s;ed to comply with the impo&s;ition, alledging, that the expedient of bene|volence had been aboli&s;hed by Richard III. The cardinal replied, that Richard was a tyrant and u&s;urper, who&s;e laws ought to have no effect upon the prero|gative. He tampered in &s;ecret with the mayor and aldermen; yet, before he could either cajole or intimidate them into a compliance, an in&s;urrection hap|pened in the neighbourhood of London; but, the in&s;urgents were &s;oon quelled, and &s;ome of them committed to pri&s;on. The king thinking it nece&s;&s;ary to de|mon&s;trate, that he had no intention to oppre&s;s the people, declared in council, that no per&s;on &s;hould be puni&s;hed for this in&s;urrection; and the pri&s;oners were di&s;charged, after having appeared at the council-board, and been &s;everely re|buked for their in&s;olence. The cardinal affected to become bound for their future good behaviour; and endeavoured to ju&s;tify his conduct, by &s;aying, he had done nothing but by the advice of the judges. It was no &s;ooner known, that the king did not approve of all the cardinal's proceedings, than a great num|ber of complaints was exhibited again&s;t that prelate. Allen his chaplain, and in|&s;trument of oppre&s;&s;ion, was &s;o vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted in a court of judicature, for his extortion, that the affair became the &s;ubject of general conver&s;ation; and at length reached the ears of Henry, who took &s;ome pains to inform him&s;elf of the particulars. In the cour&s;e of this inquiry, he obtained a full view of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$ll. Holling&s;hed.</NOTE> unpopular &s;ide of Wol&s;ey's admini&s;tration; and was &s;o incen&s;ed, that he had well nigh dive&s;ted that mini&s;ter of his favour and employments. Ignorant as he was of the cardinal's oppre&s;&s;ive conduct, he had imagined the people thought them&s;elves extremely happy under his mild government; but, now he was di&s;abu&s;ed, and gave way to the tran&s;ports of his choler, which the mini&s;ter could not appea&s;e without the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. He produced his will, in which he had bequeathed all his riches to the king; and at length, found means to per&s;uade him, that all the exce&s;&s;es he had committed in the exerci&s;e of his authority, were owing to his de&s;ire of augmenting his maje&s;ty's inheri|tance. This &s;torm was no &s;ooner overblown, than he removed from the king's ear all tho&s;e whom he &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection to his intere&s;t; and the palace of Hampton-Court being ju&s;t fini&s;hed at his expence, he pre&s;ented it to his ma&s;ter, who gave him Richmond in exchange, together with the warme&s;t a&s;&s;urances of unint$rrupted affection. About this period the king created his natural &s;on Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond and Somer&s;et, earl of Nottingham, lieu|tenant-general beyond the Trent, warden of the borders, and afterwards, ad|miral of England, though he was but &s;ix years of age. Having no legitimate &s;on, he expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s for this child, who was the fruit of an amour with Mrs. Elizabeth Blount, a young lady of extraordinary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

In the beginning of this year, the government of Scotland, which &s;ince the departure of the duke of Albany, remained in the hands ofthe earl of Angus, &s;ent the earl of Ca&s;&s;ils with other amba&s;&s;adors into England, to treat of the marriage between their young king and the prince&s;s Mary, a match with which Henry had for &s;ome time amu&s;ed the Scotti&s;h admini&s;tration. As divers difficulties occurred, the truce between the two nations was prolonged

from January to March, that the earl might have time to return to his own country for fre&s;h in&s;tructions; but as Henry was never in earne&s;t upon this &s;ubject, the negotiation produced no effect.</P>

<P>The league of Moore in&s;pired the regent of France with fre&s;h cou|rage, and in a great mea&s;ure, influenced the conduct of the pope and Venetians: the emperor recalled his amba&s;&s;adors from England; and in a little time concluded his marriage with I&s;abella of Portugal. The pope finding him&s;elf &s;till duped by Charles, gave him to under&s;tand, that no peace was to be expected without the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Sforza in the Milane&s;e; and indeed, he was now on the eve of a war, in which he would have been unable to cope with &s;uch a number of powerful antagoni&s;ts. This con&s;ideration co&s;t him great un|ea&s;ine&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. An. 1526.</NOTE> and perplexity, from which however he was &s;oon relieved by the im|patience of Francis, who growing more and more tired of confinement, gave up the great point, which had hitherto retarded the pacification. This was the dutchy of Burgundy, and the &s;upremacy of Flanders and Artois, which, by the treaty of Madrid, he ceded to the emperor, obliging him&s;elf moreover, to marry that prince's &s;i&s;ter Eleonora: to renounce his preten&s;ions to Naples, Mi|lan, Genoa, Ath, Tournay, Li&s;le, and He&s;din: to per&s;uade Henry D'Albret to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

He likewi&s;e promi&s;ed, upon the faith and word of a king, that he would either ratify the treaty in France, or return to the place of his confinement. On the&s;e conditions, he was &s;et at liberty, and conducted to the frontiers of Spain by Lannoy, viceroy of Naples, who attended him to Bourdeaux; and pre&s;&s;ed him to perform his promi&s;e. His fir&s;t care was to ratify the treaty of Moore, concluded with the king of England; but, that of Ma|drid, he renounced as the effect of compul&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s, he offered to pay two millions of crowns in lieu of the dutchy of Burgundy, which he raid, he could not alienate; and to perform every other article of the engage|ment. This propo&s;al was rejected by Charles, who hoped he would one day be glad to retrieve his children, who were ho&s;tages, by a literal execution of the treaty.</P>

<P>Mean while, the amba&s;&s;adors of the pope and the Venetians, waited upon Francis at Cognac, where the three powers concluded a league again&s;t the emperor, in which the duke of Milan was comprehended. His holine&s;s and the republic of Venice, depending upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France and England, &s;ent an army into the field under the command of the duke D'Urbino, who &s;uffered the ca&s;tle of Milan to be taken by the Imperiali&s;ts, mi&s;carried in an attempt upon Genoa, and acted with great indifference in the cau&s;e of his con&s;tituents. Mean while, the duke de Se&s;&s;o the Spani&s;h am|ba&s;&s;ador at Rome, and Hugh de Moncada, who commanded the imperial<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> troops in the kingdom of Naples, in&s;tigated the Colonnae again&s;t the pope;
<PB N="576" REF="5880">
and they entered the city of Rome by &s;urprize, at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> men. Clement was &s;o terrified at this unexpected a&s;&s;au$t, that he took &s;helter in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo; and was obliged to conclude a truce for four months with the emperor, before he could be rid of &s;uch trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts. He and the Venetians expected, that in con&s;equence of the treaty of Cognac, the king of France and England would act vigorou&s;ly again&s;t Charles; but now they found them&s;elves duped by the French king, who&s;e &s;ole view in concluding and publi&s;hing the treaty, was to intimidate the emperor into a compliance with his propo&s;al. Even after the pope and Venetians had declared war again&s;t Charles, he &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux to repeat the offer of two mil|lions<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> for Burgundy, which the emperor rejected with di&s;dain, de&s;iring the amba&s;&s;ador would tell his ma&s;ter, he had acted ba&s;ely and wickedly; and that he ought not to have forgot the la&s;t conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between them at Madrid. His affairs had lately re&s;umed a more favourable a&s;pect in Italy; the baron de Frond$perg had marched thither, at the head of forty thou&s;and men rai&s;ed in Germany; and Lannoy had arrived at Naples with a body of Spani&s;h troops. Clement, and the Venecians, exhau&s;ted all their art and eloquence to engage the king of England in the league of Cognac: they tried to flatter his vanity with the title of Protector, hoping, that he would as formerly &s;quander away his wealth for the intere&s;t of his neighbours; but, time and experience had ripened his under&s;tanding, and the trea&s;ure left by his father was already expended: he was loth to forego the tranquillity which he enjoyed; and his favourite was wholly ingro&s;&s;ed with the foundation of his college at<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Oxford. Neverthele&s;s, Henry being informed of the pope's nece&s;&s;ities, which in all probability, might oblige him to make peace with the emperor, furni&s;hed him with thirty thou&s;and ducats, which enabled him to maintain his forces under the duke D'Urbino; although, at the &s;ame time, he continued to treat of a &s;eparate peace with the viceroy of Naples. His maxim was to have always two &s;trings to his bow; but, on this occa&s;ion he refined too much in his politics.</P>

Clement, being apprized of Bourbon's march, con|cluded a truce for eight months with the viceroy, obliging him&s;elf to pay a certain &s;um to the duke of Bourbon; and then di&s;banded the greate&s;t part of his army, before he knew the &s;entiments of the duke him&s;elf, who was in full march to Bologna. That prince refu&s;ed to ratify the truce, becau&s;e the &s;um &s;tipulated was not &s;ufficient for the payment of his forces; &s;o that an|other agreement was made; and the pope di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the re&s;t of his &s;oldiers, that he might not be incumbered with an unnece&s;&s;ary expence. Notwith|&s;tanding this convention, the duke of Bourbon &s;uddenly began his march for Rome, which was immediately filled with con&s;ternation. Renzo de Ceri, in this emergency, undertook to rai&s;e an army within the city, that &s;hould defend it again&s;t all in&s;ults; and Clement tru&s;ting to his promi&s;e, took no

other mea&s;ures for his own per&s;onal &s;afety. The duke of Bourbon arriving in the neighbourhood, pretended his route was to Naples; and &s;ent a trumpet to the pope, to demand a pa&s;&s;age through the city. This being refu&s;ed, he next morning approached by favour of a thick fog; and ordered his army to &s;torm a breach, which the Romans had not found time to repair. In the beginning of the attack he was killed by a mu&s;ket-&s;hot; but, the prince of Orange order|ing a cloak to be thrown over his body, continued the a&s;&s;ault until the breach was forced; and the Imperiali&s;ts made a lodgment in the &s;uburbs. Then the pope retired to the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo, with thirteen cardinals, &s;ome foreign am|ba&s;&s;adors, and &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. Mean while, the German troops &s;acked the city, and committed terrible outrages. The army of the allies, un|der<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> the duke D'Urbino, arrived in the neighbourhood, but retired without having made the lea&s;t attempt for the relief of his holine&s;s, who finding him|&s;elf in danger of being &s;tarved, capitulated with the prince of Orange; and was put into the cu&s;tody of Alarcon, who had guarded Francis in his capti|vity. This confinement of the pope was advantageous to &s;everal princes and &s;tates of Italy. The duke of Ferrara made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Modena; the Venetians &s;eized Ravenna and Servia; Sigi&s;mund Malate&s;ta &s;urprized Rimi|ni; and the Florentines recovered their liberty, after having expelled the pope's legate.</P>

<P>Had the Imperial army proceeded immediately to reduce Bo|logna, and the towns of Romagna, the emperor would have been rendered in|vincible in Italy; but, they were &s;o eager after plunder, that they neglected their ma&s;ter's affairs; and allowed Francis to &s;end troops over the Alps, in order to &s;top their progre&s;s. That monarch had at length prevailed upon the king of England, to engage with him in a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive again&s;t Charles. Henry had &s;ent Sir William Fitzwilliams to France, in order to &s;ignify his a&s;&s;ent to the propo&s;al, and offer his daughter Mary, in marriage to Francis, who joyfully embraced this overture. A negotiation was begun by the bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Sir William Fitzwilliams; but, &s;ome difficulties occurring, Francis &s;ent a &s;o|lemn emba&s;&s;y to London, where his plenipotentiaries treated with the cardi|nal, who was appointed the king's commi&s;&s;ioner for this purpo&s;e. Three treaties were concluded, importing, That the two kings &s;hould &s;end amba&s;&s;a|dors to the emperor with rea&s;onable offers, touching the relea&s;e of the ho&s;tages, and a demand of the &s;ums he owed to the king of England; to which, &s;hould he fail in returning an acceptable an&s;wer, within twenty days, they &s;hould de|clare war again&s;t him without further delay: That the prince&s;s Mary &s;hould be given in marriage to Francis, or to his &s;on the duke of Orleans, as he &s;hould think proper: That the war &s;hould be carried on conjunctly in the Low Coun|tries, according to a certain &s;tipulated proportion; and, That a fleet &s;hould be equipped at their joint-expence, to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy by &s;ea: That the king of Portugal, or any other prince, e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of Charles, &s;hould be deemed and declared an enemy: That the pope and Venetians &s;hould be comprehended in the league, on condition of their maintaining the war in Italy: That Henry &s;hould renounce, for him&s;elf and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, all right and preten&s;ions to the crown or territories of France; in con&s;ideration of which ce&s;&s;ion, Francis and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors &s;hould pay to all &s;ucceeding kings of England, a perpetual pen&s;ion of

fifty thou&s;and crowns, to commence at the death of Henry, who was already intituled to two millions by the treaty of Moore; and that, over and above this pen&s;ion, Francis &s;hould furni&s;h the king of England annually, with &s;alt of Brouage to the value of fifteen thou&s;and crowns: That this treaty &s;hould be approved and &s;igned by the archbi&s;$ops, bi&s;hops, princes, dukes, counts, barons, and other noblemen of both kingdoms, who&s;e names were &s;pecified in the ar|ticle, by the parliaments of Paris, Tholou&s;e, Rouen, and Bourdeaux, as well as by all the courts of judicature in England; and confirmed by the &s;tates of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> France and England, as a perpetual and inviolable con&s;titution.

<P>The&s;e treaties being ratified, the king of England &s;ent Sir Francis Poyntz to Spain, to demand of Charles, that as he had been at half the expence of the war, he &s;hould have half the booty taken at Pavia, together w$$h one of the ho&s;tages of Francis; and Clarencieux the herald, accompanied t$is envoy in di&s;gui&s;e, that he might denounce war, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al. Charles, who plainly peceived that Henry wanted nothing but a pretext for a rupture, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to gain time. He an&s;wered with great gravity, that the me&s;&s;age being of great importance, he would deliberate with him&s;elf upon the nature of it; and &s;ignify his determination by a letter to the king of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.</NOTE> England. This procra&s;tination being deemed equivalent to a repul&s;e, Francis ordered Lautrec to begin his march with the forces de&s;tined for Italy; and cardi|nal Wol$ey &s;et out for the continent, in order to confer with the French king at Amiens. He arrived at Calais on the eleventh day of July, and repaired to Abbeville, with a train of one thou&s;and hor&s;e gaily capari&s;oned. He was re|ceived on the frontiers of France with the &s;ame honours that would have been payed to the king of England. Francis complimented him with letters patent, impowering his great friend the cardinal to relea&s;e the pri&s;oners in all the places through which he pa&s;&s;ed, except &s;uch as were confined for trea&s;on, rape, and murder. While he waited at Abbeville until the king of France &s;hould come to Amiens, he received a memorial from the emperor, who now &s;eemed de&s;ir|ous of a pacification. The king of France had offered to execute the treaty of Madrid, provided Francis S$orza &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Milan: That Charles &s;hould receive, in lieu of Burgundy, two millions of golden crowns, &s;end queen Eleonora with the two ho&s;tages to France, allowing that prince&s;s a dower in proportion to the great &s;um he was to touch; and pay what he owed to the king of England. To the&s;e propo&s;itions the emperor now replied, That his right to B$$gund$ &s;hould remain in full force as before the treaty of Madrid: That all the articles of that treaty &s;hould be executed, except &s;uch as he &s;hould now con&s;ent to wave: That he hoped the king of England, and the lord legate, would $word$ upon the French king to a$g|ment the &s;um of two millions he had offered; at lea&s;t, he in&s;i&s;ted upon its being payed, over and above what he Charles owed to the king of England, a debt which Francis had bound him&s;elf to di&s;charge; and be&s;ides the re&s;titution of
<PB N="579" REF="5910">
the effects belonging to the late duke of Bourbon, as it was but rea&s;onable that his heirs &s;hould receive the benefit of this treaty: That the queen his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould be &s;ent to France with the ho&s;tages, as &s;oon as the other articles could be executed: That Francis Sforza being accu&s;ed of trea&s;on, the emperor would appoint competent judges to try that nobleman; and, in ca&s;e of his being found innocent, he &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his dutchy; but, if convicted, the &s;tate of Milan &s;hould remain at the di&s;po&s;al of the emperor, according to ju&s;tice and rea&s;on: and la&s;tly, That the king of England &s;hould become guarantee of the treaty. He moreover demanded, That Francis would indemnify him for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sandoval. Herbert.</NOTE> expences to which he had been expo&s;ed from the league that monarch had formed again&s;t him, leaving the e&s;timation of that expence to the king of Eng|land, who was perfectly well acquainted with the nature of all their tran&s;ac|tions. He &s;aid, he &s;till con&s;idered the legate as his friend; he declared him&s;elf &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed towards a pacification, that if the king of England &s;hould think his propo&s;als unrea&s;onable, he would make greater conce&s;&s;ions for him than for any prince in Europe; and as a mark of his &s;ingular e&s;teem for that monarch, de&s;ired, that all the world would a&s;cribe to him the glory of having effected the accommodation.</P>

<DIV4 N="81" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LXXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e advances were rejected by the kings of France and Eng|land, who were now bent upon the pro&s;ecution of the war; and the cardinal meeting Francis at Amiens, three new treaties were concluded to the following effect: That the duke of Orleans &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Mary; and the treaty of Moore remain in full force: That the king of England &s;hould form no claim upon Francis for the money he &s;hould expend in the war of Italy; but pay a certain contribution, in proportion to the number of troops which the French king &s;hould maintain in that country. The &s;econd treaty related to trade, and &s;pecified certain privileges, which Francis granted to the Engli&s;h merchants. In the third, the two kings agreed that they would never con&s;ent to the convocation of a general council, during the pope's captivity: that they would receive no bull, brief, or mandate, from his holine&s;s, until he &s;hould be &s;et at liberty; but, in the mean time, punctually execute every thing that &s;hould be determined in England by the cardinal legate, wth the concurrence of the clergy; and, in France, by the principal members of the Gallican church. The&s;e conventions being ratified, the contracting parties thought proper to make &s;ome an&s;wer to the propo&s;itions of the emperor. Francis &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of S$orza$ and the relea&s;e of the ho&s;tages; while Henry, in a formal manner, demanded payment of the &s;ums which Charles had borrowed of him&s;elf and his father; together with five hundred thou&s;and crowns, which he had engaged to forfeit, in ca&s;e he &s;hould not e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Mary: he likewi&s;e in&s;i&s;ted upon being indemnified by Charles for the arrears of the pen&s;ion due to him from France, according to a &s;tipulation in the treaty of Wind&s;or; and la&s;tly, he required him not only to relea&s;e his holine&s;s, but al&s;o to make good the damage he had &s;u&s;tained from the Imperial forces. To the&s;e demands the emperor an&s;wered, That he had never denied the debt he owed to the king of England: that he would inform that monarch, by letter, of his rea&s;ons for thinking him&s;elf acquitted of the penalty upon the contract of marriage; and that he had already &s;ent orders to Italy, to &s;et the pope at liberty.</P>

<P>This was not the fir&s;t time that Henry had interpo&s;ed in be|half of Clement; who, together with his thirteen fellow-pri&s;oners, had, in let|ters, &s;ollicited the king's protection. Henry had written in their behalf to Charles, who an&s;wered in general terms, That he would do all that lay in his po$er for the &s;atisfaction of the king of England: but, he had, by this time, re&s;olved to convey Clement to Spain, where he thought he could manage him more for his advantage, than while he remained in Italy; and, in the mean time, he carried his deceit to &s;uch a ridiculous length, as to order public prayers to be put up for the deliverance of his holine&s;s. At the &s;ame time he endea|voured to excite jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t between the kings of France and England. He propo&s;ed to the cardinal a $atch between Henry's natural &s;on, the duke of Richmond, and I&s;abella, prince&s;s of Portugal, to whom he offered to give the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> dutchy of Milan as a dower; and the king affected to be plea&s;ed with the pro|po&s;al, for his own convenience. But it was not in the power of the emperor to &s;hake the good under&s;tanding between him and Francis; who, about this time, &s;ent Anne de Montmorency, with the order of St. Michael, to his new ally; and Henry, in return, complimented him with the garter, by the hands of Ar|thur<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

Charles likewi&s;e at|tempted to gain over the cardinal by advantageous offers, but Wol&s;ey was too far engaged with Francis to retreat; or he was determined at all events to be revenged on the emperor, by whom he had been twice deceived; and perhaps the king's divorce from Catherine was already re&s;olved upon, in which ca&s;e he could not po&s;&s;ibly e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;t of Charles. Certain it is, the car|dinal, in a letter to the king, dated on the thirty-fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, told him it was already reported in Spain, that his maje&s;ty intended to obtain a di|vorce, and coun&s;elled him to &s;end orders to his amba&s;&s;adors in that country, to &s;tifle the rumour as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, by alledging it had no other foundation than &s;ome &s;cruples expre&s;&s;ed by the bi&s;hop of Tarbe, on the &s;ubject of the pro|jected match between the duke of Orleans and the prince&s;s Mary, as if there had been &s;ome room to doubt her legitimacy.</P>

Andrea Doria, who commanded the French gallies, reduced Genoa under the dominion of Francis, in the beginning of the campaign; and Lautrec, being joined by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> marquis de Saluces, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Vigevano, Alexandria, and Pavia. Then he began his march for Naples, was admitted into Parma and Placentia; the duke of Ferrara declared for France, and his example was &s;oon followed by<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$r$i.</NOTE> the duke of Mantua.

<P>IT was during the pope's confinement, that king Henry fir&s;t declared his intention of being divorced from his wife Catherine, though, in all probability, the re&s;olution was taken before this period; ina&s;much as we find$
<PB N="584" REF="5960">
by the cardinal's letter to the king, that the report was current in Spain, while he continued at Abbeville. Some hi&s;torians, in order to blacken the character of Henry, and tarni&s;h the merit of the reformation in England, have repre|&s;ented the king's pretended &s;cruples as the effect of his pa&s;&s;ion for Anne Boleyn, daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn, a young lady who had been educated in France; and was at this juncture a maid of honour to queen Catherine. They likewi&s;e have, with great virulence, endeavoured to depreciate her per&s;on and her morals; and, in the cour&s;e of their contumely, fallen into divers $word$ which have been detected and expo&s;ed by authors of more credit<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anti$$$der$s. B$$net. Herbert.</NOTE> and veracity. The&s;e have not only $word$ her cal$mniators, but al&s;o proved that Henry was determined upon the divorce before Anne Boleyn returned to England. The king had an ingredient of &s;uper&s;tition in his character, and could not help imputing the death of his two &s;ons to the di&s;plea&s;ure of God almighty, at his ince&s;tuous marriage with his brother's widow. He was ex|tremely de&s;irous of male i&s;&s;ue, that all di&s;putes about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion might be prevented. He was &s;tartled at the ob&s;ervation of the bi&s;hop of Tarbe, who expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts about his daughter's legitimacy: he was tired of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing Catherine, who was not mi&s;tre&s;s of many per&s;onal attractions: he was a prince of impetuous pa&s;&s;ions, and longed to be united with a lady of more endearing qualifications, by whom he might be ble&s;&s;ed with male i&s;&s;ue, again&s;t who&s;e legitimacy no plau&s;ible exceptions could be taken. His &s;cruples of con&s;cience fir&s;t rai&s;ed by the writings of Thomas Aquinas, were encouraged by Wo$$ey, who hated the queen, becau&s;e &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed her di&s;approbation of his loo&s;e and libertine way of living; and he was actuated by revenge again&s;t her nephew the emperor, who had twice baffled him in his de&s;igns upon the papacy. Henry thought he could never find a more favourable conjuncture to $$e for a divorce than the pre&s;ent; when the emperor's power was become formidable to all the princes in Chri&s;tendom, and the pope's deliverance de|pended in a peculiar manner upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and interpo&s;ition of England and her allies: perhaps too his conduct was influenced by the beauty of Anne Boleyn, who now began to be di&s;tingui&s;hed above all her cotemporaries.</P>

<P>Be that as it may, he him&s;elf profe&s;&s;ed &s;cruples of con&s;cience $word$ de|$$$ed, that archbi&s;hop Warham, who had at fir&s;t declared again&s;t the marriage, &s;hould con&s;ult the bi&s;hops of England upon the &s;ubject. The prelate com|plied with his reque&s;t; and pre&s;ented him with a writing, in which they con|demned the marriage as a contract contrary to public decency, and the divine law. This declaration was &s;ub&s;cribed by all the prelates, except Fi&s;her bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, who&s;e name is &s;aid to have been counterfeited by cardinal Wol|$ey. The writings of Luther had by this time produced &s;uch a &s;pirit of in|quiry in England, that the people openly affirmed, the di&s;pen&s;ation for the marriage granted by pope Julius II. could never ju&s;tify, or con&s;olidate a mar|riage &s;o notoriou&s;ly oppo&s;ite to the law of God. This would have been a very &s;ufficient rea&s;on for di&s;&s;olving the match in the eye of equity; but, it would have been a very imprudent &s;tep in Henry, to &s;ollicit a favour of the court of Rome, by &s;eeking to invalidate the authority of a Roman pontiff: he therefore endeavoured to find nullities in the bull of Julius, by which it would be ren|dered revocable by the maxims of the holy &s;ee. The bull had been founded on the reque&s;t of Henry and Catherine, on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that their marriage
<PB N="585" REF="5970">
was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve peace between Spain and England. Now Henry, being then but twelve years of age, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;uch politic views; whence it was inferred, that he was not really author of the reque&s;t. Be&s;ides, the &s;ituation of affairs at that time was &s;uch, as proved the marriage was unnece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the peace between England and Spain; con&s;equently, pope Julius had been deceived: and la&s;tly, it was &s;ollicited as the means of maintaining the good under&s;tanding between Ferdinand and I&s;abella, and Henry VII. whereas, at the con&s;ummation, I&s;abella and Henry VII$ were not alive. It was moreover, alledged, that Henry VIII. in having prote&s;ted again&s;t his marriage before it was con&s;ummated, gave up the liberty granted to him by the bull; and therefore another was nece&s;&s;ary to render his marriage valid. The king having found the&s;e &s;ubterfuges to &s;erve as a pretext for Clement, to revoke the di&s;pen&s;ation of his predece&s;&s;or, &s;ent Knight his &s;ecretary to Rome, with four papers to be &s;igned by his holine&s;s. The fir&s;t was a commi&s;&s;ion to cardinal Wol&s;ey, to judge and determine the affair, in conjunction with &s;ome Engli&s;h bi&s;hops. The &s;econd was a decretal bull, annulling the marriage be|tween the king and Catherine, as the nuptials of that prince&s;s with his brother Arthur had been previou&s;ly con&s;ummated. The third contained a di&s;pen&s;ation for Henry's marrying another wife. And in the fourth, the pope engaged never to revoke the other three. Knight, at his arrival in Rome, being denied admit|tance to the pope, who was &s;trictly guarded by a Spani&s;h captain, found means to convey a memorial, containing the heads of his commi&s;&s;ion, to his holine&s;s, who returned a favourable an&s;wer, though the emperor had already de&s;ired he would take no &s;tep in that affair without fir&s;t imparting it to his mini&s;ters. Car|dinal Wol&s;ey, in a letter to Gregorio Ca&s;ali the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Rome, or|dered him to &s;econd the endeavours of Knight; and they waited on Clement after his retreat to Orvietto. He promi&s;ed to exert him&s;elf for the &s;atiasfac|tion of the king; but, begged the affair might not be precipitated. He was at this juncture uncertain, whether he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> Henry, or be able to effect an accommodation with the emperor. He there|fore wanted to gain time, but was &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h envoy, to de|clare him&s;elf, that he promi&s;ed to &s;ign the acts, on condition that they &s;hould not be produced until after the departure of the French and Germans from Italy. Though this condition was accepted, he &s;till protracted the affair, on pretence of con&s;ulting Lorenzo Pucci, cardinal Sanctorum quatuor, who being &s;ecured by a large&s;s of Engli&s;h gold, altered the legate's commi&s;&s;ion, which had been defective; and joined Knight and Ca&s;ali, in pre&s;&s;ing Clement to &s;ign it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Herbert.</NOTE> without further delay. Thus importuned, he put his hand to the commi&s;&s;ion, and the bull of di&s;pen&s;ation for the king, promi&s;ing to &s;end the other decretal bull for di&s;&s;olving the marriage to England, after he &s;hould have con&s;idered the &s;ubject more maturely. But he dated tho&s;e two acts at the time when he was pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo; &s;o that Henry did not choo&s;e to make u&s;e of them, left it &s;hould be objected, that the pope had granted them merely with a view to obtain his liberty by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England. Clement had by this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1528.</NOTE> time &s;marted &s;o &s;everely by his oppo&s;ition to the emperor, that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to reingage in the league with France, England, and Venice. When pre&s;&s;ed on this &s;ubject by the amba&s;&s;adors of tho&s;e powers, he ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="586" REF="5980">
his junction with the league might expo&s;e him to new misfortunes, without procuring any real advantage to their cau&s;e; and that he was re&s;olved to act as a mediator, rather than involve him&s;elf as a party. He had by this time formed the de&s;ign of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the family of Medicis in Florence; and fore&s;aw that &s;uch a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment could not be effected but by means of the empe|ror, becau&s;e the Florentines had joined the allies: but, he would not declare for Charles until he &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;s of the war between him and the con|federates. Every thing now &s;eemed to portend the effu&s;ion of blood, ruin, and de&s;olation.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>The amba&s;&s;adors of France and England, re&s;iding in Spain, de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to retire; and next day Clarencieux and Guien$e, the heralds of Henry and Francis, pronounced a declaration of war, in pre&s;ence of the em|peror, fitting on his throne, and &s;urrounded by his grandees. In an&s;wer to Clarencieux, Charles complained, that the king of England wanted to join him in marriage with a prince&s;s whom he intended to ba&s;tardize, by obtaining a divorce from her mother: but, he laid the whole blame on the exce&s;&s;ive am|bition of cardinal Wol&s;ey, who was di&s;gu&s;ted at the emperor, becau&s;e he would not embroil Chri&s;tendom by endeavouring to rai&s;e him to the papacy. He denied that he had ever refu&s;ed to pay the debt he owed to Henry; but &s;aid, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors who demanded the money, had no power to grant a di&s;charge. With re&s;pect to the imdemnity, he ob&s;erved, that the king of France had taken it upon him&s;elf in the treaty of Madrid. With regard to the &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and crowns, which he had obliged him&s;elf to pay, in ca&s;e $e &s;hould refu&s;e to wed the prince&s;s Mary, he declared, that $e had demanded her by amba&s;&s;adors; and that her father had not only refu&s;ed to &s;end her into Spain, but had even offered her in marriage to the king of Scotland: be&s;ides, Henry could not legally demand the &s;um, until after having proved, that he had exe|cuted all the articles of the treaty of Wind&s;or.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>In his an&s;wer to the French herald, he loudly taxed Francis with breach of promi&s;e, and de&s;ired Guienne to remind his ma&s;ter of what he had pro|po&s;ed by the archbi&s;hop of Bourdeaux, namely, That they &s;hould decide their quarrel in &s;ingle combat. The French king no &s;ooner received this me&s;&s;age than he &s;ent back the &s;ame herald to the emperor, with a formal defiance, in which he gave Charles the lie; and demanded of him &s;ecurity of the field in which they &s;hould fight body to body. The emperor accepted the challenge, and di&s;patched one of his herald with another remon&s;trance on the &s;ubject. He found great difficulty in being admitted to the king's pre&s;ence; and when he began to &s;peak, was interrupted by Francis, who being afraid of hearing &s;ome di&s;agreeable repartee, a&s;ked, if he had brought &s;ecurity for the field, as every thing el&s;e was &s;uperfluous? He was an&s;wered in the affirmative; and de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to read the emperor's cartel. This, however, he could not obtain. Francis ro&s;e ha&s;tily, after having uttered &s;ome angry expre&s;&s;ions; and ordered the herald to quit his dominions. In this whole affair he acted a part unbecoming a man of honour: fir&s;t, in renouncing the treaty to which he owed his deliverance: &s;econdly, in tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing the bounds of decorum, by &s;end|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">$andoval Herbert.</NOTE> &s;uch a &s;currilous me&s;&s;age to Charles: and, thirdly, in his behaviour to the herald, which denoted equal in&s;olence and trepidation.

<P>Hugh de Mendoza the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at London, being informed of the&s;e tran&s;actions, would have retired immediately; but, Wol&s;ey a&s;&s;uring him, that the herald had exceeded his orders$ and would be &s;everely puni&s;hed at his return, he &s;ent a courier to inform the emperor of this declaration. Clarencieux, who was &s;till in Spain, being apprized of this circum&s;tance, de|manded, and obtained an authentic copy of the amba&s;&s;ador's letter; and arriv|ing privately in England, went directly to the king, to whom he produced this te&s;timony, together with three other letters, written in his own hand, by which Clarencieux had been peremptorily ordered to denounce war again&s;t the em|peror. Henry was &s;o exa&s;perated at this information, that in the tran&s;port of his anger, he chid the cardinal for his pre&s;umption in the mo&s;t acrimonio$$ ex|pre&s;&s;ions; and, in all probability, would have di&s;graced him intirely, had not he fore&s;een, that he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for his mini&s;try in the affair of the divorce. The matter, however, was examined in council; and though Wol&s;ey pleaded, that he imagined what he had done was conformable to the king's intentions, he received a &s;evere and mortifying rebuke. The report which Cla|rencieux made of the honourable treatment he had met with at the court of the emperor, made an impre&s;&s;ion upon Henry. He &s;eemed loth to break with a prince who treated him with &s;uch per&s;onal re&s;pect; and the trade between England and the Low Countries being of great con&s;equence to the nation, &s;ome overtures were made for keeping it &s;till open. Mean while, the merchants, in con&s;equence of the declaration of war, refu&s;ed to buy the cloth that was brought to market at Blackwell-Hall; and the manufacturers mutinied in di|vers parts of England. The &s;ame commotions happening in Flanders, Mar|garet, gouvernante of the Low Countries, with the advice of the emperor's council, &s;ent over two amba&s;&s;adors to &s;ollicit a truce, which they obtained for eight months, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of the French amba&s;&s;$dor, and the in&s;inuations of the cardinal, who&s;e credit about this time began to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hall.

<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the Imperiali&s;ts in Italy rai&s;ed fre&s;h ob&s;tacles to Hen|ry's divorce from Catherine. The pope, when &s;ollicited to i&s;&s;ue new bulls on that &s;ubject, that &s;hould be more explicit than tho&s;e he had &s;igned at Orvietto, advi&s;ed the king of England privately, to make u&s;e of the commi&s;&s;ion which he had already granted to the legate for annulling the marriage, and e&s;pou&s;e another wife, according to his own inclination, in which ca&s;e he would confirm the marriage; alledging, that it would be ea&s;ier for him to grant a confirmation of what was already done, than a di&s;pen&s;ation to do that which was undone. Henry looked upon this advice as a &s;ubterfuge for &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e. He fore&s;aw, that if he &s;hould take another wife in this manner, he would be altogether in the power of his holine&s;s, who might confirm or annul the marriage at plea&s;ure; and therefore he re&s;olved to per$i$t in demanding new bulls for terminating the affair of the divorce. Wol&s;ey's &s;ecretary, Stephen Gardiner, and Edward Fox, were &s;ent to Rome to demand a new commi&s;&s;ion, impowering the cardi|nal to di$$olve the marriage, and yet declare the daughter born of that marriage legitimate, as well as a decretal bull to di&s;&s;olve the king's marriage; and a di&s;|pen&s;ation for his wedding another wife, without any re&s;triction. At the &s;ame time, the envoys were ordered to make the pope acquainted with the extraordi|nary merit of Anne Boleyn, on whom the king had by this time &s;ettled his af|fection; and to tell his holine&s;s, that the cardinal had no &s;hare in advi&s;ing the divorce. Gardiner and Fox arriving at Orvietto, when Lautrec was on his march towards Naples, the pope wanted to protract the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this affair until he &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign; and for this purpo&s;e, endeavoured to amu&s;e Henry with a letter written in cypher, which nobody could explain. This expedient w$$ very ill received by the king, who &s;ent orders to his envoys to in&s;i&s;t upon the former demands; and as by this time the French general had made conque&s;ts in the kingdom of Naples, Clement, afraid of di&s;obliging Hen|ry, who was &s;o clo&s;ely connected with Francis, &s;igned a bull, con&s;tituting car|dinal Wol&s;ey judge of the affair, in conjunction with the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, or any other Engli&s;h prelate. The king's council con&s;idered this com|mi&s;&s;ion as defective, becau&s;e it contained no clau&s;e to prevent the pope from rever|$ing the decr$e; and implied a manife&s;t nullity, in appointing as &s;ole judge of the affair, a cardinal devoted to the king, and actually his prime mini&s;ter. Henry therefore demanded, that another legate &s;hould be joined to Wol&s;ey; and that the pope &s;hould, by a formal engagement, renounce all power of revoking the commi&s;&s;ion. As Lautrec had now undertaken the &s;iege of Naples, Clement made no &s;cruple to comply with the&s;e demands. He appointed Wol&s;ey and Campejus his l$gates a latere, e&s;tabli&s;hing them as his vicegerents in the affair of the divorce; and for that purpo&s;e ve&s;ting them with his whole authority. He likewi&s;e granted the formal engagement touching the revocation; and furni&s;h|ed Campejus with a decretal, annulling the king's marriage. The&s;e conce&s;|&s;ions were made at different periods, in order to protract the time; and before the decretal pa&s;&s;ed, Clement, in all probability, had re&s;olved to thwart Henry in the affair of his divorce; for, by this time, Lautrec was dead, and the French army ruined: &s;o that the pope had nothing to fear from the confederates. He had re&s;olved to accommodate all differences with the emperor, whom he therefore would not di&s;oblige by being acce&s;&s;ory to the di&s;grace of his kin&s;woman Ca|therine:
<PB N="589" REF="6010">
but, on the other hand, until this accommodation could be effected, he was aver&s;e to a rupture with Henry, le$t he &s;hould be le&s;t at the mercy of the emperor; and obliged to embrace &s;uch terms as he &s;hould think proper to im|po&s;e. His aim then was to temporize and &s;pin out the affair o$ the divorce, until he &s;hould have compromi&s;ed all his di&s;putes with Charles, from whom he had rea&s;on to expect favourable terms, while he maintained a &s;eeming con|nexion with France and England. He directed his legate Campejus to pro|tract the affair as long as po&s;&s;ible: to forbear giving &s;entence of divorce, until he &s;hould receive new orders under the hand of his holine&s;s: and to avoid com|municating the bull to any per&s;on what&s;oever, except the king and the car|dinal.</P>

<P>Campejus arriving in England, began his legation, by exhorting the king to live in good under&s;tanding with Catherine; and de&s;i&s;t from his &s;ollicitation of the divorce. This advice being very ill received, he endeavoured to per&s;uade the queen to con&s;ent to the &s;eparation; but, his coun&s;el was rejected by Catherine, who told him &s;he was the king's lawful wife, and &s;o would con|tinue, until &s;he &s;hould be declared otherwi&s;e by the pope's &s;entence. Then the legate declared, he could proceed no farther without new orders; and &s;ix months elap&s;ed before the&s;e could be obtained. In the mean time, he flattered the king with the hope of &s;eeing his de&s;ire accompli&s;hed, and amu&s;ed him and Wol&s;ey with a &s;ight of the bull; but when he was pre&s;&s;ed to produce it before &s;ome lords of the council, he pleaded the pope's order to the contrary. Henry, incen&s;ed at this method of proceeding, complained to Clement, who ju&s;tified<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE> the conduct of the legate; and gave the court to under&s;tand, that the bull &s;hould not be publi&s;hed, except the &s;entence of the legates &s;hould be favoura|ble to his maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>While the pope thus trifled with Henry, his negotiation with the em|peror was &s;till continued; and now he &s;ought a pretence for breaking with the kings of France and England, who were no longer formidable in Italy. They had promi&s;ed to procure for him the re&s;titution of Ravenna and Cervia, and now he loudly complained, that they had not performed their engagements. At length, they received intimation of his treating with the emperor; and upbraided him in their turn with double-dealing. He &s;till denied he had any intention to depart from his neutrality; and &s;ent Franci&s;co Campana to Eng|land, with a&s;&s;urances of his good intention. This envoy carried an order to Campejus, to burn the decretal bull, and protract the divorce to the utmo&s;t of his power. He accordingly found new pretences for delaying the proceedings, until at length Henry, impatient of &s;uch procra&s;tination, &s;ent Sir Francis Bryan, and Peter Vannes to Rome, to dive into the real cau&s;e of this delay. They were directed to &s;earch the pope's chancery for a pretended brief, which as the Spaniards gave out, confirmed the di&s;pen&s;ation for Catherine's marriage, granted by pope Julius; to propo&s;e divers expedients for facilitating the determination of the divorce; to offer a guard of two thou&s;and men to the pope, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be intimidated by the threats of the emperor; or &s;hould this propo&s;al be rejected to counterballance the threats of Charles with menaces from Henry. The two envoys executed the fir&s;t part of their commi&s;&s;ion; and finding the pope inclining to the intere&s;t of the emperor, told him plainly, that &s;hould he refu&s;e granting the &s;atisfaction their ma&s;ter demanded, England would certainly
<PB N="590" REF="6020">
renouce him and all the popes his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. They ob&s;erved, that the Eng|li&s;h people wanted nothing but their king's permi&s;&s;ion to &s;hake off all obedi|ence to the papal power; that he was on the brink of rai&s;ing two formidable enemies to him&s;elf, in the per&s;ons of Francis and Henry; and that as the king of England had engaged in the war, merely with a view to deliver his holine&s;s from impri&s;onment, all Chri&s;tendom would look with horror upon his ingrati|tude, &s;hould be engage in a league again&s;t his deliverer. The&s;e remon&s;trances produced $o effect upon the pope, who an&s;wered in general terms; and pre|tended to think him&s;elf in a very dangerous &s;ituation, from which he could be relieved by nothing but the &s;ignal interpo&s;ition of heaven. The que&s;tions pro|po&s;ed by the envoys, to able canoni&s;ts, were the&s;e, Whether, if the queen &s;hould take the veil, the king might be at liberty to take another wife? Whether, if the king and queen &s;hould take the vows together, the pope would grant him a di&s;pen&s;ation to marry again during the life of Catherine? and, Whether the pope could grant him permi&s;&s;ion to have two wives? The an&s;wers to the&s;e que&s;tions never tran&s;pired. But, the pope's chancery being &s;earched, no brief appeared;<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$$be$t. Bu$$et. Act.

<P>Although the pope had laid down a re&s;olution to thwart the king, he &s;till continued to heap favours on his mini&s;ter. He obtained &s;everal bulls for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing divers &s;mall mona&s;teries, and many other grants towards the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his two colleges, which he had very much at heart; and indeed, he could not be too alert in &s;eizing the pre&s;ent opportunity, which, if he had neglected, the work in all probability would have remained imperfect. With re&s;pect to Scotland, Henry in the cour&s;e of this year &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the court of his nephew James, with propo&s;als of peace; but, as this could not be effected, on account of the di&s;tractions of that kingdom, which was divided into t$$ $$ct$ons, h$$d$d by the q$$en dowager, and the family of Doug$$s, a $$$ce was concluded at Berwick, for five years. In a &s;eparate article i$ was $tip$l$t$d, that the earl of Angus, his brother George, and uncle Archi|bald, might be received and protected in England, on condition that they &s;hould deliver up to their &s;overeign the places they held in Scotland; and that, in ca&s;e they &s;hould make inroads into their own country, the king of England &s;hould $$p$ir the $word$ as if it had been done by his own &s;ubjects.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

In the beginning of the year, Clemens had been &s;ei$ed with a dangerous m$l$dy$ of which cardinal Wol&s;ey was no &s;$$ner apprized, than he began to cabal for the $apa$$. Henry had written to &s;everal cardinals in his favour; and Francis $word$ $word$ that he &s;hould be &s;upported by all tho&s;e of the French faction.

In the mean time, he continued to amu&s;e the king of England with promi&s;es, that the affair of the divorce &s;hould be determined according to his wi&s;h; and delivered into Gardiner's hands a brief, in which he declared he would not revoke the power he had granted to the legates. In tok$n of his re&s;pect for Henry, when that prince, on the death of Richard Fox, de&s;ired he would confer the bi&s;hopric of Winche&s;ter upon Wo$&s;ey, he immediately ordered the bulls to be expedited for that purpo&s;e, though he taxed them at fifteen thou&s;and ducats; the cardinal, however, would not pay above &s;ix thou&s;and, owning that he was indifferent about the &s;$e, as he already en|joyed the temporalities by the king's favour.</P>

<P>The emperor being well a&s;&s;ured of the pope's &s;entiments touching the divorce, entered in the name of his aunt queen Catherine a formal prote&s;t again&s;t all that &s;hould be done in England on that &s;ubject by the lega$$s, one of whom be alledged was entirely devoted to Henry, and the other bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury in his dominions. The Engli&s;h mini&s;ters endeavoured to per&s;uade the pope, that this prote&s;t ought to be rejected. B$t he told them, he could not refu&s;e to a queen, what the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable &s;ubject had a right to de|mand, ob&s;erving, that a prote&s;t did not at all detract from the merits of any cau&s;e. From this and other concurring circum&s;tances they concluded, that his &s;ol$ aim was to dupe their ma&s;ter, to whom they imparted their &s;entiments, hinting, that unle&s;s the affair could be &s;peedily decided, the pope would in all probability evoke the cau&s;e to Rome. Henry, alarmed at this intelligence, re&s;olved to &s;ue the divorce before the legates without further delay; but, upon peru&s;ing the brief, in which Clement had engaged that the power of the l$ga$es &s;hould not be revoked, it was found conceived in &s;uch ambiguous terms as le$t no room to doubt the pope's in&s;incerity. That the king might be more fully convinced, however, Gardiner was directed to tell him, that the brief had been wetted in its carriage to England, &s;o as that the writing was almo&s;t $ff$ced; for which rea&s;on he $was de&s;$red to &s;ign another, which would have been more explicit: but Clement found means to elude all his follicitations, and &s;ecretly rejoiced at the &s;uppo&s;ed accident.</P>

<P>Henry having nothing further to hope from the court of Rom$, $$|called his amba&s;&s;adors, and in their room $$$t thither Bennet, who carried a letter to his holine&s;s from the two legates, who ob&s;erved, that the chief point of the cau&s;e was to decide upon the authority ve$$$d in the head of the church; and as this was an object far above their power and capacity, they advi&s;ed advi&s;ed holine&s;s to evoke the cau&s;e before his own tribu$$$$ not $word$ but th$$ the king would con&s;ent to this evocation, provided he might be previou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured that the cau&s;e would be decided in his $$$our.

<PB N="592" REF="6040">
the month. Henry, when called upon, an&s;wered, Here; but, the queen being cited, aro&s;e, and falling on her knees before Henry, <Q>&startq;I am (&s;aid &s;he) a poor woman, and &s;tranger in your dominions, where I can neither expect di&s;in|tere&s;ted coun&s;el, nor $mpartial judges. I have been your wife twenty years and upwards, have bore you &s;everal children, and ever &s;tudied to plea&s;e you. I prote&s;t you found me a true maid, concerning which I appeal to your own con&s;cience. If I have done ami&s;s, let me be put away with &s;hame. Our parents were e&s;teemed wife princes, and no doubt had good coun&s;ellors, when they agreed upon our marriage. I therefore will not &s;ubmit to the court. My lawyers are your &s;ubjects, and dare not &s;peak freely in my be|half; for which rea&s;on, I de&s;ire to be excu&s;ed until I &s;hall hear from Spain.&endq;</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he ro&s;e, and making a low reverence to the king, retired from court, paying no regard to the crier, who required her to &s;tay. After her departure Henry declared, that &s;he had been always a true and obedient wife, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many excellent qualities; but, that his con&s;cience being di&s;quieted by a remark which had been made by the bi&s;hop of Tarbe the French amba&s;|&s;ador, he had re&s;olved to try the law$ulne&s;s of his marriage, for the ea&s;e of his mind, and the benefit of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He &s;aid he had mentioned this &s;cru|ple in confe&s;&s;ion to the bi&s;hop of Lincoln; and de&s;ired the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury to procure the opinions of all the prelates, who had under their hands and $eals di&s;approved of the marriage. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter declaring, that he had not $et his hand to this writing, the metropolitan of Canterbury &s;aid, he had con&s;ented to let another write his name; but this circum&s;tance he of Roche&s;ter po&s;itively denied. The queen being again cited to appear, appeal|ed to the pope, and was declared contumacious. Then the legates drew up twelve articles to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the examination of evidence. They declared, that prince Arthur and the king were brothers: that prince Arthur had mar|ried Catherine, and con&s;ummated the marriage: that upon the death of Ar|thur, Henry by virtue of a di&s;pen&s;ation had married the widow: that this mar|riage with his brother's wife, was forbidden both by human and divine law: and, that upon the complaints which the pope had received, his holine&s;s had &s;ent them to try and decide in the affair. The king's council in&s;i&s;ted chiefly on the con&s;um|mation of Arthur's marriage; and in the cour&s;e of their pleadings &s;poke &s;o in|decently, that the bi&s;hop o$ Roche&s;ter &s;ignified his di&s;approbation and di&s;gu&s;t. He was checked by Wol&s;ey for pre&s;uming to interpo&s;e; and &s;ome &s;evere alter|cation pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e prelates. The evidence, however, produced many &s;trong pre&s;umptions, that Arthur had carnally known the queen, though &s;he her&s;elf declared, and even &s;wore the contrary.</P>

<P>While the legates proceeded very &s;lowly in this proce&s;s, the em|peror's mini&s;ters pre&s;&s;ed the pope to evoke the cau&s;e to Rome; and the Eng|li&s;h envoys exerted all their influence to prevent this evocation. Both &s;ides threatened to depo&s;e him on account of his ba&s;tardy, and he pretended to be intimidated by their menaces, which however furni&s;hed him with a rea&s;on for po&s;tponing his declaration, until he had concluded his treaty with the empe|ror. Then he plainly told the Engli&s;h agents, that he had re&s;olved to evoke the cau&s;e of the divorce to Rome; and though they a&s;&s;ured him that &s;uch a &s;tep would certainly di&s;member the holy &s;ee of the &s;piritual dominion of England, he refu&s;ed to retract his re&s;olution. The emperor had engaged by
<PB N="593" REF="6050">
treaty to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the hou&s;e of Medicis in the &s;overeignty of Florence; and this circum&s;tance alone over-balanced every other con&s;ideration in the mind of Clement. On the fifteenth day of July he &s;igned the bull of evocation, which he forthwith di&s;patched by a courier to England, where the proce&s;s of divorce had been &s;trangely protracted by the artifice of cardinal Campejus, who found means to adjourn the &s;e&s;&s;ion from time to time, under various pre|tences. How incen&s;ed &s;oever the king mu&s;t have been at the arrival of this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE> bull of evocation, in which he was cited to appear to Rome in forty days, on pain of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure, he di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment; and though he would not allow the bull to be intimated to him in form, he gave the legates to under&s;tand that they were at liberty to obey the pope's order. Clement afterwards, by way of reparation, revoked the cen&s;ures by a new brief, and prolonged the term of the citation till Chri&s;tmas.</P>

<P>All tho&s;e who were acquainted with Henry's di&s;po&s;ition, dated the di&s;grace of the cardinal from this aera; and indeed he had, through the whole of this proce&s;s, behaved with &s;uch languor and indifference as cannot ea&s;ily be explained, when we con&s;ider how much it imported him to gratify his ma&s;ter in this intere&s;ting affair. Perhaps he was unwilling to incen&s;e the emperor beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of reconciliation, in ca&s;e the affairs of Europe &s;hould take a new turn: perhaps he &s;ecretly hated Anne Boleyn, as a dangerous rival in the king's favour, or a pro&s;elyte to the doctrine of Luther; or he was actuated by &s;ome ob&s;cure motive of per&s;onal di&s;like. Great men are often influenced by low pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices, which they are a&s;hamed to avow. Certain it is, the emperor left no &s;tone unturned to ruin the cardinal in the king's opinion; he was at pains to circulate reports invented for the pur|po&s;e of his de&s;truction; and, by means of his emi&s;&s;aries, Henry received copies of letters, di&s;approving the divorce, which the cardinal was &s;aid to have pri|vately written to his holine&s;s. On the other hand, Anne Boleyn imputed the mi&s;carriage of the divorce to the backwardne&s;s with which Wol&s;ey had acted in the affair; and her re&s;entment was proportioned to the greatne&s;s of her di&s;|appointment. Her father, now created lord vi&s;count Rochfort, had removed her from court during the proce&s;s, in order to avoid &s;candal; but when the commi&s;&s;ion was vacated, &s;he returned, at the king's de&s;ire. After all this pro|vocation, Henry kept his temper with &s;urprizing equanimity; and, when the two cardinals waited upon him at Grafton, received them with his u&s;ual com|placency. Wol&s;ey was clo&s;eted for a con&s;iderable time, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with &s;eeming kindne&s;s; and all the courtiers, who hated him in their hearts, &s;till behaved towards him with the u&s;ual re&s;pect and appearance of veneration.</P>

<P>Henry, in order to amu&s;e his impatience, and divert his chagrin, made a progre&s;s through &s;ome counties; and, in his return, lay at Waltham Cro&s;s, in the hou&s;e of Mr. Cre&s;&s;ey. This gentleman had committed the education of his two &s;ons to Thomas Cranmer, a doctor in theology, who had been pro|fe&s;&s;or at Oxford, and lo&s;t his office on account of his being married. He was eminent for his learning, piety, and moderation; and &s;ecretly favoured the doctrine of Luther, who&s;e books he had read in Germany. At &s;upper he was de&s;ired by Fox and Gardiner to give his &s;entiments of the divorce; and, being pre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject, he propo&s;ed that the king &s;hould procure the opinions of all the univer&s;ities, theologi&s;ts$ and civilians of Chri&s;tendom; who would
<PB N="594" REF="6060">
either judge the di&s;pen&s;ation of pope Julius II. valid, or in&s;ufficient: if valid, the king's con&s;cience would be at ea&s;e; if in&s;ufficient, the pope could never venture to declare him&s;elf again&s;t the opinion of all the able men in Chri&s;ten|dom. When this propo&s;al was communicated to the king, he te&s;tified his &s;atisfaction, by exclaiming, "Aye, now we have the right &s;ow by the car." He de&s;ired to hear it from Cranmer's own mouth, and was &s;o plea&s;ed with his conver&s;ation, that he commanded him to follow the court, and ever after con|&s;ulted him in all emergencies. On the king's return from this progre&s;s he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the cardinal, demanding the great &s;eal, which he at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to deliver; but, Henry writing to him next day, he gave it to the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, and it was offered to Warham, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, who had formerly been chancellor; but, he declining the offer, on ac|count of his great age, it was given to Sir Thomas More, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf for his learning and integrity.</P>

<P>Campejus, not a little alarmed at this prelude to Wol$ey's fal$, took leave of the king, in order to return to Italy; and Henry expre&s;&s;ed no di&s;plea&s;ure at parting with that prelate. Before he embarked in per&s;on, the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers rummaged all his baggage, on pretence of &s;earching for contraband goods; though it is &s;uppo&s;ed they acted by the expre&s;s directions of the king, who wanted to &s;eize the decretal bull, not knowing that it was already committed to the flames. When the cardinal complained of this in&s;ult, as an outrage committed again&s;t a legate of the holy &s;ee, Henry told him, That the officers had done their duty: That he was &s;ur|prized at his a&s;&s;uming the character of legate, after his power and commi&s;&s;ion had been revoked; and &s;till more &s;urprized, that, being bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, he &s;hould be &s;o ignorant of the laws of the land, as to a&s;&s;ume that quality without the king's permi&s;&s;ion.

<P>On the ninth day of October, Hales, the attorney-general, pre|&s;ented an information in the King's Bench again&s;t the cardinal, accu&s;ing him of having violated the &s;tatute of Premunire. He confe&s;&s;ed the indictment, pleaded ignorance of the &s;tatute, and &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the king's mercy. He was declared out of the king's protection, his goods and chattels were for|feited to the king; and his palace of York-hou&s;e, afterwards known by the name of Whitehall, was &s;eized for his maje&s;ty's u&s;e; together with all the rich furniture and wealth he had ama&s;&s;ed. Humbled by this rever&s;e of fortune, he petitioned the king for a protection for his per&s;on, which he immediately ob|tained, with a free pardon. He was re&s;tored to the enjoyment of the arch|bi&s;hopric of York and &s;ee of Winche&s;ter: he retrieved of his own effects to the amount of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds in furniture, money, and plate; and re|ceived divers kind me&s;&s;ages from the king and Anne Bol$yn: &s;o that Henry's aim, at this juncture, was to humble the pride, but not ruin the for|tune, of his old favourite. The&s;e favourable &s;entiments, however, were not of long duration: his enemies now prevailed at court, and brought into the hou&s;e of lords an impeachment of high trea&s;on, in four and forty articles; importing, That he had abu&s;ed his legatine power, acted tyrannically in the office of chan|cellor, expedited divers orders of the utmo&s;t importance, and executed treaties without the king's knowledge and concurrence; behaved de&s;potically on

many occa&s;ions, more like an ea&s;tern &s;overeign than an Engli&s;h mini&s;ter; practi&s;ed extortion, bribery, and all manner of corruption; &s;ought to equal, and even to prefer him&s;elf, to his maje&s;ty, by writing in orders and in&s;truc|tions, Ego et rex meus, I and my king; and endangering his &s;overeign's health by breathing upon him, and whi&s;pering in his ear, when he knew him&s;elf deeply infected with the venereal di&s;temper. The&s;e articles pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of lords, which was filled with his enemies; but, when the bill was carried down to the commons, Thomas Cromwell, a member of that hou&s;e, who had been the cardinal's dome&s;tic, defended him with &s;uch &s;trength of argument, that no act of trea&s;on could be proved again&s;t him; and the pro&s;ecution was dropped. The cardinal manife&s;ted very little fortitude under his misfortune: he became abject and di&s;con&s;olate; and, at length, &s;ickened in con&s;equence of &s;uch re|peated mortifications. The king's tenderne&s;s &s;eemed to revive when he heard of Wol&s;ey's di&s;temper; he had formerly &s;ent him a turquoi&s;e ring, as a te&s;|timony of his protection, which the cardinal received upon the road to Win|che&s;ter. He was &s;o affected with this in&s;tance of the king's goodne&s;s, that he alighted from his hor&s;e, and fell upon his knees in a tran&s;port of joy. Henry now &s;ent him another pre&s;ent of a ruby, by his phy&s;ician doctor Butts, who a&s;|&s;ured him his highne&s;s was not angry with him in his heart; and that he &s;hould, in a little time, be convinced of his affection. This kind me&s;&s;age contributed in a great mea&s;ure to the recovery of the cardinal, who &s;upplicated and obtained<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holling$hed.

<P>While the attention of the Engli&s;h court was engro&s;&s;ed by the affair of the divorce, and the di&s;grace of Wol&s;ey, Francis, &s;eeing no other pro&s;pect of retrieving his ho&s;tages from the hands of the emperor, re&s;olved to effect an accommodation with that power, and &s;et on foot a private negotiation for this purpo&s;e; while he amu&s;ed the Venetians, the Florentines, and the duke of Fer|rara, with the promi&s;e of marching into Italy at the head of a powerful army. Perhaps he would not have found Charles &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed for peace, had not he been influenced by the preparations of the Turks for invading Hungary and Au&s;tria, and the commotions of the prote&s;tants in Germany. Thus threatened, he affected great moderation. The articles being privately di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the emperor's aunt Margaret, gouvernante of the Low Countries, and Loui&s;a of Savoy, mother to the French king, repaired to Cambray, where they &s;igned the treaty of peace; importing, That the emperor &s;hould, for the pre&s;ent, wave his demand of Burgundy: That the king of France &s;hould pay two mil|lions of golden crowns for the ran&s;om of his children; withdraw his troops from Italy; cede to Charles the &s;overeignty of Flanders and Artois; re&s;tore the county of A&s;ti, with all that he &s;till maintained in the dutchy of Milan; renounce all preten&s;ions to the kingdom of Naples; e&s;pou&s;e queen E$eanor, the emperor's &s;i&s;ter; and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the heirs of the late duke of Bourbon in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the e&s;tate of that family which had been confi&s;cated. The king of England, being privy to this negotiation, was &s;atisfied with a &s;ingle article, by which Francis engaged to pay five hundred thou&s;and crowns, which the emperor owed to Henry; and to relieve a jewel, which Philip, the empe|ror's father, had pledged to Henry VII. for the &s;um of fifty thou&s;and crowns. Henry behaved with great genero&s;ity on this occa&s;ion; for he not only freely

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ C$. 1530.</NOTE> The emperor, having agreed to the principal articles of the peace, took &s;hipping at Barcelona, with nine thou&s;and men, and arrived at Genoa in Au|gu&s;t; when the peace of Cambray being publi&s;hed, the Venetians, the Floren|tines, the dukes of Milan and Ferrara, finding them&s;elves abandoned by France, were obliged to &s;ubmit to the emperor. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of their affairs was referred to a conference between Charles and the pope at Bologna, where all their different amba&s;&s;adors attended. There the emperor decreed that the Venetians &s;hould re&s;tore Ravenna and Cervia to the pope; and to him&s;elf &s;ome places which they &s;till occupied in the kingdom of Naples. Francis Sforza was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Milan, on condition of paying a large &s;um to the emperor. The di&s;pute between the pope and the duke of Ferrara was left to the arbitration of Charles; but that between his ho$ine&s;s and the Florentines could not be accommodated. They were determined to &s;pend their lives in defence of their liberty; which, neverthele&s;s, they offered to purcha&s;e with a &s;um of money, but the pope in&s;i&s;ted upon their receiving the hou&s;e of Medic$s as their &s;overeign; and, as they rejected this propo&s;al, the emperor ordered the prince of Orange to be&s;iege their city. Charles, having thus &s;et|tled his Italian concerns, returned to Germany, where the prote&s;tants called aloud for a general council, with the promi&s;e of which the emperor had flat|tered them during the war: but, at his conference with the pope, he had un|dertaken to reduce them, without gratifying this their de&s;ire. They had la$ely engaged in a league for their own defence; and this a&s;&s;ociation alarmed Charles to &s;uch a degree, that he ha&s;tened from Bologna, after having received the imperial crown from the hands of his holine&s;s. Mean while, the prince of Orange lo&s;t his life at the &s;iege of Florence, which capitulated on condition of being permitted to pre&s;erve its liberty, though the emperor was impowered to regu|late the form of the government. But, in a few days, the partizans of the hou&s;e of Medicis exciting a tumult in the city, the admini&s;tration reverted to pope Clement; the emperor e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;on-in-law, Alexander de Medicis, on the &s;ame footing which his ance&s;tors had gained, and rendered the &s;overeign power hereditary in his family.</P>

<P>The king of England &s;till laboured to procure the divorce, in the pro&s;ecution of which he had met with &s;uch difficulties. The queen had been for &s;ome time removed from court, where Anne Boleyn appeared in great &s;plen|dor, governing Henry by her nod, and receiving incen&s;e from the Engli&s;h no|bility. Cran$$er wrote a book in favour of the &s;ollicited divorce, and afterwards accompanied two amba&s;&s;adors to Bologna, where they had audience of the pope and the emperor. Clement expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of giving the king &s;atis|faction; but he dur$t not act without the con&s;ent of Charles, who declared he would never abandon the cau&s;e of his aunt queen Catherine. About the &s;ame time Henry &s;ent learned men to con&s;ult the foreign univer&s;ities; and tho&s;e of Paris, Angers, Bourges, Orleans, Tholou&s;e, Bologna, Ferrara, and Padua, unanimou&s;ly agreed that the di&s;pen&s;ation granted by pope Ju$ius II. being con|trary to the law of God, the marriage of Henry with Catherine could not be valid.

<P>Henry, finding his application to the pope ineffectual, prevailed upon his chief prelates and nobility to &s;end a &s;harp remon$$rance, by way of letter, to the pope; in which, after having mentioned the obligations his holi|ne&s;s owed to the king, the deci&s;ion of &s;o many learned univer&s;ities, and the little regard which had been payed to them at the court of Rome; they gave him to under&s;tand, that, &s;hould he refu&s;e to do ju&s;tice in the affair of the di|vorce, they would conclude them&s;elves abandoned by the &s;ee of Rome, and &s;eek for other remedies. To this letter, which was &s;igned by cardinal Wol&s;ey, the metropolitan of Canterbury, four bi&s;hops, two dukes, two marqui&s;&s;es, thirteen earls, two vi&s;counts, three and twenty barons, two and twenty abbots, and eleven commoners, the pope wrote an an&s;wer to ju&s;tify his conduct. His apology was &s;o far from being admitted, that Henry, in order to antici|pate any &s;tep that might be taken by Clement in favour of Catherine, or the cardinal, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons whatever to purcha&s;e any thing from Rome, or el&s;ewhere, that &s;hould be contrary to his royal pre|rogative; or to divulge any thing of that nature, on pain of incurring his in|dignation, and the penalties &s;pecified in the &s;tatute of Provi&s;ors and Premunire. Then he ordered &s;ome learned men in the kingdom to collect, compare, and publi&s;h, all that had been or could be alledged in favour of the divorce, in|cluding the opinions of the univer&s;ities, and a particular an&s;wer to a book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$rbert.

<P>Cardinal Wol&s;ey continued &s;till fluctuating between hope and de|&s;pair. He had, in the beginning of his di&s;grace, been reduced to great ne|ce&s;&s;ity, from which he was relieved by the bi&s;hop of Carli$le; but afterwards his affairs &s;eemed to take a more favourable turn; he received a full pardon, con&s;iderable appointments, and kind me&s;&s;ages from the king; and was per|mitted to &s;it among the peers in parliament: though he had the mortification to &s;ee a bill pa&s;s, confirming his own forfeitures to the king; and, among others, his college at Oxford, which Henry afterwards founded in his own name. The cardinal &s;eemed more afflicted at the fate of his college, than at any other circum&s;tance of his misfortune. He wrote to the king in the mo&s;t humble &s;train, begging the foundation might be permitted to &s;tand: he &s;ent a pathetic letter on the &s;ame &s;ubject to Cromwell, who had by this time in&s;i|nuated him&s;elf into the king's confidence; but no regard was paid to his impor|tunity. At length, Anne Boleyn, and the re&s;t of his enemies, thinking him too near the king, while he re&s;ided at Richmond, obtained an order for his removing to his archbi&s;hopric of York. He obeyed this command, though not without great reluctance; and retired by &s;low journeys to Cawood, attended by a re|tinue of one hundred and twenty hor&s;emen. Upon the road he di&s;tributed his alms and benediction with great liberality; and now, for the fir&s;t time in his life, began to be popular, the people crouding to &s;ee him, and a&s;k his ble&s;&s;ing, as he pa&s;&s;ed through the country. Not that he had intirely laid a&s;ide the thoughts of worldly grandeur; he intended to be in&s;talled, according to the antient cu&s;tom,

with great &s;olemnity; and began to make preparations for this ceremony, all acce&s;s to the choir of York being forbidden, until it &s;hould be performed.</P>

<P>While he was thus employed for the gratification of idle vanity, his adver&s;aries exerted them&s;elves &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly, that, before the day of in|itallation, he was vi&s;ited by the earl of Northumberland, warden of the Mar|ches, and Sir Walter Wel&s;h, a gentleman of the king's privy chamber, who arre&s;ted him for high trea&s;on, together with one Augu&s;tine his phy&s;ician, who was immediately conveyed to London in the mo&s;t ignominious manner. Wol|&s;ey betrayed marks of fear and di&s;order when the earl &s;ignified his errand; but, recovering his &s;pirits a little, prote&s;ted he would not yield until he &s;hould &s;ee his commi&s;&s;ion, which the other refu&s;ed to produce; yet, at &s;ight of Wel&s;h, he complied with the king's plea&s;ure, becau&s;e he knew his per&s;on and office. Having been indulged with &s;ome time to prepare for his journey, he &s;et out for London with an heavy heart; and, by the way, was delivered by Northumberland to the care of the earl of Shrew&s;bury, &s;teward of the hou&s;e|hold, who told him he was commanded to u&s;e him re&s;pectfully, as one whom the king highly favoured$ and a&s;&s;ured him, that though his highne&s;s found him&s;elf obliged to bring him upon his trial for the &s;atisfaction of &s;ome parti|cular per&s;ons, he did not entertain the lea&s;t doubt of his integrity. Such was the dejection of the cardinal, that his &s;pirits and re&s;olution failed him even after the&s;e a&s;&s;urances. He moved very &s;lowly, and &s;tayed a whole fortnight at Sheffield ca&s;tle, where he was &s;eized with a dy&s;entery. Here he was joined by Sir William King&s;ton, captain of the king's guard, and con&s;table of the Tower, who came, attended with four and twenty yeomen of the guard, who had been formerly the cardinal's &s;ervants. He &s;aluted him on the knee with a very gracious me&s;&s;age from the king, who de&s;ired he would make no more ha&s;te than &s;tood with his health and convenience. But whether Wol&s;ey was con&s;cious of having been engaged in &s;ome clande&s;tine tran&s;actions with the emperor and pope, which he feared would now be di&s;covered, or apprehended that his adver&s;aries were bent upon his de&s;truction, which they would be able to effect, he remained di&s;con&s;olate, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e encouraging ad|dre&s;&s;es, and his di&s;temper gained ground. Neverthele&s;s, he proceeded on his journey until he arrived at Leice&s;ter abbey; where, feeling his end approach|ing, he &s;ent for Sir William King&s;ton, and &s;poke to this effect: <Q>&startq;Had I &s;erv|ed God as diligently as I have done the king, he would not have abandoned my grey hairs: but this is my ju&s;t reward. I pray you commend me mo&s;t humbly to the king, de&s;iring him to remember all that hath pa&s;&s;ed between us about queen Catherine; and then his grace may determine whether or not I have given ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence. He is a prince of royal courage; but, rather than be thwarted in his plea&s;ure, will run the ri&s;que of lo&s;ing one half of his realm. I have often kneeled before him three hours &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to di$$$a$e him from his will and appetite, and could not prevail: therefore, Ma&s;ter King&s;ton, if ever you be of his council, deliberate &s;eriou&s;ly upon what you intend to advi&s;e; for, once he &s;ets his heart upon any thing, he<NOTE PLACE="marg">He$$er$. $span$.</NOTE> is not to be diverted from the pur&s;uit.&endq;</Q> Then he di&s;cour&s;ed upon the &s;tate of religion, wi&s;hing he might take heed of the Lutherans, by the example of tho&s;e of Bohemia, le&s;t the &s;ecular power &s;hould be &s;ubverted by their practices. In the pro&s;ecution of this di&s;cour&s;e his &s;peech failed him; and, in a little time,
<PB N="599" REF="6110">
he expired. He was privately buried in the abbey; and though the king &s;eemed afflicted at his death, he did not fail to make inquiry about fifteen hun|dred pounds, which he had lately borrowed from different per&s;ons, to defray his nece&s;&s;ary expences. Such was the fate of cardinal Wol&s;ey, a churchman of &s;ome parts, intolerable pride, and unmea&s;urable ambition, who had by his in|trigues rai&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uch a pitch of power and grandeur, as no other ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic under the degree of pope had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>By this time the reformation had taken deep root in Germany, al|though the emperor had bani&s;hed Luther and all his adherents. In the year that &s;ucceeded this decree, the diet a&s;&s;embled at Nuremberg, produced one hundred articles of grievance again&s;t the court of Rome; and demanded &s;a|tisfaction by means of a free council. The &s;ame demand was made in a &s;ub|&s;equent diet, and oppo&s;ed by a decree of the catholics a&s;&s;embled at Rati&s;bon. In a third diet held at Spire, it was decreed, that the emperor &s;hould be in|treated to convoke a general council in Germany; and in the mean time, that every per&s;on &s;hould enjoy liberty of con&s;cience. Charles finding him&s;elf on the eve of a peace with France, ordered a diet to be a&s;&s;embled in the &s;ame place, where it was ordained, that no innovation &s;hould be made in religion; and the electors of Saxony and Brandenburgh, the landgrave of He&s;&s;e, and the princes of Lunenburg, prote&s;ting in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner again&s;t this de|cree, their party acquired the name of Prote&s;tants. The emperor being incen&s;ed at their pre&s;umption, re&s;olved to cru&s;h them effectually; and for that purpo&s;e convoked a diet at Aug&s;burgh, before which the prote&s;tants demanded permi&s;&s;ion to declare their belief. This favour being refu&s;ed, though they were permitted to deliver it in writing, the landgrave of He&s;&s;e retired without taking leave of the emperor, who ordered the gates to be &s;hut for detaining the re&s;t of that per&s;ua&s;ion; but, they were opened again at the intreaty of the elector of Saxony. After ob&s;tinate debates, the diet enacted a decree again&s;t the prote&s;t|ants, who neverthele&s;s, were amu&s;ed with the hope of a general council. When the diet broke up, the emperor convoked the electors to choo&s;e his bro|ther Ferdinand king of the Romans. This convocation was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the reformers, who repre&s;ented the inconveniencies that would attend the de&s;ign of rendering the Imperial dignity hereditary in the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Finding their remon&s;trance on this &s;ubject altogether di&s;$egarded, they a&s;&s;em|bled at Smalcalde, where they concluded a defen&s;ive league again&s;t all tho&s;e who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleidan.</NOTE> &s;hould attack them on the &s;core of religion; and made a formal prote&s;t again&s;t the election of a king of the Romans. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The prote&s;tant religion had a great number of favourers in Eng|land, where the writings and &s;ermons of Wickliff and his followers had long ago begun to open the eyes of the people, who were be&s;ides oppre&s;&s;ed by the pope's authority, and &s;candalized by the lewd and immoral lives of the la&s;t pon|tiffs who had &s;at in the chair of St. Peter. They wanted nothing but an op|portunity to free them&s;elves from this &s;hameful bondage. Henry being well acquainted with their di&s;po&s;ition, re&s;olved to renounce all papal juri&s;diction; and in the affair of the divorce, &s;tand to the award of his own parliament and clergy. For this purpo&s;e, the fir&s;t was a&s;&s;embled on the &s;ixth day of January; and at the &s;ame time, the clergy met in convocation. The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment was opened by the chancellor, who declared, that the king's de&s;ire of &s;ee|ing
<PB N="600" REF="6120">
the marriage di&s;&s;olved, was not actuated by carnal motives, as &s;ome mali|cious people alledged, but &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;cruples of con&s;cience, and zeal for the good of his kingdom, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne might not be di&s;puted at his decea&s;e. Then he produced a great number of books and treati&s;es, writ|ten by the able$t divines and ca&s;ui&s;ts of Europe, on the &s;ubject of the divorce, with extracts of divers authors antient as well as modern; and the deci&s;ions of the univer&s;ities of France, Italy, and England. The&s;e were left on the table for the peru&s;al of the members; and in the mean time, the king imparted his de&s;igns to the convocation of the clergy, who unanimou&s;ly declared, that his marriage was contrary to the law of God. This in&s;tance of complai&s;ance, however, did not exempt them from a pro&s;ecution with which they had been threatened by his maje&s;ty. Cardinal Wol&s;ey had been convicted of exerci&s;ing the legatine power in England without a &s;pecial licen&s;e from the king, and of giving away benefices in that capacity, contrary to the &s;tatutes of provi&s;ors and premunire, con&s;equently, tho&s;e who acknowledged his authority, were acce&s;&s;ory to his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. This was the ca&s;e with the whole body of the clergy, who were accordingly accu&s;ed of having violated the laws of the kingdom. Such a pro&s;ecution an&s;wered Henry's purpo&s;e in two re&s;pects. It not only furni&s;hed him with a pretence for extorting a large &s;um of money, but al&s;o humbled the clergy in the eyes of the people; and rendered them more dependant upon his plea&s;ure. In vain they pleaded, that the king him&s;elf had con&s;ented to the car|dinal's exerci&s;ing his legatine power; they were convicted of the crime laid to their charge, and all their effects confi&s;cated, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction of the &s;ubjects in general, who had long groaned under eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny. The clergy &s;eeing how low their credit was among the people, and the little re|gard which the nation payed to papal authority, re&s;olved to &s;ubmit, and implore the king's pardon, for which they agreed to pre&s;ent him with one hun|dred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. A committee of the convocation at Canter|bury being appointed to draw up this act and petition, &s;ome individuals in the intere&s;t ot the court, propo&s;ed, that in this public act, the clergy &s;hould own the king as protector and &s;upreme head of the Anglicane church. This pro|po&s;al at fir&s;t met with great oppo&s;ition; and the con&s;ideration of the affair was<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> referred till their next meeting, when, by means of archbi&s;hop Warham, Tho|mas Cromwell, and others of the council, it was agreed, that the king &s;hould be &s;tiled &s;upreme head of the church, as far as was agreeable to the law of Chri&s;t. The convocation of the clergy in the province of York re&s;olved al&s;o, to pre&s;ent his maje&s;ty with eighteen thou&s;and eight hundred pounds; but, as in the act they did not own the king's &s;upremacy, they were given to under&s;tand, that their pre&s;ent would not be accepted; and they thought proper to follow the example of the other convocation.</P>

<P>Henry being &s;atisfied with this acqui&s;ition of power, indulged them with an ample pardon: but, the commons refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the bill, unle&s;s the laity, who might be liable to the &s;ame pro&s;ecution, &s;hould be comprehended.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The king being informed of this ob&s;tacle, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, im|porting, that he was re&s;olved to be ma&s;ter of his own favours, which he would never grant upon compul&s;ion; and the hou&s;e dreading his di&s;plea&s;ure, pa&s;&s;ed the bill without further oppo&s;ition. Then he indulged the laity with an act of amne&s;ty, which did not, however, include colleges and mona&s;teries; for, the&s;e

were afterwards obliged to pay for a compo&s;ition. The pope was now in &s;uch an embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, that he did not know what cour&s;e to follow. He by this time had fallen off from the emperor, who had decided again&s;t him in the affair of Ferrara. He &s;aw Germany threatened with an inva&s;ion by the Turks, the Roman catholic religion endangered by the progre&s;s of the reforma|tion; and an intimate union &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the kings of France and England: be therefore re&s;olved to wait in &s;ilence for a more favourable oppor|tunity of retrieving his influence with the Engli&s;h nation. Henry, mean while, prorogued the parliament, and ordered the deci&s;ions and writings in favour of the divoce to be printed and publi&s;hed, that all his &s;ubjects might under&s;tand the ca&s;e before the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. As he pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to obtain Catherine's con&s;ent to a &s;eparation, he &s;ent &s;everal bi&s;hops, and lay noblemen to per&s;uade her to wave her appeal; and, when they pre&s;&s;ed her to refer the cau&s;e to the de|ci&s;ion of four eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and as many &s;eculars, &s;he &s;aid &s;he would pray God to &s;end the king a quiet con&s;cience; but, that &s;he was his lawful wife, and would abide by her right, until the court of Rome &s;hould declare the con|trary. Henry finding her ob&s;tinacy in&s;urmountable, de&s;ired &s;he would choo&s;e her re&s;idence at any of his manours; and &s;he an&s;wered, that to what place &s;oever &s;he &s;hould be removed, &s;he could not be removed from the &s;tation of his wife.

<P>Nothing could be more agreeable to the Engli&s;h than the hu|miliation of the prelates. They now began openly to di&s;cu&s;s controverted points of religion; and were by their indi&s;creet zeal hurried into dangerous ex|tremities. The bi&s;hops, in order to lighten the burden of the &s;um they had granted to his maje&s;ty, were de&s;irous that a part &s;hould be borne by the infe|rior clergy; and the bi&s;hop of London a&s;&s;embled &s;ome prie&s;ts of that metropo|lis in the chapter-hou&s;e of St. Paul's, to propo&s;e an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. His purpo&s;e was to obtain the con&s;ent of a few at fir&s;t, hoping the re&s;t would follow their example. But all the London prie&s;ts being appri&s;ed of his intention, went thi|ther in a tumultuous manner, accompanied by a great number of laymen, who fomented the di&s;pute; and when the bi&s;hop made the propo&s;al, they an&s;wered, they had never meddled with any of the cardinal's faculties, con&s;equently had not fallen in the premunire: that their livings were already too &s;mall for their &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence: that, as the guilt lay intirely among the bi&s;hops and abbots, who had good preferment, they only ought to &s;u&s;tain the puni&s;hment: as for them&s;elves, they had not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and therefore would not pay for a pardon. They had already bur&s;t open the door, and committed divers irregularities; and now that the bi&s;hop's officers threatened them with condign puni&s;hment, a &s;harp conflict en&s;ued, in which his lord&s;hip's &s;ervants having been very roughly handled, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the rioters with his ble&s;&s;ing, a&s;&s;uring them, they &s;hould not be called in que&s;tion for this di&s;turbance. Far from keeping his word, he complained to the chancellor, by who&s;e order fifteen prie&s;ts, and five lay|men were committed to pri&s;on; but, whether or not the inferior clergy payed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hall. Burnet.</NOTE> any proportion of the tax, we cannot determine. Henry, alarmed at the&s;e com|motions, re&s;olved to convince his people, that although he had &s;haken off the papal yoke, his intention was not to violate the e&s;&s;ential truths of religion;

The aim of Francis was to regain the footing he had lo&s;t in Italy, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h mo|narch, and fomenting jealou&s;y between Charles and the pope, whom he &s;ooth|ed and threatened by turns, according to the prevailing pa&s;&s;ions of his holine&s;s.

He con|cluded an agreement with the princes of the league of Smalcalde; and per|&s;uaded the king of England to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with fifty thou&s;and crowns, remitted by the hands of the French amba&s;&s;ador, as a &s;um to be employed for the de|fence<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and con&s;ervation of the rights and privileges of the empire.

Though this was purely defen&s;ive, as the articles were not known, the emperor was not a little alarmed, believing, that while the Turks &s;hould in|vade his Au&s;trian dominions, Henry and Francis would attack him in Italy and the Low Countries.

<P>The parliament meeting on the fifteenth day of January, the com|mons, who were previou&s;ly in&s;tructed by the court, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, be|&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to con&s;ent to the reformation of div$rs abu&s;es which had crep$ into the immunities enjoyed by the clergy. The king an&s;wered, that before he could a&s;&s;ent to a propo&s;al of &s;uch importance, he would hear what the clergy had to &s;ay in their own defence. This &s;tep was taken, in order to &s;hew them how much they needed his royal protection, hated as they were by the parliament. Several &s;tatutes were enacted, which &s;lightly touched upon the privileges of that body; though they were abundantly con&s;oled for the&s;e mor|tifications, by an act relea&s;ing them from the payment of annates to the pop$$

which had ever been a heavy burden. The &s;tatute imported, That &s;ince the reign of the late king, above one hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds had been &s;ent to Rome, on account of annates, or fir&s;t-fruits, palls and bulls for bi|&s;hoprics: That the annates had been originally intended as a contribution for a war again&s;t the infidels; but, as they were not employed for that purpo&s;e, it was enacted, That they &s;hould not be payed for the future: That not above five per cent$ of the actual revenue &s;hould be payed for the bulls of bi&s;hoprics: That, in ca&s;e of the pope's refu&s;ing to grant them on the&s;e conditions, the bi|&s;hop elect &s;hould be pre&s;ented by the king to the metropolitan of the province, by whom he &s;hould be con&s;ecrated: but, &s;hould the archbi&s;hop refu&s;e con&s;e|cration, on pretence that he him&s;elf had not as yet received his bulls or pallium, two prelates nominated by the king &s;hould perform the ceremony; and then the elect &s;hould be deemed lawfully con&s;ecrated.

<P>About this period the king received a letter from the pope, ob|&s;erving, that he had heard of his putting away his queen, and keeping an|other per&s;on called Anne, as his wife, to the great &s;candal of his character, and contempt of the holy apo&s;tolic &s;ee, before which the &s;uit was &s;till depending: he therefore exhorted him to take back queen Catherine, and di&s;mi&s;s Anne; and in &s;o doing, he would avoid a rupture with the emperor, who could never otherwi&s;e dige&s;t &s;uch an indignity as he had put upon his aunt; and prevent an interruption in the union of Chri&s;tendom, which was the only &s;ecurity again&s;t the progre&s;s of the Infidels. It does not appear that Henry &s;ent a par|ticular an&s;wer to this letter; but, he di&s;patched doctor Bennet to Rome in qua|lity of amba&s;&s;ador, to lay before the pope the deci&s;ions and opinions of univer|&s;ities and learned men, touching the divorce; and he was charged with a letter, in which the king taxed his holine&s;s with ignorance, partiality, and deceit; de|clared, that he did not intend to impugn his authority further, unle&s;s compelled; de&s;ired he would conform to the opinion of &s;o many learned ca&s;ui&s;ts; and do his duty according to the dictates of his con&s;cience. Clement, in&s;tead of grati|fying the king's inclination, expedited a citation, &s;ummoning him to appear in per&s;on, or by proxy, at Rome, to an&s;wer to the queen's appeal; and Sir Edward Karne was &s;ent thither as Henry's excu&s;ator. He was in&s;tructed to employ the be&s;t coun&s;el he could find, to ju&s;tify the king for not appearing at Rome, on the principles of the canon law, and the prerogatives of the crown of Eng|land. He was accompanied by Bonner; and found the con&s;i&s;tory divided in their opinions of the divorce. Tho&s;e who favoured the emperor, pre&s;&s;ed the pope to proceed in the cau&s;e. The more moderate cardinals advi&s;ed him to act with caution, as in all probability he would lo&s;e England by adhering to Charles. The pope him&s;elf being informed of the bill concerning annates, expo|&s;tulated on that &s;ubject with the amba&s;&s;adors, who an&s;wered, that as it was &s;till in the king's power to revoke the act, it would depend upon his holine&s;s whe|ther
<PB N="604" REF="6160">
it &s;hould be annulled or confirmed. They retained Rovidellus, a learned canoni&s;t of Bologna, to plead the king's cau&s;e; and they bribed the cardinals of Ravenna, Monte, and Anc$$a, to u&s;e their influence in his behalf. The excu&s;atory plea was argued in the con&s;i&s;tory, and after much di&s;pute, neither allowed nor rejected: but, the vacation approaching, the pope and college of cardinals wrote a letter to Henry, intrea$$ng, him to &s;end a proxy in the win|ter. Bonner, who was &s;ent over to England on this occa&s;ion, had in&s;tructions from the cardinals who were gained over to the king's intere&s;t, to a&s;&s;u$e him, that the affair could be judged in no other manner but in the con&s;i&s;tory; and that he had nothing to fear from the deci&s;ion of the pope, who now leaned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> to the French intere&s;t.</P>

<P>While the&s;e points were $word$ at Rome, the parliament of England met again in April; and in the cour&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, a member of the name of Tem&s;e moved, that an addre&s;s might be pre&s;ented to the king, praying his maje&s;ty to take back the queen, and avoid all the inconveniencies that might attend the illegitimation of the prince&s;s. Henry was incen&s;ed at the freedom of this commoner, for which he c$id the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e, and appealed to the te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience for the ju&s;tification of his conduct. He afterwards repre&s;ented to the lower hou&s;e, his intention of peopling the Eng|li&s;h &s;ide of the northern Marches which were uninhabited; and the members voted a &s;ub&s;idy for this purpo&s;e; but, before the bill could be p$&s;&s;ed, the plague broke out in London, and the parliament was prorogued till February. Immediately after this prorogation, Sir Thomas More dreading the con&s;equences of a total rupture with the court of Rome, and di&s;liking the per&s;on and pro|ceedings of A$$e Boleyn, re&s;igned his office of chancellor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">$word$ $word$ $word$ who wa$ very $$ch ad|$$c$$d $word$ $word$ $eti$ed $o Che$$ea, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his $word$ $$de a pre&s;ent of his fool to the lord $word$ $word$ his wife by $word$ $word$ $word$ $word$ him, and lived with his daughters, upon the income of a &s;mall e&s;tate, not exceeding one hundred pounds a-year, and the intere&s;t of a little money.

<P>When the two kings part$d, Henry returned to England$ and in January was privately married to An$$ Boleyn, by Rowland Lee$ afterwords bi&s;hop of Coventry and Li$chfield, in pre&s;ence of Cranmer, wh$ had $word$ &s;uc|ceeded Wareham in the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, the dukes of Norfol$ and Suffolk, and Anne's father, mother, and brothers. The pop$ had &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the king, propo&s;ing to &s;end a legate, with two auditors of the Rota$ to try the cau&s;e in &s;ome indifferent place, re&s;erving the &s;entence to him&s;elf; and that a truce &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for four years, before the expiration of which he would call a general council. Henry di&s;patched Sir Thomas Elli$t with an an&s;wer to the&s;e propo&s;als, importing, That he could take no re&s;olution concern|ing a peace, without the concurrence of the French king: that, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent &s;tate of religion in Germany, he apprehended a general council would be altogether un&s;ea&s;onable: that he could not &s;end a proxy to Rome, or any other place out of his own dominions, without giving up the prerogative of his c$own, and acting contrary to the laws of his kingdom$ $ut, that his $oline&s;s might remit the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the affair to the clergy of Eng|land, and confirm the &s;entence they &s;hould pronounce. The emperor, alarm$d at the de&s;igns of $olyman emperor of the Turks, as well as at the interview and league between Henry and Francis, thought it was high time to quiet the cla|mours of the prote&s;tants; and for that purpo&s;e repaired to the diet of Rati$|bon, where it was decreed, that no per&s;on &s;hould be mole&s;ted on account of re|ligion, until a general council &s;hould be convoked. The prote&s;tanta were &s;o well &s;atisfied with this indulgence, that they joined the other princes in $ur|ni&s;hing Charles with &s;uch proportions of men and &s;uccours$ as enabled him to a&s;&s;emble a very powerful army, to &s;top the progre&s;s of the Infidels. The&s;e in|vaded Hungary, and advanced as far as Au&s;tria, in hope of drawing the Impe|riali&s;ts into a battle; but Charles wi&s;ely avoided a general engagement, and hampered them &s;o much in their progre&s;s, that they were &s;oo$ obliged to $$|treat into their own country. Then the emperor repaired to Bolo$n$, where he had $n interview with the pope, to whom he propo&s;ed a general council for the reduction of the prote$$ants, a match between Catherine de Medicis and Sforza duke of Milan; and a league of the Italian powers, who &s;hould main|tain an army to defend their country from inva&s;ion. Clement would not agree<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guicciardini.</NOTE> to a council, becau&s;e the la&s;t of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies had encroached upon the $$p$l authority: he told the emperor, that his niece was already engaged to the duk$ of Orleans; but, he a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al of the league, which was accord|ingly concluded. About this time, doctor Bennet the Engli&s;h envoy made fre&s;h overtures touching the divorce; but they were rejected by the pope, as ex|pedients that would intrench upon his prerogative. He o$dered the $word$ of the Rota to &s;ummon Henry, to an&s;wer to the queen's appeal$ Karne prote&s;ted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> again&s;t the citation, as the king could not expect ju&s;tice at Rome, where the emperor's intere&s;t predominated. He demanded, that his holine&s;s would de$$$$, otherwi&s;e Henry would appeal to the deci&s;ion of learned ca&s;ui&s;ts and univer|&s;ities: he affirmed, there was a nullity in all the proceedings: that his king

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ch. An. 1533.</NOTE> The Engli&s;h people re&s;olved to concur heartily with the king in all his mea&s;ures for aboli&s;hing the papal authority in this kingdom. The par|liament a&s;&s;embling in February, enacted a &s;tatute, prohibiting all appeals to Rome, under the penalty &s;pecified in the &s;tatute of Premunire. Cranmer being in Germany when the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury became vacant, was no &s;ooner informed of the king's intention in his favour, than he begged to be ex|cu&s;ed from &s;uch a burthen&s;ome dignity; but, his refu&s;al &s;erving only to confirm Henry in his de&s;ign of promoting him to that &s;ee, he was obliged to return, though he journeyed &s;lowly, in hope that the king's re&s;olution might be altered before his arrival. Henry having great confidence in his learning, courage, and integrity, looked upon him as the only man who could put the fini&s;h|ing &s;troke to the divorce; and in&s;i&s;ted upon his receiving the archbi&s;hopric. After Cranmer had &s;ubmitted with great reluctance to the will of his &s;overeign<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$$ P$b.</NOTE> in this particular, another difficulty occurred. He profe&s;&s;ed &s;cruples of con|&s;cience about taking the u&s;ual oath to the pope; but, at length, the king found out a &s;alvo, which removed his objections. This was a previous prote&s;tation again&s;t the oath, which he accordingly made, not much for the credit of his character; and was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the temporalities of the archbi&s;hopric. This affair being determined, the convocation of the province of Canterbury was a&s;&s;embled, and required to give their opinion on the following que&s;tions: Whe|ther or not the di&s;pen&s;ation of pope Julius II. for the marriage of Catherine and Henry, was &s;ufficient to render the &s;aid marriage binding and valid? and, Whe|ther or not the con&s;ummation of Arthur's nuptials with that prince&s;s, had been fully proved? On the fifth day of April the convocation declared, That the pope had no power to grant di&s;pen&s;ations again&s;t the law of God; and, that the con&s;ummation of the fir&s;t marriage had been as fully proved as the nature of the ca&s;e would permit. The &s;ame an&s;wers were made to tho&s;e propo&s;itions by the convocation of York; and Henry re&s;olved to proceed upon the cau&s;e of the divorce before the judicature of his own clergy.</P>

<P>In the mean time, he de&s;ired Francis to &s;end over &s;ome per&s;on of confidence, to whom he might impart certain things which he did not care to divulge; and the French king pitched upon William du Bellay lord of Lan|geais, who was ordered to tell Henry, that the marriage between the duke of Orleans and Catherine de Medicis was concluded, and would be celebrated at Mar&s;eilles in the pre&s;ence of the pope and Francis: that the pre&s;ence of the king of England at &s;uch a juncture, would probably induce Clement to comply with his de&s;ires: or, that &s;hould he decline coming in per&s;on, he might &s;end thither an envoy to &s;ollicit his affair. When Du Bellay arrived in England, Henry gave him to under&s;tand, that as Clement had ob&s;tinately rejected all his propo|&s;als, he was re&s;olved to renounce Clement in his turn: that he had married Anne Boleyn; but, that he would keep his mariage &s;ecret until the month of May, to $ee if the king of France could prevail upon the bi&s;hop of Rome to do him him ju&s;tice; but, &s;hould that pontiff &s;till continue ob&s;tinate, $e would intirely withdraw him&s;elf from the papal power. He likewi&s;e told Langeais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$m. Du $word$</NOTE> that he had written a book upon the U&s;urpation of the Roman &s;ee, and the pre|rogatives

of crowned heads; but would not publi&s;h it until all hope of accom|modation &s;hould vani&s;h. It was not in his power, however, to conceal his marriage much longer; for his new wife became pregnant, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to make it public, in order to pre&s;erve her reputation. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury now demanded his permi&s;&s;ion to proceed again&s;t his former mar|riage with Catherine, who&s;e con&s;ent to the divorce the king attempted to ob|tain by fair means; but his endeavours proving ineffectual, the queen was cited to appear at Dun&s;taple, near the place of her re&s;idence. She reject|ing the citation, Cranmer pronounced &s;entence, declaring her marriage null, as being contrary to the law of God; and, by another, confirmed the king's marriage with Anne Boleyn, who was crowned on the fir&s;t day of June.</P>

<P>Henry &s;ent the lord Mountjoy to intimate the&s;e &s;enten$es to Catherine, who &s;till refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit; and the king ordered that, for the fu|ture, &s;he &s;hould have no other title than that of prince&s;s dowager of Wales. He likewi&s;e notified his divorce and new marriage to all the neighbouring prin|ces; and, among the re&s;t, to the emperor, by the mouth of Sir Thomas Wyat, who endeavoured to ju&s;tify his maje&s;ty's conduct, and told the emperor, that the king of England hoped to find him his friend, as he had been heretofore. Charles received this intimation very coldly; and an&s;wered, that he would take the advice of his council, touching the mea&s;ures he &s;hould pur&s;ue. The pope was incen&s;ed to the utmo&s;t degree of indignation at the &s;entence of Cranmer, and the book written by Henry again&s;t the papal authority; a copy of which had been already peru&s;ed at Rome. He forthwith rever&s;ed the &s;entence; and declared, that the king him&s;elf de&s;erved excommunication, unle&s;s he &s;hould, before the end of September, renounce all that had been done contrary to the authority of the holy &s;ee. Clement &s;till hoped that &s;ome expedient might be found to reclaim Henry, who had gone too far to retract, but &s;ent the duke of Norfolk, as his amba&s;&s;ador, to accompany Francis in his interview with the pope at Mar&s;eilles. That nobleman, while he re&s;ided in France, being informed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE> of the &s;teps that were taken again&s;t his ma&s;ter at Rome, &s;ent lord Rochford to Eng|land for new in&s;tructions, and was him&s;elf immediately recalled. Neverthele$s, the king, at the de&s;ire of Francis, &s;ent Stephen Gardiner, lately created bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, with Sir Francis Bryan, and Sir John Wallop, to attend him at the interview; and the&s;e were accompanied by Edmund Bonner, an $ccle|&s;ia&s;tic of great impudence and re&s;olution. After the celebration of the $$p|tials at Mar&s;eilles, Francis prevailed upon the pope to &s;atisfy the king of Eng|land; but, in order to &s;ave the honour of the holy &s;ee, he in&s;i&s;ted upon judging the cau&s;e in a con&s;i&s;tory, from which the cardinals of the emperor's faction &s;hould be excluded. Bonner, who was ignorant of this re&s;olution, demanded an audience of Clement, and gave him to under&s;tand that the king of England had ap|pealed to a future council from any papal &s;entence that either was or might be given again&s;t him. The pope &s;aid he would take the advice of the cardinals; and, in a few days, told him that the appeal was not receivable: but Bonner, without being intimidated by this an&s;wer, proceeded to notify the appeal of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury from the rever&s;ion of the &s;entence he had pro|nounced; and his holine&s;s was &s;o incen&s;ed at Bonner's pre&s;umption, that he threatened to cau&s;e him to be thrown into a cauldron of molten lead.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding this intervention of Bonner, which, for the pre&s;ent, prevented the accommodation; Francis did not de&s;pair of &s;eeing the di&s;po$e terminated in an amicable manner. On his return from Mar&s;eilles he &s;ent John du Bellay, bi&s;hop of Paris, with new propo&s;als to Henry, who con|&s;ented to the di&s;pute's being terminated at Cambray, by judges who could not be &s;u&s;pected of partiality. The bi&s;hop, having gained this point, &s;et out for Rome in the middle of winter, and found Clement very well di&s;po&s;ed to agree to this expedient: but he in&s;i&s;ted upon Henry's &s;igning a writing, by which he &s;hould be bound to abide by this determination; and, in order to avoid delays, fixed a certain day for the return of the courier, who was di&s;patched to England for the in&s;trument. The emperor's mini&s;ters were no &s;ooner informed of this negotiation, than they pre&s;&s;ed the pope to revoke his engagement; and, by dint of importunity, obtained his promi&s;e, that if the courier &s;hould not arrive within the limited time, he would hold him&s;elf di&s;engaged, and give &s;entence again&s;t Henry. The me&s;&s;enger not appearing preci&s;ely within the time, the bi&s;hop of Paris &s;ollicited a delay of &s;ix days only; but the pope was &s;o much affected by the menaces of the Imperiali&s;ts, that he would not comply with this reque&s;t. On the contrary, he fini&s;hed in one con&s;i&s;tory, what, according to the u&s;ual forms, ought to have been canva&s;&s;ed in three. He publi&s;hed a &s;en|tence, declaring the marriage of Henry with Catherine good and legitimate, and commanded that prince to take back his wife, on pain of occurring eccle$i|a&s;tial cen&s;ure. In two days after this deci&s;ion the courier arrived from Eng|land, with full power to the bi&s;hop of Paris to grant what the pope had de|manded$<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and &s;everal cardinals advi&s;ed him to revoke the &s;entence, but the emperor's parti$ans prevailed upon him to reject the propo&s;al.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1$$4.</NOTE> In all probability the king was not &s;incere in his propo&s;als of ac|commodation with Clement; for, even before he could know the i&s;&s;ue of that negotiation, the parliament, meeting on the fifteenth day of January, began the &s;e&s;&s;ion with an act, r$pealing the &s;tatute of Henry IV. again&s;t heretics. Not that the parliament intended to exempt them from the penalty; for, by the new law, they were condemned to the &s;take: but, in order to hinder the clergy from being &s;ole judges in &s;uch ca&s;es, it was enacted that heretics &s;hould be tried ac|cording to the laws of the kingdom, without any regard to the cannon law. By another act it was decreed, That no &s;ynod or convocation of the clergy &s;hould be held without the king's licence: That his maje&s;ty &s;hould appoint two and thirty per&s;ons from the parliament and the clergy, to examine the canons and con&s;titutions of the church$ That tho&s;e which were nece&s;&s;ary &s;hould be pre&s;erved, and all the re&s;t aboli&s;hed. This parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act of attainder or conviction again&s;t Elizabeth Barton, known by the appellation of the maid of Kent, a native of the pari&s;h of Aldington, who was tutored by certain eccle|&s;ia&s;tics to exc$te di&s;turbances in the kingdom. She had been troubled with hy$terical fi$s, during which &s;he uttered many incoherent and delirious expre&s;|&s;ions, which induced the ignorant by-&s;tanders to believe &s;he was divinely in|&s;pired. Richard Ma&s;ter, the pari&s;h prie&s;t, fore&s;eeing advantages to him&s;elf in trumping up an impo&s;ture, per&s;uaded this weak fanatic that &s;he actually &s;poke

from the in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t; taught her to counterfeit trances, and utter &s;peeches which were deemed the oracles of heaven: he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this knavi&s;h de&s;ign by one doctor Bocking, a canon of Chri&s;t-Church in Can|terbury. Elizabeth, thus in&s;tructed, became an apt pupil; prophe&s;ied with all the marks of holy emotion, writhed her body into &s;trange contor&s;ions, in|veighed again&s;t the favourers of the new doctrine as abominable hereties, ex|claimed again&s;t the king's divorce; and, in order to rai&s;e the reputation of a chapel within the pari&s;h, declared that the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin had appeared to her, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would never recover until &s;he &s;hould vi&s;it her image in that place of wor&s;hip. She accordingly went in pilgrimage to the chapel; where, in the mid&s;t of an infinite concour&s;e of people, &s;he pretended to fall into a trance, poured forth pious ejaculations, declared that God had called her to a religious life, and appointed Bocking to be her gho&s;tly father; &s;he pretended to be recovered of all her di&s;tempers by the interce&s;&s;ion of the Virgin; took the veil, &s;aw vi&s;ions, heard melody, received from Mary Magdalen a letter from heaven, was conveyed by an angel to Calais, while the king re&s;ided in that city, received the &s;acrament in his pre&s;ence, though invi&s;ible; and was brought back again in the &s;ame manner to her own mona&s;tery. She prophe&s;ied that if Henry &s;hould proceed in the divorce, and marry another wife, his royalty would not be of a month's duration, but that he &s;hould die the death of a vil|lain.</P>

<P>Her pretended revelations were collected and in&s;erted in a book, by a monk called Deering. Warham, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a credulous though pious prelate, was impo&s;ed upon by her delu&s;ions: &s;he was countenanced by Fi&s;her bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and others, who adhered to the intere&s;t of Cathe|rine. They held private meetings with this diviner, and debauched many per|&s;ons from their allegiance, particularly the fathers and nuns of Sion, the Char|ter-hou&s;e, and Sheen, and &s;ome of the Ob&s;ervants of Richmond, Greenwich, and Canterbury. One Peto, preaching before the king at Greenwich, told him he had been deceived by many lying prophets; but he, as a true Micajah, warned him that the dogs &s;hould lick his blood, as they had licked the blood of Ahab. Henry bore this in&s;ult with great temper; but, to undeceive the people, appointed doctor Corren to preach before him on the en&s;uing &s;unday, when that eccle&s;ia&s;tic ju&s;tified the king's proceedings, and branded Peto with the epithets of rebel, &s;landerer, dog, and traitor. He was interrupted by an Ob&s;ervant friar of the name of Ell&s;ton, who called him a lying prophet, that &s;ought to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown upon adultery. He &s;poke with &s;uch virulence that the king was obliged to interpo&s;e, and command him to hold his peace; and he and Peto were afterwards &s;ummoned before the coun|cil, and rebuked for their intemperance. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics engaged this con&s;piracy, encouraged by the lenity of the government, had re&s;olved to pub|li&s;h the revelations in their &s;ermons throughout the kingdom$ they had com|municated them to the pope's amba&s;&s;adors, to whom al&s;o they introduced the maid of Kent, and they exhorted queen Catherine to per&s;i&s;t in her ob&s;tinacy. At length the confederacy began to be a very &s;erious affair, and Henry ordered the maid and her accomplices to be examined in the Star-chamber; where they confe&s;&s;ed all the particulars of the impo&s;ture, and appeared upon a &s;caffold in St. Paul's church, where the articles of their confe&s;&s;ion were publicly read, in

their hearing. From thence they were conveyed to the Tower, where they re|mained till the meeting of the parliament, which having con&s;idered the ca&s;e, pro|nounced it a con&s;piracy again&s;t the king's life and crown; and the nun, with her accomplices, were attainted of high trea&s;on. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, Thomas Gold, Thomas Laurence, Edward Twai$es, John Adi&s;on, and Tho|mas Abell, were adjudged guilty of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, to forfeit their goods and chattels to the king, and to be impri&s;oned during his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure; and the books of the nun's revelations were ordered to be &s;ent to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, on pain of fine and impri&s;onment. In the cour&s;e of the inquiry they di&s;covered that the letter &s;aid to come from Mary Magdalen, was written by one Hankber&s;t of Canterbury; that the door of a dormitory &s;aid to have been opened by miracle that the nun might go into the chapel, and conver&s;e with God, was really opened for carnal communication between her and her accom|plices. <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE></P>

<P>Henry, having in vain endeavoured to per&s;uade Catherine to &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, began to apprehend &s;ome &s;torm from her nephew the emperor, who had undertaken to execute the pope's &s;entence, and propo&s;ed to render his union with Francis &s;till more intimate, for their common defence. That prince amu&s;ed him with fair promi&s;es, but did not choo&s;e to contract any new con|nexions, le&s;t he &s;hould di&s;oblige the pope, with whom he had been &s;o lately allied. His chief aim was to recover Milan; and, in order to pave the way for repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of that $$tchy, he endeavoured to detach Sforza from the intere&s;t of the emperor, who had re&s;tored him on very hard conditions, and was in his heart di&s;affected to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. That the negotiation might be kept &s;ecret, it was carried on by one Merveille, a native of Milan, who had re&s;ided many years in France, and now returned to his native country with private credentials to Sforza, who received him as the French envoy. The emperor, being informed of this corre&s;pondence, threatened the duke in &s;uch a manner, that he re&s;olved to &s;acrifice Merveille for his &s;atisfaction. He hired a man to quarrel with this envoy; and the fray ending in the murder of the per&s;on thus employed, Merveille was impri&s;oned, convicted, and in two days beheaded. When Francis complained of this outrage offered to his ho|nour in the per&s;on of his envoy, the duke denied that Merveille was in any public character: but the French king, u&s;ing this as a pretext for invading the Milane&s;e, a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, and demanded a pa&s;&s;age through the territories of the duke of Savoy. That prince refu&s;ing his demand, he re&s;olved to &s;trip him of his dominions, to which he trumped up a claim in right of his mother Loui&s;a; and, during his preparations for this war, pope Clement dying, was &s;ucceeded in the papacy by cardinal Farne&s;e, who a&s;&s;umed the name of Paul III.

<P>The parliament of England re-a&s;&s;embling on the twenty-third day of November, enacted &s;everal important laws, to de&s;troy all future connexion between the king$om and the pope. They confirmed the title of &s;upreme head of the church, which the clergy had already be&s;towed upon the king. They declared all tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;peak, write, or imagine any thing to the prejudice of the king and queen, guilty of high trea&s;on. They deprived all &s;uch of the benefit of &s;anctuaries. They drew up a certain form of oath to be taken by &s;ubjects$ with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, aboli&s;hing all former oaths on the &s;ame &s;ubject. They adjudged to the king the annates and fir&s;t fruits, together with the tythe of all benefices. They e&s;tabli&s;hed five and twenty &s;uffragans to be cho&s;en by the king, and to depend upon the bi&s;hops of the dioce&s;es to which they &s;hould belong; and granted a general amne&s;ty, from which, however, they excepted Fi&s;her and More, who were, by a parti|cular<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> act, declared guilty of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. After the parliament broke up, the king publi&s;hed a proclamation to &s;uppre&s;s the name of pope, and eraze it from all books and writing. All the prelates renounced obedience to the bi&s;hop of Rome, and, among the re&s;t, Gardiner bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, tho' in his heart he dete&s;ted the king's mea&s;ures. By this time the reformation had made great progre&s;s in England as well as in Germany, notwith&s;tanding the per&s;ecution which had been rai&s;ed at the in&s;tigation of Sir Thomas More, while he occupied the office of chancellor. The treati&s;es of Luther were well known to the &s;ubjects of Henry; and the Bible was tran&s;lated into the Engli&s;h lan|guage<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> by Tindal, who had withdrawn into the Low Countries. The bi&s;hop of London ordered &s;ome copies of this tran&s;lation to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. Several per&s;ons were burned and &s;uffered martyr|dom with &s;urpri&s;ing con&s;tancy. The&s;e feverities, in&s;tead of extingui&s;hing, &s;erved only to feed the flame of religious oppo&s;ition, which was likewi&s;e in|crea&s;ed by the quarrel with the pope. The reformation was favoured by Anne Boleyn, archbi&s;hop Cranmer, and &s;ecretary Cromwell; but, at the &s;ame time, it had very powerful enemies in the per&s;ons of the duke of Norfolk, Gardiner, Longland bi&s;hop of Lincoln, and many other eccle&s;ia&s;tics who had acce&s;s to court; and, in preaching before Henry, filled their &s;ermons with invectives again&s;t the new doctrine. The king him&s;elf, though he had &s;haken off the papal yoke, was a bigotted catholic in every other re&s;pect; and, to his dying day, believed the real pre&s;ence in the Sacrament. Be&s;ides, he had written a book again&s;t the doctrine of Luther, who had treated him in a &s;currilous man|ner; and though that reformer had afterwards humbled him&s;elf in a letter to Henry, he could never forgive the in&s;olence of his fir&s;t attack.</P>

The&s;e propo&s;als were favourably received by Francis, who neverthele&s;s demanded that Henry would furni&s;h him with &s;ucco$rs for the war of Savoy, and relea&s;e him intirely from the perpetual pen&s;ion of one hundred thou&s;and crowns, which he had obliged him&s;elf by treaty to pay to the king of England. Henry, judging from this demand that Francis was not in earne$t, declared, that far from renouncing his pen&s;ion, he in&s;i&s;ted upon the payment o$ the arrears within the time pre&s;cribed. This reply interrupted the negotiation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sandoval.

<P>Although Henry had now trampled under foot the papal authority, conquered all oppo&s;ition in his own dominions, reduced the earl of Kildare, who had rebelled in Ireland at the in&s;tigation of the emperor, and concluded a treaty of peace with his nephew James king of Scotland; he did not enjoy that tranquillity which he might have expected to reap from his &s;ucce&s;s. He was embroiled by the di&s;putes about religion, in which he acted &s;uch a part as was agreeable to neither &s;ide. He gave a loo&s;e to his pa&s;&s;ions, and became $oi&s;terous, cruel, and arbitrary. The monks having incen&s;ed him with per|&s;onal abu&s;e, he re&s;olved, with the advice of his council, to execute the laws upon them without mercy. He was in particular exa&s;perated again&s;t the new pope, who created Fi&s;her a cardinal during his impri&s;onment, as a recompence for having denied the king's &s;upremacy. The king, in order to &s;hew his re&s;ent|ment and contempt of the honour which the pope had be&s;towed, ordered the oath to be tendered once more to Fi&s;her, who, refu&s;ing it as before, was con|demned and executed as a traitor. He was a prelate of &s;ome learning, of an ex|emplary life, great au&s;terity, and devoted to the papal power. Sir Thomas More was inveigled by Rich, the &s;ollicitor-general, into a conver&s;ation about the &s;upremacy, which, joined to his former conviction of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, was deemed a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for taking his life away. He was accordingly condemned and decapitated, though the king reaped nothing but reproach from the death of a man who was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed for his integrity, and admired for his wit and facetious humour, which he exerted to the la&s;t moment of his life. He de&s;ired one of the by-&s;tanders to help him to mount the &s;caffold, &s;ay|ing, he &s;hould not be &s;o &s;ollicitous about coming down again. When the exe|cutioner a&s;ked his forgivene&s;s, he told him, he would acquir$ very little ho|nour by doing his work upon hi$, becau&s;e he had a very &s;hort neck; and, after having laid his head upon the block, perceiving his beard was in the way of the ax, he laid it on one &s;ide; &s;aying, it did not de&s;erve to &s;uffer, as it never committed trea&s;on.</P>

on this &s;ubject w$$h Gregorio Ca&s;ali, who &s;t$$l re&s;ided $t Rome, though not in a public char$cter. But when he under&s;tood that Fi&s;her and Mo$e, to|gether with &s;everal mo$ks, had been executed for refu&s;ing to own the king's $$premacy, he concluded that England was lo&s;t for ever to the &s;ee of Rome; and, in order to &s;upport the honour of the papacy, thundered a bull of ex|comm$nication again&s;t Henry, ab&s;olving all his &s;ubjects of th$ir oath of allegiance. He ordered a$l eccle&s;ia&s;tics $o retire from his d$minions, com|manded the nobi$$ty to r$$e in arms again&s;t him, laid the kingdom under an interd$ct, forb$d all c$ri&s;tians to communicate with the Engli&s;h, annulled all treaties which other powers had concluded with Henry before his marriage with Ann Boleyn, and dec$$red $ll the children that &s;hould be produced from that marriage illegitimate and incapable of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: neverthele&s;s, he delayed the publication of this bull, until it could be &s;upported by the Imperial arms. The king was no &s;ooner informed of this attack, than he, in conjunction with Francis, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the princes of the league of Smalcalde in Ger|many, to propo&s;e an union of intere&s;ts: $ut the prote&s;tants, who&s;e only aim was to enjoy liberty of con&s;cience, &s;aw no pro&s;pect of being able to maintain a &s;incere union with two princes who condemned their doctrines, and even per|&s;ecuted tho&s;e of their own &s;ubjects by whom the&s;e doctrines were profe&s;&s;ed.

<P>As the monks had &s;$andered him in many particulars, and even debauched a great number of his &s;ubjects from their allegiance, he, after having deliberated with his council, ordered a general vi&s;itation o$ the mona&s;teries, that &s;trict i$quiry $ight be made into their titles, revenues, the morals of the f$$ars and nuns, and the regulations ob&s;erved in each order. By this expedient be fore&s;aw he &s;hould be able to undeceive the public in their opinion of the &s;anc$ity of &s;uch characters, to wreak his revenge upon the monks, whom he co$&s;idered as his implacable enemies, and augment his revenue with their &s;poils. Thomas Cromwell, being cho&s;en vi&s;itor-general, appointed &s;ub&s;titutes for the examination of the mona&s;teries, where they found &s;uch irregularities and &s;cenes of vice, debauchery, and impo&s;ture, as were di&s;graceful to religion, and indeed &s;hocking to human nature. The examiners, who were by no means friends to mona&s;tic in&s;titutions, did not $ail to exaggerate tho&s;e particulars in their reports. They fir&s;t threatened the delinquent friars and nuns with all t$e $everity of the law, and then in&s;inuated, that, in order to avoid puni&s;hment, and co$ceal the di&s;orders they had committed, they &s;hould re&s;ign their hou&s;es to the king, who would take care to provide for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of every in|dividual. This advice was followed by a great number of priors, with the con|currence of their monks; and the report of the commi&s;&s;ioners was publi&s;hed, that the world might &s;$e there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch a general vi|&s;itation. Then appeared a minute detail of the mo&s;t &s;urprizing enormities. Many convents were divided into factions, which exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t barbarous cruelties on one another, as they chanced $o predominate. They carried on an $$olatrous traffic, by imp$&s;ing upon the &s;uper&s;titious people with relics and
<PB N="615" REF="6270">
images. In &s;ome hou&s;es the vi&s;itors found the implements of clipping and coining. The majority of the nuns in many nunne$$es was pregnant; a great number of abbots and monks was convicted of criminal corre&s;pondence with harlots and married women; and, not a few detected in the gratification of un|natural lu&s;ts, and other brutal practices. After this publication, the king, as<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> the head of the Engli&s;h church, ab&s;olved of their vows all the monks who had engaged in a religious life before the age of four and twenty; and permitted all the re&s;t to quit their mona&s;teries, and live as &s;eculars, according to their own plea&s;ure. But this permi&s;&s;ion producing very little effect, Henry had recour&s;e to other mea&s;ures.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, cardinal Campejus, and an Italian call|ed Ghinacer, were deprived of their bi&s;hoprios of Sali&s;bury and Worce&s;t$$; which the king be&s;towed upon Nicholas Chaxton, and Hugh Latimer, who fa|voured the reformation. John Hel&s;ey obtained the &s;ee of Roche&s;ter, vacant by the death of Fi&s;her, and Edward Fox was appointed bi&s;hop of Hereford. Henry, apprehen&s;ive that James king of Scotland, who he knew was di&s;affected to his per&s;on, would, notwith&s;tanding the peace, take the fir&s;t opportunity of invad|ing England, if any civil commotion &s;hould ari&s;e, thought he could not find a more effectual method to &s;ecure him&s;elf from that quarter, than by per&s;uad|ing his nephew to follow his example, in renouncing the papal authority. For this purpo&s;e he wrote a long letter to that prince, explaining the rea&s;ons of his &s;eparating him&s;elf from the &s;ee of Rome; then he &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to pro|po&s;e an interview.

<P>In the beginning of the en&s;uing year, the unfortunate queen Catherine died at Kimbolton, after having &s;u&s;tained a long &s;eries of afflictions. She had been harra&s;&s;ed by repeated me&s;&s;ages from Henry, importuning her to re&s;ign the title of queen, which &s;he never would lay down, prote&s;ting, that as the pope had declared her marriage valid, &s;he would &s;ooner lo&s;e her life than her title, which &s;he continued to exact from all her &s;ervants. She became, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1536.</NOTE> very affable, and acquired great popularity among the country people. When the king propo&s;ed, that &s;he &s;hould re&s;ide at Fotheringay-Ca&s;tle, &s;he declared, &s;he would never go thither unle&s;s as a pri&s;oner. She lived on the pen&s;ion a&s;&s;igned her as prince&s;s dowager of Wales; and though &s;he could have no great comfort in England, where &s;he was a &s;tranger, &s;he never di&s;covered the lea&s;t inclina|tion to quit the kingdom, where, in all probability, &s;he was detained by her mo|therly care of the prince&s;s Mary. In her will$ &s;he de&s;ired her body might be buried in a convent of Ob&s;ervant friars: that five hundred ma&s;&s;es &s;hould be &s;aid for her &s;oul: and, that a per&s;on &s;hould make a pilgrimage to our lady of Wal&s;ingham, and di&s;tribute two hundred nobles in charity upon the road: &s;he likewi&s;e bequeathed &s;ome legacies to her &s;ervants. When the king heard of her illne&s;s, he &s;ent her a kind me&s;&s;age, and &s;he dictated a very tender letter to

him, in which &s;he called him her dear lord and hu&s;band; forgave him all the trouble in which be had involved her; recommended her daughter Mary to his care and affection; de$ired he would provide for her three maids; indulge her &s;ervants with a &s;mall gratuity: and concluded with the&s;e words. <Q>&startq;I make this $ow$ That mine eyes defire you above all things.&endq;</Q> She was certainly a devout and virtuous prince&s;s, who led a &s;evere and mortified life; but, &s;he was a bigot in religion, and of a fretful di&s;po&s;ition, which, in all probability, at fir&s;t alienated the king's affection, as &s;he had no per&s;onal charms to fix his na|tural incon&s;tancy. He expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome regret at her death; but, would not allow her to be buried according to her own directions. Her body was interred<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> in the abbey church of Peterborough, which he afterwards converted into an epi&s;copal cathedral.

<P>The parliament had impowered the king to nominate two and thirty per&s;ons, to make a collection of eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titutions; and now that act was confirmed. The king repre&s;ented to the parliament in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the great number of mona&s;teries was an expence to the kingdom, and de&s;ired them to apply &s;ome remedy to this evil: in con&s;equence of which remon&s;trance, they pa&s;&s;ed an act, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all mona&s;teries, who&s;e revenues did not exceed two hundred pounds; and appropriated their income for his maje&s;ty's u&s;e. By this law the crown acquired the yearly value of two and thirty thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides a capital of above one hundred thou&s;and pounds, on the plate, ornaments, and effects of churches and convents. Then he erected a new court of ju&s;tice, called the Court of the augmentation of the king's re|venue, for taking cognizance of all &s;uch &s;eque&s;trations. The clergy met in convocation, propo&s;ed, that a new tran&s;lation of the Bible into the Engli&s;h lan|guage &s;hould be made, and publi&s;hed for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who did not under|&s;tand Latin; and though this motion was vehemently oppo&s;ed by Gardiner, and his party, Cranmer carried his point. The king was petitioned to employ &s;ome capable per&s;ons to tran&s;late the Scriptures; the queen &s;econded the petition, with which Henry complied; and though we know not who the tran&s;lators were, the work was in three years printed at Paris. Henry having obtained all he wi&s;hed from the parliament, di&s;&s;olved that a&s;&s;embly, after it had conti|nued &s;itting &s;ix years, a longer term than parliament had ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;ince the beginning of the Engli&s;h monarchy.</P>

<P>By this time, Sforza duke of Milan being dead without i&s;&s;ue, the dutchy devolved to the emperor, who perceiving Francis bent upon the con|que&s;t of that country, and &s;uppo&s;ing$he would not embark in &s;uch an under|taking, without the promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the king of England, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;unite tho&s;e two potentates. He &s;et on foot a private negotia|tion with the king of France; and propo&s;ed to cede the dutchy of Milan to one of that monarch's &s;ons. At the &s;ame time, hearing of queen Catherine's death, he offered to renew his alliance with Henry, on condition, that the king of Eng|land would be reconciled to the pope through his mediation; that he would furni&s;h him with powerful &s;uccours again&s;t the Turks; and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in de|fending Milan from the attacks of Francis. To the&s;e propo&s;als Henry replied, that the mea&s;ures he had taken again&s;t the pope could not be recalled; that he
<PB N="617" REF="6290">
&s;hould always be ready to act as became a chri&s;tian prince, again&s;t $$$&s;&s;dels: that he was willing to renew the alliance with the emperor, provided it could be done without prejudice to his ally the king of France; and the emperor would own, that he him&s;elf had been the cau&s;e of the rupture. Henry plainly perceived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert.</NOTE> that the de&s;ign of Charles was to detach him from the intere&s;ts of France, with|out any intention to renew the alliance with England. Francis had given him to under&s;tand, that Charles intended to compel him by force of arms to acknowledge the pope's &s;upremacy: for which purpo&s;e he &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Francis; and, on that condition offered to cede the Milane$e. The king of England being thus apprized of the emperor's intentions, conti|nued his negotiation with the prote&s;tants of Germany, in order to find him work in his own dominions. He had already &s;ent Edward Fox as his envoy to the league of Smalcalde; and the members of that a&s;&s;ociation agreed to unite their intere&s;ts with his, on condition, that he would &s;ub&s;cribe the confe&s;|&s;ion of Aug&s;burg, and defend it with all his power in a free council, which &s;hould be held in a place cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e, with their con&s;ent: that if the pope &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon a&s;&s;embling a council, according to his own plea&s;ure, Henry &s;hould join them in their prote&s;tations again&s;t it, and a&s;&s;u$e the title o$ Protector of the league: that he &s;hould never acknowledge the pope's &s;upre|macy, or give the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their enemies: that he &s;hould &s;upply the league with one hundred thou&s;and crowns for their pre&s;ent occa&s;ions, and furni&s;h double that &s;um, in ca&s;e the war &s;hould continue: and they declared, that as &s;oon as he &s;hould have agreed to the&s;e articles, they would &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to England, to bring the treaty to perfection. Henry had no intention to &s;ub|&s;cribe the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burg; but as it was his intere&s;t to protract the ne|gotiation, he gave them to under&s;tand, that the money &s;hould be furni&s;hed as &s;oon as they could agree about the other articles: that he had no objection to the title of Protector; but, could not profe&s;s the faith of Aug&s;burgh, until his con&s;cience could be &s;atisfied of the truth of that confe&s;&s;ion; for which purpo&s;e, he de&s;ired to be better informed of their particular doctrines. They forthwith nominated Sturmius, Draco, Melanchthon, and Bucerus, to confer with Henry and his theologians; but they were forbid to come to any conclu&s;ion that might be prejudicial to the emperor or empire.</P>

<P>This treaty was interrupted by an event equally &s;urprizing in it&s;elf, and intere&s;ting to the favourers of the reformation. Henry began to be cloyed with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Anne Boleyn, who had lately been delivered of a dead male child, to the un&s;peakable di&s;appointment of her hu&s;band, who was &s;uper&s;titious enough to believe this accident was a judgment from heaven. He was about this time captivated with the beauty of Jane Seymour, one of the queen$s la|dies; and his pa&s;&s;ions were &s;o &s;trong and impetuous, that he &s;acrificed every thing to their gratification. The&s;e concurring motives for his alienation from the queen, were &s;trengthened by his wife's deportment, which was too frank and unguarded, to &s;creen her from the imputation of levity and indi&s;cretion. Her ene|mies, in particular the duke of Norfolk, and all tho&s;e who had adhered to the old religion, took advantage of this di&s;po&s;ition, to inflame the king's jea|lou&s;y; the principal fomenter of which was the lady Rochford, &s;i&s;ter-in-law to queen Anne, a woman of an infamous character, who hated her mi&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="618" REF="6300">
with the mo&s;t envenomed rancour. She hinted to the king that his wife carried on a criminal corre&s;pondence with her own brother the lord Rochford: and Henry's mind being prepared for this poi&s;on, by his di&s;gu&s;t for Anne, and his new pa&s;|&s;ion for Jane Seymour, it operated with great violence. The in&s;inuations of the lady Rochford were confirmed by the duke of Norfolk, who enjoyed a great &s;hare of the king's confidence, and was devoted to the popi&s;h religion, which could not flouri&s;h while queen Anne lived to countenance the reforma|tion. The parti&s;ans of the pope therefore con&s;pired her ruin. She was not only accu&s;ed of ince&s;t with her brother Rochford, but likewi&s;e of living in carnal commerce with Henry Norris, groom of the &s;tole, We&s;to$, and Bre$eton, of the king's privy chamber, and Mark Smeton a mu&s;ician. There was no other evidence than an hear&s;ay declaration of one lady Wingfield, who confe&s;&s;ed &s;ome particulars on her death-bed: but, this was &s;ufficient to ruffle &s;uch a mind as that of Henry, who is &s;aid to have ob&s;erved Anne, at a tournament in Greenwich, drop her handkerchief to one of her minions, that he might wipe his face, after having overheated him&s;elf in the exerci&s;e. Be that as it may, the king returned abruptly to Whitehall; Anne was confined to her chamber; and the &s;u&s;pected delinquents being apprehended at the &s;ame time, were com|mitted to the Tower. Anne &s;miled at fir&s;t, thinking the king was in je&s;t; but, when &s;he found it was a very &s;erious affair, &s;he received the &s;acrament in her clo&s;et, and prepared for death. This rever&s;e of fortune affected her in &s;uch a manner, that &s;he was &s;eized with hy&s;teric fits, during which &s;he laughed and wept by turns; and uttered many incon&s;i&s;tencies, according to the nature of that di&s;ea&s;e. Next day, &s;he was conveyed to the Tower, where &s;he fell upon her knees, and appealed to God for the knowledge of her innocency. She in vain, begged to be admitted into the pre&s;ence of the king. The lady Boleyn, her uncle's wife, who had always hated her, was ordered to be in the &s;ame chamber with her; and &s;he made a report of all the incoherent ravings of the afflicted pri&s;oner. She was vi&s;ited by the duke of Norfolk, and &s;ome of the king's council, who endeavoured to draw her into a confe&s;&s;ion, by &s;aying &s;he was accu&s;ed by Norris and Smeton: but, &s;he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in denying the charge; and told the lieutenant of the Tower, &s;he was not more guilty with any man upon earth, than with him&s;elf. She confe&s;&s;ed indeed, that &s;he had, in the gaiety of her heart, made u&s;e of &s;ome indi&s;creet expre&s;&s;ions to Smeton and We&s;ton; and the familiarity of her behaviour had encouraged them to hint a pa&s;&s;ion for her, which, in all probability, afforded her matter of laughter and amu&s;ement; and perhaps, the knowlege of tho&s;e frivolous circum&s;tances in|crea&s;ed the king's jealou&s;y and indignation.</P>

<P>Every per&s;on at court abandoned the unhappy queen in her di&s;tre&s;s, except Cranmer, who, though forbid to come into the king's pre&s;ence, wrote a letter to him in behalf of Anne Boleyn; but, his interce&s;&s;ion had no effect. On the twelfth day of May, Norris, We&s;ton, Brereton, and Smeton, were tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall; when Smeton confe&s;&s;ed he had known the queen carnally three times; but, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been inveigled into this confe&s;&s;ion with a promi&s;e of pardon. The other three pleaded not guilty; but, all four were convicted and condemned to die the death of traitors. On the fifteenth day of the month, the queen, and her brother lord Rochford, were brought to
<PB N="619" REF="6310">
their trial, before the duke of Norfolk, as lord high &s;teward for the occa&s;ion, the duke of Suffolk, the marquis of E$$ter, the earl of Arundel, and five and twenty other peers. The queen appearing at the bar, was charged with criminal conver&s;ation with her brother, and the other four; as al&s;o with hav|ing con&s;pired the king's death. She pleaded not guilty, and an&s;wered di&s;tinctly all the evidence that was produced again&s;t her. As &s;he was not confronted by Smeton, in all probability he had bore fal&s;e witne&s;s; for, all the others denied the charge. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he was convicted and condemned to be burned or beheaded, at the king's plea&s;ure. Her brother likewi&s;e was found guilty, and &s;entenced to be beheaded and quartered. The king, not &s;atisfied with this ven|geance, was de&s;irous of &s;eeing her daughter Elizabeth declared illegitimate. He remembered a report of a previous contract, between lord Piercy, now earl of Northumberland, and Anne Boleyn. The earl being que&s;tioned on this &s;ubject, declared, that no &s;uch contract had ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. He &s;wore to this declara|tion on the &s;acrament, which he wi&s;hed might be his damnation if he did not &s;peak the truth. Neverthele&s;s, Anne was tampered with in &s;uch a manner, either by promi&s;e of life, or threats of executing the &s;entence in all its rigour, that &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &s;uch a precontract, at Lambeth, before the afflicted archbi|&s;hop of Canterbury, and &s;ome other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction; and her marriage with the king was declared null and in&s;ufficient. This &s;entence, however, palpably contradicted the other which had been pronounced again&s;t her; for, if her marriage with Henry was null from the beginning, &s;he could not be ju&s;tly attainted for adultery. In two days after this declaration, &s;he was or|dered to be executed in the green on Tower-Hill; and behaved with great piety, re&s;ignation, and good humour. She is &s;aid to have written a letter to the king, when &s;he fir&s;t under&s;tood the cau&s;e of her confinement. Such an ad|dre&s;s was afterwards found among the papers of Cromwell, drawn up with &s;uch pathetic eloquence and dignity of expre&s;&s;ion, as do great honour to the author; but it is generally &s;u&s;pected to have been written by another hand. On the day that preceded the execution, &s;he de&s;ired the wife of the lieutenant of the Tower to &s;it down in the chair of &s;tate; then kneeling before her, and &s;hedding a flood of tears, &s;he conjured her to go, in her name, and a&s;k pardon of the prince&s;s Mary, for the har&s;hne&s;s with which &s;he had been treated. On the morning of her execution &s;he &s;ent for the lieutenant, that he might be pre&s;ent at her receiv|ing the &s;acrament, and declaring her own innocence. She &s;aid, &s;he was &s;orry to hear her execution was delayed till the afternoon, becau&s;e, before that time, &s;he had expected to be out of her pain. Then &s;he inquired about the dexterity of the executioner; fixed her hands about her neck, ob&s;erving, that &s;he had a very little neck, and laughing heartily. When &s;he was brought to the &s;caffold, in pre&s;ence of the dukes of Suffolk and Richmond, the lord chancellor, the &s;ecre|tary Cromwell, with the lord mayor, aldermen, and &s;heriffs of London, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was come to die, as &s;he had been judged by the law. She prayed God would pre&s;erve the king, who had been always to her a mo&s;t merciful, good, and gentle &s;overeign; and de&s;ired, that people would judge of him with cha|rity. She took leave of all the &s;pectators, de&s;iring they would pray for her; and after &s;he had &s;pent &s;ome time in devotion, her head was &s;evered from her body by the executioner of Calais, who was brought over for his dexterity in
<PB N="620" REF="6320">
performing that operation. Her body was thrown into a common che&s;t, and buried in the Tower-chapel without any ceremony. Her brother, with the other convicts, were beheaded, except Smeton, who was hanged. Norris was promi&s;ed to be forgiven, if he would confe&s;s his guilt, and accu&s;e the queen. But, he rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain, &s;aying, in his con&s;cience he thought her free of the crimes laid to her charge; and would rather die a thou&s;and times, than ruin an innocent per&s;on. Thus fell Anne Boleyn, who&s;e fate has been the &s;ubject of much controver&s;y. She &s;eems to have been a lady of unaffected piety, and a very charitable di&s;po&s;ition; though &s;he had by her education in France, contracted a kind of vivacity that did not &s;uit the manners of an Engli&s;h court. She was naturally volatile, and in &s;ome ca&s;es child|i&s;hly<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> indi&s;creet: &s;o that, in all probability, her heart was better than her under|&s;tanding. She encouraged learning and genius, di&s;tributed great &s;ums in alms; and died a &s;acrifice to the jealou&s;y and intemperance of Henry, $nflamed by the malicious &s;ugge&s;tions of tho&s;e who were enemies to the reformation, which &s;he in a particular manner patronized.</P>

<P>Nothing ju&s;tified Anne Boleyn &s;o much as the conduct of the king, who on the very day that &s;ucceeded her execution, married Jane Seymour; &s;o little regard did he pay to common decorum, and the opinion of his &s;ubjects, over whom he had by this time acquired the mo&s;t de&s;potic authority. The prince&s;s Mary, who had been har&s;hly u&s;ed by her father, on account of her at|tachment to her mother, and her ob&s;tinate refu&s;al to conform to the &s;tatutes which had been lately enacted, was advi&s;ed by her friends to &s;ue for a reconcia|tion with the king at this juncture, when her &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth was declared ille|gitimate. She accordingly wrote a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letter to him, imploring his forgivene&s;s for her former ob&s;tinacy; and promi&s;ing for the future to obey him in all his directions. Henry, before he would readmit her into his favour, in&s;i&s;ted upon her &s;ub&s;cribing the act of &s;upremacy, the renunciation of the bi&s;hop of Rome, and the invalidity of her mother's marriage. Mary u&s;ed all her endeavours to be excu&s;ed from a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of this nature; but &s;eeing the king inflexible, at length complied, and &s;igned the articles, which were contrary to her con&s;cience and per&s;ua&s;ion. Elizabeth being in the fourth year of her age, was deprived of the title of Prince&s;s of Wales, which &s;he had hitherto enjoyed; but Henry carefully &s;uperintended her education, and treated her on all occa&s;ions with parental affection.</P>

<P>A new parliament being a&s;&s;embled on the eighth day of June, enacted a &s;tatute rever&s;ing the former act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, declaring the children of the king's two fir&s;t marriages illegitimate, and excluded for ever from the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to the crown; confirming the condemnation of Anne Boleyn, adjudg|ing the crown, after the king's death, to his i&s;&s;ue by queen Jane, or any other wife he might afterwards e&s;pou&s;e; impowering his maje&s;ty to regulate the manner in which they &s;hould &s;ucceed, either by will, or letters patent under the great &s;eal; and declaring all tho&s;e who &s;hould maintain the validity of his fir&s;t marriages, guilty of high trea&s;on. Pope Paul III. when he was in|formed of Anne's fate, began to conceive hopes of &s;eeing all that had been done again&s;t the papal power in England, revoked; and conferred with Ca&s;ali on this &s;ubject. But, times were greatly altered &s;ince Henry di&s;covered the lea&s;t
<PB N="621" REF="6330">
tendency to an accommodation with the &s;ee of Rome. He had now made him&s;elf ab&s;olute with the clergy as well as laity of his dominions; and he had no mind to part with any portion of his authority. In order to deprive the pope of all chance for retrieving his &s;piritual juri&s;diction in England, this parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act, &s;ubjugating to the penalty of Premunire, all tho&s;e who &s;hould in any manner attempt to re-e&s;tabli&s;h in England the authority of the bi&s;hop of Rome; and all magi&s;trates who &s;hould neglect to put this law in execution. By another &s;tatute, they annulled and aboli&s;hed all di&s;pen&s;ations, exemptions, and privileges, derived from the court of Rome, &s;aving, however, to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the power of confirming what &s;hould be judged for the benefit of the church and people. A third prohibited marriage with any of the king's relations, unle&s;s permi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be previou&s;ly granted. This act was pa&s;&s;ed in con&s;equence of a &s;tolen match between Thomas Howard brother to the duke of Norfolk, and Margaret Douglas the king's niece, who, together with her hu&s;band was confined in the Tower for this pre&s;umption. A fourth law decreed, That all u&s;urpation of parliament upon the king's authority, before he &s;hould have attained the age of four and twenty, might be annulled by letters patent under the great &s;eal of England. In a word, one would imagine, that this parliament had met with no other view than that of extending the royal prero|gative beyond the bounds within which it had been hitherto confined. Nor did the clergy yield to the parliament in this kind of &s;lavi&s;h complai&s;ance. The con|vocation confirmed the &s;entence of divorce between the king and Anne Boleyn, upon the &s;uppo&s;ed precontract &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between that lady and the lord Percy, though this nobleman had denied it upon oath in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner.</P>

<P>The lower hou&s;e of convocation being aver&s;e to Cranmer, Crom|well, and tho&s;e who favoured the reformation, and &s;uppo&s;ing that the per&s;ons whom Anne protected would now be involved in her ruin, &s;ent to the upper hou&s;e &s;ixty-&s;even propo&s;itions, which they deemed heretical. At the &s;ame time, their deputies complained loudly again&s;t innovations in religion, and tho&s;e by whom they were introduced, meaning Cranmer, Cromwel, Shaxton, and Latimer. They had, in their propo&s;itions, in&s;erted many doctrines adopted by the Lutherans, antient Lollards, and Anabapti&s;ts, in&s;inuating, that the reformers profe&s;&s;ed them all equally. But, they were baffled in their expectation: Cran|mer and Cromwell &s;till maintained their places in Henry's favour, and the latter was created king's vicegerent in all ecclefia&s;tical affairs. By Henry's order, he declared to the convocation, That the rites and cremonies of the church &s;hould be reformed by the rules of Scripture; and in a few days, he pre|&s;ented to them a &s;et of articles drawn up by the king him&s;elf, touching the reli|gious doctrines, that the convocation might examine them, and make a faith|ful report of their de$iberations on the &s;ubject. In this debate, the friends and enemies of the reformation declared them&s;elves openly. Cranmer was &s;econded by Goodrick bi&s;hop of Ely, Shaxton of Sali&s;bury, Latimer of Worce&s;ter, Bar|low of St. David's, Fox of Hereford, and Hil&s;ey of Roche&s;ter. At the head of the other party was Lee archbi&s;hop of York, &s;upported by Stoke&s;ley of Lon|don, Ton&s;tal of Durham, Gardiner of Winche&s;ter, Longland of Lincoln, Sher|burn of Chiche&s;ter, Nix of Norwich, and Kite of Carli&s;le. The&s;e were &s;ecret parti&s;ans of the pope, with whom they hoped a reconciliation would one day
<PB N="622" REF="6340">
be eff$$ted. B$t Cranmer and Cromwell had the king's ear, and per&s;uaded him, that the abu&s;es of which they demanded an abolition, directly tended to the &s;uppor$ of papal u&s;urpation. After warm debates, the convocation agreed to certain articles reduced into the form of con&s;titutions, importing$ That the Holy Scripture was the foundation of faith, together with the creed of the Apo|$tles, the Nicene, and that of Athana&s;ius: That bapti&s;m was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, as well as penitence, comprehended in the three acts of contrition, auricular confe&s;&s;ion, and amendment of life: That the real body of Chri&s;t was pre&s;ent in the euchari&s;t: That ju&s;tification was acquired by regeneration, in contrition, faith, and charity: That images ought to be pre&s;erved in churches; but, that the wor&s;hip &s;hould not be payed to the image, but to God him&s;elf: That the &s;aints ought to be honoured, though without believing that they could grant what was in the gift of God alone: That they might neverthele&s;s be invoked, without &s;uper&s;tition, and their fe&s;tivals ob&s;erved; but, that &s;ome of the&s;e might be retrenched by the king's authority: That the cu&s;tomary ceremonies of the church &s;hould be retained; &s;uch as the prie&s;t's ornaments, holy water, con&s;ecrated bread, tapers on Candlemas-day, a&s;hes on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day, palms on Palm|Sunday, pro&s;trations before the cro&s;s on Good-Friday, hallowings of the font, exorci&s;ms, and benedictions: That prayers &s;hould be put up for departed &s;ouls, and alms given for ma&s;&s;es and exequies; but, as the place they were in, and the pains they &s;uffered, had not been a&s;certained by &s;cripture, they ought to be re|mitted wholly to God's mercy: That the ridiculous notions of purgatory<NOTE PLACE="marg">L$.

<P>The&s;e con&s;titutions, corrected in &s;ome places by the king's own hand, were &s;igned by Cromwell, Cranmer, &s;eventeen bi&s;hops, forty abbots or priors, and fifty archdeacons, or deputies from the lower hou&s;e of convocation, among whom were two Italians, namely, Peter Vannes archdeacon of Wor|ce&s;ter, and Polydore Vergil archdeacon of Wells, who wrote an hi&s;tory of Eng|land. Before the convocation broke up, the king imparted to the two hou&s;es, a citation he had received to a council, which the pope, in concert with the em|peror, had a&s;&s;embled at Mantua. The clergy having deliberated upon this &s;ubject, declared, That neither the pope, nor any prince upon earth, had power to convoke a general council without the con&s;ent of all the &s;overeigns in Chri|&s;tendom. Henry, &s;atisfied with this deci&s;ion, publi&s;hed a prote&s;t again&s;t the council of Mantua, declaring he could not look upon that as a free council, which was a&s;&s;embled in a &s;u&s;pected place, where the bi&s;hop of Rome pre&s;ided, and which could not be compo&s;ed of any great number of prelates, during th$ war between France and the emperor.</P>

<P>About this time, Reginald Pole rendered him&s;elf univer&s;ally famous for his ta&s;te and learning. He was de&s;cended from the duke of Clarence, and con&s;equently related to the king, who re&s;olved to rai&s;e him to the highe&s;t dig|nities of the church, be&s;towed upon him the deanery of Exeter, and &s;ent him to fini&s;h his &s;tudies at Paris. He refu&s;ed to concur with Henry's agents in procuring the &s;ub&s;criptions and &s;eals of the French univer&s;ities, in favour of the divorce, which he him&s;elf di&s;approved. He afterwards returned to England, and concurred with the clergy in acknowledging Henry &s;upreme head of the
<PB N="623" REF="6350">
church. Then he made a voyage to Padua, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his wit and eloquence, above all his cotemporaries; and contracted an in|timacy of friend&s;hip with the mo&s;t eminent men and writers of that country. The king under&s;tanding, that he openly condemned him for his &s;eparation from the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, &s;ent to him a book written by doctor Samp&s;on in defence of his proceedings. To this performance Pole wrote an an&s;wer, intituled De unio|ne eccle&s;i$&s;tica, in which he reprehended the king in very &s;evere terms, com|paring him to Nebuchadono$or; and conjuring the emperor to turn his arms again&s;t him, rather than again&s;t any other infidel. Henry, though incen&s;ed at this pre&s;umption, di&s;&s;embled his r$&s;entment, and de$ired he would come over to explain &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in his book, which he did not rightly under&s;tand; but finding him upon his guard, he deprived him of all his dignities, and wreaked his revenge on Pol$'s family and kindred. The pope made up all his lo&s;&s;es, and pre&s;ented him with a cardinal's hat. But he did not ri&s;e above the degree of a deacon; neverthele&s;s, he became more and more attached to the papal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. Reform$</NOTE> intere&s;ts.</P>

<P>The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;mall mona&s;teries, though decreed in the fir$t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the parliament, did not take place till the month of Augu&s;t, when it produced great mu$murs among the people. Many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were di&s;&s;atisfied at &s;eizing the effects of tho&s;e mona&s;teries which their ance&s;tors had founded. They &s;aw them&s;elves deprived of a great convenience which they enjoyed, while they could provide for their younger children in tho&s;e convents; be&s;ides that of being $o&s;pitably entertained by the abbots and priors, when they had occa&s;ion to travel through the country. The poor had &s;till greater rea&s;on to complain, becau&s;e they lived upon the alms daily di&s;tributed by tho&s;e reli|gious hou&s;es; and &s;uper&s;titious people lamented, that the &s;ouls of their $$iends would now continue in purgatory, &s;ince the prayers for the dead were aboli&s;hed by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries. In order to appea&s;e the&s;e di&s;|contents, the king, by the advice of Cromwell, &s;old the lands of the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed mona&s;teries at a low price, on condition that the purcha&s;ers &s;hould main|tain the practice of ho&s;pitality; and he re-e&s;tabli&s;hed one and thirty convents, for the further &s;atisfaction of the people: but even this conde&s;cen&s;ion failed to produce the de&s;ired effect, though it reconciled many lay gentlemen to the mea&s;ures which had been taken. Yet, what the king gained by this expedient, $e lo&s;t by another &s;tep, namely, that of publi&s;hing, in the name of his vicege|$ent, a &s;et of injunctions for regulating the lives and conduct of eccle&s;ia&s;tics. This was the fir&s;t pure act of the king's &s;upremacy; for, in all the preceding $$an&s;actions, he had the concurrence of the convocation. The clergy now looked upon them&s;elves as &s;laves to a vicegerent. The great advantage they $&s;ed to make by their images, relics, and pilgrimages, was taken away by the&s;e injunctions. They were loaded with &s;evere impo&s;itions; a fifth part of their $$venues was deducted for repairs; a tenth for exhibitioners, whom they were obliged to maintain; and a fortieth for charity: their labour was increa&s;ed, and they were re&s;trained to a life of &s;everity. The &s;ecular clergy thus hampered, $oncurred with the regulars, in diffu&s;ing a &s;pirit of di&s;content among the peo|ple; and they were &s;ecretly encouraged by the great abbots, who trembled at the di&s;&s;olution of the le&s;&s;er mona&s;teries, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that their hou&s;es would meet with the &s;ame fa$e.</P>

<P>At $$$gth, a $lame of rebel$$on was kindled, and broke forth in Lin|co$&s;h$$e, w$er$ above twenty thou&s;and per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled, under the conduct of doctor M$kre$, prior of Barlins, d$$gui&s;ed like a cobler. They &s;wore to be true to God, the king, and the commonwealth; and &s;ent a petition to court, com|plaining, That many religious hou&s;es were &s;uppr$&s;&s;ed by the advice of &s;ome evil coun&s;ellors: That they laboured under &s;ome hard&s;hips in their &s;ecular concerns, from certain late acts of parliament: That &s;ome bi&s;hops had &s;ubverted the faith: That they apprehended the jewels and plate of their churches would be taken away. They intreated the king to a&s;&s;emble the nobility of the nation, and con&s;ult them touching the&s;e grievances; and they concluded with acknow|ledging him as &s;upreme head of the church, to whom the tithes and fir&s;t fruits of all livings ju&s;tly belonged. The king publi&s;hed a very &s;evere an&s;wer to this remon&s;trance, following the fir&s;t dictates of his pa&s;&s;ionate temper and imperious di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;ent Charles Brandon duke of Suffolk again&s;t them, at the head of &s;ome forces. Though his an&s;wer &s;erved only to inflame the multitude, &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction entered into a private negotiation with the duke, a&s;&s;uring him, they had joined the revolters for no other purpo&s;e but to bring them by degrees to a &s;en&s;e of their duty; and that, if the king would indulge them with an amne&s;ty, they would &s;oon di&s;per&s;e without blood&s;hed. The duke wrote to the king on this &s;ubject; and Henry being informed of another in|&s;urrection in York&s;hire, publi&s;hed an amne&s;ty in favour of the revolters of Lin|coln&s;hire, who di&s;banded accordingly, though &s;ome of the number joined the rebe$lion in the county of York, which was much more dangerous than the other, becau&s;e the eff$ct of premeditation, and encouraged by many per&s;ons of con|&s;equence. It was headed by one Robert A&s;ke, who had attempted to engage William lord Dacres of Gille&s;land, and &s;everal other gentlemen in the con&s;pi|racy, which was cal$ed a Pilgrimage of grace. The in&s;urgents were preceded by prie&s;ts with crucifixes in their hands; and the pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t was painted on their banners. They compelled all the fr$$ho$ders in the neighbourhood either to join them, or fly the country. They re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the monks who had been di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.

<P>The earl of Shrew&s;bury armed his va&s;&s;als to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s; and was created king's lieutenant again&s;t the rebels; while the duke of Suf|folk was ordered to remain in Lincoln&s;hire to hinder any fre&s;h commotion in that county. Several noblemen were commi&s;&s;ioned to levy forces, and the king him&s;elf began to a&s;&s;emble an army to be commanded by the duke of Norfolk. During the&s;e preparations, A&s;ke reduced the ca&s;tle of Pontefract, into which the archbi&s;hop of York and the lord Darcy had thrown them&s;elves. He af$erwards made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Hull and York, and obliged all the nobility of tho&s;e parts to join his army. Lanca&s;ter, the herald, being &s;ent to this de|magog$e with a proclamation, found him $$tting in &s;tate between the arch|bi&s;hop and Darcy, who had taken his oath upon comp$l&s;ion; importing, That they &s;hould engage in this Pilgrimage of grace for the love of God, and pre&s;er|vation of the king's per&s;on and i&s;&s;ue, the purification of the nobility, the ex|pul&s;ion of ba&s;e blood and evil coun&s;ellors, the re&s;titution of the church, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of heretics. A&s;ke, being informed of the contents of the pro|$$amation, would no$ &s;uffer it to be read in public; but granted a &s;afe-conduct
<PB N="625" REF="6370">
to the herald, in con&s;ideration of his office. He required Henry Clifford, earl of Cumberland, to &s;urrender his ca&s;tle of Skipton, and join his forces; but that nobleman refu&s;ed to comply with his demand, although he was for&s;aken by five hundred gentlemen, whom he retained at his own expence. Then the rebels be&s;ieged Sir Ralph Ewers in the ca&s;tle of Scarborough, which he gal|lantly defended; though he and his garri&s;on ta&s;ted no other food for twenty|four days but &s;imple bread and water. Henry, &s;eeing this affair become every day more and more &s;erious, &s;ent the duke of Norfolk and the marquis of Exeter, with &s;ome troops levied in ha&s;te, to join the earl of Shrew&s;bury; but, even after the junction, they were not able to face the enemy, who advanced again&s;t them to the number of thirty thou&s;and men; and, in all probability, would have attacked them at Donca&s;ter, had not the river been &s;o &s;welled by heavy rains that they could not ford it, and the bridge &s;o &s;trongly fortified, that they had no pro&s;pect of carrying it by a&s;&s;ault.</P>

<P>The duke of Norfolk, who favoured them in his heart, was not &s;orry to find him&s;elf unable to attack them: he maintained a private intel|ligence with &s;ome of their chiefs, and, by his advice, they pre&s;ented $n humble petition to the king, which the duke engaged to deliver, and &s;upport with his intere&s;t; but, in the mean time, he in&s;i&s;ted upon a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, to which they agreed. Perceiving however that Henry, in&s;tead of an&s;wering their petition, endeavoured to &s;ow divi&s;ion among them by his emi&s;&s;aries, they re&s;olved to attack his army without further delay; but were once more pre|vented by the rain, which rendered the river impa&s;&s;able. Then the king pro|po&s;ed they &s;hould &s;end three hundred deputies to meet his commi&s;&s;ioners at Donca&s;ter; and the duke of Norfolk returning to that place, gave them to under&s;tand he had procured an amne&s;ty in their favour, from which however ten were excepted; &s;ix of the&s;e by name, and the other four to be pitched upon by his maje&s;ty. This indulgence they rejected, but &s;ent their three hundred deputies to Do$ca&s;ter; and as they knew the king's intention was to gain time by protracting the negotiation, and that he hoped &s;uch a number of deputies would not agree among them&s;elves, they furni&s;hed them with in&s;tructions in writing, containing certain propo&s;als, from which they were not $t liberty to re$ede. They demanded a general pardon, without exception: That the king &s;hould convoke a parliament at York, and e&s;tabli&s;h a court of ju&s;tice in the North: That the inhabitants of tho&s;e parts &s;hould not be obliged to pro&s;ecute their law-&s;uits in London: That certain laws, lately made to the grievance of th$ people, &s;hould be repealed: That the prince&s;s Mary &s;hould be declared legitim$te, and the pope's authority re-e&s;tabli&s;hed on the antient footing: That the mona&s;teri$s which had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;hould be re&s;tored to their former condition: That the Lutherans and all innovators in religion &s;hould be &s;everely puni&s;hed: That Thomas Cromwell and the chancellor &s;hould be ex|pelled from the crown and parliament; and, That Lee and Leighton, the com|mi&s;&s;ioners for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries, &s;hould be impri&s;oned, and obliged to give account of their violence and extortion.</P>

<P>While the&s;e events engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the Engli&s;h monarch, a new rupture happe$ed between the emperor and the king of France. Charles, on his return from Africa, continued to amu&s;e Francis with a negotiation; in|&s;inuating that he would cede the dutchy of Milan in favour of his third &s;on, the duke of A$gouleme, on certain conditions: but, as he wavered in his pro|po&s;als, Francis ordered his general to &s;u&s;pend all ho&s;tilities in Piedmont, and $ent the cardi$al of Lorrain, as his amba&s;&s;ador, to demand a categorical an&s;wer of the emperor, who had repaired to Rome. There, in a public con&s;i&s;tory, $e declaimed again&s;t the king of France as the &s;ole author of all the wars which had afflicted Europe $ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and ob&s;erved, that, in&s;tead of &s;hedding &s;o much innocent blood, he would have acted more like a chri&s;tian prince in deciding the quarrel with Charles by a &s;word and poignard, in &s;ome boat or i&s;land. Next day, the French amba&s;&s;ador de&s;ired to know if his intention was to challenge his ma&s;ter to &s;ingle combat; but he re|plied in the negative, &s;aying, his meaning was that the French king ought to have accepted the expedient when it was fir&s;t propo&s;ed. The cardinal &s;oon perceived that Charles had no intention to be&s;tow the dutchy of Milan on a prince of the hou&s;e of France; and wrote to Francis that he had nothing to expect but war from the emperor. He had already projected the &s;cheme of an inva&s;ion again&s;t France, and began to a&s;&s;emble three armies; one to act in Piedmont under his own command, another in Picardy, and a third in Cham|pagne. Francis, being appri&s;ed of his de&s;ign, recalled the greate&s;t part of his troops from P$edmont, after having left &s;trong garri&s;ons in Turin and the other places he had conquered. The French forces had no &s;ooner quitted Piedmont than Charles inve&s;ted Turin, and, during the &s;iege, entered Pro|vence at the head of a numerous army; while Francis, h$ving provided for the defence of Mar&s;eilles, ordered two camps to be fortified, one at Cavaillon, under the command of the marechal de Montmorency, and the other at Valence, where he was made acquainted with the death of his elde&s;t &s;on the dauphin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$ B$$$ay. Mezera$. Buchanan.</NOTE> who had been poi&s;oned by Montecuculli. The emperor, having reduced Aix, undertook the &s;iege of Mar&s;eilles, which however he was obliged to rai&s;e; and, for want of provi&s;ion, retreated in great di&s;order towards Genoa, where he embarked for Spain. In the mean time, the count de Na&s;&s;au fell into Picardy with thirty thou&s;and men, took Gui&s;e by a&s;&s;ault, and be&s;ieged Peronne, which was relieved by the duke of Gui&s;e. Francis, in his return to Paris, was met by James V. king of Scotland, who demanded his daughter Madelaine in<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$.

<P>England was &s;till agitated by the remains of the la&s;t &s;torm in the North.

to per&s;ons of all ranks and conditions. A&s;ke was ordered to repair to court, where he at fir&s;t met with a civil reception; but the lord Darcy was &s;ent to the Tower as &s;oon as he arrived at London. The di&s;contents among the people of the North &s;oon broke out again in open rebellion: two gentle|men, called Mu&s;grave and Tilby, putting them&s;elves at the head of eight thou&s;and malecontents, made an attempt upon Carli&s;le; from whence they were repul&s;ed, and afterwards entirely routed by the duke of Norfolk. Mu&s;|grave e&s;caped; but Tilby, with &s;eventy of his followers, were taken and hanged upon the walls of Carli&s;le. Another body, commanded by Sir Francis Bigot, and one Hullam, endeavoured to &s;urpri&s;e Hull, but were al&s;o taken and ex|ecuted. The&s;e enterprizes exa&s;perated the ferocious temper of the king to &s;uch a degree, that he commanded A&s;ke and the lord Darcy to be put to death, on pretence of a con&s;piracy, for which likewi&s;e the lord Hu&s;&s;ey and many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction &s;uffered, notwith&s;tanding the amne&s;ty which had been granted. The lord Darcy, during his impri&s;onment, accu&s;ed the duke of Norfolk of having favoured the rebels at Donca&s;ter. The duke denied the charge, which he imputed to malice, and offered to clear him&s;elf by &s;ingle combat; but the king, whether convinced of his innocence, or unwilling to deal &s;everely with &s;uch a powerful nobleman, declared him&s;elf &s;atisfied with his conduct. By this time Henry's di&s;po&s;ition was &s;o &s;avaged that he became terrible to his &s;ubjects: not &s;atisfied with the blood he had &s;hed, he ordered Thomas Fitzgerald, &s;on to the earl of Kildare, and five of his uncles, who had &s;urrendered to lord Grey on promi&s;e of pardon, and been long detained in pri&s;on, to be hanged at Ty|burn; but the younger &s;on of Kildare e&s;caped by being packed up in a bundle of cloaths, and was conveyed to Ireland, from whence he &s;ailed to France; and, finding him&s;elf un&s;afe in that kingdom, took refuge with cardinal Pole, who was his kin&s;man, and received him with great ho&s;pitality. The king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>On the twelfth day of October, the queen was delivered at Hamp|ton-court of a prince, who was chri&s;tened by the name of Edward; and, tho' the mother died in two days after the birth, Henry was overjoyed at this event, which not only gratified his vanity, but removed all doubts about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In &s;ix days after this child was born, the king created him prince of Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polyd. Vergil.</NOTE> duke of Cornwall, and earl of Che&s;ter. At the &s;ame time, the queen's brother, Sir Edward Seymour, lately made lord Beauchamp, was created earl of Hert|ford; Sir William Fitzwilliams honoured with the title of earl of Southamp|ton; in the month of March, Sir William Paulet, trea&s;urer of the hou&s;hold, was created lord St. John; and Sir John Ru&s;&s;el, comptroller, dignified with the title of lord Ru&s;&s;el. In the cour&s;e of this year, James V, of Scotland, in his return from France with his young queen, touching on the coa&s;t of England, had been &s;ollicited by a great number of the natives to take up arms again&s;t the tyrant Henry; but he declined embracing their propo&s;als, and arrived at Edinburgh, where his queen &s;oon died of an hectic fever: then he &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;adors to France to demand in marriage Mary, &s;i&s;ter of the duke of Gui&s;e, and cardinal of Lorrain, whom he actually e&s;pou&s;ed in the &s;equel.

the&s;e tran&s;actions, the prote&s;tants in Germany were &s;till per&s;ecuted by the in|trigues of the emperor and his brother Ferdinand king of the Romans. The counci$, convoked at Mantua, was a &s;tep directly contrary to the promi&s;e Charles had made of a&s;&s;embling one in Germany: and the Lutherans complained of this breach of promi&s;e, refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ions of a council in which the pope pre&s;ided. The emperor, who&s;e &s;cheme was to cru&s;h them by force of arms$ endeavoured to amu&s;e them with delu&s;ive an&s;wers, until he &s;hould be in a condition to declare his de&s;igns.

Mean while the pope, po&s;tponing the opening of the council from May to November, directed the cardinals Contarini, Sadolet, Polus, and Bembo, to enquire into &s;uch abu&s;es of the church as required re|formation.

<P>Henry had been &s;o provoked by the ill offices of the monks, who &s;tirred up the late in&s;urrections, that he re&s;olved to &s;uppre&s;s all the mona&s;|teries in England, without exception; his re&s;olution being in this particular in|fluenced by his intere&s;t as well as re&s;entment, for he already gra&s;ped in idea the rents and riches of all the convents and religious hou&s;es. To pave the way for this total di&s;&s;olution, he ordered another minute vi&s;itation, that he might be able to remove the prejudices of the people, by divulging the enormities committed in tho&s;e receptacles of vice; and &s;uch &s;cenes were brought to light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> as could not fail to excite the &s;urprize and abhorrence of the public. A great number of monks, and even &s;ome abbots and priors, were convicted of holding corre&s;pondence with the rebels, and executed as traitors. Many compromi&s;ed for their lives, by re&s;igning their hou&s;es into the king's hands; &s;ome gave up their mona&s;teries from motives of con&s;cience; others to avoid puni&s;hment and di&s;grace; but all of them received pen&s;ions for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Had nothing appeared again&s;t tho&s;e religious foundations but the vice and profligacy of the abbots, abbe&s;&s;es, nuns, and friars, the people would have naturally thought that the in&s;titution, which was good in it&s;elf, ought not to have been aboli&s;hed, for the corruption of the members, who might have been changed and re|formed. But the king cho&s;e a more effectual expedient, in opening the eyes of the people with re&s;pect to the pretended &s;anctity of relics, images, and all the other trumpery of &s;uper&s;tition. The vi&s;itors were in&s;tructed to examine, and, if po&s;&s;ible, di&s;cover the arts by which the minds of the vulgar were infatuated; and then the whole machinery of monki&s;h impo&s;ture was detected: not but that the &s;$andalous vices practi&s;ed in convents were likewi&s;e pub|li&s;hed, in order to undeceive the nation. The impurities of Sodom and Go|morrah are &s;aid to have been exceeded in Battel-abbey, Chri&s;t-church in Can|terbury, and &s;everal other convents. They found innumerable in&s;tances of whoredom, adultery, onani&s;m, and other unnatural lu&s;ts and bea&s;tly practices; with arts to prevent conception, and procure abortion among the nuns who were debauched. With re&s;pect to monki&s;h idolatry and deceit, Reading &s;eems to have been the repo&s;itory of the nation. There the vi&s;iters found an angel with one wing, that brought over the head of the &s;pear that pierced the &s;ide of
<PB N="629" REF="6410">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with &s;uch an inventory of other relics as filled up four &s;heets of paper. At St. Edmund&s;bury they &s;eized &s;ome of the coals that roa&s;ted St. Laurence, the parings of St. Edmund's toes, the penknife and boots of St. Thomas Becket, a great quantity of the real cro&s;s, and certain relics to prevent rain and the generation of weeds among corn. The hou&s;e of We&s;tacre had pawned a finger of St. Andrew for forty pounds; but this the vi&s;itors did not think proper to redeem. There was a crucifix at Boxely in Kent, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appeliation of the Rood of Grace, which had been long in reputation, becau&s;e it had been &s;een to bend and rai&s;e it&s;elf, &s;hake the head, hands, and feet, roll the eyes, and move the lips. This puppet, being brought to Lon|don, was broke in pieces in &s;ight of the people at St. Paul's cro&s;s, where, with their own eyes they &s;aw the &s;prings by which it had been actuated. At Hales in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire the monks had carried on a profitable traffic with the blood of Chri&s;t in a chry&s;tal vial: &s;ometimes this blood appeared, and &s;ometimes was invi&s;ible, according to the faith or holine&s;s of the &s;pectator. This relic was no other than the blood of a duck renewed weekly, and put in a vial; one &s;ide of which was thin and tran&s;parent, and the other thick and impervious to the rays of light: it was placed near the altar, &s;o as to be turned occa&s;ionally by tho&s;e &s;piritual jugglers, according to the bounty of the pilgrim, or votary, by whom it was adored. The vi&s;itor for Wales &s;ent up to London a huge image of wood called Dawel Gatheren, to which incredible numbers of pil|grims re&s;orted, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it had power to deliver &s;ouls from hell. This idol &s;erved for fuel to burn friar Forre&s;t in Smithfield; and another famous image of our Lady at Worce&s;ter, was found to be the &s;tatue of a bi&s;hop, di&s;gui&s;ed with veils and other ornaments. Another, in the bi&s;hopric of St. David's, with a taper which was &s;aid to have continued burning nine years, with many rich &s;hrines belonging to our Lady of Wal&s;ingham, of Ip&s;wich, and of I&s;lington, were committed to the flames by order of the vicegerent. That of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury excelled all the others in magnificence, and opinion of &s;anctity: va&s;t numbers of pilgrims re&s;orted to it from all quar|ters, and even preferred it to tho&s;e of Chri&s;t and the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin; for, in one year, the offerings at the altar of Chri&s;t and his mother did not exceed four pounds; and tho&s;e at the &s;hrine of St. Thomas amounted to nine hundred and fifty-four. Lewis VII. of France had vi&s;ited and pre&s;ented at it a jewel that was deemed the riche&s;t in Europe. Not contented with one fe&s;tival in the year, they kept the anniver&s;ary of his tran&s;lation as an holiday; and, in every fiftieth year, there was a jubilee for fifteen days, during which, indul|gences were granted to all that came to vi&s;it his &s;hrine. The &s;kull, which they wor&s;hipped as the &s;aint's, had never belonged to him; for the true &s;kull was found lying in the grave with the re&s;t of his bones. The &s;hrine was now broken down and carried away, together with the gold that adorned it, which filled two large che&s;ts that eight &s;trong men could hardly carry out of the church. The king ordered his bones to be burned, his name expunged from the calendar, and the office for his fe&s;tival to be &s;truck out of the breviary. A convocation meeting took into con&s;ideration the articles which had been pub|li&s;hed in the preceding year, and given great offence; and, at the conclu&s;ion of their &s;e&s;&s;ion, they printed an explanation of the Creed, the &s;even Sacraments,

<P>When Henry's proceedings were known at Rome, that city was filled with &s;atires and libels again&s;t his per&s;on and conduct. He was branded as the mo&s;t infamous and &s;acrilegious tyrant that ever exi&s;ted. They accu&s;ed him of violating the a&s;hes of the dead, which even the heathens had revered; with waging war again&s;t heaven and the &s;aints; with &s;acrificing con&s;ecrated prie&s;ts to his &s;avage cruelty and revenge; with pilfering all that the devotion<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE> of former ages had dedicated to God and his &s;ervice. They compared him to Be$$hazar, Nero, Domitian, Diocle&s;ian, and e&s;pecially to Julian the apo&s;tate, whom he re&s;embled in his learning and apo&s;tacy, though he fell &s;hort of him in his morals. Henry had &s;pies at Rome, who gave him to under&s;tand that the intelligence from England was generally &s;ent to cardinal Pole. That pre|late's pen being &s;till recognized in &s;ome of the keene&s;t &s;atires, Henry conceived &s;uch an implacable re&s;entment again&s;t him as he had never harboured again&s;t any other per&s;on; and wreaked his revenge on the cardinal's family. Pope Paul III. now publi&s;hed the bull again&s;t Henry, which he had hitherto &s;u&s;|pended; he endeavoured to in&s;tigate all chri&s;tian princes again&s;t him, and even offered the kingdom of England to James king of Scotland.</P>

About the &s;ame time, he ordered the clergy to read the Lord's prayer, the confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and the ten Commandments, in Engli&s;h.

<P>Although this ordinance was a mortal blow to the old religion, the king was now &s;o ab&s;olute, that no per&s;on would venture to expre&s;s the lea&s;t di&s;approbation. Gardiner bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, had by this time returned from France: he dete&s;ted the reformation in his heart, was &s;u&s;pected of having reconciled him&s;elf privately to the pope; and of carrying on a corre&s;pondence with the emperor. Neverthele&s;s, he di&s;&s;embled in &s;uch a manner, that the king$ who de&s;pi&s;ed his intellects, had no doubt of his fidelity; and even be|&s;towed upon him &s;ome degree of his confidence, on account of his complai|&s;ance and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. As he &s;eemed to enter into all the king's mea&s;ures with the utmo&s;t zeal of obedience, Henry willingly li&s;tened to him in his &s;ugge&s;tions again&s;t the Sacramentarians, or tho&s;e who denied the real pre&s;ence in the Eu|chari&s;t, e&s;pecially as this was a doctrine to which the king him&s;elf was firmly attached. Gardiner imagined, that the zeal of tho&s;e who favoured the refor|mation, when per&s;ecuted, would irritate the temper of the king, who was impa|tient of contradiction; and that he would cru&s;h them during the prevalence of his indignation. The bi&s;hop carried his point &s;o far as to rai&s;e a per&s;ecution again&s;t the Sacramentarians, one of whom called John Nichol&s;on, alias Lambert, &s;uffered death as an heretic. He had been mini&s;ter of the Engli&s;h company at
<PB N="631" REF="6430">
Antwerp, from which office he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on account of his belief. He afterwards kept a &s;chool at London; and hearing doctor Taylor preach upon the real pre&s;ence in the Sacrament, pre&s;ented him with his rea&s;ons for contra|dicting that doctrine. The paper was carried to Cranme$, who was then of Luther's opinion in that article, and endeavoured to convince Lambert of his error. But, this la&s;t appealed to the king, who undertook to con&s;ute him in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, before the bi&s;hops, nobility, and judges of the realm. A $word$ di&s;pute was accordingly maintained by Henry, &s;econded by all his prelates, who extolled his learning with the mo&s;t extravagant encomiums. Lambert was brow-beaten, confounded, and convicted of here&s;y: but, he cho&s;e to re$$gn his life, rather than part with his opinion; and was burned at Smithfield, with horrid circum&s;tances of barbarity. The adulation of the learned, in&s;pired the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> king with &s;uch an opinion of his own ability, as proved equally fatal to both parties; for, he now re&s;olved to puni&s;h rigorou&s;ly all tho&s;e who &s;hould pre|&s;ume to differ from him in point of opinion, without making any di&s;tinction between papi&s;t and reformer. Under&s;tanding that the emperor had concluded a truce for ten years with the king of France, he endeavour$d to profit by his negotiation with the League of Smalcalde; and de&s;ired them to &s;end over th$o|logicians to confer with him concerning the points in which he differed from tho&s;e of their communion. They di&s;patched amba&s;&s;adors to England for that purpo&s;e; but, as they in&s;i&s;ted upon his embracing the con&s;e&s;&s;ion of Aug$burg, and would not give up one tittle of their belief, touching the commu$$on in one &s;pecies, private ma&s;&s;es, auricular confe&s;&s;ion, and the celibacy of pri$$ts, $ll which articles they renounced, he was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s them without coming to any re&s;olution. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE></P>

Cranmer &s;till kept his footing in the king's good graces, by dint of per&s;onal merit; but, Cromwell is &s;aid to have minded his own intere&s;t, rather than that of religion: Shaxton, bi&s;hop of S$li$$ur$, was proud and litigious: Latimer, of Worce&s;ter, was weak and &s;imple: Barlow, of St. A&s;aph, &s;hallow and imprudent: and the other preachers of the new reli|gion were generally enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who &s;uffered them&s;elves to be hurried away by an intemperate zeal, which payed no re&s;pect to the temper and character of Henry; and con&s;equently never failed to m$ur his indignation. About this time they flattered them&s;elves they had gained an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength in the pro|motion of Bonner to the &s;ee of Hereford, vacant by the death of Edward $ox: but, they were grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed; for that prelate, notwith&s;tanding the obligations he had been laid under by the chiefs of the reformation, became one of their mo&s;t rancorous enemies. At the death of Stoke&s;ley, he was afterwards advanced to the &s;ee of London.

He afterwards di&s;cour&s;ed with him upon that law; and allowed him to explain the rea&s;ons that induced him to oppo&s;e it. He even ordered him to commit the&s;e rea&s;ons to writing, though &s;uch a &s;tep was rendered capital by the &s;tatute. Cranmer accordingly drew up a memorial on the &s;ubject, which being lo&s;t by accident, fell into the hands of a per&s;on who would have delivered it to the king$ had not he been prevented by Cromwell. Shaxton bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, and Latimer of Worce&s;ter, who had likewi&s;e oppo&s;ed the articles, were not &s;o favourably dealt with. In order to appea&s;e the king's re&s;entment which they had incurred, they thought proper to re&s;ign their bi&s;hoprics; but, they had no &s;ooner made this &s;acrifice, than they were accu&s;ed of harbouring &s;entiments contrary to the &s;tatute, and com|mitted pri&s;oners to the Tower of London. When the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament broke up, the king appointed commi&s;&s;ioners devoted to the catholic religion, and &s;ent them through the kingdom, to di&s;cover all tho&s;e who condemned the &s;ix articles, that they might be puni&s;hed with all the rigour of the law. In London alone, above five hundred per&s;ons were impri&s;oned on this account, after having been inveigled into confe&s;&s;ion by the commi&s;&s;ioners; but, the chancellor repre&s;ented the pernicious con&s;equences of &s;uch a per&s;ecution, in &s;uch pathetic terms to the king, that he pardoned all tho&s;e who had been ap|prehended; and put a &s;top for the pre&s;ent to all further enquiry.

<P>Henry fore&s;eeing a rupture between the emperor and the pro|te&s;tants of Germany, &s;ent new amba&s;&s;adors to the league of Smalcalde, to en|courage them in their oppo&s;ition to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and to promi&s;e he<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> would engage in their a&s;&s;ociation. They perceived his drift was only to amu&s;e them, and intimidate the emperor by means of a negotiation with his enemies; and they frankly gave him to under&s;tand, that they would unite with him on no other terms, than that of his embracing the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burg. They &s;aid, they had heard with great mortification of his per&s;ecuting their brethren in his kingdom; and in particular, complained of the law of the &s;ix articles, the inju&s;tice of which Melanchthon explained to him in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letter. Henry was &s;hocked at the freedom of their expo&s;tulation; and Gardiner, by flattering his vanity, added fuel to his re&s;entment. It was not in his power, however, to prevent an incident which in a great mea&s;ure forwarded the refor|mation. Though the king was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;upremacy, he could not be &s;atisfied until the people &s;hould be convinced of his right to that prehemi|nence; and Cranmer knowing his anxiety on this &s;ubject, told him, that nothing would contribute to their undeception, more than a free u&s;e of the Scriptures, by which they would &s;ee that the pope's authority was not founded on the word of God. Henry no &s;ooner &s;ignified his approbation of this propo&s;al, than Gardiner employed all his art and rhetoric, to prevent &s;uch a fatal blow to the catholic religion. The two prelates di&s;puted on the &s;ubject in pre&s;ence of the king, who decided in favour of Cranmer, telling the other, he was but a novice, who ought not to enter the li&s;ts with &s;uch an experienced general. The truth<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$. P$b.</NOTE> is, he thought his own intere&s;t coincided with Cranmer's propo&s;itions. He granted letters patent to Cromwell as his vicegerent, importing, That his &s;ub|jects &s;hould have free and liberal u&s;e of the Bible tran&s;lated into the Engli&s;h tongue; and that for five years there &s;hould be no impre&s;&s;ion of the Bible, or any part of it, but only by &s;uch as he &s;hould appoint. Towards the end of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$rnet.</NOTE> this year, the inhabitants of Ghent mutinied, and offered to acknowledge the French king as their &s;overeign, if he would protect them from the re&s;ent|ment of the emperor. But Francis rejected their propo&s;al, which he commu|nicated to Charles, who had by this time amu&s;ed him &s;o effectually with the promi&s;e of re&s;toring to him the dutchy of Milan, that he ventured to pa&s;s through his dominions on the faith of a &s;imple &s;afe-conduct, and even vi&s;ited him at Paris, where he was received with the &s;ame honours which the French payed to their own &s;overeign.</P>

Tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners being approved by the parliament, re|ceived orders to begin their inquiry without delay: and in the mean time, the king created Cromwell earl of E&s;&s;ex. In this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the order of the knights of St. John of Jeru&s;alem was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, on pretence of their dependence on the pope and the emperor; and all their effects in England and Ireland confi&s;cated for the u&s;e of the king, who allotted three thou&s;and pounds yearly for their maintenance.</P>

<P>Immediately after the prorogation of this parliament, the fall of Cromwell was decreed. He was hated and envied as an up&s;tart by the nobility in general, and dete&s;ted by all the Roman catholics, as the inveterate enemy of their religion. The king had expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;&s;atisfaction at his conduct in eff$ct|ing this di&s;agreeable marriage; and the duke of Norfolk and Gardiner did not fail to inflame his di&s;content. They repre&s;ented, that the kingdom was filled with malecontents on the &s;core of religion; that they looked upon the vicege|rent as author of all tho&s;e mea&s;ures which they di&s;approved; that Cromwell had deceived his maje&s;ty in the affair of his marriage; that he had rai&s;ed an immen&s;e fortune by oppre&s;&s;ion; and that the king, by &s;acrificing him to the re&s;entment of the public, would intirely conciliate the affections of his people. This la&s;t argument had great weight with Henry, who was really incen&s;ed in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbert.</NOTE> his heart again&s;t Cromwell; and thought he had no further u&s;e for his &s;ervice in treating with the league of Smalcalde, as he had by this time determined to make peace with the emperor, who he fore&s;aw would break with Francis about the dutchy of Milan. On the&s;e con&s;iderations, he gave up Cromwell to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> revenge of his enemies. Upon the meeting of the parliament, the duke of Norfolk, at the council-table, arre&s;ted the earl of E&s;&s;ex, in the king's name, for high trea&s;on; and he was immediately &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower. His di&s;|grace
<PB N="636" REF="6480">
was no &s;ooner known, than all his friends for&s;ook him, except Cranmer, who wrote &s;uch a letter to Henry in his behalf, as no other man in the kingdom would have pre&s;umed to indite; but it produced no effect in favour of the un|fortunate Cromwell, who, without being heard in his own defence, was by a bill of attainder found guilty of divers here&s;ies and trea&s;ons; and condemned to &s;uffer the pains of death, as the king &s;hould think proper to direct.</P>

<P>The fall of Cromwell was immediately followed by the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the marriage between Henry and his new wife: a di&s;&s;olution on which he had &s;et his heart, not only on account of his aver&s;ion to Anne of Cleves, but al&s;o becau&s;e he was by this time enamoured of Catherine Howard, daugh|ter to lord Edmund, brother to the pre&s;ent duke of Norfolk. The whole hou&s;e of lords, with a committee of the commons, waited upon the king with an addre&s;s, de$$$ing he would order trial to be made of the validity of his mar|riage; and his maje&s;ty complying with their reque&s;t, a commi&s;&s;ion was granted for trying it in convocation. They forthwith proceeded to the examination of witne&s;&s;es, including the depo&s;itions of the king and members of the privy coun|cil; a declaration under the hand of Cromwell, &s;igned in the Tower; the evidence of the earl of Southampton; the lord Ru&s;&s;el, at that time admiral; Sir Anthony Brown, Sir Anthony Denny, doctor Chambers and Butts, the queen's phy&s;ici|ans, and &s;ome ladies of the chamber. The &s;ub&s;tance of the whole amounted to the&s;e particulars: That there had been a precontract between the queen and the marquis of Lorraine: that it did not appear whether the&s;e &s;pou&s;als were made by the parties them&s;elves, or in the words of the pre&s;ent ten&s;e: that the king having married her again&s;t his will, had not given a pure, inward, and complete con&s;ent: and, that he had never con&s;ummated the marriage. The&s;e frivolous objections were &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted upon by the popi&s;h party, and Cran|mer being influenced by the fear of his life, yielded his a&s;&s;ent; &s;o that the con|vocation unanimou&s;ly judged the marriage null; and on the ninth day of July &s;entence was given for its di&s;&s;olution. On the tenth of July, this &s;entence was notified to both hou&s;es, by whom it was approved; then the king &s;ent the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Southampton, and the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, to intimate the tran&s;action to Anne of Cleves, who expre&s;&s;ed no &s;ort of di&s;&s;atisfaction at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

They told her the king would by letters patent declare her his adopted &s;i&s;ter, give her precedency before all the ladies in England but his own wife and daughter; that an e&s;tate of three thou&s;and pounds a-year would be allotted for her maintenance; and, that &s;he might either live in England or return to her own country. She cho&s;e to live in England, and was prevailed upon to write a letter to her brother, approving what had been done.

<P>This important affair being terminated, the parliament, by a new act, mitigated the penalties in one of the &s;ix articles of the &s;tatute of blood, relating to eccle&s;ia&s;tics who &s;hould violate their vows of cha&s;tity. The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the king to examine the doctrines of religion, hav|ing drawn up a long report on that &s;ubject, a &s;tatute was enacted, implying, That their report &s;hould have the force of a law, as well as every thing that the king &s;hould ordain on the &s;ubject of religion. Thus, they ve&s;ted in the king,
<PB N="637" REF="6490">
that infallibility of which they had deprived the pope. This complai&s;ant par|liament gave away the liberties of the nation in every re&s;pect: they fir&s;t made the king ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of their lives and fortunes, and now they &s;ub|jected their con&s;ciences to his will and plea&s;ure; but this la&s;t act they clogged with a contradiction, in the&s;e words, Provided nothing &s;hould be done contrary to the laws of the realm. They pa&s;&s;ed another act, ordaining that a marriage, already con&s;ummated, &s;hould not be di&s;&s;olved on account of a precontract, or any other hindrances than tho&s;e of the divine law. This &s;tatute, which &s;o palpably contradicted the king's own conduct in the c$&s;e$ of his wives, was intended as a previous &s;tep towards the legitimation of the prince&s;s Eli|zabeth, and his marriage with Catherine Howard. The convocation of the clergy in the province of Canterbury granted one fifth of their revenues, payable in five years to the king, as a mark of their gratitude for the pains he had taken to deliver the Engli&s;h church from papal tyranny. Notwith&s;tanding this ample gratification, the king demanded a &s;ub&s;idy from parliament; and though the members had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to behave towards him with the mo&s;t &s;ervile complai&s;ance, they could not help expre&s;&s;ing their &s;ur|prize at this demand, con&s;idering the tranquillity of the times, and the great &s;ums the king had derived from the di&s;&s;olution of the mo$$&s;teri$$. Warm de|bates were maintained on this &s;ubject in the hou&s;e of commons: but the par|ti&s;ans of the court repre&s;enting the great expence the king had incurred by putting the &s;ea-coa&s;t in a po&s;ture of defence, the majority acquie&s;ced in this rea&s;on, and voted a very con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy.</P>

Cromwell's fortitude &s;eemed to for&s;ake him when he was arre&s;ted: being required to &s;end to the king a full account of his tran&s;actions in the marriage, he concluded his letter in the mo&s;t abject manner. He &s;ub&s;cribed him&s;elf a mo&s;t woeful pri&s;oner, ready to take the death, when it &s;hould plea&s;e God and his maje&s;ty; yet (he &s;aid) the frail fle&s;h incited him continually to call to his grace for mercy, and grace for his offences. He dated the letter at the Tower, this Wedne&s;day the la&s;t of June, with the heavy heart and tremb|ling hand of your highne&s;s's mo&s;t heavy and mo&s;t mi&s;erable pri&s;oner, and poor &s;lave, Thomas Cromwell; and below the &s;ub&s;cription he wrote <Q>&startq;Mo&s;t gra|cious prince, I cry for mercy, mercy, mercy.&endq;</Q> He afterwards wrote &s;uch a pathetic letter to the king, that Henry &s;eemed affected with it, and cau&s;ed it to be read thrice over in his hearing; but the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions were effaced by the beauty of Catherine Howard, and the in&s;inuations of the duke of Norfolk and the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; &s;o that a warrant was granted for his being be|headed on Tower-hill. When he was brought to the &s;caffold, his regard for his &s;on hindered him from expatiating upon his own innocence. He thanked God for bringing him to that death for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; he acknowledged his offences again&s;t God and his prince, who had rai&s;ed him from a low de|gree; confe&s;&s;ed he had been &s;educed, but that now he died in the catholic faith.

He bore his pro&s;perity with great moderation; was particularly grateful to tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his nece&s;&s;ities; and &s;uch was his integrity, that his enemies could not fix any<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>On the eighth day of Augu&s;t the king declared his marriage with Catherine Howard, whom he had &s;ome time ago privately e&s;pou&s;ed; and as this lady was wholly devoted to her uncle the duke of Norfolk, and Gar|diner bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; the parti&s;ans of the pope began to flatter them|&s;elves with the pro&s;pect of a change in matters of religion. They marked out Cranmer as a &s;acrifice. Already they began to revile him openly; and a member of parliament publicly declared in the hou&s;e, that he was chief and protector of the innovators. The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to draw up an expo&s;ition of the chri&s;tian doctrine having fini&s;hed their work, it was publi&s;hed by the king's order; and then the world perceived, that, in&s;tead of advancing, it checked the progre&s;s of the reformation. Other commi&s;&s;ioners, employed to reform the mi&s;&s;als, made hardly any other alteration than that of ra&s;ing out the pope's name, when it occurred; and every thing &s;eemed to progno&s;ticate the fall of Cranmer, though his enemies proceeded very gradually in the work of his de|&s;truction, well knowing that he was per&s;onally beloved by his &s;overeign.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in England, the good under&s;tanding, &s;o lately e&s;tabli&s;hed between the emperor and Francis, &s;uffered a &s;udden inter|ruption. While Charles tarried at Paris, he po&s;itively promi&s;ed to be&s;tow the dutchy of Milan on the duke of Orleans; but po&s;tponed the ce&s;&s;ion until he &s;hould arrive in the Low Countries, that he might not &s;eem to have acted on compul&s;ion, in which ca&s;e the ce&s;&s;ion would be deemed void: after his departure from France, however, he &s;till found new pretences for delaying the execution of his promi&s;e; and in the mean time &s;ubdued and cha&s;ti&s;ed the inhabitants of Ghent, who had revolted. Francis, finding that he had no in|tention to part with the Milane&s;e, was &s;o incen&s;ed at his di&s;appointment that he di&s;graced his chancellor Poyet, and the con&s;table Montmorency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$ Bell$y.</NOTE> who had advi&s;ed him to tru&s;t to the word of the emperor.

<P>A new flame was now on the point of breaking out in Europe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Charles endeavoured to intimidate the Porte from a commi&s;&s;ion of ho&s;tilities, by affecting an intimate union with the kings of France and England: he promi&s;ed to erect the Low Countries into a kingdom, and be|&s;tow it upon the duke of Orleans. Francis, who perceived his drift, and knew his in&s;incerity, appointed amba&s;&s;adors for the courts of Con&s;tantinople and Venice, in order to di&s;abu&s;e tho&s;e powers; but as they &s;ailed down the Po in a boat, they were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the direction of the marquis of Gua&s;t, governor of Milan. The French king complained loudly of this outrage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> for which however he received no &s;atisfaction from the emperor; and this was a fre&s;h &s;ource of animo&s;ity. Charles, at this time, had convoked a diet at Ra|ti&s;bon; and, as this was no &s;ea&s;on for di&s;turbing the prote&s;tants, he granted them another re&s;pite called The Interim, that they might the more chearfully furni&s;h him with &s;uccours again&s;t the infidels. The king of the Romans had already inve&s;ted Buda, which he hoped to reduce before the Turks &s;hould come to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but, the garri&s;on making a gallant defence, the Ottoman army came to their relief, and obtained a &s;ignal victory over the Germans. Never|thele&s;s, the emperor, in&s;tead of marching into Hungary, great part of which was now in the hands of Solyman, repaired to Italy, and embarked at Porto Venere with an army of five and twenty thou&s;and men, de&s;tined to act again&s;t Barbaro&s;&s;a, who had &s;eized the &s;overeignty of Algiers.

<P>Mean while, Henry king of England, under&s;tanding that his nephew James, the Scotti&s;h monarch, was entirely directed by the council of &s;ome churchmen devoted to the &s;ee of Rome, began to be afraid, that he might be brought over to the intere&s;ts of the emperor, and at his in&s;tigation di&s;turb the Engli&s;h dominions. He earne&s;tly de&s;ired to per&s;uade James to follow his example in renouncing the papal authority, and was vain enough to believe his own eloquence was &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e. He therefore &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to demand an interview at York, and James agreed to the pro|po&s;als$ but the Scotti&s;h clergy, fearing the con&s;equences of this interview, found means to di&s;&s;uade their &s;overeign from going to York; and, after Henry had waited for him &s;ome days in that city, he received letters of excu&s;e, at which he was exceedingly incen&s;ed. The chagrin he felt at this di&s;appointment was a meer trifle in compari&s;on of what now awaited him on his return to

London. He had, upon all occa&s;ions, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t perfect &s;atisfaction in his pre&s;ent marriage. He was &s;o captivated with the queen's accompli&s;hments, that when he received the &s;acrament on All Saint's day, he thanked God for his $word$ and de$$$ed his confe&s;&s;or to join with him in the &s;ame thank$giving. This joy however was of very &s;hort duration: while he was at York, a man of the name of La&s;&s;els had waited upon Cranmer at London; and, from the information of his &s;i&s;ter, who had been &s;ervant to the dutche&s;s dowager of Norfolk, g$$e him a very &s;urpri&s;ing account of the queen's incontinence. He &s;aid &s;he had led a very lewd life before her marriage, carried on a &s;canda|lous corre&s;pondence with two men called Deirham and Mannock; and that $he continued to indulge her&s;elf in the &s;ame criminal plea&s;ure &s;ince &s;he was rai$ed to her pre&s;ent greatne&s;s. Cranmer was equally &s;urpri&s;ed and embarra&s;&s;ed at this intelligence, which he communicated to the chancellor and &s;ome other members of the privy council, who advi&s;ed him to make the king acquainted with the whole affair, at his return to London. The archbi&s;hop knew what a $$$que he ran, by intermeddling in &s;uch a delicate &s;ubject with a prince of Henry's di&s;po&s;ition: but he likewi&s;e knew the danger of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;uch in|formation. He therefore re&s;olved to commit what he had heard to writing, in the form of a memorial, which he delivered into the king's own hand, de|&s;iring his maje&s;ty to read it in private. Henry believed at fir&s;t it was a piece of calumny, and determined to puni&s;h the authors with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. With this view he ordered the keeper of the privy &s;eal to examine La&s;&s;els, who repeated the &s;ame &s;tory, and even produced his &s;i&s;ter, by whom it was con|firmed. Then Deirham and Mannock being arre&s;ted, confe&s;&s;ed that they had carnally known the queen; that one of her principal confidents in tho&s;e &s;tolen debauches was the lady Rochford, who had accu&s;ed her hu&s;band of ince&s;t with Anne Boleyn; that this lady had introduced into the queen's bed-chamber one Culpeper, who had &s;tayed with her from eleven at night till four o'clock in the morning. As the queen had taken Deirham into her &s;ervice, it was pre&s;umed the intended to continue in the &s;ame cour&s;e of life.

<P>While the king of France attacked the emperor in five places at once, without any great &s;ucce&s;s, Henry re&s;olved to take vengeance on the king of Scotland for the affront he had &s;u&s;tained at his hands in the affair of the interview; to compel the Scotti&s;h nation to relinqui&s;h their connexions with the enemies of England; and to oblige James to renounce the papal au|thority. As a pretext was wanting for his committing ho&s;tilities, he pretended that the truce had been violated; that certain Engli&s;h rebels had been enter|tained in Scotland; and he publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, in which he claimed that right of &s;uperiority over the kingdom of Scotland which we have enlarged upon in the reign of the fir&s;t Edward. James, being apprized of his uncle's intention, began to put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence, and &s;ent two amba&s;|&s;adors to London with propo&s;als of accommodation. The&s;e were detained at the Engli&s;h court, under various pretences, until Henry was ready to take the field, and even then they were obliged to attend the army which was &s;ent into
<PB N="642" REF="6540">
their country under the command of the duke of Norfolk. Two other Scotti&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, meeting that nobleman on his march, were detained as pri&s;oners until he arrived at Berwick. Mean while king James, hearing of his approach, d$tached a body of ten thou&s;and men to the frontiers, under the command of Gordon, who could not, however, prevent the duke's entering Scotland, where he ravag$d the country bordering on the Tweed, and then retreated to Berwick on account of the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on. James, in the mean time, a&s;&s;embled an army of fifteen thou&s;and men, with a train of artillery, appointed the lord Maxwell general, and re&s;olved to invade England on the we&s;tern &s;ide by Sol|way fri$h.

Another &s;ubject of chagrin is &s;aid to have al&s;o contri|buted to his death. The duke of Norfolk having &s;ent an herald about the ran|&s;om of the pri&s;oners, he was murdered by one Leech, a Lincoln&s;hire rebel, who was afterwards delivered up to the king of England.

Neverthele&s;s, they were treated with more ho&s;pitality than they had rea&s;on to expect; and di&s;tributed among the principal noblemen, who entertained them at their hou&s;es. When the tidings of Mary's birth, and her father's death arrived at the &s;ame time, Henry, thought this was a favoura|ble conjuncture for effecting an union of the two kingdoms, by a match between Edward prince of Wales, and the young queen of Scotland.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1543.</NOTE> Scotland was left in great confu&s;ion by the untimely death of its mo|narch. The next heir to the crown after young Mary, was James Hamilton earl of Arran, a man of a moderate genius, and quiet di&s;po&s;ition. He favoured the reformation, but was altogether unfit for the management of public affairs. On account of his bias towards the new religion, he was hated by the clergy, and the queen dowager, who was &s;i&s;ter to the duke of Gui&s;e, and blindly devoted to the papal authority. Her bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition were encouraged by Da|vid Beaton archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, a prie&s;t of a violent temper, who had per&s;ecuted the reformers with the utmo&s;t rancour; and obtained a cardinal's $$t, as a recompence for his zealous attachment to the &s;ee of Rome. This pre|$ate,
<PB N="643" REF="6550">
&s;eeing all the nobility of the kingdom at variance among them&s;elves, $e|&s;olved to make his advantage of this civil confu&s;ion; and produced a forged will of the late king, by which he him&s;elf was appointed regent or viceroy dur|ing the minority of Mary. He was &s;upported in his preten&s;ions to thi$ officeby all the credit and influence of the queen dowager. On the other hand, the friends of the reformation incited the earl of Arran to claim the regency, by virtue of his proximity of blood; and thus animated, he determined to demand it at the meeting of the next parliament, after he &s;hould have detected the Forgery of the will produced by Beaton. His party gained a con&s;iderable $cce&s;&s;ion by the arrival of A$chibald Douglas earl of Angus, and his brother William, who now returned from England, after an exile of fifteen years. When the parliament a&s;&s;embled, the will was examined, the fraud di&s;covered, and the earl of Arran appointed regent of the kingdom. Henry &s;ent Sir Ralph Sadler as his amba&s;|&s;ador to this a&s;&s;embly, to propo&s;e the match between prince Edward and their young queen. Notwith&s;tanding the cardinal's oppo&s;ition, the propo&s;al was embraced; the parliament appointed the two Dougla&s;es, and &s;ome other per&s;on$, as amba&s;&s;adors, to negotiate the treaty, which was concluded at London on the fir&s;t day of July, importing, That the young queen &s;hould be educated in Scot|land until &s;he &s;hould have attained the tenth year of her age: and, that the Scotti&s;h parliament &s;hould &s;end three ho&s;tages of di&s;tinction to re&s;ide in Eng|land, until the marriage &s;hould be accompli&s;hed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures, however, were defeated by the intrigues of Beaton, who, by means of a large contribution from the clergy, bribed and caballed with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that the people in general exclaimed again&s;t the treaty with Eng|land, as an union that would end in their own &s;lavery. The Engli&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador was in&s;ulted by the populace; the regent had no longer power to protect him, much le&s;s to &s;end the ho&s;tages &s;tipulated in the treaty. Then he &s;ummoned the pri&s;oners to return to England, according to their engagement; but, none of them would tru&s;t them&s;elves in the power of Henry, except Gilbert Ken|nedy earl of Ca&s;&s;ils, who prized his honour above his liberty, and returned to London, where Henry compared him to Attilius Regulus, and was &s;o plea&s;ed with his punctilious behaviour, that he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him without ran&s;om, after having be&s;towed upon him extraordinary marks of favour and e&s;teem; at the &s;ame time, he re&s;olved to declare war again&s;t Scotland. Mean while, the queen and the cardinal, in order to &s;trengthen their party again&s;t the intere&s;t of the Hamiltons, iuvited Matthew Stuart earl of Lennox to return from France, where he had re&s;ided for &s;ome time, promi&s;ing that he &s;hould marry the queen dowager; and, in ca&s;e of the infant Mary's death, &s;ucceed to the crown in preference to Arran, who&s;e father's marriage was liable to &s;ome objections. Allured by this bait, the earl of Lennox returned to Scotland, and levied a body of men, in order to re&s;cue the young queen from the hands of the regent, who propo&s;ed an accommodation, which was accordingly effected. The earl of Arran tired of oppo&s;ing the queen dowager and cardinal, re&s;olved $word$ unite him&s;elf with them fo$ the future; but, before they would receive him into their confidence, he was obliged to abjure the doctrines of the reformation, which he had hitherto profe&s;&s;ed. When they gained this important point, they had no further oc|ca&s;ion for Lennox, whom the queen dowager amu&s;ed with hopes of the mar|riage, while &s;he, by letters, intreated the king of France to recal him to that

Before the&s;e letters arrived in France, however, the French king had remitted a con&s;iderable &s;um to Lennox, in order to be di&s;tributed among his friends in Scotland; for this was the method by which he and Henry &s;upported factions in that country. Lennox, perceiving that the queen had no intention to fulfil her promi&s;e, divided part of the money among his own friends; and the car|dinal, who expected to have received the large&s;t portion, was &s;o exa&s;perated at his di&s;appointment, that he in&s;tigated the regent to rai&s;e a body of forces, and &s;urpri&s;e Gla&s;gow, to which Lennox had retired with his acqui&s;ition. This nobleman &s;u&s;pecting their drift, levied ten thou&s;and men for his own defence, and fortified Gla&s;gow and Dunbarton, while the regent proceeded very &s;lowly in his endeadvours to a&s;&s;emble an army. At length a peace was concluded between the two parties, and the chiefs were externally reconciled at Edinburgh, from whence they repaired together to Stirling; but Lennox receiving intimation of a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, quitted the court abruptly, and retired to his fortre&s;s of Dunbarton, where he fir&s;t learned the ill offices the queen dowager had done him with the king of France.</P>

He had, by this time, $orgot the di&s;grace of his aunt Catherine, or at lea&s;t, the &s;ugge&s;tions of his in|tere&s;t and ambition &s;tifled tho&s;e of his re&s;entment. Bonn$r bi&s;hop of London was &s;ent to Spain to manage the negotiation, in which one con&s;iderable ob&s;tacle occurred. The emperor in&s;i&s;ted upon Henry's acknowledging his daughter Mary as $is legitimate offspring; and the king of England ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to give him that &s;atisfaction. Yet he promi&s;ed to give her a rank in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, according to the power ve&s;ted in him by parliament; and, at la&s;t, Charles was contented with this verbal promi&s;e. The treaty which was concluded at London, contained in &s;ub&s;tance, That the emperor and the king of England &s;hould &s;end amba&s;&s;adors, to te$l the king of France, that as the Turks had in|vaded Chri&s;tendom at his &s;ollicitation, they expected he would break off all communication with tho&s;e Infideis, and repair the damage they had done in Europe: That he &s;hould de&s;i&s;t from all ho&s;tilities again&s;t the emperor, re&s;tore the places he had taken with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Mu&s;&s;ulmen, and pay the debts $e owed to the long of England. The contracting parties moreover agreed,

That neither peace no$ truce &s;hould be made with France, but on condition that the French king &s;hould di&s;charge his obligations to Henry; and, as a &s;ecu|rity for the future payment of the pen&s;ion, put into his hands the counties of Ponthieu, Boulogne, Montreuil, Ardres, and Terouenne; and re&s;tore the dutchy of Burgu$dy to the emperor: That &s;hould Francis refu&s;e to comply<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act.

<P>In the month of July, Henry once more changed his condition, by marrying a &s;ixth wife, in the per&s;on of Catherine Parr, the late lord Latimer's widow, a woman of di&s;cretion, already pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life, who ma|naged his temper with prudence and &s;ucce&s;s. She favoured the reformation in her heart: but, &s;he knew how dangerous it was to contradict the king in reli|gious matters; and therefore &s;he would not venture to interpo&s;e in behalf of three prote&s;tants that were burned at Wind&s;or, immediately after her marriage, at the &s;ollicitation of Gardiner bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. That prelate, and the other enemies of the reformation, not contented with the de&s;truction of tho&s;e, and other &s;uch innocent enthu&s;ia&s;ts, eagerly a&s;pired at the ruin of Cranmer, whom they con&s;idered as the head and protector of all tho&s;e innovators in reli|gion; and on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the king would bear no contradicton in ar|ticles of faith, they ventured to in&s;inuate to his maje&s;ty, that here&s;y would never be weeded out of the land, while its protector was &s;uffered to flouri&s;h. Henry, at fir&s;t, made no an&s;wer to the&s;e in&s;inuations, becau&s;e he gue&s;&s;ed their aim, and &s;uppo&s;ed his &s;ilence would di&s;courage them from renewing their attempts; but Gardiner, and the duke of Norfolk, with other parti&s;ans of popery, repeated the &s;ame &s;train &s;o often, that his curio&s;ity was intere&s;ted. He &s;eemed to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to their remon&s;trances, and even received &s;ome articles of accu&s;ation again&s;t Cranmer, &s;ub&s;cribed with the names of his accu&s;ers; for, the duke and the bi&s;hop being unwilling to appear as parties in the affair, had prevailed upon the canons of Canterbury, and &s;ome ju&s;tices of the peace in Kent, to prefer tho&s;e articles again&s;t the archbi&s;hop. Henry thus informed, took an opportu|nity, while he diverted him&s;elf on the river Thames, to &s;top at Lambeth, where Cranmer re&s;ided, and that prelate coming down to receive his maje&s;ty, was or|dered to come into the barge, where the king conver&s;ed with him in private. He expre&s;&s;ed his unea&s;ine&s;s at the growth of here&s;y, which he &s;aid he was re|&s;olved to extirpate, by puni&s;hing its fautors and protectors with the utmo&s;t ri|gour of the law. Cranmer applauded his re&s;olution; but intreated him, in the name of God, to examine well what was branded with the name of here&s;y, le&s;t, in puni&s;hing &s;uppo&s;ed heretics, he &s;hould wreak his vengeance on the faithful &s;ervants of the Almighty: then the king told him, that he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the chief protector of the heretics, and put into his hand the articles of accu|&s;ation; which the archbi&s;hop having peru&s;ed with great compo&s;ure, he fell upon his knees, and de&s;ired he might be brought to trial. He frankly owned, that with re&s;pect to the law of the &s;ix articles, which he had &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, his &s;entiments &s;till remained unaltered, though he had never &s;poke, nor acted again&s;t it in any &s;hape, &s;ince it acquired the force of a law. When
<PB N="646" REF="6580">
the king a&s;ked if he was really married, he an&s;wered in the affirmative; but declared, that as &s;oon as the law of the &s;ix articles had pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, he &s;ent his wife to Germany. Henry was &s;o &s;truck with the candour and integrity of this truly primitive bi&s;hop, that he a&s;&s;ured him of his protection, made him acquainted with the &s;cheme that was formed for his de&s;truction$ di&s;clo&s;ed to him the names of his accu&s;ers; and commanded him to pro&s;ecute them for defamation. Cranmer begged to be excu&s;ed; but the king in&s;i&s;ted upon his proceeding, and de&s;ired him to nominate the judges. The archbi|&s;hop, however, proceeded &s;o coldly in this pro&s;ecution, that Henry &s;eeing it was again&s;t his inclination, allowed him to drop it, though he could not help admiring his genero&s;ity. Such was the &s;implicity of Cranmer's heart, that he could not di&s;tingui&s;h his own enemies; and &s;uch his benevolence, that he could not with-hold his a&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e whom he knew to be his enemies. One day, he went to court to &s;ollicit in favour of a per&s;on who had craved his in|tere&s;t. Henry a&s;ked him, if he thought that per&s;on was his friend, and he re|plying in the affirmative, <Q>&startq;No (&s;aid the king) he is your inveterate foe, and I order you to call him knave when next you &s;ee him.&endq;</Q> Cranmer begged<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> he might be excu&s;ed from u&s;ing &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as did not become the mouth of a bi&s;hop. Henry &s;aid he would be obeyed; but, Cranmer &s;ound means to avoid the meeting; and the king continued to admire and love him for his chri&s;tian meekne&s;s and integrity. On the twenty-third day of Decem|ber, lord Parr, the queen's brother, was created earl of E&s;&s;ex; and her uncle was honoured with the title of baron Parr, and the office of queen's cham|ber$ain. The war &s;till continued between the emperor and the king of France. In the beginning of the campaign Francis obtained &s;ome advantages in Flan|ders, which he lo&s;t again when Charles arrived in the Low Countries with an army of Spaniards. Barbaro&s;&s;a the Turki&s;h admiral having joined the count d'Enghien at Mar&s;eilles with one hundred and ten gallies, the united fleets &s;teered towards Nice, which they attacked, and reduced the town; but, the ca&s;tle was defended &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they were obliged to abandon the en|terprize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> and Barbaro&s;&s;a returned in the &s;pring to Turkey.</P>

<P>All the a&s;&s;i&s;tance Charles received from the king of England dur|ing this campaign, was a body of &s;ix thou&s;and troops &s;ent over under Sir John Wallop, who joined the emperor's army in the Low Countries; but the two allies formed the project of entering France by Picardy and Champagne in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1554.</NOTE> en&s;uing &s;ummer. Mean while, that nothing might interrupt the good under|&s;tanding re-e&s;tabli&s;hed between them, Henry re&s;olved to keep his word with regard to the prince&s;s Mary; and the parliament being a&s;&s;embled in January, pa&s;&s;ed an act, regulating the different degrees of tho&s;e who, after the king's death, might pretend to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Prince Edward and his po&s;terity held the fir&s;t rank in this act of &s;ettlement: the next place was occupied by the male i&s;&s;ue which the king might have either by the reigning queen, or any future lawful wife: the third rank was allotted to the prince&s;s Mary and her i&s;&s;ue: and the fourth to Elizabeth and her children: but, to convince the&s;e prince&s;&s;es, that they owed this di&s;tinction intirely to their father's favour, this act &s;ubjected them to any conditions he &s;hould plea&s;e to impo&s;e, which, &s;hould they reject, they were deprived of all right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: be&s;ides, in ca&s;e of their di&s;obeying their father, or dying without i&s;&s;ue, the king was impowered
<PB N="647" REF="6590">
to regulate the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion according to his own plea&s;ure, either by will or letters patent. By a clau&s;e of this &s;tatute, all the &s;ubjects were obliged to take a new oath, renouncing the authority of the bi&s;hop of Rome, on pain of incurring heavy penalties, which were likewi&s;e decreed again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould violate any articles contained in this act of parliament. In this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the title of King of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and Supreme head of the Anglicane and Iri&s;h churches, was in&s;eparably annexed to the crown of England. Another act deprived the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts of the power to oppre&s;s the &s;ubjects on pretence of here&s;y, by decreeing, That no per&s;on could be judged on the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles, before the accu&s;ation &s;hould be approved by a jury of twelve men, &s;worn before the king's commi&s;|&s;ioners, to be appointed for that purpo&s;e. Then the parliament pa&s;&s;ed a &s;trange<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld. Herbert</NOTE> bill, by which the king was relea&s;ed from all the debts he owed to indivi|duals; and la&s;tly, they granted him a power to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners for examining and altering the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titutions. About this period, the lord Audley dying, was &s;ucceeded in the office of chancellor by Thomas Wriothe&s;ley, a great &s;tickler for the old religion.</P>

<P>The king of France under&s;tanding, that the emperor and king of England intended to attack him in the center of his dominions with an army of one hundred thou&s;and men, recalled twelve thou&s;and men from Italy, where they had &s;erved under the young count D'Enghien, who had obtained a &s;ignal victory over the marquis de Gua&s;t at Ceri&s;oles, and would in all proba|bility have &s;ubdued the Milaneze, had not he been thus di&s;abled from pur&s;uing his good fortune. Henry, mean while, continued to make preparations for this mighty inva&s;ion; and re&s;olved to render them &s;ub&s;ervient to two purpo&s;es. His de&s;ign was to humble Scotland before he &s;hould embark for the continent. He had no intention to make conque&s;ts, but only to compel the Scots, by the terror of his arms, to con&s;ent to the marriage which he had already propo&s;ed. That people was in no condition to maintain a war; but cardinal Beaton, who now governed them under the name of the regent, was a prelate of &s;uch vio|lence and ob&s;tinacy, that he cho&s;e rather to expo&s;e his country to de&s;truction, than con&s;ent to a match that would ruin his own fortune. Henry therefore re|&s;olved to &s;end into Scotland part of the forces itended for France; and the care of the expedition was intru&s;ted to the earl of Hartford, and John Dudley $aron of Li&s;le, the admiral of England. The army embarked at Newca&s;tle, and landing at Leith, marched directly to Edinburgh, which they pillaged and burned, without meeting the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. They did not attack the ca&s;tle, but returning to Leith, reduced that town to a&s;hes; and reimbarking, re|turned to Berwick. Henry had occa&s;ion for his troops in the execution of his great project again&s;t France; and he thought he had done enough to intimidate the Scots into his mea&s;ures. But, on this occa&s;ion he deviated from the dictates of &s;ound policy. In&s;tead of intimidating the Scots into compliance, he rendered him&s;elf odious to the whole nation by this cruel de&s;cent. He ought either to have conquered the whole kingdom, while it was in his power, or to have conci|liated the affection of the natives by the lenity and genero&s;ity of his conduct, while they were at his mercy. He might have made his own terms when his troops were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Edinburgh, before he had driven the Scots to de|&s;pair, by reducing their capital to a&s;hes.</P>

<P>Mean while, the earl of Lennox finding him&s;elf abandoned by the French king, whom the queen dowager and her relations of the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e had prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, began to &s;ound the di&s;po&s;ition of Henry to|wards him&s;elf and his intimate friend the earl of Glencairn. The king of England lending a willing ear to his propo&s;als, Gl$ncairn, and the bi&s;hop of Caithne&s;s, bro|ther to Lennox, with two other per&s;ons, repaired to Carli&s;le, where they treated with Henry$s commi&s;&s;ioners; and engaged in the following conventions: That they would cau&s;e the true word of God to be preached in their territories: That, to the be&s;t of their power they would hinder their young queen from being removed out of Scotland, unle&s;s &s;he could be put into the hands of the king of England: That they would employ all their intere&s;t in obtaining for Henry the admini&s;tration and protector&s;hip of Scotland: and, That the bi&s;hop of Ca$thne&s;s, and Hugh Cunningham, &s;hould remain as ho&s;tages in England. Henry promi&s;ed on his part, that his army &s;hould not &s;po$$ their lands: That the regency of the kingdom &s;hould be be&s;towed upon Lennox, on con|dition, that he &s;hould do nothing without Henry's advice: That this noble|man &s;hould receive out of the crown-revenues a rea&s;onable proportion for the maintenance of that dignity: That, in ca&s;e of Mary's death, the king of Eng|land &s;hould &s;upport his preten&s;ions to the crown again&s;t tho&s;e of the earl of Ar|ran: That Glen$$$rn &s;hould have a pen&s;ion of one thou&s;and crowns: and, That Henry's niece the lady Margaret Douglas &s;hould be married to the earl of Lennox. This treaty being &s;igned at Carli&s;le, the earl repaired to London, where he confirmed the agreement, and promi&s;ed to deliver the ca&s;tle of Dun|barton, and the I$le of Bute, into the hands of the Engli&s;h; Henry engaging to furni$h him with five hundred men, and a pen&s;ion for him&s;elf, and Striveling governor of Dunbarton ca&s;tle. The&s;e conventions being ratified, Lennox failed thither with &s;ix hundred Engli&s;h &s;oldiers in thirteen ve&s;&s;els, but Strive|ling preferring his duty to his friend&s;hip for the earl, refu&s;ed to admit them into the fortre&s;s. Thus di&s;appointed, they ravaged the i&s;les of Arran and Bute, plundered K$ntyre and &s;ome other villages; and &s;ailed back to Bri&s;tol, while Henry was abroad on his expedition. While Le$nox was employed in this $ru$$le&s;s attempt, a body of Engli&s;h made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Jedburgh, Ke$$o, and Coldingham, which la&s;t place they garri&s;oned before they retired to thei$ own country. The cardinal and regent rai&s;ed about eight thou&s;and men to retake this town; but, the former hearing, that a detachment was on its march from Berwick to the relief of the place, was &s;eized with &s;uch con&s;ter|nation, that he $etook him&s;elf immediately to flight; the greate&s;t part of the army in&s;tantly di&s;banded, and the art$llery would have been abandoned to the fir$t comer, had not the earl of Angus carried it off by means of his own va&s;|&s;als. After this di&s;per&s;ion of the Scotti&s;h forces, parties of the Engli&s;h ra|vaged the Mer&s;e, Teviotdale, and Lothian, and even compelled the inhabitants<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> to take the oath of allegiance to the king of England.</P>

<P>By this time, the emperor having g$anted a toleration to the prote&s;tants, who purcha&s;ed this indulgence with a good &s;ub&s;idy, he &s;ettled a new regulation touching the en&s;uing campaign, with his ally the king of Eng|land; and the&s;e two powers agreed to bring above an hundred thou&s;and men into the field, &s;o as to join in the neighbourhood of Paris.

Luxemburg, fell into the Barrois, where he took Commercy and Ligny; then he entered Champagne, and inve&s;ted St. Didier about the beginning of July. Henry under&s;tanding, that the Imperial army was in motion, ap|pointed his queen regent of the realm in his ab&s;ence, with a proper council, embarked his forces, amounting to thirty thou&s;and; which landing at Calais about Mid&s;ummer, the duke of Norfolk with a detachment joined the count de Bures, who commanded about twelve thou&s;and Imperiali&s;ts; and the&s;e to|gether undertook the &s;iege of Montreuil. If Charles and Henry had not amu&s;ed them&s;elves in be&s;ieging towns, but marched directly to Paris, accord|ing to the plan of operations, Francis would have been reduced to extremity; for, his whole army did not exceed forty thou&s;and men. Henry arriving at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Bellay.</NOTE> Calais, and under&s;tanding that the emperor was employed in the &s;iege of St. Didier, in&s;tead of advancing towards the heart of France, &s;at down before Boulogne, which &s;urrendered on the twenty-&s;ixth day of July. From that period the two allies began to di&s;tru&s;t one another. They were both guilty of having infringed the treaty. The emperor, by indirect methods, propo&s;ed terms of peace to Francis, and Henry openly granted &s;afe-conduct to the French amba&s;|&s;ado$s, who came to treat with him on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Mean while, Charles having at la&s;t made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of St. Didier, &s;ummoned Henry to march towards Paris, according to their convention; and the king of England excu&s;ed him&s;elf until he &s;hould have reduced Boulogne. The emperor had already ad|vanced as far as Chateau-Thierry, and filled all Paris with con&s;ternation; but, concluding, from Henry's an&s;wer, that the projected operations of the cam|paign would not be put in execution, he renewed his &s;ecret negotiation with Francis, which had been &s;u&s;pended; and concluded a &s;eparate peace, which was &s;igned at Crepy on the nineteenth day of September, without Henry's be|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ld.

<P>Having thus delivered him&s;elf from the burthen of the war, he recalled his troops under the command of count de Bure; &s;o that Henry was obliged to abandon the &s;iege of Montre$il, and retire to Calais with all expedi|tion, as the army was greatly dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s, and a draught made for the garri&s;on of Boulogne; and the dauphin advanced again&s;t him at the head of a numerous army. That prince, who did not reach the Boullonois till after the retreat of the Engli&s;h, attempted to &s;urpri&s;e the city by the breaches which were not yet repaired, and his troops had actually penetrated into the lower town; but, tho&s;e in the upper part making a vigorous &s;ally, obliged them to retire in di&s;order. A conference was afterwards opened at Calais by the commi&s;&s;ioners of both nations, to treat of a pacification; but, the French in|&s;i&s;ting upon Henry's abandoning Boulogne as a preliminary article, the nego|tiation produced no effect. The king, at his return to England, ordered forti|fications to be rai&s;ed at Grave&s;end and Tilbury, for the defence of the river Thames, and took all the nece&s;&s;ary precautions to repel an inva&s;ion, which he imagined Francis would attempt in his turn. The earl of Lennox, the lord Dacres, and Sir Thomas Wharton were &s;ent with a body of forces into Scot|land, where they took Dumfries, and plundered the country, from whence they carried off a very con&s;iderable booty. The &s;ucce&s;s of this incur&s;ion encou|raged Sir Ralph Evers, now created a baron, and Sir Bryan Layton, to make an|other inroad in the winter, when they laid wa&s;te all Teviotdale, with the &s;poils

of which they returned in $$iumph. In order to animate their endeavours in t$e pro&s;ecution of this war, they were indulged with a grant of all the lands they &s;hould conquer; and thus encouraged, they renewed their incur&s;ions in<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> t$e &s;pring.

<P>In the beginning of the year the marechal de Biez encamped with fourteen thou&s;and men in the neighbourhood of Boulogne, in order to build a $ort that &s;hould command the harbour; but, the earl o$ Hertford, who com|manded in the town, making a $ally with part of the garri&s;on, compelled him to retire with precipitation, leaving behind &s;ome artillery, and great part of his baggage. Francis now determined to make one great effort again&s;t England. He equipped a va&s;t fleet, and rai&s;ed a very numerous army, de&s;igning to attack Bou$ogne both by &s;ea and land. He &s;ent a reinforcement to the marechal de Biez, with order to build that fort which he had been obliged to leave undone. Mean while, he him&s;elf repairing to Havre de Grace, which was the rendez|vous of his &s;hipping, commanded his admiral Annebaut to &s;et &s;ail for the coa&s;t of England. The French $$eet arrived on the eightee$th day of July at Spi$head, in &s;ight of Port&s;mouth, where they were encountered by the Engli&s;h navy, which being greatly inferior to them in number, after a &s;light &s;kirmi&s;h retired into the harbour. Then the French made a de&s;cent upon the I&s;le of Wight, where they burned a few farms and villages; and afterwards they $$$$ed on the coa$t of Suffex, in hope that Henry, who had come to Port&s;|mouth, would order his fleet to quit the harbour, and &s;ail to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of t$e country. But, An$ebaut being di&s;appointed in his expectation, and find|ing that excellent precautions had been taken for the &s;ecurity of the coa&s;t, he watered on the I&s;le of Wight, and retired towards Boulogne, where he &s;et on &s;hore four thou&s;and &s;oldiers, with all the pioneers which had been embarked for the exped$$ion. Then he &s;et &s;ail again for the Engli&s;h coa&s;t; and Henry's fleet being by this time augmented, put to &s;ea to give them battle: they met in a little time, and engaged each $ther with equal $ury; but, night parting them, after they had fought two hours, the French retired to Havre de Grace, and the Engli&s;$ admiral &s;teering towards Normandy, ravaged the coa&s;ts of that province.</P>

<P>The principal aim of Francis was the reduction of Boulogne: he had hired ten thou&s;and Land$quenets for that &s;ervice, and be&s;towed the command of h$s whole army upon marechal de Biez, who encamped in the neighbourhood o$ t$e $ort, which he $ad undertaken to build at Portet. This work, how|ever, advanced very &s;lo$ly, through the ignorance of the marechal and his en|gineer; at length being alarmed with a report that Henry had likewi&s;e engaged a &s;trong body o$ Land&s;quenets in his &s;ervice, and intended to &s;end over an army for the relief of Boulogne, he left the fort unfini&s;hed, and took po&s;t on the mountain of St. Lambert, that he might prevent the enemy from throwing &s;uccours into the town.

While the French army lay encamped at St. Lambert, the duke of Orleans died at Chateau-Montier, to the un&s;peakable regret of his father Francis, who&s;e peace with the emperor, in a great mea&s;ure, depended upon the life of that young prince. Skirmi&s;hes were daily fought between parties of the Engli&s;h garri&s;on of Boulogne and the French army, in one of which the duke d'Aumale, afterwards duke of Gui&s;e, received a &s;urpri&s;ing wound from a lance, which, penetrating at the corner of his eye, advanced half a foot within his &s;kull, and, the lance breaking, the head of it remained in that po|&s;ition.

<P>The &s;ea&s;on being now pretty far advanced, the marechal de Biez was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai. Ld.

Such were the tran&s;actions of a campaign, which Francis began with an army of two h$ndred thou&s;and men, rai&s;ed and maintained at a prodigious expence. The French king &s;eeing all his mea&s;ures had mi&s;carried, that his kingdom was exhau&s;ted, and him&s;elf threatened with a new war by the emperor, as the conditions of the la&s;t treaty were di&s;&s;olved by the death of the duke d'Orleans, began to be extremely de&s;irous of reconciling him&s;elf with England: but, as he did not choo&s;e to be a &s;uitor in his own name to Henry, he took &s;uch mea|&s;ures, that the princes of the league of Smalcalde offered them&s;elves as me|diators. This interpo&s;ition appeared the more natural, as they were mena|ced by the emperor, who had entered into a negotiation with the Turks, and could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to find a better expedient for their own &s;afety than that of compromi&s;ing the difference between Francis and Henry, and &s;olliciting the protection of the&s;e two princes. They accordingly &s;ent envoys into France and England, with propo&s;als of mediation. The&s;e were well received at both courts: a congre&s;s was opened between Ardres and Gui&s;nes; but, Francis de|manding that Boulogne &s;hould be re&s;tored, and the Scots comprehended in the treaty, Henry refu&s;ed to comply with the&s;e articles, and the negotiation proved ineffectual. The king of England, however, in hope of over-awing Francis into more conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;ent the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and We&s;t|min&s;ter on an emba&s;&s;y to the emperor, as if he had been inclined to a recon|ciliation with Charles. On the other hand Francis &s;ent a body of five thou&s;and men into Scotland, under the command of the count de Montgommeri, that a powerful divi&s;ion might be made upon the Engli&s;h frontiers. The Scotti&s;h army thus reinforced, amounting to fifteen thou&s;and men, advanced towards the Tweed; and, &s;mall parties pa&s;&s;ing the river, made &s;hort incur&s;ions into the territories of England; but the French general could not per&s;uade his allies to venture them&s;elves wholly in the enemy's country.

The war was carried on even in the winter &s;ea&s;on: the earl of Surry, &s;on to the duke of Norfolk, who com|manded at Boulogne, being informed of a convoy which the French conducted to the fort of Outreau, attacked it with part of his garri&s;on, but was defeated and obliged to retreat in great confu&s;ion; and Henry was &s;o mortified at this check that he recalled the earl, and &s;ent the lord Grey to command in his room.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. $$. 1546.</NOTE> At the &s;ame time, the king, hearing the French de&s;igned to cut off the com|munication between Boulogne and Calais, ordered the earl of Hertford, with ten thou&s;and men, to go and take po&s;t at Amblevi$le, where he built two forts to &s;ecure the communication. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e ho&s;tilities both kings pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired an accommodation: Francis perceived that the reduction of Boulogne was a much more difficult ta&s;k than he had imagined; and he &s;aw him&s;elf upon the e$e of a war with the emperor, in which ca&s;e he &s;hould want the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch an ally as the king of England. Henry, on the other hand$ was become &s;o corpulent that he could not a&s;cend the &s;teps of the &s;tair that led up to his chamber, without the utmo&s;t difficulty. This unwieldine&s;s rendered him indolent and unfit for managing the admini&s;tration; and grew upon him &s;o fa&s;t that he believed it would &s;oon put a period to his life: &s;o that he was unwilling to leave an expen&s;ive war upon the hands of his infant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. Be&s;ides, he dreaded the power and ambition of the emperor, and de|&s;igns of the pope, again&s;t which he wi&s;hed to rai&s;e a bulwark, by making an alliance with the king of France and the prote&s;tants of Germany. Both parties being thus favourably di&s;po&s;ed, the plenipotentiaries of France and England opened a congre&s;s at Campes between Gui&s;nes and Ardres. In the beginning of June, they concluded a treaty, importing, That Francis &s;hould pay to Henry at a certain day two millions of golden crowns, in lieu of the arrears of his pen|&s;ion, and the money expended in the &s;iege of Boulog$e, which town Henry &s;hould keep in his own hands, until he &s;hould rece$ve payment of all that was due to him from the king of France; but, tho&s;e debts being di&s;charged, Bou|logne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> with its territory, &s;hould be re&s;tored to its former owner.

Before the conclu&s;ion of the peace the prote&s;tants of Germany &s;ent prince Philip, brother of the elector palatine, to demand &s;uc|cours from Henry; and, in particular, to &s;ollicit a &s;upply of one hundred thou&s;and crowns for the defence of the league: but, in&s;tead of money, he &s;ent them &s;even propo&s;itions, containing the terms upon which he was willing to engage in a defen&s;ive league with the prote&s;tants.

<P>The enemies of the reformation, perceiving the king was now more furiou&s;ly than ever incen&s;ed again&s;t the Sacramentarians, made another effort to de&s;troy Cranmer. They renewed their complaints again&s;t the arch|bi&s;hop, as the protector of that pernicious &s;ect; and told Henry, that were he once committed pri&s;oner to the Tower, &s;uch proofs would appear again&s;t him, as would a&s;toni&s;h his maje&s;ty. The king loved Cranmer with an affection which &s;eemed to contradict every other part of his character; and he now re|&s;ented the pre&s;umption of tho&s;e who attempted to ruin a man, in who&s;e favour he had &s;o often interpo&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s, he di&s;&s;embled his &s;entiments, receiv|ed the articles of his accu&s;ation, and permitted that he &s;hould next day be examined in council. In the night, however, he &s;ent privately for Cranmer, told him what had pa&s;&s;ed, and de&s;ired to know in what manner he propo&s;ed to defend him&s;elf. The archbi&s;hop thanked the king for his great goodne&s;s in making him previou&s;ly acquainted with the de&s;ign of his enemies, and humbly intreated him to appoint &s;uch judges $or his trial as &s;hould under&s;tand the &s;ubject on which he would be tried. Henry, &s;miling at his &s;implicity, told him he was a fool to make &s;o light of his own &s;afety; that, if he was once in pri&s;on, they would find abundance of fal&s;e witne&s;&s;e$ to ruin him; and that, &s;ince he could not take care of him&s;elf, he the king would look after his affairs. He directed him to appear before the council when &s;ummoned, and plead his p$$|vilege as privy co$n&s;ellor, that his accu&s;ers might be bro$ght be$ore his $ace; that in ca&s;e they &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon committing him to the Tower, he &s;hould appeal per&s;onally to the king, and produce his maje&s;ty's &s;eal ring, which he then took from his finger, and delivered to Cranmer. Next morning, being &s;ummoned $o appear before the council, and going to the place where they $at, he was kept waiting in a lobby among &s;erv$nts, to the a$toni&s;hment of all the &s;pectators, until doctor Butts, t$e king's phy&s;ician, having &s;een $$m by accident, communicated this circum&s;tance to Henry, who forthwith &s;ent an

order that he &s;hould be admitted. When he appeared before the board, they gave him to under&s;tand they had received divers informations, affirming that all the here&s;ies in England &s;prung from him and his chaplains. He, in his an&s;wer, conformed to the king's direction; and, perceiving them bent upon committing him to the Tower, told them he was &s;orry to be &s;o u&s;ed by tho&s;e with whom he had &s;at &s;o long at the &s;ame board. So &s;aying, he pre&s;ented the ring, at &s;ight of which they were a&s;toni&s;hed and confounded, and repaired in a body to the king, who chid them &s;everely for having treated the primate of England in &s;uch an unworthy manner. He &s;aid he thought he had a wi&s;er council than now he found they were. He laid his hand upon his brea&s;t$ and declared, by the faith $e owed to God, that he believed the archbi&s;hop was the mo&s;t faithful of all his &s;ubjects. The duke of Norfolk endeavoured to excu&s;e their conduct, by &s;aying that all they intended was a trial, by which the arch|bi&s;hop's innocence wouid have been vindicated, &s;o as to free him from all fu|ture a&s;per&s;ions. Henry replied with a frown, he would not &s;uffer per&s;ons who were &s;o dear to him, to be handled in that fa&s;hion: he &s;aid he knew their fac|tions and malice, and was re&s;olved to extingui&s;h the one and puni&s;h the other without mercy.

<P>The popi&s;h party were not &s;o di&s;couraged by this mi&s;carriage, but that they attempted another &s;troke of &s;till greater importance. The queen was a favourer of the reformation; and &s;ermons were often preached in her apartments by mini&s;ters of that per&s;ua&s;ion. The king was appri&s;ed of the&s;e par|ticulars, at which he connived. He was even indulgent enough to bear her di&s;puting with him on points of religion; and &s;ometimes her zeal got the better o$ her di&s;cretion. One evening &s;he had proceeded &s;o far, that he was exa&s;pe|rated at her petulance: perhaps his vanity was mortified by her foiling him in the way of argument. When &s;he quitted the apartment, he complained of her pre&s;umption to Gardiner, who fed his re&s;entment with malicious in&s;muations; and, a&s;&s;ociating the chancellor in his de&s;ign, repre&s;ented the queen and her principal ladies as heretics who favoured the innovators, and had corre&s;ponded with Anne A&s;kew. They even a$firmed they were traitors as well as heretics, and inflamed Henry's pa&s;&s;ions in &s;uch an artful manner, that he &s;ub&s;cribed certain articles again&s;t the queen, intended as the foundation of an impeach|ment. The chancellor, chancing to drop this paper, it was found by a per&s;on who delivered it to Catherine. She no &s;ooner &s;aw the king's &s;ub&s;cription than &s;he concluded her&s;elf ruined, and was overwhelmed with fear and con&s;ternation. The agitation of her mind produced violent fits, of which Henry being in|$ormed, vi&s;ited her in her chamber, and &s;poke to her with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, as greatly contributed to her recovery. Next night &s;he waited upon the king in his apartment; and, he turning the conver&s;ation upon reli|gious di&s;putes, &s;he &s;aid, that, con&s;cious of the weakne&s;s of her &s;ex, &s;he, as in duty bound, would &s;ubmit in the&s;e and all other points to his &s;uperior judg|ment. Henry, &s;till piqued at her former oppo&s;ition, replied, "Not &s;o, by St. Mary! you are become a doctor, Kate, to in&s;truct, not to be in&s;tructed." She then very artfully a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he &s;hould never have pre&s;umed to argue with him on any &s;ubject, except to amu&s;e the pain of his infirmities, or with a view to profit by his &s;uperior learning.

<P>The prote&s;tants had &s;till more cau&s;e to triumph in the ruin of the duke of Norfolk, who had been their mo&s;t powerful and implacable enemy. The duke was a nobleman who had &s;erved the king with talents and fidelity; and his &s;on, the earl of Surry, was a young gentleman of great courage and vivacity, though not without a tincture of pride, vanity, and affectation. The family was not only powerful in its own &s;trength, but rendered &s;till more im|portant by being at the head of the popi&s;h party. Of cour&s;e it became for|midable to the earl of Hertford and Sir Thomas Seymour, who pretended to the management of affairs in ca&s;e of the king's decea&s;e. They knew the en|mi$y which the Howards bore them, and dreaded their competition in a mino|rity. They per&s;uaded Henry that the earl of Surry a&s;pired at a marriage with the prince&s;s Mary, in which ca&s;e he might embroil the government of young Edward. They even hinted he had de&s;igns upon the crown, and bore the arms of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, without any badge of di&s;tinction and diminution. This was a &s;tring that Henry never heard touched without emotion. He re|&s;olved to &s;acrifice the family of Norfolk to the &s;ecurity of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. That unhappy family was divided in it&s;elf. The dutche&s;s, who had lived &s;ome years in a &s;tate of &s;eparation from her hu&s;band, turned informer again&s;t him: his &s;uppo&s;ed concubine, Mrs. Holland, acted the &s;ame treacherous part. His daughter, Mary dutche$$ dowager of Richmond, was at variance with her brother the earl of Surry, and enli&s;ted her&s;elf among the number of his accu&s;ers, the chief o$ whom was Sir Richard Southwell, who charged him with infidelity to the king. The earl denied the charge, and challenged Southwell to &s;ingle combat: indeed the whole imputation brought again&s;t this noble family, amounted to no more than &s;ome ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;$ons of di$content, and the earl's bearing the arms of Edward the Con$e&s;&s;or, while his father u&s;ed tho&s;e of Eng|land, with a di&s;tinction of labels of &s;ilver, which were peculiar to the prince of Wal$s. The&s;e armorial bearings had been authorized by the heralds; and, for a &s;eries of years, ob&s;erved by the king, without giving offence: but, now that a pretence was wanting for the ruin of the Howards, they were deemed &s;ufficient grounds for an attainder. The earl of Surry was tried by a common jury, convicted, notwith&s;tanding the excellent de$ence he made, condemned, and beheaded on Tower-hill. The father endeavoured to mollify the king by letters and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions; but Henry's heart was not at all &s;ubject to tender im|pre&s;&s;ions. The parliament meeting on the fourteenth day of January, a bill of attai$der was brought again&s;t the duke of Nor$o$k, who could not have

been convicted on a fair hearing before his peers; and this pa&s;&s;ing, received the royal a&s;&s;ent from the lord chancellor, the earl of Hertford, and the lords St. John and Ru&s;&s;el, joined in commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal for that purpo&s;e. The death-warrant was immediately &s;ent to the lieutenant of the Tower, and the duke would have been beheaded next morning, had not an event of greater con&s;equence to the kingdom intervened, and prevented the execution.</P>

<P>Henry had for &s;ome time perceived him&s;elf fa&s;t approaching the goal of life. On the eleventh day of December he had e&s;tabli&s;hed the noble foundation of Trinity College in Cambridge; and on the thirtieth day of the &s;ame month, he made his will, bequeathing the crown to his &s;on prince Ed|ward and his i&s;&s;ue; failing which, to his daughters Mary and Elizabeth$ in default of whom and their i&s;&s;ue, to the heirs of his nieces Frances and Eleanor, daughters of his &s;i&s;ter Mary late queen of France; and after them, to the next lawful heir: &s;o that the children of his elder &s;i&s;ter Margaret queen of Scotland, were excluded from their rank in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He willed that his own daugh|ters &s;hould forfeit their right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hould they marry without con&s;ent of the privy council. In the mean time, to each of them he left ten thou|&s;and pounds, by way of dower, and three thou&s;and for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, until they &s;hould be married. The queen was intit$led to three thou&s;and pounds in plate, and one thou&s;and in money, over and above her jointure. He left &s;ix hun|dred pounds a-year in land, to the dean and chapter of Wind&s;or, for the main|tenance of thirteen poor knights, and other pious u&s;es. His executors were directed to pay his debts, repair any injuries he might have unknowingly com|mitted, and confirm all his grants and promi&s;es not perfected at the time of his decea&s;e. Legacies were left to each of his executors, and many of his faithful &s;ervants. On the third day of January, he pa&s;&s;ed a grant of St. Bartholemew's Ho&s;pital, with the &s;cite of Chri&s;t's church, and five hundred marks a-year to the city of London. Though Henry believed his malady was incurable, per|haps he did not think death was &s;o very near; and no per&s;on would venture to tell him his &s;ituation, until Sir Anthony Denny, out of chri&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion, exhorted him to take care of his &s;oul, as he, in all probability, had not many hours of life to enjoy. He thanked him for his charitable candour, owned he had been a great &s;inner; but, expre&s;&s;ed his confidence in the mercies of Chri&s;t. When Denny propo&s;ed a gho&s;tly director, he de&s;ired him to &s;end for archbi|&s;hop Cranmer, who had retired to Croyden, that he might not be pre&s;ent, nor concerned in the &s;candalous bill of attainder again&s;t the duke of Norfolk, who had always been his enemy. Before he reached the palace, Henry was &s;peech|le&s;s, though not in&s;en&s;ible; for, when the archbi&s;hop de&s;ired him to make &s;ome &s;ign of his dying in the faith of Chri&s;t, he &s;queezed his hand with &s;eeming fervour, and in a few minutes expired, on the twenty-eighth day of January,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Henry VIII. before he became corpulent, was a prince of a goodly per&s;onage, and commanding a&s;pect, rather imperious than dignified. He excelled in all the exer|ci&s;es
<PB N="658" REF="6700">
of youth, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed agood under&s;tanding, which was not much improved by the nature of hiseducation. In&s;tead of learning that philo&s;ophy which opens the mind, and extends the qualitiesof the heart, he wasconfined to the &s;tudy of gloomy and &s;chola&s;tic di&s;qui&s;itions, which &s;erved to cramp the ideas, and pervert the facul|ties of rea&s;on, qualifying him for the di&s;putant of a cloi&s;ter, rather than the law|giver of a people. In the fir&s;t years of his reign, his pride and vanity &s;eemed to domi$$$$ over all his other pa&s;&s;ions; though from the beginning he was i$petuous, $ead&s;tr$ng$ impatient of contradiction and advice. He was ra&s;h, arrogant, prodigal, vain-glorious, pedantic and &s;uper&s;titious. He delighted in pomp and pageantry, the baubles of a weak mind. His pa&s;&s;ions &s;oothed by adulation, rejected all re&s;traint; and as he was an utter &s;tranger to the f$ner feelings of the &s;oul, $e gratified them at the expence of ju&s;tice and humanity, without remo$&s;e or comp$$ction. He wre&s;ted the &s;upremacy from the bi&s;hop of Rome, partly on con&s;cientious motives, and partly for rea&s;ons of &s;tate and convenience. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the mona&s;teries in order to &s;upply his extravagance with their &s;poils; but, he would not have made tho&s;e acqui&s;itions &s;o ea&s;ily, had not they been productive of advantage to his nobility, and agreeable to the nation in general. He was frequently at war, but the greate&s;t conque&s;t he obtained, was that over his own parliament and people. Religious di&s;putes had divided them into two factions. As he had it in his power to make either &s;cale preponderate, each courted his favour with the mo&s;t ob&s;equious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and in trimming the ballance, $e kept them both in &s;ubjection. In accu&s;tom|ing them&s;elves to the&s;e abject compliances, they degenerated into &s;laves; and $e from their pro&s;titution acquired the mo&s;t de&s;potic authority. He became rapacious, arbitrary, froward, fretful, and &s;o cruel, that he &s;eemed to delight in the blood of his &s;ubjects. He never betrayed the lea&s;t &s;ymptoms of any ten|derne&s;s in his di&s;po&s;ition, and as we have already ob&s;erved, his kindne&s;s to Cranmer was an incon&s;i&s;tency in his character. He &s;eemed to live in defiance of cenfure whether eccle&s;ia&s;tical or &s;ecular; $e died in apprehen&s;ion of futurity; and was buried at Wind&s;or with idle proce&s;&s;ions, and childi&s;h pageantry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He$$y, by his $word$ wi$e Ca$$eri$e of Sp$i$, had $$o &s;$$s who died in their i$f$$cy, a$d a $word$ M$ry, who $$cceeded to the t$$o$e of Eng|land. $word$ $word$ was $word$ of Eli$abeth$ $$d a $$le child $span$ By $word$ $word$ he had a &s;o$ $word$ $word$ his i$$edi$$$ $word$ A$$e of Cle$$s, $word$ Howard, and Cathe|ri$$ $word$ h$d no $word$ By $$$zabeth $word$ wi|dow of Sir Gilbert Taille$oi$, he had He$$y F$t$|roy, created knight of the garter, earl of Nottin|gh$$, duke of Rich$o$d and Somer&s;et, warden of the Scotti$$ Marche$, admiral of England, and $word$ $word$ of Irel$$d.

<P>HENRY VIII. was &s;ucceeded on the throne of England by his only &s;on Edward VI. now in the tenth year of his age. At the time of his father's death he re&s;ided at Hertford with his &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, from whence he was conducted by his uncle the earl of Hertford, and Sir Thomas Brown, to the Tower of London, where he was received by the council in a body, and proclaimed king of England. Next day, the late king's will being opened, it appeared, that Edward's majority was fixed at the age of fifteen: that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The$e were archbi&s;hop Cranmer, lord Wri|othe&s;ley chancellor, lord St. John &s;teward of the hou&s;hold, lord Ru&s;&s;el keeper of the privy &s;eal, the earl of Hertford lord chamberlain, the lord vi&s;count de Li&s;le, Cuthbert Ton&s;tal bi&s;hop of Dur|ham, Sir Anthony Brown ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, Sir William Paget &s;ecretary of &s;tate, Sir$ Edward No$ the chancellor of the court of augmentations, Sir Edward Montague chief ju&s;tice of the common pleas, Mr. Bromley one of the twelve judges, Sir Anthony Denny, Sir William Herbert gentleman of the privy chamber, Sir Edward Wo$ton trea|&s;urer of Calais, doctor Wotton dean of Canter|bury and York. Stephen Gardiner was expunged from the will by the king's own hand.</NOTE> &s;ixteen per&s;ons were nominated as executors of the will, regents of the kingdom, and tutors of the young king; and that the&s;e, or the majority of them, were im|powered to regulate the affairs of the admini&s;tration.

Then &s;ome of the members ob&s;erving, that it would be trouble&s;ome to the people, and e&s;pecially to foreign mini&s;ters, to addre&s;s them&s;elves to &s;ixteen different per&s;ons of equal $uthority, propo&s;ed, that one of the number &s;hould be cho&s;en as chief and pre&s;ident, under the title of Protector. This propo&s;al was vehemently op|po&s;ed by the chancellor, who $ore&s;aw the choice would fall upon the earl of Hertford, with whom he had been long at variance on account of religion. His objections, however, were over-ruled. That nobleman was cho&s;en pro|tector of the rea$m, and governor of the king's per&s;on, on this expre&s;s con|dition, That he &s;hould do nothing without the con&s;ent of the other regents. While preparations were making for the funeral of Henry, and the coronation of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the regency took an extraordinary &s;tep, on pretence of fulfilling the intentions of the late king, who had re&s;olved to make &s;ome promotions<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$$wood.</NOTE> among his courtiers. Evidence was examined touching the particulars of Henry's de&s;ign, and in con&s;equence of their depo&s;itions, the earl of Hertford was created duke of Somer&s;et; the earl of E$$ex made marquis of Northamp|ton; the title of earl of Warwick was conferred upon Dudley lord vi&s;count de Li$$e; chancellor Wriothe&s;ley was promoted to the earldom of Southampton; Sir Thomas Seymour was created baron Sudley; and Rich, Willoughby, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Sheffield, were erected into barons of the &s;ame appellations. At the &s;ame time the duke of Somer&s;et was created trea&s;urer and marechal, vacant by the condemnation of the duke of Norfolk; and his brother the new baron Sudley, was appointed admiral of England. After the ob&s;equies of the late king, they proceeded to the coronation of Edward, which was performed on the twentieth day of February; and on this occa&s;ion an amne&s;ty was publi&s;hed, from which $owever, t$e d$ke of Norfolk, cardinal Pole, Edward Courtney, elde&s;t &s;on of the marquis of Exeter, and three other per&s;ons, were excluded.</P>

<P>The lord chancellor being a man of a $iery, ambitious, turbulent di&s;|po&s;ition, who&s;e politics and religion were very different from tho&s;e of the pro|$ector, this la$t re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity to expel him from the re|gency; and he &s;oon furni&s;hed him with a pretence. He granted a commi&s;|&s;ion under the great &s;eal to certain &s;ub&s;titutes, to hear and decide cau&s;es in chancery in the &s;ame manner as if he him&s;elf were pre&s;ent. And this &s;tep he took of his own &s;imple authority, without the con&s;ent of the king, or other regents. The council being apprized of the affair, ordered the judges of the realm to give their opinions on the &s;ubject; and they unanimou&s;ly dec$$red, that the chancellor could not delegate his power to any other per&s;ons without the con&s;ent of the king and regency; otherwi&s;e he forfeited his office, and became liable to fine and impri&s;onment. When he was made acquainted w$th this declaration in full council, he inveighed again&s;t the judges, and even<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> reviled the council and protector. In a word, his behaviour incen&s;ed the mem|bers
<PB N="661" REF="6730">
to &s;uch a degree, that he was confined to his own hou&s;e, and deprived of the great &s;eal, which was put into the hands of the lord St. John, until another chancellor could be appointed: but, the earl of Southampton was afterwards relea&s;ed on his giving &s;ecurity for the payment of the fine to which he &s;hould be condemned. Somer&s;et having removed this trouble&s;ome opponent, gave his colleagues to under&s;tand, that the French amba&s;&s;ador, and other foreign envoys, de&s;ired to be &s;atisfied concerning the extent of his power, before they would treat with him on the &s;ubjects of their &s;everal emba&s;&s;ies; and therefore, it would be nece&s;&s;ary that his protector&s;hip &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by patent. They thought the propo&s;al was rea&s;onable, and joined him in a petition to the king, who by patent con&s;tituted the duke of Somer&s;et governor of his per&s;on, and protector of his realm and &s;ubjects. All the executors, except the earl of South|ampton, were with the twelve additional coun&s;ellors, a&s;&s;igned to him for a council; but they were re&s;trained from doing any thing without his con&s;ent and advice; whereas he was impowered to &s;wear of the council any per&s;on he &s;hould think proper for that &s;tation, and in conjunction with any number of the coun&s;ellors which he might choo&s;e, to convene, annul, or change whatever they &s;hould think proper to alter or aboli&s;h. Thus he made him&s;elf ab&s;olutely ma&s;ter of the government, though in &s;o doing, he intailed upon him&s;elf the hatred and envy of many other noblemen, by which he &s;uffered &s;everely in the &s;equel.</P>

<P>Since the death of Henry, two new treaties had been concluded with France. The fir&s;t was a renewal of alliance between Francis and Edward; and the other related to the limits of the territory of Boulogne, and the fortifica|tions which the two kings had erected in the neighbourhood of that place. It was agreed, That the Engli&s;h might fini&s;h the works they had begun at Boulemberg, Blackne&s;s, and Ambleteu&s;e: and, That the French &s;hould have the &s;ame liberty with re&s;pect to tho&s;e at St. Etienne; but di&s;continue their works at Portet and La Pointe. But, Francis dying before the ratification of this treaty, the politics of the court of France a&s;&s;umed another a&s;pect under Henry II. his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The protector of England was no &s;ooner informed of the death of Francis, than he di&s;patched a courier to Nicholas Wotton the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, directing him to receive the ratification of the new king, and &s;ee him &s;wear to the ob&s;ervance of the treaties. By this time<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub. Ninan.</NOTE> the intere&s;t of the cardinal of Lorraine, and the duke of Gui&s;e, predominated at the court of France; and being devoted to the old religion, they exerted all their power in preventing the marriage between young Edward and their niece the queen of Scotland. They per&s;uaded Henry, that it was his intere&s;t to re|cover Boulogne at any rate; and therefore he not only refu&s;ed to ratify the treaties, but even di&s;owned the amba&s;&s;ador whom his father had &s;ent to Lon|don. Thus the un&s;ettled limits of the territory of Boulogne, and the new for|tifications, remained a &s;ubject of contention between the two crowns; and from Henry's refu&s;ing to confirm the alliance, it plainly appeared his intention was to infringe the treaty.</P>

<P>The eyes of Henry VIII. were no &s;ooner clo&s;ed, than the friends of the reformation congratulated them&s;elves on the event. They no longer &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments on religion; but, maintained their doctrines openly in preaching and teaching, even while the laws again&s;t them continued in full
<PB N="662" REF="6740">
force. Indeed, they had at this juncture very little to fear from their adver|&s;aries. The king him&s;elf was bred up in the reformed religion by his preceptor doctor Coxe, and had already given &s;urprizing proofs of genius, capacity, and an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, aver&s;e to cruelty and per&s;ecution. The protector pro|fe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame doctrines, which were e&s;pou&s;ed by Cranmer of Canterbury, Hol|gate of York, Holbech of Lincoln, Goodrick of Ely, doctor Ridley, and Lati|mer, who was by this time relea&s;ed from pri&s;on. The prote&s;tants in Germany had received a private &s;upply of fifty thou&s;and crowns from the regency, which re&s;olved to &s;eize this favourable conjuncture for promoting the reformation. With this view they appointed vi&s;itors to examine all the churches, and impow|ered them to aboli&s;h certain gro&s;s abu&s;es which had crept into the wor&s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> particularly that of images.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; V.</HEAD>
<P>The next affair that ingro&s;&s;ed the protector's attention was the war with Scotland. Henry had on his death-bed laid &s;trong injunctions upon his exe|cutors to effect, if po&s;&s;ible, the match between Edward and Mary; and as the French party prevailed in Scotland, there was no pro&s;pect of executing what he had &s;o much at heart, in any other way but by force of arms: the protector therefore began to make preparations for pro&s;ecuting the war in Scotland, while the French king declared, that he would not abandon his antient allies in their di&s;tre&s;s. At the de&s;ire of the French amba&s;&s;ador, the duke of Somer&s;et con&s;ented to try the effect of a negotiation, before ho&s;tilities &s;hould be com|menced. Conferences were opened on the fourth day of Augu&s;t; and Ton&s;tal, chief of the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries, was directed to break up the congre&s;s immediately, if the Scotti&s;h amba&s;&s;adors had no power to con&s;ent to the mar|riage. Accordingly, as no &s;uch power was ve&s;ted in them, the negotiation proved fruitle&s;s. The protector therefore entered Scotland in the beginning of September with an army of fifteen thou&s;and infantry, and three thou&s;and hor&s;e, well appointed, provided with a train of artillery. John Dudley earl of Warwick was the protector's lieutenant; and the cavalry was commanded by lord Gray, lord Dacres, and Sir Francis Bryan. The $egent of Scotland, alarmed at this inva&s;ion, ordered the fire-cro&s;s to be carried through all parts of the realm, and made proclamation, that all men above &s;ixteen years of age, and under &s;ixty, &s;hould re&s;ort to Mu&s;sleburgh with arms and provi&s;ion. Thus &s;ummoned, a great number appeared at the place of rendezvous; &s;o that the regent di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a great &s;uperfluity, after having retained an army of thirty thou&s;and men, well &s;up|plied with arms, ammunition, and ordnance. They took po&s;t near Mu&s;sleburgh within four miles of Edinburgh, in order to attack the Engli&s;h in their march; and the duke of Somer&s;et encamped at the village of Pre&s;tonpans, at the di&s;tance of about two miles from their front. While the two armies lay in this &s;itua|tion, the Scotti&s;h regent detached be&s;t part of his cavalry to in&s;ult the Engli&s;h quarters, and the&s;e being encountered by the lord Gray, and Sir Francis Bryan, were totally defeated, after an ob&s;tinate and furious engagement, in which the lord Home, and about eight hundred Scots, were left dead upon the field. Next day a trumpeter came with an in&s;olent me&s;&s;age from the Scotti&s;h general, permitting the protector to $etire in peace to his own country; and propo&s;ing from the lord Huntley, that the quarrel &s;hould be decided by twenty again&s;t twenty, ten again&s;t ten, or by &s;ingle combat between him&s;elf and the duke of Somer&s;et. A proper an&s;wer was made to this bravado by the protector, and
<PB N="663" REF="6750">
the earl of Warwick begged leave, that he might be allowed to accept of Hunt|ley's challenge: but the duke would not grant his permi&s;&s;ion; and it afterwards appeared that Huntley had &s;ent no &s;uch me&s;&s;age. Before the protector would engage the enemy, he &s;ent a letter to the Scotti&s;h regent, a&s;&s;uring him his intention was not to hurt the realm of Scotland, but rather to defend it, by promoting an union of the two kingdoms on fair and honourable terms, by virtue of the marriage to which the Scotti&s;h parliament had agreed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner. He pointed out the advantages that would accrue to Scot|land from &s;uch a match. He propo&s;ed, that if all the nobility of the kingdom were not inclined to a peace upon &s;uch terms, ho&s;tilities &s;hould cea&s;e until the queen &s;hould be of age to choo&s;e for her&s;elf.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>The regent communicated the&s;e honourable propo&s;als to his brother John archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, and a few other individuals, who being elated with the hope of victory, advi&s;ed him to conceal them from the re&s;t of the nobility; and in the mean time, di&s;fu&s;ed a report through the whole army, that the Eng|li&s;h were come to carry off the queen, and en&s;lave the country. The &s;ol|diers believed this in&s;inuation, and took to their arms in a tumultuary manner. Under&s;tanding that the Engli&s;h were in motion, they pa&s;&s;ed the river E&s;k, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a ri&s;ing-ground, while the protector wheeled about, and encamped upon the hill of Pinkencleuch, near the &s;ide of the frith, where their fleet lay at anchor. The enemy imagining he intended to reimbark, quitted their advantgeous ground in order to attack them, and this precipitate &s;tep was the cau&s;e of their de&s;truction. The Engli&s;h began to be in want of provi&s;ion, and had the Scots maintained their po&s;t, the protector could not have retreated without expo&s;ing his army to the mo&s;t imminent danger. But, the impetuo&s;ity of the enemy &s;aved him the ri&s;que of any &s;uch di&s;a&s;ter. On the tenth day of September they divided their forces into three bodies. The fir&s;t under the command of the earl of Angus, was flanked on the right with four or five pieces of artillery, and on the left with about four hundred hor&s;emen. The &s;econd line was commanded by the regent. The third by the earl of Argyle, who had brought into the field four thou&s;and Highlanders; and the&s;e were di&s;po&s;ed on the left flanks of the &s;econd and third bodies. The protector &s;eeing them abandon their po&s;t, congratulated him&s;elf upon the event; and cau&s;ed his army to be drawn up in order of battle. The van was commanded by the earl of Warwick, and took po&s;t on the &s;ide of the hill, where the great artillery was po&s;ted. The main body, under the general, was drawn up partly on the hill, and partly on the plain; and the rear was extended on the plain, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the van and center. The lord Gray, who commanded the men at arms, was po&s;ted on the left wing, &s;o as to flank the Scots; but, forbidden to charge until the front of both armies &s;hould be engaged. The enemy advancing along &s;hore, were galled from an Engli&s;h galley, the &s;hot of which killed the lord Graham, and threw the Highlanders into confu&s;ion. The lord Gray perceiving their di&s;order, advanced immediately to charge the enemy's van in flank; but, met with &s;uch a warm reception from their &s;pearmen, that he him&s;elf was dan|gerou&s;ly wounded; and as the action happened in broken ground, his men at arms were actually routed, and the &s;tandard in great danger of being lo&s;t. Had the Scots been furni&s;hed with hor&s;e to pur&s;ue this advantage, in all probability, the Engli&s;h would have been intirely defeated; though the wind and &s;un were

$$ll in $$e $word$ of t$e enemy; but, as they were de&s;titute of cavalry, the lord Gray had time to rally his ho$&s;e behind his in$antry. The earl of Warwick detach$d Sir Peter Me$cas, and Peter Gamboa, a Spani&s;h officer, with all the mu&s;que$ryto attack the Scots, who&s;e Highland archers were not yet come up. The Engli&s;h mu&s;quetry advancing to a&s;lough where the hor&s;e had been di&s;com$ited$ fired in the $ac$s of the enemy. The$e were &s;u&s;tained by the archers, who &s;hot their arrows over the heads of the mu&s;queteers; at the &s;ame time, the artillery planted on the hill on the left, and the ordnance o$ the galley anchored clo&s;e to the &s;ho$e on the left, made &s;uch havock among&s;t th$m, that they fell in heaps, withou$ having it in their power to annoy their enemies. In this di&s;|tre&s;s, their van fell back a little, in hope of drawing the Engli&s;h over the &s;lough and broken ground, that they might have an opportunity of acting hand to hand; but the Highlanders in the &s;econd line, imagining their front was defeated, betook them&s;elves to flight in a body: and this circum&s;tance overwhelmed t$eir whole army with con&s;ternation. Di&s;order and rout immedi|ately en&s;ued. The Scots threw down their arms, and fled in the utmo&s;t con&s;u|&s;ion. Then the Engli&s;h cavalry being rallied, fell in among the fugitives, and meeting with no re&s;i&s;tance, made &s;uch a terrible carnage, that they lay like &s;heep in a field of pa&s;ture. The whole &s;urface of the ground was &s;trewed with &s;pears and &s;words; the river E&s;k, and &s;everal petty brooks were &s;welled with the blood of the &s;lain, which amounted to fourteen thou&s;and, in&s;omuch, that when the &s;laughter was over, the very &s;oldiers were a&s;ham$d of their own cruelty; for the Engli&s;h did not lo&s;e above fifty hor&s;emen, and their infantry did not &s;trike a $$roke. About three thou&s;and eccle&s;ia$tics, who made a &s;eparate body for them&s;elves, were ma$$acred without mercy. Fifteen hundred of the vanqui&s;hed were taken pri&s;oners, and among the&s;e the earl of Huntley, the lords Ye&s;ter, Hamilton, and Wemys, together with the ma&s;ter of Sempil. Nor was this the only overthrow which the Scots &s;u&s;tained in the cour&s;e of this year. While the regent's attention was wholly turned again&s;t the duke of So|mer&s;et, the lord Wharton, and the earl of Lennox entering Scotland by the we&s;tern Marches, took &s;everal forts, and ravaged the whole country; &s;o that the earl of Bothwell, and many gentlemen of Tevio$dale, and the Mer&s;e, rather than be continually harra&s;&s;ed by the&s;e depredations, &s;ubmitted to the king of England, and were received into his protection. The duke of Somer&s;et, had he taken advantage of the con&s;ternation which filled all Scotland immediately af$er the battle of Mu&s;le$urgh or Pi$key, might have &s;ubdued the whole coun|try without any further oppo&s;ition. But, he was prevented from re$ping the fruits of his &s;ucce&s;s by the intri$ues of his brother in England. Having ga|thered the &s;poils of the field, in which he found thirty thou&s;and ja$ks and &s;words, and thirty pieces of cannon that were tran&s;ported to England, he or|dered his navy to &s;cour the frith, in which they took or de&s;troyed a great number of Scotti&s;h ve$$els. Then he plundered and burned Leith, and all the neigh|bouring villages on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, made an un&s;ucce&s;sful a$$empt on the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, $orti$ied the i&s;land of St. Columba in the f$$th, and the ca&s;tle of Broughty in the mouth of the Tay; and the &s;ea&s;on being far advanced, return$d<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ha$w$$$ $word$ $word$.</NOTE> to England, where he was grati$$ed by the king with lands to the value of five hundred pounds a-year.</P>

<P>He acquired great popularity by his pro$perous $word$ but at the &s;ame time attracted the envy of divers noblemen, nor did he $eem to be$r his fortune with moderation; for, he obtained a p$$ent under the great $word$ to $it in parliament on the right hand of the throne under the cloth of $$$te, and to enjoy all the honours and privileges that at $word$ time any of the uncles of the kings of England had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. In his ab&s;ence the vi&s;itors had performed their ta&s;k without oppo&s;ition, except from Gardiner and Bonner, who refu&s;ed to obey the order of council, alledging, it was contrary to the agreement by which they had engaged to make no change in religion during the king's mi|nority. The&s;e prelates being examined in council, and per&s;i$ting in their ob|&s;tinacy, were committed to pri&s;on. Gardiner expo&s;tulated with the protector in a letter, and the prince&s;s Mary wrote to him on the &s;ame &s;ubject; but, the duke was bent upon protecting the reformation, and therefore payed very little regard to their remon&s;trances. The lord Rich was created chancellor; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> parliament meeting on the fourth day of November, manife&s;ted the utmo&s;t attachment to the protector. They repealed all the acts touching high trea&s;on, which h$d pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the reign of the third Edward; all acts of $elony &s;pe|cified &s;ince the rupture with the pope; the &s;tatute which ve&s;ted the king's procla|mation with the power of an act of parliament; two acts pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Lollards; and the famous &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles. The king's &s;upremacy was confirmed a-new; and the pains of trea&s;on were decreed again&s;t tho&s;e heirs of the crown mentioned in Henry's will, who &s;hould attempt to di&s;turb the order of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: their adherents and abettors were likewi&s;e &s;ubjected to the &s;ame penalties. The benefit of the clergy, and the privileges of &s;anctuary were re&s;tored; from the&s;e however, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and four &s;orts of thieves were ex|cluded. It was decreed, That the act impowering Henry's &s;ucce&s;&s;or to annul the laws made in his minority, &s;hould take place with regard to what &s;hould be done hereafter, but not in that which had been already tran&s;acted. Private ma&s;&s;es were prohibited, and the people permitted to receive the communion in both &s;pecies. The king was impowered to fill vacant bi&s;hoprics; &s;o that &s;ham elections were intirely aboli&s;hed. The cognizance of marrimonial and $$&s;ta|mentary cau&s;es was transferred from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts to tho&s;e of the regal juri&s;diction; and they pa&s;&s;ed a law, enacting, That if any common per&s;on &s;hould refrain from working, or at lea&s;t from offering to work for the &s;pace of three days, he &s;hould be branded in the face with a red hot iron, and become the &s;lave of the informer. This rigorous decree was levelled again&s;t the monks, who &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries, in&s;tead of working for their liveli|hood, &s;trolled from family to family, and endeavoured to breed di&s;turbance in the &s;tate. Neverthele&s;s, this law was not rigorou&s;ly executed, and &s;oon repealed by a &s;ub&s;equent parliament. Finally, they granted to Edward all the foundations for chantries, chapels, and colleges, of which Henry had not al|ready taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This act met with great oppo&s;ition from &s;everal pre|lates, and from Cranmer in particular. He hoped to find &s;ome opportunity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward. Burnet.</NOTE> for converting tho&s;e benefactions to religious purpo&s;es; whereas, by being in the hands of the king, the church would be deprived of them for ever. But, he was not able to carry his point. The nobility thir&s;ted after the effects of the church, and the&s;e they ea&s;ily obtained from the court: and the executors of Henry's will wanted money to pay his debts and legacies. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was

<P>Among tho&s;e who envied the protector, was his own brother Tho|mas the adm$ral, a man of uncommon talents, though proud, turbulent, and untractable. He could not endure the di&s;tinction which king Henry had made between him and his elder brother, with whom he thought him&s;elf equally in|titled to a &s;nare in the admini&s;tration. He had addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the prin|ce&s;s Elizabeth on the &s;ubject of marriage, but &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of &s;ucceed|ing in that p$r&s;uit, he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the affection of the queen dow|ager, who gave him her hand in private, immediately after the death of her former hu&s;band. He found means to obtain from the king a letter, expre&s;&s;ing his de|&s;ire that &s;$ch a match &s;hould be effected; and then he publi&s;hed his marriage, in open defiance of the protector. His next &s;tep was to cabal and make a party among the nobility, who, as they hated his brother, fomented his ambition. He bribed the king's dome&s;tics to his intere&s;t; and young Edward frequently went to his hou&s;e, on pretence of vi&s;iting his mother-in-law. There he ingra|tiated him&s;elf with his &s;overeign, by an affected affability, officious complai&s;ance, and &s;upplying him with money to di&s;tribute among his &s;ervants and favourites, without the knowledge of his governor. The protector being informed of the&s;e in&s;idious proceedings, expo&s;tulated with him on the ba&s;ene&s;s of his con|duct, and he an&s;wered in &s;uch a manner as gave the duke to under&s;tand, he had nothing to hope from his brotherly affection. In the protector's ab&s;ence, he redoubled all his art and in&s;inuation, and obtained a new patent for admiral, with an additional appointment. Sir William Paget perceiving the progre&s;s he daily made in the king's affection, wrote to the duke on the &s;ubject; and he fini&s;hed the campaign in Scotland with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, that he might re|turn in time to counterwork his machinations. But, before he arrived in Eng|land, the admiral had engaged in his party &s;ome privy coun&s;ellors, &s;everal no|blemen of di&s;tinction, and a great number of the members of the lower hou&s;e of parliament. He prevailed upon the king to write a letter to the two hou&s;es with his own hand, de&s;iring the admiral might be appointed his gover|nor; but, before this was delivered, the council being apprized of his de&s;ign, &s;ent deputies to a&s;&s;ure him, if he did not de&s;i&s;t, they would deprive him of his office, &s;e$d him pri&s;oner to the Tower, and pro&s;ecute him on the laft act of parliament, by which he was &s;ubjected to the penalty of high trea&s;on, for at|tempting to di&s;turb the order of government. Thus intimidated, he h$mbled him&s;elf before the council; and was &s;eemingly reconciled to the protector. Yet<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> he &s;till nouri&s;hed the &s;ame de&s;ign in &s;ecret, and his brother &s;u&s;pecting his &s;enti|ments, employed &s;pies to inform him of all his &s;ecret tran&s;actions.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year the emperor defeated and took John Fre|derick, elector of Saxony, who&s;e territories and electorate he be&s;towed upon that prince's cou&s;in Maurice, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him again&s;t his own relations. The landgrave of He&s;&s;e made his peace with Charles, and repaired to his court on the faith of a &s;afe-conduct, notwith&s;tanding which he was arre&s;ted. The emperor, ju&s;tifying this outrage by a word in&s;erted in the &s;afe-conduct on purpo&s;e to trepan the landgrave.

In the beginning of the next year the council made<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1548.</NOTE> &s;everal alterations in the ceremonies of religion. It forbade the u&s;e of candles<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleidan.</NOTE> on Candlemas day, palms on Palm &s;unday, and creeping to the cro&s;s on Good|friday. It left the people at liberty to practi&s;e or lay a&s;ide auricular confe&s;&s;ion; and ordered all the images to be removed from churches. All the popi&s;h party were alarmed at the&s;e changes, which produced great murmurings among&s;t the prie&s;ts and people of the old religion; and when the proclamation, that confirmed the&s;e changes, was publi&s;hed, Gardiner inveighed again&s;t it openly, on his old maxim, that there &s;hould be no innovation during the king's mi|nority. Being &s;ummoned again before the council, he &s;ubmitted to the autho|rity of the board, and was ordered to preach a &s;ermon at St. Paul's, maintain|ing that the king's authority was the &s;ame before as after his majority, He performed this ta&s;k &s;o little to the &s;atisfaction of the regency, that they com|mitted him to the Tower, and this act of &s;everity intimidated the whole party to &s;uch a degree, that they conformed to the new ordinance without further he&s;itation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pur$et.</NOTE></P>

<P>The protector had offered a truce for ten years to the regent of Scotland; but that nobleman, being entirely governed by French councils, rejected his propo&s;als, in hope of being previou&s;ly &s;uccoured by the king of France; &s;o that the duke of Somer&s;et, being obliged to continue the war, took a number of Land&s;quenets into his pay, and appointed the earl of Shrew&s;bury his lieutenant. The regent of Scotland opened the campaign with the &s;iege of Broughty-ca&s;tle, which he could not reduce; while the Engli&s;h troops fortified Haddington and Lauder, and made incur&s;ions to the gates of Edinburgh. In the month of May the regent, receiving a reinforcement of &s;ix thou&s;and men and &s;ome ar|tillery from France, under the command of De&s;&s;&eacute; d'E&s;panvilliers, reinve&s;ted Broughty, which he took, putting all the garri&s;on to the &s;word. The queen mother pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired that young Mary &s;hould be educated in the French court, where her two brothers had &s;uch influence; and the king of France, in order to facilitate the con&s;ent of the regent, created him duke of Chateleraut, with a yearly revenue of two thou&s;and livres. Thus gratified, he allowed the young queen to be put on board of the fleet which brought over the &s;oldiers; and this &s;ailing north about round the Orkneys and Ireland, landed her &s;afely in Bretagne, from whence &s;he was conducted to Paris. The French &s;hips made this circuit in order to avoid the Engli&s;h navy under admiral Seymour, who crui&s;ed in the frith of Edinburgh, and landed in &s;everal parts of Fife; but was, by the gallantry of Dun, repul&s;ed with di&s;grace. By this time the Scots and French undertook the &s;iege of Haddington, and carried on their operations vigorou&s;ly until the Engli&s;h forces approaching under the command of the earl of Shrew&s;bury, they abandoned the enterprize. The earl, having thrown into the place a &s;upply of men, provi&s;ion, and ammunition, advanced to Mu&s;sle|burgh, where the enemy lay intrenched, and offered them battle; which they not choo&s;ing to accept, he &s;uddenly retired to England. Immediately after his departure, De&s;&s;&eacute;, the French general attempted to &s;urprize Haddington;
<PB N="668" REF="6800">
but the garri&s;on, being &s;ea&s;onably alarmed, obliged him to retreat with great lo&s;s and precipitation, even after part of his troops had entered the town. The Engli&s;h in this place were occa&s;ionally relieved by the garri&s;on of Berwick, until Sir Thomas Palmer, with fifteen hundred hor&s;e, was routed and taken; the greater part of his followers being &s;lain. In order to compen&s;ate for this di&s;a&s;ter the lord Gray entered Scotland by the we&s;t, and ravaged Teviotdal$ and Lidde&s;dale, from whence he carried off great booty. At length, the pro|tector, perceiving that he could not maintain Haddington without expo&s;ing his troops to unnece&s;&s;ary danger, detached the earl of Rutland with &s;ix thou&s;and men to demoli&s;h the fortifications, and bring off the artillery. This &s;ervice was performed without lo&s;s, and the earl, in his retreat to Berwick, laid wa&s;te the country: but, at the &s;ame time, the Scots took the ca&s;tle of Hume by &s;ur|prize, and all the Engli&s;h in the place were either killed or taken.</P>

<P>At this conjuncture a quarrel happened between the pope and the em|peror. Charles prote&s;ted again&s;t the tran&s;lation of the council to Bologna; and the pope rejected his prote&s;t. Then the emperor, to &s;hew his indepen|dence, propo&s;ed articles of accommodation to the prote&s;tants. The&s;e were known by the appellation of Interim, becau&s;e they were no other than expe|dients to be u&s;ed, until a council could be held in &s;ome town of Germany.<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$$$dan.</NOTE> Though the expre&s;&s;ions were $oftened, they at bottom contained almo&s;t all the doctrines of the Roman church: yet they allowed that a man's marriage &s;hould be no objection to his receiving the order of prie&s;thood; and that the communion, in both &s;pecies, &s;hould not be with-held from tho&s;e who might demand it in that manner. This Interim was pre&s;ented in a diet convoked at Aug&s;burg, and enacted into a decree, notwith&s;tanding the prote&s;ts of &s;everal towns of the empire. While the emperor thus endeavoured to cru&s;h the refor|mation in Germany, it gained ground every day in England under the pro|tection of Cranmer and the mini&s;try. The parliament meeting on the twenty|fourth day of November, enacted a &s;tatute, by which prie&s;ts were permitted to marry; a$d by another confirmed the new liturgy, on which commi&s;&s;ioners<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi$t. of the Reformation.</NOTE> had been employed in the &s;ummer.

<P>The protector had nothing more at heart than the progre&s;s of this work, though he was obliged to proceed gradually, becau&s;e the greate&s;t part of the inferior clergy was &s;till attached to the old religion, and he him&s;elf had a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1549$</NOTE> great number of enemies, among whom his own brother was the mo&s;t violent and dangerous. The queen dowager, having died in September of the prece|ding year, the admiral renewed his addre&s;&s;es to the prince&s;s Elizabeth$ but as the will of the late king expre&s;ly excluded her from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hould &s;he marry without the con&s;ent of her father's executors, he contrived a &s;cheme for gratifying his ambition in another manner. He is &s;aid to have formed the de|&s;ign of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the king's per&s;on$ and &s;eizing the reins of government into his own hands: for the execution of which project he had a&s;|&s;embled two thou&s;and men in different places. The council, having received $ome intimation of his practices again&s;t the government, committed him pri|&s;oner to the Tower, and appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to take the depo&s;itions of his accu&s;ers. The&s;e taxed him with having con&s;pired again&s;t the admini&s;tration, protected pyrates, and committed acts of violence again&s;t the &s;ubjects of dif|ferent
<PB N="669" REF="6810">
&s;tates which were at peace with England. The protector, perceiving that his authority would be precarious as long as his brother had any &s;hare in the government, exhorted him to re&s;ign his office and retire from court; but finding him deaf to his remon&s;trance, he re&s;olved to &s;acrifice him to his own &s;af$ty. His accu&s;ation was reduced to three and thirty articles; and certain members of the council were &s;ent to interrogate him on the particulars. He refu&s;ed to an&s;wer, demanding a legal trial, and that he might be brought face to face with his accu&s;ers. Next day the council repaired to the Tower in a body, when he &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on his former demand, which, however, was not granted. Then he de&s;ired they would leave the articles of his accu&s;ation, that he might examine him at his lei&s;ure, and prepare for his defence: this reque&s;t was likewi&s;e denied. The council then re$olved that he &s;hould be condemned in parliament by an act of attainder. In the mean time it appointed com|mi&s;&s;ioners to hear what he had to &s;ay in his own defence. The king was per|&s;uaded to $ignify his di&s;approbation of the admiral; and, the commi&s;&s;ioners making their report, a bill of attainder was brought into the hou&s;e of peers. It accu&s;ed him of an attempt to &s;eize the per&s;on of the king, and the govern|ment of the realm; of laying up great &s;tore of provi&s;ion and money; of en|deavouring to e&s;pou&s;e the lady Elizabeth, and of per&s;uading the king in his tender age to take upon him&s;elf the admini&s;tration of affairs. The bill pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es with very little oppo&s;ition; and received the royal a&s;&s;ent. The admiral was beheaded on the tenth day of March, contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the nation in general, who thought the articles of accu&s;ation frivolous in them|&s;elves;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haywood.

<P>At this juncture the kingdom was expo&s;ed to very dangerous com|motions, which had been brewing &s;ince the late reign. When the mona&s;teries were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, a prodigious number of monks were obliged to earn their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence by their labour; &s;o that every &s;pecies of bu&s;ine&s;s was over&s;tocked. The lands of the mona&s;teries had been formerly farmed out to common people, &s;o as to employ a great number of hands; and, the rents being moderate, they were enabled to maintain their families on the profits of agriculture: but now, the&s;e
<PB N="670" REF="6820">
lands being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the nobility, the rents were rai&s;ed; and the farmers, perceiving that wool was a better commodity than corn, turned all their fields into pa&s;t$re-ground. This practice was attended with divers inconveniences. The price o$ meal increa&s;ed, to the un&s;peakable hard&s;hip of the lower cla&s;s of people; and, as few hands were required to manage pa&s;ture-grounds, a great $umber of poor people was utterly deprived of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; while the nation was filled with murmurs and complaints again&s;t the nobility, who were the &s;ources of this misfortune. The protector e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the &s;ufferers: he appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to examine whether or not the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of church|lands fulfilled the conditions on which tho&s;e lands had been &s;old by the crown; he demoli&s;hed a royal park at Hampton-court, of which the inhabitants of that $i&s;trict complained, and took &s;everal other &s;teps for the relief of the common people. This conduct intailed upon him the hatred of the nobility. In the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament the lords had projected an act, impowering the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of church-lands to farm them in any manner they &s;hould think proper; but the bill was rejected by the lower hou&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, the lords continued to inclo&s;e their grounds, and the pea&s;ants imagined their de&s;ign was to reduce them again to &s;ervitude. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, the common people of Wilt|&s;hire and Somer&s;et&s;hire, a&s;&s;embling in a great body, began to pull down the enclo&s;ures; but they were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed by Sir William Herbert, afterwards earl of Pembroke. In&s;urrections happened at the &s;ame time in Su&s;&s;ex, Hamp|&s;hire, Kent, Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, Warwick&s;hire, E&s;&s;ex, Hertford&s;hire, Leice&s;ter|&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and Rutland&s;hire: the&s;e however were appea&s;ed by the interpo&s;ition of moderate per&s;ons.</P>

<P>This &s;torm was &s;carce overblown, when &s;till more dangerous com|motions were excited in Oxford&s;hire, Devon&s;hire, Norfolk, and York&s;hire. Into the fir&s;t of the&s;e counties the protector detached the lord Gray with fifteen hundred hor&s;e and foot, who, falling upon them, $lew a great number; and of the pri&s;oners divers were executed. The in&s;urgents of Devon&s;hire, amounting to the number of ten thou&s;and, were headed by one Humphrey Arundel, an experienced &s;oldier, and encouraged by the &s;ermons of &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical in|cendiaries. They &s;ent a &s;et of articles to the king, demanding that curates &s;hould admini&s;ter bapti&s;m at all times of nece&s;&s;ity: That their children might be confirmed by the bi&s;hops when&s;oever they &s;hould re&s;ort unto him: That the ma&s;s &s;hould be celebrated without any man's communication with the prie&s;t: That they might have a re&s;erve of the Lord's body in their churches: That they might have holy bread and holy water: That God's &s;ervice might be &s;aid and &s;ung with an audible voice in the choir: That prie&s;ts &s;hould live in celibacy: and, That the &s;ix articles &s;hould be u$ed as they were in the time of Henry, until the king &s;hould be of age. The&s;e demands the mini&s;try an&s;wered by a formal manife&s;to, concluding with an offer of a general pardon, &s;hould they return to their own homes: but the popi&s;h monks among them, who had already converted this rebellion into a religious affair, per&s;uaded them that this lenity was the effect of fear; that the mini&s;try intended to tax their &s;heep and cattle, and rai&s;e an exci&s;e upon all their drink and provi&s;ion. Thus in&s;ti|gated, they undertook the &s;iege of Exeter, which was g$llantly defended by the inhabi$ants. John lord Ru&s;&s;el, privy &s;eal, had been &s;ent again&s;t them with a &s;m$$l body of forces, and t$ken up his quarters at Hon$ton$rom whence he
<PB N="671" REF="6830">
marched to the relief of Ex$ter, in hope of being able to throw &s;uccours into the town: but the in&s;urgents had taken &s;uch precautions as baffled his endea|vours; and, in his retreat, he found him&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed by a great number, through which he fought his way back to Honiton. The citizens of Exeter were reduced to great extremity, when the lord Gray joined the lord Ru&s;&s;el with a &s;trong reinforcement. Then they marched towards Exeter, routed the rebels with great &s;laughter, and relieved the city, which was recompenced for its loyalty with an addition of revenue, and an exten&s;ion of its liberties. The in&s;urgents, not yet di&s;pirited, a&s;&s;embled on Clifton-heath, with a crucifix in a covered waggon, adorned with tapers and trompery; and they were again charged by the lord Gray, who made a terrible carnage. Their ringleaders were taken and hanged, and &s;everal innocent per&s;ons afterwards &s;uffered from the cruelty of Sir Anthony King&s;ton, provo&s;t mar&s;hal of the king's army.</P>

<P>The &s;edition in Norfolk appeared &s;till more terrible. The male|contents increa&s;ed to the number of &s;ixteen thou&s;and, under the conduct of one Kit a tanner, and Coniers an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who performed the office of their chap|lain. They broke down inclo&s;ures, ravaged the country, denounced vengeance again&s;t the gentlemen of the neighbourhood. They pre&s;ented articles of complaint to the king, demanding, That lands and farms &s;hould be reduced to their an|tient rents: That the price of wool &s;hould be lowered: and, That all inclo&s;ures &s;hould be taken away. The king promi&s;ed that all their grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed in parliament; and, in the mean time, offered to indulge them with an amne&s;ty, if they would lay down their arms and di&s;per&s;e. They rejected this proffer with di&s;dain, e&s;tabli&s;hed their head-quarters at Mou&s;hold, where Kit the tanner, and a committee, &s;at in judgment under a large tree, &s;ince known by the name of the Oak of reformation. They undertook the &s;iege of Norwich, which having reduced, they impri&s;oned the mayor and &s;ome of the principal citizens. At length, lord William Parre, marquis of Northampton, taking the field with fifteen hundred men, be&s;ides a &s;mall number of Italian mu&s;queteers under Malate&s;ta, marched directly towards Norwich, which the rebels had eva|cuated. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city without oppo&s;ition; but, the in&s;urgents giving the a&s;&s;ault in the night, were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. In the morning they renewed the attack with &s;uch fury, that they entered the town, and the marquis was obliged to retreat, after lord Sheffield and a good number of his men had been &s;lain in the conflict: for the inhabitants, in general, fa|voured the rebels; and, while the king's troops were engaged with them in the &s;treets, annoyed them from the windows and balconies. This di&s;comfiture of the marquis was no &s;ooner known in London, than the earl of Warwick was &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance with &s;ix thou&s;and infantry, fifteen hundred hor&s;e, and a train of artillery, provided for the war in Scotland. When he arrived at Norwich he &s;$mmoned the rebels to &s;urrender, a&s;&s;uring them they &s;hould have the benefit of a free pardon: but, his propo&s;al being rejected, he planted his artillery again&s;t the town; and, a breach being made, entered by a&s;&s;ault. One hundred and thirty of the in&s;urgents were &s;lain, and &s;ixty being taken, were hanged up immediately by martial law: neverthele&s;s, &s;ome of his waggons falling into the hands of the enemy, &s;upplied them with ammunition, which they began to want. The execution of their confederates &s;erved only to increa&s;e their rage; they poured in like a tide at one of the gates, which was guarded with artillery;
<PB N="672" REF="6840">
and, notwith&s;tanding a very ob&s;t$$ate oppo&s;ition, carried off the canon, together with &s;ome ca$$s of munition: even the boys behaved &s;o de&s;perately on this occa|&s;ion, that they were &s;een to pull out the arrows from their bodies, and deliver them to their own archers. Emboldened by this &s;ucce&s;s they battered the city wall, and then, $torming the breach, were repul&s;ed with great difficulty. Influenced by a &s;uppo&s;ed prophecy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The prophecy ran in this &s;$rai$:
<LG>

</LG></NOTE>, they quitted the hill of Mou&s;hold; and, taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a valley called Du&s;&s;endale, &s;ent a defiance to the earl of Warwick. This nobleman, having received a reinforcement of fourteen hund|red ho$&s;e, &s;ent them another offer of a general pardon, from which, however, &s;ome of their ringleaders were excepted. They refu&s;ing to accept it on the&s;e terms, he ordered his whole cavalry to attack them in the valley, where they were drawn up in &s;ome &s;ort of order, and had placed in the front the gen|tlemen they had taken pri&s;oners, bound in couples, that they might bear the firit brunt of the battle. The king's troops however &s;pared the&s;e unhappy captives, and fell upon the rebels with &s;uch vigour that they were quickly put into di&s;order, and began to fly with great precipitation. The pur&s;uit was con|tinued three miles with &s;uch &s;laughter, that three thou&s;and lay dead upon the &s;pot. Tho&s;e who guarded their artillery and baggage had fortified them&s;elves with waggons and palli&s;adoes, and declared they would fight to the la&s;t drop of their blood; but, upon promi&s;e of pardon from the earl's own mouth, they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.

Kit their ringleader e&s;caped from the field; but, being taken next day in a barn with his brother, was hung in chains on Norwich ca&s;tle; his brother was hanged on Wymondham &s;teeple, and nine of their accomplices &s;uffered on the oak of reformation. While Nor|folk was expo&s;ed to the&s;e commotions a third &s;edition broke out in York&s;hire, where William Ombler, a man of &s;ome di&s;tinction, with Thomas Dale, a pari&s;h clerk, and one Steven&s;on, mi&s;led by a ridiculous prophecy, a&s;&s;embled about three thou&s;and people by ringing bells and firing beacons, as if the coa&s;t had been invaded, and per&s;uaded them to take arms to re&s;tore the church to her an|tient rights, humble the rich, relieve the poor, and redre&s;s the grievances of the nation. They murdered &s;everal per&s;ons out of meer wantonne&s;s; and, marching into the Ea&s;t-Riding, increa&s;ed to a formidable n$mber: but, no &s;ooner was the king's pardon pre&s;ented, than they began to di&s;per&s;e; and, the ringleaders being abandoned, were, with four of their accomplices, executed at York. The&s;e in&s;urrections being quelled, the protector, who had acted during the whole di&s;turbance with remarkable lenity, now publi&s;hed a general amne&s;ty, in order to re&s;to$e the peace of the kingdom; and this indulgence confirmed the ha$red of the nobility which he had already incurred, as well as of &s;ome privy coun&s;ellors, who re$ented his pre&s;uming to act in &s;uch an affair without their co$$urrence.</P>

<P>Henry II. of France, re&s;olving to make advantage of the&s;e di&s;turb|ances, equipped a navy in order to attack a fleet of Engli&s;h &s;hips lying at anchor in the i$land of Jer&s;ey, but they met with &s;uch a warm reception that they thought proper to retire, though not before they had &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable da|mage. Then the French king, entering the Boulonnois, reduced &s;everal ca&s;tles;
<PB N="673" REF="6850">
but was vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed from the fort of Bullenberg, from which, however, the Engli&s;h withdrew their artillery, and blew up the fortifications. In Sep|tember Henry undertook the &s;iege of Boulogne; but, his army being infected with the plague, he him&s;elf retired to Paris, leaving the conduct of the &s;i$ge to Ga&s;par de Coligny, lord o$ Chatillon, who, after &s;ome ineffectual endea|vours, converted the $iege into a blockade. The protector was not a little di&s;turbed by the&s;e ho&s;tilities, e&s;pecially when he under&s;tood that Henry was on the point of concluding an alliance with the prote&s;tants in Germany. The king's coffers were &s;o empty that he could not maintain a war without demand|ing new &s;ub&s;idies, which would excite fre&s;h murmurs among the people; and the &s;ini&s;ter accidents of war might furni&s;h his enemies with pretences for con|demning his conduct: be&s;ides, he fore&s;aw that war would retard the progre&s;s of the reformation. Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he propo&s;ed in council that peace with France &s;hould be procured at the expence of re&s;toring Bou|logne, which co&s;t the kingdom an incredible &s;um of money, and wo$ld be a perpetual bone of contention while it remained in the hands of the Engli&s;h: whereas, by giving it up, they would not only &s;ecure an advantageous peace with France, but al&s;o detach that power from the intere&s;t of Scotland. The council, having taken this propo&s;al into con&s;ideration, determined that Bou|logne &s;hould not be re&s;tored; but that an amba&s;&s;ador &s;hould be &s;ent to con|clude an alliance with the emperor.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Sir William Paget was immediately di&s;patched for this purpo&s;e; and, in the mean time, the protector's enemies employed emi&s;&s;aries to blacken his character. They repre&s;ented him as a parricide, a traitor, and a &s;acrilegious tyrant, who not only betrayed the intere&s;t of his country, but, in order to gra|tify his pride, de&s;troyed churches and tombs, that he might u&s;e the materials for building his own &s;uperb palace. They taxed him with having betrayed the forts in the Boulonnois, by leaving them unprovided for defence; with having abandoned Haddington in Scotland, &s;eized the admini&s;tration into his own hands; rejected the advice of council, mi&s;managed the affairs of govern|ment; and, when Paget returned without having &s;ucceeded in his nego$iation, they affirmed he was in&s;tructed by the protector to avoid an alliance with the emperor, that he might have a pretence for re&s;igning Boulogne. The pro|tector being informed of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, began to be apprehen&s;ive of a de|&s;ign to carry off the per&s;on of the king by corrupting his &s;ervants; and there|fore he employed &s;ome of his own dome&s;tics near his maje&s;ty, with directions to watch over all his actions. On the &s;ixth day of October, the lord St. John, pre&s;ident of the council, the earls of Southampton, Warwick, and Arundel, Sir Edward North, Sir Richard Southwell, Sir Edward Wotton, and Dr. Wotton, dean of Canterbury, repaired to the bi&s;hop of Ely's hou&s;e in Holborn, to hold a council, as if there had been no other members; and the king &s;ending &s;ecretary Petre to know the rea&s;on of their meeting, they detained him to a&s;&s;i&s;t at their deliberations. They began by con&s;idering the &s;tate of the king|dom, and laid the blame of all the di&s;orders which had happened at home, and all the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained abroad, upon the protector. They declared their in|tention was to confer with him on the&s;e &s;ubjects; but, under&s;tanding he had armed his dome&s;tics, and &s;urrounded the king with a guard, they would not expo&s;e them&s;elves to the violence of his de&s;igns. They &s;ent for the mayor,
<PB N="674" REF="6860">
aldermen, and common-council of London, together with the lieutenant of the Tower, and forbad$ them expre&s;ly to acknowledge the duke of Somer&s;et as pro|tector. This la&s;t promi&s;ed to comply with the order; but the others made an equivocal an$wer: though a$l of them &s;eemed to favour the proceedings of this commitee. The protector was no &s;ooner informed of the&s;e tran&s;actions, than he &s;ent the king to Wind&s;or, and armed the inhabitants of that place and Hampton-court for his &s;ecurity: and next day the malecontents were joined by the chancellor, lord Riche, the marquis of Northampton, the earl of Shrew$bury, Sir Thomas Cheney, Sir John Gage, Sir Ralph Sadler, and Sir Edward Montague. Thus reinforced they wrote a letter to the king, com|plaining of the duke of Somer&s;et, and ordered the archbi&s;hop and Paget to take care that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be &s;erved by his own dome&s;tics. On the eighth day of October they repaired to Guildhall, where they declared their &s;ole aim was to deliver the king from the hands of the duke of Som$r&s;et, who minded nothing but his own private advantage; and the burghers of London an&s;wered aloud, that they would &s;upport them to the utmo&s;t of their power.</P>

<P>The duke, finding him&s;elf abandoned by the citizens of London, and the lieutenant of the Tower, was overwhelmed with de&s;pondence: he a&s;|&s;embled tho&s;e members of the council who had not yet for&s;aken him, and of|fered to &s;$bmit to the judgment of any two of them, joined to a like number $f the malecontents. The con&s;equence of this pu&s;illanimous declaration was his being immediately de&s;erted by the lord Ru&s;&s;el, Sir Anthony Brown, Sir Anthony Wingfield, Wentworth, and Baker, &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of com|mons. At length the malecontents declared him unworthy of being protector, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to for the ju&s;tification of their conduct. Then they wrote a letter to the king, importing, That his father had appointed them ex|ecutors of his will and regents of the kingdom: That they had elected the duke of Somer&s;et to exerci&s;e the office of protector, on the expre&s;s condition, that he &s;hould do nothing without their approbation; but, that he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the&s;e $erms, and made him&s;elf ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the government: for which rea&s;on, deeming him unworthy of the tru&s;t, they de&s;ired his maje&s;ty would allow them to execute the office with which they had been inve&s;ted by the late king, and di&s;mi&s;s the troops which the duke of Somer&s;et had a&s;&s;embled about his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and Paget advi&s;ed the king and the duke to comply with the demands of the council, which had already &s;ent deputies to Wind&s;or to prevent the e&s;cape of the protector and &s;ome of his confidents. When Edward &s;ignified his a&s;&s;ent to their propo&s;als they went to him in a body, and met with a gracious reception: all the duke's friends, except Cecil, were &s;ent to the Tower; he him&s;elf, being brought be|fore the council, was accu&s;ed of having violated the condition upon which he was cho&s;en protector: of having treated with amba&s;&s;adors, and di&s;po&s;ed of bi$hoprics and governments by his &s;ole authority: of having held the court of reque&s;ts in his own hou&s;e: of having deba&s;ed the current coin of the kingdom: of having publi&s;hed proclamations touching the inclo&s;ure of lands, contrary to the deliberations of the council: of having neglected to &s;uppre&s;s, and even of having &s;upported and favoured the in&s;urrections: of having neglected to &s;upply the forts of the Boulonnois with provi&s;ion and ammunition, &s;o that they fell into the hands of the enemy: of having endeavoured to prejudice the king again&s;t
<PB N="675" REF="6870">
the members of the council, by fal&s;e in&s;inuations: of having proclaimed them traitors: of having maliciou&s;ly alarmed his maje&s;ty, by &s;ending him &s;uddenly to Wind&s;or, thereby endangering his health: of having armed his own friends and dome&s;tics, while the king's &s;ervants were left defencele&s;s; and of having intended to fly to Jer&s;ey or Guerne&s;ey. On the&s;e articles of impeach|ment, which he had not time to an&s;wer, he was &s;ent to the Tower$ and the council appointed &s;ix lords to act as governors to the king, two at a time offi|ciating alternately. Then the earl of Warwick appeared to be the principal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.</NOTE> promoter of the protector's ruin; for the other members of the council permitted him, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, to a&s;&s;ume the reins of government.</P>

<P>The enemies of the reformation triumphed in the fall of Somer&s;et, per&s;uaded that Warwick was a catholic in his heart, as he maintained &s;uch an intimate corre&s;pondence with the earl of Southampton. Bonner and Gardiner, who continued pri&s;oners in the Tower, wrote letters to him, congratulating him upon his having freed his country from &s;uch a tyrant; and people began to imagine the duke of Norfolk would be &s;et at liberty. They were mi&s;taken in their conjectures; Warwick had no religion but ambition. He knew the young king was &s;trongly attached to the new doctrines, and it was his intere&s;t to gain the favour of his &s;overeign. Bonner was brought before the council, and made acquainted with the &s;ubjects of complaint laid to his charge. He was ordered to preach a &s;ermon in St. Paul's church, maintaining that the authority of a minor king is equal to that of a king come to the age of matu|rity. In his &s;ermon, which was preached before a very numerous audience, he did not once mention the &s;ubject, but expatiated on the real pre&s;ence in the &s;acrament, and inveighed again&s;t tho&s;e who did not believe tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. William Latimer and John Hooper informing again&s;t him, a commi&s;&s;ion was granted to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and Ridley, with the two &s;ecre|taries of &s;tate, and the dean of St. Paul's, to try him in a &s;ummary way. His deportment, when he entered the court, was ridiculou&s;ly extravagant; he pre|tended that he did not &s;ee his judges, until they were pointed out by one of the bye-&s;tanders. When the evidences were examined, he &s;aid one talked like a goo&s;e, and another like a woodcock: he treated the court with contempt, and laughed at the people, calling them fools and dunces; Dr. Hooper, he affirmed, was an a&s;s indeed: he told &s;ecretary Smith that he was a liar; and, being re|primanded by Cranmer, who &s;aid he ought to be &s;ent to pri&s;on for the in&s;o|lence of his behaviour, he replied, that he cared not whither they &s;ent him, provided they did not &s;end him to the devil; but thither he would not go. He &s;aid he had a few goods, a poor carca&s;e, and a &s;oul; the two former were in their power, the la&s;t was in his own. The court was &s;everal times adjourned; at length, finding his defence could not avail him, he appealed to the king, and was &s;ent to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, after having reviled his judges in the mo&s;t abu&s;ive terms. He was again brought before them, and &s;olemnly deprived of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of the Reformation. Act. Pub.</NOTE> bi&s;hopric of London, becau&s;e he had not declared the king's power in his mi|nority, as he was commanded by the protector and council. The earl of South|ampton was &s;o much mortified to find him&s;elf di&s;appointed in the conduct of Warwick, that he retired from court without taking leave, and died of cha|grin at his hou&s;e in the country. Though the earl of Warwick was thus de|livered from an intriguing rival, he found him&s;elf not a little perplexed by

the cond$c$ of $he French king, who per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to recover Bou|logne, which the Engli&s;h were in no condition to relieve. The council &s;ent another emba&s;&s;y to the emperor, de$iring him to take that city under his pro|$$ction; but, he treated the propo&s;al with great indifference, alledging, that he was at peace with France$ and at la&s;t, frankly owning, that they had very li$$le rea&s;o$ to expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, while religion remained on &s;uch a footing in England.

Then a bill of attainder was read in the hou&s;e of lords again&s;t the duke of So$er&s;et, $ounded upon a confe&s;&s;ion &s;igned with his own hand. A deputation of the members was &s;ent to know from his own mouth, whether or not this confe&s;&s;ion had been exto$ted. He thanked them for their candour; owned that $e had voluntarily &s;igned the writing; but &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, that he had never harboured a &s;i$i&s;ter thought again&s;t the king, or commonwealth. In con&s;equence of this confe&s;&s;ion, he was deprived of all his offices; and all his moveables, together with great part of his landed e&s;tate were forfeited for the u&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ac$$ P$b.</NOTE> of his maje&s;ty. His total de&s;truction was prevented by his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive behavi|our, which le$t his enemies no room to pro&s;ecute him further: &s;o that he was re|lea&s;ed from his confinement, after having given &s;ecurity for his future eonduct; and in two months after his enlargement, readmitted to a place in the council. The par$$ament mean while confirmed the new liturgy, decreed, That all the old offices, mi&s;&s;als, and breviaries, &s;hould be delivered to certain commi&s;&s;ion$$$ appointed for that purpo&s;e: That all the prayers addre&s;&s;ed to &s;aints &s;hould be razed out of the books printed in the late reign: and, That all the images taken from churches &s;hould, within a fixed time, be committed to the flames. Then they granted a &s;ub&s;idy, which was followed by an act of amne&s;ty, though the pri&s;oners in the Tower were excluded from it, and the meeting was prorogued t$ll the &s;econd day of February.

<P>The earl of Warwick had been appointed lord high admiral, and great ma&s;ter of the hou&s;ehold, and now directed the council with the mo&s;t ab|$$l$te a$thority. He wanted to purcha&s;e a peace with the French king by the re&s;ti$ution of Bou$$g$e; but, knowing what a l$ad of popular odium the duke $f Som$$&s;et had incurred by making an overt$re of that nature, he em|$$oyed an Ita$ian merc$a$t called Guidatti, who lived at Southampton, to &s;et on $oot the negotiatio$, in &s;uch a manner as would acquit him of all &s;u&s;picion. That for$igner $$paring on &s;ome pretence to Paris, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the hou&s;e o$ the con$table, the great favourite of Henry; and in conver&s;ation with &s;ome of that mi$i&s;ter's off$cers, &s;aid he believed the court of England would w$llingly part w$th Bou$$g$e for a proper con&s;ideration in ready money.

this foreigner, plenipotentiaries were appointed on both &s;ides, and a congre&s;s was opened in the neighbourhood of Boulogne. After &s;ome warm debates, the treaty was concluded on the following terms: That Boulogne &s;hould be re&s;tored to the king of France, who, in con&s;ideration of the improvements made in that fortre&s;s, and the expence of furni&s;hing it with provi&s;ion and muni|tion, &s;hould pay four hundred thou&s;and golden crowns to the king of England: That France and England &s;hould mutually give ho&s;tages for the per|formance of the&s;e articles: That Edward &s;hould re&s;tore to the queen of Scot|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.</NOTE> the two forts of Lauder and Douglas, which &s;hould be demoli&s;hed, to|gether with tho&s;e of Aymouth and Roxburgh, that were likewi&s;e occupied by the Engli&s;h: That the king of England &s;hould de&s;i&s;t from all ho&s;tilities again&s;t Scotland; but, That he &s;hould re&s;erve to him&s;elf the power of pro&s;ecu$$ng all<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> his actions, demands, and preten&s;ions again&s;t France and Scotland; while the French king, and the queen of Scotland &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame privilege with re&s;pect to their demands upon England.</P>

<P>When this treaty was brought over to London, the earl of War|wick feigned him&s;elf &s;ick, that he might not be obliged to &s;ign his name to condi|tions again&s;t which his tongue had formerly exclaimed. He could not, however, elude the reproaches of the public, who plainly perceived, that tho&s;e who ac|cepted of four hundred thou&s;and crowns, in&s;tead of two millions, which Francis I. had engaged to pay, were the very per&s;ons who inveighed &s;o bitterly again&s;t the protector, for barely propo&s;ing the re&s;titution of Boulogne on rea&s;onable terms. This con&s;ideration excited &s;uch murmurs among the people, that the earl of Warwick thought proper to divert their attention to other objects that would con|duce more to their &s;atisfaction. He made an inquiry into the practices of tho&s;e who had embezzled the king's revenue, or been guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion in the exer|ci&s;e of their offices. An additional motive to this inquiry was his de&s;ire to pay the king's debts. Nor did he &s;pare his own friends whom he had u&s;ed as in&s;truments to ruin the duke of Somer&s;et. The earl of Arundel was condemned in a heavy fine; Southwell was committed to pri&s;on; and others purcha&s;ed his forbearance with round &s;ums of money. This &s;everity plea&s;ed the nation in general, and e&s;tabli&s;hed Warwick's authority among the great, who perceiving the vigour with which he acted, began to dread the weight of his re&s;entment. In the cour&s;e of this year, Thirleby re&s;igned the &s;ee of We&s;tmin&s;ter, which was reunited to that of London, and be&s;towed upon Ridley of Roche&s;ter. The bi&s;hopric of Norwich was given to Thirleby; that of Roche&s;ter to Poinet;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. Pub.</NOTE> and John Hooper was created bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter. Polydore Vergil, who had re&s;ided forty years in England, obtained permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s the re&s;t of his days in his own country; and the king allowed him to enjoy his benefices, in con&s;i|deration of his having &s;pent the be&s;t part of his life in compiling the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. $$. 1551.</NOTE> In England the reformation was &s;o agreeable to the young king, that the mini&s;try, in order to gain his favour, countenanced and encouraged it with all their influence, while Cranmer was indefatigable in the &s;ame work. Gardiner was depo&s;ed for the &s;ame rea&s;on on account of which Bonner had been deprived of his bi&s;hopric, and &s;ent back to the Tower, where he remained till the reign of queen Mary. A new confe&s;&s;ion of faith was fini&s;hed by the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for that purpo&s;e, and the new liturgy was in many places corrected. The king, who&s;e under&s;tanding far exceeded his years, began to take cognizance of different affairs. He wrote a journal of all the tran&s;|actions that fell under his ob&s;ervation; and became &s;o zealous for the new reli|gion, that he in&s;i&s;ted upon its being embraced by all his &s;ubjects without di|&s;tinction. The prince&s;s Mary, however, would never conform to the altera|tions which had been made; and her oppo&s;ition &s;ubjected her to many morti|fications from the council, and the king him&s;elf, who&s;e zeal on this occa&s;ion ro&s;e almo&s;t to a &s;pirit of per&s;ecution. His &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth was educated in the principles of the reformation, which was afterwards brought to perfection under her admini&s;tration. The prince&s;s Mary was &s;o alarmed at the in&s;ults &s;he had received, that &s;he re&s;olved to quit the kingdom, and actually concerted a &s;cheme for that purpo&s;e with the gouvernante of the Low Countries; but her de&s;ign was di&s;covered, and mea&s;ures were taken to prevent the execution of it. The earl of Warwick perceiving the king was incen&s;ed again&s;t his &s;i&s;ter Mary, formed a project for excluding her intirely from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to match Eliza|beth in a foreign country, and effect a marriage between one of his own &s;ons and lady Jane Gray, elde&s;t daughter of the earl of Dor&s;et, and Francis Bran|don, who in the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion held the next place to the two daughters of Henry. For this purpo&s;e, the earl of Warwick contracted an intimacy of friend&s;hip with Dor&s;et; and two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive dukes of Suffolk of the family of Brandon being cut off by the &s;weating-&s;ickne&s;s, which now raged in England, the title was conferred upon the earl of Dor&s;et. Yet it will be found difficult to reconcile this project of Warwick to his negotiation for the marriage of the king with the daughter of Henry II. the French monarch. The marquis of Northampton, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and &s;ome other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, were &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to France, with the order of the garter for Henry; and the propo&s;al of a match between his daughter Elizabeth and the king of England. Commi&s;&s;ioners were immediately appointed to treat with them on this &s;ubject, and the treaty was &s;igned at Angers; but Edward died before the prince&s;s

<P>Immediately after the&s;e tran&s;actions, the earl of Warwick was created duke of Northumberland; nor were his intimate friends forgot in this promotion. William Pawlet earl of Wilt&s;hire and lord high trea&s;urer, received the title of marquis of Winche&s;ter, and Sir William Herbert was created earl of Pembroke. The new duke did not think his authority was perfectly &s;ecured during the life of the duke of Somer&s;et, who made great progre&s;s in retrieving the king's favour; and actually began to take mea&s;ures for rea&s;&s;umiug the office of protector. In order to prevent the elevation of &s;uch a powerful rival, Northumberland re&s;olved to ruin him effectually. He found means by artful in&s;inuations to alienate the king's affection from that nobleman; and then by repeated in&s;ults, provoked him to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as furni&s;hed a handle to work his de&s;truction. Somer&s;et's patience being exhua&s;ted, he is &s;aid to have contrived a &s;cheme for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating this trouble&s;ome up&s;tart. One of his confidents, called Sir Thomas Palmer, betrayed his private conver&s;ation, and declared, in the king's hearing, that the duke of Somer&s;et had laid a plan for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the duke of Northumberland, the marquis of Northampton, and the earl of Pembroke. The evidence of this per&s;on, who was a man of an infamous character, was corroborated by the confe&s;&s;ion of one Crane; another of the name of Hammond owned that the duke's chamber had been &s;trongly watched by night at Greenwich; and the lord Strange voluntarily declared, that Somer&s;et de&s;ired he would per&s;uade the king to marry his third daughter, and act as a &s;py about his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. The duke was immediately arre&s;ted, and &s;ent to the Tower, together with the lord Gray, and &s;ome other adherents: next day the dutche&s;s was committed to the &s;ame place, as well as Sir Thomas Holdcro&s;t, Sir Miles Partridge, Sir Michael Stanhope, Wingfield, Banni&s;ter, Vaughan, and many others. The duke of Somer&s;et was &s;oon brought to his trial before the marquis of Winche&s;ter, who &s;at as high &s;teward upon the occa|&s;ion, and the re&s;t of the peers, including the duke of Northumberland, the mar|quis of Northampton, and the earl of Pembroke, who were both parties and judges in this court of judicature. He was accu&s;ed of a de&s;ign to &s;ecure the per&s;on of the king, and rea&s;&s;ume the admini&s;tration of affairs, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the duke of Northumberland, and rai&s;e an in&s;urrection in the city of London. He pleaded Not guilty, and de&s;ired he might be confronted with his accu&s;ers. His reque&s;t was rejected: he was acquitted of trea&s;on, but condemned to death for &s;imple felony, on a &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of Henry VII. declaring it felonious for any per&s;on to harbour the thought of killing a privy coun&s;ellor. This &s;candalous &s;entence being pronounced, Somer&s;et craved pardon of the duke of Northumberland, the marquis of Northampton, and the earl of Pem|broke, for the enmity he had bore them. The populace &s;eeing him reconveyed to the Tower without the ax, which was no longer carried before him, becau&s;e he was condemned to be hanged, imagined he had been intirely acquitted; and in repeated &s;houts and acclamations manife&s;ted their joy, which was &s;oon con|verted into &s;orrow, when they were better informed of his doom.</P>

<P>The nation in general believed he would obtain his pardon; $$t, the $ing's heart was hardened again&s;t him by the arts of the mini&s;ter, $ho prevailed upon one Bartuille to declare to his maje&s;ty, that Somer&s;et had employed him to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the duke of Northumberland. He was even told, that the duke had confe&s;&s;ed the whole &s;cheme, after his condemnation: he was amu&s;ed with diver&s;ions, that his mind might not have lei&s;ure to reflect upon the nature of the trial; he was be&s;ieged in &s;uch a manner, that no friend of his uncle could approach his per&s;on. That unhappy nobleman had indeed inter|e&s;ted the lord Riche the chancellor in his favour; but the corre&s;pondence between them being accidentally di&s;covered, the lord Riche was deprived of the great<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> &s;eal, which was given in charge to the bi&s;hop of Ely. At length, the king &s;igned an order for the execution of his uncle, who, on the twenty-&s;econd day o$ January appeared on the &s;caffold, without the lea&s;t emotion, in the mid&s;t of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1552.</NOTE> a va&s;t concour&s;e of the populace, by whom he was beloved. He &s;poke to them with great compo&s;ure, prote&s;ting his innocence of the crimes laid to his charge; and that he had always promoted the &s;ervice of his king, and the intere&s;t of the true religion to the u$mo&s;t of his power. The people atte&s;ted the truth of what he &s;aid by crying aloud, "It is mo&s;t true:" and when he prayed, that the king might enjoy health and pro&s;perity, there was a general re&s;pon&s;e of Amen. The &s;pectators &s;eemed to be in great agitation, and on the brink of taking &s;ome violent mea&s;ure. Certain people, who had been ordered to a&s;&s;i&s;t in arms at the execution, perceiving, as they approached Tower-hill, that the duke was already on the &s;caffold, mended their pace, crying aloud to each other, "Come "away$" the precipitation with which they advanced, and this exclama|tion, which was ecchoed through the whole multitude, produced an univer&s;al tum$lt. After this had &s;ub&s;ided, Sir Anthony Brown riding towards the &s;ca&s;|fold, the people exclaimed "A pardon, a pardon." But, the duke with great compo&s;ure, a&s;&s;ured them they were mi&s;taken; and intreated them to be quiet, that he might pa&s;s his la&s;t moments in peace. Then he continued his &s;peech; and concluding with a de&s;ire that they would join with him in prayer, &s;ubmitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> to the &s;troke of the executioner. Thus fell the duke of Somer&s;et, a &s;acrifice to the ambition of his rival. He was a nobleman of a middling genius, not without virtues, though warmed by &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, among which vanity, pride, and ambition, &s;eemed to predominate. The people were &s;o well convinced of his innocence, that they looked upon him as a martyr; and dipping handker|chiefs in his blood, pre&s;erved them as precious relics. Sir Ralph Vane, a brave old &s;oldier, and Sir Miles Partridge were hanged, and Sir Michael Stanhope, with Sir Thomas Arundel, beheaded as the duke's accomplices. Vaneencountered death with equal intrepidity and di&s;dain, ob&s;erving, that the time had been when he was of &s;ome e&s;timation, but now the cowardly and courageous were treated alike; and all of them declared, in their la&s;t moments, that they had<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> never offended again&s;t the king, or any of his council.</P>

<P>While the Engli&s;h mini&s;try was intent upon the&s;e tran&s;actions, the emperor's affairs in Germany a&s;&s;umed a new a&s;pect. Maurice elector o$ Saxony entered privately into a league with France, and the prote&s;tants of his own country. He &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to engage Edward in the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociation; and &s;ollicit a &s;upply of four hundred thou&s;and crowns to maintain the intere&s;t
<PB N="681" REF="6930">
of the reformed religion. The mini&s;try gave him to under&s;tand, that the king was not aver&s;e to a league calculated intirely for the &s;ake of religion; but that he would not be concerned in any league or alliance which was concerted on political maxims. Neverthele&s;s, if the elector of Saxony would confer more particularly with the prote&s;tant princes, and then &s;end amba&s;&s;adors &s;ufficiently authori&s;ed to the king, he would return a more po&s;itive an&s;wer. The parlia|ment a&s;&s;embling on the twenty-third of January, a &s;tatute was enacted again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould write or &s;peak evil of the king; but in this act was in&s;erted a clau&s;e, importing, That no per&s;on &s;hould be convicted except upon the evi|dence of two witne&s;&s;es at lea&s;t, to be confronted with the criminal. Then they pa&s;&s;ed an act to authorize the New common prayer-book; another for a&s;certaining the fa&s;ts and holidays; a third for the relief of the poor; a fourth allowing the marriage of the clergy; a fifth again&s;t u&s;ury; and a &s;ixth again&s;t &s;imony. A bill was brought into the hou&s;e of peers, for &s;etting a&s;ide the entail of Somer&s;et's e&s;tate in favour of the children of his fir&s;t marriage, whom he had excluded from his inheritance; but as a clau&s;e of this bill declared, that the late duke and his accomplices had been ju&s;tly condemned, the hou&s;e of commons refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the act until the clau&s;e was removed. In the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion, the duke of Northumberland attempted to de&s;troy Ton&s;tall bi&s;hop of Durham by attainder, on pretence of having concealed a con&s;piracy again&s;t the king; but the commons rejected the bill, beeau&s;e the de&s;ign was to con|demn the bi&s;hop without his being confronted by his accu&s;ers. The duke's aim was to obtain for him&s;elf the dignity of palatine of Durham, which was an|nexed to the bi&s;hopric. But perceiving, that this parliament, which had been elected during the protector&s;hip of Somer&s;et, was not di&s;po&s;ed to comply with all his wi&s;hes, he took care that it &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, and another convoked for the en&s;uing year. In the mean time, he continued to indulge his re&s;entment again&s;t the memory and adherents of the late duke of Somer&s;et. He com|menced a rigorous inqui&s;ition about the lands formerly belonging to the chan|tries, which had been given away during the admini&s;tration of that nobleman: and &s;ome of the new proprietors were condemned in heavy fines, while the re&s;t appea&s;ed him with large &s;ums of money. He conceived a violent antipathy to the lord Paget, who had been always a &s;taunch adherent of Somer&s;et; and that nobleman was not only &s;ubjected to a grievous fine, but even degraded from the order of the garter, on pretence that he was not a gentleman by birth. Thus, the duke at once gratified his re&s;entment, and procured the vacant garter for his own &s;on the lord Warwick. In the cour&s;e of this year, Heath and Day, the bi&s;hops of Worce&s;ter and Che&s;ter, were depo&s;ed on acount of their open oppo&s;ition to the reformed religion. The patents by which the king filled<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;$. of the$ Reform.</NOTE> the vacant bi&s;hoprics, were altered in the form, &s;o as that he was left at liberty to deprive them of their &s;ees, according to his own plea&s;ure, without ob&s;erving the ordinary formalities. The company of German merchants known by the appellation of the Steel-yard, was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed becau&s;e it monopolized the expor|tation of the woollen manufacture; and a project was formed for converting Hull and Southampton into free ports; but, the &s;cheme was never carried into execution. The king of France having declared war again&s;t the emperor, and taken Metz by &s;urprize, the elector of Saxony a&s;&s;embled his troops, and pulling
<PB N="682" REF="6940">
off the ma&s;k, marched directly to In&s;pruck, where he had well nigh taken the emperor, who now found him&s;elf obliged to favour the prote&s;tants, by con&s;enting to the famous edict of Pa&s;&s;au.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1553.</NOTE> The duke of Northumberland found the new parliament as ob|&s;equious as he could have wi&s;hed. They granted a very con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy to the king, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that his finances had been di&s;&s;ipated during the admini&s;tration of Somer&s;et. They &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the bi&s;hopric of Durham, in lieu of which one was founded in the &s;ame place, and another at Newca&s;tle; but, the dignity of palatine was conferred on the duke of Northumberland. Then the parliament was di&s;&s;olved, after a &s;hort &s;e&s;&s;ion of one month; though, dur|ing that time, the mini&s;ter accompli&s;hed the purpo&s;es for which it had been convoked. The king, who had been for &s;ome time indi&s;po&s;ed, in con&s;e|quence of the &s;mall pox, which le$t a di&s;order upon his lungs, &s;igned an order for the vi&s;itation of the churches, that their &s;uperfluous plate and o$$aments might be converted to the u&s;e of the poor; but &s;uch fraud and ex|tortion were practi&s;ed in this inquiry, that the poor reaped very little benefit from the king's charitable intention. His di&s;temper now degenerated into a confirmed con&s;umption; and many people did not &s;cruple to in&s;inuate, that the duke of Northumberland had tampered with his con&s;titution. Edward &s;aw his own danger, and bore the pro&s;pect of death with uncommon fortitude: all the concern he manife&s;ted was for the &s;tate of religion, which he fore&s;aw would be al$ered in the reign of Mary his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He was greatly di&s;turbed by this reflection; and the duke of Northumberland did not fail to feed his di&s;quiet, by de&s;cribing the &s;cenes of per&s;ecution that would be acted under a popi&s;h &s;overeign. His de&s;ign was to pave the way for Edward's &s;etting a&s;ide the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. When the phy&s;icians de&s;paired of the king's life, he was com|mitted to the care of an ob&s;cure woman, who undertook to cure him by means which &s;he would not di&s;cover. No hopes of his recovery now remaining, the duke would no longer delay the marriage of his fourth &s;on lord Guildford Dudley, with the $$dy Jan$ Grey, elde&s;t daughter of the new duke of Suffolk$ and Frances Brandon, mentioned in Henry's will, as next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his own daughters. At the &s;ame time, Jane's &s;econd &s;i&s;ter Catherine e&s;pou&s;ed the lord Herbert elde&s;t &s;on of the earl of Pembroke; and the third was married to Martin Keys the groom-porter.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e knots of intere&s;t being tied, the duke re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity of executing the other part of his project. One day, when the king lamented his &s;i&s;ter's aver&s;ion to the reformed religion, Northumber|land told him there was only way of preventing the misfortunes which threat|ened his country; and that was by excluding the prince&s;s Mary from the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and transferring the crown to lady Jane Grey. He repre&s;ented, that the prince&s;s Elizabeth could not help &s;haring her &s;i&s;ter's fate, becau&s;e the only pretence they could u&s;e again&s;t Mary was illegitimacy; and that equally affected Elizabeth, as the marriages of both their mothers had been declared unlawful by act of parliament. This expedient was well reli&s;hed by Edward. The intere&s;t of religion was his prevailing care, which on this occa&s;ion &s;ur|mounted every other con&s;ideration; and he entertained the mo&s;t tender regard for lady Jane Grey, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the amiable accompli&s;hments of mind
<PB N="683" REF="6950">
and per&s;on. Three of the judges were forthwith ordered to draw up an act of conveyance, transferring the crown to lady Jane Grey upon the death of Ed|ward. They at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to comply with this order, alledging, that in fram|ing &s;uch an act, they &s;hould render them&s;elves liable to the pains and penalties of high trea&s;on, according to act of parliament. The duke of Northumberland was &s;o incen&s;ed at their refu&s;al, that he could hardly refrain from per&s;onal vio|lence. In a word, partly by threats, and partly by letters of pardon granted in their favour by anticipation, they were prevailed upon to draw up the act of conveyance, which was &s;igned by all the other judges$ except Sir James Hales$ and all the members of the privy council, C$anmer him&s;elf not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward.

<P>THE duke of Northumberland carefully concealed the death of Ed|ward, in hope of &s;ecuring the per&s;on of the prince&s;s Mary, who by an order of council had been required to attend her brother in his illne&s;s. She had come as far as Hodde&s;don, within &s;eventeen miles of London, when &s;he received a me&s;&s;age from the earl of Arundel, informing her of Edward's death, and the &s;teps which had been taken to exclude her from the throne. Alarmed at this intelligence, &s;he retired immediately to Kenning-Hall in Norfolk, from whence &s;he &s;ent orders to Sir George Somer&s;et, Sir William Drury, and $ir W. Waldegrave$ to attend her immediately with all the forces they could rai&s;e.
<PB N="685" REF="6970">
Circular letters were di&s;patched to all the great towns and nobility of the king|dom, reminding them of her right, and commanding them to proclaim her without delay. Then &s;he wrote to the council, expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urprize, that as they knew her undoubted right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, they had not made her acquainted with her brother's decea&s;e; and promi&s;ing to take them into favour, provided they would immediately proclaim her in the city of London, and other places, ac|cording to the dictates of their duty. Having taken the&s;e &s;teps, &s;he retired to Framlingham-Ca&s;tle in Suffolk, that &s;he might be near the &s;ea, and e&s;cape to Flanders, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould find her&s;elf hard pre&s;&s;ed. Mean while the duke of Northumberland, who governed the kingdom in the name of the council, being appri&s;ed of Mary's retreat, went with the duke of Suffolk as deputies from the council, to intimate to Jane Grey her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne by vir|tue of an act of conveyance. They found this young lady at Sion-hou&s;e; and when they made her acquainted with the de&s;ign of their vi&s;it, &s;he was over|whelmed with grief and a&s;toni&s;hment. She &s;hed a flood of tears, appeared quite incon&s;olable; and it was not without the utmo&s;t reluctance, that &s;he yielded to the intreaties of Northumberland, Northampton, her own &s;ather and hu&s;band, &s;o far as to accept the crown. At length, however, they extorted her con&s;ent; and next day conveyed her to the Tower. On the tenth day of July &s;he was pro|claimed in London; and the council &s;ent an an&s;wer to Mary's letter, importing, That as &s;he was born of an unlawful marriage, formally di&s;&s;olved by act of par|liament, &s;he ought to drop her preten&s;ions, and acknowledge the &s;overeignty of queen Jane, who had a&s;cended the throne by virtue of the late king's letters|patent.</P>

<P>The people were &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed when they heard this lady proclaimed, that they expre&s;&s;ed no marks of joy and exultation. They could not con|ceive for what rea&s;on king Henry's two daughters were excluded from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and they hated the duke of Northumberland, as the per&s;on who had ruined their darling Somer&s;$t. Nor was their hatred alleviated by the conduct of the duke on this occa&s;ion. A low plebeian having uttered &s;ome &s;arca&s;tic ob&s;ervation upon this unexpected &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he ordered him to be ap|prehended, deprived of his ears, and expo&s;ed in the pillory for his in&s;olence; an act of &s;everity, from which the populace drew an ill omen of the new go|vernment. The duke knew he had incurred the odium of the people, and even of the great. He &s;u&s;pected &s;ome members of the council of aver&s;ion to his per&s;on and mea&s;ures; and for that rea&s;on continued to keep them in the Tower, on pretence of conforming to the practice of the Engli&s;h &s;overeigns, who, with their council, u&s;ed to re&s;ide in the Tower, on their fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. His &s;u&s;picions were not without foundation. The earl of Arundel was attached to the old religion, and hated Northumberland, who had extorted from him a large fine, on pretence that he had di&s;&s;ipated the king's revenues. The other members were di&s;gu&s;ted by his in&s;upportable pride and arrogance; and longed for an opportunity to &s;hake off the yoke of his authority. At pre&s;ent they found them&s;elves in effect pri&s;oners; and were fain to temporize, by a&s;&s;enting to every thing he propo&s;ed. The death of Edward, and acce&s;&s;ion of lady Jane Grey$ were notified to the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors at foreign courts; and Richard Shelly was di&s;patched as envoy, with a letter from Jane to the emperor, offering to re|new the treaty of peace between him and England. Shelly, however, did not

<P>Northumberland under&s;tanding that Mary was jo$ned by John Bour|cher $arl of Bath, Henry Rat$$$$ earl of Su$$ex, the $ons of the lord Wharton, and Morda$$t, Sir Hen$y Bedi$g$$eld, Sir W. D$$ry, Sir Henry Jernegan, and many other per&s;ons of di$tinction; that &s;he had been pr$claimed at Nor|wi$h; and that the people of Norfolk and Suff$$k had ri&s;en in arms for the $$fence of her $laim; he, with the con&s;ent of council, a&s;&s;embled &s;ome troops at Newmarket, &s;et on foot new levies in London, and different parts of the king|dom; and appointed the duke of Suffolk general of the army, becau&s;e he him|&s;elf was afraid to leave the council, of which he had rea&s;on to be jealous. Ne|verthele&s;s, the earl of Arundel, who wanted nothing but an opportunity to act openly in behalf of Mary, made &s;uch remon&s;trances to Jane Grey, touching the military character of the duke of Northumberland, which would &s;trike terror into the hearts of her enemies, that &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon his taking the command of the forces in lieu of her father, from whom &s;he could not part without the utmo&s;t re|luctance. Northumberland could not help complying with her reque&s;t. He &s;et out for the army at Newmarket, attended by his &s;on the earl of Warwick$ tho marquis of Northampton, the earl of Huntingdon, and the lord Grey of Wil|ton; and &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of eight thou&s;and men, with whom he advanced to Bury. Mean while, Mary was joined by the lord Thomas Howard &s;on to the duke of Norfolk, with all the friends of that family. Six &s;hips being ordered by the council to crui&s;e on the coa&s;t of Suffolk, in order to prevent her e&s;cape by &s;ea, were driven by &s;tre&s;s of weather into a port of E&s;&s;ex, where the crews impri&s;oned their commanders, and revolted to Mary. Four thou&s;and men were rai&s;ed in her behalf in Bucks, by Sir Edward Ha&s;tings, the lord Wind&s;or, and Sir Edward Peckham: another body had a&s;&s;embled in Oxford&s;hire, under Sir John Williams; and a third in the county of Nor|thampton, commanded by Sir Thomas Tre&s;ham. Neverthele&s;s, when her<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goo$$$$.</NOTE> friends were informed that the duke of Northumberland had begun his march, &s;ome of them advi&s;ed her to retire into another country; and perhaps &s;he would<NOTE PLACE="marg">B$$n$$.</NOTE> have complied with this advice, had he acted with vigour and di&s;patch. But, in all probability, he perceived marks of di&s;affection among his troops. In&s;tead of marching directly to the enemy, he loitered &s;everal days in the neighbour|hood of Cambridge; and ordered doctor Edwin Sandys vice-chancellor of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">H$$$en.</NOTE> univer&s;ity, to &s;upport the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Jane in a &s;ermon. The doctor preached accordingly, but &s;poke with &s;uch circum&s;pection, that he offended neither party. This was not the ca&s;e with Ridley at London, who preached with more zeal than di&s;cretion; and made &s;o free with the character of Mary, that &s;he never forgave him for the attack.</P>

<P>The duke wrote to the council in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms for a rein|forcement; and they ac$ually offered eight crowns per month, be&s;ides &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to every volunteer who would inli$t in the &s;ervice: but, &s;uch was the general odium again&s;t Northumberland, that few or none would engage even on the&s;e terms; while they crowded to the banners of Mary, and maintained them&s;elves at their own expence. In a little time her army amounted to forty thou&s;and men, and great numbers of people a&s;&s;i&s;ted her with money, plate, and jewels. Their regard for the heir of blood concurred with their dete&s;tation of Northum|berland,
<PB N="687" REF="6990">
to produce a torrent of popularity in her favour. The earls of Arundel and Pembroke, finding them&s;elves &s;till detained in the Tower under the in&s;pection of the duke of Suffolk, who was in&s;tructed by Northumberland to watch their con|duct, took an opportunity from that duke's pre&s;&s;ing letters to propo&s;e, that as the French amba&s;&s;ador was aver&s;e to enter the Tower, they &s;hould meet him at Bay|nard's-Ca&s;tle, a hou&s;e belonging to the earl of Pembroke, where they might confer with him, and take mea&s;ures for bringing over a body of troops which had been rai&s;ed by the direction of the duke, for the &s;ervice of queen Jane. Suffolk a&s;|&s;enting to the propo&s;al, they invited to the place all the noblemen about Lon|don who were thought well affected to Mary; and when they met, the earl of Arundel made a &s;peech in favour of that prince&s;s, propo&s;ing that &s;he might be proclaimed queen of England. This motion being &s;econded by the earl of Pembroke, who laid his hand upon his &s;word, and declared he would defend her again&s;t all opponents, the whole a&s;&s;embly a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al. They forthwith &s;ent for the lord mayor and aldermen, and informed them of the re&s;o|lution which had been taken: then mounting their hor&s;es, they rode to the cro&s;s in Cheap&s;ide, where Mary was proclaimed queen of England, by Sir Chri&s;topher Barker principal king at arms: Te Deum was &s;ung in the cathe|dral at St, Paul's; and the event was celebrated with all manner of rejoicings u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The earl of Arundel and lord Paget were di&s;patched to Framlingham-Ca&s;tle, to give the queen an account of the&s;e proceedings. Some companies took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Tower without oppo&s;ition. Lady Jane Grey re&s;igned her royalty with marks of real &s;atisfaction; and retired with her mother to their own habitation.</P>

<P>The duke of Suffolk acquie$ced in all the&s;e tran&s;actions; and next day that nobleman, with archbi&s;hop Cranmer, chancellor Goodricke, the marquis of Winche&s;ter, and the re&s;t of the council, &s;igned an order to the duke of Nor|thumberland, to di&s;band his forces, and behave him$elf like a dutiful &s;ubject to queen Mary. He had already been informed of this &s;udden revolution; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the remainder of his army, which had been greatly reduced by de&s;ertion. His fir&s;t intention was to quit the kingdom immediately, but being prevented by the band of pen&s;ioners, who told him, he mu&s;t &s;tay to ju&s;tify their conduct, he endeavoured to recommend him&s;elf to Mary by extravagant de|mon&s;trations of zeal for her &s;ervice. He repaired to the market-place in Cam|bridge, and proclaiming her queen of England, threw up his cap in token of joy. But, he reaped no advantage from the&s;e exterior marks of attachment. Next day, he was arre&s;ted in the queen's name by the earl of Arundel, at who&s;e feet $e fell down upon his knees, begging his protection in the mo&s;t abject terms of &s;upplication. His three &s;ons, the lord Warwick, Ambro&s;e, and Hen|ry, his brother Sir Andrew Dudley, Sir John, and Sir Henry Gates, Sir Tho|mas Palmer, and doctor Sandys, &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and were committed to the Tower of London. It was on this occa&s;ion that a woman, approaching the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amba&s;&s;. de Noailles.</NOTE> duke in his way to pri&s;on, pre&s;ented an handkerchief which &s;he had dipped in the blood of the duke of Somer&s;et; and upbraided him with the ruin of that innocent nobleman. About the &s;ame time, the earl of Huntingdon, the mar|quis of Northampton, the lords Ha&s;tings, and Robert Dudley, Sir Robert Corbet$ and bi&s;hop Ridley, were likewi&s;e taken into cu&s;tody: as were the duke

<P>On the third day of April the queen made her entry into London, ac|companied by her &s;i&s;ter Elizabeth, who had joined her on the road with a thou|&s;and hor&s;e rai&s;ed for her &s;ervice. When &s;he arrived at the Tower &s;he relea&s;ed the duke of Norfolk, the dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et, the bi&s;hops Gardiner and Bonner, and the lord Edward Courtenay, &s;on and heir of the marquis of Exeter, a young nobleman, whom, in a few days &s;he created earl of Devon&s;hire. Thus Mary became mi&s;tre&s;s of the realm without blood&s;hed; though &s;he owed her &s;ucce&s;s, in a great mea&s;ure, to the popular hatred which the duke of Nor|thumberland had incurred: but &s;he forgot the good offices of the Suffolk peo|ple$ who had fir&s;t declared in her favour, on the expre&s;s promi&s;e of being in|du$ged with liberty of con&s;cience. She was indeed a bigot to her religion in the mo&s;t gloomy &s;en&s;e; and her attention, during her whole reign, was en|gro&s;&s;ed by the eager de&s;ire of re&s;toring the papal power in England, and of gratifying her revenge again&s;t tho&s;e who were aver$e to her principles and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. She propo&s;ed in council to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the catholic religion at once, and &s;end for cardinal Pole, in quality of pope's legate. Gardiner dreaded the effects of &s;uch a &s;udden change, and fore&s;aw that cardinal Pole, who was not his friend, would &s;oon &s;uper&s;ede his influence with the queen. He therefore privately &s;ent an expre&s;s to the emperor, repre&s;enting that the queen's propo&s;al was dangerous, becau&s;e the Engli&s;h people could not be brought all at once to recognize the papal authority, and the zeal of the cardinal would produce dangerous convul&s;ions in the kingdom: that, on the contrary, every thing would &s;ucceed to the &s;atisfacti$n of her maje&s;ty and the advantage of religion, provided &s;he, the queen, would appoint him chancellor, that he might be ve&s;ted with authority &s;ufficient to manage &s;uch a delicate affair, and execute the &s;cheme which he had projected. Charles was &s;o convinced of the &s;olidity of his remon&s;trance, that he wrote to Mary, exhorting her to moderate her zeal, and li&s;ten to the advice of Gardiner, to whom &s;he at length committed the great &s;eal of England, even before his pardon was expedited: &s;o that he &s;at as judge in chancery, while he him&s;elf was under &s;entence of death.</P>

<P>On the eighteenth day of Augu&s;t, the duke of Northumberland was brought to his trial in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, Thomas duke of Norfolk, &s;itting as high &s;teward. He de&s;ired to know, whether a man, acting by orders under the g$tat &s;eal, could be ju&s;tly charged with trea&s;on for the&s;e actions? and, whether tho&s;e, who were at lea&s;t equally culpable, could &s;it as his judges? The high &s;teward replied, That the great &s;eal of an u&s;urper could be no warrant; and, that any per&s;on, again&s;t whom there was nothing upon record, was reputed, in law, capable of &s;itting on any trial. From this la&s;t an&s;wer, which is &s;o repugnant to common &s;en&s;e, the duke fore&s;aw that any objection he could make would be over|ruled; $e therefore confe&s;&s;ed the indictment, and referred him&s;elf to her maje&s;ty's mercy. His example, in this particular, was followed by the earl of Warwick and the marquis of Northampton, who were tried at the &s;ame tribunal; and all three were condemned to death as traitors. Sir John and Sir Henry Gates, Sir<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Andrew Dudley, and Sir Thomas Palmer, pleaded guilty, and underwent the &s;ame &s;entence. The duke con&s;e&s;&s;ed on the &s;caff$ld, that he had been always a
<PB N="689" REF="7010">
Roman catholic in his heart, and expre&s;&s;ed great &s;orrow for having plundered the effects of the church, e&s;pecially as he could not now make re&s;titution. He is &s;aid to have been amu&s;ed with a promi&s;e of pardon, in con&s;equence of which he made this confe&s;&s;ion: if that was the ca&s;e he was mi&s;erably deceived, and died unregretted by both parties; Gates and the infamous Palmer &s;uffered death, but the other condemned per&s;ons were fir&s;t reprieved, and afterwards pardoned. When the ob&s;equies of Edward were performed in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, the new mini&s;ters propo&s;ed to u&s;e the old office, which had been aboli&s;hed; but Cranmer oppo&s;ed this de&s;ign with great vehemence, and, in per&s;on, eelebrated the &s;ervice according to the new liturgy.</P>

<P>Though the queen declared in council, that &s;he would not force the con&s;ciences of her &s;ubjects, &s;he favoured the Roman catholics &s;o openly, that they did not &s;cruple to &s;ay in public, their religion would &s;oon be re|e&s;tabli&s;hed. Bonner's chaplain, Bourn, preaching in St. Paul's church, ex|tolled his ma&s;ter with &s;uch extravagant encomiums, and mentioned king Ed|ward in &s;uch contemptuous terms, that his audience, being incen&s;ed at his in&s;o|lence, began to pelt him with &s;tones, and handled him &s;o roughly that he would have lo&s;t his life, had not he been protected by Bradford and Rogers, two prote&s;tant mini&s;ters. The queen afterwards publi&s;hed a proclamation, profe&s;&s;ing the faith in which &s;he had been educated; but promi&s;ed that no per&s;on &s;hould be puni&s;hed for religion, until it &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parliament. In the mean time &s;he forbad all unlawful a&s;&s;emblies, and all per&s;ons were prohibited from preaching without licences. She declared that no man &s;hould be puni&s;hed for the la&s;t rebellion without her own expre&s;s order; but that &s;he would puni&s;h &s;everely all tho&s;e who &s;hould promote &s;uch pernicious de&s;igns for the future. The inhabitants of Suffolk, tru&s;ting to the verbal promi&s;e of her maje&s;ty, did not &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erve the injunctions in this proclamation; and, an order being &s;ent to their magi&s;trates to puni&s;h the delinquents with the utmo&s;t rigour of the law, they &s;ent deputies to court, to remind the queen of her promi&s;e: but their remon&s;trance was treated with great contempt, and one of their deputies placed in the pillory for the freedom of his expo&s;tulation. Bradford and Rogers were con&s;ined on account of their popularity. Bonner, Gardiner, Ton&s;tal, Heath, and Day, were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the dioce&s;es of which they had been deprived. Hooper, bi&s;hop of Glou|ce&s;ter, and Coverdale of Exeter, with &s;everal other prote&s;tant divines, were impri&s;oned, becau&s;e they would not &s;ubmit to Gardiner, who was impowered by the queen to grant licences for preaching. Divine &s;ervice was openly cele|brated in the old manner, though contrary to the laws &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. Judge Hales was fined in a thou&s;and pounds for having directed the judges of Kent to con|form to the laws of Edward, which had not been repealed. Montague was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office, which was be&s;towed on Bromley, a papi&s;t. Peter Martyr, profe&s;&s;or of theology at Oxford, underwent &s;uch in&s;ults from the enemies of the reformation, that he was obliged to take &s;helter in Cranmer's hou&s;e; though that prelate was in no condition to protect him&s;elf, for the court had already doomed him to de&s;truction.</P>

promi&s;ed to make a public re$$ntation of his errors. Cranmer, in order to vindi$$te him&s;elf from this a$per$$on, drew up a declaration of his faith, which he offered to maintain in public, with the queen's permi&s;&s;ion. On account of this writing, which was publi&s;hed without his knowledge, he was &s;ummoned to the Star-chamber, where he owned him&s;elf the author of the paper; and was$ for that day, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Some of the council advi&s;ed the queen to treat $word$ gently, as he had always been remarkable for the mildne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition. $word$ &s;poke in his favour, becau&s;e he knew that the archbi&s;hopric would $e given to cardinal Pole, &s;hould the &s;ee be vacated. The queen her&s;elf, for|getting that Cranmer had interpo&s;ed in her behalf, when her father intended to have &s;acrificed her to his re&s;entment, re&s;olved to r$in him effectually. She remembered nothing of Cranmer, but that he had pronounced her mother's $iv$$c$$ and promoted the reformation. He was &s;ummoned to appear before the council, together with old Latimer, which la&s;t was &s;ent directly to the Tower, and next day he was followed by Cranmer, on pretence that he had<NOTE PLACE="marg">H $word$ of the $word$.</NOTE> been gu$$ty of trea&s;onable practices, and publi&s;hed &s;editious libels. Several other preachers were impri&s;oned at the &s;ame time: Peter Martyr, John La&s;co, and all the foreign prote&s;tants, who had taken refuge in England, were allowed to quit the kingdom in peace; a good number of the Engli&s;h, who profe&s;&s;ed the reformed religion, fore&s;eeing a per&s;ecution, withdrew into foreign coun|tries on pretence of being natives of France, until orders were &s;ent to all the &s;ea-ports, that no per&s;on &s;hould be allowed to leave the kingdom on that pre|tence, without producing a pa&s;&s;port, &s;igned by the French amba&s;&s;ador.</P>

<P>The queen now re&s;olved to recompence tho&s;e noblemen who had exerted them&s;elves vigorou&s;ly in her favour. The earl of Arundel was appointed lord &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, Sir Edward Ha&s;tings was made ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, and afterwards a peer of the realm. The earl of Su&s;&s;ex was created a knight of the garter, with the particular privilege of appearing covered in the queen's pre&s;ence. Lord Paget was re-admitted into that order; Francis ear$ of Shrew&s;bury was appointed pre&s;ident of the north; Sir John Williams promoted to a peerage, and afterwards to the office of chamberlain to the hou&s;ehold; Sir Henry Jernegan was con&s;tituted captain of her guard, which was increa&s;ed with the addition of four hundred men; and Sir Thomas Tre&s;ham was created lord Prior of the order of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, which was now revived; con&s;e|quently he took rank as the fir&s;t baron of England. Thomas lord Delaware,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> Sir William Drury, and Sir Richard Southwell, were gratified with pen&s;ions. The queen promoted her chaplain Hopton to the &s;ee of Norwich, appointed Englefield ma&s;ter of the wards, Roche&s;ter comptroller of the hou&s;ehold, and Waldgrave ma&s;ter of the wardrobe. On the fir&s;t day of October Mary was crowned by the hands of Gardiner bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; and &s;he that &s;ame day publi&s;hed an amne&s;ty, from the benefit of which, however, all tho&s;e who had been arre&s;ted before the month of September, and many others, were no|minally excluded. Then Mary, with a view to ingratiate her&s;elf with her &s;ub|jects, and di&s;po&s;e the people to return members of parliament who &s;hould act agreeably to her intention, remitted the &s;ub&s;idies which had been granted for the payment of Edward's debts: but, immediately after this popular act, &s;he re-e&s;tabli&s;hed John We&s;ey in the &s;ee of Exeter, which he had re&s;igned in the

<P>The next care of the mini&s;try was to pack a parliament that &s;hould be favourable to their de&s;igns; and &s;uch &s;candalous methods were taken for this purpo&s;e, that although the prote&s;tants were much more numerous than the papi&s;ts in England, almo&s;t all the members of the hou&s;e of commons were roman catholics; in the hou&s;e of lords the queen had a great majority; for even the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e noblemen, who had profe&s;&s;ed the reformed re|ligion in the reign of Edward, now infamou&s;ly conformed to the court-doc|trines, from motives of intere&s;t and ambition. All the prote&s;tant bi&s;hops were either impri&s;oned or depo&s;ed, except Taylor of Lincoln, and Harley of Here|ford; and the&s;e were expelled from the hou&s;e of peers on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to kneel at the ma&s;s. The only &s;tatutes enacted in this &s;hort &s;e&s;&s;ion, were, an act to limit all trea&s;ons to the ca&s;es &s;pecified in a former &s;tatute on the &s;ame &s;ubject in the reign of Edward the Third; and another, to repeal the act of attainder pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the marchione&s;s of Exeter, who&s;e &s;on, the earl of Devon&s;hire, was now re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the honours of his family. The two hou&s;es, meeting again on the twenty-fourth of October, after a very &s;hort prorogation, pa&s;&s;ed an act for rever&s;ing the &s;entence of di|vorce between Henry VIII. and Catherine of Arragon, and for repealing all the acts by which that &s;entence had been confirmed. By this law the prince&s;s Elizabeth was again declared illegitimate; and Mary, having no further occa&s;ion for her concurrence, treated her with har&s;hne&s;s and even cruelty. Before the meeting of the parliament &s;he had, by dint of importunity, prevailed upon Elizabeth to accompany her to ma&s;s, that the people might think &s;he did no|thing without the concurrence of the pre&s;umptive heir; but now that &s;he was rendered incapable of &s;ucceeding the queen, &s;he withdrew from her all marks of affection or regard. An act was pa&s;&s;ed for aboli&s;hing all the laws which Ed|ward had made touching religion; and all form of public wor&s;hip was prohi|bited, except that which had been u&s;ed at the end of Henry's reign. Another &s;tatute decreed rigorous penalties again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould maltreat eccle&s;ia&s;tics on the &s;core of the re-e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ervice, or profane the Euchari&s;t, or pull down cro&s;&s;es, crucifixes, and images. Then the parliament renewed an act of the la&s;t reign, making it fel#ny for twelve people, or any greater number, to a&s;&s;emble with a view of changing the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; and repealed the act of attainder, which had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the duke of Norfolk.</P>

<P>On the third day of November, the lady Jane Grey, her hu&s;band lord Guildford Dudley, his two brothers, and archbi&s;hop Cranmer, were brought to trial; and, confe&s;&s;ing their indictments, were condemned to death for levying war again&s;t the queen, and con&s;piring in favour of an u&s;urper. Yet the &s;ee of Canterbury was not declared void, becau&s;e Mary intended that Cranmer &s;hould be depo&s;ed in a canonical manner; and, to make a merit of pardoning his trea&s;on again&s;t her&s;elf, while &s;he re&s;olved that he &s;hould &s;uffer death as an heretic. Mean while the revenues of the archbi&s;hopric were &s;e|que&s;tred; and the prelate, with the other convicts, &s;ent back to the Tower. Upon the death of Edward, cardinal Brandini, the pope's legate at Bru&s;&s;els,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu$n$$</NOTE> had &s;ent over an agent, who&s;e name was Commendoni, to &s;ound the inclinations of Mary; who told him that her intention was to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the papal autho|rity
<PB N="692" REF="7040">
in England, and de&s;ired that his holine&s;s would &s;end over cardinal Pole as his legate. At the &s;ame time &s;he exhorted Commendoni to continue the di&s;|gu$$e in which $e had come to England, that her de&s;igns might not be too $word$ divulged. The pope, being made acquainted with her de&s;ire, advi&s;ed with his con&s;i&s;tory, which declared that it would not be for the honour of the holy &s;ee to &s;end over a legate until one &s;hould be demanded in form; but the pope, giving them to under&s;tand that he knew more than he thought p$oper to di&s;clo&s;e on that &s;ubject, they a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The nomination of Pole to this office was equally di&s;agreeable to the $$peror and bi&s;hop Gardiner. Charles had projected a match between his &s;on Philip and Mary, and was apprehen&s;ive of the &s;cheme's mi&s;carrying by the i$$$rpo&s;ition of Pole, whom, it was reported, the queen intended to take for her hu&s;band: Gardiner, on the other hand, fore&s;aw that this legate would &s;tep between him and the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury; and, in all probability, de|&s;t$$y his influence at court. He therefore repre&s;ented to the queen, that Pole would r$in her in$entions in favour of the roman catholic religion, by his un|&s;$$$onable $eal. The emperor wrote to her on the &s;ame &s;ubject in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, and propo&s;ed the marriage between her and his &s;on Philip prince of Spain, of which &s;he perceived all the advantage, and accordingly embraced the propo&s;al. She likewi&s;e wrote to Pole, who had been detained in his journey to England by the emperor's order, that the intere&s;t of religion would not per|mit him to come over immediately to England, where the people were not yet properly di&s;po&s;ed to recognize the pope's authority: neverthele&s;s, &s;he carried on a litera$y corre&s;pondence with the cardinal, who advi&s;ed her to reconcile her kingdom at once to the holy &s;ee, without regarding the murmurs of the peo|ple. Gardiner $$renuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this council, alledging that the marriage ought to be concluded before a total re-union with the Roman &s;ee, becau&s;e in that ca&s;e her mea&s;ures would be &s;upported by a powerful alliance. Gardiner de&s;pi&s;ed Pole as a $$$llow politician, and the cardinal looked him upon as a man of intrigue, who made religion &s;ub&s;ervient to his own intere&s;t: in a word, they ha$ed one another. The commons, being informed of the intended match, &s;ent the &s;peaker, with a deputation of twenty members, to &s;upplicate the queen that &s;he would not give her hand to any foreign prince; and &s;he, per|ceiving &s;he had nothing to expect from them, unle&s;s &s;he would give them &s;atis|faction in this particular, immediately di&s;&s;olved the parliament. During the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, the convocation, fitting as u&s;ual, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the doc|trine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, which was oppo&s;ed by &s;ix deputies only, and three of the&s;e maintained a public di&s;pute again&s;t the real pre&s;ence in the Euchari&s;t; but they were reviled, threatened, in&s;ulted, and interrupted in their arguments; and the victory was of cour&s;e adjudged to their adver&s;aries: for, by this time, one hundred and &s;ixty benefices had been be&s;towed upon the creatures of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> court; &s;o that there were very few prote&s;tants in the lower hou&s;e of con|vocation.</P>

<P>Immediately after the ratification of this treaty, which brought no advantage to England, though it &s;trengthened the hands of a popi&s;h mini&s;try, the queen pardoned the marquis of Northampton, who had been condemned with the duke of Northumberland; and &s;u&s;pended the effect of the acts of par|liament which had been made to the di&s;advantage of the monopolizing company of German merchants. The marriage was univer&s;ally di&s;liked by the people, who were afraid of Philip's introducing into England the arbitrary maxi$s of the Spani&s;h government. The whole nation was filled with murmurs and di&s;|content, which at length degenerated into a con&s;piracy: at lea&s;t the Spani&s;h

match was the pretence for countenancing a rebellion contrived by the duke of Suffolk, Sir Pe$er Carew of Devon&s;hi$e, and Sir Thomas Wyat of Kent, tho$ their intention was cert$inly to depo&s;e Mary, and re&s;tore the lady Jane Grey to the throne of England. Carew's de&s;ign being di&s;covered, and one of his ac|comp$$c$s arre&s;ted, he e&s;caped to the conti$ent; while Wyat, in apprehen&s;ion of being detected, ha$tened the execution of his project. He a&s;&s;embled a &s;mall number of people, and proclaimed at Maid&s;tone, that his intention was to prevent the kingdom from being en$laved by the Spaniards. Then he repaired to Roche&s;ter, and fortified the bridge with &s;ome pieces of cannon. The queen, a$armed at this revolt, which &s;he was in no condition to &s;uppre&s;s, as &s;he had $word$ her army, &s;ent an herald with offers of pardon to the rebels, if they would $ay down their arms and &s;ubmit. This offer being rejected, &s;he ordered $$e duke of Norfolk to march again&s;t them at the head of her guards, reinforced by five hundred Londoners, commanded by one Bret; and, in the mean time, the $$eriff of Kent, rai&s;ing a po&s;&s;e, encountered one Knevet, in his mar$h to join Wyat, and routed him at the fir&s;t on&s;et. Sir George Harper, one of $yat's parti$ans, feigning to defert to the duke of Norfolk, per&s;uaded Bret with his Londoners to join the rebels; and their example was followed by the majority of the guards: &s;o that Norfolk, Arundel, and Jernegan, betook them|&s;elves to $$ight, while their baggage and artillery fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XVI.</HEAD>
<P>Wyat, thus reinforced to the number of four thou&s;and men, began his march for London. Being met at Deptford by two deputies whom the queen had &s;ent to know his intention, he demanded for him&s;elf the government of the Tower and the guard of the queen's per&s;on, and in$i&s;ted upon the coun|cil's being changed at his di&s;cretion. The&s;e extravagant demands the queen in per&s;on reported to the citizens of London a&s;&s;embled in Guildhall, de&s;iring their a$$i&s;tance again&s;t the traitor; and declaring &s;he would take up her habi|$$tion within the city, to manife&s;t the confidence &s;he repo&s;ed in their loyalty and affection. Mean while &s;he armed a body of five hundred men, chiefly foreigners, for the defence of the bridge. Wyat, on the third day of Febru|ary, arrived in Southwark: but, finding the bridge &s;ecured again&s;t him, he marched along the river Thames to King&s;ton; and, though the bridge at that place was cut down, and the oppo$ite bank guarded by a &s;mall number of men, he repaired the breach, and pa&s;&s;ed with his army, by this time increa&s;ed to &s;ix thou&s;and. Then he proceeded directly to London; and, on the fifth day of the mo$th in the morning, reached Hyde-park, where he was de&s;erted by many of his followers, and, among the re&s;t, by Sir George Harper; who, in order to make &s;ome amends for his trea&s;on, di&s;clo&s;ed the whole &s;cheme to her maje&s;ty. Wyat, leaving his artillery and the greate&s;t part of his followers in Hyde-park, advanced at the head of the re&s;t into We&s;tmin&s;ter, repul&s;ed Sir John Gage with the guards at Charing-cro&s;s; and, continuing his march thro' the Strand and Fleet-&s;treet, found Ludgate &s;trongly barricaded and well guarded again&s;t his entrance. Being refu&s;ed admittance he wheeled about, in order to retire; but, by this time, the earl of Pembroke had a&s;&s;embled a good number of hor&s;e and foot, and, by means of chains and barricadoes, inter|cepted his retreat. Then his courage began to fail him. Clarencieux the

herald coming with a me&s;&s;age from the queen, and exhorting him to de&s;erve her clemency by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he &s;urrendered him&s;elf to Sir Maurice Berkeley, and all his followers laid down their arms.</P>

<P>The duke of Suffolk had retired to Warwick&s;hire, where he was di&s;covered to have had a &s;hare in this con&s;piracy, by an intercepted letter from Wyat; and the earl of Huntingdon received an order to arre&s;t him. The duke being informed of this circum&s;tance, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his followers, and con|cealed him&s;elf at the hou&s;e of one Underwood, his own ranger, who ba&s;ely be|trayed him to the earl, by whom he was conveyed to the Tower of London. This con&s;piracy proved fatal to lady Jane Grey, to whom Dr. Feck$$m, dean of St. Paul's, was &s;ent with a me&s;&s;age from the queen, de&s;iring that &s;he and her hu&s;band &s;hould prepare for immediate death. She received this notice with marks of real joy; and, when Fecknam exhorted her to embrace the catholic religion, &s;he told him &s;he had no time to enter into religious controver&s;ies. He, mi&s;taking her meaning, prevailed upon the queen to reprieve her for three days longer; but, when &s;he was informed of this re&s;pite, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him it was f$r from being agreeable to her wi&s;hes. Then he di&s;puted with her on dif|ferent points of doctrine, concerning which &s;he argued with uncommon &s;trength of rea&s;on, di&s;playing a &s;urpri&s;ing fund of knowledge. Her hu&s;band had ob|tained leave to take his la&s;t forewell of h$$, but &s;he would not con&s;ent to &s;uch an interview, left it &s;hould &s;hake their mutual fortitude: &s;he, neverthele&s;s, viewed him through the window as he went to execution, and even &s;aw his headle&s;s body brought back in a cart, to be interred in the Tower chapel. She her&s;elf, in two hours after his execution, &s;uffered on a &s;caffold within the for|tre&s;s, left her fate &s;hould excite dangerous commotions among the populace. The lieutenant of the Tower bogging &s;he would favour him with &s;ome me|morial, &s;he pre&s;ented him with tablets, in which &s;he had written three &s;hort &s;entences in the Greek and Latin languages, declaring her own innocence. In her way to the &s;caffold &s;he faluted the &s;pectators with equal affbility and com|po&s;ure, holding Fecknam by the hand. When &s;he reached the &s;cene of her &s;uffering, &s;he embraced him affectionately, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;God will require you, good Sir, for your humanity to me: though it gave me more unea&s;ine&s;s than all the terrors of approaching death.&endq;</Q> Then turning to the &s;pectators, &s;he ob&s;erved that innocence was no excu&s;e for facts that tended to the prejudi$e of the public. Having &s;pent a little time in devotion, her female attendants took off her gown and the ornaments of her head and neck, and covered her eyes with an handkerchief. Thus prepared, &s;he laid her head on the block, and encouraged the executioner, who he&s;itated to do his office; which at length he performed: her fate drawing tears from the eyes of all the &s;pectators, even tho&s;e who were zealou&s;ly attached to queen Mary. Her death was followed by the execution of Wyat's accomplices. Twenty gibbets were erected in different parts of the city, and on the&s;e fifty rebels were hanged.</P>

Of &s;ixteen thou&s;and inferior eccle&s;ia&s;tics, two thirds were deprived of their be|nefices, on account of their being married; and the ma&s;s was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in all churches, together with the liturgy u&s;ed in the latter part of Henry's reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">B$$net.</NOTE> The parliament which was now a&s;&s;embled was even more complai&s;ant than the la&s;t; becau&s;e Gardiner had di&s;tributed among the electors a great part of the money he received from the emperor. The fir&s;t act of the &s;e&s;&s;ion imported, That the prerogative royal was attached to the per&s;on who enjoyed the crown, whether male or female; and con&s;equently that the queen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the rights of her progenitors, according to the con&s;titution of England. The in|tention of this act, planned by Gardiner, was to hinder Philip from taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the admini&s;tration, and rendering him&s;elf ab&s;olute in England. A &s;cheme of government had been projected, for ab&s;olving Mary of all re&s;tric|tions, on the ridiculous pretence, that all the laws enacted for limiting the prerogative, had alluded to kings only; and that &s;he, being a queen, was not bound by &s;uch re&s;traints. This projector had been encouraged by the empe|ror's amba&s;&s;ador; and, at the &s;ame time, the Spaniards affected to publi&s;h a genealogy of Philip, deducing him in a direct line from John of Ghent, duke of Lanca&s;ter; as if he had intended to avail him&s;elf of that title in his efforts to en&s;lave the Engli&s;h nation. The parliament re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the bi&s;hopric of Durham, which had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the late reign; it confirmed the &s;en|tence again&s;t the duke of Suffolk and tho&s;e who had been lately executed, and approved the treaty of marriage between the queen and Philip. Towards the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion a new conference was appointed at Oxford, on the &s;ubject of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. As the prote&s;tants complained of the manner in which the la&s;t di&s;pute on that &s;ubject had been carried on, the court ordered it to be re|commenced at Oxford; and Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, were &s;ent thither from the Tower, as the prote&s;tant champions. In the cour&s;e of their argu|mentation they were in&s;ulted, interrupted, and &s;ilenced. On the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being confuted, they were &s;ummoned to abjure their errors, and, on their refu&s;al excommunicated.</P>

<P>On the twentieth day of July prince Philip arrived at Southampton, with a fleet of &s;ixty &s;hips. When he &s;et foot on Engli&s;h ground he un&s;heathed his &s;word$ and, being pre&s;ented with the keys of the town by the magi&s;trates, he re&s;tored them, without &s;peaking one word. The queen met him at Win|che&s;ter, where they were married by Gardiner, and their nuptials &s;olemnized with great &s;tate and magnificence. Philip was in the twenty-&s;eventh year of his age, and Mary turned of eight and thirty. After the ceremony of the mar|riage they were proclaimed king and queen of England, France, Naples, and Jeru&s;alem, with the addition of many other high &s;ounding titles. He was a prince of the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;imulation, and maintained a re&s;erve which was extremely di&s;gu&s;ting to the Engli&s;h people: neverthele&s;s, he brought over great &s;ums of money, which reconciled many per&s;ons to the marriage. From Win|che&s;ter they removed to Wind&s;or, where Philip was in&s;talled a knight of the garter. In order to conciliate the affection of his new &s;ubjects, he interceded in behalf of the prince&s;s Elizabeth and &s;ome others whom Gardiner had devoted to de&s;truction. By his mediation Elizabeth, the archbi&s;hop of York, and ten knights were pardoned. Notwith&s;tanding this genero&s;ity, he was very di&s;agree|able to the nation: no per&s;on could approach him or the queen without having fir&s;t demanded and obtained an audience; &s;o that her court was almo&s;t wholly de&s;erted. The duke of Norfolk died in September; and the lord Paget, with another nobleman, was &s;ent over to the Low Countries to conduct cardinal Pole into England, as the pope's legate.</P>

<P>Mean while the parliament meeting on the eleventh day of No|vember, repealed the act by which that prelate had been condemned in the reign of the la&s;t Henry. He was received in England with extraordinary marks of joy by the king, queen, and nobility. The parliament being &s;ummoned to attend their maje&s;ties in the hou&s;e of lords, the cardinal declared the &s;ubject of his legation, which was to bring them back, like &s;o many &s;trayed &s;heep, into the fold of Chri&s;t. He &s;poke &s;o pathetically on this occa&s;ion, that the queen was tran&s;ported with an exce&s;s of plea&s;ure, and declared &s;he felt the child leap in her womb. This declaration was immediately publi&s;hed through the whole kingdom; and Te Deum was &s;ung in St. Paul's church with great &s;olemnity. Her female attendants encouraged her in the conceit of her own pregnancy till the middle of next year, when &s;he was effectually undeceived, to her un|&s;peakable mortification. On the twenty-ninth day of November the two<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayward. Godwin.</NOTE> hou&s;es pre&s;ented a petition to their maje&s;ties, intreating them to intercede with the legate, that the kingdom might be reunited to the church from which it had been &s;o long &s;eparated by a horrible &s;chi&s;m; and promi&s;ing to repeal all the acts which had been made to the prejudice of his holine&s;s. This reque&s;t being communicated to the legate, he repaired to the hou&s;e of peers; and, af|ter having expatiated upon the pope's tender affection for the people of Eng|land, pre&s;cribed, by way of penance, that they &s;hould aboli&s;h all the laws enacted again&s;t the papal authority. Then he indulged both hou&s;es with ab|&s;olution, which they received on their knees, and removed all eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures. They accordingly enacted a &s;tatute, re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the pope's au|thority in England, under certain limitations, however, one of which was an expre&s;s clau&s;e, That alienations of church-lands &s;hould be authorized; and that

<P>This was a very delicate point, and retarded the reunion of the Engli&s;h church with the &s;ee of Rome. The pope practi&s;ed &s;everal artifices to $word$ a re&s;t$t$$ion, o$, a$ lea&s;t$ to &s;ave the preten&s;ions of the church to an $word$ But, as the nobility of England, among whom they had been $word$ were $enacious of th$ir po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and a powerful body not to be $word$ a$ this junc$ure, the legate received powers to compromi&s;e the affair, and the $word$ pa&s;&s;ed a law, importing, That whoever &s;hould attack any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of church-lands, on pretence of ecc$e&s;ia&s;tical right, &s;hould be $ubject to the penalties &s;pecified in the &s;tatute of Premunire. The hou&s;e of com$ons was &s;o forward in its zeal for the queen's &s;ervice, that &s;everal bills were brought into it, which the lords would not pa&s;s, left the prote&s;tants &s;hould be driven to de&s;pair. They complimented Philip with an act, condemning to perpe$ual p$$&s;on and confi&s;cation of goods, any per&s;on who &s;hould aver, that P$$$ip had no right to a&s;&s;ume the title of king of England, while his marriage with the queen &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. The penalties attached to high trea&s;on were decreed again&s;t any who &s;hould make an attempt upon his life, while he acted as admi|ni&s;t$ator for the heir of the crown, as well as again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould, in prayer, petition God to touch the queen's heart, &s;o as &s;he &s;hould renounceidolatry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God$$$.</NOTE> or otherwi$e abridge the days of her life.

Mary left to Po$e the care of reforming the morals of the clergy; but, the charge of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> extirpating herefy was committed to Gardiner. In the mean time, &s;he di&s;|patched the lord vi&s;count Montague, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and Sir Edmund Karne, to yield obedience to the pope, in the name of the king, queen, and three e&s;tates of the realm.</P>

<P>Gardiner had now almo&s;t attained the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes. He &s;at as judge in the high court of chancery; he acted as prime mini&s;ter, and chief coun&s;ellor to the queen; from thence he thought his glory would be com|pieted<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. $word$ $word$</NOTE> by compelling the prote&s;tants to recognize the papal authority. He began the per&s;ecution with Hooper, who had been bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, and Rogers, one of the mo&s;t popular prote&s;tant preachers. They were condemned for here&s;y by the chancellor, and other commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to judge the&s;e matters; and being delivered over to the &s;ecular arm, Rogers was burned in Smithfield, where he &s;uffered with great con&s;tancy, rather than enjoy an offered pardon at the expence of changing his religion. Hooper was &s;ent to Glouce&s;ter; and, after having $$jected a pardon on the &s;ame terms, was brought to the &s;take: there he &s;uffered inexpre&s;&s;ible torment by being burned piecemeal, in&s;omuch that one of his arms dropped off before he expired; yet he bore his fate with &s;urpri&s;ing patience and re&s;ignation. The next victim was a preacher called Sanders, who &s;uffered death at Coventry; and he was &s;oon followed by doctor Taylor, vicar of Hadley, an old reverend eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who ventured to oppo&s;e &s;ome Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, who celebrated ma&s;s in his church. Gardiner being informed of his behaviour, &s;ent for him to London, where he reviled him with the epithets
<PB N="699" REF="7110">
of traitor, villain, heretic, and knave, committed him to the pri&s;on of the King's-bench, from which, in a few days, he was brought to his trial, con|demned, and &s;ent down to be burned at Hadley. When he was conducted to the &s;take, and began to harangue the by-&s;tanders, one of the guards &s;truck him on the head. Then he was fixed in a barrel of pitch, and one of the &s;pectators flinging a faggot at the good old man, which wounded him &s;everely, &s;o that his whole vi&s;age was covered with blood, he replied, <Q>&startq;Oh friend! I have harm enough, what needed that?&endq;</Q> When he repeated a p&s;alm in Engli&s;h, one of the guards &s;truck him on the mouth, bidding him &s;peak Latin; and while he was employed in pious ejaculations, another cleft his head with an halbert in &s;uch a manner, that his brains came out, and he expired. Perhaps hi&s;tory cannot parallel a more infamous &s;cene of unprovoked cruelty. Bradley was con|demned at the &s;ame time, but Gardiner thought proper to delay his exe|cution.</P>

<P>Perceiving that the execution of the&s;e four eccle&s;ia&s;tics &s;erved only to increa&s;e the zeal of the prote&s;tants, and excite murmurings among the people, he transferred to Bonner a commi&s;&s;ion, from which he had nothing to expect but the hatred of the public; and in &s;o doing, he let loo&s;e the mo&s;t &s;a|vage mini&s;ter of vengeance upon the prote&s;tants; for the zeal of Gardiner was cruel, but that of Bonner altogether furious. Every per&s;on of humanity, what|ever might be his per&s;ua&s;ion in points of religion, was &s;hocked at this bar|barity; even the bi&s;hops were a&s;hamed of it, and on all occa&s;ions publicly di&s;|claimed the per&s;ecution: &s;o that the odium of cour&s;e fell upon the king and queen, particularly on the former, who was a foreigner, and had been educated in a country &s;ubject to the inqui&s;ition. Philip being informed of this calumny$ and opinion of the Engli&s;h, ju&s;tified him&s;elf by the mouth of Alphon&s;o his confe&s;&s;or, who, in pre&s;ence of the whole court, charged the bi&s;hops with tho&s;e cruelties again&s;t which the nation exclaimed; and de&s;ired them to produce one pa&s;&s;age in &s;cripture, authori&s;ing them to put people to death merely for mat|ters of faith. It was not without a&s;toni&s;hment that the audience heard a Spa|niard condemn per&s;ecution; and the bi&s;hops were &s;o confounded, that for &s;ome weeks the effects of their inhuman rage were &s;u&s;pended: but, at the expira|tion of that term, the barbarous flame broke out with double fury.</P>

<P>Bonner behaved with the utmo&s;t brutality of frantic zeal. He tore off the beard of a poor weaver, and tortured him with the flame of a taper, until his veins bur&s;t, and his &s;inews were con&s;umed, becau&s;e he could not con|vert him to the Romi&s;h faith. Young, raw appren$ices, ignorant fi&s;hermen, and pea&s;ants, per&s;ons of family, worth, and character, were &s;acrificed without di&s;|tinction; and among the&s;e Ferrars formerly bi&s;hop of St. David's, though he ap|pealed to cardinal Pole, who was aver&s;e to this religious butchery. The bi&s;hops<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. of the Reform.</NOTE> and civil magi&s;trates &s;eemed to vie with each other, the fir&s;t in condemning, the la&s;t in executing the unhappy prote&s;tants; till, at length, the people were provoked almo&s;t to rebellion again&s;t &s;uch mon&s;ters; and then their proce&s;&s;es were for &s;ome time interrupted. By the interce&s;&s;ion of Philip the prince&s;s Elizabeth was relea&s;ed from Wode&s;toke, and allowed to re&s;ide in a little country|hou&s;e, where knowing her&s;elf under the ob&s;ervation of &s;pies, &s;he applied to &s;tudy, and made &s;ome progre&s;s in learning; but &s;he was obliged to conform to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, otherwi&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have fallen a victim to the ill offices of Gardiner, who eagerly wi&s;hed for an opportunity to accompli&s;h her

<P>The queen was now &s;eized with a &s;cruple of con&s;cience$ under which &s;he became very unea&s;y. She po$$e&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the lands which had be|longed to mona$teries; and pope Julius III. notwith&s;tanding his compromi&s;ing that affair by means of cardi$al Pole, had publi&s;hed a bull, excommunicating all tho&s;e who had &s;eized the lands of the church, or of religious communities, as well as all the princes by whom &s;uch invaders were favoured and a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Mary believing her&s;elf far advanced in her pregnancy, would not run the ri&s;que of dying in a &s;tate of excommunication. She declared to her mini&s;ters, that &s;he was re&s;olved to re&s;ign all the church-lands that were in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and or|dered them to deliver a li&s;t to the cardinal legate. Julius III. dying about this period, was &s;ucceeded in the papacy by cardinal Marcellus Cervinus, who did not many days &s;urvive his exaltation. When the tidings of his death ar|rived in England, the queen took &s;ome mea&s;ures for elevating Pole to the pon|tificate; but the conclave elected cardinal Caraffa, who a&s;&s;umed the name of Paul IV. one of the mo&s;t proud, arrogant, and ambitious pontiffs who had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ee of Rome. He refu&s;ed to give audience to the Engli&s;h am|ba&s;&s;adors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> becau&s;e Mary a&s;&s;umed the title of queen of Ireland; but, as the Engli&s;h envoys would not give up that addition, he thought proper to erect Ireland into a kingdom by virtue of his pontifical power.

This order favoured &s;o much of an inqui&s;ition, that the nation in general believed, it was &s;ugge&s;ted by the Spaniards, again&s;t whom the people conceived an implacable hatred. The &s;e|verities already practi&s;ed had excited &s;uch murmurs, that even Bonner re|&s;trained his furious zeal, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed &s;everal per&s;ons who were &s;ent to him, accu&s;ed of here$y; till, at length, the queen and her con&s;ort, &s;candalized at his moderation, wrote a letter, exhorting him to obey as u&s;ual the dictates of his duty. Thus animated, he renewed the per&s;ecution with redoubled violence. John Cardmaker a prebendary at Bath, John Warne an uphol&s;terer in Lon|don, Thomas Hawkes a gentleman of E$$ex, John Samp&s;on, and John Audley hu&s;bandmen, Thomas Watts a linen-draper, Nicholas Chamberlain a weaver, Thomas O&s;mund a fuller, and William Baniford another weaver, were com|mitted to the flames for having denied the real pre&s;ence in the Euchari&s;t. Even one Tool, who was hanged for robbery, having expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts about tran&s;ub&s;tantiation at the gallows, underwent a trial after his death; and his body was burned for here&s;y.

The report of her having brought forth a &s;on was diffu&s;ed into different counties of England. The bi&s;hop of Norwich cau&s;ed Te Deum to be &s;ung in his cathedral for the birth of a prince, and a certain prie&s;t ven|tured to de&s;cribe the lineaments of the child, from the pulpit.

This di&s;appointment did not help to &s;often Mary's di&s;po&s;ition.

On the twelfth day of September, Brooks bi|&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, as the pope's &s;ubdelegate, together with two commi&s;&s;ioners from the king and queen, had condemned Cranmer at Oxford, for here&s;y;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. C$. $$$6.</NOTE> and on the fourteenth day of February, Bonner and Thirleby were &s;ent thither to degrade that prelate. He was cloathed in deri&s;ion with pontifical robes of coar&s;e canvas, and Bonner having in&s;ulted him with the mo&s;t indecent raillery, ordered him to be &s;tripped of his ludicrous attire, according to the ceremony of degradation u&s;ed in the church of Rome. Thirleby wept bitterly during this whole &s;cene, prote&s;ting to Cranmer, that this was the mo&s;t &s;orrowful action of his whole life; and that nothing but the queen's peremptory com|mand could have induced him to be pre&s;ent at the affliction and di&s;tre&s;s of a per&s;on with whom he had lived in the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip. After the arch|bi&s;hop's condemnation, a great number of divines both Engli&s;h and Spaniards, a&s;&s;ailed him in different &s;hapes, with a view to make him a pro&s;elyte to their opinions. They threatened and &s;oothed him by turns; they flattered him with promi&s;e of a pardon; and in a word, tampered with the infirmities of his nature, &s;o effectually, that he &s;ub&s;cribed an abjuration, renouncing all the errors of Lu|ther and Zwinglius, acknowledging the pope's &s;upremacy, the &s;even &s;acraments, the corporal pre&s;ence in the Euchari&s;t, purgatory, prayers for the dead, and the invocation of &s;aints. His recantation was immediately printed, and furni&s;hed the popi&s;h party with infinite matter of triumph and exultation, while the prote&s;tants were overwhelmed with dejection and di&s;grace. The queen now exhibited a &s;ig$al proof of her own revengeful di&s;po&s;ition. She had affected to forgive the archbi&s;hop for the crimes committed again&s;t her as his &s;overeign, in full expectation of his being burned as an heretic; but, being di&s;appointed in this hope, by his recantation, &s;he pulled off the ma&s;que, and &s;igned a warrant for his execution. He was conducted to St. Mary's, where being placed in a con&s;pi|cuous part of the church, Cole provo&s;t of Eaton preached a &s;ermon, in which
<PB N="703" REF="7150">
he magnified Cranmer's conver&s;ion as the immediate work of God's in&s;piration. He then flattered the archbi&s;hop with the hope of heaven; and a&s;&s;ured him, that diriges and ma&s;&s;es &s;hould be &s;aid for his &s;oul in all the churches of Oxford. During the whole &s;ermon, Cranmer expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t anxiety and internal agitation, lifting up his eyes to heaven, &s;hedding a torrent of tears, and groaning with unutterable angui&s;h. When he was de&s;ired to declare his faith, he prayed with the mo&s;t pathetic expre&s;&s;ions of horror and remor&s;e. He then made a &s;hort but moving exhortation to the people; repeated the creed of the apo&s;tles, de|clared his belief of the Scriptures, confe&s;&s;ed that he had &s;igned a paper con|trary to his con&s;cience, from the apprehen&s;ion of death, for which rea&s;on the hand that &s;ub&s;cribed the recantation &s;hould fir&s;t feel the torture of the fire. He renounced the pope as the enemy of Chri&s;t, and profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame opinion of the Sacrament which he had publi&s;hed in a book written on that &s;ubject. The a&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of papi&s;ts, who hoped to triumph &s;till further in the la&s;t words of &s;uch a convert, were equally confounded and incen&s;ed at this declaration. They called aloud to him to leave off di&s;&s;embling, and pull|ing him down, led him to the &s;take at which Latimer and Ridley had &s;uffered, upbraiding him by the way with this &s;econd apo&s;ta&s;y. When the fire was kindled, he &s;tretched forth his right hand to the flame, in which he held it until it was intirely con&s;umed, exclaiming from time to time, <Q>&startq;That unworthy hand!&endq;</Q> but, exhibiting no other &s;igns of pain or di&s;order. He continued to pour forth pious ejaculations until he expired; and after his body was de|&s;troyed, his heart was found intire among the a&s;hes. Such was the unworthy<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> fate of Thomas Cranmer archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who with a very &s;mall alloy of human weakne&s;s and irre&s;olution, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the candour, &s;implicity, meekne&s;s and benevolence of a primitive chri&s;tian.</P>

<P>On the very day of his death cardinal Pole was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> of his archbi&s;hopric, in con&s;equence of bulls which he had already received from the pope, at the queen's de&s;ire. The per&s;ecution &s;till raged with uncea&s;ing fury, under the conduct of Bonner, who &s;ent the poor wretches in troops to the &s;take, without di&s;tinction of age, &s;ex, or circum&s;tance. Thirteen were &s;acrificed together in one fire at Stratford le Bow; and in the i&s;land of Guern&s;ey, a &s;cene of almo&s;t incredible barbarity was acted. A mother and her two daughters being committed to the flames, one of them being married, and in the la&s;t month of her pregnancy, was, by the violence of the pain, taken in labour, and produced an infant, which a humane by-&s;tander re&s;cued from the fire. But, after &s;ome con&s;ultation, the magi&s;trate who &s;uperintended the execution, ordered the innocent to be thrown back into the flames, where it peri&s;hed with the mother. When we con&s;ider the barbarity of tho&s;e proceedings again&s;t poor, harmle&s;s people, who had committed no outrage again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed govern|ment, or religion, but been condemned for &s;imple an&s;wers touching their be|lief, extorted from them by violence, we can hardly believe the perpetrators were the children of human nature, far le&s;s the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, who&s;e doc|trine was mercy and benevolence. They looked rather like the mini&s;ters $f<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> infernal malice, let loo&s;e upon a wretched world. Within the compa&s;s of this year, four&s;core and five per&s;ons, men, women, and children, the lame, the blind, and the ignorant, &s;uffered death, becau&s;e they would not believe in purgatory, tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and other popi&s;h tenets, which are now ju&s;tly exploded by
<PB N="704" REF="7160">
the church of England. Nothing could be more impolitic than this inhuman per&s;ecution; for, opinions are rivetted by oppo&s;ition. The indignation of all moderate people was arrou&s;ed by &s;uch barbarity: the &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;olution with which the martyrs &s;uffered the mo&s;t painful death, diffu&s;ed a general no|tion of their &s;anctity, and inhanced the merit of the religion which they pro|fe&s;&s;ed: &s;o that this frantic zeal of the papi&s;ts, in a great mea&s;ure contributed to the &s;ub&s;equent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the reformation.</P>

<P>While the mini&s;try thus endeavoured to extirpate the prote&s;tant religion, the queen re&s;olved to &s;trengthen the intere&s;t of the Roman catholics, by re&s;toring &s;ome old, and founding &s;ome new mona&s;teries. She certainly would have re-e&s;tabli&s;hed all the religious hou&s;es which had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, if the fear of di&s;obliging the nobility had not deterred her from the execution of her de&s;ign. Several members of the lower hou&s;e in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, hearing &s;uch a propo&s;al mentioned, layed their hands upon their &s;words, &s;aying, They knew how to defend their property. Mary being informed of this oppo&s;ition, po&s;tponed her &s;cheme to a more favourable opportunity. In the mean time, &s;he commi&s;&s;ioned Bonner and others, to eraze from the public regi&s;ters, all her father's tran&s;actions again&s;t the monks and the pope, particularly, on account of the vi&s;itations, and the renunciation of the papal authority, made by the monks and abbots. Nor was the queen's attention &s;o much ingro&s;&s;ed by the affairs of religion, but that &s;he intermeddled in the intere&s;ts of the continent. She had offered her mediation between France and Spain, and the amba&s;&s;adors of both nations had a&s;&s;embled between Calais and Ardres; but the peace was retarded by the elevation of Paul IV. to the papacy. This pontiff was outrageou&s;ly proud, in&s;olent, and ambitious, though already four|&s;core years of age. He was an inveterate enemy to the Colone&s;i; and his two nephews per&s;uaded him, that the king of Spain, who &s;upported that family, had formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t his life. They pretended to have di&s;covered the particulars of this plot, in letters to the duke of Alva governor of Naples, which letters they had intercepted. Cardinal Colonna was impri&s;oned, the envoys of Philip and Mary were put under arre&s;t, and the pope &s;eized Palliano<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and Nettuno, two places belonging to the Colone&s;i. Then he declared war again&s;t the king of Spain, and &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French monarch; promi&s;ing to aid him in his turn with all his forces for the conque&s;t of Naples. The propo&s;al being &s;upported by the cardinal of Lorrain, a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive was $igned at Rome; but this was almo&s;t rendered ineffectual by the mediation of Mary, in con&s;equence of which a truce for five years was con|cluded between France and Spain. The pope being thus abandoned by his ally, the duke of Alva began to approach the city of Rome, after having taken O&s;tia, and &s;ome other places; but, the cardinal Cara$$a being &s;ent as legate a latere to Paris, managed his intrigues with &s;uch art and &s;ucce&s;s, that the king of France broke the truce, without alledging any other cau&s;e than that of the pope's being oppre&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards.</P>

As they did not appear, they were condemned to be burned for here&s;y; and their remains being dug up, were con&s;umed to

a&s;hes at Oxford. The wife of Peter Martyr was likewi&s;e taken out of her grave, and buried in a dunghil, becau&s;e &s;he had been a nun, and broken her vow of celibacy. The magi&s;trates began to be a&s;hamed of acting as in&s;truments of &s;uch unheard of barbarity, and relaxed &s;o much in their diligence, that the council &s;ent circular letters, exhorting them to redouble their zeal in the pro|&s;ecution of heretics. The queen, being incen&s;ed at hearing from all quarters that the number of prote&s;tants daily increa&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the executions, began to entertain thoughts of e&s;tabli&s;hing an inqui&s;ition in England. As a previous &s;tep to this mea&s;ure &s;he renewed the commi&s;&s;ion of the preceding year, impowering one and twenty commi&s;&s;ioners to judge heretics of all ranks with unlimited authority. The per&s;ecution revived, and &s;eventy-nine per&s;ons were committed to the flames. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the duke of Gui&s;e marched with an army into the kingdom of Naples, from whence he was &s;oon recalled by the pope to the relief of Rome, which was hard pre&s;&s;ed by the duke of Alva.</P>

<P>Philip, exa&s;perated at Henry of France, for having broken the truce, levied an army of fifty thou&s;and men to act in Picardy; and, by divers artifices and in&s;inuations, prevailed upon his con&s;ort Mary to e&s;pou&s;e his quar|rel. She granted commi&s;&s;ions to the &s;heriffs and ju&s;tices of the peace to enli&s;t &s;oldiers, that they might be ready to march at the fir&s;t notice. In the interim one Stafford having received &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the court of France, a&s;&s;em|bled &s;ome Engli&s;h refugees; and, embarking in a ve&s;&s;el, landed in Scotland. From thence marching to S$arborough, he &s;urprized the ca&s;tle, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, in which he affirmed that Mary had forfeited all right to the crown, by introducing Spaniards into the kingdom, of which he declared him&s;elf the protector. But his &s;ucce&s;s was of very &s;hort duration; the earl of We&s;tmoreland having rai&s;ed &s;ome troops, retook Scarborough, in which he found Stafford and three of his accomplices, who were executed at London. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Godwin$</NOTE></P>

<P>On the twentieth day of May king Philip arrived in England, where by this time eight thou&s;and men were ready to embark for the Low Countries; and the queen, having &s;ent a herald to declare war again&s;t France, the&s;e troops were tran&s;ported, on the &s;eventeenth day of June, under the com|mand of the earl of Pembroke, who joined the Spani&s;h army commanded by the duke of Savoy: then Philip returned to Bru&s;&s;els. The Spani&s;h general having inve&s;ted St. Quentin, the con&s;table of France detached the admiral de Chatillon with three thou&s;and men, to throw him&s;elf into the place. He found means to enter with &s;even hundred; but the re&s;t were bewildered in the night. With this reinforcement he defended the place vigorou&s;ly, in expectation of being relieved by his uncle the con&s;table, who being greatly inferior in number to the allies, contented him&s;elf with introducing the admiral's brother d'An|delot, with a &s;upply of five hundred men; but, in return from this expedition, he was attacked, routed, and taken pri&s;oner by the duke of Savoy, after two thou&s;and five hundred men had been killed upon the &s;pot. In this action, which was fought on the tenth day of Augu&s;t, and thence called the battle of St. Lau|rence, be&s;ides the con&s;table Montmorency and his &s;on, the dukes of Mont|pen&s;ier and Longueville, Ludovico Gonzaga, brother to the duke of Mantua, the marechal St. Andre, the Rhingrave Roche-dumain, the count de Roche foucault, the baron of Curton, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, fell into

the hands of the Spaniards. Among the &s;$ain were John duke of Enghien, the vi&s;count of Turenne, the lords of Chandinier and Pontdormy, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">God$$$.</NOTE> great number of officers. France was overwhe$med with &s;uch con&s;ternation at the ne$s of this di&s;a&s;ter, that if the duke of Savoy had marched directly to Paris, he might have entered that city without oppo&s;ition: but he proceeded to the &s;iege of St. Quentin, which in a few days he took by a&s;&s;ault; when the $d$$r$l, with his brother, and all that &s;urvived of the garri&s;on were made pri&s;oners.

<P>When his holine&s;s fir&s;t under&s;tood that the queen of England had declared war again&s;t France, he was violently exa&s;perated again&s;t cardinal Pole, as if he had advi&s;ed that mea&s;ure, and would have recalled him imme|diately, had not Carne, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, repre&s;ented the injury that he would do to religion by &s;uch a procedure; but when the news of the battle arrived he was &s;eized with a tran&s;port of rage, and re&s;olved to &s;acrifice Pole to his revenge. He &s;ent for Payton, the queen's confe&s;&s;or, to Rome, where he be&s;towed upon him a cardinal's hat, appointed him legate in England, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with a decree, by which Pole was recalled. But the queen, be|ing informed of this mandate, gave notice to Payton, that &s;hould he attempt to &s;et foot in England, &s;he would cau&s;e him to be puni&s;hed with all the rigour<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of the Premuni$e. This letter &s;topped the new cardinal in his journey; and Pole, $hough he had not received the pope's decretal, ab&s;tained from all the functions of $ legate, that he might not furni&s;h the pontiff with a pretence to take any &s;tep to his prejudice. Neverthele&s;s, the pope, finding him&s;elf unable to cope with the duke of Alva, concluded a peace with Spain; and, by an article of the treaty, Pole was re$e&s;tabli&s;hed in his legation.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The French king created the duke of Gui&s;e his lieutenant|general for the whole kingdom of France, and excited the queen-regent of Scotland to infringe the peace with Mary. As &s;he could not prevail upon the &s;tates of the kingdom to $omply with her wi&s;hes, &s;he ordered Aymouth to be fortified, contrary to an $rticle of the la&s;t treaty; and the Engli&s;h oppo&s;ing this mea&s;ure by force of arms, a rupture en&s;ued. D'Oy&s;el, at the head of the Scot|$i&s;h army, entered the frontiers of England, but he was immediately recalled by an expre&s;s order of the parliament; and the queen regent advi&s;ed Henry of France to ha&s;ten the marriage between the dauphin and her daughter Mary; that he, being ma&s;ter of Scotland, might exert his authority with the natives. Henry reli&s;hed this advice, in con&s;equence of which he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to regulate the articles of the marriage with the parliament of Scotland. In the latter end of the year Philip &s;ent intimation to Mary, that the court of France had projected &s;ome &s;cheme again&s;t Calais, and offered to &s;upply her with troops for the guard of that fortre&s;s, which was in a defencele&s;s condition. The council looked upon this intimation as a &s;tratagem of Philip to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Calais; and the queen not only declined accepting his offer, but al&s;o neg|lected to put the place in a po&s;ture of defence, notwith&s;tanding the repeated follicitations of lord Wentworth the governor. The mini&s;try was too much engro$$ed by religious affairs to be&s;tow proper attention upon this object of importance. In the beginning of the year Calais was inve&s;ted by the duke of Gui&s;e, who, having taken by a&s;&s;ault the two forts of Newnambridge and Ri&s;
<PB N="707" REF="7190">
bank, battered the town, and obliged the governor to &s;urrender on the &s;eventh day of the &s;iege. He was no &s;ooner ma&s;ter of the place, than he expelled all the Engli&s;h inhabitants: then he &s;at down before Guifnes, in which the lord Grey commanded: but the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of eleven hundred m$n, were &s;o di&s;$ouraged by the lo&s;s of Calais, that at the fir&s;t attack they retired to the citadel, where they &s;u&s;tained another a&s;&s;ault, and then &s;urrendered them&s;elves<NOTE PLACE="marg">Godwin.</NOTE> pri&s;oners of war. The ca&s;tle of Hames, being &s;ituated in a mora&s;s which was almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, might have made a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance; but the garri&s;on abandoned it, and fled at the approach of the enemy. Thus, within the &s;pace of fifteen days, in the middle of winter, all that remained of the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts in France, was lo&s;t by the ignorance and neglect of the queen and council; and this was the fruit of the alliance between England and Spain.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The lo&s;s of Calais filled the whole kingdom of England with murmurs and complaints: the mini&s;try were &s;o confounded, that they could not open their mouths in their own ju&s;tification, and the queen felt all the pangs of the mo&s;t mortifying di&s;appointment. Philip pre&s;&s;ed her to make a power|ful effort for the recovery of the place, before the French &s;hould have time to repair the fortifications: but the mini&s;ters could not find means to execute &s;uch an enterprize; and they were afraid that the undertaking would detach their attention too much from the concerns of religion. The parliament, meeting on the twentieth day of January, granted a &s;ub&s;idy to the queen, and &s;he re|ceived another from the clergy. Some of the parti&s;ans of the court, propo&s;ing an act for giving the force of a law to all the queen's proclamations, one of the members oppo&s;ed the propo&s;ition, alledging that the queen, by virtue of &s;uch an unlimited power, might, by a &s;imple proclamation, alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The hou&s;e, offended at this member's &s;u&s;picion, committed him to the Tower; but no further mention was made of the act, becau&s;e, in all probability, Mary perceived the nation was attached to the right of the prince&s;s Elizabeth, who, after the prorogation of the parliament, was demanded in marriage by the king of Sweden; but &s;he rejected his propo&s;al. In the month of April the dauphin e&s;pou&s;ed Mary queen of Scotland; and, in June, Philip king of Spain, by his general the count d'Egmont, obtained a complete victory over the French at Gravelines, where the French general de Termes and his principal offers were taken. This victory was in a great mea&s;ure owing to ten Engli&s;h men of war, which chancing to &s;ail along &s;hore, while the battle was maintained with equal f$ry on both &s;ides, made a terrible &s;laughter among the French with their cannon, in&s;omuch that the rout began from this quarter. About the &s;ame time, lord Clinton, high admiral of England, with a fleet of one hundred and forty &s;hips, made a de&s;cent upon Conque&s;t in Normandy, which he took and plundered; but &s;ome of the Flemings, that were on board the navy, making an excur&s;ion farther into the country, were attacked and routed by the militia; and the ad|miral retired to his &s;hips with precipitation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ha$ward.</NOTE></P>

<P>Mean while the per&s;ecution was renewed in England with fre&s;h fury. The queen ordered, by proclamation, that tho&s;e who &s;hould receive heretical books, without delivering them immediately to the magi&s;trate, &s;hould be forthwith executed by martial law; and all per&s;ons were forbidden to pray for &s;uch as &s;uffered on account of here&s;y. A man, of the name of Bambridge, being condemned to the flames in Hamp&s;hire, and unable to bear the torture,
<PB N="708" REF="7200">
cried aloud, "I recant, I recant." The &s;heriff immediately ordered the fire to be extingui&s;hed, and the man &s;igned an abjuration. But the court &s;ent down an order to b$rn this unhappy wretch even after his recantation, and th$ &s;he|riff was committed pri&s;oner to the Fleet, for having pre&s;umed to &s;u&s;pend the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> execution.
