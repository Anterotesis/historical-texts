<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>TO our late Troubles the Publick is in|debted
for the following Papers, if they
are of Value to create a Debt. After many
di&s;con&s;olate Hours, the Author took Courage
to apply him&s;elf to &s;ome Study, which might
divert him from brooding over the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of his Country. One Subject led to another,
till a Sort of Work grew under his Hand.
His only View at fir&s;t was private Amu&s;e|ment,
nor at pre&s;ent does he e&s;teem the Thing
of Value to be publi&s;hed for its own Sake.
But he confe&s;&s;es, he has at Heart to rai&s;e a
Spirit among his Countrymen, of &s;earching
into their Antiquities, tho&s;e e&s;pecially which
regard the Law and the Con&s;titution; being
&s;eriou&s;ly convinced, that nothing will more
contribute than this Study, to eradicate a Set
of Opinions, which, by Intervals, have di&s;|quieted
this I&s;land for a Century and an Half.
If the&s;e Papers have the Effect de&s;igned, it
will ju&s;tify the Publication: They will &s;erve
at lea&s;t to bear Te&s;timony of &s;ome Degree of
<PB REF="3">
Firmne&s;s in the Author, who, amid&s;t the
Calamities of a Civil War, gave not over his
Country for lo&s;t; but tru&s;ting to a good
Cau&s;e, and to good Di&s;po&s;itions in the Bulk
of his Countrymen, was able to compo&s;e
his Mind to Study, having no other Oppor|tunity
of being u&s;eful; and to deal in Specu|lations,
which are not reli&s;hed, but in Times
of the greate&s;t Tranquillity.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF the Introduction of the FEUDAL LAW
into SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THE Introduction of the Feudal Law
into <HI>Scotland</HI> is an Event, which
makes not &s;uch a Figure in our Hi|&s;tory
as it ought to do: It is mentioned in|deed
by mo&s;t of our Hi&s;torians, but dryly
and cur&s;orily, as if it were an ordinary Inci|dent.
And yet, as the Story is told, it appears
to be a very &s;ingular Revolution, for which
no adequate Cau&s;e is a&s;&s;igned. If Credit can
be given to Hi&s;tory or Tradition, we were
once a free People; nay, we are reported to
have been fierce and untamed, our Nobles of
great Power, generally too mighty for the
Sovereign, priding them&s;elves upon Indepen|dency
and Extent of Property. Now, as it is
the Plan of the Feudal Law, to be&s;tow the
whole Land Property upon the King, and to
&s;ubject the Bulk of the People to him as his
Servants and Va&s;&s;als; a Con&s;titution &s;o con|tradictory
<PB N="2" REF="5">
to all the Principles which govern
Mankind can never be brought about, one
&s;hould imagine, without Violence, whether
Conque&s;t from without, or military Force
from within: Yet neither of the&s;e Cau&s;es is
a&s;&s;igned by our Authors, nor will the Hi&s;tory
of <HI>Scotland</HI> admit of &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition; for
no Period can be a&s;&s;igned, during which the
Feudal Law might have been introduced,
where there are any Traces of Conque&s;t, or
of military Power, &s;ufficient to inforce &s;o
unnatural a Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>ALL our Hi&s;torians are agreed, that this
Revolution happened in the Reign of <HI>Mal|colm</HI>
II. and they are al&s;o pretty much agreed
upon the Circum&s;tances which brought it
about. This King had been engaged in fierce
Wars with the <HI>Danes,</HI> which, after various
Succe&s;s, ended in driving the Invaders out of
this Part of the I&s;land. Many of his Nobles
had done him notable Service; and, to re|ward
their Fidelity, ('tis &s;aid) he divided all
the Crown Lands among&s;t them. And &s;o
<PB N="3" REF="6">
circum&s;tantiate is the Story, that 'tis averred
he retained no Lands to him&s;elf, but the
<HI>Mute-hill</HI> in the Town of <HI>Scoon.</HI> A very
exten&s;ive and unprecedented Piece of Libera|lity.
But what follows is &s;till more difficult
to be believed; That the Lords, to te&s;tify
their Gratitude, gave and granted to their So|vereign,
and to his Heirs for ever, the Ward
and Relief of their Lands with the Marriage
of their Heirs. This is a &s;hort Way of ex|pre&s;&s;ing
a thing, which bears this obvious
Meaning, that all the Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI> were
&s;urrendered to the King as his Property; that
all the great Men came under per&s;onal Obli|gations
to be his Servants and Va&s;&s;als, holding
only the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lands which they
had &s;urrendered, for Su&s;tenance of them&s;elves
and their People, ready upon all Occa&s;ions to
fight his Battles. There are few Examples of
&s;o warm Returns of Gratitude among Indi|viduals;
but, in a whole Nation, altogether
incredible. I &s;hould be &s;tunned with &s;uch
Liberty of Fiction in a Romance. There|fore,
laying a&s;ide this Account of the Matter,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
as utterly improbable, the De&s;ign of this E&s;|&s;ay
is to bring together &s;ome Circum&s;tances,
whence probable Conjectures may be formed,
at what Time, and after what Manner, the
Feudal Law was introduced into <HI>Scotland.</HI>
I &s;hall &s;et out with the Time of Introduction,
as it may give Light to the other Branch of
the Di&s;qui&s;ition; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that,
notwith&s;tanding the concurring Te&s;timonies
of all our Hi&s;torians, I entertain &s;ome Doubts
whether the Feudal Law was introduced into
<HI>Scotland</HI> &s;o early as in the Reign of <HI>Mal|colm</HI>
II. What to me brought this thing fir&s;t
under Su&s;picion, is a Fact that can be made
extremely evident. When one dives into the
Antiquities of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> it will
appear that we borrowed all our Laws and
Cu&s;toms from the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> No &s;ooner is a
Statute enacted in <HI>England,</HI> but, upon the
fir&s;t Opportunity, it is introduced into <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
&s;o that our olde&s;t Statutes are mere
Copies of theirs. Let the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> be
put into the Hands of any <HI>Scot&s;man,</HI> without
giving its Hi&s;tory, and he will have no Doubt
<PB N="5" REF="8">
that he is reading a Collection of <HI>Scots</HI> Statutes
or Regulations. Now it is a Point &s;ettled a|mong
the be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Antiquaries, That the
Feudal Law was introduced into <HI>England</HI> by
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. I need not &s;pend
Time upon this Topick, after what is &s;aid by
the accurate <HI>Spelman,</HI> and by our Country|man
<HI>Craig.</HI> Joining the&s;e two things toge|ther,
a &s;trong Pre&s;umption ari&s;es, that the
Feudal Law made its Progre&s;s from <HI>England</HI>
to this Country, as all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Statutes,
making Improvements and Alterations upon it,
certainly did. But this Pre&s;umption receives
additional Force, when it is con&s;idered, that
if we had the Feudal Law before it came into
<HI>England,</HI> it mu&s;t have been taken from &s;ome
other People than the <HI>Normans,</HI> with whom
we had no Commerce. Upon that Suppo&s;i|tion,
we mu&s;t expect to find the Feudal
Cu&s;toms in <HI>Scotland,</HI> after the Days of <HI>Wil|liam</HI>
the Conqueror, &s;omewhat different from
what they were in <HI>England,</HI> as the Feudal
Cu&s;toms were very different in different Na|tions.
What we had in <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t have
<PB N="6" REF="9">
been formed upon the Plan of tho&s;e of the
Country from which we borrowed them,
perhaps a little varied in our Practice. Yet,
upon Inquiry, we find no &s;uch Di&s;parity as
we ought to expect from the Suppo&s;ition.
On the contrary, I think it may with A&s;&s;u|rance
be pronounced, that the Feudal Cu&s;toms
in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were preci&s;ely the
&s;ame, for a Century or two after the Days of
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror. This Congruity be|twixt
the Laws of the different Countries
affords Evidence, as high as Probability can
go, of one of two things, either that we bor|rowed
the Feudal Law from <HI>England,</HI> or,
that they borrowed it from us. The latter
is not maintained by any Author; nor is there
any Foundation for the A&s;&s;ertion, it being as
well vouched as any Point can be, of that
Antiquity, that <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror brought
the Feudal Cu&s;toms along with him from
<HI>Normandy:</HI> And it is certain, he had no In|tercour&s;e
with <HI>Scotland,</HI> unle&s;s in the Shape
of Enmity and War.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">
IN fair Rea&s;oning it mu&s;t be yielded, that
the Circum&s;tance now mentioned ought to
create a Su&s;picion, that the Feudal Law is not
of &s;uch Antiquity in <HI>Scotland</HI> as is generally
believed. But it will be &s;aid, that Doubts and
Su&s;picions, however great, mu&s;t yield to po|&s;itive
Evidence; and that we have not only
the Authority of all our Hi&s;torians for the
Fact above mentioned, but &s;till a more con|vincing
Evidence, the Laws of <HI>Malcolm</HI> II.
&s;till extant, which bear, &startq;That King <HI>Mal|colm</HI>
di&s;tributed all his Lands in <HI>Scotland</HI>
among his Men; re&s;erving nothing in Pro|perty
to him&s;elf, but the Royal Dignity,
and the <HI>Mute-hill</HI> in the Town of <HI>Scoon.</HI>
And all his Barons gave and granted to him,
the Ward and Relief of the Heir of ilk
Baron, for the King's Su&s;tentation.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE Authorities appear to be of Weight,
and &s;hall be handled deliberately. Suppo&s;ing
the above mentioned Laws to be tho&s;e of
<HI>Malcolm</HI> II. the Di&s;pute is at an End, and the
Evidence complete, not only upon account of
<PB N="8" REF="11">
the above cited Pa&s;&s;age, but becau&s;e in the&s;e
Laws frequent mention is made of Feudal
Cu&s;toms, &s;uch as the Office of Chancery,
Charters, Sa&s;ines, Barons holding of the King,
Knights holding of Barons, and others hold|ing
of Knights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But when I weigh this
Evidence of the Antiquity of the Feudal Law
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I perceive one Circum&s;tance
wanting to make it complete. That the&s;e
are the Laws of King <HI>Malcolm</HI> cannot be de|nied;
they have in all Ages been reckoned
authentic, and King <HI>Malcolm</HI> is mentioned in
the Body of the Work: But it may be con|troverted,
whether the&s;e are the Laws of
<HI>Malcolm</HI> the II. We had four Kings of the
Name of <HI>Malcolm;</HI> and we have no Autho|rity,
but from the Title, to a&s;cribe the&s;e
Laws to the &s;econd of that Name: But at
what Time, or upon what Evidence was this
Title added, we are altogether uncertain. The
Title in the printed Copy is obviou&s;ly a <HI>po&s;t
facto</HI> Work; for it runs thus: &startq;The Laws
of King <HI>Malcolm Mackenneth,</HI> &s;econd of
that Name, who was Son to <HI>Kenneth</HI> the
<PB N="9" REF="12">
Third, and began to reign in the Year of
the Creation of the World 4974, and of
Chri&s;t 1004. The&s;e Laws are authentic,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq; This Title proves only, that <HI>Skeen</HI>
the Publi&s;her believed the&s;e to be <HI>Malcolm</HI>
the II.'s Laws: Upon what Evidence he does
not &s;ay, nor can it well be gathered, if it be
not what ari&s;es from the Title given to the
Manu&s;cript Copies, which in all Probability
had no better Foundation than a vague Tra|dition.</P>
<P>BUT I chu&s;e not to re&s;t upon negative
Arguments. There is Evidence the mo&s;t con|vincing,
that <HI>Malcolm</HI> the II. was not the Au|thor
of the&s;e Laws: This Evidence is drawn
from the Work it&s;elf, wherein frequent men|tion
is made of Earls and Barons, of the
Chancellor and his Court, Coroner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> none
of which Names, in all Probability, had a
Being in the Time of <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. The Court
of Chancery was not known in <HI>England</HI> be|fore
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror; and it is not
probable we had it before his Time. But
<PB N="10" REF="13">
more po&s;itively, 'tis a Fact agreed upon by
all Writers, that it was <HI>Malcolm</HI> III. who cre|ated
the fir&s;t Barons and Earls. <HI>Demp&s;ter</HI>
the be&s;t of our Antiquarians, <HI>p. 120, Mal|colmus
tertius, &s;ublato Maccabaeo tyranno, reg|num
legittime &s;ibi debitum occupavit, quod ut
ornaret unica cura incubuit: tunc et a prae|diis
nobilibus nomina qui&s;que &s;ump&s;it, et cum
magna frequen&s;que nobilitas S. Margaretam
ex Hungaria et Anglia &s;ecuta in Scotia con&s;e|di&s;&s;et,
&s;plendorem novo &s;uo principatui addi|turus,
Barones et Comites creavit.</HI> Before the
Days of <HI>Malcom</HI> III. <HI>Thane</HI> was the only
Name in <HI>Scotland</HI> by which the Nobles were
di&s;tingui&s;hed. Turn over the Hi&s;torians, and
there will not be found anywhere Mention of
the Title of Baron before his Time, nor of
Earl. All were called <HI>Thanes,</HI> &s;uch as the
Thane of <HI>Fife</HI> in <HI>MacBeath</HI>'s Time, Thane
of <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> Thane of <HI>Sutherland,</HI> Thane of <HI>Caith|$$&s;s,</HI>
&amp;c. but from <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI>'s Time
downwards, not a Word of Thane; all
the great Lords are either Earls or Barons.
Here then the Evidence is compleat, that
<PB N="11" REF="14">
the&s;e Laws are not of a more ancient Standing
than the Reign of <HI>Malcolm Canmore,</HI> and to
him therefore they mu&s;t be re&s;tored: For
they are the Laws of one King <HI>Malcolm,</HI> and
'tis more probable they are his, than the Laws
of his great Grand&s;on <HI>Malcolm</HI> IV. before
who&s;e Time the Feudal Law was certainly
introduced into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING di&s;cu&s;&s;ed this Point, the Argu|ment
drawn from the Authority of the Hi&s;to|rians
will be ea&s;ily got over. We have no
Author who wrote in the Days of <HI>Malcolm
Canmore,</HI> nor for many Ages after: There|fore,
as our Hi&s;tories re&s;t upon no better Au|thority
than Tradition, 'tis not &s;urpri&s;ing,
that an Event which happened in the Reign
of one King, &s;hould be a&s;cribed to a Prede|ce&s;&s;or
of the &s;ame Name, there being a pre|vailing
Bias in mo&s;t Nations to carry back
their Antiquities as far as po&s;&s;ible. But the
Matter does not re&s;t here, the Error of the&s;e
Hi&s;torians may be detected from their own
Writings. <HI>Hector Boece,</HI> for Example, who
<PB N="12" REF="15">
a&s;cribes the Introduction of the Feudal Law,
as afore&s;aid, to <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. adds with the &s;ame
Breath, that it was <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. who divided
<HI>Scotland</HI> into Baronies. We have therefore
this Author's Te&s;timony, that the &s;ame <HI>Mal|colm</HI>
introduced the Feudal Law, who divided
<HI>Scotland</HI> into Baronies. This was certainly
<HI>Malcolm</HI> III. And <HI>Buchanan,</HI> who for the mo&s;t
Part implicitely follows <HI>Hector Boece,</HI> yet, in
telling the Story upon his Authority, expre&s;|&s;es
a Doubt, and inclines to think, that we
had the Laws of Ward and Relief rather from
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<P>THAT I may leave nothing untouch'd,
which concerns a Point of &s;uch Importance
in the Antiquities of this Country, I proceed
to &s;ome other Con&s;iderations, which I per|ceive
may be made U&s;e of to &s;upport the high
Antiquity of the Feudal Law in <HI>Scotland.</HI> One
is made U&s;e of by the learned <HI>Craig</HI> to that
very End, <HI>Multa tamen &s;unt quae me movent,
ut hoc jure (&s;ciz. feudali) no&s;trates u&s;os pu|tem,
antequam Angli eo uti caeperint. Hoc
<PB N="13" REF="16">
enim certi&s;&s;imum e&s;t, nos purius hoc jus habere
quam vicinos; ut in rivulis aquarum qui quo
propiores &s;int fonti &s;ive &s;caturigini eo &s;unt pu|riores.</HI>
This Author probably had in View
the Feudal Cu&s;toms, as they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in his
own Time; and 'tis very true, that in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
the Feudal Law began &s;ooner to decline
than it did in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Arts and Indu&s;try
flouri&s;hed in that Kingdom long before they
had any Life here; and I have ob&s;erved el&s;e|where,
that the &s;trict Regulations of the Feu|dal
Law, are in a great Mea&s;ure incon&s;i&s;tent
with the Arts of Peace. But if <HI>Craig</HI> had
under Con&s;ideration the Feudal Law, as prac|ti&s;ed
in this I&s;land for &s;ome Ages after the
Time of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, he is un|doubtedly
in a Mi&s;take. The Feudal Law,
during that Period, was preci&s;ely the &s;ame in
both Kingdoms, &s;o far as we can gather, by
comparing the ancient Statutes and Law-books
of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI> the olde&s;t In|&s;titute
we have of our Laws, is generally be|lieved
<PB N="14" REF="17">
to have been compiled in the Reign,
and by the Authority of <HI>David</HI> the I. And
as it contains a full and accurate Sy&s;tem of
our Feudal Cu&s;toms, a probable Argument
may be &s;ugge&s;ted from it, that the Feudal
Law had a Beginning in <HI>Scotland</HI> before the
Days of <HI>Malcolm Canmore.</HI> For, if the Feu|dal
Law was introduced by that King, there
is no Probability it &s;hould make &s;o &s;udden a
Progre&s;s, as to be ripe for a regular In&s;titute
in the Days of his Son <HI>David.</HI> This is not
agreeable to the natural Cour&s;e of things,
and therefore not readily to be credited. Law
is but of &s;low Growth, e&s;pecially among a
rude People, more addicted to the Arts of
War than of Peace. And yet, whatever be
the Aera of the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem,</HI> it appears
from it, that the Feudal Law was brought to
a con&s;iderable Degree of Perfection in <HI>Scot|land</HI>
at that Time. The Argument is weigh|ty;
and we mu&s;t either give the Feudal Law
a more early Date in <HI>Scotland</HI> than the Reign
of <HI>Malcolm Canmore,</HI> or the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;ta|tem</HI>
a later Date than the Reign of <HI>David</HI> I.
<PB N="15" REF="18">
Touching this Matter one thing is certain,
that the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> was compiled in
the Reign of one of our <HI>Davids.</HI> The Au|thor,
whoever he be, declares in his Preface,
&startq;That he was commanded by King <HI>David</HI>
to compile this Work, with the Coun&s;el
and Advice of the whole Realm, that all
the Inhabitants thereof might learn and
have Knowledge of the &s;ame.&endq; What re|mains
is to determine which of the <HI>Davids</HI>
this was. If the Reader will indulge a &s;hort
Digre&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall make it evident, that it
was <HI>David</HI> the II. who reigned two Cen|turies
later than the other, the Di&s;tance of
who&s;e Reign from that of <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI>
affords &s;ufficient Time for the Ripening of
the Feudal Law. All the World knows,
that the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, after being buried in
Oblivion for Ages, came to be re&s;tored in
<HI>Italy</HI> by an Accident. The very Books of
that Law were under&s;tood to be lo&s;t pa&s;t
Recovery, till a Copy of the Pandects was
found in the Town of <HI>Amalphi anno</HI> 1127.
by <HI>Lotharius</HI> the Emperor, when he took
<PB N="16" REF="19">
that Town, in the War he carried on again&s;t
<HI>Rodger</HI> King of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Naples.</HI> The
Knowledge of it increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that it was
taught publickly by <HI>Vaccarius</HI> at <HI>Oxford</HI> about
the Year 1150, during the Reign of King
<HI>Stephen.</HI> This was as &s;wift a Progre&s;s as any
Science can be &s;uppo&s;ed to make; and there|fore
no Probability we had it in <HI>Scotland</HI> be|fore
that Time, nor con&s;equently in the Reign
of <HI>David</HI> the I. who died in the Year 1153.
The&s;e Facts will give Light to the Subject in
hand. The Author of the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;ta|tem</HI>
appears to be well acquainted with the
Civil Law, and frequently appeals to it as to
known Law. See <HI>lib. 2. c.</HI> 16. &sect; 2. The
<HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> therefore, compiled when
the Knowledge of the Civil Law was &s;pread
through <HI>Scotland,</HI> could not have a Being in
the Days of <HI>David</HI> I. and con&s;equently the
Argument is conclu&s;ive, that it was compiled
in the Days of <HI>David</HI> II.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to make out,
that the above remarkable Revolution in our
<PB N="17" REF="20">
Land Rights happened in the Reign of <HI>Mal|colm
Canmore.</HI> And if there is any thing in
the above Ob&s;ervations, it mu&s;t afford an ad|ditional
Conviction, that were one left to con|jecture,
the &s;aid Reign would be pitched up|on
before any other, for the Introduction of
the Feudal Law. This Law was brought in|to
<HI>England</HI> by a Conqueror, at lea&s;t one who
treated his new Subjects as a conquered Peo|ple.
It was evident, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of
Land by Tenure, threw great Weight into
the Scale of Royalty; and therefore, it will
not be &s;urpri&s;ing, that a neighbouring Prince
who under&s;tood his own Intere&s;t, &s;hould en|deavour
to copy after &s;o good an Example.
At the &s;ame time, there never was in the
Reign of any <HI>Scots</HI> King, &s;uch a Conflux of
Strangers into <HI>Scotland,</HI> as in the Days of
<HI>Malcolm Canmore; Engli&s;h</HI> e&s;pecially, &s;ome
of the highe&s;t Rank. By them the Fa&s;hion
was begun of Sirnames, many of which re|main
at this Day with our mo&s;t illu&s;trious
Families. 'Twas to keep Pace with <HI>England</HI>
that the new Titles of Earls and Barons were
<PB N="18" REF="21">
introduced; and we may readily believe, that
a politic King, who under&s;tood the Arts of
Government, would not &s;top &s;hort, but endea|vour
al&s;o to introduce the Feudal Law, which
he could not but &s;ee would tend greatly to
increa&s;e his Power and Authority; and the
Conviction founded upon the&s;e Circum&s;tan|ces
turns &s;tronger and &s;tronger, when we
con&s;ider, that the Practice of giving Charters
of Lands, is by our Antiquaries univer&s;ally
a&s;cribed to <HI>Malcolm Canmore.</HI> Many of our
old Families pretend to have had Charters
from that King, but none before his Time.
Now, &s;uppo&s;ing the Feudal Law to have been
as old in <HI>Scotland</HI> as <HI>Malcolm</HI> II. 'tis &s;carce
&s;uppo&s;able Charters would be of a later Date,
as &s;uch Writs &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;arily connected
with Feudal Grants.</P>
<P>AND this leads to the &s;econd Branch of the
Enquiry, by what Means, and after what
Manner were the Nobles prevailed upon, not
only to part with their Lands, but to &s;ubject
them&s;elves per&s;onally to Feudal Service.
<PB N="19" REF="22">
However the Matter might be at fir&s;t di&s;gui|&s;ed,
the total Surrender of Lands to the King
during the Minority of an Heir, and the Year's
Rent payable at the Entry of every Heir,
were no &s;light Perqui&s;ites to be yielded ra&s;hly.
The Matter is dark; and the Hi&s;torians have
touched it &s;o &s;lightly, that we have few Cir|cum&s;tances
to build Conjectures upon; and
what makes the Story &s;till more my&s;terious,
is, that we have Vouchers of extravagant Do|nations
of the Crown Lands by <HI>David</HI> I. in
favours of the Church. I cannot ea&s;ily re|concile
this with the Story told, that the King
gave away the whole Crown Lands, re&s;erving
nothing to him&s;elf but the <HI>Mutehill</HI> of <HI>Scoon.</HI>
'Tis true, there might have been Forfeitures
in the Interim; and if any one is &s;atisfied with
this Solution, I have nothing to object, only
the Interval betwixt the Reigns of <HI>Malcolm
Canmore</HI> and of his Son <HI>David</HI> I. is, I'm a|fraid,
too &s;hort to make this Solution be ge|nerally
reli&s;hed. At the &s;ame Time, King
<HI>David</HI>'s Liberality to the Church is condemn|ed
by every Writer as truly unju&s;t, with re|gard
<PB N="20" REF="23">
to his Succe&s;&s;ors, who were thereby de|prived
of their Birth-right, <HI>viz.</HI> the Patrimo|ny
of the Crown: And yet the Charge is &s;carce
well founded, if in Fact nothing was given
away, but forfeited Lands, which every King
is privileged to di&s;po&s;e of at his Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I CANNOT readily bring my&s;elf to believe,
that <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI> gave away the whole
Crown Lands, as is related. And on the o|other
hand, I can as little bring my&s;elf to be|lieve,
that by any Means le&s;s than ab&s;olute
Force, could the Bulk of the Nation be
brought to &s;ubmit to an Act &s;o vi&s;ibly preju|dicial
to them, that of &s;urrendering their whole
Lands to the King, and their Per&s;ons al&s;o,
re&s;erving only the U&s;ufruct, in Name of
Wages, for Services to be performed by them.</P>
<P>IN a Matter &s;o dark and intricate, I dare
venture no further, than to &s;ugge&s;t a few Con|jectures.
Before the Feudal Law was known
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I take it for granted, that our
People held their Lands without Writ, and
<PB N="21" REF="24">
that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was the Circum&s;tance which
determined the Property of Lands, as at this
Day it does of Moveables. Some Traces of
this we have remaining in the <HI>Orkney</HI> I&s;lands,
where the Feudal Law is &s;carce yet fully e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
If in&s;tead of introducing the Feudal
Law, all at once over the whole Kingdom,
it &s;hall be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI>
did no more but lay the Foundation of a Build|ing,
which was fini&s;hed by his Succe&s;&s;ors, the
Thing will be ea&s;ily credited: And touch|ing
the Engines made U&s;e of, we need not
be at a Lo&s;s, for we are directed to them by
our Authors. It was certainly the Crown
Lands which were made U&s;e of as the Bait
to allure the Nobles. A prudent Di&s;tributi|on
of Part of the&s;e Crown Lands, without
&s;uppo&s;ing the whole to be aliened, would go
a great Way. No Per&s;on upon whom Crown
Lands were be&s;towed, could refu&s;e to hold
them upon any Conditions the King was plea|&s;ed
to impo&s;e. Here was a Beginning given
to the Feudal Tenure. If the Gift was con|&s;iderable,
the Receiver could not hand&s;omely
<PB N="22" REF="25">
avoid allowing his own E&s;tate to be engro&s;&s;ed
in the Charter, if &s;uch a Thing was demand|ed
of him. And &s;uch Stratagems would not
be overlooked by an artful Monarch, who
had it at Heart to make the Feudal Law uni|ver&s;al
in his Kingdom.</P>
<P>HE had another Engine at hand. It is un|controverted,
that it was <HI>Malcolm Canmore</HI>
who introduced the Titles of Earl and Baron.
Po&s;&s;ibly he had a further De&s;ign in this, than
merely to emulate the Splendour of a neigh|bouring
Court. Our Forefathers were fond
of Titles, and were delighted with Shew and
Equipage. If &s;ome were tempted by a new
Title to give up their Independency, and to
accept of their own E&s;tates as a Gift from the
King, holding of him by military Tenure,
we will cea&s;e to wonder-at the unequal Pur|cha&s;e,
when we &s;ee &s;o many at pre&s;ent re|nouncing
their Independency, and giving them|&s;elves
up as Slaves to a Court for Ribbands
and Garters, &s;till more empty Geugaws, if
po&s;&s;ible, than Titles of Honour.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">
THE Foundation being thus happily laid,
the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> had many Opportu|nities
to carry on the Work. Our Forefa|thers
were a fierce and re&s;tle&s;s People; Pro|perty
was in a continual Flux by Forfeitures;
and 'tis probable, that the Bulk of the <HI>Terra
firma</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> has, by that Means, pa&s;&s;ed
through the Sovereign's Hands one time or
other. This afforded ample Means of exten|ding
the Feudal Law further and further, as
Care was always taken to make out Gifts of
Forfeiture in the Feudal Form.</P>
<P>ONE other Cau&s;e there was of the Growth
of the Feudal Law, which, tho' working
&s;ilently and imperceptibly, had I'm per&s;uaded
a greater Effect than all the other Cau&s;es
combined together.</P>
<P>MANKIND, e&s;pecially in ignorant Ages,
are governed by Cu&s;tom and Habit. By the
Growth of the Feudal Law, a Charter cer|tainly
came to be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
Title to Land, &s;o as to give Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="24" REF="27">
alone, without a Charter, a very &s;lender Hold
of the Imagination. Perhaps this had no re|markable
Effect upon old Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. But
&s;ingular Succe&s;&s;ors, whether Creditors or Pur|cha&s;ers,
were in a different Situation. People
who part with their Money will not be rea|dily
&s;atisfied with any Title that is not of the
be&s;t Sort. Thus, after the Commerce of
Land was introduced, we may tru&s;t that
Charters were multiplied exceedingly. For
whatever Security a Family might have from
a long continued Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the Notion would
in time be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that there was
no &s;ecure Manner of transferring Land Pro|perty
but by Charter and Sa&s;ine.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, my Conjecture is, that the Feudal
Law was not introduced all at once, as our
Authors in&s;inuate, but by Degrees. And
what I have often heard, favours this Conjec|ture,
that &s;o late as the Reign of <HI>Iames</HI> VI.
there were Proprietors in <HI>Scotland</HI> who never
had accepted of a Charter.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28">
IF I am not deceived, this was a Mea&s;ure
the mo&s;t politic, and of the greate&s;t Fore|ca&s;t,
that ever was contrived. It was a bold
Game for the King to play away his Crown
Lands for a &s;mall Con&s;ideration in hand; but
the Pro&s;pect was fair, as no Con&s;titution does
more firmly unite a People with their Sove|reign,
than that of the Feudal Law, nor gives
him &s;uch an immediate Hold of the Per&s;ons
and Property of his Subjects. Our Hi&s;to|rians
give us to under&s;tand, that a prevailing
De&s;ire to &s;upport the Dignity of the Crown,
gave Ri&s;e to the Feudal Law in <HI>Scotland.</HI>
I'm &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that In&s;tances of pub|lic
Spirit, even among Individuals, are rare
in our Hi&s;tory. But I have read of no In|&s;tance
of an univer&s;al public Spirit through
a whole Nation, &s;ufficient to bring about &s;uch
a Revolution; one excepted, among the <HI>La|cedemonians,</HI>
in the Days of their King <HI>Ly|curgus</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nor is the Evidence of this Piece of Hi&s;tory altoge|ther above Exception. <HI>Xenophon,</HI> who writes a Treati&s;e upon the <HI>Spartan</HI> Government, has not a Word of it.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB REF="29">
<HEAD>ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CONSTITUTION of PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Feudal Con&s;titutions, every Su|perior
had a Juri&s;diction within his
own Territory: His Va&s;&s;als were obliged to
attend his Courts, and it was their Province
to try all Cau&s;es, Civil and Criminal, in Form
of a Jury or Inque&s;t. This is the Form of
our County Courts at this Day, held at &s;tated
Times by the High Sheriff, in Name of the
King; the Crown Va&s;&s;als being all of them
bound to appear under a Penalty, each in the
Court of the County within which his Lands
are &s;ituated. The Parliament is the King's
Court for the Kingdom in general, and con|&s;equently
his whole Va&s;&s;als within the King|dom
were bound to give their Attendance
there. The Barons and Freeholders attended
in this Capacity. The Bi&s;hops, Abbots and
Priors attended in the &s;ame Capacity; and if
any of them held their Lands of a Subject,
they certainly were not bound to perform this
Service.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">
THE Idea of a King, where the Feudal
Law took Place, is not that of a chief Magi|&s;trate
or Governor, but that of a Paramount
Superior, having the whole Property of the
Kingdom ve&s;ted in him, having his Va&s;&s;als
attached to him by Homage and Fealty, and
&s;upported by him out of the Produce of his
Lands: which makes a very &s;trict Connection
and Union betwixt them. The Idea of a Par|liament,
as I have &s;aid, is that of a Court
where all the King's Va&s;&s;als are obliged to at|tend
for admini&s;trating of Ju&s;tice, and for
making Regulations to bind the whole Society.</P>
<P>IT was one E&s;&s;ect of the Feudal Law to
withdraw Land from Commerce. Land be|ing
allotted for the Maintenance of Servants
of Va&s;&s;als, ready to obey their Ma&s;ters Com|mands
in War and Peace, the Superior could
not &s;ell, becau&s;e the whole Profits ari&s;ing from
the Subject belonged to the Va&s;&s;al, and the
Va&s;&s;al could not &s;ell becau&s;e he was not Pro|prietor.
This was an unnatural Con&s;titution,
which could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t long in peaceable
<PB N="29" REF="31">
Times. The Severity of the Feudal Law
gave Place by Degrees to milder and more na|tural
Regulations. Land the mo&s;t de&s;irable
Acqui&s;ition came to be <HI>in commercio,</HI> and the
Crown Va&s;&s;als originally few in Number, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing large Territories were greatly mul|tiplied.
Purcha&s;ers were willing to hold of
the King rather than of a Subject; and the
King was willing to encourage this Com|merce,
as it le&s;&s;ened the Power of the great
Barons. In Time the obliging &s;o many &s;mall
Va&s;&s;als to an expen&s;ive Attendance in Parlia|ment,
was con&s;idered as a Grievance. In
<HI>England</HI> this Grievance was remedied, pro|bably
in the Days of <HI>Iohn</HI> or <HI>Henry</HI> III. for
the Record of that Tran&s;action is lo&s;t. The
Remedy was introduced with us later, and we
have the Record entire. By the Act 101,
<HI>Parl.</HI> 1427, the Attendance of &s;mall Barons
and Freeholders is di&s;pen&s;ed with, provided
they &s;end to Parliament, from every Shire,
two or more of their Number to repre&s;ent
them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
WE followed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;o clo&s;e in all
their Regulations concerning Law and Policy,
that I am per&s;uaded our Statute 1427. has
been copied from &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Statute enact|ed
by King <HI>Iohn,</HI> or in the Beginning of the
Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. which is now lo&s;t with
the other Statutes of that Period. One thing
is certain, that we find Knights of the Shire
elected by the &s;maller Crown Va&s;&s;als, pre|ci&s;ely
as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> early in the Reign of
<HI>Henry</HI> III. But this is not all. We find by
King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Charter of Privileges to his <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Subjects, Sections 17. and 18. that it was
the Practice in his Days to &s;ummon to Parlia|ment
the greater Barons by Name, leaving
the le&s;&s;er Barons and Freeholders to be &s;um|moned
by the Sheriffs edictally, or in general
Terms. Here we have the le&s;&s;er Barons at|tending
per&s;onally. From the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI>
III. downwards, the &s;mall Barons and Free|holders
never did Duty in Parliament, other|ways
than by &s;ending &s;ome of their Number
out of each Shire to repre&s;ent them. This
makes it extremely evident, that the Atten|dance
<PB N="31" REF="33">
of the &s;mall Barons and Freeholders
mu&s;t in <HI>England</HI> have been di&s;pen&s;ed with, as
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon Condition of their &s;ending
Repre&s;entatives. Their withdrawing from
Parliament might have been overlooked; but
&s;o pointed a Regulation, as that of acting by
Delegates, could never have been introduced
otherways than by a Statute. The thing de|&s;erves
to be attended to, becau&s;e it laid the
Foundation of a Hou&s;e of Commons, of
which more fully afterwards.</P>
<P>WHETHER the Royal Burrows were ori|ginally
con&s;tituent Members of the Parliament
is a Point much debated. It is ob&s;erved,
&startq;That the <HI>Reddendo</HI> of their Charters being
Watching and Warding only, they were
not bound to give Suit and Pre&s;ence in any
of the King's Courts; that they had a Court
peculiar to them&s;elves, which was the
Chamberlain Ayr; that <HI>de facto</HI> there is no
In&s;tance of their ever appearing in a Coun|ty
Court, and con&s;equently no Rea&s;on to
believe they appeared originally in Parlia|ment;
<PB N="32" REF="34">
and that in <HI>England</HI> there is no E|vidence
upon Record, of Burge&s;&s;es being
called to Parliament, before 49. <HI>Henry</HI> III.
at which time Writs were directed to the
Sheriffs of the &s;everal Counties, to return
the Knights of the Shire and Burge&s;&s;es;
whence 'tis conjectured, that the calling of
the Burge&s;&s;es to Parliament was a Politic of
<HI>Simon de Montfort,</HI> who had at that Time
the Power of the Kingdom in his Hands,
and who called the Parliament 49. <HI>Henry</HI>
III. in order to purge him&s;elf from Su&s;pi|cions
&s;pread abroad of his intending to u&s;urp
the Crown.&endq; One Fact mu&s;t be owned,
with regard to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that in a Preamble
to <HI>Robert Bruce'</HI> s Laws &s;till extant, the whole
Orders are faithfully enumerated; Bi&s;hops,
Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and other
Noblemen of the Realm, without a Word of
Burge&s;&s;es. In a Preamble to the Laws of
<HI>Robert</HI> III. Burge&s;&s;es are mentioned for the
fir&s;t Time; and the Conjecture is, that many
of the noble Families having been extingui&s;h|ed,
during the Struggles we had for Liberty
<PB N="33" REF="35">
again&s;t the two <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> King
<HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> in order to recruit the Parlia|ment,
found it nece&s;&s;ary to call the Royal
Burrows to a Participation of the Govern|ment.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING of the&s;e &s;pecious
Facts and Ob&s;ervations, I am of Opinion,
that the Royal Burrows made originally one
of the E&s;tates of Parliament. What deter|mines
me to think &s;o, are the following Rea|&s;ons:
In the fir&s;t Place, they are the King's
immediate Va&s;&s;als, and therefore bound to
Attendance equally with the Barons and Pre|lates;
<HI>Suit and Pre&s;ence</HI> in the Superior's
Courts being a Duty e&s;&s;ential to every Feudal
Holding, unle&s;s where expre&s;ly remitted.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Attendance in Parliament, in old
Times, being reckoned a Burden or Service,
by no Means a Privilege, the Royal Burrows
would not have obeyed a Summons from the
King, unle&s;s they had been bound by their
Holding. And our Kings were by no Means
&s;o ab&s;olute, as by their mere Wills to intro|duce
<PB N="34" REF="36">
a Regulation of this general and impor|tant
Nature. And in the <HI>third</HI> Place, Sup|po&s;ing
the King's Authority great enough to
oblige the Burrows to &s;ubmit to this En|croachment
upon their Privileges, we cannot
&s;uppo&s;e &s;o wi&s;e and ju&s;t a Prince as <HI>Robert
Bruce</HI> would undertake &s;uch a violent Mea|&s;ure,
not only without Nece&s;&s;ity, but where
a more natural Remedy was at hand. For if
many noble Families were extingui&s;hed, their
E&s;tates &s;urely were not, which falling to the
Crown, by the Suppo&s;ition, through the Fail|ure
of Heirs, were an ample Fund for in|crea&s;ing
the Number of Crown Va&s;&s;als to fill
the Parliament. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> 'Tis pre&s;umable the
Commerce of Land had crept in before this
Time, and that the Crown Va&s;&s;als were ra|ther
more numerous than formerly. It is cer|tain,
they were &s;o greatly multiplied the very
next Century, that it was thought expedient
to exempt the &s;maller Barons from their At|tendance.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
AND in An&s;wer to what is urged on the
other Side, the <HI>Reddendo</HI> of Watching and
Warding proves nothing; many Services be|ing
due which are not expre&s;t in the Charter.
Witne&s;s the common Stile of Ward-holding,
<HI>Reddendo &s;ervitia &s;olita et con&s;ueta.</HI> It has
a &s;tronger Appearance, that Royal Burrows
have been all along exempted from attending
the County Courts. But this Indulgence,
and the having a Court peculiar to them|&s;elves,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Chamberlain Court, will not
infer their Exemption from Parliaments,
where Laws are made binding upon the whole
Kingdom; whereas judicial Proceedings were
the only Subject-matter of Chamberlain Ayrs,
nothing being there tran&s;acted relating to pub|lic
Policy or Government.</P>
<P>THO' there is no Mention of calling Bur|ge&s;&s;es
to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament before the
49. <HI>Henry</HI> III. it appears to me a very lame
Inference, That the Practice began at this
Time, when we find the Records of preceed|ing
Tran&s;actions &s;o imperfect. At the &s;ame
<PB N="36" REF="38">
Time, were the&s;e Records entire, and were
there no In&s;tance before that Period of a Writ
directed to the Sheriff for calling Borge&s;&s;es to
Parliament, it would not follow, that the
Royal Burrows were no &s;ooner a&s;&s;umed as a
Branch of the Legi&s;lature. This mu&s;t be ex|plained.
It is mentioned above, to have been
the Practice in King <HI>Iohn</HI>'s Days, to call on|ly
the greater Barons by Name, and to leave
the le&s;&s;er Barons and Freeholders to be &s;um|moned
by the Sheriffs edictally, or in general
Terms. Probably the Repre&s;entatives from
Burrows were ranked with the le&s;&s;er Barons,
and not honoured with a per&s;onal Citation.
When the Attendance of the &s;maller Barons
came to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, upon their &s;end|ing
Repre&s;entatives, this Change in the Con|&s;titution
introduced an Alteration in the Stile
of the Writs directed to the Sheriffs. In&s;tead
of the old Form, enjoining the Sheriff to no|tify
publicly the Holding of the Parliament,
that all who were bound might attend, he
was commanded &s;pecially to return two
Knights of the Shire: This made it nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="37" REF="39">
to be equally &s;pecial with regard to the Re|pre&s;entatives
of the Burrows; and therefore,
in the Writ, he was directed to return two
Knights and two Burge&s;&s;es: This Circum|&s;tance
therefore proves nothing further than
that in <HI>Henry</HI> III's Time, the Stile of the
Writ was changed and made &s;pecial, when it
was before in general Terms. But further,
the Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e are a &s;trong E|vidence
to me, that this was not the fir&s;t Time
the Attendance of the Burrows in Parliament
was required. Hi&s;torians mention, that this
Parliament was called by <HI>Montfort,</HI> in order
to purge him&s;elf of a Su&s;picion, which was
gaining Ground, of his aiming at the Crown.
It is not &s;aid he had any particular Connecti|on
with the Burrows, to make their Pre&s;ence
of U&s;e to him; and unle&s;s it were in &s;ome
&s;uch View, I cannot imagine, that <HI>Montfort</HI>
would, in the&s;e tickli&s;h Circum&s;tances, think
of making any Alteration in the Con&s;titution.
At the &s;ame Time, the plain and &s;imple Stile
of the Writ proves it to have been a common
and known Writ of the Law of <HI>England.</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="40">
Had any thing extraordinary been enjoined,
it mu&s;t have been introduced with a Preamble
to &s;upport the Command; e&s;pecially, as this
was not a Matter of Cour&s;e, but a Summons,
which the Burrows were not bound to obey.</P>
<P>I HAVE been the fuller upon this Point, as
it tends to a&s;certain what was the original
Con&s;titution of Parliament, that all the King's
Va&s;&s;als, and no other Va&s;&s;als, were the con|&s;tituent
Members. As per&s;onal Attendance
was required, there was no Place for Repre|&s;entatives,
unle&s;s from the Burrows. It would
have been an Hard&s;hip intolerable, to oblige
the whole Community to per&s;onal Attend|ance;
and therefore we may well &s;uppo&s;e,
that in all Times this Attendance has been
di&s;pen&s;ed with, upon &s;ending a few of their
Number to repre&s;ent them. This was origi|nally
the only Repre&s;entation, properly &s;o
called.</P>

<HI>Scotland</HI> the&s;e Va&s;&s;als had &s;o little Attention
to the Public, that they were &s;atisfied with
their Exemption, without thinking of fulfil|ling
the Condition by &s;ending Repre&s;entatives,
'till the Regulation was enforced by a new
Law; of which afterwards. Probably in
<HI>England</HI> the Ca&s;e would have been the &s;ame,
but for the peculiar Circum&s;tances of the
Times. One thing appears, that in a Par|liament
held by <HI>Henry</HI> III. <HI>anno</HI> 1258, there
were but twelve Repre&s;entatives from the
&s;mall Barons. Yet &s;oon thereafter, the Strug|gles
betwixt the King and his great Barons
drawing to a Head, there were in the Parlia|ment
1264. no fewer than four Knights for
each County. This full Repre&s;entation was
probably occa&s;ioned by the Anxiety of the
Barons, de&s;iring a numerous A&s;&s;embly to give
Weight to their Proceedings. And the Re|gulation
having once taken Place, would rea|dily
be kept up, without any new Impul&s;e,
with the Difference only of more or fewer
Repre&s;entatives from each County.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42">
THE &s;ending of Repre&s;entatives, in place
of the &s;mall Crown Va&s;&s;als, was but one Step
towards e&s;tabli&s;hing the Hou&s;e of Commons
of <HI>England</HI> in the Form it now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. Tho'
the King's Va&s;&s;als conveened in Parliament,
were di&s;tingui&s;hed into three E&s;tates, the Spi|ritual
Lords, the Temporal Lords or Barons,
and the Repre&s;entatives from the Royal Bur|rows,
we mu&s;t not be deceived as if they
made three different Bodies: They were all
equally the King's Va&s;&s;als, and compo&s;ed but
one Body politic, which &s;at and voted in one
Hou&s;e. And this Form continued in <HI>Scot|land</HI>
&s;o long as our Parliament &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, after
we had Repre&s;entatives from Shires as well as
before. In <HI>England,</HI> for many Centuries, the
greater Barons have made one Body, the Re|pre&s;entatives
from the Shires and Burrows ano|ther,
who &s;it in different Hou&s;es, and debate
and vote &s;eparately. At what Period was
this Form e&s;tabli&s;hed is altogether unknown,
&s;o far as I can learn; tho' the thing be ex|tremely
remarkable, by the Change it has
made in the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Go|vernment.
<PB N="41" REF="43">
This only is certain, that there
were two Hou&s;es of Parliament before the
1376; for, in a Parliament held that Year
<HI>Peter de la Mare</HI> is mentioned by Hi&s;torians
as Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, which
is a pretty &s;trong Evidence, that the Commons
were at that Time &s;eparated from the Peers,
having a Pre&s;ident or Speaker of their own;
for one Body cannot readily admit of two
Pre&s;idents.</P>
<P>As this Divi&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament
into two Bodies, was no nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence
of &s;ub&s;tituting Repre&s;entatives, in place of the
numerous Body of Electors, I am apt to ima|gine,
that the Difficulty of accommodating all
the Members in one Place has occa&s;ioned the
Separation. Parliaments were of old ambu|latory.
Scarce a great Town in <HI>England</HI> but,
one Time or other, has been honoured with
a Parliament. However ill accommodated,
there were no Means for a Separation, while
all the Crown Va&s;&s;als &s;at in their own Right:
for they could not think of making a &s;eparate
<PB N="42" REF="44">
Body of a few Repre&s;entatives from Burrows.
But after Repre&s;entatives were introduced, in
place of the &s;mall Va&s;&s;als of the Crown, a
Divi&s;ion into two Bodies was readily practi|cable,
by placing the Spiritual and Temporal
Lords in one Room, the Repre&s;entatives from
the &s;mall Crown Va&s;&s;als and from the Bur|rows
in another. This Practice probably had
its Beginning in Towns where no &s;ingle Room
was found large enough to accommodate the
whole Body, and has been kept up in other
Towns, where there was not the &s;ame Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
po&s;&s;ibly by the Authority of the Peers,
upon whom it conferred an additional Lu&s;tre.
The Silence of Hi&s;torians favours this Con|jecture.
Had this Divi&s;ion of the Parliament
been the Re&s;ult of any &s;olemn Act, whether
of the Parliament it&s;elf, or of the King and
Council, &s;uch a Regulation could not readily
have e&s;caped Notice. However this be, the
&s;plitting of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament into two
Bodies, laid the Foundation of a great Change
in the Con&s;titution. And this Event, among
many, is an In&s;tance of Revolutions which
<PB N="43" REF="45">
&s;pring from the mo&s;t accidental or tran&s;itory
Circum&s;tances, and for that Rea&s;on extreme|ly
ob&s;cure in their Origin, however grand in
their pre&s;ent Appearance.</P>
<P>As our <HI>Iames</HI> I. was perfectly well ac|quainted
with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, by his
long Re&s;idence in <HI>England,</HI> it appears to have
been his Plan to introduce into his own King|dom
many of the Laws and Cu&s;toms of that
Country. What we have at pre&s;ent to take
Notice of, are contained in the above menti|oned
Statute, Act 101. Parl. 1427. <HI>1&s;t</HI> ex|empting
the &s;mall Barons and Freeholders
from Attendance in Parliament, upon Condi|tion
of &s;ending Repre&s;entatives; <HI>2d,</HI> making
the&s;e Repre&s;entatives perhaps, with the Re|pre&s;entatives
from the Burrows, a &s;eparate
Body, which appears from the Regulation
appointing a Pre&s;ident to be cho&s;en, called
the common Speaker of the Parliament; <HI>3d,</HI>
enacting that the Prelates and Peers &s;hould be
called to Parliament <HI>nominatim</HI> by &s;pecial Pre|cepts.
Touching the fir&s;t of the&s;e Regulati|ons,
<PB N="44" REF="46">
of which mention has been made above,
we don't find that the Act took Effect. The
&s;mall Va&s;&s;als of the Crown, who had their
own more than the public Intere&s;t at Heart,
laid hold of the Exemption given them, with|out
thinking of &s;ending Repre&s;entatives, be|cau&s;e
the&s;e Repre&s;entatives were to be &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
at the Charge of their Con&s;tituents.
And the Prelates and great Lords, in whom
the Power of the Parliament centered after
this Regulation, had no Intere&s;t to enforce it.
The King indeed had an Intere&s;t, in order to
balance the exorbitant Power of the Nobles;
but in the&s;e rude Times this was overlooked,
in&s;omuch that a Statute was obtained in the
Reign of <HI>Iames</HI> II. <HI>viz.</HI> Act 75. Parl. 1457,
relieving all Freeholders from Attendance,
who&s;e yearly Rent did not amount to 20 <HI>l.</HI>
without a Word of their being obliged to
&s;end Repre&s;entatives. Matters continued upon
this Footing till the Days of <HI>Iames</HI> VI. &s;ave
that by the Act 78. Parl. 1503. all were ex|empted
from Attendance who&s;e Rent was
within One hundred Merks. The Reforma|tion
<PB N="45" REF="47">
greatly increa&s;ed the Power of the No|bility,
as it almo&s;t extingui&s;hed the Prelates.
The Abbacies were totally demoli&s;hed; and
but few of the Bi&s;hops frequented the Parlia|ment.
By this Means the Nobility had all in
their Power: They oppre&s;t the Burrows, and
were too &s;trong for the King. Thus the
Government became purely Ari&s;tocratical, and
&s;tood in need of &s;ome Regulation to bring it
to its former Poi&s;e. Had the Act of <HI>Iames</HI> I.
been followed out, in the &s;ame Manner as the
like Regulation was followed out in <HI>England,</HI>
this Evil would have been prevented: and
now the only Remedy was to revive that Act.
The Surpri&s;e is, that a Majority was found
among the Nobility, to countenance a Regu|lation,
which behoved remarkably to abridge
their Authority. It appears from the Statute
which is the 114. Parl. 1587. that great Op|po&s;ition
was made. The Attendance of the
&s;mall Barons in Parliament was &s;o thoroughly
in De&s;uetude, that they could not now think
of re&s;uming as a Privilege, what they had &s;o
long been exempted from, con&s;idered as a
<PB N="46" REF="48">
Service. But it had all along been under&s;tood
to be the Prerogative of the Crown, acknow|ledged
in every Statute relating to the Parlia|ment,
that the King might call, by &s;pecial
Writ, any of his Va&s;&s;als he had a-mind, not|with&s;tanding
of their Exemption. Probably
this has been the In&s;trument made u&s;e of by
the King's Mini&s;ters, to gain the End pro|po&s;ed:
The Nobles would be told, that if
they voted again&s;t the Regulation, the King
would u&s;e his Privilege of calling to Parlia|ment
a Number of his &s;mall Va&s;&s;als, &s;ufficient
to over-balance the Nobility. As this is but
mere Conjecture, it is &s;ubmitted to the Judg|ment
of others. One thing is certain, that
the Act 1427. was revived, and the &s;mall
Barons &s;ent Repre&s;entatives to Parliament
from that Period downwards.</P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned above, that it was a
Part of the Plan of <HI>Iames</HI> I. to divide his Par|liament
into two Bodies, as in <HI>England.</HI>
This was not followed by <HI>Iames</HI> VI. for our
Parliament continued one Body to the End.
<PB N="47" REF="49">
It is left to conjecture, whether this was of
De&s;ign. or by Accident; for our Hi&s;torians
are extremely defective upon our civil Tran|&s;actions.
We have no Occa&s;ion to go further
than to <HI>England,</HI> to learn what Influence it
has upon the Con&s;titution to divide a Parlia|ment
into two Hou&s;es; and as it was a poli|tic
Age, this of <HI>Iames</HI> VI. I am apt to be|lieve,
it was not without De&s;ign, that the
Parliament of this Kingdom was continued
upon its old Footing. This is a curious Sub|ject,
and de&s;erves to be attended to. It is
pretty obvious, that the King's Negative a|gain&s;t
a Regulation agreed to by both Hou&s;es
is not a very valuable Privilege. The Opini|on
of the two Hou&s;es, being under&s;tood the
Sen&s;e of the Nation, has rather too great
Force to be re&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Veto</HI> of any &s;ingle
Man, the King not excepted. His refu&s;ing
an A&s;&s;ent in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, is virtually declaring
him&s;elf again&s;t the Intere&s;t of his People. But
an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarch is &s;eldom brought under
this Dilemma. If he can but get a Majority
in either Hou&s;e on his Side, the Work is done.
<PB N="48" REF="50">
He may appear to be neuter. Thus taking
the Parliament complexly, a great Majority
may be again&s;t the King, bent, we may &s;up|po&s;e,
to fetter him by new Limitations; and
yet he may ward the Blow, can he but pro|cure
a &s;crimp Majority in either Hou&s;e for
him. This cannot happen where the Parlia|ment
makes but one Body, as in <HI>Scotland.</HI>
So far the Advantage lyes on the King's Side,
where the Parliament is compo&s;ed of two Bo|dies.
But to balance this, the &s;ame Advan|tage
lyes on the Side of the People, where
the King's Views are to enlarge his Preroga|tive
by Authority of Parliament; for a &s;crimp
Majority in either Hou&s;e, interpo&s;ing a <HI>Veto,</HI>
fru&s;trates his De&s;ign. In a Word, a &s;ingle
Body gives great Opportunities of making En|croachments
on either Side; whereas, &s;up|po&s;ing
the Con&s;titution to be &s;ound and en|tire,
it is be&s;t pre&s;erved &s;o, $y a Parliament
compo&s;ed of two Bodies.</P>
<P>So far the Scales &s;eem to hang upon the
Level. But then &s;eldom is a Nation &s;o uni|ted,
<PB N="49" REF="51">
as to think of making Encroachments
upon the Prerogative Royal: Whereas the
King, a &s;ingle Per&s;on, has many Opportuni|ties,
and &s;eldom wants Inclination to enlarge
his Powers. King <HI>Iames</HI> and his Mini&s;ters
could not but be &s;en&s;ible of this, and there|fore
a &s;ingle Body was their Game. But the
Contrivance lay a little deeper; and this may
be di&s;covered, by attending to one Branch of
the Con&s;titution of the Parliament, peculiar
to <HI>Scotland.</HI> At what Time it was that the
Lords of the Articles were e&s;tabli&s;hed, is un|certain.
But as the Se&s;&s;ions of our Parlia|ment
were generally very &s;hort, it was found
nece&s;&s;ary, when Bu&s;ine&s;s multiplied, to elect
a certain Number out of every State, to pre|pare
and dige&s;t Matters that were to be laid
before the Parliament, for their Determina|tion.
This &s;elect Body was called the Lords
of the Articles; and &s;uch was the e&s;tabli&s;hed
Practice, that no Bu&s;ine&s;s could be laid before
the Parliament, but what was prepared by
the&s;e Lords. This was in Reality a Negative
before Debate, which is of va&s;tly greater Im|portance
<PB N="50" REF="52">
than the King's Negative after; and
the wor&s;t of all is, that there was no Reme|dy,
in our Con&s;titution, again&s;t the Partiali|ty
of the Lords of the Articles, however glar|ing
it might be. A Body thus con&s;tituted,
could not fail in Time to engro&s;s the whole
Power of the Parliament. And in Fact it
came to this at the Long-run, that Parlia|ments
commonly &s;at but two Days. On the
fir&s;t Day of their Meeting, they cho&s;e the
Lords of the Articles, an equal Number out
of each E&s;tate, to whom the King joined
eight of his Crown Officers. The&s;e received
all the Grievances or Articles that were
brought to them, and formed them into Bills,
or rejected them at their Plea&s;ure. When all
Matters were ready, the Parliament &s;at ano|ther
Day, and approved or rejected the Bills
that were laid before them.</P>
<P>SUCH was the Practice in the 1587, when
the Act of <HI>Iames</HI> I. was revived. The King had
a fair Chance to &s;ecure the Lords of the Arti|cles
for him, whether by influencing their Elec|tion,
<PB N="51" REF="53">
or by gaining them over after they were
elected. At any Rate eight Officers of State,
devoted to the King, mu&s;t have had great In|fluence
in &s;o &s;mall a Body. By this Means
the King was pretty &s;ecure, that nothing could
be brought into Parliament without his Ap|probation.
But even this Security was not
reckoned &s;ufficient. About this very Time,
or &s;oon after, a Scheme was laid and execut|ed
to improve upon the above Regulation.
Under Pretext of the Lords of the Articles
not having &s;ufficient Time to overtake the
Multiplicity of Affairs laid before them, four
Per&s;ons were to be named out of each E&s;tate,
who&s;e Province it was to meet Twenty Days
before the Parliament, to receive all Suppli|cations,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to reject what they thought fri|volous
or improper, and to dige&s;t into a Book
what they cho&s;e to lay before the Lords of
the Articles. This was done by the Act 218,
Parl. 1594. The Act may be thought de|fective,
as no Provi&s;ion is made in it for the
Choice of this &s;elect Body. But this was pure|ly
an Artifice. It would have been too bare|faced
<PB N="52" REF="54">
to have named the King openly; for it
was the &s;ame with giving him a Negative be|fore
Debate. And yet it mu&s;t have been
obvious, that the Choice behoved to re&s;t up|on
the King; for a Body that was to meet
before the &s;itting of the Parliament, could
not po&s;&s;ibly be cho&s;en by the Parliament.
But as if this were not fully &s;ufficient to lodge
with the Crown the Power of directing Mat|ters
that were to be brought into Parliament,
it is further declared &startq;to be the Privilege of
the King, to bring directly into Parliament
all Matters concerning him&s;elf, or common
Good of the Realm.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Statute was too mani&s;e&s;t an En|croachment
upon the Liberty of the Subject
to be patiently &s;ubmitted to. It has for that
Rea&s;on been dropt; for I cannot otherways
conceive, what Need there was for the Ar|tifice
made U&s;e of by the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Charles</HI> I.
in the Parliament 1633, to &s;ecure the Lords
of the Articles for the Crown; to wit, that
the Bi&s;hops &s;hould chu&s;e eight Peers, and the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
Peers eight Bi&s;hops; and that the Sixteen e|lected
of the Bi&s;hops and Peers &s;hould joint|ly
chu&s;e eight Barons and eight Commi&s;&s;ion|ers
for Burrows. With the&s;e were joined the
Officers of State; and thus were the Lords of
the Articles con&s;tituted, the Chancellor to be
Pre&s;ident in all their Meetings. The Arti|fice
here is obvious. The Bi&s;hops were uni|ver&s;ally
in the Intere&s;t of the Crown, as they
have been at all Times; and upon all Occa&s;i|ons.
The eight Peers elected by them were
&s;ure Cards for the Crown, &s;uppo&s;ing but
eight of &s;o numerous a Body capable of &s;uch
a Bias. As the whole Bi&s;hops were for the
Crown, it was indifferent which Eight were
cho&s;en; and we may be certain, that none
would be cho&s;en out of the Commons, but
what were for the King's Purpo&s;e, when &s;uch
were the Electors. This Method we may
believe was not practi&s;ed by the Parliaments
during the Troubles. So far from it, that
the above mentioned Statute 1594 is expre&s;ly
re&s;cinded in the Parliament 1640. It was
judged too bold a Step to revive it after the
<PB N="54" REF="56">
Re&s;toration. But as the Parliaments both in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> which were called up|on
the Re&s;toration, were abundantly ob&s;e|quious
to the King's Mea&s;ures, another
Scheme was ventured upon very little more
di&s;gui&s;ed, which was to enact into a Law the
Contrivance fallen upon in the 1633, to &s;e|cure
the Lords of the Articles for the Crown.
This was done by the fir&s;t Act, Parl. 1663.
And thus by the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Scots</HI>
Parliament, nothing could be brought under
Deliberation but by the King's Authority,
or, which is the &s;ame, by the Authority of
his Creatures the Lords of the Articles, which
was an ab&s;olute Bar to all Hopes of any
Laws for &s;ecuring the Liberty of the Sub|ject.
On the other hand, he had a much
better Pro&s;pect of carrying through Laws
for his own Benefit, than he had in <HI>Eng|land.</HI>
A Majority did his Affair, which
did not always an&s;wer in the other King|dom.
For &s;uppo&s;ing, upon the whole,
a Majority for the King, yet if there
<PB N="55" REF="57">
was a &s;crimp Majority in either Hou&s;e again&s;t
him, nothing could be carried on.</P>
<P>FOR my Part, I &s;hould have thought it le&s;s
criminal, in our Re&s;toration Parliament, to
have openly be&s;towed upon the King a Ne|gative
before Debate, than, in &s;uch an un|der-hand
artificial Manner, to betray their
Con&s;tituents and Nation. This will &s;tand as
a Monument of the wicked Enterpri&s;es of
Mini&s;ters, and of the Venality of our Parlia|ments;
and long may it &s;tand, if it do but
&s;erve as a Warning to guard us again&s;t &s;uch
opprobrious Devices, if &s;uch &s;hall ever again
be attempted again&s;t us.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the third Article of the Regu|lations
introduced by the Statute 1427. that
the Prelates and Peers &s;hould be called to Par|liament
by &s;pecial Precepts, we mu&s;t recapi|tulate
in a few Words what has been &s;aid
above, upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Form of calling a
Parliament. Originally Parliaments were cal|led
by i&s;&s;uing Brieves out of the Chancery to
<PB N="56" REF="58">
the &s;everal Sheriffs, directing them to &s;um|mon
publicly, or edictally, all tho&s;e who
were obliged to attend the Parliament. A
public Notification, probably at the Market-Cro&s;s
of the Shire, was thought &s;ufficient.
Over and above this general Summons, which
comprehended all the Ranks equally, a Form
was introduced, in the Reign of King <HI>Iohn,</HI>
of writing Letters to the Prelates and great
Lords by Name, acquainting them of the
Time and Place of holding the Parliament,
and requiring their Attendance. When Re|pre&s;entatives
were introduced in place of the
&s;mall Barons, the general Summons was laid a|&s;ide
as u&s;ele&s;s. The great Barons were called by
&s;pecial Letters, and the Brieves, now directed
to the Sheriffs, came to be more &s;pecial, or|dering
them to return two Knights out of
every Shire, and two Burge&s;&s;es out of every
Burgh; which Form is continued down to
this Day. In <HI>Scotland</HI> the &s;mall Barons, lay|ing
hold of their Exemption, without &s;ending
Repre&s;entatives to Parliament, the general or
edictal Citation continued in U&s;e as formerly,
<PB N="57" REF="59">
with this Addition only, that, be&s;ides the ge|neral
Citation, Letters came to be directed to
every one of the great Lords in particular.
There was not the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity here to al|ter
the Form of Citation, that there was in
<HI>England:</HI> The general Summons an&s;wered
the Purpo&s;e now as well as formerly; for,
not comprehending any but who were bound
to give Attendance, it readily accommodated
it&s;elf to the new Regulations, exempting from
Attendance tho&s;e who&s;e yearly Rent was un|der
a certain Sum. That the general and
&s;pecial Summons were u&s;ed at the &s;ame time,
is clear from an Order of <HI>Iames</HI> III. entered
in the Records of Parliament 21&s;t <HI>Feb.</HI> 1487.
for di&s;&s;olving the Parliament, and calling a
new one. The Words are; &startq;We do you
to wit, that our Sovereign Lord, by the
Advice of his Council, has, for certain rea|&s;onable
and great Cau&s;es de&s;erted and di&s;|&s;olved
his Parliament, that was continued
of before to the 5th of <HI>May</HI> next to come,
and has ordained a new general Parliament
to be &s;et, and proclaimed to be holden at
<PB N="58" REF="60">
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> the 12th Day of <HI>May</HI> next to
come, with Continuation of Days, and ge|neral
Precepts to pa&s;s to all Lords, Prelates,
Barons, Freeholders and Commi&s;&s;aries, and
with &s;pecial Letters under his Signet, to all
the Prelates and great Lords of his Realm,
to &s;hew and declare to them the Cau&s;e of
the &s;itting of his &s;aid Parliament.&endq;</P>
<P>I HAVE annexed a Copy of the Brieve i&s;|&s;ued
out of the Chancery for an edictal Cita|tion,
but I have not been &s;o lucky as to find
anywhere the Form of the &s;pecial Precept un|der
the Signet. Probably this Precept has
fallen by Degrees into Di&s;u&s;e, and the calling
of the Parliament been left to the edictal Ci|tation,
comprehending all Per&s;ons who were
bound to give Attendance. What confirms
me in this Opinion is the Statute 1587, &s;o
often above mentioned, directing Commi&s;&s;i|oners
to be cho&s;en for each Sheriffdom, and
their Names to be notified to the Director of
the Chancery. The Form of calling the&s;e
Commi&s;&s;ioners to Parliament is expre&s;t in the

<P>BY an edictal or general Summons one Be|nefit
ari&s;es to the Subject, which has not been
attended to when the Statute 1587 was made,
otherways 'tis probable this Form of Sum|mons
would have been laid a&s;ide, and that of
per&s;onal Citation taken up; for which there
was the better Colour, that it was but follow|ing
out the Plan laid down by <HI>Iames</HI> I. Up|on
<PB N="62" REF="64">
an edictal Citation, every Baron who has
a Seat is intitled to appear in Parliament, be|cau&s;e
he is called. But by a per&s;onal Citation,
Opportunity is given to drop out of the Li&s;t
any particular Baron the King is not plea&s;ed
with. Attendance in Parliament is a per&s;onal
Service, which cannot be performed by the
Va&s;&s;al, unle&s;s the Superior chu&s;e to accept of
it, and for this Rea&s;on it is not due, unle&s;s
demanded. A Baron therefore, who is not
called, cannot regularly take his Seat in Par|liament.
This Matter is well under&s;tood in
<HI>England,</HI> where many Times the Advantage
has been laid hold of, which a per&s;onal Cita|tion
gives the King. One remarkable In&s;tance
there is in a Parliament conveened by King
<HI>Henry</HI> III. <HI>anno</HI> 1255, when a great many
Lords were omitted to be &s;ummoned who
were not in the King's Intere&s;t. Nor at this

the Evil, other than the Danger that

<HEAD>ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HONOUR. DIGNITY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no Appetite in human Na|ture
more prevalent nor more univer|&s;al,
than that for Honour and Re&s;pect. And
the Plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from it is of the mo&s;t re|fined
Kind; Honour and Re&s;pect being by
Nature, a voluntary Tribute paid to intrin&s;ic
Merit. Hence it is, that no other Pa&s;&s;ion is na|turally
more friendly to Virtue. But tho' all
Men are fond of Re&s;pect, the Bulk of Man|kind,
unable or unwilling to purcha&s;e it at
&s;uch a Price as that of real Merit, endeavour
to &s;ecure it to them&s;elves at a cheaper Rate.
Early Attempts were made to annex it to the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of outward Advantages, and the
Law has been called in Aid to &s;upport the
artificial Connection. Thus, what ought to
be a Free-will Offering, is changed to a Mat|ter
of Right. We lay Claim to Honour, as if
it were our Property, and as if, like Land or
Goods, we were intitled to it by Law. And
the World has improved &s;o much upon this
<PB N="72" REF="73">
indolent Scheme, that the different Degrees
of Re&s;pect and Honour are nicely adju&s;ted by
Cu&s;tom, both in Language and Behaviour,
&startq;Qualities and Virtues being a&s;&s;igned to Per|&s;ons
of Rank, under the Titles of <HI>Graces,
Excellencies, Honours,</HI> and the re&s;t of this
mock Prai&s;e and mimical Appellation,&endq; as
is happily expre&s;t by an eminent Author.</P>
<P>IN a moral View nothing can be more
pernicious than this artificial Connection, as
it robs Worth and Merit of their proper
Reward, to annex it to the Goods of For|tune,
which without it have but too great In|fluence.
But con&s;idering the Matter politi|tically,
the fixing of artificial Marks of Worth,
which every one can di&s;cern, may be ju&s;tifi|ed.
Government could &s;carcely &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out
them. Real Merit is &s;o remote from
vulgar Apprehen&s;ion, that were Rulers to be
cho&s;en by this Standard, Differences and Di&s;|&s;en&s;ions
would be endle&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
HOWEVER this be, here ari&s;es a Di&s;tincti|on
betwixt Re&s;pect be&s;towed from the Opi|nion
of Merit, which may be called <HI>natural
Honour,</HI> and Re&s;pect be&s;towed upon the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Power and Riches, which may
be called <HI>artificial Honour.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the Ancients, this artificial Ho|nour
was but in its Infancy; yet in old <HI>Rome</HI>
we have a remarkable In&s;tance of it. There
was a Divi&s;ion of the People into <HI>Nobiles,
Novi,</HI> and <HI>Ignobiles,</HI> taken from the Right of
u&s;ing Pictures or Statues, an Honour allow|ed
to &s;uch only who&s;e Ance&s;tors, or them|&s;elves,
had born &s;ome curule Office. He
who had the Pictures or Statues of his An|ce&s;tors,
was termed <HI>Nobilis;</HI> he who had
only his own, <HI>Novus;</HI> he who had neither,
<HI>Ignobilis:</HI> So that <HI>jus imaginis</HI> was among
the old <HI>Romans</HI> like the Right of bearing a
Coat of Arms among us.</P>
<P>BUT this artificial Honour grew to a
greater Height in Cour&s;e of Time. Be&s;ides
<PB N="74" REF="75">
its Connection with the higher Offices in the
State, as among the <HI>Romans,</HI> it came to be an|nexed
to large Territories, and at la&s;t re&s;ted
upon Families, without Regard to Land or
Office. This was the Ca&s;e in all the <HI>Gothic</HI>
Con&s;titutions, and to the&s;e two Branches I
&s;hall confine my&s;elf, as they are the Founda|tion
of our pre&s;ent Notions of Dignity and
Honour.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e <HI>Gothic</HI> Con&s;titutions, Honour and
Dignity were originally annext to Lands and
Offices, and in no Ca&s;e to Per&s;ons or Fami|lies,
independent of Lands and Offices.</P>
<P>EARL or Count was the Name given to
the Governor of a Province. The Office
was of great Power and Authority, and could
not fail to have a con&s;iderable Share of Dig|nity
annext to it. <HI>Ba&s;nage,</HI> in his Cu&s;toms
of <HI>Normandy,</HI> ob&s;erves, that Counts were
the ordinary Judges of Provinces, that under
<HI>Charles</HI> the Simple, they began to be heredi|tary,
and that &s;ome few of them u&s;urped the
<PB N="75" REF="76">
Sovereignty. In the &s;ame Way an Earl in
<HI>England</HI> was the Judge or Governor of a
Shire, and his Office as well as Dignity for
Life only. <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror fir&s;t made
the Office feudal and hereditary, allotting the
third Penny of all the Pleas determined in the
Sheriff's Court, for Support of the Office.
This Acce&s;&s;ion of Wealth and Dignity had
the ordinary Effect. Earls became too great
to &s;ubmit to the Fatigue of Bu&s;ine&s;s. De|putes
were appointed in every County, upon
whom was devolved all the Drudgery Work
of the Magi&s;trate and Judge. And thus it
commonly happens, that the Per&s;on who
gets all the Pay, does nothing; while the Per|&s;on
who does all the Work, gets little or no
Pay. After the Introduction of the&s;e <HI>De|putes,
Vicecomites</HI> or <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> an Earldom
was no longer con&s;idered as a territorial Of|fice,
but as a territorial Dignity, which car|rying
a good deal of Splendor with it, came
to be a de&s;irable Object. As it no longer
had any Relation to a real County or She|riffdom,
fictitious or imaginary Counties were
<PB N="76" REF="77">
erected, in order to be&s;tow the Title of <HI>Earl</HI>
upon the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. And the&s;e Titles by
the Bounty of Princes, came to be multiplied
exceedingly; it being ob&s;erved with Regard
to Ribbons, Titles, and &s;uch like Marks of
Di&s;tinction, which take nothing from the
Granter, that of all Favours, they are be&s;tow|ed
with the be&s;t Grace. Rare Invention, this,
to reconcile, in &s;o happy a Manner, the Inte|re&s;ts
of the Giver and Receiver.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved above, that in the <HI>Gothic</HI>
Con&s;titutions, Honour and Dignity were an|next
to Lands as well as to Offices. In <HI>En|gland</HI>
a great E&s;tate held of the King, with
Power of Juri&s;diction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a <HI>Reddendo</HI>
of &s;o many Knights to &s;erve the King in his
Wars, commonly &s;tiled <HI>a Barony,</HI> had Dig|nity
or Honour annext to it; and from this
artificial Connection, it al&s;o got the Name of
<HI>an Honour,</HI> the Honour of <HI>Richmond,</HI> for Ex|ample,
of <HI>Wood&s;tock,</HI> &amp;c. And the Family
here was &s;o little regarded, that whoever pur|cha&s;ed
&s;uch an E&s;tate, with the King's Con|&s;ent,
<PB N="77" REF="78">
to be held of the Crown, was of Cour&s;e,
con&s;idered as a Baron, or Per&s;on of Honour.</P>
<P>ORIGINALLY the Union of Lands, erect|ed
into an Earldom or Barony, was conceived
to be &s;o intimate, that it became as it were an
identical Subject, not capable of Divi&s;ion or
Separation into Parts. And hence, in the old
Law of <HI>England,</HI> it was a Rule, that a Baro|ny
could not be &s;plit into Parts, but that the
whole behoved to be aliened together.</P>
<P>BUT this being a &s;trained Conception, re|pugnant
to more plain and natural Ideas, e|&s;pecially
where Parts of an Earldom or Ba|rony
are locally di&s;tinct one from another,
Nature prevailed over Art, and di&s;po&s;ing of
Parts of a Barony crept into Practice.</P>
<P>FOR &s;ome time after this Sort of Commerce
was introduced, territorial Honour was not
much affected by it. The Earldom or Ba|rony
&s;till remained in a great Mea&s;ure entire
with the Dignity annexed to it. But when,
<PB N="78" REF="79">
by the Arts of Peace, and Increa&s;e of Indu|&s;try,
Lands came to be more univer&s;ally the
Subject of Commerce, readily pa&s;&s;ing from
Hand to Hand, territorial Honour behoved
to be in an uncertain State. Let us &s;uppo&s;e,
that an Earldom or Barony has been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
for Ages by the &s;ame Family. The Family
falling into Decay, the E&s;tate is di&s;membered
Piece-mail, 'till little or nothing is left of it.
What is become, in the mean Time, of the
Dignity or Honour originally annexed to the
E&s;tate? For the E&s;tate being &s;plit into &s;mall
Parts, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed perhaps by mean Per&s;ons,
the Honour cannot follow any of the Parts.
Is the Idea then lo&s;t and gone? If it does &s;ub|&s;i&s;t,
where is the Object? The An&s;wer is,
That it is transferred from the E&s;tate to the
Family; and the Tran&s;ition is ea&s;y and natu|ral.
For tho' Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Earldom or
Barony, is the Foundation of the Re&s;pect paid
to the Family, yet the Family being the im|mediate
Object, Re&s;pect is paid by the Vul|gar
without attending to the legal Title, and
is continued to be paid even after the Title is
<PB N="79" REF="80">
gone. Thus in <HI>Germany,</HI> territorial Titles of
Honour are communicated to every Branch
of the Family, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no Land Pro|perty;
and therefore, no Wonder, that in
<HI>Britain,</HI> they &s;hould remain with the chief
Branch of the Family, after the E&s;tate is di|lapidated.</P>
<P>ONE Thing did greatly contribute to change
the Nature of Honour, by transferring Ho|nour
from Land to Families. It was <HI>Malcolm
Canmore,</HI> who, in Imitation of <HI>William</HI> the
Conqueror, introduced the territorial Digni|ties
of Earl and Baron, which produced Sir|names
not formerly in U&s;e. <HI>Malcolmus ter|tius,
&s;ublato Maccabaeo Tyranno, Regnum le|gittime
&s;ibi debitum, occupavit, quod, ut or|naret,
unic&acirc; cur&acirc; incubuit; tunc et a Praediis
nobilibus nomina qui&s;que &s;ump&s;it, et cum mag|na
frequen&s;que nobilitas S. Margaretam ex
Hungaria et Anglia &s;ecuta, in Scotia con&s;e|di&s;&s;et,
&s;plendorem novo &s;uo Principatui addi|turus,
Barones et Comites creavit. Demp&s;ter,</HI>
p. 120. The U&s;e of Sirnames had undoubt|edly
<PB N="80" REF="81">
the Effect to make a clo&s;er Union among
the &s;everal Parts of the compound Idea of a
Family, by binding all the&s;e Parts together
under one common Name; which tended to
facilitate the Connection betwixt a Family and
a Title of Honour, and made it as ea&s;y for
the Mind to re&s;t upon a Family for the Ob|ject
of Honour, as upon an E&s;tate.</P>
<P>IT will be obvious, that this Change in
the Nature of Honour, from territorial to per|&s;onal,
behoved to come on by Degrees. Even
after frequent In&s;tances of the Title remain|ing
with a Family, when the E&s;tate was en|tirely
or mo&s;tly di&s;membered, the Ca&s;e would
be different, when the Earldom or Barony
was di&s;poned whole and entire; for there the
Honour for many Ages, was certainly tran&s;|ferred
with the E&s;tate. Oppo&s;ite In&s;tances
behoved to breed a Confu&s;ion and Darkne&s;s
in the Idea of Honour, being &s;ometimes ap|plied
to Lands, &s;ometimes to Families, inde|pendent
of Lands. The Mi&s;t is cleared up
by Cour&s;e of Time. The Notion of territo|rial
<PB N="81" REF="82">
Honour is quite wore out, and at pre&s;ent
we have no Example of Honour, but what is
per&s;onal, and annexed to Families, indepen|dent
of Land. I have heard of no Exception
in this I&s;land, unle&s;s it be with relation to the
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Arundel,</HI> which at the &s;ame Time
appears to be a doubtful In&s;tance.</P>
<P>THO' territorial Honours be now at an End,
there remains one remarkable Con&s;equence
of them, which is in full Ob&s;ervance. It
is a Maxim in Law, that the King is the
Fountain of Honour, and that it is the Pre|rogative
of the Crown to be&s;tow Honours
and Dignities of all Kinds. It is not difficult
to come at the Foundation of this Privilege.
Tho' it anciently was the Privilege of every
Superior to unite di&s;contiguous Lands into
one artificial Subject, in favours of his Va&s;&s;al;
no Superior could unite Lands into an Earl|dom
or Barony, &s;ave the King, for a plain
Rea&s;on, that it is not called an Earldom or
Barony, unle&s;s it hold of the King. The
Honour which followed this Erection or Cre|ation
<PB N="82" REF="83">
was under&s;tood to flow from the King;
and as the King's Con&s;ent, <HI>qua</HI> Superior, is
requi&s;ite for tran&s;mitting an Earldom or Ba|rony
to a Purcha&s;er, hence the King came to
be con&s;idered as the Fountain of territorial
Honour, in the &s;ame Manner as he is the
Fountain of official Honour, by his Power
of appointing the Officers of the Crown.
Taking the Matter &s;trictly, it was not the
King who be&s;towed the Honour, but the
People. Nothing flowed from the Crown,
but the Office or the Barony, which carrying
great Power and Preheminence, were natu|rally
attended with Honour and Re&s;pect.
And &s;uppo&s;ing Honour to be a legal Acce&s;|&s;ory
of a Barony or Office, it will not follow,
that the King can crete Honour, independent
of a Barony or Office, which would be crea|ting
an Acce&s;&s;ory without a Principal. But
our Forefathers were by no Means accurate in
their Conceptions: And from the King's
Power of be&s;towing the Means of acquiring
Honour, to infer a Power of be&s;towing Ho|nour
independent of the&s;e Means, is no bet|ter
<PB N="83" REF="84">
Rea&s;oning, than to infer a Man's Power
of be&s;towing Knowledge without any Means,
from his Power of be&s;towing Riches, which
are one good Mean to acquire Knowledge. Yet
upon this, and no better Foundation, is the
King's Power built, of be&s;towing per&s;onal or
Family Honours, when the&s;e, by Degrees,
came to be &s;ub&s;tituted in Place of the other.</P>
<P>AND thus a new Di&s;tinction was, by De|grees,
introduced, betwixt Honour annexed
to Land or Office, and Honour annexed to
Per&s;ons, whether a &s;ingle Per&s;on or Family.
And this latter Sort of artificial Honour, I
&s;hall take the Liberty hereafter to call <HI>per&s;o|nal
Honour,</HI> tho' very different from that
Re&s;pect and Deference which is voluntarily
paid to certain Per&s;ons, from the Opinion of
real Worth.</P>
<P>THERE are pre&s;erved in <HI>England</HI> ma|ny
old Charters of the Creation of Earls,
which uniformly run in the Stile of a Grant
of an Office. When by the Multiplication of
<PB N="84" REF="85">
Earls beyond the Number of Sheriffdoms, an
Earldom &s;unk down to a mere territorial Dig|nity,
the Stile of the&s;e Charters was varied,
and the common Form was to erect Lands
into an Earldom, in favours of the Grantee
and his Heirs, which was under&s;tood to be
all that was nece&s;&s;ary to be&s;tow upon him the
territorial Dignity. Afterwards, when the
Notion of per&s;onal Honour crept in, certain
Solemnities were u&s;ed at the Creation of a
Peer, &s;uch as girding him with a Sword, co|vering
his Head with a Cap of Honour and
Circle of Gold, all of them Marks of per&s;o|nal
Re&s;pect. And now, both in <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the Notion of territorial Honour
being quite wore out, an Earl's Patent is &s;o
framed, as to import a mere per&s;onal Digni|ty,
without relation either to Office or to
Land.</P>
<P>WITH Regard to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the olde&s;t Pa|tent
of an Earl I have &s;een, is that granted to
<HI>Ranulph</HI> Earl of <HI>Murray.</HI> King <HI>Robert</HI> I.
grants certain Lands to him, and to the Heirs-male
<PB N="85" REF="86">
of his Body, to be held of the Crown
<HI>in libero comitatu.</HI> As no other Form or Ce|remony
was u&s;ed in creating this Gentleman
an Earl, the Charter is full Evidence, that in
tho&s;e Days the Title of an Earl was con&s;ide|red
as merely a territorial Dignity. A Copy
of the Charter is annext for the Satisfaction
of the curious. Another Charter I have read
of by King <HI>David</HI> II. &startq;in Favours of Sir
<HI>Malcolm Fleming</HI> Knight, and of the Heirs-male
of his Body, for his Homage and
worthy Services, of the Lands of <HI>Farynes,
Deall, Rynos,</HI> and the Burgh of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI>
with their whole Pertinents, and all the
King's Lands of the whole Sheriffdom
of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI> with the Advocation of the
Churches, and Right of Patronage of the
Mona&s;teries and Abbacies exi&s;ting within
the Sheriffdom; re&s;erving to his Maje&s;ty the
Right of Patronage of the Epi&s;copal See of
<HI>Whytehorn</HI> or <HI>Galloway.</HI> And al&s;o becau&s;e
the &s;aid Place of <HI>Wigtoun</HI> was lookt upon as
the principal Mannor of the whole She|riffdom
of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI> the King ordained,
<PB N="86" REF="87">
that the &s;aid <HI>Malcolm</HI> and his Heirs &s;hould
for ever take the Name of <HI>Earl,</HI> and be
called the Earls of <HI>Wigtoun.</HI> Further, the
&s;aid Lands are erected into a free Regality,
with Power to judge upon the four Ar|ticles
of the Crown. The &s;aid Earl and
his Heirs giving the Service of five Knights
or Soldiers to the King's Army. Dated
at <HI>Airth,</HI> 9th <HI>November,</HI> 1343.&endq; This
Creation of the Earl of <HI>Wigtoun</HI> I have cho&s;e
the rather to mention, becau&s;e of one no|table
Circum&s;tance which demon&s;trates the
Notion entertained in the&s;e Days of this Dig|nity,
that it was merely territorial, and went
along with the Lands to the Purcha&s;er, in the
&s;ame Manner that the Dignity of a Baron by Te|nure
did. Upon the 16th <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1371, a Char|ter
is granted by <HI>Thomas Fleming</HI> Earl of <HI>Wig|toun,</HI>
to <HI>Archibald</HI> of <HI>Douglas</HI> Knight of <HI>Gal|loway,</HI>
&startq;Whereby, for the Feuds betwixt
him and the great Men, and Inhabitants of
the Earldom of <HI>Wigtoun,</HI> and for 500 <HI>l.
Sterling</HI> paid him, he di&s;pones to the &s;aid
<HI>Archibald</HI> the fore&s;aid Earldom with the
<PB N="87" REF="88">
Pertinents.&endq; This Charter was confirm|ed
by <HI>Robert</HI> King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> 8th <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI>
1371. After this Alienation of the
Earldom, <HI>Thomas Fleming</HI> was no longer
con&s;idered as an Earl, of which among other
Writs the following Charter is full Evidence,
granted by <HI>Robert</HI> II. in which &startq;he con|firms
a Charter granted by the &s;aid <HI>Ro|bert
Fleeming,</HI> de&s;igned Laird of <HI>Fullwood,</HI>
to <HI>William Boyd,</HI> of a Wad&s;et of all the &s;aid
<HI>Thomas Fleming</HI>'s Lands within the Baro|ny
of <HI>Lenzie,</HI> for 80 <HI>l. Sterling.</HI>&endq; The
principal Charter is dated at <HI>Cumbernauld,</HI>
1372, and the Charter of Confirmation at
<HI>Kinghorn,</HI> 20th <HI>Iune,</HI> 1375. Further, that
the &s;aid <HI>Archibald Douglas</HI> Knight of <HI>Gal|loway,</HI>
did, after the Purcha&s;e of the Earl|dom,
take upon him the Title of Earl of
<HI>Wigtoun,</HI> appears by a Charter of Confir|mation
&s;till extant, granted by him to <HI>Chri|&s;tian
Ram&s;ay,</HI> of the Lands of <HI>Balencrief</HI> and
<HI>Gosford,</HI> dated 6th <HI>March</HI> 1422, which runs
thus, <HI>Omnibus hanc chartam vi&s;uris vel au|dituris,

<P>THERE is little Doubt of the gradual
Tran&s;ition, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as in <HI>England,</HI>
from the Notion of territorial to that of per|&s;onal
Dignity; and the Stiles of our late&s;t
Patents in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as in <HI>England,</HI>
are expre&s;&s;ive of nothing el&s;e but per&s;onal
Honour.</P>
<P>PROCEED we now to a more particular
Examination of the Dignity of Lord Baron.
In <HI>England,</HI> three &s;orts of Barons are taken
Notice of by Writers, Barons by <HI>Tenure,</HI>
Barons by <HI>Writ,</HI> and Barons by <HI>Creation.</HI>
Barons by Tenure are they who derive their
Dignity and Privileges from their Lands, the
&s;ame who are de&s;cribed above, under the
Name of <HI>territorial Barons.</HI> Barons by
Writ came to have a Being after the &s;maller
<PB N="89" REF="90">
Barons and Freeholders were exempted from
their Attendance in Parliament. The Ex|emption
was granted in <HI>England,</HI> as well as
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with a re&s;erved Power to the
King to require the Attendance of any of
them in Parliament, when he &s;hould &s;ee
Cau&s;e. This was done by a &s;pecial Writ, di|rected
by the King to the &s;mall Baron or
Freeholder, who&s;e Pre&s;ence was required,
and who was not otherwi&s;e bound to attend
the Parliament. But as this Writ, whether
we con&s;ider the Nature or Tenor of it, was
fulfilled by the Per&s;on's Attendance in that
particular Parliament to which he was called;
leaving him to enjoy his Privilege of Exemp|tion
from other Parliaments, when the Sum|mons
was not renewed, it does not readily
occur why this Writ &s;hould be thought to
be&s;tow any Degree of Nobility, whether per|&s;onal
or feudal. And &s;uppo&s;ing it did, the
Per&s;on thus &s;ummoned to Parliament was &s;till
a Baron by Tenure; becau&s;e none could be
&s;ubjected to this Summons, but tho&s;e who
held of the King <HI>in capite.</HI> This Di&s;tincti|on
<PB N="90" REF="91">
therefore is little to be regarded, and ac|cordingly
we have no Traces of it in our <HI>Scots</HI>
Antiquities.</P>
<P><HI>BARONS by Patent are tho&s;e who are cre|ated
by the King, Barons and Lords of Parli|ament.
It is agreed among Authors, that the
fir&s;t In&s;tance of this Kind upon Record is in
the Days of</HI> Richard <HI>II. who in the Year</HI>
1387, <HI>created</HI> Iohn Beauchamp <HI>of</HI> Holt, <HI>Ba|ron
of</HI> Kidermin&s;ter, <HI>and Lord of Parlia|ment.
The Patent is in the following Words,</HI>
Rex, &amp;c. &s;alutem. Sciatis quod pro bono &s;er|vitio
quod dilectus et fidelis Miles no&s;ter Io|annes
de Beauchamp de Holte, Sene&s;callus Ho|&s;pitii

unum Parium et Baronum Regni no&s;tri Angliae
praefecimus, volentes quod idem Ioannes, et
haeredes ma&s;culi de corpore &s;uo exeuntes, &s;ta|tum
Baronis obtineant, ac Domini de Beau|champ,
et Barones de Kidermin&s;ter nuncupen|tur.
In cujus, &amp;c. Dat. 10. Octob. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">
I HAVE given this Patent at large, that
the Nature of the Grant may be the better
under&s;tood; and it merits Attention, becau&s;e,
by creating Earls without Relation to a Coun|ty,
and Barons without Relation to a Barony,
Foundation was laid for a great Change in
the Con&s;titution of Parliament, though the
Con&s;equence was probably not attended to
in the Beginning. The Parliament was ori|ginally
made up of the King's Va&s;&s;als, and
the King had no Power to bring any Per&s;on
into Parliament, who did not hold of him in
chief. By the Multiplication of Earls be|yond
the Number of Counties, which was
begun upon the Fiction of erecting a Ca&s;tle,
or a Mannor into a County, and afterwards
carried on without that Form, the Title of
<HI>Earl</HI> came to be con&s;idered as a per&s;onal Dig|nity;
and now here was another Dignity
invented, by creating a Man a Baron and Lord
of Parliament; which, tho' it was probably
at fir&s;t be&s;towed upon Barons by Tenure,
came afterwards to be be&s;towed upon all Per|&s;ons
indifferently, without Regard to Land.
<PB N="92" REF="93">
An Earl originally was intitled to &s;it in Parlia|ment,
as the King's immediate Va&s;&s;al, and
a Baron upon the &s;ame Footing. But now,
as the King, by gradually diverging from the
original Con&s;titution, has acquired by long
U&s;e, the Privilege of making an Earl with|out
a County, and a Lord of Parliament
without a Barony, it may happen &s;ome time
hereafter, that the Hou&s;e of Peers &s;hall be
filled with Men who have little or no Pro|perty
in Land. It mu&s;t be acknowledged,
that &s;eldom has the Peerage been be&s;towed
but upon Men of opulent Fortunes. But as
the Crown is under no Re&s;traint in this Par|ticular,
we owe it more to the Goodne&s;s of
our Sovereigns, than of our Con&s;titution, that
the Hou&s;e of Peers is compo&s;ed of Members
who, if they are not intirely independent,
have them&s;elves more to blame than their
Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THO' the above Diploma is the olde&s;t that
is upon Record, it follows not, that it is the
fir&s;t of the Kind. The Stile of the Diploma
<PB N="93" REF="94">
rather argues an e&s;tabli&s;hed Practice, as it is
not introduced with any Preamble, importing
a new Dignity. At what Time then, by
whom, and upon what Occa&s;ion was this new
Cla&s;s of Peerage invented, is uncertain. It
may appear hard to be conceived at fir&s;t View,
what could be the Intendment of it. In the
Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II. and for a long Time be|fore,
none but the greater Barons attended the
Parliament, the le&s;&s;er Barons and Freeholders
appearing by their Repre&s;entatives. Now to
what Purpo&s;e could it be, to create a great Ba|ron,
Lord of Parliament, who was intitled alrea|dy
to that Privilege. And if the Honour was
de&s;igned for a le&s;&s;er Baron or Freeholder, it
was &s;ufficient to call him to Parliament by a
&s;pecial Writ. But when the Matter is more
attentively con&s;idered, there will be found
probable Rea&s;ons for introducing of this Dig|nity.
The Commerce of Land, begun &s;ome
Centuries before, was greatly increa&s;ed in the
1387. A Barony by Tenure, which was o|riginally
a permanent Dignity in a Family,
was no longer con&s;idered as &s;uch, after fre|quent
<PB N="94" REF="95">
In&s;tances of the Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e
Dignities from Hand to Hand, in the Way
of Commerce. The Dignity which was con|&s;iderable,
while it was confined to certain Fa|milies,
fell in its Value, after it came to be
expo&s;ed to Sale, with the Barony to which it
was annexed. This made People aim at &s;ome
external Mark of Honour, which &s;hould be
permanent in their Families, as Baronies had
been of old. And this was effectuated, by
creating them and their Heirs Barons, and
Lords of Parliament; for here the Dignity
and Privilege being be&s;towed upon a Family,
and not upon Land as formerly, was inherent
in the Family, and behoved to &s;ub&s;i&s;t as long
as the Family &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. Nor did this Inven|tion
require any great Stretch of Fancy: For,
at this Period, and before, the Notion of per|&s;onal
Honours had gained Ground, by the
frequent Examples of Earls created, with a
very &s;light Relation to Property.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Scotland,</HI> where there has been all a|long
a clo&s;s Imitation of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms,
<PB N="95" REF="96">
the Dignity of Lord of Parliament was early
introduced; at what preci&s;e Period we know
not: We are only certain, that this Dignity
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by many Families, before the
Reign of our <HI>Iames</HI> I. The Act &s;o often
mentioned, exempting the &s;mall Barons and
Freeholders from Attendance in Parliament,
is &s;ufficient Evidence, &s;ince it contains a Re|gulation,
&startq;That Bi&s;hops, Abbots, Priors,
Dukes, Earls, LORDS OF PARLIAMENT
and Banrents, be &s;ummoned to Parliament
by &s;pecial Precept.&endq; Whether Patents were
originally u&s;ed in the Creation of our Lords of
Parliament, is not certain. I incline to think
they were not u&s;ed, becau&s;e I have &s;een no
&s;uch Patent before the Days of <HI>Iames</HI> VI.
Probably there was no other Form u&s;ed but
what is contained in the Records of Parlia|ment,
bearing, that the King, in full Parlia|ment,
created &s;uch a Man, and certain Heirs
mentioned, Lords of Parliament, and ordain|ed
him to be &s;tiled <HI>Lord A. B.</HI> of <HI>C. D.</HI> the
ordinary Form being to annex <HI>Lord</HI> to the
Sirname, with the Addition of the Name
<PB N="96" REF="97">
of the E&s;tate, connected by the Particle <HI>of;</HI>
for Example, Lord <HI>Lind&s;ay</HI> of <HI>Byres,</HI> Lord
<HI>Stewart</HI> of <HI>Ochiltree.</HI> I mu&s;t further ob&s;erve,
that if Lords of Parliament were created a|mong
us without a Patent, the Ceremony
mu&s;t have been performed in Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Barons, by Creation called <HI>Lords of
Parliament,</HI> were di&s;tingui&s;hed in common
Language from the Barons by Tenure, by be|ing
called <HI>Lords,</HI> &s;uch as, Lord <HI>Erskine,</HI> Lord
<HI>Borthwick,</HI> Lord <HI>Seaton,</HI> &amp;c. whereas Barons
by Tenure were called <HI>Lairds;</HI> for Example,
the Laird of <HI>Dundas,</HI> the Laird of <HI>Calder,</HI>
the Laird of <HI>Lu&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. Becau&s;e there is no
<HI>Latin</HI> Word for a Laird, the Barons by
Tenure were called <HI>Domini,</HI> as well as the
Lords of Parliament were. But then to expre&s;s
the Difference, the following Forms were
con&s;tantly ob&s;erved. If a Laird, or Baron
by Tenure, was meant to be expre&s;t, it was
in this Manner, <HI>Dominus de Calder, Dominus
de Balwirie, Dominus de Lu&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. But Lords
of Parliament were expre&s;t by leaving out
<PB N="97" REF="98">
the Article, thus, <HI>Dominus Erskine, Dominus
Seaton, Dominus Borthwick.</HI> For Illu&s;trati|on's
Sake, I have annex'd a Copy of the Roll
of the Parliament 1471, containing, <HI>1mo,</HI> A
Li&s;t of the Bi&s;hops who appeared in that Par|liament;
<HI>2dly,</HI> Of the Abbots; <HI>3dly,</HI> Of the
Earls; <HI>4thly,</HI> Of the Lords of Parliament;
<HI>5thly,</HI> Of the Barons by Tenure; and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI>
Of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Burrows.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that the Lords of Parliament
had no greater Power or Privilege in Parlia|ment
than the Barons by Tenure had; yet
as it was under&s;tood to be the King's Inten|tion,
in creating a Lord of Parliament, to
exalt the Per&s;on honoured to a Rank above
that of a Baron by Tenure, the Nation has
all along &s;ubmitted implicitely to the King's
Will, as mo&s;t Nations do with Regard to
Titles of Honour be&s;towed by the Sovereign.
And there are two Circum&s;tances which pro|bably
have had an Influence to heighten the
Re&s;pect paid in Con&s;equence of &s;uch Creati|ons.
The Attendance of a Baron by Te|nure
<PB N="98" REF="99">
in Parliament, is a Service, and not a
Matter of Right; whereas, when one is cre|ated
Lord of Parliament, the Power of atten|ding
Parliaments is be&s;towed upon him as a
Privilege. The other Circum&s;tance mu&s;t
have had &s;till a greater Weight in the Ima|gination.
The Honour of a Baron by Te|nure
was annex'd to the Land, and went
with it to the Purcha&s;er of the Barony along
with the Juri&s;diction, and its other Acce&s;&s;o|ries.
The frequent Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Baro|nies
from Hand to Hand, with the Honours
annex'd, could not fail to depretiate the Dig|nity,
in the Opinion of all Men. A Man
who, after pa&s;&s;ing many Years in an ob&s;cure
Rank, purcha&s;es an Honour with his Mo|ney,
mu&s;t lay his Account, for &s;ome time,
not to have great Re&s;pect paid him. And
tho' the Re&s;pect paid to an old Family, will
run on a long Time after the Family-E&s;tate
is gone; yet it mu&s;t dwindle by Degrees,
'till the Family at la&s;t be lo&s;t in the common
Herd. It will be obvious, from the&s;e Con|&s;iderations,
that territorial Honour could not
<PB N="99" REF="100">
long &s;tand its Ground after the Commerce of
Land was introduced, and it will be equal|ly
obvious, that this Circum&s;tance behoved
to add a great Lu&s;tre to the Dignity of a
Lord of Parliament, which was annexed to
the Family, and in&s;eparable from it. Ac|cordingly,
after the Lords of Parliament were
multiplied by frequent Creations, the Ba|rons
by Tenure, who made no Figure in
Compari&s;on, tired of the Expence of atten|ding
Parliaments, without any Return ei|ther
of Profit or Honour, withdrew by De|grees.
In latter Times, the Barons by Te|nure,
who attended Parliaments, were mo&s;t|ly
the elde&s;t Sons of the Nobility, infeft in
Lands, to intitle them to a Seat there. And
in Fact, for forty Years before the 1587,
there is not to be found in the Rolls of Par|liament,
a &s;ingle In&s;tance of a Baron by Te|nure
attending the Parliament.</P>
<P>IT was in this Year 1587, that the Statute
of <HI>Iames</HI> I. of <HI>Scotland</HI> was revived, requiring
the le&s;&s;er Barons to &s;end Commi&s;&s;ioners to Par|liament;
<PB N="100" REF="101">
and &s;o little Regard was had to Ba|rons
by Tenure in this Act, that by an ex|pre&s;s
Clau&s;e, &startq;All Freeholders of the King,
under the Degree of Prelates and <HI>Lords
of Parliament,</HI> are to be warned by Pro|clamation
to be pre&s;ent at the chu&s;ing of the&s;e
Commi&s;&s;ioners.&endq; It was this Act then,
which gave the fini&s;hing Blow to Barons by
Tenure, by depriving them of their Seat in
Parliament, and thereby reducing them to
the Rank of &s;mall Barons and Freeholders,
who have no other Privilege, but to &s;end Re|pre&s;entatives
to Parliament: And hence a
<HI>Scotch</HI> Laird has come to be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure
a Term of Reproach, like a <HI>French</HI> Marquis,
or a <HI>German</HI> Baron.</P>
<P>IT remains only to be examined, by what
Means it happened, that the Commerce of
Land, which has quite annihilated the Ho|nour
of a Baron by Tenure, had not the &s;ame
Effect with regard to the Dignity of an Earl.
It is clear from what is above &s;aid, that both
of them were once territorial Dignities, and
<PB N="101" REF="102">
that when the E&s;tate was aliened, the Dig|nity
went along with it. We may readily be|lieve,
that the Dignity of an Earl was pretty
much ob&s;cured, by this Means, as well as
that of a Baron; and we have Tradition to
confirm us in this Opinion. Yet after per&s;o|nal
Honour was introduced, whereby we
came to &s;eparate the Dignity from the E&s;tate,
the Title of Earl was in greater Repute, while
that of Laird, which was the Title of a Ba|ron
by Tenure, dwindled away to nothing.
When this Matter is con&s;idered, a ready So|lution
will occur. The Introduction of that
new Cla&s;s of Nobility, called <HI>the Lords of
Parliament,</HI> which had the Effect to over|&s;hadow
and ob&s;cure the Barons by Tenure,
plainly contributed to exalt the Earls. Place
and Precedency work &s;trongly upon the Ima|gination,
becau&s;e they are public and palpable
Marks of Re&s;pect. The Barons by Tenure,
&s;uch of them who had the greate&s;t E&s;tates, or
were mo&s;t remarkable for the Figure they
made in the Country, were generally called
to be Lords of Parliament; &s;ome of them
<PB N="102" REF="103">
were more highly exalted, being made Earls.
The Body of territorial Barons being thus im|poveri&s;hed,
by the frequent Draughts made
out of it, came to be little re&s;pected. They
by Degrees withdrew from Parliament, as
finding nothing there to an&s;wer the Expence
of Attendance; and they were excluded alto|gether
by the Act 1587, which in the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances
could not, at any Rate, be rec|koned
a Hard&s;hip, and po&s;&s;ibly was carried
through with their Con&s;ent or Good-liking.
The Removal of the Barons by Tenure from
the Parliament, behoved to add a Lu&s;tre to
the Lords of Parliament, and &s;till a greater
Lu&s;tre to the Earls, who took Place of them.
And as by this Time, an Earldom was con|&s;idered
as a Family Dignity, as well as was
a Baronage by Creation, the Earls could not
fail to pre&s;erve their &s;uperior Rank in the
Minds of the People, as well as they did in
the Rolls of Parliameut.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SUCCESSION, or the Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of E|&s;tates
from the Dead to the Living, is a
Subject which makes a great Figure in Hi&s;to|ry,
as well as in Law. It is a Subject full of
Curio&s;ity; for, depending mo&s;tly upon re|mote
Principles of the Imagination, it &s;hows,
in a Multitude of In&s;tances, how much we
are governed by Feelings, which, ab&s;tractly
con&s;idered, appear to be of the weake&s;t Sort.
One Effect of this indeed is, that there is no
&s;uch Thing as univer&s;al Rules of Succe&s;&s;ion.
Different Maxims are not only embraced in
different Countries, but have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in
the &s;ame Country at different Periods: So that
Succe&s;&s;ion, like the Fa&s;hion, has hitherto been
in a con&s;tant Fluctuation. We are apt to think,
that the Rules are now ultimately &s;ettled with|out
Fear of Change. But &s;o, in all Probabili|ty,
did our Fore-fathers, three of four Centuries
<PB N="124" REF="125">
ago; for 'tis a common Mi&s;take, from any
&s;hort Specimen, to infer a con&s;tant Unifor|mity.
However this be, 'tis of great U&s;e to
trace the Rules of Succe&s;&s;ion through their
different Changes. A Lawyer po&s;&s;ibly may
think his Stock of Knowledge &s;ufficient, if
he can point out the Rules which obtain at
pre&s;ent in his own Country. But a Man who
knows no more of the Matter, cannot form
any clear Judgment about many old Tran&s;|actions
of the greate&s;t Importance. In the
Hi&s;tory of <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and indeed of mo&s;t <HI>European</HI> Nations, we
meet with frequent Di&s;putes about the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
of Kingdoms, and of other Sovereign|ties,
which we are altogther at a Lo&s;s to
comprehend, becau&s;e &s;uch Di&s;putes cannot
exi&s;t at this Day. Who imagines that a &s;e|cond
Son or Daughter can have any Preten&s;i|ons
to a Crown, &s;o long as there are I&s;&s;ue ex|i&s;ting
of the elde&s;t: Yet this very Thing was
made a Que&s;tion of in the famous Trial about
the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> betwixt <HI>Bruce</HI> and
<HI>Baliol.</HI> We are apt to imagine, that a &s;e|cond
<PB N="125" REF="126">
Son, who puts in &s;o idle a Claim, has
other Arguments to &s;upport him&s;elf with,
than what are founded in the Laws of his
Country: not con&s;idering that the Right of
Repre&s;entation, tho' now generally e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,
was but creeping into Practice in tho&s;e
Days. In former Ages the Right of Repre|&s;entation
was not &s;o much as dreamed of;
Witne&s;s <HI>Lewis,</HI> the &s;econd Son of <HI>Charlemain,</HI>
called to the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown of
<HI>France,</HI> when there was an elder Brother's
Son exi&s;ting. In&s;tances of this Nature, and
there are Multitudes of them, make it evi|dent,
how nece&s;&s;ary a Qualification it is in a
Hi&s;torian to be acquainted with the Laws
and Antiquities of the Country he writes of.
Is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, that Father <HI>Daniel,</HI> in his
Hi&s;tory of <HI>France,</HI> gives the above Account of
the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Charlemain,</HI> without making
the lea&s;t Reflection upon it, as if it were an
ordinary Event, which needed no Comment?
So dry an Hi&s;torian cannot fail to perplex
his Readers. Perhaps the Father was him&s;elf
perplexed, and cho&s;e to hide his Ignorance by
<PB N="126" REF="127">
his Silence. <HI>Rapin</HI> is a mo&s;t judicious Hi|&s;torian,
but he is frequently at a Lo&s;s, thro'
want of a &s;ufficient Knowledge of the Con|&s;titution
of <HI>England.</HI> His Book contains
many In&s;tances of di&s;puted Succe&s;&s;ions, where
the Facts are &s;tated with great Accuracy.
But an intelligent Reader will perceive, that
he is almo&s;t always at a Lo&s;s when he endea|vours
to &s;et forth the Merits of the Cau&s;e,
which mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e with an Author
who is not intimately acquainted with the
Notions of Succe&s;&s;ion entertained in the Age,
and in the Country he writes of. The fol|lowing
Account of the Matter is therefore
given with a View to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es of
Hi&s;tory as well as of Law.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER Property was introduced, and had
gained a firm E&s;tabli&s;hment, the Mat|ter
of Succe&s;&s;ion could not be long neglect|ed.
The Death of the very fir&s;t Man who
acquired Property, mu&s;t have given Occa&s;ion
to the Que&s;tion, who was to &s;ucceed him?
If his Will was declared upon the Point, no
Doubt could be that it was the Rule<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Author is aware, that while Property was in its Infancy, it was doubted whether a Man's Will, in whatever Manner declared, could have the Effect to regulate his Succe&s;|&s;ion. But when the Thing is attended to, it will be &s;ound to re&s;olve into a Di&s;pute about the Nature of Property. Occu|pation is allowed to have been the fir&s;t Foundation of Property in Land. When a Piece of Ground was taken out of the Com|mon, and cultivated by the Occupier for the U&s;e of him&s;elf and Family, it &s;oon came to be &s;ettled, that this Per&s;on was to have the undi&s;turbed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for his Life; otherways farewell to Labour and Indu&s;try. But as his Intere&s;t in the Subject behoved to die with him&s;elf, it was not readily conceived how his Power over the Subject &s;hould continue after his Intere&s;t was at an End, or at any Rate &s;ub&s;i&s;t after he was dead and gone. But this Dif|ficulty was plainly owing to the limited Notion of Property, which was entertained after its fir&s;t Introduction. In early Times Property was not much di&s;tingui&s;hed from what is now called <HI>u&s;ufruct.</HI> No more was conceived in Property, but the unlimited U&s;e of the Subject. But Experience poin|ted out a more exten&s;ive Idea of Property. Mankind are fond of Power, e&s;pecially over what is their own; and it came to be con&s;idered as an unrea&s;onable Hard&s;hip, after Indu&s;try be|&s;towed in acquiring and improving a Field, that the Occupier &s;hould not have it in his Power to di&s;po&s;e of it at his Plea&s;ure. The Power of Di&s;po&s;al was reli&s;hed, and became Law, becau&s;e it was every one's Intere&s;t that it &s;hould be Law. And when once this Power was under&s;tood, it came by Degrees to be ex|tended the utmo&s;t Length it was capable of, Thus <HI>Grotius, Lib. 2. Cap. 6. Sect. 14. Po&s;&s;um enim rem meam alienare non pure modo &s;ed et &s;ub conditione: nec tantum irrevocabiliter, &s;ed et revocabiliter, atque etiam retenta interim po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ione et pleni&s;|&s;imo fruendi jure. Alienatio autem in mortis eventum, ante e|am revocabilis, retento interim jure po&s;&s;idendi ac fruendi, e&s;t te&s;tamentum.</HI> Therefore, when we read of ancient Laws among particular Nations, introducing the Power of making a Te&s;ta|ment, we mu&s;t not con&s;ider the&s;e Laws as be&s;towing peculiar Privileges, but only as authori&s;ing a Practice which was the Con&s;equence of an enlarged Idea of Property.</NOTE>. If
<PB N="128" REF="129">
the E&s;tate was left <HI>in medio,</HI> without a Will to
direct the Succe&s;&s;ion, his Children for whom
he was bound to provide, would natural|ly
be &s;ugge&s;ted to the Mind. This pointed
out the primary Rule of Succe&s;&s;ion, that Chil|dren
&s;ucceed <HI>ab inte&s;tato.</HI> But what if there
are no Children? 'Tis but following out the
&s;ame Rule, to pitch upon the neare&s;t Relati|on.
For after a Man's Death, his Children
<PB N="129" REF="130">
or other Relations, will be con&s;idered as ha|ving
a clo&s;er Connection with his Effects than
Strangers; and, by a natural Tran&s;ition of I|deas,
the Property, that was in the Decea&s;ed,
will be readily transferred to his Kindred.</P>
<P>CHILDREN, as having the clo&s;e&s;t Connec|tion,
come to be con&s;idered in the fir&s;t Place,
and here a &s;ubtile Que&s;tion occurs, Whe|ther,
by the Law of Nature, Daughters are
intitled to &s;ucceed equally with Sons? One
Thing is clear, that wherever the Notions of
a Family have got firm Footing, Female Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
mu&s;t be excluded, &s;ince a Woman
by Marriage making a Part of her Husband's
Family, cannot readily carry on the Idea of
that of her Father. But the Notions of a
Family are the Con&s;equence of Male Succe&s;|&s;ion,
and are not &s;ugge&s;ted by any natural
Principle. If we lay a&s;ide the Notions of a Fa|mily,
Propinquity mu&s;t al&s;o be laid a&s;ide, which
throws an equal Weight into either Scale.
What readily occurs after this, to determine
the Que&s;tion, is, that Women &s;tand in Need
<PB N="130" REF="131">
of Food and Raiment as well as Men do, and
are equally capable of enjoying Riches. It is
true, that the Male has among all Nations, and
at all Times, been e&s;teemed the <HI>dignior per|&s;ona.</HI>
But this Con&s;ideration can never be
of Weight to thru&s;t out Females altogether,
and once admitting them into a Share, they
mu&s;t have an equal Share, as there are no
po&s;&s;ible <HI>Data</HI> in this Ca&s;e to fix any other
Proportion.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find this Rule ob&s;er|ved
among all Nations, with regard to Succe&s;|&s;ion
in Moveables. In mo&s;t Countries Females
have been excluded from &s;ucceeding to Lands.
But this was the Effect of di&s;tingi&s;hing Man|kind
into Tribes and Families, which, tho' not
original in Nature, crept pretty early in. It
was evidently &s;o among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and among
the <HI>Romans,</HI> where the Di&s;tinction betwixt
Tribes and Families was &s;o remarkably pre|&s;erved,
that by Law a Per&s;on of one Tribe
could not &s;ucceed to one of another. And
in other Countries where the&s;e Di&s;tinctions
<PB N="131" REF="132">
were not &s;o much attended to, War in early
Times being the principal Occupation, and
Land the principal Object of Conque&s;t, it
was natural that Males only &s;hould have the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Land, which they only could
defend. But even in this Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be
ob&s;erved, that the whole Sons &s;ucceeded e|qually,
which was departing as little from the
Law of Nature, as the Circum&s;tances of the
Ca&s;e would allow.</P>
<P>THE Right of Primogeniture was a Crea|ture
of the Feudal Law. The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not
the Property of Land, was given for per&s;onal
Service; and when it came to be the Practice
to extend &s;uch Grants in favours of Children,
the Ma&s;ter or Superior having no Claim but
to one Man's Service, the elde&s;t Son came
readily into the Father's Place. For as in
tracing out a Family, the Mind de&s;cends by
Degrees from the Father, fir&s;t to the elde&s;t
Son, and &s;o downwards in the Order of Age;
the elde&s;t Son, where but one can take, is
the fir&s;t who pre&s;ents him&s;elf. And as the
<PB N="132" REF="133">
Feudal Law gained Ground, and &s;pread it&s;elf
over all <HI>Europe,</HI> the Right of Primogeniture
came by Degrees to be a general Rule in the
Succe&s;&s;ion to Land E&s;tates, which were held
by military Service.</P>
<P>AS this was evidently the Rea&s;on for pre|ferring
the elde&s;t Son in a military Feu, the
&s;ame Rea&s;on, in my Apprehen&s;ion, behoved
to take Place in Burgage Lands, which being
given for the Service of Watching and Ward|ing,
if one only was bound to perform the
Service, the elde&s;t Son was the Per&s;on. But
Soccage Tenure &s;tood upon a different Foot|ing.
Where the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lands is given
to a Man, not for per&s;onal Service, but upon
Condition of delivering to the Ma&s;ter yearly
a certain Quantity of Corn, or of other Fruits,
which are the Produce of the Ground, there
appears no good Rea&s;on why the Benefit of
&s;uch a Contract, if there is any Benefit from
it, &s;hould not accre&s;ce to all the Family e|qually.
And yet, &s;o far as we can di&s;cover,
Sons were always preferred to Daughters in
<PB N="133" REF="134">
the Succe&s;&s;ion of Soccage Lands. All I have
to &s;ugge&s;t is, That in Times of Ignorance and
Barbarity, when Strength of Body and per|&s;onal
Courage are the only Virtues, Women
are little regarded. And the Practice of de|barring
them altogether from Succe&s;&s;ion to
military Feus, which made the Bulk of the
Property of the Nation, did probably pave
the Way for preferring the Males to the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
of other E&s;tates. This Conjecture ap|pears
natural enough; but it is more difficult
to be explained, by what Means it has hap|pened,
that the equal Succe&s;&s;ion of Males in
the Soccage Tenure has gone quite into De|&s;uetude,
and given Place to the Right of Pri|mogeniture.
This Revolution is not taken
Notice of by our Hi&s;torians, nor accounted
for by our Lawyers. One Thing is certain,
that Equality among Males, in the De&s;cent of
Soccage Lands, was in Vigour &s;o late as the
<HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem.</HI> See <HI>R. M. L. 2. C.</HI> 27.
We mu&s;t venture another Conjecture here.
After the Days of <HI>David</HI> II. during who&s;e
Reign the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> was compo&s;ed,
<PB N="134" REF="135">
peaceable Times brought on new Manners.
Riches came to be in greater Reque&s;t than
military Prowe&s;s, and many Superiors were
willing to take Rent in Place of Service. This,
in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, confounded the Di&s;tinction
betwixt Military and Soccage Tenures, &s;o as
by Degrees to make one Rule &s;erve for the
Succe&s;&s;ion in both. And as Military Feus
were by far the mo&s;t frequent, the Right of
Primogeniture, which took Place in mo&s;t
Ca&s;es, became at la&s;t univer&s;al.</P>
<P>BUT we are not yet at an End with the
Difficulties which ari&s;e from this Branch of
our Subject. Tho' the Succe&s;&s;ion to Soccage
Lands came after this Manner to be confined
to the elde&s;t Son; yet no Alteration was made
in the Female Succe&s;&s;ion; Females continued
to &s;ucceed all equally, and do &s;o at this Day.
This at fir&s;t Sight mu&s;t appear whim&s;ical, and
not readily to be accounted for. If the Right
of Primogeniture was &s;o univer&s;al a Principle,
how came it to &s;top &s;hort, and not to obtain
in every Ca&s;e? And 'tis evident, where there
<PB N="135" REF="136">
are Daughters only, that the Mind, in tracing
out the Line, de&s;cends to the elde&s;t, as natu|rally
as to the elde&s;t Son, where there are
Male I&s;&s;ue. Among the many Grounds of
fal&s;e Rea&s;oning, there is not one more com|mon,
than from &s;ome &s;light or accidental Re|lation
to form an Analogy betwixt two Things
that are very different in other Re&s;pects. The
bad Effect of which is, that the Mind, intent
to compleat the Analogy, has a Tendency to
equiparate them in every Circum&s;tance. 'Tis
probable, that the Soccage Tenure was not
far behind the Military Tenure in Point of
Time; and if &s;o, the Rules of its Succe&s;&s;ion
were &s;ettled before the Right of Primogeni|ture
came to take &s;uch fa&s;t hold of the Mind,
as to be reckoned a Sort of natural Principle.
Accordingly we find, that tho' Males were
preferred, yet in other Re&s;pects the Law of
Nature took Place, by calling the Males all
equally; and failing them, the Females. But
this Circum&s;tance we mu&s;t attend to, that
tho', in Progre&s;s of Time the Right of Primo|geniture
came to be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a general
<PB N="136" REF="137">
Law, and in &s;ome Sort as a natural Principle;
yet there was no Example of this Right tak|ing
Place, except among Males. It was this
very Con&s;ideration, in all Appearance, which
led our Forefathers, in their &s;uperficial Rea|&s;onings,
to lean to the Right of Primogeni|ture
in all Ca&s;es of Male Succe&s;&s;ion, without
thinking of encroaching upon the e&s;tabli&s;hed
Rules of Female Succe&s;&s;ion. Not at all at|tentive
to what is fundamental in this Matter,
in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, that the Right of Primoge|niture
depended upon the Nature of the Mi|litary
Holding, which therefore could not
with any Shew of Rea&s;on be extended to Hold|ings
of a different Kind; And, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI>
Place, That if the Privilege of Primogeniture
was to be the &s;ole Rule, it ought to have Place
in the Succe&s;&s;ion of Females, as well as of
Males.</P>
<P>AFTER the Feudal Law came to a Stan|dard,
the Succe&s;&s;ion in Military Feus was re|gularly
extended to the Male De&s;cendents of
the original Va&s;&s;al, and after the&s;e were all
<PB N="137" REF="138">
exhau&s;ted, the Fee returned to the Superior.
There was no Place for collateral Succe&s;&s;ion.
It might happen, that Collaterals to the de|cea&s;ed
Va&s;&s;al did &s;ucceed, but it was not <HI>qua</HI>
Collaterals, but <HI>qua</HI> Heirs-male of the Body
of the original Va&s;&s;al. See <HI>L. feud. T.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>IN handling a Subject, where we have &s;o
few Principles to direct us, and where the&s;e
Principles are not of the firme&s;t Sort, 'tis no
Wonder that Difficulties crowd in on every
Side. So far we have proceeded upon a rea|&s;onable
Foundation, that in the Succe&s;&s;ion of
Military Feus, Preference is given to the el|de&s;t
Son. But now the Que&s;tion is, Whe|ther
this Privilege is to be extended to his
Male I&s;&s;ue? A Military Va&s;&s;al dies leaving
I&s;&s;ue a younger Son, and a Grand&s;on by his
elde&s;t Son, the Doubt is, Whether the Son
or Grand&s;on is Heir: The Son is undoubted|ly
the neare&s;t in Blood, and therefore, by the
Law of Nature, ought to be preferred; and
accordingly this appears to have been the Law
in the Days of <HI>Charlemain,</HI> who&s;e &s;econd Son
<PB N="138" REF="139">
<HI>Lewis</HI> was called to the Succe&s;&s;ion as lawful
Heir, tho' <HI>Charlemain</HI> had by his elde&s;t Son
a Grand&s;on of perfect Age, when the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
opened. On the other hand, the Cir|cum&s;tances
of the Grand&s;on are to be con&s;i|&s;idered.
He is born, and perhaps educated,
with the Pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding to the E&s;tate,
after the Death fir&s;t of his Grandfather, and
then of his Father. It cannot but be con&s;i|dered
as a Hard&s;hip to be deprived at once of
all his Hopes, by the unexpected Accident of
his Father's Death before that of his Grand|father.
Such are the Circum&s;tances which
weigh again&s;t one another; and therefore no
Wonder to find the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Writers ta|king
different Sides in a Que&s;tion &s;o dubious.
Perhaps there is not one Que&s;tion in Law,
which has afforded a greater Field, not only
for Law-&s;uits, but for bloody and cruel Wars.
The Hi&s;torians of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> are full
of In&s;tances of this Kind. And the celebrated
Struggle about the Crown of <HI>Scotland,</HI> be|twixt
<HI>Bruce</HI> and <HI>Baliol,</HI> had no other Foun|dation.
<HI>Baliol</HI> was de&s;cended of the elde&s;t
<PB N="139" REF="140">
Si&s;ter, <HI>Bruce</HI> only of the &s;econd. But then
it was urged in Behalf of the latter, that he
was one Degree nearer to the common Stock
than his Competitor, and con&s;equently nearer
in Blood. This Matter is now &s;ettled, and
has been for Ages in favours of the De&s;cen|dents
of the elde&s;t. But it was in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure
reckoned a doubtful Ca&s;e, even &s;o late
as the Time when the <HI>Regiam Maje&s;tatem</HI> was
compo&s;ed, as will appear from the 33 Chap|ter
of the &s;econd Book.</P>
<P>IT has been di&s;puted, whether the &s;ame
Rule ought to hold in the Succe&s;&s;ion of Col|laterals.
The Ground of the Doubt is, That
as a Man is never without Hopes of I&s;&s;ue,
none of his Collaterals can be born or educa|ted
with the Hopes of &s;ucceeding to him.
This Circum&s;tance being removed, which
preponderates in the former Ca&s;e, it may be
thought, that there is nothing to weigh a|gain&s;t
the Right of the neare&s;t Agnat. Up|on
this Ground it was, that after the Death
of <HI>Henry</HI> III. of <HI>France,</HI> the League &s;et up
<PB N="140" REF="141">
up the Cardinal of <HI>Bourbon</HI> as Heir of the
Crown, again&s;t his Nephew the King of <HI>Na|varre,</HI>
afterwards <HI>Henry</HI> IV. For tho' <HI>Hen|ry</HI>
was the Son of the elder Brother, yet the
Cardinal the younger Brother was one Step
nearer to the common Stock. It is extreme
probable, had Ca&s;es of this Nature fir&s;t oc|curred,
that the neare&s;t Agnat would have
been preferred; and it is equally probable,
had this once been e&s;tabli&s;hed as the Rule,
tho' occurring only in collateral Succe&s;&s;ion,
that it would have been applied to the Ca&s;e
of De&s;cendents, without Regard to their Hope
of Succe&s;&s;ion. But In&s;tances fir&s;t occurring,
as readily would happen in the Ca&s;e of De|&s;cendents,
the Deci&s;ions given in favours of
the elde&s;t Son's De&s;cendents, e&s;tabli&s;hed a
Sort of general Rule, which was afterwards
applied to the Ca&s;e of Collaterals.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee after what Manner the Rules
of Succe&s;&s;ion have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, not only
from very &s;lender Circum&s;tances, but in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure from Accident. Had the above
<PB N="141" REF="142">
Que&s;tion fir&s;t occurred in collateral Succe&s;&s;i|on,
probably we &s;hould never have heard of
this Privilege given to De&s;cendents, which
Lawyers call the Right of Repre&s;entation.
But as this Privilege has been fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed
in favours of De&s;cendents, it has been con&s;i|dered
as a general Rule, and applied to the
Ca&s;e of Collaterals, tho' without the &s;ame
Foundation. But this will not be thought
&s;trange, when it is con&s;idered, how &s;trong a
Propen&s;ity there is in our Nature to act by ge|neral
Rules, without regard to the Variation
of Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>AND here we are furni&s;hed with an Op|portunity
to con&s;ider a peculiar Sort of Argu|ment,
the great Re&s;ource of Lawyers, when
they are pre&s;&s;ed with Difficulties upon any
Subject. Ca&s;es often happen where a gene|ral
Rule will not apply, and where it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to make a particular Rule to govern
&s;uch Ca&s;es. But as Mankind are addicted
to general Rules, and as the Indolence of
Lawyers makes it a Task too hard for them
<PB N="142" REF="143">
to trace out all the Rules which govern par|ticular
Ca&s;es, they have invented an ea&s;y Me|thod
to bring all the Exceptions under the ge|neral
Rule; which is by &s;uppo&s;ing the Fact to
have happened otherways than it did. And
this they ju&s;tly term a <HI>fictio juris.</HI> Thus for
Example, in the <HI>Roman</HI> Law, a Citizen who
was taken Captive by the Enemy, lo&s;t the
<HI>jus civitatis,</HI> and all the Privileges attending
it. This was a general Rule e&s;tabli&s;hed a|mong
them. But &s;uppo&s;ing the Captive to
have made his E&s;cape, or to have recovered
his Liberty by &s;ome other lucky Accident, it
would have been an Hard&s;hip intollerable,
that this Man without a Fault &s;hould be for|feited
of all his Rights and Privileges. The
Rule, 'tis evident, could not be extended to
this Ca&s;e. But what was to be done; for
Lawyers were loath to quit with the general
Rule? In&s;tead of making a Rule for Ca&s;es of
this Nature, they extricated them&s;elves out
of the Difficulty, by &s;uppo&s;ing for&s;ooth, that
this Man had never been out of the City; and
this is called the <HI>jus po&s;tliminii.</HI> The <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="144">
Law is full of &s;uch Fictions, and the Mo|derns
their humble Imitators, have followed
them but too clo&s;s. Thus, upon the Sub|ject
under Con&s;ideration, it is ju&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
as a general Rule, that the next in Blood
&s;ucceeds. The Privilege which is given to
the De&s;cendents of the next in Blood, who
dies before the Succe&s;&s;ion opens to him, is
obviou&s;ly an Exception from this general Rule.
But to &s;upply this Defect in the Rule, the De|&s;cendent
is &s;uppo&s;ed by a Fiction of Law, to
come in Place of the Decea&s;ed, to be as it
were the &s;ame Per&s;on with him, and intitled
to claim the Succe&s;&s;ion, as he could have done
had he been alive. Let us hear our Country|man
<HI>Craig</HI> upon this Fiction. <HI>Jus reprae&s;enta|tionis
e&s;t, quoties po&s;terior non ex &s;ua, &s;ed ex
prioris per&s;ona, quam reprae&s;entat, jus &s;ucce&s;&s;i|onis
petit, veluti praemortuo filio cum nepos
aut neptis ad &s;ucce&s;&s;ionem vocantur; non enim
ratione &s;ui, &s;ed patris eorum, i. e. filii defun|cti,
Succe&s;&s;io ad eos pertinet, neque hi ex &s;ua
per&s;ona haereditatem aut ejus partem po&s;&s;unt
petere, &s;ed tantum ex per&s;ona patris (nam ex
<PB N="144" REF="145">
&s;ua non admitterentur, cum filii ex eodem pa|rente
&s;uper&s;int, qui horum &s;unt patrui, et
&s;ic agnati propiores defuncti;) et hoc e&s;t ejus
per&s;onam repre&s;entare.</HI> This, as has been ob|&s;erved,
is a very commodious Method of &s;ol|ving
Difficulties. But however commodious,
I will venture to &s;ay, it affords little Satisfac|tion
to the Mind. For the Que&s;tion &s;till re|curs,
Where is the Foundation for this Ficti|on?
Why &s;hould there be a Right of Re|pre&s;entation
in Lands more than in Movables?
To &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, it &s;eems, in my Ap|prehen&s;ion,
to &s;ignify nothing but to darken
in&s;tead of clearing the Subject Matter. Is it
not more natural, and almo&s;t as ea&s;y to &s;et
forth in plain Terms the Hard&s;hip it would
be upon the elde&s;t Son's De&s;cendents, to be
cut out of their Hopes of Succe&s;&s;ion by the
premature Death of their Father; and that
this Con&s;ideration in &s;uch Ca&s;es prevails over
the Right of Propinquity.</P>
<P>IT remains only to be ob&s;erved upon this
Head, that, pur&s;uant to the above Plan of
<PB N="145" REF="146">
Succe&s;&s;ion, three general Rules behoved to be
e&s;tabli&s;hed with regard to military Feus.
<HI>1mo,</HI> That the elde&s;t Male is the Favourite
of the Law, and preferred to the Succe&s;&s;ion.
<HI>2do,</HI> That the E&s;tate gradually de&s;cends from
the elder Brother failing I&s;&s;ue, to the younger
Brothers. And <HI>3tio,</HI> That it de&s;cends to e|very
one of the Male I&s;&s;ue of the elder Bro|ther,
before it comes, to the younger Brother
or his I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>THO' &s;uch was the common Cour&s;e of
Succe&s;&s;ion in military Feus, which in Time
came to be looked on as Part of the common
Law of the Land, we need not doubt that
it was often broke in upon by &s;pecial Ap|pointment.
In &s;trict Law the Va&s;&s;al's Right
is but an <HI>U&s;ufruct,</HI> and it was late before
he was con&s;idered as Proprietor. The Supe|rior
therefore behoved to have a great Sway
in chu&s;ing an Heir for his Va&s;&s;al; e&s;pecial|ly
in early Times, before Feus were regular|ly
extended to Heirs. That Son, without
Regard to Seniority, who had &s;hown him&s;elf
<PB N="146" REF="147">
mo&s;t active in War, would often be prefer|red.
And even in after Times, when Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
in Feus was more firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed,
Examples could not be wanting of &s;etting
a&s;ide the elde&s;t Son, becau&s;e of Defects in Bo|dy
or Mind; or perhaps becau&s;e he was inten|ded
for the Church, or addicted to the Arts of
Peace. This gave a Beginning to Entails, by
altering the Order of Succe&s;&s;ion, and prefer|ring
a younger Son and his Male De&s;cendents
to the elder Sons and their De&s;cendents.</P>
<P>BUT, now &s;uppo&s;ing that a younger Son,
thus pitched upon to &s;erve the Superior in
Place of his Father, dies without Male I&s;&s;ue,
the Que&s;tion is, who is his Heir in the Feu, his
elder Brother or his younger. Perhaps there
will not be found in Law a Speculation more
curious than what this Doubt gives Ri&s;e to.
Let us examine attentively what Things oc|cur
upon this Subject. As 'tis probable from
the Circum&s;tance of the Times, that Ex|amples
of &s;uch Entails were frequent, even
in the Infancy of the feudal Law, we cannot
<PB N="147" REF="148">
well &s;uppo&s;e, that the Rules above laid down,
touching the Succe&s;&s;ion to military Feus, were
very firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, when there was fir&s;t
Occa&s;ion to determine the Point under Con|&s;ideration.
But &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e Rules to be
firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, it mu&s;t have been obvious,
at fir&s;t View, that they did not apply to this
Ca&s;e. The Right of Primogeniture and the
gradual De&s;cent, relate only to the Father's
Succe&s;&s;ion, and go no further than to a&s;cer|tain,
that where a Man dies <HI>inte&s;tate,</HI> his
E&s;tate goes fir&s;t to the elde&s;t Son and his I&s;|&s;ue;
whom failing, to the &s;econd Son and his
I&s;&s;ue, and &s;o downwards. But there is no|thing
in this Regulation, where a Man dies
without I&s;&s;ue, to determine who &s;hall be
his Heir, his elder or younger Brother. The&s;e
Rules therefore mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide, as of no
U&s;e to &s;upport the elder Brother's Claim.
On the other Hand, the Will of the Supe|rior
or Father, in excluding the elde&s;t Son,
does not militate in Favours of the younger,
&s;ince it goes no further than to prefer the &s;e|cond
Son to the elde&s;t, by no Means to pre|fer
<PB N="148" REF="149">
the third Son. And at any Rate laying
a&s;ide the elde&s;t Son, becau&s;e of his Unwilling|ne&s;s
or Incapacity, an Exclu&s;ion which is
founded merely on per&s;onal Con&s;iderations,
cannot be extended again&s;t his Male I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>THESE Points being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, one Thing
occurs in Favour of the elder Brother. In
order to a&s;certain the Propinquity, it is na|tural
to ca&s;t about for the Principle which
connects the Brothers together, and this is
their Father. When we have carried our
Thoughts to him, we naturally de&s;cend to
the elde&s;t Son, as the fir&s;t Step in the Pro|gre&s;s
of the Mind through the Family. And
thus, as the elde&s;t Son comes next in View,
after the connecting Principle, it will not be
&s;trange, in an overly View of the Matter, to
prefer him as a Step or Degree nearer to the
common Stock than his Competitor is. I
&s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;how hereafter, that
this Way of thinking has had its Effect in a|nother
Ca&s;e of Succe&s;&s;ion. But, as here, Cu|&s;tom
has given the Preference to the younger
<PB N="149" REF="150">
Brother, there mu&s;t be &s;ome other Principle
in our Nature, or &s;ome Peculiarity in our
Way of thinking, &s;ufficient to over-balance
that now &s;ugge&s;ted. For Things e&s;tabli&s;hed
merely by Cu&s;tom, without the Influence of
external Circum&s;tances, mu&s;t certainly have
a Foundation in Nature.</P>
<P>IN &s;earching about for this Principle, let
us premi&s;e one Reflection. It will not be
thought &s;trange, that the Rules of Succe&s;&s;ion,
which depend upon the natural Connections
betwixt Per&s;ons, are, like the&s;e Connections,
founded upon remote Principles; Principles
which, at fir&s;t Sight, may appear of little
Weight, which are little attended to, and
which, notwith&s;tanding, have their Effect by
influencing the Mind. And now to our Sub|ject;
in order to explain which, we mu&s;t
take a pretty large Compa&s;s, being to treat
of Things which are not commonly reflect|ed
on. In tracing out the Actions of our
Mind, the following Ob&s;ervations will be
found ju&s;t. <HI>1mo,</HI> In the Conception of Ob|jects,
<PB N="150" REF="151">
which are real and exi&s;tent, we take
them in their proper Order and Situation,
and never leap from one to another which
is di&s;tant, without running over, at lea&s;t, in
a cur&s;ory Manner, all the interpo&s;ed Objects.
Whether this be a natural Principle, or the
Effect of Habit, does not belong to the pre|&s;ent
Subject. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the
progre&s;&s;ive Motion, through the Points of
Space, of all moving Bodies, is &s;ufficient to
bring on a Habit, and to accu&s;tom the Mind
to the like progre&s;&s;ive Motion in &s;urveying
its Ideas. <HI>2do,</HI> After the &s;ame Manner we
always follow the Succe&s;&s;ion of Time in pla|cing
our Ideas, and cannot ea&s;ily be brought
to contemplate an Object di&s;tant in Point of
Time, without running over the intermediate
Objects. <HI>3tio,</HI> As the Tendency of all Bo|dies
is to move in a &s;treight Line, and in
one Direction; as Nature is going on in its
Cour&s;e without any retrograde Motion, this
Tenor of Things about us, communicates to
our Minds the like Tendency: However
this be, it is certain, that we more readily
<PB N="151" REF="152">
pa&s;s to the Contemplation of a future Object,
than of one that is pa&s;t. The Progre&s;&s;ion
of the Thought, in going from a pre&s;ent to
a pa&s;t Object, has a di&s;agreeable Feeling, as
if we were walking backward. But when
we turn our Thought to a future Object,
our Fancy flows along the Stream of Time,
and arrives at the Object, by an Order which
&s;eems mo&s;t natural, pa&s;&s;ing always from one
Point of Time to that which immediately
follows it. <HI>4to,</HI> The Tendency of Bodies
downwards, continually operating upon the
Sen&s;es, mu&s;t produce from Cu&s;tom a like
Tendency in the Fancy. Upon this Account
the Mind finds a Difficulty in mounting from
inferior to &s;uperior Objects, as if Ideas ac|quired
a Kind of Gravity from their Objects.
<HI>5to,</HI> The Progre&s;s of Thought to Objects
pa&s;t and future, having &s;imilar Feelings with
the Progre&s;s to Objects &s;ituated above and
below us, the&s;e Feelings are commonly ta|ken
for the &s;ame. Hence we imagine our
Ance&s;tors to be in a Manner mounted above
us, and our Po&s;terity to be below us.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="153">
THESE Ob&s;ervations will give Light to
our Subject. Let us recollect, that it is the
E&s;tate of a middle Brother which is in Di&s;|pute.
If we turn our Thoughts to the elder
Brother, the Mind feels &s;ome &s;ort of Pain,
as if it were a&s;cending. It is a &s;ort of retro|grade
Motion, contrary to the Cour&s;e of Na|ture.
On the other hand, pa&s;&s;ing to the
younger Brother is going with the Current, it
carries with it the Facility of de&s;cending.
The&s;e Things weigh in favours of the younger
Brother. The Tran&s;ition of the Thought to
the younger being more ea&s;y than the Tran|&s;ition
to the elder, gives an Impre&s;&s;ion of a
clo&s;er Connection or Relation betwixt the &s;e|cond
and third Brother, than betwixt the &s;e|cond
and elde&s;t. For 'tis a Law in our Na|ture,
that the Connection among Objects is
ever con&s;idered to be in Proportion to the Fa|cility
of the Tran&s;ition of our Ideas from the
one to the other.</P>
<P>IT will perhaps be ob&s;erved, That Prin|ciples
like what I have been tracing out, which
<PB N="153" REF="154">
at be&s;t, make but a &s;lender Impre&s;&s;ion, are
little to be relied on, in our Rea&s;onings upon
any Subject. I readily yield, that in re&s;olving
the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion, no Man would he&s;itate
a Moment to divide the middle Brother's E|&s;tate
betwixt the elder and younger, as the
equal Method. But what forces us, perhaps
reluctantly, into an ab&s;tract Speculation, is the
Nature of a Military Feu, which does not ad|mit
of a divided Succe&s;&s;ion. When we are
&s;o hemmed in, we mu&s;t extricate our&s;elves
the be&s;t Way we can. A Deci&s;ion mu&s;t be
given, for the Competitors are calling out to
have Ju&s;tice done them. And however &s;light
this Principle may appear, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve,
that it has had Weight enough among our
Forefathers to preponderate the Con&s;ideration
above &s;ugge&s;ted, which weighs for the elder
Brother. At lea&s;t, I will take it for granted,
that this is the Principle, till I hear of ano|ther
capable to make a &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
AND thus a fourth Rule came to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in the Succe&s;&s;ion of Military Feus, that
its Cour&s;e is ever to de&s;cend, never to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>TO proceed to other Matters, I have ex|plained
above, one Effect of bringing Land
into Commerce, which is that of introducing
Primogeniture into all Sorts of Holdings: I
&s;hall now take Notice of other Effects of this
Innovation &s;till more remarkable. The Feu|dal
Law was an In&s;titution adapted intirely to
War, admirably contrived for that End. But
it was an utter Enemy to Labour and Indu|&s;try,
and even, among an indolent People,
&s;carce &s;ufferable in peaceable Times. Such an
In&s;titution could not be long-lived. Accor|ding
to the Circum&s;tances of the Times, and
Humours of the People, various Changes
were introduced in different Countries, all of
them tending to correct its Har&s;hne&s;s, and to
&s;often it down to a more peaceable Tempera|ment.
It is quite wore out in &s;everal Places,
and even where it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, it is reduced to a
Shadow. As Land is one of the mo&s;t de&s;i|rable
<PB N="155" REF="156">
Objects, the Feudal Law was mo&s;t un|natural
in this Re&s;pect, that the Property of
Land was altogether withdrawn from Com|merce,
and &s;carce any Means to come at the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and U&s;e of it, but by military Ser|vice.
The Hard&s;hip was not much felt in
Times of War: But after the Arts of Peace
began to be cultivated, Manufactures and
Trade to revive in <HI>Europe,</HI> and Riches to en|crea&s;e,
this In&s;titution behoved to turn ex|treme
burden&s;ome. It fir&s;t tottered, and then
fell by its own Weight, as wanting a &s;olid
Foundation. All Parties con&s;pired again&s;t
it, even the&s;e who were mo&s;t intere&s;ted to
&s;upport it. Superiors began to find, that they
could make more of their Lands than by allot|ting
them for military Service. They were
willing to change this Service for Rent, and
the Tenants turning them&s;elves to Indu&s;try, or
at lea&s;t fond of Independency, were plea&s;ed
with the Exchange. Other Superiors, to
&s;upply Means for Luxury, and tempted with
a Price, were willing to give off detached
Pieces of Land. And thus, by Degrees,
<PB N="156" REF="157">
Lands returned to their original Condition of
being the principal Subject of Commerce.</P>
<P>THIS behoved to introduce &s;ome new Re|gulations
with regard to Succe&s;&s;ion. A Man
who gets Lands as a Gratuity, or the U&s;ufruct
of it, in Name of Wages, may rea&s;onably be
confined within the &s;tricte&s;t Bounds. But
he who purcha&s;es Land, and pays a full
Price, propo&s;es to have it under his own Ma|nagement,
and at his own Di&s;po&s;al. He pro|po&s;es
particularly, when he dies, that it &s;hall
go to his Heirs without Limitation. And
the Per&s;on who aliens, &s;uppo&s;ing him to re|tain
the Superiority, finds it his Intere&s;t to a|gree
to tho&s;e Conditions, &s;ince upon that
Account he gets a greater Price for the Sub|ject.
Perhaps this was not provided for in
the fir&s;t Purcha&s;es which were made. People
who have Money to be&s;tow, will take Land
upon any Terms rather than want. But as
the Appetite for Liberty and Independency
is active and univer&s;al, there will always be
found Purcha&s;ers to pay for the&s;e Convenien|cies;
<PB N="157" REF="158">
and they who &s;tand in Need of Mo|ney,
will be tempted to di&s;po&s;e of every
Thing that can procure it. And thus by De|grees,
the Succe&s;&s;ion to Heirs what&s;oever was
introduced into Feudal Rights: That is, colla|teral
Succe&s;&s;ion, properly &s;o called, took Place,
which was not formerly known.</P>
<P>FROM this Deduction it will be obvious,
that, for a con&s;iderable Time, collateral Heirs
were only admitted to &s;ucceed in Feus pur|cha&s;ed
with Money, or other valuable Con&s;i|deration.
Military Feus would remain upon
their old Footing, exclu&s;ive of collateral Suc|ce&s;&s;ion.
And thus the Notion of Conque&s;t
came in, as oppo&s;ed to Heritage, or what came
to the Va&s;&s;al from his Ance&s;tors by De&s;cent.
And during this Period there certainly was
no Di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>feuda vetera et nova,</HI>
but betwixt Feus acquired by Purcha&s;e,
which behoved all to be late, and Feus gran|ted
for military Service, which might be ei|ther
old or new.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">
WHEN once this Matter of collateral Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
came to be generally known, it grew
into common Repute, and every Per&s;on did
aim at it. And as Bargains of all Sorts about
Land came into Practice, the mixed Nature
of &s;uch Bargains, partly onerous, partly gra|tuitous,
did quite confound the Di&s;tinction
e&s;tabli&s;hed betwixt a Purcha&s;e and a Grant
for military Service; and &s;o by Degrees it
crept into the Feudal Law, that new Acqui&s;i|tions
of Land, for whatever Cau&s;e, did go to
Heirs what&s;omever. And this behoved to
introduce a new Di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>feuda
vetera et nova.</HI> Under <HI>feuda nova</HI> were
comprehended Feus purcha&s;ed at whatever
Time, and late Feus granted for whatever
Cau&s;e; in all of which collateral Succe&s;&s;ion
did obtain. Under <HI>feuda vetera</HI> were com|prehended
all the old Feus granted for mili|tary
Service, which did only de&s;cend to the
Male Heirs of the original Va&s;&s;al. As the&s;e
old Feus are long ago wore out, this Di|&s;tinction
betwixt <HI>feuda vetera et nova</HI> mu&s;t
be at an End. And now, at lea&s;t in this
<PB N="159" REF="160">
I&s;land, every Land Right goes to Heirs
what&s;omever, unle&s;s the contrary be &s;peci|fied.</P>
<P>AT what Periods the&s;e &s;everal Changes in
the Feudal Succe&s;&s;ion were introduced, is not
certainly known. Hi&s;tory does not deal in
&s;uch Matters; for Lawyers are &s;eldom Hi&s;to|rians,
and Hi&s;torians as &s;eldom Lawyers.
But as we have Traces of the&s;e Di&s;tinctions
in our Law-books, tho' ob&s;curely handled,
the Original of collateral Succe&s;&s;ion, and its
&s;everal Enlargements, do follow &s;o naturally
the Increa&s;e of Trade and Riches, that there
is no re&s;i&s;ting the Conviction which ari&s;es from
the above Deduction. Let us but con&s;ider,
that once there was no collateral Succe&s;&s;ion in
the Feudal Law, and that now it is univer&s;al,
not by Statute, but by Practice, and we will
find the &s;everal Gradations above mentioned
natural and ea&s;y, nay, what mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
have happened by the Progre&s;s of Arts and
Sciences, which in&s;pired us not only with a
Ta&s;te for Liberty and Independency, but made
<PB N="160" REF="161">
Riches flow in among us, wherewithal to
purcha&s;e the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>HAVING opened up the Origin of collate|ral
Succe&s;&s;ion in the Feudal Law, and the Pro|gre&s;s
of it thro' its various Changes, with re|gard
to the Subjects in which it did, and does
now obtain. I go on to examine who the&s;e
collateral Heirs are who have a Right to &s;uc|ceed.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;econd Brother makes a
Purcha&s;e of Land, and dies without Heirs of
his Body, whereby the Succe&s;&s;ion opens to
his Collaterals, the Que&s;tion is, whether the
elder or younger Brother &s;hould be preferred.
The Principle above laid down favours the
younger, that it is natural for Heritage to de|&s;cend,
and unnatural that it &s;hould a&s;cend.
Further, this was become a Standard Prin|ciple,
and con&s;tantly applied to give Prefe|rence
to the younger Brother, in the Succe&s;|&s;ion
of E&s;tates devolving from a Father to a
middle Brother. And it will be ob&s;erved,
<PB N="161" REF="162">
that the Principle here ought to have the grea|ter
Effect, as acting without a Counterba|lance.
In the Ca&s;e of Heritage, where the
E&s;tate de&s;cends from the common Father, we
are apt to turn our Thoughts upon him, from
whence they naturally fall upon his elde&s;t Son.
This Circum&s;tance does not militate again&s;t
the younger Brother, in the Ca&s;e of an E&s;tate
acquired by a middle Brother; for the E&s;tate
being his own Conque&s;t, we are not prompt|ed
to look further back. In a Word, if the
younger Brother is preferred in Heritage, not|with&s;tanding
of a certain Propen&s;ity in favours
of the elde&s;t, much more ought he to be pre|ferred
in Conque&s;t, where there is no &s;uch
Propen&s;ity again&s;t him. Yet in Fact the el|der
Brother is preferred by all Nations who
have embraced the Feudal Law. And this
will not appear &s;trange, when the Circum|&s;tances
of Time are attended to. We have a
Propen&s;ity in our Nature to act upon general
Principles, as being ea&s;y in their Application,
by avoiding Intricacies, which more ab&s;tract
Rea&s;oning mu&s;t lead us into. The Right of
<PB N="162" REF="163">
Primogeniture was but growing into Fa&s;hion
when the Rules of Succe&s;&s;ion in Heritage were
&s;ettled, and &s;o had not Weight enough to
counterbalance a natural Impul&s;e. But by
the Time that Land came to be the common
Subject of Commerce, the Right of Primo|geniture
was e&s;tabli&s;hed as a general Principle,
and as the common Law of the Land. In|&s;tances
of preferring the younger Brother in
the Succe&s;&s;ion of the middle Brother's E&s;tate,
behoved to be rare, in Compari&s;on of prefer|ring
the elder Brother to the Father's E&s;tate,
and &s;uch rare In&s;tances making no Figure, in
Oppo&s;ition to the general Rule, the Right of
Primogeniture was readily laid hold of to de|termine
this Point. And when the Error is
&s;o common of &s;ub&s;tituting Names for Things,
it will be no Surpri&s;e, that this was made the
determining Rule, tho' in &s;trict Thinking it
does not meet the Ca&s;e. After the Hint is
given, nothing can be more obvious, than
that the Cau&s;e of preferring the elde&s;t Son to
the Father's Succe&s;&s;ion, does by no Means
apply to the Succe&s;&s;ion of a younger Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="164">
BUT we are no &s;ooner extricated out of one
Labyrinth, than we are involved in a greater.
If a third Brother dies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Conque&s;t,
the Succe&s;&s;ion, by the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI> goes
to the immediate elder, by the Law of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
to the elde&s;t. What are the Foundati|ons
of the&s;e different Opinions, and which
the mo&s;t agreeable to Principles, may not be
an u&s;ele&s;s Enquiry. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who got
the Start of us in Law-matters, have been
guided in the Deci&s;ion by the Principle of Pri|mogeniture;
and indeed, after conferring the
&s;econd Brother's E&s;tate upon the elde&s;t, mo|ved
by this Principle, it was an ea&s;y Con&s;e|quence
to confer upon him al&s;o the third Bro|ther's
E&s;tate. Our People, in the Infancy of
their Law, &s;wayed more by natural Feelings,
than by general Principles, have judged of this
Matter after a different Manner. Beginning
at the third Brother who&s;e E&s;tate was in Que|&s;tion,
it has been ob&s;erved, that the Mind in
its Progre&s;s would pa&s;s fir&s;t to the &s;econd Bro|ther,
and from him to the elde&s;t. In this
Way the &s;econd Brother was con&s;idered as one
<PB N="164" REF="165">
Step nearer to the Decea&s;ed than the elde&s;t is,
and &s;o was preferred to the Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'TIS probable the Feudal Law was intro|duced
into <HI>Scotland,</HI> before an Opportunity
offered of fixing this Point in <HI>England,</HI> other|ways
it would have come along to us, with
their other Feudal Cu&s;toms. Thus we were
left to our own Way of thinking in &s;olving
the Problem. And tho' we have determined
the Point, by Similitude of Di&s;tance and pro|gre&s;&s;ive
Motion, yet it appears, that &s;ome of
our Lawyers have rea&s;oned not quite uniform|ly
upon this Subject. The learned <HI>Craig</HI>
puts a Ca&s;e, <HI>L. 2. Dieg.</HI> 15. &sect; <HI>ult.</HI> It is of
four Brothers, three of the fir&s;t Marriage,
the fourth of a &s;econd. The fourth acquires
a Land E&s;tate, and dies without I&s;&s;ue. Our
Author ob&s;erves, that other Lawyers were
for preferring the immediate elder Brother,
tho' of a different Marriage; and &s;uch, no
doubt, at pre&s;ent, is the Law of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
whatever Difficulty there might be in the Que|&s;tion
before the Rule was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Prac|tice;
<PB N="165" REF="166">
he is for preferring the elde&s;t Brother,
&startq;Becau&s;e (&s;ays he) in the Ca&s;e of different
Marriages, the Connection or Conjunction
begins at the elde&s;t, and pa&s;&s;es thro' him to
the &s;econd and third.&endq; This is ob&s;curely
&s;aid, but it is not difficult to gather what our
Author had in View. The Argument, when
brought out to Light, is &s;ubtile and ingeni|ous.
Where the Brothers are all clo&s;ely uni|ted
by being of the &s;ame Marriage, we feel
an intimate Connection among&s;t them, with|out
thinking of the connecting Principle. But
among&s;t Brothers of different Marriages, the
fir&s;t Idea that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, is rather that of
Difference and Oppo&s;ition, than of Union.
This forces us when we inve&s;tigate the Rela|tion,
to ca&s;t about for a connecting Principle,
which we find to be the common Parent; and
as from him the fir&s;t Step is to the elde&s;t Son,
we conceive this Son to be one Step nearer
than the &s;econd, and two Steps nearer than
the third.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
WHEN the Matter of Succe&s;&s;ion depends
upon &s;uch remote Foundations, and upon
&s;uch &s;light Feelings, 'tis no Wonder the Cu|&s;toms
of different Nations &s;hould be &s;o dif|ferent,
and that there &s;hould not even be any
uniform or con&s;i&s;tent Plan of Succe&s;&s;ion in the
&s;ame Nation: And indeed ours, in particu|lar,
is far from being uniform. Another
Mi&s;take has crept into our Law, and into all
our Law-Books, le&s;s excu&s;eable than any a|bove
&s;ugge&s;ted. Let us recollect the Di&s;tinc|tion
mentioned above, betwixt <HI>feuda vetera
et nova.</HI> In the fir&s;t Cla&s;s were the old Feus
e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the Footing of military Ser|vice,
where the Succe&s;&s;ion was confined to
Male De&s;cendents of the original Va&s;&s;al, and
which con&s;equently behoved gradually to de|&s;cend;
and could never a&s;cend. The other
Cla&s;s comprehended Purcha&s;es, and all late
Feus granted for whatever Cau&s;e, which went
to Heirs what&s;omever. In the&s;e, when the
Succe&s;&s;ion opened to Collaterals of the origi|nal
Va&s;&s;al, the elde&s;t Brother and his De|&s;cendents
were preferred as the Heirs of
<PB N="167" REF="168">
Line. 'Tis mighty plain, that the&s;e <HI>feuda
nova</HI> could never become <HI>feuda vetera</HI> in a|ny
Cour&s;e of Time, &s;o as to exclude colla|teral
Succe&s;&s;ion, or to bar Succe&s;&s;ion by A|&s;cent.
If Conque&s;t go to the elder Brother,
where the Acquirer a middle Brother, dies
without I&s;&s;ue, no imaginable Rea&s;on can be
given why it ought not to go in the &s;ame
Channel, where the Acquirer leaves a Son
who &s;ucceeds, and dies without I&s;&s;ue. In
one Word, collateral Succe&s;&s;ion, and Succe&s;|&s;ion
by A&s;cent, ought to be convertible
Terms; if in any one Ca&s;e the elde&s;t Brother
is the lineal Heir, he ought to be con&s;idered
as &s;uch in every Ca&s;e of collateral Succe&s;&s;i|on.
But the&s;e Matters fir&s;t took Footing in
the Days of Ignorance, when the Concepti|ons
of Mankind were gro&s;s and inaccurate.
What it may be in other Countries I know
not, but in the Practice of <HI>Scotland</HI> a very
motely Scheme is e&s;tabli&s;hed. We conceive
nothing to be a <HI>feudum novum,</HI> but an im|mediate
Acqui&s;ition. If it has once pa&s;t by
Succe&s;&s;ion, we under&s;tand it to be a <HI>feudum
<PB N="168" REF="169">
antiquum,</HI> or Heritage, not &s;o indeed as to
exclude collateral Succe&s;&s;ion, but &s;o as to
make the Succe&s;&s;ion for ever after to de&s;cend,
and never to a&s;cend. And we have been led
into this Practice by an Error, apt, as above
ob&s;erved, to &s;lip into all Sorts of Rea&s;oning,
which is that of mi&s;taking Words for Things.
Not attending to the Import of the Di&s;tinc|tion
betwixt <HI>feudum antiquum et novum,</HI> we
took up with the Word, and de&s;erted the
Meaning, and &s;o by Degrees came to con|ceive
every old Feu to be <HI>feudum antiquum.</HI>
And as there are no preci&s;e Boundaries be|twixt
what is old and what is new, we were
forced, at la&s;t, to fix upon this Rule, That
whatever has pa&s;t by Succe&s;&s;ion, is to be un|der&s;tood
a <HI>feudum antiquum.</HI> And having
once introduced this arbitrary Di&s;tinction, in
Place of the former, we unwarily applied to
it the&s;e general Rules, which do apply only
to the original Di&s;tinction betwixt <HI>feudum
antiquum et novum:</HI> Nothing can be more
gro&s;s. In Place of the proper Di&s;tinction
betwixt <HI>feudum antiquum et novum,</HI> to &s;ub|&s;titute
<PB N="169" REF="170">
another of a quite different Kind, that
has no Relation to it but the Name; and yet
to mi&s;take this new invented Di&s;tinction for
the old, &s;o as to give it the &s;ame Effect in
Law, was certainly confounding Things in a
&s;trange Manner, and what could only happen
in the Days of gro&s;s Ignorance. It is very
true, that we went no further than to ex|clude
the Privilege of Primogeniture, where
a Feu had once been taken up by Succe&s;&s;ion.
We never con&s;idered it to be a <HI>feudum an|tiquum</HI>
in any &s;uch proper Sen&s;e, as to ex|clude
collateral Succe&s;&s;ion. Fal&s;e Rea&s;oning
could &s;carce lead us &s;o far. In judging of a
nice Ca&s;e, &s;uch as the Competition betwixt
two Brothers, we might be led to &s;ub&s;titute
one Idea for another, the <HI>feudum antiquum</HI>
for the <HI>feudum novum,</HI> e&s;pecially if the Di&s;|pute
happened about a Feu that was really
old, or of a long &s;tanding. But, in a Di&s;pute
betwixt the Heir of the Va&s;&s;al and the Su|perior,
where the Que&s;tion behoved to turn
upon a Point of Fact, whether the Feu was
granted after the Period that all Grants of this
<PB N="170" REF="171">
Kind were under&s;tood to go to Heirs what|&s;omever,
there could be little Room for Mi|&s;take.</P>
<P>AND now to explain the Terms of <HI>Heir
of Conque&s;t</HI> and <HI>Heir of Line,</HI> let us &s;uppo&s;e
a <HI>feudum novum</HI> and a <HI>feudum antiquum</HI>
properly &s;o called, centered both in a middle
Brother: The la&s;t, 'tis plain, cannot be, but
by a De&s;tination excluding the elde&s;t Brother.
Or let us &s;uppo&s;e them both to be <HI>feuda no|va,</HI>
the one purcha&s;ed by the &s;econd Brother
him&s;elf, the other e&s;tabli&s;hed in his Per&s;on by
virtue of a De&s;tination. Or, conform to our
pre&s;ent Practice, let the one be a Purcha&s;e,
the other a Subject to which he derives Right,
as repre&s;enting a younger Brother. The el|de&s;t
Brother will &s;ucceed in the Lands con|que&s;t
by the middle Brother, the younger
will &s;ucceed in the Lands that came to the
middle Brother by Succe&s;&s;ion. And &s;o it
may often happen, that the &s;ame Per&s;on's Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
is &s;plit and divided betwixt two Male
Repre&s;entatives, the one named <HI>the Heir of
<PB N="171" REF="172">
Line,</HI> the other <HI>the Heir of Conque&s;t.</HI> The&s;e
Names are only u&s;ed in the particular Ca&s;e
where both repre&s;ent the &s;ame Per&s;on: In
other Ca&s;es where there is no Occa&s;ion to
make the Di&s;tinction, they pa&s;s under the
common Appellation of <HI>Heirs at Law.</HI> For
Example, an elde&s;t Son, &s;ucceeding to Lands
purcha&s;ed by his Father, is not &s;tiled <HI>Heir of
Conque&s;t,</HI> but <HI>Heir at Law</HI> or <HI>of Line.</HI> But
with Regard to this, tho' the elder Brother is
named <HI>Heir of Conque&s;t</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to the
younger, who has the Name of <HI>Heir of Line,</HI>
we mu&s;t beware not to con&s;ider the Heir of
Conque&s;t as a limited Heir. 'Tis certain he
is <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto,</HI> and as univer|&s;al
a Repre&s;entative as the Heir of Line, pro|perly
&s;o called, can be. And &s;o &s;ays the Lord
<HI>Stair, Tit. (Heirs</HI>) &sect; 10. And he a&s;&s;igns a
very ingenious Rea&s;on for giving to the younger
Brother the Title of <HI>Heir of Line.</HI> &startq;The
elder Brother (&s;ays he) is called <HI>the Heir
of Conque&s;t,</HI> and the other retaineth the
common Name of <HI>the Heir of Line;</HI>&endq;
which is &s;aying, that the younger Brother is
<PB N="172" REF="173">
allowed to retain a Name common to both,
for want of another Term to di&s;tingui&s;h him
by.</P>
<P>TOUCHING Heir&s;hip Moveables, Tacks,
Pen&s;ions, or other &s;uch Rights from which
the Executor is excluded, and which, pro|perly
&s;peaking, are not Land Rights, it is
&s;ettled in Practice, that all of the&s;e go to the
Heir of Line, and not to the Heir of Con|que&s;t.
The Ground of this Practice may
be readily gathered. Let us recal what is ob|&s;erved
above, that the Right of Primogeni|ture,
at fir&s;t confined to military Feus, was
gradually extended to take Place in the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
of Males, whatever was the Nature
of the Feu. But as there had been no Ex|ample
of the Right of Primogeniture in the
Succe&s;&s;ion of Females, our Forefathers did
not think of carrying this Right beyond the
Practice, and &s;o confined it to the Male Suc|ce&s;&s;ion.
The &s;ame has happened here. The
Privilege of Primogeniture had only taken
<PB N="173" REF="174">
Place in Succe&s;&s;ion to Lands; and as there
was no Example or Authority to determine
the Point touching the Subjects now in Que|&s;tion,
the natural Feelings prevailed, and the
Propen&s;ity to pa&s;s downwards, or according
to the Succe&s;&s;ion of Time.</P>

keeping in Memory one of the mo&s;t notorious
Pieces of Prie&s;t-craft ever was practi&s;ed.
Would any one believe, that there is a Coun|try,
and in <HI>Europe</HI> too, where the Clergy
gained &s;uch an A&s;cendant over the Minds of
the People, as tamely to &s;uffer the moveable
E&s;tate of every Man who died inte&s;tate, to be
<PB N="175" REF="176">
&s;wallowed up by them. Tho&s;e who draw
their Notions from the pre&s;ent Age, will &s;carce
give Faith to the Story, that Super&s;tition could
ever be &s;o prevalent, in any Age, as to pro|duce
a Law preferring the Bi&s;hop to the next
of Kin. But let them &s;u&s;pend their Wonder
for a Moment, till they learn the whole Ex|tent
of this Law. It did not &s;top at exclud|ing
the Relations of the Decea&s;ed, &s;uppo&s;ing
them to be his Children. The Wife was ex|cluded.
Nay the Creditors were excluded.
All was given to the Bi&s;hop <HI>per aver&s;ionem.</HI>
Of <HI>Britain</HI> we are talking, and yet the &s;hame|le&s;s
Rapacity was &s;uffered here for Ages. We
may believe &s;uch a mon&s;trous Practice could
not be e&s;tabli&s;hed at once. It crept in by De|grees.
The Foundation was laid in a Doc|trine
&s;edulou&s;ly inculcated, That the moveable
Effects of every dead Per&s;on, failing his own
Appointment, ought to be laid out for pro|moting
the Good of his Soul. This brought
the Clergy into the Play. The <HI>Ordinary</HI> pre|tended
at fir&s;t but to give Advice, but this Ad|vice,
in Proce&s;s of Time, gained Authority,
<PB N="176" REF="177">
and became a Command. At la&s;t the Mask
was thrown off, and the Ordinary, without
Ceremony, took up the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without
deigning to account to any Mortal. Let us
hear a grave Author<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bacon</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e of the Laws and Government of <HI>England,</HI> Part I. Cap. 66.</NOTE> upon this Subject.
&startq;Originally the Goods of the Inte&s;tate pa&s;|&s;ed
by a kind of De&s;cent to the Children;
afterwards by a <HI>Saxon</HI> Law, the Wife had
her Part. In <HI>Henry</HI> I's Time the Clergy
had gotten a Ta&s;te; for altho' the Wife
and Children, or next of Kin had then the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, yet it was for the Good of the
Soul of the Decea&s;ed; and the Ordinary had
a directing Power therein, and was in the
Nature of an Over&s;eer, and &s;omewhat more.
Afterwards, in the Time of King <HI>John</HI> the
Clergy had drawn Blood; for tho' the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
was as formerly, yet the Dividend
mu&s;t be made in the View of the Church;
and by this Means the Dividers were but
mere In&s;truments, and the Right was va|ni&s;hed
into the Clouds. But in <HI>Henry</HI> III's
<PB N="177" REF="178">
Time, the Clergy had not only gotten the
Game, but gorged it: Both Right and Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
was now become theirs, and Wrong
done to none but the Clouds.&endq;</P>
<P>AND &s;o it came to be &s;ettled<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">New Abridgement of the Law, Tit. <HI>Executors and Admini&s;trators,</HI> P. 398.</NOTE>, That if a
Man died inte&s;tate, neither his Wife, Chil|dren,
nor next of Kin, had Right to any
Share of his E&s;tate, but the <HI>Ordinary</HI> was to
di&s;tribute it according to his Con&s;cience, to
pious U&s;es; and &s;ometimes the Wife and
Children might be among&s;t the Number of
tho&s;e whom he appointed to receive it; but
however, the Law tru&s;ted him with the whole
Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Statute that limited the Power
of the <HI>Ordinary</HI> was 13th, <HI>Edward</HI> I. <HI>C.</HI> 19.
by which it is enacted, &startq;That where a Man
dies inte&s;tate, and in Debt, and the Goods
come to the <HI>Ordinary</HI> to be di&s;po&s;ed, he
&s;hall &s;atisfy the Debts &s;o far as the Goods
<PB N="178" REF="179">
extend, in &s;uch Sort, as the Executors of
&s;uch Per&s;on &s;hould have done, in ca&s;e he
had made a Will.&endq; Afterwards the actual
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was taken from the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> by
obliging him to give a Deputation <HI>to the next
and mo&s;t lawful Friends of the Inte&s;tate, for
admini&s;trating his Goods.</HI> 31&s;t <HI>Edward</HI> III.
<HI>Cap.</HI> II. But this Statute proved but a weak
Check to the Avarice of the Clergy. Means
were fallen upon to elude it, by preferring
&s;uch of the Inte&s;tate's Relations who were
willing to offer the be&s;t Terms. This cor|rupt
Practice was &s;uffered to the Days of
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. when the Clergy lo&s;ing Ground,
the Statute 21. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5. was e|nacted,
bearing, &startq;That in ca&s;e any Per&s;on
die inte&s;tate, or the Executors refu&s;e to
prove the Te&s;tament, the <HI>Ordinary</HI> &s;hall
grant Admini&s;tration to the Widow, or to
the next of Kin, or to both, taking Surety
for true Admini&s;tration.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Statute, as it points out the particu|lar
Per&s;ons who are intitled to have Letters
<PB N="179" REF="180">
of Admini&s;tration, without leaving any Choice
to the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> was certainly intended to
cut him out of all Hope of making Gain of
the Effects of Per&s;ons dying inte&s;tate. But
the Church does not ea&s;ily quit its Hold.
Means were fallen upon to elude this Law
al&s;o. Tho' the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the&s;e Statutes,
was wre&s;ted out of the Hands of the <HI>Ordinary,</HI>
yet his Preten&s;ions &s;ub&s;i&s;ted entire, of calling
the Admini&s;trator to account, and obliging
him or her to di&s;tribute the Effects to pious
U&s;es. This was an admirable Engine in the
Hands of a Churchman for &s;queezing Money.
We may readily believe, that the Admini&s;tra|tor
who gave any con&s;iderable Share to the
Bi&s;hop, to be laid out by him, without Doubt!
upon pious U&s;es, would not find much Dif|ficulty
in making his Accompt. It was pro|bably
this rank Abu&s;e, which moved the
Judges of <HI>England</HI> &s;olemnly to re&s;olve, That
the Ordinary, after Admini&s;tration granted by
him, cannot compel the Admini&s;trator to
make Di&s;tribution<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">La&s;t mentioned Author, P. 414.</NOTE>. But at la&s;t the Right of
<PB N="180" REF="181">
the next of Kin was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by Sta|tute
22 and 23. <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>Cap.</HI> 10. which e|nacts,
That after Payment of Debts, Fune|rals
and ju&s;t Expences of all Sorts, the Surplu|&s;age
&s;hall be di&s;tributed as follows: &startq;One
Third to the Wife of the Inte&s;tate, the Re|&s;idue
among&s;t the Children, and &s;uch as
legally repre&s;ent them, if any of them be
dead. If there be no Children, nor legal
Repre&s;entatives of them, one Moiety &s;hall
be allotted to the Wife, the Re&s;idue equal|ly
to the next of Kin to the Inte&s;tate, in
equal Degree, and tho&s;e who repre&s;ent
them. But no Repre&s;entation &s;hall be ad|mitted
among&s;t Collaterals, after Brothers
and Si&s;ters Children. And if there be no
Wife, all &s;hall be di&s;tribute among&s;t the
Children; and if no Child, to the next of
Kin to the Inte&s;tate in equal Degree, and
their Repre&s;entatives.&endq;</P>
<P>WE may rea&s;onably conjecture, that the
Church was equally &s;ucce&s;sful in both Parts
of the I&s;land. We have undoubted Evidence
<PB N="181" REF="182">
that &s;o early as the Days of our King <HI>Wil|liam,</HI>
which was in the twelfth Century, the
<HI>Ordinaries</HI> or Bi&s;hops had wrought them|&s;elves
into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and Admini&s;tration
of the moveable Effects of Per&s;ons dying in|te&s;tate.
Their Pretext mu&s;t have been the
&s;ame as in <HI>England,</HI> to di&s;tribute the Effects
for pious U&s;es, in order to promote the Good
of the Soul. Upon &s;uch a Foundation no
Action at common Law could be competent
to oblige the <HI>Ordinary</HI> to accompt, whether
at the In&s;tance of the Wife, Children, or
Creditors. The Di&s;tribution was to be left
to his Direction, and upon his Con&s;cience.
And what &s;eems to put this pa&s;t Doubt is,
that it required a Statute here as well as in
<HI>England,</HI> to oblige the <HI>Ordinary</HI> to do Ju&s;tice
even to Creditors, who are, of all certainly
the mo&s;t privileged. All this appears from
the 22d Chapter of the Statutes of King <HI>Wil|liam.</HI>
The Words are, &startq;After the Decea&s;e
of any Man inte&s;tate, and owing Debts to
Creditors, his Goods &s;hall be di&s;poned by
his <HI>Ordinary,</HI> and the <HI>Ordinary</HI> &s;hall be o|bliged
<PB N="182" REF="183">
to an&s;wer for the Debts, &s;o far as the
Goods and Gear will extend, in the &s;ame
Manner as Executors named by the Defunct
are bound to do.&endq; This Statute is full Evi|dence
that in this early Age, the Bi&s;hops were
taking Liberties contrary to Con&s;cience, and
the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, even &s;o far as to
defraud the Inte&s;tate's Creditors. We may
believe the Cry was great before the Reme|dy
was applied; and yet this did not open
the Eyes of our Lawgivers. The Wife, Chil|dren,
and neare&s;t of Kin were left intirely at
the Mercy of the Church. It is true, the
Evil was not greatly felt, becau&s;e it was in
every Man's Power to prevent it, by making
a Will. And it was probably urged in Fa|vours
of the Church, that it mu&s;t be the pre|&s;umed
Intention of every Man who makes no
Will, to leave the Management of his move|able
E&s;tate to the <HI>Ordinary.</HI></P>
<P>BUT Ca&s;es occurring of Per&s;ons dying un|der
Age, who are incapable of making a Te|&s;tament,
our People began to perceive the
<PB N="183" REF="184">
Weakne&s;s of the Church's Argument from
Intention; for the Ordinary made no Dif|ficulty
of &s;eizing the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion al&s;o in this
Ca&s;e, tho' he had not even the Pretext of
an implied Intention. This Practice there|fore
was thought a Grievance, and a Statute
was made to redre&s;s it. The Preamble of
the Act 120. <HI>P.</HI> 1540. is, &startq;That whereas
Per&s;ons often dying young, who cannot
make a Te&s;tament, the Executor named
by the Ordinary does notwith&s;tanding in|tromit
with the whole Goods, and with|draw
the &s;ame from the neare&s;t of Kin,
who &s;hould have the &s;ame by Law:&endq;
Therefore enacted, &startq;That when any Per|&s;on
dies who cannot make a Te&s;tament,
their next of Kin &s;hall have their Goods,
without Prejudice to the <HI>Ordinary</HI>'s Claim
of a Quote.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Statute laid the Foundation of a le|gal
Claim, which was &s;oon thereafter enlar|ged.
One Article of the In&s;tructions 1563,
given to the Commi&s;&s;aries is, &startq;That if one die
<PB N="184" REF="185">
inte&s;tate, or his Executor nominate refu&s;e to
accept of the Office, the Commi&s;&s;aries mu&s;t
give the Office to the neare&s;t of Kin, be|ing
willing to find Caution.&endq; This is co|pied
from the above mentioned Statute of
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. enacted a few Years before.
But the Regulation had &s;till a better Effect in
<HI>Scotland</HI> than in <HI>England.</HI> It required a Sta|tute
there to complete the Right of the next
of Kin, and to protect them from the En|croachments
of the Clergy. But in <HI>Scotland</HI>
the Bi&s;hops, immediately upon the Reforma|tion,
having lo&s;t all Authority, the next of
Kin getting Letters of Admini&s;tration from
the Commi&s;&s;aries, came of Cour&s;e to retain
the Effects, without having any to accompt
to, &s;ave to tho&s;e who had a natural Right.
The Bi&s;hop had lo&s;t his Claim, and the Com|mi&s;&s;aries
never had any.</P>
<P>I OBSERVE, that in the above Article of
the In&s;tructions 1563, no Mention is made of
the Relict, tho' her Intere&s;t is expre&s;ly taken
Care of in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Statute, whence the
<PB N="185" REF="186">
Article is copied. This could not have
happened by Inadvertency. My Conjecture
is, that our Judges have taken the hone&s;t
Liberty to &s;u&s;tain Action again&s;t the <HI>Ordina|ries,</HI>
to the Relict for her Third, and to the
Children for their Legitim, in Imitation of
King <HI>William</HI>'s Statute affording Action to
Creditors. If a legal Claim was afforded to
the Wife and Children by the Practice of the
Courts of Law, it was unnece&s;&s;ary to make
any further Provi&s;ion for them in the In&s;truc|tions
1563; and &s;o the Article is confined
to the next of Kin, who formerly had no
Claim. And it was extreme natural for our
Judges to take this Liberty, con&s;idering that
the Wife and Children, by the common Law
of the Land, had an unexceptionable Claim
again&s;t the Executor nominate. And it might
well be thought &s;trange and unaccountable,
that a Man &s;hould have it in his Power to
defraud his Wife and Children of their ju&s;t
Claim, by forbearing to make a Will, or that
the <HI>Ordinary</HI> &s;hould not be liable as well as
the Executor nominate.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
THUS the Right of the neare&s;t of Kin is
e&s;tabli&s;hed, where the Predece&s;&s;or dies inte|&s;tate.
But where a Te&s;tament is made, which
is the more frequent Ca&s;e, they were left
without Remedy, unle&s;s Provi&s;ion was made
for them in the Te&s;tament. They had no
Right hitherto e&s;tabli&s;hed in them, &s;ave the
Privilege of being preferred to all others in the
Office of Executry. But this Privilege could
not take Place where an Executor was named
by the Decea&s;ed, nor was any Action competent
at common Law to oblige the Executor nomi|nate
to account to them. 'Twas under&s;tood to
be the Will of the Decea&s;ed, that the Di&s;tri|bution
&s;hould be left to the Di&s;cretion of the
Executor, where the contrary was not ex|pre&s;&s;ed;
ju&s;t as formerly it was under&s;tood
to be his Will to leave all to the Di&s;cretion
of the <HI>Ordinary</HI> where he died inte&s;tate.
And thus it happened, that the very Nomi|nation
intitled the Executor to retain to him|&s;elf
the free Moveables, even where he was
not named univer&s;al or re&s;iduary Legatar.
This was remedied by the Act 14. <HI>P.</HI> 1617.
<PB N="187" REF="188">
which gives to the next of Kin the like Ac|tion
again&s;t the Executor nominate to ac|compt
for the Effects confirmed, that was be|fore
competent again&s;t him at the In&s;tance
of the Wife and Children.</P>
<P>OUR Law then with Regard to the Inte|re&s;t
of the neare&s;t of Kin, &s;tands thus. Where
the Predece&s;&s;or dies inte&s;tate, they are privi|leged
to be Executors, or Admini&s;trators with|out
accompt, and of con&s;equence to retain the
free Effects. Where he makes a Will, they
are intitled to call the Executor to accompt.
But where by Over&s;ight or Accident they hap|pen
not to apply, <HI>debito tempore,</HI> to be confirm|ed
Executors, &s;o that a Creditor gets the Of|fice,
or perhaps the Procurator-fi&s;cal, I &s;ee
no Remedy. There is certainly no Action
given in this Ca&s;e to the next of Kin again&s;t
the Admini&s;trator or Executor-dative to ac|compt,
as there is in the Ca&s;e of an Executor
nominate. Nor is there <HI>par ratio,</HI> as it mu&s;t
be the Fault of the next of Kin, if they are
cut out of their Right where the Predece&s;&s;or
<PB N="188" REF="189">
dies inte&s;tate: And the In&s;tructions to the
Commi&s;&s;aries 1666, do take it for granted, that
no &s;uch Action is competent; for it obliges
the Procurator-fi&s;cal, who failing others, is
allowed to confirm, to accompt to the Arch|bi&s;hop
or Bi&s;hop, he having three Shillings
for every Pound he brings in and makes Pay|ment
of. Yet where &s;o many Steps are taken
to found the next of Kin in a legal Claim, we
are naturally led to complete the Scheme, by
giving them a Right in every Ca&s;e. And it
is extreme likely, that if &s;uch a Que&s;tion come
before the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, the Judges will
&s;u&s;tain a Claim at the In&s;tance of the next of
Kin again&s;t an Executor Creditor, and <HI>multo
magis</HI> again&s;t the Procurator-fi&s;cal confirming.
And what leads me to think &s;o, is the Act of
Sederunt 14th <HI>November</HI> 1679, in which it
is taken for granted, that an Executor Credi|tor
is liable to accompt, not only to the Re|lict
and Children, but to the next of Kin.</P>
<P>FROM this &s;hort Hi&s;tory of the Tran&s;mi&s;|&s;ion
of Moveables from the Dead to the Li|ving,
<PB N="189" REF="190">
it will be evident that there is no &s;uch
Thing, properly &s;peaking, in the Law of this
I&s;land, as an Heir <HI>in mobilibus.</HI> If a Will is
made, the Form of it is to name an Executor,
or Tru&s;tee, to di&s;tribute the Effects; and
&s;ometimes this Di&s;tribution is left to be made
by the e&s;tabli&s;hed Rules of Law, &s;ometimes
Directions are given in the Will it&s;elf, as where
a certain Sum is appointed to be paid to this
or that Per&s;on, commonly called a Legacy.
If the Per&s;on dies inte&s;tate, the whole move|able
Effects are under&s;tood to be <HI>eo ip&s;o</HI> ve&s;ted
in the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> or in Place of him, the Com|mi&s;&s;aries
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> not in the Quality of
Heirs, but as Tru&s;tees to di&s;tribute the Effects
to pious U&s;es. Accordingly no Per&s;on is le|gally
intitled to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an Inte&s;tate's
Effects, otherways than by an expre&s;s War|rant
from the <HI>Ordinary</HI> or Commi&s;&s;aries. And
after the Re&s;toration, the Bi&s;hops in <HI>Scotland</HI>
took great Care to pre&s;erve their Right. They
had Spies in all Corners, and no &s;ooner was a
Man laid in his Grave, than they thundered
out all the Artillery of the Law, to force his
<PB N="190" REF="191">
Relations to apply for Letters of Admini&s;tra|tion.
But this Grievance, among others, was
redre&s;&s;ed after the Revolution. What was
&s;uffered with Impatience under the Juri&s;dic|tion
of Bi&s;hops, was not at all to be endured
under the Juri&s;diction of their Shadow, the
Commi&s;&s;aries. Accordingly a Statute was
made, Act 26, <HI>p.</HI> 1690, di&s;charging &s;uch Pro|&s;ecutions
in Time coming, &startq;That no Per&s;on
&s;hall be bound to give up Inventary of a De|funct's
Goods, and that there &s;hall be no
Confirmation, unle&s;s at the In&s;tance of the
Relict, Children, neare&s;t of Kin, or Cre|ditors.&endq;
The Intendment of this Statute,
tho' not &s;aid directly, is to transfer to the
Children or next of Kin, the Property of the
Moveables which belonged to the Decea&s;ed,
without requiring any other Act or Solemnity,
but barely the apprehending of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
This will be obvious, from con&s;idering that,
by the common Law, there is no other Form
known, of acquiring the Property of Move|ables,
which belonged to a decea&s;ed Per&s;on,
but by Warrant of the <HI>Ordinary</HI> or Com|mi&s;&s;aries.
<PB N="191" REF="192">
And when this Form is di&s;pen&s;ed
with, without &s;ub&s;tituting any other, Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
alone mu&s;t have the Effect. It is true,
Confirmation is not altogether laid a&s;ide; it is
&s;till of U&s;e to pre&s;erve the Intromitter from
being liable to Creditors beyond the Value of
the Subject. But if the Children or neare&s;t
of Kin are willing to take their Hazard, they
may &s;afely enter into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without ap|plying
for a Title. And thus, after much
wandering, the Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Moveables
from the Dead to the Living is brought back
to its natural Channel, and reduced to the
&s;imple&s;t Form.</P>
<P>IT remains only to be ob&s;erved, That tho'
in <HI>England</HI> the <HI>jus reprae&s;entationis</HI> is introdu|ced
to a certain Extent, in the Succe&s;&s;ion of
Moveables <HI>ab inte&s;tato,</HI> we have not thought
proper to follow this Practice. We adhere
&s;trictly to the Law of Nature in moveable
Succe&s;&s;ion, by preferring the next in Blood,
without Di&s;tinction betwixt Male and Female,
and without regard to the Privilege of Pri|mogeniture.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX
TOUCHING
The HEREDITARY and INDEFEASIBLE
RIGHT of KINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE hereditary-indefea&s;ible Right of
Kings, and Pa&s;&s;ive-obedience and Non|re&s;i&s;tance
its genuine Offspring, are Doctrines
which of late have made a great Noi&s;e in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
and particularly in this I&s;land. Some
Reflections upon this Subject, &s;ugge&s;ted by
the pre&s;ent unhappy Times, will make a pro|per
Appendix to the above E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider Man, ab&s;tracted from
all po&s;itive Engagements, we find nothing in
his Nature, or in his Situation, to &s;ubject him
to the Power of any, his Creator, and his
Parents excepted. The parental Power is at
an End, when Children are grown up, and
can provide for them&s;elves. At any Rate the
parental Power cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t longer than the
Life of the Parents; for it is not a Matter of
Property to be tran&s;mitted by Succe&s;&s;ion, &s;ince
<PB N="193" REF="194">
it depends upon per&s;onal Circum&s;tances. And
&s;uppo&s;ing it a Subject to be taken by Succe&s;|&s;ion,
it mu&s;t de&s;cend to all the Children e|qually,
at lea&s;t to all the Sons equally; for
Primogeniture, 'tis certain, is not a Right of
the Law of Nature, but a Con&s;equence only
of the Feudal Law. Hence it is a Principle
embraced by the grave&s;t Writers, that all
Mankind are born free, and independent of
one another.</P>
<P>MAN indeed is fitted for Society. His
Wants prompt him to it, and his Inclinati|ons
render it agreeable. Accordingly we find
Mankind almo&s;t everywhere parcelled out in|to
Societies, which have been originally form|ed
by accidental Circum&s;tances, more or le&s;s
exten&s;ive. A Society of any Extent cannot
be without Government. The Members mu&s;t
have Laws to determine their Differences, and
they mu&s;t have Rulers to put their Laws in
Execution. At the &s;ame Time, we find the
Con&s;titutions of different States, with regard
to Government, almo&s;t as various, as are the
<PB N="194" REF="195">
Sentiments of Men concerning it: So that tho'
Government be nece&s;&s;ary to the Well-being
of Society, yet from this Circum&s;tance alone,
were we to look no further back, we may
conclude no particular Form to be nece&s;&s;ary,
but the Effect of Choice, or perhaps in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure of Accident.</P>
<P>LET us trace this Matter further, becau&s;e
it is of Importance. Man is a &s;hy Animal,
and in his original State, rather aver&s;e to So|ciety.
In that State his Wants were few, and
ea&s;ily &s;upplied; therefore we may readily
conclude, that while Acorns were the Food
of Man, and Water his Drink, there was nei|ther
U&s;e nor Appetite for Soci$ty. Accor|dingly
we find Mankind originally in every
Corner of the Earth living in &s;cattered Habi|tations,
with little Intercour&s;e, except among
the Members of the &s;ame Family. The Cul|ture
of Corn laid the Foundation of a more
exten&s;ive Intercour&s;e, becau&s;e thereby mutual
A&s;&s;i&s;tance became nece&s;&s;ary. When Arts
were invented, and Indu&s;try increa&s;ed, it was
<PB N="195" REF="196">
found convenient to herd together in Towns
and Villages. From this clo&s;&s;er Connection
one Evil &s;prung, Oppo&s;ition of Intere&s;ts, for|merly
rare; which at fir&s;t was the Occa&s;ion
of Quarrels and Blood&s;hed, and afterwards of
frequent Appeals to Men of Weight and Pro|bity.
In Time the Nece&s;&s;ity of fixed Judges
to determine Differences being di&s;covered, the
Election of the&s;e Judges, which could not o|therways
be than popular, was the fir&s;t Step
to Government. The chief Magi&s;trate there|fore
was originally no more but the chief
Judge, who&s;e Powers were gradually extend|ed,
as Ca&s;es occurred, which required the
Interpo&s;ition of a Superior or Governor. War
introduced Slavery, as it &s;ubjected tho&s;e taken
in Battle to the arbitrary Will of their Con|querors;
and ab&s;olute Power was too de&s;ire|able
an Acqui&s;ition, to be the Perqui&s;ite of
Subjects only. The chief Magi&s;trate, how|ever
repugnant it is to the Nature of his Of|fice,
did often gra&s;p at it: And Hi&s;tory in|forms
us, That the chief Magi&s;trate, in dif|ferent
Societies, has been often but too &s;uc|ce&s;sful.
<PB N="196" REF="197">
In a Word, ab&s;olute Independence
and ab&s;olute Power are the two Extremes;
and the latter, at lea&s;t &s;o far as concerns So|vereignty,
could never have been introduced,
but by pa&s;&s;ing through all the intermediate
Degrees.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT therefore is one of the
Arts which Nece&s;&s;ity has &s;ugge&s;ted, which
Time and Experience have ripened, and which
mu&s;t be perpetually &s;ubject to further Im|provements.
For Government, like all other
Arts, being invented for the Good of Man|kind,
it mu&s;t be the Privilege of every Society
to improve upon it, as well as upon Manu|factures
or Husbandry. No particular Form
therefore can be nece&s;&s;ary, as no particular
Form is preferable to another, unle&s;s &s;o far as
it has a greater Tendency to promote its End,
the Good of the Society. Comparing Demo|cracy,
Ari&s;tocracy and Monarchy together,
this is their common Standard.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="198">
THERE is a People inhabiting the Earth,
who are not left to the Choice of their Go|vernors,
but are by Nature &s;ubjected to Mo|narchy.
In every Society there is a Royal
Family, of a different Species from the other
Members. Every Monarch is born with
Marks of Royalty, of a peculiar Shape, and
with &s;uperior Beauty. We may &s;uppo&s;e, that
the Excellencies of the Mind are not inferior
to tho&s;e of the Body; and no Wonder when
this is the Ca&s;e, that perfect Obedience is
given through all the State, and that their Mo|narch's
Will is their only Law. There the
Parts are ju&s;tly di&s;tributed, the Sovereign fra|med
for Command, as the Subjects for Obe|dience,
each in their &s;everal Capacities equally
contributing to the only End of Government,
the Well-being of the Society. Here there
can be no &s;tretching of Prerogative on the
one Hand, no Re&s;i&s;tance nor even Murmurs
on the other. The Monarch taught by Na|ture,
that the Sovereign Power is a Tru&s;t
which ought not to be abu&s;ed, has no De&s;ire
but to promote the publick Welfare. The
<PB N="198" REF="199">
People taught by Nature, that pa&s;&s;ive Obe|dience
and Non-re&s;i&s;tance are the only Means
to promote their Happine&s;s, implicitely &s;ub|mit
them&s;elves to their Monarch's Will.</P>
<P>WERE Mankind &s;o framed, for of In&s;ects
we have been &s;peaking, the&s;e Gentlemen
would have Rea&s;on on their Side, who de|clare
&s;o &s;trongly for indefea&s;ible-hereditary
Right, and the reciprocal Duty of pa&s;&s;ive
Obedience and Non-re&s;i&s;tance: Were our
Royal Family, like that of the Bees, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
from the Ma&s;s of the People by &s;u|perior
Excellencies, whether of the Mind or
Body, were they unerringly prompted by Na|ture
to exerci&s;e their Power for the Welfare
of the Society, blind Obedience to their Will
would be a Virtue. But when we tru&s;t with
&s;overeign Power one of the common Stamp
of Mankind, who has by Nature no Marks
of Royalty, and who perhaps by Nature is
not fitted for Command, the Ab&s;urdity is
great, to maintain, That this Per&s;on ought to
be under no Controul, and that we ought to
<PB N="199" REF="200">
continue to tru&s;t him, after repeated In&s;tances
of his betraying the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>I HAVE no Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider whether
Conque&s;t be a good Title by the Law of
Nature, to acquire the ab&s;olute Dominion of
a State, as in <HI>Turky,</HI> where the Grand Sig|nior
is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Lord of the Man|nor,
and all the People his Slaves. This is
not Government, the Characteri&s;tic of which
is, Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in one for the Good of the
whole. It is like a private E&s;tate, which
may be di&s;po&s;ed of by the Proprietor with|out
Controul, and applied for his own Pur|po&s;es.
It cannot be pretended that the King
of <HI>Britain</HI> has his Right by Conque&s;t; and
therefore no Support can be drawn to the
Argument from that Quarter.</P>
<P>THE Scheme, it mu&s;t be yeilded, is &s;o far
con&s;i&s;tent, that if we &s;uppo&s;e the King's Right
to be indefea&s;ible, and that he cannot be de|prived
of his Authority, however much his
Mea&s;ures &s;werve from the Rules of good Go|vernment
<PB N="200" REF="201">
it mu&s;t follow, that the People
are tied to pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-re|&s;i&s;tance,
as there is no <HI>Medium</HI> betwixt Re|&s;i&s;tance
and Obedience. But where is the
Foundation of the indefea&s;ible Right of the
King, more than of any other Officer of the
State? Does it lie in the Name? One &s;hould
&s;carce think &s;o, when the Name is indiffe|rently
applied to Governors who have very
little Power, as well as to tho&s;e who&s;e Power
is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive. It cannot ly in the
Nature of the Office, which being a Tru&s;t, is
undoubtedly forfeitable upon Mal-admini&s;tra|tion.
It will perhaps be &s;aid to ly in the
Con&s;titution of our Government. So far
from it, that no Man is bound to obey the
King's Commands, unle&s;s delivered in a cer|tain
Form pre&s;cribed by Law. And even in
<HI>France,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing it an ab&s;olute Monarchy,
without any con&s;titutional Check upon the
King's Actions, the King's Power is notwith|&s;tanding
limited. There cannot be &s;uch a
Thing in Nature, as for a People voluntarily
to &s;urrender their Liberties to the arbitrary
<PB N="201" REF="202">
Will of any Man. The Act would be void
as incon&s;i&s;tent with the great Law of Nature,
<HI>&s;alus populi &s;uprema lex.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Favourers of this Doctrine, when
beat out of the&s;e Entrenchments, have a Re|treat,
which they &s;uppo&s;e impregnable. They
allow at la&s;t that the King may do wrong, by
betraying the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. But
then they maintain, that a King having no
Superior on Earth, can have no proper Judge
of his Actions but God alone, from whom
his Power flows; and therefore is accoun|table
to the Almighty only. This is a For|tre&s;s
built upon Sand. All Power no doubt
is from God, natural and legal; for he is the
Creator and Upholder of all Things. But
it follows from this, in&s;tead of being contra|dictory
to it, that every Sort of Power is li|mited
by the Oppo&s;ition of other Powers,
natural or legal, which are equally from God
with the Power re&s;i&s;ted. Perhaps they mean
that every King has his Commi&s;&s;ion from the
Almighty, and not from the People. Hi|&s;tory
<PB N="202" REF="203">
alone may &s;uffice to inform us, that this
cannot be, when there have exi&s;ted &s;o many
Kings unworthy of Command. But &s;uppo|&s;ing
the Fact, it does not follow, that this
Commi&s;&s;ion is unlimited. On the contrary,
it mu&s;t be limited; for who can patronize
&s;o impious a Doctrine as that God &s;hould
give a direct Commi&s;&s;ion to any Being to
plague and per&s;ecute Mankind, unle&s;s for
their Sins? The Voice of Nature is the
Voice of God; and it is a fixed Principle in
the Law of Nature, that where there is no
common Judge to appeal to, the Party inju|red
may do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice. The Laws are
&s;uperior to the King, and the&s;e he mu&s;t be
judged by. And &s;uppo&s;ing an ab&s;olute Go|vernment
in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, where the
King's Will is Law, yet there is always one
Law above him. If his Actions generally
tend to De&s;truction, in&s;tead of Government,
the People, who have no Judge to appeal to,
may lawfully do them&s;elves Right. <HI>Salus
populi e&s;t &s;uprema lex.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">
BUT after all, where is the Nece&s;&s;ity of
God's extraordinary Interpo&s;ition, by grant|ing
his immediate Commi&s;&s;ion to Kings,
when in other Matters he chu&s;es to govern
the World by &s;econd Cau&s;es and ordinary
Means. Why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e, that Man|kind
are deprived of their natural Privilege
of chu&s;ing their fir&s;t Magi&s;trate, more than
of chu&s;ing tho&s;e that are &s;ubordinate? Where
is this Commi&s;&s;ion recorded? Is it given to
all Rulers who have the Name of <HI>King,</HI> or
are &s;ome Nations peculiarly honoured? Is it
given to all Sovereigns in general, whether
honoured with the Name of <HI>King</HI> or not?
Had all the Crown-Va&s;&s;als in <HI>France,</HI> Dukes,
Earls, Barons, this Commi&s;&s;ion, who u&s;urped,
and, for many Ages, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a Sort of Sove|reignty
within their own Territories? The&s;e
are puzzling Que&s;tions, and it would require
a mo&s;t expre&s;s Revelation to put an End to
the Doubts that ari&s;e from them. The le|gi&s;lative
Power one &s;hould imagine is of a
&s;uperior Rank to that of the King, becau&s;e
it gives Laws to the King; yet no peculiar
<PB N="204" REF="205">
Interpo&s;ition of Providence is pretended in
its Behalf. This Body is left to be model|led
by Choice or by Accident. The Govern|ment
of the World is after this Manner car|ried
on; and yet nothing happens, we may
pre&s;ume, contradictory to the original Plan of
Providence: Why then a peculiar Providence
in Behalf of Kings, or an immediate Revela|tion,
when there appears to be no Nece&s;&s;i|ty?
We cannot, without Impiety, admit of
the Suppo&s;ition, when, &s;o far as weak Man
can conjecture about the Operations of the
Almighty, he never interpo&s;es by extraordina|ry
Means, unle&s;s where the ordinary Di&s;pen|&s;ations
of Providence prove in&s;ufficient to an|&s;wer
his Purpo&s;es: We may therefore con|clude,
with the highe&s;t Degree of A&s;&s;u|ance,
that Kings have no other Commi&s;&s;i|on
from God, but what every Magi&s;trate
has, &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate, who is legal|ly
elected according to the &s;tanding Laws of
the Society to which he belongs.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="206">
BUT Doubts and Difficulties multiply up|on
us. Were all the Nations pointed out by
an expre&s;s Revelation, who, like the <HI>Jews</HI> of
old, are to be governed by Magi&s;trates of
God's expre&s;s Appointment. Were all the
Families pointed out who are to bear his
Commi&s;&s;ion, the Revelation would &s;till be
imperfect. It is not enough to point out the
Family; the Rules of Succe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t al&s;o be
a&s;certained, that there be no Di&s;pute about
the particular Per&s;ons who are to enjoy this
Hereditary-indefea&s;ible Right. Here, without
a new Revelation, we are left in a great Mea|&s;ure
at an Uncertainty; for are we to follow
the Rules of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France?</HI> Are we to
be guided by the Law as at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h|ed,
or as it was three Centuries ago? What|ever
Rules are followed, we mu&s;t &s;ee that they
are in a great Mea&s;ure arbitrary, the Offspring
of Accident, or of the &s;lendere&s;t Feelings of
the Imagination, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by Cu&s;tom
only. Has not this a &s;trong Appearance of
leaving to every Nation the Choice of their
own chief Magi&s;trates? Kings were at fir&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="207">
generally cho&s;en for Life. It crept into Prac|tice
to make all publick Offices hereditary;
and &s;o the &s;overeign Power has generally
come to be hereditary, partly from the Bent
of the People and partly to avoid the Incon|veniencies
which elective Monarchy is &s;ub|jected
to. But after what Manner is this he|reditary
Right of Kings carried on? Not by a|ny
univer&s;al Law, expre&s;ly revealed or wrought
into the Nature of Man; &s;o far from it, that
the Rules of Succe&s;&s;ion are different in every
different Country, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Cu&s;tom a|lone,
or, in other Words, by the Con&s;ent of
the People. In <HI>France,</HI> for Example, the Fe|males
are totally excluded. Have Females
by the Appointment of the Almighty this in|defea&s;ible
Right of Succe&s;&s;ion? If they have,
<HI>France</HI> for many Ages have been in a damn|able
Error. If not, the Load of the Guilt
mu&s;t ly upon <HI>England,</HI> and upon many other
Countries who admit of Female Succe&s;&s;ion.
In my Apprehen&s;ion, this Con&s;equence can|not
be evaded, otherways than by fairly ac|knowledging,
that God in this Matter, as
<PB N="207" REF="208">
well as in others, works by &s;econd Cau&s;es
without any direct Interpo&s;ition, leaving eve|ry
Nation to be governed by Laws of their
own Appointment. And indeed nothing looks
liker a Contradiction, than to &s;uppo&s;e, that
hereditary Monarchy is the Appointment of
the Almighty, and that he has be&s;towed upon
every Heir an indefea&s;ible Right, not to be
di&s;pen&s;ed with upon any Occa&s;ion whatever,
without pointing out, by infallible Marks,
the Per&s;ons who are to enjoy this extraordi|nary
Privilege; commanding us, under the
Pain of Damnation, to give entire Submi&s;&s;ion
to Per&s;ons, as Rulers appointed by him, with|out
reyealing who the&s;e Per&s;ons are.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Inference may be drawn from
this Doubtfulne&s;s of the Law of Succe&s;&s;ion.
It is a &s;elf-evident Propo&s;ition, that no Right
can be &s;tronger, than the Title upon which
it is founded. No Title is more &s;lender, in
mo&s;t In&s;tances, than that of Succe&s;&s;ion. How
then can it be maintained, that the hereditary
Right of Kings is indefea&s;ible, when the Title
<PB N="208" REF="209">
upon which the Right is founded is &s;o weak
and &s;o arbitrary. I think we may with Cer|tainty
conclude, that &s;uch a Right mu&s;t, upon
every Occa&s;ion, give Place to the primary
Rights of Nature, &s;uch as tend to our Pre|&s;ervation
and Well-being: And therefore that
any particular Heir may be &s;afely &s;et a&s;ide,
when he becomes dangerous to the Society.
For this is a&s;&s;uredly the Voice of God, That
in every Conflict the weaker Right mu&s;t yield
to the &s;tronger. Nay, we may go one Step
further, that if the Good of the Society can
be more promoted by a different Form of Go|vernment,
hereditary Right may be laid a&s;ide
altogether without any Crime; &s;ince the Good
of the Society is an Object of much greater
Importance than the Right of any particular
Family can be.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the Family of <HI>Stewart,</HI> no
Right has a le&s;s Air of Divine Authority, than
what they had to the Crown of <HI>Britain.</HI> To
look no further back than to the Competition
betwixt <HI>Bruce</HI> and <HI>Baliol,</HI> which, in the&s;e
<PB N="209" REF="210">
Days, appeared, and truly was an intricate
Affair: Was <HI>Baliol</HI> a King by Divine Ap|pointment,
when he was acknowledged and
&s;ubmitted to, in con&s;equence of an Award
given by <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> who plainly
manife&s;ted, by the whole Cour&s;e of his Pro|ceedings,
that he was more &s;wayed by politi|cal
Con&s;iderations, than by Ju&s;tice and Equi|ty?
Unhappy is the Condition of that People,
who, under the Pain of Damnation, mu&s;t
yield pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-re&s;i&s;tance to
a Monarch, and yet have no better Authority
to direct their Duty, than &s;uch an Award.
It will be &s;aid, that the Merits of the Cau&s;e
were with <HI>Baliol.</HI> But how the Patrons of
the Divine Right of Kings &s;hould come to a
Certainty in this Matter, I'm at a Lo&s;s to
under&s;tand. For not to mention the Preten|&s;ions
of his Competitor <HI>Bruce,</HI> it is perhaps
not extremely clear, that a Female has any
Divine Right to a Crown; at lea&s;t, there is
no In&s;tance of this among&s;t the <HI>Jews.</HI> And
if Females are admitted, I cannot &s;ee why the
Kingdom ought not to be &s;plit among&s;t Fe|male
<PB N="210" REF="211">
Heirs, as well as a private E&s;tate. If
Right to a Crown be con&s;idered as a Matter
of Property, there certainly ought to be no
Difference. But laying a&s;ide all Difficulties,
and &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Baliol</HI>'s Right of Primogeni|ture
to be invincibly good, 'tis plain <HI>Robert
Bruce</HI> could have no Divine Right, nor can
the <HI>Stewart</HI>'s have a Divine Right who de|rive
their Right from him. It is but a mean
Subterfuge, That none of <HI>Baliol</HI>'s Race ap|pear
to claim the Crown. Will it be &s;aid, that
this Nation continued in an ob&s;tinate Cour&s;e
of Rebellion again&s;t the King of Heaven, &s;o
long as any of <HI>Baliol's</HI> Race exi&s;ted? How
do we know they do not at pre&s;ent exi&s;t? It
is our indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to &s;earch for the King
whom God has given us, thro' every Corner
of the Earth. And 'tis equally our Duty to
refu&s;e our Obedience to an U&s;urper; and he
mu&s;t be &s;o, who has not a hereditary Right,
and con&s;equently, is not of God's Appoint|ment.
Let us keep in View that Pre&s;cripti|on,
po&s;itive or negative, can avail nothing,
<PB N="211" REF="212">
which has no other Foundation but univer&s;al
Con&s;ent, implied from a long Acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P>THE A&s;&s;erters of this Divine Right dare
not yield, that <HI>Baliol</HI> forfeited the Crown of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> by acknowledging him&s;elf to be the
King of <HI>England</HI>'s Va&s;&s;al; for this would be
ju&s;tifying the late Revolution in every Point.
Making an independent Kingdom a Fief of
another Sovereignty, is not more &s;ubver&s;ive
of the Con&s;titution, than the Mea&s;ures are,
which were pur&s;ued by <HI>James</HI> VII. during
the whole Cour&s;e of his Reign. And if the
People of <HI>Scotland</HI> could lawfully judge, that
<HI>Baliol</HI> had &s;ubverted the Con&s;titution, and
upon that Judgment transfer the Crown to
another; the People of <HI>Britain</HI> had the &s;ame
Title to give Judgment again&s;t <HI>James</HI> VII.
and to declare that he had forfeited the Crown.</P>
<P>WITH regard to <HI>England,</HI> the Pretext of
a Divine Right is &s;till more lame, if po&s;&s;ible.
<HI>William</HI> the Conqueror was a Ba&s;tard, and
could have no Divine Right to the Dukedom
<PB N="212" REF="213">
of <HI>Normandy;</HI> nor did he him&s;elf pretend any
other Right to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> than
by the Te&s;tament of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or.
But &s;uppo&s;ing him to have conquered <HI>England,</HI>
which will not be readily yielded, he certain|ly
did not conquer his <HI>Norman</HI> Subjects who
came over with him to <HI>England,</HI> and from
whom, for ought we know, a great Part of
the Nation are de&s;cended. The <HI>Stewarts</HI>
therefore who have no other Claim to the
Crown of <HI>England,</HI> but by a Female Con|nection
with the Race of <HI>William</HI> the Con|queror,
cannot, with any Shadow of Rea&s;on,
in&s;i&s;t upon their beloved Doctrine of a Divine
Right, &s;o far as concerns the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who
are of <HI>Norman</HI> Extraction.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, &s;uppo&s;ing the heredita|ry
Right of Kings to be the Appointment of
God, indefea&s;ible and indi&s;pen&s;able, the fol|lowing
Points ought to be a&s;certained; <HI>1mo,</HI>
Whether this Law be univer&s;al, to take Place
over the whole Earth, or if it be limited to
certain Nations, and what the&s;e Nations are.
<PB N="213" REF="214">
<HI>2do,</HI> To what particular Families does this
Divine Right belong, who are thus made &s;u|perior
to the re&s;t of Mankind. <HI>3tio,</HI> The
Rules of Succe&s;&s;ion, which concern the&s;e
particular Families, ought to be di&s;tinct and
per&s;picuous, &s;o as to procure a perfect A|greement
among&s;t Mankind, as about the
primary Laws of Nature. <HI>4to,</HI> The&s;e Rules
ought to be wrought into our Nature, and
the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of them attended with the
&s;tronge&s;t Sen&s;e of Immorality, like Treach|ery
or Murder. Were the&s;e Points thorough|ly
cleared, the Scheme might be con&s;i&s;tent.
But as it &s;tands, it is attended with Doubts
and Darkne&s;s, to lead every hone&s;t Heart
who e&s;pou&s;es it, into endle&s;s Perplexities.</P>
<P>MODERN Hi&s;tories are full of the Evils
occa&s;ioned by di&s;puted Succe&s;&s;ions; they are
&s;till fuller of the Evils occa&s;ioned by Conte&s;ts
about the King's Prerogative. There can
be no Moderation in &s;uch Controver&s;ies,
where God Almighty is made a Party, and e|very
Per&s;on called <HI>impious</HI> who takes the op|po&s;ite
<PB N="214" REF="215">
Side. Hereby it comes, that this Doc|trine
of the hereditary indefea&s;ible Right of
Kings &s;eldom fails to break the Peace of So|ciety,
to fo&s;ter inveterate Enmities, and to
be the Source of endle&s;s Wars; of which,
were there no other Evidence, the pre&s;ent
Times afford a deplorable In&s;tance. So that,
if we are to give any Parent to this Doctrine,
other than blind Enthu&s;ia&s;m, we can never
a&s;cribe it to a good Being. And indeed if
there is an invi&s;ible Power, a greater Enemy
to Mankind than another, he could not po&s;|&s;ibly
in&s;till into us a more poi&s;onous Prin|ciple.
Plague and Famine are nothing to it.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' I have been de&s;ervedly &s;evere up|on
the Doctrine, I would not be under&s;tood to
pa&s;s the &s;ame Cen&s;ure upon its Votaries. I am
&s;en&s;ible the further removed a Tenet is from
Truth, the Difficulty of Conver&s;ion, is propor|tionally
great. 'Tis like Love be&s;towed upon
an ugly Woman, which is ob&s;erved to be ever
without Bounds. The <HI>Jacobites,</HI> &s;uch as are
not of a de&s;perate Fortune, certainly de&s;erve
<PB N="215" REF="216">
Compa&s;&s;ion, even while they are laying wa&s;te
their Country by inte&s;tine Commotions. They
can have no other Motive but Principle, when
they venture their Lives and Fortunes in the
Service of their Idol Prince, as their Pro&s;pect
of Succe&s;s can never balance the Hazard.
What Pity is it they were not employed in
a better Cau&s;e. But if nothing el&s;e will o|pen
their Eyes, ought it not to have &s;ome
Weight, that there is nothing more repug|nant
to the Laws which mu&s;t govern all So|cieties,
than for any &s;ingle Man, or Set of
Men, to force their Opinion upon the Ma|jority.
How would they reli&s;h the Behavi|our
of a Member of their own Parliament,
who &s;hould endeavour by Force of Arms to
oblige the whole Body to &s;ubmit to his Sen|timent?
Or how would they reli&s;h it, that
a Body of Men &s;hould ri&s;e in Arms upon no
better Pretext, than the procuring Ju&s;tice to
a Friend whom they &s;uppo&s;e to be unju&s;tly
condemned by the whole Body of Judges?
Is it not an Excu&s;e commonly given by <HI>Ban|ditti,</HI>
for robbing on the Highway, that they
<PB N="216" REF="217">
are but making Repri&s;als upon Account of
Goods unju&s;tly wre&s;ted from them by Au|thority
of Law: Yet this is preci&s;ely the
pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. The late King <HI>James</HI> was &s;et
a&s;ide by the &s;overeign Authority of the
Nation, that is, by the Act of the Majo|rity,
who, from the very Nature of Society,
mu&s;t be the ultimate Judges, in all Matters
which concern their Pre&s;ervation and Well-being.
Perhaps he was unju&s;tly condemned.
Be it &s;o for Argument's Sake. But an ulti|mate
Judgement mu&s;t ly &s;omewhere, with|out
further Appeal. It mu&s;t be a fundamen|tal
Law in all Societies to acquie&s;ce in this
ultimate Judgment, right or wrong, without
which Concord cannot be pre&s;erved, but for
a Moment. No hone&s;t Remedy after this can
remain, but to de&s;ert the Society and to join
&s;ome other, where the Rules of Ju&s;tice are &s;up|po&s;ed
to be better ob&s;erved. Can it be thought
that the Right of any Man in a Society, &s;up|po&s;ing
him to be a chief Magi&s;trate, tru&s;ted
with the greate&s;t Powers, is &s;uperior to the
fundamental Laws of the Society, whence
<PB N="217" REF="218">
he derives this Right? It is an Ab&s;urdity, the
&s;ame, as, that a Part is greater than the whole.
It were to be wi&s;hed, that Gentlemen would
&s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider this Matter, who are &s;o &s;tre|nuous
for the Claim of an abdicated King,
and who would embroil Heaven and Earth
to compa&s;s the Re&s;toration of the Family.
And would they but allow them&s;elves to think,
with any Degree of Coolne&s;s, they would &s;oon
be convinced, That the Peace of Society is an
Object of greater Importance than the Right
of any particular Man can be, &s;uppo&s;ing him
to be de&s;cended from a thou&s;and Kings.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE of &s;ome Things omitted in the E&s;&s;ay
upon Honour and Dignity.</HEAD>
<P>THERE appears upon the Records a
Form of creating Peers, different from
any mentioned. One remarkable In&s;tance,
is an Act of the 7th Parliament, <HI>James</HI> VI.
<HI>anno</HI> 1581, bearing, That the Lands of <HI>Doun,</HI>
&amp;c. were feued by Queen <HI>Mary</HI> to Sir <HI>James
Stewart</HI> of <HI>Doun</HI> Knight, his Heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ub|&s;uming,
that the &s;aid Sir <HI>James</HI> being de&s;cen|ded
of the Royal Blood, &startq;therefore his High|ne&s;s,
with Advice of his three E&s;tates, e|rects,
creates, unites, annexes and incorpo|rates
all and &s;undry the fore&s;aid Lands, Of|fices,
and other Particulars above written,
in an <HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI> to be called in all Time
coming the Lord&s;hip of <HI>Doun,</HI> decerning
and ordaining the &s;aid Sir <HI>James,</HI> his Heirs
and Succe&s;&s;ors, &s;pecified in the Infeftment,
in all Time coming, to be called and intitu|led
<HI>Lords of</HI> Doun, who &s;hall have the Ho|nour,
Dignity, Place and Preheminence of
a Lord of our &s;overeign Lord's Parliament,
<PB REF="220">
in all Parliaments, A&s;&s;emblies, and other
Conventions, with his Arms effeiring there|to;
and giving unto him all Honours, Dig|nities
and Preheminencies which pertained,
or of Right and Con&s;uetude ought to per|tain,
to a Lord of Parliament.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS Form, 'tis pre&s;umed, has been in|troduced,
in Imitation of the old Form of
creating an Earl, by erecting his Lands into
a County. And hence the De&s;ign and U&s;e of
erecting Lands into a <HI>Dominium</HI> or Lord&s;hip.
Patents in the above Form are doubtle&s;s of the
King's Grant, as well as other Patents. This,
in favours of Lord <HI>Doun,</HI> has been done in
Parliament for the greater Solemnity, the King
being at that Time under Age.</P>
