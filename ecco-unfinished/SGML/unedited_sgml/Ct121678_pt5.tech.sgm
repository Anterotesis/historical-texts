<P>THERE is no animal, &s;o generally known
at lea&s;t as the bear, concerning which the
writers of natural hi&s;tory have differed &s;o much.
Their uncertainties, and even contradictions, with
regard to the nature and manners of this animal,
&s;eem to have proceeded from their not di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
properly the different &s;pecies; and, of
cour&s;e, they &s;ometimes a&s;cribe to one the pro|perties
of another. In the fir&s;t place, the land-bear
mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;ea-bear, the
latter being commonly called the <HI>white bear,</HI> or
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<HI>bear of the frozen &s;ea.</HI> The&s;e two animals are
very different, both in the form of their bodies,
and in their natural di&s;po&s;itions. The land-bears
mu&s;t again be di&s;tingui&s;hed into the <HI>brown</HI> and
the <HI>black</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Under the denomination of the Brown Bears, I compre|hend tho&s;e which are brown, yellow, red, or reddi&s;h; and un|der <HI>black,</HI> all the &s;nades of that colour.</NOTE>; becau&s;e, having neither the &s;ame in|clinations,
nor the &s;ame natural appetites, they
cannot be regarded as varieties only of one and
the &s;ame &s;pecies. Be&s;ides, &s;ome land-bears are
white, and, though re&s;embling in colour the &s;ea-bear,
they differ from it, in every other particular,
as much as the other bears. The&s;e white land-bears
are found in Great Tartary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See relation de la Grande Tartarie, p. 8.</NOTE>, in Mu&s;covy,
in Lithuania, and in other northern regions.
They are not rendered white during winter by
the rigour of the climate, like the ermines, or the
hares; but are brought forth white, and remain
white in all &s;ea&s;ons. They ought, therefore, to
be con&s;idered as a fourth &s;pecies, if we found not
al&s;o bears with their hair con&s;i&s;ting of a mixture
of brown and white, which indicates an inter|mediate
race between the white land-bear and
the brown or black bear; con&s;equently the white
land-bear is only a variety of one or other of the&s;e
&s;pecies.</P>
<P>The brown bear is very common in the Alps;
but the black bear is extremely rare. The latter,
on the contrary, abounds in the fore&s;ts of the
<PB N="3" REF="10">
northern regions of Europe and America. The
brown bear is ferocious and carnivorous; but
the black bear is only wild, and uniformly refu&s;es
to eat fle&s;h. Of this we cannot give a more di|&s;tinct
and recent te&s;timony than that of M. du
Pratz, in his hi&s;tory of Loui&s;iana<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Tom. 2. p, 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&startq;The black bear,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;appears in Lui&s;ia|na
during the winter; becau&s;e the &s;nows which
cover the northern countries prevent him from
finding &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment. He lives upon
fruits, acorns, and roots; but he is peculiarly fond
of honey and milk; and, when he meets with
any of the&s;e articles, he will rather die than quit
them. Notwith&s;tanding the common prejudice,
I affirm, and in this a&s;&s;ertion I am &s;upported by
all the inhabitants of this province, and of the
neighbouring countries, that he is not a carnivo|rous
animal. Though numerous, and often pre&s;|&s;ed
by extreme hunger, they never devour men,
nor eat even butcher-meat, when they fall in
with it. During the time I lived among the
Natches, a &s;evere winter in the northern regions
made the bears de&s;cend in va&s;t quantities. They
were &s;o numerous, that they &s;tarved each other,
and were very meagre. Famine made them come
out of the woods which border on the river. We
&s;aw them, during the night, run into hou&s;es and
court-yards, which were not properly &s;hut, where
they found meat expo&s;ed; but they never touch|ed
it, and eat only what grains they could pick
<PB N="4" REF="11">
up. On an occa&s;ion &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, they mu&s;t in|fallibly
have di&s;covered their carnivorous di&s;po|&s;ition,
if they had an appetite of this nature.
They never kill animals to devour them; and, if
they were carnivorous, they would not abandon
countries covered with &s;now, where they could
find men and animals at will, in order to &s;earch
for fruits and roots, a &s;pecies of food rejected by
the carnivorous tribes.&endq; M. du Pratz adds, in a
note, that, &s;ince writing the above article, he had
learned with certainty, that, in the mountains of
Savoy, there are two kinds of bears, the one
black, like tho&s;e of Loui&s;iana, and not carnivo|rous;
the other red, and equally carnivorous as
the wolves. The Baron de Hontan remarks<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Tom, 1. p. 86.</NOTE>,
that the bears of Canada are very black, but by
no means dangerous; and that they never attack
men, unle&s;s when &s;hot at and wounded. He far|ther
ob&s;erves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tom&punc; 2. p. 40.</NOTE>, that the reddi&s;h bears are ex|tremely
mi&s;chievous, and boldly attack the hun|ters;
but that the black bears uniformly fly from
men.</P>
<P>Wormius<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mu&s;. Worm. p. 318.</NOTE> informs us, that there are three
kinds of bears in Norway: The fir&s;t (<HI>bre&s;&s;diur</HI>)
is very large, not altogether black, but browni&s;h,
and not &s;o de&s;tructive as the other kinds, living
only on herbs and the leaves of trees: The &s;e|cond
(<HI>ildgier&s;duir</HI>) is &s;maller, blacker, and carni|vorous,
often attacking hor&s;es and other animals,
<PB N="5" REF="12">
e&s;pecially in autumn: The third (<HI>myrebiorn</HI>) is
&s;till &s;maller, but fails not to be noxious. He is
&s;aid to feed upon ants, and delights in overturn|ing
their hillocks. It has been remarked, (he
adds, without proof), that the&s;e three kinds mix,
and produce intermediate &s;pecies; that the car|nivorous
kind attacks the flocks, kills every crea|ture,
like the wolf, and devours only one or two;
that, though carnivorous, they eat wild fruits;
and, when the fruit of the &s;ervice-tree abounds,
they become more dangerous, becau&s;e this $our
fruit &s;ets their teeth &s;o much on edge, that no|thing
but blood or grea&s;e can remove this malady,
which prevents them from eating with ea&s;e. But
mo&s;t of the&s;e facts related by Wormius appear to
be extremely equivocal; for we have no ex|amples
of animals, with appetites &s;o uniformly
different as tho&s;e of the two fir&s;t &s;pecies, the one
living only on herbs and the leaves of trees, and
the other on fle&s;h and blood, intermixing and
producing intermediate &s;pecies. Be&s;ides, he makes
the black bears carnivorous, and the brown frugi|vorous,
which is ab&s;olutely repugnant to truth. Add
to this, that P. Rzaczyn&s;ki<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Auctuar. hi&s;t. nat. p. 32.</NOTE>, a Poli&s;h writer, and
M. Klein of Dantzick<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De Quadrup. p. 82.</NOTE>, in de&s;cribing the bears of
their country, mention only two &s;pecies, the
black, and the brown or red; and, of the latter,
they &s;peak of a larger and le&s;&s;er kind. They re|mark,
that the black bears are more rare; that the
<PB N="6" REF="13">
brown, on the contrary, are very common; that
the black bears are the large&s;t, and feed upon ants;
and, la&s;tly, that the red or brown kind are the
mo&s;t carnivorous and de&s;tructive. The&s;e proofs,
added to tho&s;e of M. du Pratz and of the Baron
de la Hontan, are perfectly oppo&s;ite to what
Wormius advances. In a word, it appears to be
certain, that the red or brown bears, who are
found not only in Savoy, but in the high moun|tains,
in the va&s;t fore&s;ts, and in almo&s;t every de|&s;ert
of the earth, devour live animals, and even
the mo&s;t putrid carca&s;&s;es. The black bears in|habit
not very cold countries; but we find the
brown or red bears in the frozen, the temperate,
and even in the &s;outhern regions. They were
common in Greece; and the Romans brought
them from Lybia<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Herodot. Solin. Crinit. et alii. Quod freno Lybici doman|tur ur&s;i, &s;ays <HI>Martial.</HI></NOTE>, to be exhibited at their pu|blic
&s;pectacles. They are found in China<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. generale des voyages, par M&punc; l'Abb&eacute; Prevo&s;t, tom. 3. p. 492. Hi&s;t. nat. du Japan, par Koempfer, tom. 1. p. 109.</NOTE>, in
Japan<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strabo, lib. 16. Pro&s;p. Alpin. p. 233.</NOTE>, in Arabia, in Egypt, and as far as the
i&s;land of Java<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Voyage autour du monde de le Gentil, tom. 3. p. 85.</NOTE>. Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;tot. de admir. cap. 140. Idem de gen, animal. lib. 5. cap. 6.</NOTE> likewi&s;e mentions
white land-bears, and con&s;iders this difference of
colour as accidental, and proceeding from a de|fect
in generation. Thus bears are found in all
de&s;ert, rude, and woody countries. But they
<PB N="7" REF="14">
never appear in populous nations, nor in open
and cultivated regions. There are none in
France or in Britain, except, perhaps, a few in
the mo&s;t unfrequented mountains.</P>
<P>The bear is not only a &s;avage, but a &s;olitary
animal. He flies from all &s;ociety, avoiding every
place to which man can have acce&s;s, and is only
ea&s;y where Nature appears in her rude&s;t and mo&s;t
antient form. An old cavern among inacce&s;&s;ible
rocks, or a grotto, formed by time in the trunk
of a decayed tree, in the mid&s;t of a thick fore&s;t,
&s;erve him for an habitation. Thither he retires
alone, and pa&s;&s;es part of the winter without pro|vi&s;ions,
and goes not out of it for &s;everal weeks.
However, he is neither torpid, nor deprived of
feeling, like the dormou&s;e and marmot; but, as
he is exce&s;&s;ively fat about the end of autumn,
which is the time he retires, this abundance of
grea&s;e enables him to endure ab&s;tinence; and he
departs not from his den till he is almo&s;t fami&s;h|ed.
It is alledged, that the males leave not their
retreats for forty days<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;tot&punc; hi&s;t. anim. lib. 8. cap. 17.</NOTE>; but that the females
continue four months, becau&s;e it is there that they
bring forth their young. It is difficult to believe
that they &s;hould not only &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but nouri&s;h
their young, without taking food for &s;o long a
period. I allow, that, when pregnant, they are
prodigiou&s;ly fat, and that, being clothed with
very thick hair, &s;leeping the greate&s;t part of the
time, and remaining without motion, they mu&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="15">
lo&s;e little by per&s;piration. But, if it be true, that
the males, pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, go out in forty
days, it is not natural to think, that the females,
after bringing forth and &s;uckling their young,
&s;hould feel le&s;s the want of food, unle&s;s we &s;up|po&s;e
them to devour &s;ome of their offspring, to|gether
with the membranes, &amp;c. which is not
probable, notwith&s;tanding the example of the
cats, who &s;ometimes eat their young. Be&s;ides,
I am here talking of the brown &s;pecies only, the
males of which devour the new-born cubs,
when they di&s;cover them in their dens. The fe|males,
on the contrary, &s;eem to love their offspring
with an a&s;toni&s;hing ardour: After they bring
forth, they are more ferocious and more dange|rous
than the males. They fight, and expo&s;e
them&s;elves to every peril, in order to &s;ave their
young, who are not unformed for &s;ome time af|ter
birth, as the antients alledged, but grow near|ly
as quick as other animals. They are perfectly
formed in the womb of the mother<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In mu$eo illu&s;t. &s;enatus Bononien&s;is ur&s;ulum a cae&s;o ma|tris $tero ext$$ctum, et omnibus &s;uis partibus formatum, in va$$ $word$ adhuc &s;ervamus; <HI>Aldrov. de quadrup. p.</HI> 120.</NOTE>; and, if the
foetus, or young cub, &s;eems, at the fir&s;t glance, to
be ill formed, it is only becau&s;e the old bear her|&s;elf,
upon the whole, is an animal gro&s;s and di&s;|proportioned;
and we know, that, in every &s;pe|cies,
the foetus, or new-born animal, is more di&s;|proportioned
than the adult.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="16">
Autumn, with the bears, is the &s;ea&s;on of love:
The female is &s;aid to be more ardent than the
male. It is alledged, that &s;he lies on her back to re|ceive
him, that &s;he embraces him clo&s;ely, and keeps
him fa&s;t for a long time, &amp;c. But it is certain that
they copulate like other quadrupeds. Captive
bears have been &s;een coupling, and have been im|pregnated.
But, how long the females go with
young, has not been &s;o accurately marked as could
be wi&s;hed. Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. hi&s;t. animal. lib. 6. cap. 30.</NOTE> has &s;aid, that they go with
young 30 days only. As no body has contradicted
this fact, and as we are not in a condition to verify
it, we, of cour&s;e, can neither affirm nor deny with
regard to this matter. We &s;hall only remark,
that it appears to be doubtful: 1. Becau&s;e the
bear is a large animal; and, in proportion to the
&s;ize of animals, they require the longer time to
be formed in the womb: 2. Becau&s;e the young
bears grow very &s;lowly; they follow their mo|ther,
and require her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for a year or two:
3. Becau&s;e the female produces but one, two,
three, or four, and never more than five; a pro|perty
common to all large animals, who produce
but few young, and carry them long: 4. Becau&s;e
the bear lives 20 or 25 years, and the time of
ge&s;tation and that of growth are generally propor|tioned
to the duration of life. From the&s;e analo|gies,
I am inclined to believe that the bear goes
with young at lea&s;t &s;everal months. Whatever be
in this, the mother takes the greate&s;t care of her
<PB N="10" REF="17">
young. She prepares for them a bed of mo&s;s
and herbs in the bottom of her cavern, and
&s;uckles them till they are able to go abroad with
her. She brings forth in winter, and the cubs
begin to follow her in the &s;pring. The male and
female live not together; but each has a &s;eparate
and a di&s;tant retreat. When they cannot find a
cavern for a den, to make a lodging, they break
and collect branches of trees, which they &s;o cover
with herbs and leaves as to render them impene|trable
by water.</P>
<P>The voice of the bear is a deep murmuring,
often accompanied with a grinding of the teeth,
e&s;pecially when irritated. He is very &s;u&s;cepti|ble
of anger, which is always furious, and oft|en
capricious. Though, when tamed, he ap|pears
mild and even obedient to his ma&s;ter, he
&s;hould always be treated with diffidence and cir|cum&s;pection;
and we &s;hould be particularly care|ful
not to &s;trike him on the no&s;e, or on the parts
of generation. He may be taught to walk on
end, to dance, and to perform various ge&s;ticula|tions.
He &s;eems even to li&s;ten to mu&s;ic, and to
ob&s;erve &s;ome kind of mea&s;ure. But, to give him
this &s;pecies of education, he mu&s;t be taken young,
and con&s;trained during life. An old bear cannot
be tamed, nor will he &s;uffer re&s;traint. He is na|turally
intrepid, or, at lea&s;t, indifferent to danger.
The wild bear never turns out of his road, nor
flies from the a&s;pect of man. It is alledged, how|ever,
<PB N="11" REF="18">
that the &s;ound of a whi&s;tle<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 37.</NOTE> &s;urpri&s;es and
confounds him to &s;uch a degree, that he ri&s;es on
his hind-feet. This is the time for &s;hooting, and
endeavouring to kill him; for, if he be only
wounded, he attacks the hunt&s;man with fury,
embraces him with his fore-feet, and &s;uffocates
him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. Hi&s;t. de la Loui&s;iane par M. du Pratz, tom. 2. p. 81.</NOTE>, if not timely a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Bears are hunted in different manners. In
Sweden, Norway, Poland, &amp;c. the lea&s;t dange|rous
mode, it is &s;aid<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Regnard, tom. 1. p. 53.</NOTE>, is to intoxicate them by
throwing ardent &s;pirits on honey, of which they
are fond, and &s;earch for it in the trunks of trees.
In Loui&s;iana and Canada, where the black bears
are common, and where they live not in caverns,
but in decayed trees, they are taken by &s;etting
their habitations on fire<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mem. &s;ur la Loui&s;iane par M. Dumont, p. 75. Hi&s;t. de la Loui&s;iane, par M. du Pratz, tom, 2. p. 87.</NOTE>. As they climb trees
with ea&s;e, they &s;eldom re&s;ide on a level with the
ground, and their habitations are often 30 or 40
feet high. If it be a mother with her young, &s;he
de&s;cends fir&s;t, and is &s;lain before &s;he reaches the
ground. The cubs follow, are &s;eized by throw|ing
a rope round their necks, and carried off ei|ther
for the purpo&s;es of training or eating them;
for the fle&s;h of the cubs is delicate and good:
That of the adult is eatable; but, as it is mixed
with an oily fat, the paws alone, which are more
compact, are reckoned a delicate di&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="19">
The hunting of the bear, without being very
dangerous, is extremely lucrative, when perform|ed
with &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;kin is a valuable fur, and
the quantity of oil drawn from a &s;ingle bear is
con&s;iderable. The fle&s;h and fat are boiled to|gether
in a caldron, and the oil is ea&s;ily &s;epa|rated.
&startq;Afterwards,&endq; &s;ays M. du Pratz, &startq;the
oil is purified, by throwing it, when very warm,
into a quantity of &s;alt and water. A detonation
en&s;ues, and a thick &s;moke ri&s;es, which carries off
the di&s;agreeable odour of the grea&s;e. When the
&s;moke cea&s;es, and while the grea&s;e is &s;till warm,
it is put into a pot, where it is allowed to remain
for eight or ten days. At the end of this period,
a clear oil is &s;een &s;wimming on the top, which is
taken off with a laddle. This oil is equally good,
and an&s;wers the &s;ame purpo&s;es, as the be&s;t olive
oil. Beneath, we find a lard as white, but a little
&s;ofter than hog's-lard. It &s;erves for culinary pur|po&s;es,
and has no bad ta&s;te or &s;mell.&endq; M. Du|mont,
in his Memoirs of Loui&s;iana, agrees with
M. du Pratz, and adds, that, from a &s;ingle bear,
they obtain more than 120 pots of this oil; that
the &s;avages traffick in this article with the French;
that it is very whole&s;ome and good; that it ne|ver
congeals but during great colds, and, when
this happens, it is all clotted and of a dazzling
whitene&s;s; and that then it is eaten upon bread,
like butter. Our druggi&s;ts keep no bear's grea&s;e,
but import, from Savoy, Switzerland, or Canada,
axungium, which is by no means pure. The au|thor
<PB N="13" REF="20">
of the Dictionary of Commerce affirms, that
good bear's grea&s;e &s;hould be grayi&s;h, vi&s;cid, and
of a di&s;agreeable odour; and that, when too
white, it is &s;ophi&s;ticated and mixed with &s;uet. It
is applied topically in hernias, rheumati&s;m, &amp;c.
and many people a&s;&s;ure us, that they have felt
the good effects of it.</P>
<P>The amazing fatne&s;s of the bear makes him
light for &s;wimming; and, accordingly, he tra|ver&s;es,
with ea&s;e, rivers and lakes. &startq;The bears
of Loui&s;iana,&endq; &s;ays Dumont<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mem. &s;ur la Loui&s;iane, p. 76.</NOTE>, &startq;which are of a

<P>M. de Mu&s;ly, major of artillery in the &s;ervice
of the States General, has communicated &s;ome
notices concerning dome&s;tic bears, of which the
following is an extract.</P>
<P>&startq;At Berne, where the&s;e animals are nouri&s;h|ed,&endq;
&s;ays M. de Mu&s;ly, &startq;they are kept in large
&s;quare ditches,&endq; where they have room to walk
about. The&s;e ditches are covered above, and
lined with &s;tone, both at the bottom and on the
&s;ides. Their lodges or cabbins are likewi&s;e pa|ved,
on a level with the bottom of the ditch, di|vided
into two by walls, and may be &s;hut both
internally and externally by iron grates. In the
middle of the&s;e ditches, there are large holes in
the pavement, where con&s;iderable trees may be
&s;et up on end. There is likewi&s;e, in each ditch,
a trough full of fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>&startq;Two young brown bears were tran&s;ported
here from Savoy,&endq; thirty-one years ago, of which
the female is &s;till alive; the male was killed a|bout
two months ago, by a fall from one of the
high trees planted in the ditch. They began to
generate at the age of five years: Since that time,
they have every year come in &s;ea&s;on during the
month of June; and the female has always
brought forth in the beginning of January. The
<PB N="16" REF="23">
fir&s;t time &s;he produced only one cub, and after|wards,
&s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes two, and &s;ome|times
three, but never more; and the three la&s;t
years, &s;he has brought forth only one at each
time. The man who takes care of her, thinks
her &s;till pregnant (October 17. 1771.) When
the young come into the world, their figure is
pretty; their colour is yellow, but white round
the neck; and they have not the lea&s;t appear|ance
of bears. The mother is extremely fond
of them. Their eyes are &s;hut during four weeks.
At fir&s;t they exceed not eight inches in length;
and, three months after, they mea&s;ure 14 or 15
inches from the end of the muzzle to the root of
the tail; and their hair is nearly an inch long.
Their figure is then almo&s;t round, and the muzzle
is very &s;harp pointed; &s;o that a per&s;on would
hardly know them. They afterwards become
weak and tender till they acquire their full
growth; the white colour is gradually effaced,
and the yellow changes into brown.</P>
<P>During the act of copulation, the male com|mences
with &s;hort, but bri&s;k movements, which
la&s;t about a quarter of a minute; he then repo&s;es
double that time upon the female, without di&s;en|gaging
him&s;elf: In this manner he proceeds for
three or four times; and, when the operation is
fini&s;hed, the male bathes him&s;elf in the trough
up to the neck. They &s;ometimes fight cruelly,
making a horrible grumbling noi&s;e. But, in the
<PB N="17" REF="24">
&s;ea&s;on of love, the female has generally the ad|vantage,
becau&s;e the male, at that time, &s;pares
her. The ditches, which formerly were in the
town, are now filled up, and others are made
between the ramparts and the old walls. The&s;e
two bears, having been &s;eparated &s;ome hours
when removing into the new ditches, rai&s;ed them|&s;elves
on end when they again met, and em|braced
each other with tran&s;port. After the
death of the male, the female appeared to be
much afflicted, and refu&s;ed every kind of nouri&s;h|ment
for &s;everal days. But, unle&s;s the&s;e animals
be brought up and fed together from their earlie&s;t
youth, they cannot endure one another; and, af|ter
being accu&s;tomed to this kind of &s;ociety, the
&s;urvivor will not admit another mate.</P>
<P>&startq;The trees put yearly into the ditches in the
month of May,&endq; are green larches, upon which
the bears take va&s;t delight in climbing. They
are fed with rye-bread, which is cut into large
mor&s;els, and &s;teeped in warm water. They
likewi&s;e eat all &s;orts of fruits; and, when any
unripe fruits are brought to the market, they are
thrown in to the bears by order of the magi|&s;trate.
It has been remarked, however, that &s;ome
bears prefer pul&s;e to the fruits of trees. When
the female is about to bring forth, they give her
plenty of &s;traw, of which &s;he makes a rampart.
After this, the male is removed, le&s;t he &s;hould
eat the cubs; and, when &s;he has littered, &s;he is fed
<PB N="18" REF="25">
with a more nouri&s;hing diet than u&s;ual. We never
could perceive any part of the membranes or af|ter-birth,
which makes it probable that &s;he eat
them. The cubs are allowed to remain with her
for ten weeks; and are afterwards &s;eparated, and
fed, for &s;ome time, with milk and bi&s;cuit.</P>
<P>&startq;The bear which we believed to be in a &s;tate
of pregnancy,&endq; was furni&s;hed, about the com|mon
time, with &s;traw, of which &s;he made a bed,
and re&s;ted on it during three weeks, without pro|ducing
any thing. She brought forth, for the la&s;t
time, at the age of 31, in the month of January
1771; but, though &s;he received the male in the
following June, it was ineffectual in January
1772. It were to be wi&s;hed that &s;he was al|lowed
to live, in order to di&s;cover the term fix|ed
by Nature for the duration of the&s;e animals.</P>
<P>&startq;There are brown bears on Mount Jura, up|on
the frontiers of our canton, in Franche|comt&eacute;,
and in the country of Gex. When they
de&s;cend into the plains in autumn, they repair to
the che&s;nut woods, where they make great ha|vock.
In this country, the bears are &s;aid to have
weak eyes, but acute &s;en&s;es of hearing, touching,
and &s;melling.&endq;</P>
<P>The bears of Norway are more common in the
provinces of Bergen and Drontheim, than in the
other di&s;tricts of that country. Two races of
them are remarked, of which the one is con&s;ide|rably
&s;maller than the other. In the colours of
<PB N="19" REF="26">
both, there are great varieties. Some of them
are of a deep brown, others of a &s;hining brown;
and &s;ome are gray, and of every &s;hade of white.
At the beginning of October, they retire into the
dens they prepare for them&s;elves, and where they
make a kind of bed compo&s;ed of mo&s;s and leaves
of trees. As the&s;e animals are very formidable,
e&s;pecially when wounded, there are &s;eldom le&s;s
than three or four hunters in company; and, as
the bear ea&s;ily kills large dogs, they employ on|ly
&s;mall dogs, who pa&s;s under his belly, and
&s;eize him by the genitals. When he finds him|&s;elf
overpowered, he leans his back again&s;t a
rock or a tree, collects turf and &s;tones, which he
throws at his enemies; and it is generally in
this &s;ituation that he receives the fini&s;hing
blow<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's natural hi&s;tory of Norway.</NOTE>.</P>

and di&s;per&s;ed by force, their &s;ocieties have
vani&s;hed, their indu&s;try has become barren, their

general qualities, and the whole have pre&s;erved
only their individual properties, matured, in &s;ome,
by example, by imitation, and by in&s;truction;
and, in others, by fear, and by the nece&s;&s;ity of
perpetually watching over their own &s;afety.
What views, what de&s;igns can be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
<PB N="22" REF="31">
&s;laves without &s;pirit, or exiles without power?
Compelled to fly, and to exi&s;t in a &s;olitary man|ner,
they can arrive at no improvement; they
can neither acquire nor tran&s;mit knowledge; but
mu&s;t continually langui&s;h in calamity, and de|cay;
they mu&s;t perpetuate without multiplying;
and, in a word, they mu&s;t lo&s;e by their duration
more than they acquire by experience.</P>
<P>It is for this rea&s;on that there are now no re|mains
of that a&s;toni&s;hing indu&s;try of animals, ex|cepting
in tho&s;e di&s;tant and de&s;ert regions where,
for a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, they have received
no di&s;turbance from man, where each &s;pecies
can di&s;play with freedom its natural talents, and
mature them in quiet, by uniting into permanent
&s;ocieties. The beavers afford, perhaps, the only
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting monument of the antient intelligence
of brutes, which, though infinitely inferior in
principle to the human intellect, &s;uppo&s;es com|mon
projects and relative views; projects which,
having &s;ociety for their ba&s;is, and, for their ob|ject,
a dike to con&s;truct, a town to build, or a
republic to found, imply &s;ome mode of making
them&s;elves under&s;tood, and the capacity of acting
in concert.</P>
<P>The beavers are &s;aid to be, among quadru|peds,
what the bees are among the in&s;ect tribes.
There are in Nature, as &s;he now appears, three
&s;pecies of &s;ocieties, which mu&s;t be examined be|fore
we can compare them: The free &s;ociety of
man, from which, next to God, he derives all his
<PB N="23" REF="32">
power; the con&s;trained &s;ociety of the larger ani|mals,
which always flies before that of man; and
the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ociety of certain &s;mall creatures,
which, being all produced at the &s;ame time, and in
the &s;ame place, are obliged to live together. An
individual, &s;olitary as he comes from the hand
of Nature, is a &s;terile being, who&s;e indu&s;try is li|mited
to the &s;imple u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es. Even man
him&s;elf, in a &s;tate of pure nature, deprived of the
light and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ociety, neither produces
nor con&s;tructs. Fertility, on the contrary, is the
nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of every &s;ociety, however blind
or fortuitous, provided it be compo&s;ed of creatures
of the &s;ame nature. From the nece&s;&s;ity alone of
de&s;iring to approach or to avoid each other, com|mon
movements ari&s;e, from which there often
re&s;ults a work, that has the air of being concerted,
managed, and executed with intelligence. Thus
the works of bees, each of whom, in a given
place, &s;uch as a hive, or the hollow of an old tree,
builds a cell; the works of the Cayenne bee, or
fly, who not only makes the cells, but the hive
that is to contain them, are operations purely
mechanical, and imply no intelligence, no con|certed
project, no general views; they are la|bours
which, being the produce of a phy&s;ical ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
a re&s;ult of common movements<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. III. Di&s;&s;ertation on the nature of animals.</NOTE>, are at
all times, and in all places, uniformly executed in
the &s;ame manner, by a multitude, not a&s;&s;embled
from choice, but united by the force of nature.
<PB N="24" REF="33">
Hence, it is not &s;ociety, but numbers alone,
which operate here. It is a blind power, never
to be compared to that light by which all &s;ociety
is directed. I &s;peak not of that pure light, that
ray of divinity, which has been imparted to man
alone. Of this the beavers, as well as all the other
animals, are mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly deprived. But their
&s;ociety, not being a union of con&s;traint, but pro|ceeding
from a &s;pecies of choice, and &s;uppo&s;ing,
at lea&s;t, a general concert and common views in
its members, implies likewi&s;e a certain degree of
intelligence, which, though different in principle
from that of man, produces effects &s;o &s;imilar as
to admit of compari&s;on, not, indeed, to the lumi|nous
&s;ociety of poli&s;hed nations, but to the rudi|ments
of it, as they appear among &s;avages, who&s;e
union and operations can alone, with propriety,
be compared to tho&s;e of certain animals.</P>
<P>Let us, then, examine the product of each of
the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations; let us &s;ee how far the art of
the beaver extends, and to what the talents of
the &s;avage is limited. To break a branch, and
to make a &s;taff of it, to build a hut, and to cover
it with leaves, for &s;helter, and to collect hay or
mo&s;s, and to make a bed of the&s;e materials, are
operations common to the animal and to the &s;a|vage.
The beavers build huts, the monkeys carry
&s;taves, and &s;everal other animals make commo|dious
and neat hou&s;es, which are impenetrable by
water. To &s;harpen a &s;tone by friction, and
make a hatchet of it, to u&s;e this hatchet for cut|ting
<PB N="25" REF="34">
or peeling the bark off trees, for pointing ar|rows,
for hollowing a ve&s;&s;el, or for &s;laying an a|nimal
in order to clothe them&s;elves with its &s;kin,
to make bow-&s;trings of its &s;inews, to fix the &s;i|news
to a hard thorn or bone, and to u&s;e the&s;e
for needles and thread, are actions purely indivi|dual,
which man in &s;olitude may perform with|out
the aid of others; actions which &s;olely de|pend
on conformation, becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e no|thing
but the u&s;e of the hand. But, to cut and
tran&s;port a large tree, to build a village, or to
con&s;truct a large canoe, are operations, on the
contrary, which nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e common la|bour
and concerted views. The&s;e works are the
re&s;ults of infant &s;ociety in &s;avage nations; but
the operations of the beavers are the fruits of &s;o|ciety
already matured among tho&s;e animals; for
it mu&s;t be remarked, that they never think of
building, but in countries where they are per|fectly
free and undi&s;turbed. There are beavers
in Languedoc, and in the i&s;lands of the Rhone;
and they abound in many of the northern pro|vinces
of Europe. But, as all the&s;e countries
are inhabited, or, at lea&s;t, frequented by men,
the beavers there, like all the other animals, are
di&s;per&s;ed, &s;olitary, fugitive, and timid creatures.
They have never been known to unite, or to con|&s;truct
any common work. But, in de&s;ert regions,
where men in &s;ociety were long of arriving, and
where &s;ome ve&s;tiges only of &s;avages could be tra|ced,
the beavers have every where united, formed
<PB N="26" REF="35">
a&s;&s;ociations, and con&s;tructed works which continue
to excite admiration. Of this I &s;hall endeavour
to quote the mo&s;t judicious and irreproachable
authorities, and &s;hall hold as certain only tho&s;e
facts concerning which authors agree. Le&s;s in|clined,
perhaps, than &s;ome of them, to indulge
admiration, I &s;hall venture to doubt, and even to
critici&s;e, every article that appears too hard to be
credited.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally allowed, that the beaver, in
his purely individual qualities, in&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
any marked &s;uperiority over the other animals,
appears, on the contrary, to &s;ink con&s;iderably
below &s;ome of them: And we are enabled to con|firm
this fact, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a young beaver,
&s;ent us from Canada<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This beaver was taken when very young, and tran&s;mit|ted to me, in the beginning of the year 1758, by M. de Mont|belliard, a captain of the Royal Artillery.</NOTE>, which we have kept alive
near twelve months. This animal is very gentle,
peaceable, and familiar. It is &s;omewhat melan|choly,
and even plaintive; but has no violence
or vehemence in its pa&s;&s;ions. Its movements are
&s;low, and its efforts feeble; yet it is &s;eriou&s;ly oc|cupied
with a de&s;ire of liberty, gnawing, from
time to time, the gates of its pri&s;on, but without
fury or precipitation, and with the &s;ole view of
making an opening for its e&s;cape. In other mat|ters,
it &s;eems to be extremely indifferent, forming
no attachments<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">We are told, however, by M. Klein, that he fed a beaver during &s;everal years, and that it followed, and went in que&s;t of him, as dogs &s;earch for their ma&s;ters.</NOTE>, and neither wi&s;hes to hurt nor
<PB N="27" REF="36">
to plea&s;e. In the&s;e relative qualities, which would
make him approach to man, he &s;eems to be in|ferior
to the dog. He appears to be formed
neither for &s;erving, commanding, nor even hold|ing
commerce with any other &s;pecies than his
own. His &s;en&s;e, locked up in his own per&s;on,
never entirely manife&s;ts it&s;elf but among his own
tribe. When alone, he has little per&s;onal indu|&s;try,
le&s;s artifice, and hardly prudence enough to
avoid the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;nares. In&s;tead of attacking
other animals, he is even very aukward in defend|ing
him&s;elf. He prefers flight to combat, though
he bites cruelly when he finds him&s;elf &s;eized by
the hand of the hunter.</P>
<P>If, then, we con&s;ider this animal in a &s;tate of
nature, or rather in a &s;tate of &s;olitude and di&s;|per&s;ion,
he appears not, by his internal qualities,
to ri&s;e above the other animals. He has not the
genius of a dog, the &s;en&s;e of an elephant, the
craftine&s;s of the fox, &amp;c. but is more remark|able
for &s;ome &s;ingularities of external conforma|tion,
than for any apparent &s;uperiority of mental
faculties. He is the only quadruped furni&s;hed
with a flat, oval tail, covered with &s;cales, which
he u&s;es as a rudder to direct his cour&s;e in the wa|ter;
the only animal that has his hind-feet web|bed,
and the toes of his fore-feet, which he em|ploys
for carrying victuals to his mouth, &s;epa|rate
from each other; the only quadruped that
<PB N="28" REF="37">
re&s;embles the land-animals in the anterior parts
of his body, and the aquatic animals in the po|&s;terior.
He forms the link between quadrupeds
and fi&s;hes, as the bat does between quadrupeds
and birds. But the&s;e peculiarities would be ra|ther
defects than perfections, if the beaver knew
not how to derive, from this &s;ingular conforma|tion,
advantages which render him &s;uperior to
every other quadruped.</P>
<P>The beavers begin to a&s;&s;emble, in the month
of June or July, for the purpo&s;e of uniting into
&s;ociety. They arrive in numbers, from all cor|ners,
and &s;oon form a troop of two or three hun|dred.
The place of rendezvous is generally the
&s;ituation fixed for their e&s;tabli&s;hment, and is al|ways
on the banks of waters. If the waters be
flat, and never ri&s;e above their ordinary level, as
in lakes, the beavers make no bank or dam. But,
in rivers or brooks, where the waters are &s;ubject
to ri&s;ings and fallings, they build a bank, and, by
this artifice, they form a pond or piece of water
which remains always at the fame height. The
bank traver&s;es the river, from one &s;ide to the o|ther,
like a &s;luice, and it is often from 80 to 100
feet long, by 10 or 12 broad at the ba&s;e. This
pile, for animals of a &s;ize &s;o &s;mall, appears to be
enormous, and &s;uppo&s;es an incredible labour<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The large&s;t beavers weigh 50 or 60 pounds, and exceed not three feet in length, from the end of the muzzle to the origin of the tail,</NOTE>.
But the &s;olidity with which the work is con&s;truc|ted,
<PB N="29" REF="38">
is &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing than its magnitude.
The part of the river where they erect this bank
is generally &s;hallow. If they find on the margin
a large tree, which can be made to fall into the
water, they begin with cutting it down, to form
the principal part of their work. This tree is of|ten
thicker than the body of a man. By gnaw|ing
the foot of the tree with their four cutting
teeth, they accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e in a very
&s;hort time, and always make the tree fall acro&s;s
the river. They next cut the branches from the
trunk, to make it lie level. The&s;e operations are
performed by the whole community. Several
beavers are employed in gnawing the foot of the
tree, and others in lopping off the branches after
it has fallen. Others, at the &s;ame time, traver&s;e
the banks of the river, and cut down &s;maller trees,
from the &s;ize of a man's leg to that of his thigh.
The&s;e they dre&s;s, and cut to a certain length, to
make &s;takes of them, and fir&s;t drag them by land
to the margin of the river, and then by water to
the place where the building is carrying on.
The&s;e piles they &s;ink down, and interweave the
branches with the larger &s;takes. This operation
implies the vanqui&s;hing of many difficulties; for,
to dre&s;s the&s;e &s;takes, and to put them in a &s;itua|tion
nearly perpendicular, &s;ome of the beavers
mu&s;t elevate, with their teeth, the thick ends a|gain&s;t
the margin of the river, or again&s;t the
cro&s;s-tree, while others plunge to the bottom, and
dig holes with their fore-feet, to receive the points,
<PB N="30" REF="39">
that they may &s;tand on end. When &s;ome are
labouring in this manner, others bring earth,
which they pla&s;h with their feet, and beat firm
with their tails. They carry the earth in their
mouths, and with their fore-feet, and tran&s;port it
in &s;uch quantities, that they fill with it all the
intervals between the piles. The&s;e piles con&s;i&s;t
of &s;everal rows of &s;takes, of equal height, all pla|ced
oppo&s;ite to each other, and extend from one
bank of the river to the other. The &s;takes facing
the under part of the river, are placed perpendi|cularly;
but the re&s;t of the work &s;lopes upwards
to &s;u&s;tain the pre&s;&s;ure of the fluid; &s;o that the
bank, which is 10 or 12 feet wide at the ba&s;e, is
reduced to two or three at the top. It has, there|fore,
not only all the nece&s;&s;ary thickne&s;s and &s;o|lidity,
but the mo&s;t advantageous form for &s;up|porting
the weight of the water, for preventing
its i&s;&s;ue, and to repel its efforts. Near the top,
or thinne&s;t part of the bank, they make two or
three &s;loping holes, to allow the &s;urface-water to
e&s;cape, and the&s;e they enlarge or contract, accor|ding
as the river ri&s;es or falls; and, when any
breaches are made in the bank by &s;udden or vio|lent
inundations, they know how to repair them
as &s;oon as the water &s;ub&s;ides.</P>
<P>It would be &s;uperfluous, after this account of
their public work, to give a detail of their parti|cular
operations, were it not nece&s;&s;ary, in a hi|&s;tory
of the&s;e animals, to mention every fact, and
were not the fir&s;t great &s;tructure made with a
<PB N="31" REF="40">
view to render their &s;maller habitations more
commodious. The&s;e cabins or hou&s;es are built
upon piles near the margin of the pond, and have
two openings, the one for going to the land, and
the other for throwing them&s;elves into the wa|ter.
The form of the edifices is either oval or
round, &s;ome of them larger and &s;ome le&s;s, vary|ing
from four or five, to eight or ten feet diameter.
Some of them con&s;i&s;t of three or four &s;tories;
and their walls are about two feet thick, rai&s;ed
perpendicularly upon planks, or plain &s;takes,
which &s;erve both for foundations and floors to
their hou&s;es. When they con&s;i&s;t but of one &s;tory,
the walls ri&s;e perpendicularly only a few feet, af|terwards
a&s;&s;ume a curved form, and terminate in
a dome or vault, which &s;erves them for a roof.
They are built with amazing &s;olidity, and neatly
pla&s;tered both without and within. They are
impenetrable to rain, and re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t impetu|ous
winds. The partitions are covered with a
kind of &s;tu$co, as nicely pla&s;tered as if it had been
executed by the hand of man. In the application
of this mortar, their tails &s;erve for trowels, and their
feet for pla&s;hing. They employ different mate|rials,
as wood, &s;tone, and a kind of &s;andy earth,
which is not &s;ubject to di&s;&s;olution in water. The
wood they u&s;e is almo&s;t all of the light and tender
kinds, as alders, poplars, and willows, which ge|nerally
grow on the banks of rivers, and are more
ea&s;ily barked, cut, and tran&s;ported, than the hea|vier
and more &s;olid &s;pecies of timber. When
<PB N="32" REF="41">
they once attack a tree, they never abandon it till
they cut it down, and carry it off. They always
begin the operation of cutting at a foot, or a
foot and a half above the ground: They labour
in a &s;itting po&s;ture; and, be&s;ide the convenience
of this &s;ituation, they enjoy the plea&s;ure of gnaw|ing
perpetually the bark and wood, which are
mo&s;t palatable to their ta&s;te; for they prefer fre&s;h
bark and tender wood to mo&s;t of their ordinary
aliment. Of the&s;e provi&s;ions they lay up ample
&s;tores, to &s;upport them during the winter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The provi&s;ion for eight or ten beavers, is twenty-five or thirty feet in length, by eight or ten feet in thickne&s;s. They tran&s;port not into their cabins wood or bark, till cut into thin &s;lices, and ju&s;t prepared for eating. They love fre&s;h wood better than what has been floated, and go out, from time to time, during the winter, to eat fre&s;h provi&s;ions in the fore&s;ts; <HI>Mem. de l'Acad&punc; ann.</HI> 1704.</NOTE>; but
they are not fond of dry wood. It is in the wa|ter,
and near their habitations, that they e&s;tabli&s;h
their magazines. Each cabin has its own maga|zine,
proportioned to the number of its inhabi|tants,
who have all a common right to the &s;tore,
and never pillage their neighbours. Some vil|lages
are compo&s;ed of twenty or twenty-five ca|bins.
But the&s;e large e&s;tabli&s;hments are rare;
and the common republic &s;eldom exceeds ten or
twelve families, of which each has his own quar|ter
of the village, his own magazine, and his &s;e|parate
habitation. They allow not &s;trangers to
&s;et down in their neighbourhood. The &s;malle&s;t
cabins contain two, four, or &s;ix; and the large&s;t
<PB N="33" REF="42">
eighteen, twenty, and, it is alledged, &s;ometimes
thirty beavers. They are almo&s;t always equally
paired, being the &s;ame number of females as of males.
Thus, upon a moderate computation, the society is
often compo&s;ed of 150 or 200, who all, at fir&s;t,
laboured jointly, in rai&s;ing the great public build|ing,
and afterwards in &s;elect tribes or companies,
in making particular habitations. In this &s;ociety,
however numerous, an univer&s;al peace is main|tained.
Their union is cemented by common
labours; and it is rendered perpetual by mutual
convenience, and the abundance of provi&s;ions
which they ama&s;s and con&s;ume together. Mode|rate
appetites, a &s;imple ta&s;te, an aver&s;ion again&s;t
blood and carnage, deprive them of the idea of
rapine and war. They enjoy every po&s;&s;ible good,
while man only knows how to pant after it.
Friends to each other, if they have &s;ome foreign
enemies, they know how to avoid them. When
danger approaches, they adverti&s;e one another,
by &s;triking their tail on the &s;urface of the water,
the noi&s;e of which is heard at a great di&s;tance,
and re&s;ounds through all the vaults of their ha|bitations.
Each takes his part; &s;ome plunge in|to
the lake, others conceal them&s;elves within their
walls, which can only be penetrated by the fire
of heaven, or the &s;teel of man, and which no a|nimal
will attempt either to open or to overturn.
The&s;e retreats are not only very &s;afe, but neat
and commodious. The floors are &s;pread over
with verdure: The branches of the box and the
<PB N="34" REF="43">
$ir &s;erve them for carpets, upon which they per|mit
not the lea&s;t dirtine&s;s. The window that
faces the water an&s;wers for a balcony to receive
the fre&s;h air, and to bathe. During the greate&s;t
part of the day, they &s;it on end, with their head
and anterior parts of the body elevated, and their
po&s;terior parts &s;unk in the water. This win|dow
is made with caution, the aperture of which
is &s;ufficiently rai&s;ed to prevent its being &s;topped
up with the ice, which, in the beaver climates, is
often two or three feet thick. When this hap|pens,
they &s;lope the &s;ole of the window, cut ob|liquely
the &s;takes which &s;upport it, and thus open a
communication with the unfrozen water. This
element is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, or rather &s;o agreeable to
them, that they can &s;eldom di&s;pen&s;e with it.
They often &s;wim a long way under the ice: It is
then that they are mo&s;t ea&s;ily taken, by attacking
the cabin on one hand, and, at the &s;ame time,
watching at a hole made at &s;ome di&s;tance, where
they are obliged to repair for the purpo&s;es of
re&s;piration. The continual habit of keeping their
tail and po&s;terior parts in the water, appears to
have changed the nature of their fle&s;h. That of
their anterior parts, as far as the reins, has the
ta&s;te and con&s;i&s;tence of the fle&s;h of land or air
animals; but that of the tail and po&s;teriors has
the odour and all the other qualities of fi&s;h. The
tail, which is a foot long, an inch thick, and five
or &s;ix inches broad, is even an extremity or ge|nuine
portion of a fi&s;h, attached to the body of a
quadruped: It is entirely covered with &s;cales,
<PB N="35" REF="44">
and with a &s;kin perfectly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of large
fi&s;hes. They may be &s;craped off with a knife,
and, after falling, they leave an impre&s;&s;ion on the
&s;kin, as is the ca&s;e with all fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>It is in the beginning of &s;ummer that the bea|vers
a&s;&s;emble. They employ the months of July
and Augu&s;t in the con&s;truction of their bank and
cabins. They collect, in September, their pro|vi&s;ions
of bark and wood: Afterwards they en|joy
the fruits of their labours, and ta&s;te the &s;weets
of dome&s;tic happine&s;s. This is the time of re|po&s;e,
and the &s;ea&s;on of love. Knowing and lo|ving
one another from habit, from the plea&s;ures
and fatigues of a common labour, each couple
join not by chance, nor by the pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ities
of nature, but unite from choice and from ta&s;te.
They pa&s;s together the autumn and the winter:
Perfectly &s;atisfied with each other, they never &s;e|parate.
At ea&s;e in their cabins, they go not out
but upon agreeable or u&s;eful excur&s;ions, to bring
in &s;upplies of fre&s;h bark, which they prefer to
what is too dry or too much moi&s;tened with wa|ter.
The females are &s;aid to go pregnant for four
months; they bring forth in the end of winter,
and generally produce two or three young ones.
About this time, they are left by the males, who
retire to the country to enjoy the plea&s;ures and
the fruits of the &s;pring. They return, occa&s;ion|ally,
to their cabins; but dwell there no more.
The mothers continue in the cabins, and are oc|cupied
in nur&s;ing, protecting, and rearing their
<PB N="36" REF="45">
young, who, at the end of a few weeks, are in a
condition to follow their dams. The females,
in their turn, make little excur&s;ions to recruit
them&s;elves by the air, by eating fi&s;hes, crabs, and
fre&s;h bark, and, in this manner, pa&s;s the &s;ummer
upon the waters, and in the woods. They a&s;|&s;emble
not again till autumn, unle&s;s their banks
or cabins be overturned by inundations; for,
when accidents of this kind happen, they &s;udden|ly
collect their forces, in order to repair the
breaches which have been made.</P>
<P>Some places they prefer to others for their ha|bitation,
and they have been ob&s;erved, after ha|ving
their labours frequently de&s;troyed, to return
every &s;ummer to repair them, till, being-fatigued
with this per&s;ecution, and weakened by the lo&s;s of
&s;everal of their numbers, they took the re&s;olu|tion
of changing their abode, and of retiring to
&s;olitudes &s;till more profound. It is in winter
that they are chiefly &s;ought by the hunters;
becau&s;e their fur is not perfectly &s;ound in any
other &s;ea&s;on: And, after their village is ruined,
and numbers of them are taken, the &s;ociety is
&s;ometimes too much reduced to admit of a fre&s;h
e&s;tabli&s;hment; but tho&s;e which e&s;cape death or
captivity, di&s;per&s;e and become vagabond. Their
genius, withered by fear, never again expands.
They hide them&s;elves, and their talents, in holes;
or, &s;unk to the condition of other animals, they
lead a timid and a &s;olitary life. Occupied only by
pre&s;&s;ing wants, and exerting &s;olely their indivi|dual
<PB N="37" REF="46">
powers, they lo&s;e forever tho&s;e &s;ocial qua|lities
which we have been &s;o ju&s;tly admiring.</P>
<P>However marvellous the &s;ociety and the opera|tions
I have now de&s;cribed may appear, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to doubt of their reality. All the facts

and improbable to be credited. Authors
have not limited them&s;elves to the &s;ocial man|ners
of the beavers, and to their evident talents
for architecture, but have a&s;cribed to them gene|ral
ideas of police and of government. They
have affirmed, that, after the beavers have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="38" REF="47">
a &s;ociety, they reduce &s;trangers and travel|lers
of their own &s;pecies into &s;lavery; that the&s;e
they employ to carry their earth and to drag
their trees; that they treat in the &s;ame manner
the lazy and the old of their own &s;ociety; that
they turn them on their backs, and make them
&s;erve as vehicles for the carriage of their mate|rials;
that the&s;e republicans never a&s;&s;ociate but
in an odd number, in order to have always a
ca&s;ting voice in their deliberations; that each tribe
has its chief: that they have e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;entinels
for the public &s;afety; that, when pur&s;ued, they
tear off their te&s;ticles, to &s;atisfy the a varice of their
hunters; that, in this mutilated &s;tate, they exhi|bit
them&s;elves to procure the compa&s;&s;ion of their
per&s;ecutors<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Aelian, and all the antients, except Pliny, who, like a philo&s;opher, denies the fact. For the other articles, &s;ee mo&s;t of the authors quoted in the preceding note.</NOTE>, &amp;c. In proportion as we reject
with contempt tho&s;e exaggerated fables, we mu&s;t
admit the facts which are e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed
by moral certainties. The works of this animal
have been a thou&s;and times viewed, mea&s;ured,
overturned, de&s;igned, and engraven. What is
&s;till more convincing, &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ingular
works &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, though le&s;s common than when
North America was fir&s;t di&s;covered, and have
been &s;een by all the mi&s;&s;ionaries, and all the la|te&s;t
travellers who have penetrated into the nor|thern
regions of that continent.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally agreed, that, be&s;ide the beavers
who live in &s;ociety, there are, in the &s;ame climate,
<PB N="39" REF="48">
others who are &s;olitary, and rejected, it is &s;aid,
from the &s;ocial &s;tate for their crimes, reap|ing
none of its advantages, having neither hou&s;e
nor magazine, and living, like the badger, in holes
under the ground. The&s;e &s;olitary beavers are
called <HI>terriers.</HI> They are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by
their dirty and tattered robe; for the hair of their
back is rubbed off by the friction of the earth.
They live, like the other kind, upon banks of
waters, where &s;ome of them make a ditch of &s;e|veral
feet deep, in order to form a pond that may
reach to the mouth of their hole, which frequent|ly
exceeds 100 feet in length, and all along &s;lopes
upward, to facilitate their retreat, in proportion
as the water ri&s;es during inundations. But there
are other &s;olitary beavers, which live at a con&s;ide|rable
di&s;tance from water. All our European bea|vers
are terriers and &s;olitary, and their fur is not
near &s;o valuable as that of tho&s;e which live in &s;o|ciety.
They differ in colour, according to the
climate they inhabit. In the northern de&s;erts,
they are perfectly black, and their furs are fine&s;t;
but, even there, &s;ome are found entirely white, o|thers
white &s;potted with gray, and others with a
mixture of red upon the nap of the neck and
haunches<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;tor albus, cauda horizontaliter plana; <HI>Bri&s;&s;on. Regn. $nim.</HI> p. 94.</NOTE>. In proportion as they recede from
the north, their colour turns clearer and more mix|ed.

coloured; farther &s;outh, they are bay, and of a

beavers are found from the 30th degree of
north latitude to beyond the 60th. They are ve|ry
frequent in the north, and gradually decrea&s;e
as we advance &s;outhward. The &s;ame thing holds in
the Old Continent: They never appear in num|bers
but in the northern regions; and they
are very rare in France, Spain, Italy, Greece,
and Egypt. They were known to the antients.
The religion of the Magi prohibited the killing
of beavers. They were common on the margins
of the Pontus Euxinus, and were di&s;tingui&s;hed by
the name of <HI>Canes Pontici:</HI> But they probably were
not quiet enough in this &s;ituation, (for the coa&s;ts of
this country have been frequented by men from
the earlie&s;t periods of hi&s;tory), &s;ince their &s;ocie|ty
and labours are mentioned by none of the
antients. Aelian, in particular, who betrays &s;o
&s;trong an affection for the marvellous, and who,
I believe, fir&s;t advanced that the beaver cut off
his te&s;ticles to allow them to be collected by the
hunters<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t anim. lib. 6. cap. 34.</NOTE>, would never have failed to mention
the wonders of their republic, and their talents
for architecture. Even Pliny him&s;elf, who&s;e
bold, sublime, and melancholy genius, made him
uniformly de&s;pi&s;e men to exalt Nature, could not
have ab&s;tained from comparing the labours of
Romulus to tho&s;e of the beavers. It is, there|fore,
apparent, that their indu&s;try in building
<PB N="41" REF="54">
was altogether unknown to the antients; and,
although cabined beavers have lately been found
in Norway, and in other northern regions of
Europe, and though it is probable that the an|tient
beavers built as well as the modern; yet,
as the Romans never penetrated &s;o far north, it
is not &s;urpri&s;ing that their writers are &s;ilent on
this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Several authors have affirmed, that the beaver,
being an aquatic animal, could not live upon land,
without water. But this notion is fal&s;e; for the
young beaver &s;ent me from Canada was always
kept in the hou&s;e; and, when fir&s;t pre&s;ented to
water, it was afraid, and refu&s;ed to enter into
that element. But, after being forced and re|tained
in a ba&s;on, it grew &s;o ea&s;y in a few
minutes, that it made no attempts to get out;
and, when left at liberty, it often returned to the
water &s;pontaneou&s;ly. It likewi&s;e avails it&s;elf of
the mire and moi&s;t pavements. One day he e|&s;caped,
and de&s;cended by a &s;tair into the &s;ubter|raneous
vaults in the royal garden. He conti|nued
for &s;ome time to &s;wim on the &s;tagnant wa|ter
in the bottom of the&s;e vaults. However, as
&s;oon as he &s;aw the light of the torches which were
brought to &s;earch for him, he returned to tho&s;e
who called him, and allowed him&s;elf quietly to
be taken. He is familiar, without being care&s;|&s;ing:
He a&s;ks to eat from tho&s;e who are at table;
and his petitions con&s;i&s;t of a &s;mall plaintive cry,
and &s;ome ge&s;tures with his hand. When he re|ceives
<PB N="42" REF="55">
a mor&s;el, he carries off and conceals it, to
be eaten at lei&s;ure. He &s;leeps pretty often, re|po&s;ing
on his belly. He eats every thing, except|ing
fle&s;h, which he con&s;tantly refu&s;es, whether
it be raw or roa&s;ted. He gnaws every thing he
can find, &s;tuffs, furniture, wood, &amp;c.; and we
have been obliged to line, with a double coat of
white-iron, the barrel in which he was tran&s;|ported.</P>
<P>Though the beavers prefer the margins of lakes,
rivers, and other fre&s;h waters; yet they are found
on the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, but principally on mediterra|nean
gulfs which receive great rivers, where the
water has not its u&s;ual &s;altne&s;s. They are ho&s;tile
to the otter, whom they chace, and will not per|mit
to appear in the waters they frequent. The
fur of the beaver is finer and more bu&s;hy than
that of the otter: It con&s;i&s;ts of two kinds of hair;
the one, which is &s;hort, but bu&s;hy, fine as down,
and impenetrable by water, immediately covers
the &s;kin; the other, which is longer, firmer, more
&s;plendid, but thinner, &s;erves the former as a &s;ur|tout,
defending it from du&s;t and dirt. This &s;e|cond
kind of hair is of little value; it is the fir&s;t
alone that is employed in our manufactures. The
black furs are generally mo&s;t bu&s;hy, and con&s;e|quently
in greate&s;t e&s;teem. The fur of the ter|rier
beaver is much inferior to that of the cabin-building
kind. The beavers, like all other qua|drupeds,
ca&s;t their hair in &s;ummer; and the furs
of tho&s;e caught during this &s;ea&s;on are of little va|lue.
<PB N="43" REF="56">
The fur of the white beaver is greatly e|&s;teemed,
upon account of it rarity; and the per|fectly
black furs are nearly as rare as the white.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ide the fur, which is the mo&s;t precious
article, the beaver furni&s;hes a matter, of which
great u&s;e has been made in medicine. This mat|ter,
called <HI>ca&s;toreum,</HI> is contained in two large
bags or bladders, which the antients mi&s;took for
the te&s;ticles of the animal. We &s;hall here give
neither the de&s;cription nor the u&s;es of that &s;ub|&s;tance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Le Trait&eacute; du ca&s;tor, par Marius et Francus.</NOTE>, becau&s;e they are to be found in all our
di&s;pen&s;atories<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is alledged that the beavers pre&s;s out this liquor with their feet, that it re&s;tores their appetite after a di&s;gu&s;t, and that the &s;avages rub the &s;nares with it which they lay for ap|prehending them. It is more certain, however, that they u&s;e this liquor for grea&s;ing their hair.</NOTE>. The &s;avages, it is &s;aid, extract an
oil from the tail of the beaver, and u&s;e it as a to|pical
application for &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es. The fle&s;h
of the beaver, though fat and delicate, has always
a di&s;agreeable flavour. Their bones are &s;aid to
be exce&s;&s;ively hard; but, concerning this fact, we
have had no opportunities of determining, becau&s;e
we only di&s;&s;ected a young one. Their teeth are
very hard, and &s;o &s;harp, that they are u&s;ed by
the &s;avages as knives to cut, hollow, and poli&s;h
their timber. The &s;avages clothe them&s;elves
with beavers &s;kins; and, in winter, turn the &s;hag|gy
&s;ide inward; and the&s;e, from their having
imbibed much &s;weat from the per&s;piration of
<PB N="44" REF="57">
their wearers, are called <HI>fat-beaver,</HI> or <HI>coat-bea|ver,</HI>
and are only employed for coar&s;e works.</P>
<P>The beaver u&s;es his fore-feet, like hands, with
equal dexterity as the &s;quirrel, the toes being
well &s;eparated; but tho&s;e of the hind-feet are
united by a membrane. The&s;e they employ as
fins, and extend them like the toes of a goo&s;e,
which animal they re&s;emble in their walking up|on
land. The beaver &s;wims better than he runs:
As his fore-legs are much &s;horter than the hind
ones, he always walks with his head low, and his
back arched. His &s;en&s;es are extremely delicate,
e&s;pecially the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling. Dirtine&s;s and
bad &s;mells &s;eem to be perfectly in&s;upportable to
him. When retained in confinement too long,
and obliged to void his excrements, he places them
near the thre&s;hold of the door, and, as &s;oon as
it is opened, he pu&s;hes them out. This habit of
cleanline&s;s is natural to them; and our young
beaver never failed, in this manner, to clean his
habitation. At the age of twelve months, he
exhibited marks of ardour for a female, which
renders it probable that he had then nearly at|tained
his full growth. Hence the duration of
life in the&s;e animals cannot be very long; per|haps
it is too much to extend it to fifteen or
twenty years. It is not a&s;toni&s;hing that this bea|ver
was &s;maller than others of his age, having
been perpetually confined almo&s;t from his birth;
and, being unacquainted with water till he was
$ine months old, he could neither grow nor ex|pand

Engli&s;h name.</P>
<P>The raccoon which we have had alive, and kept
him twelve months, was of the &s;ize and figure
of a &s;mall badger. Its body is thick and &s;hort,
and the hair long, bu&s;hy, black at the points,
and gray underneath. His head re&s;embles that
of the fox; but his ears are round and much
&s;horter. The eyes are large, and of a yellowi&s;h
green colour. Above the eyes, a black band runs a|cro&s;s;
<PB N="47" REF="61">
the muzzle is &s;lender, the no&s;e &s;omewhat
turned up, and the upper lip advances beyond
the under one. He has, like the dog, &s;ix cut|ting
teeth, and two canine in each jaw. The
tail is bu&s;hy, as long as the body, and marked
alternately with black and white rings through
its whole extent. The fore-legs are much &s;hort|er
than the hind ones; and there are five toes,
armed with &s;trong &s;harp claws, on each foot.
The hind feet re&s;t &s;o much on the heel, that the
animal can elevate and &s;upport its body in a po|&s;ition
inclined forwards. He u&s;es the fore-feet
in carrying food to his mouth. But, as his toes
are rigid, and have little flexibility, he u&s;es both
hands at a time in laying hold of what is given
him. Though thick and &s;hort, he is very agile:
His claws, which are &s;harp as thorns, enable
him to climb trees with great facility. He
mounts the trunk with alacrity, and runs to
the extremities of branches. He goes by leaps,
rather gambols than walks, and his movements,
though oblique, are quick and light.</P>
<P>This animal is a native of the &s;outhern parts of
America. He is never found in the Antient Con|tinent;
at lea&s;t, tho&s;e travellers who have de|&s;cribed
the animals of Africa and the Ea&s;t Indies

in Jamaica<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sloane's Nat. hi&s;t of Jamaica, tom. 2. p. 329.</NOTE>, where he lives in the moun|tains,

every thing he intends to eat. He throws
his bread into the ba&s;on that holds his water;
and, unle&s;s pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, he removes it
not till it be well &s;oaked. But, when very hun|gry,
he eats dry food, or any thing that is pre&s;ented
to him. He &s;earches about and eats every thing
that he can find, as fle&s;h, either crude or prepared,
fi&s;hes, eggs, living fowls, grain, roots, &amp;c. He
likewi&s;e devours all kinds of in&s;ects. He de|lights
in hunting &s;piders; and, when at liberty
in the garden, he eats gra&s;shoppers, &s;nails, and
worms. He loves &s;ugar, milk, and other &s;oft
kinds of nouri&s;hment, excepting fruits; but
all the&s;e he rejects, when he can have fle&s;h or
fi&s;h. He retires to a di&s;tance to obey the calls of
nature. He is familiar, and even care&s;&s;ing; for
he leaps upon tho&s;e he is fond of, playing &s;pon|taneou&s;ly,
and perpetually moving about with
great agility. He appears to have much of the

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Concerning the raccoon, I have received the
following communication from M. Blanquart
des Salines, in a letter dated Calais, October 29.
1775.</P>
<P>&startq;My raccoon, before he came into my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
had always been chained. In this &s;tate of
captivity, he was very gentle, but had little in|clination
to care&s;s. The people of the hou&s;e
were all equally kind to him; but he received
them differently; for what plea&s;ed him in one,
he revolted again&s;t in another; and in this his
conduct was invariable.</P>
<P>&startq;His chain &s;ometimes broke; and liberty
rendered him in&s;olent. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an
apartment, would allow none to enter, and it
was with &s;ome difficulty that he could again be
reconciled to bondage. Since he came under my
management, I have frequently given him his
liberty. Without lo&s;ing &s;ight of him, I allow|ed
him to walk about with his chain; and each
time his gratitude was expre&s;&s;ed by a thou&s;and
care&s;&s;ing gambols. But this is by no means the
ca&s;e when he makes his e&s;cape him&s;elf. He
then roams about, &s;ometimes for three or four
days together, upon the roofs of the neighbour|ing
hou&s;es, de&s;cends, during the night-time,
into the court-yards, enters the hen-hou&s;es,
<PB N="50" REF="65">
&s;trangles all the poultry, and eats their heads.
His chain does not render him more humane,
but only more circum&s;pect. He then employs
every artifice to make the fowls grow familiar
with him; he permits them to partake of his
victuals; and it is only after having in&s;pired them
with the highe&s;t notions of &s;ecurity, that he
&s;eizes one, and tears it in pieces. Some young
cats have met with the &s;ame fate. The motions
of this animal, though light, are always oblique;
and I doubt whether he can overtake other ani|mals
by running. He opens oi&s;ters with won|derful
dexterity. His &s;en&s;e of touching mu&s;t be
exqui&s;ite. In all his little operations, he &s;eldom
u&s;es either his no&s;e or his eye. For example,
he makes an oi&s;ter pa&s;s under his hind-paws;
then, without looking at it, he &s;earches with his
hands for the weake&s;t part; there he &s;inks his
claws, &s;eparates the &s;hells, and leaves not a ve|&s;tige
of the fi&s;h. In all this operation, neither his
eyes nor his no&s;e, which he keeps at a di&s;tance,
are of the lea&s;t u&s;e to him.</P>
<P>&startq;This raccoon is not very grateful for the ca|re&s;&s;es
he receives; but is extremely &s;en&s;ible of
bad treatment. A &s;ervant one day gave him &s;e|veral
la&s;hes with a whip. But this man has e|ver
&s;ince endeavoured in vain to accompli&s;h a
reconciliation. Neither eggs nor fi&s;hes, of which
the animal is exceedingly fond, can appea&s;e his
re&s;entment. At the approach of the &s;ervant, the
raccoon flies into a rage; his eyes kindle; he
<PB N="51" REF="66">
&s;prings at the man, utters mo&s;t dolorous cries, and
rejects every thing pre&s;ented to him, till the
di&s;agreeable object di&s;appears. The accents of
his rage are very &s;ingular, &s;ometimes re&s;embling
the whi&s;tling noi&s;e of the curlew, and &s;ome|times
the hoar&s;e barking of an old dog.</P>
<P>&startq;If any one &s;trikes him, if he is attacked by
an animal that he thinks &s;tronger than him&s;elf,
he makes no re&s;i&s;tance; but, like the hedge-hog,
conceals his head and feet by rolling up his body
in the form of a ball; no complaint e&s;capes him;
and, in this po&s;ition, he calmly &s;ubmits to be

<P>&startq;I remarked, that he never allowed hay or
&s;traw to remain in his ne&s;t; but cho&s;e rather
to lie upon wood. When litter is put in, he in|&s;tantly
throws it out. I never perceived that
cold made him unea&s;y. Of three winters,
he has pa&s;&s;ed two expo&s;ed to all the rigours of
the air. I have &s;een him covered with &s;now,
having no &s;helter, and yet in good health. I i|magine
that he is not &s;olicitous about heat. Du|ring
the la&s;t fro&s;ts, I pre&s;ented to him warm wa|ter,
and water almo&s;t frozen, for diluting his
food; but he uniformly preferred the latter.
He had liberty of &s;leeping in the &s;table; but
often preferred a corner of the court.</P>
<P>&startq;The defect of &s;aliva, or having but a &s;mall
quantity of it, is, I imagine, the rea&s;on why this
animal dilutes his food with water. He never
wets fre&s;h or bloody meat, nor a peach, nor a
<PB N="52" REF="67">
rai&s;in. But he plunges every thing that is dry
into his ba&s;on.</P>
<P>&startq;He abhors children; their crying irritates
him; and he makes every effort to &s;pring upon
them. A &s;mall bitch, of which he is fond, he
cha&s;ti&s;es &s;everely when &s;he barks too loud. I
know not why &s;everal animals equally dete&s;t
&s;harp cries. In the year 1770, I had five white
mice. I happened to make one of them cry;
the others attacked it: I continued to make it
cry; and they killed it.</P>
<P>&startq;This raccoon is a female; &s;he comes in &s;ea|&s;on
in the beginning of &s;ummer, and her ardour for
the male continues &s;ix weeks. During this period,
nothing can quiet her; every object is di&s;gu&s;t|ing;
and &s;he hardly takes nouri&s;hment. A hun|dred
times each day &s;he pa&s;&s;es, between her
thighs and between her fore-feet, her bu&s;hy tail,
which &s;he &s;eizes by the end with her teeth, and
agitates perpetually, to give friction to the parts.</P>

it be two years and a half old.&endq;</P>

<P>THIS animal has been called <HI>Coati-mondi</HI>
by &s;everal authors. We have had it alive;
and, after comparing it with the Coati mentioned
by Thevet, and de&s;cribed by Marcgrave, we di&s;|covered
the Coati and Coati-mondi to be only
varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies; for Marcgrave, af|ter
de&s;cribing the coati, &s;ays expre&s;sly, that there
are other coati of a dark brown colour, called, for
the &s;ake of di&s;tinction, <HI>coati-mondi</HI> by the Bra&s;i|lians.
He admits not, therefore, any other dif|ference
between the coati and coati-mondi, but
that of the colour of the hair; and hence they
can only be regarded as varieties of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies.

The coati is very different from the raccoon
de&s;cribed in the preceding article. He is of a
&s;maller &s;tature; his body and neck, head, and
muzzle, are much longer; the upper jaw is ter|minated
by a kind of moveable &s;nout, which
&s;tretches an inch, or an inch and a half, beyond
the extremity of the under jaw. This turned up
&s;nout, joined to the length of the jaws, gives to
the muzzle a curved and elevated appearance.
The coati has al&s;o &s;maller eyes than the raccoon,
&s;horter ears, longer, coar&s;er, and le&s;s variegated
hair, &s;horter legs, and longer feet; and it re&s;ts
&s;till more upon the heel. Like the raccoon, it
has an annulated tail<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Some coatis have the tail of one uniform colour; but, as there are no other differences, they mu&s;t be con&s;idered only as varieties, and not as di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</NOTE>, and five toes on each foot.</P>
<P>Some authors regard the &s;ow-badger as a coati,
and have added to this genus the <HI>taxus &s;uillus</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;on. Regn. anim. p. 263.</NOTE>,
of which Aldrovandus has given a figure. But,
when it is con&s;idered, that the &s;ow-badger men|tioned
by hunters, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be found in
France, and even in colder European climates,
and that, on the contrary, the coati never appears
but in the &s;outhern climates of the New Conti|nent,
this notion mu&s;t be rejected, as having no
foundation to &s;upport it<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See what we remarked concerning the Taxus &s;uillus, ar|ticle Badger.</NOTE>; for the figure given
by Aldrovandus is nothing more than that of a
<PB N="55" REF="74">
badger, with the addition of a &s;ow's &s;nout. The
author pretends not to have drawn this animal
from nature; and he has given no de&s;cription of
it. The long muzzle and moveable &s;nout &s;uffi|ciently
di&s;tingui&s;h the coati from all other ani|mals.
Like the bear, the coati &s;tands with ea&s;e
on his hind-feet, re&s;ting upon his broad heels,
that are terminated by large callo&s;ities, which
extend outward, and augment the ba&s;e of the
feet.</P>
<P>The coati has a trick of gnawing his own tail,
which, when not mutilated, exceeds the length
of the body; he generally carries his tail erect,
and &s;weeps it about from &s;ide to &s;ide. This re|markable
practice of gnawing the tail is not,
however, peculiar to the coati; the monkeys, the
<HI>makis,</HI> and &s;ome other animals which have long
tails, &s;horten them one third, or one fourth, by
eating both the fle&s;h and the vertebrae. This
gave ri&s;e to a general conclu&s;ion, that, in very
long members, the extremities of which are, of
cour&s;e, removed to a great di&s;tance from the
centre of feeling, the &s;en&s;ation of feeling is weak,
and that this weakne&s;s of feeling is proportion|ed
to the di&s;tance and the thinne&s;s of the part;
for, if the extremity of the tail, in tho&s;e animals,
was very &s;en&s;ible, the pain excited would be
&s;tronger than the de&s;ire of mutilation, and they
would pre&s;erve their tails with equal anxiety as
the other parts of their bodies. Upon the whole,
<PB N="56" REF="75">
the coati is an animal of prey, who lives upon
fle&s;h and blood, and who, like the fox or martin,
devours &s;mall animals and fowls<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave, hi&s;t. Bra&s;il. p. 228.</NOTE>, eats eggs, and
hunts for the ne&s;ts of birds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thevet, Singular. de la France Antarct. p. 96.</NOTE>; and it is, pro|bably,
from this conformity of di&s;po&s;ition, rather
than from any re&s;emblance to the martin, that
the coati has been con&s;idered as a &s;mall &s;pecies of
the fox<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Seventh volume of the Tran&s;actions of the Swe|di&s;h Academy, we have the following remarks concerning the coati-mondi, by Linnaeus, which we &s;hall tran&s;cribe, without pretending to vouch the facts he delivers.</P>
<P>&startq;This animal,&endq; &s;ays Linnaeus, &startq;is <HI>equally</HI> numerous both in <HI>South</HI> and in <HI>North</HI> America. In the length of his hind-legs, the inclination of his head, the bu&s;hine&s;s of his hair, and in his paws, he re&s;embles the bear. But he is &s;mall and fa|miliar; and his tail is very long, and variegated with diffe|rent colours. The Prince of Sweden made a pre&s;ent of one of the&s;e animals to Linnaeus, who kept him a con&s;iderable time, but lo&s;t all the labour be be&s;towed in attempting to ci|vilize him; for the coati-mondi, when he could &s;lip into the court-yard, <HI>violating all the rights of ho&s;pitality,</HI> tore off the <HI>heads</HI> of the poultry, and <HI>drank</HI> their blood. He was &s;o ob|&s;tinate, that he would do nothing contrary to his inclination. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;mallne&s;s of this animal, he defended him&s;elf with great force, when any body attempted to &s;eize him again&s;t his will; and he &s;tuck fa&s;t to the legs of tho&s;e with whom he was familiar, when he wanted to <HI>ran&s;ack</HI> their <HI>poc|kets,</HI> and carry off what he found in them.

<P>THIS animal is about the &s;ize of a hare,
and has been regarded, by mo&s;t &s;y&s;tematic
writers, as a &s;pecies of rabbit, or large rat. The&s;e,
however, it re&s;embles in &s;ome minute characters
only; but, in natural di&s;po&s;itions, it differs e&s;|&s;entially
from them. It has the rudene&s;s of hair,
the grunting, and likewi&s;e the voracious appetite
<PB N="59" REF="80">
of a hog; and, when fully glutted, it conceals,
like the fox, the remainder of its food in different
places. The agouti delights in cutting and gnaw|ing
every thing he meets with. When irritated,
the hair of his back ri&s;es, and he &s;trikes the ground
forcibly with his hind-feet. His bite is cruel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This animal is very mi&s;chievous: The capuchins of Olinda in Bra&s;il brought up a young one, and u&s;ed the pre|caution of extracting his teeth; yet he continued to extend his deva&s;tations as far as his chain allowed him; <HI>Hi&s;t. des Indes par Souchu de Rennefort,</HI> p. 203.</NOTE>.
He digs not a hole, like the rabbit, nor &s;its on the
ground like the hare; but generally lives in the
hollows of decayed trees. Fruits, potatoes, and
manioc, are the common food of tho&s;e which live
near the habitations of men. But tho&s;e that live
in the woods and &s;avannahs, feed upon leaves
and roots, plants and &s;hrubs. The agouti, like
the &s;quirrel, u&s;es his fore-feet in holding his food,
and carrying it to his mouth. He runs very
nimbly both on plain and ri&s;ing grounds. But,
as his fore-legs are much &s;horter than his hind-legs,
he would tumble headlong, if he did not
&s;lacken his cour&s;e in de&s;cending. Both his eye
and his ear are fine. He &s;tops and li&s;tens to the
&s;ound of mu&s;ic. The fle&s;h of tho&s;e which are fat
and well fed, is not very bad, though it be hard,
and not very agreeable to the ta&s;te. They &s;cald
the agouti, and make him ready, in the &s;ame man|ner
as a pig. He is hunted with dogs. When
forced among the cut &s;ugar canes, he is &s;oon ta|ken;
becau&s;e the&s;e grounds being generally co|vered
<PB N="60" REF="81">
a foot thick with &s;traw and leaves, at each
leap he &s;inks in this litter, &s;o that a man may o|vertake
and &s;lay him with a baton. He com|monly
runs very nimbly before the dogs; and,
when he gains his retreat, he lies &s;quat, and re|mains
ob&s;tinately in his concealment. The hun|ters
are obliged to chace him out by filling his
hole with &s;moke: The animal, half &s;uffocated,
utters mournful cries; but never i&s;&s;ues forth, un|le&s;s
when pu&s;hed to the la&s;t extremity. His cry,
which he often repeats when di&s;turbed or irrita|ted,
re&s;embles that of a &s;mall hog. If taken
young, he is ea&s;ily tamed, and goes out and re|turns
of his own accord. The&s;e animals com|monly
re&s;ide in the woods and hedges; where
the females choo&s;e a place well covered and bu&s;hy,
and there prepare a bed of leaves and hay for
their young. They annually produce two or
three, but generally two<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des i&s;les Antilles, par le Pere du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 296.</NOTE>. Like the cats, they
tran&s;port their young, two or three days after birth,
into the hollows of trees, where they &s;uckle them
for a &s;hort time. The young are &s;oon in a con|dition
to follow their mother, and to &s;earch for
food. Thus their time of growth is &s;hort; and,
con&s;equently, the duration of their lives cannot
be very long.</P>
<P>The agouti appears to be an animal peculiar to
the &s;outhern parts of America, none of them be|ing
ever found in the old world. They are com|mon
<PB N="61" REF="82">
in Bra&s;il, in Guiana, in St Domingo, and in
all the i&s;lands. They &s;eem to require a warm
climate in order to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and to multiply. They
can live, however, in France, if kept in a dry
place, and &s;heltered from the winter fro&s;ts. Even
in America, they appear not in the temperate or
cold regions. In the i&s;lands there is only the
&s;pecies of agouti which we have de&s;cribed. But
at Cayenne, and in Guiana and Bra&s;il, a &s;econd
&s;pecies is mentioned, called <HI>Agouchi,</HI> which is
&s;aid to be uniformly &s;maller than the fir&s;t. But
we are a&s;&s;ured, by the evidence of people who
have lived long at Cayenne, and who know both
the agouti and agouchi, the latter of which we
have never been able to procure, that the animal
we have de&s;cribed is the true agouti. We had
it alive: It was as large as a rabbit; its hair was
rude, and of a brown colour, a little mixed with
red. Its upper lip was divided like that of the hare:
Its tail was &s;till &s;horter than the tail of the rabbit:
The ears were &s;hort and broad. The upper jaw
advanced beyond the under: The muzzle re|&s;embled
that of the dormou&s;e, and the teeth
tho&s;e of the marmot. The neck was long, and
the legs &s;lender: It had four toes on the fore,
and three on the hind-feet. Marcgrave and
mo&s;t naturali&s;ts after him, have a&s;&s;erted, that the
agouti had &s;ix toes on the hind-feet. M. Bri&s;&s;on
is the only writer who has not copied this error
of Marcgrave: Having de&s;cribed the animal
<PB N="62" REF="83">
from nature, he found, as we did, only three toes
on the hind-feet.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have little to add concerning the agouti:
M. de la Borde informs us, that, in Guiana, it is
the mo&s;t common quadruped, all the woods,
plains, heights, and even the mar&s;hes, being full
of them.</P>
<P>&startq;The Agouti,&endq; says he, &startq;is about the
&s;ize of a hare; his &s;kin is hard, and la&s;ts
very long when employed as an upper-leather
to &s;hoes. He has no grea&s;e: His fle&s;h is as
white, and nearly as good as that of the rabbit,
having the &s;ame ta&s;te and flavour. Whether old
or young, their fle&s;h is always tender; but tho&s;e
which inhabit the &s;ea-coa&s;t are be&s;t. They are
taken in traps, or hunted with dogs. The In|dians
and Negroes, who know how to allure
them by whi&s;tling, or imitating their cries, kill
as many of them as they plea&s;e. When pur&s;ued,
they conceal them&s;elves, like the rabbits, in the
holes of old trees. They hold their food in their
paws, like the &s;quirrels. Their ordinary food, which
they often conceal in the earth, to be u&s;ed occa|&s;ionally,
are the nuts of the maripa, of the tour|lovri,
of the corana, &amp;c.; and, after concealing
the&s;e nuts, they often touch them not for &s;ix

months. They multiply as fa&s;t as the rabbits,
producing three, four, and &s;ometimes five young
ones, during every &s;ea&s;on of the year. They
live not in numbers in the &s;ame hole; but they
are either found alone, or the mother with her
young. They are ea&s;ily tamed, and eat almo&s;t
every thing. When in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, they re|move
not to any great di&s;tance, and always re|turn
to the hou&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly. But they con|&s;tantly
retain a little of their &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition.
In general, they remain in their holes during the
night, unle&s;s the moon &s;hines bright; but they
run about during mo&s;t of the day. There are
&s;ome countries, as about the mouth of the river
of the Amazones, where the&s;e animals are &s;o

the rein-deer was never found in the &s;outh; and
perhaps no other &s;pecies but that of man is gene|rally
diffu&s;ed over the whole &s;urface of the globe.
Each has its peculiar country, to which it is con|fined
by a phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity; each is a genuine
&s;on of the country it inhabits; and it is in this
&s;en&s;e alone, that particular animals ought to be
called natives of a particular climate.</P>
<P>In warm countries, the land-animals are larger
and &s;tronger than in the frozen or temperate re|gions.
They are likewi&s;e more hardy and fe|rocious.
All their natural qualities &s;eem to ori|ginate
from the ardour of the climate. Lions,
born under the &s;corching heats of Africa or the
Indies, are the &s;tronge&s;t, the fierce&s;t, and the mo&s;t
formidable. Our wolves, and other carnivorous
animals, would hardly have the merit of being
his providers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is a &s;pecies of Lynx called <HI>the Lion's Provider.</HI></NOTE>. The lions of America, if they
de&s;erve that name, are, like the climate, infinitely
<PB N="66" REF="88">
more mild than tho&s;e of Africa; and, what proves
that the exce&s;s of their ferocity originates from
the exce&s;s of heat, is, that, in the &s;ame country,
tho&s;e who inhabit the high mountains, where the
air is temperate, differ in di&s;po&s;ition from tho&s;e
who live in the plains, where the heat is extreme.
The lions of Mount Atlas, the &s;ummit of which
is &s;ometimes covered with &s;now, have neither the
courage, the &s;trength, nor the ferocity of the lions
of Biledulgerid or of Zaara, who&s;e plains are co|vered
with burning &s;ands. It is chiefly in the&s;e
fervid de&s;erts that we meet with tho&s;e terrible
lions, who are the dread of travellers, and the
&s;courge of the neighbouring provinces. Happily
the &s;pecies is not numerous: It even appears to
dimini&s;h daily; for, from the te&s;timony of tho&s;e
who have traver&s;ed this part of Africa, the num|ber
of lions is not nearly &s;o great as formerly.
The Romans, &s;ays Mr Shaw<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels.</NOTE>, drew from Lybia,
for their public &s;pectacles, fifty times more lions
than could now be found in that country. It
has likewi&s;e been remarked, that, in Turkey,
Per&s;ia, and India, lions are much le&s;s frequent
than they were in antient times: And, as this
bold and powerful creature preys on every other
animal, and is him&s;elf a prey to none, the dimi|nution
of the &s;pecies can only be attributed to
the increa&s;e of the numbers of mankind; for, it
mu&s;t be allowed, that the &s;trength of the king of
animals is not match again&s;t the addre&s;s of a
<PB N="67" REF="89">
Hottentot or a Negro, who often attack him, face
to face, with very light weapons. The lion, ha|ving
no enemy but man, and his &s;pecies being
reduced to a fiftieth, or, if you will, to a tenth
part of its former &s;tandard, it follows, that the
human &s;pecies, in&s;tead of having &s;uffered any
con&s;iderable diminution &s;ince the time of the Ro|mans,
(as has been often alledged), is, on the con|trary,
increa&s;ed, even in &s;uch countries as Lybia,
where the power of man appeared to have been
greater during the aera of Carthage, than it is
now under that of Tunis and Algiers.</P>
<P>Man's indu&s;try augments in proportion to his
numbers; but that of the other animals remains
always the &s;ame. All the de&s;tructive &s;pecies, as
that of the lion, &s;eem to be bani&s;hed to di&s;tant
regions, or reduced to a &s;mall number, not only
becau&s;e mankind have increa&s;ed, but becau&s;e they
have al&s;o become more powerful, and have in|vented
formidable arms which nothing can re&s;i&s;t.
Would to God man had never combined the o|perations
of &s;teel and fire for other purpo&s;es than
tho&s;e of de&s;troying lions and tigers!</P>
<P>This &s;uperiority of man in numbers, and in
indu&s;try, which has impaired the force of the lion,
has likewi&s;e enervated his courage. Am&ograve;ng a|nimals,
this latter quality, though natural, ri&s;es
or falls according as the exertions of their
&s;trength are &s;ucce&s;sful or abortive. In the va&s;t
de&s;erts of Zaara, in tho&s;e which &s;eem to &s;eparate
two very different races of men, the Negroes and
<PB N="68" REF="90">
the Moors, in the unpeopled regions that lie a|bout
the territories of the Hottentots, and, in
general, in all tho&s;e &s;outhern parts of Africa and
A&s;ia, which man has di&s;dained to inhabit, the
lions are &s;till very numerous, and continue in
their natural &s;tate. Accu&s;tomed to mea&s;ure their
&s;trength with that of every animal they meet, the
habit of conquering renders them terrible and in|trepid.
Being ignorant of the power of man,
they are not afraid to encounter him. Having
never experienced the force of his arms, they
hold them in defiance. Wounds enrage, with|out
terrifying them. They are not di&s;concerted
even by the appearance of numbers. A &s;ingle lion
of the de&s;ert often attacks a whole caravan; and
if, after a violent and ob&s;tinate engagement, he
finds him&s;elf fatigued, in&s;tead of flying, he re|treats
fighting, always oppo&s;ing his face to the
enemy. Tho&s;e lions, on the other hand, who
dwell in the neighbourhood of the towns or vil|lages
of India or Barbary<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 2. p. 213. &amp; la relation du Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 2. p. 112.</NOTE>, being acquainted with
man, and the power of his arms, have lo&s;t their
native fortitude to &s;uch a degree, that they fly
from the threatenings of his voice, and dare not
attack him. They content them&s;elves with &s;eizing
&s;mall cattle, and even fly before the women and
children<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Afrique de Marmol, tom. 1. p. 54.</NOTE>, who make them indignantly quit their
prey, by &s;triking them with clubs.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="91">
This change, this &s;oftening in the temper of
the lion, indicates that he is &s;u&s;ceptible of the im|pre&s;&s;ions
he receives, and that he mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a
docility &s;ufficient to render him tameable to a
certain degree, and to admit of a &s;pecies of edu|cation:
And hi&s;tory informs us, that lions have
been yoked in triumphal cars, and conducted to
the battle or the chace; and that, faithful to
their ma&s;ters, they never exerted their &s;trength
or their courage but in oppo&s;ition to the com|mon
enemy. This much is certain, that the lion,
when taken young, and brought up among do|me&s;tic
animals, is ea&s;ily accu&s;tomed to live, and
even to &s;port innocently with them; that he is
gentle and care&s;&s;ing to his ma&s;ter; and that, if he
&s;ometimes re&s;umes his natural ferocity, he &s;eldom
turns his rage again&s;t his benefactors. As his
movements are impetuous, and his appetites ve|hement,
we ought not to pre&s;ume that they can
always be balanced by the impre&s;&s;ions of educa|tion.
It is dangerous, therefore, to allow him to
want food too long, or to irritate him unnece&s;&s;a|rily.
Bad treatment not only enrages him, but
he remembers it, and &s;eems to meditate revenge,
in the &s;ame manner as he remembers and requites
benefits received. Here I might quote a great
number of particular facts, &s;ome of which appear
to be exaggerated; but the whole, when combined,
are &s;ufficient to prove, that the anger of the lion is
noble, his courage magnanimous, and his temper
&s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions. He has often been
<PB N="70" REF="92">
known to di&s;dain the in&s;ults, and to pardon the of|fen&s;ive
liberties of weak enemies. When led in|to
captivity, he di&s;covers &s;ymptoms of unea&s;ine&s;s,
without anger or peevi&s;hne&s;s; on the contrary,
he a&s;&s;umes habits of gentlene&s;s, obeys his ma&s;ter,
care&s;&s;es the hand that feeds him, and &s;ometimes
pardons the animals which are thrown to him
for prey. By this act of genero&s;ity, he &s;eems to
con&s;ider him&s;elf as forever bound to protect them;
he lives peaceably with them, allows them a part,
and &s;ometimes the whole of his food, and will
rather &s;ubmit to the gnawings of hunger than
de&s;troy the fruit of his own beneficence.</P>
<P>The lion cannot ju&s;tly be branded with cruelty,
&s;ince he acts from nece&s;&s;ity, and kills no more
than he con&s;umes; while the tiger, the wolf, the
hyaena, and many other inferior &s;pecies, &s;uch as
the fox, the martin, the polecat, the ferret, &amp;c.
delight in &s;laughter, and &s;eem rather to gratify
their rage than their hunger.</P>
<P>The external appearance of the lion detracts
not from the noble and generous qualities of his
mind. His figure is re&s;pectable, his looks firm
and determined, his gait &s;tately, and his voice
tremendous. His bulk is not exce&s;&s;ive, like that
of the elephant or rhinoceros. He is not gro&s;s
and unwieldy, like the hippopotamus or the ox,
nor too contracted, like the hyaena or the bear,
nor lengthened to deformity, like the camel. The
body of the lion, on the contrary, is &s;o well poi&s;ed
and proportioned, that it may be regarded as a
<PB N="71" REF="93">
perfect model of &s;trength combined with agility:
Equally &s;olid and &s;pringy, neither &s;urcharged
with fat nor with fle&s;h, and containing nothing
&s;uperfluous, he &s;eems to be con&s;tituted entirely of
nerves and of mu&s;cles. This great mu&s;cular force
is manife&s;ted by the prodigious leaps and bounds
which he performs with ea&s;e; by the bri&s;k move|ments
of his tail, a &s;ingle &s;weep of which is &s;uf|ficient
to throw a man to the ground; by the
facility with which he moves the &s;kin of his face,
and e&s;pecially that of his front, which heightens
greatly the expre&s;&s;ion of fury; and, la&s;tly, by the
power of moving the hair of his mane, which he
not only erects, but agitates on all &s;ides, when he
is enraged.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e &s;plendid individual qualities of the
lion, we may add the noblene&s;s of his &s;pecies.
By noble &s;pecies in nature, I mean tho&s;e which are
con&s;tant, invariable, and liable to no &s;u&s;picion of
degradation. The&s;e &s;pecies are commonly &s;ingu|lar,
and of them&s;elves con&s;titute a genus. They
are di&s;tingui&s;hed by characters &s;o deeply marked,
that they can neither be mi&s;taken, nor confound|ed
with any other. To begin with man, who is
the noble&s;t being of the creation, his &s;pecies is
&s;ingle, &s;ince men of all races, of all climates, and
of all colours, can mix and propagate together;
and, at the &s;ame time, no animal can be &s;aid to
make any approaches to the human &s;pecies by
natural relation. In the hor&s;e, the &s;pecies is not
&s;o noble as the individual; becau&s;e he is &s;o nearly
<PB N="72" REF="94">
approached by the a&s;s, that a junction of the two
produces individuals, whom Nature treats as ba|&s;tards,
unworthy of the genuine race, and ren|ders
incapable of perpetuating either &s;pecies of
which they are the i&s;&s;ue; but, as proceeding from
a mixture of the two, they fail not to demon&s;trate
the great affinity between them. In the dog, the
&s;pecies is, perhaps, &s;till le&s;s noble, becau&s;e it
&s;eems to be allied to tho&s;e of the wolf, the fox,
and jackall, who may all be regarded as degene|rated
branches of the &s;ame family. In de&s;cend|ing
gradually to the inferior &s;pecies, as tho&s;e of
the rabbit, wea&s;el, rat, &amp;c. we &s;hall find, that
each particular &s;pecies has a number of collateral
branches, of which we are unable to di&s;cover the
genuine root. La&s;tly, in the in&s;ects, which ought
to be regarded as the lowe&s;t &s;pecies in Nature,
each kind is accompanied with &s;o many neigh|bouring
&s;pecies, that we are obliged to denomi|nate
them by genera only. This is the chief u&s;e
of methodical di&s;tributions, which ought not to be
employed, excepting in difficult enumerations of
the &s;malle&s;t objects in nature, but which become
totally u&s;ele&s;s, and even ridiculous, in treating of
the &s;uperior tribes. To cla&s;s man with the
monkey, or to &s;ay, that the lion is <HI>a cat with a
long mane and tail,</HI> is to degrade and disfigure,
in&s;tead of de&s;cribing or denominating the objects
of nature.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the lion, therefore, is one of the
mo&s;t noble, becau&s;e it is &s;ingle, and cannot be
<PB N="73" REF="95">
confounded with tho&s;e of the tiger, leopard,
ounce, &amp;c. The&s;e &s;pecies, which &s;eem to be the
lea&s;t removed from the lion, are &s;o little di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
from each other, that they have often
been confounded by travellers and methodi&s;ts<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the article Tiger, where we have mentioned &s;ome animals, to which this name has been improperly applied.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The large&s;t lions are about eight or nine feet
long, by four or five feet high, and the tail is a|bout
four feet long<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A very young lion, di&s;&s;ected by the gentlemen of the Academy, was &s;even and a half feet long, from the extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the tail, and four and a half feet high.</NOTE>. The &s;mall &s;ized lions are
about five and a half feet long, by three and a half
feet high, and the tail is about three and a half feet
in length. The lione&s;s, in all dimen&s;ions, is
about one fourth part le&s;s than the lion.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t anim. cap. 44.</NOTE> di&s;tingui&s;hes lions into the greater
and the &s;maller; the latter, he remarks, are pro|portionally
&s;horter in the body, have their hair
more cri&s;ped, and are le&s;s courageous than the
former. He adds, that, in general, all lions are
of a yellow colour. The fir&s;t of the&s;e facts
&s;eems to be doubtful; for no traveller mentions
lions with cri&s;ped hair: Some authors, who,
in other re&s;pects, appear not to merit entire con|fidence,
talk of a tiger with cri&s;ped hair, which is
found at the Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Les Mem. de Kolbe, in which he calls this animal the <HI>Wolf-tiger.</HI></NOTE>. But almo&s;t
all authors agree as to the colour of the lion,
<PB N="74" REF="96">
which is yellow on the back, and whiti&s;h on the
&s;ides and belly. Aelian and Oppian, however,
affirm, that the Ethiopian lions are as black as
the men; that, in India, there are lions entirely
white, and others &s;potted with different colours,
as red, black, and blue. But this &s;eems not to
be &s;upported by any authentic evidence; for
Marc-Paul, the Venetian, &s;peaks not of the&s;e
&s;potted lions as if he had &s;een them; and Ge&s;|ner<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, hi&s;t anim. quad. p. 574.</NOTE>
properly remarks, that he only followed
Aelian. It appears, on the contrary, that there
are little or no varieties in this &s;pecies; that the
lions of Africa and of A&s;ia are perfectly &s;imilar;
and that the lions of the mountains differ from
tho&s;e of the plains in &s;tature only, and not in
colour.</P>
<P>The lion has a mane, or rather long hair
which covers almo&s;t all the anterior parts of his
body<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This mane con&s;i&s;ts of hair equally &s;oft and &s;mooth as that of the re&s;t of the body.</NOTE>, and grows always longer as he advan|ces
in age. But the lione&s;s, however old, has no
mane. The American animal, called <HI>a Lion</HI> by
the Europeans, and <HI>Puma</HI> by the natives of Peru,
has no mane, and is al&s;o &s;maller, weaker, and le&s;s
courageous than the true lion. It is not impo&s;|&s;ible,
that the mildne&s;s of this region of fouth
America &s;hould have had &s;uch influence on the
nature of the lion, as to deprive him of his mane,
and dimini&s;h both his courage and his &s;tature.
But it &s;eems to be an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility, that
<PB N="75" REF="97">
this animal, who inhabits the countries within
the tropics only, and again&s;t whom nature ap|pears
to have &s;hut up every avenue to the north,
&s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed from the &s;outhern regions of A|&s;ia
or Africa into America, the&s;e continents being
divided from each other, towards the &s;outh, by
immen&s;e oceans. Hence we are led to conclude,
that the Puma is not a lion &s;prung from tho&s;e
of the old world, and degenerated by the in|fluence
of the climate of America, but that he is
an animal peculiar to America, like mo&s;t animals
of the new Continent. When the Europeans fir&s;t
di&s;covered America, they found the quadrupeds,
birds, fi&s;hes, in&s;ects, plants, and almo&s;t every
thing, perfectly different from tho&s;e of Europe.
It was, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to denominate the prin|cipal
objects of this new world. The names given
them by the natives were mo&s;tly barbarous, and
very difficult to pronounce or to remember. The
names of objects were, of cour&s;e, borrowed from
tho&s;e of the European languages, and e&s;pecially
from the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e. In this penury
of denomination, the &s;malle&s;t analogy in external
figure or in &s;tature is &s;ufficient to make us at|tribute
to unknown objects, the names of tho&s;e
with which we are acquainted. This gives ri&s;e
to endle&s;s uncertainties and confu&s;ion, which are
&s;till farther augmented, not only by giving to
the productions of the new world the denomi|nations
of tho&s;e of the old, but by the continual
tran&s;portation of European plants and animals
<PB N="76" REF="98">
into America. To obviate the&s;e difficulties, we
ought carefully to di&s;tingui&s;h what belongs to
the one continent, from what belongs to the o|ther,
and to avoid the deceptions originating
from improper denominations. We &s;hall per|ceive
the nece&s;&s;ity of this di&s;crimination in the
&s;ub&s;equent article, where an enumeration of
the animals peculiar to both continents &s;hall
be given.</P>
<P>M. de la Condamine, who&s;e evidence merits
the highe&s;t credit, &s;ays expre&s;sly, that he knows
not whether the American animal called <HI>a Lion</HI>
by the Spaniards, and <HI>Puma</HI> by the natives of
Quito, de&s;erves the name of a lion: He adds,
that it is much &s;maller than the African lion,
and that the male has no mane<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de l'Amerique Meridionale, p. 24.</NOTE>. Fre&s;ier like|wi&s;e
informs us, that the animals called <HI>Lions</HI> in
Peru, are very different from tho&s;e of Africa;
that they fly upon the approach of man; and that
they are dreadful only to the flocks: He farther
remarks, that their head &s;omewhat re&s;embles both
the head of the wolf and of the tiger; and that
their tail is le&s;s than the tail of either of the&s;e a|nimals<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le voyage de Fre&s;ier a la mer du &s;ud, p. 132.</NOTE>.
We learn, from more antient rela|tions<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Aco&s;ta, nat. hi&s;t. of the Indies.</NOTE>,
that the American lions have no re&s;em|blance
to tho&s;e of Africa; that they have neither
the &s;tature, nor the boldne&s;s of the true lion; that
they are neither red nor yellow, but of a gray
<PB N="77" REF="99">
colour; that they have no manes, and are accu|&s;tomed
to climb trees. Hence the&s;e animals dif|fer
from the lion in &s;tature, in colour, in the form
of the head, in the length of the tail, in the want
of manes, and in their manners and di&s;po&s;itions.
Characters &s;o numerous and &s;o e&s;&s;ential ought for|ever
to prevent us from confounding the Puma
of America with the genuine lion of Africa or of
A&s;ia.</P>
<P>Though this noble animal inhabits the warm|e&s;t
climates only, he can &s;ub&s;i&s;t for a great length
of time in temperate countries, and, perhaps, with
&s;ome attention, might even be enabled to propa|gate.
Ge&s;ner relates, that lions were brought
forth in the menagerie of Florence; and Wil|lough
by tells us, that, in Naples, a lione&s;s that
had been impregnated by a lion in the &s;ame den,
brought forth five whelps at one litter. The&s;e
examples are rare; but, if true, they prove that
lions are not ab&s;olute &s;trangers to a temperate
climate. None of them, however, exi&s;t in the
&s;outhern parts of Europe: In the age of Homer,
there were no lions in the Peloponne&s;us, although
they were then, and even in the days of Ari&s;totle,
in Thrace, in Macedonia, and in The&s;&s;aly. It is
apparent, therefore, that, in all ages, they prefer|red
the hot climates; that they &s;eldom lived in
temperate countries; and that they never inha|bited
the more northern regions. The natura|li&s;ts
above quoted, who &s;peak of lions brought
forth at Florence and Naples, are &s;ilent as to the
<PB N="78" REF="100">
time of the female's ge&s;tation, the &s;ize of the new|born
whelps, and the quickne&s;s or &s;lowne&s;s of
of their growth. Aelian<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, hi&s;t. quad. p. 575.</NOTE> limits the time of ge&s;|tation
to two months; but Philo&s;tratus and Ed|ward
Wotton<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. de differ. anim. cap. 80.</NOTE> extend it to &s;ix. I am inclined
to be of the latter opinon; for the lion is an a|nimal
of great magnitude; and we know, that,
in general, among large animals, the time of ge&s;|tation
is longer than among the &s;maller &s;pecies.
The &s;ame thing takes place with regard to the
growth of the body. Both antients and moderns
agree, that new-born lions are very &s;mall, being
about the &s;ize of a wea&s;el<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 80.</NOTE>, that is, &s;ix or &s;even
inches in length. They mu&s;t, therefore, require
&s;everal years before they can grow eight or nine
feet long. The young lions are likewi&s;e &s;aid to
be two months old before they can walk. With|out
giving implicit faith to the&s;e facts, we may,
with probability, pre&s;ume, that the lion, from the
largene&s;s of his body, mu&s;t require three or four
years for acquiring his full growth, and that he
ought to live about &s;even times three or four
years, or nearly to the age of twenty-five. The
Sieur de St Martin, ma&s;ter of the bull-fights at Paris,
a&s;&s;ures me, that he has kept lions &s;ixteen or &s;even|teen
years; and he imagines that they live not
above the age of twenty or twenty-two. He
has kept others twelve or fifteen years; and it is
<PB N="79" REF="101">
well known that their lives mu&s;t be abridged, and
their conftitution weakened, by the want of ex|erci&s;e,
con&s;inement, and chagrin.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle affirms, in two different parts of his
works<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;t. de Generatione, lib. 3. cap. 2. et 10.</NOTE>, that the lione&s;s produces five or &s;ix
whelps at the fir&s;t litter, four or five at the &s;e|cond,
three or four at the third, and two or three
at the fourth; and that, after this la&s;t litter,
which is always the lea&s;t numerous, &s;he becomes
barren. This a&s;&s;ertion merits no credit; for, in
all animals, the fir&s;t and la&s;t litters are le&s;s nu|merous
than the intermediate ones. This philo&s;o|pher
erred, as well as all the naturali&s;ts who came
after him, when he maintained that the lione&s;s had
only two paps; for it is now certain that &s;he has
four. He likewi&s;e affirms<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. 4. cap. 6.</NOTE>, that the lion, the
bear, and the fox, are brought forth in an un|formed
&s;tate: But it is now pa&s;t a doubt, that
the&s;e creatures are as well formed at birth as any
other animals, and that all their members are
di&s;tinctly unfolded. La&s;tly, he affirms, that the
lions copulate in a rever&s;ed manner<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Anim. lib. 5. cap. 2. Linn. Sy&s;t. p. 60. Leo retro mingit et coit.</NOTE>; but, from
a bare in&s;pection of the parts of the male, it is
evident, that the lion mu&s;t copulate in the ordi|nary
way of other quadrupeds. I have men|tioned
the&s;e &s;light errors of Ari&s;totle, becau&s;e the
authority of this great man has deceived all the
<PB N="80" REF="102">
writers on natural hi&s;tory &s;ince his time. What
he remarks of the lion's neck being compo&s;ed of
one rigid and inflexible bone, has al&s;o been con|tradicted
by experience; for, in every quadruped,
without exception, and even in man, the neck
con&s;i&s;ts preci&s;ely of &s;even vertebrae. It is ano|ther
general fact, that the necks of carnivorous
animals are &s;horter than tho&s;e of the frugivo|rous,
and particularly of the ruminating &s;pecies.
But this difference in the length of the neck de|pends
on the largene&s;s of each vertebra, and not
on their number, which is always the &s;ame, from
the elephant to the mole. With regard to the
&s;olidity of the lion's bones, which Ari&s;totle af|firms
to have neither marrow nor cavity; to
their hardne&s;s, which he compares to that of
flint; and to their property of &s;triking fire with
&s;teel; the&s;e blunders ought not to have been re|peated
by Kolbe<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 4.</NOTE>; nor &s;hould they have come
down to our time; &s;ince, even in the days of
Ari&s;totle, they were ridiculed by Epicurus.</P>
<P>The lions are exceedingly ardent in their a|mours.
When the female is in &s;ea&s;on, &s;he is
&s;ometimes followed by eight or ten males<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, Hi&s;t. quad. p. 575.</NOTE>, who
ince&s;&s;antly roar around her, and engage in the
mo&s;t furious combats, till one of them conquers
all the re&s;t, and retires in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
his mate. The lione&s;s brings forth in the &s;pring<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>,
and produces but once in the year; which &s;hows
<PB N="81" REF="103">
that &s;he is occupied for &s;ome months in &s;uckling
and taking care of her young; and, con&s;equent|ly,
that the time of their growing, during which
they need the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the mother, is at lea&s;t
&s;everal months.</P>
<P>In the&s;e animals, all the pa&s;&s;ions, even tho&s;e
of the &s;ofte&s;t kind, are exce&s;&s;ive. The maternal
affection of the lione&s;s is extreme. Though na|turally
weaker, and le&s;s courageous than the
lion, whenever &s;he has young, &s;he becomes
dreadfully ferocious. She then expo&s;es her&s;elf
with more boldne&s;s than the lion; &s;he knows no
danger; &s;he attacks, indi&s;criminately, men and
every other animal; and, after &s;laying them,
carries them home to her whelps, whom &s;he
&s;oon accu&s;toms to &s;uck the blood and tear the
fle&s;h. She commonly brings forth in places the
mo&s;t &s;eque&s;trate and inacce&s;&s;ible; and, when
afraid of being di&s;covered, &s;he conceals the
tracks of her feet, by returning &s;everal times on
her &s;teps, or effaces them with her tail. When
her anxiety is great, &s;he &s;ometimes tran&s;ports
her young to a different place; and, if the hun|ters
attempt to force them from her, &s;he becomes
perfectly furious, and defends them to the la&s;t
extremity.</P>
<P>The lion, it is alledged, has neither the &s;en&s;es
of &s;melling nor of &s;eeing &s;o acute as mo&s;t ani|mals
of prey. The light of the &s;un &s;eems to
incommode him; he &s;eldom goes abroad in the
middle of the day, but makes all his excur&s;ions
<PB N="82" REF="104">
during the night: When he &s;ees the fires burn|ing
around the flocks, he never approaches
them. It has al&s;o been remarked, that he per|ceives
not the odour of other animals at a di|&s;tance;
that he hunts only by the eye, and not
by the &s;cent, like the dog and the wolf, who&s;e
&s;en&s;e of &s;melling is finer. Even the name of
<HI>Guide,</HI> or <HI>Lion's Provider,</HI> has been given to a
&s;pecies of lynx, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a pier|cing
eye and exqui&s;ite &s;cent; and, it is &s;aid, that
this lynx always follows or precedes the lion, to
point out his prey. We are acquainted with
this animal, who, like the lion, inhabits Arabia,
Lybia, &amp;c. and who &s;ometimes follows the lion
with a view to pick up what he leaves; for,
being &s;maller, and much weaker, he &s;hould ra|ther
fly from the lion than &s;erve him.</P>
<P>The lion, when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, boldly
attacks every animal that comes in his way.
But, as he is extremely formidable, and is an|xiou&s;ly
avoided by every bea&s;t of the fore&s;t, he
is often obliged to lie concealed in the ways
where animals commonly pa&s;s. He lies &s;quat
on his belly among bru&s;h-wood, from which he
darts with &s;uch force, that he often &s;eizes his
prey at the fir&s;t bound. In the de&s;erts and fo|re&s;ts,
antelopes and monkeys are his common
food, though he only takes the latter when upon
the ground; for he climbs not trees like the tiger
or the Puma<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Klein de Quad. p. 82.</NOTE>. He devours as much at a time
<PB N="83" REF="105">
as will &s;erve him two or three days. His teeth
are &s;o &s;trong, that he breaks bones with ea&s;e,
and &s;wallows them along with the fle&s;h. He is
&s;aid to &s;upport hunger very long. As his tem|perament
is exceedingly hot, he is impatient of
thir&s;t, and drinks as often as he finds water,
which he laps like a dog. The tongue of the
dog, when lapping, is bended upwards; but that
of the lion is bended downward, which occa|&s;ions
him to drink long, and to lo&s;e much water.
He requires about fifteen pounds of raw fle&s;h
every day. He prefers the fle&s;h of living ani|mals,
e&s;pecially of tho&s;e whom he &s;lays him&s;elf.
He does not willingly eat putrid carca&s;&s;es, and
choo&s;es rather to hunt for a fre&s;h prey than to
u&s;e the remains of a former. Though he com|monly
feeds upon fre&s;h meet, his breath is very
rank, and the odour of his urine is in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>The roaring of the lion is &s;o &s;trong, that,
when uttered during the night in the de&s;erts, it
re&s;embles, by the repetition of ecchos, the noi&s;e
of thunder<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de la Boulaye-le-Gouz, p. 320.</NOTE>. This roaring is the ordinary
voice of the lion; for, when enraged, he utters a
&s;hort, and &s;uddenly repeated cry. But the
roaring is a prolonged cry, a kind of a deep|toned
grumbling, mixed with a &s;harp vibrating
noi&s;e. He roars five or &s;ix times in the day,
and oftener before rain<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e facts I learned from the Sieur Saint-Martin, ma&s;|ter of the bull-fights, who has kept &s;everal lions.</NOTE>. When enraged, his
<PB N="84" REF="106">
cry is &s;till more terrible than his roaring. He
then beats his &s;ides and the earth with his tail,
agitates his mane, moves the &s;kin of his face and
his large eye-brows, &s;hows his dreadful tu&s;ks,
and thru&s;ts out his tongue, which is armed with
prickles &s;o hard, that it alone is &s;ufficient to tear
the &s;kin and the fle&s;h, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
either teeth or claws. His &s;trength lies more
in the head, jaws, and fore-legs, than in the po&s;|terior
parts of his body. He &s;ees in the night,
like the cats. His &s;leep is &s;hort, and he is ea&s;ily
awaked. But it is a mi&s;take to &s;ay that he &s;leeps
with his eyes open.</P>
<P>The ordinary pace of the lion is bold, grave,
and &s;low, though always oblique. His cour&s;e
con&s;i&s;ts not of equal movements; but is perform|ed
by leaps and bounds; and his motions are &s;o
bri&s;k, that he cannot in&s;tantly &s;top, but general|ly
&s;urpa&s;&s;es his aim. When he leaps on his prey,
he makes a &s;pring of twelve or fifteen feet, falls
above the victim, &s;eizes it with his fore-feet,
tears it in pieces with his claws, and then de|vours
it with his teeth. While young and nimble,
he lives by hunting, and &s;eldom quits the de&s;erts
or the fore&s;ts, where finds plenty of wild ani|mals
for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But, when he grows
old, heavy, and le&s;s fit for the exerci&s;e of hunt|ing,
he approaches frequented places, and be|comes
more dangerous to man and the dome&s;tic
animals. It has, indeed, been remarked, that,
<PB N="85" REF="107">
when he &s;ees men and animals together, he at|tacks
the latter, and never the former, unle&s;s any
man &s;trikes him; for, in this ca&s;e, he is wonder|fully
alert in di&s;tingui&s;hing the per&s;on who hurts
him; and he in&s;tantly quits his prey to take
vengeance on the offender. It is alledged, that
he prefers the fle&s;h of the camel to that of all
other animals. He is likewi&s;e very fond of
young elephants. As they are unable to re&s;i&s;t
him till their tu&s;ks are grown, he accompli&s;hes
his purpo&s;e with ea&s;e, unle&s;s the mother comes
to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The elephant, the rhinoce|ros,
the tiger, and the hippopotamus, are the on|ly
animals which can re&s;i&s;t the fury of the lion.</P>
<P>This animal, however formidable, is hunted
with large dogs, &s;upported by men on hor&s;e|back,
who di&s;lodge him, and make him retire.
But both the dogs and the hor&s;es require to be
previou&s;ly trained; for mo&s;t animals tremble
and fly from the odour of the lion. His &s;kin,
though of a clo&s;e and firm texture, re&s;i&s;ts neither
a ball nor a javeline. He is &s;eldom, however,
killed with a &s;ingle blow. He is often taken, as
we take wolves, by making him fall into a deep
pit, covered with limber materials, and upon
which a live animal is tied. The lion becomes
gentle as &s;oon as he is &s;eized; and, if advantage
be taken of the fir&s;t emotions of his &s;urpri&s;e and
&s;hame, he may be chained, muzzled, and con|ducted
at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="108">
The fle&s;h of the lion has a &s;trong a di&s;a|greeable
flavour; yet it is frequently eaten by
the Indians and Negroes. The &s;kin, which was
formerly the robe of heroes, &s;erves tho&s;e people

<HEAD>OF TIGERS.</HEAD>
<P>TIGER being a generic name given to &s;e|veral
animals of different &s;pecies, we &s;hall
begin with di&s;tingui&s;hing them from each other.
The leopards and panthers, which are &s;o often
confounded, have both been called <HI>Tigers</HI> by mo&s;t
travellers. The ounce, a &s;mall &s;pecies of panther,
which is ea&s;ily tamed, and u&s;ed for hunting in
the Ea&s;t, has been mi&s;taken for the panther, and
received the general denomination of <HI>Tiger.</HI> The
lynx, and the lion's provider, by the Turks called
<HI>Karackoulah,</HI> and by the Per&s;ians <HI>Siyahgu&s;h,</HI> have
&s;ometimes al&s;o received the appellation of <HI>Pan|ther</HI>
or of <HI>Ounce.</HI> All the&s;e animals are com|mon
in Africa, and in the &s;outhern regions of
A&s;ia. But the true tiger is a rare animal, little
known to the antients, and not well de&s;cribed by
the moderns. Ari&s;totle makes no mention of
the tiger: Pliny only ob&s;erves of him, that he is
an animal of a&s;toni&s;hing fleetne&s;s,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Animal tremendae velocitatis; <HI>Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. 8. c.</HI> 18.</NOTE>, and adds,
that he was much more rarely to be met with
than the panther, becau&s;e Augu&s;tus fir&s;t pre&s;ent|ed
a tiger to the Romans at the dedication of the
theatre of Marcellus, while, in the days of Scau|rus,
this Aedile pre&s;ented 150 panthers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. 8. c. 17.</NOTE>, and af|terwards
Pompey exhibited 410, and Augu&s;tus
<PB N="88" REF="112">
420, at the public &s;pectacles of Rome. But
Pliny gives not a &s;ingle mark by which the tiger
is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed: Oppian<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Oppian, lib. 1. de venatione, ubi ait: Orynges alios decorari toeniis oblongis tigrium in&s;tar, alios vero rotundis ut panthera.&mdash;Tigres (ait Solinus) be&s;tias in&s;ignes maculis notae et pernicitas memorabiles riddiderunt, fulvo nitent, hoc ful|vum nigricantibus &s;egmentis inter-undatum,</NOTE> and Solinus,
who wrote after Pliny, appear to have been the
fir&s;t who mention that the tiger is characterized
by long &s;tripes, and the panther by round patches.
This is, indeed, one of the marks which di&s;tingui&s;h
the true tiger not only from the panther, but
from &s;everal other animals that have been cal|led
tigers. Strabo<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strab. lib. 15.</NOTE> quotes Mega&s;thenus on the
&s;ubject of the true tiger, who tells us, that, in In|dia,
there are tigers twice as large as the lion.
Thus the only notices we have from the antients,
concerning this remarkable animal, are, that he
is extremely ferocious and fleet; that his body is
marked with long &s;tripes; and that he exceeds
the lion is magnitude. The moderns, as Ge&s;|ner,
and other naturali&s;ts, who mention the tiger,
have added nothing to the little that had been
ob&s;erved by the antients.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e &s;kins which have &s;hort hair and
roundi&s;h and di&s;tinct &s;pots, have been called tigers
&s;kins; and travellers, deceived by this fal&s;e de|nomination,
have indi&s;criminately named every
ferocious animal, thus &s;potted, by the appellation
of <HI>tigers.</HI> The academy of &s;ciences were like|wi&s;e
<PB N="89" REF="113">
mi&s;led by this prejudice; and, to all the
&s;potted animals they di&s;&s;ected, though very dif|ferent
from the genuine tiger, they have given
the &s;ame denomination.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t general cau&s;e of the multiplication
of equivocal and vague terms in natural hi&s;tory,
has ari&s;en, as &s;hall be more fully demon&s;trated in
the following article, from the nece&s;&s;ity of giving
names to the unknown productions of the New
World. Many animals, merely from &s;ome
&s;light re&s;emblances to tho&s;e of the Old Con|tinent,
though very different, both in &s;pecies
and di&s;po&s;itions, have had the &s;ame names im|po&s;ed
on them. The error of calling every &s;pot|ted
animal a <HI>tiger,</HI> began in Europe, and was
tran&s;ported to America, where it was doubly aug|mented.
For &s;potted quadrupeds being di&s;co|vered
in this new country, they were in&s;tantly
called <HI>tigers,</HI> though they neither belonged to the
&s;pecies of the true tiger, nor to any of tho&s;e A&s;i|atic
or African animals who had fal&s;ely received
that name. Hence, in place of one &s;pecies of
tiger, their number has been increa&s;ed to nine or
ten; and, con&s;equently, the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e dif|ferent
animals has been greatly embarra&s;&s;ed, what
belongs to one &s;pecies being often a&s;cribed to an|other.</P>
<P>To di&s;pel the confu&s;ion ari&s;ing from the&s;e fal&s;e
denominations, e&s;pecially among the animals which
have been commonly called tigers, I &s;hall give a
comparative enumeration of quadrupeds, in which
<PB N="90" REF="114">
I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h, 1. Tho&s;e which are peculiar to
the Old World, and exi&s;ted not in America upon
its fir&s;t di&s;covery; 2. Tho&s;e which are peculiar to
the New, and were unknown in the Old World;
3. Tho&s;e which are common to both continents,
without being tran&s;ported by men from the one
to the other. For this purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t collect
into one view what lies &s;cattered in the works of
the fir&s;t hi&s;torians of America.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS PECULIAR TO THE OLD WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>As the large&s;t animals are be&s;t known, and
liable to the fewe&s;t uncertainties, we &s;hall, in this
enumeration, trace them nearly in the order of
their magnitude.</P>
<P>Elephants are peculiar to the Old World; the
large&s;t are produced in A&s;ia, and the &s;malle&s;t in
Africa. They are natives of the warme&s;t re|gions;
and, though they are capable of exi&s;ting,
yet they cannot multiply, in temperate climates.
Even in their native country, they propagate not,
after being deprived of their liberty. Though
entirely confined to the warm regions of the Old
Continent, their numbers are con&s;iderable. In
America, there is not an animal that can be com|pared
to the elephant, either for figure or mag|nitude.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark applies to the rhinoceros,
who&s;e &s;pecies is much le&s;s numerous than that
of the elephant. He is peculiar to the de&s;erts of
<PB N="91" REF="115">
Africa, and to the fore&s;ts of the &s;outhern regions
of A&s;ia; and no American animal has the &s;malle&s;t
re&s;emblance to him.</P>
<P>The hippopotamus inhabits the banks of the
large rivers of India and Africa. His &s;pecies
is perhaps &s;till le&s;s numerous than that of the
rhinoceros; and he is not to be found in Ame|rica,
nor in the temperate climates of the Old
World.</P>
<P>The camel and dromedary, who are &s;o com|mon
in A&s;ia, in Arabia, and in all the ea&s;tern
regions of the Old Continent, were equally un|known
in America as the elephant, the rhinoceros,
and the hippopotamus. The appellation of <HI>ca|mel</HI>
has been given to the Lama<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Camelus glama, corpore laevi, topho pectorali; <HI>Linn. Sy&s;t. p.</HI> 91. Camelus pilis brevi&s;&s;imus ve&s;titus; <HI>Bri&s;&s;on.

from the camel, that, by &s;ome, they have been
called <HI>&s;heep,</HI> and by others <HI>camels</HI> of Peru, and
though the pacos has nothing in common
with our &s;heep, but the wool, and the lama re|&s;embles
the camel only by the length of its neck.
The Spaniards formerly tran&s;ported real camels
to Peru<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Hi&s;t. nat. des Indes par Jo&s;. Aco&s;ta, p. 44.&mdash;208. l'Hi&s;t. des Incas tom. 2. p. 266.</NOTE>: But the climate of this New World
was not favourable to the&s;e animals; for, al|though
<PB N="92" REF="116">
they produced, their numbers never be|came
con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The giraffe<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Giraffa quam Arabes Zurnapa, Graeci et Latini Camelo|pardalin nominant; <HI>Bellon. Ob&s;. p.</HI> 118.</NOTE>, or camelopard, an animal re|markable
for the height of its &s;tature, and the
length of its neck and fore-legs, is not to be found
in America. It is a native of Africa, particular|ly
Ethiopia, and has never &s;pread beyond the
Tropics into the temperate regions of the Old
World.</P>
<P>We have &s;een, in the preceding article, that
the lion exi&s;ts not in America, and that the puma
of Peru is an animal of a different &s;pecies. We
&s;hall likewi&s;e find, that the tiger and panther are
peculiar to the Antient Continent, and that the
animals of South America, who have received
the&s;e names, are different &s;pecies. The true tiger
is a terrible animal, and perhaps more to be dread|ed
than the lion him&s;elf. His ferocity is tre|mendous;
and we may judge of his &s;trength by
his &s;ize, which is commonly from four to five
feet high, by nine, ten, thirteen or fourteen feet
long, without comprehending the tail. His &s;kin
is not variegated with round &s;pots, but with black
bands on a yellow ground, which extend tran&s;|ver&s;ely
over the whole body, and form rings on
his tail from one end to the other. The&s;e cha|racters
are &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h the tiger from
all the carnivorous animals of the New World,
the large&s;t of which &s;carcely exceed the &s;ize of
our ma&s;ti&s;&s;s or grey-hounds. The leopard and
<PB N="93" REF="117">
panther of Africa and A&s;ia, are not nearly &s;o
large as the tiger, and yet they are much larger
than the rapacious animals of South America.
Pliny, who&s;e te&s;timony cannot be que&s;tioned, as
panthers were in his time expo&s;ed in great num|bers
at the public &s;hews of Rome, points out the
e&s;&s;ential characters of this animal, by telling us,

The American animals who have been called

and is a native of Guiana, Bra&s;il, and other re|gions

named this animal the <HI>pard</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pardus an Lynx Bra&s;ilien&s;is, jaguara dicta; <HI>Marcgrav. Ray, Synop&s;. quad. p.</HI> 166.</NOTE>, or <HI>lynx</HI> of
Bra&s;il. The Portugue&s;e called him <HI>once</HI> or <HI>an&ccedil;a,</HI>
becau&s;e they had given that name improperly,
fir&s;t to the lynx, and afterwards to the &s;mall pan|ther
of India. The French, without rea&s;on, have
called it a <HI>tiger</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gros tigre da la Guiane; <HI>De&s;marchais, tom. 3. p.</HI> 299. Le Tigre d'Amerique; <HI>Bri&s;&s;on. Regn. anim. p.</HI> 270.</NOTE>; for it has no affinity to that
<PB N="94" REF="118">
animal. It differs from the panther al&s;o in the
&s;ize of its body, the figure and &s;ituation of its
&s;pots, the colour and length of its hair, which
is cri&s;ped when young, and is always rougher
than that of the panther. Neither does it re|&s;emble
this animal in its di&s;po&s;itions and manners;
it is more &s;avage, and cannot be tamed. The&s;e
differences, however, hinder not the jaguar of
Bra&s;il from re&s;embling the panther, more than
any other animal of the Old World. The &s;econd
we &s;hall call <HI>couguar,</HI> by contracting the Bra&s;ilian
name <HI>cuguacu-ara</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Cuguacu-ara; <HI>Pi&s;on. Hi&s;t. Nat. Ind. p.</HI> 104. Le Tigre rouge; <HI>Barrere. hi&s;t. Fr. equin. p.</HI> 165; <HI>Bri&s;&s;on, Regn. anim. p.</HI> 272.</NOTE>, pronounced by the natives
<HI>cougouacou-ara.</HI> The French have, with &s;till
more impropriety, called this animal the <HI>red tiger.</HI>
It re&s;embles the true tiger in nothing, and differs
very much from the panther, having its hair of a
red colour, without &s;pots. The form of the
head is likewi&s;e different, and the muzzle is long|er
than that of the tiger or panther. A third
&s;pecies, which has al&s;o obtained the name of <HI>ti|ger,</HI>
and is equally removed from that &s;pe|cies
with the preceding animals, is the jagua|rete<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jaguarete; <HI>Pi&s;on. Hi&s;t. Nat. Ind.</HI> p. 103. Once, a &s;pecies of tiger; <HI>De&s;marchais, tom. 3. p.</HI> 300. The black tiger; <HI>Bri&s;&s;on. Regn. anim. p.</HI> 271.</NOTE>.
This animal is nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize
with the jaguar, and re&s;embles him in na|tural
di&s;po&s;itions; but differs from him in &s;ome
external characters. He has been called the
<HI>black tiger,</HI> becau&s;e his hair is blacki&s;h, inter&s;per|&s;ed
<PB N="95" REF="119">
with &s;pots &s;till blacker than tho&s;e of the ja|guar.
Be&s;ide the&s;e three &s;pecies, and perhaps a
fourth, commonly called tigers, there is another
American animal that has a greater re&s;emblance
to the tiger, namely the mountain cat, related
both to the cat and panther, and which is more
properly marked by this compound appellation,
than by its Mexican name, <HI>tlacoo&s;clotl</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hernandez Hi&s;t. Mex. p. 512. Chat-pard; <HI>Hi&s;t. l'Acad. des &s;ciences, tom. 3. part. 1. p.</HI> 109; <HI>Bri&s;&s;on, Regn. anim, p.</HI> 273.</NOTE>. It is
&s;maller than the jaguar, jaguarete, or couguar, but
larger than the wild cat, which it re&s;embles in
figure, though its tail is much &s;horter, and its
hair variegated with black &s;pots, which are ob|long
on the back, and circular on the belly. The
jaguar, jaguarete, couguar, and mountain cat, are
therefore American animals, which have improper|ly
been named <HI>tigers.</HI> We have &s;een the couguar
and mountain cat alive, and know them to be
very different in &s;pecies; but they are &s;till more
different from that of the tiger and panther.
With regard to the puma and jaguar, it is evi|dent,
from the de&s;criptions of tho&s;e who have &s;een
the&s;e animals, that the puma is not a lion, nor the
jaguar a tiger. Thus we may pronounce with
confidence, that the lion, the tiger, and even the
panther, are no more to be found in America,
than the elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopo|tamus,
the giraffe, and the camel. All the&s;e &s;pe|cies
require a warm climate for the purpo&s;es of
propagation; and, having never inhabited nor|thern
<PB N="96" REF="120">
regions, could not convey them&s;elves in|to
America. This general fact is too important
not to be &s;upported by every proof that can be
produced: We &s;hall, therefore, continue our com|pari&s;on
of the animals of the Old World with
tho&s;e of the New.</P>
<P>Every body knows that hor&s;es, when fir&s;t
tran&s;ported to America, &s;truck the natives not
only with &s;urpri&s;e, but with terror; and that
the&s;e animals have thriven and multiplied as fa&s;t
in America as in Europe<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Antilles, par Tertre, tom. 2. p. 289.</NOTE>. The &s;ame remark
applies to the a&s;s, from which mules have been
produced, that are more u&s;eful for every kind of
carriage than the Lama, particularly in the moun|tainous
parts of Chili and Peru.</P>
<P>The zebra<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Zebra; <HI>Ray, Synop&s;. quad. p. 69. Edwards, p. 27. Bri&s;&s;on. Regn. anim. p.</HI> 101. A&s;ne Sauvage; <HI>Kolbe, tom. 3. p.</HI> 22.</NOTE> is an animal peculiar to the Old
World, and which, perhaps, has never been &s;een
in the New. It &s;eems to be confined to a par|ticular
climate, and is found no where but in
that part of Africa which extends from the Equa|tor
to the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>Horned cattle were found neither in the i&s;lands
nor on the continent of South America. Soon
after the di&s;covery of the&s;e countries, bulls and
cows were tran&s;ported from Europe by the Spa|niards.
In 1550, they, for the fir&s;t time labour|ed
the ground with oxen in the valley of Cu&s;co<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 266.</NOTE>.
The&s;e animals multiplied prodigiou&s;ly on the
<PB N="97" REF="121">
Continent, as well as in the i&s;lands of St Domin|go,
Cuba, &amp;c.; and even became wild in &s;everal
places. The &s;pecies of horned cattle, which we
call Bi&s;on, found in Mexico, Loui&s;iana<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de. Nouveau Monde, par Jean Laet, liv. 10. ch. 4.</NOTE>, &amp;c. be|longs
not to the European race. The bi&s;on ex|i&s;ted
in America before our horned cattle were
tran&s;ported thither. He is &s;o different from the
latter, that he may be regarded as con&s;tituting a
&s;eparate &s;pecies. He has a fle&s;hy protuberance
between his &s;houlders; his hair is &s;ofter than
wool, longer on the fore-part of his body than
the hind, and curled upon the neck and along the
&s;pine of the back. It is of a brown colour, ob|&s;curely
marked with &s;ome whiti&s;h &s;pots. The
bi&s;on has, be&s;ides, &s;hort legs, which, like the head
and neck, are covered with long hair. The male
has a long tail, terminating in a bu&s;h of hair, like
that of the lion. Though the&s;e di&s;tinctions have
appeared to me, as well as to all other naturali&s;ts,
&s;ufficient to con&s;titute the bi&s;on and our horned
cattle of different &s;pecies, yet I will not pre&s;ume
to determine this point; becau&s;e the e&s;&s;ential
characteri&s;tic of animals being of the &s;ame &s;pecies,
is the faculty of a regular and uninterrupted pro|pagation
of their kinds; and this fact, with re|gard
to the bi&s;on and our horned cattle, has ne|ver
hitherto been &s;ubjected to the te&s;t of experi|ment.
Mon&s;. de la Nux, coun&s;ellor of the royal
council of the i&s;land of Bourbon, has favoured
me with a letter, dated 9th October 1759, in
which he informs me, that the bi&s;on propagates
<PB N="98" REF="122">
with the common horned cattle; and, it were to
be wi&s;hed, that per&s;ons living in the&s;e countries
would imitate the example of this gentleman, in
making experiments upon animals. It would
be ea&s;y for the inhabitants of Loui&s;iana to try to
make the American bi&s;on copulate with the Eu|ropean
cow, or the European bull with the fe|male
bi&s;on. Such commixtures might, perhaps, be
fruitful; and, in that ca&s;e, we would be a&s;&s;ured
that the European horned cattle, the bunch|backed
&s;pecies of the i&s;land of Bourbon, the Ea&s;t-India
bull, and American bi&s;on, con&s;titute but
one &s;pecies. From the experiments of Mon&s;. de
la Nux, it is apparent, that the bunch is not an
e&s;&s;ential character, becau&s;e, after &s;ome genera|tions,
it entirely vani&s;hes. Be&s;ides, I have di&s;co|vered
that this bunch or protuberance, which ap|pears
on the camel as well as the bi&s;on, is a com|mon,
but not a permanent character, and ought
to be regarded as an accidental variety, depend|ing,
perhaps, on the con&s;titution of the body;
for I have &s;een a meager &s;ickly camel which had
no ve&s;tige of a bunch. The other character of
the American bi&s;on namely, long &s;oft hair, ap|pears
to be only a difference ari&s;ing from the in|fluence
of climate, in the &s;ame manner as we ob|&s;erve
its effect on our goats, cats, and rabbits,
when compared to tho&s;e of Angora, which,
though very different in regard of their hair, are
neverthele&s;s of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Hence it is
probable, (e&s;pecially if the American bi&s;on pro|duces
with European cows) that our horned cat|tle
<PB N="99" REF="123">
mu&s;t formerly have pa&s;&s;ed from the northern
regions contiguous to tho&s;e of North America,
and that, having afterwards &s;pread into the tem|perate
regions of the New World, they a&s;&s;umed
with time the impre&s;&s;ions of the climate, and
became real bi&s;ons. But, till this e&s;&s;ential cha|racter
of generation be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, we mu&s;t
&s;till conclude, that our cow and bull is a &s;pecies
peculiar to the Antient Continent, and exi&s;ted
not in America till they were tran&s;ported thither.</P>
<P>America has &s;till le&s;s preten&s;ions to the &s;heep<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>.
The&s;e animals were tran&s;ported from Europe, and
have &s;ucceeded both in the warm and temperate
climates. But, though equally prolific, they are
commonly more meager<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pi&s;on. Marcgrav.</NOTE>, and their fle&s;h le&s;s
&s;ucculent and tender than that of the European
&s;heep. The climate of Bra&s;il &s;eems to be mo&s;t
favourable to them; for that is the only region
of the New World where they become exce&s;&s;ive|ly

&s;ucceeded. The&s;e two &s;pecies belong entirely
to the Old Continent.</P>
<P>Neither is the goat a native of America. The
numerous flocks now found there have all pro|ceeded
from tho&s;e which were tran&s;ported. At
Bra&s;il, the goat has not multiplied &s;o fa&s;t as the

goats were &s;o rare, that they were &s;old
for 110 ducats a-piece<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>; but they afterwards be|came
&s;o numerous, that they were &s;old for little
more than the value of the &s;kin. In that coun|try,
they produce three, four, and &s;ometimes five
kids at a time, while, in Europe, they produce
only one or two. The large and &s;mall American
i&s;lands are equally repleni&s;hed with goats as the
Continent. They have even been carried by the
Spaniards to the i&s;lands of the South Sea; and in
the i&s;land of Juan Fernandez<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">An&s;on's voyage.</NOTE>, particularly, they
have been extremely fertile. But, as they fur|ni&s;hed
provi&s;ions to the pirates who afterwards
infe&s;ted the&s;e &s;eas, the Spaniards re&s;olved to ex|tirpate
them from the i&s;land; and, for this purpo&s;e,
left a number of dogs, which having likewi&s;e
multiplied in their turn, de&s;troyed the goats in
every acce&s;&s;ible part of the i&s;land, and became
&s;o ferocious, that they actually attacked men.</P>
<P>The wild boar, the dome&s;tic hog, and that of
China, which con&s;titute but one &s;pecies, and
multiply &s;o plentifully in Europe and A&s;ia, are
not natives of America. The Mexican hog,
which has an aperture in its<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tajacu; <HI>Pi&s;on. Ind. p.</HI> 98.&mdash;Tajacu, aper Mexicanus mo&s;|chiferus; <HI>Ray, Synop&s;. quad. p.</HI> 97.&mdash;Le Sanglier du Mexique; <HI>Bri&s;&s;on, Regn. anim. p.</HI> 111.</NOTE> back, is the ani|mal
in America that approaches neare&s;t to the
common &s;pecies. I have &s;een it alive, and have
attempted, in vain, to make it produce with the
<PB N="101" REF="125">
European &s;ow. Their characters, be&s;ides, are &s;o
different, that there is good rea&s;on to pronounce
them of a different &s;pecies. The hogs tran&s;port|ed
from Europe to America have &s;ucceeded bet|ter,
and multiplied fa&s;ter, than the &s;heep or goat.
The fir&s;t &s;wine, &s;ays Garcila&s;&s;o<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 266.</NOTE>, &s;old at Peru
&s;till dearer than the goats. The fle&s;h of the ox
and &s;heep, according to Pi&s;o<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pi&s;on. hi&s;t. nat. Bra&s;il.</NOTE>, is not &s;o good at
Bra&s;il as in Europe; but the hogs are better, and
multiply fa&s;ter; and Laet remarks<NOTE N="Dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. de nouveau monde, par Jean Laet, chap. 4. p. 5.</NOTE>, that tho&s;e
of St Domingo have al&s;o improved &s;o as to ex|ceed
tho&s;e of Europe. In general, it is allowed,
that, of all dome&s;tic animals tran&s;ported from
Europe to America, the hog has mo&s;t univer|&s;ally
&s;ucceeded. In Canada, as well as in Bra|&s;il,
which includes the colde&s;t and warme&s;t
climates of the New World, they produce and
multiply, and their fle&s;h is equally good. The
goat, on the contrary, has multiplied in the warm
or temperate countries only, and cannot &s;upport
the &s;pecies in Canada: It is for this rea&s;on, that,
though numbers of them are brought from Eu|rope,
they &s;till continue to be rare in that coun|try.
The a&s;s, which multiplies in Bra&s;il, Peru,
&amp;c. is unable to multiply in Canada, where nei|ther
mules nor a&s;&s;es, though many couples of the
latter have been from time to time tran&s;ported
thither, are to be &s;een. The cold &s;eems to de|prive
them of that vigour of con&s;titution, that
<PB N="102" REF="126">
natural ardour, by which, in warm-climates, they
are &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed from other animals.
Hor&s;es have multiplied nearly in an equal man|ner
over all the regions of America. They ap|pear
to have only dimini&s;hed in &s;ize<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir Hans Sloane's hi&s;t. of Jamaica.</NOTE>. But that
is common to them with all the other animals
brought from Europe to America; for, in Ca|nada,
the ox, the goat, the &s;heep, the hog, the
dog, are &s;maller than in France; and, what is &s;till
more &s;ingular, all the native American animals
are, in general, much &s;maller than tho&s;e of the
Old Continent. In this New World, Nature &s;eems
to have operated upon a &s;maller &s;cale: Man a|lone
has been copied after the &s;ame model. But,
before mentioning the facts which &s;upport this
ob&s;ervation, we mu&s;t fini&s;h our enumeration.</P>
<P>The hog, as we have &s;een, is not a native of
America, but was tran&s;ported thither; and he has
not only multiplied there in a dome&s;tic &s;tate,
but has become wild in many places, where he
multiplies in the woods, like our wild boars<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. nat. des Indes, par Jo&s;eph Aco&s;ta, p. 44.</NOTE>,
without the aid of man. A &s;pecies of hogs, dif|ferent
from tho&s;e of Europe, have likewi&s;e been
tran&s;ported from Guiney to Bra&s;il<NOTE N="Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pi&s;on. hi&s;t. nat. Bra&s;il.</NOTE>, where they
have increa&s;ed. This Guiney hog, which is
&s;maller than the European kind, has long point|ed
ears, and a tail that almo&s;t trails on the ground.
It is not covered with bri&s;tles, but with &s;hort hair,
<PB N="103" REF="127">
and appears to be a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from that
of Europe; for we have never learned from
Bra&s;il, where the ardour of the climate favours
every kind of propagation, that the two &s;pecies
have intermixed, or even produced mules.</P>
<P>The dog, who&s;e races are &s;o various, and &s;o uni|ver&s;ally
diffu&s;ed, appear not in America but by a
kind of &s;pecimens, which it is difficult to compare
with the whole &s;pecies. At St Domingo, there
were &s;mall animals called <HI>go&s;ques,</HI> which re&s;em|bled
little dogs. But Garcila&s;&s;o affirms, that
they had no dogs &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Europe. He
adds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. des Incas, tom. 2. p. 322.</NOTE>, that the European dogs, which had been
tran&s;ported to Cuba and St Domingo, and be|came
wild, had dimini&s;hed the number of cattle,
which had al&s;o become wild; and that the&s;e dogs
hunt in packs of ten or twelve, and are equally
de&s;tructive as the wolves. There are no genuine
dogs, &s;ays Jo&s;eph Aco&s;ta<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. nat. des Indes, p. 46. l'Hi&s;t. du Nouveau Monde, par Jean Laet, lib. 10. chap. 5.</NOTE>, in the we&s;t Indies,
but only animals re&s;embling &s;mall dogs, called <HI>alcos</HI>
in Peru, and which attached them&s;elves to their
ma&s;ters, and had nearly the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions
with the dog. If Father Charlevoix<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. de l'i&s;le Saint Domingue, par le Pere Charlevoix, tom. 1. p. 35.</NOTE> merits
credit, who quotes no authority, &startq;the <HI>go&s;chis</HI>
of St Domingo were &s;mall dumb dogs, which
&s;erved for the amu&s;ement of the ladies<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Were there any ladies in St Domingo when it was di&s;|covered?</NOTE>. They
<PB N="104" REF="128">
were al&s;o u&s;ed for hunting other animals by
the &s;cent. They made excellent eating<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The fle&s;h of the dog is by no means good for eating.</NOTE>, and
were a great &s;upply to the Spaniards when the
fir&s;t famines happened; &s;o that, if great numbers
had not afterwards been brought from the con|tinent,
the &s;pecies would have been exhau&s;ted.
There were &s;everal kinds of them; the hair of
&s;ome was &s;mooth and &s;hining; others had their
bodies covered with very &s;oft wool; and the
greate&s;t number had only a kind of tender,
thin down. The varieties in their colour &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed
even tho&s;e of our dogs.&endq;</P>
<P>If ever this &s;pecies of <HI>go&s;chis</HI> exi&s;ted, with the
qualities a&s;cribed to it by Father Charlevoix,
why has it been pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence by other
authors? And why do not the&s;e animals, which,
according to him, were not only &s;pread over
the i&s;land of St Domingo, but &s;everal places of
the Continent, no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t? Or, if they do
&s;ub&s;i&s;t, why have they lo&s;t all their beautiful
peculiarities? It is probable, that the <HI>go&s;chis</HI> of
Charlevoix, who&s;e name he never met with but
in the writings of Father Pers, is the <HI>go&s;ques</HI> of
Garcila&s;&s;o. Perhaps, likewi&s;e, the <HI>go&s;ques</HI> of St
Domingo, and the alco of Peru, are the &s;ame ani|mal;
and it &s;eems to be certain, that this animal
is more allied to the European dog, than any o|ther
American quadruped. Some authors have
regarded it as the genuine dog. Jean Laet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L'Hi&s;t. du Nouveau Monde, par Jean Laet, lib. 15. chap. 15.</NOTE> &s;ays,
<PB N="105" REF="129">
in expre&s;s terms, that, upon the di&s;covery of the

But this lo&s;s is &s;upplied by a &s;ort of howl|ing;

with the animals of the Old Continent, but of|ten
borrowed from relations too remote to ju&s;tify
&s;uch denominations. Five or &s;ix &s;pecies of &s;mall
animals were regarded as hares, for no other

<P>We have &s;een, that all our dome&s;tic animals,

<P>The antelopes, who&s;e &s;pecies are numerous,

<PB N="110" REF="134">
never &s;tretched into the northern parts of Eu|rope,
&s;o as to enable them to pa&s;s over to Ame|rica.
Hence the&s;e African and A&s;iatic &s;pecies
were not found in the New World. The Bar|bary
antelope &s;eems indeed to have been tran&s;port|ed
thither, and Hernandes calls it <HI>algazel</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hernandes, hi&s;t. du Mexique, p. 512.</NOTE> <HI>ex A|phrica.</HI>

from all the antelopes of the Old Continent.</P>
<P>It is natural to imagine, that the chamois goat,
which delights in the Alpine &s;nows, would not
avoid the frozen regions of the north, and might,
therefore, have pa&s;&s;ed over to America; yet it
is not to be found there. This animal &s;eems
not to affect a peculiar climate, but a particular
&s;ituation. He is fond of the &s;ummits of the
Alps, Pyrennees, &amp;c.; and, in&s;tead of &s;pread|ing
farther, has never de&s;cended to the plains
at the foot of tho&s;e mountains. This is not the
only animal which dwells perpetually in the
&s;ame climate and &s;ituation. The marmot, the
wild goat, the bear, and the lynx, are al&s;o moun|tain
animals, and rarely appear in the plains.</P>
<P>The buffalo, which is a native of warm cli|mates,

<HEAD>OF ANIMALS PECULIAR TO THE NEW
WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>The animals of the New World were equally
unknown to the Europeans, as ours were to the
natives of America. In the New Continent, the
only half-civilized people were the Peruvians and
Mexicans. The latter had no dome&s;tic animals;
but the former had reduced to &s;lavery the lama,
the pacos, and the alco, a &s;mall creature re|&s;embling
a little dog. The pacos and the lama,
to which Fernandes gives the name of <HI>peruich|catl</HI>
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Peruich-catl; Fernandes, Hi&s;t. Nov. Hi&s;p. p.</HI> 11. Camelus Peruanus <HI>glama</HI> dictus; <HI>Ray, Synop&s;. quad.</HI> p. 145.

<PB N="113" REF="137">
frequent only the highe&s;t mountains, as tho&s;e of
Peru, Chili, and New Spain. Though they had
become dome&s;tic in Peru, and, of cour&s;e, had
been &s;pread over the adjacent countries; yet, in|&s;tead
of multiplying in the place of their nati|vity,
their number has dimini&s;hed &s;ince the Eu|ropean
cattle, which have &s;ucceeded wonderfully
in all the &s;outhern regions of America, were
tran&s;ported thither.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular, that, in a world almo&s;t totally
occupied by &s;avages, who&s;e manners approached
to tho&s;e of the brute creation, there &s;hould have
been no &s;ociety or corre&s;pondence between the&s;e
&s;avage men and the animals which &s;urrounded
them; for no dome&s;tic animals appear, without
&s;ome degree of civilization. Does it not fol|low,
that man, in the &s;avage &s;tate, is only a
&s;pecies of animal, incapable of governing others,
and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing only his individual faculties, em|ploys
them for procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and pro|viding
for his &s;afety, by attacking the weak, and
avoiding the &s;trong animals, without any de&s;ire
of reducing them to &s;ubordination? In every
nation, though only half-civilized, we meet with
dome&s;tic animals. In France, the hor&s;e, the a&s;s,
the ox, the &s;heep, the goat, the hog, the dog,
and the cat; in Italy, the buffalo; in Lapland,
the rain-deer; in Peru, the lama, the pacos, and
the alco; in the ea&s;tern countries, the drome|dary,
the camel, other &s;pecies of the ox, the
&s;heep, and the goat; in the &s;outhern regions, the
<PB N="114" REF="138">
elephant; all the&s;e have been reduced to &s;ervi|tude,
or rather admitted into &s;ociety; while the
&s;avage, who hardly wi&s;hes for the &s;ociety of his
female, either fears or di&s;dains that of other ani|mals.
It is true, none of the &s;pecies we have
rendered dome&s;tic, exi&s;ted in America. But, if
the &s;avages with whom it was peopled had an|tiently
united, and diffu&s;ed the mutual know|ledge
and re&s;ources of &s;ociety, they would have
&s;ubjugated almo&s;t all the animals of that coun|try,
mo&s;t of them being of gentle, tractable, and
timid di&s;po&s;itions, very few ferocious, and none
formidable. Hence the&s;e animals have avoided
the &s;lavery of a dome&s;tic &s;tate neither by the
fiercene&s;s of their nature, not the indocility of
their tempers. Their liberty has re&s;ulted &s;olely
from the weakne&s;s of man, who&s;e powers are
extremely circum&s;cribed without the aid of &s;o|ciety,
upon which even the multiplication of his
&s;pecies depends. The immen&s;e territories of the
New World contained not, upon its fir&s;t di&s;co|very,
a greater number of inhabitants than what
are to be found in one half of Europe. This
&s;carcity of the human &s;pecies allowed the other
animals to multiply prodigiou&s;ly. They had
fewer enemies and more &s;pace: Every circum|&s;tance
was favourable to their increa&s;e; and each
&s;pecies, accordingly, con&s;i&s;ted of a va&s;t number
of individuals. But the number of the &s;pecies,
when compared with tho&s;e of the Old Conti|nent,
was not above one fourth, or one third.
<PB N="115" REF="139">
If we reckon that 200 &s;pecies of quadrupeds ex|i&s;t
in the whole known quarters of the globe<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus, in his la&s;t edition, enumerates only 179, and Bri&s;&s;on 260: But more than 60 of the&s;e &s;hould be retrench|ed, being only varieties, and not di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</NOTE>,
we &s;hall find above 130 of them in the Old Con|tinent,
and le&s;s than 70 in the New; and, if
we &s;ubtract the &s;pecies common to both Conti|nents,
or tho&s;e which, by their con&s;titution, were
able to endure the rigours of the North, and pa&s;|&s;ed
by land from the one Continent to the other,
the New World cannot claim above 40 native
&s;pecies. In America, therefore, animated Na|ture
is weaker, le&s;s active, and more circum&s;cri|bed
in the variety of her productions; for we
perceive, from the enumeration of the American
animals, that the number of &s;pecies is not only
fewer, but that, in general, all the animals are
much &s;maller than tho&s;e of the Old Continent.
No American animal can be compared with the
elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the
dromedary, the camelopard, the buffalo, the lion,

much larger: He has no tu&s;ks or canine
teeth; and the upper lip is very long and move|able
at plea&s;ure. The lama is not &s;o large as

animal by con&s;picuous and e&s;&s;ential characters.

&s;pecies, or varieties, make a near approach to the
monkeys with long tails, having, like them,
hands, but longer and &s;harper muzzles, and are al&s;o
peculiar to the Old Continent. Thus all the a|nimals
of Africa and the &s;outh of A&s;ia, which
have received the names of <HI>apes</HI> or <HI>monkeys,</HI> are
no more to be found in America than the ele|phant,

<P>The more minutely we inquire into this &s;ub|ject,
we will be the more convinced that the ani|mals
of the &s;outhern regions of the one Con|tinent
exi&s;ted not in the other, and that the few
<PB N="123" REF="147">
which are now found there, were tran&s;ported by
man, as the Guiney &s;heep, which has been carried
to Bra&s;il; the Guiney-pig, which was brought from
Bra&s;il into Guiney, and, perhaps, &s;ome other
&s;mall animals, the tran&s;portation of which was
facilitated by the commerce and &s;mall di&s;tance
of the&s;e two parts of the globe. Between the
coa&s;t of Guiney and that of Bra&s;il, there are a|bout
500 leagues of &s;ea; and there are more than
2000 between the coa&s;t of Peru and the Ea&s;t-Indies.
All tho&s;e animals which, from their na|ture,
cannot endure cold climates, and even tho&s;e
which, though they could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, cannot produce
in &s;uch climates, are confined, on two or three
&s;ides, by &s;eas, which they are unable to traver&s;e,
and, on the other, by countries &s;o cold, that they
cannot live in them. Hence we ought not to
wonder at this general fact, which at fir&s;t ap|peared
&s;ingular, and was never before &s;o much
as &s;u&s;pected, namely, that none of the animals
which are natives of the Torrid Zone of the one
Continent, are to be found in the other.</P>

<HEAD>OF ANIMALS COMMON TO BOTH CONTINENTS.</HEAD>
<P>From the preceding enumeration, it appears, that
not only the quadrupeds in the warme&s;t climates
of Africa and A&s;ia, but mo&s;t of tho&s;e in the tem|perate
regions of Europe, are wanting in Ame|rica.
But &s;everal of our animals which can en|dure
<PB N="124" REF="148">
cold, and multiply in the northern climates,
are found in North America: And, though they
differ con&s;iderably, we are obliged to acknow|ledge
them to be the &s;ame, and to believe that
they formerly pa&s;&s;ed from the one Continent to
the other by lands, which are &s;till unknown, or
rather have long &s;ince been &s;wallowed up by the
ocean. This proof, drawn from natural hi&s;tory,
is a &s;tronger demon&s;tration of the almo&s;t conti|nued
contiguity of the&s;e two Continents, than
all the conjectures of &s;peculative geographers.</P>
<P>The bears of the Illionois, of Loui&s;iana, &amp;c.
appear to be the &s;ame with ours; only the for|mer
are &s;maller and blacker.</P>
<P>The &s;tag of Canada, though le&s;s than ours,
differs from him only by the greater height of his
horns, more numerous antlers, and a longer tail.</P>
<P>The roebuck, which is found in the &s;outh of
Canada and in Loui&s;iana, is likewi&s;e &s;maller, and
has a longer tail than the European kind. The
Orignal is the &s;ame animal with the elk, though
it is not equally large.</P>
<P>The rain-deer of Lapland, the fallow-deer of
Greenland, and the caribou of Canada, appear
to be the &s;ame animal. The fallow-deer or &s;tag
of Greenland, de&s;cribed and painted by Edwards<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Nat, hi&s;t. of birds, p. 51.</NOTE>,
has too great a re&s;emblance to the rain-deer to
be regarded as a different &s;pecies. As to the
caribou, though there is no exact de&s;cription of it;
yet, from the marks we have been able to col|lect,
<PB N="125" REF="149">
it &s;eems to be the &s;ame animal with the rain-deer.
M. Bri&s;&s;on<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;on. Regn. animal. p. 91.</NOTE> has made the caribou a diffe|rent
&s;pecies, and refers it to the <HI>cervus Burgun|dicus</HI>
of John&s;ton. But this <HI>cervus Burgundicus</HI>
is an unknown animal, and certainly never exi&s;ted
either in Burgundy or in Europe: It is a &s;imple
name that has been given to &s;ome uncommon
horns of the &s;tag or fallow-deer; or rather M.
Bri&s;&s;on may have &s;een the head of the caribou,
who&s;e horns con&s;i&s;ted of one &s;traight &s;tem on
each &s;ide, about ten inches long, with an antler
or branch near the ba&s;e, turned forwards; or the
head of a female rain-deer; or a head of the fir&s;t
or &s;econd year; for the female rain-deer bears
horns as well as the male, though much &s;maller,
and, in both, the direction of the fir&s;t antlers is
forward; and, la&s;tly, in this animal, as well as
in all others of the deer kind, the ramifications of
the horns are exactly proportioned to the num|ber
of years they have lived.</P>
<P>The hares, the &s;quirrels, the hedgehogs, the
otters, the marmots, the rats, the &s;hrew-mice,
and the moles, are al&s;o &s;pecies common to the
two Continents, though, in all the&s;e kinds, there
is not an American &s;pecies perfectly &s;imilar to
tho&s;e of Europe; and it is extremely difficult, if
not impo&s;&s;ible, to pronounce with certainty
whether they are really different &s;pecies, or only
varieties of the &s;ame, changed by the influence
of the climate.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="150">
The beavers of Europe appear to be the &s;ame
with tho&s;e of Canada. Though the&s;e animals
prefer cold countries, they can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and even
multiply, in temperate climates. There are &s;till
&s;ome of them in France upon the i&s;lands of the
Rhone. Their number was formerly much
greater; and they &s;eem to avoid populous coun|tries
more than very warm climates. They never
e&s;tabli&s;h their &s;ocieties but in de&s;erts remote from
the habitations of men: And, even in Canada,
which may be con&s;idered as a va&s;t de&s;ert, they
have retired far from any of our &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>The wolf and fox are al&s;o common to both
continents. They are found, but with &s;ome va|rieties,
in all parts of North America, where there
are black foxes and wolves; but all of them are
&s;maller than tho&s;e of Europe, which is the ca&s;e
with every animal, whether native or tran&s;|ported.</P>
<P>Though the wea&s;el and ermine frequent the
cold countries of Europe, they are at lea&s;t very
rare in America; but the pine-wea&s;el, the mar|tin,
and the polecat are more numerous.</P>
<P>The pine-wea&s;el of North America appears to
be the &s;ame with ours. The vi&s;on, or pekan
wea&s;el of Canada, has a great re&s;emblance to the
martin; and the &s;triped polecat of North Ame|rica
is perhaps only a variety of the European
kind.</P>
<P>The American lynx &s;eems to be the &s;ame
with the European. He prefers cold countries;
<PB N="127" REF="151">
but he likewi&s;e lives and multiplies in temperate
climates, and generally frequents the fore&s;ts and
high mountains.</P>
<P>The &s;eal, or &s;ea-calf, &s;eems to be confined to
northern countries, and is found equally on the
coa&s;ts of Europe and of North America.</P>
<P>The&s;e are nearly all the animals which are
common to the Old and New Worlds; and from
this number, which is not con&s;iderable, we ought,
perhaps, to retrench more than a third part,
who&s;e &s;pecies, though apparently the &s;ame, may
be different in reality. But, admitting the iden|tity
of all the&s;e &s;pecies with tho&s;e of Europe, the
number common to the two continents is very
&s;mall, when compared with that of the &s;pecies
peculiar to each. It is farther apparent, that,
of all the&s;e animals, it is tho&s;e only which fre|quent
the northern countries that are common
to both Continents; and that none of tho&s;e
which cannot multiply in warm or temperate
climates are found in both worlds.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, no longer a doubtful point,
that the two Continents either are, or have for|merly
been, contiguous towards the north, and
that the animals common to both have pa&s;&s;ed
from the one to the other by lands with which
we have now no acquaintance. We are led to
believe, e&s;pecially &s;ince the di&s;coveries made by
the Ru&s;&s;ians to the north of Kamt&s;chatka, that
the lands of A&s;ia are contiguous to tho&s;e of
America; for the north of Europe &s;eems to have
<PB N="128" REF="152">
been always &s;eparated from the New World by
&s;eas too con&s;iderable to permit the pa&s;&s;age of a|ny
quadruped. The&s;e animals, however, of
North America, are not preci&s;ely the &s;ame with
tho&s;e of the north of A&s;ia; but have a &s;tronger
re&s;emblance to the quadrupeds of the north of
Europe. It is the &s;ame with the animals which
belong to the temperate climates. The argali,
or Siberian goat, the &s;able, the Siberian mole,
and the Chine&s;e Mu&s;k, appear not in Hud&s;on's
bay, nor in any other north-we&s;t part of the New
Continent; but, on the contrary, we find, in
the north-ea&s;t parts of it, not only the animals
common to the north of Europe and A&s;ia, but
likewi&s;e tho&s;e which appear to be peculiar to
Europe, as the elk, the rain-deer, &amp;c. It mu&s;t,
however, be acknowledged, that the north-ea&s;t
parts of A&s;ia are &s;o little known, that we can
have no certainty whether the animals of the
north of Europe exi&s;t there or not.</P>
<P>We formerly remarked, as a &s;ingular phaeno|menon,
that the animals in the &s;outhern provin|ces
of the New Continent, are &s;mall in propor|tion
to tho&s;e in the warm regions of the Old.
There is no compari&s;on between the &s;ize of the
elephant, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the
camelopard, the camel, the lion, the tiger, &amp;c. and
the tapir, the cabiai, the ant-eater, the lama, the
puma, the jaguar, &amp;c. which are the large&s;t qua|drupeds
of the New World: The former are
four, &s;ix, eight, and ten times larger than the
<PB N="129" REF="153">
latter. Another ob&s;ervation brings additional
&s;trength to this general fact: All the animals
which have been tran&s;ported from Europe to A|merica,
as the hor&s;e, the a&s;s, the ox, the &s;heep,
the goat, the hog, the dog, &amp;c. have become
&s;maller; and tho&s;e which were not tran&s;ported,
but went thither &s;pontaneou&s;ly, tho&s;e, in a word,
which are common to both Continents, as the
wolf, the fox, the &s;tag, the roebuck, the elk,
&amp;c. are al&s;o con&s;iderably le&s;s than tho&s;e of Eu|rope.</P>
<P>In this New World, therefore, there is &s;ome
combination of elements and other phy&s;ical
cau&s;es, &s;omething that oppo&s;es the amplification
of animated Nature: There are ob&s;tacles to the
developement, and perhaps to the formation of
large germs. Even tho&s;e which, from the kind|ly
influences of another climate, have acquired
their complete form and expan&s;ion, &s;hrink and
dimini&s;h under a niggardly &s;ky and an unproli|fic
land, thinly peopled with wandering &s;avages,
who, in&s;tead of u&s;ing this territory as a ma&s;ter,
had no property or empire; and, having &s;ub|jected
neither the animals nor the elements, nor
conquered the &s;eas, nor directed the motions of
rivers, nor cultivated the earth, held only the fir&s;t
rank among animated beings, and exi&s;ted as a
creature of no con&s;ideration in Nature, a kind of
weak automaton, incapable of improving or &s;e|conding
her intentions. She treated them ra|ther
like a &s;tepmother than a parent, by refu&s;ing
<PB N="130" REF="154">
them the invigorating &s;entiment of love, and
the &s;trong de&s;ire of multiplying their &s;pecies.
For, though the American &s;avage be nearly of
the &s;ame &s;tature with men in poli&s;hed &s;ocieties;
yet this is not a &s;ufficient exception to the gene|ral
contraction of animated Nature throughout
the whole Continent. In the &s;avage, the organs
of generation are &s;mall and feeble. He has no
hair, no beard, no ardour for the female. Though
nimbler than the European, becau&s;e more accu|&s;tomed
to running, his &s;trength is not &s;o great.
His &s;en&s;ations are le&s;s acute; and yet he is more
timid and cowardly. He has no vivacity, no
activity of mind. The activity of his body is
not &s;o much an exerci&s;e or &s;pontaneous motion,
as a nece&s;&s;ary action produced by want. De|&s;troy
his appetite for victuals and drink, and you
will at once annihilate the active principle of all
his movements: He remains in &s;tupid repo&s;e, on
his limbs or couch, for whole days. It is ea&s;y
to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of the &s;cattered life of &s;a|vages,
and of their e&s;trangement from &s;ociety.
They have been refu&s;ed the mo&s;t precious &s;park
of Nature's fire: They have no ardour for
women, and, of cour&s;e, no love to mankind.
Unacquainted with the mo&s;t lively and mo&s;t
tender of all attachments, their other &s;en&s;ations
of this nature are cold and languid. Their love
to parents and children is extremely weak. The
bonds of the mo&s;t intimate of all &s;ocieties, that
of the &s;ame family, are feeble; and one family
<PB N="131" REF="155">
has no attachment to another. Hence no union,
no republic, no &s;ocial &s;tate, can take place among
them. The phy&s;ical cau&s;e of love gives ri&s;e to
the morality of their manners. Their heart is
frozen, their &s;ociety cold, and their empire cruel.
They regard their females as &s;ervants de&s;tined to
labour, or as bea&s;ts of burden, whom they load
unmercifully with the produce of their hunting,
and oblige, without pity or gratitude, to perform
labours which often exceed their &s;trength. They
have few children, and pay little attention to
them. Every thing mu&s;t be referred to the fir&s;t
cau&s;e: They are indifferent, becau&s;e they are
weak; and this indifference to the &s;ex is the o|riginal
&s;tain which di&s;graces Nature, prevents her
from expanding, and, by de&s;troying the germs
of life, cuts the root of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Hence man makes no exception to what has
been advanced. Nature, by denying him the
faculty of love, has abu&s;ed and contracted
him more than any other animal. But, before
examining the cau&s;es of this general effect, it
mu&s;t be allowed, that, if Nature has dimini&s;hed
all the quadrupeds in the New World, &s;he &s;eems
to have cheri&s;hed the reptile and enlarged the
in&s;ect tribes; for, though at Senegal there are
longer &s;erpents and larger lizards than in South
America, yet the difference between the&s;e ani|mals
is not near &s;o great as that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
between the quadrupeds. The large&s;t &s;erpent
of Senegal is not double the &s;ize of the Cayenne
<PB N="132" REF="156">
&s;erpent. But the elephant is perhaps ten times
the bulk of the tapir, which is the large&s;t qua|druped
of South America. With regard, how|ever,
to in&s;ects, they are no where &s;o large as in
South America. The large&s;t &s;piders, beetles,
caterpillars, and butterflies, are found in Ca|yenne
and other neighbouring provinces: Here
almo&s;t all in&s;ects exceed tho&s;e of the Old
World, not in &s;ize only, but in richne&s;s of co|louring,
delicacy of &s;hades, variety of forms,
number of &s;pecies, and the prodigious multipli|cation
of individuals. The toads, the frogs, and
other animals of this kind, are likewi&s;e very large
in America. We &s;hall take no notice of birds
and fi&s;hes; becau&s;e, as Nature has enabled them
to pa&s;s from the one Continent to the other, it
is hardly po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e which are
proper to each. But reptiles and in&s;ects, like
the quadrupeds, are confined to their re&s;pective
Continents.</P>
<P>Let us now examine why the reptiles and in|&s;ects
are &s;o large, the quadrupeds &s;o &s;mall, and
the men &s;o cold, in the New World. The&s;e ef|fects
mu&s;t be referred to the quality of the earth
and atmo&s;phere, to the degree of heat and moi|&s;ture,
to the &s;ituation and height of mountains,
to the quantity of running and &s;tagnant waters,
to the extent of fore&s;ts, and, above all, to the
inert condition of Nature in that country. In
this part of the globe, the heat in general is much
le&s;s, and the humidity much greater. If we
compare the heat and cold of every degree of
<PB N="133" REF="157">
latitude, we &s;hall find very con&s;iderable differen|ces:
At Quebec, for example, which is under the
&s;ame degree of latitude with Paris, the rivers freeze
every year &s;ome fe$t thick; a coat of &s;now &s;till
thicker covers the land for &s;everal months; the
air is &s;o cold that the birds fly off and di&s;appear
during the winter, &amp;c. This difference of tem|perature
under the &s;ame latitude in the Tempe|rate
Zone, though very con&s;iderable, is perhaps
&s;till le&s;s than the difference of heat under the
Torrid Zone. In Senegal, the &s;un is perfectly
&s;corching; while in Peru, which lies under the
&s;ame line, an agreeable temperature prevails.
The &s;ame remark applies to all the other lati|tudes.
The Continent of America is &s;o formed
and &s;ituated, that every circum&s;tance concurs in
dimini&s;hing the action of heat. America con|tains
the highe&s;t mountains, and, of cour&s;e, the
large&s;t rivers in the world. The&s;e mountains
form a chain which &s;eems to bound the Conti|nent
towards the we&s;t, through its whole extent.
The plains and low grounds are all &s;ituated on
this &s;ide of the mountains, and run from their
bottoms to the &s;ea which &s;eparates the Conti|nents
on this &s;ide. Thus the ea&s;t wind, which
blows perpetually between the Tropics, arrives
not in America, till it has traver&s;ed a va&s;t ocean,
by which it is greatly cooled. Hence this wind
is much cooler at Bra&s;il, Cayenne, &amp;c. than at
Senegal, Guiney, &amp;c. where it arrives impreg|nated
with the accumulated heat acquired from
all the lands and burning &s;ands in its pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="134" REF="158">
through A&s;ia and Africa. Let us recollect what
was remarked concerning the different colours
of men, and particularly of the Negroes. It
&s;eemed to be demon&s;trated, that the greater or
le&s;s degree of a tawny, brown, or black colour,
depends entirely on the &s;ituation of the climate;
that the Negroes of Nigritia, and tho&s;e of the we&s;t
coa&s;t of Africa, are blacke&s;t; becau&s;e their coun|tries
are &s;ituated in &s;uch a manner, that the heat
is always greater than in any other part of the
globe, the ea&s;t wind, before its arrival, having
traver&s;ed va&s;t tracts of land; that, on the con|trary,
the American Indians under the line are
only tawny, and the Bra&s;ilians brown, though
under the &s;ame latitude with the Negroes; be|cau&s;e
the heat of their climate is neither &s;o great
nor &s;o con&s;tant, the ea&s;t wind arriving not till
after being cooled by the waters, and loaded
with moi&s;t vapours. The clouds which inter|cept
the light and heat of the &s;un, and the rains
which refre&s;h the air and the &s;urface of the earth,
are periodic, and continue &s;everal months in
Cayenne, and other regions of South America.
This fir&s;t cau&s;e renders all the ea&s;t coa&s;ts of A|merica
much more temperate than Africa or
A&s;ia: And, after the ea&s;t wind has arrived in a
cool &s;tate, in traver&s;ing the plains of America, it
begins to a&s;&s;ume a greater degree of heat, when
it is &s;uddenly &s;topped and cooled by that enor|mous
chain of mountains of which the we&s;tern
part of the New Continent is compo&s;ed; &s;o that
<PB N="135" REF="159">
it is &s;till colder under the line at Peru, than at
Bra&s;il, Cayenne, &amp;c. on account of the prodigi|ous
elevation of the land. Hence the natives of
Peru, Chili, &amp;c. are le&s;s brown, red, or tawny,
than tho&s;e of Bra&s;il. If the&s;e mountains were
reduced to a level with the adjacent plains, the
heat on the we&s;tern coa&s;ts would become exce&s;|&s;ive,
and we would &s;oon find Negroes at Peru
and Chili, as well as upon the we&s;t coa&s;ts of
Africa.</P>
<P>Thus, from the &s;ituation alone of the land in
the New Continent, the heat mu&s;t be greatly in|ferior
to that of the Old; and I &s;hall now &s;how,
that there is likewi&s;e a greater degree of moi|&s;ture
in America. The mountains, being the
highe&s;t upon the globe, and being oppo&s;ed to the
direction of the ea&s;t wind, &s;top and conden&s;e
all the aerial vapours, and, of cour&s;e, give ri&s;e to
an infinite number of &s;prings, which, by uniting,
&s;oon form the greate&s;t rivers in the world. Hence
in the New Continent, there are more running
waters, in proportion to the extent of territory,
than in the Old; and this quantity of water is
greatly increa&s;ed for want of proper drains or
outlets. The natives having neither &s;topped
the torrents, nor directed the rivers, nor drain|ed
the mar&s;hes, the &s;tagnating waters cover im|men&s;e
tracts of land, augment the moi&s;ture of
the air, and dimini&s;h its heat. Be&s;ides, as the
earth is every where covered with trees, &s;hrubs,
and gro&s;s herbage, it never dries. The tran&s;pi|ration
of &s;o many vegetables, pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e to|gether,
<PB N="136" REF="160">
produce immen&s;e quantities of moi&s;t and
noxious exhalations. In the&s;e melancholy re|gions,
Nature remains concealed under her old
garments, and never exhibits her&s;elf in fre&s;h
attire; being neither cheri&s;hed nor cultivated by
man, &s;he never opens her fruitful and beneficent
womb. Here the Earth never &s;aw her &s;ur|face
adorned with tho&s;e rich crops, which de|mon&s;trate
her fecundity, and con&s;titute the o|pulence
of poli&s;hed nations. In this abandoned
condition, every thing langui&s;hes, corrupts, and
proves abortive. The air and the earth, over|loaded
with humid and noxious vapours, are
unable either to purify them&s;elves, or to profit
by the influences of the Sun, who darts in vain
his mo&s;t enlivening rays upon this frigid ma&s;s,
which is not in a condition to make &s;uitable
returns to his ardour. Its powers are limited to
the production of moi&s;t plants, reptiles, and in|&s;ects,
and can only afford nouri&s;hment to cold
men and feeble animals.</P>
<P>The &s;carcity of men, therefore, in America,
and mo&s;t of them living like the brutes, is the
chief cau&s;e why the earth remains in a frigid
&s;tate, and is incapable of producing the active
principles of Nature. To expand the germs of
the large&s;t quadrupeds, and to enable them to
grow and multiply, requires all the activity which
the &s;un can give to a fertile earth. It is for the
oppo&s;ite rea&s;on, that in&s;ects, reptiles, and all the
animals which wallow in the mire, who&s;e blood
<PB N="137" REF="161">
is watery, and which multiply in corruption,
are larger and more numerous in the low, moi&s;t,
and mar&s;hy lands of the New Continent.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the the&s;e remarkable diffe|rences
between the Old and New World, we are
inclined to believe that the latter is actually more
recent, and has continued longer than the re&s;t of
the globe under the waters of the ocean; for,
if we except the enormous we&s;tern mountains,
which appear to be monuments of the highe&s;t
antiquity which this globe affords, all the low
parts of this continent &s;eem to be new lands, e|levated
and formed by the &s;ediments of waters.
In many places, immediately under the vegetable
&s;tratum, we find &s;ea &s;hells and madrepores alrea|dy
forming large ma&s;&s;es of lime-&s;tone, but which
are commonly &s;ofter than our free-&s;tone. If
this continent be really as antient as the other,
why was it &s;o thinly peopled? Why were almo&s;t
its whole inhabitants wandering &s;avages? Why
did the Peruvians and Mexicans, who had uni|ted
into &s;ociety, reckon only two or three hun|dred
years &s;ince the exi&s;tence of the fir&s;t man
who taught them to a&s;&s;ociate? Why are they
&s;till ignorant of the art of tran&s;mitting facts to
po&s;terity by permanent &s;igns, &s;ince they had
already di&s;covered a method of conveying their
ideas at a di&s;tance by tying knots upon cords?
Why did they not reduce the lama, the pacos,
and other animals, into a dome&s;tic &s;tate? Their
arts, like their &s;ociety, were in embryo; their
<PB N="138" REF="162">
talents were imperfect, their ideas locked up, their
organs rude, and their language barbarous. Be|low

Hence every circum&s;tance indicates that the
Americans are new men, or rather men who
had been &s;o long &s;eparated from their original
country, that they had lo&s;t every idea of the part
of the world from which they had i&s;&s;ued; that
the greate&s;t part of the continent of America
was new land, &s;till untouched by the hand of
man, and in which Nature had not time &s;uffi|cient
to accompli&s;h her plans, or to unfold the
whole extent of her productions; that the men
are cold, and the animals &s;mall, becau&s;e the ardour
of the former, and the magnitude of the latter,
depend upon the &s;alubrity and heat of the air;
and that, &s;ome centuries hence, when the lands

fertile, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome, and the riche&s;t in the
whole world, as it is already in all the parts which
have experienced the indu&s;try and &s;kill of man.
We mean not, however, to conclude, that large a|nimals
would then be produced. The tapir and
cabiai will never acquire the magnitude of the
elephant or hippopotamus. But the animals
tran&s;ported thither will no longer dimini&s;h, as

<PB N="142" REF="166">
evidence of our nomenclators, and de&s;cribers of
cabinets, who people the New World with the
animals peculiar to the Old, and mark others
as natives of particular countries where they ne|ver
exi&s;ted. For example, it is certain, that, in
St Domingo, there was originally no quadruped
larger than a rabbit; and, though there had, they
would have been devoured by the European
dogs, which &s;oon became as wild and ferocious
as wolves: However, to the <HI>marac</HI> or <HI>maracai</HI> of
Bra&s;il, they have given the name of the tiger-cat<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Felis &s;ilve&s;tris, <HI>Tigrinus in Hi&s;paniola; Seba, vol. 1. p.</HI> 77.</NOTE>

would not have been neglected by the

Spain.</P>
<P>But our nomenclators have likewi&s;e denied to
America &s;ome animals to which &s;he has an original

the&s;e animals belong &s;olely to the New World,

for the extreme &s;lowne&s;s of all its movements,
that, if they exi&s;ted in the Ea&s;t Indies, travellers
could never have pa&s;&s;ed them over in &s;ilence.
Seba relies on the authority of Francis Valantine
for the Ea&s;t India opo&s;&s;um. But this authority
can have no weight; for Francis Valantine was
&s;o ignorant of the quadruped $nd fi&s;hes of Am|boyna,

<P>We pretend not, however, to affirm ab&s;olutely,
that none of the quadrupeds in the warm climates
are common to both continents. Of this we
can have no phy&s;ical certainty, till the whole of
them be accurately examined. But it is evident,
that none of the large, and very few of the &s;mall
American animals, exi&s;t in the Old Continent.
Be&s;ides, though there &s;hould be &s;ome exceptions,
which I hardly imagine, they mu&s;t be limited
to a very &s;mall number of animals, and could
have no influence on the general law which I
mean to e&s;tabli&s;h, and which &s;eems to be the
only rule for enabling us to acquire a proper
knowledge of the animal kingdom. This law,

which is always mentioned as an European
animal. But I mean not to exhibit all the er|rors
of nomenclators: My aim is to prove, that
their blunders would not have been &s;o numerous,
if they had attended to the difference of climates;
if they had &s;tudied the hi&s;tories of animals, and
di&s;covered, as I have done, that tho&s;e of the &s;outh|ern
parts of each Continent are never found in
both; and, la&s;tly, if they had ab&s;tained from
generic names, by which numbers of &s;pecies, not
only different, but very remote from each other,
are blended together.</P>
<P>Thus the genuine object of a nomenclator is
not to lengthen, but to contract his li&s;t, by ma|king
impartial inquiries and compari&s;ons. No
ta&s;k can be ea&s;ier than to peru&s;e all the writers
on animals, and to form a table of their names
and phra&s;es, which will always be longer in pro|portion
as the labour be&s;towed in ve&s;tigation is
le&s;s: But nothing is more difficult than to ex|amine
<PB N="146" REF="170">
and compare animals with that judgment
and di&s;cernment, which are nece&s;&s;ary to reduce
this table to its ju&s;t dimen&s;ions. I again repeat,
that there are not in the whole habitable earth
above two hundred &s;pecies of animals, even inclu|ding
forty different &s;pecies of monkeys. To each of
the&s;e, therefore, we have only to allot a proper name;
and a very indifferent memory is able to retain
two hundred names. For what purpo&s;e, then, are
quadrupeds arranged into cla&s;&s;es, orders, and ge|nera?
Methodical di&s;tributions are only a kind
of &s;caffolds invented to aid the memory in the re|collection
of plants, the number of which is &s;o
great, their di&s;tinctions &s;o minute, and their
&s;pecies &s;o liable to variation, that it is nece&s;&s;ary
to con&s;ider them in bundles or genera, by put|ting
together &s;uch as have the greate&s;t &s;imila|rity
to each other. As in all works of genius, what
is ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s, is always ill imagined, and
often becomes hurtful, in&s;tead of giving names to
two hundred quadrupeds, we have dictionaries
loaded with &s;uch a variety of terms and phra&s;es,
that it would require more labour to explain,
than was &s;pent in compo&s;ing them. Why em|ploy
a phra&s;eological jargon, when we can &s;peak
plain language, by pronouncing &s;imple names?
Why change all the acceptation of terms, un|der
the pretext of making cla&s;&s;es and genera?
When a genus is compo&s;ed of a dozen of animals,
under the name, for example, of the <HI>rabbit,</HI> why
is not the rabbit it&s;elf to be found there, but mu&s;t
<PB N="147" REF="171">
be &s;ought for under the genus of <HI>hare</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Bri&s;&s;on. Regn. anim. p, 140. 142.</NOTE>? Is it
not ab&s;urd, and even ridiculous, to fabricate
cla&s;&s;es, where genera the mo&s;t remote are a&s;&s;em|bled
together; for example, to unite in the fir&s;t,
<HI>man</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lin. &s;y&s;t. nat. Holmiae, 1758. tom, 1. p. 18. 19.</NOTE> and the <HI>bat;</HI> in the &s;econd, the <HI>elephant</HI> and

the fourth, the <HI>hog</HI> and the <HI>mole;</HI> in the fifth, the
<HI>rhinoceros</HI> and the <HI>rat?</HI> &amp;c. Such heterogeneous
and ill conceived ideas cannot be &s;upported.
The works, accordingly, which contain fancies
&s;o crude, have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively de&s;troyed by
their own authors. One edition contradicts an|other,
and the whole receives no applau&s;e but
from tyros and children, who are uniformly
the dupes of my&s;tery, to whom the fopperies of
method appear to be &s;cientific, and, in fine, who
re&s;pect their ma&s;ter in proportion to the talent

per&s;picuous objects under the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e and
dark points of view.</P>
<P>By comparing the fourth edition of Linnaeus's
work with the tenth, we find, that man<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. edit. 4. p. 64.</NOTE> is no
longer ranked with the bat, but with the &s;caly

the third with the rat, are all a&s;&s;ociated with the

better to be &s;ilent with regard to matters of
which we are ignorant, than to e&s;tabli&s;h e&s;&s;ential
characters and general di&s;tinctions upon the gro&s;&s;|e&s;t
errors, &s;uch as, for example, that, of all ani|mals
which give &s;uck, woman alone has a clito|ris<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Id. ib. p. 24. 25.</NOTE>?
This is &s;o oppo&s;ite to the truth, that, of
above a hundred different animals which we have
di&s;&s;ected, not a &s;ingle one wanted that part. But
I have dwelt, perhaps, too long on critici&s;ms of
<PB N="149" REF="173">
this kind, e&s;pecially as they are not my principal
object. I have &s;aid enough to guard the reader
again&s;t errors both of a general and particular
kind, which are no where &s;o numerous as in the
works of nomenclators; becau&s;e, being &s;ollicitous
to comprehend every thing within the limits of
their &s;y&s;tems, they are obliged to a&s;&s;ociate all that
they are ignorant of, with the little that they
know.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, the following
general conclu&s;ions may be drawn: That man
is the only animated being on whom Nature has
be&s;towed &s;ufficient &s;trength, genius, and ductility,
to enable him to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and to multiply in every
climate of the earth. No other animal, it is evi|dent,
has obtained this great privilege; for, in|&s;tead
of multiplying every where, mo&s;t of them
are limited to certain climates, and even to par|ticular
countries. Man is totally a production
of heaven: But the animals, in many re&s;pects,
are only creatures of the earth. Tho&s;e of one
Continent are not found in another; or, if there
are a few exceptions, the animals are &s;o changed
and contracted, that they are hardly to be recog|ni&s;ed.
Is any farther argument nece&s;&s;ary to con|vince
us, that the model of their form is not un|alterable;
that their nature, le&s;s fixed than that
of man, may be varied, and even ab&s;olutely
changed in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages; that, for the
&s;ame rea&s;on, the lea&s;t perfect, the lea&s;t active, and
<PB N="150" REF="174">
the wor&s;t defended, as well as the mo&s;t delicate
and heavy &s;pecies, have already, or will &s;oon di&s;|appear;
for their very exi&s;tence depends on the
form which man gives or allows to the &s;urface
of the earth?</P>
<P>The prodigious <HI>mammouth,</HI> who&s;e enormous
bones I have often viewed with a&s;toni&s;hment,
and which were, at lea&s;t, &s;ix times larger than
tho&s;e of large&s;t elephant, has now no exi&s;t|ence;
yet the remains of him have been found
in many places remote from each other, as in
Ireland, Siberia, Loui&s;iana, &amp;c. This &s;pecies
was unque&s;tionably the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t of
all quadrupeds; and, &s;ince it has di&s;appeared,
how many &s;maller, weaker, and le&s;s remarkable
&s;pecies mu&s;t likewi&s;e have peri&s;hed, without lea|ving
any evidence of their pa&s;t exi&s;tence? How
many others have undergone &s;uch changes, ei|ther
from degeneration or improvement, occa|&s;ioned
by the great vici&s;&s;itudes of the earth and
waters, the neglect or cultivation of Nature, the
continued influence of favourable or ho&s;tile cli|mates,
that they are now no longer the &s;ame
creatures? Yet the quadrupeds, next to man,
are beings who&s;e nature and form are the mo&s;t
permanent. Birds and fi&s;hes are &s;ubject to greater
variations: The in&s;ect-tribes are liable to &s;till
greater vici&s;&s;itudes: And, if we de&s;cend to vege|tables,
which ought not to be excluded from a|nimated
Nature, our wonder will be excited by
<PB N="151" REF="175">
the quickne&s;s and facility with which they a&s;|&s;ume
new forms.</P>
<P>Hence, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, that, without in|verting
the order of Nature, all the animals of
the New World were originally the &s;ame with
tho&s;e of the Old, from whom they derive their
exi&s;tence; but that, being afterwards &s;eparated
by immen&s;e &s;eas, or impa&s;&s;able lands, they would,
in the progre&s;s of time, &s;uffer all the effects of a
climate that had become new to them, and mu&s;t
have had its qualities changed by the very cau&s;es
which produced the &s;eparation, and, con&s;equent|ly,
degenerate, &amp;c. But the&s;e circum&s;tances
&s;hould not prevent them from being now regard|ed
as different &s;pecies of animals. From whatever
cau&s;e the&s;e changes, produced by the operation of
time and the influence of climate, have originated,
and though we &s;hould date them from the crea|tion
it&s;elf, they are not the le&s;s real. Nature, I
allow, is in a perpetual &s;tate of fluctuation: But
it is enough for man to &s;eize her in his own age,
and to look backward and forward, in order to
di&s;cover her former condition, and what future
appearances &s;he may probably a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>With regard to the utility of this mode of com|paring
animals, it is evident, that, independent
of a&s;certaining names, of which &s;ome examples
have been given, it extends our knowledge of
the animal creation, and renders it more certain
and perfect; that it prevents us from a&s;cribing,
to American animals, properties which are pecu|liar
<PB N="152" REF="176">
to tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t-Indies, only becau&s;e they
have the &s;ame name; that, in examining the no|tices
of foreign animals communicated by travel|lers,
it will enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h names and
facts, and to refer each to its proper &s;pecies;
and, la&s;tly, that it will render the hi&s;tory which
I am now compo&s;ing le&s;s defective, and per|haps
more con&s;picuous and complete.</P>

<HEAD>THE TIGER<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The Tiger has &s;ix cutting, and two canine teeth in each jaw; five toes before, and four behind.

<P>IN the cla&s;s of carnivorous animals, the lion
holds the fir&s;t rank, and the tiger the &s;econd.
As the fir&s;t of a bad genus is always the large&s;t,
and has often the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, the &s;econd is
generally the mo&s;t rapacious and de&s;tructive. To
pride, courage, and &s;trength, the lion adds dig|nity,
clemency, and magnanimity. But the ti|ger
is gro&s;sly ferocious, and cruel without nece&s;|&s;ity.
<PB N="154" REF="178">
The &s;ame thing takes place in all nature,
where rank is the offspring of &s;trength. The
fir&s;t, in which all power re&s;ides, is le&s;s tyranni|cal
than his immediate inferior, who, unable to
obtain unlimited power, avenges him&s;elf, by a|bu&s;ing
that portion of it which he enjoys. Thus
the tiger is more to be dreaded than the lion.
The latter often forgets that he is the &s;overeign,
or the &s;tronge&s;t of all animals. He moves for|ward
with tranquillity and &s;teadine&s;s, and never
attacks man, unle&s;s when provoked. He never
runs with precipitation, nor gives chace, but
when pre&s;&s;ed with hunger. The tiger, on the
contrary, though &s;atiated with carnage, &s;eems to
be perpetually thir&s;ting for blood. His fury has
no intervals, but during the time he is obliged
to lie in ambu&s;h for prey at the &s;ides of rivers.
He &s;eizes and tears to pieces a fre&s;h animal with
the &s;ame rage that he exerted in devouring the
fir&s;t. He de&s;olates the country which he inha|bits,
and fears neither the a&s;pect nor the arms of
man. He puts to death whole flocks of dome|&s;tic
animals, and all the wild bea&s;ts which come
in his way: He attacks the young elephant and
rhinoceros, and &s;ometimes even ventures to brave
the lion.</P>
<P>The form of the body generally accords with
the natural di&s;po&s;ition. The air of the lion is
noble; the height of his limbs is proportioned
to the length of his body. His large thick mane,
which covers his &s;houldiers, and forms a &s;hade to
<PB N="155" REF="179">
his face, his determined a&s;pect, his grave de|meanour,
all concur in announcing his proud
and maje&s;tic intrepidity. The too great length
of the body of the tiger, and his di&s;proportion|ately
&s;hort limbs, his naked head, his haggard
eyes, and his blood-coloured tongue, which al|ways
lolls out of his mouth, are marks of ig|noble
malice and in&s;atiable cruelty. He has no
in&s;tinct but perpetual rage, a blind and undi|&s;tingui&s;hing
ferocity, which often impells him
to devour his own young, and to tear in pieces
their mother, when &s;he attempts to defend them.
May this exce&s;&s;ive thir&s;t for blood never be al|layed,
till he has de&s;troyed the whole race of
mon&s;ters which he produces!</P>
<P>It is a fortunate circum&s;tance for the other a|nimals,
that the &s;pecies of the tiger is not nume|rous,
and appears to be confined to the warme&s;t
regions of the Ea&s;t Indies. Tigers are found in
Malabar, in Siam, in Bengal, the &s;ame countries
which are inhabited by the elephant and rhino|ceros.
They are even &s;aid to follow the rhino|ceros
for the purpo&s;e of eating his dung<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jac. Bontii Hi&s;t. Nat. Ind. Orient. p. 54. Recueil des voyages de la Compagnie des Indes, tom. 7. p. 278. Voyage de Schoutten aux Indes Orientales.</NOTE>, which
both refre&s;hes and purges them. They frequent,
with him, the borders of the rivers and lakes;
for, as blood only augments their thir&s;t, they
have often occa&s;ion for water, to cool the fer|vour
which con&s;umes them. Be&s;ides, they watch,
<PB N="156" REF="180">
near the waters, the approach of animals, which
the heat of the climate obliges to re&s;ort thither
&s;everal times a day. Here they procure their
prey, or rather multiply their ma&s;&s;acres; for
they often leave the creatures they have recently
killed, to devour others. They delight in blood,
and glut them&s;elves with it till they are intoxi|cated.
They tear the body for no other pur|po&s;e
than to plunge their head into it, and to
drink large draughts of blood, the &s;ources of
which are generally exhau&s;ted before their thir&s;t
is appea&s;ed.</P>
<P>When, however, the tiger kills large animals,
as a hor&s;e or buffalo, he does not tear out their
bowels on the &s;pot; but, to prevent interruption,
and that he may devour them at lei&s;ure, he drags
them off to the wood with &s;uch incredible &s;wift|ne&s;s,
that his cour&s;e &s;eems to be hardly retarded
by their enormous weight<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jac. Bontii Hi&s;t. Nat. Ind. Orient. p. 53.</NOTE>. This is &s;ufficient to
give an idea of his &s;trength; but it will be ren|dered
&s;till clearer by attending to the dimen&s;ions
of his body. Some travellers have compared
him to the hor&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Les voyages de Dellon, p. 104.</NOTE>, others to the buffalo<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The tigers of India, &s;ays Boullaye-le-Gouz, are of a pro|digious &s;ize. I have &s;een &s;kins of them longer and wider than that of a buffalo. They are &s;ometimes addicted to eat men; and, in many parts of India, no man travels without being well armed, becau&s;e the tiger, who&s;e figure re&s;embles that of a cat, rai&s;es him&s;elf on his hind-legs, and leaps up|on the per&s;on he attacks; <HI>Voyage de la Boullaye-le-Gouz, p.</HI> 246. 247.</NOTE>, and
<PB N="157" REF="181">
others have only &s;aid that he is much larger than
the lion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pro&s;per. Alp. Hi&s;t. Nat. Aegypt. p. 237. Wotton, p. 65.</NOTE>. But we have authorities more re|cent,
and above all &s;u&s;picion. We are a&s;&s;ured
by M. de la Lande-Magon, that he has &s;een, in
the Ea&s;t Indies, a tiger of fifteen feet in length,
including the tail, which, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be four
or five feet, the length of the body was at lea&s;t
ten. The &s;kin pre&s;erved in the royal cabi|net,
it is true, exceeds not &s;even feet from the
extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the tail.
But the tiger to which it belonged was taken when
very young, and was ever afterward confined
in a narrow apartment, where the want of ex|erci&s;e
and room, the languor and re&s;traint of con|finement,
and unnatural food, &s;hortened his life,
and prevented the proper exten&s;ion of his body.
In the hi&s;tory of the &s;tag<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See vol. IV. Art. STAG.</NOTE>, it was remarked, that
the&s;e animals, when taken young, and &s;hut up
in too &s;mall parks, not only never acquired their
natural &s;ize, but became deformed and ricketty.
We likewi&s;e learn, from the di&s;&s;ections of every
&s;pecies of animals brought up in hou&s;es or court|yards,
that their bodies and members, for want of
exerci&s;e, never acquire their natural dimen&s;ions;
that &s;uch organs as cannot be u&s;ed, as tho&s;e of
generation, are &s;o minute, in all captive and &s;oli|tary
animals, that it is difficult to di&s;cover them.
The difference of climate alone may produce the
&s;ame effects as confinement and want of exer|ci&s;e.
<PB N="158" REF="182">
Animals peculiar to warm climates, though
left at liberty, and well fed, are incapable of mul|tiplying
in cold countries: And, reproduction be|ing
the natural effect of copious nutrition, it is
evident, that, as the former faculty is de&s;troy|ed,
the latter mu&s;t al&s;o be incomplete; and
that, in the&s;e animals, cold alone is &s;ufficient to
re&s;train the action of the internal mould, and to
dimini&s;h growth, &s;ince it is capable of oblitera|ting
the power of reproduction.</P>
<P>It is not, therefore, &s;urpri&s;ing, that this tiger,
who&s;e &s;kin and &s;keleton is pre&s;erved in the roy|al
cabinet, &s;hould not have acquired its natural
&s;ize. The bare in&s;pection, however, of this
&s;tuffed &s;kin, and of the &s;keleton, conveys an idea
of a mo&s;t formidable animal. Upon the bones
of the leg, there are rugo&s;ities, or impre&s;&s;ions,
which indicate the attachment of mu&s;cles &s;till
&s;tronger than tho&s;e of the lion. The&s;e bones are
al&s;o equally &s;trong, though &s;horter; and, as for|merly
remarked, the height of the tiger's legs is
not proportioned to the great length of his bo|dy.
Hence the incredible &s;wiftne&s;s a&s;cribed to
him by Pliny, and which is implied in the name
of the animal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tigris</HI> vocabulum e&s;t linguae Armeniae; nam ibi et &s;a|gitta et quod vehementi&s;&s;imum flumen, dicitur <HI>Tigris; Varro de lingua Latina</HI>&mdash;Per&s;ae et Medi &s;agittam <HI>Tigrim</HI> nuncupant; <HI>Ge&s;n. hi&s;t. quad. p.</HI> 936.</NOTE>, cannot be attributed to his ordi|nary
movements, nor even to the quickne&s;s of a
continued cour&s;e; for it is apparent, from the
<PB N="159" REF="183">
&s;hortne&s;s of his legs, that he can neither walk nor
run<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The terrible &s;wiftne&s;s, &s;ays Bontius, a&s;cribed by Pliny to this animal, is an error. On the contrary, he runs &s;lowly; and this is the rea&s;on why he more willingly attacks men than &s;wift animals, as the &s;tag, the wild boar, the buffalo, or the wild ox, and why he attacks all animals by ambu&s;cade. He darts with impetuo&s;ity upon their heads, and beats the &s;tronge&s;t animals to the ground with a &s;ingle &s;troke of his paw; <HI>Bont. p.</HI> 53. It is ea&s;y to reconcile the&s;e facts with the expre&s;&s;ions of Pliny.</NOTE> with &s;uch celerity as tho&s;e animals who&s;e
legs are proportionally longer. But this pro|digious
&s;wiftne&s;s may, with propriety, be applied
to the terrible bounds which he makes without
any extraordinary effort; for, if we &s;uppo&s;e his
&s;trength and &s;upplene&s;s to be proportioned to
tho&s;e of the cat, which he greatly re&s;embles in
&s;tructure, and which leaps, in an in&s;tant, to the
di&s;tance of many feet, the tiger, who&s;e body is
ten times longer, may, nearly in the &s;ame in|&s;tant,
leap many fathoms. Hence it is not the
celerity of his cour&s;e, but the quickne&s;s of his
leap, which Pliny meant to de&s;cribe, and which
renders this animal tremendous, becau&s;e it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to avoid him, after he makes his &s;pring.</P>
<P>The tiger is perhaps the only animal who&s;e
ferocity cannot be &s;ubdued. Neither violence
nor re&s;traint have any effect in &s;oftening his
temper. He is equally irritated with gentle or
rough treatment. The mild influence of &s;ociety
makes no impre&s;&s;ion on the obduracy of his na|ture.
Time, in&s;tead of mollifying the ferociou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="160" REF="184">
of his humour, only exa&s;perates his rage.
With equal wrath he tears the hand which feeds
him, as that which is lifted up to &s;trike him.
He roars at the &s;ight of every thing that lives.
Every object appears to him as a fre&s;h prey,
which he devours beforehand with the avidity
of his eyes, menaces with frightful groans, and
the grinding of his teeth, and often darts upon
it, without regarding his chains, which only re|&s;train,
but cannot calm his fury.</P>

of a combat between a tiger and two e|lephants.
&startq;A pali&s;ade<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Premier voyage de Siam, par le Per&egrave; Tachard, p. 292.</NOTE>,' &s;ays this author, `of a|bout
a hundred paces &s;quare, was erected. In|to
this inclo&s;ure two elephants were introdu|ced,
for the purpo&s;e of fighting a tiger. They
were defended by a kind of pla&s;tron, in the
form of a ma&s;k, which covered the head and a
part of the trunk. As &s;oon as we arrived, a
large tiger was brought out of his lodge. His
colour and figure were new to the Frenchmen
who were pre&s;ent at this combat; for he was
not only much longer and thicker than tho&s;e
we have &s;een in France, but his &s;kin was dif|ferently
&s;potted. In&s;tead of &s;pots &s;cattered
<PB N="161" REF="185">
without order, he had long, broad, circular
bands, which, ari&s;ing from the back, joined
below the belly, and were continued along the
tail, in the form of alternate white and black
rings. There was nothing peculiar in his head
or limbs, excepting that they were larger than
tho&s;e of common tigers, though the animal
had not yet acquired his full growth; for M.
Con&s;tance informed us, that there were tigers
in that kingdom three times larger; and that,
when hunting along with the king, he had
once &s;een a tiger nearly as large as the bigge&s;t
mule. They have al&s;o a &s;maller kind, like
that brought from Africa to Europe, one of
which I was &s;hown the &s;ame day at Louvo.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The tiger de&s;tined for the combat was not
let loo&s;e, but was &s;o fixed by two cords, that,
having no liberty to &s;pring, the fir&s;t elephant
which approached gave him two or three
blows on the back with his trunk. The&s;e
&s;trokes were &s;o heavy, that they beat the tiger
to the ground, where he lay for &s;ome time as
if he had been dead. But, though this fir&s;t
attack had abated his fury, he was no &s;ooner
united, than he gave a horrible roar, and made
a &s;pring at the elephant's trunk, which was
&s;tretched out to &s;trike him. The elephant,
however, dexterou&s;ly drew up his trunk, pro|tected
it with his tu&s;ks, which he pre&s;ented at
the &s;ame time, and with them he threw the
tiger to a great height in the air. The tiger
<PB N="162" REF="186">
was &s;o &s;tunned, that he made no farther ad|vances,
but took &s;everal turns round the pali|&s;ade,
and &s;ometimes &s;prung towards the people
in the galleries. Three elephants were then
&s;et upon him, each of whom, in their turn,
gave him &s;uch blows, that he again &s;eemed to
be dead, and afterwards endeavoured only to
avoid his enemies, who would unque&s;tionably
have killed him, if an end had not been put to
the combat.&endq; Even from Father Tachard's
de&s;cription, it is plain, that the tiger he &s;aw fight
with the elephants is the true tiger; that he ap|peared
to be a new animal to the Frenchmen,
becau&s;e they had probably &s;een, in France, only
African panthers or leopards, or, rather, the A|merican
jaguars; and that the &s;mall tiger he &s;aw
at Luovo was nothing but a panther. We may
likewi&s;e conceive, from this &s;imple narrative, the
amazing &s;trength and ferocity of the tiger.
Though young, and not arrived at his full
growth, though a captive, and bound with ropes,
though &s;ingle again&s;t three; yet this tiger was &s;o
formidable to tho&s;e enormous animals, that all
the parts of their bodies which Nature had not
defended with an impenetrable &s;kin, were o|bliged
to be covered with pla&s;trons or cu&s;hions.</P>
<P>The tiger, of which an anatomical de&s;cription
was made by the Je&s;uits at China, and commu|nicated
to the Academy of Sciences by Father
Gouie<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;potted tiger is the only one known in Europe. But in Tartary and China, there are tigers with black bands or belts; and, even in the&s;e countries, two &s;pecies are men|tioned, though no other differences appear to exi&s;t. The tiger di&s;&s;ected by the Je&s;uits of China, which had been kil|led in the chace by the Emperor, along with other four, weighed only 265 pounds, and, con&s;equently, was none of the large&s;t; another of them weighed 400 pounds. The one that was di&s;&s;ected had a third part of his &s;tomach filled with worms, though it is not &s;aid that he was in a putrid &s;tate. Some of the people who were pre&s;ent remarked, that they had ob&s;erved the &s;ame appearance in a tiger which was di&s;|&s;ected at Macao; <HI>Hi&s;t. de l'Acad. des Sciences, ann&eacute;e</HI> 1699, p. 51.</NOTE>, &s;eemed to be the genuine tiger, as well

Perrault<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mem. pour &s;ervir a l'hi&s;t. des anim. part. 2. p. 287.</NOTE>, in his memoirs concerning animals,
and of which he &s;ays the de&s;cription was made
in Siam. Dellon<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyages de Dellon, p. 104.</NOTE>, in his voyages, mentions
expre&s;sly, that tigers are more frequent in Mala|bar
than in any other part of the Ea&s;t Indies;
that there are &s;everal &s;pecies of them; but that
the large&s;t, which is as big as a hor&s;e, and called
the <HI>Royal Tiger</HI> by the Portugue&s;e, is extremely
rare.</P>
<P>The royal tiger, therefore, appears not to be a
different &s;pecies. He is found in the Ea&s;t Indies
only, and not in Bra&s;il, as has been alledged by
&s;ome of our naturali&s;ts<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Regn. anim. Bri&s;&s;on. p. 269.</NOTE>. I am even inclined
to believe, that the true tiger is peculiar to A&s;ia,
and the interior parts of the &s;outh of Africa;
for, though mo&s;t travellers who have vi&s;ited the
coa&s;ts of Africa mention tigers, yet it is ea&s;y to
<PB N="164" REF="188">
perceive, from their de&s;criptions, that they are
not genuine tigers, but leopards, panthers, ounces,
&amp;c. Doctor Shaw remarks<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Shaw's travels. par Dapper, p. 206.</NOTE>, that, in the
kingdoms of Tunis and Algiers, the lion and
panther hold the fir&s;t rank among the rapacious
animals; but that the tiger is not found in this
part of Barbary. Doctor Shaw's ob&s;ervation

by the Romans. It was al&s;o from India that
Heliogabalus procured tho&s;e tigers with which
he wi&s;hed to have his chariot drawn, when he
wanted to per&s;onate the god Bacchus.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;pecies of the tiger has always been
more rare and le&s;s diffu&s;ed than that of the lion.
The female, however, like the lione&s;s, produces
four or five cubs at a litter. She is furious at
all times; but her rage ri&s;es to the utmo&s;t extre|mity,
when robbed of her young. She then
braves every danger; &s;he pur&s;ues the plunderers,
who are often obliged to relea&s;e one, in order to
retard her motion. She &s;tops, takes it up, and
carries it off to the neare&s;t cover; but &s;he in|&s;tantly
returns, and continues the pur&s;uit after
the &s;poilders to the very gates of their villages, or
to their boats. When all hope of recovering
them is lo&s;t, &s;he expre&s;&s;es the exqui&s;itene&s;s of
<PB N="165" REF="189">
her &s;orrow by di&s;mal and hideous howlings,
which excite terror wherever they reach.</P>
<P>The tiger, like the lion, moves the &s;kin of his
face, grinds his teeth, and roars; but the &s;ound
of his voice, which has, by &s;ome travellers, been
compared to that of certain large birds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Second voyage de Siam, par le P. Tachard, p. 248.</NOTE>, is diffe|rent.

hi&s;tory and de&s;cription I have ju&s;t given, A&s;ia
and Africa afford other three &s;pecies of this
genus, all different from the tiger, and from
each other. The&s;e three &s;pecies are the <HI>Pan|ther,</HI>
the <HI>Ounce,</HI> and the <HI>Leopard,</HI> which natu|rali&s;ts

notice in this place, but confine my&s;elf &s;olely to

but that of the great panther, as formerly ob|&s;erved,
is yellow. It is, be&s;ides, probable, that
the &s;mall panther was called &s;imply <HI>Pard</HI> or
<HI>Pardus,</HI> and that they afterwards named the large
<PB N="172" REF="197">
panther <HI>Leopard,</HI> or <HI>Leopardus;</HI> becau&s;e they i|magined
it was a mongrel &s;pecies, increa&s;ed in
&s;ize by mixing with that of the lion. But, as
there is no foundation for this fancy, we have
preferred the &s;imple and primitive name <HI>pan|ther,</HI>
to the modern compound one, <HI>Leopard,</HI>
which la&s;t we have applied to a new animal, that
has hitherto been mentioned under equivocal ap|pellations
only.</P>
<P>Thus the ounce differs from the panther by
being &s;maller, having a longer tail, and al&s;o
longer hair, and a whiti&s;h gray colour; and
the leopard differs from both the panther and
ounce, by his brilliant yellow robe, though more
or le&s;s deep, by the &s;mallne&s;s of his &s;pots, and
by their being di&s;po&s;ed in groups, as if each of
them were formed by the union of four or five.</P>

that the robe of the female panther was whiter
than that of the male. This may be true of
the ounce: But we have ob&s;erved no &s;uch di|&s;tinction
in the panthers kept at Ver&s;ailles, which
were drawn from the life. Hence, if there is
any difference between the male and female, it
can neither be con&s;tant nor &s;en&s;ible. We have
indeed perceived &s;hades, more or le&s;s &s;trong,
in &s;ome &s;kins of the&s;e animals; but it is pro|bable
that this difference depends more on the
difference of age or of climate than upon that of

The animals de&s;cribed and di&s;&s;ected by the

The latter, indeed, &s;ays, that the animals
de&s;cribed and di&s;&s;ected by the gentlemen of the

not the ounce of Caius. But the only rea&s;ons he

Hi&s;t. quadrup. pag. 825. et</HI> 826.</NOTE>. It may be remarked, that Caius,
<PB N="174" REF="199">
without giving the preci&s;e dimen&s;ions of the a|nimal's
body, &s;ays, that it is larger than the &s;hep|herd's
dog, and as thick, though it be &s;horter, as
the bull-dog: I cannot conceive, therefore, how
M. Perrault &s;hould have &s;aid, that the ounce of
Caius was much &s;maller than the tigers di&s;&s;ected
by the gentlemen of the Academy. The&s;e a|nimals,
from the extremity of the muzzle, to
the origin of the tail, mea&s;ured only four feet
in length. The leopard which we have de&s;cri|bed,
<PB N="175" REF="200">
and which is unque&s;tionably the &s;ame ani|mal
with the tigers of M. Perrault, was like|wi&s;e
about four feet long; and, if we mea&s;ure
a bull-dog, and particularly a ma&s;tiff, we will
find that he often exceeds the&s;e dimen&s;ions.
Thus the tigers de&s;cribed by the gentlemen of
the Academy differ not &s;o much in &s;ize from the
ounce of Caius, as to ju&s;tify M. Perrault's conclu|&s;ion,
that they were not the &s;ame animal. The
&s;econd difference is that of the colour of the
hair on the belly, which M Perrault &s;ays is
white, and Caius a&s;h-coloured, that is, whiti&s;h.
Hence the&s;e two characters, which induced M.
Perrault to think that the tigers di&s;&s;ected by the
gentlemen of the Academy were not the ounce
of Caius, &s;hould have led him to the oppo|&s;ite
conclu&s;ion, e&s;pecially if he had attended to
the re&s;t of the de&s;cription, which perfectly a|grees.
We mu&s;t, therefore, regard the tigers
of the gentlemen of the Academy, the ounce of
Caius, and our leopard, as the &s;ame animal;
and I cannot conceive how &s;ome naturali&s;ts
&s;hould have mi&s;taken M. Perrault's tigers for
American animals, and confounded them with
the jaguar.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider it, therefore, as certain, that the ti|gers
of Perrault, the uncia of Caius, and our leo|pard,
are the &s;ame animal, and that our panther
is the &s;ame with the panther of the antients; for,
excepting in the &s;ize, our panther agrees with
the antient in every other character; and this in|con&s;iderable
<PB N="176" REF="201">
difference may be &s;afely a&s;cribed to
confinement and want of exerci&s;e. This diffe|rence
of dimen&s;ions at fir&s;t perplexed me. But,
after a minute compari&s;on between the large
&s;kins &s;old by the furriers with that of our pan|ther,
there could be no longer he&s;itation that
they were the very &s;ame creatures. The panther
we have de&s;cribed, as well as other two of the
&s;ame &s;pecies, kept at Ver&s;ailles, came from Bar|bary:
The two fir&s;t were pre&s;ented to his Ma|je&s;ty
by the regency of Algiers, about twelve
years ago; and the third was purcha&s;ed by the
King from an Algerine Jew.</P>
<P>Another remark mu&s;t be made. Of the three
animals above de&s;cribed under the appellation of
the <HI>panther,</HI> the <HI>ounce,</HI> and the <HI>leopard,</HI> not a
&s;ingle one can be referred to the animal which
naturali&s;ts have indicated by the name of <HI>pardus,</HI>
or <HI>leopardus.</HI> The <HI>pardus</HI> of Linnaeus, and the
<HI>leopard</HI> of Bri&s;&s;on, which appear to be the &s;ame
animal, are de&s;igned in the following manner:
<HI>Pardus, felis cauda elongata, corporis maculis &s;u|perioribus
orbiculatis, inferioribus virgatis;</HI> Sy&s;t.
Nat. p. 61. <HI>Leopardus, felis ex albo flavicans,
maculis nigris in dor&s;o orbiculatis, in ventre lon|gis,
variegata;</HI> Regn. anim. p. 272. This cha|racter,
of long &s;pots on the inferior parts of the
body, belongs neither to the panther, the ounce,
nor the leopard; and yet it is the panther of the
antients, the <HI>panthera, pardalis, pardus, leopardus</HI>
of Ge&s;ner, the <HI>pardus, panthera</HI> of Pro&s;per Alpi|nus;
<PB N="177" REF="202">
in a word, the panther found in Africa
and the Ea&s;t-Indies, which the&s;e authors mean
to point out by the above definitions. From the
accurate re&s;earches I have made, I am perfectly
&s;ati&s;fied that the&s;e three animals, and, perhaps, a
fourth, to be afterwards mentioned, which like|wi&s;e
has not this character of long &s;pots on the
belly, are the only &s;pecies of this genus to be
found in A&s;ia or Africa. We mu&s;t, therefore,
hold this character of our nomenclators to be
fictitious; for, in all the animals of this kind,
both in the Old and New Continent, when they
have long &s;pots, the&s;e &s;pots are uniformly &s;itua|ted
on the &s;uperior parts of the body, as the neck
and back, and never on the inferior parts.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t again remark, that the animal de&s;cribed
in the third part of the <HI>Memoires pour &s;ervir a
l'hi&s;toire des animaux, p.</HI> 3. is neither the pan|ther,
the ounce, nor the leopard, of which I am
here treating.</P>
<P>In fine, when peru&s;ing the writings of the an|tients,
the <HI>panther</HI> &s;hould not be confounded
with the <HI>panthera.</HI> The <HI>panthera</HI> is the animal
we have de&s;cribed; but the <HI>panther</HI> of Homer
and other authors, is a kind of timid wolf, per|haps
the jackal, as &s;hall be explained in the hi|&s;tory
of that animal. Be&s;ides, the word <HI>pardalis</HI>
is the antient Greek name of the true panther,
and is applied indi&s;criminately to both male and
female. The word <HI>pardus</HI> is more modern, be|ing
fir&s;t u&s;ed by Lucan and Pliny. <HI>Leopardus</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="203">
is &s;till le&s;s antient; for it appears to have been
fir&s;t employed by Julius Capitolinus: And <HI>pan|thera</HI>
was derived from the Greek by the antient
Latins, but never u&s;ed by the Greeks them&s;elves.</P>
<P>After di&s;pelling the darkne&s;s with which no|menclators
perpetually ob&s;cure Nature, after re|moving
every &s;ource of ambiguity, by giving ex|act
figures of the three animals of which we are
treating, we &s;hall now proceed to remark what
is peculiar to each of them.</P>
<P>The panther, which we have examined alive,
has a ferocious air, a re&s;tle&s;s eye, a cruel a&s;pect,
bri&s;k movements, and a cry &s;imilar to that of an
enraged dog, but &s;tronger and more hoar&s;e. He
has a rough and very red tongue, &s;trong and
pointed teeth, hard &s;harp claws, a beautiful &s;kin,
of a more or le&s;s deep yellow colour, variegated
with black circular &s;pots, or united in the form
of ro&s;es, and &s;hort hair. The upper part of the
tail is marked with large black &s;pots, and with
rings of black and white toward the extremity.
He is of the &s;ize and make of a ma&s;tiff dog, only
his legs are not &s;o long.</P>
<P>The relations of travellers agree with the te|&s;timonies
of the antients, as to the large and
&s;mall panther, that is, our panther and ounce. It
appears, that there now exi&s;t, as in the days of
Oppian, in that part of Africa which extends a|long
the Mediterranean, and in tho&s;e parts of
A&s;ia that were known to the antients, two &s;pe|cies
of panthers, and mo&s;t travellers have called
<PB N="179" REF="204">
the larger the <HI>panther</HI> or <HI>leopard,</HI> and the &s;maller
the <HI>ounce.</HI> They all agree, that the ounce is ea&s;ily
tamed, that he is trained to hunting, and em|ployed
for this purpo&s;e in Per&s;ia, and &s;everal o|ther
provinces of A&s;ia; that &s;ome ounces are &s;o
&s;mall, that a hor&s;eman carries them on the crup|per
behind him, and that they are &s;o gentle as to
admit of being handled and care&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The Per&s;ians have a quadruped called the <HI>ounce,</HI> who&s;e &s;kin is &s;potted like that of a tiger, but which is very tame and gentle. A hor&s;eman carries it on a tru&s;s behind him; and, when he perceives an antelope, he makes the ounce de&s;cend, which is &s;o nimble, that, in three bounds, it leaps on the neck of the antelope, though the latter runs with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s. The antelope is a &s;mall &s;pecies of roe-deer, which are very nume|rous in this country. The ounce &s;oon kills the antelope with his &s;harp teeth. But, if he mi&s;&s;es his blow, and the antelope e&s;capes, he remains fixed on the &s;pot, in a confu&s;ed and mortified condition. In the&s;e moments of di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;appointment, an infant may apprehend him, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance; <HI>Voyage de Tavernier, tom. 2. p.</HI> 26.</P>
<P>In great hunting matches, the Per&s;ians train ferocious animals to the chace, as lions, tigers, leopards, panthers, and ounces; the latter of which are called <HI>youzze.</HI> They do no injury to man. A hor&s;eman carries one behind him, with its eyes covered by a cloth, and fixed by a chain. When the hunter perceives any game, he uncovers the animal's eyes, and turns his head to the prey. If he &s;pies it, he darts upon it with great bounds, throws him&s;elf upon it, and brings it to the ground. If, after making a few leaps, he mi&s;&s;es his object, he is di&s;couraged, and common|ly &s;tops.

The leopard partakes &s;omething of the lion and &s;omething of the large wild cat. His &s;kin is all marked with round &s;pots of different &s;hades of blackne&s;s upon a gray|i&s;h ground. His head is of a middle &s;ize, his mouth is large, and well armed with teeth, of which the women of that coun|try make necklaces. His tongue is equally rough as that of the lion. His eyes are fiery, and continually in motion. His a&s;pect in cruel, and indicates a perpetual thir&s;t for blood. His ears are round, &s;hort, and always erect. He has a thick &s;hort neck, &s;trong thighs, large feet, five toes on the fore and four on the hind feet, both armed with &s;trong &s;harp claws, which he &s;huts like the fingers of a hand, and never loo&s;es them from his prey till he has torn it in pieces, both with his claws and teeth. Though very rapacious and gluttonous, he is always meagre. The leopards multiply very fa&s;t; but the tigre, who is &s;tronger and more alert, is their deadly foe, and de&s;troys great numbers of them. The Negroes take the ti|ger, the leopard, and the lion, by means of deep pits covered with reeds and a little earth, upon which they place &s;ome dead animal as a bait. <HI>Voyage de De&s;marchais, tom. 1. p.</HI> 202.&mdash;The tiger of Senegal is more furious than the lion. He is nearly about the length and height of a grey-hound. He attacks, indi&s;criminately, man and all other animals. The Negroes kill him with their darts and arrows, in order to procure their &s;kins. Though their bodies be pierced in ma|ny places, they defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t drop of their blood, and often de&s;troy &s;ome of the a&s;&s;ailants; <HI>Voyage de la Maire, p.</HI> 99.</NOTE>

and &s;maller than the panther. His tail, though
two or two and a half feet long, is &s;horter than
that of the ounce.</P>
<P>The leopard of Senegal and Guiney, to which

our knowledge of animals, if we had li&s;ts
of the names given them in the language of the
countries they inhabit.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the leopard appears to be &s;ub|ject
to greater varieties than that of the panther
or ounce. We have examined a great number of
leopard's &s;kins, which differed from each other,
<PB N="185" REF="210">
either in the &s;hades of the ground-colour, or in
tho&s;e of the annular &s;pots, &s;ome of which were
more di&s;tinctly defined than others. But the&s;e
rings are always &s;maller than tho&s;e of the pan|ther
or ounce. In all leopards &s;kins, the &s;pots
are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize and figure; and their
chief difference con&s;i&s;ts in the deepne&s;s or light|ne&s;s
of their colours. The ground-colour of the
&s;kin differs only in being of a more or le&s;s deep
yellow. But, as all the&s;e &s;kins are nearly of the
&s;ame &s;ize, both in the body and tail, it is pro|bable
that they belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies of
animal.</P>
<P>The panther, the ounce, and the leopard, inha|bit
Africa, and the warme&s;t climates of A&s;ia only.
They have never &s;pread over the northern, or
even the temperate regions. Ari&s;totle mentions
the panther as an African and A&s;iatic animal,
and &s;ays expre&s;sly, that it exi&s;ted not in Europe.
Hence the&s;e animals, which &s;eem to be confined
to the Torrid Zone of the Old Continent, could
never pa&s;s over to the New by the northern lands;
and we &s;hall find, by the de&s;criptions we are to
give of the American animals of this genus, that
they are different &s;pecies, and ought not to be
confounded, as mo&s;t of our nomenclators have
done, with tho&s;e of A&s;ia or Africa.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals, in general, delight in the thick|e&s;t
fore&s;ts, and often frequent the banks of rivers,
and the environs of &s;eque&s;trated habitations,
where they endeavour to &s;urpri&s;e dome&s;tic ani|mals,
<PB N="186" REF="211">
and the wild bea&s;ts which come to the ri|vers
in que&s;t of water. They &s;eldom attack
men, even when provoked. They climb trees
with great ea&s;e, where they pur&s;ue cats, and o|ther
animals, which &s;eldom e&s;cape them. Though
they live &s;olely on prey, and are commonly
meagre, travellers pretend that their fle&s;h is not
bad to eat. It is, indeed, eaten by the Indians
and Negroes; but they prefer the fle&s;h of the
dog, which they con&s;ider as the mo&s;t delicious
food. With regard to their &s;kins, they are all
valuable, and make excellent furs. The mo&s;t
beautiful and deare&s;t is that of the leopard, one
of which, when the yellow is bright, and the
&s;pots very black and well defined, co&s;ts eight or
ten louis-d'ors.</P>

<P>THE jaguar re&s;embles the ounce in &s;ize of
body, in the figure of mo&s;t of the &s;pots,
and even in di&s;po&s;itions. He is not &s;o bold as
the leopard or panther. Like the leopard, the
<PB N="188" REF="217">
ground-colour of his hair is a beautiful yellow, and
not gray like the ounce. His tail is &s;horter than
that of either of the&s;e animals: His hair is long|er
than that of the panther, and &s;horter than that
of the ounce: It is cri&s;ped when young, and
&s;mooth when he arrives at full growth. We
have never &s;een this animal alive; but had one
&s;ent us well pre&s;erved in &s;pirits; and it is from
this &s;ubject that our figure and de&s;cription have
been taken. It had been taken young, and
brought up in the hou&s;e till it was two years old,
when it was killed, in order to be tran&s;mitted to
us<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This animal was &s;ent to us by M. Pag&eacute;s, King's phy&s;i|cian at St Domingo, under the name of <HI>Chat-tigre.</HI> M. Pag&eacute;s remarks, in his letter, that this animal was brought from the Continent, where it is very common, to St Domingo, in a Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;el. He adds, that it was two years of age when he ordered it to be killed; that it had &s;welled in the &s;pirits; that it eat, drank, and uttered the &s;ame cry as the wild cat; and that it mewed, and preferred fi&s;h to fle&s;h: Pi&s;o and Marcgrave likewi&s;e tell us, that the jaguars of Bra|&s;il are very fond of fi&s;h.

dimen&s;ions. But, it was evident, from the bare

he could not exceed the &s;ize of an ordinary dog.

of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Pi&s;o and Marcgrave re|mark,

the jaguar by having &s;horter, more bright, and
differently coloured hair, which is black, varie|gated

of the &s;ame &s;pecies; e&s;pecially as Pi&s;o informs us,

hair, and that of the &s;pots, vary in different in|dividuals

of gray, yellow, or black colours, the &s;ame thing
takes place in other &s;pecies of animals. There
are black wolves, black foxes, black &s;quirrels,
&amp;c. If &s;uch variations are rarer among wild
than dome&s;tic animals, the phaenomenon mu&s;t
be a&s;cribed to the former being liable to fewer
accidents which can produce &s;uch changes. As
the life of the former is more uniform, their
food le&s;s various, and their liberty greater than
tho&s;e of the latter, their nature mu&s;t likewi&s;e be

<HEAD>The JAGUAR of NEW SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>In the month of June 1775, a female jaguar
was &s;ent to M. Le Brun from New Spain. It
was very young; for all its teeth had not yet
appeared, and it has &s;ince grown larger at Chail|lot,
where M. de Seve made a drawing of it in
the beginning of October. We reckon it to be
about nine or ten months old. His length, from
the muzzle to the anus, was one foot eleven
inches, and the height of its hind train from
thirteen to fourteen inches. The jaguar de&s;cribed
in the original work, was two feet five inches four
lines long, and the height of the hind train one
foot four inches nine lines: But it was two years
of age. Though belonging to different countries,
there is a great &s;imilarity between the&s;e two ani|mals.
The differences in the form of the &s;pots &s;eem
to be only individual varieties. The iris is of a
brown colour inclining to green; the edges of
the eyes are black, with a white band both above
and below. The colour of the head is yellow
blended with gray, which is al&s;o the ground-co|lour
of the &s;pots; and the latter are bordered
with black bands. The&s;e &s;pots and bands are
grounded on a dirty reddi&s;h white colour, in|clining
more or le&s;s to gray. The ears are
black, with a very large white &s;pot on their ex|ternal
part. The tail is long, and well covered
with hair.</P>

<HEAD>The JAGUAR of GUIANA.</HEAD>
<P>M. Sonini de Manoncour has made &s;ome ex|cellent
remarks on the jaguars of Guiana, which
I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe.</P>
<P>&startq;The hair of the young jaguar,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;is
not cri&s;ped, as M. de Buffon alledges. I have
&s;een young jaguars with hair as &s;mooth as that
of adults. This ob&s;ervation has been confirm|ed
by the mo&s;t experienced hunters. With
regard to their &s;ize, in&s;tead of only equalling,
as M. de Buffon remarks, that of an ordinary
dog, I have had two &s;kins, which I was a&s;&s;ured
belonged to &s;ubjects of two or three years old,
and one of them mea&s;ured near five feet from
the muzzle to the tail, which was two feet
long. I have my&s;elf &s;een, in the fore&s;ts of
Guiana, tracks of the&s;e animals, which induced
me, as well as M. de la Condamine, to think,
that the American animals called tigers were
as large as tho&s;e of Africa. I even think, that,
excepting the true, or royal tiger, the Ameri|can
tiger is the large&s;t animal to which this
appellation is given; &s;ince, according to M. de
Buffon, the panther, which is the large&s;t of
the&s;e animals, exceeds not, when full grown,
five or &s;ix feet in length; and it is certain
that there are quadrupeds of this kind which
greatly &s;urpa&s;s the&s;e dimen&s;ions. The colour
of the jaguar varies with age. When young,
<PB N="195" REF="224">
he is of a very deep yellow, approaching to red,
or even brown. This colour brightens in pro|portion
as the animal increa&s;es in years.&endq;</P>
<P>The jaguar is not that indolent animal he
has been repre&s;ented by &s;ome travellers, whom
M. de Buffon has copied. In&s;tead of being
afraid of dogs, he &s;prings upon them wherever
he meets them. He makes great havock a|mong
the flocks. Tho&s;e which inhabit the de|&s;erts
of Guiana are even formidable to men.
In a journey I made through the&s;e great fore&s;ts,
we were tormented two nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by
a jaguar, notwith&s;tanding a large fire, which
was kept perpetually blazing. He roamed
continually round us; and we found it impo&s;|&s;ible
to &s;hoot him; for we no &s;ooner aimed at
him than he di&s;appeared in a moment, then re|turned
on the other &s;ide, and in this manner
kept us in perpetual alarm. Notwith&s;tanding
all our vigilance, we could never &s;hoot him.
He continued the&s;e manoeuvres during two
complete nights. He returned on the third:
But, &s;eemingly di&s;gu&s;ted by not obtaining his
end, and perceiving that we had augmented
our fire, which he was afraid to approach too
near, he left us with dreadful howlings. His
cry, <HI>hou, hou,</HI> is &s;omewhat plaintive, grave,
and &s;trong, like that of the ox.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With regard to the &s;uppo&s;ed predilection of
the jaguar to the natives of the country, rather
than to the Negroes or Whites, I &s;u&s;pect
<PB N="196" REF="225">
&s;trongly that it is fabulous. I found this no|tion
e&s;tabli&s;hed at Cayenne: But I travelled
along with &s;avages through places where the
large&s;t tigers are common, and never di&s;cover|ed
that they entertained any remarkable degree
of terror at the&s;e animals. Like us, they &s;u|&s;pended
their hammocks on trees, removed to
a certain di&s;tance from us, and contented them|&s;elves
with kindling a &s;mall fire, which fre|quently
went out in the cour&s;e of the night.
The&s;e &s;avages, however, were inhabitants of

with terror. The ant-eater, though he has no
teeth to defend him&s;elf, is the mo&s;t cruel ene|my
the jaguars have to encounter. As &s;oon
as the jaguar attacks the ant-eater, it lies down
on its back, and &s;eizes and &s;uffocates him with
its long claws.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>THE COUGUAR<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The couguar, or brown cat, has a very little head, &s;mall pointed ears, large eyes, a white chin, and the back, neck, rump, and &s;ides, of a pale browni&s;h red colour, mixed with du&s;ky hairs. The brea&s;t, belly, and in&s;ide of the legs, are cinereous. The hair on the belly is long; the tail is du&s;ky and ferruginous, but black at the tip. The teeth are of a va&s;t &s;ize, and the claws are white, the outmo&s;t one of the fore-feet being much longer than the others. It is long bodied, and high on its legs.

<HEAD>The COUGUAR of PENSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Jaguar, as well as the Couguar, inhabit
the warme&s;t regions of South America. But
there is another &s;pecies of Couguar (of which we
have given a figure) found in the temperate cli|mates
of North America, as on the mountains of
Carolina, Georgia, Pen&s;ylvania, and the adjacent
provinces. The drawing of this couguar was
&s;ent me from England by the late Mr Colin&s;on,
with the following de&s;cription: If it is exact, this
couguar mu&s;t differ greatly from the common
kind.</P>
<P>&startq;The Couguar of Pen&s;ylvania,&endq; &s;ays Mr Co|lin&s;on,
&startq;differs much from the couguar of Cay|enne,
(above de&s;cribed). His limbs are &s;horter,
<PB N="201" REF="233">
his body much longer, and his tail is al&s;o three
or four inches longer. But, in the colour of
the hair, and the form of the head and ears,
they have a perfect re&s;emblance to each other.
The couguar of Pen&s;ylvania,&endq; adds Mr Colin&s;on,
&startq;is an animal remarkable for thinne&s;s and length
of body, &s;hortne&s;s of legs, and length of tail.
The length of the body, from the muzzle to the
anus, is five feet four inches; and that of the
tail is two feet &s;ix inches. The fore-legs are
one foot long, and the hind-legs one foot three
inches. The height of the body before is one
foot nine inches, and one foot ten inches behind.
The circumference of the thicke&s;t part of the
body is two feet three inches<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr Colin&s;on's letter to M. de Buffon, April 30. 1763.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>THE BLACK COUGUAR.</HEAD>
<P>M. de la BORDE, King's phy&s;ician at Ca|yenne,
informs me, that in the Continent there
are three &s;pecies of rapacious animals; that the
fir&s;t is the jaguar, which is called the <HI>tiger;</HI> that
<PB N="202" REF="234">
the &s;econd is the couguar, called the <HI>red tiger,</HI> on
account of the uniform redne&s;s of his hair; that
the jaguar is of the &s;ize of a large bull-dog, and
weighs about 200 pounds; that the couguar is
&s;maller, le&s;s dangerous, and not &s;o frequent in
the neighbourhood of Cayenne as the jaguar;
and that both the&s;e animals take &s;ix years in ac|quiring
their full growth. He adds, that there
is a third &s;pecies in the&s;e countries, called the
<HI>black tiger,</HI> of which we have given a figure un|der
the appellation of the <HI>black couguar.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;The head,&endq; &s;ays M. de la Borde, &startq;is pretty
&s;imilar to that of the common couguar; but the
animal has long black hair, and likewi&s;e a long
tail, with &s;trong whi&s;kers. He weighs not a|bove
forty pounds. The female brings forth
her young in the hollows of old trees<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>To this de&s;cription we &s;hall add that given by Mr Pen|nant, which is more accurate, though &s;omewhat different from that communicated by M. de la Borde to M. de Buffon.</P>

<P>This de&s;cription was taken from two black couguars which were &s;hown in London &s;ome years ago.</P>&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="235">
This black couguar may be the &s;ame animal
which Pi&s;o and Marcgrave call the <HI>jaguarette,</HI> or
<HI>jaguar with black hair,</HI> and which no other tra|veller
has mentioned under the name of <HI>jagua|rette.</HI>
I only find, in a note of M. Sonini de
Manoncour, that the jaguarette is called the <HI>black
tiger</HI> at Cayenne, and that he is of a different
&s;pecies from the jaguar, being &s;maller, and thin|ner
in the body. This animal is fierce and ra|pacious;
but he is very rare in the neighbour|hood
of Cayenne.</P>
<P>&startq;The jaguars and couguars,&endq; continues M. de
la Borde, &startq;are very common in all the lands
which border on the river of the Amazons, as far
as Saint Martha. Their &s;kin is &s;o tender as to
be ea&s;ily pierced by the &s;imple arrows of the
Indians. Be&s;ides, all the&s;e animals are not ab|&s;olutely
covetous of carnage; for a &s;ingle prey
always &s;atisfies them. They go generally a|lone;
but, when the females are in &s;ea&s;on,
&s;ometimes two or three of them are &s;een toge|ther.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When pre&s;&s;ed with hunger, they attack cows
and oxen. They &s;pring upon the back of an
ox, fix the claws of their left foot upon his
neck, and, when he falls down, they tear him
in pieces; and, after opening his brea&s;t and belly
to glut them&s;elves with blood, they trail por|tions
of his fle&s;h into the wood. They then
cover the remainder of the carca&s;s with bran|ches
of trees, and never remove to any great
<PB N="204" REF="236">
di&s;tance. But, as &s;oon as the fle&s;h begins to
corrupt, they eat no more of it. Sometimes they
conceal them&s;elves in trees, and dart down up|on
pa&s;&s;ing animals. They likewi&s;e follow the
flocks of wild hogs, and &s;eize the &s;tragglers.
But, if ever they allow them&s;elves to be &s;ur|rounded
by the&s;e animals, they have no &s;afety
but in a precipitate retreat.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But neither the jaguars nor couguars are ab|&s;olutely
ferocious: They never attack men, un|le&s;s
when they feel them&s;elves wounded. But
they de&s;pi&s;e the a&s;&s;aults of dogs, whom they
often &s;eize in the very neighbourhood of hou&s;es.
When pur&s;ued by &s;uch a number of dogs as o|bliges
them to fly, they take refuge in the trees.
The&s;e animals often roam about the margins of the
&s;ea, and eat the eggs depo&s;ited there by the turtles.
They likewi&s;e eat <HI>ca&iuml; mans,</HI> or alligators, lizards,
fi&s;hes, and &s;ometimes the buds and tender leaves
of the Indian fig. They are excellent &s;wim|mers,
and traver&s;e the large&s;t rivers. In taking
the <HI>ca&iuml;man,</HI> they lie down on their belly at the
edge of the river, &s;trike the water to make a
noi&s;e, and attrack the attention of the <HI>ca&iuml;man,</HI>
who &s;oon approaches, and rai&s;es his head above
the water, upon which the jaguar in&s;tantly
makes his deadly &s;pring, and, after killing the
animal, drags him off to a di&s;tance, in order to
devour him at his lei&s;ure.&endq;</P>

white as that of a rabbit<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Extract from ob&s;ervations &s;ent from M. de la Borde to M. de Buffon in the year 1774.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>

They have &s;hown, that the Lynx of
Aelian is the &s;ame animal which they have de|&s;cribed
and di&s;&s;ected, and they cen&s;ure, with pro|priety,
tho&s;e who have mi&s;taken it for the <HI>thos</HI>
of Ari&s;totle. This di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is intermixed with
remarks and reflections which are pertinent and
intere&s;ting. After clearing their ground with &s;o
much addre&s;s, we wi&s;h they had retained the
true name <HI>lynx,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ub&s;tituting that of <HI>lu|pus
cervarius.</HI> They appear likewi&s;e, after ma|king
a proper di&s;tinction, with Oppian, of two
different &s;pecies or races of the lynx, the one
large, which hunts and attacks the fallow deer
and the &s;tag, and the other &s;maller, which hunts
the hare only, to have blended the two together,
namely, the &s;potted lynx, which is commonly
found in the northern countries, and the Levant
or Barbary lynx, who&s;e hair is of a uniform co|lour.
We have &s;een both the&s;e animals alive.
They re&s;emble each other in many re&s;pects.
They have both two long black pencils of hair
on the tips of their ears. This character, under
which Aelian fir&s;t pointed out the lynx, is pecu|liar
to the&s;e two animals, and probably led the
gentlemen of the Academy to regard them as
con&s;tituting but one &s;pecies. But, independent
of the difference of colour and &s;pots of the hair,
<PB N="208" REF="244">
the following hi&s;tory and de&s;cription will render
it extremely probable that they are di&s;tinct &s;pe|cies.</P>
<P>M. Klein &s;ays<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Klein de quad. p. 77.</NOTE>, that the mo&s;t beautiful lynx is
a native of Africa and A&s;ia, and particularly of
Per&s;ia; that he &s;aw one at Dre&s;den that had been
brought from Africa, which was finely &s;potted,
and &s;tood high on its limbs; that tho&s;e of Eu|rope,
e&s;pecially of Pru&s;&s;ia and the northern re|gions,
are le&s;s hand&s;ome; that they have little
or no white, but are rather red, with blotched
and ill-defined &s;pots, &amp;c. I choo&s;e not to deny
ab&s;olutely what M. Klein has here advanced.
I have never &s;een it mentioned, however, by
any other author, that the lynx is a native of
the warm countries of A&s;ia and Africa. Kolbe<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 63.</NOTE>
is the only writer who affirms, that the lynx is
common at the Cape of Good Hope, and perfectly
re&s;embles that of Brandenburgh, and the north
of Europe. But I have di&s;covered &s;o many er|rors
in the works of this author, that I give no
credit to his te&s;timony, unle&s;s when it coincides
with that of others. Now, all travellers agree
in having &s;een the &s;potted lynx in the north of

and other northern regions of both Con|tinents.
But no author, who&s;e writings I have
peru&s;ed, a&s;&s;erts that the lynx is to be met with
in the warm regions of Africa or A&s;ia. The
<PB N="209" REF="245">
lynx of the Levant, of Barbary, of Arabia, and
other hot climates, are, as formerly remarked, of
one uniform colour, without any &s;pots: He is
not, therefore, the lynx of M. Klein, which was
&s;inely &s;potted, nor that of Kolbe, which perfect|ly
re&s;embled tho&s;e of Bradenburgh. It would
be a difficult ta&s;k to reconcile the evidence of
tho&s;e authors with what we learn from other
&s;ources. The lynx is unque&s;tionably more com|mon
in cold than in temperate climates, and he
is, at lea&s;t, very rare in warm countries. He
was, indeed, known to the Greeks<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Greeks, who, in their fictions, always pre&s;erved &s;ome appearance of truth, e&s;pecially with regard to times and places, &s;ay, that it was a King of <HI>Scythia</HI> who was changed into the lynx; which &s;eems to indicate that the lynx was a Scythian animal.</NOTE> and Ro|mans.
But, from this circum&s;tance, it is not to
be inferred, that he was brought from Africa, or
the &s;outhern provinces of A&s;ia. Pliny, on the
contrary, &s;ays, that the fir&s;t of the&s;e animals,
which ever appeared in Rome, were &s;ent from
Gaul in the days of Pompey. At pre&s;ent there
are none in France, unle&s;s perhaps in the Alps
or Pyrenees. Under the name of <HI>Gaul,</HI> how|ever,
the Romans comprehended a great part of
the North; and, be&s;ides, France is now much
warmer than it was in the time of the Romans.
The fine&s;t &s;kins of the lynx come from Siberia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Ru&s;&s;ia, the lynxes are very common; their &s;kins are beautiful, but not near &s;o valuable as tho&s;e of Siberia; <HI>Nouv, Mem. &s;ur la Grande Ru&s;&s;ie, tom. 2. p.</HI> 73.</NOTE>,

<P>The following circum&s;tances might deceive
M. Klein, and even men of greater ability:
1. The antients &s;ay, that India furni&s;hed lynxes
to the God Bacchus<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Victa racemifero lyncas dedit India Baccho; <HI>Ovid. Me|tamorph.</HI></NOTE>; 2. Pliny has placed the

As Pliny has &s;poken of it, the authority of &s;o
great a man induced me to &s;end you a draw|ing

different from the German lynx, being larger,

without making any reflections on this letter,
contents him&s;elf with relating the &s;ub&s;tance of
it, and informing us, in a parenthe&s;is, that the

<P>To prevent &s;imilar mi&s;takes, let us ob&s;erve,
1. That the poets and painters have yoked the
chariot of Bacchus with tigers, panthers, or
lynxes, according to their own fancy, or rather,
becau&s;e all ferocious animals, with &s;potted &s;kins,
were equally con&s;ecrated to this God. 2. That
it is the word <HI>lynx</HI> which creates all this ambi|guity;
for it is evident, by comparing different
<PB N="212" REF="248">
pa&s;&s;ages of Pliny with each other<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pompeii Magni primum ludi o&s;tenderunt Chaum, quem Galli Rhaphium vocabant, effigie lupi, pardorum maculis; <HI>Plinii, lib. 8. c.</HI> 19.&mdash;Sunt in eo genere (&s;cilicet luporum), qui cervarii vocantur, qualem &eacute; Gallia in Pompeii Magni harena &s;pectatum diximus; <HI>Plin. lib. 8. c.</HI> 22.&mdash;Lyncas vulgo fre|quentes et &s;phingas, fu&s;co pilo, mammis in pectore geminis, Aethiopia generat, multaque alia mon&s;tro &s;imilia; <HI>Plin. lib. 8. c.</HI> 21.&mdash;From the&s;e three pa&s;&s;ages, it is apparent, that the <HI>chaus</HI> and the <HI>lupus-cervarius</HI> are the &s;ame animal, and that the lynx is a different creature. Pliny &s;eems to have been deceived by the name, when he tells us that the figure of the lynx re&s;embled that of the wolf. The lynx, like the wolf, is an animal of prey, nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, and howls &s;ome|thing like the wolf; but, in every other article, the&s;e animals are totally different.</NOTE>, that the Aethi|opian
animal he calls <HI>lynx,</HI> is by no means the

a &s;imilar mi&s;application of the name, the Baron
de Balicze has been deceived, though he regards
the Indian lynx as a different animal from the
German <HI>luchs,</HI> or our lynx. This African or
Indian lynx, which he &s;ays was larger and more
beautifully &s;potted than our lynx, was perhaps a
kind of panther. Whatever may be in this la&s;t
conjecture, it is plain, that the lynx, of which we
are here treating, exi&s;ts not in warm climates,
but is confined to the northern countries of the
Old and New Continents. Olaus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de gent. &s;eptent. ab Olao Magno, lib. 18. p. 139.</NOTE> &s;ays, that

Lentilius tells us, that the lynx is common

the qualities they have a&s;cribed to him. This
imaginary lynx has no other relation to the true
lynx than the name. We mu&s;t not, therefore,
in imitation of mo&s;t naturali&s;ts, attribute to the
former, which is a real being, the qualities of
this creature of imagination, the exi&s;tence of
which even Pliny him&s;elf &s;eems not to believe;
for he &s;peaks of it as an extraordinary animal,
and ranks it along with the &s;phynx, the pega&s;us,
the unicorn, and other prodigies or mon&s;ters
brought forth in Aethiopia, a country of which
the antients had no knowledge.</P>
<P>Our lynx, though his &s;ight cannot penetrate
&s;tone-walls, has brilliant eyes, a mild a&s;pect, and
an agreeable and &s;prightly air. His urine is not
converted into precious &s;tones; but he covers it
with earth, like the cats, to whom he has a great
re&s;emblance, and who&s;e manners and love of
cleanline&s;s are the &s;ame. He has nothing in
common with the wolf, but a kind of howling,
which, being heard at a great di&s;tance, often de|ceives
the hunters, and makes them imagine they
are pur&s;uing a wolf. This alone is, perhaps,
<PB N="216" REF="252">
&s;ufficient to account for the name <HI>wolf,</HI> which
has been given to him, and to which, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
him from the real wolf, the hunters have
added the epithet <HI>cervarius,</HI> becau&s;e he attacks
the &s;tag; or rather becau&s;e his &s;kin is variegated
with &s;pots like that of the young &s;tag. The lynx
is &s;maller, and &s;tands lower on his legs than the
wolf<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lynces no&s;trae lupis minores &s;unt, tergo maculo&s;ae; <HI>Stu$rph$$s.</HI></NOTE>. He is generally about the &s;ize of a fox.
He differs from the panther and ounce by the
following characters: His hair is longer, and his
&s;pots le&s;s lively and not &s;o well defined. His
ears are much longer, and terminate in a
pencil of black hair. His tail is much &s;horter,
and black at the extremity. The circle of his
eyes is white, and his a&s;pect is &s;ofter and le&s;s fe|rocious.
The &s;kin of the male is more &s;potted
than that of the female. He does not run out,
like the wolf, but walks and &s;prings like the cat.
He lives by hunting, and pur&s;ues his prey to the
tops of the highe&s;t trees. The wild cats, the
pine wea&s;els, the ermines, and the &s;quirrels, are
unable to e&s;cape him. He likewi&s;e &s;eizes birds;
and watches the approach of &s;tags, fallow-deer,
hares, &amp;c. darts down upon them, &s;eizes them
by the throat, &s;ucks their blood, and opens their
&s;kull to devour their brain; after which, he of|ten
abandons them, and goes in que&s;t of a fre&s;h
game. He &s;eldom returns to his prey; which
is the rea&s;on why the lynx has been &s;aid to have
<PB N="217" REF="253">
a very bad memory. The colour of his hair
changes with the climate and the &s;ea&s;on. The
winter furs are more beautiful and richer than
tho&s;e of &s;ummer. His fle&s;h, like that of all car|nivorous
animals, is not good<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rzaczyn&s;ky, auct. Hi&s;t. Nat. Pol p. 314.</NOTE>.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We here give the figure of a Canadian lynx
from an excellent preparation in the royal Ca|binet.
It is only two feet three inches long
from the tip of the no&s;e to the origin of the tail,
and from twelve to thirteen inches high. The
body is covered with long grayi&s;h hair, mixed
with white, and &s;triped with yellow. The &s;pots
are more or le&s;s black. The head is grayi&s;h,
blended with white and bright yellow hairs, and
&s;triped, as it were, with black in &s;ome parts.
The tip of the no&s;e, as well as the margin of the
under jaw, is black. The whi&s;kers are white,
and about three inches long. The ears are two
inches three lines high, garni&s;hed in the in&s;ide
with large white hairs, and with yellowi&s;h hairs
on the edges. The outer &s;ide of the ear is co|vered
with mou&s;e-coloured hair, and the exter|nal
margins are black. At the extremity of each
ear, there is a large thin pencil of black hairs,
<PB N="218" REF="254">
&s;even lines high. The tail, which is thick, &s;hort,
and well furni&s;hed with hair, is only three inches
nine lines in length; from the extremity to the
middle, it is black, and afterwards of a reddi&s;h
white colour. The under part of the belly, the
hind legs, and the in&s;ide of the fore-legs, and the
feet, are of a dirty white. The claws are white,
and about &s;ix lines long. This lynx has a great
re&s;emblance, both in the &s;pots and nature of the
hair, to that who&s;e figure we have given; but
it differs in the length of the tail and the pen|cils
on the ears. The Canadian lynx, therefore,
may be regarded as a variety very different from
the lynx of the Old Continent. It may even be
&s;aid to make a near approach to the caracal, by
the pencils on its ears; but it differs from the
caracal &s;till more than from the lynx, by the
length of the tail and the colour of the hair.
Be&s;ides, the caracal is only found in warm coun|tries;
but the lynx prefers cold climates. The
pencil of hair upon the tips of the ears, which is
regarded as a di&s;tinctive character, is only acci|dental,
and appears in animals of this &s;pecies, and
even in the dome&s;tic and wild cats. Of this we
have given an example in the &s;upplement to the
article <HI>cat.</HI> Hence we per&s;i&s;t in believing that
the American lynx is only a variety of the Eu|ropean
lynx.</P>
<P>The Norwegian lynx, de&s;cribed by Pontoppi|dan,
is white, or of a bright gray colour, inter|&s;per&s;ed
with deep &s;pots. Its claws, like tho&s;e of
<PB N="219" REF="255">
other lynxes, re&s;emble the claws of cats. He
elevates his back, and &s;prings upon his prey with
equal quickne&s;s and addre&s;s. When attacked by
a dog, he turns upon his back, and repels the e|nemy
by repeated &s;trokes of his claws. This
author adds, that there are, in Norway, four
&s;pecies; that &s;ome of them approach the figure
of the wolf, others that of the fox, others that of
the cat, and, la&s;tly, there are others who&s;e head
re&s;embles that of a colt. This la&s;t fact, which I
believe to be fal&s;e, creates the mo&s;t violent &s;u&s;pi|cion
with regard to all the re&s;t. The author
adds &s;ome articles which are more probable.</P>
<P>&startq;The lynx,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;does not run along
the country, but conceals him&s;elf in woods and
caverns. He makes his retreat deep and wind|ing,
from which he can be expelled only by
fire and &s;moke. His &s;ight is piercing, and he
&s;pies his prey at a very great di&s;tance. He of|ten
eats no more of a &s;heep or goat than the
brain, the liver, and the inte&s;tines; and he
digs under the doors, in order to gain admi&s;|&s;ion
into the &s;heep-folds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pontoppidan's Nat. Hi&s;t. of Norway.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the lynx is not only &s;pread
over Europe, but all the northern provinces of
A&s;ia. In Tartary, they are called <HI>Chulon</HI> or
<HI>Chela&s;on</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Voyages, tom. 6. p. 602.</NOTE>. Their &s;kins are highly valued, and,
though very common, they &s;ell equally dear in
<PB N="220" REF="256">
Norway, Ru&s;&s;ia, and as far as China, where they
are much u&s;ed for muffs, and other furs.</P>
<P>That the pencils of hair on the tips of the ears
is not a di&s;tinctive character, appears from this
fact, that there exi&s;ts, in the di&s;trict of Alger,
called <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> a &s;pecies of caracal, without
the&s;e pencils, and which re&s;embles the lynx, ex|cepting
that its tail is longer. The colour of its
hair is reddi&s;h, with longitudinal black &s;tripes
from the neck to the tail, detached &s;pots on the
flanks di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame direction, a black half-circle
on the top of the fore-legs, and a band of
rough hair on the four legs, extending from the
extremity of the foot to above the heel; and this
hair inclines upward, in&s;tead of downward, like
the hair of every other part of the body.</P>

<P>THOUGH the caracal re&s;embles the lynx in
&s;ize, figure, a&s;pect, and the pencil of black
hair on the tips of the ears, we are of opinion,
from the di&s;parities between the&s;e two animals,
that they belong to different &s;pecies. The ca|racal
is not &s;potted like the lynx; his hair is
rougher and &s;horter; his tail is longer, and of
a uniform colour; his muzzle is al&s;o more
lengthened; his a&s;pect is le&s;s mild, and his
di&s;po&s;ition more ferocious. The lynx inha|bits
only cold or temperate climates; the cara|cal
is never found but in warm countries. It
<PB N="222" REF="260">
is from the&s;e differences of di&s;po&s;ition and cli|mate
that we have judged them to belong to
different &s;pecies, as well as from the in&s;pection
and compari&s;on of the two animals, both of
which we have examined and drawn from the
life.</P>
<P>This animal is common in Barbary, in Arabia,
and in all the countries inhabited by the lion, the
panther, and the ounce. Like them, he lives on
prey; but, being &s;maller and weaker, it is with
difficulty he procures &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; for he is ge|nerally
obliged to be contented with what they
leave. He keeps at a di&s;tance from the panther,
becau&s;e that animal exerci&s;es its cruelties after
being fully gorged with prey. But he follows
the lion, which, after a full repa&s;t, never injures
any creature. The caracal fea&s;ts upon the of|fals
of the lion's table, and &s;ometimes accompa|nies
him at no great di&s;tance, having nothing to
apprehend from his rage, becau&s;e he is unable,
like the panther, to pur&s;ue the caracal to the
tops of the talle&s;t trees. For all the&s;e rea&s;ons
the caracal has been called the lion's guide or
provider<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The karacoulacs are animals &s;omewhat larger than cats, and of the &s;ame make. They have black ears, nearly half a foot long, and from this circum&s;tance they derive their name, which &s;ignifies <HI>black ear.</HI> According to the opinion of the na|tives, they &s;erve as pioneers to the lion; for they go a little be|fore, explore tho&s;e places where prey is to be expected, and are rewarded with a &s;hare. When this animal gives the a|larm to the lion, his cry re&s;embles that of one per&s;on to ano|ther, though the voice is con&s;iderably &s;harper. <HI>Voyage de Thevenot, tom. 2. p.</HI> 114.</NOTE>.

<P>The caracal is about the &s;ize of a fox, but
much &s;tronger and more ferocious. He has
been known to attack and in&s;tantly tear to pieces
a middle-&s;ized dog, which defended it&s;elf as
long as it was able. He is extremely difficult
to tame. However, when taken young, and
reared with care, he may be trained to hunting,

an employment of which he is naturally fond,
and in which he is very &s;ucce&s;sfull, e&s;pecially if
he is never let loo&s;e upon any animal that is not
his inferior in &s;trength; for he lo&s;es courage, as
&s;oon as he perceives real danger. In India, he is
employed for catching hares, rabbits, and even
large birds, whom he &s;urpri&s;es, and &s;iezes with

caracal is rounder, the ears black on the

&s;mall bright yellow &s;pots, and not blacki&s;h brown,
as in the Barbary caracal. The&s;e are only &s;light
varieties, the number of which might be &s;till
augmented; for we find in Barbary, or rather
in Lybia, near the antient Cap&s;a, a caracal with
white, in&s;tead of black ears. The pencils of
the&s;e white-eared caracals are thin, &s;hort, and

other much &s;maller, with white ears and very

<P>THOUGH Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;tot. hi&s;t. anim. lib. 6. c. 32. lib. 8, c. 5.</NOTE> has left us two cha|racters
by which alone this animal is
ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others; yet travel|lers
and naturali&s;ts have confounded the hyaena
with no le&s;s than four different &s;pecies, namely,
the jackal, the glutton, the civet, and the baboon.
They are carnivorous and ferocious, like the
hyaena, and each of them has &s;ome re&s;emblance to
him, which might give ri&s;e to the mi&s;take. The
<PB N="227" REF="267">
jackal inhabits the &s;ame countries, and, like
the hyaena, has nearly the form of a wolf, feeds
upon dead carca&s;&s;es, and digs them out of the
&s;epulchres. The glutton is equally voracious,
has the &s;ame appetite for putrified fle&s;h, the
&s;ame in&s;tinct of digging the dead out of their
graves; and, though he lives in a different cli|mate,
and his figure is very different from that
of the hyaena, this conformity of natural di&s;po&s;i|tions
was &s;ufficient to make authors confound
them together. The civet is found in the &s;ame
countries, and, like the hyaena, has long hair a|long
the back, and a particular fi&s;&s;ure or ori|fice.
The&s;e &s;ingular characters, which belong to
no other animals, mi&s;led Belon into the notion
that the civet was the hyaena of the antients.
The baboon has &s;till le&s;s re&s;emblance to the hy|aena
than the other three; for it has hands and
feet like tho&s;e of a man or a monkey. Naturali&s;ts,
therefore, could only be deceived by the name: In
Barbary, the hyaena, according to Dr Shaw, is
called <HI>dubbah,</HI> and the baboon, according to Mar|mol
and Leo Africanus, is called <HI>dabuh;</HI> and, as
the baboon is found in the &s;ame climates, digs
the earth, and is nearly of the &s;ame form with
the hyaena, the&s;e affinities fir&s;t deceived travel|lers,
and naturali&s;ts copied the blunder, with|out
&s;ufficient examination. Even tho&s;e who have
clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed the&s;e two animals, have gi|ven
to the hyaena the name of <HI>dabuh,</HI> which be|longs
to the baboon. Hence the hyaena is not
<PB N="228" REF="268">
the <HI>dabuh</HI> of the Arabians, nor the <HI>je&s;ef</HI> or <HI>&s;e&s;ef</HI>
of the Africans, as we are told by naturali&s;ts<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Charlet$$, Exercit. p. 14 Bri&s;&s;on. Regn. anim. p. 234.</NOTE>.

are &s;o &s;hort, that his belly nearly reaches to the
ground; he has five toes both on the fore and
hind feet; no mane, and black hair over all the

<P>The civet has nothing in common with the
hyaena, excepting the fi&s;&s;ure or &s;ac under the

It differs from the hyaena in the figure and &s;ize
of the body, being one half &s;maller. Its ears are
&s;hort and covered with hair, while tho&s;e of the
hyaena are long and naked. Be&s;ides, it has
&s;horter limbs, and five toes on each foot; but
the legs of the hyaena are long, and he has on|ly
four toes on each foot. Neither does the
civet dig the earth in que&s;t of dead bodies. It
is, therefore, extremely ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e

<P>By looking at Belon's figure of the <HI>lupus ma|rinus</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Belon, de aquatil. p. 35</NOTE>,
which Ge&s;ner has copied<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner, hi&s;t. quadrup. p. 674.</NOTE>, this animal
might be mi&s;taken for the hyaena, becau&s;e there
is a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance. But his de&s;crip|tion
applies not to our hyaena; for he tells us,
that the <HI>lupus marinus</HI> is an amphibious animal,
which feeds on fi&s;hes, and has &s;ometimes been
&s;een on the coa&s;ts of the Briti&s;h ocean. Be&s;ides,
Belon mentions none of the peculiar characters
which di&s;tingui&s;h the hyaena from all other qua|drupeds.
Belon, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, perhaps, with the
notion that the civet was the hyaena of the an|tients,
has given the figure of the true hyaena,
under the name of <HI>lupus marinus;</HI> for the cha|racters
of the hyaena are &s;o &s;ingular, that it is
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take him. He is, per|haps,
the only quadruped that has four toes on
each foot. Like the badger, he has an orifice
under the tail, which penetrates not into the bo|dy.
He has long, &s;traight, naked ears; a head
&s;horter and more &s;quare than that of the wolf;

it continues to be a female during the whole

the functions of the male, and makes its compa|nion
&s;ubmit to the lot of the female. This &s;tory,
it is apparent, has no other foundation than the
fi&s;&s;ure under the tail, which is common to the
male as well as the female, independent of the
organs of generation peculiar to both &s;exes, which,
in the hyaena, are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of all other
quadrupeds. The hyaena has been &s;aid to imi|tate
the human voice, to remember the names of
&s;hepherds, to call upon, to fa&s;cinate, and to de|prive
them of the power of motion; and, at the
&s;ame time, to terrify the &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, to make
them run from and neglect their flocks, to ren|der
them frantic with love, &amp;c.&mdash;All this might

<P>In the year 1773, I &s;aw a male hyaena at the
fair of St Germain. The hyaena above de&s;cri|bed
was perfectly ferocious; but this male, ha|ving
been tamed when young, was remarkably
gentle; for, though his ma&s;ter often provoked
him with a cudgel, in order to make him erect
his mane, he in&s;tantly afterwards &s;eemed to forget
the affront. He played with his keeper, who
put his hand into the animal's mouth, without
<PB N="238" REF="279">
the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of danger. This hyaena
was preci&s;ely of the &s;ame &s;pecies with that who&s;e
de&s;cription I have formerly given; and I have
nothing to add to it, excepting that the tail of
this male was all white, without any mixture of
other colours. He was &s;omewhat larger than
the fir&s;t, being three feet two inches long, from
the extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the
tail, and carried his head lower than is repre|&s;ented
in the figure. His height was two feet
three inches; and his hair was white, intermix|ed
with &s;treaks and &s;pots of black, both on the
body and legs.</P>
<P>In the &s;outh part of the i&s;land of Mero&euml;, there
are hyaenas much larger than tho&s;e of Barbary.
Their muzzle is longer, and has a greater re&s;em|blance
to that of a dog. This animal is &s;o &s;trong,
that he carries off a man to the di&s;tance of a
league or two, without &s;topping. His hair is
coar&s;e, browner than that of the other kind, and
the tran&s;ver&s;e &s;treaks are blacker. His mane e|rects
not from the head, but from the tail. Mr
Bruce was the fir&s;t who remarked of this hyaena,
as well as that of Syria and Barbary, that, when
forced to fly, they are lame of the left hind-leg,
which continues &s;o remarkably for about a hun|dred
paces, that the animal &s;eems as if he would

<P>IT is the opinion of mo&s;t naturali&s;ts, that the

one &s;pecies of animal. I have &s;een two of the&s;e

e&s;&s;ential relations, both in their external and in|ternal
&s;tructure; but they differ from each other
<PB N="240" REF="281">
by &s;uch a number of other characters, as entitle
them to be regarded as two di&s;tinct &s;pecies. To the
fir&s;t we have pre&s;erved the antient name of <HI>civet,</HI>
and to the &s;econd we have given, for the &s;ake of
di&s;tinction, that of <HI>zibet.</HI> The civet appears to be
the &s;ame with that de&s;cribed by the gentlemen of
the Academy in the <HI>Mem. pour &s;ervir a l'hi&s;toire
des animaux,</HI> by Caius in Ge&s;ner, <HI>p.</HI> 873. and by

male and female in the work of Jean Faber,
which is at the end of that of Hernandes<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hernandes, hi&s;t. Mex. p. 580.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;pecies, which I have called <HI>the

de&s;cribed by M. de la Peyronnie, under the
name of <HI>the mu&s;k animal,</HI> in the <HI>Mem. de

from the civet by the &s;ame characters; both
<PB N="241" REF="282">
want the mane or long hair on the &s;pine;
and both have annulated tails. But the civet
has neither mane nor rings. It mu&s;t be al|lowed,
however, that our zibet and the mu&s;k a|nimal
of M. de la Peyronnie, have not &s;uch a per|fect
re&s;emblance as to leave no doubt concerning
the identity of their &s;pecies. In the zibet, the
rings on the tail are larger than tho&s;e of the
mu&s;k animal. The former has not a double
collar, and his tail is &s;horter in proportion to the
length of his body. But the&s;e differences are
&s;light, and appear to be only accidental varieties,
to which the civet mu&s;t be more liable than o|ther
wild animals, becau&s;e he is kept in a do|me&s;tic
&s;tate in many parts of India and the Le|vant.
It is certain, however, that our zibet
has a greater re&s;emblance to the mu&s;k animal
of M. de la Peyronnie than to the civet, and,
con&s;equently, the two former may be regarded
as belonging to the &s;ame &s;pecies; for we have
no ab&s;olute certainty that the civet and zibet
are not varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies, becau&s;e we
are ignorant whether they can intermix and pro|duce
fertile individuals: And, when we &s;ay,

&s;omewhat concave on the upper part; while the
muzzle of the civet is thicker, &s;horter, and a lit|tle
convex. The ears of the former are al&s;o
larger, and more erect. His tail is longer, and
better marked with annular &s;pots, and his hair
is &s;horter and &s;ofter. He has no mane, or long
hair on the neck and &s;pine, no black &s;pots un|der
the eyes, or on the cheeks, which are re|markable

<P>The error of Gregoire de Bolivar, with re|gard
to the climates which give birth to the ci|vets,
has been more generally diffu&s;ed than that
of Belon. After telling us that they are com|mon
in Africa and the Ea&s;t Indies, he a&s;&s;erts po|&s;itively,
that they are very numerous in every
part of South America. This a&s;&s;ertion, tran&s;|mitted
to us by Faber, has been copied by Al|drovandus,
and adopted by all &s;ucceeding wri|ters
on the &s;ubject. It is certain, however, that
the civets are peculiar to the warm climates of
the Old Continent, and could never pa&s;s by the
north into America, where, in fact, in civets e|ver
exi&s;ted till they were tran&s;ported from the
Philippine i&s;lands, and the coa&s;t of Africa. But,
as the a&s;&s;ertion of Bolivar is po&s;itive, and mine
only negative, I mu&s;t give my rea&s;ons for pro|ving
the fal&s;ity of the fact. To enable the read|er

our civet as an American animal, becau&s;e it was

covered up with great care. This operation is
repeated two or three times a-week. The quan|tity
of odorous humour depends much on the
quality of the nouri&s;hment, and the appetite of
the animal, which always produces more in pro|portion
to the goodne&s;s of its food. Boiled fle&s;h,
eggs, rice, &s;mall animals, birds, young poultry,

<P>THE Genet is a &s;maller animal than the
civets. It has a long body, &s;hort legs, a
&s;harp muzzle, a &s;lender head, &s;mooth, &s;oft hair
of a &s;hining grayi&s;h a&s;h-colour, marked with
black &s;pots, which are round and detached on
the &s;ides, but unite &s;o clo&s;ely on the back, that
they &s;eem to form continued black bars, &s;tretch|ing
along the body. Upon the neck and &s;pine,
there is a kind of mane or long hair, forming a
black bar from the head to the tail, which la&s;t is
as long as the body, and marked with &s;even or
eight alternately black and white rings. The
black &s;pots on the neck are al&s;o in the form of
bars; and under each eye there is a very con|&s;picuous
white &s;pot. Under the tail, and in the
<PB N="255" REF="298">
&s;ame &s;ituation as in the civets, the genet has an
aperture or &s;ac, in which is &s;ecreted a kind of
perfume; but it is weak, and &s;oon lo&s;es its o|dour.
The genet is longer than the martin, to
which it has a great re&s;emblance in figure, man|ners,
and di&s;po&s;itions. But the genet &s;eems to
be more ea&s;ily tamed. Belon tells us, that he
&s;aw genets in the hou&s;es of Con&s;tantinople, which
were as tame as cats, and allowed to run about,
without doing any kind of mi&s;chief; and that
they are called <HI>Con&s;tantinople cats, Spani&s;h cats,</HI>
or <HI>genet cats.</HI> They have nothing, however, in
common with cats, but the art of watching and
catching mice. It is, perhaps, becau&s;e they are
found only in Spain and the Levant, that they
have obtained the names of the&s;e countries; for
the word <HI>genet</HI> is not derived from the antient
languages, and is probably a new name, taken
from &s;ome place frequented by the genet, which
we know is very common in Spain, where a cer|tain
race of hor&s;es are called <HI>genets.</HI> Naturali&s;ts
pretend, that the genets inhabit only moi&s;t places,
and in the neighbourhood of brooks; and that
they are never found in mountains or dry grounds.
Their &s;pecies is not numerous, or at lea&s;t much
diffu&s;ed. There are none in France<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the &s;upplement, p, 256.</NOTE> or in any
other province of Europe, excepting Spain and
Turkey. Hence, for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and mul|tiplication,
they require a warm climate; yet
none of them appear to be found in the warm

countries of Africa and India; for the fo&s;&s;ane,
which is called the <HI>Madaga&s;car genet,</HI> is a dif|ferent
&s;pecies, and &s;hall afterwards be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The &s;kin of this animal makes a light and
hand&s;ome fur. Genet muffs were very fa&s;hion|able

<P>We have given a figure of a female genet,
which differs &s;o much from the female formerly
repre&s;ented, as to merit a particular de&s;cription.
It was &s;hown at the fair of St Germain in the
year 1772. It was fierce, and endeavoured to
bite. It was kept in a narrow, roundi&s;h cage,
which rendered it difficult to be drawn. It was
fed with fle&s;h, and had the phy&s;iognomy, and
all the principal characters of the genet formerly
repre&s;ented. The head was long and &s;lender;
the muzzle was al&s;o long, and advanced beyond
the under jaw. The eye was large, with a nar|row
pupil. The ears were round; and the hair
of the head and body was &s;potted. The tail was
<PB N="258" REF="301">
long and bu&s;hy. This animal was &s;omewhat
thicker than the former. The latter, indeed,
was young, for it grew con&s;iderably larger in
three or four months: We could not learn from
what country it had been brought: His keeper
had purcha&s;ed it, &s;even or eight months before,
in London. It was in perpetual motion, never
re&s;ting, except during the time it &s;lept.</P>
<P>The genet now under con&s;ideration was twen|ty
inches long, and &s;even inches and a half high.
The upper part of the neck was more bu&s;hy than
that of the former genet, who&s;e hair was all of
an equal length. The circular bars on the tail
are le&s;s di&s;tinct, and, indeed, extend not farther
than about one third part of the tail. The
whi&s;kers are black, and much longer, being two
inches &s;even lines long, and lie upon the cheeks,
in&s;tead of being erect, as in the cats and tigers.
The no&s;e is black, and the no&s;trils very much
arched. Above the no&s;e there is a black line,
which extends to between the eyes, and is ac|companied
by two white bands. Above the
eyes there is a white &s;pot, and a white band be|low
them. The ears are black, but longer and
narrower at the ba&s;e than tho&s;e of the fir&s;t genet.
The hair of the body is of a whiti&s;h gray colour,
mixed with large black hairs, which being re|flected,
&s;eem to form a kind of black undulations.
The upper part of the back is &s;triped and &s;pot|ted
with black; the re&s;t of the body is marked
in the &s;ame manner, but the black is fainter.

re&s;embles that of the water rat, and the head of

mou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences,
ann. 1725, there is a very complete de&s;cription
of the Canadian mu&s;k rat. M. Sarra&s;in, King's
phy&s;ician at Quebec, and corre&s;pondent of the
academy, has di&s;&s;ected a number of the&s;e animals,
and made &s;ome &s;ingular remarks. By comparing
his de&s;cription with ours, we are per&s;uaded that
the mu&s;k rat of Canada is the &s;ame animal
who&s;e figure is here repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The Canadian mu&s;k rat is of the &s;ize of a
&s;mall rabbit, and of the figure of a rat. Its head
is &s;hort, and re&s;embles that of the water rat.
<PB N="263" REF="308">
Its hair is &s;oft and glo&s;&s;y; and, beneath the fir&s;t
hair, there is a thick down, nearly like that of
the beaver. Like other rats, its tail is long, and
covered with &s;cales; but its form is different;
for, in&s;tead of being cylindrical, it is compre&s;&s;ed
laterally from the middle to the extremity, and
roundi&s;h near the origin. The toes are not u|nited
by membranes, but garni&s;hed with long
clo&s;e hair, which a&s;&s;i&s;ts the animal in &s;wimming.
Its ears are very &s;hort, and not naked, as in the
common rat, but covered, both internally and
externally, with hair. The eyes are large, their
aperture being about three lines. In the under
jaw there are two cutting teeth, about an inch
long, and two &s;horter ones in the upper. The&s;e
four teeth are very &s;trong, and &s;erve the animal
for gnawing and cutting wood.</P>
<P>The &s;ingularities ob&s;erved in this animal by
M. Sarra&s;in are, 1. The great mu&s;cular force in
its &s;kin, which enables the creature to contract
its body into a &s;mall volume: 2. The &s;upplene&s;s
of the fal&s;e ribs, which admits this contraction,
and is &s;o con&s;iderable, that the mu&s;k rat is
enabled to pa&s;s through holes where much &s;mal|ler
animals cannot enter: 3. The manner in
which the females di&s;charge their urine; for
the urethra terminates not, as in other quadru|peds,
under the clitoris, but at a hairy eminence
above the os pubis; and in this eminence there
is an aperture that allows the urine to e&s;cape.
This &s;ingular organization is peculiar to a few
<PB N="264" REF="309">
&s;pecies of animals, as the rats and apes, the fe|males
of which have three apertures. It has
been remarked, that the beaver is the only qua|druped
who&s;e urine and excrement are di&s;char|ged
by a common aperture. The female rats
and apes are, perhaps, the only animals who
di&s;charge their urine by an aperture &s;eparated
from the organs of generation. But this &s;ingu|larity
is confined to the females, the &s;tructure of
the males being the &s;ame with that of other qua|drupeds.
4. M. Sarra&s;in farther remarks, that
the te&s;ticles, which, as in other rats, are &s;ituated
on each &s;ide of the anus, become, in the rutting
&s;ea&s;on, very large in proportion to the &s;ize of
the animal, their bulk being often equal to that
of a nutmeg; but that, after this &s;ea&s;on, they di|mini&s;h
&s;o greatly as not to exceed a line in di|ameter;
and that they not only undergo a change
of &s;ize, con&s;i&s;tence, and colour, but even their
&s;ituation is remarkably varied. In the &s;ame
manner, after the &s;ea&s;on of love, the &s;eminal
ve&s;&s;els, the va&s;a deferentia, and all the organs of
generation, are almo&s;t entirely obliterated: The
te&s;ticles, which, during this period, were exter|nal,
and very prominent, retire within the body.
They are &s;ixed, like the other parts ju&s;t men|tioned,
to the membrana adipo&s;a. This mem|brane,
by the redundant nouri&s;hment, gradually
expands and increa&s;es till the arrival of the rut|ting
&s;ea&s;on, when the organs of generation,
which &s;eem to be appendages of the membrane,
<PB N="265" REF="310">
unfold, &s;well, and acquire their complete di|men&s;ions.
But, when the redundant nouri&s;h|ment
is exhau&s;ted by reiterated embraces, the
membrane turns meagre, contracts, and gradu|ally
retires toward the reins, carrying along with
it the va&s;a deferentia, the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els, and
the te&s;ticles, which la&s;t become &s;o light, empty,
and &s;hrivelled, as hardly to be di&s;tingui&s;hable. In
the &s;ame manner, the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els, which,
at the commencement of the rutting &s;ea&s;on, are
an inch and a half long, are afterwards reduced
to a line or two in diameter: 5. That the folli|cles
which contain the perfume of this animal in
the form of a milky humour, and which are &s;i|tuated
near the organs of generation, undergo
the &s;ame changes. In the rutting &s;ea&s;on, they
are large and turgid, and their perfume is &s;o
&s;trong and highly exalted, that it is perceptible
at a great di&s;tance. They afterwards contract,
&s;hrivel, and at la&s;t entirely di&s;appear. This
change in the follicles, which contain the per|fume,
is more rapid and complete than that
which happens to the organs of generation.
The&s;e follicles are common to both &s;exes, and,
in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, contain a con&s;iderable quan|tity
of milky humour, &s;ecreted by ve&s;&s;els, which,
in the male, terminate at the extremity of the
penis, and towards the clitoris in the female.
This &s;ecretion is performed, and the humour eva|cuated
nearly at the &s;ame place as the urine in
other quadrupeds.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="311">
All the&s;e peculiarities remarked by M. Sarra|&s;in,
were worthy the attention of &s;o able an ana|tomi&s;t.
In the hi&s;tory of the water rat, the
mole, and &s;hort-tailed field mou&s;e, we have men|tioned
&s;imilar changes in the organs of gene|ration.
Thus we find quadrupeds, though in
their general &s;tructure they re&s;emble the other
animals of the &s;ame cla&s;s; who&s;e organs of ge|neration
are annually obliterated and renewed,
nearly in the &s;ame manner as the milts of fi&s;hes,
and the &s;eminal ve&s;&s;els of the calmar, who&s;e
changes, annihilation, and reproduction have
been formerly de&s;cribed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See above, vol. II. p. 186.</NOTE>. The&s;e &s;hades by
which Nature connects beings apparently the far|the&s;t
removed from each other, the&s;e &s;ingular
examples, &s;hould never be neglected; becau&s;e
they belong to the general &s;y&s;tem of organiza|tion,
and unite the mo&s;t di&s;tant points of ani|mated
bodies. But this is not the place for ex|patiating
on the general conclu&s;ions which might
be drawn from the&s;e &s;ingular facts, nor on the
clo&s;e connection they have with our theory of
generation. They will be anticipated by the
intelligent reader; and we &s;hall &s;oon have occa|&s;ion
to exhibit them to greater advantage, by add|ing
them to other facts of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>As the Canadian mu&s;k rat belongs to the &s;ame
country with the beaver, dwells on the water,
and has nearly the &s;ame figure, colour, and fur,
they have often been compared to each other.
<PB N="267" REF="312">
It is even a&s;&s;erted, that a full grown mu&s;k rat,
at fir&s;t &s;ight, maybe mi&s;taken for a beaver of a
month old. They differ greatly, however, in
the form of the tail, which, in the beaver, is oval
and flat horizontally; but, in the mu&s;k rat, it is
very long and flat, or compre&s;&s;ed vertically. Be|&s;ides,
the&s;e animals have a great re&s;emblance in
their di&s;po&s;itions and in&s;tincts. The mu&s;k rats,
like the beavers, live in &s;ociety during the win|ter.
They make little huts, about two feet and
a half in diameter, and &s;ometimes larger, where
&s;everal families a&s;&s;ociate together. It is not the
object of this operation, like that of the mar|mots,
to &s;leep during five or &s;ix months, but
&s;olely to &s;helter them from the rigour of the air.
The&s;e hou&s;es, or huts, are round, and covered
with a dome about a foot thick. Their materi|als
are herbs and ru&s;hes interlaced, and cement|ed
with earth, which they pla&s;h with their feet.
They are impenetrable to rain, and furni&s;hed
with &s;teps in the in&s;ide, to prevent their being
injured by inundations from the land. The&s;e
huts, which &s;erve the animals for a retreat, are
covered, during winter, with &s;everal feet of &s;now
and ice, without incommoding them. They lay
not up provi&s;ions, like the beaver, but dig a kind
of pits or pa&s;&s;ages under and round their habi|tations,
to give them an opportunity of procu|ring
water and roots. Though thus a&s;&s;ociated,
they pa&s;s the winter in melancholy; for it is not
the &s;ea&s;on of their amours. During all this pe|riod,
<PB N="268" REF="313">
they are deprived of light; and, when the
gentle breezes of the &s;pring begin to di&s;&s;olve the
&s;now, and to di&s;cover the tops of their habita|tions,
the hunters open the dome, &s;uddenly
dazzle them with the light, and kill or &s;eize all
tho&s;e who have not had time to retire to their
&s;ubterraneous galleries, into which they are &s;till
followed; for their &s;kin is valuable, and their fle&s;h
makes tolerably good eating. Tho&s;e who e&s;cape
the vigilance of the hunter quit their habitations
at this time. They wander about during
&s;ummer, but always in pairs; becau&s;e it is the
&s;ea&s;on of their amours. They feed upon herbs,
and voraciou&s;ly devour the fre&s;h productions of
the earth. By this redundance of excellent nou|ri&s;hment,
the membrana adipo&s;a expands, in|crea&s;es,
and is filled with fat; the follicles are al|&s;o
renewed and filled; the organs of generation
unfold and &s;well; and then the animals acquire
an odour of mu&s;k, &s;o &s;trong as to be hardly &s;up|portable.
This odour is perceived at a di&s;tance;
and, though agreeable to Europeans<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The mu&s;k rat of North America is &s;omewhat thicker and longer than our water rat.

becau&s;e they come in &s;ea&s;on in the beginning of
&s;ummer, and the young are pretty large in the
month of October, when they retire with their
parents into the huts, which are built every year;
for, it has been remarked, that they never return
to their old habitations. Their cry is a kind of
groaning, which the hunter counterfeits, in order
to make them approach him. Their fore-teeth
are &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o proper for cutting, that,
when &s;hut up in a box of hard wood, they &s;oon
make a hole &s;ufficient for their e&s;cape, which is
a faculty they have in common with the beaver.
They &s;wim neither &s;o &s;wift nor &s;o long as the
beaver; but often go upon the ground. They
do not run well, and they walk &s;till wor&s;e, rock|ing
from &s;ide to &s;ide, like a goo&s;e. Their &s;kin
pre&s;erves the &s;mell of mu&s;k, which renders their

<P>OF all the animals in the New World, the
Mexican Hog is the mo&s;t numerous and
mo&s;t remarkable &s;pecies. At fir&s;t &s;ight, he re|&s;embles
our wild boar, or rather the hog of Siam,
<PB N="272" REF="319">
which, as formerly remarked, is only a variety
of the wild boar. In the &s;ame manner, the Mex|ican
hog has been called the <HI>boar,</HI> or <HI>hog of Ame|rica.</HI>
He con&s;titutes, however, a different &s;pe|cies;
for, from repeated trials, it has been found,
that he does not intermix either with our wild
or dome&s;tic kinds. He likewi&s;e differs from the
hog in &s;everal e&s;&s;ential characters, both external
and internal. He is not &s;o corpulent, and his
legs are &s;horter. The form of his &s;tomach and
inte&s;tines is al&s;o different. He has no tail. His
bri&s;tles are much coar&s;er than tho&s;e of the wild
boar. La&s;tly, on his back, near the crupper,
there is an orifice about three lines broad, and
more than an inch deep, from which an ichorous
humour, of a very di&s;agreeable &s;mell, flows very
copiou&s;ly. No other animal has an aperture in
this region of the body. The civets, the badger,
<PB N="273" REF="320">
and the genet have the re&s;ervoir of their per|fume
under the organs of generation; and the
Canadian mu&s;k rat, and the mu&s;k animal, have
it under the belly. The liquor which i&s;&s;ues
from the dor&s;al aperture of the Mexican hog is
&s;ecreted by a number of large glands, which are
well de&s;cribed by M. Daubenton, and by Dr
Ty&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Phil. Tran&s;. No 153.</NOTE>. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to give in detail the
ob&s;ervations of the&s;e acute anatomi&s;ts. It &s;hall
only be remarked, that Dr Ty&s;on is wrong in
a&s;&s;erting that this animal has three &s;tomachs, or,
as Mr Ray<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Raii Synop&s;. quad. p. 99.</NOTE>, expre&s;&s;es it, a gizzard and two &s;to|machs.
M. Daubenton has clearly demon&s;tra|ted,
that it has but one &s;tomach, divided by two
&s;trangulations, which give it he appearance of
three; that only one of the&s;e three bags has a
pylorus, or aperture for allowing the de&s;cent of
the aliment into the other inte&s;tines; and, con|&s;equently,
that the other two &s;hould be regarded
as appendages, or rather portions, of the &s;ame
&s;tomach.</P>
<P>The Mexican hog might be rendered dome|&s;tic,
as well as the common kind. He is nearly
of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions, feeds upon the &s;ame
nouri&s;hment, and his fle&s;h, though drier, and le&s;s
loaded with fat, is by no means di&s;agreeable. It
is likewi&s;e improved by ca&s;tration; but, when
his fle&s;h is intended to be eaten, not only the or|gans
of generation, as is practi&s;ed on the wild
<PB N="274" REF="321">
boar, but the whole dor&s;al glands of both male
and female &s;hould be cut off in&s;tantly after death;
for the retention of them for a &s;ingle half hour
gives the meat an odour &s;o &s;trong as to render
it uneatable.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are very numerous in all the
warm climates of South America. They go in
herds, which &s;ometimes amount to two or three
hundred. For defending them&s;elves, and repel|ling
tho&s;e who want to deprive them of their
young, they are endowed with the &s;ame in&s;tincts
as the common hog. They mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each
other; they &s;urround their enemies, and often
wound the dogs and the hunters. In their na|tive
country, they prefer the mountains to the
plains. They &s;earch not for mar&s;hes and mires,
like our wild boar, but remain in the fore&s;ts,
where they live upon fruits, &s;eeds, and roots.
They likewi&s;e eat &s;erpents, toads, and lizards,
who&s;e &s;kins they previou&s;ly tear off with their
feet. They produce a great number at a time,
and, perhaps, more than once a-year. The young
&s;oon follow their mother, and never &s;eparate from
her till they are full grown. When taken young,
they are ea&s;ily tamed; they lo&s;e their natural fe|rocity,
but retain their &s;tupidity; for they know
no per&s;on, and have no attachment to tho&s;e who
take care of them. They do no mi&s;chief, and
may be allowed to go and come at plea&s;ure, with|out
any inconvenience. They never &s;tray, but
return home &s;pontaneou&s;ly; and they never
<PB N="275" REF="322">
quarrel, but when a number of them are pre&s;ent|ed
with victuals in the &s;ame trough. When
angry, their grunting is &s;tronger and harder than
that of the common hog; but they &s;eldom cry.
Like the wild boar, when &s;uddenly alarmed, they
make a &s;harp blowing kind of noi&s;e. Their
breath is very &s;trong; and, when irritated, their
hair ri&s;es, which is &s;o coar&s;e, that it rather re|&s;embles
the prickles of a hedgehog than the bri|&s;tles
of the wild boar.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the Mexican hog is pre&s;erved
without any change; for they never intermix
with tho&s;e hogs which were tran&s;ported from
Europe, and have become wild in America.
The&s;e animals often meet in the woods, and e|ven
go in company, without producing any new
variety. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to the
Guiney hog, which has multiplied greatly in A|merica,
after being brought thither from Africa.
The European hog, the Guiney hog, and the
Mexican hog, are three &s;pecies, which, though
they &s;eem to approach very near each other, are
perfectly di&s;tinct, &s;ince they all &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the
&s;ame climate, without change or intermixture.
Our wild boar is the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t formi|dable
of the three. The Mexican hog is equally
ferocious; but he is weaker, more unwiedly,
and wor&s;e armed, his tu&s;ks being much &s;horter
than tho&s;e of the wild boar. The former is im|patient
of cold, and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, even in our
temperate climates, without being &s;heltered;
<PB N="276" REF="323">
and the wild boar cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in very cold
countries. Hence neither of the&s;e animals could
pa&s;s from the one Continent to the other by the
lands lying toward the north pole; and, there|fore,
the Mexican hog cannot be regarded as the
European hog altered or degenerated, by the in|fluence
of the American climates, but as an ani|mal
peculiar to the &s;outhern regions of the New
World.</P>
<P>Ray, and other authors, maintain, that the li|quor
&s;ecreted by the dor&s;al glands of the Mexi|can
hog, is a kind of mu&s;k, an agreeable per|fume,
even when it i&s;&s;ues from the body of the
animal; that it is perceived at a great di&s;tance; and
that it perfumes the places where he inhabits, or
through which he pa&s;&s;es. But, on the contrary,
I have a thou&s;and times experienced, that the
odour of this liquor, when it e&s;capes from the ani|mal,
is &s;o nau&s;cous, that we could neither &s;mell
nor collect it without extreme di&s;gu&s;t. It &s;eems
only to become le&s;s fetid by drying in the air;
but it never a&s;&s;umes the agreeable odour of mu&s;k
or of civet; and naturali&s;ts would have made a
nearer approach to truth, if they had compared
it to that of <HI>ca&s;tor$um.</HI></P>

<P>M. de la Borde remarks, that, in Cayenne,
there are two di&s;tinct &s;pecies of pecari or Mexi|can

hog, which never intermix. The large&s;t
kind, &s;ays he, has white hair on its chops; and,
on each &s;ide of the jaw, there is a round white
&s;pot, of the &s;ize of a &s;mall crown-piece. The
re&s;t of the body is black; and the animal weighs
about one hundred pounds. The &s;maller &s;pecies
has reddi&s;h hair, and weighs not above &s;ixty
pounds.</P>
<P>It is the large &s;pecies which is here repre&s;ented.
And, with regard to the &s;maller kind, the differ|ence
of colour and &s;ize, mentioned by M. de la
Borde, mu&s;t be only a variety produced by age,
or &s;ome other accidental circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde, however, &s;ays, that the large
kind runs not, like the &s;mall, after dogs and
men. He adds, that both &s;pecies inhabit the
large woods, and that they go in flocks of two
or three hundred. They feed on the mountains
during the rainy &s;ea&s;on; and, when it is pa&s;t,
they frequent the low and mar&s;hy grounds.
They feed upon fruits, &s;eeds, and roots, and like|wi&s;e
dig in the mires, in que&s;t of worms and o|ther
in&s;ects. They are hunted without dogs,
by following the track of their feet. They are
ea&s;ily &s;hot; for, in&s;tead of flying, they a&s;&s;emble
together, and often give the hunters an oppor|tunity
of charging and di&s;charging &s;everal times.
They pur&s;ue the dogs, and &s;ometimes men. He
relates, that, being one day employed, along with
&s;everal others, in hunting the&s;e animals, accom|panied
by a &s;ingle dog, which, as &s;oon as they
<PB N="278" REF="327">
appeared, took refuge between his ma&s;ter's legs.
For the greater &s;afety, he, with the other hunters,
&s;tood on a rock. They were, neverthele&s;s, &s;ur|rounded
by the flock of hogs. A con&s;tant fire
was kept up; but the creatures did not retire till
a great number of them was &s;lain. The&s;e ani|mals,
however, he remarks, fly after they have
been &s;everal times hunted. The young, when
taken in the chace, are ea&s;ily tamed; but they
will not a&s;&s;ociate or mix with the dome&s;tic &s;pe|cies.
In their natural &s;tate of liberty, they fre|quent
the mar&s;hes, and often &s;wim acro&s;s large
rivers. They make great havock in the planta|tions.
Their fle&s;h, &s;ays he, has an excellent
ta&s;te, but is not &s;o tender as that of the dome&s;tic
hog; it re&s;embles the fle&s;h of the hare, and has
neither lard nor grea&s;e. The females bring forth
only two at a litter; but they produce in all
&s;ea&s;ons. When killed, the dor&s;al gland &s;hould
be in&s;tantly cut out, otherwi&s;e it will give a bad
flavour to the meat.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde mentions another &s;pecies of
hog, which he calls <HI>patira,</HI> and is al&s;o found in
Guiana. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe what he remarks of
this animal, &s;olely with the view that he, or
&s;ome other ob&s;erver, may furni&s;h us with more
preci&s;e information, and a more complete de&s;crip|tion
of it.</P>
<P>&startq;The patira is of the &s;ize of the &s;maller &s;pe|cies
of Mexican hog; and differs from it only
<PB N="279" REF="328">
by having a white line along the &s;pine from
the neck to the tail.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e animals live in the large fore&s;ts, from
which they never depart. They a&s;&s;ociate not
in large flocks, but in families. They are,
however, very common, and never leave their
native country. They are hunted with or
without dogs. When pur&s;ued by dogs, they
&s;tand firm, and defend them&s;elves with cou|rage.
They take refuge is hollow trees, or in
holes of the earth dug by the armadillos. The&s;e
holes they enter backwards; and remain as long
as they can: But, when highly irritated, they
in&s;tantly i&s;&s;ue out in a body. In order to &s;eize
them as they come out, the hole is inclo&s;ed
with branches of trees; one of the hunters,
armed with a pitchfork, &s;tands above the hole
to fix them by the neck, while another forces
them out, and kills them with a &s;abre.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When there is but one in a hole, and the
hunter has not lei&s;ure to &s;eize it, he &s;huts up
the entrance, and is &s;ure of his game next day.
The fle&s;h of the patira is &s;uperiour to that of o|ther
hogs. When taken young, they are ea|&s;ily
tamed; but they have a mortal anitpathy
to dogs, whom they perpetually attack. The
females bring forth only two at a time; and
they are fit for procreating in every &s;ea&s;on of
the year. They keep always in the mar&s;hes,
unle&s;s when totally covered with water.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="329">
&startq;The hair of the patira is not &s;o hard as that
of the wild boar, or dome&s;tic hog, but is &s;oft
and flexible like that of the pecari. The pa|tira,
when tamed, follows his ma&s;ter, and al|lows
him&s;elf to be handled by tho&s;e with whom
he is acquainted; but &s;trangers he threatens
with his head and teeth.&endq;</P>

feet; and it has on the neck a half-collar of a
lively red, mixed with orange, of which there is
no ve&s;tige in the larger kind. Both belong near|ly
to the &s;ame warm climates of the Old World,
being found in Madaga&s;car<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the i&s;land of Madaga&s;car, &amp;c. the bats are as large as hens, and &s;o numerous that they frequently darken the air. Their cry is frightful; <HI>Voyage de Madaga&s;car, par de V. p.</HI> 83. 245.</NOTE>, Mauritius, Ter|nat,

<P>In the warm countries of the New World,
there is another flying quadruped, the American
name of which we have not learned. We &s;hall
call it <HI>Vampire,</HI> becau&s;e it &s;ucks the blood of men
and other animals when a&s;leep, without occa|&s;ioning
pain &s;ufficient to waken them. This A|merican
animal is of a different &s;pecies from the
two Ternat bats, both of which are peculiar to
Africa and the South of A&s;ia. The vampire is
&s;maller than either of the Ternat bats. The
fir&s;t, when it flies, appears to be of the &s;ize of a
pigeon; the le&s;&s;er Ternat bat is of the &s;ize
<PB N="284" REF="333">
of a crow, and the larger is as big as a large hen.
Both Ternat bats have well formed heads, &s;hort
ears, and rounded muzzles, nearly re&s;embling
that of a dog. The muzzle of the vampire, on
the contrary, is longer; its a&s;pect is equally hi|deous
as that of the mo&s;t ugly bats; its head is
ill &s;haped; and its ears are large, open, and very
erect. It has a deformed no&s;e, the no&s;trils be|ing
of the &s;hape of a funnel, with a membrane
above them, which is elevated like a horn or
painted cre&s;t, and adds greatly to the deformity
of its countenance. Hence it is apparent, that
this &s;pecies is totally different from the Ter|nat
bats. The vampire is not more remark|able
for its deformity than its mi&s;chief. Of this
we have the recent and authentic te&s;timony of
M. de la Condamine: &startq;The bats,&endq; &s;ays he,
&startq;which &s;uck the blood of hor&s;es, mules, and
even of men, if they do not &s;leep under the
&s;helter of a hou&s;e or tent, are a common &s;courge
to mo&s;t of the warm countries of America.
Some of them are of a mon&s;trous &s;ize. At
Borja, and &s;everal other places, they have en|tirely
de&s;troyed the cattle which had been in|trodced
there by the mi&s;&s;ionaries, and begun
to multiply<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de la riviere des Amazones, par M. de la Conda|mine, p. 171.</NOTE>.&endq; The&s;e facts are confirmed by

likewi&s;e affirmed by Jumilla<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In South America, the bats are incredibly trouble&s;ome. There are two kinds, one of the &s;ize of tho&s;e we &s;ee in Spain; the other &s;o large, that the wings extend three quarters of a yard.

If tho&s;e who are obliged to &s;leep on the ground do not cover them&s;elves from head to foot, which is very inconvenient in the&s;e warm regions, they are certain of being pierced by the bats. With regard to tho&s;e who &s;leep in hou&s;es, with their front only uncovered, they are infallibly bit; and, if the&s;e animals &s;trike a vein, the unfortunate per&s;on often pa&s;&s;es in&s;en&s;ibly from &s;leep to death by the lo&s;s of blood, &s;o &s;ubtile is the wound inflicted: Be&s;ides, by fanning the air with their wings, they refre&s;h the &s;leeper whom they mean to deprive of life; <HI>Hi&s;t.

Though it appears, from the&s;e authorities, that
the blood-&s;ucking bats are very common in all
South America, we have never hitherto been
able to procure a &s;ingle individual. But Seba
has given a figure and de&s;cription of this ani|mal,
who&s;e no&s;e is &s;o extraordinary, that it is
&s;urpri&s;ing &s;uch a con&s;picuous deformity &s;hould
not have been taken notice of by travellers. The
<PB N="286" REF="335">
&s;trange animal de&s;cribed by Seba, may not be
the vampire or blood-&s;ucker. Seba's figure may
be erroneous; and the deformed no&s;e may be
only an accidental mon&s;tro&s;ity, though there are
examples of &s;imilar and permanent deformities
in other &s;pecies of bats. Time alone can remove
the&s;e uncertainties.</P>
<P>Both the Ternat bats are in the Royal cabi|net,
and were brought from the i&s;le of Bour|bon.
They are peculiar to the Old Continent,
and are no where &s;o numerous in Africa and
A&s;ia, as the vampire is in America. The&s;e ani|mals
are larger, &s;tronger, and perhaps more
mi&s;chievous than the vampire. But their de&s;truc|tion
is executed by open force, both during the
day and night. They kill poultry and &s;mall
birds: They attack men, and often wound
them in the face. But no travellers mentions
their &s;ucking the blood of men or cattle, when
a&s;leep.</P>
<P>The antients had an imperfect knowledge of
the&s;e winged quadrupeds, which are a kind of
mon&s;ters; and it is probable, that, from &s;uch bi|zarre
models of nature, they had conceived the
idea of harpies. The wings, the teeth, the
claws, the cruelty, the voracity, the filthine&s;s,
and every other deformity and de&s;tructive qua|lity
a&s;cribed to the harpies, corre&s;pond very
well with our Ternat bats. Herodotus<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Herodot. lib. 3.

La&s;tly, de&s;criptions and good figures of the&s;e
animals, which corre&s;pond with our &s;pecimens,
are to be found in Seba and Edwards.</P>
<P>The Ternat bats are carnivorous animals,
and &s;o voracious, that they eat every thing;
for, when fle&s;h or fi&s;h fail them, they feed up|on
vegetables, and fruits of all kinds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the Manilla i&s;lands, we find an infinity of large bats hanging attached to each other upon the trees. They take flight in the evening, and go in que&s;t of food to the di&s;tant woods. They &s;ometimes fly in &s;uch numbers, and &s;o clo&s;e, that they darken the air with their wings, which are often &s;ix palms in extent. They know how to di&s;tingui&s;h, in the thicke&s;t woods, the trees which bear ripe fruit. The&s;e they devour, during the night, making a noi&s;e that may be heard at the di&s;tance of two miles, and return, at day-break, to their retreats. The Indians, who &s;ee the&s;e animals eating their be&s;t fruits, make war again&s;t them, not only to gratify re|venge, but to feed upon their fle&s;h, which they &s;ay ta&s;tes like that of a rabbit; <HI>Hi&s;t. gen. des voyages, par M. l'Abb&eacute; Prevo&s;t, tom. 10. p.</HI> 389.</NOTE>. They
drink the juice of the palm-tree; and it is ea|&s;y
to intoxicate and &s;ieze them, by placing near
their retreats ve&s;&s;els filled with palm-water, or
&s;ome other fermented liquor. They attach and
&s;u&s;pend them&s;elves to the trees by their claws.
They generally fly in flocks, and more frequent|ly
in the night than the day. They avoid places
frequented by men, and dwell in the de&s;erts,
particularly in uninhabited i&s;lands. They co|pulate
<PB N="289" REF="338">
with ardour. The &s;ex in the male
is very con&s;picuous. The penis is not conceal|ed
in a &s;heath, like that of quadrupeds, but
hangs out of the body, like that of the mon|key<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In hoc animali uterque &s;exus digno&s;cebatur: Nam eorum aliquot, qui mihi con&s;pecti &s;unt, &s;atis longum exertumque penem habebant, quales &s;ere &s;imiarum e&s;t; <HI>Carol.

The &s;ex of the females is al&s;o very ap|parent.
They have only two paps placed on
the brea&s;t, and they produce few at a litter,
but oftener than once a year. The fle&s;h of the&s;e
animals, when young, is not bad to eat; the
Indians compare the ta&s;te of it to that of a par|tridge
or rabbit.</P>
<P>All travellers through America agree, that the
large bats of the New Continent have the facul|ty
of &s;ucking the blood of &s;leeping men and
cattle, without wakening them. The travellers
into A&s;ia or Africa, who mention the Ternat
bats, take no notice of this &s;ingular fact. Their
&s;ilence, however, amounts not to a complete
proof, e&s;pecially as the&s;e creatures have &s;o many
other re&s;emblances to the American vampires.
We, therefore, thought it worthy of examina|tion,
whether the Ternat bats, (for we have
not been able to procure the tongue of a vam|pire),
could po&s;&s;ibly &s;uck blood, without occa|&s;ioning
a pain &s;ufficient to waken a &s;leeping
per&s;on. If they cut the fle&s;h with their teeth,
which are as large as tho&s;e of other quadrupeds
of the &s;ame &s;ize, a man in the mo&s;t profound
<PB N="290" REF="339">
&s;leep, and particularly cattle, who&s;e &s;leep is much
lighter, would be in&s;tantly rou&s;ed by the pain.
The &s;ame thing would happen, if the wound
was made by their claws. Hence it mu&s;t be
with their tongue alone that they are enabled to
make &s;uch &s;mall apertures in the &s;kin as to per|mit
the blood to be extracted from the veins,
without occa&s;ioning a great degree of pain. Up|on
examination, M. Daubenton di&s;covered that
the tongue of the Ternat bats was pointed,
and armed with very hard, minute, &s;harp pa|pillae,
which are bended backwards: The&s;e
may be in&s;inuated into the pores of the &s;kin, and
penetrate &s;o far as to make a &s;tream of blood
flow by the con&s;tant &s;uction of the tongue.
But it is fruitle&s;s to rea&s;on upon a fact, all the
circum&s;tances of which are not under&s;tood, and
&s;ome of them, perhaps, exaggerated or un&s;kil|fully
related.</P>

<P>I find, from a note communicated by M.
Commer&s;on, that he had &s;een, in the i&s;le of
Bourbon, millions of tho&s;e large or Ternat bats,
which, in the evenings, fly in flocks like crows,
and perch upon trees, particularly the <HI>vaccoun,</HI>
to eat the fruit. He adds, that, when taken
<PB N="291" REF="340">
young, they make good food, the ta&s;te of the
fle&s;h re&s;embling that of the hare, and being
equally black.</P>
<P>The late M. de la Nux, &s;ince the publication
of my work, &s;ent me, from the &s;ame i&s;land, &s;ome
excellent remarks upon what I had written con|cerning
the&s;e animals. His letter, of which the
following are extracts, is dated October 24.
1772.</P>
<P>&startq;In your letter of the 8th March 1770, you
declare that you are equally happy to be in|formed
of truth, or to have your own errors
corrected, and invite me to communicate my
thoughts are remarks with the utmo&s;t free|dom.
I accept of the invitation, and am only
afraid le&s;t I &s;hould tire you by prolixity. With
regard to the great or Ternat bats, to combat
errors which have been long received, requires
a variety of evidence. The&s;e animals, it would
appear, have only been examined with the
eye of fear: They have been regarded as ugly
and mon&s;trous; and therefore, without far|ther
examination than a bare in&s;pection of
their figure, they have received a character,
manners, and habits, which do not belong to
them; as if mi&s;chievou&s;ne&s;s, ferocity, and dir|tine&s;s
were in&s;eparable from ugline&s;s of a|&s;pect.&endq;</P>
<P>M. de la Nux remarks, that, in my de&s;crip|tion,
p. 283. both the &s;ize and number of the
great Ternat bats are exaggerated; that there
<PB N="292" REF="341">
is nothing frightful in their cry; that it re|&s;embles
the hoar&s;e noi&s;e made by a man when
he opens his mouth, contracts the wind-pipe,
and makes &s;everal forcible expirations and re&s;pi|rations;
and that, when the&s;e animals are at
re&s;t on a tree, they make a gentle kind of mur|muring,
which is not di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>&startq;P. 61. Pliny with rea&s;on,&endq; continues our
author, &startq;treats the narrative of Herodotus as
fabulous. The Ternat bats, at lea&s;t in the
i&s;lands, in&s;tead of attacking men, uniformly
avoid them. They bite cruelly, but only when
defending them&s;elves from blows, or when
they are &s;eized; &s;o that, whoever is wound|ed
by them mu&s;t a&s;cribe their misfortune
to their own want of addre&s;s, and not to
the ferocity of an animal that has no &s;uch
quality.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;P. 286. 287. Notes. Here the &s;ize of the
great Ternat bat approaches nearer to the
truth. &hellip; <HI>In Malabar, the bats fly at
noon-day.</HI> This is true of the larger, but not
of the le&s;&s;er Ternat bats. The former fly
not in troops during the day, but &s;ingly, when
they mount very high, which greatly dimini&s;h|es
their apparent magnitude. They fly long
without &s;topping, and I believe that they can
pa&s;s from the i&s;le of Bourbon to the i&s;le of
France, a di&s;tance of at lea&s;t thirty leagues, in
a very &s;hort time. They never hover, like
birds of prey. But, in the great elevation of
<PB N="293" REF="342">
perhaps two hundred fathoms above the &s;ur|face
of the earth, the motion of their wings,
which is rapid when near the ground, appears
to be very &s;low.&endq;.</P>
<P>&startq;Strictly &s;peaking, the great Ternat bats live
not in &s;ociety. When in que&s;t of food, they
unite into flocks or companies more or le&s;s nu|merous.
The&s;e companies a&s;&s;ociate by acci|dent
upon the trees who&s;e flowers or fruits are
agreeable to their palates. They may be ob|&s;erved
arriving &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and laying hold of
the trees by the claws of their hind feet, where
they re&s;t for a long time, if not di&s;turbed.
There are always &s;ome, however, which de|tach
them&s;elves from time to time, and join
the company. But, when a bird of prey pa&s;|&s;es
above the tree, when they hear the noi&s;e of
thunder, or of a mu&s;ket, or when they &s;py
any per&s;on in their neighbourhood, they all
take wing at once. It is on &s;uch occa&s;ions
that they are &s;een, during the day, flying in
companies, which, though numerous, never
ob&s;cure the air, becau&s;e they cannot fly clo&s;e
enough to produce this effect: The expre&s;&s;ion
is at lea&s;t hyperbolical. But to &s;ay, that <HI>an
infinity of large bats may be &s;een attached to
each other upon the trees,</HI> is not only fal&s;e, but
ab&s;urd. They are too peevi&s;h to hold each o|ther,
in this manner, by the hand; and, if we
examine their figure, the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch
a concatenation will be apparent. They re&s;t
<PB N="294" REF="343">
on the branches above, below, or at each o|ther's
&s;ide; but always remain &s;eparate.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With regard to the le&s;&s;er Ternat bats, they
never fly in the day: They live in &s;ociety, to
the number &s;ometimes of more than four hun|dred,
in the hollow trunks of large corrupted
trees, from which they depart not till the du&s;k
of the evening, and return before day-break. It
is firmly believed in this i&s;land, that, whatever
numbers the&s;e &s;ocieties con&s;i&s;t of, there is never
more than one male found among them: But I
cannot atte&s;t this fact. I &s;hall only remark, that
the&s;e &s;edentary animals acquire a great degree
of fatne&s;s, and that, when this colony was fir&s;t
e&s;tabli&s;hed, many people, who&s;e ta&s;te and &s;to|mach
were not too nice, collected va&s;t quan|tities
of bat grea&s;e for food. I have &s;een the
time when a <HI>tree of bats,</HI> as it is termed, was no
incon&s;iderable trea&s;ure. It is ea&s;y to &s;hut up
the entrance of their retreats, to take them out
alive one by one, or to &s;uffocate them with
&s;moke, and in either way to a&s;certain the num|ber
of males and females of which the &s;ociety
is compo&s;ed. I know nothing more of this
&s;pecies. I return to the notes. &hellip; Another
hyperbole: P. 288. <HI>They know how to di&s;tingui&s;h,
in the thicke&s;t woods, the trees which bear ripe
fruit. The&s;e they devour during the night,
making a noi&s;e that may be heard at the di&s;tance
of two miles.</HI> &hellip; In reading this pa&s;&s;age, we
are led to a&s;cribe the noi&s;e to the act of ma&s;ti|cation.
<PB N="295" REF="344">
The noi&s;e that is heard at a great di|&s;tance,
both in the night and the day, is that
which is natural to the animals when in a pa&s;|&s;ion,
and when di&s;puting about their food; for
it mu&s;t not be imagined that the large Ternat
bats eat only during the night. They have a
fine eye, as well as an acute &s;cent. They &s;ee
very well in the day; and it is not &s;urpri&s;ing,
that they &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h, in the woods, ripe
fruits and grain as well as flowers. Be&s;ides,
the bananas of every kind, of which they are
very fond, the peaches and other fruits cultiva|ted
by the Indians, are not in the thicke&s;t parts
of the woods. &hellip; <HI>The fle&s;h of the&s;e animals,</HI>
p. 289. <HI>is not bad</HI> &hellip; True, if the reluctance
excited by their figure could be overcome. When
about five months old, they are fat, and as good
of their kind as the Guiney hen, or young wild
boar; but, when old, they are hard, though
pretty fat during the fruit-&s;ea&s;on, which con|tinues
all the &s;ummer and a part of autumn.
The males, e&s;pecially when aged, acquire a
&s;trong, di&s;agreeable flavour. &hellip; Neither is it
correct to &s;ay, in general, that the&s;e animals
<HI>are eaten by the Indians.</HI> It is well known,
that the Indian neither eats nor kills any ani|mal.
Perhaps they are eaten by the Moors and
Malayans. It is certain, that many Europe|ans
eat them. Hence it is true, that bats are
eaten in India, though not by the Indians. In
this i&s;land, both &s;pecies are eaten.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="345">
After this examination, I proceed to the hi|&s;tory
of the&s;e animals, which likewi&s;e requires
to be rectified. My proofs &s;hall be drawn &s;ole|ly
from my own ob&s;ervation, and from what
has been alledged by tho&s;e writers whom our
Hi&s;torian of Nature has followed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Both the great and le&s;&s;er Ternat bats are
natives of the I&s;les of France, of Bourbon,
and of Madaga&s;car. I have re&s;ided in the i&s;le
of Bourbon upwards of fifty years. When I
arrived in the month of September 1722, the&s;e
animals were very common in di&s;tricts already
&s;ettled, where they are now become rare. The
rea&s;ons are obvious: 1. The fore&s;ts were then
at no great di&s;tance from the &s;ettlements; and
they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t but in fore&s;ts. 2. The Great
Ternat bats are viviparous, and bring forth one
young only each year. 3. For the &s;ake of their
fle&s;h and their grea&s;e, they are hunted, during
the whole &s;ummer, autumn, and part of winter,
by the Whites with mu&s;kets, and by the Ne|groes
with nets. Be&s;ides the&s;e cau&s;es of dimi|nution
in the &s;pecies, they abandon the neigh|bourhood
of our &s;ettlements, and retire into the
interior parts of the i&s;land, where they are ex|po&s;ed
to con&s;tant de&s;truction by the che&s;nut-coloured
Negroes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;ea&s;on of their amours here is in the
month of May, which is about the middle of
our autumn, and the females bring forth a
month after the vernal equinox. Hence the
<PB N="297" REF="346">
time of their ge&s;tation is from four and a half
to five months. Of the preci&s;e time the young
take in acquiring their full growth, I have no
knowledge: But I know that they appear to
be perfect at the winter &s;ol&s;tice, which is nearly
eight months from their birth. Be&s;ides, no
&s;mall bats are &s;een, excepting in April and May,
when the old are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the
young, by the more vivid colour of the latter.
The old ones become gray, though I know not
at what period; and it is then that their fle&s;h
is hard, and has &s;o &s;trong and di&s;agreeable a fla|vour,
that the fat alone, with which they are
well provided from the end of &s;pring to the be|ginning
of winter, is eaten by the Negroes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is certain, that the&s;e animals feed upon no
kinds of fle&s;h, but &s;olely on bananas, peaches,
and other fruits, which our fore&s;ts produce a|bundantly
in different &s;ea&s;ons. They are like|wi&s;e
very fond of the juices of certain umbel|lated
flowers, particularly tho&s;e of our &s;tinking
tree, the nectarium of which is very &s;hort.
The&s;e flowers abound in January and February,
which is the heart of our &s;ummer, and allure
into the lower parts of the i&s;land va&s;t numbers
of bats; and, it is probable, for the purpo&s;e of
&s;ucking the nectaria of umbellated flowers of
different &s;pecies, that their tongue is furni&s;hed
with &s;o many &s;harp papillae. The &s;kin of the
mango fruit is re&s;inous, and is never touched
by the bats. When confined in a cage, they
<PB N="298" REF="347">
have been made to eat bread, &s;ugar-canes, &amp;c.
I know not, however, whether they were made
to eat fle&s;h either raw or roa&s;ted. But, &s;uppo|&s;ing
they had, it is not in a &s;tate of &s;lavery that
I am con&s;idering them; for bondage changes
the manners, charactes, and habits of all ani|mals.
Man has nothing to apprehend from
the&s;e bats, either per&s;onally, or for his poultry.
It is impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;eize even the &s;mal|le&s;t
bird. They cannot, like a falcon, &s;toop
down upon their prey. If they approach too
near the ground, they fall down, and are inca|pable
of re&s;uming their flight till they climb
upon any elevated object they fir&s;t meet with,
&s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould be the body of a man<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I &s;aw a young Ternat bat fly into my hou&s;e in the du&s;k of the evening, and fall down at the feet of a Negre&s;s about eight years of age. It in&s;tantly began to climb up the child's body, who was luckily very near me. I quickly relieved her, le&s;t the claws of its wings &s;hould have &s;cratched her &s;houlders or face.</NOTE>.
When on the ground, they trail their bodies
&s;lowly along, and make their &s;tay in that &s;itu|ation
as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible. As they are by no
means adapted for running, how is it practi|cable
for them to &s;eize birds on the branches
of trees? The &s;low and aukward manner in
which they move toward the end of a branch,
in order to catch the wind in their wings, &s;hows
that every attempt of this nature would be a|bortive.
When about to fly, the&s;e animals
<PB N="299" REF="348">
cannot, like birds, dart at once into the air.
To di&s;engage their claws from the place to
which they are attached, they are obliged to
beat the air &s;everal times with their wings; and,
however full their wings may be when they
quit their &s;tation, their weight is apt to make
them &s;ink. In order to rai&s;e them&s;elves, they
traver&s;e the concavity of a curve line. But the
place from which they depart is not always
commodious for the free play of their wings.
They may be re&s;trained by the vicinity of
branches; and, when thus &s;ituated, they pro|ceed
to a part of the branch from which they
can take wing without any ri&s;k. It frequently
happens, that, when a numerous flock re&s;t upon
trees of twenty or thirty feet high, and are &s;ur|pri&s;ed
by a peal of thunder, or the firing of a
gun, &s;everal of them fall to the ground before
they receive a &s;ufficient quantity of air to &s;up|port
them. In this ca&s;e, they in&s;tantly climb
the fir&s;t tree they meet with, in order to re&s;ume
their flight as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Let us &s;uppo&s;e
that a traveller, hunting animals of which he
has no knowledge, who&s;e figure and a&s;pect
&s;trike him with terror, is &s;uddenly &s;urrounded
with a number of large bats; that he is en|tangled
by one or two of them climbing up his
body; that, by roughly endeavouring to di&s;en|gage
him&s;elf, he irritates the animals, and is
&s;cratched, or even bit by them; would not a
&s;cene of this kind give ri&s;e to the notion, that
<PB N="300" REF="349">
the&s;e bats were ferocious, ru&s;hing upon men,
in order to wound or devour them, while the
whole affair is only a fortuitous rencounter of
animals of different &s;pecies, who are equally a|fraid
of each other? I &s;ay more: The fore&s;t is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of the&s;e
bats, to which they are led by the in&s;tinct of
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and not by any &s;avage or fe|rocious
di&s;po&s;ition. When to all the&s;e facts, I
add, that neither the great nor le&s;&s;er Ternat
bats ever fix upon carrion, and that naturally
they do not eat upon the ground, but require
to be in a hanging po&s;ture when they feed, I
think I have &s;aid enough to eradicate the pre|judice
which repre&s;ents them as carnivorous,
voracious, de&s;tructive, and cruel animals. When
I farther add, that their flight is as heavy and
noi&s;y, e&s;pecially when near the ground, as that
of the vampire ought to be light and &s;ilent, I
&s;hall have, by this la&s;t character, removed the
one &s;pecies to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the
other.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e the great Ternat bats are &s;ometimes
ob&s;erved flying near the &s;urface of the water,
like the &s;wallow, they have been repre&s;ented as
feeding upon fi&s;h. But this fle&s;h is equally
di&s;agreeable to them as all other kinds; for, I
repeat it, that they live entirely on vegetables.
It is &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of bathing that they
frequent the waters; and, if they fly nearer the
&s;urface of the water than the earth, it is owing
<PB N="301" REF="350">
to the fewer interruptions pre&s;ented by the for|mer
to the motion of their wings. To this
circum&s;tance the natural cleanline&s;s of the&s;e a|nimals
mu&s;t be a&s;cribed. I have &s;een, and I
have killed numbers, and never di&s;covered the
&s;malle&s;t degree of dirtine&s;s upon any of them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The great bat is by no means a beautiful
animal. When &s;een nigh, its movements are
all di&s;agreeable. There is only one point of
view, a &s;ingle attitude, in which all its natural
deformity di&s;appears, and in which it may be
ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure. When perched on a
tree, it hangs with its head down, and its
wings folded, and placed exactly on each &s;ide
of the body. In this &s;ituation, the vibrating
wings, which con&s;titute its deformity, as well
as the hind paws, by the claws of which it is
&s;u&s;pended, are concealed. We &s;ee only a
roundi&s;h, plump, pendulous body, covered
with deep brown hair extremely clean and
&s;mooth, terminated by a head who&s;e phy&s;iog|nomy
is vivacious, and by no means di&s;agree|able.
This is their only attitude of repo&s;e, in
which they remain a long time during the
day. They are &s;een to be&s;t advantage at an
elvation above the earth from forty to &s;ixty
feet, and at the di&s;tance of about one hundred
and fifty feet. Now, figure to your&s;elf a
large tree, who&s;e branches are garni&s;hed with
one hundred and fifty or two hundred of &s;uch
objects, having no other motion but what is
<PB N="302" REF="351">
communicated to them by the branches, and
you will have an idea of a picture, which I
have regarded as curious, and contemplated
with plea&s;ure. In the riche&s;t cabinets of na|tural
hi&s;tory, the great Ternat bat is always
&s;hown with its wings fully extended, which
is its mo&s;t ugly attitude. This position may
an&s;wer one purpo&s;e. But &s;ome of them ought
to be viewed at a &s;ide, or from above, in their
natural &s;tate of repo&s;e. The one repre&s;ented
in your work is not ju&s;t; for the&s;e animals
never re&s;t on the ground with their four feet.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall fini&s;h my notes, by remarking, that
both &s;pecies afford a whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment;
for, though their fle&s;h is often devoured to exce&s;s,
it was never known to be hurtful. Neither &s;hould
this fact excite &s;urpri&s;e, when it is con&s;idered
that the&s;e animals feed entirely on ripe fruits,
the juices, flowers, and perhaps the exudations
of a number of trees. The la&s;t I was induced
to believe from a pa&s;&s;age in Herodotus. But I
have not been able to a&s;certain the truth of it
by actual ob&s;ervation.&endq;</P>

<P>THIS animal is related, by certain charac|ters
only, to the &s;quirrel, the rat, and the
<HI>loir,</HI> or fat &s;quirrel. It re&s;embles the &s;quirrel in
nothing but the largene&s;s of its eyes, and the
form of its tail, which, however, is neither &s;o
long, nor &s;o bu&s;hy. It approaches the fat &s;quir|rel
<PB N="308" REF="362">
by the figure of its body, by the &s;hortne&s;s
and nakedne&s;s of its ears, and by the hairs on
its tail, which are of the &s;ame figure and length.
But it is not, like the fat &s;quirrel, &s;ubject to be
reduced to a torpid &s;tate by the action of cold.
Hence the flying &s;quirrel is neither a rat, a &s;quir|rel,
nor a fat &s;quirrel, though it participates of
the nature of each of the three &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Mr Klein gave the fir&s;t exact de&s;cription of
this animal in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions,
1733. It was known, however, long before that
time. It is found equally in all the northern
regions of the Old and New Continents<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the country of the Hurons, there are three kinds of &s;quirrels. &hellip; &hellip; The flying &s;quirrels, called <HI>Saboue&s;quanta,</HI> are mo&s;t valued.

Hi&s;t. of Birds, p. 191. Cate&s;by, Hi&s;t. Nat. Carol. tom. 2. p.</HI> 76.</NOTE>. But
it is more common in America than in Europe,
<PB N="309" REF="363">
where they are rare, and confined to &s;ome nor|thern
countries, as tho&s;e of Lithuania and Ru&s;|&s;ia.
This &s;mall animal dwells upon trees, like
the &s;quirrel. It moves about from branch to
branch; and, when leaping from one tree to an|other
con&s;iderably di&s;tant, the loo&s;e &s;kin or
membrane is &s;tretched forward by the fore-feet,
and backward by the hind-feet. The &s;kin be|ing
thus &s;tretched, and drawn out laterally above
an inch, augments the &s;urface of the body, with|out
increa&s;ing its quantity of matter, and, of
cour&s;e, retards &s;o much the acceleration of the
fall, that, by a &s;ingle leap, the creature is enabled
to &s;ail to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. This motion
has no re&s;emblance to the flying of birds, or the
fluttering of bats, both of which are performed
by &s;triking the air with repeated vibrations. It
is only a &s;imple leap, depending on a &s;ingle im|pul&s;e:
The motion produced by that impul&s;e is
prolonged, becau&s;e the animal's body is render|ed
&s;pecifically lighter, is more powerfully re&s;i&s;ted
by the air, and, con&s;equently, falls more &s;lowly.
The expan&s;ion of the &s;kin from foot to foot is
peculiar to the flying &s;quirrel; and this charac|ter
is &s;ufficient to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all other
&s;quirrels, rats, and dormice. But the mo&s;t re|markable
peculiarities of Nature are &s;eldom con|fined
to a &s;ingle &s;pecies. In the &s;ame genus,
there is another animal with a &s;imilar &s;kin, which
extends not only from foot to foot, but from the
head to the tail. This animal, a figure and de|&s;cription

differ &s;o greatly from our flying &s;quirrel, as to
con&s;titute a di&s;tinct &s;pecies. We cannot, how|ever,
determine the nature of this animal; it

fed with bread, fruits, and &s;eeds. They are par|ticularly

the pine and birch trees. They &s;earch not for
nuts and almonds, like the &s;quirrels. They make
a bed of leaves, in which they &s;leep during the

when &s;timulated by hunger. As they have little
activity, they become an ea&s;y prey to pine-wea|&s;els,

<P>I formerly remarked, p. 311. that there were lar|ger
flying &s;quirrels than tho&s;e of which we have
<PB N="313" REF="367">
given de&s;criptions, and that there is, in the royal
cabinet, a &s;kin five and a half inches long, while
that of the common &s;pecies exceeds not four
inches. But this difference is nothing, when com|pared
to that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between our flying
&s;quirrel, and the Ea&s;t-India <HI>taguan,</HI> who&s;e &s;kin
was &s;ent from Machian to the Prince de Condi,
who was &s;o obliging as to allow me to examine it.
This great flying &s;quirrel, which is pre&s;erved in
the cabinet of Chantilly, was twenty-three inches
long, from the point of the no&s;e to the extremi|ty
of the body. The&s;e animals are found not
only at Machian, but in the Philippine i&s;lands, and
probably in many other parts of India. The
one ju&s;t mentioned was taken on the Malabar
coa&s;t. Its &s;ize is gigantic, when compared with
the flying &s;quirrels of Ru&s;&s;ia and America; for
the latter exceeds not four and a half or five
inches in length. Neverthele&s;s, the taguan, or
great flying &s;quirrel, re&s;embles the other &s;pecies
in figure and in the prolongation of the &s;kin,
which is perfectly &s;imilar. But, as the differ|ence
of &s;ize is &s;o remarkable, it ought to be con|&s;idered
as a di&s;tinct &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The great flying &s;quirrel differs from the &s;mall,
1. In &s;ize, being twenty-three inches long. 2. In
the length of the tail, which is twenty-one inches.
Be&s;ides, the tail is not flat, like that of the com|mon
kind, but round, like that of the cat, and
covered with long blacki&s;h brown hair. 3. The
eyes and ears of both &s;pecies are &s;imilarly &s;itua|ted,
<PB N="314" REF="368">
and the black whi&s;kers are proportionally
the &s;ame; but the head of the large kind is &s;mall|er
in proportion to the &s;ize of its body. 4. The
face is entirely black; the &s;ides of the head, and
the cheeks, are mixed with black and white hairs;
on the top of the no&s;e, and round the eyes, the
hair is a mixture of black, white, and red. Be|hind
the ears there are dark long brown hairs,
which cover the &s;ides of the neck; the&s;e are not
to be found in the common kind. The top of the
head, and of the whole body, as far as the tail,
is &s;prinkled with black and white hairs, where
the black predominates, becau&s;e the white hairs
are black at the roots, and become white only
near their extremities. The under part of the
body is of a dirty white colour, which extends
below the belly. 5. The prolongation of the
&s;kin is covered above with dark brown hair, and
below with yellowi&s;h a&s;h-coloured hair. The
legs are of a reddi&s;h black colour, and the upper
part of the tail is brown. This brown &s;hade
grows gradually deeper till it becomes black at
the extremity of the tail. 6. The feet of the
great flying &s;quirrel have the &s;ame number of
toes as in the common kind; but tho&s;e of the for|mer
are covered with black, and tho&s;e of the
latter with white hair. The claws are thin and
hooked like tho&s;e of a cat. From this re&s;em|blance,
and that of the tail, the animal has re|ceived
the name of the <HI>flying cat.</HI> The large
claw of the fore-feet is five lines and a half
<PB N="315" REF="369">
long, and the longe&s;t of the hind-feet only five
lines. The figure of this animal, drawn by M.
de Seve as perfectly as the &s;tate of the dried &s;kin
would permit, is here repre&s;ented. We have
called it <HI>Le Taguan,</HI> in con&s;equence of the fol|lowing
pa&s;&s;age in the general hi&s;tory of voy|ages<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen, des Voyages, tom. 10. p. 410.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&startq;In the Philippine i&s;lands, there is a &s;pecies
of flying cat, of the &s;ize of a hare, and of the
colour of a fox, which the natives call <HI>Taguan.</HI>
It has wings like a bat, but covered with hair,
which they make u&s;e of in leaping from one
tree to another, at the di&s;tance of thirty palms.&endq;</P>
<P>After writing this article, a work of M. de
Vo&s;ma&euml;r, containing de&s;criptions of &s;everal qua|drupeds
and birds, has fallen into my hands. I
there read with plea&s;ure the de&s;cription of the
great flying &s;quirrel, and &s;ome remarks concern|ing
the &s;maller &s;pecies.</P>
<P>M. de Vo&s;ma&euml;r informs us, that he &s;aw, in
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Prince of Orange, two of
the &s;mall flying &s;quirrels alive; but that they
did not live long.</P>
<P>&startq;They &s;lept,' he &s;ays, `almo&s;t the whole day.
When bri&s;kly pu&s;hed, they made a &s;mall ef|fort,
as if they intended to fly; but they &s;tole
away immediately, being exceedingly timid.
They are fond of heat; and, when uncovered,
they quickly concealed them&s;elves under the
wool which formed their bed. Their food was
<PB N="316" REF="370">
&s;oaked bread, fruits, &amp;c. which they eat, like
the &s;quirrels, by &s;itting on their po&s;teriors, and
holding the food with their fore paws. At
the approach of night, they become more vi|vacious
and re&s;tle&s;s. The difference of climate
had unque&s;tionably great influence on the&s;e
animals, who appeared to be extremely deli|cate<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript, d'une ecureuil volant, par. M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r, p. 9.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks of M. de Vo&s;ma&euml;r corre&s;pond
with my own ob&s;ervations. I have ju&s;t now
one of the&s;e little animals (March 17. 1775) li|ving
in a cage, with a &s;mall box in the bottom
of it. It continues the whole day covered with
the cotton, and comes out only in the night to
take food. It has a faint cry, like that of a
mou&s;e, which is never heard but when the ani|mal
is forced out from among the cotton.
Though its teeth are very &s;mall, it bites &s;everely.
Its hair is extremely &s;mooth and agreeable to
the touch. There is no way of making it ex|tend
its wings, but by obliging it to fall from a
height. It is &s;o remarkably chilly, that I cannot
conceive how it can defend it&s;elf from the cold
in the northern climates; &s;ince in France, if not
kept in a chamber, and furni&s;hed with wool or
cotton to lie on, and even to wrap it&s;elf all over,
it would peri&s;h in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>With regard to the taguan, or great flying
&s;quirrel, let us attend to the remarks of M. de
Vo&s;ma&euml;r: &startq;The &s;mall flying &s;quirrel de&s;cribed
<PB N="317" REF="371">
by M. de Buffon, has a great affinity to the
larger &s;pecies. They both have &s;imilar mem|branes,
not for flying, but for &s;upporting them|&s;elves
in the air, when they leap from branch
to branch.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;kin of the <HI>great flying &s;quirrel,</HI> which
is a more proper appellation than that of the
<HI>flying cat,</HI> was &s;ent me in a dried &s;tate. M.
Alamand has given a &s;hort de&s;cription of this
animal from a female &s;ubject pre&s;erved in the
cabinet of the Leyden academy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Valentine fir&s;t mentioned the&s;e animals, and
&s;ays, that they are found in the i&s;land of Gi|lolo,
and go by the name of <HI>flying civets.</HI> He
remarks, that they have long tails like tho&s;e of
the monkeys; that, when at re&s;t, their wings
are not &s;een; that they are wild and timid;
that their head is reddi&s;h, with a mixture of
gray; that their wings, or rather membranes,
are covered on both &s;ides with hair; that their
bite is &s;o &s;trong, that they ea&s;ily e&s;cape from a
wooden cage in a &s;ingle night; that by &s;ome
people they are called <HI>flying monkeys;</HI> that they
are al&s;o found in the i&s;land of Ternat, where
they were fir&s;t mi&s;taken for &s;quirrels, only the
head was thinner and larger, there was gray
hair above the muzzle, and a black line run
the whole length of the back; that the ex|ten&s;ible
&s;kin, which adheres to their bodies,
is garni&s;hed with hair, as white, on the under
&s;ide, as that of the belly; and that, when they
<PB N="318" REF="372">
leap from tree to tree, they extend their mem|branes,
and have then the appearance of being
flat.&endq;</P>
<P>In the work of M. l'Abb&eacute; Prevo&s;t, it is &s;aid,
that this animal is found in the Philippine i&s;lands,
where it is called <HI>taguan.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;I have &s;een two females, the one in the Ley|den
cabinet, the other in that of <HI>M. Heeteren</HI>
at the Hague. The colour of the body was a
light che&s;nut, deeper on the back, and the end
of the tail was blacki&s;h. The difference of
&s;ex is di&s;tingui&s;hable by &s;ix &s;mall paps, placed
at equal di&s;tances, in two rows, from the brea&s;t
to the belly. I have al&s;o &s;een two males in
the Prince of Orange's cabinet. The length
of the body, in Rheni&s;h mea&s;ure, was one foot
five inches, and that of the tail one foot eight.
The head is more pointed than that of the
&s;quirrel.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The ears are &s;mall, pointed, and covered on
the out&s;ide with &s;hort, fine, clear brown hair.
Above the eyes, there are two long browni&s;h
yellow hairs; but there are none on the eye|lids.
On each &s;ide of the muzzle, there are
long, black, rigid whi&s;kers. The no&s;e is na|ked;
the teeth, like tho&s;e of the &s;quirrels, are
two above and two below, of a deep yellow
colour, and very long. The grinders are at
the bottom of the muzzle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Both fore and hind feet, e&s;pecially the latter,
are concealed by the membrane, which covers
<PB N="319" REF="373">
them nearly as far as the paws. The fore|feet
are divided into four black toes, the two
middlemo&s;t, and particularly the third, being
much longer than the other two. The hind|feet
are al&s;o black, and divided into five toes,
four of which are of equal length; but the
fifth, or innermo&s;t, is much &s;horter, and has
the appearance of a &s;imple appendage. The
claws are large, &s;harp, black before, white be|low,
and broad at the origin. The articula|tions
of the toes are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the
&s;quirrels.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;kin or membrane is thinne&s;t in the
&startq;middle, where it is about four inches broad on
each &s;ide, and exceeds not the thickne&s;s of fine
Indian paper. In other parts, it is al&s;o very
thin, of a clear texture, and garni&s;hed with
&s;mall che&s;nut hairs. Near the fore and hind
feet, it becomes thicker, and ri&s;es in the form
of a bag, wide&s;t at the thighs, and growing
gradually narrower towards the paws. This
part is clo&s;ely covered with brown and black
hairs. Upon the fore-paws it appears loo&s;e,
hangs down like a rag, and is covered with
thick hair. The external edges of this &s;kin
are bounded with a thick &s;elvage of black and
gray hairs.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The upper part of the head, the back, and
the origin of the tail, are covered with pretty
long, thick hairs, black in the under part, and
<PB N="320" REF="374">
mo&s;tly of a grayi&s;h white colour at the &s;um|mits.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The hairs of the tail are black, more gray
near the body, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to make the
tail appear round.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The cheeks are of a grayi&s;h brown colour;
and the throat, brea&s;t, and belly, are of a clear
whiti&s;h gray. On the under &s;ide of the mem|brane,
there are al&s;o gray hairs; but they are
very thinly &s;cattered.&endq;</P>

<P>THIS animal inhabits the northern regions
of both worlds. It has a great re&s;em|blance
to the &s;quirrel, from which it differs only
by the following external characters. It is
larger than the &s;quirrel, and its hair is not red|di&s;h,
but of a gray colour, more or le&s;s deep.
The ears are deprived of the long hairs, which
adorn tho&s;e of the common &s;quirrel. The&s;e dif|ferences,
which are con&s;tant, &s;eem &s;ufficient to
con&s;titute a di&s;tinct &s;pecies. Several authors
maintain, that the gray &s;quirrels of Europe dif|fer
from tho&s;e of America; that the former be|long
to the common kind, who&s;e colour changes
with the &s;ea&s;on in our northern climates. With|out
pretending to deny this la&s;t fact, which,
<PB N="322" REF="380">
however, is not properly a&s;certained, we con&s;ider
the gray &s;quirrel of Europe and that of Ameri|ca
as the &s;ame animal, and as a &s;pecies di&s;tinct
from the common &s;quirrel; for our &s;quirrels are
found in North America as well as in the north
of Europe. They are of the &s;ame &s;ize, and their
colour is of a more or le&s;s lively red, according
to the temperature of the climate. At the &s;ame
time, we find, in both Continents, other &s;quir|rels,
which are larger, and who&s;e hair is gray or
blacki&s;h in all &s;ea&s;ons. Be&s;ides, the fur of the
gray &s;quirrel is much finer and &s;ofter than that
of the common kind. Hence it appears, that
the&s;e two animals, the differences between which
are con&s;tant, and their &s;pecies, though very &s;i|milar,
have never intermixed, ought to be re|garded
as &s;eparate &s;pecies. M. Regnard<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e gray &s;quirrels are the &s;ame with the French &s;quir|rels, only their reddi&s;h colour changes to gray during the win|ter &s;nows. The farther north, they turn always more gray. The Laplanders make war again&s;t them in the winter; and their dogs are &s;o well trained to this &s;pecies of hunting, that they never failed to di&s;cover the &s;quirrels upon the highe&s;t trees, and to adverti&s;e the hunters who accompanied us. We &s;hot &s;ome of them with our guns; for the Laplanders had not then their round arrows, with which they bring down the&s;e animals; and we had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing with what dexterity and quickne&s;s they take off the &s;kin. The hunting &s;ea&s;on begins about Michaelmas. Almo&s;t every native of Lapland is oc|cupied in this bu&s;ine&s;s, which is a con&s;iderable article of com|merce. Forty &s;kins are &s;old for a crown. But there is no merchandi&s;e in which a man may be more deceived, than in that of the gray &s;quirrel and crmines; for you buy without &s;ee|ing, the fur &s;ide of the &s;kins being always turned in mo&s;t. There is no di&s;tinction to be made. The good and bad are all &s;old at the &s;ame price. We learned from our Laplanders a &s;ur|pri&s;ing fact concerning the&s;e gray &s;quirrels, which was after|wards confirmed by our own experience. They often change the places of their re&s;idence, and not one of them can be found, during a whole winter, where there were millions the preceding year. In their marches from one part of the country to another, when it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a lake or a river, which are very frequent in Lapland, the&s;e ani|mals lay hold of a piece of pine or birch bark, which they draw to the edge of the water, mount upon it, and abandon them&s;elves to the plea&s;ure of the wind and waves. They e|rect their tails in the form of &s;ails; but, if the wind blows too &s;trong, or the waves ri&s;e high, both pilot and ve&s;&s;el are overturned. This kind of &s;hipwreck, which often con&s;i&s;ts of three or four thou&s;and &s;ail, generally enriches &s;ome Lapland|ers, who find the dead bodies on the &s;hore, and, if they have not lain too long on the &s;and, prepare the furs in the ordina|ry manner. But, when the winds are favourable, the poor creatures make a happy voyage, and arrive at their de&s;tined port. This remarkable fact might have the appearance of a fable, if it had not fallen within my own ob&s;ervation; <HI>Oeu|vres de M. Regnard, tom. 1. p.</HI> 163.</NOTE> affirms
<PB N="323" REF="381">
po&s;itively, that the gray &s;quirrels of Lapland
are the &s;ame animals with our French &s;quirrels.
This authority would be &s;ufficient, were it not

<P>THE palm &s;quirrel is of the &s;ize of a rat, or
of a &s;mall &s;quirrel. He lives upon the
palm-trees, and from that circum&s;tance he has
had his name. By &s;ome he is called the <HI>palm|rat,</HI>
<PB N="329" REF="388">
and by others the <HI>palm-&s;quirrel.</HI> But, as he
is neither a rat nor a &s;quirrel, we have given
him the &s;imple denomination of <HI>Le palmi&s;te.</HI>
The form of his head is nearly the &s;ame with
that of the &s;hort-tailed field-mou&s;e, and covered
with frizled hair. His long tail trails not, like
that of the rat, but is elevated vertically, with|out,
however, lying on his back, like that of the
<PB N="330" REF="389">
&s;quirrel. The tail is covered with hair longer
than that of the body, but &s;horter than the hair
on the tail of a &s;quirrel. Along the &s;pine of
the back, from the neck to the tail, there is a
whiti&s;h &s;tripe, accompanied on each &s;ide with a
brown &s;tripe, which is followed by another
white &s;tripe. This &s;triking character, by which
this animal would appear to be di&s;tingui&s;hed
from all others, is found to be nearly the &s;ame
in the Barbary and ground &s;quirrels. The&s;e
three animals have &s;uch a re&s;emblance to each
other, that Mr Ray<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sciurus Getulus Caii, mu&s;tela Africana Clu&s;ii, eadem nobis videtur.&mdash;De&s;criptio mu&s;telae Africanae cum &s;ciuri Getuli de&s;criptione &s;atis bene convenit, ut non dubitem idem animal e&s;&s;e: Huic &s;imilis e&s;t &s;ciurus a clari&s;&s;imo <HI>Dom. Li&s;ter,</HI> ob&s;ervatus et de&s;criptus; <HI>Raii &s;ynop&s;. quad.</HI> p. 216.</NOTE> imagined they con&s;tituted
but one &s;pecies. If it be con&s;idered, however, that
the palm and Barbary &s;quirrels are only found
in the warm climates of the Old Continent, and
that the ground &s;quirrel, de&s;cribed by Li&s;ter,
Cate&s;by<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cate&s;by, hi&s;t. nat. de la Caroline, tom. 2. p. 75.</NOTE>, and Edwards<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Edwards, nat. hi&s;t of birds, part 4. p. 181.</NOTE>, is peculiar to the
cold and temperate regions of the New World,
we mu&s;t conclude them to be different &s;pe|cies.
By a clo&s;er examination, we perceive
that the whtie and brown &s;tripes of the ground
&s;quirrel are differently di&s;po&s;ed from tho&s;e of
the palm-&s;quirrel. In the palm-&s;quirrel, the
white &s;tripe, which extends along the &s;pine
of the back, is black or brown in the ground
&s;quirrel, and the white &s;tripes are placed next
<PB N="331" REF="390">
the black, as the black are next the whtie in the
palm-&s;quirrel. Be&s;ides, the palm-&s;quirrel has
only three white &s;tripes; but the ground-&s;quir|rel
has four. The latter turns his tail upon his
back, but the former does not. The palm-&s;quir|rel
dwells upon trees; but the ground-&s;quirrel
keeps always on the &s;urface of the earth, and,
from this circum&s;tance, he has obtained his
name. In fine, the ground-&s;quirrel is &s;maller
than the palm-&s;quirrel: From all the&s;e con|&s;iderations,
they appear to be two di&s;tinct &s;pe|cies.</P>
<P>With regard to the Barbary &s;quirrel, as it is a
native of the &s;ame continent and climate, as it is
of the &s;ame &s;ize and nearly of the &s;ame figure, with
the palm-&s;quirrel, they might be con&s;idered as va|rieties
of the &s;ame &s;pecies. By comparing, how|ever,
the de&s;cription and figure of the Barbary
&s;quirrel given by Caius<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sciurus getulus <HI>Caii, apud Ge&s;ner. hi&s;t. quad.</HI> p. 847.</NOTE>, and copied by Aldro|vandus
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrov. de quad. digit. p. 405.</NOTE> and John&s;ton<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John&s;. de quad. p. 113.</NOTE>, with the de&s;cription
and figure we have given of the palm-&s;quirrel,
and by again comparing Edwards's de&s;cription
and figure of the Barbary &s;quirrel, we &s;hall per|ceive
di&s;tinctions &s;o remarkable as to point out
the&s;e animals as belonging to different &s;pecies.
All the three are in the royal cabinet. In the
Barbary &s;quirrel, the head and face are rounder,
the ears larger, and the hair of the tail longer
and more bu&s;hy, than in the palm-&s;quirrel. In
<PB N="332" REF="391">
the form of the head and body, the Barbary
&s;quirrel re&s;embles the &s;quirrel more than the
rat, and the palm-&s;quirrel re&s;embles the rat more
than the &s;quirrel. The Barbary &s;quirrel has
four white &s;tripes, the palm-&s;quirrel only three.
In the palm-&s;quirrel, the middle white &s;tripe
runs along the &s;pine of the back; but, in the Bar|bary
&s;quirrel, the &s;tripe along the back is black
mixed with red, &amp;c. Be&s;ides, the&s;e animals have
nearly the &s;ame manners and di&s;po&s;itions as the
common &s;quirrels: They all feed upon fruits,
which they carry to their mouths by their fore|paws.
They have the &s;ame voice and cry,
the &s;ame in&s;tinct and agility. They are ex|tremely
gentle and lively. They are ea&s;ily ta|med,
and contract &s;uch an attachment to their
habitation, that, after leaving it, they &s;pontane|ou&s;ly
return. The figure of both is hand&s;ome.
Their robe, which is &s;triped with white, is
more beautiful than that of the &s;quirrel; their
&s;ize is &s;maller, their body lighter, and their
movements equally prompt. Like the common
&s;quirrel, the palm and Barbary &s;quirrels dwell
on the tops of trees; but the ground &s;quirrel
never ri&s;es from the earth, in which, like the
long-tailed field-mou&s;e, he makes a retreat im|penetrable
by the water. Unle&s;s completely
tamed, he bites every per&s;on indi&s;criminately<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage du Pays des Hurons, par Sagard Theodat, p. 306.</NOTE>.
Hence, in manners and di&s;po&s;itions, he has a
greater re&s;emblance to the rats and field-mice
than to the &s;quirrels.</P>

<P>IN South America, there are three animals,
with a long muzzle, a narrow mouth, with|out
any teeth, and a long round tongue, that
<PB N="334" REF="396">
they thru&s;t into the ant-ne&s;ts, and retract it
when covered with the&s;e in&s;ects, which con&s;ti|tute
their principal food. The fir&s;t of the&s;e
ant-eaters is called by the Bra&s;ilians <HI>Tamandua|guacu,</HI>
<PB N="335" REF="397">
or <HI>great Tamandua,</HI> to which the French
inhabitants of America have given the name of
<HI>Tamanoir.</HI> From the end of the muzzle to the
origin of the tail, it is about four feet in length.
The head is from fourteen to fifteen inches long,
and the tail about two feet and a half, covered
with coar&s;e hair more than a foot in length.
The muzzle is immoderately long, the neck
&s;hort, the head narrow, the eyes &s;mall and black,
the ears roundi&s;h, the tongue thin, more than
two feet long, and, when retracted, folded up
in the mouth. The legs exceed not a foot in
length, tho&s;e before being a little taller and thin|ner
than tho&s;e behind. The feet are round.
The fore-feet have four claws, the two middle|mo&s;t
being large&s;t. Tho&s;e behind have five claws.
The colour of the hairs, both on the body and
tail, is a mixture of black and white. The hair
on the tail is di&s;po&s;ed in the form of a plume,
which the animal, when he wants to &s;leep, or
when he wants to defend him&s;elf from rains or
the heat of the &s;un, turns on his back, and co|vers
his whole body with it. The long hairs
of the tail and body are not round through
<PB N="336" REF="398">
their whole extent, but flat at the extremities,
and feel dry to the touch, like withered herbs.
When irritated, he gives a bri&s;k agitation to his
tail; but, when walking at ea&s;e, he allows it to
trail and &s;weep the road over which he pa&s;&s;es.
The hairs on the anterior parts of his body are
&s;horter than tho&s;e on the po&s;terior: The latter
are turned backward, and the former forward.
The anterior parts are al&s;o whither than the po|&s;terior.
There is a black &s;tripe upon the brea&s;t,
which &s;tretches along the &s;ides, and terminates
on the back near the thighs. The hind legs are
nearly black, and tho&s;e before almo&s;t white,
with a large black &s;pot about the middle. The
great ant-eater runs &s;o &s;low, that a man can
ea&s;ily overtake him in the chace. His feet &s;eem
le&s;s fitted for running than for climbing, and
&s;eizing cylindrical bodies; for he takes &s;uch
a forcible hold of a branch or a &s;tick, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible to make him quit it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of the&s;e animals, or the middle
ant-eater, is called &s;imply <HI>tamandua</HI> by the Ame|ricans.
He is much &s;maller than the former,
being only about eighteen inches from the ex|tremity
of the muzzle to the origin of the tail.
His head is &s;ix inches in length. His muzzle
is long, and crooked downward. The tail is ten
inches long, and naked at the point. The ears are
erect, and an inch in length. The tongue is
round, eight inches long, and placed in a kind
of groove or canal within the lower jaw. The
<PB N="337" REF="399">
height of the legs exceeds four inches; and they
are of the &s;ame form, and furni&s;hed with the
&s;ame number of claws, as the great ant-eater.
He climbs, and adheres firmly to the branches,
like the former &s;pecies, and runs or walks equal|ly
ill. Neither can he &s;helter him&s;elf with his
tail; becau&s;e it is too &s;hort, and partly not co|vered
with hair. When he &s;leeps, he conceals
his head under his neck and fore legs.</P>
<P>The third &s;pecies is called by the natives of
Guiana <HI>ouatiriouaou.</HI> To di&s;tingui&s;h it from
the two former, we have given it the appellation
of the <HI>lea&s;t ant-eater.</HI> It is much &s;maller than
the middle kind; for it exceeds not &s;ix or &s;even
inches from the extremity of the muzzle to the
origin of the tail; the head is two inches long,
and the muzzle is proportionally &s;horter than
that of the middle ant-eater. The tail, which
is &s;even inches in length, curls downward at the
extremity, where it is naked. The tongue is
narrow, a little compre&s;&s;ed, and very long. It
has almo&s;t no neck. The head is thick in pro|portion
to the body. The eyes are placed low,
at no great di&s;tance from the corners of the
mouth. The ears are &s;mall, and concealed by
the hair. The fore legs are only three inches
long, and their feet have but two claws, the out|mo&s;t
of which is much thicker and longer than
the inmo&s;t. There are four claws on the hind
feet. The hair on the body is about nine inches
long, &s;oft, and of a brilliant, colour, being a mix|ture
<PB N="338" REF="400">
of red with a bright yellow. The feet are
not fitted for walking, but for climbing, and lay|ing
hold of objects. The animal mounts upon
trees, and &s;u&s;pends him&s;elf on the branches by
the extremity of his tail.</P>
<P>Of this genus, we know only the three &s;pe|cies
above de&s;cribed. M. Bri&s;&s;on mentions, from
Seba, a fourth &s;pecies, under the name of the
<HI>long-eared ant-eater.</HI> But this &s;pecies &s;eems to
be extremely &s;u&s;picious; for, in Seba's enume|ration
of the ant-eaters, he &s;ays expre&s;sly, &startq;We
have, in our cabinet, <HI>&s;ix &s;pecies</HI> of ant-eaters.&endq;
He de&s;cribes, however, only five; and among
the&s;e five he places the <HI>y&s;quiepatl,</HI> or &s;tifling wea|&s;el,
an animal not only of a different &s;pecies, but
of a different genus, very remote from that of the
ant-eaters; &s;ince it has teeth<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vapulavit aliquando optimus autor de nominibus pro|priis, &s;i y&s;quiepati &s;eu vulpeculam Mexicanam, tamanduam dixit; <HI>p.</HI> 66.

like that of other quadrupeds, and approaches
very near to the wea&s;el kind. Of the&s;e &s;ix &s;pe|cies,
pretended to be pre&s;erved in the cabinet of
Seba, there remain only four; for the y&s;quie|patl,
which is the fifth, is by no means an ant|eater,
and he makes no mention of the &s;ixth, un|le&s;s
the author intended to rank the &s;caly lizard
under this genus, which appears not from his
<PB N="339" REF="401">
de&s;criptions. The &s;caly lizard feeds upon ants;
he has a long muzzle, a narrow mouth, with|out
any apparent teeth, and a long, round tongue.
The&s;e characters are common to the &s;caly lizard
and ant-eaters. But the former differs from all
other quadrupeds by the &s;ingularity of having its
body covered with large &s;cales, in&s;tead of hair
Be&s;ides, it is an animal peculiar to the warm
climates of the Old Continent; while the ant-eaters,
who&s;e bodies are covered with hair, are
only found in the &s;outhern regions of the New
World. There remains, therefore, but four &s;pe|cies,
in&s;tead of &s;ix announced by Seba; and, of
the&s;e four, only one is recogni&s;able from his de|&s;criptions,
which is our third, or lea&s;t ant-eater,
to whom Seba has given but one claw to each
fore foot<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fig. 3. <HI>Tamandua,</HI> or <HI>another white American coati.</HI> This animal is totally different from the preceding (he means that of table 37. fig. 2. See the following note). The head is much &s;horter, and the ears much &s;maller. The eyes are a little larger, and the inferior part of the muzzle &s;omewhat longer. Their tongues are more &s;imilar, both of them being fitted for &s;wallowing ants. The &s;houlders are large, the body thick and &s;hort, and <HI>the fore-feet are armed with one large hooked claw.</HI> The hind legs and feet re&s;emble tho&s;e of an ape. Its white woolly hair is &s;horter than that of the preceding; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of its cri&s;ped tail. This animal is reckoned the rare&s;t of its &s;pecies. The Aethiopians of Suri|nam call it <HI>coati,</HI> and relate, that, when apprehended, it rolls it&s;elf up, with the feet &s;o clo&s;ely attached to each other, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to force them a&s;under. They die in a mo|ment, when immer&s;ed in &s;pirit of wine, or in the liquor <HI>kildu|$vel; Seba, vol. 1. p. 60. plate 37. fig.</HI> 3.</NOTE>, in&s;tead of two. The other three are
&s;o ill de&s;cribed, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="340" REF="402">
their true &s;pecies. I thought it proper to tran|&s;cribe
the&s;e de&s;criptions entire, not only to prove
what I have advanced, but to give an idea of
what credit is due to this writer. The animal
he calls <HI>tamandua murmecophage d'Amerique,
tom. 1. p. 60. tab. 37. fig.</HI> 2. has no relation to
any of the three of which we are here treating.
To be convinced of this, we have only to read
the author's de&s;cription<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tamandua murmecophage d'Amerique.</HI> This animal is very common in the We&s;t-Indies; but the only one we have &s;een was brought from the Ea&s;t-Indies. Several naturali&s;ts have entertained marvellous ideas concerning this creature. Some imagine it to be the <HI>leo for micarius,</HI> others the <HI>formica-leo,</HI> the <HI>formica-vulpes,</HI> the <HI>formica lupus,</HI> &amp;c. M. Poupart, in the <HI>Mem. de l'Acad. royale des &s;ciences, ann. 1704, p.</HI> 235. remarks, that this animal was gray, and made &s;nares, like a &s;pi|der, for entangling ants; but this compari&s;on &s;eems not to be ju&s;t. Ba&s;tamantanus, who has written a book upon the reptiles mentioned in the Bible, regards the <HI>murmeco-leo,</HI> another name for this animal, as a &s;pecies of beetle called the <HI>$orned beetle,</HI> and which is denominated the <HI>flying &s;lag</HI> by the Germans. (<HI>All this, we perceive, is very important and very u&s;e|ful in the de&s;cription of a quadruped.</HI>) But, continues the au|thor, all the&s;e de&s;criptions, and &s;everal others, expre&s;s not the nature of this animal, the figure of which we have given from the original. It is covered with &s;oft woolly hair, has a &s;hort neck, broad &s;houlders, a long narrow head and muzzle, from which i&s;&s;ues a long tongue, adapted for &s;eizing and &s;wallow|ing ants. The wi&s;dom of the Creator has furni&s;hed the&s;e a|nimals with the nece&s;&s;ary organs for collecting food agreeable to their ta&s;te. The fore paws have each, <HI>be&s;ide the ordinary toes, three other toes,</HI> which have grown above the others, and are armed with hooked claws, the large&s;t of which is on the middle toe. It is with the&s;e that they &s;crape the earth, and pierce the ants ne&s;ts. The no&s;trils, which are placed very near the mouth, are &s;trait, rough, and furni&s;hed with hair. They di&s;cover the retreats of the ants by the &s;cent. The ears are oblong, or pendulous. The hind feet, as in the bear, are divided into five toes, armed with long crooked claws. The tail, which is long and bu&s;hy, terminates in a point, and they u&s;e it, like the monkeys, in fixing them&s;elves to the branches of trees. The te&s;tes of the males are concealed within the &s;kin. The ants, both large and &s;mall, become a prey to the&s;e animals, which, in their turn, are u&s;ed by men as a medicine; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p. 60. tab. 37. fig.</HI> 2.&mdash;From &s;uch a de&s;cription nothing can be learned: To apply it to the ant-eaters, as Linnaeus has done, to give, at the &s;ame time, this animal three toes on the fore feet, be&s;ide the ordinary three, and to make the&s;e grow above the others, are ab&s;urdities &s;o glaring, as to throw di&s;credit upon the whole narration.</NOTE>. The &s;econd, which
<PB N="341" REF="403">
he mentions under the name of the <HI>tamandua|guacu</HI>
of Bra&s;il, or the <HI>bear which eats the ants</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Tamaudua-guacu</HI> of Bra&s;il, or the <HI>bear that eats the ants.</HI> This is the large&s;t &s;pecies we have ever &s;een. Marcgrave calls it <HI>Tamandua-guacu,</HI> and Cardan, <HI>ur&s;us formicarius,</HI> or the <HI>bear that eats the ants.</HI> The body is long; the &s;houlders are broad and high; the head is very long; the muzzle gradu|ally tapers to a point; and the no&s;trils are large and open: The tongue, which it thru&s;ts out, to &s;eize the ants, <HI>about the eight part of a cubit,</HI> terminates in a round button. The ears are long and <HI>pendulous.</HI> The eyes are pretty large, and de|fended by thick hairs. The muzzle is long, wrinkled, and garni&s;hed with hair. The re&s;t of the body is covered with long, thick hairs, &s;imilar to hogs bri&s;tles, but become fine and woolly near the &s;kin, and their colour is a bright che&s;nut. The hair on the belly is of a deeper brown. Under the tail, which is long, and terminates in a point, the colour of the hair is a bright yellow. The female, who&s;e figure we have given, has eight paps, three on each &s;ide of the belly, and two between the fore feet. Witne&s;&s;es worthy of credit relate, that the females bring forth, at every litter, as many young as they have paps; in which they re&s;emble the &s;wine, <HI>who ne|ver-bring forth many at a time, unle&s;s they have a great number of paps.</HI> Both the fore and hind feet are larger than tho&s;e de|&s;cribed in fig. 2. of the preceding table. They u&s;e for food the large&s;t kinds of ants.</P>
<P>We have in our cabinet <HI>&s;ix &s;pecies of ant-eaters,</HI> who all differ from each other in the figure of the body, head, feet, and claws. The tamandua repre&s;ented in fig. 2. (<HI>Note. He is $ere &s;peaking of the f&s;quiepatl, which differs more from the tamandua than a cat from a dog)</HI> is a fourth le&s;s than the former; its head, ears, and eyes, are al&s;o &s;maller. His fore foot has only a &s;ingle claw, which is &s;trong and hooked. The hind foot has three toes and three claws. The hair is &s;oft, woolly, and f$ the colour of that of a young hare. The figure of the fifth &s;pecies of tamandua is the &s;ame. The colour of the hair is a pale red on the back, mixed with &s;ilvery white, and a yellowi&s;h a&s;h-colour on the belly. This &s;pecies has four paps, two under the fore and two under the hind legs. (<HI>This &s;pe|cies, being of the &s;ame figure with that which precedes it, mu&s;t, there|fore, be a &s;pecies of y&s;quiepatl, and not of the tamandua.)</HI> The &s;ixth &s;pecies has a longer muzzle, and ears erect like tho&s;e of the fox. None of the&s;e &s;pecies have teeth; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p. 65. tab. 40. fig.</HI> 1.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend what the author &s;ays, or what he means by the &s;ixth &s;pecies. We only per|ceive that he clearly contradicts him&s;elf, when he tells us that none of the&s;e &s;pecies have teeth, &s;ince the y&s;quiepatl, which is <HI>nominatim</HI> included among the &s;ix, has a great number of teeth. From &s;uch examples, we may form a judgment of this author and his work. It is a &s;ubject of regret, that men who make cabinets of natural objects are not better informed, and that, to gratify their in&s;ignificant vanity, and enhance the value of their collections, they undertake the publication of de&s;criptions, which are always replete with &s;uch numerous exaggerations and blunders, that the correction of them would require more time than the authors be&s;tow on the compo&s;i|tion of their voluminous works.</P></NOTE>,
<PB N="342" REF="404">
p. 65. tab. 40. fig. 1. This is vague and equivo|cal
language. I agree, however, with Klein<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Klein de quadrup. p. 45.</NOTE>
and Linnaeus, that it may be the true tamandua|guacu,
or great ant-eater; but &s;o mi&s;erably de|&s;cribed
<PB N="343" REF="405">
and repre&s;ented, that Linnaeus<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Linn. Sy&s;t. Nat. p. 51.</NOTE> has united,
under one &s;pecies, Seba's fir&s;t and &s;econd animals,
namely, that of tab. 37. fig. 2. and that of tab.
40. fig. 1. M. Bri&s;&s;on has con&s;idered the la&s;t as
a di&s;tinct &s;pecies; but I know not whether the
e&s;tabli&s;hing of this &s;pecies be better founded, than
the reproach he throws upon M. Klein for con|founding
it with that of the great ant-eater.
The only reproach which M. Klein &s;eems to
merit is for adding, to a good de&s;cription that he
has given of this animal, the fal&s;e remarks of
Seba. In fine, the third of the&s;e animals, of
which we find a figure in Seba, tom. 2. p. 48.
tab. 47. fig. 2. is &s;o ill de&s;cribed, that, notwith|&s;tanding
my confidence in the judgment of M.
Linnaeus and Klein, this animal, from Seba's fi|gure
and de&s;cription, can never be referred to the
<HI>tamandua-i,</HI> or middle ant-eater. I would beg of
them to peru&s;e the de&s;cription<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The little American tamandua,</HI> or <HI>the ant-eater delineated along with a ne&s;t of the&s;e in&s;ects.</HI> See how it embraces with its fore claws the ne&s;t of ants, upon whom alone it feeds. Ob&s;erve its oblong, thin, narrow head, its &s;hort ears, its pointed muzzle, that conceals its long, &s;lender tongue, with which it catches and &s;wallows the ants, as I propo&s;e to &s;how in the following plates, (<HI>no &s;uch plates appear in his work.</HI>) The head, legs, feet, tail, and the fore part of the body, are &s;traw-coloured. The hind part of the body is reddi&s;h brown. Upon the brea&s;t there is a belt of &s;ilky hair, which gradually di&s;appears about the middle of the back. The tail is &s;hort, almo&s;t naked, and curled inward; <HI>Seba, vol. 2. p. 48. tab. 47. fig.</HI> 2.&mdash;Note. The la&s;t characters in this de&s;cription agree pretty well with the tamandua; but, in general, it is &s;o incorrect, that nothing certain can be determined from it.</NOTE> a &s;econd time,
<PB N="344" REF="406">
and then form their judgment. Di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of
this kind are always di&s;agreeable; but they of|ten
cannot be avoided in details of Natural hi|&s;tory.
Before de&s;cribing an object, we mu&s;t
clear it, as far as po&s;&s;ible, from all ob&s;curities,
and mark the numberle&s;s errors that ob&s;truct the
road to truth, at which it is often difficult to
arrive.</P>
<P>From this critical examination, one thing ap|pears
to be certain, that three &s;pecies of ant-eaters
actually exi&s;t; that the&s;e three are the
great, the middle, and the lea&s;t ant-eater, or the
<HI>tamanoir,</HI> the <HI>tamandua,</HI> and the <HI>fourmiller;</HI> and
that the fourth &s;pecies, mentioned by M. Bri&s;&s;on,
under the name of the <HI>long-eared ant-eater,</HI> is
very doubtful, as well as the other &s;pecies de|&s;cribed
by Seba. We have &s;een the great and
the lea&s;t ant-eater; their &s;kins are in the royal
cabinet, and they are very di&s;tinct &s;pecies. But
we have never &s;een the middle kind. Our de|&s;cription
of it &s;hall be taken from Pi&s;o and Marc|grave,
the only authors who ought to be con&s;ult|ed
concerning this animal, becau&s;e all others
have copied from them.</P>
<P>As to &s;ize of body, the <HI>tamandua,</HI> or middle
ant-eater, may be con&s;idered as a mean propor|tional
between the great and the lea&s;t kind. Like
the great ant-eater, he has a long muzzle, and
four toes on the fore feet; but, like the lea&s;t
kind, his tail, by which he hangs on the branches
of trees, is naked at the extremity. Both kinds,
<PB N="345" REF="407">
when &s;u&s;pended on a branch, balance their bo|dies,
&s;tretch their muzzles towards the hollows
they di&s;cover in trees, thru&s;t in their long tongues,
and quickly retract them, in order to &s;wallow
the in&s;ects they have collected.</P>
<P>The&s;e three animals, which are &s;o different in
&s;ize and proportions of body, have many com|mon
qualities, both in their &s;tructure and man|ners.
They all feed upon ants, and plunge their
tongues into honey, and other liquid or vi&s;cid
&s;ub&s;tances. They readily pick up crums of bread,
or &s;mall mor&s;els of fle&s;h. They are ea&s;ily tamed.
They can &s;ub&s;i&s;t a long time without any food.
They never &s;wallow all the liquor which they
take for drink; for a part of it falls back through
the no&s;trils. They generally &s;leep during the
day, and move about in the night. They run
&s;o &s;lowly, that a man may ea&s;ily overtake them
in an open field. Their fle&s;h, though its ta&s;te
be very di&s;agreeable, is eaten by the &s;avages.</P>
<P>At a di&s;tance, the great ant-eater has the ap|pearance
of a fox; and, for this rea&s;on, &s;ome tra|vellers
have given him the name of the <HI>American
fox.</HI> He has &s;trength &s;ufficient to defend him|&s;elf
from a large dog, or even from the <HI>jaguar</HI>
or Bra&s;ilian cat. When attacked, he at fir&s;t
&s;ights on end, and, like the bear, annoys the e|nemy
with the claws of his fore feet, which are
very terrible weapons. He then lies down on
his back, and u&s;es all the four feet; in which &s;i|tuation
he is almo&s;t invincible, and continues the
<PB N="346" REF="408">
combat to the la&s;t extremity: Even when he
kills his enemy, he quits him not for a long time
after. He is enabled to re&s;i&s;t better than mo&s;t
animals; becau&s;e he is covered with long bu&s;hy
hair, his &s;kin is remarkably thick, his fle&s;h has
little &s;en&s;ation, and his principle of life is very
tenacious.</P>
<P>All the three ant-eaters are natives of the warm
climates of America, as Bra&s;il, Guiana, the coun|try
of the Amazones, &amp;c. None of them are
to be found in Canada, or the northern regions
of the New World, and therefore &s;hould have no
exi&s;tence in the Old Continent. Kolbe<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. du Cap, par Kolbe, tom. 3. p. 43.</NOTE> and
De&s;marchais<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de De&s;marchais, tom. 3. p. 307.</NOTE>, however, mention the&s;e animals
as natives of Africa; but they &s;eem to have con|founded
the &s;caly lizard with the ant-eaters.
Perhaps they have been mi&s;led by the following
pa&s;&s;age in Marcgrave: &startq;<HI>Tamandua-guacu Bra|&s;ilieu&s;ibus,
Congen&s;ibus (ubi et frequens e&s;t</HI>) um|bulu
<HI>dictus.</HI>&endq; If by <HI>Congen&s;ibus</HI> Marcgrave
meant the natives of Congo, the inference of
Kolbe and De&s;marchais, that the great ant-eater
was found in Africa, would have been ju&s;t. But
Marcgrave certainly never &s;aw this animal in A|frica,

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT
THE GREAT ANT-EATER.</HEAD>
<P>Dr Maudhuit, a learned naturali&s;t and phy&s;ician,
has &s;ent us from Guiana a well pre&s;erved &s;pe|cimen
<PB N="348" REF="410">
of the great ant-eater, which, though pre|ci&s;ely
the &s;ame &s;pecies with that formerly de|&s;cribed,
has a &s;horter muzzle. The di&s;tance be|tween
the eye and ear is likewi&s;e le&s;s, and the
feet are &s;horter. On the fore feet there are four
claws; the two middlemo&s;t being very large,
and the two outermo&s;t very &s;mall. The hind
feet have five black claws. The muzzle, as
far as the ears, is covered with &s;hort brown hair.
About the ears, the hair begins to grow longer;
upon the &s;ides of the body, it is two inches and
a half in length, and as hard to the touch as that
of the wild boar. The colour of the hairs is a
mixture of deep brown and a dirty white. This
animal is three feet eleven inches long.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde, King's phy&s;ician at Cayenne,
has communicated the following ob&s;ervations re|garding
this animal.</P>
<P>&startq;The ant-eater inhabits the woods of Gui|ana,
where there are two &s;pecies. The indi|viduals
of the large&s;t kind &s;ometimes weigh
one hundred pounds. They run more &s;lowly
and &s;luggi&s;hly than the hog. They &s;wim a|cro&s;s
large rivers; and, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, it is
ea&s;y to knock them down with a &s;tick. In the
woods, they are &s;hot with mu&s;kets. They are
not very common; and the dogs refu&s;e to hunt
them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The great ant-eater tears up with his claws
the ne&s;ts of the wood-lice, that are every where
to be found on the trees, which he climbs with
ea&s;e. It is dangerous to come near this ani|mal;
<PB N="349" REF="411">
for his claws inflict the mo&s;t dreadful
wounds. He defends him&s;elf with &s;ucce&s;s a|gain&s;t
the mo&s;t ferocious animals of this Con|tinent,
as the jaguars, couguars, &amp;c. whom he
tears with his claws, the mu&s;cles and tendons of
which are very &s;trong. He kills many dogs;
and therefore they refu&s;e to hunt him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The great ant-eater is often &s;een in the large
uncultivated &s;avannahs. He is &s;aid to feed up|on
ants. In his &s;tomach, which is larger than
that of a man, I found a va&s;t number of wood|lice,
that had been recently &s;wallowed. The
&s;tructure and dimen&s;ions of his tongue &s;eem to
indicate, that he may likewi&s;e feed upon ants.
The female brings forth but one young, in
holes of trees, near the root; and, at this pe|riod,
&s;he is dangerous even to men. The fle&s;h
of this animal is eaten by the common people
of Cayenne; it is black, and has neither fat
nor flavour. His &s;kin is thick and hard; and
his tongue is nearly of the &s;ame conical form
with his muzzle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The great ant-eater,&endq; continues M. de la
Borde, &startq;acquires not his full growth in le&s;s than
four years. His re&s;piration is performed &s;ole|ly
by the no&s;trils. At the fir&s;t vertebra which
joins the neck to the head, the wind-pipe is
very large; but it &s;uddenly contracts, and
forms a canal, which is continued, in the horn
or trunk that &s;erves the animal for an upper
jaw, to the no&s;trils. This horn is a foot in
<PB N="350" REF="412">
length, being as long, at lea&s;t, as the re&s;t of the
head. The wind-pipe has no opening into
the mouth; and yet the aperture of the no&s;trils
is &s;o &s;mall, as hardly to admit a common quill.
The eyes are very &s;mall, and the animal &s;ees
at a &s;ide only. His fat is extremely white.
When he cro&s;&s;es rivers, he carries his long tail
on his back.&endq;</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs Aublet and Olivier a&s;&s;ure me, that the
great ant-eater feeds by means of his tongue
only, which is covered with a vi&s;cid humour, to
which the in&s;ects adhere. They add, that his
fle&s;h is not bad.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>THE MIDDLE ANT-EATER.</HEAD>
<P>The animal here repre&s;ented, the &s;kin of
which is well pre&s;erved in the royal cabinet, be|longs
to the &s;pecies of <HI>Tamandua</HI> or middle ant-eater.
It differs from the <HI>tamanoir,</HI> or great
ant-eater, not only in &s;ize, but in figure. Its
head is proportionally much thicker. The eye
is &s;o &s;mall that it exceeds not a line in breadth.
The ears are round, and fringed above with large
black hairs. The body, from the tip of the no&s;e
to the origin of the tail, is thirteen inches long,
and ten inches high. The hair on the top of
the back is fifteen lines long, and that on the
belly, which is of a dirty white colour, is of an
<PB N="351" REF="413">
equal length. The tail, which is only &s;even
inches and a half long, is wholly covered with
long yellow hair, and variegated with bands or
rings &s;lightly tinged with black.</P>
<P>In all this de&s;cription, there are only two cha|racters
which accord not with that given of the
tamandua by Marcgrave. 1. The tail is all gar|ni&s;hed
with hair; but that of Marcgrave was
naked at the extremity. 2. In our tamandua,
there are five toes on the fore-feet; in that of
Marcgrave there were only four. But, as they
agree in every other article, we mu&s;t conclude
the animal, who&s;e figure is here repre&s;ented, to
be a variety of the tamandua, or middle ant-eater,
if not preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;pecies.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde &s;eems to point out this ani|mal
under the name of the <HI>little tamanoir.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;It has,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;whiti&s;h hair, about two
inches long, and weighs above &s;ixty pounds.
It has no teeth; but its claws are very long.
Like the former, it feeds during the night, and
the female brings forth but one at a time. Its
manners are al&s;o the &s;ame, and it frequents the
large fore&s;ts. Its fle&s;h is very good; but it is
more rarely to be met with than the great ta|manoir.&endq;</P>
<P>I wi&s;h M. de la Borde had given a more par|ticular
account of this animal, that all uncertain|ty
with regard to its &s;pecies might have been re|moved.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="352" REF="414">
<HEAD>THE LEAST ANT-EATER.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to this animal, M. de la Borde,
at the &s;ame time, &s;ent me the following remarks.</P>
<P>&startq;It has bright reddi&s;h hair, and &s;omewhat of
a golden colour. It feeds upon ants, which
adhere to its long worm-&s;haped tongue. This
animal is not larger than a &s;quirrel. It moves
&s;lowly, and is ea&s;ily taken. Like the &s;loth, it
fixes it&s;elf to a &s;taff; and, as it has no de&s;ire to
di&s;engage it&s;elf, it may be carried in this man|ner
wherever we plea&s;e. It has no cry. We
often find the&s;e animals adhering to branches
by their claws. The females bring forth only
one at a time in holes of trees, which they line
with leaves. They feed only in the night.
Their claws are very dangerous; and they
cla&s;p them &s;o clo&s;e, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to loo&s;e
them. They are not rare; but it is difficult to
perceive them on the trees.&endq;</P>
<P>M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r has made a very erroneous cri|tici&s;m
on what I have &s;aid concerning the lea&s;t
ant-eater<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De&s;cript. d'un grand ecureuil volant, p. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t remark,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;though contrary to
the opinion of M. de Buffon, (&s;ee above, p. 349.)
that la&s;t year M. Tulbagh &s;ent me an animal,

and Kolbe were right in maintaining that
this animal was found in Africa, as well as in
&startq;America. If we form a judgment from the
&s;pecimen &s;ent me, which is pre&s;erved in &s;pirit
of wine, appears to be new born, and is as large
as a good pig, we mu&s;t conclude the full grown
animal to be of a con&s;iderable &s;ize. The fol|lowing
are its principal characters, as far as
they could be remarked in an animal &s;o young.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The muzzle is pretty broad at the point,
round, and &s;omewhat compre&s;&s;ed above. The
ears are very broad, long, thin, pointed, and
pendulous. On the fore feet there are four
toes; the fir&s;t and third are of equal length,
the &s;econd &s;owewhat longer, and the fourth or
exterior one a little &s;horter than the third.
The four claws are very long, a little hooked,
&s;harp, and nearly of an equal &s;ize. On the
hind feet there are &s;ive toes, the three inter|mediate
ones being nearly equal in length,
and the two exterior much &s;horter; the claws
are &s;maller, and the two exterior ones are
lea&s;t. The tail, without being long, is thick,
and terminates in a point. The two <HI>Myr|mecophagi</HI>
of Seba, tom. 1. tab. 37. fig. 2.
and tab. 40. fig. 1. are certainly the &s;ame,
and differ only in colour; and the figures gi|ven
of them are good. This is a particular
&s;pecies, totally different from the <HI>tamandua|guacu</HI>
of Marcgrave, or the <HI>tamanoir</HI> of M.
de Buffon.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="419">
From this pa&s;&s;age, it might be thought that
I was deceived with regard to the animal repre|&s;ented
by Seba, tab. 37. fig. 2. However, I
have &s;aid preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing with M.
Vo&s;ma&euml;r; for I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the follow|ing
words &startq;The animal called <HI>Tamandua, mur|mecophage
d'Amerique,</HI> by Seba, tom. 1. p. 60.
tab. 37. fig. 2. has no re&s;emblance to any of
the three of which we are here treating.&endq; Now,
the three American animals which I mentioned
were the great, middle, and lea&s;t ant-eaters.
What M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r remarks, therefore, contra|dicts
nothing I have advanced; which amounts
to this, that the&s;e three animals are peculiar
to America, and not to be found in the Old
Continent. This language is &s;o preci&s;e, that
M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r can have nothing to oppo&s;e to it.
If the <HI>Myrmecophagus</HI> of Seba, tab. 37. fig. 2.
is found in Africa, it only proves that Seba was
deceived when he calls it the American <HI>Myrme|cophagus,</HI>
but can have no effect upon what I
have advanced, and &s;till per&s;i&s;t in mantaining,
that the three ant-eaters are found in America,

<P>All lizards are entirely covered with a &s;mooth
&s;kin, variegated with &s;pots which re&s;emble &s;cales.
But the &s;hort and long tailed manis have no
&s;cales on the throat, brea&s;t, and belly. The
long-tailed manis, like other quadrupeds, has
hair on all the inferior parts of the body; and
the &s;hort-tailed manis has, on the&s;e parts, only
a &s;mooth &s;kin without hair. The &s;cales which
cover the other parts of both the&s;e animals
adhere not entirely to the &s;kin, but are &s;trongly
fixed by their under part only. Like the quills
<PB N="357" REF="422">
of the porcupine, they are moveable, and are
elevated or depre&s;&s;ed, according to the will of
the animals. When irritated, they erect their
&s;cales, and particularly when they roll them&s;elves
up like a ball. The&s;e &s;cales are &s;o large, hard,
and poignant, that they repel every animal of
prey. They form an armour which wounds
as well as re&s;i&s;ts. The mo&s;t cruel and fami&s;h|ed
creatures, as the tiger, panther, &amp;c. endea|vour
in vain to devour the&s;e animals. They
trample upon, and to&s;s them about; but, when|ever
they attempt to &s;eize them, they receive ve|ry
dangerous and painful wounds. No animal
of prey is able to face, cru&s;h, or &s;uffocate them,
although it loads them with its whole weight.
The fox is afraid of the hedgehog when rol|led
up; but he forces it to extend, by tram|pling
on it with his feet. As &s;oon as the head
appears, he &s;eizes it by the &s;nout, and thus ac|compli&s;hes
his purpo&s;e. But, of all animals,
without excepting the porcupine, the armour of
the manis is the mo&s;t offen&s;ive. When the&s;e a|nimals
contract their bodies, and pre&s;ent their
arms, they brave the fury of all their enemies.
Be&s;ides, when rolled up, the&s;e animals a&s;&s;ume
not, like the hedgehog, a globular figure:
Their body, in contracting, takes the form of a
clue; but their long thick tail remains without,
and &s;erves as a ring or belt to the body. This
exterior part, by which it would appear the a|nimals
might be &s;eized, defends it&s;elf; for it is
<PB N="358" REF="423">
furni&s;hed, both above and below, with &s;cales as
hard and &s;harp as tho&s;e which cover the body;
and, as it is convex above and flat below, and
has nearly the figure of a half pyramid, the an|gular
&s;ides are covered with &s;harp erected &s;cales;
&s;o that the tail &s;eems to be &s;till more carefully
defended than the body, the inferior parts of
which are deprived of &s;cales.</P>
<P>The &s;hort tailed manis is larger than the long
tailed kind. His fore feet are covered with
&s;cales to their extremity; but the feet of the
long tailed &s;pecies, and even a part of the fore
legs, are only covered with hair. The &s;cales of
the former are larger, thicker, more convex, and
le&s;s chamfered than tho&s;e of the latter, which
are armed with three &s;harp points, while tho&s;e
of the &s;hort tailed manis are not pointed, but
uniformly &s;harp. The long tailed manis has
hair on the inferior parts of the body: The &s;hort
tailed kind has no hair under the body; but,
between the &s;cales which cover the back, there
are &s;ome hairs as thick and long as hogs bri&s;tles,
which are wanting in the long tailed &s;pecies.
The&s;e are all the e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinctions that we
have ob&s;erved from examining the &s;tuffed &s;kins
of both the&s;e animals, which differ &s;o much
from all other quadrupeds, that they have been
regarded as a kind of mon&s;ters. The differences
we have pointed out, being general and con&s;tant,
authori&s;e us to conclude the &s;hort and long tailed
manis to be di&s;tinct &s;pecies. We recogni&s;ed
<PB N="359" REF="424">
the&s;e relations and di&s;crepances not only by in|&s;pecting
three &s;ubjects, but likewi&s;e by peru&s;ing
all the remarks of travellers and naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;hort tailed manis, when full grown, is
from &s;ix to eight feet long, including the tail,
which is nearly the length of the body, but ap|pears
to be proportionally &s;horter while the ani|mal
is young; the &s;cales are al&s;o &s;maller and
thinner, and of a paler colour; but, in the adult
animal, their colour becomes deeper, and they
acquire &s;uch a degree of hardne&s;s as to re&s;i&s;t a
mu&s;ket ball. The long tailed manis, as former|ly
remarked, is much le&s;s than the &s;hort tailed
&s;pecies. Both of them have &s;ome relation to the
great and middle ant-eaters; for they feed upon
ants, have very long tongues, a narrow mouth,
without any apparent teeth, very long bodies
and tails, feet and toes nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize
and figure, though different in number, both &s;pe|cies
of manis having five toes to each foot, while
the ant-eaters have only four on the fore feet.
The latter are covered with hair, and the former
with &s;cales; neither are they natives of the &s;ame
Continent. The ant-eaters are found only in
America, and the two &s;pecies of manis in the
Ea&s;t Indies and Africa, where they are called

It is perpetually chaced, and ea&s;ily overtaken, by the tigers and leopards But, as its claws and mouth would be a feeble defence again&s;t the dreadful tu&s;ks and talons of the&s;e animals, Nature has taught it to roll it&s;elf up like a ball, by folding its tail under the belly, and contracting its body in &s;uch a manner as to pre&s;ent on all &s;ides the &s;harp points of its &s;cales. The tiger or leopard, when they turn the creature too rude|ly with their paws, receive &s;uch wounds as oblige them to re|tire. The Negroes kill it with battons, &s;ell the &s;kin to the Whites, and eat the fle&s;h, which they &s;ay is white and deli|cate. Its tongue is enormou&s;ly long, and covered with a vi&s;|cid liquor. It goes in que&s;t of ants ne&s;ts, and the haunts of in&s;ects; extends its tongue, which it either pu&s;hes into their holes, or lays it flat upon the places where they pa&s;s. The&s;e in&s;ects, attracted by the odour, quickly run toward the tongue, remain entangled in the vi&s;cid liquor; and, when the tongue is properly loaded with them, the animal retracts it, and devours them. This creature is not mi&s;chievous. He never attacks any per&s;on, but, provided he can find a &s;uffi|cient quantity of ants, is perfectly contented. The large&s;t of this &s;pecies that has been ob&s;erved, is eight feet long, com|prehending the tail, which is four feet; <HI>Voyage de De&s;marchais, tom. 1. p.</HI> 200.</NOTE> by the Negroes, who eat the fle&s;h of the&s;e

In fine, the&s;e creatures have nothing di&s;gu&s;ting
about them but their figure. They are gentle

run &s;lowly, and cannot e&s;cape from a man, but
by concealing them&s;elves in holes of rocks, or in
tho&s;e they dig in the earth, where the females
bring forth their young. They are two extra|ordinary

<PB REF="426">
<HEAD>THE ARMADILLO.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a quadruped is mentioned, the
very name &s;eems to convey the idea of
an animal covered with hair. In the &s;ame man|ner,
when we &s;peak of a bird or a fi&s;h, feathers
and &s;cales pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the imagination,
and appear to be in&s;eparable attributes of the&s;e
beings. Nature, however, as if &s;he intended to
withdraw her&s;elf from all method, and to elude
our mo&s;t general views, contradicts our ideas and
denominations, knows not our arbitrary charac|ters,
and a&s;toni&s;hes us &s;till more by her excep|tions
than by her laws. Quadrupeds, which
&s;hould be regarded as con&s;tituting the fir&s;t cla&s;s
of animated nature, and are, next to man, the
mo&s;t con&s;picuous creatures in this world, are,
neverthele&s;s, neither &s;uperior in every re&s;pect,
nor &s;eparated, by permanent characters or attri|butes,
from all other beings. The fir&s;t charac|ter,
that of having four feet, and from which
their name is derived, is found among the lizards,
frogs, &amp;c. who differ &s;o much from quadrupeds
in every other article, that they have, with pro|priety,
been thrown into a di&s;tinct cla&s;s. The
&s;econd general property, that of being vivipa|rous,
belongs not exclu&s;ively to quadrupeds, but
is common to them and the cetaceous animals.
<PB N="362" REF="427">
In fine, the third attribute, that of being covered
with hair, which appears to be the le&s;s equivo|cal,
becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, exi&s;ts not
in &s;everal &s;pecies which cannot be retrenched
from the order of quadrupeds, &s;ince, with the
exception of this character alone, their re&s;em|blance
to each other is complete: And, as the&s;e
&s;eeming exceptions of Nature are, in reality, but
the &s;hades &s;he employs to connect beings of the
mo&s;t remote kinds, we ought to feize the&s;e &s;in|gular
relations as often as they pre&s;ent them|&s;elves.
The armadillos, in&s;tead of hair, are co|vered,
like the turtles, the lob&s;ters, &amp;c. with a
&s;olid cru&s;t. The manis is armed with &s;cales &s;i|milar
to tho&s;e of fi&s;hes. The porcupine carries
a kind of prickly feathers, without vanes, but
having quills like tho&s;e of birds. thus, in the
cla&s;s of quadrupeds alone, and in the mo&s;t con|&s;tant
and apparent character of the&s;e animals,
that of being covered with hair, Nature varies,
by making them approach the three very diffe|rent
cla&s;&s;es of birds, fi&s;hes, and the cru&s;taceous
tribes. Hence we ought never to judge of the
nature of beings by a &s;ingle character; for it will
always be imperfect and fallacious. Even two
or three characters, though extremely general,
are often in&s;ufficient; and, as I have frequently
remarked, it is only by the union of all the at|tributes,
and an enumeration of all the charac|ters,
that a judgment can be formed concerning
the permanent and e&s;&s;ential qualities of the pro|ductions
<PB N="363" REF="428">
of Nature. Accurate de&s;criptions, with|out
any attempt toward definitions, a more &s;cru|pulous
examination of the di&s;crepances than of
the &s;imilarities, a particular attention to the ex|ceptions,
and even to the &s;lighte&s;t &s;hades, are the
true guides, and, I will venture to affirm, the
only means we po&s;&s;e&s;s of inve&s;tigating Nature.
If the time lo&s;t in framing definitions and me|thodical
arrangements, had been employed in
making good de&s;criptions, we &s;hould not, at this
day, have found Natural Hi&s;tory in her infancy,
but would have had le&s;s difficulty in removing
her &s;waddling cloths and her toys, and, per|haps,
might have advanced her age; for we
would have written more for &s;cience, and le&s;s
again&s;t error.</P>
<P>But to return to our &s;ubject. Among vivipa|rous
quadrupeds, as we have &s;een, there are &s;e|veral
&s;pecies of animals which are not covered
with hair. The armadillos alone con&s;titute an
entire genus, which includes a number of di&s;tinct
&s;pecies, and all of them are covered with a cru&s;t
re&s;embling bone. This cru&s;t covers the head,
neck, back, flanks, rump, and extends to the ex|tremity
of the tail. The cru&s;t it&s;elf is al&s;o co|vered
with a thin, &s;mooth, tran&s;parent &s;kin. The
only parts to which this cru&s;t extends not, are
the throat, the brea&s;t, and the belly, which are
covered with a granulated &s;kin, like that of a
deplumed hen; and, upon an accurate in&s;pec|tion
of the&s;e parts, we di&s;cover, in different
<PB N="364" REF="429">
places, the rudiments of &s;cales, of the &s;ame &s;ub|&s;tance
with the cru&s;t. Hence the &s;kin of the&s;e
animals, even where it is mo&s;t flexible, has a
tendency to become o&s;&s;eous; but the o&s;&s;ification
is only completed in tho&s;e places where the &s;kin
is thicke&s;t, as on the &s;uperior and external parts
of the body, and on the limbs. The cru&s;t con|&s;i&s;ts
not of one piece, like that of the turtle, but
is divided into &s;everal bands, connected to each
other by membranes, which allow a certain de|gree
of movement to this coat of mail. The
number of the&s;e bands depends not, as has been
imagined, on the age of the animal. The new
born and the adult armadillo have the &s;ame
number of bands, as appears by comparing the
young with the old; and, though we cannot be
certain that tho&s;e which have more or fewer
bands never intermix or produce, it is at lea&s;t
very probable, &s;ince the difference in the number
of moveable bands is con&s;tant, that they are
either di&s;tinct &s;pecies, or permanent varieties,
occa&s;ioned by the influence of different climates.
In this uncertainty, which time alone can re|move,
we have cho&s;en to treat of all the arma|dillos
under one article, enumerating, at the
&s;ame time, each kind as if it were a particular
&s;pecies.</P>

or <HI>cachichame.</HI> The different &s;pecies
have been confounded by other travellers. But
we have occa&s;ion to borrow the de&s;criptions of
two kinds only, having &s;een the other four.</P>
<P>All the armadillos, excepting the eighteen-banded,
have two bony &s;hields, one on the
&s;houlders, another on the rump. Each of the&s;e
con&s;i&s;ts of one &s;olid piece. But the cuira&s;s, which
is likewi&s;e o&s;&s;eous, and covers the body, is di|vided
tran&s;ver&s;ely into more or fewer moveable
bands, connected by a flexible &s;kin. But the
armadillo with eighteen bands has only one
&s;hield, which is upon his &s;houlders. The rump,
in&s;tead of a &s;hield, is covered with moveable
bands, &s;imilar to tho&s;e above mentioned. We
&s;hall now de&s;cribe each &s;pecies particularly, ac|cording

<P>Clu&s;ius is the fir&s;t author who de&s;cribed this
animal; and, though his de&s;cription was taken
from a drawing only, it is ea&s;y to perceive, from
the remarkable characters of having three move|able
bands on the back and a &s;hort tail, that it
is the &s;ame &s;pecies of which Marcgrave has gi|ven
a good de&s;cription under the name of <HI>Tatu
apara.</HI> The head is oblong and almo&s;t pyra|midal;
the eyes are &s;mall, the ears &s;hort and
rounded, and the top of the head is covered with
a helmet con&s;i&s;ting of one piece. On all the
feet there are five toes. The two middle claws
of the fore feet are very large, the two lateral
<PB N="367" REF="432">
ones &s;maller, and the fifth, or exterior one, is
the lea&s;t. The claws of the hind feet are &s;horter
and more equal. The tail exceeds not two
inches in length, and is wholly covered with a
&s;hell or cru&s;t. The body is a foot long, and about
eight inches over at the broade&s;t part. The
back, or cuira&s;s, is divided into four joints, and
compo&s;ed of three tran&s;ver&s;e moveable bands, by
which the animal is enabled to bend its body
and to roll it&s;elf up like a ball. The &s;kin which
forms the joints is very flexible. The &s;hields
which cover the &s;houlders and rump con&s;i&s;t of
pentangular pieces, very equally ranged. The
three moveable bands between the two &s;hields
are compo&s;ed of &s;quare or oblong pieces, and on
each piece there is a number of lenticular &s;cales
of a yellowi&s;h white colour. Marcgrave adds, that,
when the creature lies down to &s;leep, or when
touched by any per&s;on, he gathers his feet to|gether,
puts his head below his belly, and makes
the whole body &s;o perfectly round, that he has
more the appearance of a &s;ea-&s;hell than of a
land animal. This contraction is effected by
means of two large mu&s;cles on the &s;ides of the
body; and it is with difficulty that the &s;tronge&s;t
man can force an exten&s;ion with his hands.
Pi&s;o and Ray have added nothing to Marc|grave's
de&s;cription. But it is &s;ingular, that Seba,
who has given a figure and de&s;cription nearly
the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Marcgrave, &s;hould not on|ly
not mention this author, but a&s;&s;ert, with confi|dence,
<PB N="368" REF="433">
&startq;that this animal is unknown to the na|turali&s;ts;
that it is extremely rare; that it is

it is very frequent. The only real difference
between the de&s;cription of Seba and that of
Marcgrave is, that the latter gives the animal
five toes to each foot, and the former only four.
One of them mu&s;t be wrong; for they both e|vidently

muzzle is &s;harp, the eyes &s;mall and &s;unk, and
the tongue narrow and pointed. The ears,
which are naked, having neither hair nor cru&s;t,
are &s;hort and brown like the &s;kin of the dor&s;al
junctures. There are eighteen teeth in each jaw,
and five toes on each foot, with pretty long,
rounded, and rather narrow than broad claws.
The head and muzzle nearly re&s;emble tho&s;e of a
pig. The tail is thick at its origin, and gradual|ly
tapers toward the point, where it is very thin,
and rounded. The colour of the body is a red|di&s;h
yellow. The animal is commonly plump
and fat; and the penis of the male is very con|&s;picuous.
He digs the earth with great ea&s;e by
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;nout and his claws. He

<P>Nieremberg's de&s;cription of this animal is ex|tremely
imperfect; that of Wormius and Grew
is much better. Wormius's individual was an
<PB N="374" REF="441">
adult, and one of the large&s;t of the &s;pecies; that
of Grew was younger and &s;maller. We &s;hall
only give their de&s;criptions as far as they corre|&s;pond
with our own &s;pecimen. Be&s;ides, it is
probable that the nine-banded armadillo is not
a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from the eight-banded; for, in
every other re&s;pect, they &s;eem to have a perfect
re&s;emblance to each other. We have two eight|banded
armadillos, which are dried, and appear
to be males; and we have &s;even or eight with
nine bands; one of them, which is entire, is
a female, the others are &s;o di&s;figured in drying,
that the &s;ex is not di&s;tingui&s;hable. It would ap|pear,
therefore, that the eight-banded is the male,
and the nine-banded the female. This is only
a conjecture, which I mention here, becau&s;e,
in the following article, we &s;hall &s;ee two arma|dillos,
one of which has more rows on the rump|&s;hield
than the other, and yet their re&s;emblance
is &s;o great, that this difference may depend &s;ole|ly
on &s;ex; for it is not improbable, that a great|er
number of rows and of moveable bands may
be nece&s;&s;ary for facilitating the ge&s;tation and de|livery
of the females.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="442">
In the individual de&s;cribed by Wormius, the
head was five inches long, from the end of the
muzzle to the ears, and eighteen inches from
the ears to the origin of the tail, which la&s;t was
a foot in length, and compo&s;ed of twelve rings.
In an individual of the &s;ame &s;pecies de&s;cribed
by Grew, the head was three inches, the body
&s;even and a half, and the tail eleven. The
proportions of the head and body corre&s;pond
very well; but the difference in the tail is too
con&s;iderable; and, it is probable, that, in Wor|mius's
individual, the tail had been broken, for
it ought to have exceeded a foot in length. As
in this &s;pecies the tail tapers to a point as &s;mall
as an awl, and is at the &s;ame time very brittle,
it is rare to pre&s;erve a &s;pecimen with the tail
entire, as in that de&s;cribed by Grew.</P>

<P>This animal &s;eems to be the large&s;t of the
armadillo kind. Its head is thicker and broad|er,
and its muzzle not &s;o &s;lender as tho&s;e of
<PB N="376" REF="443">
the other &s;pecies. The legs and feet are al&s;o
thicker, and the tail has no cru&s;t, a peculiarity
which &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hes it from all the o|thers.
It has five toes on all the feet, and
twelve di&s;tinct moveable bands. The &s;hield on
the &s;houlders con&s;i&s;ts only of four or five rows,
each of which is compo&s;ed of pretty large qua|drangular
pieces. The moveable bands are like|wi&s;e
compo&s;ed of large and almo&s;t &s;quare pieces.
Tho&s;e which compo&s;e the rump &s;hield are nearly
&s;imilar to tho&s;e on the &s;houlders. The helmet
on the head con&s;i&s;ts of large, irregular pieces.
Between the joints of the moveable bands, and
in other parts of the armour, there are &s;ome
hairs, like hog's bri&s;tles. Upon the brea&s;t, bel|ly,
legs, and tail, we perceive the rudiments of
&s;cales, which are round, hard, and poli&s;hed, like
the re&s;t of the cru&s;t, and, round the&s;e, are &s;mall
tufts of hair. The pieces which compo&s;e the
helmet, the two &s;hields, and the cuira&s;s, being
proportionably larger and fewer in number in
the twelve banded than in the other armadillos,
entitle us to conclude that it is the large&s;t of the
<PB N="377" REF="444">
kind. In that repre&s;ented in the figure, the head
was &s;even inches long, and the body twenty-one.
But we are uncertain whether that repre&s;ented
in the former plate belongs to the &s;ame &s;pecies.
They are &s;imilar in many re&s;pects, particularly
in having twelve moveable bands. But they
likewi&s;e differ in &s;o many articles, that it is per|haps
ra&s;h to a&s;cribe the&s;e differences to &s;ex alone.</P>

<P>Mr Grew fir&s;t de&s;cribed this animal from a
&s;kin pre&s;erved in the cabinet of the Royal Society.
All the other armadillos have two &s;hields, one
on the &s;houlders, and another on the rump.
But the eighteen banded &s;pecies has only one
&s;hield, which is upon the &s;houlders. It has ob|tained
the name of the <HI>wea&s;el armadillo,</HI> becau&s;e
<PB N="378" REF="445">
its head re&s;embles that of the wea&s;el. From
Grew's de&s;cription of this animal, we find that
the body was about ten inches long, the head
three, and the tail five. The legs were from
two to three inches in length; the forehead was
large and flat; the eyes were &s;mall, and the
ears an inch long. It had five toes on each foot,
and large claws, of an inch long, on the three
middle toes, the others being &s;maller. The ar|mour
of the head and that of the legs were
compo&s;ed of round &s;cales, about a quarter of an
inch in diameter. The armour of the neck con|&s;i&s;ted
of one piece, formed of &s;mall &s;quare &s;cales.
The &s;hield on the &s;houlders con&s;i&s;ted al&s;o of one
piece, compo&s;ed of &s;everal rows of &s;imilar &s;mall
&s;quare &s;cales. The&s;e rows on the &s;hield, in this as
well as all the other &s;pecies, are continuous, and
adhere by a &s;ymphy&s;is. The re&s;t of the body,
from the &s;hield on the &s;houlders to the tail, is
covered with moveable bands &s;eparated from
each other by a flexible &s;kin. The&s;e bands are
eighteen in number. The anterior ones are
large&s;t, and compo&s;ed of &s;mall &s;quare and ob|long
pieces. The po&s;terior con&s;i&s;t of round and
&s;quare pieces; and the extremity of the armour,
near the tail, is of a parabolic figure. The fir&s;t
half of the tail is covered with &s;ix rings, com|po&s;ed
of &s;mall &s;quare pieces; and the &s;econd
half, as far as the point, is covered with irregular
&s;cales. The brea&s;t, the belly, and the ears, are
naked, as in the other &s;pecies. Of all the ar|madillos,
<PB N="379" REF="446">
from the moveable bands which ex|tend
to the tail, it would appear that this &s;pecies
has the power of contracting and rolling it&s;elf
up like a ball with the greate&s;t ea&s;e.</P>
<P>We have taken this de&s;cription, as well as Mr
Ray, from Grew. M. Bri&s;&s;on has al&s;o follow|ed
Mr Ray, and given a good de&s;cription of this
animal, which he calls &s;imply the <HI>armadillo.</HI>
But it is &s;ingular, that Linnaeus, though he had
the de&s;criptions of Grew and Ray before his
eyes, &s;hould mention this &s;ame animal as ha|ving
but one band<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Da&s;ypus unicintus, tegmine tripartito, pedibus pentadac|$ylis; <HI>Linn. &s;y&s;t. nat. p.</HI> 53.</NOTE>, when it has no le&s;s than
eighteen. This notion proceeds from a blun|der
as evident as that of mi&s;taking the <HI>tatu
&s;eu armadillo Africanus</HI> of Seba, for the <HI>tatu
mu&s;telinus</HI> of Grew, which, even from the de|&s;cription
of the&s;e authors, are very different a|nimals.
It is equally certain that the animal
de&s;cribed by Grew is a real exi&s;ting &s;pecies, as
the exi&s;tence of that of Seba, at lea&s;t as he de|de&s;cribes
it, is doubtful. According to him, this
African armadillo has the whole armour of its
body divided into three parts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Scutum o&s;&s;eum toto incumbens corpori tripartitum e&s;t; <HI>Seba, tom. 1. p.</HI> 47.</NOTE>. If this were
the ca&s;e, in&s;tead of many bands, the back and
&s;ides would be covered with one piece bounded
by the &s;hields on the &s;houlders and rump. This
pa&s;&s;age is the foundation of Linnaeus's error,
<PB N="380" REF="447">
who calls the animal <HI>Da&s;ypus unicinctus, tegmine
tripartito.</HI></P>
<P>All the armadillos are natives of America.
Before the di&s;covery of the New World, they
were totally unknown. They are never men|tioned
by the antients; modern travellers uni|formly
&s;peak of them as animals peculiar to
Mexico, Bra&s;il, Guiana, &amp;c. and no per&s;on e|ver
pretends to have &s;een any of the &s;pecies ei|ther
in A&s;ia or Africa. Some voyagers have
indeed confounded the armadillos of America
with the manis, or &s;caly lizard of the Ea&s;t In|dies.
Others have imagined that they exi&s;ted
on the We&s;t coa&s;ts of Africa, becau&s;e they have
&s;ometimes been tran&s;ported from Bra&s;il to Gui|ney.

<P>&startq;Nature has armed this creature with a hard cru&s;t and large &s;cales, like a cor&s;let, by which means the inwards and fle&s;h are ea&s;ily taken out, without injuring its natural figure.

It may he called the Bra&s;i$ian hedgehog; for it retires into its &s;cales, as a hedgehog does into its bri&s;tles. It exceeds not the &s;ize of a middling pig. It is indeed a &s;pecies of hog, having $$e &s;ame legs, feet, and muzzle.

found in the Ea&s;t Indies<NOTE N="&ast;&ast;&ast;" PLACE="foot">Cum in Occidentalis non &s;olum, &s;ed et Orientalis Indiae partibus frequens adeo &s;it hoc inu&s;itatae conformationis a|nimal, non mirum &s;i vel nomine, vel magnitudine, figura quoque &s;ubinde variet; <HI>Pi&s;on. hi&s;t. nat.

He has probably confounded the &s;caly
lizards with the armadillos. The former are called
<HI>armadillos</HI> by the Spaniards. This error has been
adopted by our nomenclators and de&s;cribers of
cabinets, who have not only admitted the arma|dillos
into the Ea&s;t Indies, but into Africa,
though none of them ever exi&s;ted in tho&s;e parts
<PB N="382" REF="449">
of the world, except &s;uch as were tran&s;ported
from America.</P>
<P>The climate and country of the&s;e animals,
therefore, are not equivocal: But it is more
difficult to determine the &s;ize of each kind.
With this view, we have compared the &s;kins of
a great number pre&s;erved in the royal and other
cabinets: We have al&s;o compared all the de&s;crip|tions
of authors with our own, without being
able to draw any certain conclu&s;ion. It only ap|pears,
that the twelve and &s;ix banded armadillos
are the large&s;t, and that the three, eight, nine, and
eighteen banded &s;pecies are the lea&s;t. The head
of the larger kinds is more &s;olid and harder than
that of the &s;maller; the pieces of which it is com|po&s;ed
are larger and fewer in number; the move|able
bands encroach le&s;s upon each other; and the
&s;kin and fle&s;h are harder and not &s;o good. Pi&s;o
&s;ays, that the fle&s;h of the &s;ix banded armadil|lo
is not eatable<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prima et maxima (<HI>&s;pecies</HI>) tatupeba, cujus de&s;criptioni &s;uper&s;edeo, utpote non edulis; <HI>Pi&s;on. bi&s;t. nat. Bra&s;il. p</HI> 100.</NOTE>; and Nieremberg a&s;&s;ures us

the twelve banded armadillo has a &s;trong odour
of mu&s;k. All authors agree, that the fle&s;h of
the three banded, and particularly that of the
eight banded &s;pecies, is as good as that of a pig.
<PB N="383" REF="450">
They likewi&s;e remark, that all the &s;mall kinds
frequent the plains and mar&s;hes; and that the
large&s;t &s;pecies are only found in dry and eleva|ted
places<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the woods of Oronook and Guiana, there are armadil|los four times larger than tho&s;e of the plains; <HI>Hi&s;t. nat. de l'Orenoque, par Gumilla, tom. 2. p.</HI> 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All the&s;e animals have the faculty of contrac|ting
their bodies in the form of a ball with
more or le&s;s facility. When contracted, the de|fect
of their armour is mo&s;t con&s;picuous in tho&s;e
which have fewe&s;t moveable bands. In this &s;i|tuation,
the three banded &s;pecies pre&s;ents two
large voids between the &s;hields and the armour
of the back. None of them can a&s;&s;ume a form
&s;o perfectly round as the hedgehog; they have
rather the figure of a globe very much flattened
at the poles.</P>
<P>The &s;ingular cru&s;t with which they are co|vered
is a real bone, compo&s;ed of &s;mall conti|guous
pieces, which, without being moveable
or articulated, except at the joints of the bands,
are united by a &s;ymphy&s;is, and may all be
&s;eparated from each other when heated in a
fire. When the animal is alive, the&s;e &s;mall
pieces, both in the &s;hields and moveable bands<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&startq;The nine-banded armadillo is very &s;en&s;ible. When his &s;cales are pre&s;&s;ed, he complains, and rolls him&s;elf up like a ball. I remarked, that all the rows, be&s;ide the movement by which they joint into each other, have another along the &s;pine of the back, which enables them to extend and enlarge them&s;elves,&endq; &amp;c.; <HI>Nouv. voy. aux i&s;les de l'Amerique, tom. 2. p.</HI> 388,</NOTE>,

that by which it contracts it&s;elf. If this were
not the ca&s;e, it could not po&s;&s;ibly roll it&s;elf up.
The&s;e pieces are of different figures in different
&s;pecies, and are always arranged with as much
regularity as the mo&s;t elegant mo&s;aic work. The
thin pellicle which covers the cru&s;t, is a tran&s;pa|rent
&s;kin, which has the effect of a varni&s;h to
the whole body. This &s;kin ri&s;es a good deal,
and even changes the reliefs of the mo&s;aic work,
which are very different when it is removed.
Be&s;ides, this o&s;&s;eous cru&s;t is only a cover, totally
independent of the internal parts of the animal's
body, who&s;e bones, and other organs, are con|&s;tructed
like tho&s;e of all other quadrupeds.</P>
<P>The armadillos, in general, are inoffen&s;ive a|nimals,
and do no mi&s;chief, unle&s;s they are allowed
to enter the gardens, where they eat melons, po|tatoes,
and other roots and pot-herbs. Though
natives of the warm climates of America, they
can live in temperate regions. Some years ago,
I &s;aw one in Languedoc, which was fed in the
hou&s;e, and went about freely without doing any
harm. They walk quickly; but they can nei|ther
run, nor leap, nor climb trees; &s;o that they
can never e&s;cape tho&s;e who pur&s;ue them. Their
only re&s;ources are to conceal them&s;elves in their
holes, or, if too di&s;tant from their retreats, to
endeavour to dig a hole before they are &s;eized;
for the mole digs not more quickly than the ar|madillo.
<PB N="385" REF="452">
Before being totally concealed, they
are &s;ometimes caught by the tail, when they
make &s;uch a powerful re&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The nine-banded armadillos, when their head and part of the body are concealed in the hole, believe them&s;elves to be &s;afe; and, indeed, they have nothing to fear, unle&s;s the fol|lowing expedient be u&s;ed to drag them out. The Indian ar|rives, and &s;eizes the animal by the tail, which is very long. The armadillo opens his &s;cales, and attaches them &s;o &s;trong|ly to the walls of his hole, that the Indian may pull off the tail, but cannot force the animal from his retreat. In this ca&s;e, the hunter tickles him with a &s;tick or the end of his bow, which makes the animal contract his &s;cales, and then he is taken without difficulty; <HI>Hi&s;t. nat. de l'Or&eacute;noque, par Gumilla, tom. 3. p.</HI> 226.</NOTE>, that the tail
is left in the hands of the enemy. To prevent
mutilating them in this manner, it is nece&s;&s;ary
to widen the holes, and then they are taken
without re&s;i&s;tance. Whenever they are &s;eized,
they roll them&s;elves up, and never extend till
they are placed near a fire. Their cru&s;t, though
hard and rigid, is &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that, when touched
by the finger, that animal feels the impre&s;&s;ion,
and in&s;tantly contracts it&s;elf. When their holes
are deep, they are forced out by &s;moke or by
water. They are &s;aid to remain in their holes
during a third part of the year<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. gen. des Antilles, par le P&egrave;re du Tertre, tom. 2. p. 298.</NOTE>. It is certain,
however, that they never come out but during
the night, when they go in que&s;t of food. The
armadillo is&punc; hunted with &s;mall dogs<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. nat. des Antilles, p. 123.</NOTE>, by whom
<PB N="386" REF="453">
they are &s;oon overtaken. They contract them|&s;elves
long before the dogs come up with them;
and in this &s;tate they are &s;eized and carried off.
When on the top of a precipice, they e&s;cape
both the dogs and the hunter; for they contract,
and allow them&s;elves to roll down like a bullet<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hernand&egrave;s, hi&s;t. Mexic. p. 314.</NOTE>,
without breaking their cru&s;t, or receiving any
injury.</P>
<P>The&s;e animals are fat, and very fruitful. The
male exhibits, by his external organs, great ge|nerative
powers. The female is &s;aid to produce
every four months<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toire naturelle de l'Or&eacute;noque, par Gumilla, p. 225.</NOTE>; and, accordingly, the &s;pe|cies
is very numerous. As they make excellent
eating, they are hunted in every manner. They
are ea&s;ily taken with &s;nares, that are laid on the
edges of waters and other moi&s;t places, which
they always frequent. They never remove far
from their holes, which are very deep, and which
they endeavour to regain upon every alarm.
They are &s;aid not to be afraid of the bite of the
rattle-&s;nake<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nieremberg, hi&s;t. nat. Peregr. p. 159.</NOTE>, though it is as dangerous as that
of the viper. It is &s;aid that they live in peace
with the&s;e reptiles, who are often found in their
holes. The &s;avages employ the cru&s;t of the ar|madillo
for &s;everal purpo&s;es. They paint it
with different colours, and make ba&s;kets, boxes,
and other &s;mall ve&s;&s;els of it. Monard, Xime|nes,
<PB N="387" REF="454">
and other writers, a&s;cribe great medicinal
powers to different parts of the&s;e animals. They
a&s;&s;ure us, that the cru&s;t, reduced to a powder,
and taken internally, even in a &s;mall do&s;e, is a
powerful &s;udorific; that the hip-bone, pulveri|&s;ed,
cures the venereal di&s;ea&s;e; that the fir&s;t
bone of the tail, applied to the ear, re&s;tores hear|ing
to the deaf, &amp;c. We can give no credit to
the&s;e extraordinary powers. The cru&s;t and
bones of the armadillo are of the &s;ame nature
with the bones of other animals. Effects &s;o
marvellous can only be produced by imaginary
virtues.</P>

<P>Our original figure of the &s;ix-banded armadil|lo
was taken from a pre&s;erved cru&s;t. The figure
now repre&s;ented was drawn from the life by M.
de S&eacute;ve, who, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent me the fol|lowing
de&s;cription.</P>
<P>&startq;The male is fourteen inches long, without
reckoning the tail, and corre&s;ponds pretty
well with the de&s;cription given in your work.
However, in your de&s;cription, it is &s;aid the
&s;houlder-&s;hield con&s;i&s;ts of five parallel rows of
&s;mall pentangular pieces, with an oval in each.
<PB N="388" REF="455">
But the&s;e characters &s;eem to vary; for, in the
animal I have drawn, the &s;houlder-&s;hield is
compo&s;ed of &s;ix parallel rows, of which the
&s;mall pieces are irregular hexagons. The
rump-&s;hield con&s;i&s;ts of ten parallel rows, and
the &s;mall pieces are narrow &s;quares. The
rows near the tail lo&s;e their &s;quare form, and
become more round. The tail, a part of which
was broken off, is four inches and a half in
length; but, in the drawing, I have made it
&s;ix inches. In walking, it carries the tail high,
and a little crooked. The trunk is covered
with an o&s;&s;euous cru&s;t as well as the body. The
trunk has &s;ix unequal rows, compo&s;ed of &s;mall
irregular hexagons. The head is three inches
ten lines long, and the ears one inch three
lines. The eye, in&s;tead of being &s;unk, as re|marked
in your hi&s;tory, is indeed very &s;mall,
but the globe is prominent, and well defended
by eye-lids. The body is very fat, and the
&s;kin of the belly is wrinkled, and full of &s;mall
tubercles, from which i&s;&s;ue a number of pretty
long white hairs. The cru&s;t, on the broade&s;t
part of the body, is &s;ix inches &s;even lines.
The fore legs are two inches two lines long,
and tho&s;e behind three inches four lines. The
fore claws are very long, the longe&s;t being one
inch three lines, the next one inch two lines,
and the &s;malle&s;t ten lines. The length of the
hind claws is at mo&s;t half an inch. The legs
<PB N="389" REF="456">
are covered, as far as the claws, with a yel|lowi&s;h
&s;caly &s;kin. When the animal walks,
he &s;upports him&s;elf on the tips of the claws of
the fore feet. His penis, when drawn out in
a &s;tate of repo&s;e, is &s;ix inches &s;even lines long,
near four lines thick, and mu&s;t augment con&s;i|derably
during its erection. When the penis
&s;tretches, it lies upon the belly like a &s;nail,
leaving a &s;pace of a line or two between each
circumvolution. I have been told, that, when
the&s;e animals copulate, the female lies on her
back to receive the male. The one I have
de&s;cribed was only eighteen months old.&endq;</P>
<P>M. de la Borde remarks, that there are two
&s;pecies of armadillos in Guiana. The large&s;t is
black, and weighs from eighteen to twenty
pounds. The other, which is brown, or rather
iron-coloured, has three claws of different lengths.
Its tail is &s;oft, and without any armour, being
covered with a &s;imple &s;kin. It is much &s;mal|ler
than the other, and weighs only about three
pounds.</P>
<P>&startq;The large armadillo,' &s;ays M. de la Borde,
brings forth eight, and &s;ometimes ten at a lit|ter,
in their holes, which they dig very deep.
When attempts are made to unkennel this ani|mal,
he labours hard to render the hole &s;till
deeper, and de&s;cends almo&s;t perpendicularly.
He goes out in the night only, and feeds up|on
worms, woodlice, and ants. His fle&s;h is
<PB N="390" REF="457">
good, and, in flavour, &s;omewhat re&s;embles that
of a pig. The &s;mall iron-coloured armadillo
brings forth only four or five young; but &s;he
digs &s;till deeper, and is more difficult to catch.
When it rains, the&s;e animals go out during
the day; but, in fair weather, they remain in
their holes till night. They are always &s;olitary;
and they are known to be in their holes by a
number of flies which follow their &s;cent. When
the hunter digs in order to &s;eize them, they
dig likewi&s;e; and, by throwing the earth be|hind,
&s;hut up the mouths of their holes &s;o
completely, that no &s;moke can enter. The
females bring forth in the beginning of the
rainy &s;ea&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>The large black armadillo of M. de la Borde
may be referred to the twelve-banded &s;pecies,
which is the large&s;t of all the armadillos; and
the &s;mall iron-coloured kind may be referred to
the eight-banded armadillo, though M. de la
Borde &s;ays, that its tail is naked, a fact which
merits confirmation.</P>
<P>We have given a figure of an armadillo with
nine moveable bands and a very long tail.

<HEAD>SUPPLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The de&s;cription of the &s;potted cavy given in
the la&s;t article was taken from a young &s;ubject,
which had not acquired one half of its full growth.
I have &s;ince had one &s;ent me, which, when it ar|rived,
was larger than the former, and, from
the month of Augu&s;t 1774, to the 28th day of
May 1775, during which period it was nouri&s;h|ed
in my hou&s;e, its &s;ize continued to augment.
I now proceed to give an account of its mode of
living and acting, from the remarks of the Sieur
Tr&eacute;court.</P>
<P>When provided with a wooden cage or box,
this animal remains perfectly tranquil during the
day, e&s;pecially when plentifully &s;upplied with
food. He &s;eems even to have an affection for
his retreat, as long as the day la&s;ts; for, after
feeding, he retires &s;pontaneou&s;ly into it. But,
when night approaches, by perpetual re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s
and agitation, and by tearing the bars of his pri|&s;on
with his teeth, he di&s;covers a violent de&s;ire
of getting out. Nothing of this kind happens
during the day, unle&s;s he has occa&s;ion for &s;ome
natural evacuation; for he cannot endure the
&s;malle&s;t degree of dirtine&s;s in his little apartment;
<PB N="396" REF="468">
and, when about to void his excrements, he al|ways
retires to the mo&s;t di&s;tant corner he can
find. When his &s;traw begins to &s;mell, he often
throws it out, as if he meant to demand fre&s;h
litter. This old &s;traw he pu&s;hes out with his
muzzle, and goes in que&s;t of rags or paper to re|place
it. But his attachment was not confined
to his cage. All ob&s;cure corners &s;eemed to be
agreeable to him; and he often formed a new
ne&s;t for him&s;elf in pre&s;&s;es which he found open,
or under the kitchen grate. Wherever he e|&s;tabli&s;hed
a new abode, nothing but force could
make him leave it. In this animal, which was
a female, the propen&s;ity to cleanline&s;s was &s;o
&s;trong, that, a large male rabbit being &s;hut up
with her when &s;he was in &s;ea&s;on, &s;he took an
aver&s;ion to him the moment he voided his ex|crement
in their common apartment. Before
this event, &s;he had received him &s;o cordially, that
&s;omething was expected; &s;he even made con|&s;iderable
advances, for &s;he licked his no&s;e, ears,
and body; and &s;he allowed him to take almo&s;t
the whole food which was given her. But, as
&s;oon as the rabbit had infected the cage with his
ordure, &s;he retired into the bottom of an old
pre&s;s, where &s;he made a bed of paper and rags,
and returned not to her old lodging till &s;he &s;aw
it neat, and freed from the unclean gue&s;t which
had been pre&s;ented to her.</P>
<P>The &s;potted cavy is ea&s;ily accu&s;tomed to a do|me&s;tic
life. Unle&s;s indu&s;triou&s;ly irritated, he is
<PB N="397" REF="469">
gentle and tractable. He is fond of adulation,
and licks the hands of the per&s;on who care&s;&s;es
him. He knows tho&s;e who take care of him,
and readily di&s;tingui&s;hes their voices. When
gently &s;troaked on the back, he &s;tretches him|&s;elf
out, lies down on his belly, by a &s;mall cry
expre&s;&s;es his acknowledgment, and &s;eems to a&s;k
a continuance of the favour. When &s;eized in
a rough manner, however, he makes very violent
efforts to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>His mu&s;cles are very large and &s;trong; and yet
his &s;kin is &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that the &s;lighte&s;t touch is &s;uf|ficient
to excite in him the mo&s;t lively emotions.
This great &s;en&s;ibility, though generally accom|panied
with &s;weetne&s;s of temper, produces &s;ome|times,
when too much irritated, or when a di&s;a|greeable
object is pre&s;ented, the mo&s;t violent
paroxy&s;ms of pa&s;&s;ion. The bare &s;ight of an
unkown dog is &s;ufficient to produce this effect
in the &s;potted cavy. When confined in his cage,
he has been ob&s;erved, upon the entrance of a
&s;trange dog into the chamber, to bite the door
and make an effort to open it. At fir&s;t, it was
believed that he never wi&s;hed to go out, unle&s;s
when pre&s;&s;ed by natural nece&s;&s;ities. But, when
at full liberty, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him dart
out &s;uddenly upon an innocent dog, which he
bit very &s;everely. In a few days, however, he
became familiar with this dog. People with
whom he is unacquainted, if they irritate him,
he treats in the &s;ame manner. But he never
<PB N="398" REF="470">
bites tho&s;e who have the care of him. He has
an aver&s;ion to children, whom he always pur|&s;ues.
His pa&s;&s;ion is expre&s;&s;ed by chattering his
teeth, and is always preceded by a kind of grunt|ing.</P>
<P>This animal &s;its often on his po&s;teriors, and
&s;ometimes remains long in this &s;ituation. He
has the air of combing his head and whi&s;kers
with his paws, which he continually licks and
moi&s;tens with his &s;aliva. In this operation, he
often u&s;es both paws at a time; he then &s;cratch|es
all the parts of his body which he can reach
with his fore-feet, and completes his dre&s;&s;ing
by &s;cratching with his hind paws &s;uch parts as
cannot be reached by the fore ones.</P>
<P>This animal, notwith&s;tanding, is gro&s;s and
corpulent. His body is neither delicate, nor
&s;mooth, nor nimble, but rather heavy and lurid,
having nearly the gait of a &s;mall hog. He runs
&s;eldom, and, when he does, it is always with a
bad grace. He has no vivacious movement, but
that of leaping upon the furniture, or upon &s;uch
things as he wi&s;hes to &s;eize and carry off. He
re&s;embles the hog &s;till farther in the whitene&s;s
and thickne&s;s of his &s;kin, which cannot be drawn
off, becau&s;e it adheres to the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Though our animal had not acquired his full
growth, he was eighteen inches long in his na|tural
contracted &s;ituation; but, when he extend|ed
him&s;elf, he was near two feet from the point
<PB N="399" REF="471">
of the muzzle to the extremity of the body;
while the &s;potted cavy, de&s;cribed in the original
work, exceeded not &s;even inches five lines; which
difference, as there was no other between the
two animals, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed entirely to that of
their ages.</P>
<P>The height before, in the individual we are
now de&s;cribing, is &s;even inches, and behind about
nine inches and a half; &s;o that, in walking, the
hind part of the body appeared always higher
than the head. The po&s;terior part of the body
is al&s;o the thicke&s;t, being nineteen inches and a
half in circumference, while that of the anterior
part is only fourteen inches.</P>
<P>The body is covered with &s;hort, coar&s;e, thinly
&s;cattered hairs, of a du&s;ky colour, and deeper on
the back. But the belly, the brea&s;t, the throat,
and the interior parts of the legs, are of a dirty
white: This animal is rendered exceedingly re|markable,
by five longitudinal rows of white
&s;pots, which run along the body, and approach
each other at their extremities.</P>
<P>The head, from the no&s;e to the top of the
front, is near five inches long, and very convex.
The eyes are large, prominent, of a browni&s;h
colour, and about two inches di&s;tant from one
another. The ears are roundi&s;h, about eight
lines in length, and nearly of an equal breadth
at the ba&s;e; they are plaited, and covered with
a down &s;o fine as to be almo&s;t imperceptible ei|ther
<PB N="400" REF="472">
to the touch or the &s;ight. The end of the
no&s;e is broad, nearly of a black colour, and di|vided
like that of the hare. The no&s;trils are
very large. The animal has con&s;iderable &s;trength
and addre&s;s in the management of this organ;
for I have often &s;een him rai&s;e the portcullis of
his cage with it. The under jaw is an inch
&s;horter, and much narrower than the upper. On
each &s;ide, and toward the ba&s;e of the upper jaw,
there is a kind of longitudinal fold, garni&s;hed
with hair in the middle, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, e|&s;pecially
when viewed &s;idewi&s;e, may be mi&s;ta|ken
for the mouth; for the mouth appears not,
unle&s;s when it is open; its aperture exceeds not
&s;ix or &s;even lines; and it is not above two
or three lines di&s;tant from the fold mentioned
above.</P>
<P>Each jaw is armed with two very long inci&s;ive
teeth, which are as yellow as &s;affron, and of
&s;trength &s;ufficient to cut wood. I have &s;een this
animal, in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle night, cut a hole
in one of the planks of his lodging large enough
to let out his head. His tongue is narrow, thick,
and &s;omewhat rough. His whi&s;kers con&s;i&s;t of
black and white hairs, placed on each &s;ide of the
no&s;e; and there are &s;imilar hairs, but blacker and
fewer in number, on each &s;ide of the head under
the ears. The re&s;i&s;tance of the animal prevent|ed
us from counting the number of its grinders.</P>
<P>Each foot, both before and behind, has five
toes, four of which are armed with claws about
<PB N="400" REF="473">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="401" REF="474">
half an inch long, and of a fle&s;h colour. But
this colour &s;hould not be regarded as a con&s;tant
character; for, in &s;everal animals, and particular|ly
the hare, we often find the claws black, while,
in other individuals, they are whiti&s;h or fle&s;h|coloured.
The fifth, or interior claw, is very
&s;hort, and only vi&s;ible when the animal rai&s;es
his foot. Between the hind feet, at a little di|&s;tance
from the organs of generation, there are
two paps of a browni&s;h colour. In fine, though
the tail is hardly vi&s;ible, by &s;earching, we find a
&s;mall button of two or three lines long.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic paca, or &s;potted cavy, eats every
thing pre&s;ented to him, and has a &s;trong appe|tite.
He is commonly fed with bread, which
he eats equally well, whether it be &s;oaked in
water, in wine, or even in vinegar. But, he is
&s;o fond of &s;ugar and fruits, that, when offered
to him, he expre&s;&s;es his joy by bounding and
leaping. He is al&s;o fond of roots and pot-herbs
of all kinds; for he eats, with equal reli&s;h,
grapes, cellery, onions, and garlick; and
he refu&s;es not coleworts, gra&s;s, mo&s;s, or the
bark of trees. We have even &s;een him eat
wood, though half charred. Fle&s;h he &s;eemed
to like wor&s;e than any other food, and he eat it
but rarely, and in very &s;mall quantities. He
might be ea&s;ily fed with grain; for he often
&s;earched for it among his litter. When he
drinks, he laps like the dog. His urine is
<PB N="402" REF="475">
thick, and has an in&s;upportable odour. His ex|crements
con&s;i&s;t of &s;mall crottels, which are
longer than tho&s;e of the rabbit or hare.</P>
<P>From the&s;e minute ob&s;ervations, we are led to
believe that this &s;pecies might be naturalized in
France, which, as the animal is ea&s;ily tamed, and
his fle&s;h is excellent, would be a u&s;eful acqui&s;ition.
He &s;eems not to be much afraid of cold; and,
be&s;ides, as he can dig holes in the earth, he could
ea&s;ily defend him&s;elf again&s;t the rigour of win|ter.
A &s;ingle individual of this &s;pecies would
furni&s;h as much good meat as &s;even or eight
rabbits.</P>
<P>M. de la Borde informs us, that the &s;potted
cavy generally lives on the banks of rivers; and
that he forms his hole in &s;uch a manner as to
have three different ways of entering, or going
out. &startq;When pur&s;ued,&endq; he remarks, &startq;he takes
to the water, and dives frequently; but, when
attacked by the dogs, he makes a vigorous
defence.&endq; M. de la Borde adds, &startq;that the
fle&s;h of this animal is much e&s;teemed at Cay|enne,
and that, however prepared, it is ex|cellent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;potted cavy lives alone in his hole, and
leaves it not till night, when he goes in que&s;t
of food. He comes not abroad during the
day, unle&s;s when he is obliged by the nece&s;|&s;ities
of nature; for no dung is ever found in
his kennel; and, when he returns, he always

&s;huts up the entrances with leaves and twigs.
The female generally produces but one at a
time, which quits not the mother till it be full
grown, or, if it be a male, till it copulates.
At Cayenne there are two or three &s;pecies,
which are &s;aid not to intermix. Some of them
weigh from fourteen to twenty pounds, and
others from twenty-five to thirty.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>The VIRGINIAN OPOSSUM<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>All the &s;pecies of the opo&s;&s;um have two canine teeth in each jaw. The cutting teeth in each jaw are unequal. They have five toes on each foot; and the hind feet are formed like a hand, with a di&s;tinct thumb.&mdash;The Virginian opo&s;&s;um has a long &s;harp pointed no&s;e, large, round, naked, and very thin ears, &s;mall, black, lively eyes, and long &s;tiff hairs on each &s;ide of the no&s;e, and behind the eyes. The face is covered with &s;hort &s;oft hairs, of a du&s;ky colour. Above each eye, there is a large white &s;pot. The cheeks are whiti&s;h, and the &s;ides of the neck of a dirty yellow. The hind part of the neck, and the back, are covered with &s;oft, but uneven hairs, above two inches long, the bottoms of which are of a yellowi&s;h white, the middle part black, and the ends whiti&s;h. The &s;ides are covered with dirty and du&s;ky hairs, and the belly with &s;oft, woolly, dirty white hair. The legs and thighs are black, the feet du&s;ky, and the claws white. The ba&s;e of the tail, for near three inches, is clothed with long hairs like tho&s;e on the back, and the remainder with &s;mall &s;cales; the half next the body is black, and the re&s;t white. The tail has a di&s;agreeable appearance, re&s;embling the body of a &s;nake, and has the &s;ame prehen&s;ile power as that of &s;ome monkeys. The body is round, and pretty thick, and the legs are &s;hort. The female, on the lower part of the belly, has a large pouch, in which the teats are lodged, and where the young &s;helter as &s;oon as they are born.

<P>THE Opo&s;&s;um is an American animal, and
ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable from all others, by
two very &s;ingular characters. 1. Under the belly
of the female there is a large cavity in which &s;he re|ceives
<PB N="405" REF="479">
and &s;uckles her young. 2. In both male
and female, the fir&s;t toe of the hind feet has
no claws, and is &s;eparated from the re&s;t, like the
thumb in the human hand; while the other
toes of the &s;ame feet are placed near each other,
<PB N="406" REF="480">
and armed with crooked claws. The fir&s;t cha|racter
has been remakred by mo&s;t travellers and
naturali&s;ts; but the &s;econd has entirely e&s;caped
them. It was fir&s;t ob&s;erved by Edward Ty&s;on,
an Engli&s;h phy&s;ician. He is the only author
who has given a good de&s;cription of the fe|male<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The anatomy of an oppo&s;&s;um, London, 1698.</NOTE>;
<PB N="407" REF="481">
and, a few years after, Mr Cowper,
a celebrated Engli&s;h anatomi&s;t, communicated
to Ty&s;on the ob&s;ervations he had made upon
the male. Other authors, and particularly the
nomenclators, who perpetually multiply &s;pecies
without nece&s;&s;ity, have committed a number of
blunders with regard to this animal, which we
mu&s;t endeavour to correct.</P>
<P>Our opo&s;&s;um is the &s;ame animal with the great
Oriental philander of Seba<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Seba, tom. 1. p. 64, tab. 39.</NOTE>; for, of all the ani|mals
of which Seba has given figures, and to
which he applies the names of <HI>Philander, Opo&s;|&s;um,
of Carigueya,</HI> this alone has the two charac|ters
of a pouch under the belly, and thumbs
without claws on the hind feet. Neither is the
opo&s;&s;um an Ea&s;tern animal, but a native of the
warm climates of the New World; for the two
we have in the royal cabinet were brought from
America. That of Ty&s;on was &s;ent to him from
Virginia. M. de Chanvallon, a corre&s;pondent
of the Academy of Sciences at Martinico, who
gave us a young opo&s;&s;um, recogni&s;ed the other
two to be real American opo&s;&s;ums. It is agreed
by all voyagers, that this animal is found in Bra|&s;il,
New Spain, Virginia, the Antilles, &amp;c. and
<PB N="408" REF="482">
none of them ever mention their having &s;een it
in the Ea&s;t Indies. Hence Seba deceives him|&s;elf,
when he calls them the <HI>Oriental Philanders.</HI>
He &s;ays, that his philander was &s;ent him from
Amboina, along with other curio&s;ities, under the
name of <HI>Coes-coes;</HI> but he allows, at the &s;ame
time, that it had been brought to Amboina from
&s;ome other remote country<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Philander maximus orientalis foemina. Inter alia rario|ra et hocce animal nobis ex Amboina mi&s;&s;um e&s;t, &s;ub nomine <HI>Coes-coes.</HI> eo quidem delatum EX ORIS REMOTIORIBUS; <HI>Seba, vol. 1. p.</HI> 64.</NOTE>. This confe&s;&s;ion
is alone &s;ufficient to throw a &s;u&s;picion on the
denomination of <HI>Oriental Philander;</HI> for it is
very probable that travellers may have tran&s;port|ed
this animal from America to the Ea&s;t Indies;
but we have no proof of its being a native of
Amboina; and the very pa&s;&s;age quoted from
Seba &s;eems to indicate the contrary. The &s;ource
of this error, in fact, as well as that of the name
<HI>Coes-coes,</HI> is to be a&s;cribed to Pi&s;o, who &s;ays<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Indiis Orientalibus, IDQUE SOLUM, QUANTUM HAC|TENUS CONSTAT, IN AMBOINA &s;imilis be&s;tia frequens, ad felis magnitudinem accedens; mactata ab incolis comeditur, &s;i rite praeparetur, nam alias foetet. Nomen illi <HI>Cous-cous</HI> inditum; <HI>Pi&s;on. hi&s;t. nat. Bra&s;il. p.</HI> 323.</NOTE>,
that, in Amboina, there is an animal, &s;imilar to
the Bra&s;ilian opo&s;&s;um, which is called <HI>Cous-cous.</HI>
Pi&s;o mentions no authority for this a&s;&s;ertion. It
would be very &s;ingular, if it were true, that this
animal is found in Amboina, and in no other
part of the Ea&s;t Indies. Seba, on the contrary,
<PB N="409" REF="483">
remarks, that the one &s;ent to him from Amboina
was not a native of that place, but had been
tran&s;ported from a more di&s;tant country. But,
though he was ignorant of the region from which
his philander was brought, he has pre&s;umed to
give it the epithet of <HI>Oriental.</HI> It is unque&s;tio|nably,
however, the &s;ame animal, as will appear
from comparing his figure, Tab. 39. with Nature.
But what augments this error, at the &s;ame time
that the author gives to the American opo&s;&s;um
the name of <HI>the great Oriental philander,</HI> he ex|hibits
to us another animal, which he believes
to be different from the former, and calls it the
<HI>American philander</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Seba, tab. 36, fig, 1. and 2.</NOTE>; and yet, from his own
de&s;cription, it differs from the great Oriental phi|lander
only in being &s;maller, and in having the
&s;pots above the eyes of a browner colour. The&s;e
differences are too &s;light and too accidental to
con&s;titute two di&s;tinct &s;pecies; for he takes no
notice of another difference, which, if it had any
exi&s;tence, would be much more e&s;&s;ential, namely,
that this American philander of Seba<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE> has a
&s;harp claw upon the thumbs of the hind feet,
while his great Oriental philander has no claws
on the&s;e thumbs<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. tab. 39.</NOTE>. Now, it is certain, that our
opo&s;&s;um, which is the true American one, has
no claws on the hind thumbs. If any animal,
therefore, with &s;harp claws on the&s;e thumbs, ex|i&s;ted,
like that repre&s;ented by Seba in his 36th
<PB N="410" REF="484">
table, it could not, as he maintains, be the Ame|rican
opo&s;&s;um. But this is not all: Seba gives
a third animal under the name of the <HI>Oriental
philander</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Seba, tab. 38. fig. 1.</NOTE>; of which, however, he makes no
mention in his de&s;criptions of the other two, but
follows Fran&ccedil;ois Valentin, an author, as for|merly
remarked, who merits no confidence. This
third animal is &s;till the &s;ame with the two fir&s;t.
Hence it appears, that the three figures in Seba's
36th, 38th, and 39th tables, are one and the
&s;ame animal; and it is probable, that the drawer,
from inattention, has given &s;harp claws to the
hind as well as to the fore thumbs, as in tables
36th and 38th, and that, being more exact in
table 39th, he has repre&s;ented the thumbs of the
hind feet, as they really are, without claws. We
are, therefore, per&s;uaded that the&s;e three animals
of Seba are only individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies,
which is the &s;ame with that of our opo&s;&s;um, and
that the &s;light differences in &s;ize and colour,
mentioned above, proceed from age or from ac|cident.
The author him&s;elf allows, that the two
animals in his 36th and 38th tables, differ only
in &s;ize and &s;ome &s;hades of colour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;t autem femella haecce Americanis Philandris FOEMI|$IS QUAM SIMILLIMA; ni&s;i quod pilis dor&s;alibus aliquantum $$turatius fufeis $e&s;tita, et toto habitu procerior &s;it illis; <HI>Seba,</HI> $span$.</NOTE>; and that the
third, table 39th, differs from the two former in
being larger only, and having the &s;pots above
<PB N="411" REF="485">
the eyes, in&s;tead of yellowi&s;h, of a brown colour.
Seba remarks, &startq;That, according to Francis Va|lentin,
the philander, table 38th, is the large&s;t
kind found in the Ea&s;t Indies, and e&s;pecially
among the Mallayes, where it is called <HI>Pelan|dor
Aro&eacute;,</HI> that is, <HI>the rabbit of Aro&eacute;,</HI> though
Aro&eacute; is not the only place where the&s;e animals
are to be met with; that they are common in
the i&s;land of Solor; that they are reared along
with the rabbits, to whom they do no harm;
that their fle&s;h, which is excellent, is eaten by
the inhabitants,&endq; &amp;c. The&s;e facts are extreme|ly
que&s;tionable, not to &s;ay fal&s;e. 1. The phi|lander,
tab. 38th, is not the large&s;t Ea&s;t India kind;
for, according to our author, that repre&s;ented in
tab. 39th, which he likewi&s;e attributes to the Ea&s;t
Indies, is larger. 2. This philander has no re|&s;emblance
to the rabbit; and, con&s;equently, is
improperly called <HI>the rabbit of Aro&eacute;.</HI> 3. No
Voyager to the Ea&s;t Indies makes mention of
this remarkable animal; neither is it found in
any other part of the Old Continent. Seba him|&s;elf
&s;eems to perceive not only the incapacity,
but the unfaithfulne&s;s of the author he quotes:
&startq;Cujus equidem rei,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;fides &s;it penes au|torem.

<P>M. Bri&s;&s;on, in his account of quadrupeds, has
implicitly adopted what he found in the works
of Seba, and follows him both in his denomina|tions
and de&s;criptions. He even proceeds a &s;tep
farther than his author, when he makes three
di&s;tinct &s;pecies of the philanders, repre&s;ented in
tab. 36. 38. and 39. of Seba; for, if M. Bri&s;&s;on
had examined the idea given by Seba, he would
<PB N="414" REF="488">
have found, that the latter does not exhibit his
philanders as three di&s;tinct &s;pecies. Seba never
doubted, that an animal found in the warm cli|mates
of America, would not al&s;o be found in the
warm regions of A&s;ia. He denominated his a|nimals
Oriental or American, according as they
came to him from the one or the other Continent.
It is obvious, from the following pa&s;&s;age, that
he does not take the word <HI>&s;pecies</HI> in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e:
&startq;This is the large&s;t <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of the&s;e animals;&endq; p.
61. He adds, &startq;This female is perfectly &s;imilar
to the female philanders of America; it is only
longer, and covered on the back with hair of a
deeper yellow.&endq; The&s;e differences, as formerly
remarked, are only accidental varieties, which
are common among individuals of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies
at different ages; and, in fact, Seba never
pretended to make a methodical di&s;tribution of
animals into cla&s;&s;es, genera, and &s;pecies. He
gives only figures of the different &s;pecimens in
his cabinet, which he di&s;tingui&s;hes by numbers,
according to any varieties he perceived in their
&s;ize, the tints of their colours, or the countries
from which he obtained them. It is apparent,
therefore, that M. Bri&s;&s;on had no authority for
making three &s;pecies of philanders, e&s;pecially as
he gives no di&s;tinctive characters, and makes no
mention of the want of claws on the thumbs of
the hind feet. He &s;ays, in general, that the phi|landers
have <HI>claws,</HI> without making any ex|ception.
The philander, however, which he
<PB N="415" REF="489">
&s;aw in the royal cabinet, had no claws on the
thumbs of the hind feet; and it appears to have
been the only one he ever &s;aw; &s;ince, in his
book, there is no more than No. 1. marked with
two a&s;teri&s;ms. The chief error in Bri&s;&s;on's work
is in the li&s;t of &s;pecies, which is more numerous
than that of Nature.</P>
<P>M. Linnaeus is the only other nomenclator
we have to examine. In this article, he is le&s;s
exceptionable than in many others; for he has
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed one of the three &s;pecies of Seba<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Count de Buffon's &s;trictures on the Sy&s;tema Natu|rae of Linnaeus are adapted to the tenth edition; Buffon's critici&s;ms, of cour&s;e, have no application to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Linnaeus's &s;y&s;tem.

and that this animal is our opo&s;&s;um, which
is peculiar to South America, and was never
&s;een in the Ea&s;t Indies, unle&s;s when tran&s;ported
thither. I thought I had cleared up every am|biguity;
but &s;till &s;ome difficulties remain with
<PB N="416" REF="490">
regard to the <HI>taiibi,</HI> which Marcgrave<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Marcgrave, Hi&s;tor. Natur. Bra&s;ilien&s;. pag. 223.</NOTE> has not
repre&s;ented as an animal different from the <HI>ca|rigueya;</HI>
but, neverthele&s;s, John&s;ton<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John&s;ton, de Quadruped. pag. 95.</NOTE>, Seba<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Seba, vol. 1. pag. 57. tab. 36. fig. 4.</NOTE>,

&s;pecies di&s;tinct from the preceding. In Marcgrave,
however, we find the two names <HI>carigueya</HI> and
<HI>taiibi</HI> at the head of the &s;ame article, where it is
&s;aid, that this animal is called <HI>carigueya</HI> in Bra|&s;il,
and <HI>taiibi</HI> in Paraguay. &startq;Carigueya Bra&s;i|lien&s;ibus,
aliquibus jupatiima, Petiguaribus
taiibi.&endq; He then gives Ximenes's de&s;cription
of the carigueya. After which, we find another
animal, called <HI>taiibi</HI> by the Bra&s;ilians, <HI>cachorro
domato</HI> by the Portugue&s;e, and <HI>boo&s;chratte,</HI> or
<HI>wood-rat,</HI> by the Dutch. Margrave &s;ays not
that this animal is different from the carigueya;
he repre&s;ents it, on the contrary, as the male ca|rigueya:
&startq;Pedes et digitos habet ut foemella
jam de&s;cripta.&endq; It is obvious, therefore, that,
in Paraguay, both the male and female opo&s;&s;um
are called <HI>taiibi,</HI> and that, in Bra&s;il, the name
<HI>taiibi</HI> is given to the male, and that of <HI>carigueya</HI>
to the female. Be&s;ides, the differences between
the&s;e two animals, as they appear even from the
de&s;criptions given of them, are too &s;light to con|&s;titute
di&s;tinct &s;pecies. The mo&s;t remarkable
<PB N="417" REF="491">
difference is in the colour of the hair, which, in
the carigueya, is yellow and brown, but gray
is the taiibi, who&s;e hairs are white<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The hair of the wood-rat is of a fine &s;ilver gray colour. Some of them are &s;een totally white. The female has, under her belly, a pur&s;e which &s;he can open and &s;hut at plea&s;ure; <HI>Charlevoix's De&s;cript&punc; de la Nouv. France, tom. 3. p.</HI> 334.</NOTE> below, and
brown or black at their extremities. It is more
than probable, therefore, that the taiibi is the
male opo&s;&s;um. Mr Ray<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Raii Synop&s;. Quad p. 185.</NOTE> &s;eems to be of this
opinion, when, &s;peaking of the carigueya and
taiibi, he &s;ays, &startq;An &s;pecie, an &s;exu tantum a
praecedente diver&s;um?&endq; Seba, however, not|with&s;tanding
the authority of Marcgrave, and
the rational doubts of Ray, gives, in tab. 36.
fig. 4. the figure of an animal, which, without
any he&s;itation, he calls <HI>taiibi,</HI> and, at the &s;ame
time, &s;ays, that it is the &s;ame with the <HI>tlaquat|zin</HI>
of Hernandez. This is to accumulate error
upon error; for, from the acknowledgment of
Seba him&s;elf, his taiibi, which is a female, has
no pouch under the belly<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mar&s;upio tamen pro recondendis catulis caret haec &s;pe|cies; <HI>Seba, tom. 1. p.</HI> 58.</NOTE>, and Hernandez
makes this pouch the chief character of his tla|quatzin.
The taiibi of Seba, therefore, cannot
be the tlaquatzin of Hernandez, becau&s;e it wants
the pouch, nor the taiibi of Marcgrave, becau&s;e
it is a female. It is certainly another animal, ill
drawn, and wor&s;e de&s;cribed, to which Seba has
<PB N="418" REF="492">
thought proper to give the name of <HI>taiibi,</HI> and
ab&s;urdly refers it to the tlaquatzin of Hernandez,
which, as formerly remarked, is the &s;ame with
our opo&s;&s;um. Bri&s;&s;on and Linnaeus, with re|gard
to the taiibi, have blindly followed Seba.
They have both copied Hernandez's blunder as
to the tlaquatzin, and made an equivocal &s;pecies
of this animal, the one under the name of the
<HI>Bra&s;ilian philander</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Philander pilis in exortu albis, in extremitate nigricanti|bus ve&s;tita &hellip; &hellip; Philander Bra&s;ilien&s;is; <HI>Regn. Anim. p.</HI> 290.</NOTE>, and the other under that
of <HI>philander</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Didelphis philander, cauda ba&s;i pilo&s;a, auriculis pendu|lis, mammis quaternis; <HI>Sy&s;t. Nat. p.</HI> 72.</NOTE>. The true taiibi of Marcgrave
and Ray, therefore, is neither the taiibi of Seba,
nor the philander of Linnaeus, nor the Bra&s;ilian
philander of Bri&s;&s;on; and the two latter are not
the tlaquatzin of Hernandez. The taiibi of Se|ba,
if it had any exi&s;tence, would be an animal
different from all tho&s;e mentioned by the above
authors, and would require a new denomination.
In fine, as the male opo&s;&s;um has no pouch, it is
not &s;urpri&s;ing, that the male and female have
been con&s;idered as different animals, and that
the female has got the name of the <HI>carigueya,</HI>
and the male that of the <HI>taiibi.</HI></P>
<P>Edward Ty&s;on di&s;&s;ected and de&s;cribed the fe|male
opo&s;&s;um with great accuracy. In his in|dividual,
the head was &s;ix inches long, the body
thirteen, and the tail twelve. The fore legs are
&s;ix inches in length, and the hind legs four inches
<PB N="419" REF="493">
and a half. The circumference of the body is
from fifteen to &s;ixteen inches; that of the tail,
at its origin, is three inches, and only one to|ward
the extremity. The head acro&s;s the eyes
is three inches broad, gradually dimini&s;hes to
the no&s;e, and re&s;embles the head of a pig more
than that of a fox. The orbits of the eyes are
much inclined in the direction from the ears to
the no&s;e. The ears are rounded, and about an
inch and a half long. The aperture of the
mouth is two inches and a half, mea&s;uring from
one of the angles of the lips to the end of the
muzzle. The tongue is pretty narrow, three
inches long, rough, and full of &s;mall papillae,
directed backward. There are five toes on the
fore feet, all armed with crooked claws, and an
equal number on the hind feet, four of which
only have claws, and the fifth, which is the
thumb, is &s;eparated from the re&s;t, placed in a
lower &s;ituation, and has no claw. There is no
hair on the claws, which are covered with a
reddi&s;h &s;kin, and nearly an inch in length. The
palm of the hands and feet is large, and there
are fle&s;hy callo&s;ities under all the toes. The tail
is covered, for two or three inches from its ori|gin,
with hair, and afterwards, to the end, with
a &s;mooth &s;caly &s;kin. The &s;cales are whiti&s;h,
nearly hexagonal, and regularly placed, &s;o as
not to encroach on each other, being all &s;epa|rated
by a &s;mall circle of &s;kin, which is of a
browner colour than the &s;cales. The ears are
<PB N="420" REF="494">
naked, thin, and membranous, like the wings of
a bat; they are al&s;o very open, and the auditory
canal is large. The upper jaw is a little longer
than the under. The no&s;trils are large, the eyes
&s;mall, black, prominent and lively. The neck
is &s;hort, the che&s;t broad, and the whi&s;kers like
tho&s;e of the cat. The hair on the fore part of
the head is whiter and &s;horter than that on the
body: The back and &s;ides are a&s;h-coloured,
mixed with &s;ome &s;mall tufts of black and whiti&s;h
hairs; the belly is browner, and the legs more
du&s;ky. Under the belly of the female, there is an
aperture about two or three inches long, formed
by two folds of &s;kin, which compo&s;e a pouch
thinly covered with hair internally. This pouch
contains the teats; the young, as &s;oon as brought
forth, go into it in order to &s;uck the mother, and
acquire &s;o &s;trong a habit of concealing them|&s;elves,
that, after arriving at a con&s;iderable &s;ize,
they continue to take refuge in the pouch, when|ever
they are alarmed. This pouch the animal
can open or &s;hut at plea&s;ure, which it per|forms
by means of &s;everal mu&s;cles, and two
bones that are peculiar to the opo&s;&s;um. The&s;e
two bones are placed before the os pubis, to
which they are attached by their ba&s;e. They
are about two inches long, and gradually dimi|ni&s;h
in thickne&s;s from the ba&s;e to the extremity,
and &s;erve as a fulcrum to the mu&s;cles which
open the pouch. The antagoni&s;ts of the&s;e mu&s;|cles
&s;hut the pouch &s;o clo&s;e, that, in the living
<PB N="421" REF="495">
animal, it cannot be &s;een, unle&s;s when forcibly
dilated by the fingers. In the in&s;ide of the
pouch there is a number of glands, which &s;e|crete
a yellowi&s;h &s;ub&s;tance of &s;o di&s;agreeable a
&s;mell, that it infects the whole body of the ani|mal.
This matter, however, when dried, not
only lo&s;es its di&s;agreeable odour, but acquires a
perfume which may be compared to that of
mu&s;k. The pouch is not, as has been fal&s;ely
a&s;&s;erted by Marcgrave and Pi&s;o, the place where
the young are conceived. The female opo&s;&s;um
has an internal uterus, which differs, indeed,
from that of other animals, but where the young
are conceived and retained till the moment of
their birth. Ty&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We will therefore here take a &s;urvey and an account of the&s;e parts; and we find that there are <HI>two</HI> ovaria, <HI>two</HI> tubae Fallopianae, <HI>two</HI> cornua uteri, <HI>two</HI> uteri, and <HI>two</HI> vaginae uteri; <HI>Ty&s;on, anatomy of an opo&s;&s;um, p.</HI> 36.</NOTE> tells us, that in this ani|mal
there are two uteri, two vaginae, four cor|nua
uteri, four Fallopian tubes, and four ovaria.
From the di&s;&s;ections of M. Daubenton, though
he agrees not with Ty&s;on in every article, it is
certain, that, in the generative parts of the opo&s;|&s;um,
there are &s;everal parts double, which are
&s;ingle in other animals. The glans penis of
the male, and the glans clitoridis of the female,
are forked, and have the appearance of being
double. The vagina, which is &s;ingle at its en|trance,
afterwards divides into two canals, &amp;c.
This &s;tructure is extremely &s;ingular, and differs
from that of all other quadrupeds.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="496">
The opo&s;&s;um is an original native of the
warm countries of the New World. He ap|pears
not, however, to be &s;o &s;trictly attached to
warm climates as the armadillo; for he is found
not only in the Bra&s;il, Guiana, and Mexico, but
likewi&s;e in Florida, Virginia<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The opo&s;&s;um is common in Virginia and New Spain; <HI>Hi&s;t. Nat. des Antilles, p.</HI> 122.</NOTE>, and other tem|perate
regions of America. He is a very com|mon
animal; becau&s;e the female produces of|ten,
and, according to mo&s;t authors, four or five<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quaternos quino&s;ve parit catulos, quos utero conceptos, edito&s;que in lucem, alvi cavitate quadam, dum adhuc parvuli &s;unt, condit et &s;ervat, &amp;c.; <HI>Hernand. Hi&s;t. Mex. p.</HI> 330.</NOTE>,
&s;ome &s;ay &s;ix or &s;even, at a time. Marcgrave a&s;|&s;ures
us, that he has &s;een &s;ix living young in
the pouch of the female<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Haec ip&s;a quam de&s;cribo be&s;tia &s;ex catulos vivos et om|nibus membris ab&s;olutos, &s;ed &s;ine pilis, in hac bur&s;a habebat, qui etiam hinc inde in ea movebantur; quilibet catulus duos digitos erat longus, &amp;c.; <HI>Marcgrave, Hi&s;t. Bra&s;. p.</HI> 222. They have a pouch under the belly where they carry their young, &s;ix or &s;even of which are brought forth at a litter; <HI>De&s;cript. de Nouv. Monde, per de La&euml;t, p</HI> 485.</NOTE>. The&s;e young ones
were about two inches long, very agile, and
came out and went into the pouch &s;everal times
a day. When new born, they are very &s;mall.
According to &s;ome travellers, when they e&s;cape
from the uterus, and go into the pouch, and at|tach
them&s;elves to the teats, they exceed not the
&s;ize of flies<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The female opo&s;&s;um has a double belly, or rather a pendu|lous membrane that covers the whole belly, without being fixed to it, the in&s;ide of which may be &s;een after the animal has once brought forth. At the hinder part of this membrane, there is an aperture, into which the hand may be introduced. It is here where the young retire, either to avoid danger, or for the purpo&s;es of &s;ucking and &s;leeping. In this manner they live till they are able to procure food for them&s;elves. &hellip; I have &s;een young ones attached to the teats, when they exceeded not the &s;ize of a fly. They never quit the teats till they are as large as mice; <HI>Hi&s;t. de la Virginie, p.</HI> 220.</NOTE>. This fact is not &s;o much exag|gerated
<PB N="423" REF="497">
as might naturally be imagined; for
we have &s;een, in an animal who&s;e &s;pecies has a
great affinity to that of the opo&s;&s;um, young at|tached
to the teats, which were not bigger than
large beans; and it is probable, that, in this
animal, the uterus is only a place de&s;tined for
the conception and fir&s;t formation of the foetus,
the exclu&s;ion of which being earlier than in o|ther
quadrupeds, its growth is fini&s;hed in the
pouch, where it enters the moment after its pre|mature
birth. No per&s;on has a&s;certained the
time of ge&s;tation in the female opo&s;&s;um, which
is probably much &s;horter than in any other qua|druped:
And, as this premature exclu&s;ion of
the foetus is a &s;ingularity in Nature, we mu&s;t
earne&s;tly recommend it to tho&s;e who have an
opportunity of ob&s;erving the opo&s;&s;um in its na|tive
country, to endeavour to di&s;cover the time
the females go with young, and, after birth, how
long the young ones remain attached to the
nipples. This la&s;t ob&s;ervation is both curious
in it&s;elf, and may be productive of utility: From
it we may perhaps learn &s;ome method of pre|&s;erving
<PB N="424" REF="498">
the lives of infants who come into the
world before the natural period.</P>
<P>That the young opo&s;&s;ums, therefore, continue
attached, and pa&s;ted, as it were, to the teats of
the mother, till they acquire &s;trength and growth
&s;ufficient to enable them to move about with
ea&s;e, is a fact no longer to be doubted. Neither
is it peculiar to this &s;pecies, as will appear from
the hi&s;tory of the <HI>marmo&s;e,</HI> or murine opo&s;&s;um,
which is given in the next article. The female
of this la&s;t &s;pecies has no pouch under its belly,
like the female of the former. It is not, there|fore,
to the conveniency of a &s;ecure retreat af|forded
by the pouch, that the effects of adhering
long to the teats, and acquiring growth in this
immoveable &s;ituation, are to be a&s;cribed. I
make this remark to prevent the pouch from
being regarded as a &s;econd uterus, or at lea&s;t as
a &s;helter indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to young which

of animals.</P>
<P>M. de Vo&s;ma&euml;r, director of the Prince of
Orange's cabinet of Natural Hi&s;tory, has added
a note to p. 6. of his de&s;cription of a flying
&s;quirrel, publi&s;hed at Am&s;terdam in the year
1767, in which he &s;ays,</P>
<P>&startq;The <HI>coe&s;coes</HI> is the <HI>bo&s;ch</HI> or <HI>beu&s;rult</HI> of the
Ea&s;t Indies, the <HI>philander</HI> of Seba, and the
<HI>didelphis</HI> of Linnaeus. The learned M. de
Buffon (&s;ee above, p. 407.) denies ab&s;olutely its
exi&s;tence in the Ea&s;t Indies, and limits it entirely
to the New World. We can, however, a&s;&s;ure
this learned naturali&s;t, that Valentin and Seba
were right in making the&s;e animals common
to A&s;ia and America. La&s;t &s;ummer, I my&s;elf
received a male and a female from the Ea&s;t In|dies.
The &s;ame &s;pecies has likewi&s;e been
tran&s;mitted from Amboina to Doctor Schlo&s;&s;er
of Am&s;terdam. The chief difference between
the <HI>coe&s;coes</HI> of the Ea&s;t and that of the We&s;t
Indies, con&s;i&s;ts, according to my ob&s;ervation,
in the colour of the hair, which, in the Ea&s;t
India male, is all of a yellowi&s;h white: That
of the female is a little browner, with a black,
or rather brown line on the back. The head
<PB N="431" REF="507">
of the We&s;t India kind is &s;horter; but the head
of the male appears to be longer than that of
the female. The ears of the Ea&s;t are much
&s;horter than tho&s;e of the We&s;t India &s;pecies.
The de&s;cription of the &s;econd &s;pecies, mention|ed
by Valentin, is too diffu&s;e to afford any
certain information.&endq;</P>
<P>That M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r received male and female
animals from the Ea&s;t Indies, under the deno|mination
of <HI>coe&s;coes,</HI> I have no rea&s;on to doubt.
But the differences which he him&s;elf points out
between the coe&s;coes and the opo&s;&s;ums, may
lead us to conclude, that they are not animals of
the &s;ame &s;pecies. I acknowledge, however, that
M. de Vo&s;ma&euml;r's critici&s;m is ju&s;t, when he re|marks,
that I made Seba's three philanders the
&s;ame animal, whil&s;t, in fact, the third, repre&s;ent|ed
in his 39th plate, is a different &s;pecies, and
is found in the Philippine I&s;lands, and, perhaps,
in &s;ome other parts of the Ea&s;t Indies, where it
is known by the name of <HI>coe&s;coes, cu&s;cus,</HI> or
<HI>cu&s;os.</HI> In the voyage of Chri&s;topher Barche|witz,
I find the following notice:</P>
<P>&startq;In the i&s;land of Lethy, there are <HI>cu&s;cus</HI> or
<HI>cu&s;cos,</HI> who&s;e fle&s;h has nearly the ta&s;te of that of
the rabbit. In colour they re&s;emble the marmot.
The eyes are &s;mall, round, and brilliant. The
legs are &s;hort; and the tail, which is long,
has no hair on it. This animal leaps from one
tree to another, like the &s;quirrel, and then fixes
its tail round a branch, that it may eat the fruit
more commodiou&s;ly. It diffu&s;es a di&s;agree|able
<PB N="432" REF="508">
odour, like that of the fox. The female
has a pouch under the belly, into which her
young go in and out below her tail. She leaps
from one tree to another, conveying her
young in this pouch<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Barchewitz, p. 532.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>From the pouch under the belly, and the
prehen&s;ile tail, it appears, that the cu&s;cus or
cu&s;os of the Ea&s;t Indies is really an animal of the
&s;ame genus with the American opo&s;&s;um. But
this is by no means a proof that it belongs to
the &s;ame &s;pecies with any of tho&s;e which inha|bit
America. This would be the only example
of &s;uch a coincidence. If M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r had en|graven
the figures of the&s;e coe&s;coes, as he men|tions
in the text, we would have been enabled to
form a more complete notion of the &s;imilarities
and differences which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the A&s;iatic
coe&s;coes and the American opo&s;&s;ums. But I am
&s;till per&s;uaded that tho&s;e of the one Continent
will never be found in the other, unle&s;s they are
tran&s;ported thither. I refer the reader to what I
have &s;aid on this &s;ubject in p. 407. of this volume.</P>
<P>We mean not to deny the po&s;&s;ibility of e|qual
climates, in both Continents, producing
&s;ome animals of the preci&s;e &s;ame &s;pecies. We
formerly remarked, that the &s;ame temperature,
in different parts of the globe, &s;hould produce
the &s;ame beings, both in the animal and vege|table
kingdoms, if all other circum&s;tances were
equal. We treat not here, however, of philo|&s;ophical
po&s;&s;ibilities, which may be more or
<PB N="433" REF="509">
le&s;s probable, but of a very general fact, of
which numberle&s;s examples may be given. It
is certain, that, when America was di&s;covered,
none of the following animals exi&s;ted in the
New World: The elephant, the rhinoceros,
the hippopotamus, the camelopard, the camel,
the dromedary, the buffalo, the hor&s;e, the a&s;s,
the lion, the tiger, the apes, the baboons, and a
number of others, which I have formerly enume|rated,
p. 111. of this volume. In the &s;ame manner,
the tapir, the lama, the pecari, the jaguar, the
couguar, the agouti, the paca, the coati, the
&s;loth, and &s;everal others formerly mentioned,
did not exi&s;t in the Old Continent. Is not this
multitude of examples &s;ufficient to guard us
again&s;t pronouncing, like M. Vo&s;ma&euml;r, that
&s;uch and &s;uch animals belong equally to the
&s;outhern regions of both Worlds.</P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be applied to
the Indian cu&s;cus or cu&s;os:</P>
<P>&startq;In the Malucca i&s;lands,&endq; Mande&s;lo remarks,
&startq;there is an animal called <HI>cu&s;os,</HI> which dwells
on trees, and feeds on their fruits. It re&s;em|bles
a rabbit, and has thick, frizzled, coar&s;e
hair, of a mixed colour between gray and
red. The eyes are round and vivacious, the
feet &s;mall, and the tail &s;o &s;trong, that the ani|mal
hangs by it on the branches, in order the
more ea&s;ily to reach the fruit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Mande&s;lo, &s;uite d'Olearius, tom. 2. p. 384.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>In this pa&s;&s;age no mention is made of the
pouch under the belly, which is the mo&s;t di|&s;tingui&s;hing
<PB N="434" REF="510">
character of the opo&s;&s;ums. But
I &s;till maintain, that, if the cu&s;os of the Ea&s;t
Indies has this character, it is certainly a &s;pecies
which approaches very near to the American
opo&s;&s;ums; and I &s;hall be inclined to think that
it differs from the opo&s;&s;um nearly in the &s;ame
manner as the jaguar differs from the leopard.
Of all the animals belonging to the &s;outhern
climates of both Continents, the two la&s;t, with|out
being of the &s;ame &s;pecies, make the neare&s;t

The female has no pouch under the bel|ly;
there are only two longitudinal folds near
the thighs, between which the young attach

forked, and placed in the anus; and this la&s;t a|perture
&s;eems likewi&s;e, in the female, to be the
orifice of the vagina. The birth of the young,
in this &s;pecies, &s;eems to be &s;till more premature.

When they are brought forth, and attach them|&s;elves
to the teats, they are hardly &s;o large as
&s;mall beans. The litter is al&s;o more numerous:
I have &s;een ten young, each of them fixed to a
&s;eparate teat, and yet the mother had four teats
unoccupied; &s;o that, in all, &s;he had no le&s;s than
fourteen teats. It is upon females of this &s;pe|cies
that the ob&s;ervations recommended in the
preceding article ought chiefly to be made;
for I am per&s;uaded, that they bring forth a few
days after conception, and that the young, at
the time of exclu&s;ion, are only foetu&s;es, as they
exceed not one fourth part of the growth which
foetu&s;es generally acquire at that period. The
delivery of the mother is always a very early a|bortion,
and the foetu&s;es pre&s;erve their lives
&s;olely by fixing to the teats, and never quitting
their hold, till they attain that degree of &s;trength
and growth which they would have naturally
acquired in the uterus, if they had not been thus
prematurely excluded.</P>
<P>The murine opo&s;&s;um has the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions
and manners as the Virginian &s;pecies. They
both dig holes and burrow in the ground, fix
them&s;elves to the branches of trees by the
extremities of the tail, and dart upon birds
and &s;mall animals. They likewi&s;e eat fruits,
grain, and roots. But they prefer fi&s;h and
crabs, which, it is &s;aid, they catch with their
tails. This fact is extremely doubtful, and ac|cords
not with the natural &s;tupidity a&s;cribed to
<PB N="438" REF="516">
the&s;e animals, who, according to the te&s;timony
of mo&s;t travellers, can neither move, nor fly,
nor defend them&s;elves with any mea&s;ure of
dexterity.</P>

<HEAD>THE MEXICAN OPOSSUM<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>This animal has large, angular, tran&s;parent ears. Its no&s;e is thicker than that of the former kind.

The tail is long, pretty thick, varied with brown and yellow, hairy near an inch from its origin, and the re&s;t is naked.

<P>THIS animal was fir&s;t taken notice of by
Fernandes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Franc. Fernandes, Hi&s;t. quad. Nov. Hi&s;p. p. 10.</NOTE>. The cayopollin, &s;ays he, is a
&s;mall animal, about the &s;ize of a rat. It re&s;em|bles
the opo&s;&s;um in the muzzle, the ears, and the
tail, which la&s;t it u&s;es as a hand. The ears are
<PB N="439" REF="517">
thin and tran&s;parent. The legs and feet are
white. The young, when frighted, lay fa&s;t hold
of the mother, who carries them up to the near|e&s;t
tree. This &s;pecies is found in the moun|tains
of New Spain. Nieremberg<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;. Nieremberg, hi&s;t. nat. peregrin. p. 158.</NOTE> has copied
the&s;e remarks verbatim, without adding any of
his own. Seba<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Seba, tom. 1. p. 49. tab. 31. fig. 3.</NOTE>, who fir&s;t gave a figure of this
animal, has not de&s;cribed it. He only &s;ays, that
its head is &s;omewhat thicker, and its tail larger
than tho&s;e of the marmo&s;e or murine opo&s;&s;um,
and that, though it be of the &s;ame genus, it be|longs
to a different climate, and even to a diffe|rent
Continent. He then refers to Nieremberg
and John&s;ton for farther information concern|ing
this animal. But it is evident, that neither
Nieremberg nor John&s;ton had ever &s;een it; for
they only follow Fernandes. None of the&s;e three
authors &s;ay that it is a native of Africa. They
mention it, on the contrary, as peculiar to the
mountains of the warm regions of America; and
yet Seba, without the &s;malle&s;t authority, pretends
that it is an African animal. That which we
&s;aw unque&s;tionably came from America. It was
larger, the muzzle was not &s;o &s;harp, and the tail was
longer than tho&s;e of the murine opo&s;&s;um, and in
every particular it approached nearer than the
latter to the Virginian opo&s;&s;um. The&s;e three
animals have a great re&s;emblance in their exter|nal
<PB N="440" REF="518">
and internal &s;tructure, in the &s;upernumerary
bones of the pelvis, in the form of the feet, in
their premature birth, in their long and con&s;tant
adherence to the teats, and in their manners and
di&s;po&s;itions. They all belong to the &s;ame cli|mate
of the New World. They are never found
in the cold regions of America, and cannot live
even in temperate climates. Be&s;ides, they have
all an ugly a&s;pect. Their mouth, which is &s;plit
like that of a pike, their ears which re&s;emble
tho&s;e of a bat, their &s;erpent-like tail, and their
feet, &s;haped like tho&s;e of a monkey, exhibit a
&s;trange picture, which is rendered &s;till more di&s;|agreeable
by their offen&s;ive &s;mell, and by the
&s;lowne&s;s and &s;tupidity that accompany all their
actions and movements.</P>
