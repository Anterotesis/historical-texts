<P>_<HI>VLYSSES</HI> makes his fir&s;t entry in this book.
It may be ask'd where properly is the be|ginning
of the Action? It is not nece&s;&s;ary
that the beginning of the <HI>Action</HI> &s;hould be
the beginning of the <HI>Poem;</HI> there is a na|tural,
and an artificial order, and <HI>Homer</HI>
makes u&s;e of the latter. The Action of
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> properly begins neither with
the Poem, nor with the appearance of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> here, but with
the relation he makes of his departure from <HI>Troy</HI> in the ninth
book. <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> has very judiciou&s;ly remark'd, that in the con&s;titu|tion
of the fable, the Poet ought not to make the Departure of
a Prince from his own country the foundation of his Poem, but
his Return, and his &s;tay in other places involuntary. For if the
&s;tay of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had been voluntary, he would have been guilty in
&s;ome degree of all the di&s;orders that happen'd during his ab&s;ence.
Thus in this book <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> fir&s;t appears in a de&s;olate I&s;land, &s;itting
in tears by the &s;ide of the Ocean, and looking upon it as the
ob&s;tacle to his return.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="40">
This artificial order is of great u&s;e, it cuts off all langui&s;h|ing
and un-entertaining incidents, and pa&s;&s;es over tho&s;e inter|vals
of time that are void of action; it gives continuity to
the &s;tory, and at fir&s;t tran&s;ports the Reader into the middle of the
&s;ubject. In the beginning of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> the Gods command
<HI>Mercury</HI> to go down to the I&s;land of <HI>Ogygia,</HI> and charge <HI>Calyp|&s;o</HI>
to di&s;mi&s;s <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> one would think the Poem was to end
in the compa&s;s of a few lines, the Poet beginning the action &s;o
near the end of the &s;tory; and we wonder how he finds matter
to fill up his Poem, in the little &s;pace of time that intervenes be|tween
his fir&s;t appearance and his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>This book, as well as the fir&s;t, opens with an A&s;&s;embly of the
Gods. This is done to give an importance to his Poem, and
to prepare the mind of the Reader to expect every thing that is
great and noble, when Heaven is engag'd in the care and prote|ction
of his Heroes. Both the&s;e A&s;&s;emblies are placed very pro|perly,
&s;o as not to interrupt the &s;eries of action: The fir&s;t a&s;&s;em|bly
of the Gods is only preparatory to introduce the action; and
this &s;econd is no more than a bare tran&s;ition from <HI>Telemachus</HI> to
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> from the recital of the tran&s;actions in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> to what
more immediately regards the per&s;on of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>In the former council, both the Voyage of <HI>Telemachus</HI> and the
Return of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> were determin'd at the &s;ame time: The day of
that a&s;&s;embly is the fir&s;t day both of the <HI>principal action,</HI> (which
is the return of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>) and of the <HI>incident,</HI> which is the voyage
of <HI>Telemachus;</HI> with this difference, that the incident was imme|diately
put in practice, by the de&s;cent of <HI>Minerva</HI> to <HI>Ithaca;</HI> and
the execution of it takes up the four preceding books; whereas
the principal action was only then prepared, and the execution
deferr'd to the pre&s;ent book, where <HI>Mercury</HI> is actually &s;ent to
<HI>Calyp&s;o.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> therefore judges rightly when he &s;ays, that, in the fir&s;t
council, the &s;afety alone of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was propos'd; but the means
how to bring it about are here under con&s;ultation, which makes
the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;econd council.</P>

<P>VERSE 43. <HI>Nor help'd by mortal hand, nor guiding Gods.</HI> This
pa&s;&s;age is intricate: Why &s;hould <HI>Jupiter</HI> command <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to re|turn
without the guidance either of man or God? <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had
been ju&s;t declar'd the care of Heaven, why &s;hould he be thus
&s;uddenly abandon'd? <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> an&s;wers, that it is &s;poken &s;olely
with re&s;pect to the voyage which he immediately undertakes. This
indeed &s;hews a rea&s;on why this command is given; if he had
been under the guidance of a God, the &s;hipwreck (that great in|cident
which brings about the whole Cata&s;trophe of the Poem)
mu&s;t have been prevented by his power; and as for men, where
were they to be procur'd in a de&s;olate i&s;land? What confirms this
opinion is, that during the whole &s;hipwreck of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> there is
no interpo&s;ition of a Deity, not even of <HI>Pallas</HI> who u&s;ed to be
his con&s;tant guardian; the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e this command of
<HI>Jupiter</HI> forbids all a&s;&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es: Leucothoe</HI> indeed a&s;&s;i&s;ts
him, but it is not till he is &s;hipwreck'd. It appears further,
that this interdiction re&s;pects only the voyage from <HI>Ogygia,</HI> be|cau&s;e
<HI>Jupiter</HI> orders that there &s;hall be no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from man,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; but <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is tran&s;ported from
<HI>Phaeacia</HI> to <HI>Ithaca,</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
<HI>Phaeacians,</HI> as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves; and therefore what <HI>Jupiter</HI> here
&s;peaks has relation only to the pre&s;ent voyage. <HI>Dacier</HI> under&s;tands
this to be meant of any <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance only: but this &s;eems a
collu&s;ion; for whether the Gods a&s;&s;i&s;t vi&s;ibly or invi&s;ibly, the
effects are the &s;ame; and a Deity un&s;een might have pre&s;erv'd <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
from &s;torms, and directly guided him to his own country.
But it was nece&s;&s;ary for the de&s;ign of <HI>Homer,</HI> that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;hould
not &s;ail directly home; if he had, there had been no room for
the relation of his own adventures, and all tho&s;e &s;urprizing narra|tions
he makes to the <HI>Phaeacians; Homer</HI> therefore to bring about
the &s;hipwreck of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> withdraws the Gods.</P>

<P>VERSE 45. <HI>Alone, and floating to the wave.</HI>] The word in
the original is <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves, is under&s;tood:
It &s;ignifies, continues he, a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el made of one entire piece
of wood, or a ve&s;&s;el about which little wood is u&s;ed; it is deriv'd
from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, from being <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or its be|ing
compacted together with ea&s;e. <HI>He&s;ychius</HI> defines <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
to be, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: that
is, a &s;mall bark, or float of wood which &s;ailors bind together,
and immediately u&s;e in navigation. This ob&s;ervation appear'd to
me very nece&s;&s;ary, to take off an objection made upon a follow|ing
pa&s;&s;age in this book: the Critics have thought it incredible
that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;hould without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance build &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el, as
<HI>Homer</HI> de&s;cribes; but if we remember what kind of a ve&s;&s;el it is, it
may be reconcil'd to probability.</P>

<Q><L>VERSE 46. <HI>&mdash;Who&s;e haughty line</HI></L>
<L>Is mix'd with Gods.]</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Phaeacians</HI> were the inhabitants of <HI>Scheria,</HI> &s;ometimes call'd
<HI>Drepan&egrave;,</HI> afterwards <HI>Corcyra,</HI> now <HI>Corfu</HI> in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Ve|netians.</HI>
But it may be ask'd in what the&s;e people re&s;emble the
Gods? they are de&s;crib'd as a mo&s;t effeminate nation; whence
then this God-like Quality? <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> an&s;wers, that is either from
their undi&s;turb'd felicity, or from their divine quality of general
benevolence: he prefers the latter; but from the general character
of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> I &s;hould prefer the former. <HI>Homer</HI> frequently
de&s;cribes the Gods as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>the Gods that live in endle&s;s
ea&s;e:</HI> This is &s;uitable to the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> as will appear more fully
in the &s;equel of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey. Eu&s;tathius</HI> remarks that the Poet
here gives us in a few lines the heads of the eight &s;ucceeding
books; and &s;ure nothing can be a greater in&s;tance of <HI>Homer</HI>'s
art, than his building &s;o noble an edifice upon &s;o &s;mall a founda|tion:

<P>What is here &s;aid of the rod of <HI>Mercury,</HI> is, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob|&s;erves,
an Allegory: It is intended to &s;hew the force of eloquence,
which has a power to calm, or excite, to rai&s;e a pa&s;&s;ion, or com|po&s;e
it: <HI>Mercury</HI> is the God of Eloquence, and he may very

<P>VERSE 64. <HI>So wat'ry fowl.] Eu&s;tathius</HI> remarks, that this

Eagle, tho' the compari&s;on had been more noble, yet it had been
le&s;s proper; a &s;ea-fowl mo&s;t properly repre&s;ents the pa&s;&s;age of a

<P>Some ancient Critics mark'd the la&s;t ver&s;e <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with

that the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> did not &s;ufficiently expre&s;s the &s;wiftne&s;s

<P>VERSE 72. <HI>The Nymph he found. Homer</HI> here introduces an Epi|&s;ode
of <HI>Calyp&s;o;</HI> and as every Incident ought to have &s;ome relation
to the main de&s;ign of the Poem, it may be ask'd what relation this
bears to the other parts of it? A very e&s;&s;ential one: The &s;uffe|rings
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> are the &s;ubject of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> here we find him
inclos'd in an I&s;land: all his calamities ari&s;e from his ab&s;ence
from his own country: <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI> then who detains him is the
cau&s;e of all his calamities. It is with great judgment that the
Poet feigns him to be re&s;train'd by a Deity, rather than a mortal.
It might have appear'd &s;omewhat derogatory from the prudence
and courage of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> not to have been able by art or &s;trength
to have freed him&s;elf from the power of a mortal: but by this
conduct the Poet at once excu&s;es his Heroe, and aggravates his
misfortunes: he is detain'd involuntarily, but it is a Godde&s;s who
detains him, and it is no di&s;grace for a man not to be able to
over-power a Deity.</P>
<P><HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> ob&s;erves, that the art of Di&s;gui&s;e is part of the character
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> Now this is imply'd in the name of <HI>Calyp&s;o,</HI> which
&s;ignifies <HI>concealment,</HI> or <HI>&s;ecret.</HI> The Poet makes his Heroe &s;tay
&s;even whole years with this Godde&s;s; &s;he taught him &s;o well, that
he afterwards lo&s;t no opportunities of putting her in&s;tructions in
practice, and does nothing without di&s;gui&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Homer</HI> in this &s;peech of <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI> &s;hews very naturally how pa&s;&s;ion
mi&s;guides the under&s;tanding. She views her own cau&s;e in the

<HI>Jupiter</HI> offers a piece of inju&s;tice in commanding the departure
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> She tells <HI>Mercury,</HI> that it is &s;he who had pre&s;erv'd his

immortality; and would <HI>Jupiter</HI> thus repay her tenderne&s;s to <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es?</HI>
Would <HI>Jupiter</HI> force him from a place where nothing was
wanting to his happine&s;s, and expo&s;e him again to the like dan|gers
from which &s;he had pre&s;erv'd him? this was an act of cru|elty.
But on the contrary, &s;he &s;peaks not one word concerning
the truth of the cau&s;e: <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;he offer'd violence to the incli|nations

it as an act of conjugal infidelity, and a breach of Mo|rality
in <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> It would be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, that a Poet is
not oblig'd to draw a perfect character in the per&s;on of his He|roe:

ought not to be a&s;cribed to it in Poetry: Neither <HI>Achil|les</HI>

<P>But tho&s;e who have blam'd this pa&s;&s;age, form their judgments

Indeed <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had been no le&s;s than &s;even years in the fa|vour

of the pa&s;&s;ion, and then fail'd, Mr. <HI>Dryden's</HI> Critici&s;m

the occa&s;ion requir'd it, ina&s;much as the love of <HI>Dido</HI> contribu|ted
to the de&s;ign of the Poem; it brought about her a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
<HI>AEneas,</HI> and the pre&s;ervation of his companions: and con&s;equent|ly
the copiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Virgil</HI> is as judicious as the conci&s;ene&s;s of

<P><HI>VERSE</HI> 12. Where never &s;cience rear'd her lawrel'd head.]</P>
<P>_THE <HI>Phaeacians</HI> having a great &s;hare in the
&s;ucceeding parts of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> it may not
be improper to enlarge upon their chara|cter.
<HI>Homer</HI> has here de&s;crib'd them very
di&s;tinctly: he is to make u&s;e of the <HI>Phae|acians</HI>
to convey <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to his country,
he therefore by this &s;hort character, gives the
Reader &s;uch an Image of them, that he
is not &s;urpriz'd at their credulity and &s;implicity, in believ|ing
all tho&s;e fabulous recitals which <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> makes in the pro|gre&s;s
of the Poem. The place likewi&s;e in which he de&s;cribes
them is well cho&s;en; it is before they enter upon Action,
and by this method we know what to expect from them,
and &s;ee how every action is naturally &s;uited to their character.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="89">
<HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI> ob&s;erves that the Poet has in&s;erted this ver&s;e with great
judgment: <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;ays he, knew that the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> were &s;imple
and credulous; and that they had all the qualities of a lazy peo|ple,
who admire nothing &s;o much as romantic adventures: he
therefore plea&s;es them, by recitals &s;uited to their own humour:
But even here the Poet is not unmindful of his more under&s;tand|ing
Readers, and the truth intended to be taught by way of
moral is, that a &s;oft and effeminate life breaks the &s;pirit, and ren|ders
it incapable of manly &s;entiments or actions.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;eems to under&s;tand this ver&s;e in a different manner;
he quotes it in his di&s;&s;ertation upon Bani&s;hment, to &s;hew that <HI>Nau|&s;ithous</HI>
made his people happy tho' he left his own country, and
&s;ettled them far from the commerce of mankind, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
without any particular view to the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> which
was undoubtedly intended by <HI>Homer;</HI> tho&s;e words being a kind
of a Preface to their general character.</P>
<P>This <HI>Phaeacia</HI> of the ancients is the I&s;land now called <HI>Cor|fu.</HI>
The Inhabitants of it were a Colony of the <HI>Hyperians:
Eu&s;tathius</HI> remarks, that it has been a que&s;tion whether <HI>Hy|peria</HI>
were a City or an I&s;land; he judges it to be a Ci|ty:
it was infe&s;ted by the <HI>Cyclops;</HI> but they had no &s;hipping, as
appears from the 10th of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> and con&s;equently if it had
been an I&s;land, they could not have mole&s;ted the <HI>Phaeacians;</HI> he
therefore concludes it to be a City, afterwards call'd <HI>Camarina</HI> in
<HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Barnes</HI> has here added a ver&s;e that is not to be found in
any other edition; and I have render'd it in the tran&s;lation:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 24. <HI>Two nymphs the portals guard, each nymph a Grace.</HI>]
The Poet, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves, celebrates the beauty of the&s;e
two attending Virgins to rai&s;e their characters, that they may not be
e&s;teem'd common &s;ervants, or the Poet thought extravagant when
he compares <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> and her dam&s;els to <HI>Diana</HI> and her nymphs.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="90">
The judgment with which he introduces the vi&s;ion is remarkable:
In the <HI>Iliad,</HI> when he is to give an air of importance to his vi&s;ion,
he cloathes it in the likene&s;s of <HI>Ne&s;tor,</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t per&s;on of the Ar|my;
a man of le&s;s con&s;ideration had been un&s;uitable to the great|ne&s;s
of the occa&s;ion, which was to per&s;uade Kings and Heroes.
Here the Poet &s;ends a vi&s;ion to a young Lady, under the re&s;emblance
of a young Lady: he adapts the circum&s;tances to the per&s;on, and
de&s;cribes the whole with an agreeable propriety. <HI>Eu&s;tathius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 31. The &s;pou&s;al ornament neglected lies;</L>
<L>Ari&s;e, prepare the bridal train.]</L></Q>
<P>Here is a remarkable cu&s;tom of Antiquity. <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves,
that it was u&s;ual for the bride to give changes of dre&s;s to the
friends of the bridegroom at the celebration of the marriage, and
<HI>Homer</HI> directly affirms it. <HI>Dacier</HI> quotes a pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Judges</HI> con|cerning
<HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s giving changes of garments at his marriage fea&s;t,
as an in&s;tance of the like cu&s;tom among&s;t the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> but I
believe, if there was &s;uch a cu&s;tom at all among&s;t them, it is not
evident from the pa&s;&s;age alledg'd: Nothing is plainer than that
<HI>Samp&s;on</HI> had not given the garments, if his riddle had not been
expounded: nay, in&s;tead of giving, he him&s;elf had receiv'd them,
if it had not been interpreted. I am rather of opinion that what is
&s;aid of <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> has relation to another cu&s;tom among&s;t the Ancients,
of propo&s;ing an <HI>Aenigma</HI> at fe&s;tivals, and adjudging a reward to him
that &s;olv'd it. The&s;e the <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; <HI>gri|phos
convivales; Athenaeus</HI> has a long di&s;&s;ertation about this pra|cti&s;e
in his 10th book, and gives a number of in&s;tances of the
Aenigmatical propo&s;itions in u&s;e at <HI>Athens,</HI> and of the forfeitures
and rewards upon the &s;olution, and non-&s;olution of them; and
<HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> in the 10th book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> comes into the &s;ame,
opinion. So that if it was a cu&s;tom among&s;t the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> as
well as <HI>Greeks</HI> to give garments, (as it appears to be to give
other gifts) this pa&s;&s;age is no in&s;tance of it: It is indeed a proof
<PB N="94" REF="91">
that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> as well as <HI>Greeks</HI> had a cu&s;tom of entertain|ing
them&s;elves at their fe&s;tivals, with the&s;e <HI>griphi convivales:</HI> I
therefore believe that the&s;e changes of garments, were no more
than rewards or forfeits, according to the &s;ucce&s;s in the inter|pretation.</P>

<P>VERSE 33. <HI>A ju&s;t applau&s;e the cares of dre&s;s impart.</HI>] It is

<Q><L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,</L>

<P>What I would chiefly ob&s;erve is the propriety with which this
commendation of dre&s;s is introduc'd; it is put into the mouth
of a young Lady (for &s;o <HI>Pallas</HI> appears to be) to who&s;e character
it is &s;uitable to delight in Ornament. It likewi&s;e agrees very well
with the de&s;cription of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> who&s;e chief happine&s;s con|&s;i&s;ted
in dancing, dre&s;&s;ing, &s;inging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such a commenda|tion
of ornament would have been improper in the mouth of a

<DIV2 N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 35. <HI>Ha&s;te to the limpid &s;tream.</HI>] This pa&s;&s;age has
not e&s;cap'd the raillery of the Critics; <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;ay they, brings
the Godde&s;s of Wi&s;dom down from heaven, only to advi&s;e <HI>Nau|&s;icaa</HI>
to make ha&s;te to wa&s;h her cloaths again&s;t her wedding: what
nece&s;&s;ity is there for a conduct &s;o extraordinary upon &s;o trivial
an occa&s;ion? <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> &s;ufficiently an&s;wers the objection, by ob|&s;erving
that the Poet very naturally brings about the &s;afety of <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="92">
by it; the action of the wa&s;hing is the means, the prote|ction
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> the end of the de&s;cent of that Godde&s;s; &s;o that
&s;he is not introduced lightly, or without contributing to an im|portant
action: And it mu&s;t be allow'd that the means made u&s;e
of are very natural; they grow out of the occa&s;ion, and at once
give the fable a poetical turn, and an air of probability.</P>
<P>It has been further objected, that the Poet gives an unwor|thy
employment to <HI>Nau&s;icaa,</HI> the daughter of a King; but &s;uch
Critics form their idea of ancient, from modern greatne&s;s: It wou'd
be now a meane&s;s to de&s;cribe a per&s;on of Quality thus employ'd,
becau&s;e cu&s;tom has made it the work of per&s;ons of low conditi|on:
It would be now thought di&s;honourable for a Lady of bright
&s;tation to attend the flocks; yet we find in the mo&s;t ancient hi|&s;tory
extant, that the daughters of <HI>Laban</HI> and <HI>Jethro,</HI> per&s;ons of
power and di&s;tinction, were &s;o employ'd, without any di&s;honour
to their quality. In &s;hort, the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are to be look'd upon
as exact pictures of the old World, and con&s;equently as valua|ble
remains of Antiquity.</P>

impropriety to have render'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> by the word chariot;
<HI>Homer</HI> &s;eems indu&s;triou&s;ly to avoid <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, but con&s;tantly u&s;es
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; this car was drawn by mules; whereas, ob|&s;erves
<HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> the chariot or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> was proper only for hor&s;es.
The word Car takes in the Idea of any other vehicle, as well as
of a Chariot.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age has undergone a very &s;evere cen&s;ure, as mean
and ridiculous, chiefly from the expre&s;&s;ions to her father after|wards,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: which being render'd, <HI>high, and round,</HI>
di&s;grace the Author: No per&s;on, I believe, would ask a father
to lend his high and round Car; nor has <HI>Homer</HI> &s;aid it: <HI>Eu|&s;tathius</HI>
ob&s;erves, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is the &s;ame as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">

<PB N="96" REF="93">
or the quadrangular body
of the Car that re&s;ts upon the axle of it; this fully an&s;wers the
Critici&s;m: <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> de&s;cribes the Car &s;o particularly, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
it from a Chariot, which had been improper for her pur|po&s;e:
The other part of the objection, concerning the roundne&s;s
of the Car, is a mi&s;take in the Critic; the word having relation
to the wheels, and not to the body of it, which, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob|&s;erves,
was quadrangular.</P>

of <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> riding in her Car to the river, has exercis'd the pen|cils
of excellent Painters. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> in his fifth book, which

by Mules, of which the one guides the reins, the other has her

<P>It is evident, that the Ancients had ba&s;ons, or ci&s;terns, continu|ally
&s;upply'd by the rivers for this bu&s;ine&s;s of wa&s;hing; they were
call'd, ob&s;erves <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; and were &s;ometimes
made of marble, other times of wood. Thus in the <HI>Iliad,</HI>
book 22,
<Q><L>Each gu&s;hing fount a marble ci&s;tern fills,</L>
<L>Who&s;e poli&s;h'd bed receives the falling rills,</L>
<L><HI>Where</HI> Trojan <HI>dames ere yet alarm'd by</HI> Greece,</L>
<L>Wa&s;h'd their fair garments in the days of peace.</L></Q>
The manner of wa&s;hing was different from what is now in u&s;e:
They trod them with their feet, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. <HI>Eu|&s;tathius.</HI></P>
<P>It may be thought that the&s;e cu&s;toms are of &s;mall importance,
and of little concern to the pre&s;ent ages: It is true; but
Time has &s;tamp'd a value upon them: like ancient Medals,
their intrin&s;ic worth may be &s;mall, but yet they are valuable,
becau&s;e images of Antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> in his <HI>Sympo&s;iacs</HI> propo&s;es this que&s;tion, Why <HI>Nau&s;i|caa</HI>
wa&s;hes in the river, rather than the &s;ea, tho' it was more
nigh, more hot, and con&s;equently more fit for the purpo&s;e
than the river? <HI>Theon</HI> an&s;wers from <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> that the &s;ea-water
has many gro&s;s, rough, and earthy particles in it, as appears from
its &s;altne&s;s, whereas fre&s;h water is more pure and unmixt, and
con&s;equently more &s;ubtle and penetrating, and fitter for u&s;e in

wa&s;hing. <HI>Themi&s;tocles</HI> di&s;likes this rea&s;on, and affirms that &s;ea-water
being more rough and earthy, than that of rivers, is there|fore
the mo&s;t proper, for its clean&s;ing quality; this appears from
ob&s;ervation, for in wa&s;hing, a&s;hes or &s;ome &s;uch &s;ub&s;tance are
thrown into the fre&s;h water to make it effectual, for tho&s;e par|ticles
open the pores, and conduce to the effect of clean&s;ing.
The true rea&s;on then is, that there is an unctuous nature in &s;ea-water,
(and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> confe&s;&s;es all &s;alt to be unctuous) which hin|ders
it from clean&s;ing: whereas river-water is pure, le&s;s mixt, and
con&s;equently more &s;ubtle and penetrating, and being free from all
oily &s;ub&s;tance, is preferable and more effectual than &s;ea-water.</P>

is &s;aid in behalf of <HI>Homer</HI> in <HI>Aulus Gellius,</HI> and the an&s;wer by
<HI>Scaliger.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gellius</HI> writes, that it was the opinion of <HI>Valerius Probus,</HI> that
no pa&s;&s;age has been more unhappily copy'd by <HI>Virgil</HI> than this
compari&s;on. <HI>Homer</HI> very beautifully compares <HI>Nau&s;icaa,</HI> a Virgin,
&s;porting with her dam&s;els in a &s;olitary place, to <HI>Diana,</HI> a virgin
Godde&s;s, taking her diver&s;ion in a fore&s;t, in hunting with her ru|ral
<PB N="100" REF="97">
Nymphs. Whereas <HI>Dido,</HI> a widow, is drawn by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the
mid&s;t of a city, walking gravely with the <HI>Tyrian</HI> Princes, <HI>In&s;tans
operi, regni&s;que futuris,</HI> a circum&s;tance that bears not the lea&s;t re|&s;emblance
to the &s;ports of the Godde&s;s. <HI>Homer</HI> repre&s;ents <HI>Diana</HI>
with her quiver at her &s;houlder, but at the &s;ame time he de&s;cribes
her as an huntre&s;s: <HI>Virgil</HI> gives her a quiver, but mentions no|thing
of her as an huntre&s;s, and con&s;equently lays a needle&s;s bur|then
upon her &s;houlder. <HI>Homer</HI> excellently paints the fulne&s;s
of joy which <HI>Latona</HI> felt at the &s;ight of her daughter, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">;
<HI>Virgil</HI> falls infinitely &s;hort of it in the word
<HI>pertentant,</HI> which &s;ignifies a light joy that &s;inks not deep into the
heart. La&s;tly <HI>Virgil</HI> has omitted the &s;tronge&s;t point and very
flower of the compari&s;on,
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
'Tis the la&s;t circum&s;tance that compleats the compari&s;on, as it
di&s;tingui&s;hes <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> from her attendants, for which very pur|po&s;e
the allu&s;ion was introduced.</P>
<P><HI>Scaliger</HI> (who never de&s;erts <HI>Virgil</HI> in any difficulty) an&s;wers, that
the per&s;ons, not the places, are intended to be repre&s;ented by both
Poets; otherwi&s;e <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf is blameable, for <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> is not
&s;porting on a mountain but a plain, and has neither bow nor
quiver like <HI>Diana.</HI> Neither is there any weight in the objection
concerning the gravity of the gait of <HI>Dido;</HI> for neither is <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI>
de&s;crib'd in the act of hunting, but dancing: And as for the word
<HI>pertentant,</HI> it is a Metaphor taken from mu&s;icians and mu&s;ical
in&s;truments: it denotes a &s;trong degree of joy, <HI>per</HI> bears an inten|&s;ive
&s;en&s;e, and takes in the perfection of joy. As to the qui|ver,
it was an en&s;ign of the Godde&s;s, as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> was of
<HI>Apollo,</HI> and is apply'd to her upon all occa&s;ions indifferently, not
only by <HI>Virgil,</HI> but more frequently by <HI>Homer.</HI> La&s;tly, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is &s;uperfluous, for the joy of <HI>Latona</HI> compleats
the whole, and <HI>Homer</HI> has already &s;aid <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="98">
But &s;till it mu&s;t be allow'd, that there is a greater corre&s;pon|dence

<Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 133. Forth from her &s;nowy hand <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> threw</L>
<L>The various ball.]</L></Q>
<P>This Play with the Ball was called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, by the
Ancients; and from the &s;ignification of the word, which is <HI>de|ception,</HI>
we may learn the nature of the Play: The ball was
thrown to &s;ome one of the players unexpectedly, and he
as unexpectedly threw it to &s;ome other of the company to catch,
from which &s;urprize upon one another, it took the name of
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. It was a &s;port much in u&s;e among&s;t the Ancients, both
men and women; it caus'd a variety of motions in throwing,
and running, and was therefore a very healthful exerci&s;e. The <HI>La|cedaemonians</HI>
were remarkable for the u&s;e of it; <HI>Alexander</HI> the
Great frequently exerci&s;ed at it; and <HI>Sophocles</HI> wrote a Play, call'd
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>Lotrices;</HI> in which he repre&s;ented <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> &s;port|ing
with her dam&s;els at this play: It is not now extant.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="99">
<HI>Diony&s;idorus</HI> gives us a various reading, in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
he writes it, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which the <HI>Latins</HI> ren|der
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and <HI>Suidas</HI> countenances the alteration, for he writes
that a dam&s;el named <HI>Lari&s;&s;a,</HI> as &s;he &s;ported at this play, (<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
not <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) was drowned in the river <HI>Peneus. Eu&s;tathius.</HI></P>
<P>What I would further ob&s;erve is, the art of the Poet in car|rying
on the &s;tory: He proceeds from incident to incident very
naturally, and makes the &s;ports of the&s;e Virgins contribute to the
principal de&s;ign of the Poem, and promote the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> by di&s;covering him advantagiou&s;ly to the <HI>Phaeacians.</HI>
He &s;o judiciou&s;ly interweaves the&s;e &s;ports into the texture of the
&s;tory, that there would be a cha&s;m if they were taken away; and
the &s;ports of the Virgins are as much of a piece with the whole,
as any of the labours of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The Poet reaps a further advantage from this conduct: it beau|tifies
and enlivens the Poem with a plea&s;ant and entertaining
&s;cene, and relieves the Reader's mind by taking it off from a
continual repre&s;entation of horrour and &s;ufferings in the &s;tory of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> He him&s;elf &s;eems here to take breath, and indulging
his fancy, lets it run out into &s;everal beautiful compari&s;ons,

between <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Nau&s;icaa,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Rapine,</HI> outrages all the rules

mode&s;ty. Is there here any outrage of decency? Be&s;ides, what
takes off this objection of immode&s;ty in <HI>Nau&s;icaa,</HI> is, that
the &s;ight of a naked man was not unu&s;ual in tho&s;e ages; it
was cu&s;tomary for Virgins of the highe&s;t quality to attend He|roes
to the bath, and even to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bathing them, without any
breach of mode&s;ty; as is evident from the conduct of <HI>Po|lyca&s;te</HI>

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are of no weight; but &s;o many te&s;timonies of
her virtuous and compa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition, which induces
her to pity and relieve calamity. Yet it may &s;eem that the
other dam&s;els had a different opinion of this interview, and
that thro' mode&s;ty they ran away, while <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> alone talks
with <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> But this only &s;hews, not that &s;he had le&s;s mode&s;ty,
but more prudence, than her retinue; the dam&s;els fled not out
of mode&s;ty, but fear of an enemy: whereas <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> wi&s;ely re|flects
that no &s;uch per&s;on could arrive there, the country being
an I&s;land; and from his appearance, &s;he rightly concluded him

to the &s;tory of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> He de&s;cribes <HI>Alcinous</HI> and the peo|ple
of better rank, as per&s;ons of great ho&s;pitality and humanity,
this gives an air of probability to the free and benevolent recep|tion
which <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> found: He de&s;cribes the vulgar as excellent
navigators; and he does this not only becau&s;e they are I&s;landers;
but, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves, to prepare the way for the return of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who was to be re&s;tored by their conduct to his country,
even again&s;t the inclination of <HI>Neptune,</HI> the God of the Ocean.
But it may be ask'd, is not <HI>Homer</HI> incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, when
he paints the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> as men of the utmo&s;t humanity, and im|mediately
after calls them a proud unpoli&s;h'd race; and given up
to cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s? It is ea&s;y to reconcile the &s;eeming contradi|ction,
by applying the character of humanity to the higher rank
of the nation, and the other to the vulgar and the mariners. I
believe the &s;ame character holds good to this day among&s;t any
people, who are much addicted to &s;ea-affairs; they contract
a roughne&s;s, by being &s;ecluded from the more general con|ver&s;e
of mankind, and con&s;equently are &s;trangers to that affabi|lity
which is the effect of a more enlarg'd conver&s;ation.
But what is it that inclines the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> to be cen&s;orious? It is
to be remember'd, that they are every where de&s;crib'd as a people
abandon'd to idlene&s;s; To idlene&s;s therefore that part of their cha|racter

<P>This is an admirable picture of ancient female-life among the
Orientals; the Virgins were very retir'd, and never appear'd a|mong&s;t
men but upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, and then always
<PB N="117" REF="114">
in the pre&s;ence of the father or mother: But when they were
married, &s;ays <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> they had more liberty. Thus <HI>Helen</HI> con|verses
freely with <HI>Telemachus</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;i&s;tratus,</HI> and <HI>Penelope</HI> &s;ometimes
with the &s;uitors. <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> delivers her judgment &s;ententiou&s;ly, to
give it more weight; what can be more mode&s;t than the&s;e expre&s;&s;i|ons?
And yet they have been greatly traduc'd by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Perrault,</HI>
a <HI>French</HI> Critic; he tran&s;lates the pa&s;&s;age &s;o as to imply that &startq;<HI>Nau|&s;icaa</HI>
di&s;approves of a Virgin's lying with a man without the per|mi&s;&s;ion
of her father, before marriage;&endq; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> led him
into this mi&s;take, which is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in &s;uch a &s;ignification,
but here it only means <HI>Conver&s;ation:</HI> if the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ig|nified
more than keeping company, it would be more ridiculous,
as <HI>Boileau</HI> ob&s;erves upon <HI>Longinus,</HI> than <HI>Perrault</HI> makes it: for it
is join'd to <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and then it would infer that <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> di&s;ap|proves
of a young woman's lying with <HI>&s;everal men</HI> before &s;he was
married, without the licence of her father. The pa&s;&s;age, continues
<HI>Boileau,</HI> is full of honour and decency: <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> has a de&s;ign to
introduce <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to her father, &s;he tells him &s;he goes before to
prepare the way for his reception, but that &s;he mu&s;t not be &s;een
to enter the city in his company, for fear of giving offence, which
a mode&s;t woman ought not to give: A virtuous woman is obli|ged
not only to avoid immode&s;ty, but the appearance of it; and
for her part &s;he could not approve of a young woman keeping
company with men without the permi&s;&s;ion of her father or mo|ther,
before &s;he was married. Thus the indecency is not in <HI>Ho|mer,</HI>
but the Critic; it is indeed in <HI>Homer</HI> an excellent lecture of
Mode&s;ty and Morality.</P>

<P>We &s;ee the Ancients held a &s;ubordination among&s;t the Deities,

ob&s;erves, by <HI>Euripides,</HI> in his <HI>Hippolytus;</HI> where <HI>Diana</HI> &s;ays,
it is not the cu&s;tom of the Gods to re&s;i&s;t one the other, when
they take vengeance even upon the favourites of other Deities.
The late tempe&s;t that <HI>Neptune</HI> had rais'd for the de&s;truction of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> was an in&s;tance of <HI>Neptune</HI>'s implacable anger: this makes
<HI>Minerva</HI> take &s;uch mea&s;ures as to avoid an open oppo&s;ition, and
yet con&s;ult the &s;afety of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> She de&s;cends, but it is &s;ecretly.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON THE
SEVENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS book opens with the Introduction of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to <HI>Alcinous;</HI> every &s;tep the Poet takes
carries on the main de&s;ign of the Poem,
with a progre&s;s &s;o natural, that each incident
&s;eems really to have happen'd, and not to be
invention. Thus <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> accidentally meets
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and introduces him to <HI>Alcinous</HI> her
father, who lands him in <HI>Ithaca:</HI> It is po&s;&s;i|ble
this might be true Hi&s;tory; the Poet might build upon a real
foundation, and only adorn the truth with the ornaments of Poe|try.
It is to be wi&s;h'd, that a faithful Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Trojan</HI>
war, and the voyages of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> had been tran&s;mitted to po&s;teri|ty;
it would have been the be&s;t comment upon the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>O|dy&s;&s;ey.</HI>
We are not to look upon the Poems of <HI>Homer</HI> as meer
romances, but as true &s;tories, heighten'd and beautify'd by Poe|try:
<PB N="150" REF="144">
Thus the <HI>Iliad</HI> is built upon a real di&s;&s;ention, that happen'd
in a real war between <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Troy;</HI> and the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> upon
the real voyages of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and the di&s;orders that happen'd thro'
his ab&s;ence in his own country. Nay, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but
that many of tho&s;e incidents that &s;eem mo&s;t extravagant in <HI>Ho|mer,</HI>
might have an appearing truth, and be ju&s;tify'd by the opi|nions,
and mi&s;taken credulity of tho&s;e ages. What is there in
all <HI>Homer</HI> more &s;eemingly extravagant, than the &s;tory of the race
of the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> with one broad eye in their foreheads? and yet, as
Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> very judiciou&s;ly conjectures, this may be built
upon a &s;eeming truth: They were a people of <HI>Sicily</HI> remarkable
for &s;avagene&s;s and cruelty, and perhaps might in their wars make
u&s;e of a headpiece or Vizor, which had but one &s;ight in it, and
this might give occa&s;ion to &s;ailors who coa&s;ted tho&s;e &s;hores to
mi&s;take the &s;ingle &s;ight of the Vizor, for a broad eye in the fore|head,
e&s;pecially when they before look'd upon them as mon&s;ters
for their barbarity. I doubt not but we lo&s;e many beauties in
<HI>Homer</HI> for want of a real hi&s;tory, and think him extravagant,
when he only complies with the opinions of former ages. I
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make this ob&s;ervation, as a general vindi|cation
of <HI>Homer;</HI> e&s;pecially in this place, immediately before he
enters upon the relation of tho&s;e &s;tories which have been thought
mo&s;t to outrage credibility: if then we look upon the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI>
as all fiction, we con&s;ider it unworthily; it ought to be read as
a &s;tory founded upon truth, but adorn'd with the embelli&s;hments
of Poetry, to convey in&s;truction with plea&s;ure the more effe|ctually.</P>

<P>VERSE 10. Eurymedu&s;a <HI>nam'd.] Eu&s;tathius</HI> remarks, that
the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> were people of great commerce, and that it was
cu&s;tomary in tho&s;e ages to exchange &s;laves in traffic; or perhaps
<HI>Eurymedu&s;a</HI> might be a captive, pyracy then being honourable,
and &s;uch &s;eizures of cattle or &s;laves frequent. The pa&s;&s;age con|cerning
<PB N="151" REF="145">
the brothers of <HI>Nau&s;icaa</HI> has not e&s;caped the cen&s;ure of
the Critics; <HI>Homer</HI> in the original calls them <HI>like Gods,</HI> and yet in
the &s;ame breath gives them the employment of &s;laves, they unyoke
the Mules, and carry into the Palace the burthens they brought.
A twofold an&s;wer may be given to this objection, and this con|duct
might proceed from the general cu&s;tom of the age, which
made &s;uch actions reputable; or from the particular love the bro|thers
bore their &s;i&s;ter, which might induce them to act thus, as
an in&s;tance of it.</P>

<P>VERSE 20. <HI>Around him &s;pread a veil of thicken'd air.]</HI> It may
be ask'd what occa&s;ion there is to make <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> invi&s;ible? <HI>Eu|&s;tathius</HI>
an&s;wers, not only to pre&s;erve him from in&s;ults as he was

ON THE
EIGHTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS book has been more &s;everely cen&s;ur'd
by the Critics than any in the whole <HI>O|dy&s;&s;ey:</HI>
It may therefore be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to lay before the Reader what may
be offer'd in the Poet's vindication.</P>
<P><HI>Scaliger</HI> in his <HI>Poetics</HI> is very warm again&s;t
it. <HI>Demodocus,</HI> ob&s;erves that Critic, &s;ings
the lu&s;ts of the Gods <HI>(foeditates)</HI> at the fea&s;t
of <HI>Alcinous.</HI> And <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> tho' he vindicates the Poet, remarks that
we meet with &s;ome offen&s;ive pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Homer,</HI> and in&s;tances in
the adultery of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>To know (&s;ays <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>) whether a thing
be well or ill &s;poken, we mu&s;t not only examine the thing whe|ther
it be good or ill, but we mu&s;t al&s;o have regard to him that
<PB N="214" REF="206">
&s;peaks or acts, and to the per&s;on to whom the Poet addre&s;&s;es:
for the character of the per&s;on who &s;peaks, and of him to whom
he &s;peaks, makes that to be good, which would not come well
from the mouth of any other per&s;on. 'Tis on this account
we vindicate <HI>Homer</HI> with re&s;pect to the Immorality that is found
in the fable of the Adultery of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus:</HI> We mu&s;t con|&s;ider
that it is neither the Poet, nor his Heroe, that recites that
&s;tory: but a <HI>Phaeacian</HI> &s;ings it to <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> a &s;oft effeminate peo|ple,
at a fe&s;tival. Be&s;ides, it is allowable even in grave and mo|ral
writings to introduce vicious per&s;ons, who de&s;pi&s;e the Gods;
and is not the Poet oblig'd to adapt his Poetry to the characters
of &s;uch per&s;ons? And had it not been an ab&s;urdity in him to
have given us a Philo&s;ophical or Moral &s;ong before a people who
would be pleas'd with nothing but gaiety and effeminacy? The
Moral that we are to draw from this &s;tory is, that an idle and
&s;oft cour&s;e of life is the &s;ource of all criminal plea&s;ures; and that
tho&s;e per&s;ons who lead &s;uch lives, are generally pleas'd to hear
&s;uch &s;tories, as make their betters partakers in the &s;ame vices.
This relation of <HI>Homer</HI> is a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to them who de&s;ire to
live virtuou&s;ly; and it teaches, that if we would not be guilty of
&s;uch vices, we mu&s;t avoid &s;uch a method of life as inevitably
leads to the practice of them.</P>
<P><HI>Rapine</HI> attacks this book on another &s;ide, and blames it not
for its Immorality, but Lowne&s;s. <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;ays he, puts off that
air of grandeur and maje&s;ty which &s;o properly belongs to his
character, he deba&s;es him&s;elf into a Droll, and &s;inks into a fami|liar
way of talking: he turns things into ridicule, by endeavour|ing
to entertain his Reader with &s;omething plea&s;ant and divert|ing:
For in&s;tance, in the eighth book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> he enter|tains
the Gods with a Comedy, &s;ome of whom he makes buf|foons:
<HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> are introduced upon the &s;tage, taken in
a net laid by <HI>Vulcan,</HI> contrary to the gravity which is &s;o e&s;&s;ential
to Epic Poetry.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be granted, that the Gods are here painted in colours
unworthy of Deities, yet &s;till with propriety, if we re&s;pect the
<PB N="215" REF="207">
&s;pectators, who are ignorant, debauch'd <HI>Phaeacians, Homer</HI> was
oblig'd to draw them not according to his own idea of the Gods,
but according to the wild fancies of the <HI>Phaeacians.</HI> The Poet
is not at liberty to a&s;cribe the wi&s;dom of a <HI>Socrates</HI> to <HI>Alcinous:</HI>
He mu&s;t follow Nature, and like a painter he may draw Deities
or mon&s;ters, and introduce as he plea&s;es either vicious or virtuous
characters, provided he always makes them of a piece, con&s;i&s;tent
with their fir&s;t repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>This rule of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in general vindicates <HI>Homer,</HI> and 'tis ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to carry it in our minds, becau&s;e it ought to be apply'd
to all incidents that relate to the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> in the &s;equel of the

<P>VERSE 19. Pallas <HI>with grace divine his frame improves.]</HI> This
circum&s;tance has been repeated &s;everal times almo&s;t in the &s;ame
words, &s;ince the beginning of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> I cannot be of opi|nion
that &s;uch repetitions are beauties. In any other Poet, they
might have been thought to proceed from a poverty of inventi|on,
tho' certainly not in <HI>Homer,</HI> in whom there is rather a &s;uper|fluity
than barrenne&s;s. Perhaps having once &s;aid a thing well, he
de&s;pair'd of improving it, and &s;o repeated it; or perhaps he in|tended
to inculcate this truth, that all our accompli&s;hments, as
beauty, &s;trength, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the gifts of the Gods; and being wil|ling
to fix it upon the mind, he dwells upon it, and in&s;erts it
in many places. Here indeed it has a particular propriety, as it
is a circum&s;tance that fir&s;t engages the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> in the favour
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> his beauty was his fir&s;t recommendation, and con&s;e|quently
the Poet with great judgment &s;ets his Heroe off to the
be&s;t advantage, it being an incident from which he dates all his
future happine&s;s; and therefore to be in&s;i&s;ted upon with a parti|cular
&s;olemnity. <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Theaetetus</HI> applies the latter part of

<P>VERSE 25. <HI>From his glitt'ring throne</HI> Alcinous <HI>ro&s;e.]</HI> It might
be expected that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> upon who&s;e account alone <HI>Alcinous</HI> calls
this a&s;&s;embly, &s;hould have made his condition known, and &s;poken
him&s;elf to the <HI>Phaeacians;</HI> whereas he appears upon the &s;tage as
a mute per&s;on, and the multitude departs entirely ignorant of
his name and fortunes. It may be an&s;wer'd, that this was not a
proper time for a fuller di&s;covery, the Poet defers it 'till <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
had di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf in the games, and fully rais'd
their curio&s;ity. It is for the &s;ame rea&s;on that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is &s;ilent; if
he had &s;poken he could not have avoided to let them into the
knowledge of his condition, but the contrary method is greatly
for his advantage, and a&s;&s;ures him of &s;ucce&s;s from the recom|mendation
of a King.</P>
<P>But there is another, and perhaps a better rea&s;on, to be given
for this &s;ilence of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> The Poet re&s;erves the whole &s;tory of
his &s;ufferings for an entire and uninterrupted narration; if he
had now made any di&s;covery, he mu&s;t afterwards either have
fall'n into tautology, or broken the thread of the relation, &s;o that
it would not have been of a piece, but wanted continuity. Be|&s;ides,
it comes with more weight at once, than if it had been
made at &s;everal times, and con&s;equently makes a deeper impre&s;|&s;ion
upon the memory and pa&s;&s;ion of the auditors. <HI>Virgil</HI> has
taken a different method in the di&s;covery of <HI>Aeneas;</HI> there was a
nece&s;&s;ity for it; his companions, to engage <HI>Dido</HI> in their protecti|on,
tell her they belong to no le&s;s a Heroe than <HI>Aeneas,</HI> &s;o that
he is in a manner known before he appears; but <HI>Virgil</HI> after the

'Tis true, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves, that there are many features in

<P>If this be true, it mu&s;t be allow'd that <HI>Homer</HI> has found out

<P>It is remarkable, that <HI>Homer</HI> takes a very extraordinary care
of <HI>Demodocus</HI> his brother Poet; and introduces him as a per&s;on
of great di&s;tinction. He calls him in this book the Heroe <HI>Demo|docus:</HI>
He places him on a throne &s;tudded with &s;ilver, and gives
him an herald for his attendant; nor is he le&s;s careful to provide
for his entertainment, he has a particular table, and a capacious
bowl &s;et before him to drink as often as he had a mind, as
the original expre&s;&s;es it. Some merry wits have turn'd the la&s;t
circum&s;tance into raillery, and in&s;inuate that <HI>Homer</HI> in this place

a man may die of an Apoplexy, this is probable; but that
this &s;hould happen ju&s;t when the Poet has occa&s;ion for it, is

con&s;ider not only that the war of <HI>Troy</HI> was the greate&s;t e|vent
of tho&s;e ages, and con&s;equently might be the com|mon
&s;ubject of entertainment; but al&s;o that it is not <HI>Homer</HI> or
<HI>Demodocus</HI> who relates the &s;tory, but the Mu&s;e who in&s;pires it:
<HI>Homer</HI> &s;everal times in this book a&s;cribes the &s;ong to immediate
in&s;piration; and this &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance reconciles it to human
probability, and the &s;tory becomes credible when it is &s;uppos'd
to be related by a Deity. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Poetics</HI> commends this
conduct as artful and judicious; <HI>Alcinous,</HI> &s;ays he, invites <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
to an entertainment to divert him, where <HI>Demodocus</HI> &s;ings his a|ctions,

his own brave atchievements, e&s;pecially when nothing calamitous
is recited? This indeed would be improbable, if that were the
whole of what the Poet &s;ung: But <HI>Homer</HI> only gives us the heads
of the &s;ong, a few sketches of a larger draught, and leaves &s;ome|thing
to be fill'd up by the imagination of the reader. Thus
for in&s;tance the words of <HI>Demodocus</HI> recall'd to the mind of <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
all the hard&s;hips he had undergone during a ten years war,
all the &s;cenes of horror he had beheld, and the lo&s;s and &s;ufferings of
all his friends. And no doubt he might weep even for the calamities
he brought upon <HI>Troy,</HI> an ingenuous nature cannot be in&s;en&s;ible
when any of its own &s;pecies &s;uffers; the <HI>Trojans</HI> were his enemies,

becau&s;e the dancers mov'd to the &s;ound of the harp and the

danc'd, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, an Hi&s;tory; that is, by their ge|&s;tures

and voice de&s;cribed, and the dance was a repre&s;entation of what
was the &s;ubject of the Poet's &s;ong. <HI>Homer</HI> only &s;ays they danc'd
divinely, according to the obvious meaning of the words. I fan|cy
Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> would have forborn her ob&s;ervation, if &s;he had
reflected upon the nature of the &s;ong to which the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>
danc'd: It was an intrigue between <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus;</HI> and they
being taken in &s;ome very odd po&s;tures, &s;he mu&s;t allow
that the&s;e dancers repre&s;ented &s;ome very odd ge&s;tures, (or

teaching by mute actions, and tho&s;e very fables that have given

but time, or the &s;un, reveals it. But the Poet him&s;elf
far better explains the meaning of his fable, for he teaches that
light mu&s;ic and wanton &s;ongs debauch the manners, and
incline men to an unmanly way of living in luxury and
wantonne&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, <HI>Virgil</HI> mentions this &s;tory, <HI>Ovid</HI> tran&s;lates it, <HI>Plutarch</HI>

thought the ver&s;es very beautiful. For they thought it not pro|bable
that <HI>Alcinous</HI> would have call'd to memory this prediction
and the menace of <HI>Neptune,</HI> and yet per&s;i&s;ted to conduct to his
own country the enemy of that Deity: Whereas if this oracle be
&s;uppo&s;ed to be forgotten by <HI>Alcinous,</HI> (as it will, if the&s;e ver&s;es be
taken away) then there will be an appearance of truth, that he
who was a friend to all &s;trangers, &s;hould be per&s;uaded to land &s;o
great and worthy a Heroe as <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in his own dominions, and

<L>But this the Gods may fru&s;trate or fulfill,</L>
<L>As &s;uits the purpo&s;e of th' eternal will.</L></Q>
And therefore the ver&s;es may be very proper in this book, for
<HI>Alcinous</HI> believes that the Gods might be prevailed upon not to
fulfill this denunciation. It has been likewi&s;e remark'd that the
conduct of <HI>Alcinous</HI> is very ju&s;tifiable: The <HI>Phaeacians</HI> had been
warn'd by an oracle, that an evil threaten'd them for the care
they &s;hould &s;hew to a &s;tranger; yet they forbear not to perform
an act of piety to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> being per&s;uaded that men ought to
do their duty, and tru&s;t the i&s;&s;ue to the goodne&s;s of the Gods.
This will &s;eem to be more probable, if we remember <HI>Alcinous</HI>
is ignorant that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is the per&s;on intended by the prediction,
&s;o that he is not guilty of a voluntary oppo&s;ition to the Gods,

with the common laws of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>It is but a conjecture, yet it is not without probability, that
there was a rock which look'd like a ve&s;&s;el, in the entrance of
the haven of the <HI>Phaeacians:</HI> the fable may be built upon this

had a &s;oul &s;u&s;ceptible of real friend&s;hip; and was a lover of
&s;incerity. It would be endle&s;s to take notice of every ca&s;ual in|&s;truction

to have been a man of an amiable character, as well as excellent
in Poetry: The great abhorrence he had of Lies cannot be more
&s;trongly expre&s;t than in tho&s;e two pa&s;&s;ages in the ninth <HI>Iliad,</HI> and
in the 14th <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> In the fir&s;t of which he makes the man of
the greate&s;t &s;oul, <HI>Achilles,</HI> bear te&s;timony to his aver&s;ion of them;
and in the latter declares, that &ldquo;the poore&s;t man, tho' compell'd by
the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, ought not to &s;toop to &s;uch a practice&rdquo;. In
this place he &s;hews that worth creates a kind of relation, and that
we are to look upon a worthy friend, as a brother.</P>

<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_AS we are now come to the Epi&s;odical part
of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> it may be thought nece&s;|&s;ary
to &s;peak &s;omething of the nature of
Epi&s;odes.</P>
<P>As the action of the Epic is always one,
entire, and great Action; &s;o the mo&s;t trivi|al
Epi&s;odes mu&s;t be &s;o interwoven with it,
as to be nece&s;&s;ary parts, or convenient,
as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> ob&s;erves, to carry on the
main de&s;ign: either &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, as without them the Poem mu&s;t
be imperfect, or &s;o convenient, that no others can be imagin'd
more &s;uitable to the place in which they &s;tand: There is no|thing
to be left void, in a firm building, even the cavities ought
not to be fill'd up with rubbi&s;h de&s;tructive to the &s;trength of it,
but with materials of the &s;ame kind, tho' of le&s;s pieces, and fit|ted
to the main fabric.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="279">
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> tells us, that what is comprehended in the fir&s;t plat|form
of the fable is proper, the re&s;t is Epi&s;ode: Let us exa|mine
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> by this rule: The groundwork of the Poem is,
a Prince ab&s;ent from his country &s;everal years, <HI>Neptune</HI> hinders
his return, yet at la&s;t he breaks thro' all ob&s;tacles, and re|turns,
where he finds great di&s;orders, the Authors of which he
puni&s;hes, and re&s;tores peace to his kingdoms. This is all that is
e&s;&s;ential to the model; this the Poet is not at liberty to change;
this is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that any alteration de&s;troys the de&s;ign, &s;poils
the fable, and makes another Poem of it. But Epi&s;odes are
changeable; for in&s;tance, tho' it was nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> being
ab&s;ent &s;hould &s;pend &s;everal years with foreign Princes, yet it was
not nece&s;&s;ary that one of the&s;e Princes &s;hould be <HI>Antiphates,</HI> ano|ther
<HI>Alcinous,</HI> or that <HI>Circe</HI> or <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI> &s;hould be the per&s;ons who
entertain'd him: It was in the Poet's choice to have chang'd the&s;e
per&s;ons and &s;tates, without changing his de&s;ign or fable. Thus tho'
the&s;e adventures or Epi&s;odes become parts of the &s;ubject after they
are cho&s;en, yet they are not originally e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ubject. But
in what &s;en&s;e then are they nece&s;&s;ary? The reply is, Since the ab|&s;ence
of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, it follows that not being
at home, he mu&s;t be in &s;ome other country; and therefore tho'
the Poet was at liberty to make u&s;e of none of the&s;e particular
adventures, yet it was not in his choice to make u&s;e of none at
all; if the&s;e had been omitted, he mu&s;t have &s;ub&s;tituted others,
or el&s;e he would have omitted part of the matter contain'd in his
model, <HI>viz.</HI> the adventures of a per&s;on long ab&s;ent from his
country; and the Poem would have been defective. So that Epi|&s;odes
are not actions, but parts of an action. It is in Poetry, as
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ob&s;erves, as in Painting; a Painter puts many actions
into one piece, but they all con&s;pire to form one entire and per|fect
Action: A Poet likewi&s;e u&s;es many Epi&s;odes, but all tho&s;e
Epi&s;odes taken &s;eparately fini&s;h nothing, they are but imperfect
members, which all together make one and the &s;ame action, like
the parts of a human body, they all con&s;pire to con&s;titute the
whole man.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="280">
In a word, the Epi&s;odes of <HI>Homer</HI> are compleat Epi&s;odes; they
are proper to the &s;ubject, becau&s;e they are drawn from the ground
of the fable; they are &s;o joyn'd to the principal action, that one
is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the other, either truly or probably:
and la&s;tly, they are imperfect members which do not make a
compleat and fini&s;h'd body; for an Epi&s;ode that makes a com|pleat
action, cannot be part of a principal action, as is e&s;&s;ential
to all Epi&s;odes.</P>
<P>An Epi&s;ode may then be defin'd, &ldquo;a nece&s;&s;ary part of an action,
extended by probable circum&s;tances.&rdquo; They are part of an action,
for they are not added to the principal action, but only dilate
and amplify that principal action: Thus the Poet to &s;hew the
&s;ufferings of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> brings in the &s;everal Epi&s;odes of <HI>Polyphemus,
Scylla,</HI> the <HI>Sirens, &amp;c.</HI> But why &s;hould the words &ldquo;extended
by probable circum&s;tances&rdquo; enter the definition? Becau&s;e the
Sufferings of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> are propos'd in the model of the Fable in
general only, but by relating the circum&s;tances, the manner how
he &s;uffer'd is di&s;cover'd, and this connects it with the principal
action, and &s;hews very evidently the nece&s;&s;ary relation the Epi|&s;ode
bears to the main de&s;ign of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> What I have &s;aid
I hope plainly di&s;covers the difference between the Epi&s;odic and
Principal action, as well as the nature of Epi&s;odes. See <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI>
more largely upon this &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 3. <HI>How &s;weet the products of a peaceful reign,</HI> &amp;c.]
This pa&s;&s;age has given great joy to the Critics, as it has afforded
them the ill-natur'd plea&s;ure of railing, and the &s;atisfaction of be|lieving
they have found a fault in a good Writer. It is fitter,
&s;ay they, for the mouth of <HI>Epicurus</HI> than for the &s;age <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> to
extol the plea&s;ures of fea&s;ting and drinking in this manner: He
whom the Poet propo&s;es as the &s;tandard of human Wi&s;dom, &s;ays
<HI>Rapine,</HI> &s;uffers him&s;elf to be made drunk by the <HI>Phaeacians.</HI> But it
may rather be imagin'd, that the Critic was not very &s;ober when
he made the reflection; for there is not the lea&s;t appearance of a
<PB N="308" REF="281">
rea&s;on for that imputation. <HI>Plato</HI> indeed in his third book <HI>de
Repub.</HI> writes, that what <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> here &s;peaks is no very proper ex|ample
of temperance: but every body knows that <HI>Plato,</HI>
with re&s;pect; to <HI>Homer,</HI> wrote with great partiality. <HI>Athenae|us</HI>
in his 12th book gives us the following interpretation. <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
accommodates his di&s;cour&s;e to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; he in
appearance approves of the voluptuous lives of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI>
and having heard <HI>Alcinous</HI> before &s;ay, that fea&s;ting and &s;inging,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> was their &s;upreme delight; he by a &s;ea&s;onable flattery &s;eems
to comply with their inclinations: it being the mo&s;t proper me|thod
to attain his de&s;ires of being convey'd to his own country.
He compares <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to the <HI>Polypus,</HI> which is fabled to a&s;&s;ume the
colour of every rock to which he approaches: Thus <HI>Sophocles,</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</L></Q>
That is, &startq;In your acce&s;&s;es to mankind ob&s;erve the <HI>Polypus,</HI>
and adapt your &s;elf to the humour of the per&s;on to whom
you apply.&endq; <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves that this pa&s;&s;age has been
condemn'd, but he defends it after the very &s;ame way with
<HI>Athenaeus.</HI></P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible but there may be &s;ome compliance
with the nature and manners of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> e&s;pecially be|cau&s;e
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is always de&s;crib'd as an artful man, not with|out
&s;ome mixture of di&s;&s;imulation: But it is no difficult mat|ter
to take the pa&s;&s;age literally, and yet give it an irreproach|able
&s;en&s;e. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had gone thro' innumerable calamities, he had
liv'd to &s;ee a great part of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> laid de&s;olate by a
bloody war; and after &s;o many troubles, he arrives among a na|tion
that was unacquainted with all the mi&s;eries of war, where all
the people were happy, and pa&s;s'd their lives in ea&s;e and plea&s;ures:
this calm life fills him with admiration, and he artfully prai&s;es
what he found prai&s;e-worthy in it; namely, the entertainments
and mu&s;ic, and pa&s;&s;es over the gallantries of the people, as <HI>Da|cier</HI>
ob&s;erves, without any mention. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> fully vin|dicates
<PB N="309" REF="282">
<HI>Homer.</HI> It is my opinion, &s;ays that Author, that the
Poet, by repre&s;enting the&s;e gue&s;ts in the mid&s;t of their entertain|ment,
delighted with the &s;ong and mu&s;ic, intended to recom|mend
a more noble plea&s;ure than eating or drinking, &s;uch a plea|&s;ure
as a wi&s;e man may imitate, by approving the better part,
and rejecting the wor&s;e, and chu&s;ing to plea&s;e the ear rather than
the belly. 12 <HI>Di&s;&s;ert.</HI></P>
<P>If we under&s;tand the pa&s;&s;age otherwi&s;e, the meaning may
be this. I am per&s;uaded, &s;ays <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> that the mo&s;t agreeable end
which a King can propo&s;e, is to &s;ee a whole nation in univer&s;al
joy, when mu&s;ic and fea&s;tings are in every hou&s;e, when plenty is
on every table, and wines to entertain every gue&s;t; This to me
appears a &s;tate of the greate&s;t felicity.</P>
<P>In this &s;en&s;e <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> pays <HI>Alcinous</HI> a very agreeable compliment;
as it is certainly the mo&s;t glorious aim of a King to make his
&s;ubjects happy, and diffu&s;e an univer&s;al joy thro' his domi|nions:
He mu&s;t be a rigid Cen&s;or indeed who blames &s;uch plea|&s;ures
as the&s;e, which have nothing contrary in them to Virtue
and &s;trict Morality; e&s;pecially as they here bear a beautiful op|po&s;ition
to all the horrors which <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had &s;een in the wars of
<HI>Troy,</HI> and &s;hew <HI>Phaeacia</HI> as happy as <HI>Troy</HI> was mi&s;erable. I will
only add, that this agrees with the oriental way of &s;peaking; and
in the Poetical parts of the Scriptures, the voice of melody,
fea&s;ting, and dancing, are u&s;ed to expre&s;s the happine&s;s of a nation,</P>

<DIV2 N="3">
<HEAD>III</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 19. <HI>Behold</HI> Uly&s;&s;es!&mdash;] The Poet begins with
declaring the name of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> had already been
acquainted with it by the &s;ong of <HI>Demodocus,</HI> and therefore
it could not fail of rai&s;ing the utmo&s;t attention and curio&s;i|ty
(as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves) of the whole a&s;&s;embly, to hear the
&s;tory of &s;o great an Heroe. Perhaps it may be thought that <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es</HI>
is o&s;tentatious, and &s;peaks of him&s;elf too favourably; but
the nece&s;&s;ity of it will appear, if we con&s;ider that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had no|thing
<PB N="310" REF="283">
but his per&s;onal qualifications to engage the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> in
his favour. It was therefore requi&s;ite to make tho&s;e qualificati|ons
known, and this was not po&s;&s;ible to be done but by his own
relation, he being a &s;tranger among &s;trangers. Be&s;ides, he &s;peaks
before a vain-glorious people, who thought even boa&s;ting no
fault. It may be que&s;tion'd whether <HI>Virgil</HI> be &s;o happy in the&s;e
re&s;pects, when he puts almo&s;t the &s;ame words into the mouth of
<HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Sum pius Aeneas, raptos qui ex ho&s;te penates</L>
<L>Cla&s;&s;e veho mecum, famd &s;uper aethera notus.</L></Q>
<P>For his boa&s;t contributes nothing to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his
affairs, for he &s;peaks to the Godde&s;s <HI>Venus.</HI> Yet <HI>Scaliger</HI> infi|nitely

at a lo&s;s where to begin, how to proceed, or where to end; and
<PB N="311" REF="284">
they agree very well with the propo&s;ition in the opening of the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> which was to relate the &s;ufferings of a brave man. The
ver&s;es which <HI>Scaliger</HI> quotes are

&s;ome under&s;tand it to &s;ignify that it lies low; others explain
it to &s;ignify that it is of a low po&s;ition, but high with re&s;pect: to

the &s;pace of ten years, &s;ince <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> wa&s;tes &s;o many in his return;
and is not this contrary to the nature of Epic Poetry, which is
agreed mu&s;t not at the longe&s;t exceed the duration of one year,
or rather Campaign? The an&s;wer is, the Poet lets all the time
pa&s;s which exceeds the bounds of Epic action, before he opens
the Poem; thus <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;pends &s;ome time before he arrives at the

this method he reduces the duration of it into le&s;s compa&s;s than
the &s;pace of two months. This conduct is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary,
for from the time that the Poet introduces, his Heroe upon the

he may never afterwards appear idle or out of motion: This is veri|fied
in <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> from the moment he leaves the I&s;land <HI>Ogygia</HI> to the
death of the Suitors, he is never out of view, never idle; he is always
either in action, or preparing for it, 'till he is re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd in his

That is, &startq;<HI>Phrixus</HI> commands thee to call his &s;oul into his own

went to the &s;hores and calling thrice on their names, rais'd a Ce|notaph

thou&s;and every day, if in nine days he &s;ail'd to the <HI>Lotophagi.</HI>
This objection would be unan&s;werable, if we place that nation in
the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean, but <HI>Dacier</HI> ob&s;erves from <HI>Strabo,</HI> that <HI>Polybius</HI>
examin'd this point, and thus gives us the re&s;ult of it. This great

the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean, as he does the I&s;lands of <HI>Circe</HI> and <HI>Calyp&s;o,</HI>

in ten days a good wind will carry a ve&s;&s;el from <HI>Malea</HI> into the

<P>This is an in&s;tance that <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ometimes follows truth without

they continually a&s;cribe his deviations from truth, (as in the in|&s;tance

various kinds of it. It has been a que&s;tion whether it is a herb,
a root, or a tree: He is of opinion, that <HI>Homer</HI> &s;peaks of it as an
herb; for he calls it <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and that the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
is in its proper &s;en&s;e apply'd to the grazing of bea&s;ts, and
therefore he judges it not to be a tree, or root. He adds,
there is an <HI>Aegyptian Lotos,</HI> which as <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirms, grows
in great abundance along the <HI>Nile</HI> in the time of its inun|dations;
it re&s;embles (&s;ays that Hi&s;torian in his <HI>Euterpe</HI>) a
Lilly, the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> dry it in the &s;un, then take the pulp out
of it, which grows like the head of a poppy, and bake it as bread;
this kind of it agrees likewi&s;e with the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of <HI>Homer.
Athenaeus</HI> writes of the <HI>Libyan Lotos</HI> in the 14th book of
his <HI>Deipno&s;ophi&s;t;</HI> he quotes the words of <HI>Polybius</HI> in the 12th
book of his Hi&s;tory, now not extant; that Hi&s;torian &s;peaks of it
as an eye-witne&s;s, having examin'd the nature of it. &startq;The <HI>Lotos</HI>
is a tree of no great height, rough and thorny: it bears a green
leaf, &s;omewhat thicker and broader than that of the bramble or
briar; its fruit at fir&s;t is like the ripe berries of the myrtle, both
in &s;ize and colour, but when it ripens it turns to purple; it is
then about the bigne&s;s of an olive, it is round, and contains a
very &s;mall kernel; when it is ripe they gather it, and brui&s;ing it
among bread-corn, they put it up into a ve&s;&s;el, and keep it as
food for their &s;laves; they dre&s;s it after the &s;ame manner for their
other dome&s;tics, but fir&s;t take out the kernel from it: It has the
ta&s;te of a fig, or dates, but is of a far better &s;mell: They like|wi&s;e
make a wine of it, by &s;teeping and brui&s;ing it in water; it
<PB N="317" REF="290">
has a very agreeable ta&s;te, like wine temper'd with honey. They
drink it without mixing it with water, but it will not keep above
ten days, they therefore make it only in &s;mall quantities for immedi|ate
u&s;e.&endq; Perhaps it was this la&s;t kind of <HI>Lotos,</HI> which the com|panions

The <HI>Greeks</HI> (who under&s;tood not the <HI>Phaeacian</HI> language) form'd
the word <HI>Cyclop,</HI> from <HI>Chek-lub,</HI> from the affinity of &s;ound; which

only of a more gigantic &s;tature, and of a barbarous and &s;avage

as a Poet, and what as an Hi&s;torian; he paints the&s;e people in ge|neral
agreeably to their per&s;ons, only di&s;gui&s;es &s;ome features, to
give an ornament to his relation, and to introduce the Marvel|lous,
which demands a place chiefly in Epic Poetry.</P>
<P>What <HI>Homer</HI> &s;peaks of the fertility of <HI>Sicily,</HI> is agreeable to Hi|&s;tory:
It was call'd anciently <HI>Romani Imperii Horreum. Pliny,</HI> lib. 10.

the culture of the husbandman; he was an eye-witne&s;s, being
a native of the I&s;land. From hence in general it may be ob&s;erv'd,
that where-ever we can trace <HI>Homer,</HI> we find, if not hi&s;toric truth,

le&s;s brutal; as the fear of the Deluge wore away by degrees, they
de&s;cended toward the bottom of mountains, and began to have &s;ome
intercour&s;e: The third was more poli&s;h'd; when a full &s;ecurity from
the apprehen&s;ions of a flood was e&s;tabli&s;h'd by time, they then
began to inhabit the plains, and a more general commerce by de|grees

to the te&s;timony both of prophane and &s;acred Hi&s;tory: Thus

people, and tall as the <HI>Zamzummims.</HI>&endq; Thus <HI>Goliath</HI> mu&s;t be al|low'd
to be a Giant, for he was &s;ix cubits and a &s;pan, that is,
nine feet and a &s;pan in height; his coat of mail weigh'd five
thou&s;and &s;hekels of bra&s;s, about one hundred and fifty
<PB N="324" REF="297">
pounds; (but I confe&s;s others under&s;tand the le&s;&s;er Shekel$)
the head of his &s;pear alone weigh'd &s;ix hundred &s;hekels of
iron, that is about eighteen or nineteen pounds. We find
the like relations in prophane Hi&s;tory: <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his life
of <HI>The&s;eus</HI> &s;ays, that age was productive of men of pro|digious
&s;tature, Giants. Thus <HI>Diodorus Siculus; Aegyptii &s;cri|bunt,
I&s;idis aetate, fui&s;&s;e va&s;to corpore homines, quos Graeci dix|ere
Gigantes. Herodotus</HI> affirms that the body of <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI> was
dug up, and appear'd to be &s;even cubits long; but <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI>
believes this to be an error. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> writes, <HI>l.</HI> 18. <HI>cap.</HI> 6. that
<HI>Vitellius</HI> &s;ent a <HI>Jew</HI> named <HI>Eleazar,</HI> &s;even cubits in height, as a
pre&s;ent from <HI>Artabanus</HI> King of the <HI>Parthians,</HI> to <HI>Tiberius Cae&s;ar;</HI>

place, 6. 30. <HI>Sybortas, gentem Aethiopum Nomadum, octona cubi|ta

<P>Thus it is evident, that there have been men of very extraor|dinary
&s;tature in former ages. Tho' perhaps &s;uch in&s;tances were
not frequent in any age or any nation. So that <HI>Homer</HI>
only amplifies, not invents; and as there was really a people call'd
<HI>Cyclopeans,</HI> &s;o they might be men of great &s;tature, or giants.</P>

and hope to be pardon'd for a conjecture which may
give a &s;eeming rea&s;on how &s;uch &s;tories came to prevail. The
<HI>Greeks</HI> were a people of very great antiquity; they made many

Colonies: Now the head of every Colony was call'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and the&s;e
adventurers being per&s;ons of great figure in &s;tory, were recorded
as men of war, of might and renown, thro' the old world:
It is therefore not impo&s;&s;ible but the <HI>Hebrews</HI> might form their,
word <HI>Anac,</HI> from the <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and u&s;e it to denote per&s;ons

<PB N="325" REF="298">

This particular has that effect, it repre&s;ents Nature, and therefore

<P>VERSE 569. <HI>It almo&s;t bru&s;h'd the helm,</HI> &amp;c.] The An|cients,
remarks <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> placed an Obelisk and A&s;teri&s;m be|fore
this ver&s;e; the former, to note that they thought it mi&s;-placed;
the latter, to &s;hew that they look'd upon it as a beauty. Appa|rently
it is not agreeable to the de&s;cription; for how is it po&s;&s;i|ble
that this huge rock, falling <HI>before</HI> the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould endanger
<PB N="332" REF="305">
the rudder, which is in the &s;tern? Can a &s;hip &s;ail with the &s;tern
foremo&s;t? Some ancient Criticks to take away the contradiction,
have a&s;&s;erted that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> turn'd his &s;hip to &s;peak to <HI>Polypheme;</HI>
but this is ab&s;urd, for why could not <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;peak from the &s;tern
as well as from the prow? It therefore &s;eems that the ver&s;e ought
to be entirely omitted, as undoubtedly it may without any cha&s;m
in the Author. We find it in&s;erted a little lower, and there it
corre&s;ponds with the de&s;cription, and &s;tands with propriety.</P>
<P>But if we &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;hip of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> lay at &s;uch a di&s;tance
from the cave of <HI>Polypheme,</HI> as to make it nece&s;&s;ary to bring it
nearer, to be heard di&s;tinctly; then indeed we may &s;olve the dif|ficulty,
and let the ver&s;e &s;tand; for if we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> ap|proaching
toward <HI>Polypheme,</HI> then the rock may be &s;aid to be
thrown before the ve&s;&s;el, that is, beyond it, and endanger the
rudder, and this bears &s;ome appearance of probability.</P>

<P>If <HI>Polypheme</HI> had really this quality of running upon the waves,

<P>VERSE 603. <HI>Not this weak pigmy-wretch</HI>&mdash;] This is &s;poken
in compliance with the character of a Giant; the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> won|der'd
at the manly &s;tature of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es, Polypheme</HI> &s;peaks of him as a
dwarf; his rage undoubtedly made him treat him with &s;o much
contempt. Nothing in nature can be better imagin'd than this
&s;tory or the <HI>Cyclops,</HI> if we con&s;ider the a&s;&s;embly before which it
was &s;poken, I mean die <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> who had been driven from their
habitation by the <HI>Cyclopeans,</HI> as appears from the &s;ixth of the <HI>O|dy&s;&s;ey,</HI>
<PB N="334" REF="307">
and compell'd to make a new &s;ettlement in their pre&s;ent
country: <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> gratifies them by &s;hewing what revenge he took
upon one or their ancient enemies, and they could not decently
refu&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a per&s;on, who had puni&s;h'd tho&s;e who had in|&s;ulted

might deter the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> from a&s;&s;i&s;ting in his tran&s;portation, yet
brings this very circum&s;tance as an argument to induce them to
it. O Neptune, <HI>&s;ays the</HI> Cyclop, <HI>de&s;troy</HI> Uly&s;&s;es, <HI>or if he be fated

for his own &s;hips were de&s;troy'd by <HI>Neptune,</HI> and now he was

in gratitude for his deliverance; an in&s;tance of piety to be
imitated in more enlighten'd ages.</P>
<P>The book concludes with a te&s;timony of this Heroe's huma|nity;
in the mid&s;t of the joy for his own &s;afety, his generous

<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has borrow'd this Epi&s;ode of <HI>Polyphemus,</HI> and in&s;erted it

excellencies. <HI>Rapine</HI> confe&s;&s;es this Epi&s;ode to be equal to
any parts of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> that it is an original, and that <HI>Homer</HI> intro|duced
that mon&s;trous character, to &s;hew the Marvellous, and paint
it in a new &s;et of colours. <HI>Demetrius Phalereus</HI> calls it a piece of
Sublime &s;trangely horrible: and <HI>Longinus,</HI> even while he is con|demning
the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> allows this adventure of <HI>Polypheme</HI> to be ve|ry
great and beautiful; (for &s;o Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boileau</HI> under&s;tands <HI>Lon|ginus,</HI>
tho' Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier</HI> differs from his judgment.) In <HI>Homer</HI>
we find a greater variety of natural incidents than in <HI>Virgil,</HI> but
in <HI>Virgil</HI> a greater pomp of ver&s;e: <HI>Homer</HI> is not uniform in his
de&s;cription, but &s;ometimes &s;toops perhaps below the dignity of
Epic Poetry; <HI>Virgil</HI> walks along with an even, grave, and ma|je&s;tic
pace: They both rai&s;e our admiration, mix'd with delight
and terror.</P>
