<HEAD>TO THE KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it is the happy privilege of all the dutiful &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h empire, without regard to rank or di&s;tinction, to addre&s;s their &s;ove|reign, it can be no pre&s;umption in one who wi&s;hes well to the Revolu|tion, and the illu&s;trious family of Brun&s;wick, though remote from the throne, thus to addre&s;s your Maje&s;ty. To wi&s;h well to the rightful &s;overeign of the&s;e kingdoms, is the duty of all Prote&s;tants; and the hap|pine&s;s of a Prince ruling by law, <HI>ought to be</HI> the prayer of all good &s;ub|jects. A reflection upon the unhappine&s;s of former times, when <HI>tyran|ny,</HI> and the <HI>iron rod of arbitrary power,</HI> ruled over the&s;e realms, makes the dutiful &s;ubjects of your Maje&s;ty rejoice, that they are, by the <HI>glo|rious Hanoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;et free from the apprehen&s;ions of <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious &s;lavery.</HI></P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty's <HI>true</HI> friends will always join the glorious Revolution, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of your family to the throne of the&s;e kingdoms, in their united thank&s;givings to Heaven; and never forget the 5th of No|vember, and the glorious fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, when Popery and arbitrary power were <HI>&s;o effectually baffled.</HI></P>
<P>The warm expre&s;&s;ions of heart-felt joy, which your &s;ubjects loudly manife&s;ted at your acce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Great Britain, could not but declare to all the world, how happy they were, in having a Pro|te&s;tant Prince born among them to be their King. Your Maje&s;ty's gracious &s;peech on that occa&s;ion was received with raptures through|out the whole empire, and all ranks and degrees of your &s;ubjects were tran&s;ported with your royal &s;entiments.</P>
<P>There have been few &s;overeigns, &s;ince the fir&s;t in&s;titution of govern|ment, that have had all the &s;atisfaction they could have de&s;ired: <HI>Mi&s;|under&s;tandings</HI> and <HI>mi&s;managements,</HI> in <HI>high</HI> and <HI>low,</HI> are common in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human nature. It requires a more exalted &s;tate of exi&s;tence, than any rank of beings in this &s;y&s;tem arrive at, to be perfect. The &s;ubject of this hi&s;tory, thus addre&s;&s;ed to your Maje&s;ty, is a palpa|ble proof of the <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> and <HI>imperfection</HI> of mortals in this world.</P>
<P>The far greater part of your Maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects, are much af|flicted for the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of the pre&s;ent unhappy contention in the Briti&s;h empire, and from <HI>their hearts</HI> earne&s;tly pray, that it may be &s;peedily at an end; that your Maje&s;ty may enjoy the &s;weets of peace, and the real plea&s;ure of ruling a dutiful and happy people.</P>
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
<P>Hi&s;tory mu&s;t record the events that happen in time, that future ages may know what has pa&s;&s;ed in former periods of the world, and take an example and warning from the tran&s;actions of their predece&s;&s;ors. An Hi&s;torian &s;hould know no party, but record truth. <HI>Adulation</HI> and <HI>flattery,</HI> as well as <HI>rancor</HI> and <HI>prejudice,</HI> are incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of an hone&s;t hi&s;torian. The author pre&s;umes that your Maje&s;ty will meet with none of the&s;e in this Hi&s;tory. Love of liberty, and of his &s;ove|reign, has made him write freely; and if he have any ruling prejudice, it is in favour of his <HI>Country,</HI> his <HI>King,</HI> and <HI>the Law.</HI> Your Maje&s;ty will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to accept of this humble addre&s;s of a &s;ubject, who is &s;incerely attached to the Brun&s;wick family; who loves his King and country, values liberty and religion, and reveres the Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution; who &s;incerely wi&s;hes that your Maje&s;ty, your royal con&s;ort, and family, may live long. that it may be your happine&s;s to rule with wi&s;|dom live in tranquillity, and make your &s;ubjects happy,&mdash;and at la&s;t enjoy a kingdom, incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away;</P>

<P>WAR, though of all things the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to the human &s;pecies, and contrary to the original dictates of nature, has in all ages of the world filled up a great part of the hi&s;tory of nations. The laws and con&s;titutions of kingdoms, and the improvements of virtue and &s;cience, make a &s;mall figure in the an|nals of empires, when compared with the ponderous volumes that contain the atchievements of &s;oldiers, and the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of war. The works of Archimedes, Socrates, and Plato; the laws of Solon and other eminent legi&s;lators, fill up but a few pages in compari&s;on of the hi&s;tory of the wars of Greece and Rome. It is cu&s;tom that renders the mo&s;t di&s;|agreeable things familiar, makes things di&s;gu&s;tful at
<PB N="6" REF="6">fir&s;t, afterwards plea&s;ant; and &s;tamps the mo&s;t aban|doned of all actions with the epithet of glory. The glory of war is a creature of the imagination; often formed by caprice, nur&s;ed by policy, and manumitted by public authority; when yet this unnatural creature of fancy, in&s;tead of promoting public or private happi|ne&s;s, is the torment of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and the uni|ver&s;al bane of all &s;ociety. A thir&s;t after this glory, and a propen&s;ity for renown in martial exploits, have made fruitful countries a wilderne&s;s, cities a de&s;ola|tion, and empires &s;cenes of &s;laughter; this unnatural appetite drags the parent from his family, the children from their parents, renders the widow de&s;olate, the children fatherle&s;s, and the father without offspring. Hence it becomes glorious to thir&s;t for blood, an honour to &s;poil our neighbours, and the dignity of men to live by rapine. It is magnanimity to fall at the command of princes; and to return maimed from battle, though in an unju&s;t cau&s;e, is accounted bravery in the lowe&s;t individual. By giving fal&s;e names and epithets to things, and by frequently repeating them as matters of the highe&s;t importance, they at la&s;t leave an impre&s;&s;ion which becomes a principle of action in the minds of &s;uch as do not examine them.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent war in America &s;eems to have pro|ceeded from two general cau&s;es; an exce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire of dominion in government, and an exceeding great jealou&s;y in the people of the colonies, of mini&s;te|rial de&s;igns again&s;t their natural rights and liber|ties. It cannot be di&s;puted that the legi&s;lature in Great Britain, as well as the executive power, by modern &s;tatutes of parliament, which had all the ap|pearance of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and domination, gave &s;ufficient ground of jealou&s;y to the colonies. From the pre|tence of expences and di&s;bur&s;ements, laid out for the
<PB N="7" REF="7">defence of America, the government of the mother country claimed a right of internal taxation, unknown to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; and proceeded to frame new laws, which in their own nature declared that the &s;ole right of legi&s;lation remained in the parliament of England. In this ca&s;e the &s;ubjects of the empire in that we&s;tern part of the world were con&s;idered, not as other &s;ubjects, but as va&s;&s;als, under ab&s;olute autho|rity, to a legi&s;lature, in which they had none to repre|&s;ent them, and who were not under &s;ufficient obliga|tions to pay regard to their intere&s;t. The late war with France and Spain, had added an enormous weight of debt to our former national burdens, and the peace that was but lately concluded had given us an ad|dition of territory, without making us any richer than we were before. As &s;oon as peace gave the nation time to reflect, it was found that the flattering ideas of conque&s;t could not remove the feelings, which the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o many millions of debt, had impre&s;&s;ed on our national con&s;titution. It was expected that our debts would have been le&s;&s;ened, our taxes reduced, and our burdens lightened; but the hot fever of war had &s;o relaxed the &s;olids of the body politic, and weakened the whole frame of the con&s;titution, that the nation &s;oon after the ratification of the peace, ap|peared in the &s;econd &s;tage of a con&s;umption. The conductors of the la&s;t &s;tages of the war, who had only proceeded upon the plan which a mini&s;ter, the glory of his country, had formed before, were obliged ig|nominiou&s;ly to drop it, for want of credit and capacity to carry it on; and ratified a peace as inglorious as the war had been &s;ucce&s;sful. Though an indifferent peace is preferable to even a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tate of war, yet when a nation is laden with a burden of enormous debt, contracted for its own defence again&s;t a perver&s;e ene|my,
<PB N="8" REF="8">wi&s;dom and political prudence, will certainly vin|dicate a nation, in making their enemies, when they are in their power, pay as much of the debt contract|ed as it is po&s;&s;ible to obtain from them. The nego|tiators of the peace were con&s;idered by the nation as men unfriendly to the common intere&s;t, and per&s;ons, who, when they were &s;en&s;ible of their incapacity to carry on the war, were determined to conclude a peace, with as much advantage to their own private intere&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. Demands which might have pro|tracted a war, which they neither had genius nor cre|dit to carry on, were indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided, and the more mild requi&s;itions of private douceurs were &s;up|po&s;ed to have been adopted. Whether this jealou&s;y of the nation proceeded from a &s;u&s;picion founded in di&s;tru&s;t, or from &s;ignatures which implied moral cer|tainty, I will not pretend to determine; but it was the general opinion of the people at that period, that the French mini&s;try purcha&s;ed the peace, and that &s;ome per&s;ons of no &s;mall di&s;tinction in England, received the price thereof. What gave more weight to the&s;e &s;u&s;pi|cions of the people on this occa&s;ion was, that their fa|vourite mini&s;ter, who had recovered the nation from di&s;grace, and exalted it to an high pitch of glory and renown, had for &s;ome time been di&s;placed, through the influence of the royal favourite, who now was &s;up|po&s;ed to manage all the &s;prings of government. It is &s;o &s;eldom that a prime mini&s;ter is univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, that when &s;uch a phaenomenon happens in the politi|cal world, it mu&s;t be an unpopular action in a &s;ove|reign, to turn him out of office, without &s;etting forth &s;ome con&s;picuous acts of his mal-admini&s;tration. The whole tran&s;actions concerning the peace, being car|ried on by men of different complexions and charac|ters from their former mini&s;ter, afforded ground of
<PB N="9" REF="9">&s;u&s;picion, that neither the inclinations of the &s;ubjects, nor the intere&s;t of the nation, were regarded by the &s;overeign and his mini&s;ters. On this account, many things incon&s;i&s;tent with candour and charity, were &s;urmi&s;ed, and oftentimes publicly affirmed, for which there was no certain proof, nor the lea&s;t public evi|dence. It will not from hence follow, that the op|po&s;ition of the nation to the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;ter, proceeded from a &s;pirit of faction and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s; for while the people &s;aw a man at the helm who knew to &s;teer his cour&s;e with wi&s;dom and &s;ucce&s;s, they voluntarily gave both him and his ma&s;ter all due honour and applau&s;e. They con&s;idered the removal of this favourite from his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice as a public di&s;re&s;pect &s;hewn to the national approbation; and concluded, that &s;ome new ideas of <HI>favouriti&s;m</HI> ruled in the cabinet, unknown in the two former reigns. It was &s;aid that the former mini&s;ter was haughty, that his ambition was boundle&s;s, that he wanted to rule both the king and the nation, and that he had not &s;hewn that re&s;pect to his &s;overeign which became a &s;er|vant. The&s;e reflections were grounded upon his re|fu&s;ing to &s;erve jointly in the cabinet, and in the mini|&s;try, with men who&s;e principles he abhorred, and of who&s;e abilities he had no opinion. He had propo&s;ed to reach a blow to Spain at a time when her beha|viour was equivocal, that would have in&s;tantly made her feel, and prevented a tedious war, which after|wards was carried on at a great expence of blood and trea&s;ure: But this propo&s;al was rejected, as unfair and ungenerous, and not con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of na|tions. Fruitle&s;s queries were &s;ent, and equivocal an&s;wers returned, till the Spani&s;h &s;lota arrived, and then the court of Madrid pulled off the ma&s;k. From this Lord Chatham concluded, that it was impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="10" REF="10">to carry on a war with &s;ucce&s;s, or to manage the na|tional affairs with honour, jointly with men, who either through partiality or want of capacity, were on every occa&s;ion to be a clog to his mea&s;ures; and as re&s;pon|&s;ibility was connected with his office, he found it dan|gerous to unite with partners who would be ready to impute their own blunders to his management, and then &s;helter them&s;elves under the protection of the royal favour. What, therefore, many have attribu|ted to his pride, would rather appear to have pro|ceeded from his &s;agacity, and his di&s;cernment of the character of tho&s;e that were propo&s;ed to be joined with him in the management of public affairs.</P>
<P>The di&s;content which had for &s;ome time raged in the nation on account of &s;o di&s;advantageous a peace, after a &s;ucce&s;sful war, was &s;carcely abated, when ano|ther alarm was given by a new duty impo&s;ed on cyder and perry, at the rate of four &s;hillings the hog&s;head. This, though as rea&s;onable as many other taxes upon the nece&s;&s;aries of life, rai&s;ed a prodigious ferment in tho&s;e counties in England, where the&s;e commodities are in the greate&s;t abundance. Such was the oppo&s;i|tion made to this new law, that the legi&s;lature was o|bliged, for the &s;ake of the quiet of the nation, three years after, to repeal it. This conde&s;cen&s;ion of the parliament and the legi&s;lative powers, though it a&s;|&s;uaged the torrent of clamour and outrage, which was increa&s;ed to a great pitch, had not all the effects that might have been expected. The nation con&s;ider|ed the repeal of this law to proceed more from the weakne&s;s of the mini&s;try, than from a &s;incere de&s;ire in the legi&s;lature to make the &s;ubjects ea&s;y: The re|&s;cinding this act therefore, rather encrea&s;ed their pre&s;umption, than conciliated their affections: They were &s;till ready to join in new clamours when the
<PB N="11" REF="11">&s;malle&s;t occa&s;ion was given. When mini&s;ters of &s;tate once fall under a &s;u&s;picion of behaving in an arbitrary manner, there is &s;carcely any of their actions, how|ever innocent, that pa&s;s without cen&s;ure from tho&s;e in oppo&s;ition: And the public at large, who are al|ways jealous of their own liberties, are for the mo&s;t part ready to &s;upport &s;uch as appear to be on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>The government, &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the peace, had been ca&s;ting about and projecting &s;everal &s;chemes, for rai&s;ing a revenue to &s;upport the credit of the mother country, by contriving ways and means to rai&s;e &s;ums to pay the intere&s;t of the national debt; but as the number of pen&s;ioners were not reduced, and many enormous &s;ums were paid to places of <HI>&s;inecure,</HI> all the methods that had as yet been devi&s;ed were found ineffectual to an&s;wer the intentions of the mi|ni&s;try. They began at la&s;t to turn their attention to a new &s;ubject, which in conclu&s;ion brought on di&s;or|ders in the empire, and has at la&s;t i&s;&s;ued in civil war and the revolt of thirteen colonies. As the merchants in Britain had been enriched by their traffic in America, and government had for many years received a large re|venue from the trade of that country; the mini&s;ters be|gan to imagine that there was an inexhau&s;tible fund of riches and wealth in the colonies, to an&s;wer their pre|&s;ent purpo&s;e, as well as to be adequate for future emergencies. Without examining &s;trictly into the con&s;equences which might follow a too precipitate determination in a point &s;o <HI>new</HI> and &s;o <HI>delicate,</HI> they agreed to rai&s;e a new revenue in the colonies from an inland taxation. But before they proceeded to this dangerous and critical point, the legi&s;lature of Great Britain did in 1764, impo&s;e a new tax upon America, to the amount of &pound;. 341,377 0 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 1 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> This was
<PB N="12" REF="12">to be totally rai&s;ed by new impo&s;ts and duties upon her trade and commerce; and though the &s;everal duties impo&s;ed were principally rai&s;ed from articles of luxury, yet this law was a great re&s;traint upon the trade of America. But what is the wor&s;t part of this new act of parliament, it permits litigious informations and law &s;uits, where the per&s;ons who&s;e property has been unju&s;tly &s;eized, have no damages, provided the court &s;hall determine that there was a probability of the charge brought again&s;t them being true. This was a mean to give an handle to ill-natured per&s;ons, who knew they were in no danger, to di&s;tre&s;s inno|cent people, and put them to a great deal of unne|ce&s;&s;ary expences.</P>
<P>There is one proceeding of parliament which can|not be reconciled with the principles of either ju&s;tice or &s;ound policy. After a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the foreign articles of luxury imported into America, they proceeded to re&s;train the coloni&s;ts from exporting their &s;uperfluous commodities to the Spani&s;h and French colonies. This trade, which had been formerly winked at, though not &s;trictly agreeable to the laws of trade and navigation, was of great advantage to both the colo|lonies and the mother country. Tho&s;e articles which would have been as lumber upon their hands, and could not have been u&s;eful to Great Britain, were &s;old to the Spaniards and French for ready money, or bartered for valuable commodities, for which there is always a demand in Europe. This enabled the co|lonies to pay their bills in &s;pecie to the merchants at home, or to afford them &s;uch merchandize as was equivalent to ready money. The advantage in this ca&s;e was mutual, and both Great Britain and her colonies were profited by the traffic. What were the &s;ecret &s;prings of action which moved the Briti&s;h legi|&s;lature
<PB N="13" REF="13">to prefer this impolitic &s;tatute, is not ea&s;y to perceive, unle&s;s by li&s;tening to the reports of Briti&s;h We&s;t India merchants, who might conceive that it would enable the French and Spaniards to under&s;ell them at foreign markets, and of con&s;equence reduce their profits, they were &s;educed to give way to their &s;olicitations. It is &s;ufficiently evident that this trade was a real benefit to all the three parties concerned. In the time of war it had been carried on by flags of truce between Great Britain and France, as a public benefit to both, till the French We&s;t India i&s;lands being &s;hut up by our fleets, it was conceived that the French had more advantage by it than England, and for that rea&s;on it was re&s;trained as a trea&s;onable practice. But this la&s;t rea&s;on of re&s;traint had no ex|i&s;tence after the peace was concluded, and ought therefore to have been taken off in&s;tead of receiving fre&s;h parliamentary confirmation.</P>
<P>Unrea&s;onable as this law may appear to be, the method of putting it in execution was &s;till more ab|&s;urd and oppre&s;&s;ive. A number of armed cutters were fitted out and &s;tationed upon the coa&s;ts of Ame|rica, to prevent this &s;uppo&s;ed contraband trade, the captains of which were to act in the character of reve|nue officers, and to determine what &s;hips were liable to the penalties of this act, and what exempt from them. The greate&s;t part of the&s;e new naval re|venue officers, were totally &s;trangers to the nature of their employment. They were ready frequently to detain &s;hips which came not within the de&s;cription of the act, as being unacquainted with the character of the commodities with which they were loaded: And by unnece&s;&s;ary detention of trading ve&s;&s;els, interrupted trade, without bringing any thing into the trea&s;ury. When, through their ignorance or in&s;olence, a law|ful
<PB N="14" REF="14">trader was injured, it was not ea&s;y to obtain re|dre&s;s; the offenders lived upon an element where ju|&s;tice and law has often little influence: and when they came a&s;hore, it was in bodies too numerous to be called to an account by the civil officers; or in places where their actions were not cognizable by the law, and where they were certain they &s;hould not meet their accu&s;ers. The lords of the admiralty, or of the trea&s;ury, in England, could only remove this grievance; but con&s;idering the di&s;tance of place, and the manner of application, the whole trade might have been ruined before redre&s;s could have been ob|tained. This was a grievance which the American &s;ubjects felt &s;everely, and was likely to produce no favourable ideas in their minds concerning the Bri|ti&s;h legi&s;lature. The many unju&s;t acts of violence that happened on this occa&s;ion tended much to irritate the minds of both parties, and when they repre&s;ent|ed their ca&s;es, it was frequently with great acrimony and aggravations. Self-intere&s;t had a powerful &s;way on both &s;ides, and the truth was not ea&s;ily di&s;covered by comparing &s;uch oppo&s;ite repre&s;entations. The Engli&s;h parliament might have ea&s;ily fore&s;een the&s;e con&s;equences, had they not been infatuated with the ideas of revenue, and exa&s;perated by &s;ome late irritating events. The majority in the hou&s;e of com|mons, but e&s;pecially the mini&s;try, were yet &s;marting &s;ore, from the blows they had received from the North Britain, and other political pa&s;quinades. A &s;e|cretary of &s;tate had been al&s;o the year before, legally fined in a court of ju&s;tice in the penalty of a thou&s;and pounds, for i&s;&s;uing a general warrant, which government was &s;uppo&s;ed to have di&s;bur&s;ed; and con&s;idering the low|ne&s;s of the exchequer, every &s;uch touch increa&s;ed the painful feelings of the mini&s;try. They &s;eemed in a &s;tate
<PB N="15" REF="15">of di&s;traction, when they pa&s;&s;ed this law of re&s;traint upon the trade of America; and it had more the ap|pearance of an act of political fury, than the marks of judicious legi&s;lation. It could an&s;wer no other purpo&s;es than to a&s;&s;ert the dominion of parliament over America, and to irritate the colonies again&s;t the mother country. Ever &s;ince the mini&s;try of Mr Pitt, the nation had been in a &s;tate of confu&s;ion, with re|gard to political &s;entiments, and the oppo&s;ition in par|liament again&s;t Lord Bute, was echoed through all England. In 1763 his lord&s;hip re&s;igned his office as fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury, and was &s;ucceeded by Mr Grenville; but the contentions continued, and during this new mini&s;try, political animo&s;ity came to a great height. It was at this time that the American colo|nies began to feel the oppre&s;&s;ive hand of the mother country. She had not only prevented the Americans from procuring the nece&s;&s;aries of life, with the &s;uper|fluities of their own country, but obliged them to make payment in &s;pecie to the exchequer in England for the duty on &s;uch goods as they were allowed to trade in. This was an effectual method of draining the whole money from the colonies, and leaving them nothing for circulation: and what was &s;till more op|pre&s;&s;ive, two weeks after the bill now mentioned was pa&s;&s;ed, another was preferred to hinder the di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed colonies from &s;upplying the demand of money for their internal nece&s;&s;ities with paper bills of cre|dit, and that no &s;uch bills &s;hould be a legal tender for payment; to this was added that &s;uch paper bills as were pa&s;&s;ing in currency &s;hould after a limited time be called in and &s;unk. This was an exertion of au|thority beyond all bounds of ju&s;tice and equity; for it was impo&s;&s;ible that the Americans without trade, money, or paper credit, could pay any thing at all.
<PB N="16" REF="16">It was indeed affirmed that all the money rai&s;ed from the abovementioned duties, was to be applied for defraying the expences of protecting the colonies where it was levied, and that at the &s;ame time that a law was made to re&s;train the increa&s;e of paper cur|rency, &s;everal new laws were preferred to encourage and increa&s;e the commerce of the colonies with the mother country. The laws here referred to were, an act for granting leave for a limited time, for car|rying rice from the provinces of South Carolina and Georgia to other parts of America, on paying Bri|ti&s;h duties:&mdash;an act for granting a bounty upon the importation of hemp, and rough and undre&s;&s;ed flax, from the American colonies into Great Britain; and another to encourage the whale fi&s;hery on their coa&s;ts. All this &s;uppo&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, that the Ame|ricans were either not judges of their own affairs, or that they had no ju&s;tor legal right to judge of, or inter|fere with, their own trade. A more abject and &s;er|vile &s;ituation can &s;carcely well be imagined, than is implied in this idea. The whole of this proceeding implies that nothing in cour&s;e of trade and commerce was to be allowed to the Americans, except what brought immediate profit, and advantage to Great Britain. The laws that were at this time made in behalf of the colonies, had no proportion in their in|fluence, as to any advantage, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e re&s;traints that were laid upon their trade by the other &s;tatutes. The effects of the one were &s;low and pro|gre&s;&s;ive, but the other was in&s;tantaneous and imme|diately felt. The colonies could not help feeling im|mediately the effects of cramping their dome&s;tic bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and foreign commerce, by not only hindering them from receiving money from &s;trangers, for their &s;uperfluities, to &s;upply their immediate calls, but for|bidding
<PB N="17" REF="17">them to make any at home; whereas the laws pretended to compen&s;ate the&s;e di&s;advantages, were both uncertain and remote in their effects; &s;o di&s;tant that it might be many years before any benefit could ari&s;e from them, and might in conclu&s;ion produce no effect at all. This was a partiality in the legi&s;lature, &s;ufficient to create a jealou&s;y in the minds of the colo|ni&s;ts, that the parliament of Britain con&s;idered them not as fellow-&s;ubjects, but as inferior va&s;&s;als, not to be regarded in the &s;ame manner as the &s;ubjects of the mother country. A people that are re&s;trained from gaining money by trading with others, and are not permitted to have any of their own, are in &s;uch a &s;itu|ation as the con&s;titution of England totally di&s;ap|proves. Unle&s;s the Americans had lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, it was impo&s;&s;ible but they &s;hould have con&s;idered the&s;e acts of the legi&s;lature as <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive.</HI></P>
<P>It has been alledged that the greate&s;t part of the money, if not the whole of it, ari&s;ing from the&s;e du|ties, would return to the colonies to pay the troops quartered there for their defence. This is a mere allegation; for if the money collected from duties in America had been intended merely for paying the troops quartered there, there was no occa&s;ion to &s;end it to the Briti&s;h exchequer to ri&s;k the danger of &s;eas in &s;ending it back again to America. This would have been a piece of meer wantonne&s;s, fir&s;t to di&s;tre&s;s the colonies in collecting a revenue, to &s;hew the power of the Briti&s;h parliament, and then to order the money to be paid to the troops re&s;iding among them. It would have been more ea&s;y to have given orders to their a&s;&s;emblies to have paid them at fir&s;t hand, without &s;o much ri&s;k and unnece&s;&s;ary expence. This was &s;uch a trial of the affections of the colonies
<PB N="18" REF="18">as was not ea&s;y to be endured, and yet they bore it with great patience. The&s;e proceedings in the parliament had as bad an effect upon the mother country as the colonies; it hindered the Americans from bringing any cloathing from England, except what was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, and made them enter into a&s;&s;ociations to encourage manufactures among them&s;elves. The more &s;evere the laws of the mother country towards the Americans were, the more were the coloni&s;ts united, and the more they exerted all their vigour to bear their pre&s;ent burdens with fortitude. It was a thing not at all to be expected, that the colonies out of mere compliment to Great Britain, &s;hould &s;ub|mit to peri&s;h for want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, when they had a great abundance within them&s;elves. Their &s;ufferings already were of the &s;evere&s;t &s;ort; for like the children of Jacob in the land of bondage, they were required to make brick without &s;traw;&mdash; to carry on trade and manufactures, without either money or paper currency to promote their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to perceive the effects that this re&s;tri|ction upon the American commerce would have upon both the trade and revenue of the mother country; in proportion to the quantity of goods the colonies manufactured them&s;elves, or as far as they re&s;trained them&s;elves to things merely nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o much would the trade of Great Britain decrea&s;e, and the duty upon goods exported to America be le&s;&s;ened. It has been computed that the colonies, be&s;ides the foreign goods which they purcha&s;ed from our merchants, took annually of our produce and manufactures to the amount of three millions. A very great multi|tude of people were employed in manufacturing, in buying, &s;elling, and tran&s;porting the&s;e goods: So that from the &s;owing of the &s;eeds, till they were landed in
<PB N="19" REF="19">&s;ome port in America, the people of Great Britain were con&s;tantly employed, and in conclu&s;ion were paid, by the colonies. When this trade was &s;topped, or when it did not go on in its proper cour&s;e, it is natu|ral to conceive that all the thou&s;ands who were em|ployed in preparing the&s;e manufactures, mu&s;t have &s;ome way or other been &s;upported at the expence of the community, as it was impo&s;&s;ible that in a &s;hort time they could find any new kind of employment to pur&s;ue. This was at one &s;troke &s;triking off from bu&s;ine&s;s a multitude of u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, and throwing them upon the public for pre&s;ent &s;upply. The government could not help feeling the effects of this impolitic proceeding by a decrea&s;e of revenue; for they both lo&s;t the duty payable upon the goods exported to America, and the import duties payable on goods we received from foreign countries, in re|turn for what were &s;ent them by the colonies; and how|ever &s;mall all this may appear to &s;ome, it could not but amount to more than any thing that could po&s;&s;ibly be rai&s;ed by the unhappy re&s;triction.</P>
<P>It is &s;omewhat &s;urprizing that the wi&s;dom of both the mini&s;try and parliament &s;hould have at this time &s;o far for&s;aken them, as to prefer a law, &s;o ab&s;urd in its own nature, and ruinous in its con&s;equences; which every one by paying the &s;malle&s;t attention to the &s;ubject, might have ea&s;ily di&s;cerned to be a dangerous expe|dient, as well as an irrational project for rai&s;ing money. It appears to have been a time of political infatuation, and that the mini&s;try were bent both upon their own ruin and that of the nation. The pre&s;ent reign has been the mo&s;t unfortunate, for unhappy mea&s;ures of government, under a good con&s;titution and a religious &s;overeign, of any &s;ince the reign of Charles the fir&s;t. The mini&s;try, as if all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;ubjects in
<PB N="20" REF="20">America had been totally at their di&s;po&s;al, proceeded a &s;tep &s;till farther to make them&s;elves ridiculous. Be|fore they had enjoyed the profits and fruits of this ob|noxious bill, they proceeded to another &s;cheme, preg|nant with folly, oppre&s;&s;ion, and de&s;poti&s;m. After having laid new re&s;traints on the traffic of the colo|nies, &s;topt their &s;ources of procuring &s;pecie, and ren|dered their paper money in a great mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s, they proceeded to impo&s;e a new tax, unknown and unheard of on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic. A bill was brought into parliament, and pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, for laying a duty upon &s;tamps in all the American colonies. This law impo&s;ed no le&s;s than fifty-three dif|ferent &s;ort of &s;tamps and other duties upon the colo|lonies and plantations in America, &s;ome of them ex|tremely exorbitant and heavy, and none of them fa|vourable to the intere&s;ts of the colonies except one, which impo&s;es ten pounds per &s;heet upon the licen&s;es of attornies, &s;olicitors, and coun&s;ellors: This would probably have been a check upon the progre&s;s of a profe&s;&s;ion, which, when much encouraged, is rather the bane than the benefit of &s;ociety.&mdash;But many other articles were highly oppre&s;&s;ive and burden&s;ome to the &s;ubject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ABSTRACT of STAMP DUTIES.

<P>The tran&s;actions in the Briti&s;h parliament were not &s;o &s;ecretly carried on but they reached America be|fore they were ready to be put in execution. After this &s;tamp bill was read in parliament the fir&s;t time, be|fore it was read a &s;econd time, a petition was offered to the commons by Edward Montague, agent for the province of Virginia, praying to take their unhappy circum&s;tances into con&s;ideration; and that their hou&s;e of burge&s;&s;es might be continued in the rights and pri|vileges they had &s;o long enjoyed; and they might be heard by their council again&s;t a bill that might be in|tended to charge &s;tamp or any other duties on the co|lony of Virginia. A petition was al&s;o offered to be pre&s;ented by the governor and company of the Eng|li&s;h colony of Connecticut, in North America, praying that the colony might be indulged in the exerci&s;e of the power of laying all internal taxes on the &s;aid co|lony,
<PB N="22" REF="22">and that the re&s;olution of that hou&s;e in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, might not be carried into exe|cution, by a bill for impo&s;ing &s;tamp duties on the co|lonies. William Middleton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Daniel Hughes, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Jo&s;eph Nitt, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> al&s;o offered a petition in behalf of them&s;elves, and the re&s;t of the inhabitants, owners of property, in his Maje&s;ty's province of South Carolina, praying that the hou&s;e would not approve of any bill that might be offered, charging &s;tamp duties in the province of Ca|rolina. A motion was made with re&s;pect to each of the&s;e petitions, that they &s;hould be brought in, but upon each of the que&s;tions re&s;pectively a negative was put. Upon a divi&s;ion it was carried by 245 again&s;t 49 that the petitions &s;hould not be heard. The bill af|ter going through all its &s;tages and forms was at la&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and received the royal &s;anction.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="23">
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged to the honour of the Bri|ti&s;h parliament, that this bill did not pa&s;s without op|po&s;ition; the friends of liberty, and of the con&s;titu|tion,&mdash;the &s;incere lovers of the Brun&s;wick family, op|po&s;ed it, in all its &s;tages, and offered &s;uch arguments again&s;t it as their opponents were not able to an&s;wer. The juri&s;diction of parliament over the colonies, was combated with arguments, which every &s;ober per&s;on un|der no influence except truth, mu&s;t confe&s;s in their hearts to be forcible and conclu&s;ive. It was argued in behalf of the colonies, that tho&s;e who fir&s;t planted them, were driven from their native country by violent per|&s;ecution, and had left their mother country for con|&s;cience &s;ake, at their own ri&s;k and expence; that being both per&s;ecuted and for&s;aken by her, all ties, except what are common to mankind, were di&s;&s;olved between them. That as England had cea&s;ed to give
<PB N="24" REF="24">them legal protection, they were ab&s;olved from all duty of obedience to her. That their charters only bound them to the common duty of &s;ubjects, to the &s;overeign, as the &s;upreme head of the empire, but did not oblige them to &s;ubmit to the dictates of the le|gi&s;lature, in which they had no &s;hare. That it was unrea&s;onable that the people of Britain &s;hould pretend to exerci&s;e rights over their brethren in America, which they them&s;elves declare to be op|pre&s;&s;ive and illegal at home, when claimed by others among them.</P>
<P>It was further urged that it could not rea&s;onably be imagined that when the people of Great Britain con|tended with the crown, for the &s;ake of their own rights, that they con&s;idered it might be lawful for the &s;overeign to u&s;urp a power over others, which they denied could be lawfully exerci&s;ed over them|&s;elves. And that however binding their charters might have been, yet as they had been deprived of them by an arbitrary exertion of government, which the people at home would not &s;uffer, they ought to be &s;till con&s;idered as entitled to them, and the benefits ari&s;ing from them; that as their charters gave them full privilege to make their own laws, provided they did not make any contrary to the fundamental princi|ples of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and as they had not
<PB N="25" REF="25">been charged with any &s;uch mi&s;demeanours, they were undoubtedly entitled to their original chartered rights, of which the bill, then in agitation, was a ma|nife&s;t perver&s;ion. It was added that it was the birth|right of Engli&s;hmen, and their dependants, not to be taxed by any except their repre&s;entatives; but that the colonies were &s;o far from being repre&s;ented in the parliament of Great Britain, that they were not virtually repre&s;ented, as the meane&s;t inhabitants of the mother country were. That the people of Ireland were more virtually repre&s;ented in the parliament of Great Britain, than it was po&s;&s;ible for the colonies to be; that many Iri&s;h gentlemen and peers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed e&s;tates in England, and Engli&s;hmen in Ireland, &s;o that there were numbers of Iri&s;h noblemen and gentlemen, in both hou&s;es of parliament, and the parliament of Britain never claimed a right to tax the people of Ire|land, in con&s;equence of this virtual repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>It was objected that the mother country had given great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the colonies, expended great &s;ums of money in protecting them, and that it was rea&s;ona|ble to tax them for the &s;ake of being reimbur&s;ed for that expence. To this it was an&s;wered, that Britain either a&s;&s;i&s;ted the colonies from principles of humanity, or with a view of being repaid; if from principles of humanity and brotherly affection, their liberty was too dear a price for &s;uch a favour; and provided they expected to be repaid, they ought fir&s;t to &s;ettle ac|compts, and &s;ee how much the balance was that was due to Great Britain. That as the colonies had frequently a&s;&s;i&s;ted the mother country, and &s;uffered great lo&s;s by giving Britain an exclu&s;ive trade, by which they were prevented from &s;elling their goods to others at a much higher price than they could &s;ell them to her, and were obliged to buy from her what
<PB N="26" REF="26">they could have purcha&s;ed much cheaper from others, it was pre&s;umed that upon a fair reckoning the accompts would appear nearly even, and there would be little to pay. On the &s;ide of government, it was urged, that the colonies had &s;ubmitted to laws made by the mother country for their internal government, and that the Briti&s;h parliament had now a pre&s;criptive right of legi&s;lation. It was an&s;wered that this could no more be brought as a precedent again&s;t the colonies, than again&s;t England, which tamely &s;ubmitted to the arbitrary dictates of King Henry, and the authority of the &s;tar chamber; the tyranny of many being as grievous as that of a &s;ingle per&s;on. That if freedom was due to tho&s;e who had &s;en&s;e enough to value it, and courage to expo&s;e them&s;elves to every danger and fatigue to acquire it, the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e who had &s;uffered &s;o much in the wilds of America, from dreadful enemies, were better entitled to it, than their brethren in Great Britain. But it was urged again&s;t the arguments drawn from their charters, that all the corporations in England might plead the privi|lege of their charters, to be exempted from parlia|mentary taxation. But this of all other arguments, was the mo&s;t frivolous and in&s;ignificant. The corpo|rations in England &s;end members to parliament, and are repre&s;ented, and many of them received their charters for that very purpo&s;e; they therefore make their own laws, which makes the ca&s;es very unlike to one another.</P>
<P>There is one argument which the writer of the hi&s;torical part of the <HI>Annual Regi&s;ter</HI> offers again&s;t the claim of the Americans, to be repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament, which at fir&s;t view has more force than &s;everal others, and it is founded upon their keeping of &s;laves. He imagines it would not be &s;afe
<PB N="27" REF="27">to tru&s;t men with making of laws, who have been ac|cu&s;tomed to have an unlimited right over the lives and liberties of others. This is undoubtedly true; but I am afraid that this will exclude a great number in Eng|land from being repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parlia|ment. If there is any truth at all in the &s;tories of the &s;lave trade, there are not a few in Britain that are concerned in it, to their di&s;grace; and whatever co|lonies continue in this practice they will not long enjoy their liberty.&mdash;But the colonies do not de&s;ire to be repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament; they only want to have their own repre&s;entatives at home, and to make laws for them&s;elves, as we do in England. It would be unrea&s;onable for them to expect to be re|pre&s;ented in the parliament in England. But this is not any part of the controver&s;y. The above writer &s;eems to hint that Britain &s;hould claim a right to make laws to the Americans, becau&s;e they are unfit to make laws to them&s;elves, for want of feelings of humanity; and that this entitles Britain to an ab&s;olute right of empire over the colonies. If this argument were fairly analy&s;ed, it would be found to go a great length, and much farther than the writer &s;eems to intend; for it &s;uppo&s;es that all the colonies are alike in this re&s;pect, which is contrary to fact, and al&s;o that the parliament of England ought to have ab&s;olute empire over a people whom they encourage in a trade that makes them &s;ubject to &s;lavery. It is very manife&s;t that if tho&s;e whom he has con&s;igned to the ab&s;olute empire of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, were to come to England, they could not be denied a &s;hare in the go|vernment of this country, provided they had property to qualify them; and &s;uppo&s;e they employed thou|&s;ands in the &s;lave trade, it would be no objection to their &s;itting in parliament. But it is a point to be
<PB N="28" REF="28">&s;oberly con&s;idered, whether Great Britain is not as guilty as Virginia in this particular; for among&s;t all the laws for regulating the trade of the colonies, the Briti&s;h parliament has not yet made a law again&s;t this mo&s;t infamous traffic. It is no uncommon thing to &s;ee a Briti&s;h member of parliament have his <HI>Niger &s;lave</HI> following him, which plainly &s;hews that this practice is not peculiar to America. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers who went to America, knew nothing of this bu&s;ine&s;s. It began in &s;ome other place where it does not di&s;qualify men from being repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try at this time, whatever their intentions were, acted very impolitically: They acted with a great degree of po&s;itivene&s;s, yet wavered in pur&s;u|ing their mea&s;ures. They would neither give up their plans, nor would they pur&s;ue them with firm|ne&s;s: their whole de&s;igns were known over all Ame|rica, before ever they were able to execute them. While our mini&s;try and parliament were deliberating concerning the methods to pur&s;ue the &s;tamp act, the leaders among the American colonies had time to paint it, in the mo&s;t formidable point of light, to the lower ranks of people, and to kindle a flame in their tempers again&s;t it, that neither the art nor power of the King's mini&s;ters were afterwards able to quench. Wherever the news of this impolitic and oppre&s;&s;ive law reached, it &s;pread di&s;content like a conflagration, and blazed from one colony to another. The tem|pers of all the colonies being alike affected, it was ea&s;y to &s;tir up the &s;ame aver&s;ion in them all, again&s;t a law which was again&s;t their intere&s;t, and had much the appearance of oppre&s;&s;ion. One thing with which the mini&s;try then, and &s;ince have deceived them&s;elves, is, that they were per&s;uaded that the aver&s;ion to this law was not univer&s;al: It was alleged that only a few
<PB N="29" REF="29">of the colonies, and but &s;ome in each of them, were di&s;po&s;ed to pur&s;ue oppo&s;ition, or that like the people at home, they would rai&s;e a little clamour for a &s;ea&s;on, and then &s;ubmit to the authority of the mother coun|try, in the point of taxation. This was only &s;urmi&s;e, without any real &s;hadow of foundation, or &s;o much as a partial under&s;tanding of the temper of the colo|nies, which ought to have been fully inve&s;tigated before &s;uch a dangerous expedient had been tried. The managers at home appear to have been ignorant of the real &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition of the coloni&s;ts, and &s;eem to have judged of a people, not yet corrupted with luxury, nor initiated in a &s;y&s;tem of di&s;&s;ipation, from the examples they had ob&s;erved in the mother country, where corruption and venality is almo&s;t univer&s;al. In this they were greatly mi&s;taken, and found by expe|rience, that a people that &s;till retained the &s;pirit and temper of the la&s;t century, and were in many re&s;pects formed upon the principles of their ance&s;tors, were not to be managed in the &s;ame manner as people ren|dered &s;oft and effeminate, by importing the luxuries and vices of all nations under the &s;un. The mi|ni&s;try were unfortunate in the beginning of this &s;cheme, and un&s;ucce&s;sful in the conclu&s;ion of it. The news of pa&s;&s;ing the &s;tamp act came fir&s;t to New Eng|land, a colony the mo&s;t tenacious of their liberty, and jealous to the la&s;t degree of every appearance of de&s;|poti&s;m. This colony con&s;idered it&s;elf as the offspring of progenitors, who had &s;uffered both &s;everely and unju&s;tly at the hands of the mother country, and who had a&s;&s;erted their natural rights and privileges at the ri&s;que of their lives, and the expence of much blood. They had not forgot how their fathers had, for the &s;ake of civil and religious liberty, fled to a wilderne&s;s, which they had now converted into a
<PB N="30" REF="30">fruitful field, from an intolerable &s;piritual per&s;ecution, which could not be borne, and they were not di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;urrender the fruits of their own labour, and that of their ance&s;tors to the children of tho&s;e, that had bani&s;hed their fathers from their native country. The fir&s;t coloni&s;ts &s;ucceeded in their undertakings without any expence or charge to the &s;tate, which was acknow|ledged by a vote of the hou&s;e of commons as early as 1642; and it was not to be expected that their chil|dren were tamely to give up rights, that were both founded in nature, and the principles of common ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>When the news of the &s;tamp act having received the royal &s;ignature, reached New England, the me|lancholy that had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their minds be|fore, upon hearing that it was voted a proper mea&s;ure to lay it upon them, broke out into fury and outrage. The &s;hips in the harbours hung out their colours half ma&s;t high, in token of deep mourning; the bells were muffled; the act was printed with a death's head to it, in the place where it is cu&s;tomary to affix the new acts of parliament, and called publicly about the &s;treets, by the name of the <HI>Folly of England,</HI> and the ruin of Ame|rica. Several e&s;&s;ays were written, not only again&s;t the expediency, but again&s;t the ju&s;tice, of this law, in &s;everal news papers: one in particular had the title of the <HI>Con&s;titutional Courant,</HI> containing matters in|tere&s;ting to liberty, and no wi&s;e repugnant to loyalty, printed by Andrew Marvel, at the &s;ign of the Bribe Refu&s;ed, on Con&s;titutional Hill, North America. This had a more &s;ignificant fronti&s;piece than any of the re&s;t: It had a &s;nake cut in pieces with the initial letters of the names of the &s;everal colonies, from New-England to South Carolina, inclu&s;ively, fixed to each piece, and above them JOIN or DIE. To the&s;e were
<PB N="31" REF="31">added &s;everal characters, and &s;ententious aphori&s;ms, &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, which were ea&s;ily circulated, and as ea&s;ily committed to memory; and being ex|ceedingly expre&s;&s;ive, they had all the force of a great many arguments. Many of the&s;e papers were writ|ten with great acrimony, and threw forth &s;evere re|flections again&s;t the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and the leaders in the&s;e impolitic and arbitrary mea&s;ures; and it mu&s;t be granted by every judicious and candid per&s;on, that they had great provocation. There were two things exceedingly grievous in this act to the colonies. The fir&s;t was, that the per&s;ons that acted under this law, had it in their power to bring an action, the cau&s;e of which had ari&s;en at one extremity of North America, to the other, at the di&s;tance of near two thou&s;and miles, without the traders being entitled to recover damages, in ca&s;e the judge &s;hould certify that there was any probable cau&s;e for the pro&s;ecution. The &s;econd was, the judge had an intere&s;t in giving a &s;en|tence in favour of the party &s;uing for the penalties of the act, by being allowed, by way of commi&s;&s;ion, a very large &s;hare in the&s;e penalties. This was inju&s;t|ice that the greate&s;t &s;laves could not ea&s;ily endure, without murmuring; and it was not to be expected that a free people, who have the mo&s;t &s;trict ideas of liberty, would, without repining, &s;ubmit to &s;uch fla|grant oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny. By the time the act reached the colonies, they were wrought up to the highe&s;t pitch of aver&s;ion again&s;t it, and treated it with the greate&s;t contempt: In many places it was publicly burnt, together with the effigies of the chief promo|ters thereof, who, provided they had been pre&s;ent, would have met with an abundant di&s;grace. On the other hand they prai&s;ed and applauded, with eulo|giums of the highe&s;t &s;train, the per&s;ons who had op|po&s;ed
<PB N="32" REF="32">this obnoxious bill. In &s;everal of their meet|ings they voted thanks to General Conway and Colo|nel Barre, two gentlemen who had u&s;ed their influ|ence to prevent this arbitrary &s;tatute, in the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons. Their &s;peeches again&s;t it, and their pictures were reque&s;ted from England; the pictures to be hung up in their places of meeting, and the &s;peeches to be in&s;erted in the books de&s;igned to re|cord their principal tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>The government was now much embarra&s;&s;ed how to have this new act put into execution; for when the tidings of this di&s;content in America arrived in Eng|land, there were but few ma&s;ters of &s;hips found, who were willing to take on board &s;uch an obnoxious and unpopular cargo; and it was &s;oon di&s;covered that this precaution was founded in prudence, and the princi|ples of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. Such as were &s;o adventurous as to carry any quantity of the&s;e tickets of taxation, to America, were made &s;adly to repent, when they ar|rived at their de&s;tined port; where, to &s;ave their ve&s;&s;els from fire, and them&s;elves from an ignominious death, the mo&s;t of the&s;e adventurers were obliged to deliver up their execrated cargoes, into the hands of the enraged populace, to be treated with as much ig|nominy as the act it&s;elf had been treated before:&mdash;Others were obliged to &s;helter them&s;elves under &s;uch of the King's &s;hips, as happened to be neare&s;t to pro|tect them. The glorious harve&s;t that was now expect|ed to be reaped by Engli&s;h tax-gatherers, to be &s;ent over to collect this revenue, was by this &s;torm &s;oon bla&s;ted, and tho&s;e gentlemen who came from England with commi&s;&s;ions to act as di&s;tributors of &s;tamps, were made to repent &s;everely of engaging in &s;uch an enter|prize. Many of them were made to renounce, now and for ever, in the mo&s;t public manner, and upon
<PB N="33" REF="33">oath, all manner of concern in them, and others cau|tiou&s;ly returned to the places from whence they came; while &s;ome of a more froward di&s;po&s;ition, and per&s;i&s;t|ed &s;trenuou&s;ly in putting the act in execution, were treated by the people as enemies of their country, who meant to en&s;lave America for the &s;ake of paltry emoluments from the court of Britain. Some of this character were &s;everely handled; their hou&s;es were burnt, and their effects plundered and de&s;troyed; and &s;uch was the rage of the multitude again&s;t this unpo|pular and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;tatute, that &s;ome who had been appointed without their con&s;ent or &s;olicitation, to &s;uperintend the di&s;tribution of the &s;tamped paper, by virtue of their bearing the office of governors, were treated in the &s;ame manner, and with the like &s;everity. Mr Hutchin&s;on who was &s;u&s;pected, and ac|cording to the be&s;t accounts, not without rea&s;on, of mi&s;repre&s;enting the colonies in his letters to govern|ment, was &s;everely u&s;ed. The people obliged him to deliver up copies of his own letters which he had &s;ent to England, and by this means made him evidence again&s;t him&s;elf. This was as illegal as the general warrant, that was i&s;&s;ued by a &s;ecretary of &s;tate again&s;t Mr Wilkes, and it is not improbable that the colo|nies on this occa&s;ion formed their practice upon &s;ome modern Briti&s;h precedents, pretended to have been u&s;ed through the law of nece&s;&s;ity. Had the Ameri|cans at this time, been in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the &s;ubjects of the mother country, and agreed by repre|&s;entation to the framing of this law, their pre&s;ent proceedings would have been <HI>traitorous</HI> and <HI>rebellious;</HI> but as all was done without their con&s;ent, and con|trary to the e&s;&s;ential con&s;titution of the empire, their conduct may be accounted ra&s;h and &s;evere, but cannot be lawfully pronounced <HI>trea&s;on</HI> or <HI>rebellion.</HI> People in
<PB N="34" REF="34">this country who are partly &s;elf-intere&s;ted, and lie al&s;o at a di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action, are ready to cen&s;ure the coloni&s;ts more through partiality and attachment to &s;ome party, than from a principle of judgment and true di&s;cernment: Had they been in the &s;ame &s;ituation, they would have probably deter|mined otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts, &s;hewed that they were determined not to &s;ubmit to the &s;tamp act upon any account; for when &s;hips which came from tho&s;e colonies that had &s;ubmitted to this law, brought &s;tamps to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, for the &s;ake of their own vindication, they were &s;eized and &s;tuck up in taverns and coffee-hou&s;es in &s;corn, and afterwards committed to the flames with the u&s;ual ceremony. This was not merely the device and operation of a fickle mob of unthinking people: Per&s;ons of <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>character</HI> were con|cerned both in the plan and its operation, and fre|quently mingled with the populace, to direct the exe|cution of their main de&s;ign. Some of the leading men in the oppo&s;ition, not only countenanced the people in their outrages again&s;t this act, privately, but &s;ome of them gave an open defiance to the authority that impo&s;ed this act, by publicly adverti&s;ing that tho&s;e who were employed to enforce that law, might &s;ave them&s;elves the trouble of applying to them, for they were re&s;olved not to pay any duty, except what was laid on by their repre&s;entatives. The provincial a&s;|&s;emblies were of the &s;ame &s;entiments with the many individuals, in the oppo&s;ition, which they at fir&s;t &s;hewed, by declining giving the governors any advice concerning their behaviour, in &s;uch a critical junc|ture of affairs: They knew that without their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and concurrence, the governors could not pro|ceed far, and were determined to give them no aid in
<PB N="35" REF="35">executing a law which they con&s;idered as altogether uncon&s;titutional. Some of the governors of the pro|vinces, and the provincial a&s;&s;emblies, were not very cordial in their affections to one another; they pro|ceeded upon different principles, and were influenced by different ideas of intere&s;t. The governors who had formerly had their &s;alaries paid by the provinces, were now paid by the crown, which gave them a bia&s;s towards the &s;ide of the mini&s;try, which was not always con&s;i&s;tent with the advantage of the colonies. While the governors were paid by the provinces, the colo|ni&s;ts were often ready to reward their good &s;ervices, with &s;ingular tokens of favour and e&s;teem, which made the legi&s;lative part of the con&s;titution, and that of the executive, keep up a good under&s;tanding with one another; but when their intere&s;ts were &s;eparated, their affections &s;oon became di&s;united, and frequently the governors di&s;approved what the a&s;&s;emblies were plea&s;ed to recommend. This in proce&s;s of time cre|ated jarring between the hou&s;es of repre&s;entatives and their governors, which had proceeded to an un|charitable length about the time of the &s;tamp act. The&s;e a&s;&s;emblies were not di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee men em|barra&s;&s;ed in the execution of an office, which they con&s;idered as not di&s;charged for the purpo&s;e of its fir&s;t in&s;titution. They therefore gave them very &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance on this pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion. They di&s;a|vowed the riotous proceedings of the multitude, and went &s;o far as to promi&s;e rewards for &s;eizing, the riot|ers who had plundered the hou&s;e of one of their chief ju&s;tices, who was obliged to appear on the &s;eat of ju&s;tice without the in&s;ignia of his office, and the badges of his authority. When &s;ome of the&s;e rioters were brought to their trial, the juries would not pro|ceed &s;o far as the friends of the &s;tamp act were inclined
<PB N="36" REF="36">they &s;hould. The writer of the Annual Regi&s;ter af|firms that they could be brought to condemn them no further than decency required, and would not pro|mi&s;e to &s;trengthen the hands of government &s;o far as to prevent commotions about the &s;tamp act; nor did they account the&s;e commotions were objects of military re&s;traint. When once a controver&s;y is begun, there are often errors on both &s;ides, and there is no que&s;|tion but the coloni&s;ts did &s;everal things that they ought not to have done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The plundering of Governor Hutchin&s;on's hou&s;e on the 16th of Augu&s;t, was cruel, barbarous, and unju&s;t. His papers were all burnt, his hou&s;e unroof'd, and all his clothes, with tho&s;e of his daughter and &s;i&s;ter were taken away.</NOTE>; but when the rea&s;ons and cau&s;es of their oppo&s;ition to this law are con&s;idered, it mu&s;t be allowed that their provocations were not &s;mall. It may be ea&s;y for per&s;ons who are bia&s;&s;ed by intere&s;t and party attachments, to form a &s;pecious &s;hew of rea&s;oning to condemn the coloni&s;ts, and vin|dicate the government of this country; but an impar|tial hi&s;torian, with nothing but truth in his eye, will be obliged to draw his inferences from pure facts, and the natural rea&s;ons of them, without paying any regard to party or per&s;ua&s;ions.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, when the debates and quarrels of the parties ran very high, &s;ome per&s;ons from caution, or &s;ome other principle, privately &s;piked up the can|non belonging to the forts and &s;hip yards, le&s;t any u&s;e &s;hould be made of them by either party; and though this might be con&s;tructed an illegal interference with his Maje&s;ty's &s;tores and arms, was a ready mean to pre|vent blood&s;hed in ca&s;e of a &s;udden rencounter, through the irritation of party &s;pirit. What was determined in the provincial a&s;&s;emblies, with regard to the &s;tamp act, was approved by &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies of the prin|cipal
<PB N="37" REF="37">inhabitants of &s;ome places, who in&s;tructed their repre&s;entatives not to agree in any mea&s;ures for the protection of the &s;tamp papers, or &s;tamp officers. They granted there had been &s;ome tumults and di&s;or|ders on that account, but that the&s;e mu&s;t be laid to the charge of tho&s;e who wanted to urge uncon&s;titu|tional laws upon them, contrary to their charters, and their rights as Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, who ought to enjoy the equal privileges of the empire in making their own laws, and taxing them&s;elves. They al&s;o cautioned their repre&s;entatives again&s;t all uncon&s;titutional drafts on the public trea&s;ury, for fear that the governors &s;hould endeavour to &s;trengthen their hands by that means, without their con&s;ent. The&s;e were proceed|ings which, though at fir&s;t view they may appear precipitate and too determined, argued yet a politi|cal fore&s;ight, which &s;hewed they were not di&s;po&s;ed to trifle.</P>
<P>The general a&s;&s;emblies proceeded &s;till further. In|&s;tead of winking at the oppo&s;ition of the people, they began to patronize it, and in expre&s;s terms, affirm|ed that the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature had no right to tax them. This had been often a&s;&s;erted, and even proved by the &s;tronge&s;t arguments, to be founded in rea&s;on and the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. It was granted that they were &s;ubjects of the empire under one &s;overeign, or one executive power; but that they had as good a right to make their own laws as the &s;ubjects at home, and that none but them&s;elves had a right to give away their property. They came at la&s;t to a re&s;olu|tion to petition the legi&s;lature of Britain again&s;t the &s;tamp act, and pleaded their incapacity to pay any &s;uch tax as was now impo&s;ed upon them; but at the &s;ame time they a&s;ked the favour, they did not ac|knowledge that they were dependent upon the par|liament
<PB N="38" REF="38">of Britain. This was con&s;idered as only a&s;king a favour of equals, without making the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion the parliament required, which rendered their petition offen&s;ive to the majority of the legi&s;la|ture. From the manner of their proceedings, &s;ome wi&s;e men fore&s;aw what would be the con&s;equence of the mother country's a&s;&s;erting a right of legi&s;lation over the coloni&s;ts; they oppo&s;ed the &s;tamp act be|cau&s;e they con&s;idered it both uncon&s;titutional in its nature, and detrimental to the real intere&s;t of the em|pire.</P>
<P>On this trying occa&s;ion the coloni&s;ts were not wanting to them&s;elves in any mea&s;ure that might promote unanimity of de&s;igns and execution in the different colonies: They formed a&s;&s;ociations, and appointed committees, for the &s;ake of a general cor|re&s;pondence in carrying on the common affairs of the whole body. From the&s;e committees deputies were appointed to meet in congre&s;s at New-York; and what &s;hewed the unanimity of their &s;entiments in this general cau&s;e, and that they were all of one mind is, that when the deputies met at New-York, they were &s;o well agreed, that they had little more to do than to congratulate one another, and &s;et their hands to one general declaration of their rights, and the grie|vances they laboured under, and to a petition ex|pre&s;&s;ing a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e grievances to the king, lords, and commons of Great Britain. It was not long till the magi&s;trates &s;ubordinate to the king be|gan to join the legi&s;lative part. The ju&s;tices of We&s;t|moreland in Virginia, gave public notice under their hands, that they had re&s;igned their office, and decli|ned acting in that capacity; that they would not any longer be in&s;trumental to the de&s;truction of their country, which their oath as ju&s;tices of the peace
<PB N="39" REF="39">now obliged them to, provided they continued in the di&s;charge of their office. The gentlemen of the law al&s;o declared that they would lay down their offices rather than be obliged to practi&s;e upon &s;tamp paper. This is an in&s;tance of patrioti&s;m rarely to be met with, and to which the mother country cannot afford a parallel. Tho&s;e that are acquainted with the gene|ral character of people of that profe&s;&s;ion in Great Britain, will be ready to conclude, that the lawyers in Virginia have had a very different education, or that they are not de&s;cendants of the natives of this country. How far they may have been in the right or in the wrong in this particular I will not pre|tend to &s;ay; it however argued a great degree of &s;elf-denial, to give up their bu&s;ine&s;s for the &s;ake of the public intere&s;t. Before the fir&s;t of November, when the act was to take place, there was not a &s;heet of &s;tamp paper to be had throughout the &s;everal co|lonies of New England, New York, New Jer&s;ey, Pen&s;ylvania, Virginia, Maryland, or the two Caroli|nas, except a parcel at New York, which the gover|nor through fear was obliged to &s;urrender to the cor|poration, upon condition that they would not de&s;troy it like the re&s;t. Thus, all bu&s;ine&s;s that could not be carried on without &s;tamps, was put to a &s;tand, ex|cept new&s;papers, which the printers, for fear of the populace, were obliged to continue without &s;tamps. But in Canada, where &s;tamps were made u&s;e of, the printers were in a wor&s;e &s;ituation, for few or none would buy a new&s;paper on account of its being &s;tamped, and the whole lay upon their hands. The courts of ju&s;tice were now &s;hut up as well as the ports; and even in tho&s;e colonies where &s;tamps were u&s;ed, the people of the be&s;t rank &s;ubmitted to be cal|led in the churches rather than take out licen&s;es for
<PB N="40" REF="40">private marriages. This &s;hews us how far the Eng|li&s;h mini&s;try have deceived them&s;elves and the public, in repre&s;enting that where any colony had not totally joined with the re&s;t in oppo&s;ition to government, that they were all &s;atisfied and unanimous. In tho&s;e places where &s;ome leading people had rule, matters were for &s;ome time &s;moothed over, and kept in a tem|per; when at the &s;ame time the far greater part were wholly di&s;&s;atisfied with the public mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The evil con&s;equences of &s;uch a &s;tagnation in bu&s;i|ne&s;s began to be felt &s;everely, and would have cooled a moderate zeal for liberty, where di&s;tre&s;s was &s;o ma|nife&s;t. The friends of government rai&s;ed their hopes, that from feeling &s;uch inconveniences the deluded multitude would return to a &s;en&s;e of their duty, and in a &s;hort time oppo&s;ition would totally &s;ub&s;ide. Men who &s;et no value upon liberty, are ready to imagine that all others view it in the &s;ame light, and that in general mankind mean no more by oppo&s;ition to power, and by the name of liberty, than to worm them|&s;elves into preferment or places of profit and emolu|ment: This may be the ca&s;e with a few, or with &s;ome de&s;igning politicians; but when a whole country catches the flame, there is always more than the hope of court preferment in the ca&s;e. Demagogues may on a particular occa&s;ion, mi&s;lead &s;ome unthinking people, but it requires more than is in the power of any human addre&s;s, to lead a continent, unle&s;s they have &s;ome rational principle to proceed upon. It is a very common thing for both parties on each &s;ide of a que&s;tion, to impute the wor&s;t de&s;igns to their anta|goni&s;ts, but wherever truth and wi&s;dom are pur&s;ued, whatever names may be a&s;cribed to the agents, time will determine both the nature of the cau&s;e, and the principles of the actors.</P>

<P>During this interruption of public bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome fruitful expedients were tried to evade the influence of this new law, and among others, the bark of a tree was di&s;covered, which an&s;wered for a &s;uceda|neum in&s;tead of paper, and was &s;ent to the printers at Bo&s;ton for their approbation; and as it was neither paper, parchment, nor vellum, the di&s;coverer wanted to know whether deeds written upon this bark might not be valid though they were not &s;tamped. In this ca&s;e he was ready to &s;erve with good writing bark, all tho&s;e who&s;e con&s;ciences were bound by the late act of parliament. This invention was certainly ingenious, but the propo&s;al was not altogether hone&s;t; for &s;uch as were free to u&s;e this vegetable paper, without &s;cruple of con&s;cience, ought not to have laid a &s;nare before the con&s;ciences of others.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer of the Annual Regi&s;ter &s;ays, "At la&s;t the governors of &s;ome of the provinces, though bound by the act to &s;wear to &s;ee it ob|&s;erved, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, thinking the total &s;toppage of all public bu&s;ine&s;s, of &s;uch $ad con&s;equence to the community, as to ren|der lawful the non-compliance with any injunctions laid on them, or even the breach of any oath taken by them, in con&s;equence of injunc|tions, merely for the &s;ake of that community, thought proper to di&s;|pence with the u&s;ual &s;tamps, grounding their di&s;pen&s;ation on the impo&s;|&s;ibility of procuring any ve&s;&s;els to protect them from the penalties of the act in the other parts of his Maje&s;ty's dominions." Though this act bound the governors to &s;wear to &s;ee it ob&s;erved upon &s;evere penal|ties, yet while they had not &s;worn, they only broke the &s;tatute, but not their oath. Their making u&s;e of paper even without &s;tamps, would have been di&s;obedience to the law, but could be no breach of their oath.</NOTE></P>
<P>While the&s;e tran&s;actions were going on, the a&s;&s;em|bly of South Carolina, who&s;e lieutenant-governor re|fu&s;ed to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s without &s;tamps, addre&s;&s;ed him to know through what channel the &s;tamp act had been tran&s;mitted to him. His an&s;wer was, that he had it fir&s;t from the attorney-general, and next from Mr Boone, governor of the province. They &s;aid, as
<PB N="42" REF="42">that was the ca&s;e, he had not received it legally, nor were tho&s;e <HI>true</HI> notifications of the act, as the gover|nor when out of the province, and the attorney-ge|neral when in it, could not, with regard to this com|munication, be con&s;idered in any other light than as private per&s;ons. They gave &s;everal in&s;tances of the province having &s;uffered from the accidental detention of government information, &s;ufficient to that certain forms were ab&s;olutely to be u&s;ed in all matters of go|vernment, e&s;pecially &s;uch as related to authenticating new laws of &s;uch immen&s;e con&s;equence to that pro|vince. It is highly probable that they had received many laws through channels not more authentic than this now mentioned, but as this was more contrary to their inclination, they were di&s;po&s;ed to make the more objections to it.</P>
<P>But the coloni&s;ts devi&s;ed a better method to avoid the &s;tamp act. The merchants throughout all the&s;e colo|nies entered into the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements to each other, to order no more goods from Great Britain, whatever &s;hould be the con&s;equence, and to recall the orders they had already given, if not executed before the 1&s;t of January, 1766; and they re&s;olved further, not even to di&s;po&s;e of any Briti&s;h goods &s;ent them upon commi&s;&s;ion, that were not &s;hipped before that day; or if they con&s;ented to any relaxation from the&s;e engagements, it was not to take place till the &s;tamp act, &s;ugar act, and paper money acts were re|pealed. The people of Philadelphia al&s;o re&s;olved by a large majority, that till &s;uch a repeal &s;hould happen, no lawyer &s;hould put in &s;uit for a demand for money, owing by a re&s;ident in America to any one in Eng|land; nor any per&s;on in America, however indebted in England, make any remittances there. This re&s;o|lution was adopted by the retailers, who unanimou&s;ly
<PB N="43" REF="43">agreed not to buy any more Engli&s;h goods &s;hipped con|trary to the&s;e re&s;olutions. Ages to come will be amazed that &s;eparate governments, and &s;o many colo|nies di&s;tinct from each other, &s;hould have united &s;o &s;peedily in one intere&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the influence of government agents among them, who both oppo|&s;ed all their mea&s;ures, and endeavoured to fru&s;tate all their de&s;igns. Ideas of freedom, when people are not too much vitiated through the power of venality and di&s;&s;ipation, will produce marvellous ef|fects in the behaviour of a people.</P>
<P>This controver&s;y between the mother country and the coloni&s;ts was for a &s;ea&s;on of great &s;ervice to Ire|land. What goods the Americans could not po&s;&s;ibly want they ordered from that country, in ex|change for their hemp and flax &s;eed, of which they &s;ent yearly a great quantity. But in the mean time they pur&s;ued every rational method to free them&s;elves from that dependence. A &s;ociety of arts, manu|factures, and commerce, was in&s;tituted at New-York in imitation of that of London, and markets were opened for the &s;ale of home-made manufactures. It &s;oon appeared that neither the natives nor tho&s;e ma|nufacturers which they had invited from Britain and other nations, were idle; they gave good encourage|ment, and they found workmen in abundance. They made progre&s;s in the woolen and linen manufactures, in &s;everal &s;pecies of coar&s;er iron ware, malt, &s;pirits, and paper hangings. The&s;e were &s;hewn to the &s;ociety and approved, and when brought to the market were greedily purcha&s;ed: and to furni&s;h materials for the woolen work, mo&s;t of the inhabitants came to a re|&s;olution to eat no lamb; and to extend this de&s;ign more univer&s;ally, they determined not to deal with any butcher that &s;hould kill or expo&s;e any lamb to &s;ale for
<PB N="44" REF="44">a limited time. The &s;pirit of indu&s;try prevailed to &s;uch a degree, and &s;o far took place of idlene&s;s and profu|&s;ion, that the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial people were among the fir&s;t to &s;et an example to their countrymen, by wearing home-&s;pun or old clothes, rather than make u&s;e of any Briti&s;h manufactures, of which they were wont to be madly fond. Such were the efforts of all ranks, and &s;uch wi&s;e and prudent mea&s;ures did they pur&s;ue, that many began to think what they formerly had imagined impo&s;&s;ible, was exceedingly probable, and that in a little time the colonies would be able to &s;upply them|&s;elves with every nece&s;&s;ary of life. Where ideas of freedom once prevail, the arts, &s;ciences, and every other branch of profitable knowledge will attend them. Slavery enfeebles the mind, and renders all the facul|ties thereof &s;tupid, dull, and inactive: Men who know not the nature of freedom, may toil like bea&s;ts of burden, or chant like birds in a cage, at the plea&s;ure of their ma&s;ters; but they enjoy no rational plea&s;ure, nor po&s;&s;e&s;s the enjoyment of creatures, dignified with rea&s;on and divine under&s;tanding. It is &s;omething amazing that men who profe&s;s to be great, and wi&s;e, &s;hould not take plea&s;ure in &s;eeing others as wi&s;e, great, and happy as them&s;elves, but &s;hould have the ambi|tion to think that the Deity gave all men the &s;ame faculties, with a de&s;ign to make them the &s;ervants of a few, and never to be their own ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>As one thing generally leads to another, the A|mericans began to enter into a re&s;olution, which in its con&s;equences would have made the mother coun|try feel the fruits of her folly effectually. It was pro|po&s;ed to &s;top the exportation of tobacco from Virgi|nia and South Carolina to Great Britain; which con|&s;idering the great quantities of that article which are re-exported from Great Britain, and the immen&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="45">&s;ums &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly rai&s;ed by home con&s;umption, her trade, and e&s;pecially her revenue, could not fail of being greatly affected. The&s;e were notices to the mother country of what a re&s;olute people will deter|mine, and had &s;he been &s;o wi&s;e as to have profited by tho&s;e warnings, &s;he and her colonies might have for ages to come lived in friend&s;hip and dependance upon each other.</P>
<P>As the ri&s;e and &s;pring of the pre&s;ent war in Ame|rica ought fir&s;t to be inve&s;tigated before we can de|termine on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion, it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved here, that one pretence for beginning and carrying it on is groundle&s;s and frivolous. It has often been affirmed that the taxes intended to be im|po&s;ed on the colonies, were only de&s;igned to indem|nify the mother country for the expence of protect|ing them in the la&s;t war. To &s;et this point in a clear light, it may be remembered, that in the year 1754, when the French were making encroachments on the crown lands in America, and interrupted the trade of that country with the Indians, a war was appre|hended, and commi&s;&s;ioners from a number of the co|lonies met at Albany, to form a plan of union for their mutual defence. The plan they agreed to was this, 'That a grand council be cho&s;en by the a&s;&s;em|blies and &s;ent from all the colonies; which council, together with a governor general to be appointed by the crown, &s;hould be empowered to make gene|ral laws to rai&s;e money in all the colonies for the de|fence of the whole.' This plan was &s;ent to the go|vernment in England for their approbation, and had it been approved and e&s;tabli&s;hed by authority, Engli&s;h America at that time thought it&s;elf &s;ufficiently able to defend it&s;elf again&s;t the French without any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Several of the colonies in former wars with|&s;tood
<PB N="46" REF="46">the whole power of the French without a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from Britain or any other quarter. The plan was rejected, and a new one formed in its &s;tead; in which it was propo&s;ed that the governors of all the colonies, attended by one or two members of their re&s;pective councils, &s;hould a&s;&s;emble and concert mea|&s;ures for the defence of the whole, erect forts where they thought proper, and rai&s;e what troops they thought nece&s;&s;ary, with power to draw on the trea|&s;ury in England, for the &s;ums that &s;hould be wanted; and the trea&s;ury to be reimbur&s;ed by a tax laid on the colonies by act of parliament. This new plan was communicated by Governor Shirley to Doctor Frank|lin, who was then at Bo&s;ton, who&s;e thoughts at that time on the &s;ubject will throw con&s;iderable light upon this controverted point. The enemies of this re|nowned philo&s;opher mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to an&s;wer his arguments; but the reader &s;hall judge for him&s;elf.</P>

<P>"I mentioned it ye&s;terday to your excellency, as my opinion, that excluding the <HI>people</HI> of the colonies from all &s;hare in the choice of the grand council, would probably give extreme di&s;&s;atisfaction, as well as the taxing them by act of parliament, where they have no repre&s;entative. In matters of general con|cern to the people, and e&s;pecially where burdens are to be laid upon them, it is of u&s;e to con&s;ider, as well what they will be apt to think and &s;ay, as what they ought to think; I &s;hall therefore, as your excellen|cy requires it of me, briefly mention what of either kind occurs to me on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t they will &s;ay, and perhaps with ju&s;tice, that the body of the people in the colonies are as loyal, and as firmly attached to the pre&s;ent con&s;titution, and reigning family, as any &s;ubjects in the king's domi|nions.</P>
<P>"That there is no rea&s;on to doubt the readine&s;s and willingne&s;s of the repre&s;entatives they may chu&s;e, to grant from time to time &s;uch &s;upplies for the de|fence of the country, as &s;hall be judged nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o far as their abilities will allow.</P>
<P>"That the people in the colonies, who are to feel the immediate mi&s;chiefs of inva&s;ion and conque&s;t by an enemy in the lo&s;s of their e&s;tates, lives and liber|ties, are likely to be better judges of the quantity of of forces nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed and maintained, forts to be built and &s;upported, and of their own abilities to bear the expence, than the parliament of England at &s;o great a di&s;tance.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="48">
<P>"That governors often come to the colonies merely to make fortunes, with which they intend to return to Britain; are not always men of the be&s;t abi|lities or integrity, have many of them no e&s;tates here, nor any natural connections with us, that &s;hould make them heartily concerned for our welfare; and might po&s;&s;ibly be fond of rai&s;ing and keeping up more forces than nece&s;&s;ary, from the profits accruing to them|&s;elves, and to make provi&s;ion for their friends and de|pendants.</P>
<P>"That the coun&s;ellors in mo&s;t of the colonies be|ing appointed by the crown, on the recommendation of governors, are often of &s;mall e&s;tates, frequently de|pendant on governors for offices, and therefore too much under influence.</P>
<P>"That there is, therefore, great rea&s;on to be jea|lous of a power in &s;uch governors and councils, to rai&s;e &s;uch &s;ums as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary, by draft on the lords of the trea&s;ury, to be afterwards laid on the colonies by act of parliament, and paid by the people here; &s;ince they might abu&s;e it by projecting u&s;ele&s;s expeditions, harra&s;&s;ing the people, and ta|king them from their labour to execute &s;uch projects, merely to create offices and employments, and gratify their dependants, and divide profits.</P>
<P>"That the parliament of England is at a great di&s;|tance, &s;ubject to be mi&s;informed and mi&s;led by &s;uch governors and councils, who&s;e united intere&s;ts might probably &s;ecure them again&s;t the effect of any com|plaint from hence.</P>
<P>"That it is &s;uppo&s;ed an undoubted right of Engli&s;h|men, not to be taxed but by their own con&s;ent given through their repre&s;entatives.</P>

<P>"That if the colonies in a body may be well go|verned by governors and councils appointed by the
<PB N="50" REF="51">crown, without repre&s;entatives, particular colonies may as well or better be &s;o governed; a tax may be laid on them all by act of parliament for &s;upport of government, and their a&s;&s;emblies may be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as an u&s;ele&s;s part of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>"That the powers propo&s;ed by the Albany plan of union, to be ve&s;ted in a grand council repre&s;enta|tive of the people, even with regard to military mat|ters, are not &s;o great as tho&s;e the colonies of Rhode I&s;land and Connecticut are tru&s;ted with by their charter, and have never abu&s;ed; for by this plan, the pre&s;ident general is appointed by the crown, and controuls all by his negative; but in the&s;e govern|ments the people chu&s;e the governor, and yet allow him no negative.</P>
<P>"That the Briti&s;h colonies bordering on the French are properly frontiers of the Briti&s;h empire; and the the frontiers of an empire are properly defended at the joint expence of the body of the people in &s;uch em|pire: It would now be thought hard by act of par|liament to oblige the Cinque ports or &s;ea coa&s;ts of Britain to maintain the whole navy, becau&s;e they are more immediately defended by it, not allowing them at the &s;ame time a vote in chu&s;ing members of the parliament; and if the frontiers in America mu&s;t bear the expence of their own defence, it &s;eems hard to allow them no &s;hare in voting the money, judging of the nece&s;&s;ity and &s;um, or advi&s;ing the mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>"That be&s;ides the taxes nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the frontiers, the colonies pay yearly great &s;ums to the mother-country unnoticed: For taxes paid in Britian by the landholder or artificer, mu&s;t enter into and increa&s;e the price of the produce of land and of manufactures made of it; and great part of this is
<PB N="51" REF="52">paid by con&s;umers in the colonies, who thereby pay a con&s;iderable part of the Briti&s;h taxes.</P>
<P>"We are re&s;trained in our trade with foreign na|tions; and where we could be &s;upplied with any ma|nufacture cheaper from them, but mu&s;t buy the &s;ame dearer from Britain, the difference of price is as a clear tax to Britain. We are oblige to carry great part of our produce directly to Britain, and where the duties there laid upon it le&s;&s;en its price to the planter, or it &s;ells for le&s;s than it would in foreign markets, the difference is a tax paid to Britain.</P>
<P>"Some manufactures we could make, but are for|bidden, and mu&s;t take them of Briti&s;h merchants; the whole price of the&s;e is a tax paid to Britain.</P>
<P>"By our greatly increa&s;ing the demand and con|&s;umption of Briti&s;h manufactures, their price is con&s;i|derably rai&s;ed of late years; their advance is clear profit to Britain, and enables its people better to pay great taxes; and much of it being paid by us, is clear tax to Britain.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, as we are not &s;uffered to regulate our trade, and re&s;train the importation and con&s;umption of Briti&s;h &s;uperfluities (as Britain can the con&s;ump|tion of foreign &s;uperfluities) our whole wealth centres finally among the merchants and inhabitants of Bri|tain, and if we make them richer, and enable them better to pay their taxes, it is nearly the &s;ame as being &s;aved our&s;elves, and equally beneficial to the crown.</P>
<P>"The&s;e kind of &s;econdary taxes, however, we do not complain of, though we have no &s;hare in the lay|ing or di&s;po&s;ing of them; but to pay imme|diate heavy taxes, in the laying, appropriation, and di&s;po&s;ition of which we have no part, and which perhaps we may know to be as unnece&s;&s;ary as griev|ous,
<PB N="52" REF="53">mu&s;t &s;eem hard mea&s;ure to Engli&s;hmen, who cannot conceive, that by hazarding their lives and fortunes, in &s;ubduing and &s;ettling new countries, ex|tending the dominion and increa&s;ing the commerce of their mother-nation, they have forfeited the native rights of Britons, which they think ought rather to be given them as due to &s;uch merit, if they had been before in a &s;tate of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>"The&s;e, and &s;uch kind of things as the&s;e, I ap|prehend, will be thought and &s;aid by the people, if the propo&s;ed alteration of the Albany plan &s;hould take place.

<P>"Perhaps I am too apprehen&s;ive in this matter; but having freely given my opinions and rea&s;ons, your excellency can judge better than I whether there be any weight in them, and the &s;hortne&s;s of the time al|lowed me, will, I hope, in &s;ome degree, excu&s;e the imperfections of this &s;crawl.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"Since the conver&s;ation your excellency was plea&s;ed to honour me with, on the &s;ubject of uniting the colonies more intimately with Great Britain, by allowing them repre&s;entatives in parliament, I have
<PB N="53" REF="54">&s;omething further con&s;idered that matter, and am of opinion, that &s;uch an union would be very accepta|ble to the colonies, provided they had a rea&s;onable number of repre&s;entatives allowed them; and that all the old acts of parliament re&s;training the trade or cramp|ing the manufactures of the colonies, be at the &s;ame time repealed, and the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects on this &s;ide the water put, in tho&s;e re&s;pects, on the &s;ame footing with tho&s;e in Great Britain, till the new parliament, repre|&s;enting the whole, &s;hall think it for the intere&s;t of the whole to re-enact &s;ome or all of them: It is not that I imagine &s;o many repre&s;entatives will be allowed the colonies, as to have any great weight by their num|bers; but I think there might be &s;ufficient to occa|&s;ion tho&s;e laws to be better and more impartially con&s;idered, and perhaps to overcome the private in|tere&s;t of a petty corporation, or of any particular &s;et of artificers or traders in England, who heretofore &s;eem, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to have been more regarded than all the colonies, or than was con&s;i&s;tent with the general intere&s;t, or be&s;t national good. I think too, that the government of the colonies by a parliament, in which they are fairly repre&s;ented, would be va&s;tly more agreeable to the people, than the method lately attempted to be introduced by royal in&s;tructions, as well as more agreeable to the nature of an Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and to Engli&s;h liberty; and that &s;uch laws as now &s;eem to bear hard on the colonies, would (when judged by &s;uch a parliament for the be&s;t in|tere&s;t of the whole) be more chearfully &s;ubmitted to, and more ea&s;ily executed.</P>
<P>"I &s;hould hope too, that by &s;uch an union, the people of Great Britain, and the people of the colo|nies, would learn to con&s;ider them&s;elves, not as be|longing to a different community with different in|tere&s;ts,
<PB N="54" REF="55">but to one community with one intere&s;t, which I imagine would contribute to &s;trengthen the whole, and greatly le&s;&s;en the danger of future &s;eparations.</P>
<P>"It is, I &s;uppo&s;e, agreed to be the general in|tere&s;t of any &s;tate, that its people be numerous and rich; men enough to fight in its defence, and enough to pay &s;ufficient taxes to defray the charge; for the&s;e circum&s;tances tend to the &s;ecurity of the &s;tate, and its protection from foreign power: But it &s;eems not of &s;o much importance whether the fighting be done by John or Thomas, or the tax paid by William or Charles. The iron manufacture employs and en|riches Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, but is it of any importance to the &s;tate, whether the manufacturers live at Birming|ham or Sheffield, or both, &s;ince they are &s;till within its bounds, and their wealth and per&s;ons at its com|mand? Could the Goodwin Sands be laid dry by banks, and land equal to a large country thereby gained to England, and pre&s;ently filled with Engli&s;h inhabitants, would it be right to deprive &s;uch inhabi|tants of the common privileges enjoyed by other Eng|li&s;hmen, the right of vending their produce in the &s;ame ports, and of making their own &s;hoes, becau&s;e a merchant, or a &s;hoemaker, living on the old land, might fancy it more for his advantage to trade or make &s;hoes for them? Would this be right, even if the land were gained at the expence of the &s;tate? And would it not &s;eem le&s;s right, if the charge and labour of gaining the additional territory to Britain had been borne by the &s;ettlers them&s;elves? And would not the hard&s;hip appear yet greater, if the people of the new country &s;hould be allowed no repre&s;entatives in the parliament enacting &s;uch impo&s;itions? Now I look on the colonies as &s;o many counties gained to Great Britain, and more advantageous to it than if
<PB N="55" REF="56">they had been gained out of the &s;ea around its coa&s;ts, and joined to its land: For being in different cli|mates, they afford greater variety of produce, and materials for more manufactures; and being &s;epara|ted by the ocean, they increa&s;e much more its &s;hip|ping and &s;eamen; and &s;ince they are included in the Briti&s;h empire, which has only extended it&s;elf by their means; and the &s;trength and wealth of the parts is the &s;trength and wealth of the whole; what imports it to the general &s;tate, whether a merchant, a &s;mith, or a hatter, grow rich in Old or New England? And if, through increa&s;e of people, two &s;miths are wanted for one employed before, why may not the <HI>new</HI> &s;mith be allowed to live and thrive in the <HI>new coun|try,</HI> as well as the <HI>old</HI> one in the <HI>old?</HI> In fine, why &s;hould the countenance of a &s;tate be <HI>partially</HI> afforded to its people, unle&s;s it be mo&s;t in favour of tho&s;e, who have mo&s;t merit? And if there be any difference, tho&s;e who have mo&s;t contributed to enlarge Britain's empire and commerce, encrea&s;e her &s;trength, her wealth, and the numbers of her people, at the ri&s;k of their own lives and private fortunes, in new and &s;trange countries, methinks ought rather to expect &s;ome preference.</P>

<P>It is plain from the above account, which Gover|nor Shirley was intimately acquainted with, that the rea&s;on why the Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts received a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Britain, was becau&s;e the Engli&s;h parliament would not &s;uffer them to defend them&s;elves, but wanted to form plans of operation in a country they
<PB N="56" REF="57">not know, to drain a perpetual tax from the colonies for an occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They were &s;o far from &s;upplicating government for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that they would willingly have done without it, provided they had been permitted to have pur&s;ued their own mea&s;ures. Arguments in favour of a war between the members of the &s;ame empire, ought to be exceedingly plain and &s;elf-evident, and the rea&s;ons of engaging in it &s;o con|vincing to indifferent per&s;ons, and bye-&s;tanders, on the &s;ide of the party which pretends a right to pro&s;e|cute the other, that there &s;hould be nothing doubtful or &s;u&s;picious in the premi&s;es or the conclu&s;ion. Par|tiality and &s;elf-intere&s;t may blind the eyes of the par|ties concerned; but the public at large, or &s;uch as are not engaged in the controver&s;y, will judge according to truth. We &s;hall find in the &s;equel of this hi&s;tory, how differently men have rea&s;oned upon the &s;prings, and cau&s;e of this unhappy and ruinous war, and how different parties have coloured <HI>that</HI> &s;ide of the que|&s;tion they have e&s;pou&s;ed. Arguments, when they are brought to &s;upport &s;anguinary mea&s;ures, had much need to be &s;trong and well founded: Every one of them ought to be as &s;elf-evidently true, and as con&s;i&s;tent with the dictates of the divine mind, as the precepts of the decalogue, otherwi&s;e they ought never to be put in practice.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> The di&s;tre&s;s of the nation through the &s;toppage of trade&mdash; Debates in parliament concerning the repeal of the Stamp Act&mdash;the arguments u&s;ed on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion&mdash;the joy of the nation upon repealing that act&mdash;the right of taxation confirmed, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ANNO DOMINI</HI> 1766.</P>
<P>IT is no wonder when we con&s;ider the tran&s;actions of the preceding two years, that both this country and the colonies were in a di&s;tracted and an unea&s;y &s;ituation; commerce was &s;unk, and the manufactures were in a great mea&s;ure at a &s;tand; provi&s;ions ex|ceedingly dear, and many labourers without employ|ment. Thou&s;ands had no vi&s;ible methods of provi|ding for them&s;elves and families, however willing they were to work to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities. That &s;ource of &s;upply which &s;upported our manufacturers at home was now &s;topped: The coloni&s;ts were neither able nor willing to pay for the goods they had re|ceived, nor were they di&s;po&s;ed to continue their u&s;ual trade with the mother country. In America every thing was in a &s;tate of anarchy and confu&s;ion: The laws were &s;u&s;pended, and the lawle&s;s committed many outrages with impunity. Under a pretence of liberty, bad men gave full reins to their vicious incli|nations, as is common in a &s;tate of univer&s;al commo|tion. The common people, who though they are not in general the mo&s;t vicious, yet are often ea&s;ie&s;t mi&s;led; when they a&s;&s;embled in bodies went into ex|travagances
<PB N="58" REF="59">of the mo&s;t licentious kind. The &s;ober part were not able to re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of a multitude, without law, magi&s;tracy, or order; nor did they find it convenient to u&s;e means to re&s;train a temper, which they perceived might on &s;ome future occa&s;ion, &s;erve the purpo&s;es they had in view. They were de&s;igned to oppo&s;e the &s;tamp act, and they could do nothing without the aid of the people.</P>
<P>There were two things which gave the coloni&s;ts an advantage over our manufacturers at home, they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of large quantities of Briti&s;h goods, which were yet unpaid, and they had an exten&s;ive country, abounding with many nece&s;&s;ary articles fitted for all the conveniences of life. The&s;e prevent|ed them from feeling &s;o &s;martly the immediate effects of this univer&s;al &s;tagnation in bu&s;ine&s;s, occa&s;ioned by the &s;tamp act. To the&s;e may be added the flame of zeal for liberty being put in &s;uch a &s;trong agi|tation by this new law, made them bear difficulties which in other ca&s;es would have been intolerable. Our manufacturers at home not being under the in|fluence of the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m, were ready to de&s;pond and &s;ink at the pro&s;pect of their future di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and as many of them had lavi&s;hly &s;quandered what they had earned by their labour, they had laid nothing up for a time of calamity. They were therefore op|pre&s;&s;ed, without having the &s;ame &s;ource of animation which &s;upported the coloni&s;ts. The millions of debt which the Americans owed the merchants in this country, rendered them incapable to carry on bu&s;ine&s;s as formerly, and the effects of this evil were &s;oon felt &s;everely. The poor rates encrea&s;ed; the poor were ill provided for, and the nation complained; univer|&s;al di&s;content reigned in every quarter of the empire, and the mini&s;try were blamed for all. Some at home
<PB N="59" REF="60">were for enforcing the &s;tamp act by military power at once, and for &s;ending a powerful armament to to give &s;anction to this new act of parliament. Others con&s;idered this mea&s;ure as both impolitic and unnatu|ral; like making one member of the body de&s;troy another, and affirmed that it would be better to repeal the act than wa&s;te any part of the empire with fire and &s;word. This was undoubtedly both a rational and judicious opinion; for though they &s;hould have forced the Americans to have &s;uffered the &s;tamps to have continued, they could not have forced them to have u&s;ed them, excepted they had plea&s;ed, unle&s;s in certain ca&s;es; for provided they had been di&s;po&s;ed to have tru&s;ted one another upon common paper, they would have had no need of &s;tamps to make their deeds legal; nor could they have forced them to have taken all their nece&s;&s;aries from Britain, when they could have, and make them at home, without reducing them to a &s;tate of mere &s;lavery.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try on this occa&s;ion were much perplex|ed: They were pre&s;&s;ed on the one hand to enforce the law by coercive mea&s;ures, and on the other hand de&s;ired to repeal the &s;tamp act. The promoters of the &s;tamp law meant to embarra&s;s the mini&s;try by per&s;uading them to u&s;e violent mea&s;ures, and then the reproach would have fallen upon the mini&s;ter, and they would have been forgotten in the general odium. On the other hand, the courtiers, and their in&s;truments were ready to charge them with &s;acrificing the honour of the nation and the dig|nity of the crown. This mini&s;try, which has &s;ince gone by the name of the Rockingham mini&s;try, met with much oppo&s;ition in all their proceedings, both from &s;ome popular men, and many of another cha|racter; but they pur&s;ued &s;uch mea&s;ures as gained
<PB N="60" REF="61">them credit with the nation, and when they were changed gave up without <HI>pen&s;ion, place,</HI> or <HI>emolument.</HI> I cannot help here reciting a pa&s;&s;age from the An|nual Regi&s;ter, which &s;hews what the mini&s;try had to &s;truggle with at this critical period. Says the author, <Q>&startq;There were not few, that kept aloof from and in due time declared again&s;t the mini&s;try, upon &s;ome &s;ymptoms which appeared early, of their wanting that countenance, which as it has been favoura|ble or adver&s;e, has determined the fortune of the &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;y&s;tems of admini&s;tration for &s;ome years pa&s;t. This part of the oppo&s;ition for very &endq;obvious rea&s;ons, was by much the mo&s;t danger|ous.</Q></P>
<P>But the mini&s;try had what few &s;ince can pretend to, fair and clear characters, and though they were young in office, were in high e&s;teem with the nation; their integrity was above &s;u&s;picion, and their abilities &s;eemed to encrea&s;e with the difficulties of their em|ployment. Their con&s;tant attachment to the cau&s;e of liberty had procured them the confidence and goodwill of the people, both which they enjoyed in a very exalted degree. This &s;hewed both their good &s;en&s;e, and the &s;oundne&s;s of their principles, that though they were in an immediate &s;en&s;e the &s;ervants of the &s;overeign, yet they would not employ their power and authority for any other purpo&s;e ex|cept the good of the &s;ubjects. Con&s;idering the diffi|culties they had to combat, they &s;hewed as much po|litical wi&s;dom and &s;agacity as any mini&s;ters have done for many years. And it is no reproach to the me|mory of Mr Pitt, to affirm that they behaved with as much wi&s;dom and &s;teadine&s;s, in as difficult a &s;ituation, as ever was exemplified in his mini&s;try. They had a multitude of jarring intere&s;ts to reconcile, a divided
<PB N="61" REF="62">empire to unite, and the mi&s;carriages of the pa&s;t mi|ni&s;try to rectify; and be&s;ides an animo&s;ity among brethren to overcome, which is wor&s;e to remove than even to conquer an enemy.</P>
<P>What their enemies imagined was impo&s;&s;ible for them to accompli&s;h, they effected; they both pre&s;erved the dignity of the crown and nation, and prevented the &s;ubjects from de&s;troying one another. All their de|&s;patches to the different governors, were delivered with firmne&s;s and temper, which, when they were examined before the commons did them great honour; they were found neither to have driven the colonies to de&s;peration, nor to have yielded up the dignity of the crown and nation in any particular. In this admini|&s;tration the Duke of Richmond was one of the &s;ecre|taries of &s;tate, who&s;e abilities as well as integrity has &s;ince, &s;hone forth con&s;picuou&s;ly on the &s;ide of true pa|trioti&s;m. It may be pre&s;umed that he had a &s;hare in the wi&s;e direction of mea&s;ures at this time.</P>
<P>The prudent management of the mini&s;try on this occa&s;ion, was &s;everely cen&s;ured by tho&s;e who were then and have been &s;ince for violent mea&s;ures; their conduct was called weak, pu&s;illanimous, and feeble, their mea&s;ures undetermined and without de&s;ign. But the rea&s;on of this cen&s;ure was obvious; they &s;aw that by the repeal of mea&s;ures which they had pro|moted, di&s;grace would fall upon them, and they wanted to &s;ee the executive power embarra&s;&s;ed be|fore the meeting of parliament &s;o far, that the legi&s;la|ture could not in honour recede from &s;upporting it. For this rea&s;on the moderation of the Rockingham admini&s;tration was mo&s;t &s;everely cen&s;ured by the op|po&s;ition. The controver&s;y began now to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at large, and many pamphlets were publi&s;hed on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, with very little temper. Had the
<PB N="62" REF="63">cau&s;e depended upon the clearne&s;s and force of ar|gument, or had each party put them&s;elves in the others place for a little time, the controver&s;y might &s;oon have been ended. But when per&s;ons in power form arguments concerning the rights of other men, they are often ready to be &s;o blinded with the intoxica|ting idea of dominion, that they cannot perceive the truth clearly; and tho&s;e who defend their own rights when they have a jealou&s;y of government, are ready to mingle envy with &s;ound rea&s;oning. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that men under the influence of the &s;pirit of party, will clearly &s;ee and admit all the force of their opponents arguments; after times will determine with more impartiality and ju&s;tne&s;s which of the ar|guments u&s;ed in this di&s;pute are the mo&s;t &s;olid and convincing. The impartial hi&s;torian cannot help in his own judgment to take a &s;ide; but with regard to his determinations for others, ought not to be too po|&s;itive. I &s;hall as briefly as po&s;&s;ible give an ab&s;tract of the arguments on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and leave the reader to determine for him&s;elf on which &s;ide the truth re&s;ts. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that while the colonies carry their ideas of liberty to the highe&s;t pitch, their opponents &s;eem to imagine that a per&s;on by becoming a coloni&s;t, forfeits every birthright and privilege of an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>When the point concerning the right of taxation came to be debated in parliament, it was &s;aid upon the &s;ide of the colonies, "That by going up to magna charta, and referring to &s;everal writs upon record, i&s;&s;ued out for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing taxes for the crown, and for &s;ending repre&s;entatives to parliament, as well as from the bill of rights, it appears through|out the whole hi&s;tory of our con&s;titution, that no Briti&s;h &s;ubject can be taxed except per <HI>communem
<PB N="63" REF="64">con&s;en&s;um parliamenti,</HI> that is, of him&s;elf or his own repre&s;entative; and this is that fir&s;t and general right as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, with which the fir&s;t inhabitants of the colonies emigrated; for the right does not de|pend upon their charters: the charters were but the exterior modeling of the con&s;titution of the colonies: but the great interior fundamental of their con&s;titu|tion, is this general right of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, which is the very fir&s;t principle of Briti&s;h liberty,&mdash;No man &s;hall be taxed but by him&s;elf, or by his repre|&s;entative.</P>
<P>"That the counties palatine of Che&s;ter, Durham, and Lanca&s;ter, were not taxed but in their own a&s;&s;em|blies or parliament; till at different periods in our hi&s;tory they were melted into our pre&s;ent form of par|liamentary repre&s;entation. That the body of the clergy till very lately taxed them&s;elves, and granted the king benevolences. That the marches of Wales had a right of taxing them&s;elves, till they had &s;ent members to parliament. And from this circum&s;tance has continued the &s;tile of the king's proclamations and of our acts of parliament to this day, although unnece&s;&s;arily to be named, e&s;pecially the principality of Wales, and the town of Monmouth, as they do that of Berwick.</P>
<P>"That many people carry their idea of a parlia|ment too far, in &s;uppo&s;ing that a parliament can do every thing: but that is not true, and if it were, it is not right con&s;titutionally, for there might be an arbi|trary power in parliament as well as in one man. There are many things a parliament cannot do. It cannot make it&s;elf executive, nor di&s;po&s;e of offices that belong to the crown. It cannot take any man's pro|perty, even that of the meane&s;t cottager, as in the ca&s;es of inclo&s;ures, without his being heard.</P>
<PB N="64" REF="65">
<P>"The lords cannot reject a money bill from the commons, nor the commons erect them&s;elves into a court of ju&s;tice. The parliament could not tax the clergy, till &s;uch time as they were repre&s;ented in par|liament. Nor can the parliament of England tax Ire|land. The charters of the colonies, which are deri|ved from the prerogative, are in fact only &s;o many grants from the crown, are not the only rights the colonies have to being repre&s;ented before they are taxed: they as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects take up their rights and liberties from a higher origin than their charters only. They take them up from the &s;ame origin and foundation, from whence they flow to all Engli&s;h|men, from magna charta, and the natural right of the &s;ubject. By that rule of right, the charters of the colonies, like all other crown grants, are to be re|&s;tricted and interpreted, for the benefit, not the pre|judice of the &s;ubjects. Had the fir&s;t inhabitants of the colonies renounced all connection with their mo|ther country, they might have renounced their ori|ginal right; but when they emigrated under the au|thority of the crown, and the national &s;anction, they went out from hence at the hazard of their lives and fortunes, with all the fir&s;t great privileges of Engli&s;h|men on their backs. But at the &s;ame they were not bound, nor could be bound by the penal laws of this country, from the &s;everity of which they fled, to cli|mates remote from the heavy hand of power; and which they hoped to find more friendly to their prin|ciples of civil and religious liberty. It is upon this ground that it has been univer&s;ally received as law, that no acts of parliament made here, and particu|larly tho&s;e which enact any penalties, are binding upon the coloni&s;ts, unle&s;s they are expre&s;ly named. The inhabitants of the colonies once removed from the
<PB N="65" REF="66">dome&s;tic legi&s;lation of the mother country, are no more dependent upon it in the general &s;y&s;tem, than the <HI>I&s;le of Man is,</HI> or than in the feudal &s;y&s;tem of Europe, many &s;ubordinate principalities are depen|dent on the juri&s;diction of the <HI>Seignior Suzerain,</HI> or Lord Paramount, but owing only a limited obedience.</P>
<P>"It is not meant by what has been &s;aid, to affect the ca&s;e of any external duties laid upon their ports, or of any re&s;trictions which by the act of navigation, or other acts, are laid upon their commerce; for they are in the &s;ame ca&s;e as all other colonies belong|ing to the re&s;t of the maritime powers in Europe, who have &s;hut up their colonies, which outgrew their mother countries, &s;uch as Carthage, the north|ern emigrants, &amp;c. Precedents were al&s;o quoted from what happened in the Netherlands, and other places, which &s;hould &s;erve as a beacon to warn us from pur&s;uing &s;uch mea&s;ures as brought about tho&s;e revolutions."</P>
<P>The arguments that were u&s;ed without doors on both &s;ides were much of the &s;ame naturewith the following: "What a noi&s;e" &s;ays an advocate on the one &s;ide "have we had of late about Ame|rican charters, American legi&s;lation, American free|holders, and the privileges of tho&s;e freeholders? But is there any legi&s;lation in America? Are there any freeholders there? No man who knows any thing of the law of England will a&s;&s;ert that there is any legi&s;lation in America, or one freeholder in that part of the world. The king has no power of legi&s;|lation, and he cannot by his charters convey to any cla&s;s of his &s;ubjects a power not re&s;ident in the crown. The parliament, including his maje&s;ty, as the head thereof, has a power of legi&s;lation, but they po&s;&s;e&s;s that power unalienably.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="67">
<P>"The power of legi&s;lation is not a chattel to be di&s;po&s;ed of by grant or other conveyance. It is a tru&s;t granted by the common law for the good of the community, and for their good mu&s;t remain with the augu&s;t body in which it re&s;ides. The power of ma|king bye-laws, for the utility of &s;ubordinate bodies politic, is a quite different affair. That power is of|ten created by the parliament, which has e&s;&s;entially, in it&s;elf, all the powers of government. But charters from the crown not confirmed in parliament, can convey no juri&s;diction whatever, becau&s;e the king is not the fountain of law, as he is of honour.</P>
<P>"All our courts from tho&s;e in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall to tho&s;e in manors, are founded on the cu&s;tom of England <HI>time out of mind,</HI> or upon the law of the land; that is, <HI>&s;tatutes made in parliament.</HI> The par|liament only can create <HI>new courts</HI> and new juri&s;dic|tions. But as the king mu&s;t govern by the law, he cannot make that law upon which his authority re&s;ts, nor by his charters convey to others a power which he enjoys not.</P>
<P>"Every foot of ground in England lies in &s;ome manor, which is it&s;elf the creature of cu&s;tom <HI>time out of mind.</HI> The&s;e manors antiently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all juri&s;|diction civil and criminal; and this juri&s;diction was exerted in the court of freeholders, in which the lord, or his &s;teward, was the judge, the freeholders &s;erving as jurors by virtue of their freeholds. Thus you &s;ee that our freeholders are, by virtue of their freehold, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a radical judicative authority in manors, which they are entitled to by the common law, and po&s;&s;e&s;s their e&s;tates by the &s;ame tenure, by which his maje&s;ty holds his crown. They are indebt|ed to no prince for this e&s;tate and judicative autho|rity thereto appendant. Their title to their lands is
<PB N="67" REF="68">a title of independence, and in every re&s;pect equal to the royal title by which the crown is held.</P>
<P>"And as the&s;e freehold e&s;tates are of a very par|ticular nature with re&s;pect to their origin, &s;o they are conveyed in a very particular manner. They can|not be taken by a writ of <HI>fieri facias.</HI> And if they are &s;eized by a writ of <HI>elegit,</HI> one moiety only of the e&s;tate can be applied, for payment of the debt and co&s;ts on which the judgment is founded, the other moiety mu&s;t remain for his &s;upport and maintenance. The free|hold de&s;cends to the heir, di&s;charged of all debts, or &s;pecialties.</P>
<P>"Now, we have &s;een what an Engli&s;h freehold is. Are there any &s;uch e&s;tates in America? I am certain there are not. There can be no manors in that part of the world, for we can &s;hew the origin of their te|nures. Their properties, pretended legi&s;lative autho|rity, and the exi&s;tence of what they call freeholds can be traced from prerogative. Are our freeholds ow|ing to human beneficence? No; We can name &s;eve|ral per&s;ons who oppre&s;&s;ed us, but the Americans can point out none who have conferred upon us our e&s;tates, or any privileges whatever. Is there an e&s;tate in America which may not be taken by the &s;ame writ that takes in execution a negro or a hor&s;e? The whole cour&s;e of chancery proves that their e&s;tates are only commercial chattles, &s;ubject to the di&s;po&s;ition of the la&s;t will of the owner, and chargeable with all the debts of the decea&s;ed proprietor. And le&s;t any doubt &s;hould ari&s;e about the propriety of the&s;e decrees in equity, equalizing a foreign plantation to a per&s;onal e&s;tate, there was a &s;tatute made in the fifth year of the preceding reign declarative of the common law in this re&s;pect, and &s;tatuting that foreign plantations &s;hould only be regarded in the light of per&s;onal e&s;tates.
<PB N="68" REF="69">After that law, what man in his right &s;en&s;es can digni|fy tho&s;e e&s;tates with the name of freeholds?</P>
<P>"The American e&s;tates are de&s;titute of the principal charactere&s;tic of a freehold. They are derived from royal grants for the improvement of commerce. The pretended American freeholders are not original mem|bers of any court, by virtue of their freeholds. They have no manors, nor manor-courts in America, and con&s;equently no courts to which the pretended Ame|rican freeholders repair, by virtue of their freeholds, and in con&s;equence of a title paramount to all human laws. Why then &s;hould they pretend to equalize their &s;uppo&s;ed freeholders with ours? An ab&s;olute ig|norance of law and common-&s;en&s;e could only give birth to &s;uch injudicious conduct. Our freeholders have a &s;hare in the legi&s;lation; becau&s;e by cu&s;toms as ancient as tho&s;e that e&s;tabli&s;h government, they are entitled to rule in a certain di&s;trict of the kingdom. Can the Americans boa&s;t of the exi&s;tence of any &s;uch cu&s;toms among them, or of e&s;tates and judicative authority derived out of the&s;e cu&s;toms? Why then &s;hould they pretend to be freeholders, and as &s;uch only &s;ubject to the legi&s;lation of their own election,</P>
<P>"The Americans will, perhaps, reply, that they &s;erve on Juries when called by the King's writ into the &s;upreme court of their re&s;pective provinces. But this happens not as with us by the excellency of te|nures, who&s;e origin is unknown, but is owing to the grace of tho&s;e princes who, without the authority of law, granted them that con&s;titution. Are tenures flowing from the prince equal to tenures held inde|pendent of the crown? &s;urely not. The Americans have no rights but from royal grants; and of con&s;e|quence tho&s;e rights mu&s;t not be extended beyond their natural meaning, or interpreted to the prejudice of
<PB N="69" REF="70">tho&s;e who, by an inherent right, independent of the crown, govern the whole kingdom. The privileges of per&s;ons claiming under &s;o high a tenure, cannot be impaired by deeds from the crown, and con&s;equently the government of our parliament mu&s;t reach over all the Engli&s;h dominions, as if no &s;uch grants had been made, and no e&s;tates derived out of them."</P>
<P>A writer on the other &s;ide &s;ays, "The que&s;tion if properly under&s;tood, is not concerning a <HI>three-penny &s;tamp,</HI> but <HI>liberty.</HI> Not <HI>that</HI> liberty which is the tool of contending parties, the key to power, or the revi|ler of a mini&s;ter's cradle; but <HI>that</HI> true and genuine liberty which expands and ennobles the heart of the poore&s;t freeholder, and prevents his property from being touched, but by the permi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who by the con&s;titution are his repre&s;entatives in parliament.</P>
<P>"The infatuation of &s;ome people here, while they endeavour by the mo&s;t frivolous arguments, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a right to tax America, in direct violation of this animating principle of their con&s;titution, is to the la&s;t degree deplorable&punc; It &s;hall be my endeavours to &s;hew here in a few words, how &s;uch a right would be di|rectly &s;ubver&s;ive of our con&s;titution, and therefore of our liberties. And here, I &s;hall not enter into the que&s;tion whether America be in the manor of Ea&s;t-Greenwich, (a frivolous equivocation derived from the ca&s;ual u&s;e of this expre&s;&s;ion in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's charter of King Charles the &s;econd) nor yet whether American corn be <HI>indige&s;tible</HI> or <HI>unpalatable,</HI> (though I profe&s;s I think it exceedingly palatable) becau&s;e the&s;e do not &s;eem to me to be quite pertinent to the di&s;pute, and are indeed unworthy refutation or animadver&s;ion. The lands in America are as much freehold and derive that tenure from the &s;ame hand, as are the lands of England; and the holders of them, on the &s;ame tenure,
<PB N="70" REF="71">are as much freeholders as tho&s;e of England. Now it mu&s;t be known to every one, that, at this day, there is not a freeholder in England who does not give his vote for a repre&s;entative in the a&s;&s;embly of the com|mons of England; who from thence derive their name, and their &s;ole right of taxing the property of the peo|ple. Nor is there any freeholder in the nation &s;o ig|norant of his right, and of the foundation of his li|berty, that he would not complain of a violation of it if he were deprived of the privilege of voting for &s;uch a repre&s;entative; yet we are &s;ubjecting the Ameri|can freeholders to that very grievance, of which we our&s;elves would complain as de&s;tructive of our freedom; we are &s;ubjecting them to be taxed by repre&s;enta|tives, in the election of whom they have not one voice. They are freeholders as we are, they choo&s;e repre|&s;entatives to tax them as we do; and it &s;eems incon|&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the freedom of the common people, that the property of a freeholder &s;hould be taxed by any repre&s;entatives but tho&s;e for which he votes, and thereby empowers to tax him. Let the ca&s;e, for a moment, be our own, and &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves liable to be taxed by repre&s;entatives cho&s;en by the freeholders of America; &s;hould we he&s;itate an in&s;tant in decla|ring it an ab&s;olute violation of our liberty, and a &s;lavi&s;h impo&s;ition? Therefore the right of taxing the Ame|rican freeholders, which &s;ome would e&s;tabli&s;h here, mu&s;t needs &s;eem as uncon&s;titutional and arbitrary with re&s;pect to the Americans. With what ju&s;tice then can we thus attempt to violate the liberty of the Americans? Is not this the height of infatua|tion?</P>
<P>"Having thus proved, upon fair and unque&s;tion|able principles, that we can have no right to tax
<PB N="71" REF="72">the freeholders in America, I &s;hall add a word or two upon what is termed a <HI>rebellion</HI> in America. The only occurrences there, which can have given the lea&s;t ground for &s;uch a charge, are the tumultous proceedings of the mob, and the re&s;olves of the a&s;&s;emblies. With regard to the former, I would only beg leave to a&s;k, whether it is u&s;ual to call the riotous actions of a mob, rebellion? Were the weavers, when they a&s;&s;embled together, &s;urrounded the parliament-hou&s;e, offered mo&s;t dangerous violance to the coach of a noble peer, and if I mi&s;take not, did him a per&s;onal injury, attempted to pull down his hou&s;e, and a&s;&s;aulted his maje&s;ty's guards with &s;tones, &s;o as to occa&s;ion the death of &s;ome of them, were they called <HI>rebels or rioters?</HI> Has the American mob been more outrageous? and are they and the whole coloni&s;ts of America, who never were guilty of any &s;uch riots, to be branded with the mo&s;t odious and dete&s;ted name of <HI>rebels?</HI> Let us now con&s;ider how far the re&s;olves of the American a&s;&s;emblies can be called rebellious. I have already proved, that England can have no right to tax America. The &s;tamp-act &s;eemed to them therefore uncon&s;titutional, and a direct violation of the rights of the American a&s;&s;emblies, who are the true and only repre&s;entatives of the freeholders, and have the &s;ole con&s;titutional right of taxing their property. The a&s;&s;emblies, by their re&s;olves, immediately a&s;&s;erted their rights, and remon&s;trated again&s;t this infringement of them, with a &s;pirit and freedom which was well worthy the free repre&s;entatives of a free people; and can this be termed rebellion? In France, in Germany, in A&s;ia, it might have been e&s;teemed &s;uch; and is it not a melancholy proof, that this country is degenerating into their &s;ervile &s;tate and abject &s;entiments, when
<PB N="72" REF="73">the voice of freedom, and the a&s;&s;ertion of liberty, meet with the &s;ame e&s;timation? The American a&s;|&s;emblies were impelled to the&s;e re&s;olves by the &s;trong|e&s;t motives of ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, to their con&s;titu|ents, and to their po&s;terity. Had they tamely &s;ur|rendered their liberties, they had been the mo&s;t contemptible of mankind; they bravely a&s;&s;erted them, and are&mdash;"</P>
<P>There is no other method to convince either party of the weakne&s;s of their arguments, than fir&s;t to make them con&s;ider whether the authority to tax belongs to England or to Engli&s;hmen, and provided the pre|&s;ent inhabitants who are now in England were in A|merica, and the coloni&s;ts in England, would the right of taxation be continued or altered? If it belong to this country in con&s;equence of the right of manor|&s;hip, whoever &s;ucceeds to the manors mu&s;t have a claim of right to liberty, and nobody el&s;e; and if the coloni&s;ts were to change with the pre&s;ent inhabitants, they would have a right to tax them, which they would not be ready to &s;ubmit to? The claims of &s;o exten&s;ive liberty as the coloni&s;ts require, appear in|con&s;i&s;tent with their former connections with their mother country, and the authority which the mother country claims as her right over the coloni&s;ts, makes her rather a &s;tep-mother than a kind parent. Were they to change &s;ituations, neither the one nor the other would incline to have &s;uch treatment, as they on this occa&s;ion were di&s;po&s;ed to give each other. Up|on the principles of nature and rea&s;on the coloni&s;ts main arguments cannot be confuted; upon the mutual policy of the pre&s;ent government of the empire they have no force. It is a part of the unhappine&s;s of all the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tems of government, that in them rea|&s;on and policy are frequently at variance, and the pa&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="73" REF="74">and intere&s;ts of leading men, prevail more power|fully, than the general good of &s;ociety. It is the be&s;t government where a ju&s;t balance is kept,&mdash;where the intere&s;t of every man is the general good of the whole. This is a maxim that might be practi&s;ed pro|vided policy was founded upon morality; but in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of nations it is only a &s;peculation, which is a great pity.</P>
<P>Two bills were brought in this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, one for &s;ecuring the dependency of the colonies up|on the mother country, and another for repealing the &s;tamp-act. The fir&s;t met with no oppo&s;ition, the lat|ter was warmly di&s;puted.</P>
<P>The enemies of the mini&s;try, who were many of them, under a &s;ecret influence, which &s;ome think has been baneful to the&s;e kingdoms, &s;trained every nerve to prevent the repeal of the &s;tamp-act. Argu|ments were drawn from the outrageou&s;ne&s;s of the be|haviour of the Americans, and the in&s;ult they had of|fered to the dignity of the Engli&s;h government, and the con&s;equences that would follow provided the act was repealed.&mdash;That it would &s;hew &s;uch weakne&s;s and pu&s;illanimity in government, as would encourage the Coloni&s;ts to give fre&s;h affronts, and le&s;&s;en the re|&s;pect of the King's &s;ubjects to the dignity of the crown, and the authority of the laws. It was urged further, that as the power of taxation was an e&s;&s;ential branch of authority, it ought in ju&s;tice to be exerci&s;ed over all the members of the empire, in proportion to their &s;everal abilities; that it would &s;hew a degree of partia|lity unworthy of good government, to exempt one part of the &s;ubjects from a duty which others were obliged to pay, and from burdens which the re&s;t of the commu|nity were under a nece&s;&s;ity to bear.&mdash;That it was con|trary to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed by the people in the legi&s;la|ture,
<PB N="74" REF="75">and tended to de&s;troy all confidence upon which government is founded. It was denied that the colo|ni&s;ts were unable to bear the weight of the tax impo|&s;ed by the &s;tamp-act; and it was a&s;&s;erted as an in&s;tance to the contrary, that if the debt contracted by them in the la&s;t war, 1,755,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> had been already paid in the cour&s;e of only three years, that the far greater part of their remaining burden, amounting to 760,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> would be di&s;charged in two years more. Other arguments were u&s;ed; the general burden of the mother country, the ability of the Coloni&s;ts, their exemption from all taxation, and their peremptory re|fu&s;al to contribute to any relief from the public load of debt that the nation groaned under.</P>
<P>It was replied that &s;everal of the&s;e objections had no weight in them, as all the con&s;equences they &s;up|po&s;ed were guarded again&s;t by the bill for &s;ecuring the dependence of the colonies upon the mother country, which both &s;ecured the dignity of Great-Britain, and her con&s;titutional &s;uperiority over Ame|rica. In &s;upport of the repeal, it was argued that the coloni&s;ts had really borne their proper &s;hare of the public burdens according to the confe&s;&s;ion of the other party; for the heavy debt which they had contracted during the war was a &s;ufficient proof that they had contributed largely to the public expence; and their being paid back a part of it &s;ince, was a convincing evidence that the parliament were per|&s;uaded they had done more than they were well able to do. It was further urged that nothing could be more di&s;tant from the fact, than the a&s;&s;ertion that they paid no taxes; for they even paid many which the parliament had impo&s;ed upon them. They paid port duties, which lay heavy upon their trade before the impo&s;ing of the &s;tamp-act, be&s;ides many port du|ties
<PB N="75" REF="76">laid on by the authority of the provinces; many exci&s;es; a land-tax in many provinces, an heavy poll-tax; be&s;ides a faculty-tax upon all per&s;onal e&s;tates, and acqui&s;itions, amounting in &s;ome provinces to five or &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound; &s;o that the a&s;|&s;ertion of their not being taxed, or contributing to the public expence, was totally without foundation.</P>
<P>The friends of the mini&s;try, and of the coloni&s;ts, demon&s;trated that the Americans were poor, and were indebted four millions to the merchants in Bri|tain; who, as they were creditors to &s;uch an amount, were really the proprietors of a great part of what the Americans &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s: That the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of manufactures in America, by obliging them to take every &s;ort which they u&s;ed, from Britain, was making them pay, in one &s;pecies of taxation, all other kinds of taxes; and in fact, making them the chief &s;upporters of public burdens. Con&s;idering their great di&s;tance from this country, it was urged that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the people here to be &s;o well ac|quainted with the &s;tate of American affairs, as to be able to judge minutely concerning the propriety of a revenue tax: That without being well acquainted with the &s;tate of the coloni&s;ts, we, in this country might be ready to oppre&s;s them, which government &s;hould above all things, endeavour to avoid: That it was the be&s;t policy to keep to commercial views, and pur&s;ue the advantages that attended them, which would le&s;s oppre&s;s the coloni&s;ts, and would enable them &s;ooner to pay their debts to our merchants.&mdash;The&s;e are a few of the arguments on both &s;ides, on this occa&s;ion, and it will be allowed by all who are clear of prejudice, that the mini&s;try had the better in this di&s;pute. <HI>Ju&s;tice, &s;ound policy, clemency,</HI> and <HI>hu|manity</HI> were united in their rea&s;onings; whereas the
<PB N="76" REF="77">oppo&s;ition breathed <HI>domination, tyranny,</HI> and <HI>de|&s;truction</HI> through the whole of this debate.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the violence and vigour of tho&s;e in oppo&s;ition, and all the &s;ecret influence of an invi|&s;ible power, the bill pa&s;&s;ed, upon a divi&s;ion, by a ma|jority of 275 to 167, and was carried up to the lords by above two hundred members of the hou&s;e of com|mons. The approbation with which it was intro|duced into the upper hou&s;e, did not &s;ecure it from a vigorous oppo&s;ition: Thirty-three lords entered a prote&s;t again&s;t it at the &s;econd reading, and twenty-eight at the third reading: It was however carried by a majority of thirty-four lords, and in three days received the royal a&s;&s;ent. The repeal of this law, was the cau&s;e of more univer&s;al joy through the domi|nions of Britain, than probably ever was known by any one event. It could not but do the hearts of the promoters of this appeal good, to &s;ee and hear of &s;o many millions of their fellow-&s;ubjects rejoicing and exulting at an event which proceeded from the wi&s;|dom, benevolence, ju&s;tice, and clemency, of men whom they had entru&s;ted with their concerns. There was more true glory to the king, the parliament, and the mini&s;try, in repealing this act, than if they had all united to enforce it by fleets and armies, fire and &s;word. There can be little true glory in forcing laws by military execution, but there is much honour in making &s;uch &s;tatutes or repealing them, as give joy to a whole empire. This is one of the glories of the pre&s;ent reign, and for the &s;ake of this noble act of wi&s;dom, every humane per&s;on will be ready to for|give an hundred faults. Whatever may happen in future times, it may be &s;aid that George the Third had once a wi&s;e mini&s;try, and put his hand to a noble and illu&s;trious deed. In all ca&s;es that are problematical
<PB N="77" REF="78">nothing di&s;plays the wi&s;dom of a legi&s;lature more than the pur&s;uing mea&s;ures that are lenient in their own nature, and tend to conciliate the affections of the &s;ubjects to government. The infirmities of human nature require that the exertions of government &s;hould be tender, and that power which is lodged in the hands of governors to pre&s;erve men's lives, &s;hould never be employed to de&s;troy them, as long as any other method can be adopted.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o this &s;e&s;&s;ions a bill brought in and pa&s;|&s;ed, for &s;ecuring the dependance of the colonies upon Great Britain; and another for granting indemni|ty to &s;uch as had incurred penalties on account of the &s;tamp-act, and an order made by government, that the provinces of North America &s;hould indemnify &s;uch as had &s;uffered by the late riots, by making a com|pen&s;ation for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained, which they &s;ome time after accordingly did. The cyder-act was al&s;o repealed, and another duty laid on in the place of it, &s;o that one popular law &s;ucceeded another, and the mini&s;try encrea&s;ed in popularity as they were envied by tho&s;e in oppo&s;ition. The &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from the repeal of this act was heightened in propor|tion to the degree of di&s;content that had ari&s;en from the pa&s;&s;ing of it, and the cyder counties ta&s;ted the &s;ame plea&s;ure with their brethren in America, which they enjoyed at the &s;ame time, and te&s;tified their thank|fulne&s;s by univer&s;al joy. As men in growing really wi&s;er generally grow better, &s;o as the mini&s;try encrea&s;|ed in wi&s;dom, they proceeded in promoting acts of utili|ty. By their conferences with the merchants in North America, and tho&s;e of the We&s;t Indies, they acquir|ed more knowledge of their trade, and the method of conducting it, and by virtue of &s;ome petitions from tra|ding towns in England, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed for opening free
<PB N="78" REF="79">ports in the We&s;t Indies under certain limitations and re&s;trictions. Several new and important regulations were likewi&s;e made in the general &s;y&s;tem of com|merce in the colonies, and &s;ome re&s;trictions taken off, that had been long complained of, as an heavy clog upon trade and bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e popular acts made the mini&s;try the idol of the mercantile part of the nation, who could not help being highly plea&s;ed at the attention which had been paid to their intere&s;ts, &s;o different, from what former admini&s;trations had generally practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Some other acts and re&s;olutions were pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, which all tended either to ea&s;e, or re|move the burdens of the people; among which may be reckoned the repeal of the old duties upon hou&s;es and windows, and the new bill, by which the duties are much more equitably laid on, and more ea&s;y to the lower and middling degrees of people. It was al&s;o re&s;olved that the taking up of people by ge|neral warrants, or the &s;eizing of their papers, ex|cept in &s;uch ca&s;es as are pre&s;cribed by acts of parlia|ment are illegal.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try had hitherto &s;ucceeded in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous manner; they had weathered the &s;torm of oppo&s;ition during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, and gained every point they had attempted in parliament. They had &s;ecured the confidence and good will of the public, in the highe&s;t degree; they al&s;o had aquired &s;ome credit in their foreign tran&s;actions: an advantageous commer|cial treaty had been concluded with the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, and the long conte&s;ted Canada bills, were &s;ettled, to the &s;atisfaction of the owners; and they had made &s;ome progre&s;s in reviving the long neglected affair of the Manila ran&s;om. Such now was the &s;ucce&s;s of the mini&s;try, that it was now thought that they
<PB N="79" REF="80">were &s;ecurely &s;ettled and fixed in their pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion. It was at this time, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the whole nation, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e appearances the mini&s;try was changed. The pre&s;ent reign had hither|to been remarkable for changes of this &s;ort, and the rea&s;on generally a&s;&s;igned for this political phaenomo|non was, that a &s;ecret influence of an invi&s;ible agent which did not appear publickly directed the &s;prings of government, and produced &s;o many and various revolu|tions in the mini&s;try. Whether this opinion proceeded from jealou&s;y or &s;ome other cau&s;e I will not pretend to determine, but it was the general belief of the public at that time, upon whatever principle it might be founded. Such a &s;udden overturn in the mini&s;terial department, when all the nation applauded the mea|&s;ures of government, could not be accounted for, upon any rational principle of operation; for as the mini&s;try were the &s;ervants whom the king had ap|pointed to manage the public affairs of the nation, and they had di&s;charged their duty with univer&s;al ap|probation, the turning them out of office when they were &s;o agreeable to the public, &s;eemed to declare, that the intere&s;ts of the king and the nation were different, or that the &s;overeign did not &s;u&s;tain the people proper judges of their own intere&s;ts. The mini&s;try fini&s;hed their career with &s;o much honour to them&s;elves, and &s;atisfaction to the nation, and withal, behaved in &s;uch a di&s;intere&s;ted manner, that their po|pularity increa&s;ed after their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from their of|fice. They had gained nothing to them&s;elves, and &s;ecured nothing to their friends, and retired without place, pen&s;ion, or emolument. The public expre&s;&s;ed the &s;en&s;e they had of their &s;ervices, by numerous addre&s;&s;es pre&s;ented to the marquis of Rockingham on this occa&s;ion, while they &s;hewed their di&s;plea&s;ure at
<PB N="80" REF="81">di&s;placing men, who had behaved &s;o worthily in the execution of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. Upon the goth of July the Duke of Grafton was appointed fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury, in the place of the Marquis of Rockingham; the Earl of Shelburne, &s;ecretary of &s;tate in the room of the Duke of Richmond; Lord Cambden, lord high chancellor, in the place of the Earl of Northington, the Right Honourable Charles Town&s;hend, in the room of the Right Honourable William Dowde&s;well, and the Right Honourable William Pitt, lately created Vi&s;count Pin&s;ent, and Earl of Chatham, lord privy &s;eal. Many other changes took place, in the different departments of govern|ment, which by no means &s;eemed to en&s;ure a long continuance of this new admini&s;tration. Though &s;ome popular men were not admitted into admini&s;tra|tion, the public con&s;idered this only as a &s;eheme of the favourite, to le&s;&s;en their popularity, and bring them into di&s;e&s;teem with the nation. This mini&s;try was &s;omething like the king of Babylon's image, which he &s;aw in his dream, partly iron and partly clay. It was fore&s;een that men of &s;uch different principles, would not long unite, in carrying on a &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment. Lord Chatham, by dividing the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e that were the favourites of the nation, &s;unk greatly in his popularity, and his receiving a place, pen&s;ion, and title, contributed not a little to deface his former greatne&s;s. Such is the uncertainty of human applau&s;e and popularity, that what is gained by dilligence and hard application, may be lo&s;t in an in&s;tant of time beyond recovery.</P>
<P>The new mini&s;try came to their office at a time, when circum&s;tances combined to render their duty a ta&s;k of great difficulty; they not only &s;uceeded a &s;et of men who were popular and &s;ucce&s;sful, but found
<PB N="81" REF="82">new difficulties ari&s;e which they had not fore&s;een, or would perceive. The prices of provi&s;ions were now come to an exorbitant height, and the poor of the nation were in great di&s;tre&s;s; there was no ju&s;t proportion between the price of tho&s;e articles that are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to human life, and the value of the money that could be obtained by daily labour. The corn was exported to other countries, and the poor at home were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: this occa&s;ioned mobs, riots and di&s;orders in the nation, and produced many unhappy con&s;equences. In the month of Sep|tember a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, to prohibit the im|portation of corn, and me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent to the &s;ea-ports to &s;ee that the terms of the proclamation were ob&s;erved, and to prevent &s;uch &s;hips as were loaded from &s;ailing with their cargoes. This procla|mation, though it was well intended, was illegal, and was an a&s;&s;uming of a power which the con&s;titution does not permit to the crown; it was therefore the foun|dation of &s;everal &s;evere debates in parliament. Though the expedient at the time was both nece&s;&s;ary and po|pular, yet the mode of the tran&s;action was con&s;ider|ed by the more di&s;cerning as a thing dangerous, as thereby the crown a&s;&s;umed a power to di&s;pen&s;e with the laws of the land. This was one of tho&s;e evils which had been mo&s;t effectually provided again&s;t at the revolution; at which time, it had been declared to be utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Engli&s;h con&s;titu|tion, and contrary to the known laws, &s;tatutes, and freedom of the kingdom. The advi&s;ers and ex|cutors of this proclamation, were therefore expo&s;ed to a &s;evere cen&s;ure: but as their intention was good, and the effects of their proceedings &s;alutary, it would have been ju&s;tice in extreme to have taken the ad|vantage of the &s;tatutes again&s;t men who had done all
<PB N="82" REF="83">in their power to relieve the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s of the kingdom. A bill was therefore brought in to indem|nify all per&s;ons who had acted in obedience to the late act of council, concerning the embargo.</P>
<P>This bill, when it was brought in, &s;ecured the infe|rior officers again&s;t pro&s;ecution for their acting contrary to law, but left out the council who had advi&s;ed the proclamation; and it al&s;o wanted an introduction to point out the illegality of the mea&s;ure. This was the occa&s;ion of much altercation, in which &s;ome of the mini&s;try who had been formerly very popular, and admired as the friends of liberty, de&s;erted its cau&s;e, and advanced doctrines entirely contrary to the prin|ciples of the revolution. They not only vindicated the mea&s;ure concerning the embargo as a nece&s;&s;ary expedient, in a critical &s;ituation, but defended it as a matter of right; and maintained, that a di&s;pen&s;ing power in ca&s;es of &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity, was one of the prero|gatives of the crown. That which rendered this proclamation more &s;u&s;picious and unpopular, was, that a proclamation had been i&s;&s;ued before, again&s;t fore&s;talling upon the &s;ame day that the parliament was prorogued, from the &s;ixteenth of September, till the eleventh of November following. It was argued on this occa&s;ion, that provided the mini&s;try had not had &s;ome intention to introduce an arbitrary power, they would have advi&s;ed the King to have called the parliament, and laid on the embargo by an act of the legi&s;lature; for by &s;uch a long and unnece&s;&s;ary pro|rogation, all advice of parliament was precluded; that the rea&s;on given for the proclamation was, that his Maje&s;ty had not an opportunity to take the ad|vice of parliament, while yet the proclamation for the embargo was i&s;&s;ued &s;ixteen days after that for proro|guing the parliament. All this was urged, to prove
<PB N="83" REF="84">again&s;t the mini&s;try &s;ome de&s;ign of pur&s;uing arbitrary mea&s;ures. After many &s;trong arguments had been u&s;ed again&s;t the mea&s;ure concerning the embargo, it was inferred, that if the doctrine of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the laws were admitted on a plea of &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity, as con|&s;titutional, the revolution could be deemed nothing but a &s;ucce&s;sful rebellion, and a lawle&s;s and wicked inva&s;ion of the rights of the crown; the bill of rights, a fal&s;e and &s;candalous libel, and an infamous impo&s;i|tion upon both prince and people; and James the &s;econd neither abdicated nor forfeited, but was rob|bed of his crown. Con&s;i&s;tency is a thing not always to be found univer&s;ally ob&s;erved in the practice of po|liticians; they often make u&s;e of government to &s;erve their own purpo&s;es, and when they have once commit|ted an error, they endeavour to find arguments to de|fend it. There is no rea&s;on to believe that the mini|&s;try at this time had the &s;malle&s;t intention of violating the con&s;titution, and therefore the arguments brought againg&s;t their proceedings, could not have the &s;ame force that they had in the ca&s;e of James the &s;econd; who&s;e de&s;igns to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution were pal|pable and evident; but it mu&s;t be allowed that when they defended, as a right, this &s;tretch of prerogative, it was but fair to &s;hew them the incon&s;i&s;tency of their arguments and proceedings.</P>
<P>1767. The operations of the human pa&s;&s;ions, in the &s;y&s;tems of policy, are a my&s;tery not ea&s;ily unveil|ed; it often happens that when &s;imple and unde&s;ign|ing people have given their plaudit to mea&s;ures, which from the be&s;t evidence they could obtain, they thought de&s;erved approbation, that per&s;ons of refinement will pre&s;ently attempt to prove that they were ab&s;urd, ri|diculous, and incon&s;i&s;tent. The repealing of the &s;tamp act, which obtained &s;o much prai&s;e to the for|mer mini&s;try, was attacked by a &s;et of venal writers,
<PB N="84" REF="85">as a piece of the wor&s;t policy, and the mo&s;t incon|&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of Britain, of any thing that had happened for many years. Mildne&s;s in govern|ment was interpreted pu&s;illanimity and weakne&s;s; and an aver&s;ion to ho&s;tility, and blood&s;hed, was con&s;ider|ed as a want of concern or indifference, for the wel|fare of the mother country. Topics of this &s;ort now became common, which made per&s;ons of di&s;cernment conclude that the mea&s;ures adopted by tho&s;e who promoted the repeal of the &s;tamp act, were not agree|able to an invi&s;ible agent, who now intended to direct the &s;prings of government; and that another plan of operation would be adopted. The Marquis of Rock|ingham and his friends had been turned out of their offices before that the di&s;turbances in America were totally &s;ettled, and &s;ome offen&s;ive acts yet remained, to which they had as much aver&s;ion as to the &s;tamp act. But before we proceed to con&s;ider the new di&s;|turbances that aro&s;e this year, and their cau&s;es, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the premonitions that were given to this nation and the gogernment concerning their proceedings towards the coloni&s;ts; and this I &s;hall do in the words of the writers them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"The Briti&s;h empire on the continent of Ameri|ca is well known to be extremely exten&s;ive, and is, by our late conque&s;ts, and the ce&s;&s;ions that have been made to us, become entirely compact. In the variety of colonies which it comprehends, there are all kinds of &s;oils and climates; &s;o that there can be no doubt entertained, but that with a farther clearance of the country (as yet abounding with wild fore&s;ts) fertility of &s;oil and &s;alubrity of air, will become improved, and even perfected, particularly in the moderating of heat and of cold, while to improvements and po|pulation there can hardly any end be fore&s;een.</P>
<P>"Little doubt can be entertained, that this va&s;t
<PB N="85" REF="86">country will in time become the greate&s;t and mo&s;t pro&s;perous empire that perhaps the world has ever &s;een. The earth is well known to contain abundance of mines, and probably of every &s;pecies that can be &s;aid to enrich a country; &s;o likewi&s;e, in time, all products whatever may be expected from the &s;oil. Its &s;eas, banks, bays, coa&s;ts and rivers, we al&s;o know have the mo&s;t abundant fi&s;heries, &s;o that there can be no natural impediment to its becoming greatly powerful and pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>"The lea&s;t computation of white inhabitants, at pre&s;ent, is two millions of &s;ouls: and if thereto are added the Indian tribes, Negroes, and Mulattoes, per|haps the whole number of inhabitants lately mention|ed in the public papers, may not be an exaggeration, in their being e&s;timated at five millions. But in con|&s;idering the progre&s;s of population, I &s;hall con&s;ider the white inhabitants only; becau&s;e in proportion as they increa&s;e it may probably be conjectured, that tho&s;e of the other colours will dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>"The American writers all agree in acknowledg|ing, that from the encouragements which are given to early marriage, from the facility of acquiring &s;et|tlements on lands, and the temptations there are to make them, in the inexhau&s;tible &s;ources of improve|ment in tho&s;e kinds of property, that the numbers of white inhabitants become doubled in five and twenty years. Let us then con&s;ider, upon the bottom on which the colonies &s;tand at pre&s;ent, at how rapid a rate their population mu&s;t increa&s;e. In twenty-five years their numbers will probably have grown from two millions to four, in fifty years, eight, in &s;eventy-five years to &s;ixteen, and in an hundred years to thirty-two millions; which is &s;uch a &s;triking pro&s;pect of increa&s;ing population in tho&s;e regions, as &s;hould
<PB N="86" REF="87">induce us to de&s;ert the idea of being long able to &s;ubject them by our power, and make us adopt, as its &s;ub&s;titute, true policy for that purpo&s;e which, perhaps, for many ages may pre&s;erve what mere power might fail to &s;ecure for a few years.</P>
<P>"There are no &s;ubjects &s;o frequently handled as tho&s;e of government, policy, and trade, but in which there is di&s;coverable much ignorance and prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and tho&s;e often among &s;uch as &s;hould be&s;t under&s;tand them; for many judgments are continual|ly &s;een to be framed, without right information, and too many fal&s;e ones are often obtruded on govern|ment, and the world, from &s;elf-intere&s;ted motives; &s;o that di&s;hone&s;ty and ignorance appear co-operating together, to our great national injury.</P>
<P>"Some late unfortunate tran&s;actions that have pro|ved greatly irritating to our coloni&s;ts, have &s;et them, as we &s;ee, upon e&s;timating for them&s;elves; and that turn, which has perhaps been injudiciou&s;ly given to their contemplations, has &s;erved to convince them of their utility to us, which they &s;eem inclinable to rate at its very utmo&s;t e&s;timation, and accordingly there|on &s;et a value on them&s;elves: and we ought to be aware how very &s;trongly the e&s;timations of their own utility, will, on all occa&s;ions, operate on the minds of individuals, or bodies of men.</P>
<P>"The North-Americans now &s;ay and write, that they have ever been toiling for the benefit of the mo|ther country; in which, if they are not con&s;idered as children, their treatment is that of &s;laves; and there|fore, if attempted to be oppre&s;&s;ed, they mu&s;t unite in their own defence. They accordingly cry out for union; and we even &s;ee, by the public papers, that there is to be a conference, or congre&s;s of deputies for that purpo&s;e, which is fir&s;t propo&s;ed for repre|&s;entation
<PB N="87" REF="88">only; but &s;hould they not therein &s;ucceed, ought we not to be aware of what they next may proceed to con&s;ult on, and what may prove the con|&s;equences of either rooted hatred, or ra&s;h de&s;peration?</P>
<P>"I, who was never in the colonies, nor have any particular connections with them, do not take upon my&s;elf to vindicate their opinions or proceedings, or to plead partially in their behalf; but have endeavoured to regulate my thoughts by the principles of right po|licy, when I venture to cen&s;ure tho&s;e, who are pre&s;|&s;ing for a rigid exertion of authority, becau&s;e I am well convinced, that there are occa&s;ions when every kind of authority may find it prudent to yield upon critical exigencies, as every intelligent man mu&s;t know, is occa&s;ionally the ca&s;e in all countries upon earth. The highe&s;t authority has often done it with true wi&s;dom in this kingdom, as I need but in&s;tance in the year 1733, with regard to the propo&s;ed exci&s;e on wine and tobacco, and in the year 1755, with re&s;pect to the law for allowing the naturalizing of Jews; con|cerning the utility or propriety of which &s;tate mea|&s;ures, any more than of the&s;e regarding America, I deliver no opinions of my own; but I mu&s;t applaud every relaxation for the &s;ake of re&s;toring harmony, or preventing de&s;peration.</P>
<P>"From true principles of policy and commerce, I, however, venture to pronounce, that whatever re|&s;trictions tend to prevent our coloni&s;ts, either of North-America, or the We&s;t-Indies, from enriching them|&s;elves by other &s;tates, are of prejudice to the mother|country, becau&s;e all the riches which they acquire, mu&s;t, in one &s;hape or another, finally center among us, for which conviction, I de&s;ire no better authority, than tho&s;e barometers of balances the cour&s;es of ex|change;
<PB N="88" REF="89">and how immen&s;ely they are again&s;t every one of our colonies, mu&s;t by all men be known. If therefore, from whatever they are capable by any means to get, they only &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves, with be|ing kept in a &s;tate of deep debt to us, what have we to de&s;ire more, and whom can we &s;o much injure by re&s;trictions as our&s;elves?</P>
<P>"Re&s;traints on their trade mu&s;t then, in their na|ture, be impolitic; for whatever trade they carry on, if they get but a balance in their favour, which one way or other they mu&s;t do, it will turn out to our advantage; and &s;urely, of all in&s;truments for &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing trade, if otherwi&s;e, the military and marine are the la&s;t to be employed, becau&s;e their arbitrary laws and principles are quite incompatible with commerce, which can never flouri&s;h but with mildne&s;s and encou|ragement; nor ought vice admiralty-courts to be entru&s;ted with powers over commerce; &s;o likewi&s;e, in proportion to the remotene&s;s of the &s;cene of tran&s;|actions from the &s;eat of government, will ever be the degrees of the danger from tru&s;ting them therewith.</P>
<P>"So, with regard to a medium of traffic, what could we de&s;ire more, than that our colonies &s;hould content them&s;elves with a paper currency, in order to be enabled to &s;end all the bullion they could po&s;&s;i|bly acquire, in payments to us? Was not this content|ing them&s;elves with working for money, or effects, to purcha&s;e manufactures, and commoditice of us? And &s;hould not we have been contented with getting all their real wealth, and leaving them with &s;uch a &s;ub&s;titute as a paper currency?</P>
<P>"With regard to their taxes likewi&s;e, if they have not money to pay them, and al&s;o to purcha&s;e our ma|nufactures whatever is gained in one way, mu&s;t be lo&s;t to us in another; and &s;urely it need to be re|marked,
<PB N="89" REF="90"><GAP DESC="MISSING">how ruinous the lo&s;s of that trade of our &s;upply to them, mu&s;t prove to us. It &s;urely would be time enough for us to think of taxing the Americans, when they had found the means of getting more money than they wanted to pay us in the way of trade, but the de|manding it of them while they had it not, was redu|cing them to the branded Aegyptian &s;lavery, of ma|king bricks without &s;traw.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, our great object, with regard to North America, is that of vending our manufactures, which the more they are enabled to buy, &s;o much the bet|ter it mu&s;t be for us, in the employment of our peo|ple at home, and in the returns we receive: and the more we adhere to this general &s;cheme of common intere&s;t, and the le&s;s we perplex our&s;elves with par|ticular and intricate ones, the &s;afer and more advan|tageous will be the cour&s;e we &s;hall take, as well for the peace, as the pro&s;perity of both countries.</P>
<P>"But I am afraid the true fact is, in this country of &s;elf-intere&s;ted bodies and individuals, all pur&s;uing their own good to the hurt and danger of the com|munity, that we are more jealous of the trade than of the power of the North Americans, which is a &s;o|leci&s;m in policy that is founded in &s;hort-&s;ighted &s;elf|intere&s;t, to which, in the end, it will be found to prove fatal.</P>
<P>"To form a right judgment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ent State of Great Britain and America.</NOTE> concerning the &s;tate of the colonies, we &s;hould in the fir&s;t place con&s;ider the produce of their agriculture in enumerated com|modities; which, with all their other products, &s;ent to Britain are well known, both from the accounts of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, merchants, and planters; all which have been carefully examined for many years pa&s;t, and from the&s;e it appears, that the value of all
<PB N="90" REF="91">their enumerated commodities is but 767,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR><HI>per annum;</HI> even the highe&s;t computation does not bring it to 800,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> meaning in neat proceeds to the planters. Their value has indeed always been com|puted at 600,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> till within the&s;e few years pa&s;t. But every one, who is acquainted with the colonies, may &s;ee, that their enumerated commodities, are the chief part of their produce; every thing they make, indeed, is for remittances to Britain, in order to pur|cha&s;e their nece&s;&s;aries, and to pay their debts; whence we may be very certain, that their non-enu|merated commodities, &s;old in other countries, are not equal in value to the enumerated, which are &s;ent to Britain. Accordingly, the fir&s;t are computed at 700,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year at mo&s;t; and if we were to enter into the particulars, no one could make them amount to that &s;um. Thus the produce of all the colonies in North America amounts at mo&s;t to 1,500,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR><HI>per annum,</HI> above what they con&s;ume among them|&s;elves; and we &s;hall &s;ee below, that it cannot well ex|ceed 1,400,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> All that they import into Britain, both in enumerated commodities, and what they pur|cha&s;e with &s;hetro, amounts at mo&s;t, by the rates at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, but to 1,066,491 <ABBR>l.</ABBR><HI>per annum.</HI></P>

<P>"But as the entries at the Cu&s;tom hou&s;e are too well
<PB N="92" REF="93">known to exceed the real value of the exports, this income of the colonies cannot be &s;o much as the&s;e ac|counts make it, and cannot exceed 1,400,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per annum.</HI> It is indeed impo&s;&s;ible to bring &s;uch accounts to a certain preci&s;ion; but from this &s;tate of them we may be well a&s;&s;ured, that the annual income of all the North American colonies cannot exceed a million and a-half a-year, and it is probably not &s;o much.</P>
<P>"From the&s;e accounts it appears, that the annual balance of trade again&s;t North America in favour of Britian has been for the la&s;t nine years 1,180,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> but as that balance was greater in the time of war, it may be reckoned now in the time of peace about a million a year, &s;o long as they export to the value of two millions from Britain. In the la&s;t nine years this balance has amounted to ten millions, which is certain|ly more than they could pay, if we con&s;ider their in|come. This confirms the accounts of the merchants, who make the colonies &s;o much indebted to them. By the&s;e accounts, this balance has accumulated to a debt of five millions; and as many accounts have not been received, it is computed, that the whole debt due to Britain in North America, amounts at lea&s;t to five millions and a half, if not &s;ix millions.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides this, they owe a public debt of 797,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> Thus their public and private debts amount to more than &s;ix millions of money; the intere&s;t of which a|lone, at five <HI>per cent.</HI> comes to 350,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> but as many of them pay eight <HI>per cent.</HI> according to the cu&s;tom of the trade, the intere&s;t of their debts may be rec|koned half a million a year; e&s;pecially if we add the lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tain in the exchange by making remittan|ces of money, which has of late been thirty and for|ty <HI>per cent.</HI> and the ten <HI>per cent.</HI> they pay on prote&s;t|ed bills, with &s;ix <HI>per cent. per annum</HI> till they are di&s;|charged.
<PB N="93" REF="94">If we add this to the balance of trade they owe to Britain, the two amount to their whole in|come.</P>
<P>"If we deduct this intere&s;t of their debts, lo&s;s of exchange, and prote&s;ted bills, from their income a|bove mentioned, their neat income is but 900,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year; which is the whole of what all the colonies in North America have to purcha&s;e their nece&s;&s;aries from Britain. This &s;um divided among three millions of people is but &s;ix &s;hillings a head <HI>per annum.</HI>&mdash;Even if we allow their income to be a million and a half a year, it is but ten &s;hillings a head.</P>
<P>"Thus the colonies have to di&s;charge a debt of &s;ix or &s;even millions, to pay an annual balance of nigh one million; and to maintain three millions of people, out of an income of a million and a half a year at mo&s;t, which is certainly impracticable.&mdash;If their whole in|come were to be appropriated to the payment of their debts alone, and they were to take nothing either from Britain, or the We&s;t Indies, it would not di&s;charge their debts, with intere&s;t, in five years.&mdash;It is common|ly computed, that all their per&s;onal e&s;tates are not worth above &s;ix millions; that they would hardly pay their debts to Britain; and that their current ca&s;h would not pay the intere&s;t of their debts alone for half a year.&mdash;How then does it appear, "they can certainly bear more, they ought to pay more?" as we are told by the author of the late regulations concern|ing the colonies.</P>
<P>"If we allow the&s;e colonies to have ten &s;hilling a|head <HI>per annum</HI> to expend in Britain, it would not purcha&s;e a &s;ixth part of their nece&s;&s;aries; and as their neat income is but &s;ix &s;hillings a head, it will not pur|cha&s;e a tenth part of them. To &s;upply them with nece&s;&s;aries from Britain, not to mention many other
<PB N="94" REF="95">articles, would require at lea&s;t three pounds a head, as appears from many particular e&s;timates. At this rate of three pounds a head, three millions of people would &s;pend nine millions a year; but as their in|come is only a million and a half, the difference of &s;e|ven millions and a half mu&s;t be looked upon as a na|tional lo&s;s; which we not only encrea&s;e, but render irreparable, by taxes, duties, confinement of their &s;ettlements, &amp;c. all which oblige them to &s;upply them&s;elves. By the&s;e proceedings we deprive the nation of &s;uch advantages, which might be reaped from the colonies, for the &s;ake, or rather the im|practicable attempt, of rai&s;ing 100,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> to maintain Canada and Florida.</P>
<P>"This bad &s;tate of the colonies is owing to three cau&s;es; the fir&s;t and chief is, the wearing out of the lands, and great increa&s;e of the people, who con&s;ume twice or thrice as much as they u&s;ed to do, while their lands do not produce half as much, although that is the &s;ource of their whole &s;upport. They now like|wi&s;e require, for their own con&s;umption, mo&s;t of the articles imported by their trade, which they u&s;ed formerly to &s;ell, and to make money by them, parti|cularly &s;ugar. Now as the&s;e cau&s;es are daily growing more prevalent, we may &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of extending their &s;ettlements, and improving their old plantations; without which this &s;tate of the colonies is never like|ly to be remedied, but mu&s;t daily grow wor&s;e.</P>
<P>"Their expences in the war have likewi&s;e invol|ved them in great part of this debt. It appears from the certificate of the commander in chief, that he had twenty thou&s;and provincial troops under his command, be&s;ides what they had in other &s;ervices; to pay the&s;e troops, they rai&s;ed about &s;ix millions, and owe that &s;um to Britain. Hence they &s;eem to have run in debt
<PB N="95" REF="96">to Britain for all their expences in the war, and if they were to rai&s;e any more money, it could only be by the &s;ame means, or by dimini&s;hing their exports from Britain.</P>
<P>"In the&s;e circum&s;tances it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould have any money. The balance of trade they owe to Britain, would in one year drain them of all the money they have, were it five times more than it is&mdash;They have no way to get money but by a trade to the We&s;t Indies, the balance of which is again&s;t them, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to make money by it. By that trade they rather lo&s;e than gain.&mdash;Hence in all the&s;e colonies you hardly meet with any thing but pa|per for money. This paper occa&s;ions a trade and cir|culation, it is true, but as the balance of that trade is &s;o much again&s;t them, it drains them of their current ca&s;h, and leaves nothing but paper behind. Thus their trade and paper currency drain them of that mo|ney, which their agriculture brings in. And when their ca&s;h is gone, &s;o that they have none to exchange their paper, &s;o it is no longer of any value, if it be not for an internal commerce among them&s;elves; this ruins their credit in Britain, and puts them upon ma|nufactures. It is therefore more prejudicial to the nation at home, than to the colonies, to drain them entirely of money, and to leave them no medium of trade with Britain. That only obliges them to make their own nece&s;&s;aries, in&s;tead of purcha&s;ing them here; and let any one judge, which is the greate&s;t gainer by that alternative.</P>
<P>"They who imagine, that the colonies have mo|ney, &s;eem not to know what they are, or &s;hould be. It is expected, they &s;hould purcha&s;e all their manufac|tures from Britain, which alone is impo&s;&s;ible. If they were to purcha&s;e one half of them, they could never have
<PB N="96" REF="97"><GAP DESC="MISSING">any money. The raw and unwrought materials, by which they &s;hould purcha&s;e their manufactures, if they could make them, are of &s;o much le&s;s value, that the one will never pay for the other. There are no people in the world who purcha&s;e all their manufac|tures; or if they were to do it, they could never have money. The mere and unmanufactured produce of lands will never purcha&s;e manufactures. Suppo&s;e we were to make no manufactures in Britain, how &s;hould we be &s;upplied with them? It is by manufac|tures, that this nation gains its wealth; and if you would have the colonies to get money, or pay taxes, they mu&s;t do the &s;ame, and not only &s;upply them&s;elves, but vend their manufactures, in order to rai&s;e that mo|ney; which the&s;e proceedings will &s;oon drive them to. Thus the very thought of rai&s;ing money in the colonies, is contrary to the fir&s;t principles of coloni|zation, and to the intere&s;t of Britain in them. It mu&s;t infallibly make them her rivals both in trade and manufactures.</P>
<P>"But if this is the ca&s;e of the mo&s;t fruitful coun|tries, what can we expect from North America! or from the produce of the poor and mean lands there; the greate&s;t part of which will hardly yield the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life! What could any one ever expect from a little tobacco, rice, pitch and tar, or fi&s;h, the chief products of North America, or any thing el&s;e it produces, to maintain two or three millions of peo|ple and to rai&s;e money! They who could expect this, mu&s;t be totally unacquainted with the value of the&s;e commodities. If the colonies could purcha&s;e half their nece&s;&s;aries from Britain, it would be a very con|&s;iderable income, and worth four or five millions a year to Britain; but on the lands they now po&s;&s;e&s;s, if they are confined to them, they will never be able

<PB N="97" REF="99">to purcha&s;e a fourth, if a tenth part of the nece&s;&s;a|ries they want. There are but two ways for any peo|ple to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, to wit, by the produce of lands, or of labour; that is, by agriculture, or manufactures; and if they can make nothing by the fir&s;t, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily apply to the other, which is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the colonies. They now con&s;ume the chief part of what their lands produce, and have no way to get manufactures but by making them.&mdash;To the&s;e two re&s;ources many will add trade; but that can on|ly be carried on in the produce of lands, or manu|factures; without which, you lo&s;e by trade, as the colonies do; which will &s;oon oblige them to trade in their own manufactures, if they depend on that, in|&s;tead of agriculture.</P>
<P>"The plenty which many perceive in the colonies proceeds from their land, and not from wealth; they are only rich in flocks and herds, like the patriarchs of old, and not in money. If any man &s;hew a great|er &s;ign of opulence, it all proceeds from the labour of &s;laves; who are &s;o chargeable, that they rather give their owners credit than wealth, till they are no longer able to pay their debts, which is their pre&s;ent condition. Hence they who go to the colonies, and &s;ee &s;igns of opulence in them, as they imagine, on|ly deceive them&s;elves, and impo&s;e upon the whole nation, when they pretend to be mighty well acquaint|ed with them.</P>
<P>"Upon all the&s;e accounts, it mu&s;t appear to be ab&s;olutely impracticable ever to rai&s;e a revenue in the colonies in <HI>&s;terling ca&s;h,</HI> in which they were to have paid their taxes. They pay their own taxes either in &s;taple commodities, or their paper currency; and no one can expect to get money, where there is none. If they may have a little current ca&s;h, it is not pro|perly
<PB N="98" REF="100">theirs, but belongs to the merchants of Britain, to whom it is due. This is a &s;tock of the nation in trade, left there by the merchants, in order to im|prove it; and to apply that to any other purpo&s;e, is like a merchant who lives upon his capital, in&s;tead of improving it by trade: which &s;oon brings them both to an end. But if Britain thus ruins her trade, in or|der to maintain <HI>&s;tanding armies</HI> in time of peace, this mu&s;t become a very different nation from what it ever has been, or cea&s;e to be one.</P>
<P>"The advantages of the North American trade &s;eem not to be con&s;idered in a public light; their commodities are of &s;o &s;mall value, that they are very unprofitable either to make, or to trade in them, but they are on that account more profitable to the pub|lic; if they are vile and cheap, it is becau&s;e they are gro&s;s and bulky, by which they are &s;ources of navigation, and &s;upport the maritime power of the nation. If you calculate the freight, commi&s;&s;ion, and charges, on the products of North America, they a|mount to half their value; which is all gain to Bri|tain, but is &s;o much deducted from the income of the colonies. From a particular account of the whole trade of North America, too long to be here in&s;ert|ed, it appears, that the gro&s;s proceeds, including freight and all charges, amount in value, to Britain, to three millions a year, when the net proceeds to the planters do not exceed a million and a half: and as the&s;e charges are all paid by the planters, out of the fir&s;t produce of their commodities, this nation certainly does not enjoy any trade &s;o profitable as this &mdash;"If we examine into the circum&s;tances of the in|habitants of our plantations, and our own," &s;ays a very good judge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gee on Trade, p. 149.</NOTE>, "it will appear, that not one
<PB N="99" REF="101">fourth part of their product redounds to their own profit."</P>
<P>"Thus the colonies, which produce &s;taple com|modities for Britain, are a much greater advantage to the nation than &s;eems to be apprehended. They pay, one with another, one half of all that they make, for tran&s;porting and vending the re&s;t, which is all ex|pended in Britain. By that means you get their all, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any more. Neither can it be expected, that any people can ever be worth mo|ney in their &s;ituation. Were they to have the pro|fits only of tran&s;porting and vending their own pro|ducts, their income would be double of what it is; but as the&s;e are now all reaped by Britain, it is to rob the nation of its be&s;t income, to deprive it of this. This is the advantage of the colonies, and the tax which they pay for their protection; which mu&s;t appear a very con&s;iderable one, as it amounts to one half of all they make; and is much more advantage|ous to the nation than a petty revenue, which they cannot po&s;&s;ibly have money to pay, as that all centers in Britain.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides this deduction on their products, and the heavy duties upon them, the colonies pay all the taxes of Britain on every thing they con&s;ume; as it is well known, all taxes fall on the con&s;umers, who|ever may fir&s;t pay them. Now, as the&s;e taxes on Briti&s;h goods amount at lea&s;t to fifty or &s;ixty <HI>per cent.</HI> and the colonies pay &s;uch a great part of what they purcha&s;e them with, is not this much more advanta|geous to the nation than a petty revenue? Were they to pay 100,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in taxes, they mu&s;t &s;upply them|&s;elves with manufactures to that value; this would e|&s;tabli&s;h manufactures among them; the public would lo&s;e the taxes and duties on the&s;e goods; the mer|chants their profits, and the nation the benefit of the
<PB N="100" REF="102">trade and navigation: which lo&s;&s;es would amount to twice or thrice as much as the tax. And this lo&s;s would fall much heavier on the landed intere&s;t than the mercantile; the profits of the merchants in the trade to North America are but &s;mall: they are rec|koned not to exceed ten <HI>per cent.</HI> but allowing them to be twenty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> the other &s;eventy-five is expended on the manufactures of the kingdom, and chiefly &s;uch as are made of Briti&s;h materials, which are all gain to the land-owners. Let not the landed gentlemen therefore, expect to relieve the burdens on their e&s;tates, by taxes on the colonies; that is a certain way to entail their taxes on them and their po&s;|terity for ever, and render them unable to bear the burden. They mu&s;t then pay their taxes them&s;elves, in&s;tead of having them paid by the colonies, who con&s;ume the produce of their lands, and employ their trade&s;men who are maintained on the land."</P>

<P>AS in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, many arguments will ari&s;e, concerning the rights of the coloni&s;ts, and the principles of the Engli&s;h government, with re|gard to them; it may be nece&s;&s;ary, after we have hinted a few rea&s;ons of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, to give &s;ome account of the origin of the&s;e colonies, with which we are now contending. Whether all the accounts of the ancients concerning the peopling of America are a|pocryphical or true, I will not pretend to affirm or deny. At &s;o great a di&s;tance from the original of a people, &s;o far &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world, many things that have been written are unknown, many things are uncertain, and very few that can be fully depended upon as matters of fact. From &s;ome circum&s;tances acknowledged by creditable wri|ters, it is highly probable that there were parts of America inhabited by Britons, three hundred years before the Spaniards knew any thing of the&s;e we&s;tern parts. Modern writers, by adopting a new theory of hi&s;tory, have, by one da&s;h of the pen, &s;truck out all the very ancient accounts of nations, and their man|ners as fabulous; and at once freed them&s;elves both of the truth and fal&s;ehood of ancient records. The
<PB N="201" REF="104">authority of <HI>Diodorus Siculus, Plato,</HI> and others, are now con&s;idered as mere dreams, and the more mo|dern accounts of Spani&s;h and Portugu&s;e Papi&s;ts re|ceived as the data and fir&s;t principles of American hi&s;tory. Columbus is in general allowed to be the fir&s;t di&s;coverer of America in the&s;e latter times, though De la Vaga informs us, that one <HI>Sanchez,</HI> a native of <HI>Helva,</HI> in Spain, di&s;covered the&s;e regions be|fore him. It was in the year 1492 that Columbus entered upon his enterprize, and di&s;covered the nor|thern parts of America; and in 1497 that Americus Ve&s;putius di&s;covered the &s;outhern parts. In this &s;ame year, the two <HI>Cabots,</HI> the father and &s;on, under the commi&s;&s;ion of King Henry the &s;eventh, made further di&s;coveries than either Columbus or Americus, for which they were highly honoured by the king of England. What gives the preference to the two Eng|li&s;h men, above the Genoe&s;e and the Florintine is, that the Britons di&s;covered the continent, when the others only di&s;covered &s;ome i&s;lands, and did not di&s;|cover the main land till an year after it had been di&s;|covered by the Cabots. <HI>Americus</HI> came after them both, and gave a name to the whole we&s;tern world, to which, as a di&s;coverer, he was no ways entitled. It was in con&s;equence of the di&s;coveries which the <HI>Ca|bots</HI> made, that after adventurers in England, made their acquaintance with the we&s;tern parts of the globe. Mo&s;t of the attempts to &s;ettle colonies in America were un&s;ucce&s;sful at fir&s;t, which happened either through the ignorance of the adventurers, or the treachery of &s;ome particular per&s;ons among them; who, for &s;elfi&s;h and intere&s;ted purpo&s;es, betrayed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. Sir Walter Raliegh, Willoughby, Frobi&s;her, Gilbert, and Go&s;nold, made &s;everal bold and un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts before they &s;ucceeded, and
<PB N="103" REF="105">their utmo&s;t efforts proceeded little farther than to di&s;cover the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ettling colonies in tho&s;e parts of the world. The greate&s;t part of the we&s;tern continent, towards the north, was called at fir&s;t Vir|ginia, either becau&s;e the fir&s;t white per&s;on that was born there was a female, or in honour of the Queen of England, under who&s;e &s;anction they had made the di&s;covery. This country was at fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of North and South Virginia, till Captain Smith, in the year 1614, by pre&s;enting a map of North Virginia had its name changed to that of New-England.</P>
<P>The violence of the Laudean party in England in a great mea&s;ure promoted the population of America: and without any de&s;ign of advancing the intere&s;ts of adventurers, gave exi&s;tence to &s;chemes that planted an Engli&s;h race of people in the wilds of the we&s;t. In the year 1620, &s;ome per&s;ons, who at that time were called Puritans, to avoid the violence of reli|gious per&s;ecution fled to Holland, and &s;ettled at Ley|den, where they were allowed the free exerci&s;e of their religion. After they had continued there for &s;ome years, they began to find a lukewarmne&s;s of temper, and callou&s;ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition gradually en|crea&s;e upon them, and were afraid, that by con&s;tant intercour&s;e with the lukewarm Dutchmen, their po|&s;terity would in proce&s;s of time lo&s;e all that zeal which they thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport that form of reli|gion they approved of. Their children had married into Dutch families, and their congregation began to decline: they therefore projected the &s;cheme of emi|gration to America, chiefly with a de&s;ign to plant a church according to that form which they had now &s;et up in Holland. This congregation of Chri&s;tians were called Independents, becau&s;e they maintained
<PB N="104" REF="106">that congregational churches are independent on all Epi&s;copal or Pre&s;byterian juri&s;diction, and held that profe&s;&s;ed believers of the Go&s;pel, uniting in the faith and wor&s;hip of the New Te&s;tament, have a ju&s;t right to exerci&s;e all religious di&s;cipline within their congre|gation, without being accountable to any foreign ju|ri&s;diction. After much deliberation, it was re&s;olved that the younger part &s;hould go and &s;ettle in America, under the protection of the King of England, where they might enjoy the liberty of their con&s;ciences, and be capable of encouraging their friends and country|men to follow them.</P>
<P>They &s;ent their agents into England, and ob|tained a patent from the crown, and agreed with &s;everal merchants to become adventurers in the undertaking. Several members of the church, over whom the famous Mr Robin&s;on was pa&s;tor, &s;old their e&s;tates, and made a common bank, with which they purcha&s;ed a &s;mall &s;hip of &s;ixty tons, and hired another of one hundred and eighty. The agents &s;ail|ed into Holland with their own &s;hip, to take in as many of the congregation as were willing to embark, while the other ve&s;&s;el was freighting with all nece&s;|&s;aries for the new plantation. All things being ready, Mr Robin&s;on kept a day of fa&s;ting and prayer with his congregation, and took his leave of the adven|turers with the following exhortation:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Brethren, we are now quickly to part from one another, and whether I may ever live to &s;ee your faces on earth any more, the God of heaven only knows; but whether the Lord has appointed that or no, I charge you before God, and his ble&s;&s;ed angels, that ye follow me no farther than you have &endq;&s;een me follow the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;If God reveal any thing to you, by any other in|&s;trument
<PB N="105" REF="107">of his, be as ready to receive it as ever you were to receive any truth by my mini&s;try; for I am verily per&s;uaded, the Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of his holy word. For my part, I cannot &s;ufficiently bewail the condition of the reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion, and will go at pre&s;ent no farther than the in&s;truments of their reformation. The Lu|therans cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther &s;aw; whatever part of his will our God has revealed to Calvin, they will rather die than embrace it; and the Calvini&s;ts, you &s;ee, &s;tick fa&s;t where they were left by that great man of God, &endq;who yet &s;aw not all things.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;This is a mi&s;ery much to be lamented; for though they were burning and &s;hining lights in their times, yet they penetrated not into the whole council of God, but were they now living, would be as wil|ling to embrace further light as that which they fir&s;t received. I be&s;eech you, remember 'tis an article of our church covenants, that you be ready to re|ceive whatever truth &s;hall be made known to you from the written word of God. Remember that, and every other article of your &s;acred covenant. But I mu&s;t here withal exhort you, to take heed what you receive as truth, examine it, con&s;ider it, and compare it with other &s;criptures of truth, before you receive it; for it is not po&s;&s;ible that the chri&s;ti|an world &s;hould come &s;o lately out of &s;uch thick an|tichri&s;tian darkne&s;s, and that perfection of know|ledge &endq;&s;hould break forth at once.</Q></P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of July, the adventurers went from Leyden to Delfthaven, whither Mr Robin&s;on and the ancients of his congregation accompanied them; they
<PB N="106" REF="108">continued together all night, and next morning, after mutual embraces, Mr Robin&s;on kneeled down on the &s;ea-&s;hore, and with a fervent prayer, committed them to the protection and ble&s;&s;ing of heaven. The ad|venturers were about one hundred and twenty, who having joined their other &s;hip, &s;ailed for New-Eng|land on the fifth of Augu&s;t; but one of their ve&s;&s;els, which arrived at Cape Cod on the ninth of No|vember, one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and twenty. Sad was the condition of the&s;e poor men, who had winter before them, and no accommodations on land for their entertainment: mo&s;t of them were in a weak and &s;ickly condition with the voyage, but there was no remedy: they therefore manned their long-boat, and having coa&s;ted the &s;hore, at length found a to|lerable harbour, where they landed their effects, and on the twenty-fifth of December, began to build a &s;tore-hou&s;e, and &s;ome &s;mall cottages to pre&s;erve them from the weather. Their company was divided into nineteen families, each family having an allotment of land for lodging and gardens, in proportion to the number of per&s;ons of which it con&s;i&s;ted; and to pre|vent di&s;putes, the &s;ituation of each family was decided by lot. They agreed likewi&s;e upon &s;ome laws for their civil and military government, and having cho|&s;en a governor, they called the place of their &s;ettle|ment by the name of <HI>New Plymouth.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e new planters underwent great hard&s;hips when they fir&s;t went over, and many of them died through the fatigues of their voyage, and a di&s;temper which raged among them. Their friends in England &s;ent them &s;upplies, and notwith&s;tanding all difficulties they maintained their &s;tation, and laid the foundation of one of the noble&s;t &s;ettlements in America; which
<PB N="107" REF="109">has proved an a&s;ylum to many Non-conformi&s;ts &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;pring after the&s;e new &s;ettlers had wea|thered out a &s;evere winter, when they began to look after what things were nece&s;&s;ary for their further &s;u&s;|tenance, they were &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed with the ap|pearance of two Indians, who, in broken Engli&s;h, bad them welcome. One of the&s;e Indians had been acquainted with &s;ome of the Engli&s;h who had been fi&s;h|ing on the ea&s;tern parts of New-England, and the o|ther had been &s;educed by a &s;hipma&s;ter aboard his ve&s;|&s;el, and carried to Europe, with &s;ome others, and there &s;old a &s;lave, but had made his e&s;cape to Eng|land, out of Spain, and become &s;ervant to one Mr Slany, from whom he had found a way to return to his own country. This Indian's name was Squanto, He performed many good offices to this infant colo|ny, and in&s;tructed them how to plant Indian corn, and made them acquainted with one of the principal Sachems in the country, who came with &s;ome of his people from a great di&s;tance to pay them a vi&s;it, enter|ed into a league with them, and became &s;ubjects of England. Hi&s;torians inform us of a &s;trange device that this Squanto ob&s;erved, to bring the Sachems and Indians into friend&s;hip with the coloni&s;ts, and un|der the government of the Engli&s;h. He per&s;uaded them that the King of England kept the plague lock|ed up in a cellar, and could let it out when he plea|&s;ed, to de&s;troy them all. This had a great effect up|on the apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e ignorant &s;avages, who had &s;een the greate&s;t part of their neighbours a few years before &s;wept away by a mo&s;t terrible plague. This friendly &s;tratagem of Squanto was a happy mean of pre&s;erving this infant colony, and was by the pi|ous and religious people of tho&s;e times, con&s;idered
<PB N="108" REF="110">as a &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of providence in their fa|vour.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of many trials, dangers, and di&s;ap|pointments, tho&s;e coloni&s;ts continued to &s;upport them|&s;elves, and maintain their religion, as their circum&s;tan|ces would permit, till a company of gentlemen in Eng|land gave them further relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>From the time that the fir&s;t adventurers went over to America, the lo&s;&s;es that tho&s;e at home had &s;u&s;tain|ed in their &s;ub&s;tance in &s;upporting them, made them turn &s;ick of tho&s;e adventurers. But there were other noblemen and gentlemen who were ready to engage in this cau&s;e, and obtained a new grant, 1620, of all the country between the latitudes 40 and 48, and had a patent made out to them, under the title of "the Council e&s;tabli&s;hed at Plymouth, in the county of De|von, for the planting, ruling, ordering, and govern|ing of New-England in America, their heirs and a&s;|&s;igns." This afterwards received the name of the grand Plymouth Patent.</P>
<P>Mr White, a clergyman of Dorche&s;ter, having pro|jected a &s;cheme of a new &s;ettlement of, and a&s;ylum for ejected mini&s;ters, entered into a treaty with the&s;e new patentees. In con&s;equence of this, the council of Plymouth, by a deed under their common &s;eal, gave, granted, bargained, and &s;old to Henry Bo&s;well, and five others, gentlemen of Dor&s;et&s;hire, their heirs and a&s;&s;igns, and their a&s;&s;ociates for ever, all that part of New-England therein de&s;cribed, at the bottom of a certain bay there, commonly called Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay. In this deed, there was granted, all rights, ju|ri&s;dictions, royalties, liberties, freedoms, immunities, privileges, franchi&s;es, pre-eminences, and commodities what&s;oever, which they them&s;elves had or might ex|erci&s;e, or enjoy within the &s;aid lands. Some years
<PB N="109" REF="111">after, this company was joined with &s;everal gentle|men in London, the principal of whom was Sir Rich|ard Salton&s;tall, and a new draught of the former pa|tent was made out, and the names of the new adven|turers in&s;erted in it. It was confirmed by the King, and pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eals March 4th 1628. By the royal charter, this company was created a corporation, and had governors and a&s;&s;i&s;tants appointed, and were impowered to chu&s;e annually their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors upon the fir&s;t day of Ea&s;ter term. They accordingly met, and for the fir&s;t time, on the 13th of May 1628, cho&s;e a governor, deputy-governor, and eighteen a&s;&s;i&s;tants. At this time the court agreed that every one of the company who &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;hould have 200 acres of land for their dividend, and in propor|tion for a greater &s;um. A li&s;t of the names of &s;ub&s;cri|bers, and the &s;ums &s;ub&s;cribed, was tran&s;mitted to Mr Endicot, whom they had ju&s;t a little before &s;ent over as governor in the plantation. This was the fir&s;t roy|al charter, and the original of &s;ettling the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts bay. This company was formed upon a plan &s;i|milar to that of the Ea&s;t-India company. The gen|tlemen who formed this company were re&s;ident in England, and cho&s;e their governor, deputy-governor, and a&s;&s;i&s;tants out of their own body, re&s;ident among them&s;elves, and then &s;ent out a per&s;on under their au|thority, as governor, to di&s;po&s;e of the new &s;ettle|ment. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was Mr Endicot, whom they &s;ent away as &s;oon as the charter was executed, to take care of the colony, and to prevent the new &s;ettlers from returning home, who were in great di&s;tre&s;s, and intended to have returned to England.</P>
<P>Among the &s;everal debates concerning the nature of charters, it has never been yet fairly determined, whether &s;uch royal patents, granted for ever, to cor|porate
<PB N="110" REF="112">bodies, fulfilling the conditions of their char|ters, can be di&s;&s;olved at the plea&s;ure of the legi&s;lature. The only difficulty concerning this charter is, whe|ther, after the company removed from Old-England to New-England, the acts and proceedings of that company had the &s;ame force as before? Rea&s;on and ju&s;tice will readily determine this point in the affirmative; but what it may be as a point of law, I will not affirm. If the &s;overeign has a right to grant charters, accor|ding to the laws of the empire, one charter mu&s;t be as good as another; and if an act of parliament be nece&s;&s;ary to make them legal and certain, then all the charters of incorporated bodies mu&s;t have that &s;anction, otherwi&s;e they are not good tenures for any privileges. It would appear that the above-mention|ed charter was a charter to hold lands within certain latitudes, and to authori&s;e the&s;e &s;ettlers to chu&s;e a governor and a&s;&s;i&s;tants. From whence it is natural to infer, that it gave them authority within tho&s;e di&s;|tricts, when the inhabitants &s;hould encrea&s;e, to en|crea&s;e the number of a&s;&s;i&s;tants; or at lea&s;t to grant to all who &s;hould incorporate with them, according to the intention of the grant, the &s;ame privileges, ac|cording to their charters, as members of the corpora|tion. The&s;e adventurers did not intend to &s;et up any independent government, but meant to continue mem|bers of the Briti&s;h empire; but they certainly believ|ed that their removing from one place of the empire to another, did not deprive them of that privilege which other &s;ubjects of the &s;overeign enjoyed. When they purcha&s;ed lands under the &s;anction of their char|ter, they did not imagine that they were not their own; but might be taken from them at the plea&s;ure of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature without their con&s;ent. They cer|tainly under&s;tood that their e&s;tates were freeholds,
<PB N="111" REF="113">held upon condition of their fulfilling the allegiance to the &s;overeign implied in their charter, and that no power in Britain could take them from them, with|out manife&s;t inju&s;tice, and breach of faith. As to the difference between Old and New-England freeholds, lawyers and ca&s;ui&s;ts may have much to &s;ay; but by tracing matters to their original, it will be found that the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e e&s;tates called freeholds, and the tenures of corporations, are only founded upon the grants of princes, and the charters of &s;overeigns. When royal charters are granted, which are under|&s;tood to give a title to certain privileges of freedom; it is al&s;o under&s;tood that this freedom is the &s;ame in all parts of the &s;ame empire; and that though there is no new government granted, yet all the new privi|leged &s;ubjects have as good a right as the old ones, to enjoy the &s;ame freedom. The coloni&s;ts, by going to America, were not freed from the juri&s;diction of the Briti&s;h parliament, nor did they pretend to any &s;uch liberty; but they imagined that when they were made free by charter, that a foundation was laid, for their having &s;ome &s;hare in the legi&s;lature. All acts of parliament are certainly binding upon every part of the empire; but this ari&s;es from either an expre&s;&s;ed or implied repre&s;entation of the &s;ubjects in parliament: and though the king cannot give a charter to aboli&s;h acts of parliament, he may, notwith&s;tanding, accor|ding to the laws, give a new qualification to &s;ubjects, to make them a part of the &s;ame legi&s;lature. The coloni&s;ts who were freemen of the empire were bound by the laws thereof; but in &s;o far as they were free|men, they were al&s;o entitled to a &s;hare in the legi&s;la|ture; to refu&s;e them the latter, would be loo&s;ing them from all obligation to the former, or &s;ubjecting them
<PB N="112" REF="114">to an arbitrary power, again&s;t which they had no re|medy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t coloni&s;ts &s;eem to have had but very indif|ferent ideas of civil and religious liberty; for the co|lony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay confined their civil liberty to their church-members, and permitted none to a &s;hare in their government, who were not joined mem|bers in their congregations. And with regard to re|ligious freedom, they were exceedingly narrow minded, and in&s;tead of tolerating people of different &s;entiments, they per&s;ecuted the innocent Quakers with unrelenting rigour. They were, no doubt, much fretted and chagrined in their tempers, with the u&s;age they had met with in their own country; and had imbibed the temper of the times, which was very far from being mild. It does not appear that their pro|fe&s;&s;ed principles taught them the practices they found|ed upon them, but their behaviour was rather a per|ver&s;ion of their principles. They, through long op|pre&s;&s;ion, had acquired a &s;ourne&s;s of temper, and a &s;olemnity of manners, of which their religion and whole behaviour was &s;ea&s;oned; &s;o that their religion was more under the government of their manners, than became the purity of their profe&s;&s;ion. The peo|ple were much to be blamed, though their religion de&s;erves commendation. It was a boi&s;terous age in which they lived, and it could not well be expected that men who had &s;uffered &s;o many hard&s;hips and &s;e|verities would be exceeding mild in their tempers.</P>
<P>The people who at this time emigrated to America, were generally of two &s;orts: &s;uch as fled from per&s;e|cution, on account of their religion; and &s;uch as were influenced by the love of worldly advantage: The&s;e, as their motives were different, frequently pur&s;ued different mea&s;ures to obtain their ends. But every
<PB N="113" REF="115">reader of their hi&s;tory mu&s;t confe&s;s that an unanimi|ty was maintained beyond what could have been ex|pected, in &s;uch &s;ingular circum&s;tances. The force of religion was &s;uch a bond of union in the minds of the majority, that amid&s;t all the various jarrings and con|tentions which happened among them, they never proceeded &s;o far as to come to any con&s;iderable rup|ture. They bore one another's infirmities, and over|looked many faults, which in ordinary ca&s;es they would not have done; their mutual hard&s;hips cemented them together, and made them &s;hew compa&s;&s;ion to each other, as &s;trangers in a foreign land.</P>
<P>After the government, together with their fir&s;t charter, was removed from England to the colony, they began to encrea&s;e exceedingly fa&s;t; per&s;ons of rank and fortune not only patronized them, but bore them company into the wilderne&s;s of America. The Lady Arabella John&s;ton, and &s;everal others of rank and condition, for&s;ook their own native homes, and cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, where they might enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their religion. Their governor, John Wintrop, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and their deputy-governor, Thomas Dudley, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> were men of character and abilities, who did not leave England for the &s;ake of gain, but to maintain a good con&s;cience: they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the enjoyments in their native country that mo&s;t people are fond of, but they wanted liberty of con&s;cience, which is one of the greate&s;t enjoyments. They there|fore committed their lives and their fortunes to the mercy of winds and &s;eas, for the hope of enjoying liberty in a country they never &s;aw, and where they could promi&s;e them&s;elves nothing but hard&s;hips and difficulties. A fleet of eleven &s;hips, of which the Ara|bella was the admiral's &s;hip, a ve&s;&s;el of three hundred and fifty tons, landed &s;afe in New-England in the mid|dle
<PB N="114" REF="116">of July 1630. Two thou&s;and pa&s;&s;engers came over in this fleet, carrying with them as much of their fortunes as they could command, with all things they thought nece&s;&s;ary for the climate in which they de|&s;igned to &s;ettle.</P>
<P>Soon after their arrival, Lady Arabella died of a di&s;temper which &s;he had contracted in the voy|age, to the great grief of her friends, and of the co|loni&s;ts; and many of the company were likewi&s;e car|ried off by di&s;ea&s;es common to the climate. There were two things which at this time alarmed them greatly; &s;carcity of provi&s;ions and fear of the Indi|ans: &s;corching droughts had in a great mea&s;ure con|&s;umed the fruits of the ground; &s;o that the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life became exceedingly &s;carce, and the whole colony were in danger of peri&s;hing. From this fear they were happily delivered, by the arrival of &s;eve|ral &s;hips from Ireland, laden with various &s;orts of pro|vi&s;ions, which &s;upplied their nece&s;&s;ity for the pre&s;ent, till more &s;upplies could be provided. The &s;ame pro|vidence that delivered them from the dread of famine, removed al&s;o their other ground of fear. A mo&s;t dreadful plague, together, with the &s;mall pox, had &s;wept away nine out of ten of the natives, &s;o that the few that remained, fled from the infection, to more di&s;tant places of the country. The&s;e new &s;ettlers after their arrival, did not con&s;ider the patent of the King to be a &s;ufficient title to give them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lands of the original natives; they therefore, before they pretended to po&s;&s;e&s;s any tracts of ground, made a lawful purcha&s;e thereof from the true proprietors, and paid them a price for what they afterwards po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. To rea&s;on, it is an high ab&s;urdity, for a king of Bri|tain, or any other &s;overeign, to pretend to give char|ters of right to other people's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; becau&s;e
<PB N="115" REF="117">&s;ome of their &s;ubjects, when &s;campering round the globe, &s;hould chance to &s;ee their country as they are pa&s;&s;ing along. With as much ju&s;tice might &s;ome o|ther nations grant charters to their &s;ubjects, of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in England and France, becau&s;e &s;ome adventur|ers of their nations happened to &s;ail along their coa&s;ts, as the people in England and France grant charters to their &s;ubjects in America. It was a fair acknowledgment of tho&s;e &s;ettlers, that they did not believe their charters gave them a lawful title, when they purcha&s;ed their lands from the natives of the country; and it is certainly no more than an act of ju&s;tice, which all nations &s;hould ob&s;erve towards tho&s;e that are giving them no trouble, to purcha&s;e what they mean to po&s;&s;e&s;s in their country. If, after they have made their purcha&s;e, they intend to hold of their na|tive country as &s;ubjects for protection, they ought undoubtedly to pay the ordinary re&s;pects due to its government, and enjoy the common rights of others of the community. A charter can never lawfully proceed any farther than a promi&s;e of protection of tho&s;e lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which the &s;ubjects of a govern|ment have acquired: for no government can give a right to a &s;oil which does not belong thereto. It is plain from this ob&s;ervation, that this Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony did not derive their right of manor&s;hip from any &s;overeign, but from purcha&s;e; for at no time can it be &s;aid, that ever the lands of the Indians be|longed to either king or parliament of any nation in Europe. Their charter affirms that they were to hold their title to the &s;oil in common, and free &s;oc|cage, as of the manor of Ea&s;t-Greenwich in Kent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MASSACHUSETS COLONY CHARTER.

</LETTER></NOTE>,
<PB N="116" REF="118">but how a title could be given to a &s;oil by tho&s;e to whom it did not belong, appears rather whim&s;ical and ab&s;urd. It may be an amu&s;ement for lawyers to trifle with, but ju&s;tice and equity will remove all &s;uch ideas. One would think the coloni&s;ts, though they were flying from oppre&s;&s;ion, had at this time very mean ideas of ju&s;tice and liberty, to &s;olicit a pa|tent to carry in their pockets, to a foreign country, to claim a right to other people's lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. It would appear they &s;aw the incon&s;i&s;tency, and claim|ed
<PB N="117" REF="119">no right till they had fir&s;t made a bargain, and paid the purcha&s;e. Tho&s;e who at pre&s;ent debate con|cerning the&s;e old parchments on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion, will never be able to draw an honourable conclu&s;ion from them, worthy of the true friends of li|berty. In the hi&s;tory of human nature, it is difficult to find con&s;i&s;tency, when men's intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions become coun&s;ellors for their actions.</P>
<P>The charms of a charter under the great &s;eal of England wrought powerfully upon per&s;ons of &s;everal
<PB N="118" REF="120">degrees; the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, the religious, and the avari|cious, from different motives, flocked to New-Eng|land. Per&s;ons de&s;cended of ancient families, mini|&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, merchants, hu&s;bandmen, artifi|cers, during the &s;pace of twelve years, went over in large bodies to &s;ettle in America. The expence of tho&s;e emigrations was truly extraordinary; it was com|puted that the pa&s;&s;age of the emigrants co&s;t at lea&s;t ninety thou&s;and pounds; the tran&s;portation of the fir&s;t &s;mall cattle, be&s;ides their price, co&s;t twelve thou|&s;and
<PB N="119" REF="121">pounds: the provi&s;ions laid in, till more could be provided, co&s;t forty-five thou&s;and pounds: the materials for building their fir&s;t cottages, co&s;t eigh|teen thou&s;and pounds: their arms and ammunition, including their artillery, twenty-two thou&s;and pounds. Be&s;ides the&s;e va&s;t &s;ums, the adventurers laid out many other con&s;iderable ones; and no fewer than an hun|dred and ninety-eight &s;hips were employed in carry|ing men, women, children, cattle, and other com|modities to this new &s;ettlement. It mu&s;t have been
<PB N="120" REF="122">an amazing impul&s;e that wrought &s;o powerfully upon &s;uch numbers of people, to make them for&s;ake their native country, to go to re&s;ide in the mid&s;t of a wil|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>What declared the principal de&s;ign of tho&s;e emi|grants, was their practice; for they had no &s;ooner arrived in New-England, than they began to pur&s;ue that reformation in religion, which they had projected before they left their native country. On Augu&s;t the 27th 1630, they kept a &s;olemn fa&s;t, and cho&s;e a mi|ni&s;ter
<PB N="121" REF="123">to pre&s;ide in their public wor&s;hip. One Mr Wil&s;on, formerly a mini&s;ter of Sudbury, in the coun|ty of Suffolk, was appointed their pa&s;tor. This new church was formed at Charle&s;town, on the north &s;ide of Charles river, not far from Bo&s;ton, which at that time did not exi&s;t. In a very &s;hort time there were &s;even churches formed in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, all ob&s;erving the &s;ame order, wor&s;hip, and di&s;cipline<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charle&s;town, Dorche&s;ter, Bo&s;ton, Roxbury, Lyn, Watertoun, Plymouth.</NOTE>, which the writers of the New-England hi&s;tory compare to the
<PB N="122" REF="124">&s;even churches in A&s;ia, which in &s;ome things they endeavoured to imitate.</P>
<P>The colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay &s;oon became numer|ous, and it was re&s;olved to plant other colonies in that country, as near one another as was po&s;&s;ible to &s;ettle them. For this purpo&s;e, in the year 1635, Mr Tho|mas Hooker, and a company that joined with him, &s;ent agents from Cambridge to Connecticut, who pur|cha&s;ed lands of the natives, where they &s;ettled, formed another colony. Tho&s;e new coloni&s;ts
<PB N="123" REF="125">finding them&s;elves without the bounds of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts charter, formed a government of their own, in imitation of that which they had &s;een ob&s;er|ved in the colony they had left. They afterwards re|ceived an ample charter from the King of England, and became a flouri&s;hing colony. But what extend|ed this colony more, and made it more con&s;iderable was, Me&s;&s;rs Davenport and Eaton, two of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, de&s;ired their friends that were now gone to Connecticut, to purcha&s;e for them,
<PB N="124" REF="126">of the native proprietors, all the lands that lay between them and Hud&s;on's river. This was accordingly done, and the purcha&s;ers in the year 1637 removed thither, and planted a beautiful colony, in a plea&s;ant bay along the &s;ea coa&s;t, where they built the towns of New-Haven, Guildford, Milford, Stampford, and Brain|tree. Soon after the colony of Long I&s;land was &s;et|tled, and I&s;land of 18 miles in breadth, and 120 miles in length. This is a very plea&s;ant I&s;land, &s;tretching it|&s;elf along Fairfield county, in New-England, near the
<PB N="125" REF="127">mouth of Hud&s;on's river, and is well furni&s;hed every where with convenient harbours. The fourth colony was called New-Haven, which being Londoners, in|tended to pur&s;ue trade, but failed in their enterpri&s;e; their fortunes &s;unk &s;o fa&s;t, that they lo&s;t all hope, and many of them in returning to England, peri&s;hed at &s;ea, and never more &s;aw their native country. As many, however, &s;till remained as &s;upported the colony, which afterwards became con&s;iderable, and was joined in one charter with Connecticut, in the reign of Charles the &s;econd, 1664; it
<PB N="126" REF="128">is the capital of a county of the &s;ame name, and was in a very flouri&s;hing condition before the pre&s;ent war. In all the&s;e colonies, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers were careful to form independent churches; which, though they did con&s;ider them&s;elves as accountable to each other for their conduct, yet lived in full fellow&s;hip and commu|nion, walking in love with one another, and in the fear of God. Their &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everities to tho&s;e that offended or differed from them, in more enlightened times, may have the appearance of a real want of cha|rity;
<PB N="127" REF="129">but &s;uch were the manners of tho&s;e times, that there was little forbearance among profe&s;&s;ors of any denomination. Whatever may have been their vari|ous defects and imperfections, they had, notwith&s;tand|ing, a &s;en&s;e of religion upon their minds, which &s;hews at lea&s;t they were in earne&s;t in what they profe&s;&s;ed. Their follies, weakne&s;&s;es, and extravagances, when compared with their virtues, bear le&s;s proportion, than perhaps may be found in the ca&s;e of their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors either in the mother country or in the colonies.</P>
<PB N="128" REF="130">
<P>Ju&s;t &s;entiments of civil and religious liberty have always been friendly to learning, and though there might be &s;everal blemi&s;hes in the conduct of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in America; yet it mu&s;t be granted even by their enemies, that they were friends both to liberty and learning. The coloni&s;ts had &s;carcely been one year in New-England after they received their char|ter, when they began to contemplate a &s;cheme for erecting a college or univer&s;ity among them, where youth might be in&s;tructed in the liberal arts, and per|&s;ons
<PB N="129" REF="131">fitted for all public offices, both for the magi&s;tracy and mini&s;try. Accordingly at a general court, held at Bo&s;ton September 8th 1630, a &s;ub&s;cription was opened for building a college, at New Town, the name of which they changed to Cambridge. The &s;ub&s;criptions were at fir&s;t but &s;mall, but &s;uch was the zeal and emulation of tho&s;e coloni&s;ts, that in a &s;hort time the money rai&s;|ed was con&s;iderable. Mr John Harvard, mini&s;ter at Charle&s;town, by his la&s;t will, bequeathed 779<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 17<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 2<ABBR>d.</ABBR> for the purpo&s;e of building a college, which was pre|&s;ently
<PB N="130" REF="132">begun, and a committee appointed to promote this noble de&s;ign. This academy received the name of Harvard college from one of its fir&s;t and principal benefactors. While this college was building, a num|ber of &s;cholars were preparing under one Na|thaniel Eaton, an excellent &s;cholar, but a man of bad morals, and a great tyrant. Cotton Mather, in his Hi&s;tory of New-England, ob&s;erves of him, that it might be truly &s;aid, that &s;uch as were educated under him, received their education in the &s;chool of Tyrannus.</P>
<PB N="131" REF="133">
<P>On Augu&s;t 27th 1640, the magi&s;trates and mini&s;ters of the colony cho&s;e Mr Henry Dun&s;tar, pre&s;ident of this new college; and afterwards the general a&s;&s;embly endowed it with a charter, and made it a corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of a pre&s;ident, two fellows, and a trea&s;ur|er; re&s;erving unto the governor, deputy-governor, and all the magi&s;trates of the colonies, and the mini|&s;ters of the &s;ix neare&s;t towns for the time being, to be over&s;eers or vi&s;itors of this &s;ociety. The langua|ges and arts were now taught in the college and great
<PB N="132" REF="134">regularity was ob&s;erved. To &s;upport this college, the revenues of Charle&s;town Ferry were appropria|ted by an act of a general court, but the benefactions at la&s;t were &s;o numerous, that the funds there|of became exceedingly &s;trong. A good library was &s;et up, and enriched by many donations of books from gentlemen in England, among whom were Sir Knelem Digby, Sir John Maynard, Mr Richard Bax|ter, and Mr Jo&s;eph Hill. To all the&s;e benefactions the famous Theophilus Gale, who wrote the Court
<PB N="133" REF="135">of the Gentiles, added his own library which he left to Harvard college. Thus was this academy furni&s;h|ed with mathematical in&s;truments, and books of all &s;orts, and &s;upplied with the be&s;t of ma&s;ters. Dun|&s;tar, who was the fir&s;t pre&s;ident, lo&s;t his place by turning Anabapti&s;t, and Mr Charles Chancey was ap|pointed in his &s;tead. Both the manner of admi&s;&s;ion and the method of teaching in this college were very exact and particular.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had attended a grammar-&s;chool till they
<PB N="134" REF="136">could read any cla&s;&s;ical author, and turn it into Eng|li&s;h, could readily make and &s;peak Latin, and write it in pro&s;e or ver&s;e, and could decline Greek nouns and verbs, were judged qualified for admi&s;&s;ion, and upon examination, were accordingly admitted by the pre&s;ident and fellows: After that, they &s;igned the college laws, which they were to tran&s;cribe and pre|&s;erve as continual monitors of the duties which they were obliged by their privileges to ob&s;erve. The pre&s;ident in&s;pected the manners of the &s;tudents, and
<PB N="135" REF="137">every morning and evening &s;aid prayers in the common hall; to which was joined an expo&s;ition of &s;ome chap|ters of the old te&s;tament, which the &s;tudents read out of Hebrew into Greek in the morning: and in the evening &s;ome part of the New Te&s;tament out of Engli&s;h into Greek. He al&s;o preached upon Sunday upon what &s;ubjects he judged mo&s;t proper in the church in Cambridge, where the &s;tudents had a gal|lery allotted them, and where they u&s;ually attended. The fellows re&s;ident were al&s;o tutors in the college; who, after they had taught the &s;tudents Hebrew, in|&s;tructed them in the liberal arts, before the fir&s;t four years were expired. During this time they had their weekly declamations, and di&s;putes, in the college hall, every Friday, where either the pre&s;ident or the fel|lows acted as moderators. Such as &s;tood candidates for degrees, were obliged to attend in the hall for certain hours, on Mondays and on Tue&s;days, for three weeks together, in the middle of June. The&s;e were called vi&s;itation weeks, when all who plea&s;ed, might a&s;k them any que&s;tions, and examine them concerning their &s;kill in the languages, or the &s;ciences, which they
<PB N="136" REF="138">profe&s;&s;ed to under&s;tand. On this occa&s;ion, it was com|mon for &s;ome of the over&s;eers, while they were &s;itting &s;ol&s;tice, as it was called, to vi&s;it them, with a de&s;ign of &s;ee|ing their improvement. When the time of commence|ment began, which was at fir&s;t, the &s;econd Tue&s;day of Augu&s;t, but afterwards the fir&s;t Wedne&s;day of July, tho&s;e who were to proceed batchelors, held their act publicly in Cambridge, where both the ma|gi&s;trates, and mini&s;ters, attended, to confer honour upon their exerci&s;es. The&s;e exerci&s;es were, be&s;ides an oration delivered by the pre&s;ident, orations deli|vered by the commencers, wherein &s;uitable compli|ments were paid to the audience, according to their characters, dignities, and offices. The&s;e academical orations were made not only in latin, but &s;ometimes in Greek and Hebrew. But the principal exerci&s;es were di&s;putations upon que&s;tions, where the re&s;pon|dents exhibited a the&s;is which might be impugned by any who plea&s;ed. In conclu&s;ion, the pre&s;ident deliver|ed a book into the hands of the candidates, and gave them their fir&s;t degree. Tho&s;e who were admitted to the degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts, were obliged to un|dergo a new trial, and di&s;pute upon &s;ome que&s;tion &s;uited to the time they had &s;tudied. When this was fini&s;hed, they received their degree with the &s;ame formality as in the fir&s;t. Such diligence and &s;trictne&s;s could not but have great influence in promoting learn|ing, and preventing many from wa&s;ting their time idly, as happens in many European univer&s;ities, where &s;uch di&s;cipline is not ob&s;erved. Whether this order is &s;till ob&s;erved, I will not pretend to &s;ay; but accor|ding to the laws and &s;tatutes of the college, it ought to be kept up. The &s;tatutes are &s;o expre&s;s, that they mu&s;t expo&s;e them&s;elves greatly, to depart from them.</P>
<PB N="137" REF="139">
<P>There are twenty-three rules in their &s;ta|tutes very expre&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Satutes and Privileges of the Harvard College.

All that are admitted into this college are to be received into a fellow&s;hip, and pay three pounds to the &s;teward, at their admi&s;&s;ion, and at the end of every quarter of a year, pay what expences are due for their board. No &s;tudent &s;hall be allowed to dine or &s;up out of the college without leave from the pre&s;ident or tutors.

<ITEM>XII. None of the older &s;tudents, except the tutors or fellows &s;hall be allowed to force any of the younger ones to go errands, or do any other thing by threaten|ings, words, or blows. If any one, not a graduate, break this rule, he &s;hall be puni&s;hed by bo|dily correction, expul&s;ion, or otherwi&s;e as the pre&s;ident and fellows &s;hall think fit.</ITEM>

But for atro|cious crimes, the puni&s;hment &s;hall be more &s;ummarily execu|ted.</ITEM>

The&s;e were requi|&s;itions they were not ready to comply with, though the latter was exceedingly rea&s;onable; and for their non-compliance, lo&s;t the King's favour, and fell un|der his di&s;plea&s;ure, which they &s;uffered during the whole cour&s;e of his reign.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this di&s;obedience, the King, 1664, i&s;&s;ued a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal, im|powering Colonel Nichols, and three others, therein
<PB N="142" REF="144">named, to go over and enquire into the &s;tate of the colony, and to hear and determine all complaints, and appeals in all cau&s;es, and matters civil, military, or criminal, according to their good and &s;ound di&s;cretion, and to &s;uch in&s;tructions as they had or &s;hould receive. Upon the return and report of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners various complaints and &s;uits were brought again&s;t this colony, till at la&s;t they ended in the condemna|tion of the charter, and the total di&s;&s;olution of their government, in the year 1684. Charles gave the fini&s;h|ing
<PB N="143" REF="145">&s;troke to their charter, and his brother James &s;uc|ceeded, to exerci&s;e a de&s;poti&s;m over them in its out|mo&s;t extent. Sir Edmund Andros was appointed to be their governor, who would not &s;uffer them to e|lect an a&s;&s;embly or council, or to have any other go|vernment than what depended upon his arbitrary plea|&s;ure. He him&s;elf made laws, rai&s;ed troops, levied taxes, and managed all things with a council of his own creatures, whom he made the in&s;truments of his tyran|ny, and the promoters of the ends of his covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<PB N="144" REF="146">
<P>New-England was now in a mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;ituation; their charters were di&s;&s;olved, and the whole province brought into a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;ubjection. They were told that their charters being di&s;&s;olved, their titles to their lands were forefeited therewith, and now belonged to the King. Under this pretence, they were called upon to take out new patents for their lands, &s;ubject to &s;uch fines as &s;hould be impo&s;ed; and writs of ejectment were brought again&s;t &s;uch as refu&s;ed, to put them out of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This was tyranny with a witne&s;s, but exceedingly con&s;i&s;t|ent with the other mea&s;ures of the government at that time. The colony de&s;erved to feel &s;ome cha&s;|ti&s;ement for their &s;pirit of intolerance; but this was cha&s;ti&s;ement beyond all mea&s;ure, and from hands that were guilty of higher tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. A general ex|ception was al&s;o made to all titles, in con&s;equence of the di&s;olving of the charter, and the towns were de|clared to be incapable of receiving any e&s;tates; this rendered their &s;ituation truly abject. The town of Ip&s;|wich remon&s;trated again&s;t paying taxes levied by the governor's &s;ole authority, without the con&s;ent of an a&s;&s;embly, or of the parliament, and the &s;elect men voted, "That in as much as it is again&s;t the privi|lege of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, to have money rai&s;ed with|out their con&s;ent, in an a&s;&s;embly or parliament, they

<PB N="145" REF="148">therefore will petition the King for liberty of an a&s;|&s;embly, before they make any rates." For this, two of them were impri&s;oned, and the re&s;t fined twenty, thirty, and fifty pounds a man.</P>
<P>In this condition of oppre&s;&s;ion, did this colony, and &s;ome others remain, till the acce&s;&s;ion of King William to the throne of Great Britain, when the people of Bo|&s;ton &s;eized upon their governor, and called a convention. This a&s;&s;embly added two new agents to the two that were in England, and &s;ent them over with in&s;tructions, to &s;olicit the continuance of their ancient charter, and all its rights and privileges; and if there &s;hould be an opportunity, to endeavour the obtaining &s;uch further privileges as might be of benefit to the colo|ny. It had been re&s;olved in the hou&s;e of commons, that the &s;eizing of the charters of the corporations and colonies, in the reign of Charles the &s;econd, was illegal, and a bill had been brought in for the renew|al of them, but it did not pa&s;s, though it was the ge|neral &s;en&s;e of the be&s;t friends of the con&s;titution, that it ought to have pa&s;&s;ed. From this con&s;ideration, the agents, however, concluded, that they might be allowed to re&s;ume their charter, which, according to the opinion of the mo&s;t noted lawyers, could have been of very little &s;ervice to them, whenever an ar|bitrary mini&s;try &s;hould think fit to confine them to the letter thereof. The reader will judge for him&s;elf when he con&s;iders the charter, whether it is liable to the defects which are imputed to it. The opinion of council, which was taken at that time, was, "That a bare re&s;titution of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts charter could be of no &s;ervice at all, becau&s;e it was defective in five particulars. They had no power thereby to call a &s;elect a&s;&s;embly,&mdash;no power to lay taxes, and rai&s;e money on the inhabi|tants, whether freemen, or &s;trangers trading with
<PB N="146" REF="149">them;&mdash;they had no admiralty,&mdash;no power to keep a prerogative court, to prove wills, nor to erect courts of judicature, e&s;pecially chancery courts. Some of their agents were very zealous to have the old char|ter renewed, but it would appear, they either did not under&s;tand the nature of it, nor were aware of the con&s;equences which might ari&s;e from the quirks of lawyers, concerning their not literally fulfilling the conditions thereof. This charter did, indeed, affirm that they had power to impri&s;on, or inflict puni&s;hment in criminal ca&s;es, according to the cour&s;e of corpo|rations in England; but the lawyers &s;aid, that unle&s;s capital ca&s;es were expre&s;sly mentioned, the power could not reach <HI>them:</HI> That they had no power to erect ju|dicatories, or courts for probates of wills, or with ad|miralty juri&s;diction; nor had they power to con&s;titute an hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, nor impo&s;e taxes on the inhabitants; nor to incorporate towns, colleges, or &s;chools, which power and privileges they had, not|with&s;tanding, u&s;urped; and of con&s;equence, by law, had forfeited their charter. An hi&s;torian who reads the tran&s;actions of tho&s;e times, and judges upon the principles of common &s;en&s;e, finds him&s;elf greatly at a lo&s;s, when he finds a power granted to a people to make laws to them&s;elves, provided they are con|&s;i&s;tent with the laws of England, and yet men who pretend to know the law better than others, decla|ring that there are many things which the &s;ubjects in England may do, that tho&s;e in America may not do; were mankind dive&s;ted of felfi&s;hne&s;s and preju|dice, they would certainly infer, that an authority to make laws &s;uited to any &s;ociety, agreeable to the laws of another &s;ociety, implied a right to make as many as they plea&s;ed, provided they were con&s;i&s;tent with that general rule. If this is not the meaning of the
<PB N="147" REF="150">words of the charter, it will be difficult to &s;ay what is the meaning of words. It has been alledged that the American charters cannot be in&s;i&s;ted upon, as gi|ving them a right of exemption from the juri&s;diction of parliament; and it is certainly true: but it is al&s;o true, that all incorporated towns in England have a &s;hare in the legi&s;lature, which the coloni&s;ts have not; which right they have by their charters. It does not appear that the&s;e coloni&s;ts wanted to be free from the juri&s;diction of parliament, but to have a &s;hare in the legi&s;lature which pretends to tax them, which is certainly rea&s;onable. And as their local circum&s;tances render it next to impo&s;&s;ible for them to attend in England, they only a&s;k the privilege which Britons require at home, to tax them&s;elves by their own re|pre&s;entatives; and if they are free men at all, and not &s;laves, this mu&s;t be their undoubted privilege.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the characters of nations and peo|ple, it will be difficult to find con&s;i&s;tency in the con|duct of any that have yet exi&s;ted in this world. Our coloni&s;ts who fled from per&s;ecution in their native country, turned tyrants to &s;ome of their brethern, when once they got power into their own hands. The Anabapti&s;ts and Quakers were the objects of their highe&s;t aver&s;ion: they per&s;ecuted them with un|relenting rigour, even unto death; and becau&s;e they could not believe the &s;ame creed with them, they de|nied them the privileges of men and citizens. This was perverting religion to the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es, and making the mild and merciful dictates of our Saviour, the ground work of malice, tyranny, and per&s;ecution. This is &s;uch a blot in the character of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, that nothing can wipe away the reproach from their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, but a total renunciation of both the prin|ciples and practices which their progenitors pur&s;ued.
<PB N="148" REF="151">Liberty, the noble privilege of all hone&s;t men, can never be con&s;i&s;tently maintained, without allowing o|thers as much as we take to our&s;elves, while they do not hold practical principles, de&s;tructive of the rights of all other people. It has been too often the di&s;po|&s;ition of religious &s;ocieties, to blend the ideas of civil and religious things, and to make a certain form of religion, a <HI>&s;ine qua non,</HI> of mens right to enjoy the li|berty of free citizens. This at once makes the king|dom of our Lord, a kingdom of this world, and ren|ders every form of godline&s;s a tool of private intere&s;t, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and pride. How far the coloni&s;ts have re|formed their practices in this point, will appear in the &s;equel of this hi&s;tory; where they &s;hall be &s;et in that light they de&s;erve, as far as their actions point them out. Free from partiality to friends or foes, we &s;hall endeavour to &s;teer our cour&s;e, and keep truth in view, as the unerring compa&s;s of all true and impar|tial hi&s;tory. But we &s;hall now return to the more immediate cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent war, and the chief object of this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction which the repeal of the &s;tamp act gave the coloni&s;ts, did not remove their apprehen&s;ions concerning the de&s;igns of the mini&s;try to oppre&s;s them; and the future proceedings of the Engli&s;h par|liament, in giving &s;anction to the requi&s;itions of the executive power, did fully confirm their apprehen|&s;ions. The laws that were pa&s;&s;ed this year, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue in the colonies, by the laying of duties on the importation of gla&s;s and pa|per, and other commodities from Britain, and the con&s;equent e&s;tabli&s;hment of cu&s;tom-hou&s;es in their ports, alarmed them greatly. The&s;e produced dread|ful convul&s;ions in the colonies, and produced con&s;e|quences highly prejudicial to the commercial intere&s;ts
<PB N="149" REF="152">of the mother country. It will at lea&s;t appear unfor|tunate, if not altogether impolitic, after the recent examples of the mi&s;chief that attended the &s;tamp act, and the con&s;equent repeal thereof, from a conviction of tho&s;e evils, a mea&s;ure of a like tendency &s;hould have been &s;o &s;peedily adopted, before the chagrin on account of the former irritation was worn off the minds of the coloni&s;ts. Much the &s;ame arguments have been u&s;ed in the defence of tho&s;e mea&s;ures that were made in &s;upport of the &s;tamp act, which &s;hall be taken notice of, after we have con&s;idered the op|po&s;ition that was made to the new &s;tatutes of this year.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t vi&s;ible in&s;tance of oppo&s;ition &s;hewn to the&s;e &s;tatutes, happened at Bo&s;ton, October 27th, 1767, where the inhabitants, at a general meeting, formed, and agreed to &s;everal re&s;olutions, for the en|couragement of manufactures, promoting frugality, and oeconomy, and for le&s;&s;ening and re&s;training of all &s;uperfluities. The&s;e re&s;olutions, which were all of them in the fir&s;t in&s;tance prejudicial to the commerce of Britain, contained an enumeration of articles, which it was determined not to u&s;e at all, or in as low a degree as po&s;&s;ible. At the &s;ame time, a &s;ub|&s;cription was opened, and a committee appointed for the encouragement of their own former manufac|tures, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of new ones. Among the&s;e, it was agreed to give particular encouragement to the making of paper and gla&s;s, and the other com|modities that were liable to the payment of new du|ties upon importation. It was al&s;o re&s;olved to re|&s;train the expences of funerals, and to reduce dre&s;s to a degree of primitive &s;implicity and plaine&s;s, and in general, not to purcha&s;e from the mother country any thing that could be procured in the colonies. The&s;e re&s;olutions were adopted, or &s;imilar ones a|greed
<PB N="150" REF="153">upon by all the old colonies on the continent. The government of Britain might have by this time perceived that a people of &s;uch a Spartan ta&s;te were not to be ea&s;ily frightened into compliance with &s;u&s;pi|cious, or arbitrary acts of a legi&s;lature, where they had none to repre&s;ent them. A people that have as much public virtue as to become unfa&s;hionable, for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving the rights of the community, and can re&s;train their pa&s;&s;ions and appetites for the &s;ake of their country, are not ea&s;ily to be driven to a compliance with acts they conceive to be unrea&s;on|able. Whatever may be the errors or mi&s;takes in the conduct of the coloni&s;ts, and however far they may have acted wrong in &s;ome particulars, yet they have &s;hewn a &s;teadine&s;s of principle and practice, that has at lea&s;t the appearance of virtue, and which their ene|mies mu&s;t admire, though their pride will not &s;uffer them to acknowledge it.</P>
<P>What had lately irritated both parties in this di&s;|pute, was the proceedings of the a&s;&s;embly at New-York, and the act of the Briti&s;h parliament, made in con&s;equence thereof. It had been appointed by par|liament in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the people of New-York &s;hould provide for the King's troops, according to a method expre&s;&s;ed in the act; which the a&s;&s;embly, in&s;tead of ob&s;erving, pur&s;ued a mea&s;ure of their own, without paying any regard to the pre&s;cription of par|liament. Whether they &s;hewed this oppo&s;ition out of mere wilfulne&s;s, or claimed it as a principle of right, to ob&s;erve their own way in providing for the troops, I will not affirm; but this was &s;o offen&s;ive to the legi&s;lature of Britain, that they pa&s;&s;ed an act, June 15th, whereby the governor, council, and a&s;&s;embly of New-York, are prohibited from pa&s;&s;ing any act of a&s;&s;embly what&s;oever, till they had complied with the
<PB N="151" REF="154">terms of the act of parliament in every particular. This was de&s;igned as a le&s;&s;on to the other colonies, to teach them more reverence to acts of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature; but it did not produce the intended ef|fect; for the coloni&s;ts who had begun to que&s;tion the right of the parliament to make laws for them, were not di&s;po&s;ed to obey a &s;tatute that was &s;pecially de|&s;igned to point out that they were in a &s;tate of va&s;|&s;alage. By &s;uch oppo&s;ition of conduct, the leading actors on both &s;ides grew more and more warm in their di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;carcely could re&s;train them&s;elves within the bounds of decency and temper. The &s;peeches of each party were often uncharitable, and recriminating, and expre&s;&s;ed more the &s;pirit of party than liberality of &s;entiment, becoming contenders for liberty and the rights of mankind.</P>
<P>We are now approaching to the beginning of an year that is crowded with incidents, and teems with tran&s;actions of the greate&s;t importance. The &s;pirits of the colonies were now agitated to a degree of en|thu&s;ia&s;m for their liberties, and they con&s;idered every new act of parliament as a fre&s;h attack upon their free|dom, and an in&s;ult to their under&s;tanding. Upon the eleventh of February, 1768, the a&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts bay &s;ent a circular letter, &s;igned by their &s;peaker to all the other colonies in North America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CIRCULAR LETTER.

<P>You are already too well ac|quainted with the melancholy and very alarming circum&s;tances to which this province, as well as A|merica in general, is now reduced. Taxes, equally detrimental to the commercial intere&s;ts of the parent country and her colonies, are im|po&s;ed upon the people, without their con&s;ent: taxes de&s;igned for the &s;upport of the civil government in the colonies, in a manner clear|ly uncon&s;titutional, and contrary to that in which, till of late, govern|ment has been &s;upported, by the free gift of the people in the Ame|rican a&s;&s;emblies or parliaments; as al&s;o for the maintenance of a large &s;tanding army; not for the defence of the newly-acquired territories, but for the old colonies, and in time of peace. The decent, hum|ble, and truly loyal applications and petitions from the repre&s;enta|tives of this province, for the re|dre&s;s of the&s;e heavy and very threa|tening grievances, have hitherto been ineffectual, being a&s;&s;ured from authentic intelligence that they have not yet reached the royal ear: the only effect of tran&s;mitting the&s;e applications hitherto perceivable, has been a mandate from one of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ecretaries of &s;tate to the governor of this province, to di&s;|&s;olve the general a&s;&s;embly, merely becau&s;e the late hou&s;e of repre&s;en|tatives refu&s;ed to re&s;cind a re&s;olu|tion of a former hou&s;e, which im|plied nothing more than a right in the American &s;ubjects to unite in humble and dutiful petitions to their gracious &s;overeign, when they found them&s;elves aggrieved: this is a right naturally inherent in eve|ry man, and expre&s;sly recognized at the glorious Revolution as the birth-right of an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>This di&s;&s;olution you are &s;en&s;ible has taken place; the governor has publicly and repeatedly declared that he cannot call another a&s;&s;em|bly; and the &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the American department, in one of his letters communicated to the late hou&s;e, has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, 'proper care will be taken for the &s;upport of the dignity of govern|ment;' the meaning of which is too plain to be mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The concern and perplexity into which the&s;e things have thrown the people, have been greatly aggr$va|ted by a late declaration of his ex|cellency Governor Bernard, that one or more regiments may &s;oon be expected in this province.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the&s;e troops is e|very one's apprehen&s;ion; nothing &s;hort of enforcing by military power the execution of acts of parliament, in the forming of which the colo|nies have not, and cannot have any con&s;titutional influence. This is one of the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which a free people can be redu|ced.</P>
<P>The town which we have the ho|nour to &s;erve, have taken the&s;e things at their late meeting into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration: And as there is in the minds of many a prevailing apprehen&s;ion of an approaching war with France, they have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;everal votes, which we tran&s;mit to you, de&s;iring that they may be immediately laid before the town who&s;e prudentials are in your care, at a legal meet|ing for their candid and particular attention.</P>
<P>Deprived of the councils of a general a&s;&s;embly in this dark and difficult &s;ea&s;on, the loyal people of this province will, we are per&s;ua|ded, immediately perceive the pro|priety and utility of the propo&s;ed committee of convention: and the &s;ound and whole&s;ome advice that may be expected from a num|ber of gentlemen cho&s;en by them|&s;elves, and in whom they may re|po&s;e the greate&s;t confidence; mu&s;t tend to the real &s;ervice of our gra|cious &s;overeign, and the welfare of his &s;ubjects in this province, and may happily prevent any &s;udden and unconnected mea&s;ures, which in their pre&s;ent anxiety, add even agony of mind, they may be in dan|ger of falling into.</P>
<P>As it is of importance that the convention &s;hould meet as &s;oon as may be, &s;o early a day as the 22d of this in&s;tant September has been propo&s;ed for that purpo&s;e&mdash;and it is hoped the remote&s;t towns will by that time, or as &s;oon after as conveniently may be, return their re&s;pective committees.</P>
<P>Not doubting but that you are equally concerned with us, and our fellow citizens, for the pre&s;ervation of our invaluable rights, and for the general happine&s;s of our coun|try, and that you are di&s;po&s;ed with equal ardor to exert your&s;elves in every con&s;titutional way for &s;o glo|rious a purpo&s;e.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE>. The de|&s;ign of this letter, was to &s;hew the dangerous ten|dency of the late acts of parliament, to repre&s;ent
<PB N="152" REF="155">them as uncon&s;titutional, and to propo&s;e a common u|nion among the colonies in the pur&s;uit of all legal mea|&s;ures to prevent their effect, on an harmony in their applications to government, to obtain a repeal of them. It al&s;o largely &s;ets forth their con&s;titutional rights as Engli&s;h &s;ubjects; all of which they affirm were infringed by the&s;e new laws.</P>
<P>At this period, and for &s;ome years before the a&s;|&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay and their governor had almo&s;t differed in their opinion upon every &s;ubject,
<PB N="151" REF="156">which had been the occa&s;ion of continual altercation. This altercation was carried on with great a&s;perity on both &s;ides, and both parties &s;eemed more attentive to keene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;everity in their replies, than to the propriety of mea&s;ures, or the advantages of civil government. The&s;e di&s;putes &s;o &s;oured the tem|pers of the parties, that it was not ea&s;y for them to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures in connection, without &s;hewing a temper incon&s;i&s;tent with mutual confidence. Gover|nor Bernard was con&s;idered as a per&s;on who was looking up to the &s;overeign, for a dignity which his pride &s;ugge&s;ted to him he de&s;erved, and for that rea|&s;on, was more careful to plea&s;e the mini&s;try, than to &s;tudy the real advantage of the colony. He had &s;hewn an imperious &s;tiffne&s;s in his behaviour, which did not &s;uit the temper of a people that were exceed|ing jealous of their liberty. His an&s;wers to their pe|titions and reque&s;ts were formal, arbitrary, and will|fully di&s;obliging<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>

<P>As I have lately received from his maje&s;ty &s;trict orders to &s;upport his con&s;titutional authority within this government, I cannot &s;it &s;till, and &s;ee &s;o notorious a violation of it, as the calling an a&s;&s;embly of the people by private per&s;ons only. For a meeting of the deputies of the towns is an a&s;&s;embly of the re|pre&s;entatives of the people to all intents and purpo&s;es; and it is not the calling it a committee of con|vention that will alter the nature of the thing.</P>
<P>I am willing to believe that the gentlemen who &s;o ha&s;tily i&s;&s;ued the &s;ummons for this meeting were not aware of the high nature of the offence they were committing; and they who have obeyed them have not well con&s;idered of the penalties which they will incur if they &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in continuing their &s;e&s;&s;ion and doing bu&s;ine&s;s therein. At pre&s;ent, ignorance of law may ex|cu&s;e what is pa&s;t: a &s;tep farther will take away that plea.</P>
<P>It is therefore my duty to inter|po&s;e, at this in&s;tant, before it is too late.

<PB N="152" REF="157">&s;often the tempers of the a&s;&s;embly already &s;ufficiently rankled and over heated, he added fuel to the flame, by talking of prerogative, and the determination of the &s;overeign to &s;upport his dignity. It was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that the royal determination depended much upon the repre&s;entation that he had given of the co|loni&s;ts, and that the mini&s;terial vengence proceeded in a great mea&s;ure from tho&s;e partial accounts of the temper of the people repre&s;ented in his letters to the mini&s;ters of &s;tate.</P>
<P>A letter which the governor received from the Earl of Shelburne, one of the principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, and which contained &s;ome &s;evere &s;trictures on the behaviour of the colonies, and the conduct of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a&s;&s;embly, was, by the order of the go|vernor, and according to its original de&s;ign, read to that body by their &s;ecretary. This produced great debates in the a&s;&s;embly, when &s;everal &s;evere things were &s;aid, with very little temper, and ob&s;ervations
<PB N="153" REF="158">made, not quite con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of &s;uch a meeting. It was alleged in tho&s;e debates, that Lord Shelburne's letter proceeded upon topics which the governor's repre&s;entation of the colonies had &s;ugge&s;t|ed; and that the &s;everity of the &s;ecretary's letter took its ri&s;e from a mi&s;repre&s;entation of facts, given by the governor in his di&s;patches to the mini&s;try. A com|mittee was appointed to wait upon him, to de&s;ire a co|py of Lord Shelburne's letter, as well as tho&s;e that he had written him&s;elf, with relation to the a&s;&s;embly, and to which the charges in his Lord&s;hip's letter mu&s;t refer. The&s;e copies being refu&s;ed, the a&s;&s;embly wrote a let|ter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in which they recite the circum&s;tances of the whole tran&s;action, and endeavour to vindicate them&s;elves, and their conduct, at the ex|pence of the governor, whom they charge with mi&s;|repre&s;enting them, and being the occa&s;ion of the ill opinion which the &s;ecretary had concerning them. They al&s;o wrote letters to the Lords of the trea&s;ury, and &s;everal other great officers of &s;tate, wherein, to|gether with profe&s;&s;ions of their loyalty, they remon|&s;trated again&s;t the operations of the late acts of parlia|ment; which they hinted, were contrary to the con&s;ti|tution, and totally &s;ubver&s;ive of their rights and li|berties.</P>
<P>Such a firm oppo&s;ition was by no means agreeable to the temper of the governor, who probably had gi|ven a&s;&s;urances to the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, that a &s;harp rebuke from tho&s;e in power in England, would make them return to their duty and obedience. He found him&s;elf deceived, as well as found that they had en|deavoured to expo&s;e him as neither a friend to the King nor to the colonies; &s;o when he found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in all his other &s;chemes, he adjourned the a&s;&s;embly. In the &s;peech which he delivered on
<PB N="154" REF="159">this occa&s;ion, he made many animadver&s;ions upon their conduct, e&s;pecially with regard to Lord Shel|burne's letter; and he complained greatly of &s;ome turbulent and factious members, who, under fal&s;e pre|tences of patrioti&s;m, had unhappily procured too great influence in the a&s;&s;embly, and among the people, who &s;acrificed their country to the gratification of their pa&s;&s;ions, and to the &s;upport of an importance, which could have no exi&s;tence but in times of trouble and confu&s;ion. It is a common thing for all men that are gra&s;ping at power and domination, to charge all peo|ple with the crime of factiou&s;ne&s;s, that oppo&s;e their mea&s;ures; the whole &s;truggles for liberty, in all ages of the world, have been accounted factious operations, of re&s;tle&s;s per&s;ons, who had no other intention than to di&s;turb good and peaceable governors, who never de|&s;erved to be re&s;i&s;ted. The famous patriots who brought about the glorious revolution, were, by the Tories of tho&s;e times, accounted a faction, and char|ged with the wor&s;t of crimes, for &s;aving the nation from Popery and tyranny.</P>
<P>While the&s;e di&s;turbances in America were gaining ground by mini&s;terial incapacity and oppo&s;ition, a new &s;ecretary of &s;tate was appointed at home, to the de|partment of the colonies. Much was hoped from this new in&s;titution and arrangement; but though the in&s;titution it&s;elf was good, the advantages ari&s;ing therefrom, depended upon the manner of di&s;charging the office. The fir&s;t who was &s;ettled in this new depart|ment of &s;tate, was Lord Hill&s;borough, who did not by any lenient or &s;oftening mea&s;ures, attempt to &s;of|ten the tempers of the colonies. Whether his or|ders were expre&s;s to ob&s;erve the conduct which he pur&s;ued, or that he made u&s;e of the royal authority to awe the coloni&s;ts into a compliance with the man|dates
<PB N="155" REF="160" MS="Y">of government, I will not pretend to affirm; but in his circular letters to the governors of the co|lonies, which had received the circular letter from the a&s;&s;embly of Bo&s;ton, he expre&s;&s;es his Maje&s;ty's di&s;|like of that letter in very &s;trong terms. It was de|clared in Lord Hill&s;borough's letter, that his Maje|&s;ty con&s;idered the conduct of the a&s;&s;embly of Bo&s;ton as of the mo&s;t dangerous and factious tendency, cal|culated to inflame the minds of the people, to pro|mote an unwarrantable combination; to excite an o|pen oppo&s;ition to, and denial of the authority of par|liament, and to &s;ubvert the true principles of the con|&s;titution; and that his Maje&s;ty expected, from the known affection of the re&s;pective a&s;&s;emblies, that they would defeat this flagitious attempt to di&s;turb the public peace, and treat it with the contempt it de|&s;erved, by taking no notice of it.</P>
<P>Another letter of the &s;ame date was &s;ent to Gover|nor Bernard, in which the &s;ame exceptions are made to the circular letter. It is there affirmed, that the mea&s;ure had been carried in a thin hou&s;e, at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and in which the a&s;&s;embly departed from that &s;pirit of prudence and re&s;pect to the con|&s;titution, which &s;eemed to have influenced the majo|rity of its members in a full hou&s;e, and at the begin|ning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion: from hence his Maje&s;ty could not but con&s;ider it as a very unfair proceeding, and to have been carried by &s;urpri&s;e through the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives. It was then required in his Maje|&s;ty's name, that the new a&s;&s;embly would re&s;cind the re&s;olution which gave exi&s;tence to the circular letter, and declare their di&s;approbation of, and di&s;&s;ent to &s;o ra&s;h and ha&s;ty a proceeding: That as his Maje&s;ty had the fulle&s;t reliance on the affections of his &s;ubjects of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, he had the better ground to hope,
<PB N="156" REF="161">that the attempts made by a de&s;perate faction, to di&s;|turb the public tranquility, would be di&s;countenanced, and that the execution of the mea&s;ure recommended, would not meet with any difficulty. Both the mini|&s;try and the governor were mi&s;taken in this conjec|ture. On the 21&s;t of June, this part of the letter was laid before the new a&s;&s;embly by the governor, with a me&s;&s;age, in which he earne&s;tly reque&s;ted their com|pliance; but ob&s;erved, that in ca&s;e of a contrary beha|viour, he had received his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions how to act, and mu&s;t do his duty. This produced a me&s;|&s;age from the a&s;&s;embly, in which they de&s;ired a copy of the in&s;tructions which the governor alluded to, as well as of &s;ome letters and papers he had laid before the council. The governor &s;ent a copy of the remain|der of Lord Hill&s;borough's letter, in which the in|&s;tructions were contained, to the a&s;&s;embly, by which he was directed, in ca&s;e of their refu&s;ing to comply with his Maje&s;ty's rea&s;onable expectations, to di&s;&s;olve them immediately, and to tran&s;mit a copy of their pro|ceedings upon it, to be laid before the parliament. The whole of tho&s;e requi&s;itions, made by the govern|ment of Britain upon this colony, were con&s;idered by the coloni&s;ts as the effects of the mi&s;repre&s;entations of their own governor, who, as he wanted to rule o|ver them with an arbitrary power, was provoked at their oppo&s;ition, and therefore repre&s;ented them to the King and the mini&s;try as a perver&s;e and factious &s;et of people that would be ruled by no law, and de|&s;pi&s;ed all government.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly gave no an&s;wer to the governor's re|que&s;t, till his patience was almo&s;t worn out, and he was obliged to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to them, to urge their compliance with the King's demands. In an&s;wer to this me&s;&s;age, they applied for a rece&s;s, that they
<PB N="157" REF="162">might have an opportunity to con&s;ult, and advi&s;e with their con&s;tituents upon the occa&s;ion. This was what the governor knew would be of no &s;ervice to his &s;cheme, but would rather add fuel to the fire that was already kindled; he therefore refu&s;ed their re|que&s;t. Upon which they put the que&s;tion, for re|&s;cinding the re&s;olution of the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly, which pa&s;|&s;ed in the negative, by a divi&s;ion of ninety two to &s;e|venteen. This &s;hews how badly the &s;ecretary had been informed concerning the temper of the majori|ty, when he affirmed, that the mea&s;ure had been car|ried in a thin meeting, contrary to the opinion of the majority, who were ab&s;ent. It appears to be a com|mon infirmity prevailing with men of all ranks to be|lieve, at lea&s;t on occa&s;ions to affirm, what is mo&s;t a|greeable to their own inclinations and intere&s;ts, how|ever little evidence they have for their conduct.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly then re&s;olved to write a letter to Lord Hill&s;borough, and an an&s;wer to the Governor. In both the&s;e letters, they endeavour to vindicate the con|duct of the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly, as well as the pre&s;ent, and deny the charges brought again&s;t them, of carrying the re&s;olution by &s;urpri&s;e in a thin meeting of the a&s;&s;embly, and affirm on the contrary, that the re&s;o|lution for the circular letter was pa&s;&s;ed in a full &s;e&s;&s;ion, and by a great majority. They al&s;o de|fended the legality of that mea&s;ure, and affirmed that it was the inherent right of all &s;ubjects to petition the King, either jointly or &s;eparately, for a redre&s;s of grievances. In regard to the re&s;cinding the re&s;olu|tion, it was ob&s;erved, that to &s;peak in the &s;tile of the common law, it was not now <HI>executory,</HI> but to all in|tents and purpo&s;es <HI>executed:</HI> That the circular letters had been &s;ent, and many of them an&s;wered: That both had appeared in the public papers, and that they
<PB N="158" REF="163">could now as well re&s;cind the letters as the re&s;olves on which they were founded, and that both would be equally fruitle&s;s. In the letter to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, they made &s;everal &s;trictures with great free|dom on the nature of the requi&s;ition, and alleged that it was uncon&s;titutional, and without a precedent, to command a free a&s;&s;embly, on pain of its exi&s;tence, to re&s;cind any re&s;olution, much le&s;s that of a former hou&s;e. They complained greatly of the ba&s;e and wicked repre&s;entations, that mu&s;t have been made to his Maje&s;ty, to cau&s;e him to con&s;ider a mea&s;ure per|fectly legal and con&s;titutional, and which only tended to lay the grievances of the &s;ubjects before the throne, as of an inflammatory nature, tending to create unwar|rantable combinations, and to excite an oppo&s;ition to the authority of parliament, which are the terms in which it is de&s;cribed in the letter. They concluded with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of loyalty, and the &s;trong|e&s;t remon&s;trances again&s;t the late laws&punc; They were at the &s;ame time preparing a petition to the King for removal of their governor, in which they bring many heavy charges again&s;t him, that were urged with great vehemency, and expre&s;&s;ed in very &s;trong terms. But before they had fini&s;hed this petition, the governor took care to di&s;&s;olve the a&s;&s;embly. The a&s;&s;emblies in America were now become &s;omething like the Eng|li&s;h parliaments in the reign of Charles the fir&s;t, by no means tractable to the call of the court and &s;overeign; for which rea&s;on they were continually di&s;&s;olved. But they were &s;till as &s;imilar in their ca&s;es, the new a&s;&s;em|blies were as tenacious of their rights as the old ones, and took up the grievances where the former a&s;&s;em|blies left them, and began with new remon&s;trances, while the&s;e matters were warmly pur&s;ued in the colo|nies, and their a&s;&s;emblies continually di&s;&s;olved, the
<PB N="159" REF="164">grand a&s;&s;embly of Britain continued un&s;haken by the whole force of petitions and remon&s;trances that were levelled again&s;t it. The commons of Britain and the mini&s;try under&s;tood one another, &s;o that the whole force of national petitions, and remon&s;trances could not procure a di&s;&s;olution of parliament.</P>
<P>The circular letters which had been written by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate to the other colonies, were attend|ed with as little &s;ucce&s;s as that which was &s;ent to Bo|&s;ton. The a&s;&s;emblies of the other colonies wrote an|&s;wers to that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, which were re|ceived by the late &s;peaker, in which they expre&s;s the highe&s;t and warme&s;t approbation of their conduct, and a firm re&s;olution to concur with their mea&s;ures. Some of the colonies al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed the &s;ecratary of &s;tate, and ju&s;tified the mea&s;ures taken by the a&s;&s;em|bly at Bo&s;ton, and al&s;o animadverted with great free|dom upon &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the requi&s;ition contained in his letter. In the mean time, &s;everal of them en|tered into re&s;olutions, not to import or purcha&s;e any Engli&s;h goods, except what were already ordered for the en&s;uing fall, or &s;uch articles as they could not want, until the late acts were repealed.</P>
<P>On the 10th of June, 1768, a little before the di&s;|&s;olution of the a&s;&s;embly, a great tumult happened at Bo&s;ton. The board of cu&s;toms had made a &s;eizure of a &s;loop belonging to one of the principal merchants of that town. That &s;loop had been di&s;charged of a cargo of wine, and in part re-loaded with a quantity of oil, which is &s;aid to have been done under pretence of converting it into a &s;tore, without any great atten|tion being paid to the new laws, or to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e regulations. Upon the &s;eizure being made, the officers made a &s;ignal to the Romney man of war, and her boats were &s;ent manned and armed, who
<PB N="160" REF="165">cut away the ma&s;ts of the &s;loop, and conveyed her under the protection of the man of war. The people, having a&s;&s;embled in great multitudes upon this occa|&s;ion, pelted the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms with &s;tones, broke one of their &s;words, and treated them in other re&s;pects with great outrage; after which, they attack|ed their hou&s;es, broke the windows, and hauled the collector's boat to the common, and burnt it to a&s;hes. The officers of the cu&s;toms upon this outrage, took &s;helter aboard the man of war, from whence they removed to ca&s;tle William, where they re&s;umed the functions of their office. This tran&s;action occa&s;ion|ed &s;everal town meetings, in which a remon&s;trance was pre&s;ented to the governor, wherein they claimed rights directly oppo&s;ite to the new laws of the Bri|ti&s;h legi&s;lature, and demanded that the governor would i&s;&s;ue an order for the departure of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip out of the harbour. The minds of the people were now greatly irritated; they perceived that the new laws would be enforced by every exertion of the king and parliament, and as they di&s;puted the right of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature to impo&s;e &s;uch laws upon them, when they had no &s;hare therein, they looked upon them&s;elves as oppre&s;&s;ed by an unwarrantable authori|ty. Their &s;pirits were now wrought up to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, which led them to tho&s;e acts of out|rage which men are ready to fall into, when they are bereaved of what they believe to be their natural rights. There is no que&s;tion but the leaders in the oppo&s;ition neglected no arts that they thought nece&s;|&s;ary to inflame the minds of the people, which when once they were wrought to a very high pitch, could not even be re&s;trained by the authority of tho&s;e who had inflamed them. In the fervour of controver&s;y, it is difficult for men to re&s;train their pa&s;&s;ions, or to
<PB N="161" REF="166">ob&s;erve a proper decency in expre&s;&s;ing them. The writer of the hi&s;torical part of the <HI>Annual Regi&s;ter</HI> ob&s;erves, that <Q>their public writers, as well as &s;peakers, were ge|nerally &startq;very intemperate, and a certain &s;tile and man|ner was introduced, which &s;eemed peculiar to them|&s;elves, &endq;and too ridiculous for &s;erious compo&s;ition.</Q> It is ea&s;y for &s;uch as do not immediately feel the pain which others &s;uffer, to account their behaviour ridi|culous in the paroxi&s;m of their di&s;temper; but pro|vided they were in their &s;ituation, their behaviour would probably be as ridiculous. There is a warmth of zeal that appears in their compo&s;itions, as will hap|pen in all ca&s;es when men are in earne&s;t, but at the &s;ame time, a due re&s;pect to the characters they are addre&s;&s;ing; and unle&s;s men's eyes are blinded through a &s;elfi&s;h prejudice, they mu&s;t be obliged to confe&s;s, that &s;o far as the pen has been employed in this contro|ver&s;y, the coloni&s;ts have made no contemptible figure. There is an incon&s;i&s;tency that has been urged again&s;t &s;ome of their publications, <Q>that when on one hand, &startq;they &s;eem to forget their dependency as colonies, and a&s;&s;ume the tone of di&s;tinct and original &s;tates; on the other hand, they claim all the benefits of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and the highe&s;t rights of Eng|li&s;hmen, but forget that it is their dependence which can entitle them to any &s;hare of tho&s;e rights and &endq;benefits.</Q> In this there does not appear &s;o great incon&s;i&s;tency as &s;ome do imagine. As members of the empire, and &s;ubjects of the &s;ame &s;overeign, they are mutually dependent, as other &s;ubjects are upon government and the con&s;titution; but then they cer|tainly are entitled to &s;ome &s;hare with their brethren in the legi&s;lature&punc; otherwi&s;e they differ nothing from &s;laves. We &s;hall &s;ee afterwards what they &s;ay for them&s;elves, and what their mo&s;t &s;anguine oppo&s;ers
<PB N="162" REF="167">have &s;aid again&s;t them, when the reader &s;hall be le&s;t to judge for him&s;elf concerning the conclu&s;ions ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be drawn.</P>
<P>A report that their petition to the King had not been delivered by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, exa&s;perated them greatly. It was &s;aid that the petition was re|fu&s;ed to be received at London, becau&s;e the agent had not proper authority, and becau&s;e the governor had not &s;igned it. The di&s;olution of their a&s;&s;embly had encrea&s;ed their &s;u&s;picions, and the affair of the &s;eizing the &s;loop had confirmed them. They were therefore now in a very ill temper, and &s;hewed their indigna|tion without much re&s;traint. It is no wonder, in &s;uch an agitation of temper, that many outrages were com|mitted. When the exci&s;e was at fir&s;t put in execution in Scotland, there were as great tumults at Gla&s;gow as there were on this occa&s;ion at Bo&s;ton. When the pa&s;&s;ions of men are overheated, it is not ea&s;y to make them li&s;ten to cool rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>While matters were in this unhappy &s;ituation, two regiments were ordered from Ireland, and &s;ome de|tachments from Halifax in Nova Scotia, to &s;upport the civil government. This threw the whole town of Bo&s;ton into con&s;ternation, and rai&s;ed great commo|tions: it was con&s;idered in the light of an inva&s;ion, and animadverted upon in the &s;evere&s;t terms. A meeting of the inhabitants was called to a&s;&s;emble at Faneuil-hall to con&s;ider what was to be done in that extremity, when they cho&s;e one of their late popu|lar repre&s;entatives as moderator. They then appoint|ed a committee to wait on the governor, to know what rea&s;ons he had for &s;ome late intimations he had gi|ven, that &s;ome regiments of his Maje&s;ty's forces were expected in that town, and to pre&s;ent a petition, to de|&s;ire that he would i&s;&s;ue precepts to convene and a&s;|&s;emble
<PB N="163" REF="168" MS="Y">with the greate&s;t &s;peed; to both which a$ immediate an&s;wer was required. The governor an|&s;wered, that his information was of a private nature, and that he could do nothing as to the calling of ano|ther a&s;&s;embly for this year, until he received his Ma|je&s;ty's in&s;tructions, under who&s;e con&s;ideration it now was. A committee had al&s;o been appointed to con|&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of their affairs, which gave in their report, a long declaration and recital of their rights, and the violation of them, which they conceiv|ed had been lately made; and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;udden re&s;olutions, particularly with re&s;pect to the legality of rai&s;ing or keeping up a &s;tanding army among them, without their con&s;ent. This re&s;olution they found|ed upon an act of the fir&s;t of King William, which declares it to be contrary to law to keep an army in the kingdom in the time of peace, without the con|&s;ent of parliament. This report and the re&s;olutions were unaimou&s;ly agreed to by the a&s;&s;embly, and a ge|neral re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed, which was al&s;o founded upon a clau&s;e in the &s;ame law, which recommends the fre|quent holding of parliaments. Upon this a conven|tion was called to a&s;&s;emble at Bo&s;ton. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, the four members who had repre|&s;ented the town in the late a&s;&s;embly, were now ap|pointed a committee to act for it in the convention; and the &s;elect men were ordered to write to all the o|ther towns in the province, to propo&s;e their appoint|ing committees for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The&s;e proceed|ings of the coloni&s;ts were con&s;idered as illegal and unlawful a&s;&s;emblies, and according to the ideas of the governor, they undoubtedly were &s;uch. It would appear that both Governor Bernard and the mini|&s;try at home, did not con&s;ider the coloni&s;ts as having the &s;ame benefit of the laws as the people in the mo|ther
<PB N="164" REF="169">country, though they reckoned them bound by them in their fulle&s;t extent. For if they had con&s;i|dered the coloni&s;ts as having the privilege of other &s;ubjects, they would not have quartered troops upon them in the time of peace, without an act of legi&s;lature in which they were repre&s;ented. But they &s;eem to have had in idea, a di&s;tinction between a Briti&s;h freeman and a coloni&s;t, which the latter did not admit.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts judged, that from the law made in the reign of King William, they had a right to their a&s;&s;em|blies, which they con&s;idered as their parliaments, and without their con&s;ent, it was illegal to keep up a &s;tand|ing army among them: the mini&s;try con&s;idered them as emigrants that had left their country, but were bound by its laws, without enjoying the privileges that aro&s;e from them, and unle&s;s they had this idea, their conduct will appear ridiculous: but all the advocates for the mother country's &s;upremacy, have founded their arguments upon the di&s;tinction between a free Briton and a coloni&s;t. Whether this di&s;tinction is founded in nature and rea&s;on, I &s;hall leave to the reader to deter|mine as he thinks be&s;t.</P>
<P>There is one piece of duplicity in the conduct of this town meeting, which cannot be vindicated, which &s;hews their addre&s;s more than their hone&s;ty, and it is this: they made a requi&s;ition to the inhabitants, that as there was a prevailing apprehen&s;ion in the minds of many, of a war with France, they &s;hould ac|cordingly be provided with arms, ammunition, and o|ther accoutrements, &s;o as to be prepared in ca&s;e of &s;udden danger. After this, a day of public prayer and fa&s;ting was appointed, and the meeting di&s;&s;olved. It is manife&s;t that a war with France, was a mere pre|tence, to carry forward a &s;cheme, to have the inhabi|tants provided again&s;t another evil than a French war.
<PB N="165" REF="170">Though the a&s;&s;embly at Bo&s;ton might have good rea|&s;ons for de&s;iring the inhabitants to have arms in rea|dine&s;s, they ought not to have a&s;&s;igned fal&s;e ones be|fore the appointing of a fa&s;t: for this was certainly an act of vile hypocri&s;y, which no good man can ap|prove.</P>
<P>The circular letter of the &s;elect men, was written in the &s;ame &s;tile, and with the &s;ame temper as their acts and re&s;olutions which were inclo&s;ed, and on which it was founded. In this time of general commotion, ninety-&s;ix towns appointed committees to attend the convention; but the town of Hatfield refu&s;ed to com|ply with the mea&s;ure, and gave their rea&s;ons in a let|ter, by way of an&s;wer, which was written with much temper, and &s;et forth very plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for their refu&s;ing to join with the re&s;t. It is plain from this an&s;wer, that they either had different ideas from the re&s;t of their brethren, or were lukewarm in the cau&s;e of liberty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have fully con&s;idered your propo&s;al of a convention, and the rea&s;ons you are plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign for it, and hereby take the liberty to expre&s;s our &s;entiments. We are not &s;en&s;ible that the &s;tate of Ame|rica is &s;o alarming, or the &s;tate of this province &s;o materially different from what they were a few months &s;ince, as to render the mea&s;ure you propo&s;e either &s;alutary or nece&s;&s;ary. The act of parliament, for rai&s;ing a revenue, &s;o much complained of, has been in being and carrying into execution for a con&s;iderable time pa&s;t, and proper &s;teps taken by &s;eve|ral governments on this continent to obtain redre&s;s of that grievance; and humble petitions by them, or|dered to be pre&s;ented to his Maje|&s;ty, we tru&s;t, have already, or &s;oon will reach the royal ear, be graci|ou&s;ly received, and favourably an|&s;wered; and the petition from the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of this pro|vince the la&s;t year among the re&s;t: if it &s;hould not, for want of an a|gent from this province, at the court of Great Britain to pre&s;ent it, we pre&s;ume you very well know, if it be an impolitic and imprudent ommi&s;&s;ion, where to lay the blame, and we apprehend that nothing that can or will be done by your propo&s;ed convention can or will aid the petition.
<P>And here we beg leave to &s;ay, that we judge that it would be much for the intere&s;t of this province to have an agent at this critical day: a per&s;on that would have &s;erved us faithfully, we make no doubt, might have been found; but the rea&s;ons given, and the methods we hear have been taking, to prevent it, are di&s;&s;atisfactory, and give us much unea&s;ine&s;s. We are further informed, that all matters of a pub|lic and private nature lying before the la&s;t general court were fully con&s;idered and acted upon, and all then propo&s;ed to be done, and fini&s;h|ed before the adjournment, except the impeachment of his Maje&s;ty's repre&s;entative, which perhaps might not have been agreed to, had they &s;at longer, or not been afterwards di&s;&s;olved. We are &s;orry for that circum&s;tance that occa&s;ioned &s;o early a di&s;&s;olution of the general court; though we mu&s;t own that the governor, by charter, is ve&s;ted with that power; yet we wi&s;h, if he had judged it con&s;i&s;tent with his duty to the King, it had been as u&s;ual; however, we hope ano|ther will be &s;oon called, or at far|the&s;t, on the la&s;t Wedne&s;day in May next,&mdash;and that in the mean time, the public affairs of the province will not greatly &s;uffer.</P>
<P>And here we propo&s;e to your con&s;ideration, whether the circular letter, which gave &s;uch umbrage, containing the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, or o|thers of the like import, 'that the King and parliament, by the late revenue act, had infringed the rights of the colonies, impo&s;ed an inequitable tax, and things yet wor&s;e might be expected from the inde|pendence and unlimited appoint|ments of crown officers therein mentioned, was &s;o perfectly inno|cent, and entirely con&s;i&s;tent with that duty and loyalty profe&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives the la&s;t year, in their petition to his Ma|je&s;ty; and whether the la&s;t hou&s;e might not have complied with his Maje&s;ty's requi&s;ition, with a full &s;aving of all their rights and prive|leges, and thereby prevented our being de&s;titute of a general court at this day. We cannot comprehend what pretence there can be of a propo&s;ed convention, unle&s;s the probability for a con&s;iderable num|ber of regular troops being &s;ent in|to this province, and an apprehen|&s;ion of their being quartered, part in your town, and part at the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>&mdash; And here we would ob&s;erve, that it was a matter of doubt and un|certainty, whether any were co|ming or not; if otherwi&s;e, for what purpo&s;e the King was &s;ending them, whether for your defence, in ca&s;e of a French war (as you tell us there is in the minds of many a prevailing apprehen&s;ion of one ap|proaching) and, if we don't mi&s;|under&s;tand your letter, induced them to pa&s;s the votes tran&s;mitted to us). or whether they are de&s;ti|ned for the protection of the new-acquired territories, is altogether uncertain: that they are to be a &s;tanding army in time of peace, you give us no evidence; and if your apprehen&s;ions are well grounded, it is not even &s;uppo&s;eable they are intended as &s;uch.&mdash;and if your town meant &s;incerely, we can't &s;ee the need they had of interpo&s;ing in mi|litary matters, in an unprecedented way, reque&s;ting their inhabitants to be provided with arms, &amp;c. (a matter till now always &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to another department), e&s;|pecially as they mu&s;t know &s;uch a number of troops would be a much better defence, in ca&s;e of war, than they had heretofore been favoured with: To &s;uppo&s;e what you &s;ur|mize they may be intended for, is to mi&s;tru&s;t the King's paternal care and goodne&s;s; &mdash; if, by any &s;udden excur&s;ions or in&s;urrections of &s;ome incon&s;iderate people, the King has been induced to think them a ne|ce&s;&s;ary check upon you, we hope you will, by your loyalty and quiet behaviour, &s;oon convince his Ma|je&s;ty, and the world, they are not longer nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e, that thereupon they will be with|drawn, and your town and the pro|vince &s;aved any farther trouble and expence from that quarter. We are &s;en&s;ible the colonies labour under many difficulties, and we greatly fear what the con&s;equence of the di&s;putes with our mother country will prove, however, we are far from thinking the mea&s;ures you are pur&s;uing have any tendency to deliver the good people of this pro|vince, but on the contrary, im|merge them in greater;&mdash;after all, we &s;hould hope, (were it not for your pre&s;ent attempt, attended with a bad complexion), we might &s;oon have deliverance from our pre&s;ent troubles, and things re&s;tor|ed as at the fir&s;t. The govern|ments have, in our opinion, con|&s;ulted, and are pur&s;uing, the pro|pere&s;t methods to obtain redre&s;s of their grievances; our duty is to wait with patience the event, un|le&s;s we are determined to take the alternative. How far pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;appointment and private re&s;ent|ment may influence any to hurry their neighbours into &s;uch mad and de&s;perate mea&s;ures, we don't know, but pray God prevent. Suf|fer us to ob&s;erve, that in our opi|nion, the mea&s;ures the town of Bo&s;ton are pur&s;uing, and propo|&s;ing to us and the people of this province to unite in, are uncon&s;ti|tutional, illegal, and wholly unju|&s;tifiable, and what will give the e|nemies of our con&s;titution the great|e&s;t joy, &s;ubver&s;ive of government, de&s;tructive of that peace and good order which is the cement of &s;ocie|ty, and have a direct tendency to rivet our chains, and deprive us of our rights and privileges, which we, the inhabitants of this town de&s;ire may be &s;ecured to us, and perpe|tuated to our late&s;t po&s;terity. Thus we have freely expre&s;&s;ed our &s;enti|ments, having an equal right with others, though a le&s;&s;er part of the community, and take this fir&s;t opportunity to prote&s;t again&s;t the propo&s;ed convention,&mdash;and here|by declare our loyalty to his pre|&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and fidelity to our country; and that it is our firm re&s;olution, to the utmo&s;t of our power, to maintain and defend our rights in every prudent and rea&s;onable way, as far as is con|&s;i&s;tent with our duty to God and the king.</P>
<P>Oliver Pa$tridge, Town Clerk.</P></NOTE>. When the convention met, the fir&s;t thing they did, was to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to the governor, wherein they di&s;claim all authoritative or governmental acts: that they were cho&s;en by &s;everal towns, and came freely and voluntarily, at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the people, to con&s;ult and advi&s;e &s;uch mea&s;ures as may promote peace and good order in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation.
<PB N="166" REF="171">They then repeat the pre&s;ent grievances, complain that they are gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented in Great Britain, and pre&s;s the governor in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner to call an a&s;&s;embly, as the only means to guard again&s;t tho&s;e alarming dangers that threatened the total di&s;|truction of the colony. The governor admoni&s;hed them, as a friend to the province, and a well-wi&s;her to the individuals of it, to break up their a&s;&s;embly in&s;tant|ly, and to &s;eparate before they did any bu&s;ine&s;s: that he was willing to believe that the gentlemen who i&s;|&s;ued
<PB N="167" REF="172">the &s;ummons for this meeting, were not aware of the nature of the high offence they were commit|ting; and that tho&s;e who had obeyed them, had not con&s;idered the penalties they &s;hould incur, if they per|&s;i&s;ted to continue their &s;e&s;&s;ion. At pre&s;ent, ignorance of law, &s;ays he, may excu&s;e what is pa&s;t; a &s;tep farther will take away that plea. That a meeting of the de|puties of the towns, is an a&s;&s;embly of the repre&s;enta|tives of the people to all intents and purpo&s;es; and that calling it a committee of convention, will not al|ter
<PB N="168" REF="173">the nature of the thing. He added, that if they did not regard his admonition, he mu&s;t, as governor, a&s;&s;ert the prerogatives of the crown in a more public manner: that they may a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, he &s;poke from in&s;truction, the King was determined to maintain his entire &s;overeignty over that province, and who&s;o|ever &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in u&s;urping any of the rights of it, would repent of his ra&s;hne&s;s. This an&s;wer produced another me&s;&s;age, wherein they ju&s;tified this meeting, as being only an a&s;&s;emblage of private per&s;ons, and de&s;ired explanations as to the criminality with which their proceedings were charged. The governor re|fu&s;ed to receive that or any other me&s;&s;age from them, as it would be admitting them to be a legal a&s;&s;embly, which he would not by any means allow. The conven|tion then appointed a committee, who drew up a re|port, in terms of great moderation, which was ap|proved by the a&s;&s;embly. In this they a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;es of their meeting, and di&s;claim all pretence to any authority what&s;oever, and advi&s;e and recommend it to the people, to pay the greate&s;t deference to govern|ment, and to wait with patience the re&s;ult of his Ma|je&s;ty's wi&s;dom and clemency for a redre&s;s of their grievances. They at the &s;ame time declare for them|&s;elves,
<PB N="169" REF="174" MS="Y">that they will, in their &s;everal &s;tations, yield eve|ry po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the civil magi&s;trate, for the pre|&s;ervation of peace and order, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of riots and tumults. After they had prepared a repre|&s;entation of their conduct, and a detail of the late tran&s;|actions to be tran&s;mitted to their agent at London, they broke up. It appears plain from the whole of the&s;e proceedings, that Governor Bernard was at more pains to provoke the people, than to quiet their di&s;contents; for had he behaved with more mildne&s;s, and &s;hewed le&s;s authority, he would have had more reverence paid him. His opinion concerning the le|gality of their meeting &s;eems frivolous and un&s;atisfac|tory; for though the convention was cho&s;en by the people, yet as they attempted to perform no public act, but met for advice, they could be con&s;idered in no other light, the repre&s;entatives of the people, than as their commi&s;&s;ioners, to meet with their friends, to con&s;ult what was for their common good. They determined nothing, nor proceeded to any acts of au|thority, and could be con&s;idered as no more than a club met to advi&s;e with one another. The governor's threatenings were therefore puerile and whim&s;ical, rather &s;hewing what he was di&s;po&s;ed to do, than what he could lawfully do. If the one half of the members of the Hou&s;e of Commons were to meet in an a&s;&s;em|bly, to advi&s;e with one another, without proceeding to any acts of power, they certainly could not come under any legal cen&s;ure. Till once there be a &s;tatute again&s;t all clubs and meetings of gentlemen, it is im|po&s;&s;ible that the governor's opinion can be well found|ed. But the truth of the matter &s;eems to have been, the governor and the a&s;&s;embly were at variance, and they had no confidence in one another. It is highly probable, had there been a popular governor in Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts
<PB N="170" REF="175">Bay, and in &s;ome other colonies, the ruin|ous war that has exhau&s;ted the empire had been yet to begin. When jealou&s;ies are once rai&s;ed, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to know where they may end. On September 29th, the very day that the convention broke up, the fleet from Halifax with two regiments, and a de|tachment of artillery, arrived in the harbour. There were &s;ome di&s;putes at fir&s;t concerning quartering the &s;oldiers; the council refu&s;ed to quarter them in the town, as the barracks of Ca&s;tle William were &s;uffi|cient to receive them; this was at la&s;t got over, by providing quarters, which were then to be con&s;idered as barracks, and the council upon that footing, allow|ed them barrack provi&s;ion. Soon after General Gage arrived, as did the two regiments from Ireland. A tolerable harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time between the people and the troops, and both the town and pro|vince continued for a &s;ea&s;on very quiet.</P>
<P>There was at this time two things which greatly a|larmed the friends of liberty and of the con&s;titution: the re&s;training bill, which confined the Ea&s;t India Company in making dividends to a certain &s;um; and a revival of the <HI>nullum tempus</HI> law, in the ca&s;e of the Duke of Portland. Both the&s;e proceedings had &s;uch an arbitrary appearance in the view of the people at home, that many concluded that the maxims of op|pre&s;&s;ion, practi&s;ed in the reign of the Stewarts, were going to be revived. The&s;e, together with the pro|ceedings concerning the colonies, created a jealou&s;y in the nation, that their repre&s;entatives, who were tru&s;ted with their principal concerns, were going to betray their intere&s;ts into the hands of the mini&s;try. The zealous debates upon the Ea&s;t India re&s;training bill had warmed the parties in parliament to an un|u&s;ual degree; and the controver&s;y in the nation con|cerning
<PB N="171" REF="176">Mr Wilkes, and his election as member for the county of Middle&s;ex, added much to the irrita|tion of parties. The misfortune which happened in St George's Fields contributed much to inflame the minds of the people. The proceedings at law again&s;t the per&s;ons who were charged with the crime of mur|der, were rather offen&s;ive than &s;atisfactory; and the e&s;cape of one of the offenders, who was charged with the crime, added to the offence. It was alleged that he had made his e&s;cape by connivance, if not by command; and that the acquittal of another had hap|pened, in con&s;equence of his e&s;cape, and by a ma|nagement very unfair and di&s;ingenuous. The parties at home were on this occa&s;ion much in the &s;ame tem|per with the Americans and Governor Bernard; in|&s;tead of making allowances for one another's infirmi|ties, they did all in their power to add to their vexa|tion. The mini&s;try, in&s;tead of &s;triving to &s;often the people, by kind or &s;mooth words, took every &s;tep, as if by de&s;ign, to di&s;oblige them, and heighten their re|&s;entment. One of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, in a letter recommended, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to the magi|&s;trates, an early u&s;e of military power, and the &s;ecreta|ry at war thanked the &s;oldiers for their &s;ervice in St George's fields, and promi&s;ed them protection. This promi&s;e was attended with pecuniary rewards given publicly, which greatly incen&s;ed the populace, and rai&s;ed their indignation to a degree of fury and mad|ne&s;s. This conduct of the mini&s;try was con&s;idered as a wanton violation of the people's liberties, and a cruel in&s;ult over their di&s;tre&s;s, for the lo&s;s of their friends, who had been killed by the &s;oldiers. And indeed the &s;ecretary might have behaved more prudently, provided he meant to conciliate the affections of the people to the government. There appeared &s;omething of wanton|ne&s;s
<PB N="172" REF="177">and &s;everity in the &s;tile of tho&s;e letters, which good policy and a proper degree of prudence, might have re&s;trained; for though the rioters were fooli&s;h and outrageous, they were yet his Maje&s;ty's political children, and when they were killed, it made the num|ber of his &s;ubjects le&s;s, which, in&s;tead of being mat|ter of exultation, was rather matter of &s;orrow and concern.</P>
<P>The tempers of the people, which by proper lenient mea&s;ures, might have &s;ub&s;ided, was kept up by many inflammatory publications and di&s;cour&s;es, which though they contained &s;everal truths, and ju&s;t argu|ment, were written without temper or charity. E|very part of that late tran&s;action was repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t colours, and placed in the mo&s;t dread|ful attitudes; and it was repre&s;ented as if the military power that was kept up for the defence of the peo|ple, had been perverted to their de&s;truction; and an enraged &s;oldiery already flu&s;hed in the &s;laughter of their countrymen, was to be encouraged by rewards to further blood&s;hed, and to be freed from every terror of the law.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try did all in their power to &s;tem this po|pular torrent, by painting in the mo&s;t &s;triking colours, the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the people; and that contempt of all government which rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to ap|ply violent remedies to a violent di&s;temper. They &s;tated the unhappy di&s;po&s;ition of the people to be &s;uch, that juries, under the general infatuation, could hardly be obtained to do ju&s;tice to &s;oldiers under pro|&s;ecution, unle&s;s government interpo&s;ed in the mo&s;t ef|fectual manner, in the protection of tho&s;e who had acted under their command. They &s;aid that &s;uch was the in&s;olence of the populace, and the danger of the contagion becoming by degrees prevalent, even a|mong
<PB N="173" REF="178">the &s;oldiers, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep them &s;teady to their duty, by new and unu&s;ual rewards. The&s;e rea&s;ons had but little weight with the public, who were well per&s;uaded that tho&s;e who made the greate&s;t outcry again&s;t licentiou&s;ne&s;s, had them&s;elves &s;et the example, and were in tho&s;e departments of life in which they acted, as licentious as that rabble which they had painted in the blacke&s;t colours. The vulgar, though they have not &s;uch a ta&s;te for refine|ment in &s;peculations as people bred about courts, yet have as much common &s;en&s;e as to under&s;tand, that &s;uch as want to re&s;train licentiou&s;ne&s;s, ought them|&s;elves to ob&s;erve the moral law. There is no manner of que&s;tion that the arguments of the mini&s;try were very ju&s;t; for in no age have the people been more loo&s;e and di&s;&s;olute than the pre&s;ent, but the&s;e argu|ments, like a dilemma, look more ways than one; they turn upwards as well as downwards, and may be appli|ed to per&s;ons in high rank, as well as to the rabble. The be&s;t method for the ruling powers to re&s;train vice, immorality, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, is to &s;hew a good example, and promote the be&s;t laws for good educa|tion: that the rudiments of virtue may be early plant|ed in the minds of men, and tutored to the be&s;t ad|vantage. People in the low walks of life in general look up to tho&s;e above them, by who&s;e example they are very much influenced; and it will be impo&s;&s;ible to have the common people virtuous till they be led by imitation of tho&s;e above them. When men, whom they know to be as vicious as them&s;elves, puni&s;h and correct them, they will con&s;ider the exerci&s;e of that power, to proceed, not from a regard to the law, but from de&s;ire of dominion.</P>
<P>Whatever force might be in the arguments, made u&s;e of in defence of the mini&s;try, one thing is certain,
<PB N="174" REF="179">they grew more and more unpopular every day, and &s;ome political incidents happened about this time, which le&s;&s;ened them &s;till more in the opinion of the public. Among the&s;e, was the removal of General Amher&s;t from the government of Virginia. The go|vernment of that province had for half a century been con&s;idered as a &s;inecure, and the bu&s;ine&s;s done by a deputy, and was avowedly be&s;towed upon the gene|ral in that &s;en&s;e, as a reward of his former &s;ervices, and a te&s;timony of approbation of his particular good conduct in America. The removal of a per&s;on who had done &s;uch &s;ervices for the public, became a &s;ub|ject of general di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and was cen&s;ured with great &s;everity; nor did the arguments that were u&s;ed in &s;upport of that mea&s;ure remove, but confirm the pre|judices of the people. Under a load of popular odium, and many ju&s;t cen&s;ures, the mini&s;try &s;till kept their &s;tations, contrary to the expectation of almo&s;t the whole nation.</P>
<P>Lord Chatham, who was regarded as the projector and founder of this mini&s;try, being almo&s;t continually ab&s;ent through bodily infirmity, lo&s;t his influence in the cabinet, which was not perceived till his friend Sir Jeffrey Amher&s;t was removed from his government. Then it was perceived that the mea&s;ures of the mini|&s;try were not directed by his advice. Soon after the removal of the general, Lord Shelburne re&s;igned his office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and was &s;ucceeded by Lord Weymouth, for the northern department, and about the &s;ame time Lord Chatham re&s;igned his place as keeper of the privy &s;eal, and was &s;ucceeded by the Earl of Bri&s;tol, to the great &s;urpri&s;e of the whole na|tion. The Earl was an intimate friend of Lord Cha|tham, which made this change appear &s;omewhat ex|traordinary. This change happened in the month of
<PB N="175" REF="180">October, and the the parliament a&s;&s;embled Novem|ber the eight.</P>
<P>When the national &s;enate met, the nation was full of expectation that mea&s;ures would be fallen upon to quiet the minds of the people, con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of the crown, and the laws of the land. The &s;peech from the throne &s;oon di&s;appointed the&s;e hopes and expectations: In&s;tead of any lenient mea&s;ures to &s;ettle the di&s;quieted minds of the nation, the &s;peech contained &s;evere reflections again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, par|ticularly the people of Bo&s;ton were declared to be in a &s;tate of di&s;obedience to all law and government, and to have proceeded to mea&s;ures &s;ubver&s;ive of the con|&s;titution, and attended with circum&s;tances that mani|fe&s;ted a di&s;po&s;ition to throw off their dependence on Great Britain. The addre&s;s to the &s;overeign for this &s;peech, plainly &s;hewed what the colonies had to ex|pect from both the King and parliament. They de|clared, that though they were ready to redre&s;s the grievances of the colonies, and to hear their com|plaints, they were neverthele&s;s determined to &s;upport the &s;upremacy of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature over every part of the Briti&s;h empire. In this &s;ituation were mat|ters when the parliament met.</P>

<P>THE hopes of the nation were now anxiou&s;ly fix|ed upon the new parliament, and it was earne&s;tly ex|pected that &s;ome healing mea&s;ures would be pur&s;ued to &s;ettle the di&s;turbances in the colonies, and quiet the minds of the people at home. The&s;e earne&s;t hopes of the nation were con&s;iderably damped by the &s;peech from the throne, which rather breathed &s;entiments of &s;everity, than that mildne&s;s and clemency, which was thought nece&s;&s;ary to heal the pre&s;ent de&s;tempers. The friends of peace and humanity did not however de&s;pair, but that the great council of the nation, when a&s;&s;embled, would in &s;ome period of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;o moderate matters, that the effects of the &s;evere &s;peech from the throne would be mitigated by the wi&s;e coun|&s;els of parliament. From the cen&s;ures pa&s;&s;ed upon &s;ome of the colonies in the King's &s;peech, it was ea&s;y to perceive what were the intentions of the mini&s;try, and what mea&s;ures would be pur&s;ued, provided a ma|jority in parliament gave &s;anction to their de&s;igns. The whole Briti&s;h empire was deeply intere&s;ted in
<PB N="177" REF="182">the i&s;&s;ue of this bu&s;ine&s;s, and waited with eager ex|pectation, the re&s;ult of parliamentary determination. There were at this time two parties who were equal|ly agitated with concern for the i&s;&s;ue of this bu&s;ine&s;s; and the&s;e were &s;uch as wanted to have the &s;upreme authority of parliament exerted to its utmo&s;t extent; who were highly di&s;plea&s;ed at the behaviour of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony, and thought that a &s;evere check ought to be given to the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of that pro|vince. The others who were equally anxious in this affair were tho&s;e who were lovers of con&s;titutional liberty, as well, naturally di&s;po&s;ed to moderation and lenient mea&s;ures; the&s;e were greatly alarmed, at the &s;ignatures of vigour, they perceived in the &s;peech, and the danger that would follow in ca&s;e of carrying mat|ters to extremity.</P>
<P>A committee of the whole hou&s;e had been formed early in the &s;e&s;&s;ions, for the purpo&s;e of an enquiry in|to American affairs. This was a mea&s;ure that the different parties in parliament were equally anxious in pur&s;uing: but the motives by which they were in|fluenced were very different, and the methods of pur|&s;uing their enquiry very oppo&s;ite to each other. The party on the &s;ide of the mini&s;try confined their views to tho&s;e recent tran&s;actions which were mo&s;t offen&s;ive, and &s;eemed more immediately to call for interpo&s;ing the authority of parliament; which were judged by the mo&s;t &s;anguine, highly worthy of a &s;evere cen&s;ure, as a violation of all order and government. On the other &s;ide, it was propo&s;ed to enquire into the &s;ources and &s;prings of tho&s;e di&s;orders, and to take a retro&s;pective view of the conduct of government towards the colo|nies, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, and if po&s;&s;ible, to cure the di&s;temper, by removing the cau&s;es thereof. This was a work not &s;o ea&s;ily performed, when tho&s;e who
<PB N="178" REF="183">were judged the original cau&s;es of tho&s;e evils, conti|nued to operate again&s;t all enquiries, by which their own conduct might have been laid open.</P>
<P>Before the Chri&s;tmas rece&s;s, an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt had been made, to have copies of all the royal letters patent, charters, and commi&s;&s;ions, now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and in force, relative to any of the American colonies, with copies of all in&s;tructions which had been given by, or in the name of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, to any of|ficer civil or military, laid before the Hou&s;e. The&s;e papers, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, would not only have led to a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the rights of the colonies, but al&s;o to a clo&s;e enquiry into the conduct of &s;ome governors, and other officers of the crown, as well as into the proprie|ty of the orders that had at different times been &s;ent to them from home. Nothing could be more rea&s;on|able than a reque&s;t of this &s;ort; it could injure none, except &s;uch as de&s;erved cen&s;ure, which could not be accounted injury but ju&s;tice, and it would have been the mo&s;t effectual method to have prevented gover|nors at a great di&s;tance from the centre of power, a|bu&s;ing their authority, in provoking the &s;ubjects to outrage by an arbitrary behaviour. The granting of this reque&s;t would al&s;o have removed all &s;u&s;picions concerning government, and would have al&s;o con|firmed the national confidence towards the mini&s;try. Admini&s;tration had at this time adopted other mea|&s;ures than what were agreeable to the nation, and were not di&s;po&s;ed to give any &s;atisfaction concerning their own conduct; they therefore oppo&s;ed this mo|tion, and prevented its &s;ucce&s;s. They imagined that the dignity of government might &s;uffer from &s;uch an enquiry, and were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport imaginary ho|nor, at the expence of general utility. A va&s;t num|ber of other papers, were however laid before the
<PB N="179" REF="184">committee, and &s;everal re&s;olutions formed thereon, together with an addre&s;s upon the &s;ame fubject, which came from the Hou&s;e of Lords, but after long debate, the mini&s;try carried their point and the enquiry came to nothing. In this, as in &s;everal other things this new parliament di&s;appointed the hopes of the na|tion.</P>
<P>Upon January the 25th, 1769, while the&s;e debates were going on, a petition, in the name of the majori|ty of the council of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, &s;igned by Mr Danforth, as pre&s;ident of the council, was pre&s;ented to the Commons. It appeared that this petition want|ed &s;ome formalities, nece&s;&s;ary for procuring it admi&s;|&s;ion into the Hou&s;e. It was &s;aid that it had not pa&s;|&s;ed in a legal a&s;&s;embly of the council, and of con&s;e|quence, no per&s;on could be authori&s;ed to &s;ign it as pre&s;ident. It was rejected under that title, and or|dered to be brought in only as the petition of Samuel Danforth, in behalf of the &s;everal individuals, mem|bers of the council, at who&s;e reque&s;t it had been &s;ign|ed. It was evident from this proceeding of the Com|mons, that the majority were di&s;po&s;ed to come to no terms with the coloni&s;ts, and that government intend|ed to make them &s;ubmit to the ab&s;olute authority of the mother country. This petition was &s;o far from being written in an offen&s;ive &s;tile, that no petition could have been expre&s;&s;ed in milder terms, nor writ|ten with more moderation. It prayed for a repeal of the late revenue acts, and enlarged upon the chartered immunities, and privileges of the colonies. The ge|neral rights of the coloni&s;ts, as Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, were &s;et forth, without mentioning the &s;upremacy of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, or calling it in que&s;tion, although this was al&s;o touched in a gentle manner, by a&s;&s;erting that their rights had been violated, and reque&s;ting
<PB N="180" REF="185">that in time coming they might be &s;ecured. The in|ability of the colony to addre&s;s the Hou&s;e in their le|gi&s;lative capacity, was regreted, and a particular de|tail of the difficulties, hard&s;hips, and dangers which their ance&s;tors endured; who, for pre&s;erving their ci|vil and religious liberties, had made &s;ettlements in a wilderne&s;s, where they were expo&s;ed to the rage of the mo&s;t eruel and &s;avage enemies; where, from the nature of the climate, and the infertility of the &s;oil, no advantage to their temporal intere&s;ts was even to be hoped for; and the utmo&s;t that could be expected, was only a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in con&s;equence of the mo&s;t unremitted labour. From the&s;e premi&s;&s;es, it was inferred that they not only dearly purcha&s;ed their &s;ettlements, but acquired an additional title, be&s;ides their common claim, as men and as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, to the immunities and privileges which they a&s;&s;erted had been granted to them by charter. Many argu|ments were u&s;ed by their friends in behalf of the pe|tition. Their ready and willing &s;ervices at their own expence in our wars; the old colonies having been all e&s;tabli&s;hed without any expence to the mother coun|try; the great advantages &s;he derives from them; the &s;hare they virtually bear in our taxes, by the con&s;ump|tion of our manufactures; their inability to pay the duties, and the bad con&s;equences refulting from the late laws, not only to them, but to the mother coun|try, were brought as arguments to &s;olicit the repeal, and to &s;hew the title they had, not only to a &s;ecurity of their righs, but even to favour.</P>
<P>Admini&s;tration finding that they had a majority in parliament, was now determined effectually to humble the refractory colonies. The hou&s;e of Lords, upon the 8th of February, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome re&s;olutions, and an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, which were &s;ent down to the
<PB N="181" REF="186">Commons, and approved, and &s;o became the act of both Hou&s;es, wherein the late acts of the Hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, which called in que&s;tion the authority of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, to make laws to bind the colonies in all ca&s;es whatever, were re&s;cinded, and declared illegal, uncon&s;titutional, and derogatory of the rights of the crown and parlia|ment of Great Britain. The circular letters written by the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly to the other colonies, requiring them to join in petitions, and &s;tating the late laws as infringments of the rights of the people in the colonies, were declared to be proceedings of a mo&s;t unwarrant|able and dangerous nature, circulated to inflame the minds of the people in the colonies, and tending to create unlawful combinatians, repugnant to the laws of Great Britain, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution. The town of Bo&s;ton was declared in a &s;tate of great di&s;order and confu&s;ion, di&s;turbed by riots and tumults of a dan|gerous nature, in which the officers of the revenue had been ob&s;tructed by violence in the execution of the laws, and their lives endangered: that neither the council of the province nor the civil magi&s;trates had exerted their authority in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;aid riots and tumults: that in the&s;e circum&s;tances of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, and of the town of Bo&s;ton, the pre&s;ervation of the public peace, and the due execution of the laws, became impracticable, with|out the aid of a military force, to &s;upport and protect the civil magi&s;trate, and the officers of his Maje&s;ty's revenue. That the re&s;olutions, and proceedings in the town meetings at Bo&s;ton, on the 14th of June, and the 12th of September, 1769, were illegal and uncon&s;titutional, and calculated to excite &s;edition and in&s;urrection: that the appointment of the town meet|ing upon the 12th of September, of a convention to be
<PB N="182" REF="187">held in the town of Bo&s;ton, on the 22d of that month, to con&s;i&s;t of deputies from the &s;everal towns and di&s;|tricts in the province, and the writing of a letter by the &s;elect men in each of the &s;aid towns, and di&s;tincts, for the election of &s;uch deputies were proceedings &s;ubver&s;ive of government, and evidently manife&s;ting a de&s;ign in the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, to &s;et up a new uncon&s;titutional authority independent of the crown. The&s;e re&s;olutions were founded upon an interpreta|tion of the meaning of the proceedings at Bo&s;ton, which the people of that province denied that they ever intended; they declared the de&s;ign of their meet|ing was to advi&s;e with one another in petitioning the King and parliament for the redre&s;s of grievances, but to perform no governmental acts: and they al&s;o promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the civil magi&s;trate in the execution of the laws, as far as it was in their power. The re|&s;olutions of the two Hou&s;es at this time appear to have been formed upon the information of Governor Bernard, between whom and the province there was no good under&s;tanding, and who by this time had wrought each other to a degree of uncommon oppo|&s;ition and enmity. Tho&s;e who have no other object in view except truth, will ea&s;ily perceive, that the am|bition and pride of the governor had as great an in|fluence in tho&s;e di&s;orders, as the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the people. According to the hi&s;tory of the people of that colony, given by many that now accu&s;e them of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, they are, when compared with the peo|ple of this country, remarkably &s;ober; they ob&s;erved divine ordinances, and kept the Sabbath day with a &s;trictne&s;s, not to be found in Old England. And it has al&s;o been ob&s;erved by their enemies, that unle&s;s among tho&s;e who come from Britain to perform re|revenue duty, and are &s;ervants of the crown, the vices
<PB N="183" REF="188">that are common at home in England, are &s;eldom to be &s;een in that colony.&mdash;And indeed it &s;eldom hap|pens that a licentious and di&s;&s;ipated people will run any hazards for their rights and liberties: but in a controver&s;y there is always &s;omething to be &s;aid on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The addre&s;s that follows the above re&s;olutions, breathed the &s;ame &s;pirit, and run much in the &s;ame &s;tile. It expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction with the mea&s;ures that had been pur&s;ued, to &s;upport the con&s;titution, and to induce, in the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, a due obedience to the authority of the mother coun|try. A promi&s;e and re&s;olution was al&s;o made to con|cur effectually in &s;uch farther mea&s;ures as might be judged nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the civil magi&s;trates in a proper execution of the laws; and it was given as a matter of opinion, that nothing would &s;o effectually pre&s;erve royal authority in that province, as to bring the authors of the late unfortunate di&s;orders to ex|amplary puni&s;hment. Upon this per&s;ua&s;ion, it was earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, that Governor Bernard would tran&s;mit the fulle&s;t information he could obtain of all trea&s;ons, or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on committed within his government, &s;ince the 30th of December 1767, toge|ther with the names of the per&s;ons who were mo&s;t active in the committing of &s;uch offences: that his Maje&s;ty might i&s;&s;ue a &s;pecial proclamation for enqui|ring into, hearing and determining upon the guilt of the offenders within this realm, according to the pro|vi&s;ions of a &s;tatute made in the 30th year of Henry the eight, in ca&s;e his Maje&s;ty, upon Governor Ber|nard's report &s;hould &s;ee &s;ufficient ground for &s;uch a proceeding. This was an opinion very unfavourable to the colonies; it expo&s;ed them to two evils of the mo&s;t &s;evere kind: their character was to be taken
<PB N="184" REF="189">from the report of one man, who was their enemy, and they were to be tried in a &s;trange country, where they might have neither friends nor connections, and where they could not have the benefit of exculpatory evidence, unle&s;s at an expence, that very few people can afford, without reducing them&s;elves to mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e re&s;olutions and the addre&s;s were car|ried by a powerful majority, they were oppo&s;ed with great firmne&s;s, and force of argument, by the friends of the coloni&s;ts, and there had been few &s;ubjects for many years more ably di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, than this was through the whole of the debate. Both the right and propriety of taxing the coloni&s;ts, were warmly di&s;puted, and the arguments made u&s;e of, were much the &s;ame with tho&s;e that have been already mentioned in the ca&s;e of repealing the &s;tamp act, which, on this occa&s;ion, &s;hall not be repeated. Many new reflections were made on this occa&s;ion, which may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to con&s;ider. It was ob&s;erved that the new revenue laws did not an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed, but tended to irri|tate the coloni&s;ts, without being of any real &s;ervice to government: that as the act for &s;ecuring the obedi|ence of the colonies, an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es they could propo&s;e by any new mea&s;ure, it was ab&s;urd to multiply &s;tatutes, without &s;ufficient cau&s;e and rea&s;ons for &s;o doing: that by the mea&s;ures they were pur&s;uing, they would lay a tax upon the mother country: that the laying of duties upon Briti&s;h commodities and manufactures landed in the colonies, was in effect granting premiums, to excite the Americans to indu|&s;try, and to put them upon rai&s;ing the one, and rival|ling Britain in the other. What appeared remark|able on this occa&s;ion, the Rockingham and Grenville parties, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be irreconcileable, up|on
<PB N="185" REF="190">this &s;ubject, entirely united and joined their inte|re&s;ts, and made u&s;e of the &s;ame arguments. A reflec|tion was made by the oppo&s;ition, which, though it was very &s;evere, was at the &s;ame time very ju&s;t; name|ly, that it was now become the fa&s;hion with tho&s;e who had been the original cau&s;e of all the di&s;turban|ces in America, to repre&s;ent the people in that coun|try as in a &s;tate of rebellion, and by that &s;tratagem to make the cau&s;e of admini&s;tration the national cau&s;e, and to per&s;uade us that the people aggrieved by a &s;e|ries of blunders and mi&s;management, and embolden|ed by the weakne&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tency of government, had committed &s;ome ra&s;h actions, that they wanted al&s;o to throw off the authority of the mother coun|try. This was a mo&s;t &s;evere, but a true reflection; for from all accounts of the proceedings of the colo|ni&s;ts, it appears manife&s;t that mild treatment, and a little &s;oft management would have &s;ettled all the di&s;|turbances that have happened. It was urged that a number of duties had been laid upon the colonies, which derived their con&s;equence only from their odi|ou&s;ne&s;s, and the mi&s;chiefs they produced, and an ar|my of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers were &s;ent, as much to cre|ate as to rai&s;e new taxes, as they could &s;carcely an|&s;wer any other end, and were them&s;elves as odious as the taxes they were &s;ent to collect on account of their novelty, and &s;ome other circum&s;tances that attended them. Another reflection which bore hard upon the majority, was that &s;ome of them who had an hand in impo&s;ing the&s;e new duties, and were become the zeal|ous &s;upporters of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, were at the head of that opinion which denied totally the right of the legi&s;lature to tax America: that their names had been held up in the colonies as objects of the highe&s;t veneration, and their arguments were made the foun|dation,
<PB N="186" REF="191">of what ever was under&s;tood to be con&s;titu|tional writing or &s;peaking; was it then to be a mat|ter of wonder, that the Americans, with &s;uch authori|ties, to &s;upport their opinions, which were in the high|e&s;t degree flattering to their importance, &s;hould, in the warmth of their imagination, and the heat of their pa&s;|&s;ions, commit extravagances, upon ob&s;erving an imme|diate violation of what they had been taught to con|&s;ider as their mo&s;t undoubted and unalienable rights? Or was there any rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed, that &s;uch &s;trange and unaccountable contradictions, between language and behaviour, &s;hould produce the unhappy confequences which had now happened. This was <HI>argumentum ad hominem,</HI> and could not be an&s;wer|ed by tho&s;e to whom it was applied, without &s;hame and repentance.</P>
<P>That part of the addre&s;s which related to the &s;tatute of Henry the eight was more warmly di&s;puted, and &s;uch arguments were u&s;ed as the friends of admini&s;tration could not oppo&s;e with arguments of equal force. To bring delinquents from the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay, to be tri|ed at a tribunal in England, for crimes &s;uppo&s;ed to be committed in that country, was con&s;idered in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, contrary to the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution. It was &s;aid that a man charged with a crime is, by the laws of England, u&s;ually tried in the coun|ty where the offence is committed, that the circum|&s;tances of the crime may more clearly be con&s;idered and examined; and that the knowledge which the jury thereby receive of his general character, and of the credibility of the witne&s;&s;es might a&s;&s;i&s;t them in pronouncing, with a greater degree of certainty, up|on his innocence or guilt. That as the con&s;titution from a conviction of its utility, had &s;ecured that form of trial to every &s;ubject in England, with a colour of
<PB N="187" REF="192">ju&s;tice, can he be deprived of it, by going to Ameri|rica? Is a man's life fortune and happine&s;s, or his character of le&s;s e&s;teem in the eye of the law, there, than in this country? or are we to mete out different por|tions of ju&s;tice to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects which are to le&s;&s;en in degree, in proportion to their di&s;tance from the ca|pital? It was alledged, that if an American has tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the laws by committing a crime there, he ought to be tried there for the offence; but cannot ju&s;tly be torn above 3000 miles from his family and his friends, his bu&s;ine&s;s and connections; from every comfort and countenance, nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port a man under &s;uch trying and unhappy cir|cum&s;tances to be tried by a jury that are not his peers, who are probably prejudiced again&s;t him, and may think them&s;elves &s;ome way intere&s;ted in finding him guilty.</P>
<P>It was further urged, that it would be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, for the accu&s;ed per&s;on to bring over the nece&s;&s;ary evidence for his vindication, though he was entirely innocent: that it would require a man to be rich, and to have great &s;ub&s;tance to bring all the witne&s;&s;es that might be nece&s;&s;ary from Bo&s;ton to London, and that after all, &s;ome might be overlooked that might be of great &s;ervice, which could not be brought till the trial was over. That on the other &s;ide the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, &s;upported by the coun|tenance and protection of government, maintained at the national expence, and &s;ure of a compenfation for their lo&s;s of time, and perhaps having the hope of future reward and provi&s;ion, would not only be ea&s;ily collected, but that it was to be feared too many would think it good employment and become eager candi|dates for the &s;ervice. That in this &s;ituation the ca&s;e of the accu&s;ed would be very hard; charged with a crime again&s;t the authority of the mother country,
<PB N="188" REF="193">the judges who are to determine his fate, are the peo|ple again&s;t whom he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, tho&s;e who have con&s;tructed the act with which he is charged into a crime, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions might be heated and who are at the &s;ame time parties, accu&s;ers, and judges. The act upon which this trial was to proceed, it was affirmed was framed in an arbitrary and tyran|nical reign; and had ju&s;tly lain buried in oblivion, till now brought forth to an&s;wer a temporary and an ar|bitrary purpo&s;e. Many of the&s;e arguments were never an&s;wered, nor was any reply made, except by a vote, which is the mo&s;t powerful an&s;wer. The mi|ni&s;try were on this occa&s;ion unu&s;ually languid in the &s;upport of their re&s;olutions, and the addre&s;s which they had made for reviving the &s;tatute of Henry the VIII. for when they were a&s;ked which of them would own him&s;elf the advi&s;er of that mea&s;ure, they all de|clined to adopt it. It would appear that either their con&s;ciences condemned them, or that they felt the force of their opponent's arguments too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted. The arguments that were u&s;ed in behalf of the mea&s;ures that were now pur&s;uing are but &s;hort, and have but little force in them, but the reader in ju&s;tice &s;hall have them as they are.</P>
<P>It was affirmed, that the repeal of the &s;tamp act had not produced the effects that might have been expec|ted; that the coloni&s;ts in&s;tead of gratitude for the tenderne&s;s &s;hewn to their &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;tre&s;&s;es, had ob|&s;tinately pur&s;ued the &s;ame cour&s;e as before, and &s;hewed the &s;ame di&s;re&s;pect to government; that &s;uch was their licentious oppo&s;ition to all mea&s;ures of the legi&s;lature, that it became highly nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ame mark of their dependence upon the mother country. That the late duties &s;o much complained of, on account of the &s;mallne&s;s of their produce, were

That the inhabitants of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay were people of republican principles, and licentious in their di&s;po&s;i|tions, and being &s;tirred up by factious and de&s;igning men, had broken out into daring acts of outrage, and in&s;olence, which &s;ufficiently &s;hewed the original ne|ce&s;&s;ity of making them &s;en&s;ible of their dependence on the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature; that by their words and wri|tings they &s;eemed rather to con&s;ider them&s;elves as members of an independent &s;tate than as a colony and province belonging to this country. That from the ill formed &s;y&s;tem upon which the government of that colony had been originally e&s;tabli&s;hed; the council was appointed by the a&s;&s;embly, and the grand juries are elected by the town&s;hips; &s;o that the&s;e factious men having got a lead in the a&s;&s;embly, and being them&s;elves leaders of the popular phrenzy, guided and directed the whole civil government as they plea|&s;ed; &s;o that all ju&s;tice and order was at an end, where|ever their intere&s;ts or pa&s;&s;ions were concerned. That in the&s;e circum&s;tances the populace freed from all legal re&s;traints by the&s;e circum&s;tances, tho&s;e that &s;hould have been the con&s;ervators of the public peace, &s;et them&s;elves the fir&s;t examples of all kinds of di&s;or|ders, and proceeded at length to the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch acts, as if not now deemed downright rebellion, would in other times have been judged and puni&s;hed as &s;uch; and which in any con&s;truction of the term could be con&s;idered but very little &s;hort of it.

That the example &s;et by the town of Bo&s;ton, and the ra&s;h and daring mea&s;ure adopted by their a&s;&s;embly of &s;ending circular letters to the other colonies, had already produced a great effect; and if not checked was likely to &s;et the whole conti|nent in a flame, and for that rea&s;on &s;ome &s;hips of war and troops had been &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, who without blood&s;hed or coming to any violent mea&s;ures, had re|&s;tored order and quiet. That nothing but the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures could bring the coloni&s;ts to a pro|per &s;en&s;e of their duty, and of their dependence upon the &s;upreme legi&s;lature. That the &s;pirit which prevail|ed at Bo&s;ton was &s;o totally &s;ubver&s;ive of all order and civil government, and the conduct of the magi&s;trates had left &s;o little room for hope of their properly ful|filling their duty during the continuance of the pre|&s;ent ferment, that it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to revive and put in execution the law of Henry the VIII. by which the king is empowered to appoint a com|mi&s;&s;ion in England for the trial there, of any of his &s;ubjects in all parts of the world. That unle&s;s that mea&s;ure was adopted, the mo&s;t flagrant acts of trea|&s;on and rebellion might be committed openly in the provinces with impunity, as the civil power was nei|ther di&s;po&s;ed, nor could take cognizance of them. That the per&s;ons who were guilty of tho&s;e crimes, and who had already cau&s;ed &s;o much trouble and con|fu&s;ion, were no objects of compa&s;&s;ion, for any parti|cular circum&s;tances of expence or trouble that might attend this mode of bringing them to ju&s;tice, which was only to be con&s;idered as a &s;mall part of the puni&s;h|ment due to their crimes: that it was ungenerous to &s;uppo&s;e that government would make an improper u&s;e of this law by harra&s;&s;ing of innocent per&s;ons; and that there was no rea&s;on to que&s;tion the integrity of

The&s;e are the arguments upon the other &s;ide, which as they have little force in them&s;elves, have hitherto, in the execution produced none of tho&s;e effects which the authors promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Admini&s;tration &s;eem to have expected more confi|dence from the public, than their conduct for &s;ome years pa&s;t entitled them to, when they &s;ay it was un|generous to &s;uppo&s;e that they would make an impro|per u&s;e of their power in harra&s;&s;ing innocent per&s;ons, for their pa&s;t conduct gave all the rea&s;on in the world to &s;uppo&s;e that mercy and clemency were none of their characteri&s;tic virtues. And as they had refu&s;ed to admit an enquiry into the original cau&s;es of the di&s;orders in the colonies, there was good rea&s;on to conclude that impartiality would not be ob&s;erved in pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e who were the objects of their re&s;ent|ment. The coloni&s;ts had for &s;ome time been in a &s;tate of di&s;order, and many irregularities had been commit|ted, but there was a jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion that &s;ome mi&s;management in government had been the cau&s;e thereof; it was therefore unrea&s;onable to &s;eek to puni&s;h the petty delinquents, without taking notice of tho&s;e who had been the cau&s;e of all the&s;e evils. The con&s;titution of the government of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts colony, in granting that privilege to the town|&s;hips, the privilege of electing juries, and to the a&s;&s;em|bly, the liberty of appointing the council, had never produced any ill con&s;equences, till ambitious gover|nors wanted to dictate. to both councils and a&s;&s;em|blies; and then they found that the con&s;titution of the colony was a check upon their power, and re&s;train|ed
<PB N="192" REF="198">it within a certain limit. Tho&s;e who formerly had no other object in view than to rule for the good of the community, never con&s;idered this part of the con|&s;titution of the colony as any hard&s;hip: they &s;upport|ed their own legal dignity, and never wanted to en|croach upon the privileges of the people. But &s;ome late governors a&s;&s;umed power which their office did not give them, and when they could not rule the colony according to their arbitrary plea&s;ure, becau&s;e the go|vernment of the province did not allow them &s;o to do, they began to complain both of the form of govern|ment, and the conduct of the people, who did no more than it allowed them. It would have been no more than fair, to have made an enquiry into the conduct of government, that it might have appeared, whether the di&s;turbances had ari&s;en from maladmini&s;tration in the officers of the crown, or from the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the people. Had it appeared that the mini&s;try and governors had done their duty, it would have united all ranks in this kingdom again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, and added a &s;trength to admini&s;tration which would have enabled them to have pur&s;ued their mea&s;ures with more ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction. But when they refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to an enquiry, it confirmed the &s;u&s;picions of the public, that there were &s;omething done that could not bear a trial. The allu&s;ion to the times of the Stewarts, in the rea&s;oning of the majori|ty, and their keene&s;s for the revival of the &s;tatute of Henry the eight, encrea&s;ed the jealou&s;y of the colo|ni&s;ts, and aggravated the oppo&s;ition at home. Pre|cedents taken from arbitrary reigns, and tyrannical princes, had but an ill appearance, and were not rec|koned &s;uitable to the principles of the revolution, and the government of a prince of the Brun&s;wick line. The coloni&s;ts irritated already, by what was pa&s;t,
<PB N="193" REF="199">con&s;idered the&s;e new mea&s;ures, as contrivances of &s;tate to en&s;lave them; and they began to apprehend that government would proceed from one thing to another, till they reduced them to the &s;tate they were in before the revolution. What gave ri&s;e to the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, was the &s;imilarity of proceedings, and the influence that the friends of the ancient family were &s;uppo&s;ed to have in the Court of Britain; the&s;e ideas were confirmed by the e&s;&s;ays of party-writers in England, who, without confining them&s;elves always to truth, had for &s;ome years pa&s;t, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner affirmed, that all the &s;prings of government were moved and managed by an invi&s;ible agent, who&s;e influence turned the puppets which way he plea&s;ed. Though it cannot be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that any one man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch influence as was &s;uppo&s;ed, yet the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try were frequently &s;o &s;u&s;picious and incon&s;i&s;tent, that they gave rea&s;on for &s;uch &s;urmi|&s;es. It is not &s;trange that the coloni&s;ts &s;hould have believed what was publi&s;hed with &s;o much confidence in the mother country; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that their minds by this time were warped by preju|dice, and their imaginations heated with oppo&s;ition and re&s;entment. They had petitioned without &s;uc|ce&s;s, and remon&s;trated in vain; they acknowledged the &s;upremacy of the &s;overeign, and the authority of parliament to direct their trade and navigation, but nothing would plea&s;e admini&s;tration but ab&s;olute do|minion over their all. This they accounted contrary to their natural rights as Engli&s;hmen, and a breach of their charters; and the new proceedings of parlia|ment they con&s;idered as &s;o many chains to en&s;lave them. Thus like a &s;tream that is fed by con&s;tant &s;upplies, their oppo&s;ition encrea&s;ed, till, like a torrent, it overflowed all bounds.</P>

<PB N="195" REF="201">they recommend, and breathes the &s;pirit of vengeance again&s;t &s;ome leading per&s;ons in the colony of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets bay. It was now manife&s;t that nothing could bring matters to a proper temper, except an uncondi|tional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the part of the coloni&s;ts; for both King and parliament were determined to humble them. At this time it appeared to almo&s;t all ranks of people, an ea&s;y matter to have &s;ettled the difference. Mode|ration in the government, equal to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the coloni&s;ts might have &s;ettled all the commotions; but it was now determined to make u&s;e of the mo&s;t rigorous mea&s;ures, and to bring the coloni&s;t to the feet of the mini&s;ter. Wi&s;e men began to perceive the ab&s;urdity of the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try, and publicly &s;hewed their di&s;like of their proceedings, and on that account were con&s;idered as di&s;loyal and di&s;af|fected to the government. The mo&s;t wretched and de&s;picable tools of admini&s;tration, over all the nation, were, on all occa&s;ions, ready to in&s;ult every per&s;on that hinted the &s;malle&s;t di&s;like of the violent mea&s;ures that were now propo&s;ed. Petitions and remon&s;trances were con&s;idered as &s;editious libels, and the petitioners and remon&s;trators accounted factious and di&s;loyal per|&s;ons. The very Jacobites and Papi&s;ts, who, it is well known never were well affected to the revolution &s;et|tlement, nor the Hanoverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, became now the accu&s;ers of the King's mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects, and were not a&s;hamed openly to charge the Revolution with rebellion. The great numbers of tho&s;e who had been concerned in the rebellion in the year 1745
<PB N="196" REF="202">being re&s;tored to their fortunes and e&s;tates, as well as preferred in the army and navy, gave &s;upicion to tho&s;e who were friends of the con&s;titution, that &s;ome dark &s;chemes were operating to bring the empire under a more arbitrary government. What added to the&s;e &s;u&s;picions was, that ever &s;ince 1745, it had been the con&s;tant conver&s;ation of the Jacobites in their private a&s;&s;emblies, that they would walk more &s;urely, and play a more certain game in their future proceedings, than they and their fathers had done &s;ince the revolution: that it would be a work of more time, to worm them|&s;elves into places of power and tru&s;t, by a &s;pecious behaviour, but would operate with more certainty, than proceeding to acts of violence. The&s;e &s;ecret manuoevres were not kept &s;o clo&s;e, as to be totally con|cealed; they had, upon occa&s;ions, admitted &s;ome in|to their meetings who were unknown to them, not of their principles. $$e&s;e made no &s;ecrets of what they had heard, but told them to others, and they at la&s;t circulated &s;o wide $s to &s;pread over the whole nation. The&s;e hints moved the friends of the revolution, and made them publi&s;h their &s;u&s;picions to the nation. The friends of the mini&s;try-declared that all this was &s;lan|der, proceeding from malice and di&s;appointment: that the people in oppo&s;ition had nothing in view ex|cept to embarra&s;s government, and to have the manage|ment, and the perqui&s;ites belonging thereto, into their own hands. This a&s;&s;ertion was not unplau&s;ible; for it oftentimes happens that the clamour again&s;t the mi|ni&s;try proceeds more from a love of their places, than from any di&s;like of their mea&s;ures. The mini|&s;try on this occa&s;ion, as on many occa&s;ions &s;ince, were but badly &s;erved with tho&s;e whom they employed to defend their mea&s;ures, to the public. The writers upon their &s;ide, were not equal in abilities to tho&s;e in
<PB N="197" REF="203">the oppo&s;ition; and though they had been equal to it, it indeed is impo&s;&s;ible for hirelings to write with &s;o much &s;pirit and freedom as tho&s;e who write from prin|ciple, and from the heart.</P>
<P>What irritated the coloni&s;ts to the highe&s;t degree, was an act pa&s;&s;ed in 1767, for granting certain duties in the Briti&s;h colonies and plantations in America. This law contains a va&s;t number of articles which the colo|ni&s;ts thought heavy and grievous, and which were judged incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e ideas implied in the law repealing the &s;tamp act.

<P>DECLARATORY ACT.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Whereas &s;everal of the hou&s;es of Repre&s;entatives in his Maje|&s;ty's colonies and plantations in America, have of late, again&s;t law, claimed to them&s;elves, or to the general a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;ame, the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of impo&s;ing duties and taxes upon his Maje|&s;ty's &s;ubjects in the &s;aid colonies and plantations; and have, in pur&s;uance of &s;uch claim, pa&s;&s;ed certain votes, re&s;olutions, and or|ders, derogatory to the legi&s;lative authority of parliament, and in|con&s;i&s;tent with the dependency of the &s;aid colonies and planta|tions upon the crown of Great &endq;Britain</Q>.

<P N="2">II.

In no year &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the the throne, were there greater
<PB N="198" REF="204">commotions and debates in the empire than in this. Not only were the colonies in a &s;tate of commotion, but the nation at home was in a continual bu&s;tle. Ad|dre&s;&s;es on one &s;ide, and petitions on the other, were pre&s;ented in great numbers to the throne. The prin|ciples upon which they proceeded were &s;o oppo&s;ite, and contrary to each other, that one would conclude, by comparing them, that the human mind mu&s;t have, in &s;ome people, different faculties, from what others are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and that right and wrong are not the
<PB N="199" REF="205">&s;ame to all mankind. The addre&s;s and petitions are &s;o e&s;&s;entially different in their nature, that by the one you would determine the nation to be in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition, and in a &s;tate of the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s, and by the other you would be led to believe, that it was upon the verge of utter ruin, and on the very brink of de&s;truction. Perhaps neither the ca&s;es, as &s;tated in the one or the other are &s;trictly true, nor is it po&s;&s;ible that they could be both true; but one thing is certain, that neither the one nor the other
<PB N="200" REF="206">were really the voice of the nation. For as the mi|ni&s;try and the court party u&s;ed their utmo&s;t efforts to procure addre&s;&s;ers, &s;o leading men in the oppo&s;ition did all they could to procure petitioners, who knew as little about the grievances, as the addre&s;&s;ers did a|bout the happine&s;s of the nation. Both were the oc|ca&s;ion of great noi&s;e and confu&s;ion; people were ta|ken off their bu&s;ine&s;s, and idle di&s;po&s;ed men went riot|ing for &s;everal days together, without doing any thing except drinking and making noi&s;e in the &s;treets of towns and cities. The number of petitioners was by far the greate&s;t, and &s;hewed that among tho&s;e who
<PB N="201" REF="207">pretended to have a right to intermeddle in tho&s;e mat|ters, the majority was on the &s;ide of the oppo&s;ition. The great number of petitions that were &s;ent to the throne, gave great offence to the mini&s;try, and they were treated with the utmo&s;t contempt. This pro|voked the petitioners to the highe&s;t degree, and made many of them both &s;peak and write many &s;evere things again&s;t the mini&s;try. Thus the parties irritated one another, that charity and love among men became a very rare thing. Tho&s;e on the &s;ide of the court be|ing generally the more wealthy and &s;ub&s;tantial part of the nation, looked with contempt upon the other &s;ide, and de&s;pi&s;ed them, as not worthy of being con|&s;ulted in any affairs of government; while the others con&s;idered them as oppre&s;&s;ors and enemies of their coun|try. The debates both in and out of parliament run high. The court party cried out for &s;evere mea&s;ures. They &s;aid the authority of parliament had been tram|pled upon, the &s;overeign had been in&s;ulted on the throne, by the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and provoking proceed|ings, and in&s;olent petitions. A di&s;&s;olution of parlia|ment was reque&s;ted, for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e they had complied with the King's mini&s;ters, whom the King him&s;elf had appointed. How could the King expect to be obeyed in &s;uch critical emergencies, that mu&s;t occur in any plan for aggrandizing the crown; when the mini&s;ters who formed &s;uch plans were given up, and the parliament, who had acted under their influence was di&s;olved? This kind of rea|&s;oning was, by the other &s;ide, con&s;idered as partial, &s;elfi&s;h, and inconclu&s;ive; they looked upon &s;uch ar|guments as the &s;hifts of guilty per&s;ons to cover their iniquities, rather than the rea&s;oning of true and good politicians. To threaten the nation for petitioning the &s;overeign, which was a right that belonged to
<PB N="202" REF="208">every individual, was looked upon as an in&s;olence which none but de&s;perate men would have been guilty of. The arguments on this occa&s;ion went much again&s;t the mini|&s;try, which did not a little provoke them; and as u&s;ual|ly happens in the time of controver&s;y, many indecent reflections were thrown forth again&s;t individuals, which were a di&s;grace to the cau&s;e they were &s;up|porting. Magi&s;trates, however many errors they may be guilty of, as long as they continue in office, per&s;ons in oppo&s;ing their mi&s;conduct, ought always to ob&s;erve decency. It adds no lu&s;ture to any cau&s;e to &s;upport it with &s;candal and per&s;onal reflections. A &s;pecies of writing was now become fa&s;hionable, where|in all the private foibles of men's lives were drawn into the argument, and their private infirmities paint|ed with the mo&s;t uncharitable colourings. This wan|tonne&s;s of the pre&s;s provoked the court and the mi|ni&s;try exceedingly, &s;o that they were determined to make examples of offenders as &s;oon as they could have a proper opportunity. This was a very weak re&s;olution; for the offence was mutual, and neither &s;ide could plead innocent. The writers on the &s;ide of the court were often as illiberal as tho&s;e on the &s;ide of the oppo&s;ition; but where men of power are irri|tated, it requires much wi&s;dom to make them re&s;train their power within the bounds of right rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. The mini&s;try were &s;adly galled, and felt the ridicule of their opponents, which was often very &s;currilous.</P>
<P>When the parliament met this year, upon the 9th of January, the nation was in great expectations con|cerning the manner how the &s;tate of public affairs would be introduced in the &s;peech from the throne; when, to the amazement of all, the chief contents thereof, were filled up with a di&s;temper among the
<PB N="203" REF="209">horned cattle. It was expected that notice would have been taken of the dome&s;tic commotions in the nation at home, and of the di&s;turbances in America, but with regard to all the&s;e there was a perfect &s;ilence. The &s;peech became an object of ridicule over all the nation, as the di&s;temper it referred to was &s;carcely known to have any exi&s;tence, and had not become an object of &s;erious reflection among the people who were more immediately concerned.</P>
<P>The cold re&s;erve in the &s;peech from the throne, was not imitated by tho&s;e in oppo&s;ition to the mea|&s;ures of the mini&s;try. When the addre&s;s was read, a motion was made for an ammendment, in the fol|lowing terms: that they would immediately enquire into the cau&s;es of the prevailing di&s;contents through|out his Maje&s;ty's dominions. This introduced &s;ome long debates, that were carried on with great heat and acrimony of expre&s;&s;ion, unknown before, in par|liament, and in which many &s;evere animadver&s;ions were made upon the &s;everal parts of the &s;peech from the throne. The affair concerning the petitions was agitated with great violence, and the grievances of the nation painted in the &s;tronge&s;t colours by the op|po&s;ition,&mdash;while the other &s;ide openly denied their exi&s;tence, and &s;eemed to threaten tho&s;e who &s;et them forth. There was a party on the &s;ide of the mini&s;try that were more moderate; the&s;e admitted the exi&s;t|ence of the grievances alledged, but affirmed they were exaggerated beyond all bounds. They acknowledged the di&s;contents in the nation, and declared them&s;elves willing to con&s;ider them at a proper &s;ea&s;on, as well as to recon&s;ider the election of Middle&s;ex, which was now a great bone of contention; they &s;aid they were willing to li&s;ten to methods of redre&s;s &s;oberly propo|&s;ed, and at a time when they had lei&s;ure: but they
<PB N="204" REF="210">objected to the motion, as it would &s;ix a crime upon them&s;elves, to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty that by an abu&s;e of power, they had been the cau&s;e of all the prevailing di&s;contents, and would be joining in a prayer for their own di&s;&s;olution. The majority upon this &s;ide pur&s;ued another method of argument; they allowed the di&s;|contents, but charged them and the petitions, to the gentlemen in the oppo&s;ition, through who&s;e influence the people were per&s;uaded to imagine the one and &s;ub&s;cribe the other.</P>
<P>And it was boldly affirmed that the only cau&s;e of both, was the hatred of their leaders to tho&s;e in ad|mini&s;tration. It was in&s;i&s;ted that the majority of gen|tlemen of large fortunes, and the magi&s;trates through|out the nation, together with the clergy in &s;everal counties, had not joined in the petitions, and that a majority of counties had not petitioned at all: that the inferior cla&s;s of freeholders were not capable of under&s;tanding what they &s;ub&s;cribed; that the farmers and manufacturers throughout the nation could neither know nor take any intere&s;t in the pre&s;ent di&s;putes, provided they had not been &s;tirred up by factious and &s;editious per&s;ons, who were hunting after grie|vances, and continually fabricating petitions.&mdash;That by men of that character, meetings had been adverti&s;ed, where the people were harangued with inflammatory &s;peeches, and writings publi&s;hed and &s;cattered through the kingdom, in which government had been re|proached and vilified, the parliament abu&s;ed, and the minds of the people inflamed. All this was done, it was alledged, to di&s;tre&s;s government; but it was added, that although the majority of &s;uch freeholders had &s;igned the petitions without any influence or &s;olicita|tion, they were only to be con&s;idered as the acts of a rabble, and of an ignorant multitude, incapable of
<PB N="205" REF="211">judging. This kind of &s;tile, as it was in its own na|ture opprobrious, &s;o it was al&s;o not true in fact, be|cau&s;e tho&s;e whom the court party called a rabble, be|haved with as much wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion, as even the be&s;t of the friends of the mini&s;try. It is a &s;ort of lunacy which often prevails among &s;elfi&s;h politicians, to imagine that the people in the lower walks of life are de&s;titute of all penetration and di&s;cernment; and that they are not qualified to judge concerning their own affairs. Nothing but mere ignorance of their characters, or a wilful intention to mi&s;repre&s;ent them, could di&s;po&s;e men of &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding to judge in &s;uch a manner. Among tho&s;e whom vain and high minded courtiers denominate the rabble, and the &s;cum of the earth, are to be found as much common &s;en&s;e, and prudence, as among tho&s;e of the highe&s;t ranks in the nation, if take them in equal proportion. By taking a &s;urvey of the hi&s;tory of bankruptcies, failures, and delinquencies, it will appear that there is a good proportion of the&s;e to be found among tho&s;e who are not accounted the &s;cum of the nation. The abu&s;e which many in government at this time received from the people, proceeded from le&s;&s;ons they had learned from courtiers them&s;elves, who&s;e ab&s;urd and ridiculous &s;tile the vulgar turned again&s;t them, and paid back with con&s;iderable intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The charge which tho&s;e in admini&s;tration brought again&s;t the minority, or tho&s;e in oppo&s;ition, namely that they had been active in promoting the petitions, was openly acknowledged and defended by them. They &s;aid they accounted them&s;elves bound in duty to render an account of their conduct in parliament to their con&s;tituents, and al&s;o to give them their be&s;t advice, and opinion, when required, in any thing that related to their intere&s;ts, and to give them the mo&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="212">early notice of all mea&s;ures that tended to &s;ubvert their rights, or were dangerous to the con&s;titution. The charges of meeting, and writing, and &s;peaking, which had been brought again&s;t them, were ridicu|lous, and it was a&s;ked by what other methods people could communicate their &s;entiments. It was al&s;o ob|&s;erved that it had been in&s;inuated that our grievances were imaginary, becau&s;e the pea&s;ants or manufactu|rers in Devon&s;hire and York&s;hire would not immedi|ately feel them, nor perhaps di&s;cover them till they felt them. But it was urged that though tho&s;e who were bu&s;ily employed, might not find time to con&s;ider the&s;e matters immediately, till they began to feel their effects, yet this was no rea&s;on why tho&s;e who &s;aw their di&s;tant approach, &s;hould keep &s;ilent, and not warn them. Tho&s;e who perceive the &s;ubver&s;ion of liberty in the cau&s;e thereof, may be few, which is generally the ca&s;e; but this will not prove that there are never approaches to oppre&s;&s;ion, or remote cau&s;es of the &s;ubver&s;ion of freedom. If the few who per|ceive effects in their cau&s;es can open the eyes of o|thers, they do no more than what is their duty, and perform a piece of real &s;ervice to the community.</P>
<P>It was added on this &s;ide of the que&s;tion, that though many gentlemen of large fortunes, and the clergy, had not &s;igned the petitions, yet a great num|ber had done it, and the&s;e of the mo&s;t independent rank and character; and of tho&s;e who had refu&s;ed to &s;ign many of them were under a particular influence. That the ju&s;tices of the peace were officers of the crown, and that no body of men were under greater influence than the clergy, yet that &s;ome of the&s;e had even &s;igned the petitions. It was a&s;ked likewi&s;e if the generality of the freeholders were of no &s;ignifica|tion? if their opinion was of no weight? and it was
<PB N="207" REF="213">a&s;&s;erted that they were that re&s;pectable body of men who were alone &s;uperior to all threatenings, fear, and influence. It was further urged, that the petition|ing counties, cities, and towns were in re&s;pect to o|pulence and number of inhabitants, far &s;uperior to tho&s;e that had not petitioned; and that they contri|buted more to the land-tax, which was now a te&s;t of freehold property in this country, than the re&s;t of the united kingdom. The&s;e, with &s;ome other &s;imilar ar|guments were u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion on the &s;ide of the oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Soon after the meeting of the parliament, a long train of re&s;ignations took place. Lord Camden re|&s;igned the &s;eals: the Marquis of Granby, all his pla|ces except the regiment of Blues; the Duke of Beau|fort his place of Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to the Queen; the Duke of Manche&s;ter and Earl of Coventry of Lords of the Bedchamber; the Earl of Huntington his place of groom of the &s;table, and Mr James Gren|ville his office of one of the Vice-trea&s;urers of Ireland, Mr Dunning, the Solicitor-general, al&s;o re&s;igned that employment. The whole of admini&s;tration &s;eemed in a &s;hattered condition, and &s;uch convul&s;ions pre|vailed, as &s;truck a panic in the body politic; the court was, however, re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the plan it had &s;et out upon, and was determined to govern by men who had no popular views or connections, and to maintain its ground, notwith&s;tanding &s;o many of its principal managers had de&s;erted its cau&s;e. There are certain periods of fatality in the hi&s;tory of nations, when men employed in the management of public affairs proceed upon the mo&s;t ab&s;urd principles, contrary to all rea|&s;on, and conviction, and ru&s;h headlong over the pre|cipice of their own de&s;poti&s;m into the gulf of anihila|tion. What prudence and moderation might have
<PB N="208" REF="214">pre&s;erved for ages, they frequently de&s;troy in one day, and by the rapidity of the mo&s;t jarring and di&s;cordant mea&s;ures, grind to pieces tho&s;e &s;prings and wheels of government, which, by the cour&s;e of regular motion would have endured as long as time. The Engli&s;h con&s;titution is a contrivance of wi&s;dom, formed to la&s;t forever, when pur&s;ued upon its own principles; when the &s;everal balances are kept in equilibrio, and every power acts in its own &s;phere; but if any of its powers are permitted to encroach upon the &s;phere of another, the frame will &s;oon fall to pieces, and become a per|fect ruin. This was the ca&s;e before the revolution, when the executive power overbalanced the legi&s;la|tive, and reduced the community to a &s;tate of nature. In the time of the long parliament, one part of the legi&s;lature overbalanced the other, and overturned the con&s;titution, and introduced anarchy. All this &s;hews that the greate&s;t care &s;hould be ob&s;erved by tho&s;e em|ployed in public matters, to pre&s;erve an equilibruim in all parts of the con&s;titution. But this can never be done, when the crown has it in its power to corrupt the legi&s;lature. Riches committed into the hands of the &s;overeign to oil the wheels of government, will &s;oon make a prime mini&s;ter, unle&s;s he is both wi&s;e and vir|tuous, like the &s;on of Phoebus, drive &s;o furiou&s;ly till he &s;et the nation in a flame. Anarchy is an evil and dangerous thing, but it is not equally &s;o bad as tyran|ny. The jarring parts of a broken con&s;titution, that through popular convul&s;ions, are thrown into confu|&s;ion, may, by wi&s;dom, be arranged and put into or|der, and reared up like a new creation; but when there is no power but one exi&s;ting, into which all the re&s;t are ab&s;orbed, it will be next to impo&s;&s;ible to re|&s;tore the fabric.</P>
<PB N="209" REF="215">
<P>Upon the 22d of January, this year, Sir John Cu&s;t re&s;igned his office of Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, on account of his bad &s;tate of health, and was &s;ucceeded by Sir Fletcher Norton, Sir Fletcher was propo&s;ed by the mini&s;ter, and the oppo&s;ition &s;et up another again&s;t him; this brought the &s;trength of the parties to a trial, when the mini&s;try carried their point in a divi&s;ion of near two to one. The influence of the court began to be now &s;o &s;trong, that it carried every mea&s;ure wherein it was engaged. This was truly alarming to the nation, becau&s;e &s;ome points of the mo&s;t unpopular, as well as of the mo&s;t unrea&s;on|able nature, had been carried by that influence.</P>
<P>The affair of the Middle&s;ex election, and the di&s;|qualifying of Mr Wilkes, were carried on and &s;upport|ed by the influence of the mini&s;ter; the&s;e proceed|ings were con&s;idered by the greate&s;t part of the na|tion, as exertions of power, intended to cru&s;h the &s;pirits of the people, and to &s;hew them that their voice was of no con&s;ideration in the e&s;teem of government, and that matters would be carried on without their con&s;ent. Tho&s;e proceedings alarmed all true friends to liberty, who con&s;idered the blow given to the peo|ple of Middle&s;ex, a &s;troke aimed at the freedom of the whole nation.</P>
<P>The citizens of London made &s;ome &s;pirited, noble, and bold efforts to &s;tem the tide of mini&s;terial infatu|ation, and to &s;top the torrent of de&s;poti&s;m, that appear|ed now to carry all before it. They concluded, as was natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that his Maje&s;ty, if rightly in|formed of the &s;tate of the nation, and the &s;entiments of his people, would di&s;mi&s;s &s;uch &s;ervants as, by their mi&s;management, had irritated the minds of his faith|ful &s;ubjects, and were likely, by proceeding in the &s;ame cour&s;e to alienate their hearts from their ju&s;t
<PB N="210" REF="216">and lawful &s;overeign. They therefore, on the 24th of June, the preceding year, pre&s;ented a petition to his Maje&s;ty, &s;etting forth the many heavy grievances which the nation laboured under, through the ob&s;ti|nate mi&s;management of the officers of the crown; which grievances are &s;pecially pointed out in the pe|tition it&s;elf in &s;undry articles. Their petition, as well as that of the county of Middle&s;ex, and many others received no an&s;wer. Upon the 14th of March, this year, they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, remon&s;trance, and petition to his Maje&s;ty, &s;etting forth all the former grievances in their fir&s;t petition, with other new ar|ticles, and craved that his Maje&s;ty would di&s;&s;olve the parliament, as now become no longer a repre&s;entation of the people, nor could be, in the &s;en&s;e of the con|&s;titution, con&s;idered as a legal parliament. To this addre&s;s and remon&s;trance they received a &s;evere an|&s;wer. This did not hinder the intrepid citizens of London to pre&s;ent another addre&s;s of remon&s;trance and petition to the King upon the 23d of May, where|in they a&s;&s;ert their right of petitioning, and expre&s;s their a&s;toni&s;hment at the awful cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed upon them in his Maje&s;ty's late an&s;wer from the throne. To this remon&s;trance they received much the &s;ame an&s;wer as before; &s;horter indeed in its &s;ize, but equal|ly &s;evere in its contents. It was on this occa&s;ion that Mr Alderman Beckford, a per&s;on intrepid and zeal|ous for the cau&s;e of liberty, and that of the citizens of London, delivered a &s;peech to his Maje&s;ty, which &s;tands recorded in the journals of the court of common coun|cil, as a perpetual memorial of his greatne&s;s of mind, integrity, and re&s;olution. The au&s;tere beams of ma|je&s;ty could not damp his &s;pirits, nor the &s;plendor of royalty in frowns, intimidate him, when the free|dom and liberty of England and London &s;eemed to be
<PB N="211" REF="217">in danger. His &s;peech was worthy of a great citi|zen to deliver, and worthy of the greate&s;t monarch to hear. It &s;eems to have been dictated by wi&s;dom, and delivered with true zeal; the contents are im|portant, the &s;tile elegant and manly; and the whole is a ma&s;ter-piece in its kind.

<P>We &s;hould be wanting in our duty to your Maje&s;ty, as well as to our&s;elves and our po&s;terity &s;hould we forbear to repre&s;ent to the throne the de&s;perate attempts which have been, and are too &s;uc|ce&s;sfully made, to de&s;troy the con|&s;titution, to the &s;pirit of which we owe the relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts be|tween your Maje&s;ty and the &s;ubjects of the&s;e realms, and to &s;ubvert tho&s;e &s;acred laws which our ance&s;|tors have &s;ealed with their blood.</P>
<P>Your mini&s;ters, from corrupt principles, and in violation of eve|ry duty, have, by various enumer|ated means, invaded our invaluable and unalienable right of trial by jury.</P>
<P>They have, with impunity, i&s;&s;ued general warrants, and violently &s;ei|zed per&s;ons and private papers.</P>
<P>They have rendered the laws non effective to our &s;ecurity, by e|vading the <HI>Habeas Corpus.</HI></P>
<P>They have cau&s;ed puni&s;hments, and even perpetual impri&s;onment to be inflicted without trial, con|viction, or &s;entence.</P>
<P>They have brought into di&s;re|pute the civil magi&s;tracy, by the appointment of per&s;ons who are, in many re&s;pects, unqualified for that important tru&s;t, and have thereby purpo&s;ely furni&s;hed a pre|tence for calling in the aid of a mi|litary power.</P>
<P>They avow and endeavour to e|&s;tabli&s;h a maxim, ab&s;olutely incon|&s;i&s;tent with our con&s;titution; "that an occa&s;ion for effectually employ|ing a military force, always pre|&s;ents it&s;elf, when the civil power is trifled with or in&s;ulted." And by a fatal and fal&s;e application of this maxim, they have wantonly and wickedly facrificed the lives of many of your Maje&s;ty's innocent &s;ubjects, and have pro&s;tituted your Maje&s;ty's &s;acred name and autho|rity, to ju&s;tify, applaud, and re|commend their own illegal and bloody actions.</P>
<P>They have &s;creened more than one murderer from puni&s;hment, and in its place have unnaturally &s;ub&s;tituted reward.</P>
<P>They have $&s;tabli&s;hed number|le&s;s uncon&s;titutional regulations and taxations in our colonies; they have cau&s;ed a revenue to be rai&s;ed in &s;ome of them by prerogative; they have appointed civil law jud|ges to try revenue cau&s;es, and to be paid from out of the condemna|tion money.</P>
<P>After having in&s;ulted and defeat|ed the law on different occa&s;ions, and by different contrivances, both at home and abroad, they have at length completed their de&s;ign, by violently wre&s;ting from the people the la&s;t &s;acred right we had left, the right of election, by the unpre|cedented &s;eating of a candidate, notoriou&s;ly &s;et up and cho&s;en only by them&s;elves; they have thereby taken from your &s;ubjects all hopes of parliamentary redre&s;s, and have left us no re&s;ource, under GOD, but in your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>All this they have been able to effect by corruption; by a &s;canda|lous mi&s;application and embezzle|ment of the public trea&s;ure, and a &s;hameful pro&s;titution of public ho|nours and employments; procu|ring deficiencies of the civil li&s;t to be made good without examina|tion, and in&s;tead of puni&s;hing, con|ferring honours on a pay-ma&s;ter, the public defaulter of unaccount|ed millions.</P>
<P>From an unfeigned &s;en&s;e of the duty we owe to your Maje&s;ty, and to our country, we have ventured thus humbly to lay before the throne the&s;e great and important truths, which it has been the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of your mini&s;ters to conceal. We mo&s;t earne&s;tly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to grant us redre&s;s: It is for the purpo&s;e of redre&s;s alone, and for &s;uch occa&s;ions as the pre|&s;ent, that tho&s;e great and exten&s;ive powers are entru&s;ted to the Crown, by the wi&s;dom of that con&s;titution, which your Maje&s;ty's illu&s;trious fa|mily was cho&s;en to defend, and which, we tru&s;t in GOD, it will for ever continue to &s;upport.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We have already in our petition dutifully repre&s;ented to your Ma|je&s;ty, the chief injuries we have &s;u|&s;tained. We are unwilling to be|lieve that your Maje&s;ty can &s;light the de&s;ires of your people, or be regardle&s;s of their affection, and deaf to their complaints. Yet their complaints remain unan&s;wer|ed; their injuries are confirmed; and the only judge removeable at the plea&s;ure of the crown, has been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his high office, for defending in parliament, the law and the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>We, therefore, venture once more to addre&s;s our&s;elves to your Maje&s;ty, as to the father of your people; as to him who mu&s;t be both able and willing to redre&s;s our grievances; and we repeat our application with the greater pro|priety, becau&s;e we &s;ee the in&s;tru|ments of our wrongs, who have carried into execution the mea|&s;ures of which we complain, more particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by your Maje&s;ty's royal bounty and fa|vour.</P>
<P>Under the &s;ame &s;ecret and malign influence, which through each &s;ucce&s;&s;ive admini&s;tration has defeated every good, and &s;ugge&s;ted every bad intention, the majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons have de|prived your people of their deare&s;t rights.</P>
<P>They have done a deed more ruinous in its con&s;equences than the levying of &s;hip money by Charles the fir&s;t; or the di&s;pen&s;ing power a&s;&s;umed by James the &s;e|cond. A deed, which mu&s;t vitiate all the future proceedings of this parliament, for the acts of the le|gi&s;lature it&s;elf can no more be valid without a legal Hou&s;e of Commons, than without a legal prince upon the throne.</P>
<P>Repre&s;entatives of the people are e&s;&s;ential to the making of laws, and there is a time when it is morally demon&s;trable, that men cea&s;e to be repre&s;entatives; that time is now arrived: The pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Commons do not repre&s;ent the people.</P>
<P>We owe to your Maje&s;ty, and o|bedience under the re&s;trictions of the laws for the calling and dura|tion of parliaments; and your Ma|je&s;ty owes to us, that our repre&s;en|tation, free from the force of arms or corruption, &s;hould be pre&s;erved to us in parliament. It was for this we &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;truggled un|der James the &s;econd; for this we &s;eated, and have faithfully &s;upport|ed your Maje&s;ty's family on the throne; The people have been in|variably uniform in their object, though the different mode of attack has called for a different defence.</P>
<P>Under James the &s;econd, they complained that the &s;itting of par|liament was interrupted, becau&s;e it was not corruptly &s;ub&s;ervient to his de&s;igns: We complain now, that the &s;itting of this parliament is not interrupted, becau&s;e it is corruptedly &s;ub&s;ervient to the de|&s;igns of your Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters. Had the parliament, under James the &s;econd, been as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his commands, as the parliament is at this day to the dictates of a mini&s;ter; in&s;tead of clamours for its meeting, the nation would have rung, as now, with outcries for its di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The forms of the con&s;titution, like tho&s;e of religion, were not e|&s;tabli&s;hed for the form's &s;ake, but for the &s;ub&s;tance; and we call GOD and men to witne&s;s, that as we do not owe our liberty to tho&s;e nice and &s;ubtle di&s;&s;inctions, which places and pen&s;ions, and lucrative employments have invented; &s;o neither will we be deprived of it by them; but as it was gained by the &s;tern virtue of our ance&s;tors, by the virtue of their de&s;cendants it &s;hall be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the mi&s;deeds of your Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, in viola|ting the freedom of election, and depraving the noble con&s;titution of parliaments, are notorious, as well as &s;ubver&s;ive of the fundamental laws and liberties of this realm; and &s;ince your Maje&s;ty, both in honour and ju&s;tice, is obliged in|violably to pre&s;erve them, accord|ing to the oath made to GOD and your &s;ubjects at your coronation; We your Maje&s;ty's remon&s;trants a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that your Maje&s;ty will re&s;tore the con&s;titutional go|vernment and quiet of your peo|ple, by di&s;&s;olving this parliament, and removing tho&s;e evil mini&s;ters for ever from your councils.</P>

<P>I &s;hall always be ready to receive the reque&s;ts, and to li&s;ten to the complaints of my &s;ubjects; but it gives me great concern, to find that any of them &s;hould have been &s;o far mi&s;led as to offer me an addre&s;s and remon&s;trance, the contents of which I cannot but con&s;ider as di&s;|re&s;pectful to me, injurious to my parliament, and irreconcileable to the principles of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I have ever made the law of the land the rule of my conduct, e|&s;teeming it my chief glory to reign over a free people. With this view, I have always been careful, as well to execute faithfully the tru&s;t repo|&s;ed in me, as to avoid even the ap|pearance of invading any of tho&s;e powers which the con&s;titution has placed in other hands. It is only by per&s;evering in &s;uch conduct, that I can either di&s;charge my own $uty, or &s;ecure to my &s;ubjects the free enjoyment of tho&s;e rights which my family were called to defend, and, while I act upon the&s;e prin|ciples, I &s;hall have a right to ex|pect, and I am confident I &s;hall continue to receive, the &s;teady and affectionate &s;upport of my people,</P>

<P>Will your Maje&s;ty be plea&s;ed &s;o far to conde&s;cend as to permit the Mayor of your loyal city of Lon|don, to declare in your royal pre|&s;ence, on behalf of his fellow citi|zens, how much the bare appre|hen&s;ion of your Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea|&s;ure would at all times affect their minds. The declaration of that di&s;plea&s;ure, has already filled them with inexpre&s;&s;ible anxiety, and with the deepe&s;t affliction. Permit me, Sire, to a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that your Maje&s;ty has not in all your dominions any &s;ubjects more faithful, more dutiful, or more af|fectionate to your Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and family, or more ready to &s;acri|fice their lives and fortunes in the maintenance of the true honor and dignity of your crown.</P>
<P>We do, therefore, with the great|e&s;t humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;upplicate your Maje&s;ty, that you will not di&s;mi&s;s us from your pre&s;ence, without expre&s;&s;ing a more favourable opinion of your faithful citizens, and without &s;ome pro&s;pect, at lea&s;t of redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Permit me, Sire, farther to ob|&s;erve, that whoever has already dared, or &s;hall hereafter endeavour by fal&s;e in&s;inuations and &s;ug|ge&s;tions, to alienate your Maje&s;ty's affections from your loyal &s;ubjects in general, and from the city of London in particular, and to with|draw your confidence in, and re|gard for your people, is an enemy to your Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and fami|ly, a violator of the public peace, and a betrayer of our happy con|&s;titution, as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed at the glorious revolution.</P>
</LETTER></NOTE>. There was another addre&s;s and remon|&s;trance pre&s;ented upon the 21&s;t of November, this
<PB N="212" REF="218">year, which &s;et forth much the &s;ame grievances, and prayed for the &s;ame redre&s;s; but as they contain very little new, I have pa&s;&s;ed them over.</P>
<P>About &s;ix days after the re&s;ignations which have been mentioned above, the Duke of Grafton re&s;ign|ed his place and office of fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury, and was &s;ucceeded by Lord North, who was already Chancellor of the Exchequer. Various rea&s;ons were a&s;&s;igned for his Grace's re&s;ignation, though perhaps none of them the true ones: Some imputed his con|duct,
<PB N="213" REF="219">to fear of being re&s;pon&s;ible for mea&s;ures which he was not allowed to conduct according to his own judgment, and others to &s;ome certain di&s;gu&s;t which they could not account for. Whatever was the cau&s;e, both parties reproached him, and the friends of the court, though he &s;till &s;upported their mea&s;ures, com|plained of him for de&s;erting them. Lord North now catched hold of the helm, where we will find him &s;teer|ing the ve&s;&s;el of &s;tate through the greate&s;t part of this hi&s;tory; with what &s;ucce&s;s, the period of his political
<PB N="214" REF="220">career, and the matters of fact will declare. The debates concerning dome&s;tic affairs had been &s;o warm|ly agitated, that American affairs which had been re|commended in his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech, had hitherto been overlooked. It was not now to be expected, con&s;i|dering the temper of the mini&s;try with regard to af|fairs at home, that the coloni&s;ts who were in&s;i&s;ting upon the &s;ame privileges, would find much favour.</P>
<P>Upon the 5th of March, the mini&s;ter, however, thought proper to bring in a bill for a repeal of &s;o
<PB N="215" REF="221">much of the late act pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;eventh of the pre|&s;ent reign, as related, to the impo&s;ing of a duty upon paper, painters colours, and gla&s;s; the tax upon tea, which was laid on by the &s;ame act, being &s;till to be continued. The rea&s;ons given for this repeal were, that the act had been the occa&s;ion of dangerous com|binations on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic, and had created di&s;contents at home among the merchants tra|ding to tho&s;e parts, which made the repealing of the act a matter of &s;erious con&s;ideration. This &s;aid little for the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature, in pa&s;&s;ing a law, which in its own nature could not but give general di&s;content and commotion among the &s;ubjects. It would appear that the mini&s;ter did not intend to pur|&s;ue the principles of con&s;i&s;tency when he repealed only part of that act, and condemned the whole of it, as incon&s;i&s;tent with true wi&s;dom, and the character of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature. The coloni&s;ts had as great an
<PB N="216" REF="222">objection to the authority that had laid a duty on teas, as that which laid a duty upon paper and gla&s;s. They con&s;idered the authority, impo&s;ing &s;uch duties upon them without their con&s;ent, as illegal and oppre&s;&s;ive, and were not willing to admit a claim of the Engli&s;h legi&s;lature, that denied them the common rights of other &s;ubjects. They inferred, if this claim was ad|mitted or complied with, that a parliament which lay at &s;uch a di&s;tance from them, were in a great mea|&s;ure ignorant of their &s;trength, and who&s;e intere&s;t it was to ea&s;e them&s;elves by oppre&s;&s;ing of them, would never come to an end in their requi&s;itions, as long as they could find any thing to tax in the colonies. They therefore con&s;idered the partial repeal of the act as no favour, while the parliament in&s;i&s;ted upon their taxing them when they plea&s;ed. Tho&s;e in the oppo|&s;ition rea&s;oned much upon the &s;ame principles; but al&s;o added that it would be a real injury to Great Britain, and prevent the coloni&s;ts from buying our manufac|tures, which would bring on di&s;tre&s;s at home, as well as on the other &s;ide the Atlantic. They gave in&s;tances how much the exports to America had fallen &s;hort in the &s;pace of two years; that in 1768 they had ex|ceeded 1769 no le&s;s than the prodigious &s;um of 744,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> they amounting in the former to 2,378,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and in the latter to 1,634,000. This was a convin|cing proof of the operation of tho&s;e new laws that had given ri&s;e to the di&s;turbances in the coloni&s;ts. The mini&s;try &s;eemed to think light of all this, and en|deavoured to account for this difference upon a plan of their own, which they could not but fee was fala|cious and ab&s;urd. They &s;aid the difference was ac|counted for, by &s;uppo&s;ing that the non-importation which en&s;ued was fore&s;een by the importers, and that they had laid in a double quantity of goods. This
<PB N="217" REF="223">was &s;peaking at random, without any certainty, and the true account might have been di&s;covered, by ex|amining the exports before the conte&s;t began, which would have led them to have made a better e&s;timate. The oppo&s;ition, argued again&s;t the tea act, from the inutility thereof; they affirmed that it would produce little advantage to this nation, and would be a &s;ource of perpetual di&s;content to the colonies: that by the keeping up the e&s;tabli&s;hment of cu&s;tom-hou&s;es for that trifling tax, we would oppre&s;s the Americans without any real advantage: that the&s;e voracious of|ficers and their dependents would eat up the whole revenue that aro&s;e from the duty, and where then would be the profit?&mdash;That the tea duty would not pay the charge of collecting it. It is manife&s;t that this act could have no other object except dominion; for in&s;tead of being any advantage to government or this country, it was a real di&s;advantage. It was heaping charges upon the mother country, to collect from the colonies what would not pay the collectors, on which account the people at home would have that deficiency to make up. There could no politi|cal end be an&s;wered by it, except one, and that is to provoke the colonies to rebellion, with an intention to &s;eize upon their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. If men are not infatuated with the &s;tronge&s;t partiality, they can find no other rea&s;on for continuing this part of the act, after they had repealed the other parts of it. Supremacy &s;eems to have been the leading idea with the mini&s;try, which of it&s;elf is &s;o mean and fooli&s;h, that even folly it&s;elf would be a&s;hamed of it, when there is no moral or political end to be an&s;wered thereby. For one coun|try to claim dominion over another at &s;o great a di|&s;tance, would require the legi&s;lature both to be om|ni&s;cient and omnipotent. It was certainly &s;ufficient
<PB N="218" REF="224">for Britain to live in friend&s;hip with their brethren under the &s;ame &s;overeign, and &s;uffer each other to be their own legi&s;lators, walking according to the prin|ciples of their fir&s;t con&s;titution. But &s;uch manuoevres of government have not been uncommon in the world; nations often &s;tretch their power and authority, till by proceeding too far their government is de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The government was now po&s;itively bent upon pur|&s;uing the principles of dominion and &s;upremacy, and determined to &s;upport the tea act at all events. The coloni&s;ts who were well informed of all the proceedings of our parliament, which they con&s;idered as the real deeds of the court, and the mini&s;try, grew more and more ob&s;tinate in their oppo&s;ition, and were not de|termined to comply with &s;tatutes, which they con&s;i|dered as directly contrary to their natural rights and the po&s;itive laws of the Briti&s;h empire. The whole American continent was in a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t agi|tation, and nothing was to be &s;een but deep concern, commotion, and &s;orrow throughout the colonies.</P>
<P>Upon the 12th of March, a mo&s;t dreadful fray hap|pened between the &s;oldiers of the twenty-ninth regi|ment and the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, in which &s;everal people lo&s;t their lives, and the whole city was thrown into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. The reports concerning this dreadful riot have been &s;o various and contradic|tory, that it is difficult to di&s;cover the truth from &s;uch di&s;cordant repre&s;entations. The military who had been &s;ent to Bo&s;ton by the authority of govern|ment, to enforce the new laws, arrived in that city with the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of their being &s;ent there to quell an actual rebellion. They therefore be|gan to u&s;e freedoms incon&s;i&s;tent with the rules of peace, and the tranquility of that city. Their beha|viour gave great offence to the citizens, who were
<PB N="219" REF="225">not a little prejudiced again&s;t them, from the con&s;i|deration that they were &s;ent there, to be a check up|on their liberties. It was not that the officers were guilty of any di&s;re&s;pect to the inhabitants, but did all that was in their power to promote a good under|&s;tanding between the &s;oldiers and the town&s;men. But tho&s;e who know the compo&s;ition of Briti&s;h regiments in the&s;e modern times, will ea&s;ily perceive that it is no ea&s;y ta&s;k to re&s;train them from outrage when they have the &s;malle&s;t occa&s;ion to exert their powers. A collection of men gathered, not only from the lowe&s;t but the ba&s;e&s;t of the people, who have nothing to re|&s;train them but military di&s;cipline, and who always con&s;ider them&s;elves in an enemy's country, where e|ver they are, will always be ready upon the &s;malle&s;t relaxation of command, to fall into extravagances. By comparing the accounts given by Captain Pre&s;ton and that from Bo&s;ton, it appears that the &s;oldiers had not behaved orderly, nor the town&s;men very di&s;|creetly. The private quarrels of individuals &s;oon grew to open outrage, and the colli&s;ion of oppo&s;ite parties, kindled a flame that was not ea&s;ily quenched. The &s;oldiers paraded the &s;treets with drawn cutla&s;&s;es and bayonets, and the people provoked them with in|&s;ults, and opprobrious &s;peeches. The &s;oldiers con|&s;idered the people to be rebels, and behaved to them accordingly, and the citizens looked upon them as a banditti of oppre&s;&s;ors, &s;ent by government to en&s;lave them. It was no wonder that people in&s;pired with &s;uch different &s;entiments &s;hould not agree.</P>
<P>When once matters are carried &s;o far as to i&s;&s;ue in &s;hedding of blood, it is not an ea&s;y ta&s;k to reconcile the contending parties. Though the lieutenant-gover|nor, the magi&s;trates, and other officers did all that was in their power to &s;atisfy the people; yet the remem|brance
<PB N="220" REF="226">of their &s;laughtered friends put them into &s;uch a &s;tate of agitation, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to re|concile their minds to the military. They interpre|ted this tran&s;action as only a prelude to the enforcing of laws by military execution, when once the govern|ment had perfected their mea&s;ures; and the re&s;t of the colonies pretended to &s;ee their own fate in what had now happened at Bo&s;ton. This unhappy com|motion was the occa&s;ion of more evils, both to the government and the colonies; for as the repre&s;enta|tion of the facts were coloured on both &s;ides in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, it left impre&s;&s;ions upon the minds of the partizans, which were not ea&s;ily effaced. The controver&s;y at home concerning the &s;ame &s;ubjects, added additional fuel to the flame of contention, and the &s;ecret manuoevres of government, to di&s;appoint the efforts of tho&s;e that were &s;truggling for liberty, being &s;ometimes di&s;covered, encrea&s;ed the violence of oppo&s;ition. The hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly of South Ca|rolina had voted the &s;um of 1500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling to the &s;o|ciety of the bill of rights, which was oppo&s;ed by the lieutenant-governor, in con&s;equence of in&s;tructions from the mini&s;try in England. Copies of the letters from England were demanded by the a&s;&s;embly, but were refu&s;ed by the lieutenant-governor, which crea|ted great di&s;gu&s;t in the province. Provoked with this interference of the crown; they were determined to &s;hew their oppo&s;ition more openly; and agreed to &s;top all commercial intercou&s;e with New York, on account of that province breaking the non-importa|tion agreement. This and other public deeds of le|gi&s;lative bodies, animated tho&s;e who were more cool in the oppo&s;ition, and by degrees made all the colo|nies unite in one common cau&s;e. It is difficult to a&s;|certain what is the whole truth in this controver&s;y,
<PB N="221" REF="227">but the reader will judge for him&s;elf when he reads the accounts of both parties, which &s;hall be left to his con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>A Letter from Bo&s;ton &s;ets this matter in a true light.</P>
<P>On the evening of Monday being the 5th of March, &s;everal &s;oldiers of the 29th regiment were &s;een para|ding the &s;treets with their drawn cutla&s;&s;es and bayo|nets, abu&s;ing and wounding numbers of the inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>A few minutes after nine o'clock, four youths, named Edward Archbald, William Merchant, Fran|cis Archbald, and John Leech, jun. came down Corn|hill together, and &s;eparating at Dr Loring's corner, the two former, in pa&s;&s;ing a narrow alley, where a &s;oldier was brandi&s;hing a broad &s;word, of an uncom|mon &s;ize, again&s;t the walls, out of which he &s;truck fire plentifully, and a per&s;on of a mean countenance, armed with a large cudgel, by him, Edward Arch|bald bid Mr Merchant take care of the &s;word, on which the &s;oldier turned round, &s;truck Archbald on the arm, and then pu&s;hed at Merchant. Merchant then &s;truck the &s;oldier with a &s;hort &s;tick, and the o|ther per&s;on ran to the barrack, and brought with him two &s;oldiers, one armed with a pair of tongs, the o|ther with a &s;hovel; he with the tongs pur&s;ued Arch|bald through the alley, collarred and laid him over the head with the tongs. The noi&s;e brought people together, and John Hicks, a young lad, coming up, knocked the &s;oldier down, but let him up again; and more lads gathering, drove them back to the bar|rack, where the boys &s;tood &s;ome time as it were to keep them in. In le&s;s than a minute ten or twelve &s;oldiers came out, with drawn cutla&s;&s;es, clubs, and bayonets, and &s;et upon the unarmed boys, who, find|ing
<PB N="222" REF="228">the inequality of their equipment, di&s;per&s;ed. On hearing the noi&s;e, one Samuel Atwood came up to &s;ee what was the matter, and met the &s;oldiers afore|&s;aid ru&s;hing down the alley, and a&s;ked them if they intended to murder people? they an&s;wered, Yes, by G&mdash;d, root and branch! with that one of them &s;truck Mr Atwood with a club, which was repeated by ano|ther, and, being unarmed, he turned to go off, and received a wound on the left &s;houlder, which reach|ed the bone. Retreating a few &s;teps, Mr Atwood met two officers, and &s;aid, Gentlemen, what is the matter? they an&s;wered, you'll &s;ee by and by. Imme|diately after, the&s;e heroes appeared in the &s;quare, a&s;king where were the boogers? where were the cowards? Thirty or forty per&s;ons, mo&s;tly lads, being by this means gathered in King-&s;treet, Captain Pre&s;|ton, with a party of men with charged bayonets, came from the main-guard, and taking their &s;tations by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, began to pu&s;h and drive the people off, pricking &s;ome, and threatening others; on which the people grew clamorous, and, it is &s;aid, threw &s;now-balls. On this the captain commanded his men to fire, and more &s;now-balls coming, he again &s;aid, d&mdash;n you, fire, be the con&s;equence what it will!&mdash;One &s;ol|dier then fired, and a town&s;man, with a cudgel &s;truck him over the hands with &s;uch force that he dropt his firelock, and, ru&s;hing forward, aimed a blow at the captain's head, which grazed his hat, and fell pretty heavy upon his arm, however, the &s;oldiers continu|ed the fire, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till &s;even or eight, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, eleven guns were di&s;charged.</P>
<P>By this fatal manoeuvre, &s;everal were laid dead on the &s;pot, and &s;ome lay &s;truggling for life; but what &s;hewed a degree of cruelty unknown to Briti&s;h troops, at lea&s;t &s;ince the hou&s;e of Hanover has directed their
<PB N="223" REF="229">operations, was an attempt to fire upon, or &s;tab with their bayonets, the per&s;ons who undertook to remove the &s;lain and wounded! At length,</P>
<P>Mr Benjamin Leigh, of the Delph Manufactory, came up, and after &s;ome conver&s;ation with Captain Pre&s;ton, relative to his conduct, advi&s;ed him to draw off his men; with which he complied.</P>
<P>The dead are Mr Samuel Gray, killed on the &s;pot, the ball entering his head and beating off a large por|tion of his &s;kull.</P>
<P>A mulatto man, named Cri&s;pus Attucks, born in Framingham, who was here in order to go for North Carolina, al&s;o killed in&s;tantly: two balls entering his brea&s;t, one of them in &s;pecial goring the right lobe of the lungs, and a great part of the liver mo&s;t hor|ribly.</P>
<P>Mr James Caldwell, mate of Captain Morton's ve&s;|&s;el, in like manner killed by two balls entering his back.</P>
<P>Mr Samuel Maverick, a promi&s;ing youth of &s;even|teen years of age, &s;on of the widow Maverick, mor|tally wounded; a ball went through his belly, and was cut out at his back: he died the next morning.</P>
<P>A lad, named Chri&s;topher Monk, about &s;eventeen years of age, apprentice to Mr Walker, &s;hipwright, wounded; a ball entered his back about four inches above the left kidney, near the &s;pine, and was cut out of the brea&s;t on the &s;ame &s;ide; apprehended he will die.</P>
<P>A lad, named John Clark, about &s;eventeen years of age, who&s;e parents live at Medford, wounded; a ball entered ju&s;t below his groin and came out at his hip, on the oppo&s;ite fide; apprehended he will die.</P>
<P>Mr Edward Payne, of this town, merchant, &s;tand|ing at his entry door, received a ball in his arm, which &s;hattered &s;ome of the bones.</P>
<PB N="224" REF="230">
<P>Mr John Green, taylor, coming up Leverett's-lane, received a ball ju&s;t under his hip, and lodged in the under part of his thigh, which was extracted.</P>
<P>Mr Robert Patter&s;on, a &s;ea-faring man, wounded; a ball went through his right arm, and he &s;uffered great lo&s;s of blood.</P>
<P>Mr Patrick Carr, about thirty years of age, who worked with Mr Field, leather breeches maker, in Queen-&s;treet, wounded; a ball entered near his hip and went out at his &s;ide.</P>
<P>A lad named David Parker, an apprentice to Mr Eddy the wheelwright, wounded; a ball entered his thigh.</P>
<P>The people were immediately alarmed with the re|port of this horrid ma&s;&s;acre, the bells were &s;et a ring|ing, and great numbers &s;oon a&s;&s;embled at the place where this tragical &s;cene had been acted; their feel|ings may be better conceived than expre&s;&s;ed; and while &s;ome were taking care of the dead and wound|ed, the re&s;t were in con&s;ultation what to do in tho&s;e dreadful circum&s;tances. But &s;o little intimidated were they, notwith&s;tanding their being within a few yards of the main-guard, and &s;eeing the 29th regiment un|der arms, and drawn up in King-&s;treet, that they kept their &s;tation, and appeared, as an officer of rank ex|pre&s;&s;ed it, ready to run upon the very muzzles of their mu&s;kets. The lieutenant-governor &s;oon came into the town-hou&s;e, and there met &s;ome of his Maje&s;ty's coun|cil, and a number of civil magi&s;trates; a con&s;iderable body of the people immediately entered the council-chamber, and expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to his honour with a freedom and warmth becoming the occa&s;ion. He u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to pacify them, reque&s;ting that they would let the matter &s;ub&s;ide for the night, and promi&s;ing to do all in his power that ju&s;tice &s;hould be done, and the law have its cour&s;e; men of influ|ence
<PB N="225" REF="231">and weight with the people were not wanting on their part to procure their compliance, by repre|&s;enting the horrible con&s;equence of a promi&s;cuous and ra&s;h engagement in the night. The inhabitants attended to the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, and the regiment un|der arms being ordered to their barracks, they &s;epa|rated and returned to their dwellings by one o'clock. At three o'clock Captain Pre&s;ton was committed to pri&s;on, as were the &s;oldiers who fired, a few hours af|ter him.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day morning pre&s;ented a mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;cene, the blood of our fellow-citizens, running like water through King-&s;treet, and the merchants Exchange, the principal &s;pot of the military parade for about 18 months pa&s;t. Our blood might al&s;o be tracked up to the head of Long Lane, and through divers other &s;treets and pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>At eleven o'clock the inhabitants met at Faneuil-hall, and after &s;ome animated &s;peeches, they cho&s;e a committee of fifteen re&s;pectable gentlemen to wait upon the lieutenant-governor in council, to reque&s;t of him to i&s;&s;ue his orders for the immediate removal of the troops.</P>
<P><HI>Their Me&s;&s;age was,</HI></P>
<P>"That it is the unanimous opinion of this meeting, that the inhabitants and &s;oldiery can no longer live to|gether in &s;afety; that nothing can rationally be ex|pected to re&s;tore the peace of the town, and prevent further blood and carnage, but the immediate removal of the troops; and that we therefore mo&s;t fervently pray his honour that his power and influence may be exerted for their in&s;tant removal."</P>
<P><HI>The Governor replied:</HI></P>
<P>"I am extremely &s;orry for the unhappy differences between the inhabitants and troops, and e&s;pecially
<PB N="226" REF="232">for the action of the la&s;t evening, and I have exerted my&s;elf upon that occa&s;ion that a due enquiry may be made, and that the law may have its cour&s;e. I have in council con&s;ulted with the commanding officers of the two regiments who are in the town. They have their orders from the general at New-York. It is not in my power to countermand tho&s;e orders. The council have de&s;ired that the two regiments may be removed to the ca&s;tle. From the particular concern which the 29th regiment has had in your differences, Colonel Dalrymple, who is the commanding officer of the troops, has &s;ignified that that regiment &s;hall, without delay, be placed in the barracks at the ca&s;tle, until he can &s;end to the general and receive his fur|ther orders concerning both the regiments, and that the main-guard &s;hall be removed, and the 14th regi|ment &s;o di&s;po&s;ed and laid under &s;uch re&s;traint, that all occa&s;ion of future di&s;turbances may be prevented."</P>
<P>The foregoing reply having been read and fully con&s;idered&mdash;the que&s;tion was put, Whether the re|port be &s;atisfactory? It pa&s;&s;ed in the negative (only one di&s;&s;entient) out of upwards of 4000 voters.</P>
<P>It was then moved, that John Hancock, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Mr Samuel Adams, Mr William Molineux, William Phil|lips, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Dr Jo&s;eph Warren, Jo&s;hua Hen&s;haw, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Samuel Pemberton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> be a committee to wait on his Honour the Lieutenant-governor, and inform him, that the reply made to the vote of the inhabitants is by no means &s;atisfactory; and that nothing le&s;s will &s;atisfy them, than a total and immediate removal of all the troops.</P>
<P>The committee having waited upon the lieutenant-governor, his Honour laid before the board a vote of the town of Bo&s;ton, pa&s;&s;ed this afternoon, and then addre&s;&s;ed the board as follows:</P>
<PB N="227" REF="233">
<P>"I lay before you a vote of the town of Bo&s;ton, which I have ju&s;t now received from them, and I now a&s;k your advice, what you judge nece&s;&s;ary to be done upon it."</P>
<P>The council thereupon expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> of opinion, "that it was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, the good order of the town, and the peace of the province, that the troops &s;hould be immediately removed out of the town of Bo&s;ton; with which opinion Colonel Dal|rymple gave his word of honour that he would ac|quie&s;ce."</P>
<P>Upon the above report, the inhabitants expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction; and after mea&s;ures were ta|ken for the &s;ecurity of the town, the meeting was di&s;|&s;olved.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion was made through Bo|&s;ton at the funeral of the four murdered youths. On this occa&s;ion all the &s;hops were &s;hut up, all the bells in the town were ordered to toll, as were tho&s;e in the neighbouring towns, and the bodies that moved from different quarters of the town, met at the fatal place of action, and were carried together through the main &s;treets, followed by the greate&s;t concour&s;e of people ever known, all te&s;tifying the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible grief, to a vault provided for them in the middle of the great burying-ground.</P>
<P>From the time of this fatal tragedy, a military guard of town militia has been con&s;tantly kept in the town-hou&s;e and town-pri&s;on, at which &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens have done duty as common &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this affair, the inhabitants of Roxburgh petitioned the Lieutenant-governor Hutch|in&s;on
<PB N="228" REF="234">to remove the troops from Bo&s;ton; and recei|ved for an&s;wer, <HI>That he had no authority to order the King's troops from any place where they are po&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty's order;</HI> at the &s;ame time he acquainted them with what had been done with the concurrence of the commanding officer.</P>
<P>Captain Pre&s;ton's own account will &s;et this matter in its full light.</P>
<P>It is matter of too great notority to need any proofs, that the arrival of his Maje&s;ty's troops in Bo&s;ton was extremely obnoxious to its inhabitants. They have ever u&s;ed all means in their power to weaken the re|giments, and to bring them into contempt, by promo|ting and aiding de&s;ertions, and with impunity, even where there has been the cleare&s;t evidence of the fact, and by gro&s;sly and fal&s;ely propagating untruths concerning them. On the arrival of the 64th and 65th, their ardour &s;eemingly began to abate; it be|ing too exten&s;ive to buy off &s;o many; and attempts of that kind rendered too dangerous from the num|bers. But the &s;ame &s;pirit revived immediately on its being known that tho&s;e regiments were ordered for Hallifax, and hath ever &s;ince their departure been breaking out with greater violence. After their em|barkation, one of their ju&s;tices, thoroughly acquaint|ed with the people and their intentions, on the trial of the 14th regiment, openly and publicly, in the hearing of great numbers of people, and from the &s;eat of ju&s;tice, declared, "that the &s;oldiers mu&s;t now take care of them&s;elves, <HI>nor tru&s;t too much to their arms,</HI> for they were but a handful; that the inhabitants car|ried weapons concealed under their cloaths, and would de&s;troy them in a moment <HI>if they plea&s;ed.</HI>" This; con&s;idering the malicious temper of the people, was an alarming circum&s;tance to the &s;oldiery. Since which
<PB N="229" REF="235">&s;everal di&s;putes have happened between the towns-people and &s;oldiers of both regiments, the former being encouraged thereto by the countenance of even &s;ome of the magi&s;trates, and by the protection of all the party again&s;t government. In general &s;uch di&s;|putes have been kept too &s;ecret from the officers. On the 2d of March, two of the 29th going through one Gray's rope-walk, the rope-makers in&s;ultingly a&s;ked them if they would empty a vault. This un|fortunately had the de&s;ired effect, by provoking the &s;oldiers, and from words they went to blows. Both parties &s;uffered in this affray, and finally the &s;oldiers retired to their quarters. The officers, on the fir&s;t knowledge of this tran&s;action, took every precaution in their power to prevent any ill con&s;equences. Not|with&s;tanding which, &s;ingle quarrels could not be pre|vented; the inhabitants con&s;tantly provoking and abu&s;ing the &s;oldiery. The in&s;olence, as well as utter hatred of the inhabitants to the troops, increa&s;ed dai|ly; in&s;omuch, that Monday and Tue&s;day, the 5th and 6th in&s;tant, were privately agreed on for a general engagement; in con&s;equence of which, &s;everal of the militia came from the country, armed to join their friends, menacing to de&s;troy any who &s;hould oppo&s;e them. This plan has &s;ince been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>On Monday night, about eight o'clock, two &s;oldiers were attacked and beat. But the party of the town&s;|people, in order to carry matters to the utmo&s;t length, broke into two meeting hou&s;es and rang the alarm bells, which I &s;uppo&s;ed was for fire as u&s;ual, but was &s;oon undeceived. About nine &s;ome of the guard came to and informed me, that the town inhabitants were a&s;|&s;embling to attack the troops, and that the bells were ringing as the &s;ignal for that purpo&s;e, and not for fire, and the beacon intended to be fired to bring in the
<PB N="230" REF="236">di&s;tant people of the country. This, as I was captain of the day, occa&s;ioned my repairing immediately to the main-guard. In my way there I &s;aw the people in great commotion, and heard them u&s;e the mo&s;t cruel and horrid threats again&s;t the troops. In a few minutes after I reached the guard, about an hundred people pa&s;&s;ed it, and went towards the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, where the King's money is lodged. They immedi|ately &s;urrounded the centinel po&s;ted there, and with clubs and other weapons threatened to execute their vengeance on him. I was &s;oon informed by a town&s;|man, their intention was to carry off the &s;oldier from his po&s;t, and probably murder him. On which I de|&s;ired him to return for further intelligence; and he &s;oon came back and a&s;&s;ured me he heard the mob de|clare they would murder him. This I feared might be a prelude to their plundering the King's che&s;t. I immediately &s;ent a non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer and twelve men to protect both the centinel and the King's money, and very &s;oon followed my&s;elf, to prevent (if po&s;&s;ible) all di&s;order; fearing le&s;t the officer and &s;ol|diery by the in&s;ults and provocations of the rioters &s;hould be thrown off their guard and commit &s;ome ra&s;h act. They &s;oon ru&s;hed through the people, and, by charging their bayonets in half circle, kept them at a little di&s;tance. Nay, &s;o far was I from intending the death of any per&s;on, that I &s;uffered the troops to go to the &s;pot where the unhappy affair took place, with|out any loading in their pieces, nor did I ever give orders for loading them. This remi&s;s conduct in me perhaps merits cen&s;ure; yet it is evidence, re&s;ulting from the nature of things, which is the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t that can be offered, that my intention was not to act offen&s;ively, but the contrary part, and that not with|out compul&s;ion. The mob &s;till increa&s;ed, and were
<PB N="231" REF="237">more outrages, &s;triking their clubs or bludgeons one again&s;t another, and calling out, 'Come on, you Ra&s;|cals, you bloody Backs, you Lob&s;ter Scoundrels; fire if you dare, G&mdash; damn you, fire and be damn'd; we know you dare not;' and much more &s;uch lan|guage was u&s;ed. At this time I was between the &s;ol|diers and the mob, parleying with and endeavouring all in my power to per&s;uade them to retire peaceably; but to no purpo&s;e. They advanced to the points of the bayonets, &s;truck &s;ome of them, and even the muz|zles of the pieces, and &s;eemed to be endeavouring to clo&s;e with the &s;oldiers. On which &s;ome well-beha|ved per&s;ons a&s;ked me if the guns were charged; I replied, yes. They then a&s;ked me if I intended to order the men to fire; I an&s;wered no, by no means; ob&s;erving to them, that I was advanced before the muzzles of the men's pieces, and mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice if they fired; and that the &s;oldiers were upon the half-cock and charged bayonets, and my giving the word fire, on tho&s;e circu&s;tamces, would prove me no offi|cer. While I was thus &s;peaking, one of the &s;oldiers, having received a &s;evere blow with a &s;tick, &s;tepped a little on one &s;ide, and in&s;tantly fired; on which turn|ing to, and a&s;king him why he fired without orders, I was &s;truck with a club on my arm, which for &s;ome time deprived me of the u&s;e of it; which blow, had it been placed on my head, mo&s;t brobably would have de&s;troyed me. On this a general attack was made on the men by a great number of heavy clubs, and &s;now-balls being thrown at them, by which all our lives were in imminent danger; &s;ome per&s;ons at the &s;ame time from behind calling out, "Damn your bloods, why do not you fire?' In&s;tantly three or four of the &s;oldiers fired, one after another, and directly after three more in the &s;ame confu&s;ion and hurry.</P>
<PB N="232" REF="238">
<P>The mob then ran away, except three unhappy men who in&s;tantly expired, in which number was Mr Gray, at who&s;e rope-walk the prior quarrel took place; one more is &s;ince dead, three others are dan|gerou&s;ly, and four &s;lightly wounded. The whole of this melancholy affair was tran&s;acted in almo&s;t twenty minutes. On my a&s;king the &s;oldiers why they fired without orders, they &s;aid they heard the word 'Fire,' and &s;uppo&s;ed it came from me. This might be the ca&s;e, as many of the mob called out, 'Fire, fire,' but I a&s;&s;ured the men that I gave no &s;uch order, that my words were, 'Don't fire, &s;top your firing:' In &s;hort, it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for the &s;oldiers to know who &s;aid fire, or don't fire, or &s;top your firing. On the peo|ple's a&s;&s;embling again to take away the dead bodies, the &s;oldiers, &s;uppo&s;ing them coming to attack them, were making ready to fire again, which I prevented by &s;triking up their firelocks with my hand. Imme|diately after a town&s;man came and told me, that 4 or 5000 people were a&s;&s;embled in the next &s;treet, and had &s;worn to take my life with every man's with me; on which I judged it un&s;afe to remain there any long|er, and therefore &s;ent the party and centry to the main-guard, and when they arrived there, telling them off into &s;treet firings, divided and planted them at each end of the &s;treet to &s;ecure their rear, mo|mently expecting an attack, as there was a con&s;tant cry of the inhabitants, 'To arms, to arms&mdash;turn out with your guns,' and the town drums beating to arms. I ordered my drum to beat to arms, and being &s;oon af|ter joined by the different companies of the 29th re|giment, I formed them as the guard into &s;treet firings. The 14th regiment al&s;o got under arms, but remain|ed at their barracks. I immediately &s;ent a &s;erjeant with a party to Colonel Dalrymple, the commanding
<PB N="233" REF="239">officer, to acquaint him-with every particular. Se|veral officers going to join their regiment were knock|ed down by the mob, one very much wounded, and his &s;word taken from him. The lieutenant-governor and Colonel Carr, were &s;oon after met at the head of the 29th regiment, and agreed that the regiment &s;hould retire to their barracks, and the people to their hou&s;es; but I kept the piquet to &s;trengthen the guard. It was with great difficulty that the Lieute|nant-governor prevailed on the people to be quiet and retire: at la&s;t they all went off, excepting about a hundred.</P>
<P>A council was immediately called, on the breaking up of which, three ju&s;tices met, and i&s;&s;ued a warrant to apprehend me and eight &s;oldiers. On hearing of this procedure, I in&s;tantly went to the &s;heriff, and &s;urrendered my&s;elf, though for the &s;pace of four hours I had it in my power to have made my e&s;cape, which I mo&s;t undoubtedly &s;hould have attempted, and could ea&s;ily have executed, had I been the lea&s;t con&s;cious of any guilt. On the examination before the ju&s;ti|ces, two witne&s;&s;es &s;wore that I gave the men orders to fire; the one te&s;tified he was within two feet of me; the other, that I &s;wore at the men for not &s;iring at the fir&s;t word. Others &s;wore they heard me u&s;e the word, fire; but whether do or do not fire, they could not &s;ay; others, that they heard the word fire, but could not &s;ay if it came from me. The next day they got five or &s;ix more to &s;wear I gave the word to fire. So bitter and inveterate are many of the male-contents here, that they are indu&s;triou&s;ly u&s;ing every method to fi&s;h out evidence to prove it was a concert|ed &s;cheme to murder the inhabitants. Others are in|fu&s;ing the utmo&s;t malice and revenge into the minds of the people, who are to be my jurors, by fal&s;e pub|lications,
<PB N="234" REF="240">votes of towns, and all other artifices. That &s;o, from a &s;ettled rancour again&s;t the officers and troops in general, the &s;uddenne&s;s of my trial af|ter the affair, while the people's minds are greatly inflamed, I am, though perfectly innocent, under mo&s;t unhappy circum&s;tances, having nothing in rea|&s;on to expect, but the lo&s;s of life in a very ignomini|ous manner, without the interpo&s;ition of his Maje&s;ty's ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Here ends Captain Pre&s;ton's account, to which may be added his trial, which began on Wedne&s;day the 24th of October, and was continued from day to day, Sunday excepted, till Tue&s;day the 30th. The witne&s;&s;es who were examined on both &s;ides amounted to about 50. The lawyers for the crown were Mr Barne and Mr Samuel Quincy; for the pri&s;oner, Mr Auchmuty and Mr John Adams. Each of them &s;poke three hours at lea&s;t. About Monday noon the judges began their charge. Judge Trowbridge, who &s;poke fir&s;t, entered largely into the contradictory accounts, given by the witne&s;&s;es, and declared, that it did not appear that the pri&s;oner gave orders to fire; but if the jury &s;hould think otherwi&s;e, and find it proved that he did give &s;uch orders, the que&s;tion then would naturally be, What crime is he guilty of? They &s;ure|ly could not call it murder.&mdash;Here he explained the crime of murder in a very di&s;tinct manner, and gave it as his opinion, that by law the pri&s;oner was not guil|ty of murder; ob&s;erving, that the King had a right to &s;end his troops here; that the commanding officer of the&s;e troops had a right to place a centinel at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e? that the centinel placed there on the night of the 5th of March was in the King's peace; that he dur&s;t not quit his po&s;t; that if he was in&s;ulted or attacked, the captain of the guard had a right to
<PB N="235" REF="241">protect him; that the pri&s;oner and his party, who came there for that purpo&s;e, were in the King's peace; that while they were at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of protecting the centinel, it was plainly proved that they had been a&s;&s;aulted by a great num|ber of people; that the people a&s;&s;embled there were not in the King's peace, but were by law con&s;idered as a riotous mob, as they attacked the pri&s;oner and his party with pieces of ice, &s;ticks, and clubs; and that even one of the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him confe&s;&s;ed he was armed with a Highland broad&s;word; that the rioters had knocked down one of the &s;oldiers of the party, laid hold of &s;everal of their mu&s;kets, and that, before the &s;oldiers fired, the cry was, Knock them down! Kill them! Kill them! That all this was &s;worn to by the witne&s;&s;es, and if the jury believed them, the pri&s;oner could not be found guilty of murder. He then proceeded to explain what the law con&s;idered as man-&s;laughter, and ob&s;erved, as before, that if they gave credit to the witne&s;&s;es, who te&s;tified the a&s;&s;aults made on the pri&s;oner and his party, they could not find him guilty of man-&s;laughter, and concluded with &s;aying, that if he was guilty of any offence, it could only be excu&s;able homicide; that this was only found|ed on the &s;uppo&s;ition of the pri&s;oner's having given orders to fire, for if this was not proved, they mu&s;t acquit him.</P>
<P>Judge Oliver, who &s;poke next, began with repre|&s;enting, in a very nervous and pathetic manner, the in&s;ults and outrages which he, and the court, through him, had received on a former occa&s;ion (meaning the trial of Richard&s;on) for giving his opinion in a point of law; that, notwith&s;tanding, he was re&s;olved to do his duty to his God, his King, and his country; that he de&s;pi&s;ed both in&s;ults and threats, and that he would
<PB N="236" REF="242">not forego a moment's peace of con&s;cience for the applau&s;e of millions. He agreed in &s;entiment with the former judge, that the pri&s;oner was not guilty.</P>
<P>Judge Cu&s;hing &s;poke next, and agreed entirely with the other two, with regard to the pri&s;oner's ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Judge Lyndex concluded. He &s;poke a con&s;ider|able time, and was of the &s;ame opinion with the other judges. Towards the clo&s;e of his &s;peech, he &s;aid, "Happy I am to find, that, after &s;uch &s;trict examina|tion, the conduct of the pri&s;oner appears in &s;o fair a light; yet I feel my&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, deeply af|fected, that this affair turns out &s;o much to the di&s;|grace of every per&s;on concerned again&s;t him, and &s;o much to the &s;hame of the town in general." The jury then returned their verdict, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> He was immediately di&s;charged, and is now in the ca&s;tle. Great numbers attended during the trial, which was carried on with a &s;olemn decency.</P>
<P>As one evil generally introduces another, during the time of the&s;e commotions on the continent of A|merica, a &s;et of lawle&s;s ruffians in Orange county, Carolina, broke out into open violence, and &s;et all law and government at defiance. They called them|&s;elves Regulators, and committed many wicked and cruel outrages. Their principal aver&s;ion was direct|ed again&s;t courts of ju&s;tice, and gentlemen of the law, to whom they &s;hewed all manner of de&s;pite and con|tempt. When Judge Hender&s;on and &s;everal lawyers were returning from Sali&s;bury circuit to Hill&s;borough to hold the court there, they lay in wait for them, with rifle guns to di&s;patch them; but the Judge re|ceiving intelligence of their de&s;ign, went another way, and by that means pre&s;erved his own life, and that of his attendants. They &s;till threatened to meet him at
<PB N="237" REF="243">Hill&s;borough, and to execute their vengeance on him and his company there. They put their threatenings in execution, and in a mo&s;t mercile&s;s and cruel man|ner treated Colonel Fanning, Mr Hooper, and &s;ome others. I hey de&s;ired the judge to proceed, but ac|cording as they directed him, and put a &s;top to all proceedings of ju&s;tice. The judge e&s;caped with dif|ficulty, by &s;ecretly withdrawing, which put them in|to a great rage, and provoked them to &s;uch a degree, that they plundered and de&s;troyed all the furniture in Colonel Fanning's hou&s;e, &s;eized all his papers and books, and &s;cattered them in the wind; they al&s;o carried off all his money and plate, drank plentifully of his liquors, and &s;et the re&s;t a-running in the &s;treets. They next broke the church bell in pieces, and were going to pull down the church, but in this they did not agree. To fini&s;h their tragedy, they took a ne|gro that was hanging in chains, and placed him in the judges chair, to &s;hew their entire contempt of all ju&s;tice. Such is the dangerous tendency of commo|tions in government; under the &s;hadow and pretence of pur&s;uing their own privileges, mi&s;chievous and wicked men often de&s;pi&s;e all legal government, and plunder their fellow &s;ubjects. The reports concern|ing the riot at Bo&s;ton had now reached England, which made it nece&s;&s;ary for parliament to enquire in|to the cau&s;es and rea&s;ons of that unfortunate affair. The mini&s;try appeared &s;hy on this occa&s;ion, for though two regiments were &s;hut up in Ca&s;tle William, without any order from government, which was no &s;mall affront to the mini&s;ter and the court, yet they were afraid to enter upon an enquiry, for fear of the oppo&s;ition in&s;i&s;ting upon an enquiry concerning the whole affair. It was thought that government ima|gined, by &s;uffering the matter to hang in &s;u&s;pence,
<PB N="238" REF="244">that the coloni&s;ts would divide and fall out among them&s;elves, and &s;o make the bu&s;ine&s;s of the mini&s;try more ea&s;y. In this they were, however, mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>A motion was made, upon the 8th of May, for an addre&s;s to the throne, &s;etting forth the di&s;putes that had ari&s;en among the &s;everal governors and command|ers, in almo&s;t all the colonies &s;ince the appointment of a commander in chief; that the colonies have been for &s;ome time, and &s;till are, from this and other cau&s;e, in a &s;tate of great di&s;order and con|fu&s;ion; that the people of America complain of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an army there, as &s;etting up a milita|ry government over the civil; and therefore praying that all the&s;e matters may be con&s;idered, and &s;uch mea&s;ures taken as would replace things upon a con|&s;titutional footing. This motion was introduced by ob&s;erving, that in the pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation of af|fairs, they were expre&s;sly called upon to enquire, how the mini&s;ters here, no le&s;s than their officers there, have managed &s;o unfortunately, as to kindle the pre&s;ent flame of di&s;&s;ention between the mother country and the colonies. That in fulfilling this duty, they mu&s;t not only con&s;ider the matter of fact, but the right of things: not only the turbulence of the Americans, but the cau&s;e of that turbulence: and not only the power of the crown, but the equity with which that power has been exerci&s;ed. This was a motion that was not likely to be carried in a hou&s;e where the mini&s;ter had a powerful majority. It met with the fate of many others of the like nature, and had a negative put upon it. Upon reflection, one can|not help thinking it &s;trange, that men who are em|ployed in bu&s;ine&s;s, and manage it fairly, &s;hould have &s;uch an aver&s;ion to having their conduct examined. A refu&s;al of this &s;ort always implies, either &s;ome de|fect

<P>In the debates on this occa&s;ion, the mini&s;teriali&s;ts made a poor figure; after ages, when calmly reading the debates in this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, will be filled with a&s;toni&s;hment, to find, that in a matter of &s;o much con&s;equence, there &s;hould have been any occa&s;ion for debate at all; and it will equally amaze them, unle&s;s they are equally corrupted, to view the defences of admini&s;tration, of a cau&s;e, which none, except men of corrupt minds, and de&s;titute of all &s;en&s;e of honour, &s;hame, and humanity, would attempt to maintain. The mini&s;try were on this occa&s;ion charged with tergiver&s;ation, and want of &s;y&s;tem. It was affirmed that they had &s;ent contradictory orders to the gover|nors in the colonies, and made their &s;ervants blunder like them&s;elves, for want of a &s;ettled plan of opera|tion; that they had impo&s;ed taxes, and repealed them, impo&s;ed them, and repealed them again; di&s;&s;olved a&s;|&s;emblies, and called them again, and &s;uffered them to &s;it and proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, without di&s;avowing or di&s;|countenancing the mea&s;ures that had procured their di&s;&s;olution. Promi&s;es had been made to the a&s;&s;em|blies, that certain duties &s;hould be taken off, and re|pealed; which were unwarrantable, of dangerous con|&s;equence, and an high breach of privilege; and that it was equally derogatory from the honour of the crown, and freedom of parliamentary deliberations, to have its faith pledged to perform &s;uch promi&s;es. Troops had been &s;ent, driven out with di&s;grace, and violence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion had alternately &s;ucceeded one another; that trea&s;ons had been charged and adopt|ed by parliament, which were neither proved, nor attempted to be proved: or if they exi&s;ted, were
<PB N="240" REF="247">they attempted to be detected and puni&s;hed, which was an high reflection upon the dignity of parliament. This &s;ort of rea&s;oning had no influence; the mini&s;try with a &s;ort of &s;toical indifference, bore all with pa|tience, without attempting even to make their u&s;ual defence. A few reflections, for the &s;ake of form, were thrown out again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, as turbulent, di&s;loyal, and di&s;affected to the government of this country, and people that wanted to be independent of Great Britain. It was a&s;&s;erted that the crown had a right to &s;end troops to any part of the empire, and &s;tation them there according to plea&s;ure; and that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of employing them at that time, for &s;upporting the progre&s;s of the laws, a|gain&s;t a people that were nearly in a &s;tate of rebel|lion. The&s;e reflections were only thrown out as hints, without any particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, rather to get clear of the debate for the pre&s;ent, than as arguments intended to convince the oppo&s;ite party of the propriety of the rea&s;oning. Tho&s;e that are guided by the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, and plain arguments mu&s;t not expect them from the mini&s;try at this time. Even their champions, who undertook to defend their mea&s;ures in long laboured di&s;&s;ertations upon government, and the rights of &s;upreme powers to rule over all their dominions with ab&s;olute &s;way, were in great di&s;tre&s;s to find principles and conclu&s;ions which plain men could under&s;tand. Many dark and di&s;mal productions teemed from the pre&s;s, &s;tuffed with arbitrary conclu&s;ions, void of all po&s;&s;ibility of demon&s;tration. The&s;e were echoed by the hirelings of the mini&s;try as unan&s;werable productions, though tho&s;e who trumpeted their fame mo&s;t, did not under|&s;tand a word that was in them. They were intend|ed to throw mi&s;t in the eyes of the public, to cover
<PB N="241" REF="248">de&s;igns that could not be decently avowed openly, and this was all that the authors could propo&s;e, except their pen&s;ions, which they greedily expected. After all the du&s;t of the &s;choolmen, and ca&s;ui&s;ts had been &s;wept together, and thrown in the eyes of the peo|ple, the majority &s;till pre&s;erved their &s;ight, and per|ceived the de&s;igns of the mini&s;try. It would be the greate&s;t in&s;ult to truth and common &s;en&s;e, to affirm that the arguments on both &s;ides were of equal force. There were many ab&s;urd things &s;aid on both &s;ides, as will often happen in the cour&s;e of di&s;putation, but in forming an e&s;timate of the force of the arguments, a man of very plain under&s;tanding will be at no lo&s;s &s;et|ting a&s;ide private intere&s;t and prejudice, which way to determine. Tho&s;e who attempt to defend the proceedings of either party in all particulars, will find it a ta&s;k not ea&s;ily to be performed; and it will &s;hew more of partiality than good &s;en&s;e, to affirm that there were not errors on both &s;ides. It is a part of our natural infelicity which has prevailed for &s;ome time pa&s;t, that parties in oppo&s;ition have been for defending their own proceedings, when they have to|tally given up the principles by which they only could be defended; and by departing from the true prin|ciples of charity, have made no allowances for the prejudices and weakne&s;s of their opponents. What has much aggravated this evil is, that in the various di&s;putes upon this &s;ubject, the moral &s;ide of the que|&s;tion has been but little con&s;idered. Sy&s;tems of po|licy, or of government, without morality, are like a body without a &s;pirit, only dead and beggarly ele|ments, generated by corruption, and &s;upported by ob|&s;tinacy. Moral privileges are by the laws of nature as much the right of rational creatures, as tho&s;e that come under the notion of political; and human policy, with|out
<PB N="242" REF="249">being built upon moral principles, will in the end become like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, vani&s;h and not leave a wreck behind it. The be&s;t founda|tion of government and policy, is truth; without this they will always turn to oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> A view of the fir&s;t War between the Coloni&s;ts and the Natives&mdash;The taking of Acadia&mdash;An attempt upon Quebec, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE are &s;carcely &s;ufficiently informed by the an|nals of tho&s;e times concerning the true cau&s;es and &s;prings of the fir&s;t Indian war. The war it&s;elf is &s;uf|ficiently de&s;cribed, though the cau&s;es &s;till in a great mea&s;ure lie hid. Two things &s;eem to have given ri&s;e to tho&s;e bloody and cruel mea&s;ures; the covetou&s;ne&s;s of the coloni&s;ts, and the treachery of the French. The new coloni&s;ts frequently in the extending their terri|tories, did not &s;trictly ob&s;erve the lines which bound|ed their new acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and frequently were found making encroachments upon the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of the original natives, which though they were very incon&s;iderable, were magnified by the French emmi&s;&s;aries, who were &s;cattered among the Indians, as the mo&s;t atrocious acts of inju&s;tice and iniquity. The&s;e emmi&s;&s;aries &s;tirred up the Indians, who were not ill to irritate again&s;t a people for whom they had but little regard, and again&s;t whom their own private intere&s;t inclined them to believe the &s;malle&s;t accu&s;a|tions. What added much to the di&s;gu&s;t the natives had again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, and created in their minds a very &s;trong antipathy again&s;t them, was the prac|tice
<PB N="244" REF="251">of &s;ome occa&s;ional traders, who came upon their coa&s;ts without de&s;ign of &s;ettling. The&s;e, upon occa|&s;ions, committed depredations, and enticed &s;ome of the Indians aboard their &s;hips, and carried them to Europe, and &s;old them for &s;laves. The natives who con&s;idered tho&s;e free-booters as friends and connec|tions of the coloni&s;ts, mutually engaged in the &s;ame de&s;igns of plunder and depredation, were determined to extirpate this new race of people, as enemies to all their common and natural rights. Their minds could not &s;ugge&s;t any other rea&s;on why they came to &s;ettle among them, except to invade their rights, and &s;eize their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Being ignorant of their lan|guage, and incapable of under&s;tanding on a &s;udden their &s;igns and &s;ignatures of expre&s;&s;ion, they inter|preted the whole as tokens of ho&s;tility, or &s;igns of di&s;|&s;imulation.</P>
<P>The writers of the Hi&s;tory of New England have drawn the characters of the Indians of tho&s;e times in the mo&s;t frightful and forboding colours. They have repre&s;ented them as wor&s;hippers of the devil, and as true &s;ubjects of the prince of the power of the air.&mdash;Cruel, barbarous, unmerciful, and unrelenting. Among the various tribes of the&s;e infidel &s;avages, none were more powerful, warlike, and formidable than the nation of the <HI>Pequots,</HI> which lay between the <HI>Naragan&s;ets</HI> and the <HI>Mohgenas.</HI> This tribe had now become a terror not only to the new &s;ettlers, but to the other tribes of Indians in their neighbourhood, on account of their power, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion. Their arms were almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible, and their power intolerable; and the late thefts and pillagings of the Engli&s;h free-booters had encrea&s;ed their rage to the highe&s;t degree of revenge and re&s;entment. It was no wonder that the coloni&s;ts, when they fell in their
<PB N="245" REF="252">way, felt the effects of their unbridled fury and re|venge.</P>
<P>In the year 1634, an open rupture began between the&s;e fierce natives and the coloni&s;ts. A party of In|dians attacked Captain Stone and Captain Norton, when they were &s;ailing up the river Connecticut, and killed them, with &s;ix men who were in company, and &s;unk the ve&s;&s;el in the river. Hi&s;torians do not inform us whether the&s;e gentlemen were &s;ailing within the boundaries of the colony, or were for the &s;ake of fi&s;hing, or for &s;ome other rea&s;ons, beyond the line of agreement. It was a practice &s;o frequently pur&s;ued by the coloni&s;ts, to proceed beyond the bounds of their purcha&s;e, that the natives often complained of the encroachments which they made upon their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions. Whatever was the cau&s;e of the&s;e ho&s;tilities, the truth is, that the Indians began now to take a mo&s;t &s;evere revenge. The&s;e &s;avages attacked the crew of a ve&s;&s;el that were ca&s;t upon Long I&s;land, and killed &s;everal of the men; and in 1636, they boarded a &s;hip near Block I&s;land, killed the captain, and com|mitted &s;everal more outrages. The coloni&s;ts finding that this Indian war turned more &s;erious than they expected, began to con&s;ider upon &s;ome &s;uitable me|thods of defence, as well as offen&s;ive projects, to an|noy tho&s;e cruel and barbarous a&s;&s;ailants. The go|vernor and council of Bo&s;ton &s;ent an hundred and twenty men, under the command of the Captains Endicot, Underhill, and Turner;&mdash;who boldly at|tacked the Indians, who left their huts, and retired to the &s;wamps and woods for their &s;afety and pre&s;er|vation. Before this army proceeded any further, they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Pequots, de&s;iring them to deliver up the murderers, who were the occa&s;ion of the war, that the innocent might not be involved
<PB N="246" REF="253">with the guilty in the calamity of war. The&s;e fierce and furious people either con&s;idered their cau&s;e to be ju&s;t, or were determined, at all events, to &s;upport their brethren in the cau&s;e they were now engaged in. They would li&s;ten to no propo&s;als of accommo|dation, but were determined to carry on the war. Their refu&s;al brought on a &s;kirmi&s;h, in which the na|tives were defeated, and all their huts in that part of the country, and their corn were de&s;troyed. The&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes were only prefaces to a more bloody war that now followed, which was carried on with great fury and bararity on the &s;ide of the natives. The pri&s;oners which fell into their hands, were tortured in the mo&s;t &s;hocking and inhuman manner, and put to all the extremities of pain that wanton barbarity could devi&s;e. Maids and children were roa&s;ted alive, and the barbarous &s;avages all the while mocking their pains, and ridiculing their ge&s;tures and expre&s;|&s;ions of agony.</P>
<P>This nation of Pequots joined policy and craft to their barbarity and cruelty; they at this time devi&s;ed a &s;cheme, which had it taken place, mu&s;t have total|ly de&s;troyed all the infant colonies. They &s;ent Talks to all the various tribes of Indians of their acquaint|ance, &s;etting forth the nece&s;&s;ity of an a&s;&s;ociation among them&s;elves, to extirpate this new race of people, which might be ea&s;ily done, by a confederacy of the various tribes, before the coloni&s;ts were provided for a defence, or were grown &s;trong by an encrea&s;e of their numbers; that by one deci&s;ive blow, they had it now in their power to free them&s;elves of neigh|bours, who, if they were not at this time &s;ubdued, would a in &s;hort time become their ma&s;ters, and de|prive them of all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. This was a mo&s;t judicious and political &s;cheme, and would have pro|ved
<PB N="247" REF="254">the total ruin of the New England colonies. This &s;cheme was however fru&s;trated, by providence, through the antipathy of the re&s;t of the tribes to the&s;e Pequots. The other Indian nations had &s;uf|fered &s;o &s;everely at the hands of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors, that they were determined to leave them to them&s;elves, and the event of the war which they were engaged in. They took plea&s;ure in &s;eeing a people cru&s;hed, that had behaved &s;o tyrannically to the re&s;t of their brethren; and in&s;tead of affording them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, indulged a &s;ecret plea&s;ure at their ruin and de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts knowing both the power and enmity of the&s;e &s;avages, rai&s;ed forces with all expedition for their own defence, with a de&s;ign, if po&s;&s;ible, to put an end to the war, by extirpating that revengeful tribe of Indians. With an army of about 700 men, of which 500 were Indians of the Naragan&s;et tribes, the re&s;t were coloni&s;ts, they advanced to the enemy's country. Their commanders were I&s;rael Stoughton, Captain Underhill, and Captain John Ma&s;on. Un|derhill and Ma&s;on marched before the other troops could join them, and advanced in &s;earch of Sa&s;&s;acus, the grand Sachem of the Pequots, who had retired with his men into what he thought an impregnable fortre&s;s. The Naragan&s;et Indians, upon hearing of the name of Sa&s;&s;acus, fell a trembling, and would not advance; they &s;aid he was a god, and no man could kill him: They were therefore of no u&s;e in this expedition. The officers with their &s;mall hand|ful of troops, under the direction of an Indian &s;py, which they had &s;ent to &s;earch for the Pequots, came upon them by &s;urpri&s;e, and entered their fort &s;word in hand; after making prodigious &s;laughter among the &s;avages, they &s;et fire to the fort, and totally de|&s;troyed
<PB N="248" REF="255">it. On this occa&s;ion, &s;ix hundred Indians of the tribe of Pequots were &s;lain, and only two men of the co|loni&s;ts. Of the whole forces in this fort only eight e&s;ca|ped to carry the tidings of the di&s;a&s;ter to their friends. The heat of the action, and the want of provi&s;ion had now greatly exhau&s;ted the &s;trength of the coloni&s;ts, which would have proved fatal to them, had not &s;ome ve&s;&s;els arrived with provi&s;ions in Pequot harbour in the very time of need, and in the mid&s;t of their di&s;|tre&s;s. This &s;upply refre&s;hed their &s;pirits, and pre|pared them for another &s;harp encounter which &s;oon happened. There was another Indian fort at &s;ome di&s;tance, whither the news had been carried of the defeat of their troops, and the de&s;truction of their fort: In this &s;ort of fortre&s;s, there were upwards of three hundred &s;avages of the be&s;t troops of the Pequots. The&s;e advanced with all expedition to re|venge the death of their friends, and attacked the coloni&s;ts with great fury. But they met with &s;uch a warm reception, that they betook them&s;elves to a &s;wamp, after leaving a great number dead upon the &s;pot. The former defeat of their friends, and the re|pul&s;e they now met with, in a great mea&s;ure damped their courage, they expre&s;&s;ed their chagrin and di&s;|appointment with mo&s;t pitiful howling and cries, ac|cording to the manner of their country. By this time the Captains Patrick and Stoughton came up with the forces of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets bay, which was a &s;ea&s;onable reinforcement to the Connecticut forces, which were now both much fatigued, and many of them wounded in the two foregoing &s;kirmi&s;hes. There were &s;till a great number of the Pequot &s;avages &s;cat|tered in different parties, concealed in &s;wamps and thickets, lying ready to take the fir&s;t opportunity of revenge; but when they perceived this new reinforce|ment
<PB N="249" REF="256">of the coloni&s;ts, they fled to the fort where Sa&s;|&s;acus had taken refuge, and upbraided him as the cau&s;e of the late di&s;a&s;ters, and of their total ruin. Se|veral hundreds of the&s;e mi&s;erable creatures were ta|ken by Captain Stoughton; the women were carried captives, and the men put aboard of a &s;hip of one Skipper Geelop, where they all peri&s;hed, by what accident hi&s;torians do not inform us. During this war, thirteen of their Sachems, or little kings, were &s;lain, and Sa&s;&s;acus was betrayed, and at la&s;t put to death by the Maqua Indians, a tribe of &s;avage Canni|bals, to whom he had fled for &s;afety. How far the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e might ju&s;tify the conduct of the coloni&s;ts in this war, I will not pretend to &s;ay, but it appears to have been carried on with a vigour which approached very near to an exce&s;s of &s;everity. This war was &s;oon ended, and the whole tribe of Pequots extirpated. From the beginning to the fini&s;hing thereof, three years were not fully elap&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the year 1638, another Indian war had well nigh broke out, on account of &s;ome Engli&s;h vaga|bonds having murdered an Indian in the woods. This &s;avage belonged to the tribe of the Naragan&s;ets, which on this occa&s;ion began to ri&s;e, but the war was prevented by the puni&s;hment of the murderers, and proper &s;atisfaction was given to the injured party. What mo&s;t &s;truck the Indians on this occa&s;ion was, that all the three men who had been concerned in the murder, were executed, which they con&s;idered as an exce&s;s of ju&s;tice. Although there were many jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions between the coloni&s;ts and the natives, yet from this time, till 1674, there was no open war. Matters were always &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner, that the general tranquility was pre&s;erved. In 1674, one John Sau&s;man, an Indian preacher, who had been
<PB N="250" REF="257">&s;ent to preach the Go&s;pel among the Indians, inform|ed the governor of Plymouth, that Philip, an Indian king, near mount Hope, with &s;everal other tribes, had formed a plot to extirpate the Engli&s;h through|out the country. Soon after this, Sau&s;man was mur|dered, and his body found in a pond, and his hat and gun upon the ice. Upon enquiry, it was found that one Tobias, a coun&s;ellor of Philip, had murdered him, and thrown him into the pond, to prevent a di&s;|covery. The murderer was puni&s;hed, as he de&s;erved, but Philip continued to carry on his plot; and in the month of June, this year, began the ho&s;tilities, by plundering the plantations near <HI>Mount Hope.</HI> The governor, to prevent the further pillagings of the In|dians, &s;ent out a &s;mall army to protect the plantation, and to defend it again&s;t the de&s;igns of Philip. As every thing had the appearance of a war, and ho&s;ti|lities were begun, the colony of Plymouth appointed a day of fa&s;ting and humiliation, to a&s;k the Divine aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t their cruel and &s;avage enemies. On this occa&s;ion they had given no offence to the&s;e new foes, and therefore could with confidence appeal to heaven concerning the ju&s;tne&s;s of their cau&s;e. But as the be&s;t of men, and the mo&s;t righteous cau&s;e are liable to particular misfortunes in the cour&s;e of pro|vidence, &s;o the&s;e coloni&s;ts upon the very day of their humble devotion were a&s;&s;aulted by their enemies. The inhabitants of Sivnazey, in returning from prayers, were attacked by &s;ome lurking Indians, when &s;ome were killed, and &s;everal wounded. This both alarm|ed and rou&s;ed the coloni&s;ts, who now thought that their &s;afety and pre&s;ervation depended upon their ac|tivity, and the vigour of the mea&s;ures which they pur&s;ued. Upon the 26th of June, a company of hor&s;e, under the command of Captain Thomas Pren|tice,
<PB N="251" REF="258">and another of foot, under the command of Cap|tain Daniel Henchman, marched from Bo&s;ton to Mount Hope. They were afterwards joined by a company of volunteers, under Captain Mo&s;ley, and another company of foot from Swan&s;ey, under Cap|tain Cudworth. Upon the 28th, they &s;ent out a &s;cout of twelve men to &s;ee if they could di&s;cover the enemy, who were &s;oon acquainted with their &s;itua|tion, by a di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry from a thicket, with which one was killed and another wounded. The re|maining ten, in&s;tead of retreating to their main body, pu&s;hed boldly forward and attacked the Indians, and put them to flight, though their numbers were ten times more than this &s;mall reconoitering party. The main body of the coloni&s;ts next morning charged the Indians in their quarters, routed them, and put them to flight; upon which their whole country was left open to this victorious army. In the quarters of this enemy were found the mangled bodies of &s;everal Engli&s;hmen, who&s;e heads were &s;tuck upon poles, and Bibles torn in pieces, in contempt of their religion. In the wigwams of the enemy were found all the &s;ig|natures of hurry and a precipitate retreat. Philip now fled from the&s;e parts, but was the occa&s;ion of &s;everal more bloody conflicts, which in the i&s;&s;ue ruin|ed his cau&s;e, and was the rea&s;on of many Indians lo|&s;ing their lives.</P>
<P>It is really amazing in the hi&s;tory of this war what remarkable defeats were given to large bodies of In|dians, by mere handfuls of coloni&s;ts, though they were armed in the &s;ame manner, and fought with the &s;ame weapons. In an open field, a very &s;mall party of Engli&s;h would often defeat ten times their own number, and the enemy leave a third part of their forces dead in the field of battle. Were I to men|tion
<PB N="252" REF="259">the &s;everal particular engagements in which fif|teen have routed an hundred and forty-five, I &s;hould certainly, in this &s;ceptical age, be accu&s;ed of a great degree of credulity. This war, which was princi|pally carried on in the way of bu&s;h-fighting, was ex|ceeding bloody both to the coloni&s;ts and the Indians. Many of the new built towns were burnt, and the plantations laid wa&s;te, the inhabitants were often in|&s;tantly put to death, or carried captive, and re&s;erved for the mo&s;t lingering and excruciating torture; and con&s;idering the infant &s;tate of tho&s;e plantations, it was next to a miracle that they were not totally ex|tirpated by &s;uch numerous and powerful enemies, who were formidable of them&s;elves, and &s;ometimes a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the French.</P>
<P>Philip, who had been the original cau&s;e of this bloody war, fled from one tribe to another, as the chance of war and the various accidents of his fortune obliged him; and &s;uch was his inveterate and unre|lenting enmity again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, that in all parts whither he fled, he endeavoured to make the people parties in the war again&s;t the Engli&s;h. As his revenge was exce&s;&s;ive, the &s;chemes of his policy were deep, and often concerted with a &s;agacity which more civi|lized and enlighted politicians would have marked with the epithets of wi&s;dom.&mdash;But as he paid no re|gard to the moral principles of government, when he pur&s;ued the dictates of his fury and revenge, he at la&s;t laid a &s;nare in which he him&s;elf was entangled, and which proved the ruin of his cau&s;e. To provoke the Maquas, a neighbouring tribe, again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, he &s;et upon &s;ome of their people in the woods and killed them, and then publi&s;hed that the Engli&s;h had done it; but as &s;uch daring wickedne&s;s &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es unpuni&s;hed, providence laid open his &s;chemes, and ex|po&s;ed
<PB N="253" REF="260">the whole of his de&s;igns. One of the Maquas people, whom Philip thought had been killed, was only dangerou&s;ly wounded, who informed his nation of the real actor in that tragedy. This excited the revenge of the whole tribe, who fell upon Philip, and de&s;troyed many of his people, and would have di&s;patched him&s;elf, had he not fled, and taken &s;helter in Mount Hope, from whence, in a &s;hort time he was al&s;o forced to flee. This de&s;perate Indian was as &s;uper&s;titious as he was revenge$ul; he believed in all the progno&s;tications of his <HI>magicians</HI> and <HI>pawwaws,</HI> and from an a&s;&s;urance of one of their prophecies, was per&s;uaded that no Engli&s;hman could kill him. He was at la&s;t &s;hot through the body by an Indian in the &s;ervice of the colonies, and expired &s;oon after in the very place where he had fir&s;t concerted the &s;cheme of extirpating the coloni&s;ts, and his head was carried to Plymouth. The people of New England at this time made an ob&s;ervation with regard to the &s;tate of their affairs, which perhaps will hold in ge|neral with regard to all countries in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion. They took notice, that till once they began to reform their manners, and ob&s;erve the in&s;titutions of the Go&s;pel with more exactne&s;s, that they never pro&s;|pered in pur&s;uing this war; but after they began in earne&s;t to reform abu&s;es, and ob&s;erve the moral in|&s;titutions of God in &s;incerity, their affairs took quite a different turn, and they pro&s;pered in their underta|kings. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve here, how all parties in all nations are ready to declare others in a &s;tate of rebellion, that oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures they are fond of pur&s;uing.</P>
<P>Cotton Mather in his Hi&s;tory of New England ob|&s;erves, that on September the 6th, 1676, four hun|dred Indians were &s;urpri&s;ed in Quechcho, of which,
<PB N="254" REF="261">one half had been acce&s;&s;ary to the <HI>late rebellion,</HI> and for that rea&s;on were &s;old for &s;laves. As the&s;e natives were not the &s;ubjects of England, nor of the colo|ni&s;ts, it was impo&s;&s;ible that they could be rebels in the common acceptation of that word. If the coloni&s;ts claimed all that country as their own, their claim was unju&s;t, and the re&s;i&s;tance of the natives was lawful de|fence again&s;t invaders: or if the Indians attacked the Engli&s;h unju&s;tly, it was an unlawful inva&s;ion, but not a rebellion of &s;ubjects again&s;t lawful government.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t remarkable actions in this war, was an attack upon a fort in the country of the Na|ragan&s;ets, which lies ea&s;t of Connecticut river, and &s;outh of Patu&s;et. The coloni&s;ts of New England find|ing them&s;elves harra&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e tribes in that neigh|bourhood, re&s;olved upon giving them an effectual overthrow, that in time coming they might behave with more civility to their neighbours. Having mu&s;|tered an army of fifteen hundred men, they marched in the middle of winter into their enemies country, in the mid&s;t of fro&s;t and &s;now, and came upon one of their principal forts by &s;urpri&s;e, which they carried, after much &s;laughter on both &s;ides. This fort was &s;ituated upon an i&s;land of about &s;ix acres, in the mid|dle of a &s;wamp, to which there was only acce&s;s one way, which was by pa&s;&s;ing along a &s;ingle tree, where only one per&s;on could pa&s;s, with difficulty.</P>
<P>An Indian, who&s;e name was Peter, who had taken &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t at his tribe, was guide to the New England forces, and led them to this fortre&s;s. This de&s;erter &s;hewed them a certain place in the fore&s;t, where, by throwing four or five trees, about a foot from the ground, over the &s;wamp, they might attack the garri&s;on with good hopes of &s;ucceeding. This was the only place where it appeared vulnerable,
<PB N="255" REF="262">though over again&s;t this pa&s;&s;age there was a block|hou&s;e, which rendered the attempt exceedingly dan|gerous. The coloni&s;ts began the attack at one o'clock&punc; which was led on by Captain Mo&s;ley and Captain Da|venport, who ru&s;hed into the fort, when a bloody conflict began. Six of the principal officers were kill|ed in the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault, and a great many of their pri|vate men; but they at la&s;t carried the fortre&s;s, and &s;lew above &s;even hundred Indians in arms. The re&s;t fled, and betook them&s;elves to a cedar &s;wamp, at &s;ome di&s;tance, whither the coloni&s;ts did not pur&s;ue them. This expedition was commanded by Jo&s;iah Win&s;low, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who had under him many brave and intrepid of|ficers, who behaved with a gallantry that would have done honour to a Roman legion. The Indians in this &s;hort &s;iege had &s;even hundred men killed, and three hundred mortally wounded, be&s;ides old men, women, and children that were pre&s;&s;ed to death in the mid&s;t of the encounter. Of the New England forces, eighty-five were &s;lain, and an hundred and fifty wounded. The other exploits during this war con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in the burning of towns, and laying wa&s;te of villages, on the part of the Indians, and of defeating &s;mall par|ties of the enemy, on the part of the coloni&s;ts. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, many de&s;perate actions were perform|ed; which tho&s;e that are accu&s;tomed to the method of carrying on war in Europe, would &s;carcely be able to give credit to, were it not that they are too well authenticated to be called in que&s;tion. In tho&s;e encoun|ters with the Indians, the coloni&s;ts &s;hewed an uncommon bravery, and were never afraid to engage three times their own number in the open field, at the &s;ame wea|pons. Nor in general can it be affirmed, that they coveted war merely for the &s;ake of dominion. The only error that they appear to have fallen into in car|rying
<PB N="256" REF="263">on their wars, &s;eems to have been, a de&s;ire to enlarge the dominion of Great Britain, and of ma|king conque&s;ts for their mother country, which they delivered up to the di&s;po&s;al of her government.</P>
<P>In the month of April, 1690, a naval force, with &s;even hundred troops, under the command of Sir William Phipps, &s;ailed from Nanta&s;ket, in New England, with orders to &s;eize the French &s;ettlements in Nova Scotia, then called Acadia, which they attacked, and had them delivered up to King William, whom the colo|ni&s;ts in tho&s;e parts had acknowledged as their &s;ove|reign. The rea&s;on of this expedition, &s;eems to have been to di&s;tre&s;s the French, who at this time &s;tirred up the Indians again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, under the pre|tence that they were rebels again&s;t their &s;overeign, and furni&s;hed them with arms and ammunition; with which they did great damage to the planters. The coloni&s;ts con&s;idered this method as the mo&s;t effectual to put an end to the war; for, provided they could once &s;ubdue the French, or drive them from their &s;ettlements, they knew that the Indians would &s;oon be overcome. Sir William Phipps, with a fleet of thirty &s;ail of &s;hips, &s;ailed from New England to Que|bec, but did not arrive till the 7th of October, when the fro&s;t was &s;etting in. This expedition was intend|ed to &s;upport an army of land forces that were to march from New York, of &s;ome coloni&s;ts and Chri|&s;tian Indians. After &s;ome bold efforts, this attempt mi&s;carried; but who was to blame, is not ea&s;ily learn|ed from the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times. It is well known, that although this expedition mi&s;carried, the French were in great terror, and expected nothing le&s;s than to be driven out of Canada. This &s;hews what the coloni&s;ts were then able to attempt, without any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the mother country.</P>
<PB N="257" REF="264">
<P>Be&s;ides the agency of the French, there were other rea&s;ons which the Indians gave for this war with the coloni&s;ts. They alledged that the Engli&s;h refu&s;ed to pay the yearly tribute of corn, agreed upon at the conclu&s;ion of the peace&mdash;that they hindered them from catching fi&s;h in Sago river, by the nets, which hindered the fi&s;h from coming where they were wont to come. They &s;aid, though the coloni&s;ts had got their lands, they imagined the fi&s;hes in the rivers had been &s;till their privilege. But the greate&s;t grievance of all, was the giving patents for lands which belong|ed to them; this incen&s;ed them greatly. And it mu&s;t be allowed that neither the people of Old or New England had any right to give any per&s;ons patents to the lands of the Indians without their con&s;ent. It is a &s;trange method of rea&s;oning, that is u&s;ed by many &s;elfi&s;h politicians, that European &s;overeigns, becau&s;e &s;ome of their &s;ubjects take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome parts of a continent, that therefore they may portion out the whole to their friends, according to their good will and plea&s;ure. Yet this is the force of all the argu|ments of either the French or the Engli&s;h for their right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many parts of the world.</P>
<P>What gave the fir&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable influence to the Indian war, was the behaviour of the French in Canada.&mdash;The&s;e ambitious Gauls had no &s;ooner made a &s;ettlement in tho&s;e parts of the we&s;tern world, than they began to make conque&s;ts, and endeavour|ed to &s;ubject the Indians to the French dominion. When the&s;e natives found them&s;elves in a &s;ituation to re&s;i&s;t the power of France, they defended their own rights, and made repri&s;als upon the enemy; and fre|quently were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that notwith&s;tanding the French having the advantage of fire arms, they were defeated by the Indians, with great lo&s;s, and put in
<PB N="258" REF="265">fear of lo&s;ing their own dominions. The five nations as they are called, of Sinekas, Cayugas, Onoidos, Onadagues, and Mohawks, which lie &s;outh ea&s;t of the lake Ontorio, and north we&s;t from New York and Albany, were zealous oppo&s;ers of the French dominion. The&s;e tribes were united among them|&s;elves upon the mo&s;t liberal principles of freedom and liberty, and abhorred all &s;orts of &s;lavery to &s;uch a de|gree, that they would not even en&s;lave a captive. Such were their ideas of liberty and ju&s;tice, that when a certain man broke the jail of New York and fled to the five nations, that they paid his debt, but would not deliver up his per&s;on, but adopted him into their tribes, and made him free. Laecedemon, in the very height of its glory, did not excel the five nations in their ideas of liberty. It was no wonder that a peo|ple &s;o zealous for freedom &s;hould have had an hearty aver&s;ion to a nation which, for many ages, attempted to make &s;laves of all the world.</P>
<P>The Dutch who &s;ettled at New York, 1609, about &s;ix years after the French came to Canada, made no attempts of conque&s;t, but lived peaceably with the five nations, and carried on trade: between the Dutch and the&s;e Indians, there was a perfect friend&s;hip. The Engli&s;h, who &s;ucceeded to the Dutch in the &s;ettle|ment of New York, ob&s;erved nearly the &s;ame plan, between whom and the five nations, there continued a good under&s;tanding for many years; though it mu&s;t be granted that the Engli&s;h did not &s;upport the prin|ciples of friend&s;hip with the &s;ame ardour and zeal that the five nations &s;upported it, yet the alliance which the Engli&s;h entered into with the five nations was never broken on their part for the &s;pace of &s;ixty years. This may plainly teach us, that had the European Chri&s;tians been as hone&s;t and faithful as the Indians
<PB N="259" REF="266">of the five nations, there would have been no occa|on for &s;uch horrid wars, as have often happened in tho&s;e parts of the world.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts of New England, after many bloody &s;kirmi&s;hes with the French and ea&s;tern Indians, where|in many lives were lo&s;t on both &s;ides, entered into a treaty with the five nations at Albany, in the year 1689. The rea&s;on of this treaty, upon the part of the New England coloni&s;ts was, that they were in|formed that the ea&s;tern Indians, by the means of the French, were &s;oliciting a confederation with the five nations, which they very wi&s;ely conjectured, would not be for the intere&s;t of the Engli&s;h, nor be con&s;i&s;t|ent with their &s;afety. The five nations had been for|midable to the French, even before they were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of fire arms, and now that they were &s;upplied with the&s;e, &s;hould they be engaged again&s;t the Eng|li&s;h, they would be very dangerous enemies. For this rea&s;on it was con&s;idered as a piece of needful po|licy, to have them, if po&s;&s;ible, united in one intere&s;t with New England, again&s;t the French, and the Indi|ans in the French intere&s;t. The agents on the part of New England were Colonel John Pynchon, Major John Savage, and Captain John Bull, and on the &s;ide of the five nations was, Tahajadoris, a Mohawk Sa|chem. After the u&s;ual formalities on &s;uch occa&s;ions, Tahajadoris addre&s;&s;ed the agents in the following man|ner:</P>
<P>"Brethren, you are welcome to this hou&s;e, which is appointed for our treaties, and public bu&s;ine&s;s with the Chri&s;tians: We thank you for renewing the cove|nant chain. It is now no longer of iron, and &s;ubject to ru&s;t as formerly, but of pure &s;ilver, and includes in it all the King's &s;ubjects, from the Senakas country, ea&s;tward, as far as any of the great King's &s;ubjects

<P>"We are glad to hear of the good &s;ucce&s;s our great King has had over the French by &s;ea, in taking and &s;inking &s;o many of their men of war.

The covenant-chain between us is ancient, as you tell us, and of long &s;tanding, and it has been kept inviolably by us.

<P>"You advi&s;e us to pur&s;ue our enemies, the French, vigorou&s;ly.

Gives one belt.</P>
<P>"We patiently bore many injuries from the French, from one year to another, before we took up the axe again&s;t them.

We a&s;&s;ure you that we are re&s;olv|ed never to drop the axe; the French &s;hall never &s;ee our faces in peace; we &s;hall never be reconciled as long as one Frenchman is alive; we &s;hall never make peace, thougn our nation &s;hould be ruined by it, and

<P>"As to what you told us of the <HI>Orvanagungas</HI> and <HI>Uragees,</HI> we an&s;wer: that we were never &s;o proud and haughty as to begin a war without provocation.

If they &s;hall do this, or &s;hall join with any of our enemies, either French or Indians, then we will kill and de&s;troy them."&mdash;Gives a beaver.</P>
<P>Then the Mohawks offered five of their men to guard the agents home again&s;t any of their Indian enemies, who they were afraid might be lying in wait for the agents, and gave a belt. Then the &s;peaker proceeded, and &s;aid, "We have &s;poke what we had to &s;ay of the war, we now come to the affairs of peace: we promi&s;e to pre&s;erve the chain inviolably, and wi&s;h that the &s;un may always &s;hine in peace over our heads, that are comprehended i$ this chain. We give two belts, one for the &s;un, the other for his beams. We make fa&s;t the roots of the tree of peace and tranquillity, which is planted in this place. Its roots extend as far as the outmo&s;t of your colonies. If the French &s;hould come to &s;hake this tree, we would feel it by the motion of its roots, which extend into our country. But we tru&s;t it will not be in the governor of Canada's power to &s;hake this tree, which has been &s;o firmly and &s;o long planted with us."&mdash;Gives two beavers.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, he de&s;ired the Magi&s;trates of Albany to re|member what he had &s;aid, and gave them a beaver. The New England agents were not fully &s;atisfied with all that the Sachem had &s;aid; for the chief thing they wanted, was to know their di&s;po&s;ition concern|ing this point. The five nations an&s;wered, "We
<PB N="262" REF="269">cannot declare war again&s;t the ea&s;tern Indians, for they have done no harm; neverthele&s;s our brethren of New England may be a&s;&s;ured, that we will live and die in friend&s;hip with them. When we took up arms again&s;t the French and their confederates, we did not make war with them at the per&s;ua&s;ions of our brethren here; for they did not &s;o much as know our intention till fourteen days after our army had begun to march."</P>
<P>The&s;e Indians whom we call &s;avages, appear in many in&s;tances to have better notions of ju&s;tice than the po|lite and civilized Chri&s;tians in Europe: they con&s;ider war as unrighteous, without men receive injury, and do not account it a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to engage in war even in behalf of their friends, till once they know the grounds of the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Among all the Indian tribes, none were &s;uch ene|mies to the Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts as tho&s;e who were called the French praying Indians. The&s;e being perverted by Je&s;uit mi&s;&s;ionaries, who not only poi&s;oned their minds with all the ab&s;urdities of Popery, but i$&s;tilled into them the greate&s;t antipathy again&s;t the Engli&s;h by lyes and fal&s;e repre&s;entations. The&s;e tribes were &s;o fully under the French influence, that they took every opportunity to harra&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s all their neighbours that were inclined to favour the Engli&s;h. They had lo&s;t their former hone&s;ty which they had while they were Heathens, and were become &s;uch con&s;ummate di&s;&s;emblers, that there was no depending upon any thing they &s;aid.&mdash;And what rendered them &s;till more dangerous and abominable, they were more barbarous and cruel than when they were profe&s;&s;ed Infidels. The French prie&s;ts had in&s;tructed them in none of tho&s;e principles of religion and humanity which &s;often the heart, and $ooth the rugged pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="263" REF="270">of the &s;oul: they had &s;till concealed from them the Scriptures, and the pure doctrines of morality which they contain, and only taught them concerning the infallibility of the Pope, and the omnipotence of the French king. The&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries of Rome in the fir&s;t in&s;tance taught them that all the Engli&s;h were he|retics, and in a &s;tate of damnation; and that it was me|ritorious to de&s;troy as many of them as they were able; and that cheating them with lyes and fal&s;e promi&s;es, was &s;o far from being a crime, that it was the great|e&s;t virtue, and would meet with an ample reward in the other world. Under the influence of &s;uch tu|torage, it was no wonder that a barbarous and &s;a|vage people turned wor&s;e than they were before.</P>
<P>One thing which often rendered the coloni&s;ts un&s;ucce&s;sful in their attempts again&s;t the French and Indians was, the neglect or incapacity of their gover|nors, which were then &s;ent from Great Britain. As it frequently happened that tho&s;e gentlemen who were appointed to the&s;e offices were more intent in pur&s;uing their own intere&s;t, than looking after the welfare of the colonies, they often neglected the proper mea|&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary for obtaining their welfare. The coloni&s;ts who were not allowed by government to interfere&punc; in that department which belong|ed to the crown, but who at the &s;ame time &s;uffer|ed by the mi&s;conduct of its &s;ervants, were ready, in their hearts, to de&s;pi&s;e men, whom they found take upon them po&s;ts of importance they were not quali|fied to fulfil. Governors appointed by authority, at &s;o great a di&s;tance, and not connected with the inha|bitants, by the common ties of mutual intere&s;t, unle&s;s they are both men of good &s;en&s;e and great virtue, will &s;eldom an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of good legi&s;lature. When a government intends the general welfare of the com|munity, it &s;hould lay a&s;ide partiality in the appoint|ment
<PB N="264" REF="271">of men to offices of &s;tate, and always chu&s;e the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, and &s;uch as are fitte&s;t for the depart|ment a&s;&s;igned. A particular acquaintance with the peo|ple where the magi&s;trates are to re&s;ide and rule, as well as common intere&s;ts joined together with theirs, will always be found nece&s;&s;ary to make men acceptable in that character. It has been much owing to the Eng|li&s;h government not being careful in this particular, that &s;uch di&s;cord has ari&s;en between Great Britain and her once flouri&s;hing colonies.</P>
<P>Before we return to the regular cour&s;e of the hi|&s;tory of the pre&s;ent war, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a view of the con&s;titution of the &s;everal colonies in America, that, by examining their fundamental rights and privileges, we may be able to judge concerning the cau&s;e of the bloody conte&s;t that is now carrying on.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> The government and con&s;titution of the Colonies,&mdash;of Rhode I&s;land,&mdash;Connecticut,&mdash;Virginia,&mdash;Pen&s;ylva|nia,&mdash;Maryland,&mdash;Georgia, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already taken a view of the con&s;titution of the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets bay, their original char|ter of privileges, and the tenure by which they hold their right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands in tho&s;e parts. It was not long after the fir&s;t coloni&s;ts &s;ettled in Ame|rica, before they differed concerning &s;ome points of religion, and carried their contentions &s;o far as to per&s;ecute tho&s;e who could not, or would not conform to their articles of faith. This barbarous and inhuman di&s;po&s;ition proceeded &s;o far as not only to make them deny the Di&s;&s;enters, from their creed, the privileges of citizens, but al&s;o to bani&s;h them out of the country, with threatenings of &s;evere puni&s;hment provided they &s;hould return. This violent and intolerant practice, though it is a &s;evere reflection upon the character of the coloni&s;ts, in the cour&s;e of providence, turned out for good to tho&s;e who were per&s;ecuted, and made them &s;eek to provide for them&s;elves in other parts of the country, which they would not have thought of in an ordinary cour&s;e of affairs. It was for the rea|&s;ons ju&s;t now mentioned, that &s;ome of the per&s;ecuted coloni&s;ts, in the year 1639, began a &s;ettlement in
<PB N="266" REF="273">Rhode I&s;land. This is one of the &s;malle&s;t provinces, of which New England is compo&s;ed. It lies off Mount Hope, and con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall i&s;land of that name, and is the old plantation of Providence. This I&s;land, from whom the Province has its name, lies in Naragan&s;et bay, and is about fifteen or &s;ixteen miles in length, and four or five in breadth. This i&s;land is one of the mo&s;t beautiful and plea&s;ant parts in New England. On account of the fruitfulne&s;s of the &s;oil, and tem|peratene&s;s of the climate, it is called by &s;ome the Pa|radi&s;e of New England; for though it does not lie above 60 miles &s;outh of Bo&s;ton, it is much warmer in winter, being &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and not &s;o affected by land breezes as the neighbouring parts on the con|tinent. There was a very con&s;iderable trade carried on before the war in this i&s;land with the &s;ugar colo|nies, with butter and chee&s;e, hor&s;es, &s;heep, beef, pork, timber, and frames for hou&s;es. The freene&s;s of the &s;ituation in proce&s;s of time invited &s;o many planters to this i&s;land, that it was &s;oon over&s;tocked, and &s;ome of them purcha&s;ed land, and built the towns of Providence and Warwick. What contributed much to the population of this colony was, the free unlimi|ted toleration that was granted in it, to all &s;orts of religious profe&s;&s;ions. This practice of toleration will always have a great influence, both upon the encrea&s;e of the inhabitants of colonies, and the govern|ment of all nations; for though it is affirmed by &s;ome that toleration of &s;ectaries is the occa&s;ion of divi&s;ions, and contentions in nations, yet the very contrary is matter of fact. For it is by laying unnece&s;&s;ary re|&s;traints upon men's con&s;ciences that creates &s;ectaries, which if they were permitted to take their own way, would &s;eldom give any trouble. Government ought therefore to tolerate all forms of religion, except
<PB N="267" REF="274">&s;uch as will not give liberty to others. Rhode I&s;land was formed into a dictinct government by a charter granted in the fifteenth of King Charles the &s;econd. This charter gives to the inhabitants of this colony free liberty for the exerci&s;e of their religion, and makes Rhode I&s;land a corporation politic, in name and fact, by the name of the governor, and company of the Engli&s;h colony of Rhode I&s;land and Providence plantations, in New England, in America; and that by the &s;ame name they and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hall and may have perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall and may be per&s;ons capable in law to &s;ue and plead for all their ju&s;t privileges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">RHODE ISLAND CHARTER.
<P>Charles the &s;econd, by the grace of God, &amp;c. To all to whom the&s;e pre&s;ents &s;hall come, greeting. Whereas we have been informed by the humble petition of our tru|&s;ty and well beloved &s;ubjects, John Clarke, on the behalf of Benjamin Arnold, William Brenton, William Codington, Nicholas Ea&s;ton, Wil|liam Boul&s;ton, John Porter, John Smith, Samuel Gorton, John Weekes, Roger Williams, Thomas Olney, Gregory Dexter, John Co|ge&s;hall, Jo&s;eph Clarke, Randall Houlden, John Greene, John Roome, Samuel Wildbore, Wil|liam Fi$$d, James Barker, Richard Tew, Thomas Harris, and William Dyre, and the re&s;t of the purcha|&s;ers, and free inhabitants of our i&s;land called Rhode I&s;land, and the re&s;t of the colony of Providence Plantations, in the Naragan&s;et bay, in New England in America. That they, pur&s;uing with peace and loy|al minds, their &s;ober, &s;erious, and religious intentions, of godly edi|fying them&s;elves, and one another in the holy Chri&s;tian faith and wor|&s;hip as they were per&s;uaded, toge|ther with the gaining over and con|ver&s;ion of the poor ignorant Indian natives, in tho&s;e parts of America, to the &s;incere profe&s;&s;ion and obe|dience of the &s;ame faith and wor|&s;hip, did not only by the con&s;ent and good encouragement of out royal progenitors, tran&s;port them|&s;elves out of this kingdom of Eng|land into America; but al&s;o &s;ince their arrival there, after their fir&s;t &s;ettlement among&s;t other our &s;ub|jects in tho&s;e parts, for avoiding of di&s;cord, and tho&s;e many evils which were likely to en&s;ue upon tho&s;e our &s;ubjects, not being able to bear in tho&s;e remote parts their diffe|rent apprehen&s;ions in religious concernments; and in pur&s;uance of the afore&s;aid ends, did once a|gain leave their de&s;irable &s;tations and habitations, and with exce&s;&s;ive labour and travel, hazard and charge, did tran&s;plant them&s;elves into the mid&s;t of the Indian natives who, as we are informed, are the mo&s;t potent princes and people of all that country; whereby the good providence of God (from whom the plantations have taken their name) upon their labour and in|du&s;try, they have not only been pre&s;erved to admiration, but have increa&s;ed and pro&s;pered, and are &s;eized and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by purcha&s;e and con&s;ent of the &s;aid natives, to their full content, of &s;uch lands, i&s;lands, rivers, harbours, and roads as are very convenient both for plantations, and al&s;o for building of &s;hips, &s;up|ply of pipe&s;taves, and other mer|chandize, and which lies very com|modious in many re&s;pects for com|merce, and to accommodate our &s;outhern plantations, and may much advance the trade of this our realm, and greatly enlarge the the territories thereof, they having, by near neighbourhood to, and friendly &s;ociety with, the great bo|dy of the Narragan&s;et Indians, gi|ven them encouragement, of their own accord, to &s;ubject them&s;elves, their people and lands, unto us; whereby (as is hoped) there may, in time, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God up|on their endeavoures, be laid a &s;ure foundation of happine&s;s to all A|merica. And whereas, in their humble addre&s;s, they have freely declared, That it is much on their hearts (if they be permitted) to hold forth a lively experiment, that a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing civil &s;tate may &s;tand, and be&s;t be maintained, and that among our Engli&s;h &s;ub|jects, with a full liberty in religious concernments, and that true piety, rightly grounded upon go&s;pel prin|ciples, will give the be&s;t and great|e&s;t &s;ecurity to &s;overeignty, and will lay in the hearts of men the &s;trong|e&s;t obligations to true loyalty: now $$ow ye, That we being willing to encourage the hopeful undertaking of our &s;aid loyal and loving &s;ub|jects, and to &s;ecure them in the free exerci&s;e and enjoyment of all their civil and religious rights ap|pertaining to them as our loving &s;ubjects; and to pre&s;erve unto them that liberty in the true Chri&s;tian faith and wor&s;hip of God, which they have &s;ought with &s;o much travel, and with peaceable minds and loyal &s;ubjection to our royal progenitors, and our&s;elves, to en|joy: and becau&s;e &s;ome of the peo|ple and inhabitants of the &s;ame co|lony cannot, in their private opi|nion, according to the liturgy, form, and ceremonies of the church of England, or take or &s;ub&s;cribe the oaths and articles made and e|&s;tabli&s;hed in that behalf; and for that the &s;ame, by rea&s;on of the re|mote di&s;tances of tho&s;e places, will, as we hope, be no breach of the uni|ty and uniformity e&s;tabli&s;hed in this nation, have therefore thought fit, and do hereby publi&s;h, grant, or|dain, and declare, that our royal will and plea&s;ure is, That no per&s;on within the &s;aid colony, at any time hereafter, &s;hall be any-wi&s;e mole&s;|ted, puni&s;hed, di&s;quieted, or called in que&s;tion, for any differences in opinion in matters of religion, and do not actually di&s;turb the civil peace of our &s;aid colony; but that all and every per&s;on and per&s;ons may, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, freely and fully have and enjoy his and their own judgments and con&s;ciences, in mat|ters of religious concernments, throughout the tract of land here|after mentioned, they behaving them&s;elves peaceably and quietly, and not u&s;ing this liberty to licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s and profanene&s;s, not to the civil injury or outward di&s;|turbance of others, any law, &s;ta|tute or clau&s;e therein contained, or to be contained, u&s;age or cu&s;tom of this realm, to the contrary hereof, in any wi&s;e notwith&s;tanding.

<P>In reading the annals of nations, men who have no other object in view except truth, would be ready to conclude from this and the following charter, that the&s;e two provinces were to all intents and purpo&s;es as free as any of the freeholders in Great Britain, and had as good a right to be their own legi&s;latures, as either the freemen of counties or towns in England. But ca&s;ui&s;ts who have a mind to di&s;pute every thing, and can, for particular ends and rea&s;ons, affirm what no man of common &s;en&s;e is able to give his a&s;&s;ent to, think no &s;hame to deny the very immediate &s;ignifica|tion
<PB N="279" REF="286">of this charter. As if words either had no mean|ing, or were liable to change their &s;ignification at the nod of politicians, they boldly affirm that the&s;e colo|nies never had a right to be their own legi&s;lators.</P>
<P>It would be accounted a very hard ca&s;e in England, for no ju&s;t rea&s;on, to take away the charters of all cor|porations in the nation, many of which have no other &s;ecurity than the grants of princes, and the pre&s;crip|tion of time. If the&s;e &s;ocieties were refu&s;ed the pri|vilege of repre&s;entation, according to the laws of the
<PB N="280" REF="287">land, they could not be ju&s;tly obliged to pay any revenue to the government. If the ca&s;e of the coloni&s;ts be different from this, they are only &s;laves, and not free &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>Virginia, which fir&s;t had a very large &s;ignification, though granted to a company then re&s;ident in Lon|don, is held by much the &s;ame tenure as the other colonies, with this difference, that the council has, by the charter, a power to make laws for the good of the colony, according to their own di&s;cretion;
<PB N="281" REF="288">whereas the other coloni&s;ts are bound to confine all new laws to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution of Great Britain. This is a power granted to per&s;ons living within England, to rule Briti&s;h &s;ubjects at di&s;cretion, which is not con&s;i&s;tent with either the character of Engli&s;hmen, nor the con&s;titution of England. There are three charters which were granted at different times by King James the fir&s;t, to the Virginia company, one to Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sommers, and others, April 10, 1606, and two to the trea&s;urer and com|pany
<PB N="282" REF="289">for Virginia, the one dated March 23, 1609, and the other March 12, 1611-2. The&s;e being exceedingly long and tedious, &s;hall he given at the end of this volume.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania, which is a proprietory colony, was granted to the proprietor, William Penn, much in the &s;ame manner as the others are granted to the proprie|tors and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors thereof. The charter gives Sir Wil|liam power to make laws, rai&s;e money by the con|&s;ent of the freemen or their deputies, to appoint judges
<PB N="283" REF="290">and officers nece&s;&s;ary for the probates of wills, a power to pardon crimes, except murder and high trea&s;on, and in the&s;e to grant reprieves. Al&s;o to make any laws not repugnant to the laws of England. But in doubtful ca&s;es, the &s;ubjects were allowed to appeal to the King. In this charter there is a particular re|&s;erve concerning the Briti&s;h parliament with regard to taxation; this power of parliament is expre&s;&s;ed in the charter; for it is &s;aid no taxes &s;hall be laid upon the inhabitants but by act of a&s;&s;embly or act of parliament.
<PB N="284" REF="291">Such as have accepted of this charter ought not to complain of parliamentary taxation, unle&s;s they un|der&s;tood that they were both to have a repre&s;entation in their own a&s;&s;emblies, and in the parliament of Bri|tain; which it is manife&s;t they never dreamed of. This &s;hews us that the far greater part of tho&s;e patent pri|vileges are imperfect, and that many arguments taken from grants are in the nature of the thing inconclu&s;ive in point of ju&s;tice and natural right.</P>
<P>Mr Pen, according to his charter, framed a &s;y&s;tem of government for the ruling the province of Pen&s;ylva|nia,
<PB N="285" REF="292">con&s;i&s;ting of forty articles, which both &s;hew his wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, as proprietor of that province. The preface to the frame, and the form it&s;elf, are ex|pre&s;&s;ed as follows:</P>
<P>"For particular Frames and Models, it will become me to &s;ay little; and comparatively I will &s;ay nothing. My rea&s;ons are: Fir&s;t, That the age is too nice and difficult for it; there being nothing the wits of men are more bu&s;y and divided upon. 'Tis true, they &s;eem to agree in the end, to wit, Happine&s;s; but in
<PB N="286" REF="293">the means they differ, as to divine, &s;o al&s;o to this human felicity; and the cau&s;e is much the &s;ame, not always want of light and knowledge, but want of u&s;ing them rightly. Men &s;ide with their pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t their rea&s;on, and their &s;ini&s;ter intere&s;ts have &s;o &s;trong a bias upon their minds, that they lean to them again&s;t the good of the things they know.</P>
<P>Secondly, I do not find a model in the world, that time, place, and &s;ome &s;ingular emergencies have not nece&s;&s;arily altered; not is it ea&s;y to frame a civil go|vernment, that &s;hall &s;erve all places alike.</P>

<P>Thirdly, I know what is &s;aid by the &s;everal admirers of monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy, which are the rule of one, a few, and many, and are the three common ideas of government, when men di&s;cour&s;e on that &s;ubject. But I chu&s;e to &s;olve the controver&s;y with this &s;mall di&s;tinction, and it belongs to all three: Any government is free to the people under it (what|ever be the frame) where the laws rule, and the peo|ple are a party to tho&s;e laws; and more than this is tyranny, oligarchy, or confu&s;ion.</P>
<PB N="288" REF="296">
<P>But la&s;tly, when all is &s;aid, there is hardly one frame of government in the world &s;o ill de&s;igned by its fir&s;t founders, that in good hands would not do well enough; and &s;tory tells us, the be&s;t in ill ones can do nothing that is great or good; witne&s;s the Jewi&s;h and Roman &s;tates. Governments, like clocks, go from the motion men give them; and as governments are made and moved by men, &s;o by them they are ruined too. Wherefore governments rather depend upon men, than men upon governments. Let men be good and the government can't be bad; if it be ill, they will cure it. But if men be bad, let the government
<PB N="289" REF="297">be never &s;o good, they will endeavour to warp and &s;poil it to their turn.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome &s;ay, Let us have good laws, and no matter for the men that execute them: But let them con&s;ider, That though good laws do well, good men do better: For good laws may want good men, and be aboli&s;hed or evaded by ill men; but good men will never want good laws, nor &s;uffer ill ones. 'Tis true, good laws have &s;ome awe upon ill mini&s;ters, but that is where they have no power to e&s;cape or aboli&s;h them, and the people are generally wi&s;e and good: But a loo&s;e and depraved people (which is to the que&s;tion) love laws and an admini&s;tration like them|&s;elves. That therefore which makes a con&s;titution, mu&s;t keep it, viz. Men of wi&s;dom and virtue, qualities, that becau&s;e they de&s;cend not with worldly inheri|tances, mu&s;t be carefully propagated by a virtuous education of youth; for which after-ages will owe more to the care and prudence of founders and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive magi&s;tracy, than to their parents for their private patrimonies.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations of the weight of government, and the nice and various opinions about it, made it unea&s;y to me to think of publi&s;hing the en&s;uing frame and conditional laws, fore&s;eeing, both the cen&s;ures they will meet with from men of different humours and engagements, and the occa&s;ion they may give of di&s;cour&s;e beyond my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>But next to the power of nece&s;&s;ity, (which is a &s;oli|citor that will take no denial), this induced me to a compliance, that we have (with reverence to God and good con&s;cience to men) to the be&s;t of our &s;kill, con|trived and compo&s;ed the <HI>Frame</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of this go|vernment, to the great end of all government, viz. To &s;upport power in reverence with the people, and to
<PB N="290" REF="298">&s;ecure the people from the abu&s;e of power; that they may be free by their ju&s;t obedience, and the magi|&s;trates honourable for their ju&s;t admini&s;tration: For liberty without obedience is confu&s;ion, and obedience without liberty is &s;lavery. To carry this evenne&s;s is partly owing to the con&s;titution, and partly to the magi&s;tracy: Where either of the&s;e fail, government will be &s;ubject to convul&s;ions; but where both are wanting, it mu&s;t be totally &s;ubverted: Then where both meet, the government is like to endure. Which I humbly pray, and hope GOD will plea&s;e to make the lot of this of Pen&s;ilvania. Amen.</P>

<P>The boundaries granted by the charter of King Charles to William Penn and his heirs, are all that tract or part of land in America, with the i&s;lands there|in contained, as the &s;ame is bounded on the ea&s;t by the river Delawar, from twelve miles di&s;tance north|wards of Newca&s;tle town, unto the three and fortieth degree of northern latitude, but if the river &s;hall not ex|tend &s;o far northward, then by the &s;aid river, &s;o far as it doth extend, and from the head of the &s;aid river, the ea&s;tern bounds are to be determined by the Meridian line to be drawn from the head of the &s;aid river, unto the forty-third degree. The &s;aid land to extend we&s;tward five degrees in longitude, to be computed from the &s;aid ea&s;tern bounds, and the &s;aid lands to be bounded on the north by the beginning of the three and forti|eth
<PB N="308" REF="316">degree of northern latitude, and on the fouth by a circle drawn at twelve miles di&s;tance from Newca&s;tle, northward and we&s;tward, unto the beginning of the fortieth degree of northern latitude, and then by a &s;trait line we&s;tward, to the limits above mentioned.</P>
<P>It appears &s;omewhat &s;trange in con&s;idering this as well as the other charters, how any &s;overeign or par|liament in Europe could pretend to parcel out the lands of other people, by charters and patents, to their own &s;ubjects, without fir&s;t purcha&s;ing them of the original proprietors, or a&s;king their con&s;ent. Wil|liam Penn &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of this ab&s;urdity when he received his charter, becau&s;e he fir&s;t pur|cha&s;ed the lands of the natives before he claimed any right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Had Penn con&s;idered his charter as giving an undoubted title to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Pen&s;yl|vania, he had no occa&s;ion to carry a price in his hands to the natives to pay them for a right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. His paying a &s;mall price to the Indians, though it had the appearance of ju&s;tice, did not come up to that mea|&s;ure of rectitude which the &s;pirit of equity requires. It gave Mr Penn the character of an hone&s;t man with|out being de&s;erving of it; for he ought fir&s;t to have made his purcha&s;e from tho&s;e who had the lands to di&s;po&s;e, and then as a &s;ubject of Great Britain &s;olicited a charter of protection for &s;uch con&s;iderations as he could have agreed for with the government. By receiving a charter beforehand, he undoubtedly &s;up|po&s;ed that the king was engaged to make good the contents of his patent; and if the natives had &s;old the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to &s;ome other per&s;ons belonging to &s;ome other power before the arrival of Penn, it would have probably been the occa&s;ion of war and de&s;olation in the country. It cannot be doubted but that the na|tives had a right to di&s;po&s;e of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to tho&s;e
<PB N="309" REF="317">who would give them mo&s;t; and &s;uppo&s;e they had &s;old them to the French or any other nation, it would have been no ju&s;t rea&s;on for the government of Britain to have in&s;i&s;ted to make good their promi&s;e to Mr Penn, or any other patentee.&mdash;But in ca&s;es of this kind, ju&s;tice and equity are &s;eldom &s;trictly pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Maryland is a proprietory colony, granted to Lord Baltimore, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;aving the allegi|ance of the inhabitants, and the &s;overeign dominion of the country. It is held by the &s;ame tenure as the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or in the county of Berks, in free &s;occage, by fealty only. The proprietor has power to make laws by the advice, and with the con&s;ent of the free|men and their deputies, and power to execute the &s;aid laws, provided that they are agreeable to rea&s;on, and not repugnant to the laws of England. The proprie|tor has the power of life and limb, freeholds, goods and chattels, without an a&s;&s;embly of the freemen; to make free all &s;ettlers in the &s;aid province, both for the pre&s;ent and to come; to grant the &s;aid &s;ettlers a liberty to trade, and to confer honours upon the in|habitants, with proper titles. In a word, this propri|etor has almo&s;t all the power of a &s;overeign, and in one &s;en&s;e he is &s;uperior to the king; for it is granted that no taxes &s;hall he impo&s;ed by the kings of Eng|land upon the inhabitnnts of this province. Maryland was at fir&s;t &s;ettled with about 200 Roman Catholics, mo&s;t of them of good families; but the proprietory, with great wi&s;dom, introduced a general toleration for Chri&s;tians of all per&s;ua&s;ions, a mea&s;ure which tend|ed much to the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the colony. This colony, as well as Pen&s;ylvania, for a long time, had the honour of being un&s;tained with the di&s;grace of re|ligious per&s;ecution; and, as well as the other, free from the calamities of war, offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, with
<PB N="310" REF="318">their neighbours the Indians, with whom they lived in the mo&s;t exemplary harmony. It happened once through mi&s;take in a war with the Indians, carried on again&s;t Virginia, that they made an incur&s;ion into the territories of Maryland, but were &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;take. The la&s;t war changed matters greatly, and the Indians, through the fal&s;e in&s;inuations of the French, were in&s;tructed to laugh at their ancient al|liances. The people of Maryland are of the &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hed religion as tho&s;e in Virginia, that is of the church of England; but the clergy here are provided for in a much more liberal manner. The principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the people of Maryland, before the pre&s;ent war, was like tho&s;e of Virginia to cultivate tobacco, and the planters live in farms &s;cattered up and down the country, and have their goods carried from them when ready, by &s;hips which come to Che&s;apeak bay, and the navigable rivers which run into it. The tobacco of this country is called Oroonoko, which is accounted &s;tronger than that of Virginia, and is great|ly demanded in the ea&s;tern and northern parts of Europe, where it is even preferred to the &s;weet &s;cent|ed tobacco of James and York river in Virginia. About 40,000 hog&s;heads has been &s;hipped in one year. In this colony, in the time of the la&s;t war, there were &s;uppo&s;ed to be 40,000 white inhabitants, and 60,000 negroes. The profits ari&s;ing from this colony and Virginia, to Great Britain were immen&s;e, and the government received great revenues therefrom. The provinces of Virgina and Maryland are &s;uppo&s;ed, in tobacco only, to have exported in 1763, to the an|nual value of 768,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> into Britain. This, at 8<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per hog&s;head, makes the number of hog&s;heads amount to 96,000. Of the&s;e it is computed that above 13,500 hog&s;heads are con&s;umed in Britain, the duty on which,
<PB N="311" REF="319">at 26<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 1<ABBR>s.</ABBR> per hog&s;head, comes to 351,675<ABBR>l.</ABBR> the re|maining 82,500 hog&s;heads are exported by our mer|chants to the other countries of Europe, and their value returned to Britain. The value of this trade appears from the very recital thereof.&mdash;And it may be added, that this &s;ingle branch employs 330 &s;ail of &s;hips, and 3960 &s;eamen. This trade not only en|crea&s;ed our wealth, but braced the &s;inews of our &s;trength, and ought to have been carefully nouri&s;hed for the good and advantage of the mother country, as well as that of the colonies.</P>
<P>Carolina is a colony which was granted to &s;ome Eng|li&s;h noblemen in 1663. The&s;e were Edward Earl of Clarendon, then Lord High Chancellor of England; George Duke of Albemarle; William Lord Craven; John Lord Berkely; Anthony Lord A&s;hley; Sir George Carteret; Sir William Berkely; and Sir John Colliton; who, according to the &s;tile of the charter, being excited with a laudable and pious zeal for the propagation of the go&s;pel, begged a certain country in the parts of America, not yet cultivated and plant|ed, and only inhabited by barbarous people, who had no knowledge of God. Wherefore, the king granted them all that territory in his dominions in America, from the north end of the I&s;land called Luke-I&s;land, which lies in the &s;outhern Virginian &s;ea, and within thirty-&s;ix degrees of north latitude; and to the we&s;t as far as the &s;outh &s;ea; and &s;o &s;outherly as the river Matheo, which borders on the coa&s;t of Florida, and is within thirty-one degrees of north latitude; and &s;o we&s;t in a direct line, as far as the &s;outh &s;eas afore&s;aid. This patent was accompanied with the u&s;ual inve&s;ti|tures of fi&s;heries, mines, power of life and limb, and other requi&s;ites for territorial property. The &s;tate of England at this time happened to be exceeding favour|able
<PB N="312" REF="320">for a &s;ettlement of this &s;ort. The di&s;&s;enters had undergone &s;ome &s;evere hard&s;hips, epi&s;copacy was now re&s;tored, and many &s;ober and well meaning Engli&s;h|men were far from being &s;atisfied with the de&s;igns of the court. Some of the proprietaries them&s;elves were at be&s;t but very moderate favourers of the act of uni|formity; and they very wi&s;ely obtained a clau&s;e of toleration in their charter, by which the king granted the proprietaries full and free licen&s;e, liberty, and authority, by &s;uch legal ways and means as they &s;hould think proper to give unto &s;uch per&s;on and per&s;ons, in|habiting and being within the &s;aid province, or any part thereof, who really in their judgments, and for con&s;cience &s;ake, cannot conform to the liturgy, form and ceremonies of the church of England, and take and &s;ub&s;cribe the oaths and articles, made and e&s;tab|li&s;hed in that behalf, or any of them, &s;uch indulgences and di&s;pen&s;ations in that behalf, for, and during &s;uch time and times, and with &s;uch limitations and re&s;tric|tions as they &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P>The original con&s;titutions, of which there were an hundred and twenty, proceeded upon the &s;ame plan of toleration, and are thought to be &s;ugge&s;ted by Lord A&s;hley, afterwards Earl of Shaftibury, and penned by the great Mr Locke, an intimate friend of that noble|man. By &s;everal of the&s;e fundamental articles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Article 96, 101, 102, 106.</NOTE> and con&s;titutions, it is provided, "That &s;ince the natives of that place, who will be concerned in our planta|tions, are utterly &s;trangers to Chri&s;tianity, who&s;e idol|atry, ignorance, or mi&s;take, give us no right to expell or u&s;e them ill; and that tho&s;e who remove from other parts to plant there, will unavoidably be of different opinions concerning matters of religion, the liberty whereof they will expect to have allowed them; and
<PB N="313" REF="321">that it will not be rea&s;onable for us, on that account, to keep them out.&mdash;Therefore, that &s;ure peace may be maintained, amid&s;t the diver&s;ity of opinions, and our agreement and compact with all men may be duly and faithfully ob&s;erved, the violation whereof, upon whatever pretence, cannot be without great offence to Almighty God, and &s;candal to the true religion which we profe&s;s; and al&s;o, that Jews, heathens, and other di&s;&s;enters from the purity of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, may not be &s;carred and kept at a di&s;tance from it; but by having an opportunity of acquainting them|&s;elves with the truth and rea&s;onablene&s;s of its doctrines, and the peaceablene&s;s and inoffen&s;ivene&s;s of its profe&s;|&s;ors, may, by good u&s;age and per&s;ua&s;ion, and all tho&s;e convincing methods of gentlene&s;s and meekne&s;s, &s;uit|able to the rules and de&s;igns of the go&s;pel, be won over to embrace, and unfeignedly receive the truth. Therefore, the &s;aid con&s;titutions provided for their liberty; but declared that no per&s;on above &s;eventeen years of age, &s;hould have any benefit or protection of law, which is not a member of &s;ome church profe&s;&s;ion, having his name recorded in &s;ome one religious re|gi&s;ter." The&s;e articles, which were &s;igned by the proprietaries, are declared by the la&s;t article, to be the &s;acred and unalterable form and rule of govern|ment in Carolina for ever. So far did the religious con&s;titution of this colony proceed.</P>
<P>As to the articles concerning the civil government of the colony, the fir&s;t provides, that a palantine be cho&s;en out of the proprietaries, who &s;hall continue during life, and be &s;ucceeded by the elde&s;t of the other proprietaries. This palatine acted as a pre&s;ident of a court, compo&s;ed of him&s;elf, and three other proprie|taries, and who were ve&s;ted with the execution of all the powers of the charter; and it is called the pala|tine's
<PB N="314" REF="322">court. Each member had a power of nomi|nating a deputy, who acted for him in Carolina, but according to his directions. The fundamental con&s;ti|tutions require that there &s;hould be three great hereditary landholders in every county, one called the land-grave, and the other called by the Indian name caciques. Their great a&s;&s;embly, or what has been called their parliament, was to con&s;i&s;t of the governor, the proprietaries and their deputies, and the com|mons; in imitation of the king, lord, and commons of Great Britain. The commoners were to be elective, like tho&s;e in England, by the freeholders of every county; and this a&s;&s;embly was to &s;it in one hou&s;e, once in every two years, and oftener if need required; and the votes of the members were to be of equal weight. This government appears to have been too unweildy, and &s;carcely practicable for an infant colony to ob&s;erve. It was overcharged with &s;o many courts, and forms, in one body politic, that the execution ap|pears to have been impracticable. It was upon the whole a &s;ort of a feudal government, with &s;ome few exceptions. One thing in which it approached very near to the feudal &s;y&s;tem was, that the inhabitants from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty years of age, if called upon by the &s;overeign power there, which was the great council, were obliged to take the field with proper arms. Every planter, if he did not buy it off, was al&s;o to pay annually to his proprietary, one penny an acre of quit rent; and each county had one &s;heriff, and four ju&s;tices of the peace.</P>
<P>The &s;ettling this colony co&s;t the proprietaries at fir&s;t large &s;ums of money; 44000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> were expended in tran&s;porting inhabitants and cattle thither, and it was long before the proprietaries received any return from their e&s;tates. All free per&s;ons who came over were
<PB N="315" REF="323">to have fifty acres of land for them&s;elves; fifty for each man &s;ervant, and as many for each woman &s;er|vant that was marriageble; and every &s;ervant after his or her &s;ervitude was expired, was deemed to be free, and to have fifty acres, paying the quit rent of one penny an acre. But the proprietaries were careful where any of the coloni&s;ts bought their quit rents, to except the mines and minerals, and quarries of pre|cious &s;tones. In the year 1670, Colonel William Sayle was appointed governor of Carolina by the proprie|taries. At this time, the lands about Albemarle and Port-Royal rivers, as being mo&s;t convenient for trade, were mo&s;t frequented; but experience &s;oon taught the coloni&s;ts, that pa&s;turage and tillage were nece&s;&s;ary for their e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;o that A&s;hley and Cooper rivers drew hitherto &s;uch numbers, that that neigh|bourhood &s;oon became the be&s;t inhabited part of the country. In 1671 Captain Hal&s;tead arrived with a &s;upply of provi&s;ions of all kinds from the proprietaries in England, who created James Carteret, Sir John Yeoman, and John Locke, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> landgraves and caciques. At this time al&s;o &s;ome deviations were made from the original con&s;titutions. It was di&s;covered that the number of landgraves and caciques, required by the original con&s;titution, were not to be found, and therefore a governor was named by the palatine. The council was to con&s;i&s;t of &s;even deputies of proprie|taries, as many cho&s;en by the a&s;&s;embly, or as it was called, the parliament, and as many of the landgraves and caciques. To tho&s;e were added all of them nomi|nated by the proprietaries; an admiral, a chamber|lain, chancellor, chief ju&s;tice, &s;ecretary, &s;urveyor, trea|&s;urer, high &s;teward, high con&s;table, regi&s;ter of births and burials and marriages, regi&s;ter of writings, and mar&s;hal of the admiralty. The quorum of the coun|cil
<PB N="316" REF="324">was to con&s;i&s;t of the governor and &s;ix of the mem|bers, three of whom were to be proprietary deputies; and an a&s;&s;embly was compo&s;ed of the governor, the deputies of the proprietaries, ten members to be cho&s;en by the freeholders of Berkley county, and ten by tho&s;e of Colliton county; this number was to be encrea&s;ed according to the encrea&s;e of the colony.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t palatine of this colony was the Duke of Albemarle, who was &s;ucceeded by the Earl of Craven, in 1761. At this time the proprietaries had conceived very &s;anguine hopes of their colony; for they ordered Captain Hal&s;tead to &s;ail up A&s;hley river to make di&s;|coveries; and the model of a very magnificent town was &s;ent over with him, to be built as the metropolis of the province. At this time the majority of the colo|ni&s;ts were di&s;&s;enters; but the promi&s;ing appearance of the colony invited over to it many of the old cavilier character, and others, who&s;e irregular and libertine, conduct and behaviour gave great &s;candal to the original planters, which in time produced a &s;chi&s;m, or rather a civil war in the colony. Sir John Yeoman &s;ucceeded Colonel Sayle as governor; but the di&s;orders of the colony encrea&s;ed &s;o much, that the Indians were abu&s;ed, and though at that time very numerous in Carolina, were provoked to a war, in which much blood was &s;hed, and many lives lo&s;t on both &s;ides. The&s;e imprudent proceedings would have proved fatal to the colony, had it not been for the wi&s;dom and prudence of the proprietaries; for their party, and that of the planters be&s;ides, having the natives on their &s;ides, came often to blows; and one of the name of Culpepper was &s;ent over pri&s;oner to to England, where he was tried for high trea&s;on in We&s;tmin&s;ter hall, for rai&s;ing a rebellion in Carolina, but acquitted. The&s;e unruly proceedings plainly &s;hew
<PB N="317" REF="325">that nothing contributes more to the peace and hap|pine&s;s of a people than the practical principles of pure and unde&s;iled liberty. The Tory principles of cava|liers, which always will incline their votaries to aim at dominion, will ever be inimical to the peace and tranquility of &s;ociety; whereas, ju&s;t ideas of liberty make men grant as much freedom to others as they take to them&s;elves, and by that means they are not ready to quarrel and fall out.</P>
<P>To put a period to the&s;e di&s;orders, or at lea&s;t to provide &s;ome remedy, the proprietaries cho&s;e one Col. We&s;t to be their governor, and from his character and behaviour he appears to have been a man of wi&s;dom, &s;agacity, and courage. He found great licentiou&s;ne&s;s prevailing in the colony when he came to the govern|ment, parties ri&s;en to a great height, and the Indian war not extingui&s;hed. This new governor, by taking the popular &s;ide in a great mea&s;ure, cured the public divi&s;ions &s;o much, that the parties united in repelling the We&s;toes, an Indian nation who were very trouble|&s;ome to the inhabitants. In 1682 he held a parliament at Charle&s;town, where &s;everal good laws pa&s;&s;ed; and particularly an act for highways, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing drunkenne&s;s and profane &s;wearing, for ob&s;ervation of the Lord's day, and for &s;ettling the militia. Tho&s;e, and &s;ome other popular acts were di&s;plea&s;ing to the proprietaries; and We&s;t, in 1683, was re|moved from his government, and was &s;ucceeded by Jo&s;eph Moreton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of the proprietaries did not appear in this change of a governor, nor in the commi&s;&s;ion which they &s;ent to appoint and determine differences be|tween the Engli&s;h and the Indians of Carolina. The commi&s;&s;ioners that were appointed for the purpo&s;e above mentioned were, Morice Mathews, William
<PB N="318" REF="326">Fullet, Jonathan Fits, and John Boon, <ABBR>E&s;qrs</ABBR> Tho&s;e gentlemen were accu&s;ed of unfair practi&s;es in their deci&s;ions, and were &s;oon di&s;&s;olved. Though there were many di&s;couraging circum&s;tances attended the colony at this time, yet it &s;till pro&s;pered; and Charle&s;|town was built and fortified in a very fine and inviting &s;ituation, upon a rock between A&s;hley and Cooper rivers. Three counties, tho&s;e of Berkley, Craven, and Colliton, were laid out and divided into &s;quares of 12000 acres, proportioned to the &s;hares held in them by the proprietaries, landgraves, and caciques. The coloni&s;ts at this time carried on a trade with the In|dians, which the proprietaries did not at all approve of; for they wanted to engro&s;s this trade into their own hands, which rendered their authority le&s;s re|&s;pectable in the e&s;teem of the inhabitants. To an&s;wer their &s;everal purpo&s;es they frequently changed their governors, with little advantage to them&s;elves, and with little &s;atisfaction to the coloni&s;ts. Men who re|&s;ide in England, and are engaged in forming Utopian &s;chemes of wealth and riches, are ready to imagine, before they try experiments, that there is nothing to &s;tand in the way of their imaginations, and form their &s;chemes of government, according to what they wi&s;h to happen, rather than according to principles of certain|ty or real probability. Mr We&s;t, who was again re|&s;tored to his government, did not long continue; he became popular by doing good, and was envied by the proprietaries. He was &s;ucceeded by James Colliton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Barbadoes gentleman, who was exceedingly unpopular. He and his friends attempted to alter the fundamental con&s;titutions of the colony, and to &s;ub&s;ti|tute other articles under the title of &s;tanding laws, and temporary laws. This proceeding plea&s;ed none of the principal parties concerned, but was di&s;agreeable
<PB N="319" REF="327">to both the proprietaries and the planters; &s;o that Mr Colliton was not only deprived of his office, but driven out of the colony. Upon the expul&s;ion of Colliton, &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable gentlemen had the management of affairs, till a new governor was ap|pointed. Four governors &s;ucceeded one another in a &s;hort period; the la&s;t of whom &s;ent notice to the pro|prietories, that unle&s;s &s;ome of them&s;elves, or one in the character of proprietary, came among them with full power to &s;ettle all grievances, matters would never be put to rights. Upon this the Lord A&s;hley, elde&s;t &s;on to the Earl of Shaft&s;bury, was cho&s;en by the pro|prietaries to be governor. This was the famous author of the Characteri&s;tics, a book, though condemned by many who never were able to under&s;tand it, contains &s;ome as ju&s;t and good rea&s;onings as is to be met with in mo&s;t modern compo&s;itions. Lord A&s;hley's con&s;ti|tution not being &s;uited to &s;uch active &s;cenes of life, he delined accepting of the government. It was at this time conferred upon Mr Archdale, who publi&s;hed an account of Carolina, to which the public is indebted for the principal things we know of that colony at that time.</P>
<P>Mr Archdale &s;oon found that he had more to do than he expected, and that he had a very difficult ta&s;k to perform; but he behaved &s;o well, and managed with &s;o much prudence, di&s;cretion, and patience, that the a&s;&s;embly voted him an addre&s;s of thanks. There was at this time a good under&s;tanding between the government of Spain, and that of Great Britain; but it was a common practice for the people of Jamaica and Barbadoes to buy Spani&s;h Indians for &s;laves, who had been taken pri&s;oners by other Indian &s;avages. The Tamma&s;ees were a nation under the protection of the Engli&s;h, though they had been formerly under that of
<PB N="320" REF="328">the Spaniards. They had taken &s;ome pri&s;oners from an Indian belonging to Spain. Mr Archdale, when he heard of this, immediately ordered the king of the Tamma&s;ees to repair to Charle&s;town with his pri&s;oners, which he did, when Archdale commanded him to march to St Augu&s;tine, where he was to pre&s;ent them, with a letter to the Spani&s;h governor. All which the Indian prince mo&s;t punctually obeyed; and Mr Arch|dale received a very polite letter from the governor in return. This act of ju&s;tice was the beginning of mutual good offices between the two nations; for the Spaniards &s;oon after made the like return to the Eng|li&s;h governor of Carolina.</P>
<P>The Earl of Bath came at la&s;t to be palatine, who was an enthu&s;ia&s;tic zealot for the church of England; his great ambition was to e&s;tabli&s;h that wor&s;hip in Carolina, exclu&s;ive of all others; the &s;ame doctrine being inforced in England by the bill again&s;t occa&s;ional conformity. One Moor was at this time governor, a man tractable to the views of the palatine. His character in the hi&s;tory of that time is far from being amiable; he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, which will, on all occa&s;ions, tarni&s;h a man's character, even &s;uppo&s;e it had no other blots upon it. Though it never happens that a man truely good will ever per|&s;ecute others for con&s;cience &s;ake, Moor &s;eems to have been a man void of all principle, as his after behavi|our te&s;tified; for upon the breaking out of the war with Spain, he carried on a &s;lave trade, which di&s;|graced both the proprietaries and him&s;elf. He &s;old the Spani&s;h Indians to the Briti&s;h I&s;lands, at a lower price than they could purcha&s;e African &s;laves, and by that means made a con&s;iderable advantage to him&s;elf. But his violence and inju&s;tice had almo&s;t proved the ruin of the colony.</P>
<PB N="321" REF="329">
<P>Moor was &s;ucceeded by John&s;on, a man of the &s;ame principles and temper, and carried on matters with great violence; under his government a bill was brought in to exclude all per&s;ons from being cho&s;e members of the commons hou&s;e, who did not conform to the religious wor&s;hip of the church of England.</P>
<P>This was expre&s;sly contrary to the con&s;titutions of the colony. By this law all di&s;&s;enters were di&s;quali|fied, though legally elected, from &s;itting in the a&s;&s;em|bly, and the candidate who had the greate&s;t number of votes, after the di&s;qualified di&s;&s;enter was &s;et a&s;ide, was admitted. The di&s;&s;enters were now &s;adly har|ra&s;&s;ed, by a &s;et of tyrannical managers, and left with|out all redre&s;s, and many fooli&s;h and oppre&s;&s;ive things were done, incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of all good government. Such was the madne&s;s of the Tories in that colony, that they proceeded from one thing to another till they broke their charter, and were obliged to &s;urrender it into the hands of the queen in 1705. It is &s;omewhat &s;trange, that in all governments where a tyranny is carried on, they work its di&s;&s;olution in the end; and where liberty is &s;upported, that the weake&s;t governments encrea&s;e, and at la&s;t flouri&s;h. From the many examples of this, in the hi&s;tory of mankind, one would think that &s;overeigns and rulers would learn to &s;upport liberty for their own &s;ake, and that of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, becau&s;e they have &s;o many in&s;tances of the falls of empires and governments, when once they begin to introduce oppre&s;&s;ion. One thing which the oppre&s;&s;ion of the palatine and governors produced was, a ri&s;ing of the Indians, whom they proceeded to oppre&s;s as well as the coloni&s;ts. The power of the proprietaries was now &s;unk to nothing, and &s;o weak was their admini&s;tration, that the coloni&s;ts in Carolina were obliged to apply to the crown to
<PB N="322" REF="330">take them under its protection; which the government of England pretended implied a re&s;umption of their charter. The proprietaries found that they were not able to carry on the war again&s;t the Indians upon their own bottom, they therefore re&s;olved to &s;urrender their charter, which they accordingly did to a number of per&s;ons in tru&s;t for the crown.</P>
<P>It is plain that the arbitrary principles of the pro|prietaries and their managers, almo&s;t ruined the colony, and lo&s;t them their charter. There is &s;omething of in|fatuation, for the mo&s;t part, that attends people that gra&s;p at unrea&s;onable dominion, for they never can tell when they have enough, and &s;tretch their power &s;o far that they over reach them&s;elves. The de&s;ire of dominion over others is &s;weet to the mo&s;t part of man|kind, but there is nothing in nature more unrea&s;onable, nor any thing that argues more a weakne&s;s of under|&s;tanding than the de&s;ire thereof. In proceeding through the hi&s;tory of the &s;malle&s;t colonies, we may &s;ee their ruin in&s;eperably connected with arbitrary government; and that whenever the ideas of liberty are lo&s;t, pro&s;perity ends, and confu&s;ion begins. It is of no &s;ignification whether a few or many exerci&s;e tyranny, the effects will be the &s;ame, and will always follow their cau&s;e. Civil and religious liberty are e&s;&s;ential to all good government; for there is in fact no government without them; they are the &s;prings of both rational rule and obedience. Without the&s;e two &s;prings all forms of government will be tyrannical, and all profe&s;&s;ions of obedience hypocri&s;y and di&s;imulation. Unle&s;s men &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves free, they will never obey from the heart, and legi&s;lators have but a poor hold of mankind, when they rule them only by principles of fear. This may re&s;train &s;ome from acts of violence, but it will never &s;timulate
<PB N="323" REF="331">to great and noble actions. There is not a great action recorded in the whole hi&s;tory of &s;lavery, &s;ince the creation of the world.</P>
<P>Although in this and the two preceding years, very little was done in parliament concerning American affairs, yet the progre&s;s of the mini&s;try, and the court party in parliament, became more and more alarming to the friends of liberty in the Briti&s;h empire. The mo&s;t &s;acred rights of private property, which had been &s;ecured by royal patent, confirmed by the &s;anction of parliament, were now confirmed by a junto of mini|&s;terial puppets, who acted at the nod of the political commander in chief. The Ea&s;t India company, whom experience had convinced of the infidelity of their &s;er|vants in the ea&s;tern parts of the world, had determin|ed to &s;end out &s;ome friends whom they could confide in, in the character of &s;upervi&s;ors, to rectify pa&s;t abu&s;es, and to direct the affairs of the company in time coming, till things were put into &s;uch order as the intention of their in&s;titution required.</P>
<P>Though the company had been taken in &s;ome mea|&s;ure into the hands of admini&s;tration, and their affairs came under the cognizance of parliament, as early as the year 1767, yet nothing had been done all this time towards their regulation and &s;ettlement, except the re&s;tricting of their dividends, re&s;cinding their acts, and the obtaining from them, without any vi&s;ible e|quivalent, immen&s;e &s;ums of money, which were far beyond their abilities. No order was taken &s;uited to the change in their condition and circum&s;tances, for the regulation and government of their new acqui&s;i|tions; nor any new powers lodged in their hands to counterbalance the va&s;t tru&s;ts which they were now under a nece&s;&s;ity of repo&s;ing in their &s;ervants; nor to re&s;train or prevent tho&s;e evils which ordinarily attend
<PB N="324" REF="332">the &s;udden tran&s;ition from the direction of a counting hou&s;e, to the government of an exten&s;ive territory.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;orders had been vi&s;ible for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and if government had merely intended the welfare of the company, they would have applied the benevolent influence of their power, as &s;oon as they perceived the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of that evil, which they now con&s;ider|ed to be &s;o imminent, and of &s;uch a dangerous nature. It was alledged that government had voluntarily per|mitted the&s;e di&s;orders to go on, that by &s;uffering the company to render them&s;elves odious and ridiculous, through the mi&s;conduct of their &s;ervants, an handle might be made thereof, to &s;hew its incapacity of go|verning &s;uch large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to prepare the na|tion for the changes that were intended to &s;ucceed. Whether this allegation was true or fal&s;e, it is certain that the bad admini&s;tration in India, with all its con&s;e|quences, were &s;uffered to pa&s;s unnoticed; and it is manife&s;t in the tran&s;actions of the year 1772, that though the affairs of the company were alluded to, at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, in the &s;peech from the throne, they were notwith&s;tanding &s;uffered to lie over till near the clo&s;e thereof, when a bill was brought in by the deputy chairman, for enlarging the controul|ing powers of the company, with re&s;pect to their &s;er|vants, in the ea&s;tern parts of the world. This bill however came to nothing. But a member in the king's &s;ervice, not indeed connected with the mini&s;try, whether with or without their advice, at length rou&s;ed their attention to this object. This gave ri&s;e to a &s;elect committee, which was armed with full powers for all purpo&s;es of enquiry, concerning the officers of the company.</P>
<P>The whole company were now greatly alarmed, and not only dreaded the rigour of an enquiry, but
<PB N="325" REF="333">from late experience were too &s;en&s;ible of the ineffi|cacy of charters for their protection, in a di&s;pute wherein government found it for the &s;ervice of their purpo&s;es of power, to &s;et them a&s;ide. In a &s;enate where the majority are under the influence of an omnipotent mini&s;try, no former rights and privileges are &s;afe and &s;ecure; for yes or no, will, in &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly, &s;et a&s;ide the very con&s;titutional rights of an empire. Charters granted to incorporated bodies of people, confirmed by the legi&s;lature, are certainly as legal tenures for holding rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as any deeds that can be devi&s;ed, and cannot ju&s;tly be infringed by public authority, unle&s;s the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are guilty of &s;uch crimes, as legally deprive them of the rights of other &s;ubjects. But when it is admitted to be a maxim of government, that future parliaments may rever&s;e the con&s;titutional deeds of former legi&s;latures, for rea&s;ons of &s;tate or conveniency, there are no rights which any &s;ubjects can po&s;&s;e&s;s, but what are merely precarious and uncertain.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t India company fore&s;aw the &s;torm that was gathering fa&s;t, and would, unle&s;s provided again&s;t, at la&s;t bur&s;t upon their heads. They therefore endea|voured to prevent its effects by the be&s;t mea&s;ures and methods they could devi&s;e. It was propo&s;ed, during the rece&s;s of parliament, to &s;end out a new commi&s;&s;ion of &s;upervi&s;ion, with full powers to regulate all the company's affairs abroad. This was a &s;ubject that took up much time, it being not le&s;s difficult to agree upon the per&s;ons who were to be appointed to an office of &s;o great importance, than upon the extent of the powers with which they were to be intru&s;ted. They at la&s;t agreed upon &s;ending &s;ix gentlemen for the pur|po&s;e intended, and a general officer of high rank and character, who had commanded with great honour in
<PB N="326" REF="334">the American war. All the&s;e con&s;ented to go out at the head of the &s;upervi&s;ion.&mdash;But before matters could be fully adju&s;ted and brought into execution, the meeting of parliament put an end to the de&s;ign. A &s;elect committee, as well as a committee of &s;ecrecy, was appointed for examining the company's affairs, which were careful to &s;tate them in &s;uch a point of view as greatly expo&s;ed both the company and its &s;er|vants, and excited a general indignation again&s;t them. Tho&s;e enquiries, and the proceedings of parliament in con&s;equence thereof, were upon the whole arbitrary and illegal, as the Ea&s;t India company was re&s;trained from the management and direction of its own proper|ties, without any ju&s;t rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for applying &s;uch an incapacitating authority. What appeared ex|ceedingly unrea&s;onable was, that though the mini&s;try acknowledged that the company's affairs were in a very confu&s;ed &s;ituation in Bengal, yet they wanted to re&s;train them from &s;ending out &s;upervi&s;ors to rectify tho&s;e errors and abu&s;es, which were &s;o much com|plained of. This was con&s;idered as an high degree of oppre&s;&s;ion, and viewed in the light of a de&s;ign to make the company &s;ub&s;ervient to the ends of government, to all intents and purpo&s;es. The argu|ments that were u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion in parlia|ment, will &s;peak be&s;t for them&s;elves, and they &s;hall be given nearly in the &s;ame words as they were delivered.</P>
<P>"The plea of di&s;tre&s;s was examined, and alledged to be only temporary, by a deficiency of pre&s;ent ca&s;h; but it was in&s;i&s;ted, that in point of &s;olvency, the com|pany was in the highe&s;t degree of credit. That the mini&s;ter him&s;elf had admitted this fact. That the gro&s;s abu&s;es committed in India, had rendered it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to appoint a &s;et of gentlemen, in whom the confidence of the company, who&s;e intere&s;t was at
<PB N="327" REF="335">&s;take, was placed to reform tho&s;e abu&s;es and regulate their affairs; by who&s;e interpo&s;ition, notwith&s;tanding the expence, va&s;t &s;ums might be, and probably would be, &s;aved to the company; that it was a new &s;y&s;tem of conduct, as well as a new mode of argument, that be|cau&s;e people were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, they &s;hould not be be permitted to take proper mea&s;ures to retrieve their af|fairs; that this was a propo&s;al for an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law, and was to re&s;train the company from doing what was al|ready legally done; that the report was founded upon a fal&s;e principle, the alleged motive being to pre&s;erve the company from a farther embara&s;&s;ment in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of their affairs, by their running into an ex|traordinary expence; whereas the expences of the &s;upervi&s;ion, were to be paid, and paid only, out of the &s;avings which it might be productive of in India, and could have no po&s;&s;ible effect on their pre&s;ent di&s;|tre&s;&s;es at home. That the company, notwith&s;tanding the full powers with which they were legally furni&s;hed, for the management of their internal affairs, and the appointment of their &s;ervants, had &s;hewn &s;o great an attention and deference to parliament, that though the &s;upervi&s;ors were appointed, and the gentlemen in readine&s;s to depart, they had already &s;u&s;pended the commi&s;&s;ion, only upon hearing that the hou&s;e had be|gun an enquiry into their affairs, and were determin|ed it &s;hould not take place, till the i&s;&s;ue of that en|quiry. That the report &s;trikes at the very charter and con&s;titution of the company; was unprecedented, and unparliamentary; and it was hoped would be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould vindicate the honour of the hou&s;e, and prevent &s;uch attempts for the future.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e arguments the mini&s;ter declared, that no ho&s;tile intentions whatever, were conceived
<PB N="328" REF="336">again&s;t the company; that it was the intention of par|liament, and the great wi&s;h of admini&s;tration, to render a great and glorious company, and to &s;ettle it upon the mo&s;t permanent foundation; but that they were entering into a very expen&s;ive commi&s;&s;ion, at a time, that from their former mi&s;conduct, their di&s;tre&s;&s;es were &s;o great, as to put them under the nece&s;&s;ity of apply|ing to the public for a loan of money, and that they owed con&s;iderable arrears to government; that it was undoubtedly the duty of parliament to pre&s;erve them from ruin; that the committee which had been ap|pointed by the hou&s;e to in&s;pect the affairs of the com|pany, have judged it expedient that a re&s;traint &s;hould be laid upon them in re&s;pect to that mea&s;ure, and that as no re&s;traint could po&s;&s;ibly be laid but by act of par|liament, it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring in a bill for that pur|po&s;e. Doubts were al&s;o rai&s;ed in the debate (though no more than doubts) whether the company could legally i&s;&s;ue &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion. If they could, it was a&s;&s;erted, that the company could not give their com|mi&s;&s;ioners proper and effectual authority without the aid of parliament; nor were they, under who&s;e gov|ernment all tho&s;e abu&s;es had ari&s;en, in the lea&s;t equal to the correction of them.</P>
<P>In order to elude the pre&s;ent temper, and to pre|vent the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a precedent &s;o fatal to their rights, two gentlemen who were directors of the India company, and then in their places as members, offered to pledge them&s;elves to the hou&s;e, that the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion &s;hould not be taken off, nor the &s;upervi&s;ors &s;uffered to depart, until &s;uch a progre&s;s was made in the pre|&s;ent enquiry, as &s;hould afford full &s;atisfaction, both with re&s;pect to the &s;tate of their affairs, and the pro|priety of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<PB N="329" REF="337">
<P>This propo&s;al was rejected. It was &s;aid, that though the company might for the pre&s;ent have re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend the departure of the &s;upervi&s;ors, nothing but an act of parliament could make that re&s;olution effec|tual; that they might re&s;cind on one day, their own re&s;olutions or mea&s;ures of the preceding; that the opinion or promi&s;es of the whole court of directors, could afford no &s;ecurity in this re&s;pect, as the direc|tion was inferior to the general courts, where their acts were liable to be over-ruled by the proprietors; and that an advantage might be taken during the Chri&s;tmas rece&s;s, of &s;ending the &s;upervi&s;ors far out of the reach of parliament. That this bill was no inva|&s;ion of any charter, it was only an act to prevent a po&s;&s;ible evil; to prevent the company from crowning all their former extravagance, by entering into an un|nece&s;&s;ary and ruinous expence, when they were ju&s;t upon the brink of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, the whole mea&s;ure, as well as the uncon&s;titutional nature of the committee from which it originated, were condemned in the mo&s;t &s;e|vere and pointed terms. It was &s;aid to be neither more nor le&s;s, than a bill to &s;u&s;pend the laws of the land; that it was &s;ubver&s;ive of rights, which the com|pany not only enjoyed by charter, but had purcha&s;ed from the public, for high and valuable con&s;iderations. That it di&s;graced the dignity of parliament, by a wan|ton exertion of authority, without a motive; that too many complaints were already loudly and publicly made, that every mini&s;terial job was adopted as &s;oon as propo&s;ed, without regard to rea&s;on, argument, or con&s;equences, whereby the re&s;pect, and confidence, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the nature of parliament, were &s;unk to a degree that could &s;carcely be paralleled in the wor&s;t of times. That admini&s;tration had found out an ad|mirable
<PB N="330" REF="338">method of rendering the company great and glorious; they began, by plundering them, under the name of an agreement, of above two millions, and now put the la&s;t hand to the work, by taking advan|tage of the di&s;tre&s;s principally cau&s;ed by that plunder, to deprive them of their charter, and overthrow their con&s;titution; fir&s;t they tempt and terrify them into a ruinous extravagance of grants and dividends, and then as a puni&s;hment, deprive them of whatever this extravagance had left. That indeed the mini&s;ter was lavi&s;h in his declarations of his friendly intentions to|wards the company; and the&s;e declarations mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a full compen&s;ation for every thing they &s;uffered. It was farther &s;aid, that this bill mu&s;t be productive of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences with re&s;pect to the other funds, and put an end to all confidence in the public faith; and it was a&s;ked with great bitter|ne&s;s, what &s;ecurity there could be in a country, where the royal charters, repeatedly ratified and confirmed by acts of parliament, could give no permanent e&s;tab|li&s;hment to property. That the argument of expence was a mere pretext to cover wor&s;e de&s;igns. That it was admitted &s;ome &s;ort of &s;upervi&s;ion was nece&s;&s;ary; and the objection of expence was equally applicable to any &s;ort of &s;upervi&s;ion. As to the want of powers, it was &s;aid, that if there was any defect of that &s;ort in the company's charter, they might be given with equal effect to the commi&s;&s;ioners who are legally appointed, and without any violation of the rights or charter of the company.</P>
<P>To the&s;e and many other &s;trictures, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and extravagance of the company, the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy in their affairs, to|gether with a due regard for their welfare, which was &s;o intimately connected with that of the &s;tate, and a
<PB N="331" REF="339">ju&s;t attention to the &s;ecurity of their creditors, were deemed in general &s;ufficient an&s;wers; it was al&s;o in|&s;i&s;ted on, that this mea&s;ure was no inva&s;ion of their rights; and that if it had, the legi&s;lature had an un|que&s;tioned right to interfere, to prevent their running headlong to ruin. Upon a divi&s;ion, the que&s;tion was carri$d by a great majority, being &s;upported by 114 votes, again&s;t 43 only, who oppo&s;ed the bringing in of the bill.</P>
<P>In the farther progre&s;s of this bill, a petition, couch|ed in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, was pre&s;ented again&s;t it by the India company; and &s;everal of their &s;ervants, con|&s;i&s;ting of the examiner of the records, the auditor of Indian accounts, the accountant general, and the &s;uperintendant of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e accounts, were examined, by the company's de&s;ire, at the bar of the hou&s;e of commons, in order as well to &s;hew a true &s;tate of their affairs, as the mi&s;conduct and di&s;obedience of their &s;ervants abroad, and the con&s;equent nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;upervi&s;ion. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e examina|tions it appeared, that the exorbitances and oppre&s;&s;ions &s;till continued to be committed by the company's &s;er|vants in India. Through their own imprudence, in a&s;king needle&s;s or improper que&s;tions, a full &s;hare of tho&s;e charges, were brought directly home, to &s;ome of tho&s;e gentlemen who were then &s;itting in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It appeared, that &s;ince the year 1765, the company's expences had increa&s;ed, from 700,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to the enor|mous &s;um of 1,700,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> annually. It al&s;o appeared, that government had received by the nett duties, the indemnity upon tea, and the &s;tipulated 400,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> little le&s;s than two millions annually from the company. That the latter had lo&s;t by the indemnity agreement, from its fir&s;t commencement, at lea&s;t one million; of which 700,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> went to government, and the remain|der
<PB N="332" REF="340">to the purcha&s;ers. It was al&s;o &s;hewn, that govern|ment had profited, extraordinarily, by the company, within the la&s;t five years, to the va&s;t amount of 3,395,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> viz. by the produce of the annual &s;tipulat|ed &s;um, 2,200,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and by the increa&s;e of the revenue, compared on a medium with the five pre|ceding years, 1,195,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> That the whole of the company's receipts of dividend during the &s;ame period, &s;carcely amounted to 900,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> more than &s;ix per cent upon its capital, which was the lowe&s;t trading dividend that had ever been made during the mo&s;t expen&s;ive and dangerous war. It appeared upon the whole, that the company's mercantile profits dur|ing the above period, amounted on an average, to 464,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> annually, which would have afforded a dividend of twelve and a half per cent; &s;o that while government profited to the great amount we have men|tioned, the company and proprietary, in&s;tead of bene|fiting a &s;ingle &s;hilling, lo&s;t con&s;iderably of the dividend, which the profits on their trade, only, would have afforded. Thence they argued, that far from being delinquents, their merits with the public were un|paralleled by any example. That the abu&s;es com|mitted by their &s;ervants, were &s;uch as they could not prevent, becau&s;e they could not fore&s;ee; that when they were known, they endeavoured by reiterated orders from home to correct them; that they had prepared various commi&s;&s;ions for that purpo&s;e; one under Lord Clive; a &s;econd, which had been unfor|tunately lo&s;t; and a third, which contrary to their rights, was now propo&s;ed to be re&s;cinded. They con|tended, that parliament could not take this &s;tep, as be|ing contrary to public faith. The matters of fact in the petition, were &s;tated by the evidence with clear|ne&s;s and preci&s;ion. I have been the more particu|lar
<PB N="333" REF="341">in this detail, as it will undoubtedly excite the ad|miration of future ages, to confider the power and opulence, which had been once in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a company of Engli&s;h merchants.</P>
<P>A &s;econd report had been made during this time by the &s;ecret committee, which contained a long &s;tatement of the company's affairs; of their debts, credits, and effects, both at home and abroad. It was objected that this piece was &s;o overloaded with figures and accounts, and &s;o full of intricacies, that it could afford but little information, (except what was taken for granted from the gro&s;s &s;ums) within the narrow time that &s;uch information could be nece&s;&s;ary, with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent bill. This &s;tate of their affairs, was con&s;idered by the company and its friends, as a very unfavourable, if not unfair, repre&s;entation of them; and drew many &s;trictures upon the committee, the darkne&s;s of its proceedings, and the doubtful in|formation that could be obtained through &s;uch a me|dium. It was again lamented, that a fair and open enquiry had not been carried on, according to the happy genius and &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, by which every gentleman would have had an opportuni|ty, of &s;ounding his opinion upon matters as they ap|peared to him&s;elf, and of requiring &s;uch explanations as he thought nece&s;&s;ary; that the time unavoidably &s;pent in &s;uch an inve&s;tigation, would afford lei&s;ure for cool deliberation, and for dige&s;ting, in &s;ome degree, the &s;everal parts of &s;uch complicated matter? where|by by random opinions and ha&s;ty reports, framed in a hurry, and without a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eeing all the &s;ides of the &s;ubject, would be precluded; and at the &s;ame time, the parties concerned, would have an equitable opportunity of attending to their re&s;pective intere&s;ts, clearing up doubtful points, rectifying mi&s;takes, and
<PB N="334" REF="342">the &s;atisfaction of knowing the ground upon which mea&s;ures were to be founded, in who&s;e con&s;equences they were &s;o deeply affected.</P>
<P>On the other hand it was urged, that the commit|tee had acquitted it&s;elf of its tru&s;t with the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed fidelity, and di&s;patched and had gone through &s;o complicated a bu&s;ine&s;s in le&s;s time than could be expected; which could not have been done, if the committee had been open, and &s;ubject to debate on the &s;everal articles. That it is no wonder, that matters of account in &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould appear to produce different conclu&s;ions, according to the differ|ent manner of viewing and &s;tating them. But unle&s;s direct fal&s;ification were proved, the hou&s;e mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily abide by the &s;tatement of tho&s;e whom they had cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the third reading of the bill, coun&s;el was heard in behalf of the company, after which great de|bates aro&s;e. It was advanced by the oppo&s;ers of the bill, that as the company's legal right to the appoint|ment of all its own &s;ervants, and to the entire manage|ment and regulation of its internal affairs, had been &s;o clearly proved as not to admit of a que&s;tion, and that the rapacity, mi&s;conduct, and di&s;obedience, of the &s;ervants in the pre&s;idencies abroad, was &s;o notorious as to be allowed on all hands, no rea&s;onable objection could now lie to the exerci&s;e of that right, when its expediency, and even nece&s;&s;ity, were &s;o evident; and that as every delay in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be ruinous in the highe&s;t degree to the company, and proportionally prejudicial to the nation; it was to be hoped, that no farther oppo&s;ition would be made, to the carrying of the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;upervi&s;ion into im|mediate execution, and that the pre&s;ent bill would be

</FIGURE>
<PB N="335" REF="344">rejected, as founded upon fal&s;e principles, and of an uncon&s;titutional and dangerous tendency.</P>
<P>To this it was an&s;wered, that the evidence given at the bar, and the arguments oppo&s;ed by the coun&s;el again&s;t the bill, contained the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons that could po&s;&s;ibly have been brought to &s;how the urgent nece&s;&s;ity of its being pa&s;&s;ed. That they fully demon|&s;trated the evils in India to be of &s;uch a magnitude, that nothing le&s;s than the legi&s;lature could reform them; that no powers could be granted to the &s;uper|vi&s;ion, competent to the remedy of &s;uch enormities; that the commi&s;&s;ion was be&s;ides faulty in its principles, as the governors and councils in the re&s;pective pre|&s;idencies in India, were joined in power by it, with the &s;upervi&s;ors who were intended to be &s;ent from England; that as the number of the former was per|manent, they mu&s;t &s;oon, by death or &s;ickne&s;s, become a majority; that by this means, the capital offenders, who were the authors of all the evils complained of, would become the judges of their own crimes, and the redre&s;&s;ers of their own oppre&s;&s;ions; was it then by men, who had long rioted with the mo&s;t unrelent|ing cruelty in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their mi&s;erable fellow|creatures, that ju&s;tice was to be re&s;tored to her proper cour&s;e, and the mi&s;chiefs which their iniquities cau&s;ed were to be removed?</P>
<P>That the legi&s;lature had a &s;upreme controuling power, to which all mu&s;t, and ought to &s;ubmit; that this power could never be applied with greater pro|priety, or benefit, than in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, when the welfare and &s;ecurity of many millions, and the pre|&s;ervation of great countries and revenues depended upon its exertion. That laws, as well as charters, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to a change of times and &s;ea&s;ons, and mu&s;t be altered, modelled, or repealed, as circum&s;tances,
<PB N="336" REF="345">and the nature of things require; that it could never have been intended at the time of granting the company's charters, to give them a power of legi&s;lation over great countries, in which it was not po&s;&s;ible to be &s;uppo&s;ed they ever could have any other footing, than a permi&s;&s;ion to trade as inmates and &s;trangers. That India affairs were now under the con&s;ideration of parliament, and while matters were in this &s;u&s;pence, it would be ab&s;urd to allow the com|pany to proceed on their own bottom, and to &s;natch the bu&s;ine&s;s out of their hands: either there was, or there was not, occa&s;ion for the interpo&s;ition of par|liament; if there was, how could the company pre|tend to act independant of them, after they had ap|plied for relief to the mini&s;ter? if there was not, why did they apply?</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide it was ob&s;erved, that parliament|ary interpo&s;ition had hitherto been attended with very little advantage to the company. That the la&s;t par|liament had undertaken, in the year 1767, the regu|lation of their affairs, and after &s;pending the greater part of the &s;e&s;&s;ion upon that bu&s;ine&s;s, the re&s;ult was, the extortion of a va&s;t &s;um of money from the company without an equivalent, and the leaving their affairs to &s;hift for them&s;elves, without the &s;malle&s;t regulation; that their affairs had &s;ince continued open to parlia|ment, without any thing being done, but the making or renewing of bargains for the benefit of government, without the &s;malle&s;t attention to that of the company; that a &s;elect committee had been appointed in the pre|ceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, which had continued its &s;ittings through|out the &s;ummer, and it was not pretended that the company had reaped any advantages from them; and that a &s;ecret committee had newly &s;tarted up, the benefits of which were yet to be di&s;covered, as nothing
<PB N="337" REF="346">but complaints had hitherto attended its proceedings. That if the company was not armed with &s;ufficient powers, for the puni&s;hment of its &s;ervants, and the regulation of its governments in India, the fault lay wholly in admini&s;tration, as a bill had been brought in for that purpo&s;e in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, which was laid by, under pretence of waiting for the di&s;coveries that were to be made by the &s;elect committee.</P>
<P>That the evils apprehended, from the extraordinary powers of the &s;upervi&s;ion falling into the hands of the offenders in India, were merely imaginary; the company had well fore&s;een, and effectually pro|vided again&s;t tho&s;e evils, in the body of the com|mi&s;&s;ion; no act of the &s;upervi&s;ion can be valid, with|out the pre&s;ence of three of the commi&s;&s;ioners; the fir&s;t of the&s;e is to have the ca&s;ting voice, and they are to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the governor, the commander in chief, and &s;econd in council, only as inferior a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and the &s;upervi&s;ors have power, if they &s;ee cau&s;e, to di&s;mi&s;s the governor and the whole council, and have a power of controul in all ca&s;es.</P>
<P>That if the particular intere&s;ts of the company were con&s;idered as matters of indifference, the great revenues, and immen&s;e benefits it afforded to the pub|lic, were not to be wantonly &s;ported with; that as the re&s;traint in the bill was laid for &s;ix months, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year would of nece&s;&s;ity continue it for &s;ix more, twelve whole months, in the pre&s;ent critical &s;tate of their affairs, would be totally lo&s;t to the company, before any intended regulation, whether by parliament, or otherwi&s;e, could po&s;&s;ibly take place; that this delay might be productive of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous effect to the company, as the grievances and evils, which they wanted to remedy or prevent, would have the accumulation of all that time added to
<PB N="338" REF="347">their pre&s;ent amount; and as the de&s;ign of regulation, would be &s;o long known before-hand to the offenders, they would u&s;e &s;uch indu&s;try in their &s;everal depart|ments, that there would not be much left for redre&s;s, by the time that it could take place.</P>
<P>But the great force of the arguments on this &s;ide, was principally directed, to the pre&s;ent unu&s;ual and extraordinary &s;tretch of parliamentary authority; it was acknowledged that a &s;upreme undefined power was ultimately lodged in the legi&s;lature; but it was in|&s;i&s;ted, that &s;uch an exertion of it, could only be ju&s;ti|fied by the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity; and that as no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity now exi&s;ted, it was a wanton violation of public faith, law, and con&s;titution, without an equit|able motive. That it was the inva&s;ion of a right, which parliament had not granted but &s;old; a right for which the faith of the nation was pledged, and which could not be taken away without an act of forfeiture in the company; nor even in that ca&s;e with|out due compen&s;ation. That this violent and danger|ous exertion of power, mu&s;t not only de&s;troy the credit of the India company, but al&s;o affect the bank, the South-&s;ea, and all other public companies, none of which could have any other &s;ecurities than tho&s;e which are now violated; that whenever a war took place, the effects of this unju&s;t and pernicious mea&s;ure, upon the national credit in general, would be too late and too fatally experienced; and that it was not le&s;s dan|gerous in its principle, nor mi&s;chievous in its prece|dent, to the city of London, and all the other cor|porated bodies in the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>A particular charge was al&s;o made upon admini&s;tra|tion, with regard to their motives for this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. It was &s;aid that they had arbitrarily and capriciou&s;ly &s;u&s;pended the legal cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s in the court of
<PB N="339" REF="348">proprietors, and forced this matter into parliament, only to gratify a private re&s;entment; that the com|pany had been officiou&s;ly informed by their chairman, and deputy-chairman, (the only medium through which they could have any communication with govern|ment) that the mea&s;ures relative to the &s;upervi&s;ion were approved of by admini&s;tration; but that as &s;oon as it was found, that the company did not chu&s;e to in|tru&s;t their affairs in the hands of tho&s;e who were nominated for that purpo&s;e by the mini&s;ters, they im|mediately &s;et their face again&s;t the whole mea&s;ure, and now had the fortune to find the hou&s;e &s;o compliant as to adopt their re&s;entments.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;ervable, that many of tho&s;e, who either in them&s;elves or their families, were under great ob|ligations to the company, and particularly &s;uch as had obtained va&s;t fortunes in her &s;ervice, now joined ad|mini&s;tration in this bill. The effects of the party di&s;|putes with re&s;pect to the appointment of &s;upervi&s;ors, were al&s;o very vi&s;ible on this occa&s;ion. Though the que&s;tion was debated warmly and ably by the oppo&s;i|tion, &s;uch was the force of the general odium in which the company &s;tood, and &s;uch the weakne&s;s ari&s;ing from its internal di&s;&s;entions, that the numbers again&s;t the bill were very trifling. Be&s;ides, many of the oppo&s;i|tion had not then come to town. Upon a divi&s;ion late at night, and not a very thin hou&s;e, the bill was car|ried by a majority of more than five to one, the num|bers being 153, to 28 only.</P>
<P>The re&s;training bill was pre&s;ented the next day to the hou&s;e of Lords, and it being &s;o near the holidays, was carried through with the greate&s;t di&s;patch. It did not, however, pa&s;s without oppo&s;ition; though, as in the other hou&s;e, the opponents were few. A noble duke, who had long been di&s;tingui&s;hed in op|po&s;ition,
<PB N="340" REF="349">and who of late had applied him&s;elf with uncommon indu&s;try to obtain a perfect knowledge of of India affairs, traver&s;ed this bill with great vigour and almo&s;t alone, for the &s;hort time in which it was pa&s;&s;ing through its &s;everal &s;tages. As the bill was brought in on a Saturday, and a report was &s;pread in the evening, and in&s;erted in the news-papers, that it had been carried that day through its la&s;t reading, (a matter, however uncommon, which was readily be|lieved) the India company had not time to go through the nece&s;&s;ary forms, for a&s;&s;embling in its corporate capacity, and framing and pre&s;enting a petition, before the following Wedne&s;day, on which it was finally pa&s;&s;ed. A petition &s;igned by 14 proprietors was, however, received, and witne&s;&s;es were examined, and coun&s;el heard at the bar again&s;t the bill.</P>
<P>We &s;hall take notice of &s;ome of the arguments that were u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, &s;o far as they were peculiar to the place, or may &s;eem to throw new light upon the &s;ubject. As the hou&s;e of Lords is clo&s;e &s;hut we are obliged to gather the arguments of the minority in that hou&s;e from their prote&s;ts; tho&s;e of the mini&s;try, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e u&s;ed in the hou&s;e of commons. It was urged again&s;t the bill, that the arbitrary taking away of legal franchi&s;es and capacities, without any legal cau&s;e of forfeiture, e&s;tab|li&s;hes a precedent, which leaves no &s;ort of &s;ecurity to the &s;ubject for his liberties; &s;ince his exerci&s;ing them, in the &s;tricte&s;t conformity to all the rules of law, general equity, and moral conduct, is not &s;ufficient to prevent parliament from intere&s;ting its &s;overeign pow|ers to dive&s;t them of tho&s;e rights; by means of which in&s;ecurity, the honourable di&s;tinction between the Briti&s;h, and other forms of government, is in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t; that this misfortune is greatly growing
<PB N="341" REF="350">upon us, through temporay, occa&s;ional, and partial acts of parliament, which, without con&s;ideration of their conformity to the general principles of our law and con&s;titution, are adopted ra&s;hly and ha&s;tily upon every petty occa&s;ion; that though it may be difficult to fix any legal limit to the extent of legi&s;lative power; it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that parliament is as much bound as any individual to the ob&s;ervance of its own com|pacts; or otherwi&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand what public faith means, or how public credit can &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>That the India company might have been legally called in que&s;tion, and even its charter endangered, for a neglect of exerci&s;ing tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary powers with which it is entru&s;ted, and the u&s;e of which it is now propo&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend; and that it mu&s;t be a go|vernment compo&s;ed of deceit and violence, where men are liable to be puni&s;hed if they decline, or to be re|&s;trained if they endeavour to exerci&s;e their lawful powers. That it appears by evidence, upon oath at the bar, that the company had been authoritatively informed, that the commi&s;&s;ion for regulating their af|fairs, would have been approved of by admini&s;tration; and that their &s;ituation was peculiarly unfortunate, when driven from all confidence in public faith, and the laws of their country, they &s;hould find no &s;e|curity for their charter privileges even in tho&s;e very mini&s;ters, under who&s;e &s;anction they had every po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on to believe they were acting.</P>
<P>It was much objected to, that the bill was brought in at a &s;ea&s;on, when the hou&s;e is always ill attended, and hurried through with a violent, and it was &s;aid, in|decent precipitation. That a rea&s;on of fact was al|ledged in the preamble, &s;tating the expence of the commi&s;&s;ion to be very con&s;iderable: and they had not before them any account or e&s;timate of the expences
<PB N="342" REF="351">actual or probable, nor were &s;upplied with any ac|counts tending to &s;hew the pre&s;ent ability or inability of the company to bear it; &s;o that the Lords were to a&s;&s;ert facts, and on the&s;e facts to ground a law, alter|ing the condition, and &s;u&s;pending the charter rights of the company, without a po&s;&s;ibility of knowing whether the facts be true or fal&s;e; and that with a determination to continue uninformed, it had been re|fu&s;ed to call for the evidence of the directors concern|ing the expence; or in a matter of &s;uch importance, both in it&s;elf and its example, to follow the ancient &s;ettled parliamentary cour&s;e of de&s;iring a conference with the commons, in order to be acquainted with the evidence which they received as the grounds of their proceeding.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, that it mu&s;t be a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to the public, who had for a long time earne&s;tly and anxiou&s;ly looked to the company, or to parliament, for redre&s;s of the grievances in India, to find at length, that the latter is only employed in preventing the former from doing its duty; that in&s;tead of correcting the abu&s;e, they oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the reformation; that when it was expected, that tho&s;e who had wrong|ed the company &s;hould have been brought to exemp|lary puni&s;hment, the &s;uffering company it&s;elf is depriv|ed of its right; and in&s;tead of calling delinquents to account, the per&s;ons legally empowered to correct or re&s;train them, are by parliament &s;u&s;pended from their office.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, be&s;ides many of tho&s;e arguments which we have before &s;een &s;tated in &s;upport of the bill, it is &s;aid, that the charge upon admini&s;tration, of having at one time given a &s;anction to the commi&s;&s;ion for &s;uperintending the company's affairs, was po&s;itive|ly denied, with re&s;pect to &s;uch of its members as be|longed
<PB N="343" REF="352">to that hou&s;e; and rea&s;ons were brought to &s;hew, why it could not be well founded with re&s;pect to others. As to the dangers that were apprehended from this mea&s;ure with re&s;pect to the national credit, they were repre&s;ented as merely imaginary; and it was &s;aid, that it would have a totally contrary effect, as the Dutch, who had much more money in our public funds, than any other foreigners, would think them|&s;elves much &s;afer, when they found that the India Company was under the care and protection of par|liament, than if they had been abandoned to their own wild &s;chemes of regulation and management.</P>
<P>That they had no evidence that this bill was con|trary to the company's inclinations, any more than to their intere&s;ts; that the petition they had heard at the bar, was no corporate act, and was &s;igned only by fourteen proprietors, out of about &s;eventeen hundred, of which the company con&s;i&s;ted; that the va&s;t majority by which it was carried through the other hou&s;e, where the mo&s;t ample information was obtained of the Company's affairs, and the very &s;mall number that had di&s;&s;ented to it, &s;ufficiently &s;hewed the ju&s;tice, proprie|ty, and expediency of the mea&s;ure. Other charges or cen&s;ures were an&s;wered, by the &s;hortne&s;s of the time, and the advantage the company might take of parliament during the rece&s;s. Upon a divi&s;ion, the bill was carried by nearly a proportional majority, to that which had attended it in the hou&s;e of commons, 26 lords having voted for it, to 6 only who oppo&s;ed its pa&s;&s;ing; it was, however, followed by a remarkably pointed and &s;evere prote&s;t."</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of Lords upon this &s;ub|ject, will appear manife&s;t from the prote&s;ts of a num|ber of noble Lords, again&s;t the regulating bill, and upon the motion made by the Duke of Richmond, for
<PB N="344" REF="353">making certain enquiries relative to the Ea&s;t India company, and the holding of a conference with the commons upon that &s;ubject. "Becau&s;e," &s;ay they, "the preamble to this bill, &s;tating defects in the powers of the Ea&s;t-India company, abu&s;es in its admini&s;tration, and injuries to public and commercial credit, ought to have been &s;upported by evidence adapted to the na|ture of the &s;everal matters alledged. But the pro|duction of charters has been refu&s;ed by the hou&s;e; no witne&s;&s;es have been called to a&s;certain the exi&s;tence or quality of the &s;uppo&s;ed abu&s;es; no enquiry has been made into the condition of public credit; and no &s;tate of the company's commercial affairs have ever been laid before us.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Becau&s;e, if the defects in the charters, and abu&s;es in the admini&s;tration of the company, exi&s;t in the manner &s;tated in the preamble, no effectual provi&s;ion is made in the enacting part of the bill for &s;upplying the one, or re-forming the other: on the contrary, the utmo&s;t di&s;traction is introduced into the whole oeconomy of their affairs. The nomination to the &s;ubordinate pre&s;i|dencies, and inferior offices in India, is left to the company; but a &s;uperior pre&s;idency is appointed by parliament to govern tho&s;e inferior officers. The &s;uperior pre&s;idency is to receive orders from the court of directors; but it is left to the private will of the king how far the&s;e orders &s;hall be obeyed. The pre|&s;idency is appointed to make ordinances and regula|tions, but neither directors or company are to deter|mine on their validity. The king alone is to allow or di&s;allow tho&s;e acts, as he &s;hall chu&s;e to &s;ignify his plea&s;ure under his &s;ign manual. This mode of ve&s;ting ultimately the whole management of the company's weighty political affairs, their va&s;t revenues, and their exten&s;ive commerce in the king's private direction,
<PB N="345" REF="354">without any provi&s;ion in the bill for the intervention of any public body, (either the Ea&s;t-India company or the privy-council) or any re&s;pon&s;ible public mini&s;ter, is, we in&s;i&s;t, not only a high and dangerous violation of the yet unque&s;tioned charters of the company, but a total &s;ubver&s;ion of all the principles of the law and con&s;titution of this kingdom.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Becau&s;e the election of executive officers in parliament, is plainly uncon&s;titutional, and an example of the mo&s;t pernicious kind, productive of intrigue and faction, and calculated for extending a corrupt in|fluence in the crown. It frees mini&s;ters from re|&s;pon&s;ibility, whil&s;t it leaves them all the effect of pat|ronage. It defeats the wi&s;e de&s;ign of the con&s;titu|tion, which placed the nomination of all officers, either immediately or derivatively, in the crown, whil&s;t it committed the check upon improper nominations to parliament. But this bill, by confounding tho&s;e pow|ers which the con&s;titution meant to keep &s;eparate, has de&s;troyed this controul, along with every wi&s;e provi&s;ion of the laws to prevent the abu&s;es in the nomination to, or exerci&s;e of office.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Becau&s;e this u&s;urpation of the company's rights in appointing the &s;ervants is loaded with the additional inju&s;tice of a compul&s;ory payment of &s;alaries, arbitrarily fixed and chargeable on the company's revenues, without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, Becau&s;e the violation of the charter is not ju&s;tified by the importance of the provi&s;ions of this bill, which operates only to transfer patronage with|out conferring new powers, it being expre&s;ly provid|ed by the bill, that the&s;e powers &s;hould be the &s;ame as were formerly exerci&s;ed by the company's &s;ervants, under the company's authority; neither is any advan|tage gained with regard to the particular officers nam|ed
<PB N="346" REF="355">in this bill, the per&s;on fir&s;t in rank and importance in the new parliamentary pre&s;idency, being the very &s;ame now at the head of the company's pre&s;idency at Bengal. We mean to reflect neither upon that gentle|man, nor any other, who (for any thing we know to the contrary) may be men of competent ability and good character; but we think our&s;elves bound to de|clare again&s;t the manife&s;t contradiction and ab&s;urdity of this bill, which, &s;tating abu&s;es as now exi&s;ting in India, for the ground of its regulations, yet appoints the very per&s;ons to pre&s;ide there, who, if the allega|tions in the bill be true, mu&s;t be concerned, either by neglect, or actual commi&s;&s;ion, in all the abu&s;es com|plained of.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, Becau&s;e the appointing judges by the nomi|nation of the crown, with large &s;alaries, payable out of the company's revenue, without the company's con|&s;ent, either to the appointment or the payment, is an act of flagrant inju&s;tice, and an outrage on all the rights of property. No nece&s;&s;ity can be pleaded in favour of this violence, as the company did la&s;t year voluntarily propo&s;e a nomination of judges, with far better provi&s;ions for &s;ecuring a proper appointment, than any contained in this bill.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, Becau&s;e the clau&s;e of this bill, which deprives of all &s;hare in the management of their own property, all proprietors not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> capital &s;tock, disfranchi&s;ing without the a&s;&s;ignment of any delinquen|cy or abu&s;e, no le&s;s than 1240 per&s;ons legally quali|fied, is an heinous act of inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion, and ab|&s;urdity, and a gro&s;s perver&s;ion of the high powers en|tru&s;ted to legi&s;lature; the part of the charter which regulates the right of voting, was made to e&s;tabli&s;h exclu&s;ively that cla&s;s of voters which this act has de|&s;troyed; the charter knows of no right of voting, but
<PB N="347" REF="356">the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> capital &s;tock. It excludes all title to &s;uperior influence from &s;uperior property. The &s;everal laws to prevent the &s;plitting of &s;tock are all in affirmance of this principle, and made to &s;ecure this voter. But by a &s;y&s;tem of contradiction, that, except in this bill, has no example, the very grievance of &s;plit|ting of &s;tock by which the proprietor under 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> has been injured, is a&s;&s;igned as the &s;ole ground for depriving him of his franchi&s;e. This lower proprie|tor could not po&s;&s;ibly have been guilty of this offence, and yet he is puni&s;hed; and the large &s;tockholder, who alone could be guilty of the &s;plitting, is indulged with new privileges, in contradiction to the &s;pirit of that charter, which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have violated.</P>
<P N="8">8thly, Becau&s;e the great principle upon which the bill has been &s;upported will, not only in this, but in all ca&s;es, ju&s;tify every infringment of the national faith, and render parliamentary &s;anction the wor&s;t of all &s;e|curities. We never can admit that a mere &s;peculation of political improvement can ju&s;tify parliament in taking away rights, which it expre&s;ly covenanted to pre&s;erve, e&s;pecially when it has received a valuable con&s;ideration for the franchi&s;es &s;o &s;tipulated. Nor are grants of parliament under the&s;e circum&s;tances to be con&s;idered as gratuitous, re&s;umable merely at the plea&s;ure of the giver; but matters of binding contract, forfeitable only on &s;uch delinquency or nece&s;&s;ity as is implied in the nature of every other bargain. With &s;uch matters before us that require the be&s;t, we are denied all manner of information. A bill, the object of which has taken the commons near eight months to con&s;ider, is precipitated through this hou&s;e in little more than eight days, without any attention to par|liamentary u&s;age or decorum; as if the lords were the lowe&s;t of mini&s;terial tools, who are not to be indulged
<PB N="348" REF="357">even with an appearance of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, concerning the mandates they receive.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation we feel the honour of the peerage tarni&s;hed, and its dignity degraded. If the provi&s;ions and precedent of this bill &s;hould render the public faith of Great-Britain of no e&s;timation, the franchi&s;es, rights and properties of Engli&s;hmen precarious, and the peerage di&s;tingui&s;hable only by a more than com|mon mea&s;ure of indolence and &s;ervility; if the bound|le&s;s fund of corruption furni&s;hed by this bill to the &s;er|vants of the crown, &s;hould efface every idea of honour, public &s;pirit, and independence from every rank of people, after &s;truggling vainly again&s;t the&s;e evils, we have nothing left but the &s;atisfaction of recording our names to po&s;terity, as tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;ted the whole of this iniquitous &s;y&s;tem, and as men who had no &s;hare in betraying to blind prejudices or &s;ordid intere&s;t every thing that has hitherto been held &s;acred in this country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LIST>

<P>From all which it appears plain, that the mini&s;try were aiming more at a de&s;potical power, than &s;eeking the real good of the Ea&s;t-India company. There is no manner of doubt but the company's &s;ervants had been guilty of manifold acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, inju&s;tice and tyranny, and de&s;erved a very exemplary puni&s;hment, but it does not appear that the parliament were &s;o
<PB N="349" REF="358">in pur&s;uing ju&s;tice, as they were eager in gra&s;ping at the emoluments which tended to &s;trengthen the power and dominion of the crown. It does not appear that the principal agents of iniquity in India, have, by the authority of parliament, been yet brought to ju&s;tice, or that the company have been much advantaged by the interference of government. The mini&s;terial pro|ceedings in parliament on this occa&s;ion, &s;eem to have had the &s;ame &s;prings with tho&s;e that have for &s;ome years been carried on with regard to the coloni&s;ts in America. The managers have always pretended that they meant the peace, happine&s;s, and pro&s;perity, of the coloni&s;ts, but when their de&s;igns were fairly divulged, their own dominion and emolument have fairly appeared to have been the &s;prings of their actions. A circum&s;tance which naturally falls in the way of the hi&s;tory of this year, confirms the above ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the i&s;land of St Vincent, which are called Carribs, who have been time immemorial in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that i&s;land, and have ju&s;tly claimed the property of the &s;oil, were offended at the Engli&s;h &s;ur|veyors who were &s;ent from England to &s;urvey their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Their oppo&s;ition to this arbitrary act of the Engli&s;h government, was &s;oon determined to be rebellion, and mea&s;ures immediately pur&s;ued to cha&s;ti&s;e the&s;e infidel rebels. By taking a &s;hort view of the hi&s;tory of this people, and the behaviour of the Eng|li&s;h government towards them, we will find &s;ome of the true &s;prings of our modern war with our coloni&s;ts, and dependants upon the &s;upreme legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torians inform us that the Carribs are of two &s;orts, different in their colour as well as in their ex|tract and original. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epi|thets of black and yellow Carribs; the latter being the de&s;cendants of the original natives, and the others
<PB N="350" REF="359">negroes brought from Africa aboard an Engli&s;h &s;hip, which was ca&s;t away upon the coa&s;ts of St Vincent, about an hundred years ago. The negroes having recovered their liberty by this accident were kindly received by the natives, and &s;ettled among them. It is &s;aid, that having women of their own, they &s;till continued a di&s;tinct people, and &s;oon became numer|ous. The two &s;orts of people were not more differ|ent in their colour, than in their temper and di&s;po&s;i|tion; the Americans being timid and inoffen&s;ive, the Africans hardy, de&s;igning, and intrepid. With the&s;e qualifications, together with the acce&s;&s;ion of the negroes which run away from the neighbouring i&s;lands, they &s;oon became &s;uperior in number and power to the natives, who melted away in&s;en&s;ibly, as the &s;trangers encrea&s;ed. Hi&s;tory does not inform us of any ho&s;tili|ties that the&s;e &s;trangers committed upon the natives, and it would rather &s;eem that that by intermingling with the original inhabitants, the character of the peo|ple had changed from that of the weaker to the &s;tronger. In this &s;ituation the Carribs continued for &s;ome time, until the French, from the neighbouring i&s;lands, by their addre&s;s, in&s;inuated them&s;elves among them, and purcha&s;ed the be&s;t of their &s;oil for brandy and other French trinkets, which &s;uited the ta&s;te of the Carribs. By the addre&s;s and cunning peculiar to that nation, they got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t fruitful valleys, that inter&s;ect the mountains on the leeward &s;ide of the i&s;land, and brought them into a &s;tate of cultivation.</P>
<P>The French and natives lived upon good terms for &s;ome time, and the latter embraced the language and religion of the former; yet the neighbourhood of villages and cultivation, was but ill &s;uited to the convenience and genius of a people that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="351" REF="360">upon hunting and fi&s;hing. There is &s;omething in na|ture which in&s;pires men with a de&s;ire of liberty and independence, which, though they naturally love &s;o|ciety, yet they &s;hun crowds, and love a certain retire|ment, &s;till de&s;iring to live free and unre&s;trained in their actions, without ob&s;ervation or interference of others. The Carribs at la&s;t totally abandoned their old po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and retired to the windward and level &s;ide of the i&s;land. The French, it is &s;aid, once attempted to en&s;lave the&s;e people, and that the Carribs defended their liberties &s;o re&s;olutely, that the French were glad to renounce their de&s;ign, and were obliged to ac|knowledge them as a free and independent people.</P>
<P>The French and Carribs continued to live in friend|ly intercour&s;e and corre&s;pondence, and the Carribs retained a power in their own hands of executing ju&s;tice upon tho&s;e who did them any real injuries; and it does not appear that ever the French had rea|&s;on to complain of tho&s;e natives, for any acts of rigour or inju&s;tice in their revenging injuries or affronts. The French king always treated the natives as proprietors of the i&s;land, and &s;hewed them re&s;pect and regard upon every occa&s;ion. But what is &s;omewhat extraordinary, upon the treaty of peace with Great Britain, the French king ceded the i&s;land of St Vincent to England, with|out &s;o much as taking notice of the Carribs. This was giving up what he had always acknowledged was not his own, and the government of Great Britain accepted what they well knew did not belong of right to the king of France. It is no wonder that all na|tions who have any knowledge of the two empires of France and Britain, &s;hould hate both them and the Chri&s;tian religion which they profe&s;s, when they com|mit, under the cloak of that religion, &s;uch manife&s;t acts of inju&s;tice. We &s;carcely find greater violations
<PB N="352" REF="361">of the rights of mankind committed among the mo&s;t barbarous nations, than tho&s;e which the Engli&s;h and French have been guilty of committing towards the inhabitants of the i&s;land of St Vincent.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however, be allowed, that the Carribs, by changing ma&s;ters at the treaty of peace, changed much for the wor&s;e; for, during the French government, they were independent, and were proprietors of the i&s;land, but &s;ince the Engli&s;h received the &s;upremacy, they have lo&s;t their liberty, and are &s;laves, or to u&s;e a more <HI>&s;oft word,</HI> &s;ubjects of Britain. The French, who at the time of the peace were reckoned between four or five thou&s;and, &s;oon after abandoned their e&s;tates, which were purcha&s;ed by new adventurers from England, by which means the Engli&s;h &s;oon be|came a con&s;iderable body, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of va&s;t property. The Carribs were at this time computed to be a thou&s;and fighting men, and upwards; and it is pro|bable they were far more numerous, but in the treaty, they were never con&s;idered but di&s;po&s;ed over as the property of France, to the government of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Though the Carribs were not mentioned in the treaty of peace, yet the court of Britain gave in&s;truc|tions in the year 1764, that they &s;hould not be di&s;turb|ed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates, and the com|mi&s;&s;ioners for &s;ales were directed not to attempt any &s;urvey, without particular orders for that purpo&s;e. The new &s;ettlers, after they had time to look about them, perceived with anxiety, that the plain and fer|tile part of the i&s;land was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Car|ribs, to whom its valuable properties rendered it of little more advantage than any equal extent of the rude&s;t and mo&s;t uncultivated country. Both their fear and their covetou&s;ne&s;s, operated &s;trongly to make
<PB N="353" REF="362">them de&s;ire the removal of the black inhabitants. Repre&s;entations were accordingly made in the warme&s;t manner, both by the new &s;ettlers and the commi&s;&s;ion|ers of &s;ales, to deprive the Carribs of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to grant them &s;uch an equivalent, whether in the i&s;land or in &s;ome other part, as &s;hould be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary. The arguments that were u&s;ed to inforce the&s;e repre&s;entations, were the immediate profits to the crown, from the &s;ale of lands; the dangers ari&s;ing to tho&s;e who had already made purcha&s;es under the faith and protection of government, as well as to the i&s;land in general, from the neighbourhood of a law|le&s;s banditti who were &s;trongly attached to the French. with whom they held a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence in the neighbouring i&s;lands, and who, from their religion and manners, were much aver&s;e to our people and government.</P>
<P>The&s;e repre&s;entations had the intended effect upon the lords of the Briti&s;h trea&s;ury, who, in 1768, i&s;&s;ued in&s;tructions for the &s;urveying and di&s;po&s;ing of the lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Carribs; for the parts of which that were cleared and cultivated, they were to be paid a certain price per acre in money, and were to have other lands a&s;&s;igned them in return, &s;ufficient for their &s;upport, in a different part of the i&s;land. The new lands were to be granted and &s;ecured for ever to them and their po&s;terity, and to be free from all quit|rents, charges, and condition, except peaceable be|haviour and obedience to government: the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions were to de&s;cend among them, according to their own cu&s;toms and u&s;uages of inheritance, and were to be for ever unalienable to any white per&s;on. Five years were given for effecting this change and tran&s;|plantation. Nothing could be more unrea&s;onable and repugnant to the principles of nature, and morality,
<PB N="354" REF="363">than this propo&s;al of the Briti&s;h government. They were fir&s;t to rob and dive&s;t the Carribs of their natural rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and then to &s;ecure to them what they had as undoubted a right to po&s;&s;e&s;s, as the in|habitants of Britain have to po&s;&s;e&s;s the i&s;land where they re&s;ide. The king of Britain had no more right to the i&s;land of St Vincent, except to tho&s;e lands which belonged to the French, than the French have a right to Holland, or any other country which belongs to other people; and therefore, to lay claim to any of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Carribs, or to a&s;&s;ume dominion over them, was perfect tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m. A mini&s;ter that could be guilty of advi&s;ing &s;uch a mea|&s;ure, ought to have an&s;wered for it with his head. The impartial pages of hi&s;tory will po&s;t up to future ages the characters of &s;uch men, as ba&s;e, infamous, and dete&s;table.</P>
<P>The Carribs, from many circum&s;tances, concluded that they were now either to be extirpated, or made &s;laves; they therefore applied to the governor of Martinico for advice and protection. The la&s;t he ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed; and as to the fir&s;t, he advi&s;ed them to &s;ubmit to the Briti&s;h government. This advice had no effect upon them. Their an&s;wer to the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners was noble and ju&s;t, for which they de|&s;erve to be prai&s;ed, and for which all true Engli&s;hmen mu&s;t revere them. They &s;aid, that the whole i&s;land was originally their property; that however, as they had permitted the French to &s;ettle upon a part of it, their king might di&s;po&s;e of that part as he plea&s;ed; but as they were not his &s;ubjects, he had no authority over them, and con&s;equently, could not grant or di&s;|po&s;e of the part of their country which they had re|&s;erved for them&s;elves. They concluded, with ab&s;o|&s;ulutely refu&s;ing to part with their lands, or to admit

It might have been expected, that &s;uch &s;ound rea&s;oning would have convinced any Eng|li&s;hman of the iniquity of proceeding again&s;t the Car|ribs; but avaricious adventurers, and mini&s;ters of &s;tate, who&s;e moral principles hang very ea&s;y upon them, &s;el|dom feel the force of arguments, when the lu&s;t of dominion, and the love of gain rule in their hearts. If the proceedings of the Engli&s;h government, again&s;t the Carribs, can be vindicated upon any principle of &s;ound and good rea&s;oning, it will be ea&s;y to prove that there is now no wickedne&s;s in the univer&s;e. Sel|fi&s;h politicians, or the hirelings of a &s;tate, may attempt to varni&s;h &s;uch actions of a mini&s;ter, with all the fal&s;e colourings of &s;ophi&s;try and deceit; but in &s;pite of all the thick daubings of fal&s;ehood, and the fair &s;trokes oof flattery, the vile complexion of the men and their mea&s;ures, will appear to the view of impartial ob|&s;ervers. Ages to come will &s;tand amazed, when they read in the annals of Britain, that in an aera of liberty, and under the government of a pious and religious &s;overeign, &s;uch unju&s;t and arbitrary proceedings &s;hould have been carried on.</P>
<P>It may appear to &s;ome exceeding &s;trange, that men in a Chri&s;tian nation, brought up under a free govern|ment, and in&s;tructed in the principles of liberty, &s;hould be &s;o abandoned to rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and humanity, as have accepted a commi&s;&s;ion to &s;urvey the lands of a people again&s;t their will, and without their con&s;ent, when no act of inju&s;tice or wickedne&s;s was as yet im|puted to them. Yet &s;uch were found, and actually went upon the practice of &s;urveying the lands of the Carribs. The moderation of that people, as well as their &s;teadine&s;s on this occa&s;ion, might have confound|ed the commi&s;&s;ioners, provided covetous and intere&s;ted men were capable of any generous feelings; for they
<PB N="356" REF="365">&s;hewed an unwillingne&s;s to come to violence, and even when it was in their power, did not de&s;troy them. They &s;hewed, however, &s;o much di&s;gu&s;t at their mak|ing roads into their country, as greatly alarmed the &s;urveyors, and it was found nece&s;&s;ary in the begin|ning of May, 1769, to &s;end an officer and forty men to the &s;urveyors and their company. This &s;mall de|tachment, as if all the country had of right belonged to their ma&s;ters, took po&s;t in the mid&s;t of the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Carribs, where &s;ome temporary huts were erected for their reception.&mdash;But they &s;oon found them&s;elves &s;urrounded, and all communication with their friends, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence cut off, &s;o that they were little better than pri&s;oners. The prudence of the commanding officer, who con&s;idered the inequality of his force, and the extreme unwillingne&s;s of the Carribs, of bringing matters to the la&s;t extremity, not only &s;aved the detachment from being cut off, but pre|vented the &s;malle&s;t violence from being offered on either &s;ide. In the mean time, the &s;urveyors and their company were &s;o frighted that they gave over their work, and were permitted to depart with &s;afety; but their huts were demoli&s;hed, and their new roads broke up, &s;o far as time would permit. This fate of the detachment cau&s;ed an univer&s;al alarm among the Engli&s;h &s;ettlers, who were as yet uncertain of the &s;itu|ation of their friends. They immediately took up arms, and joined the few regular forces that were in the i&s;land, and marched with &s;peed to the aid of their brethren. In&s;tead of enquiring concerning the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, or the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the behaviour of the &s;urveyors and their party, they were determin|ed at all events to &s;hed blood, provided they could do it with &s;ucce&s;s. But as they found the detachment &s;afe, it was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t prudent &s;tep not to
<PB N="357" REF="366">proceed to violence again&s;t the Carribs till they receiv|ed further in&s;tructions from England, and the matter was laid before the king and council. The Carribs agreed to this propo&s;al, and a &s;top was for this time put to the &s;urvey. The Carribs were di&s;po&s;ed to have &s;uffered the Engli&s;h to enjoy what had been &s;urrender|ed to them by the French, and never intended io in|terrupt them in the enjoyment of their own property; but the new &s;ettlers con&s;idered the i&s;land as their own, and wanted to make the natives va&s;&s;als of the king of Britain. The&s;e Indians were of right as inde|pendent in St Vincent, as the Engli&s;h in Britain; it was therefore unju&s;t in the Engli&s;h government to &s;eek to deprive them of their natural rights.</P>
<P>When men have a favourite object in view, &s;uited to their leading pa&s;&s;ion and intere&s;t, it is not ea&s;y to divert them from pur&s;uing it, however incon&s;i&s;tent it may be with the rights and intere&s;ts of others. Though the planters in St Vincent were in no degree equal to the reduction of the Carribs, the number of the rivers in the country, and the richne&s;s of the &s;oil which they had di&s;covered in their late progre&s;s, wrought &s;o powerfully upon their pa&s;&s;ions, that they could not re|frain from expre&s;&s;ing their concern at being prevented from bringing matters to an immediate extremity, in terms which gave no favourable opinion of their ju&s;tice and humanity. Fal&s;e reports were indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad, which kept the i&s;land in perpetual fear and alarm; and the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate complaints were &s;ent home, repre&s;enting the Carribs as a mo&s;t daring and in|corrigible &s;et of rebels. It is &s;omewhat &s;urprizing how a people could be rebels again&s;t a government to which they never owed any allegiance, and which in|&s;tead of de&s;erving any regard from the Carribs, de|&s;erved both to be de&s;pi&s;ed, and re&s;i&s;ted. This may &s;hew
<PB N="358" REF="367">us how ea&s;y it is to form a rebellion, and determine the mo&s;t ju&s;t and righteous people in the world, in|corrigible and ob&s;tinate rebels. The Carribs were never under either the French nor Engli&s;h govern|ment, but were a free and independent people, and therefore owed no allegiance to the monarchs of France or Great Britain. How then could they be rebels, when they were only defending their own rights and properties again&s;t invaders, who were un|ju&s;tly and violently attempting to wre&s;t them from them? The&s;e covetous and cruel planters were &s;o zealous for the extirpation of the Carribs, for the &s;ake of their lands, that they propo&s;ed to have them tran&s;|ported to the coa&s;t of Africa, or to &s;ome de&s;art i&s;land in that quarter. The indignation of the reader mu&s;t ri&s;e at the thoughts of &s;uch a &s;hocking propo&s;al from Briti&s;h Chri&s;tians, who boa&s;t of their liberties, reli|gion, and humanity.</P>
<P>When the new lieutenant-governor of the new i&s;lands arrived at St Vincent's, he i&s;&s;ued a proclama|tion to quiet the minds of the Carribs, and to remove their fears and &s;u&s;picions; nor do we find that any fur|ther violence was committed, than the de&s;truction of the new roads, and the burning of a hou&s;e which be|longed to a per&s;on that was particularly obnoxious to to them; and they quietly &s;ubmitted to the impri&s;on|ment of one of their chiefs, who was &s;u&s;pected of committing this outrage; nor is there the &s;malle&s;t proof, that there was a drop of blood &s;pilt in all this commotion.</P>
<P>The government at home &s;eem to have been anxious of the iniquity of the proceedings again&s;t the Carribs, for not with&s;tanding the warm remon&s;trances that were made in behalf of this mea&s;ure, they &s;eemed for &s;ome time unwilling to proceed to violence again&s;t the&s;e
<PB N="359" REF="368">people. In the beginning of the year 1771, the com|mi&s;&s;ioners held another meeting with &s;everal chiefs of the Carribs, and propo&s;ed a new partition and ex|change of lands upon a narrower &s;cale, and terms more favourable to them, than were contained in the plan that had been formerly propo&s;ed; but the Car|ribs rejected every propo&s;al for parting with their lands, with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s and re&s;olution: And when the que&s;tion was put to them, whether they ac|knowledged them&s;elves &s;ubjects of the king of Great Britain, and would take the oath of allegiance, they boldly refu&s;ed, and an&s;wered in the negative. They &s;aid they were independent, and were not &s;ubject to either the king of Great Britain or France. $word$ o$ this an&s;wer the commi&s;&s;ioners could make no rational re|ply. The king of Britain had no right in ju&s;tice to demand allegiance from a free and independent people; and if any allegiance was due, it was due from the planters to the government of the i&s;land. It has been alledged, that the French in the neighbouring i&s;lands &s;pirited the Carribs to this conduct, which is more than has ever been proved; and &s;uppo&s;e they had, it was no rea&s;on why Britain &s;hould have plundered them of their properties, and robbed them of their natural rights. This refu&s;al of the Carribs was determined to be contumacy, and orders were i&s;&s;ued from home for an ho&s;tile force to be &s;ent again&s;t them. Two regi|ments were ordered from North America, to join as many already at St Vincent's, or what could be &s;pared from the neighbouring i&s;lands for that &s;ervice, which, with his maje&s;ty's &s;hips on that &s;tation, were to reduce the Carribs to a due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government, or, pro|vided they continued ob&s;tinate, that they might be re|moved from the i&s;land to &s;uch places as &s;hould be thought mo&s;t proper for their reception; the &s;tricte&s;t
<PB N="360" REF="369">orders at the &s;ame time being given that they &s;hould be furni&s;hed with &s;hips for their tran&s;portation, plenti|fully provided with provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries, and treated with all imaginable humanity in their pa&s;&s;age. This was a &s;trange kind of humanity and benevolence, fir&s;t to rob a people of their natural rights and po&s;|&s;e&s;ions, without any fault on their part, and then di&s;|creetly &s;et them adrift in &s;ome &s;trange country to &s;hift for them&s;elves, left at the mercy of &s;ome unknown people to be &s;laves, or to peri&s;h as the caprice of &s;trangers &s;hould happen to operate. Such proceedings are perhaps not to be equalled in the hi&s;tory of any prote&s;tant free people, upon the face of the globe. The &s;ucce&s;s and event of this expedition was not known when this affair of St Vincent became a matter of debate in parliament, in December 9th, this year. The arguments on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, will ap|pear in the following parliamentary hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"Soon after the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, upon the pre&s;enting of an e&s;timate from the war-office in the committee of &s;upply, of the land-&s;ervice for the en&s;u|ing year, the number of troops that were &s;tated to be in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, gave an opportunity to the gentlemen in oppo&s;ition, to animadvert upon this expedition, and to give notice, that they would, on a future day, propo&s;e an enquiry, into its nature, ju&s;tice, and propriety, together with the motives that led to &s;o extraordinary a mea&s;ure. This enquiry being agreed to by admini&s;tration, the matter was afterwards frequently brought up; but &s;till deferred, in hopes of obtaining new information, and to give an opportunity of procuring and con&s;idering the nece&s;&s;ary papers.</P>
<P>It was accordingly a con&s;iderable time after the Chri&s;tmas rece&s;s, before this affair was taken finally into con&s;ideration; when at length, two general
<PB N="361" REF="370">officers were examined, as to the late&s;t accounts they had received of the &s;tate of their regiments, which were then employed on the &s;ervice again&s;t the Car|ribs. One of the&s;e gentlemen read part of a letter which he had received upon the &s;ubject from St Vin|cent's, in which the expedition was greatly complain|ed of, not only in re&s;pect of its having been under|taken in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, which had occa&s;ioned a great mortality among the troops, but al&s;o with regard to its inju&s;tice and cruelty, with both of which it was &s;trongly charged by the writer; who emphatically complained, that the poor Carribs had been very ill u&s;ed; and wi&s;hed, with the energy characteri&s;tic of an officer, that the contrivers and promoters of the expedition, might be brought to a &s;peedy and &s;evere account. By the &s;ame authority it was repre&s;ented, that the woods were &s;o thick, that the Carribs killed our men, with the greate&s;t &s;ecurity to them&s;elves, and without their being able even to &s;ee the enemy that de&s;troyed them; that at the time of writing the letter, which was on the 14th of November, the troops had not been able to penetrate above four miles into their country.</P>
<P>It was not then enquired of admini&s;tration, whether they had received any late accounts from the i&s;land; when to the &s;urprize of every body, it appeared that their late&s;t intelligence from thence, was above a month prior in date, to the letter which had been read by the general. A gentleman who had been lieutenant-governor of the New I&s;lands, was examined as to the temper, behaviour, and di&s;po&s;ition of the Carribs, of all which he gave a very favourable ac|count, and repre&s;ented them as a quiet inoffen&s;ive people; he was farther a&s;ked, if he had heard that the planters were envious of them for their lands, to
<PB N="362" REF="371">which he an&s;wered in the affirmative; and being pre&s;&s;ed as to particular names, mentioned one of con|&s;iderable rank and con&s;equence in the i&s;land, and who had a principal &s;hare in all the mea&s;ures that had been pur&s;ued for &s;tripping them of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Some officers were examined, who had &s;erved, or borne command, at different times in St Vincent's; the&s;e gentlemen, in general, gave favourable accounts of the Carribs, and attributed entirely their late tur|bulent and &s;u&s;picious temper, to the attempts that had been made to deprive them of their lands: they all concurred in their accounts of the unhealthine&s;s of the i&s;land, and particularly in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, when, they declared, it mu&s;t prove fatal to any troops that were under a nece&s;&s;ity of acting in it, and that the con&s;titution of &s;uch as e&s;caped with life, would be totally ruined.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, one of the principal planters in the i&s;land, and of con&s;iderable rank by his office, with &s;ome others, were examined. They, in general, de|&s;cribed the Carribs as a faithle&s;s, cruel, and treacher|ous race, who were abandoned to all manner of ex|ce&s;&s;es, particularly with re&s;pect to liquor, in which &s;tate they were capable of the mo&s;t barbarous actions. That while they continued on the i&s;land, there could be no &s;ecurity for the per&s;ons or property of the in|habitants; they were charged with murders, robberies, with enticing the negro &s;laves from their ma&s;ters, and de&s;troying others whom they caught in the fields; no particular proofs were, however, brought in &s;up|port of the&s;e charges. The connections and intelli|gence which the Carribs held with the French, and their application to the governor of Martinique for protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, were &s;hewn in a very danger|ous light; and no care was neglected to de&s;cribe
<PB N="363" REF="372">the fatal con&s;equences that mu&s;t attend the i&s;land, whenever a war broke out with France, with &s;uch a deadly enemy lying in its bo&s;om. Their mortal en|mity to our government and people, was al&s;o much in|&s;i&s;ted on; and it was concluded upon the whole, that there was no other alternative, but that either his maje&s;ty's natural &s;ubjects, or the Carribs, mu&s;t quit the i&s;land, if the latter are permitted to continue in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of independence.</P>
<P>After &s;everal &s;trictures upon the nature of this evi|dence, and on the intere&s;ted views by which it was &s;aid to be apparently directed, the following motions were made, 1&s;t, That the expedition again&s;t the Carribs in the i&s;land of St Vincent was undertaken, without &s;ufficient provocation on the part of tho&s;e unhappy people, and at the in&s;tigation of per&s;ons intere&s;ted in their de&s;truction, and appears to be intended to end in their total extirpation; 2dly, That the &s;ending the troops, part of which were totally unprovided with camp equipage and nece&s;&s;aries, on that &s;ervice, in the unhealthy &s;ea&s;on of the year, is not ju&s;tified by any nece&s;&s;ity of immediately increa&s;ing the military force in that i&s;land, was contrary to the voice of the governour, and mu&s;t prove unnece&s;&s;arily de&s;tructive to &s;ome of the be&s;t troops in the &s;ervice, probably defeat the purpo&s;e for which they were &s;ent, and bring di&s;grace on his maje&s;ty's arms; and, 3dly, That an humble addre&s;s be pre&s;ented, de&s;iring that his maje&s;ty will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to acquaint the hou&s;e, by who&s;e ad|vice the mea&s;ure was undertaken, of attacking the Carribs in the i&s;land of St Vincent; and of &s;ending the troops for that purpo&s;e in the mo&s;t unhealthy &s;ea|&s;on of the year; a mea&s;ure equally repugnant to the known humanity of his maje&s;ty's temper, di&s;graceful
<PB N="364" REF="373">to his arms, and di&s;honourouble to the character of the Briti&s;h nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e motions were principally &s;upported upon the inju&s;tice of the mea&s;ure, and the di&s;honour it brought upon our national character, as being equally a viola|tion of the natural rights of mankind, and contrary to his maje&s;ty's proclamation of the year 1764, in fa|vour of the Carribs; on the extreme cruelty of at|tempting to tran&s;port a whole people from their na|tive &s;oil, and to land them defencele&s;s on the coa&s;t of Africa, where they had no right, no property, no connection, and where they mu&s;t be liable to all the dangers and enmities, to which Europeans, or any others, who were turned adrift in a &s;trange country, would be &s;ubject; that they had been guilty of no act of forfeiture, even &s;uppo&s;ing them to be natural &s;ub|jects of Great Britain, unle&s;s an oppo&s;ition to a violent inva&s;ion of their rights and properties, was to be con&s;idered as &s;uch; that the only evidence of any weight again&s;t them, was him&s;elf the devi&s;er of the projects that had been formed for their extirpation, was deeply intere&s;ted in their de&s;truction; that on the contrary, the united te&s;timony on the other &s;ide, where there was not a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t bias or partiality, was uniformly in favour of the Car|ribs, and repre&s;ented them as a quiet, peaceable, and inoffen&s;ive people, and to all appearance, well affected to our government, until they were urged by violence and inju&s;tice to a different conduct. The&s;e arguments, with &s;uch others as the &s;tate we have already repre|&s;ented a&s;&s;ord, were concluded with &s;evere &s;trictures on the weakne&s;s of tho&s;e coun&s;els, which had blindly adopted the views of avaricious, rapacious, and mer|cile&s;s planters, and thereby rendering government the in&s;trument of their iniquitous de&s;ign, engaged it in
<PB N="365" REF="374">cruel, unju&s;t, and di&s;honouranle mea&s;ures, which were not more injurious to the Carribs, than de&s;tructive to our&s;elves, by wantonly &s;porting with the con&s;titutions and lives of &s;ome of our brave&s;t troops, who&s;e former &s;ervices merited another return, and who were now &s;acrificed upon an inglorious &s;ervice, in which they were a&s;hamed to draw their &s;words.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide it was ob&s;erved, that an amazing fund of tenderne&s;s and humanity had been di&s;played in favour of the Carribs, while the &s;malle&s;t degree of either was refu&s;ed to our natural born &s;ubjects and countrymen, who had purcha&s;ed e&s;tates at high prices from the crown, under the &s;anction of its protection and &s;ecurity, and who&s;e lives and fortunes were at &s;take in the event of the pre&s;ent expedition. That the charge of inju&s;tice was ill founded, as the yellow Carribs, who were the aborigines, and real proprie|tors of the i&s;land, were in no degree affected by the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, except only &s;o far as they would obtain &s;ecurity, by the reduction or removal of a cruel and perfidious race of &s;avages, by whom they had been nearly exterminated; that it could not be pretended, that the black Carribs had any legal or natural rights in the i&s;land, but tho&s;e which they had obtained through the kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality of the natives; and that tho&s;e rights, would, in the eye of the &s;tricte&s;t ju&s;tice, have been fully cancelled, by their &s;ub&s;equent conduct and ingratitude.</P>
<P>That the charge of cruelty was equally ill founded; the removal of the black Carribs being the la&s;t re&s;ort; and only to be put in execution, in ca&s;e of their prov|ing &s;o incorrigibl&eacute;, that all means would be found in|effectual for reducing them to &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to government, as was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, not only for the &s;ecurity but the pre&s;ervation of the i&s;land;
<PB N="366" REF="375">that even in that la&s;t extremity, the mea&s;ure of tran&s;|portation was guarded from being accompanied with any circum&s;tances of cruelty, or even of hard&s;hip, except tho&s;e which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from their feel|ings, on quitting a country in which they had hitherto lived, and going to another, equally fit for them, but with which they were not yet acquainted; that whether they were removed to the coa&s;t of Africa, or to the i&s;land of St Mathew, care had been taken, that they were to have &s;ufficient lands a&s;&s;igned them for their &s;upport, and were to be laid down, in nearly the &s;ame degrees of latitude and climate, and in a country fur|ni&s;hed with much the &s;ame advantages as to fi&s;hing and hunting, which they had enjoyed at St Vin|cent's.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, that government had neither adopted the views, nor been mi&s;led by the &s;chemes of intere&s;t|ed planters; that it had duly weighed, as well the circum&s;tances of the i&s;land, as the repre&s;entations of the governour, council, and a&s;&s;embly, together with tho&s;e of the commi&s;&s;ioners for the &s;ale of lands; that as the Carribs were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of near two thirds of the profitable lands, and the French inhabitants of a great part of the remainder, it was evident, that we never could in that &s;tate, have a natural intere&s;t or &s;trength in the i&s;land, &s;ufficient for its &s;ecurity; that as the&s;e lands were of no particular value to the Carribs, who had neither means nor inclination to cultivate them, equitable terms had been repeatedly propo&s;ed to them for an exchange, all of which, they not only contu|maciou&s;ly rejected, but daringly difclaimed all allegi|ance to the king, and refu&s;ed all obedience to govern|ment. As to the &s;trictures that had been pa&s;&s;ed, with re&s;pect to the employment of the troops in an un|healthy climtae and &s;ea&s;on, they were an&s;wered by
<PB N="367" REF="376">the nece&s;&s;ity of the occa&s;ion; and the mea&s;ure ju&s;tified upon that principle, by the practice of all ages.</P>
<P>Upon a divi&s;ion on the &s;eparate que&s;tions, after long debates, the fir&s;t motion was rejected by a ma|jority of 206, again&s;t 88 who &s;upported it; the majo|rity was le&s;s upon the others; as the hou&s;e grew thin|ner.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, the expedition which gave birth to this enquiry, was al&s;o terminated. The Car|ribs, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trength of their fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, their courage, in which they were not at all deficient, and their expertne&s;s in the u&s;e of fire arms, were un|der many di&s;advantages in this war. They were &s;ur|rounded by &s;ea and land, their quarters becoming every day more contracted, were cut off from their great &s;ource of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by fi&s;hing, and their bodies worn down by continual watching and fatigue. Our troops al&s;o &s;uffered infinitively in the &s;ervice. With|out a con&s;iderable reinforcement, it was probable, the reduction of the enemy could not be effected. The object, either for advantage or glory, was not worthy of &s;o much toil and trea&s;ure, even if the ju&s;tice of &s;uch a war could be clearly defended.</P>
<P>The&s;e mutual &s;ufferings, and the di&s;po&s;itions they gave ri&s;e to, brought on a treaty between the Car|ribs and Major General Dalrymple, who commanded the forces, by which the former obtained better con|ditions than they had rea&s;on to expect. The original object of the war, the tran&s;plantation to Africa, was wholly abandoned. The Carribs on their part ac|knowledged his maje&s;ty's &s;overeignty without re&s;erve, agreed to take an oath of fidelity and allegiance, and to &s;ubmit to the laws and government of the i&s;land, &s;o far as relates to their intercour&s;e, and to all tran&s;ac|tions with the white inhabitants; but in their own
<PB N="368" REF="377">di&s;tricts, and in all matters that relate to their inter|cour&s;e with each other, they are to retain their an|cient polity, and &s;till to be governed by tho&s;e cu&s;toms and u&s;ages, to which they have given the force of laws. They have al&s;o ceded a large tract of very valuable land to the crown; but the di&s;tricts which they &s;till retain, are &s;ecured in perpetuity to them and their po&s;terity. There are a number of other articles which relate to dome&s;tic regulation, or tend to the future tranquillity and &s;ecurity of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s upon this expedition, though con&s;iderable, was not altogether &s;o great as was apprehended from the nature, length, and &s;everity of the &s;ervice. The killed and wounded did not much exceed 150, among the former of which was a lieutenant-colonel; and &s;ome other officers; the lives lo&s;t by the climate a|mounted to 110; but there remained 428 &s;ick, at the time of concluding the treaty.</P>
<P>After &s;uch proceedings again&s;t an innocent and in|offen&s;ive people, which owed no allegiance to the Briti&s;h government, and had given the nation no real offence, the after behaviour of the mini&s;try towards the American coloni&s;ts, will be no &s;urprize to any per&s;ons who examine the cau&s;es of things attentively.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> The American Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embles&mdash;Forms an a&s;&s;ociation&mdash;Their re&s;olves&mdash;They addre&s;s the people of Great Britain&mdash;They write to the people of Quebec&mdash;A view of their rights&mdash;Proceedings at home, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the beginning of the pre&s;ent controver&s;y with the colonies, it was always imagined, and al&s;o affirmed at home by the mini&s;try and their friends, that the coloni&s;ts were greatly divided among them|&s;elves; that they would never unite; that they would not hang together; that they were only under a temporary ferment, created by the artifice of popular and de&s;igning men, that would &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide when once they &s;aw that Great Britain was in earne&s;t to &s;upport her authority. And that notwith&s;tanding the riotous di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of the colonies, they were in general cowards, and dur&s;t not appear before the king's forces. This was the &s;tile of the mini&s;try and their party at home, and was echoed in all the venal pamphlets and news papers publi&s;hed throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly of the repre&s;entatives of twelve of the colonies, which &s;ince has received the name of the congre&s;s met at Philadelphia, on the 5th of September this year, and, after more than a month's delibera|tion, proceeded to &s;everal re&s;olutions which &s;hewed that they were in earne&s;t, as well as unanimous in their oppo&s;ition to the new &s;tatutes of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature. Upon the 14th of October, the congre&s;s
<PB N="370" REF="379">proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s, and after reciting tho&s;e laws that were particularly obnoxious, they came to &s;everal animated re&s;olutions, which, in their then &s;ituation, were &s;urprizing to all the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Friday, <HI>October</HI> 14, 1774.
<P>The Congre&s;s came into the fol|lowing Re&s;olutions.&mdash;</P>
<P>WHEREAS, &s;ince the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, the Briti&s;h parliament claiming a power of right to bind the people of America, by &s;tatute in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, hath in &s;ome acts expre&s;sly impo&s;ed taxes on them, and in others under various pretences, but in fact for the pur|po&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, hath im|po&s;ed rates and duties payable in the&s;e colonies, e&s;tabli&s;hed a board of commi&s;&s;ioners with uncon&s;titu|tional powers, and eztended the juri&s;diction of courts of admiralty, not only for collecting the &s;aid du|ties, but for the trial of cau&s;es merely ari&s;ing within the body of a county.</P>
<P>And whereas in con&s;equence of other &s;tatutes, judges, who before held only e&s;tates at will in their offices, have been made dependant on the crown alone for their &s;alaries, and &s;tanding armies kept in time of peace. And it has lately been re|&s;olved in parliament, that by force of a &s;tatute made in the thirty-fifth year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth, coloni&s;ts may be tran&s;|ported to England and tried there upon accu&s;ations for trea&s;ons and mi&s;pri&s;ions, or concealment of trea|&s;ons committed in the colonies; and by a late &s;tatute, &s;uch trials have been directed in ca&s;es therein mentioned.</P>
<P>And whereas in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, three &s;tatutes were made: one intituled, <Q>An act to &startq;di&s;continue in &s;uch manner, and for &s;uch time as are therein men|tioned, the landing and di&s;charg|ing, lading or &s;hipping of goods, wares and merchandize, at the town, and within the harbour of Bo&s;ton, in the province of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts Bay, in North Ameri|ca." Another intituled, "An act for the better regulating the government of the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, in New-England.&endq;</Q> And another intitul|ed, <Q>An act for the impartial ad|mini&s;tration &startq;of ju&s;tice, in the ca&s;es of per&s;ons que&s;tioned for any act done by them in the exe|cution of the law, or for the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of riots and tumults, in the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay, &endq;in New-England.</Q> And another &s;tatute was then made, <Q>&startq;For making more effectual provi|&s;ion for the government of the &endq;province of Quebec, &amp;c.</Q> All which &s;tatutes are impolitic, unju&s;t and cruel, as well as uncon&s;titu|tional, and mo&s;t dangerous and de|&s;tructive of American rights.</P>
<P>And whereas, a&s;&s;emblies have been frequently di&s;&s;olved, contrary to the rights of the people, when they attempted to deliberate on grievances; and their dutiful, hum|ble, loyal, and rea&s;onable petitions to the crown for redre&s;s, have been repeatedly treated with contempt by his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The good people of the &s;everal colonies of New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, Rhode-I&s;land and and Providence plantations. Con|necticut, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Pen&s;ylvania, New-Ca&s;tle, Kent and Su&s;&s;ex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina and South-Carolina ju&s;tly alarmed at the&s;e ar|bitrary proceedings of parliament and admini&s;tration, have &s;everally elected, con&s;tituted, and appointed deputies to meet and &s;it in general congre&s;s in the city of Philadelphia, in order to obtain &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;h|ment as that their religion, laws, and liberties may not be &s;ubverted: Whereupon the deputies &s;o ap|pointed being now a&s;&s;embled in a full and free repre&s;entation of the&s;e co|lonies, taking into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration the be&s;t means of at|taining the ends afore&s;aid, do in the fir&s;t place, as Engli&s;hmen their ance&s;tors in like ca&s;es have u&s;ually done, for a&s;&s;erting and vindicating their rights and liberties, DE|CLARE.</P>
<P>That the inhabitants of the Eng|li&s;h colonies in North-America, by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the Engli&s;h con&s;titu|tion, and the &s;everal charters or compacts, have the following RIGHTS.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. 1, That they are entitled to life, liberty, and pro|perty; and they have never ceded to any &s;overeign power whatever, a right to di&s;po&s;e of either without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. 2. That our ance&s;tors, who fir&s;t &s;ettled the&s;e colonies, were at the time of their emigration from the mother coun|try, entitled to all the rights, liber|ties, and immunities of free and natural born &s;ubjects, within the realm of England.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. 3. That by &s;uch emigration they by no means forfeited, &s;urrendered, or lo&s;t any of tho&s;e rights, but that they were, and their de&s;cendants now are, en|titled to the exerci&s;e and enjoy|ment of all &s;uch of them, as their local and other circum&s;tances enable them to exerci&s;e and enjoy.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> 4. That the foundation of Engli&s;h liberty and of all free government, is a right in the people to participate in their legi&s;lative council: and as the Engli&s;h colon|i&s;ts are not repre&s;ented, and from their local and other circum&s;tances cannot properly be repre&s;eted in the Briti&s;h parliament, they are en|titled to a free and exclu&s;ive power of legi&s;lation in their &s;everal pro|vincial Legi&s;latures, where their right of repre&s;entation can alone be pre&s;erved, in all ca&s;es of taxa|tion and internal polity, &s;ubject on|ly to the negative of their &s;over|eign, in &s;uch manner as has been heretofore accu&s;tomed: But from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and a re|gard to the mutual intere&s;ts of both countries, we chearfully con&s;ent to the operation of &s;uch acts of the Briti&s;h parliament as are bona &s;ide, re&s;trained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring the commercial advan|tages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the com|mercial benefits of its re&s;pective members, excluding every idea of taxation internal or external, for rai&s;ing a revenue on the &s;ubjects in America without their con&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. 5. That the re&s;pective coonlies are entitled to the common law of England, and more e&s;pecially to the great and ine&s;timable priviledge of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, ac|cording to the cour&s;e of that law.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> 6. That they are en|titled to the benefit of &s;uch of the Engli&s;h &s;tatutes, as exi&s;ted at the time of their colonization; and which they have, by experience, re&s;pectively found to be applicable to their &s;everal local and other cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. 7. That the&s;e, his maje&s;ty's colonies, are likewi&s;e en|titled to all the immunities and privi|leges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters, or &s;ecured by their &s;everal codes of provincial laws.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. 8. That they have a right peaceably to a&s;&s;emble, con&s;ider of their grievances, and petition the king; and that all pro|&s;ecutions, prohibitory proclama|tions, and commitments for the &s;ame, are illegal.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. 9. That the keeping a &s;tanding army in the&s;e colonies, in times of peace, without the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature of that colony in which &s;uch army is kept, is again&s;t law.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. 10 It is indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to good govern|ment, and rendered e&s;&s;ential by the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, that the con&s;tituent branches of the legi&s;la|ture be independant of each other; that, therefore, the exerci&s;e of le|gi&s;lative power in &s;everal colonies, by a council appointed, during plea&s;ure, by the crown, is uncon|&s;titutional, dangerous, and de&s;truc|tive to the freedom of American legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>All and each of which, the afore|&s;aid deputies in behalf of them|&s;elves, and their con&s;tituents, do claim, demand, and in&s;i&s;t on, as their indubitable rights and liber|ties; which cannot be legally taken from them, altered or abridged by any power whatever, without their own con&s;ent, by their repre&s;enta|tives in their &s;everal provincial le|gi&s;latures.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of our inquiry, we find many infringements and vio|lations of the foregoing rights; which, from an ardent de&s;ire that harmony and mutual intercour&s;e of affection and intere&s;t may be re|&s;tored, we pa&s;s over for the pre&s;ent, and proceed to &s;tate &s;uch acts and mea&s;ures as have been adopted &s;ince the la&s;t war, which demon&s;trate a &s;y&s;tem formed to en&s;lave America.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> N. C. D. That the fol|lowing acts of parliament are in|fringements and violations of the rights of the coloni&s;ts; and that the repeal of them is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, in order to re&s;tore har|mony between Great Britain and the American colonies, viz.</P>
<P>The &s;everal acts of 4 George III. ch. 15. and ch. 34.&mdash;5 Geo. III. ch. 25.&mdash;6 Geo. III. ch. 52.&mdash;7 Geo. III. ch. 41 and ch 46.&mdash;8 Geo. III. ch. 22. which impo&s;e duties for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue in America, extend the powers of the admiralty courts beyond their ancient limits, deprive the Ameri|can &s;ubject of trial by jury, autho|ri&s;e the judges certificate to indem|nify the pro&s;ecutor from damages, that he ought otherwi&s;e be liable to, requiring oppre&s;&s;ive &s;ecurity from a claimant of &s;hops and goods &s;eiz|ed, before he &s;hall be allowed to de|fend his property, and are &s;ubver|&s;ive of American rights.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, 12 Geo. III. ch. 24. intitul|ed <Q>An act for the better &s;ecuring &startq;his maje&s;ty's dock-yards, maga|zines, &s;hips, ammunition and &endq;&s;tores.</Q> Which declares a new offence in America, and deprives the American &s;ubject of a con&s;titu|tional trial by jury of the vicinage, by authori&s;ing the trial of any per&s;on charged with the committing of any offence de&s;cribed in the &s;aid act out of the realm, to be indicted and tried for the &s;ame in any &s;hire or county within the realm.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the three acts pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, for &s;top|ping the port and blocking up the harbour of Bo&s;ton, for altering the charter and government of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay, and that which is in|tituled, <Q>An act for the better ad|mini&s;tration &startq;&endq;of ju&s;tice, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Al&s;o the act pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion for e&s;tabli&s;hing the Roman catholic religion in the province of Quebec, aboli&s;hing the equitable &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h laws, and erecting a tyranny there, to the great dan|ger, from &s;o total a di&s;&s;imularity of religion, law and government to the neighbouring Briti&s;h colonies, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of who&s;e blood and trea&s;ure the &s;aid country was conquered from France.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the act pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion for the better providing &s;uitable quarters for officers and &s;oldiers in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice in North-America.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, that the keeping a &s;tand|ing army in &s;everal of the&s;e co|lonies, in time of peace, without the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature of that colony in which &s;uch army is kept, is again&s;t law.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s, from time to time, pa&s;&s;ed the following Re&s;olves:</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That this Congre&s;s do approve of the oppo&s;ition made by the inhabitants of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ett's-Bay, to the execution of the the late acts of parliament; and if the &s;ame &s;hall be attempted to be carried into execution by force, in &s;uch ca&s;e, all America ought to &s;upport them in their oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That it is the opinion of this body, that the removal of the people of Bo&s;ton into the coun|try, would be, not only extremely difficult in the execution, but &s;o important in its con&s;equences, as to require the utmo&s;t deliberation before it is adopted. But in ca&s;e the provincial meeting of that colony &s;hall judge it <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;|&s;ary, it is the opinion of this Con|gre&s;s, that all America ought to contribute towards recompen&s;ing them for the injury they may there|by &s;u&s;tain; and it will be recom|mended accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That this Congre&s;s do recommend to the inhabitants of the colony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, to &s;ubmit to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, where it cannot be procured in a legal and peaceable manner, under the rules of the charter, and the laws founded thereon, until the effects of our application for a repeal of the acts, by which their charter rights are infringed, is known.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly,</HI> That every per&s;on or per&s;ons whom&s;oever, who &s;hall take, accept, or act un|der any commi&s;&s;ion or authority, in anywi&s;e derived from the act pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment, changing the form of go|vernment, and violating the charter of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, ought to be held in dete&s;ta|tion and abhorrence by all good men and con&s;idered as the wicked tools of that de&s;poti&s;m, which is preparing to de&s;troy tho&s;e rights, which God, nature, and compact hath given to America.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved unanimou&s;ly,</HI> That the people of Bo&s;ton and the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ett's-Bay, be advi&s;ed &s;till to conduct them&s;elves peaceably to|wards his excellency General Gage, and his maje&s;ty's troops now &s;tationed in the town of Bo&s;|ton, as far as can po&s;&s;ibly con&s;i&s;t with their immediate &s;afety, and the &s;ecurity of the town; avoiding and di&s;countenancing every viola|tion of his maje&s;ty's property, or any in&s;ult to his troops; and that they peaceably and firmly per&s;e|vere in the line in which they are now conducting them&s;elves on the defen&s;ive.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That the &s;eizing, or attempting to &s;eize, any per&s;on in America, in order to tran&s;port &s;uch per&s;on beyond the &s;ea, for trial of offences committed within the body of a county in America, be|ing again&s;t law, will ju&s;tify, and ought to meet with re&s;i&s;tance and repri&s;al.</P>
<P>Saturday, <HI>October</HI> 22.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> As the opinion of the congre&s;s, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary that a congre&s;s &s;hould be held on the 10th day of May next, unle&s;s the redre&s;s of grievances, which we have de&s;ired, be obtained before that time.&mdash;And we recommend that the &s;ame be held at the city of Philadelphia, and that all the co|lonies in North-America chu&s;e de|puties as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to attend &s;uch congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, <HI>October</HI> 25.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That the congre&s;s in their own names, and in behalf of all tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent, do pre&s;ent their grateful acknowledge|ments to tho&s;e truely noble, honourable. and patriotic advo|cates of civil and religious liberty; who have &s;o generou&s;ly and pow|erfully, though un&s;ucce&s;sfully, e&s;pou&s;ed and defended the cau&s;e of America, both in and out of parliament.</P></NOTE> The a&s;&s;ociation which they entered into is a bold and intripid re&s;olu|tion to maintain what they con&s;ider to be their ju&s;t rights and privileges, and a purpo&s;e to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as may be&s;t &s;upport the&s;e rights again&s;t in|va&s;ion, from the mini&s;terial power of Great Britain.

In pro&s;ecution of which &s;y&s;tem, various acts of parliament have been pa&s;&s;ed for rai&s;ing a revenue in America, for depriving the American &s;ubjects, in many in&s;tances, of the con&s;titutional trial by jury, ex|po&s;ing their lives to danger, by directing a new and illegal trial beyond the &s;eas, for crimes alledged to have been committed in America: And in pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, &s;everal late, cruel, and oppre&s;&s;ive

<P><HI>Third,</HI> As a non-con&s;umption agreement, &s;trictly adhered to, will be an effectual &s;ecurity for the ob&s;er|vation of the non-importation, we, as above, &s;olemn|ly agree and a&s;&s;ociate, that, from this day, we will not purcha&s;e or u&s;e any tea imported on account of the Ea&s;t-India company, or any on which a duty hath been or &s;hall be paid; and from and after the fir&s;t day of March next, we will not purcha&s;e or u&s;e any Ea&s;t India tea whatever, nor will we, nor &s;hall any per&s;on for or under us, purcha&s;e or u&s;e, any of tho&s;e goods, wares or merchandize, we have agreed not to import, which we &s;hall know, or have cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, were imported after the fir&s;t day of Decem|ber, except &s;uch as come under the rules and direc|tions of the tenth article hereafter mentioned.</P>

<PB N="377" REF="386">herein after mentioned, are not repealed, we will not, directly or indirectly, export any merchandize or commodity what&s;oever to Great Britain, Ireland, or the We&s;t-Indies, except rice to Europe.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth,</HI> Such as are merchants, and u&s;e the Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h trade, will give orders, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to their factors, agents and corre&s;pondents, in Great Britain and Ireland, not to &s;hip any goods to them, on any pretence what&s;oever, as they cannot be received in America; and if any merchant, re&s;iding in Great Britain or Ireland, &s;hall directly or indirectly &s;hip any goods, wares or merchandize, for America, in order to break the &s;aid non-importation agreement, or in any manner contravene the &s;ame, on &s;uch unworthly con|duct being well atte&s;ted, it ought to be made public; and, on the &s;ame being &s;o done, we will not from thenceforth have any commercial connexion with &s;uch merchant.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth,</HI> That &s;uch as are owners of ve&s;&s;els will give po&s;itive orders to their captains, or ma&s;ters, not to receive on board their ve&s;&s;els any goods prohibited by the &s;aid non-importation agreement, on pain of immediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from their &s;ervice.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh,</HI> We will u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavours to im|prove the breed of Sheep and increa&s;e their number to the greate&s;t extent, and to that end, we will kill them as &s;paringly as may be, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the mo&s;t profitable kind; nor will we export any to the We&s;t-Indies or el&s;ewhere; and tho&s;e of us who are or may become over-&s;tocked with, or can conveniently &s;pare any &s;heep, will di&s;po&s;e of them to our neighbours, e&s;pecially to the poorer &s;ort, on moderate terms.</P>
<P><HI>Eight,</HI> That we will in our &s;everal &s;tations encou|rage frugality, oeconomy, and indu&s;try; and promote agriculture, arts, and the manufactures of this coun|try, e&s;pecially that of wool; and will di&s;countenance and

And on the death of any relation or friend, none of us, or any of our families, will go into any further mourn|ing dre&s;s, than a black crape or ribbon on the arm or hat for gentlemen, and a black ribbon or necklace for ladies, and we will di&s;continue the giving of gloves and &s;carfs at funerals.</P>
<P><HI>Ninth,</HI> That &s;uch as are venders of goods or mer|chandize, will not take advantage of the &s;carcity of goods that may be occa&s;ioned by this a&s;&s;ociation, but will &s;ell the &s;ame at the rates we have been re&s;pective|ly accu&s;tomed to do, for twelve months la&s;t pa&s;t.&mdash; And if any vender of goods or merchandize, &s;hall &s;ell any &s;uch goods on higher terms, or &s;hall in any man|ner, or by any device what&s;oever, violate or depart from this agreement, no per&s;on ought, nor will any of us deal with any &s;uch per&s;on, or his, or her factor or agent, at any time thereafter, for any commodity whatever.</P>

<P><HI>Twelfth,</HI> That the committee of corre&s;pondence in the re&s;pective colonies do frequently in&s;pect the en|tries of their cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, and inform each other from time to time of the true &s;tate thereof, and of every other material circum&s;tance that may occur re|lative to this a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P><HI>Thirteenth,</HI> That all manufactures of this country be &s;old at rea&s;onable prices, &s;o that no undue advan|tage be taken of a future &s;carcity of goods.</P>
<P><HI>Fourteenth,</HI> And we do further agree and re&s;olve, that we will have no trade, commerce, dealings or intercour&s;e what&s;oever, with any colony or province in North-America, which &s;hall not accede to, or which

<P>And we do &s;olemnly bind our&s;elves and our con&s;ti|tuents, under the ties afore&s;aid, to adhere to this a&s;&s;ociation until &s;uch parts of the &s;everal acts of par|liament pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, as impo&s;e or continue duties on tea, wine, mola&s;&s;es, &s;yrups, paneles, coffee, &s;ugar, piemento, indigo, foreignpaper, gla&s;s, and painters colours, imported into America, and extend the powers of the admiralty courts be|yond their ancient limits, deprive the American &s;ub|ject of trial by jury, authori&s;e the judge's certificate to indemnify the pro&s;ecutor, from damages, that he might otherwi&s;e be liable to, from a trial by his peers, require oppre&s;&s;ive &s;ecurity from a claimant of &s;hips or goods &s;eized, before he &s;hall be allowed to defend his property, are repealed &mdash; And until that part of the act of the 12.

<P>In their addre&s;s to the people of Great Britain, they in&s;i&s;t upon their right of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and affirm that no power on earth has a right to take away their property without their con&s;ent; and they claim all the rights &s;ecured to &s;ubjects by the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution, e&s;pecially that invaluable one of trial by jury.
<PB N="382" REF="391">They con&s;ider it e&s;&s;ential to Engli&s;h liberty that no man be condemned unheard, or puni&s;hed for &s;uppo&s;ed offences, without having an opportunity of making his defence. They give it as their opinion that the le|gi&s;lature of Great Britain is not authori&s;ed by the con&s;titution to e&s;tabli&s;h a religion fraught with &s;an|guary and impious tenets, or to erect an arbitrary form of government in any quarter of the globe. They con&s;ider the proprietors of the &s;oil in America as much ma&s;ters of their own property, as tho&s;e of Great Britain are, and affirm that they are not bound to &s;ub|mit to any parliament not of their own election. They in&s;i&s;t that the intervention of the &s;ea which di|vides America from Britain, can make no di&s;parity in rights; nor can the di&s;tance of three thou&s;and miles from the royal palace, make the rights of &s;ubjects le&s;s than the di&s;tance of three hundred miles. Rea&s;on, they declare, looks with indignation on &s;uch di&s;tinc|tions, and free &s;ubjects can never perceive their pro|priety. They expre&s;s their amazement at the preten|&s;ions of the Briti&s;h parliament to bind them in all ea&s;es what&s;oever without exception, without their con&s;ent, and to take and u&s;e their property when, and in what manner they plea&s;e: and to make the coloni&s;ts pen&s;ioners on their bounty, and that they can hold it no longer than they vouch&s;afe to permit. Such declarations they con&s;ider as here&s;ies in Engli&s;h politics, which can no more operate to deprive them of their property, than the interdicts of the Pope can dive&s;t kings of their &s;ceptres, which the laws of the land, and the voice of the people, have placed in their hands.</P>
<P>They attribute the plan for en&s;laving them to that mini&s;ter and his a&s;&s;ociates, who made the late inglori|ous peace, and declare that ever &s;ince that time that

<PB N="383" REF="393">&s;cheme of oppre&s;&s;ion has been pertinaciou&s;ly carrying into execution. In this addre&s;s they next appeal to the mother country, how patiently they have &s;uffered the re&s;traint upon their trade in every way that could con|duce to the emolument of Britain. Say they, you have exerci&s;ed unbounded authority over the &s;ea; you have named the ports and nations to which alone our merchandize &s;hould be carried, and with whom alone we &s;hould trade; and though &s;ome of the&s;e re|&s;trictions were grievous, we neverthele&s;s did not com|plain; we looked up to you as our parent &s;tate, to which we were bound by the &s;tronge&s;t ties, and were happy in being in&s;trumental to your pro&s;perity and grandeur. They warmly call upon the inhabitants of Britain to bear witne&s;s to their loyalty, and attach|ment to the common intere&s;ts of the whole empire, and appeal to them if they did not, in the la&s;t war, add all the &s;trength of the American continent to the force which repelled the common enemy. Did we not, &s;ay they, leave our native &s;hores, and meet di&s;|ea&s;e and death to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in foreign climates? And did not you thank us for our zeal, and even reimbur&s;e us large &s;ums of money, which you confe&s;&s;ed we had advanced beyond our proportion, and far beyond our abilities? To what cau&s;es then, are we to attribute this &s;udden change of treatment, and that &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery which was prepared for us at the re&s;toration of the peace?</P>
<P>They add, before we had recovered from the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es which ever attend war, an attempt was made to drain our country of money by the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;tamp act. Painted gla&s;s, and other commodities, which you would not permit us to purcha&s;e of other nations, were taxed: Nay, though no wine is made in any country &s;ubject to the Briti&s;h &s;tate, you prohibited us
<PB N="384" REF="394">from procuring it of foreigners, without paying a tax impo&s;ed by your parliament on all we imported. The&s;e, &s;ay they, and many other impo&s;itions, were laid upon us unju&s;tly and uncon&s;titutionally, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue. In order to &s;ilence complaint, it was indeed provided that this revenue &s;hould be expended in America for its pro|tection and defence. But, &s;ay they, the&s;e exactions, however, can receive no ju&s;tification from a pretended nece&s;&s;ity of defending us. They are lavi&s;hly &s;quander|ed, on court favourites and mini&s;terial dependents, generally avowed enemies to America, and employing them&s;elves by partial repre&s;entations, to traduce and embroil the colonies. For the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of government here, &s;ay the coloni&s;ts, we ever were, and ever &s;hall be ready to provide. And whenever the exigencies of the &s;tate may require it, we &s;hall, as we have hitherto done, chearfully contribute our full proportion of men and money. To in&s;orce this un|con&s;titutional and unju&s;t &s;cheme of taxation, every fence that the wi&s;dom of our Briti&s;h ance&s;tors had carefully made again&s;t arbitrary power, has been violently thrown down in America, and the ine&s;timable right of trial by jury taken away, in ca&s;es that touch both life and property. It has been ordained that whenever offences &s;hould be committed in the colonies again&s;t particular acts, impo&s;ing various duties and re&s;trictions upon trade, the pro&s;ecutor might bring his action for the penalties in the court of the admi|ralty; by which means the &s;ubject lo&s;t the advantage of being tried by an hone&s;t and uninfluenced jury of the vicinage, and was &s;ubject to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of being judged by a creature of the crown, and according to the cour&s;e of law which exempts the pro&s;ecutor from the trouble of proving his accu&s;ation, and obliges the
<PB N="385" REF="395">defendant either to evince his innocence or &s;uffer. To give this new judicatory the greater importance, and as if with a de&s;ign to protect fal&s;e accu&s;ers, it is further provided that the judge's certificate of their having been probable cau&s;es of &s;eizure and pro&s;ecu|tion, &s;hall protect the pro&s;ecutor from actions at com|mon law, for recovery of damages.</P>
<P>In this addre&s;s it is al&s;o repre&s;ented, that although ju&s;tice is impartially admini&s;tered in all the colonies, yet by the con&s;truction of &s;ome, and the direction of other acts of parliament, offenders are to be taken by force, together with all &s;uch per&s;ons as may be point|ed out as witne&s;&s;es, and carried to England there to be tried in a di&s;tant land by a jury of &s;trangers, and &s;ubject to all the di&s;advantages that re&s;ult from want of friends, want of witne&s;&s;es, and want of money. The coloni&s;ts in this addre&s;s do not forget to take notice of the tea act, with a de&s;ign to rai&s;e a revenue in America; and it mu&s;t be allowed they repre&s;ent this affair both warmly and judiciou&s;ly. They ob&s;erve, that when the de&s;ign of rai&s;ing a revenue from the duties upon tea, imported into America, was in a great mea&s;ure rendered abortive by their cea&s;ing to import that commodity, a &s;cheme was concerted by the mini&s;try with the Ea&s;t-India company, and an act pa&s;&s;ed en|abling and encouraging them to tran&s;port and vend their tea in the colonies. Aware of the danger of giving &s;ucce&s;s to this in&s;iduous manoeuvre, and of per|mitting a precedent of taxation thus to be e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, &s;ay they, various methods were tried to elude the &s;troke. The people of Bo&s;ton, then ruled by a governour, whom, as well as his predece&s;&s;or, Sir Francis Bernards, all America con&s;iders as her enemy, were extremely embara&s;&s;ed. The &s;hips which had arrived with the tea were, by his management,
<PB N="386" REF="396">prevented from returning. The duties would have been paid; the cargoes landed and expo&s;ed to &s;ale; a governour's influence would have procured and protected many purcha&s;ers. While the town was &s;u&s;pended by deliberations on this &s;ubject, the tea was de&s;troyed. But &s;uppo&s;ing, &s;ay the coloni&s;ts, a tre&s;pa&s;s was committed, and the proprietors of the tea entitled to damages; the courts of law were open, and judges appointed by the crown pre&s;ided in them. The Ea&s;t-India company, however, did not think pro|per to commence any &s;uits, nor did they even demand &s;atisfaction either from individuals, or from the com|munity in general. The mini&s;try officiou&s;ly made the ca&s;e their own, and the great council of the nation de&s;cended to intermeddle with private pro|perty. Divers papers, letters, and other unauthenti|cated ex parte evidence, were laid before them; nei|ther the per&s;ons who de&s;troyed the tea, nor the peo|ple of Bo&s;ton, were called upon to an&s;wer the com|plaints. The mini&s;try being incen&s;ed in being di&s;ap|pointed in a favourite &s;cheme, were determined to re|cur from the little arts of fine&s;&s;e, to open force, and unmanly violence. The port of Bo&s;ton was blocked up by a fleet, and an army placed in the town. Their trade was to be &s;u&s;pended, and thou&s;ands reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of gaining &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from charity, till they &s;hould &s;ubmit to pa&s;s under the yoke, and con&s;ent to become &s;laves, by confe&s;&s;ing the omnipotence of parliament, and acquie&s;cing in whatever di&s;po&s;ition they might think proper to make of their own lives and properties.</P>
<P>Having repre&s;ented this &s;tate of facts, they then warmly exclaim, Let ju&s;tice and humanity cea&s;e to be the boa&s;t of your nation! Con&s;ult your hi&s;tory, exa|mine your records of former tran&s;actions; nay, turn
<PB N="387" REF="397">the annals of the many arbitrary &s;tates and kingdoms that &s;urround you, and &s;hew us a &s;ingle in&s;tance of men being condemned to &s;uffer for imputed crimes, unheard, unque&s;tioned, and without even the &s;pecious formality of a trial; and too, by a law made expre&s;sly for the purpo&s;e, and had no exi&s;tence at the time that the fact was committed. If it be difficult to recon|cile the&s;e proceedings to the genius and temper of your laws and con&s;titution, the ta&s;k will become more arduous when we call upon our mini&s;terial enemies, to ju&s;tify condemning men untried, and by hear-&s;ay, but involving the innocent in one common puni&s;hment with the guilty, and for the act of thirty or forty, to bring poverty, di&s;tre&s;s, and calamity on thirty thou&s;and &s;ouls, and tho&s;e not your enemies, but your friends, brethren, and fellow citizens. They make u&s;e of &s;everal other arguments and topies, which they urge home with all the force of language and warm zeal, and the impartial world in &s;ome ages hence, when the mi&s;t of prejudice is removed from their eyes, will be obliged to confe&s;s that there is much rea&s;on in what they &s;ay. What has greatly darkened this contro|ver&s;y between Great Britain and the colonies, is the difference of political rea&s;oning on different &s;ides of the que&s;tion. The advocates for the dominion of parliament, draw their arguments from my&s;tical &s;ub|tleties, grounded upon ob&s;elete laws that were never con&s;titutional, and which few, unle&s;s men learned in the law, can under&s;tand. From the&s;e they draw po&s;i|tive conclu&s;ions, as if their fir&s;t principles were &s;elf|evident, and conclude that nothing except ob&s;tincy, or real want of under&s;tanding, can hinder all others from perceiving the ju&s;tne&s;s of their arguments. The colonies and their friends e&s;tabli&s;h their arguments upon common &s;en&s;e; and the con&s;titu|tional
<PB N="388" REF="398">laws of the empire, which, as they are plain and &s;elf-evident, are calculated to affect all minds that are not warped by prejudice, or bia&s;&s;ed by private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>There is no que&s;tion but men's prejudices and in|tere&s;ts are concerned on both &s;ides, but the extreme appears to be more on the one &s;ide than the other, provided we confine our views to the evidence upon the face of the arguments. The rights of mankind are not my&s;teries to be lodged in the hands of a few, as articles of faith are, in &s;ome countries, but like the common &s;alvation, are expo&s;ed to the view of every individual per&s;on, and the privilege of all to know, as well as to enjoy. When doctrines of &s;tate are &s;o deep, as to be beyond the reach of men of common under&s;tanding, they are not fit to be put in practice. What&s;oever men are bound to obey ought fir&s;t to be made a plain object of their under&s;tanding, otherwi&s;e obedience is not a rea&s;onable &s;ervice. All hone&s;t men will ever de&s;ire to have tho&s;e de&s;igns they pro|fe&s;s to be for the good of &s;ociety, made as manife&s;t to the members thereof as po&s;&s;ible, and will never want to impo&s;e their authority, except under the di|vine light of rea&s;on and truth.</P>
<P>But it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a view of the man|agement at home, which gave ri&s;e to this &s;pirited and violent oppo&s;ition of the colonies. This will natu|rally lead us to take a view of the arguments made u&s;e of by the parties at home in &s;upport of the different &s;ides of the que&s;tion in which they were engaged. It has often been affirmed by people at home, that the coloni&s;ts deduced their arguments from &s;peeches made in the parliament of Britain, and from writings &s;ent from this country to America. Upon this &s;up|po&s;ition, the patriots, as they are called in deri&s;ion,
<PB N="389" REF="399">are principally blamed for the oppo&s;ition and re|&s;i&s;tance which the coloni&s;ts have made. But &s;uch as con&s;ider their petitions, re&s;olves, and apologies impar|tially, will &s;oon perceive that they needed no a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from the mother country, in any matter of argu|ment. There is a clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion in their writings, united with a warm zeal for truth and liber|ty, that is not to be met with in any of the&s;e venal performances which have been publi&s;hed again&s;t them. In &s;ome future period of time, when men read this controver&s;y with calm impartiality, they will give judgment freely on the &s;ide of the coloni&s;ts, and &s;tand in amazement that there &s;hould have been the &s;malle&s;t di&s;pute in a ca&s;e &s;o clear and obvious.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of parties were this year much the &s;ame as before, except that the general &s;trength of the op|po&s;ition was much declined. The Rockingham party continued unbroken, and con&s;i&s;tently pur&s;ued its fir&s;t original line of public conduct. Though it was often overpowered by numbers, it notwith&s;tanding continued formidable, and gave &s;ome &s;evere checks to the pre|vailing influence of the court. The &s;ame difference of opinion and affections, and the &s;ame occa&s;ional union among others, took place between them and that party which was attached to the Earl of Chatham. This appearance of the want of true union, very much enfeebled the oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>While matters were in this &s;ituation at home, an in|cident took place which kindled into a violent flame of di&s;content and rage in the colonies. The in&s;igni|ficant duty of threepence the pound on tea, which had been &s;ingly left behind in the year 1770, when all other articles enumerated in the &s;ame bill, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, had been repealed, was now determined to be made the fatal bane of conten|tion
<PB N="390" REF="400">between the mother country and her colonies. It had been foretold by tho&s;e who &s;truggled hard for the repeal of the whole, and who always declared a|gain&s;t every notion of an internal taxation of America; that the leaving of one duty, and the di&s;charging of the others, could an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than the le&s;&s;ening of that &s;canty revenue, which was &s;carcely &s;ufficient, in its whole amount, to an&s;wer the expence of the collection; that by this means, in&s;tead of profit, a new charge to &s;upply the deficiency, would be thrown upon the &s;tate at home, while all the other evils, which were then acknowledged as the motives of a partial repeal, would be continued in their utmo&s;t extent.</P>
<P>The&s;e political predictions in the end proved to have a real foundation, and were but too well verified by after events. The di&s;contents of the colonies encrea&s;ed from the mea&s;ures of government, and an univer&s;al &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to the tea act prevailed among them all. The mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try, and the prevailing party in parliament, &s;o irritated the coloni&s;ts, that they formed the a&s;&s;ociation which has been already mentioned, and pa&s;&s;ed the &s;pirited re&s;o|lutions which have been taken notice of, to &s;hew the mini&s;try that they were not ready to comply with &s;uch unrea&s;onable demands. In this &s;tate of affairs there was one thing which greatly encrea&s;ed the divi&s;ion be|tween the mother country and the coloni&s;ts; the go|vernours of mo&s;t of the colonies and the people, were in a continual &s;tate of warfare; and &s;uch was the op|po&s;ition between them, that what the one propo&s;ed the others were always determined to contradict. It has been generally believed that this evil had its ri&s;e at home in the mother country, and that the governours had their in&s;tructions how to behave from the mini&s;try, which they &s;ervilely executed, without con|&s;idering
<PB N="391" REF="401">either the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the commands, or the temper of the coloni&s;ts. It is, however, mani|fe&s;t, and &s;ad experience has proved, that the gover|nours have not under&s;tood, or they have willfully per|perverted the &s;tate of the colonies in their accounts thereof to the mini&s;try; for it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that government would have proceeded &s;o far as they have done, provided they had not received fal&s;e informa|tion from their &s;ervants. The variances between the governours and the people put an end all regular proceedings; the a&s;&s;emblies were repeatedly called, and &s;uddenly di&s;&s;olved. When they were &s;itting they were employed in repeating grievances, and framing remon&s;trances, and in the mid&s;t of their di&s;putes new matters &s;prung up, be&s;ides the duty on tea and the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, which encrea&s;ed the general di&s;con|tent. A mea&s;ure which had been lately adopted of rendering the governours and judges dependent on the crown, by having their &s;alaries paid by govern|ment, and to be removed at the plea&s;ure of the &s;ov|ereign, gave the colonies great offence. They con|&s;idered this mea&s;ure as an attempt of the crown to render all offices of government &s;ub&s;ervient to arbitra|ry purpo&s;es, that they might employ them at their plea&s;ure to &s;uppre&s;s the liberties of the people. Whether this was the de&s;ign of government or not, it was certainly the opinion of the coloni&s;ts concern|ing this mea&s;ure. In an ordinary cour&s;e of affairs it would probably have been overlooked, but in &s;uch a violent colli&s;ion of parties it was the mean of kindling a mo&s;t violent flame of oppo&s;ition and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>It is not to be expected in &s;uch a &s;tate of agitation, when the laws were in a great mea&s;ure &s;u&s;pended, and men left to pur&s;ue the dictates of their pa&s;&s;ions and re&s;entment, that every thing would proceed in an
<PB N="392" REF="402">orderly cour&s;e, con&s;i&s;tent with right rea&s;on and true ju&s;tice. The Ga&s;pee, an armed &s;chooner, had been &s;ta|tioned at Rhode-I&s;land to prevent &s;muggling, for which that place had been remarkable; the vigilance of the officer who commanded the ve&s;&s;el &s;o enraged the peo|ple, that they boarded her at midnight to the amount of two hundred armed men, and after wounding the commander, and forcing him and his people to go a|&s;hore, &s;et fire to the &s;chooner. This greatly incen&s;ed the government, and a reward of 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> together with a pardon if claimed by an accomplice, was offered for di&s;covering and apprehending any of the per&s;ons con|cerned in this atrocious act. But no effectual di&s;|covery was made. This daring act of &s;ome &s;mugglers was, by the courtiers, imputed to the whole colony, , though &s;ome as daring adventures have been perform|ed in the mother country, without being con&s;idered as the act and deed of a whole province. It has been ob&s;erved in this hi&s;tory, that many of the captains of ve&s;&s;els, that were &s;ent upon this office of preventing &s;muggling, were often ignorant of their duty, and ex|ceedingly arbitrary in their behaviour, which tended much to irritate the people, and to &s;tir them up to ac|tions which, in ordinary ca&s;es, were far from their thoughts. And it is probable that there was &s;ome|thing of this &s;ort that gave occa&s;ion to this outrage.</P>
<P>Before matters came to &s;uch a cri&s;is as they did afterwards, a very &s;trange and extraordinary accident happened, which revived with double force all the ill temper and animo&s;ity that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the government and the people, in the province of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay. This was a di&s;covery and publication of &s;ome confidential letters, which had been written during the cour&s;e of the unhappy di&s;putes with the mother country, by the then governour, and deputy
<PB N="393" REF="403">governour, to the mini&s;try of England. The&s;e letters contained a very unfavourable repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of affairs, the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple, and the views of the leaders in that province; and tended to &s;hew, not only the nece&s;&s;ity of the mo&s;t coercive mea&s;ures, but that even a very con&s;iderable change of the con&s;titution, and &s;y&s;tem of government was nece&s;&s;ary, to inforce the obedience of the colony. The&s;e letters had been &s;ent by Governour Hutchi&s;on privately and in confidence; but the people of the co|lony in&s;i&s;ted, that they were evidently intended to in|fluence government, and ought therefore to be &s;hown to &s;uch per&s;ons as had an intere&s;t in pre&s;erving their privileges. Upon the death of a gentleman, in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the&s;e letters happened to be lodged, they, by &s;ome means which are not yet known, fell into the hands of the agent to the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, who immediately transferred them to the a&s;&s;em|bly of that province, which was then &s;itting at Bo&s;|ton.</P>
<P>The indignation and rage which tho&s;e letters ex|cited on the one &s;ide, and the confu&s;ion on the other, neither need, nor can admit of de&s;cription. The peo|ple found them&s;elves mi&s;repre&s;ented and betrayed, by one whom they imagined bound in duty to &s;upport their intere&s;t, and perceived that the late mea&s;ures of government had proceeded from fal&s;e information, that had been given by their governour, and lieuten|ant-governour.</P>
<P>In the frenzy of rage and re&s;entment which the&s;e letters occa&s;ioned, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives pa&s;&s;ed many violent re&s;olutions. The letters were pre&s;ented to the council, under the &s;tricte&s;t injunctions from the repre&s;entatives, that the per&s;ons who were to &s;hew them, &s;hould not by any means &s;uffer them, even for
<PB N="394" REF="404">a moment, out of their own immediate hands. This affront to the governour was adopted by the council; and upon his requiring to examine the letters that were attributed to him, thereby to acknowledge them if they were genuine, or di&s;approve them if they were &s;purious, that board, under the pretence of this re|&s;triction, refu&s;ed to deliver them into his hands, but &s;ent a committee to open them before him, that he might examine the hand writing. To this indig|nity he was obliged to &s;ubmit, as well as to the mor|tification of acknowledging the &s;ignature that was affixed to them.</P>
<P>The colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay was &s;ufficiently irritated before, and needed no new feul to encrea&s;e the flame of their re&s;entment.&mdash; The&s;e letters pu&s;hed them on to mea&s;ures of the mo&s;t &s;pirited nature; the hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed a petition and remon&s;trance to his maje&s;ty, in which they charged the governour, and lieutenant-governour, with being betrayers of their tru&s;ts, and of the people they governed; of giving private, partial, and fal&s;e information; declar|ed them enemies to the colony, and prayed for ju&s;tice again&s;t them, and for their &s;peedy removal from their places. Such were the di&s;content, and &s;o weak were the powers of government in that a&s;&s;embly, that tho&s;e charges, with many others, were carried by a majori|ty of 82 to 12.</P>
<P>The time of the arrival of the &s;hips with the exe|crated tea approaching, when the new plan of taxa|tion was to have been put in execution, the people a&s;&s;embled in different parts in great bodies, and pro|ceeded to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;eemed mo&s;t effectual to prevent the landing of the cargoes. The con|&s;ignees, who had been appointed by the Ea&s;t-India company to receive the tea, were obliged in mo&s;t
<PB N="395" REF="405">places to give up their appointment, and to enter in|to public engagements not to act in that capacity. Committees were appointed by the people in different towns and provinces, whom they inve&s;ted with &s;uch powers as they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves authorized to give. They were impowered to in&s;pect the books of merchants, to propo&s;e te&s;ts, to puni&s;h tho&s;e they con|&s;idered to be contumacious, by the dangerous pre|&s;cription of declaring them enemies to their country, and to a&s;&s;emble the people when they thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Their power was, in one word, as indefinite as the authority under which they acted. The a&s;&s;em|blies which were held on the&s;e occa&s;ions, were fre|quently violent and ha&s;ty in their re&s;olutions; their pa&s;&s;ions were warm, and they did not wait long to de|liberate what they were to do. The greate&s;t part of their re&s;olutions were exceedingly derogatory to the &s;upreme legi&s;lature; government had now lo&s;t their affection, and they paid the governours no honour nor regard. This will always be the ca&s;e when rulers them&s;elves tran&s;gre&s;s the laws, by &s;ub&s;tituting power in the place of ju&s;tice, without regarding the natural and fundamental &s;tatutes of the compact between the governours, and the governed. When the people, by the tyranny and mi&s;management of governours, are driven back to a &s;tate of nature, rulers mu&s;t ex|pect that they will u&s;e their natural powers, in &s;uch a manner as be&s;t &s;uits their inclination or advantage. The &s;ame rea&s;on that makes princes keep &s;tanding armies in the time of peace, makes the people u&s;e their natural powers on particular occa&s;ions. Both are intended for the &s;upport of rights which each party lays claim to, and which they con&s;ider it ju&s;t to maintain.</P>
<PB N="396" REF="406">
<P>The coloni&s;ts were at this time greatly inflamed, as they had been for &s;ome time pa&s;t, not only by the treatment of government, but by inflamatory writings, which were publi&s;hed by &s;ome zealous per&s;ons in the oppo&s;ition. From the time that the riot happened at Rhode-I&s;land, till the pa&s;&s;ing of the Bo&s;ton Port|bill, almo&s;t all things tended to bring matters to a cri&s;is. The public news-papers were made vehicles of conveyance, to tran&s;mit to different parties the &s;entiments of tho&s;e on their &s;ide, and were frequent|ly filled with as much rancour as argument. In the peaceful colony of Philadelphia, long celebrated for the excellency of its police, and the temperate and pla|cid manners of its inhabitants, printed papers were di&s;per&s;ed, warning the pilots on the Delaware not to conduct any of the tea &s;hips that were expected into the harbour, which were only &s;ent out for the pur|po&s;e of en&s;laving and poi&s;oning all America; at the &s;ame time, giving them plainly to under&s;tand it was expected, that they would apply their knowledge of the river, under the colour of their profe&s;&s;ion, in &s;uch a manner as would effectually &s;ecure their country from the danger with which it was threatened. A &s;imilar publication made its appearance at New-York, wherein the tea &s;hips were repre&s;ented as loaded with fetters, forged in Britain, to bind the coloni&s;ts in &s;lavery; and vengeance was denounced again&s;t all per&s;ons who &s;hould dare, in any manner, to introduce tho&s;e chains. All the colonies &s;eemed in&s;tantly to have united in this point.</P>
<P>The town of Bo&s;ton, which had been &s;o long ob|noxious to government, was the &s;cene of the fir&s;t outrage. What rendered the people of that town more violent in oppo&s;ition to landing the tea, it was con&s;igned to a &s;on of Governour Hutchi&s;on, who&s;e
<PB N="397" REF="407">letters had mi&s;repre&s;ented them, and enraged the go|vernment again&s;t them. They perceived a monopoly formed in favour of very obnoxious per&s;ons, and with a de&s;ign of confirming a mo&s;t odious tax. When three &s;hips laden with tea arrived in that port, the ma&s;ters were frightened into a conce&s;&s;ion, that if the per&s;ons to whom the tea was con&s;igned, the board of cu&s;toms, and the Fort of Ca&s;tle William, would permit, they would return with their cargoes to England. But they could not fulfil their promi&s;e, for the con&s;ignees refu&s;ed to di&s;charge the captains from the obligations under which they were chartered for the delivery of their cargoes; the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e refu&s;ed them a clearance, and the governour to grant them a pa&s;&s;port for clearing the fort. The people of the town ea&s;ily perceived, that as the &s;hips lay &s;o near, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to hinder the tea from being landed by degrees, notwith&s;tanding any guard they could keep, or mea&s;ures they could take to prevent it; and they under&s;tood, that if once it was landed, nothing could prevent its being di&s;po&s;ed of, and there|by the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing a monopoly, and rai&s;ing a revenue would be accompli&s;hed. To prevent this con&s;equence, which the people con&s;idered as the mo&s;t dangerous, a number of armed men, under the di&s;|gui&s;e of Mohawk Indians, boarded the &s;hips, and in a &s;hort time, di&s;charged their cargoes of tea into the &s;ea, without doing any other damage, or offering any injury to the captains or their crews. It appears &s;omewhat &s;trange, that the government, civil and mili|tary, the Fort of Ca&s;tle William, and armed &s;hips in the harbour, were totally inactive on this occa&s;ion. Some &s;maller quantities of tea were thrown into the &s;ea at Bo&s;ton and Carolina; but in general the com|mi&s;&s;ioners for the &s;ale of that commodity, were o|bliged
<PB N="398" REF="408">to give up their employment, and none dur&s;t to receive the cargoes that were con&s;igned to them. The ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, from the&s;e circum&s;tances, as well from the knowledge of their danger, and the de|termined re&s;olution of the people, readily complied with the terms that were pre&s;cribed, of return|ing to England, without entangling them&s;elves with any entry at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;es. There was &s;ome tea landed at New-York, under the cannon of a man of war; but the government were obliged to con&s;ent to its being locked up from u&s;e, and the con|&s;ignees dur&s;t not expo&s;e it to &s;ale. Such was the i&s;&s;ue of this tea &s;cheme, which was fooli&s;h in its con|trivance, and un&s;ucce&s;sful in its execution; a &s;cheme which no wi&s;e man would have begun, and no good man would have cho&s;en to execute. Ages to come will look upon the hi&s;tory of this tran&s;action in the light of fable, and will &s;carcely be able to believe, that in an age renowned for knowledge in arts and policy, &s;uch in&s;tances of folly and madne&s;s could have exi&s;ted. The de&s;troying of this tea, was undoubtedly an unwarrantable act of outrage, for which the actors are much to be blamed, and de&s;erved to have been puni&s;hed; but it is &s;carcely chargeable with as much folly, as the act which appointed the tea to be &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, and the other parts of America. It is plain that it could neither bring a revenue to the govern|ment, nor ready money to the proprietors; and &s;eems only to have been &s;ent to provoke the outrage which happened, that government might have &s;ome plau&s;ible rea&s;on of falling out with the colonies, and for &s;end|ing an armed force to curb the &s;pirit of liberty which prevailed among them. In times of corruption, when bad men are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, it almo&s;t always happens that a &s;pirit of freedom is an eye-&s;ore to
<PB N="399" REF="409">rulers, which they interpret into the &s;ignification of faction, and in proce&s;s of time, work up into the form of rebellion, that they may have &s;ome handle to pro|ceed again&s;t it, and if po&s;&s;ible, to cru&s;h what they &s;o heartily abhor. But in the hi&s;tory of nations it does not once appear that ever the &s;pirit of liberty, attend|ed with virtue, was &s;ubdued or overcome. Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s will always end in ruin, and will never fail to bring nations to de&s;truction; but while righteou&s;ne&s;s prevails, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to ruin them, for there|by they will be exalted. It would be of &s;ervice to politicians to con&s;ider attentively the progre&s;s of &s;o|ciety, and the means by which empires have ri&s;en and fallen; it would help them to form their &s;chemes with more di&s;cretion, and prevent them falling into danger|ous extremes.</P>
<P>When the parliament a&s;&s;embled upon the 13th of January, it was expected that &s;ome notice would have been taken of the di&s;turbances in America, but con|cerning that &s;ubject there was a perfect &s;ilence. No|thing was done in parliament with regard to Ameri|can affairs till the 7th of March, when di&s;patches ar|rived with an account of de&s;troying the tea at Bo&s;ton. This information arrived a few days after the que&s;tion on the Grenville bill was carried. The mini&s;ter be|ing defeated in that que&s;tion felt his &s;pirits in a &s;tate of agitation, which were far from being &s;oothed by the news from Bo&s;ton. This di&s;agreeable intelligence occa&s;ioned a me&s;&s;age from the throne to both hou&s;es of parliament, wherein appeared the greate&s;t anxiety, and the warme&s;t zeal. This me&s;&s;age &s;et forth, that unwarrantable practices were carried on in North-America, and that violent proceedings had lately been pur&s;ued at the town and port of Bo&s;ton, with a view of ob&s;tructing the commerce of this kingdom, upon
<PB N="400" REF="410">grounds and pretences immediately &s;ubver&s;ive of its con&s;titution. It was al&s;o &s;ignified that his maje&s;ty con|&s;ided in his parliament for the &s;upport of his author|ity, and tru&s;ted in their attachment to the common intere&s;t and welfare of his dominions, and that they would not only enable him effectually to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be mo&s;t likely to put an immediate &s;top to the&s;e di&s;orders, but al&s;o take into their con|&s;ideration what further regulations, and permanent provi&s;ions, &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the better &s;ecuring the executions of the laws, and the ju&s;t dependence of the colonies upon the crown and parliament of Great Britain.</P>
<P>This me&s;&s;age was attended with a great number of papers relating to the tran&s;actions in the colonies, containing copies of extracts from the &s;everal gover|nours; the commander in chief of the forces; from the admiral in Bo&s;ton harbour; from the per&s;ons to whom the tea had been con&s;igned; to one of the ring-leaders of the faction in Bo&s;ton, with the votes and re&s;olves of the town previous to the landing of the tea, and narratives of the tran&s;actions which fol|lowed that event; a petition from the con&s;ignees to the council of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, praying that their per&s;ons and property might be taken under the pro|tection of government, with the refu&s;al of the coun|cil to interfere in any manner of bu&s;ine&s;s: a proclam|ation i&s;&s;ued by the governour to forbid factious a&s;&s;em|blies of the meetings of the inhabitants; and the tran&s;|actions of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's council, condemning the mea&s;ures of de&s;troying the tea, and advi&s;ing legal pro|&s;ecutions again&s;t the perpetrators, none of whom were known, nor were there any po&s;&s;ibility of their di&s;covery. The&s;e papers al&s;o contained details from the different governours, of all the tran&s;actions rela|tive
<PB N="401" REF="411">to the tea, which took place in their re&s;pective governments, from the fir&s;t intelligence of their being &s;hipped in England, to the date of their letters; as al&s;o the threatenings, and prophetical informations, which had been often &s;ent to the gentlemen to whom the tea was con&s;igned; copies of printed papers, in|flammatory hand bills, alarms, illegal proceedings of committees, and extraordinary minutes of council, had all been tran&s;ported acro&s;s the Atlantic, to the government in England, and were now laid before the parliament. In the&s;e papers the uniformity of &s;tile, language and &s;entiment, fully di&s;covered that the coloni&s;ts were generally of the &s;ame opinion, and that not only the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, but all America were offended at the proceedings of the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>When the&s;e papers were laid before the hou&s;e, they were aggravated by mini&s;terial comments, which &s;et them forth in the mo&s;t attrocious and criminal point of view, particularly tho&s;e which related to the tran&s;actions of Bo&s;ton. In the&s;e the conduct of the governour was repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t favourable and &s;hining point of light; to which was contra&s;ted, the vicious, factious, and rebellious behaviour and di&s;po&s;ition of the colonies. In behalf of the gover|nour it was &s;aid, that he had taken every mea&s;ure which prudence could &s;ugge&s;t, or good policy ju&s;tify, for the &s;ecurity of the property of the Ea&s;t-India com|pany, the &s;afety of the con&s;ignees, and the pre&s;erving of order and quiet in the town. Every civil precau|tion, to prevent the mi&s;chiefs that followed had been u&s;ed in vain. His maje&s;ty's council, the militia, and the corps of cadets, had all been &s;eperately applied to for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the pre&s;ervation of the pub|lic peace, and the &s;upport of the laws, but all without effect; they refu&s;ed or declined doing their duty. The
<PB N="402" REF="412">&s;heriff read a declaration to the faction of that town, at their town meeting, by which they were command|ed to break up their illegal a&s;&s;embly; but the procla|mation was treated with the greate&s;t contempt, and the &s;heriff in&s;ulted in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t manner.</P>
<P>That he had it undoubtedly in his power, by calling in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the naval force which was in the harbour, to have prevented the de&s;truction of the tea; but as the leading men in Bo&s;ton had always made great complaints of the interruption of the army and navy, and charged all di&s;turbances of every &s;ort to their account, he, with great prudence and temper|ance, determined from the beginning to decline a mea&s;ure which would be &s;o irritating to the minds of the people; and might well have hoped, from this confidence in their conduct, and tru&s;t repo&s;ed in the civil power, that he &s;hould have calmed their turbu|lence and pre&s;erved the public tranquility. Thus, &s;aid the mini&s;try, the people of Bo&s;ton were fairly tried. They were left to their own conduct, and the exerci&s;e of their own judgment, and the re&s;ult has given the lie to all their former profe&s;&s;ions. They are now, &s;ay they, without an excu&s;e; and all the powers of government in that province, are found in|&s;ufficient to prevent the mo&s;t violent outrages. The loyal and peaceable people of a mercantile town, as they affect to be peculiarly con&s;idered, have given a notable proof to the world of their ju&s;tice, modera|tion, loyalty, and affection for the mother country, by wantonly committing to the waves a valuable com|modity, the property of another loyal mercantile body of &s;ubjects; without the pretence of nece&s;&s;ity, even &s;uppo&s;ing that their oppo&s;ition to the payment of the duties, could ju&s;tify &s;uch a plea; as they had nothing to do but to adhere to their own re&s;olution of non|con&s;umption
<PB N="403" REF="413">effectually to evade the revenue laws. It was concluded upon the whole, that by an impartial view of the papers now before them, it would mani|fe&s;tly appear, that nothing could be done by either civil, military, or naval officers, to effectuate the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of tranquility and order in that province, without addition of parliamentary powers, to give efficacy to their proceedings. That no per&s;on em|ployed by government could, in any act, however com|mon or legal, fulfil the duties of his office or &s;tation, without being exclaimed again&s;t by the licentious, as an infringement of their liberties. That it was the &s;ettled opinion of &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t men both in England and America, and tho&s;e the be&s;t acquainted with the affairs of the colonies, that in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of government, no mea&s;ures what&s;oever could be pur&s;ued, that could, in any degree, remedy tho&s;e glaring evils which is every day growing to a more enormous and dangerous height. That parliament, and parliament only, was capable of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing tranquility among tho&s;e turbulent people, and of bringing order out of confu&s;ion. And that it was therefore incumbent on every member to weigh and con&s;ider with an attention &s;uitable to the importance of the &s;ubject, the purport of the papers before them, and totally lay all prejudices a&s;ide, to form his opinion upon the mea&s;ures mo&s;t eligible to be pur&s;ued, for &s;upporting the &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority of parlia|ment, and the great intere&s;ts of the Briti&s;h empire. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of what was urged by the mini|&s;try, when they pre&s;ented the papers. The grand object which the mini&s;try had in view, and which they coloured with the name of the &s;upremacy of parlia|ment, was the &s;upremacy and dominion of them&s;elves, which they wanted to e&s;tabli&s;h on the authority of parliament. They could not help knowing, that if the
<PB N="404" REF="414">coloni&s;ts were &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h empire, that they were to be governed by the fundamental &s;tatutes of the con&s;titution; and that no new forms of govern|ment, or modes of taxation, could be admitted in any part of the Briti&s;h empire, contrary to the fun|damental laws, without di&s;&s;olving the ancient frame of government, and bringing the people again to a &s;tate of nature. The &s;upremacy of the parlia|ment of Britain could only <HI>legally</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onably</HI> ex|tend as far as tho&s;e places where its members repre|&s;ented, or to objects that had been &s;ettled by agree|ment to be referred to their juri&s;diction. To pro|ceed farther was to e&s;tabli&s;h in parliament a de&s;poti&s;m over one part of the empire, which is not permitted in other parts, which few people will think rea&s;onable when applied to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The party in parliament which had &s;trong pre&s;um|tions that the di&s;orders in the colonies proceeded as much from the mi&s;management of government, as from the turbulent temper of the colonies, propo&s;ed an examination of the mea&s;ures that had been pur&s;ued for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and that the conduct of the &s;everal governours, and the orders that had been &s;ent to them from the mini&s;try, &s;hould be examined. This was a very fair and rea&s;onable propo&s;al, which hone&s;t men could not decently refu&s;e. But the mini&s;try &s;trongly oppo&s;ed all retro&s;pect views of their pa&s;t con|duct, alledging that it only tended to inflame the minds of the people, and would exa&s;perate them more again&s;t government. The bu&s;ine&s;s they &s;aid was ur|gent and important, and required a &s;peedy di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and that in the enquiry, &s;ome great and important points would come under their con&s;ideration. Par|ticularly, is America any longer to be dependent on this country? How far is it to be connected? In what degree? It might be a great que&s;tion, Whether
<PB N="405" REF="415">the colonies &s;hould not be given up? But if this que&s;tion is decided in the negative, then it would be nece&s;&s;ary to examine in what manner their &s;ubordi|nation &s;hould be pre&s;erved, and the authority of this country inforced? The&s;e points required the mo&s;t &s;erious inve&s;tigation, in which the retro&s;pect recom|mended would be unnece&s;&s;ary, and perhaps danger|ous, as encouraging tho&s;e whom it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of parliament, by every means, to reduce to obedi|ence. This method of rea&s;oning was &s;ophi&s;tical and delu&s;ory; for it &s;ugge&s;ted that there were no other methods of conciliating the affections of the colonies, and &s;ecuring their dependence on the mother country, except tho&s;e that were calculated to &s;upport the dominion of the mini&s;try, and &s;ecure them and their friends in the places and pen&s;ions. In&s;tead of any of tho&s;e que&s;tions which have been mentioned, it might perhaps have been much better for the honour and dignity of the nation, and the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, never to have called their authority in que&s;tion, but to have proceeded to rever&s;e the laws complained of, and to rectify tho&s;e fal&s;e &s;teps of government which had occa&s;ioned the pre&s;ent di&s;contents. It has almo&s;t been the ca&s;e in all ages, with all empires and govern|ments, that have as yet exi&s;ted, that their power and authority were never called in que&s;tion, till they began to &s;tretch them beyond their ju&s;t bounds; and then by making new &s;tatutes to inforce the power, they &s;ugge&s;t|ed rea&s;ons of doubt whether they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any &s;uch authority. It is highly probable, that had the mini&s;try pur&s;ued the advice given them by the minority, and made &s;uch a reformation as the nature of the &s;ubject required, that we &s;hould not have heard of the independency of America for a century to come.</P>
<P>Many plau&s;ible, but &s;elfi&s;h arguments, were u&s;ed by
<PB N="406" REF="416">the mini&s;try to incen&s;e the nation again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, but the &s;tronge&s;t, and which had mo&s;t effect, was, that our trade to America would cea&s;e to exi&s;t, if the flag|rant outrage at Bo&s;ton &s;hould pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. By &s;trong repre&s;entations of this evil, the people began to be inflamed again&s;t the coloni&s;ts, and in the time of this artificial fermentation, the mini&s;try pu&s;hed on their &s;chemes of coercion and violence with the great|e&s;t rapidity. They knew the minority would not choo&s;e to re&s;i&s;t in expre&s;s terms, what was &s;o po&s;itively affirm|ed to be for the advantage of the nation, or if they did, they would &s;oon lo&s;e all their popularity; they therefore made the be&s;t of this opportunity to carry their points in the hou&s;e of commons. By carrying the vote of addre&s;s to the king, giving him thanks for the communication of the papers that had been laid before the hou&s;e, the mini&s;try gained a great advan|tage; for they found by the di&s;po&s;ition of the hou&s;e, which was &s;trongly again&s;t taking any retro&s;pect view of things pa&s;t, that they would confine them&s;elves to the mere behaviour of the Americans. The violence of the coloni&s;ts was manife&s;t and indi&s;putable, and while no other rea&s;ons were produced except what appeared in the face of their actions, it was the mo&s;t likely thing in the world, that any propo&s;ition again&s;t them would be carried. It was fortunate for the mini|&s;try that no part of the weakne&s;s and di&s;orderly &s;tate of &s;o many governments, was laid before the hou&s;e, for in this ca&s;e they were likely to get clear of &s;everal years mi&s;management, which would have been a clog to all their motions, and mu&s;t certainly have i&s;&s;ued in their di&s;grace.</P>
<P>It appeared manife&s;t that the &s;torm that was gathering again&s;t the colonies, would fall fir&s;t upon that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay. This made the agent for that colony pre&s;ent a petition to the hou&s;e, by way
<PB N="407" REF="417">of precaution, de&s;iring that he might be permitted to lay before them the <HI>acta regia</HI> of Queen Elizabeth, and her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for the &s;ecurity of the planters and their de&s;cendants, and the perpetual enjoyment of their liberties. The&s;e proofs he alledged had never been laid before the hou&s;e, nor had the colonies ever had an opportunity to a&s;certain and defend them. This petition was received without much oppo&s;ition, and ordered to ly upon the table.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter, after having moved that the king's me&s;&s;age of the 7th of March &s;hould be read, opened his plan for the re&s;toring of peace, order, ju&s;tice and commerce, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay. He &s;tated that the oppo&s;ition to the authority of parlia|ment had always originated in that colony; and that that colony had been always in&s;tigated by the irregular and &s;editious proceedings of the town of Bo&s;ton. That, therefore, for the purpo&s;e of a thorough refor|mation, it became nece&s;&s;ary to begin with that town, which, by a late unparalleled outrage, had led the way to the de&s;truction of commerce in all parts of America. That if a &s;evere and exemplary puni&s;hment was not inflicted on this heinous act, Great-Britain would be wanting in the protection &s;he owed to her mo&s;t peaceful and meritorious &s;ubjects. That, had &s;uch an in&s;ult been offered to Briti&s;h property in a foreign port, the nation would have been called upon to demand &s;atisfaction. He would therefore propo&s;e that the town of Bo&s;ton &s;hould be obliged to pay for the tea which had been de&s;troyed in their port. That the injury was indeed done by per&s;ons unknown and in di&s;gui&s;e, but that the town magi&s;tracy had taken no notice of it, had never made any &s;earch for the offenders, and therefore, by a manife&s;t neglect of a known duty, became accomplices in the guilt. That
<PB N="408" REF="418">the fining of communities for their neglect of puni&s;hing offences committed within their limits, was ju&s;tified by &s;everal examples. The&s;e examples were one in the ca&s;e of London, one in the ca&s;e of Edinburgh, and ano|ther in the ca&s;e of Gla&s;gow, with regard to Dr Lamb, Captain Porteus, and Mr Campbell. The&s;e examples were &s;aid to be &s;trong, and in point for &s;uch puni&s;h|ments. It was not a &s;ingle act of violence. It was a &s;eries of &s;editious practices of every kind, and carried on for &s;everal years. He was of opinion, therefore, that it would not be &s;ufficient to puni&s;h the town of Bo&s;ton, by obliging her to make a pecuniary &s;atisfac|tion for the injury, which, by not endeavouring to pre|vent and puni&s;h, &s;he had in fact encouraged; &s;ecurity mu&s;t be given in future, that trade may be &s;afely carried on, properly protected, laws obeyed, and duties re|gularly paid; otherwi&s;e the puni&s;hment of a &s;ingle il|legal act is no reformation. It would, he &s;aid, be pro|per to take away from Bo&s;ton the privilege of a port, until his maje&s;ty &s;hould be &s;atisfied in the&s;e particu|lars, and publicly declare in council, on a proper cer|tificate of the good behaviour of the town, that he was &s;atisfied. Until this &s;hould happen, the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e officers, which were not now &s;afe in Bo&s;ton, or &s;afe no longer than when they neglected their duty, &s;hould be removed to Salem where they might exer|ci&s;e their functions. By this Bo&s;ton would certainly &s;uffer. But &s;he ought to &s;uffer; and by this re&s;olution would &s;uffer le&s;s puni&s;hment than her delinquents fully ju&s;tified. For &s;he was not wholly &s;ecluded from all &s;upply. She was, by this propo&s;ition, only to be virtually removed &s;eventeen miles from the &s;ea. The duration of her puni&s;hment was entirely in her own power. For when &s;he &s;hould di&s;charge this debt to the Ea&s;t-India company, which had been con|tracted
<PB N="409" REF="419">by her own violence, and had given full a&s;&s;ur|ances of obedience in future to the laws of trade and revenue; there was no doubt but that his maje&s;ty, to whom he propo&s;ed to leave that power, would again open the port, and exerci&s;e that mercy which was a|greeable to his di&s;po&s;ition. He &s;trongly recommend|ed unanimity, and &s;aid that this was a cri&s;is that de|manded vigour. He was by no means an enemy to lenient mea&s;ures. Re&s;olutions of warning and cen&s;ure will avail nothing; now is the time to &s;tand out and defy them; to defy them with firmne&s;s and without fear. A conviction mu&s;t be produced to America that we are in earne&s;t, and will proceed with firmne&s;s and vigour. This conviction would be lo&s;t if they found us doubting and he&s;itating. Some friends to Briti&s;h authority may &s;uffer a little, but if with this temporary inconveniency we compare the lo&s;s of the country, and its due obedience, it will bear no com|pari&s;on. It is &s;aid the Americans will not pay their debts; this they threatened before the repeal of the &s;tamp act. The act was repealed. What was the con&s;equence. They did not pay. This threatening, if attended to, mu&s;t di&s;able parliament equally in all her operations. This act will not require a military power to inforce it; four or five frigates will be &s;uf|ficient. But if they &s;hould not be &s;ufficient, he would not &s;cruple to u&s;e a military force, which might act with effect, and without blood&s;hed. The other colonies will not take fire at the proper puni&s;hment inflicted on tho&s;e who have di&s;obeyed the laws. They will leave them to &s;uffer their own puni&s;hments. If they do combine with them, the con&s;equence of their rebellion belong not to us, but to them. We are only an&s;werable that our mea&s;ures be ju&s;t and equitable. Let us proceed, &s;ays he, with firmne&s;s, ju&s;tice, and re&s;olution; which
<PB N="410" REF="420">cour&s;e, if pur&s;ued, will certainly produce that due obedience to the laws of this country, and &s;ecurity of the trade of this people, which I &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;h for. The&s;e are the arguments of the mini&s;ter which he u&s;ed to &s;upport his motion for bringing in the Bo&s;ton Port-bill; and accordingly, leave was given for bringing it in.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of this a motion was made for an amendment, for the purpo&s;e of laying a fine on the town of Bo&s;ton, equivalent to the damage &s;u&s;tained by the Ea&s;t-India company. If they refu&s;ed to pay this fine, that the other penalties mentioned in the bill, might be inflicted. This ammendment was re|jected, and this bill pregnant with &s;o many important con&s;equences, was pu&s;hed on with &s;o much vigour and di&s;patch, that it did not remain long in the hou&s;e. It is &s;omewhat &s;urprizing that a law &s;o full of direful con&s;equences, &s;hould have been received with &s;o much applau&s;e and approbation, as this did at the fir&s;t. Without enquiring into the rea&s;on of the behaviour of the people of Bo&s;ton, they were condemned un|heard, and disfranchi&s;ed without ever having their cau&s;e brought before tho&s;e who pretended to be their judges. The equity of obliging a delinquent and re|fractory colony to make &s;atisfaction for the di&s;orders which were &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en from their factious temper, and negligent police, was taken for granted to be a nece&s;&s;ary exertion of the powers of government, and many things exceptionable in the act were, on that account, overlooked. But when the&s;e proceed|ings of parliament are accurately con&s;idered, and the &s;peech of the mini&s;ter &s;eriou&s;ly analized, they will ap|pear to be pregnant with baleful influence to every &s;pecies of liberty. The &s;peech of the mini&s;ter declares, that he took for granted what neither the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution
<PB N="411" REF="421">nor the coloni&s;ts admit to be true, namely, that the parliament of Britain have a right to impo&s;e taxes, where the people have no repre&s;entation; and that re&s;i&s;tance to foreign laws is worthy of &s;evere puni&s;hment.&mdash;That the parliament of Britain has a right to take away what it never had a right to give; namely, a right for men to enjoy the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which they had purcha&s;ed from the original proprietors of a country where Britain had no juri&s;diction. The equity and ju&s;tice which the &s;peech &s;uperficially men|tions, are only words without any meaning, unle&s;s that ju&s;tice varies with the climate, and equity changes with the longitude and latitude. For what he &s;o warmly recommends as ju&s;t and equitable in Bo&s;ton, would be accounted lawle&s;s tyranny in any part of Great Britain.</P>
<P>At this time the friends of the colonies in parlia|ment were divided; one party applauded the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures as lenient and gentle; others continued to &s;tand upon their old ground, and maintained their con&s;tant principles. In the cour&s;e of the debate in the progre&s;s of the bill, they &s;eem to have been truer prophets than the mini&s;ter; for almo&s;t all the events which they foretold have nearly come to pa&s;s, but not one word of his prophecies have been accompli&s;hed. Oppo&s;ition to this bill encrea&s;ed, during the time of the debates. Mr Bolan, agent for the council of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, pre&s;ented a petition, de&s;iring to be heard for the &s;aid council, and in behalf of him|&s;elf and others, the inhabitants in the town of Bo&s;ton. The hou&s;e refu&s;ed to hear the petition. It was &s;aid that the agent of the council was not agent for the cor|poration, and no agent could be received from a cor|porate body, except he were appointed by all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;tituent parts of that body. Be&s;ides the
<PB N="412" REF="422">council was fluctuating, and the body by which he was appointed could not be then exi&s;ting. This vote rejecting the petition was &s;everely cen&s;ured. It was certainly very incon&s;i&s;tent to receive a petition from the &s;ame per&s;on a few days before, and refu&s;e his pe|tition at this time for want of a qualification, they al|lowed him then to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. What made this rejecting of the petition appear more extraordinary was, that at that very time the hou&s;e of peers was actually hearing Mr Bolan at their bar upon his petition as a per&s;on duly qualified. The &s;ame objection might be made to all American agents, none of them were then qualified as the mini&s;ter required, and thus all communication between the parliament and the co|lonies, was then cut off; at the &s;ame time they were making laws to oppre&s;s them. It will be difficult for a benevolent citizen of the world, in &s;ome future pe|riod of time, to believe that there were &s;uch mea&s;ures carried on in a parliament of Great Britain, con&s;i&s;ting of men profe&s;&s;ing the prote&s;tant religion, and bearing the Chri&s;tian name. They will be ready to con&s;ider this part of the hi&s;tory of Britain in the light of a fable or romance, contrived by &s;ome ingenious per&s;on to amu&s;e the reader, without any intention of finding credit, or expecting to be accounted a true hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;oftening motions had been propo&s;ed and rejected, the mini&s;ter brought in another bill, to which the Bo&s;ton Port act was only a prologue; it was intituled a bill for the better regulating the government of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay. This bill was intended to alter the con&s;titution and government of this province, as it &s;tood &s;ettled by the charter of King William, and to take all &s;hare of go|vernment out of the hands of the people, and to ve&s;t the nomination of coun&s;ellors, judges and magi&s;trates
<PB N="413" REF="423">of all kinds, including &s;heriffs, in the crown, and in &s;ome ca&s;es in the king's governor, and all to be re|moveable at the plea&s;ure of the king. This was at one &s;troke undermining the ancient government of the colony, and leaving the people no &s;hare in their own government at all. The &s;upporters of this bill alledged, that the di&s;orders of the province of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ett's-Bay, not only di&s;tracted that province with|in it&s;elf, but &s;et an ill example to all the colonies. An executive power was wanting. The force of the civil power, it was &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted in the <HI>po&s;&s;e comitatus;</HI> but the <HI>po&s;&s;e</HI> are the very people who commit the riots. That there was a total defect in the con&s;titu|tional power throughout. If the democratical part &s;hew a contempt of the laws, how is the gover|nour to enforce them? Magi&s;trates he cannot ap|point; he cannot give an order without &s;even of the council a&s;&s;enting; and let the military be never &s;o numerous and active, they cannot move in &s;upport of the civil magi&s;tracy, when no civil magi&s;trate will call upon them for &s;upport. It is in vain, it was &s;aid, that you make laws and regulations here, when there are none found to execute them in that country. It is therefore become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to alter the whole frame of the Ma&s;&s;achufett's government, &s;o far as it relates to the executive and judicial powers. It was al&s;o affirmed, that the juries were injudiciou&s;ly cho&s;en, and that &s;ome immediate and permanent reme|dy ought to be adopted. The bill, which was at la&s;t formed into a law, will te&s;tify upon what principles it was founded. A vigorous, but ineffectual oppo&s;i|tion was made to the pa&s;&s;ing of this arbitrary law; the court had a &s;trong majority, which was fit to carry every point, and it does not appear that they would have he&s;itated at any thing what&s;oever.</P>
<PB N="414" REF="424">
<P>The minority urged, that to take away the civil con&s;titution of a whole people &s;ecured by charter, the validity of which was not &s;o much as que&s;tioned at law, upon mere loo&s;e allegations of delinquencies and defects, was a proceeding of a mo&s;t arbitrary and dangerous nature. They &s;aid that it was wor&s;e than the proceedings again&s;t the Americans and Engli&s;h corporations, in the reign of King Charles and King James the &s;econd, which were, however, accounted the wor&s;t acts of tho&s;e arbitrary reigns. At that time the charge was regularly made; the colonies and cor|porations called to an&s;wer; time was given, and the rules of ju&s;tice, at lea&s;t in appearance, were ob&s;erved. But here, they &s;aid, there was nothing of the kind, not &s;o much as a pretence to the colour of ju&s;tice; not one evidence had been examined at the bar, a thing done on the mo&s;t trifling regulation, affecting and franchi&s;e of the &s;ubject. That the pretence of taking away the charter, in order to give &s;trength to government, would never an&s;wer; for this was fir&s;t doing evil, that good might follow. They a&s;ked the mini&s;try, Whether the colonies, which are already regulated nearly upon the plan propo&s;ed, were more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to our right of taxation, than that of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ett's-Bay? If not, what would be gained by the bill, that can be &s;o very material to the authority of parliament, as to ri&s;k all the credit of parliamentary ju&s;tice, by &s;o &s;trong and irregular a proceeding? That the part of the act which affected juries, was made without &s;o much as a &s;ingle complaint of abu&s;e pretended. They proceeded further, and affirmed, that the ca&s;e of the late Captain Pre&s;ton, Mr Otis, and many others, &s;hewed with what ju&s;tice the juries in that colony acted. They denied that the juries were improperly cho&s;en; that they were appointed by a
<PB N="415" REF="425">better method than ours, by a &s;ort of ballot in which no partiality could take place. But by the new regu|lation the &s;heriff is appointed, without any qualifica|tion, by the governour, and to hold his office at his plea&s;ure. This was a power, they &s;aid, given to the governour, greater than that given by the con&s;titution to the crown it&s;elf. This they in&s;i&s;ted was a great abu&s;e, in&s;tead of reformation; and tended to put the lives and properties of the people ab&s;olutely into the hands of the governours. It was further urged, that the di&s;order lay much deeper than the forms of go|vernment. That the people throughout the colonies were univer&s;ally di&s;atisfied, and that their unea&s;ine&s;s and re&s;i&s;tence was no le&s;s in the royal governments than in others. That the remedy could only be in the removal of the cau&s;e of the di&s;temper, and in quieting the minds of the people. That the act had a direct tendency to the contrary; and they feared, that in&s;tead of giving &s;trength to government, it would de&s;troy the &s;mall remains of Engli&s;h authority which was left in the colonies</P>
<P>Mr Bolan the agent of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's council, made another effort in behalf of his province, and at|tempted to petition for time to receive an an&s;wer from the province, to the account he had &s;ent of the proceed|ing again&s;t them. But the hou&s;e refu&s;ed to receive the petition by a large majority. The &s;ame natives of America, who petitioned again&s;t the Bo&s;ton Port-bill, again renewed their endeavours, by a petition again&s;t this. This petition was written with great &s;pirit, and in a very warm &s;tile, and compo&s;ed with much judg|ment, it &s;et forth the apprehen&s;ions of the petitioners, what would be the effects of this bill in the place where it was intended to operate, and was a true progno&s;ti|cation
<PB N="416" REF="426">of what has &s;ince come to pa&s;s. It had leave to lie upon the table, but was no more taken notice of. The bill at la&s;t was pa&s;&s;ed by a very great majori|ty, after a very &s;pirited and long debate. The debates in the hou&s;e of Lords were equally warm, and upon the &s;ame principles, and in the end i&s;&s;ued in the &s;ame manner. When this bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, the mini&s;ter proceeded to give the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the liberties of America. It was moved for leave to bring in a bill for the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in ca&s;es of per&s;ons que&s;tioned for any acts done by them in the execution of the laws, or for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of riots or tumults in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay in New England. This bill provides, that in ca&s;e that any per&s;on is indicted for murder, or any other capital of|fence, and that it &s;hall appear to the governour, that the fact was committed in the exerci&s;e or aid of magi&s;tra|cy in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing tumults and riots; and it &s;hall further appear to the governour, that a fair trial cannot be had in the province, he &s;hall &s;end the per&s;on &s;o indicted, &amp;c. to another colony, or to Great Britain to be tried. The charges on both &s;ides to be paid out of the cu&s;|toms. This act was to continue for four years.</P>
<P>The arguments u&s;ed to inforce this bill were, that magi&s;tracy mu&s;t be inforced by all po&s;&s;ible means; for as the&s;e orders would probably be re&s;i&s;ted by force, it would lay them under a nece&s;&s;ity to u&s;e force in the executing of them. In this ca&s;e blood would be probably &s;pilled. Who would ri&s;k this event, though in the execution of his duty, if the rioters them&s;elves, or their abettors, were to &s;it as judges. The mini&s;ter alledged, that &s;uch an act was not without precedent at home. Where &s;muggling was known to be notori|ou&s;ly countenanced in one county, the trial of offences of that kind had been directed to be in another. The
<PB N="417" REF="427">rebels of Scotland, in the year 1746, were tried in England. All particular privileges gave way to the public &s;afety; when that is endangered, even the Habeas Corpus act, the great paladium of Engli&s;h liberty has been &s;u&s;pended. That the act propo&s;ed did not e&s;tabli&s;h a military government, but a civil one, by which the former was greatly improved. It gave to the province a council, magi&s;trates, and ju&s;tices, when in effect they had none before. This bill was warmly oppo&s;ed, and all the&s;e rea&s;ons fully refuted; but a dead majority carried all before them.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible not to ob&s;erve the weakne&s;s, as well as the ab&s;urdity of the mini&s;terial arguments, u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, as well as the futility of the precedents brought to confirm them. There had been recent in&s;tances of the impartiality of juries in the colonies in the ca&s;e of Captain Pre&s;ton and others, when ver|dicts had been given according to ju&s;tice, according to the mini&s;ters own ideas of that matter, and there could be no rea&s;on of fearing ju&s;tice would not be ex|ecuted, unle&s;s he was de&s;igned to promote &s;ome con|conduct which would give rea&s;on for &s;etting a&s;ide its u&s;ual cour&s;e. His &s;peech &s;ugge&s;ted that he intended that &s;omething would be done, which he would call ju&s;tice, and which the coloni&s;ts would have rea&s;on to account unju&s;t, and would be obliged in con&s;cience to treat it as it de&s;erved. He was therefore providing again&s;t a con&s;equence he fore&s;aw would happen, becau&s;e he was determined it &s;hould happen. In this the old maxim was confirmed, "That the children of this world are wi&s;er than the children of light." But there was no rea&s;on for making provi&s;ion again&s;t an evil that never would have happened, unle&s;s the mini&s;ter him&s;elf had been the author of it. He appears to have been de|termined that blood &s;hould be &s;hed, and &s;peaks of it
<PB N="418" REF="428">with great coolne&s;s and indifference; and what bears the mo&s;t unfavourable interpretation, he wanted to have tho&s;e he intended &s;hould &s;hed it, &s;creened from ju&s;tice if he po&s;&s;ibly could.</P>
<P>The precedents which he mentions, are mo&s;t un|favourable for his argument; for it is only &s;upporting one act of inju&s;tice by another. For though many in a county may countenance &s;muggling, yet it does not prove that all the county are &s;mugglers, and that an hone&s;t jury cannot be found in &s;ome counties in Eng|land. No man would &s;uppo&s;e this unle&s;s he were a proficient in the practice of deceit him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of the Scotch rebels is &s;till more unfavour|able; for the ca&s;e of the colonies, and that of the Jacobites are quite different. The colonies were ac|knowledging the &s;overeignty of the king, and petition|ing mo&s;t humbly for a redre&s;s of grievances; they wanted not to have the government changed, nor the revolution &s;et a&s;ide, but to have the old laws continu|ed, and their ancient con&s;titution &s;ecured again&s;t modern inva&s;ions of parliament. They were willing to continue in allegiance to the king, and de&s;ired no more than that protection which other &s;ubjects of the empire enjoyed; they claimed, and they prayed for no more than what all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects claim as their ju&s;t and legal right to po&s;&s;e&s;s. But this was not the ca&s;e of the Jacobites; their greate&s;t grievance was the revolution it&s;elf, and their greate&s;t eye-&s;ore the Brun&s;|wick family that &s;upported it. They did not come to the throne with petitions, but attacked it with the &s;word in their hands; they aimed at the de&s;truction of the &s;overeign, and intended to change the con&s;titu|tion. The&s;e Jacobite tribes mo&s;t voluntarily, and without any new oppre&s;&s;ion, or any new rea&s;ons of rebellion, but what will always be the &s;ame to them,
<PB N="419" REF="429">drew the &s;word again&s;t the King and the laws, and &s;ought the life of his Maje&s;ty King George, to place a popi&s;h Pretender upon the throne of the&s;e king|doms. But the coloni&s;ts were praying and be&s;eech|ing both king and parliament to &s;upport the common liberties of the empire, which had been ratified by the revolution &s;ettlement, and confirmed by all the &s;overeigns &s;ince that time. The oppo&s;ition which the Americans made to new &s;tatutes is &s;upported by the con&s;titution it&s;elf, and without new laws &s;etting a|&s;ide the old ones, they could not be made rebels.&mdash; The violence of the mini&s;try drove them to re&s;i&s;tance, which was determined rebellion, to give &s;anction to the force that was intended to be u&s;ed to make them &s;ub|mit to the new mea&s;ures of government. In the&s;e re&s;pects the ca&s;e of the colonies and the Jacobites were very different, and no arguments drawn from the one to the other can po&s;&s;ibly be of any force. The pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of intere&s;ted per&s;ons may lead them to pervert the cleare&s;t rea&s;on; but all di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate and di&s;intere&s;ted men, who are under the government of right rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, will judge in another manner, and determine according to truth. Had the mini&s;ter &s;poken the real &s;entiments of his mind, he would have declared that he wanted to have a military government in the colonies to in|force obedience to all the arbitrary mea&s;ures that had been pur&s;ued; for his words could imply nothing le&s;s than that he intended to rule by the &s;word, and therefore wanted to have his agents &s;ecured again&s;t law and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The la&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable tran&s;action of this year was, the Quebec bill, which was called a bill for making more effectual provi&s;ion for the govern|ment of the province of Quebec in North America.&mdash; This bill came down from the Hou&s;e of Lords to the
<PB N="420" REF="430">Commons for their approbation, where it met with &s;trong oppo&s;ition, and underwent &s;everal amendments. The mini&s;try expected that as the bill pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Lords &s;o ea&s;ily, that it would have met with no oppo&s;ition from the Commons; but in this they were mi&s;taken. What embarra&s;&s;ed the mini&s;ter mo&s;t in this particular ca&s;e was, that the bill made a great noi&s;e without doors, and was altogether unpopular in its nature. It had an article concerning religion in it, which appeared to have a tendency to inflame the nation; and provided there had been as much zeal for the prote&s;tant religion, as in former times, the mi|ni&s;ter dur&s;t not have proceeded &s;o fa&s;t with his favourite bill, nor would it have at all pa&s;&s;ed. This bill took up a good deal of time, and met with a very warm oppo&s;i|tion. Many witne&s;&s;es were examined to give as much colour as po&s;&s;ible to the fairne&s;s of the proceeding.&mdash;Among the&s;e were General Carleton, Governor of Canada; Mr Hay, Chief Ju&s;tice of that province; Mr Mazeres, Cur&s;itor Baron of the Exchequer, late Attorney General there, and Agent to the Engli&s;h inhabitants of Canada; Doctor Marriot, the King's Advocate General in England; Mon&s;. Lolbiniere, a French gentleman of con&s;iderable property in Cana|da. The principal objects of this bill were to a&s;cer|tain the limits of that province, which were extend|ed far beyond what had been &s;ettled as &s;uch, by the king's proclamation of 1763.&mdash;To form a legi&s;lative council for all the affairs of that province, except taxation, which council &s;hould be appointed by the crown, the office to be held during plea&s;ure; and his Maje&s;ty's Roman Catholic &s;ubjects were entitled to a place in it. To e&s;tabli&s;h the French laws, and a tri|al without jury, in civil ca&s;es, and the Engli&s;h laws with a trial by jury, in criminal ones. To &s;ecure to
<PB N="421" REF="431">the Roman Catholic clergy, except regulars, the legal enjoyment of their e&s;tates, and of their tythes, from all that are of their own religion. The&s;e were the Chief objects of this act.</P>
<P>The arguments which were u&s;ed for the &s;upport of this bill were,&mdash;that the French who were a very great majority of the inhabitants of that country, hav|ing been u&s;ed to live under an ab&s;olute government, were not anxious for the forms of a free one, which they little under&s;tood, or valued. That they even abhorrred the idea of a popular repre&s;entation, ob|&s;erving the mi&s;chiefs which it introduced in their neighbouring countries. Be&s;ides, it would be unrea|&s;onable to have a repre&s;entative body out of which all the natives &s;hould be excluded; and perphaps it would be dangerous to tru&s;t &s;uch an in&s;trument in the hands of a people but newly taken into the Briti&s;h empire. They were not yet ripe, it was &s;aid, for Engli&s;h go|vernment. That their landed property had been all granted, and their family &s;ettlements made on the ideas of French laws: that the laws concerning con|tracts and per&s;onal property were nearly the &s;ame in France as in England; that a trial by jury was &s;trange and di&s;gu&s;ting to them That with regard to religion it had been &s;tipulated to allow them perfect freedom in that re&s;pect by the treaty of Paris, as far as the laws of England permitted. The penal laws of Eng|land with re&s;pect to religion, they &s;aid, did not extend beyond the kingdom; and though the king's &s;upre|macy extended farther, a provi&s;ion was made in the act to oblige the Canadians to be &s;ubject to it; and an oath pre&s;cribed as a te&s;t again&s;t &s;uch papal claims as might endanger the allegiance of the &s;ubjects. That it was again&s;t all equity to per&s;ecute tho&s;e people for their religion, and that people have not the privileges of re|ligon
<PB N="422" REF="432">who have not their own prie&s;thood. And as for the payment ef tythes, it was at be&s;t only &s;etting down their clergy, where they were found at the conque&s;t. In one re&s;pect, it was &s;aid, they were wor&s;e, as no per&s;on profe&s;&s;ing the prote&s;tant religion was to be &s;ubject to them, which would be a great encouragement to conver&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is great rea&s;on to conclude, that none of the&s;e were the true rea&s;ons for preferring the bill; but the main rea&s;on, though not what is now called the o&s;ten|&s;ible one was, to bring over the French coloni&s;ts to the de&s;igns of the mini&s;try, and to per&s;uade them, by pretended favours, to fall upon the back &s;ettlements of the Engli&s;h colonies. The mini&s;ter &s;eems to have been totally ignorant of the di&s;po&s;ition of the French Catholics in Canada; for we do not find that ever the&s;e papi&s;ts have been &s;o dutiful as to thank govern|ment for the new favours that were granted them;&mdash; and it has appeared &s;ince that they were not de&s;iring any &s;uch change. A few tools of government were per&s;uaded to &s;end a petition to parliament for the French laws, but it was far from the minds of the ge|nerality to &s;olicit any &s;uch favour. With regard to the promi&s;e made in the king's declaration, it extend|ed no farther than a free toleration; whereas the bill gives a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment to popery in Canada, and pledges the faith of king and parliament for the &s;up|port of the popi&s;h religion. The religion of popery in that part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions is e&s;tabli&s;hed up|on the &s;ame footing as that of the Church of England, upon papi&s;ts acknowledging the king's &s;upremacy, as appointed by the fir&s;t of Queen Elizabeth. Whereas the prote&s;tants have no other &s;ecurity than the plea&s;ure of the king, nor any right to demand any thing, except what he &s;hall plea&s;e to grant them. By this law the
<PB N="423" REF="433">papi&s;ts are &s;ecured in all their religious privileges, and provided for by an act of the Briti&s;h parliament, with a legal &s;ecurity for a maintenance for their clergy. The only favour which is &s;hewn to prote&s;|tants is that they are freed from paying tythes, which the mini&s;ter thought would be a powerful means of conver&s;ion, to bring over papi&s;ts to the prote&s;tant re|ligion; but though this may appear to be a very &s;trong incentive to a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, or others who pay little regard to any religion, yet to &s;uch as have any principles of con&s;cience, &s;ome &s;tronger means of conver&s;ion are nece&s;&s;ary. It appears from the mini|&s;terial arguments that the mini&s;ter wanted only &s;uch converts from popery as were &s;wayed by the motives of worldly rewards, which are tho&s;e mo&s;t prevalent with many in his &s;tation. The giving the Canadian coloni&s;ts the trial by jury in criminal cau&s;es, and the French method of trial in civil cau&s;es has a very whim|&s;ical appearance; for certainly a man would chu&s;e to tru&s;t his property where he would chu&s;e to tru&s;t his life. And it is certainly nece&s;&s;ary, that people have as good a chance for &s;ecuring their property as they po&s;&s;ibly can. But although government intend|ed to grant a favour to the papi&s;ts; this was no rea|&s;on why the prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of the empire &s;hould be &s;tripped of their rights to oblige Roman papi&s;ts; the prote&s;tants in Canada ought to have had the en|joyment of what the law &s;ecures to Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, whatever the government might be plea&s;ed to grant to papi&s;ts. But by this law they have deprived the prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of Britain of their ju&s;t natural rights, &s;ecured to them by the con&s;titution, upon the faith of enjoying which, they &s;ettled in that part of the world. The pa&s;&s;ing of this bill whereby &s;uch favor was &s;hewn to the church of Rome, created more &s;u&s;|picion
<PB N="424" REF="434">on account of the legi&s;lature refu&s;ing a petition which had been pre&s;ented &s;ome time before by the prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters for relief from &s;ome penal laws that were &s;tanding again&s;t them. It was concluded that government &s;hewed this favour to the Catholics, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that they were &s;uitable in&s;truments to promote their arbitrary de&s;igns, and that they wanted to di&s;courage the di&s;&s;enters, becau&s;e they were friends to liberty, and foes to all &s;orts of tyran|ny and de&s;poti&s;m. Whatever were the motives which determined the legi&s;lature to pa&s;s this law, it is manife&s;t that it is an infraction of the con&s;titution, by e&s;tabli&s;hing popery in the Briti&s;h empire, which the revolution &s;ettlement guarded again&s;t. It is a &s;pecial part of the pre&s;ent infelicity of the&s;e nations at pre&s;ent, that there are a number of modern &s;tatutes that cla&s;h with ancient and con&s;titutional laws, where|by men in defending the one may be puni&s;hed for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the others. It is not in the power of the far greater part of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to know and under&s;tand the large body of laws that are contained in the &s;tatutes, and through ignorance are ready to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the &s;anctions of &s;ome &s;tanding law of the land; e&s;pecially as it has been for &s;o many ages an e&s;tabli&s;hed idea, that all the &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h empire have the &s;ame privileges of the laws, and may all be their own legi&s;lators, when they be|came freeholders of the empire. But though it was formerly thought that the &s;ubjects of the colonies were freemen, like others at home, yet it has been de|termined that coloni&s;t and freeman have different &s;ig|nifications; and that there can be no legal freedom out of Great Britain. For this is the import of the rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject of colonization in the pre|&s;ent times.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> A View of the Proceedings at Home&mdash;Tran&s;actions in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;etts Bay&mdash;Rhode I&s;land&mdash;New Hamp&s;hire&mdash;The Affair at Lexington and Concord&mdash;The Battle of Bunker's Hill, and its con&s;equences, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed directly to the tran&s;actions of this year, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to take a view of &s;ome proceedings of the year 1774, which &s;eem immediately connected with the important tran&s;ac|tions of this. After General Gage arrived at Bo&s;|ton, and had, after &s;ome altercations on both &s;ides, di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly, the committee of corre&s;pon|dence at Bo&s;ton entered into an agreement, which they entitled a &s;olemn league and covenant, wherein the &s;ub&s;cribers bound them&s;elves in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, and in the pre&s;ence of God, to &s;u&s;pend all commercial intercour&s;e with Great Britain, from the la&s;t day of the en&s;uing month of Augu&s;t, until the Bo&s;ton port bill, and the other obnoxious laws were repealed, and the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;ets bay fully re&s;tored to all its chartered rights and privileges.&mdash;They al&s;o bound them&s;elves in the &s;ame manner, not to con&s;ume, or purcha&s;e from any other, any goods what&s;oever which arrived after the &s;pecified time, and to break off all commerce, trade, and dealings, with any who trade with the importers of &s;uch goods, as well as with the importers them&s;elves. They al&s;o re|nounced in the &s;ame manner, all future intercour&s;e and connection with tho&s;e who &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;ub|&s;cribe to that covenant, or to bind them&s;elves by &s;ome
<PB N="426" REF="436">&s;imilar agreement with the dangers the penalty an|nexed, of having their names publi&s;hed to the world.</P>
<P>This covenant, accompanied with a letter from the committee at Bo&s;ton, was circulated with great in|du&s;try and activity, and the people not only in the New England provinces but in the other provinces, entered into this new league with the greate&s;t keenne&s;s.&mdash;What was &s;ome|what remarkable is, that &s;imilar agreements had been entered into about the &s;ame time, in various parts of the continent, and without any previous con|cert with one another, any more than with tho&s;e at Bo&s;ton. The title of a &s;olemn league and covenant greatly alarmed General Gage, and the friends of the mini&s;try in all parts of the Briti&s;h dominions; its name, as well as its tendency, was ominous and frightful. It brought to the remembrance of his Ma|je&s;ty's Governor's and mini&s;ters the times of England and Scotland, entering into a &s;olemn league and co|venant for the defence of their legal rights and privi|leges, which have always been remembered by men of arbitrary principles with horror and di&s;gu&s;t. The cau&s;es and the effects were by &s;ome con&s;idered at this time to be pretty much &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the time of the long parliament; and it was no great wonder that General Gage was alarmed at the tidings of a new &s;olemn league and covenant. His proclamation on the 29th of June &s;hews how much he was agitat|ed and alarmed. He &s;tiles it an unlawful, ho&s;tile, and tracterious combination, contrary to the allegi|ance due to the king, de&s;tructive of the lawful au|thority of the Briti&s;h parliament, and of the peace, good order, and &s;afety of the community. All per|&s;ons, were warned again&s;t incurring the penalties due to &s;uch aggravated and dangerous offences; and all magi&s;trates charged to apprehend and &s;ecure for trial
<PB N="427" REF="437">&s;uch as &s;hould have any &s;hare in the publi&s;hing, &s;ub|&s;cribing, aiding, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting the foregoing, or any &s;imi|lar covenant.</P>
<P>This proclamation produced no other effect than to exerci&s;e the judgment and pens of tho&s;e who had knowledge of the laws, in &s;hewing that the a&s;&s;ocia|tion did not come within any of the laws that re|&s;pected trea&s;on, and that the charges made by the Governor were erroneous, unju&s;t, and injurious.&mdash; They &s;aid he had a&s;&s;umed a power which the con&s;ti|tution denied even to the &s;overeign, the power of making tho&s;e things to be trea&s;on, which were not con&s;idered to be &s;uch by the laws; that the people had a right to a&s;&s;emble to con&s;ider of their common grievances, and to form a&s;&s;ociations for their general conduct towards the remedy of tho&s;e grievances; and that the proclamation was equally arbitrary, odious, and illegal. Had the Governor con&s;idered the hi&s;to|ry of former times carefully, he might have ea&s;ily di&s;|covered that covenanters are not &s;o ea&s;ily frightened as to give up what they conceive to be their ju&s;t rights, for a &s;imple proclamation. The ca&s;e now be|tween the crown officers and the coloni&s;ts was much like that between the ancient covenanters and the royali&s;ts, in the reign of Charles the fir&s;t. The par|tizens of Charles charged the covenanters with trea|&s;on and rebellion, and the others accu&s;ed them of ty|ranny and trea&s;on, again&s;t the con&s;titution. Neither party could convince the other by arguments, they at la&s;t appealed to Heaven, and tried to determine their cau&s;e by the length of the &s;word; the determination was fatal to many thou&s;ands, and to Charles him&s;elf, and ought to be a warning to all future magi&s;trates not to provoke a people too far. Mini&s;ters and court favourites ought to con&s;ider, that among their friends
<PB N="428" REF="438">there are few that are &s;uch from principle, and pro|vided that it &s;hould happen to be their intere&s;t to turn again&s;t them, they will &s;oon de&s;ert them, and join with their enemies; whereas tho&s;e that are again&s;t them, for the mo&s;t part, have both <HI>principle</HI> and <HI>inte|re&s;t,</HI> in oppo&s;ing them, and are determined by the &s;tronge&s;t motives. But before we proceed to con&s;i|der the tran&s;actions at home, which relate to the American affairs of this year, we &s;hall take a view of the behavaour of the coloni&s;ts, and what pa&s;t in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>The determination of the general congre&s;s had now confirmed the principles of the timid and cautious, and their fears being removed, they laid a&s;ide that moderation which before they affected to ob&s;erve. The re&s;olves of the congre&s;s became now the creed of the colonies in matters of politics, and a perfect compliance with their determinations was every where ob&s;erved, The unanimity through the whole conti|nent was amazing; the &s;ame language was ob&s;erved by town and provincial meetings, by general a&s;&s;em|blies, by judges in their charges, and by grand juries in their pre&s;entments; and all their acts tended to the &s;ame point. It was &s;urpri&s;ing and wonderful to &s;ee the inhabitants of rich commercial countries, who had acquired a long and e&s;tabli&s;hed reli&s;h for the &s;uperfluities of life, and who it might have been &s;up|po&s;ed, would have acquired irre&s;i&s;table habits in u&s;ing them, all on a &s;udden throwing a&s;ide the captivating allurements, and confining them&s;elves to what was merely nece&s;&s;ary. To ob&s;erve the merchant forego the advantages of trade and commerce, the farmer &s;ubmit to the lo&s;s of the &s;ale of the produce of his in|du&s;try, and the &s;eaman, with the numberle&s;s other per&s;ons dependent upon trade, contentedly re&s;ign the
<PB N="429" REF="439">very means of their livelihood, and tru&s;t to the pre|carious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, from the public &s;pirit and charity of the opulent, was an uncommon phenomenon; and what is perhaps more amazing, that the rich &s;hould have been di&s;po&s;ed to run the hazard of lo&s;ing their all, and &s;upplying the poor for an uncertain expecta|tion of obtaining what probability &s;eemed to deter|mine again&s;t. Such however was the view that Ame|rica at that time, &s;ince, and at pre&s;ent, exhibited to the world.</P>
<P>They had &s;ent a petition from the continental con|gre&s;s to the throne, upon which they placed &s;ome hopes of a reconciliation with the mother country.&mdash; It was imagined that a general application to the people of England would have produced a &s;alutary effect, and the coloni&s;ts had &s;till a greater dependance upon the unanimity of the determinations of the Con|gre&s;s, in influencing the public opinions at home in the mother country. The&s;e hopes however did not pre|vail &s;o far with them, as to put them off their guard, or to make them abate of their zeal in pur&s;uing &s;uch mea&s;ures as were nece&s;&s;ary to provide again&s;t the wor&s;t that might happen. The principal leaders did not depend much upon the&s;e expectations, which &s;ome placed in the &s;ucce&s;s of their petition to the throne. The &s;outhern colonies began to arm, as tho&s;e in the north, and to train and arm their militia, and as &s;oon as advice was received of the proclama|tion i&s;&s;ued in England to prevent the exportation of arms and ammunition to America, mea&s;ures were &s;peedily taken to provide a remedy for that defect. For this purpo&s;e, and to render them&s;elves as inde|pendent as po&s;&s;ible upon foreigners for the &s;upply of the&s;e e&s;&s;ential articles, mills were erected, and manu|factures formed, both in Philadelphia and Virginia,
<PB N="430" REF="440">for the making of gunpowder, and encouragement given in all the colonies, for the fabricating of arms of every &s;ort. Great and many difficulties attended the&s;e fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays; and the &s;upply of powder, both from home manufacture, and importation, was for a long time &s;carce and precarious. But &s;uch was their re&s;olution and zeal, that they ardently per&s;i&s;ted in their undertakings, and &s;ucce&s;s attended their endea|vours.</P>
<P>Governor Gage i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t the provincial congre&s;s of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;ets Bay, but it did not produce the &s;malle&s;t effect in the proceedings of the congre&s;s, nor in the conduct of the people, who paid an implicit obedience to its determinations. It is highly probable that the mea&s;ures of this provin|cial a&s;&s;embly were managed by advice of the general congre&s;s, which was &s;itting at the &s;ame time, with whom they held a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence. The critical &s;ituation of Bo&s;ton, the capital of the pro|vince, was an object of much con&s;ideration, nor was it ea&s;y to determine in what manner to provide for the &s;afety of the inhabitants, and to prevent the town becoming a thorn of unea&s;ine&s;s to the province, if matters &s;hould come to the la&s;t extremity. From its natural advantages of &s;ituation, and the works thrown up on the neck, Bo&s;ton was already become a &s;trong hold, and was capable with little difficulty by the protection of a fleck to be made almo&s;t impregnable again&s;t any force. It was al&s;o at the plea&s;ure of the governor capable of being made a &s;ecure pri&s;on for the inhabitants, who would thereby become ho&s;tages for the province at large. Several different propo|&s;als were made to prevent or remedy the&s;e evils.&mdash; One was only to remove the inhabitants; another to &s;et a valuation upon the e&s;tates, to burn the town,

Force was the only expedient that could be pur&s;ued with a pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s; but they were not yet determined to proceed to that extremity. They had &s;till &s;ome hopes that Britain would relax in her demands, and think better on the &s;ubject; they could hardly per|&s;uade them&s;elves that &s;he was determined upon &s;laughtering the &s;ubjects of the empire for the &s;ake of opinions merely problematical, and which could be no way available to her real intere&s;t. They con&s;i|dered the military preparations of the mother coun|try in the &s;ame light that they were con&s;idered at home, intended to fright them into a compliance with the mea&s;ures of government, but that they did not intend to proceed to ho&s;tilities. However, in the mean time, many of the principal inhabitants re|moved out of the town, under the real apprehen&s;ion of immediate violence from the troops, or of being &s;ecured and &s;ent to England, to &s;tand their trial for &s;uppo&s;ed offences.</P>
<P>The provincial congre&s;s having fini&s;hed all their bu&s;ine&s;s which they thought proper and nece&s;&s;ary at this time, di&s;&s;olved them&s;elves in the end of Novem|ber, having fir&s;t appointed another meeting in the en|&s;uing month of February. During this rece&s;s, the friends of government began to be&s;tir them&s;elves, and to &s;hew their de&s;igns in &s;ome few places. They wanted to try their &s;trength and their numbers, and to make a &s;tand again&s;t the general current. Some a&s;&s;ociations were formed for mutual defence, and in &s;ome few towns a refu&s;al was made to the orders of the congre&s;s; but the oppo&s;ite tem|per was &s;o prevalent, that tho&s;e attempts were &s;oon
<PB N="432" REF="443">quelled. The di&s;&s;idents were overpowered by num|bers, and all their attempts came to nothing.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;picion which the mother country had of the colonies, promoted the grounds of their &s;u&s;picions; for by prohibiting the exportation of military &s;tores, &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of re&s;i&s;tance, or at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;omething would be done by government, that would tend to provoke the coloni&s;ts to make u&s;e of &s;uch &s;tores. When the account of this prohibi|tion was received at Rhode I&s;land, the people &s;eized and carried away all the ordnance belonging to the crown in that province, which lay upon &s;ome batte|ries that defended one of the harbours, and which amounted to above forty pieces of cannon, of differ|ent fizes. When a captain of a man of war waited upon the governour to enquire into the meaning of this procedure, he was informed with great frank|ne&s;s, that the people had &s;eized the cannon to pre|vent their falling into the hands of the king's forces, and that they intended to make u&s;e of them to de|fend them&s;elves, again&s;t any power that &s;hould at|tempt to mole&s;t them. The a&s;&s;embly of that i&s;land al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olutions for the procuring of arms and military &s;tores, by all means, and from all quarters from whence they could be obtained, as well as for training and arming the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The province of New-Hamp&s;hire, which had hi|therto appeared to be of a placid and moderate tem|per, and had behaved with more re&s;pect to govern|ment, than the other provinces of New England, as &s;oon as they heard of the re&s;olutions of Rhode-I&s;land, and received a copy of the royal proclamation that gave ri&s;e to them; pur&s;ued the &s;ame plan. A body of men a&s;&s;embled in arms, and marched to the attack of a &s;mall fort called William and Mary, only
<PB N="433" REF="444">con&s;iderable for being the object of the fir&s;t military operation in that province.&mdash;This fort was ea&s;ily taken, and &s;upplied them with a quantity of powder, by which they were enabled to put them&s;elves in a &s;tate of defence. No other acts of ho&s;tility or violence happened during the winter, but a firm determina|tion of re&s;i&s;tance was however univer&s;ally &s;pread and encrea&s;ed every day. The arrival of the king's &s;peech and the addre&s;&s;es of the new parliament, added to the flame that was already kindled. Their former jealou&s;y, which needed no additional fuel, began now to blaze forth with all the expre&s;&s;ions of concern and anxiety, attended with the &s;igns of determined re&s;o|lution to re&s;i&s;t every act of violence that govern|ment &s;hould attempt to commit upon them.</P>
<P>The king's &s;peech, in the opinion of the colonies, cut off all hopes of reconciliation, and made them &s;train every nerve to provide again&s;t the &s;torm they &s;aw gathering again&s;t them. It is very remarkable that all the public acts and declarations, which in England were recommended as the means of pacify|ing the colonies, by intimidating them, con&s;tantly ope|rated in a different manner. The more clearly a de|termination was &s;hewn to inforce an high authority the more re&s;olutely the coloni&s;ts &s;eemed to re&s;i&s;t it. The a&s;&s;embly of Pen&s;ylvania, which had met by ad|journment towards the clo&s;e of the year 1774, was the fir&s;t legal convention that ratified unanimou&s;ly all the acts of the general congre&s;s, and appointed delegates to repre&s;ent them in the new congre&s;s, which was to be held in the en&s;uing month of May.&mdash; The proceedings in other places were &s;imilar, and much of the &s;ame kind through all the colonies.&mdash; The convention of Maryland appointed a &s;$m of mo|ney for purcha&s;ing arms and ammunition, and the
<PB N="434" REF="445">provincial a&s;&s;embly of Philadelphia in the end of Ja|nuary pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution for the encouragement of manufacturing gunpowder.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly of New York, which met in the be|ginning of the year, differed indeed from the re&s;t of the continent. After &s;everal debates upon the que&s;tion concerning acceding to the general congre&s;s, it was rejected upon a divi&s;ion, but by a very &s;mall majority. About this time the friends of government, by in&s;tructions from Britain, formed a repre&s;entation of grievances, which they propo&s;ed to lay before the king and parliament; in this they were encouraged by the lieutenant-governor, imagining that as they had refu&s;ed to join the general congre&s;s, that their repre|&s;entation and petition would meet with acceptance; but this petition and repre&s;entation was as ineffectual as many others.</P>
<P>The new provincial congre&s;s of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay a&s;&s;embled upon the 1&s;t of February at Cambridge, and pur&s;ued the &s;ame plan that had been marked out for them by their predece&s;&s;ors. Among other re&s;olutions they publi&s;hed one to inform the people, that from the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try and par|liament, there was real cau&s;e to fear that the rea&s;on|able and ju&s;t application of that continent to Great Britain for peace, liberty, and &s;afety, would not meet with a favourable reception; but on the contrary, from the large reinforcement of troops, expected in that colony, the general appearance, and the tenor of intelligence from Great Britain, they had rea&s;on to apprehend that the &s;udden de&s;truction of that colony was intended, for refu&s;ing with the other American colonies, tamely to &s;ubmit to what they termed, the mo&s;t ignominous &s;lavery. They therefore urged in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, the militia in general, and the
<PB N="435" REF="446"><HI>minute</HI> men in particular, to &s;pare neither time, pains, nor expence, at &s;o critical a juncture, in perfecting them&s;elves in military di&s;cipline. They pa&s;&s;ed other re&s;olutions for the providing and making of fire arms and bayonets, and renewed more &s;trictly the prohibi|tion of the former congre&s;s, concerning not &s;upplying the troops at Bo&s;ton with any of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries which are peculiarly requi&s;ite for the military &s;ervice: The markets of Bo&s;ton being &s;till open for the &s;upply of provi&s;ions. The di&s;tinction that is here made between the militia and the <HI>minute</HI> men may perhaps not be un|under&s;tood by &s;ome. The meaning of this di&s;tinction is, that a &s;elect body of the militia were engaged to hold them&s;elves ready upon all occa&s;ions, and at the &s;horte&s;t notice, for actual &s;ervice. That is, according to the phra&s;e, to be ready at a minute's warning. On this account they are &s;tiled minute men; and they have &s;hewn, by their readine&s;s and activity &s;ince, the pro|priety of their name.</P>
<P>The meetings of the general congre&s;s, and the con|ventions of particular provinces, were a dreadful eye|&s;ore to the government. The &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the American department, i&s;&s;ued a circular letter, for|bidding, in the king's name, and under the pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure, the election of deputies for the in&s;uing general congre&s;s; but this letter produced no effect. The elections took place every where, and even in the province of New-York, notwith&s;tanding their late promi&s;ing proceedings. Matters continued very quiet at Bo&s;ton, which happened on account of the injunc|tions of the general congre&s;s, more than from the &s;hips of war that crowded the harbour, or the force that was &s;tationed in the town. The calm was, how|ever, precarious and fictitious. Abundance of fuel had been gathered on both &s;ides, &s;ufficiently
<PB N="436" REF="447">prepared to kindle with the &s;malle&s;t &s;park; more was preparing, and the lea&s;t touch was likely to kindle a general conflagration. Upon the 26th of February, General Gage &s;ent a detachment of troops, under the command of a field officer, to &s;ieze &s;ome bra&s;s can|non he had been informed were depo&s;ited in the town of Salem. The&s;e &s;ailed aboard a tran&s;port to Marble-head, which lies four miles &s;outh of Salem, and about fourteen miles from the town of Bo&s;ton; from thence they marched to Salem, where they found no cannon. They were, however, &s;u&s;picious that they had been carried away that morning in con&s;equence of the report of their approach, and from this apprehen&s;ion marched farther into the coun|try, in hopes of overtaking them. In this pur&s;uit they arrived at a draw-bridge over a &s;mall river, where a number of the country people were a&s;&s;embled, and tho&s;e on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide had taken up the bridge to prevent their pa&s;&s;age. The commanding officer order|ed the bridge to be let down, which the people per|emptorily refu&s;ed to do, &s;aying, that it was a private road, and he had no authority to demand a pa&s;&s;age that way; for both &s;ides &s;till profe&s;&s;ed to keep the public peace, though war was in their hearts, and till the &s;word was drawn all re&s;i&s;tence was carried on upon legal grounds and pretences. If this was actually a private road, the &s;oldiers had no right to commit a tre&s;pa&s;s from a pretence of &s;eeking cannon, where they were not likely to find any, and the people had an un|doubted right to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age with the military as they were off the king's high way, and not travelling in the common road where &s;uch travellers were wont to pa&s;s. The officer, who &s;eems to have con&s;idered him&s;elf in an enemy's country, and not in a country where he was amenable to the laws, was determined to force his pa&s;&s;age, and perceiving a boat near at hand,
<PB N="437" REF="448">determined to make u&s;e of it to gain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge.&mdash;But the country people perceiving his de&s;ign, &s;everal of them jumped into it, and with axes cut holes in its bottom, which occa&s;ioned a &s;cufflle be|tween them and the &s;oldiers in and about the boat. Things were now tending to extremities, as the com|mander &s;eemed determined to force his pa&s;&s;age, and the others were as re&s;olutely bent to prevent it. In this &s;ituation were matters, when a clergyman in the neighbourhood, who had attended the whole tran&s;|action, remon&s;trated with the officer, who was a lieuten|ant colonel, upon the fatal con&s;equences that would in&s;ue, provided he made u&s;e of force; and finding that the officer &s;tood upon a point of honour in making good his pa&s;&s;age, more than any other thing, for it was then too late to go in &s;earch of the cannon, he per|&s;uaded the people to let down the bridge, which the troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. The colonel having &s;ent a detachment a &s;hort way into the country, in exerci&s;e of his right which he a&s;&s;umed, $$$y immediately return|ed, without mole&s;tation, on board the tran&s;port. Thus ended this fir&s;t expedition, without producing any material effect, and without much mi&s;chief. But it now appeared how &s;mall a matter would have produced ho&s;til|ities, and in what a precarious &s;ituation the peace of the empire now was; and that the lea&s;t exertion of the mili|tary would certainly bring matters to an extremity. There was one thing which greatly exa&s;perated the co|loni&s;ts, and that was, the act for taking away their char|ters, and for protecting the military from any trial in the province; this made them con&s;ider them&s;elves as under a military government. Every motion of the military body became &s;u&s;pected, and in the eyes of the people was con&s;idered as an exertion of the mo&s;t hateful and odious tyranny. This appearance of re&s;i&s;tence great|ly offended and irritated the military, who, from this
<PB N="438" REF="449">time, appear to have lived upon wor&s;e terms with the people of Bo&s;ton, than they had done before. Men who have been bred to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, and con&s;ider all inferiors merely under the command of their &s;uperiors, and bound to obey them without a&s;king or giving any other rea&s;on of their doing &s;o, than that they are commanded, con&s;ider all oppo&s;ition to their will and plea&s;ure as the mo&s;t heinous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. It becomes natural to them to rule over all whom they have power, according to the military law, for which rea&s;on they become very di&s;agreeable neighbours to all tho&s;e who have ju&s;t ideas of liberty, and pur&s;ue the rights of human nature. The Briti&s;h &s;oldiery ima|gining, as indeed was the ca&s;e, that they were &s;ent to Bo&s;ton to rule the town, and act towards the people as rebels to the king, began to in&s;ult the inhabitants, and to behave as in an enemy's country. Several of their outrages were now complained of, and all things &s;eemed to tend to a general rupture. The cri&s;is fa&s;t approached when all leffer calamities were to be for|gotten, in a general contemplation of tho&s;e of a great|er and more &s;erious nature.</P>
<P>The provincials having collected a con&s;iderable quantity of military &s;tores at the town of Concord, where the provincial congre&s;s was &s;itting, General Gage con&s;idered it as expedient to detach a party of the troops to de&s;troy them. Lieutenant Colonel Smith, and Major Pitcairn, with the grenadiers and light-in|fantry of the army, were detached for that purpo&s;e. It was confidently reported and believed at that time, that this military appointment had another object in view, and that the intention thereof principally was, to &s;eize Me&s;&s;rs Hancock and Adams, the&s;e great ob|noxious leaders of what was called the faction, which was again&s;t the new form of government. This de|tachment
<PB N="439" REF="450">is &s;aid to have con&s;i&s;ted of 900 men, prepar|ed and appointed for the purpo&s;e. This body of troops embarked on the night preceding the 19th of April, and landed at a place called Phipps's Farm, about &s;ix miles north-we&s;t from Charle&s;town Ferry; from thence they proceeded in their march with great &s;ilence and expedition, towards Concord. This town &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river of the &s;ame name, &s;ometimes al&s;o called Billerika, which runs into the river Mirimak, a little below the falls of Pantuket. On the road to Concord &s;tands Lexington, about five miles towards the ea&s;t; thither the troops marched with great expedition. Several officers upon hor&s;e|back &s;cured the country, and &s;ecured all the people which they found in their way at that early time, le&s;t they &s;hould give the alarm to the inhabitants, who would be ready to ri&s;e in arms to oppo&s;e their de&s;igns. This precaution, though it was abundantly prudent, did not prevent the town and the country people from receiving notice of their approach, which they &s;oon di&s;|covered by the firing of guns and ringing of bells. They were now a&s;&s;embling in the neighbouring villages be|fore day-light, and making preparations for the event which they feared. Upon the troops arriving at Lex|ington at five in the morning, they found the company of militia belonging to the town, a&s;&s;embled upon a green near the road; upon which an officer in the van called out, "Di&s;per&s;e ye rebels; throw down your arms and di&s;per&s;e;" the &s;oldiers at the &s;ame time, running up with loud hazzas, fired &s;ome &s;catter|ing &s;hot, and then gave a general di&s;charge, by which eight of the militia were killed, and &s;everal wounded. This was the fir&s;t &s;hedding of blood that happened in this unhappy and unnatural conte&s;t. Much pains have been taken on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion to prove
<PB N="440" REF="451">the others the aggre&s;&s;ors upon this occa&s;ion. The gazzete affirmed, that the troops were fired upon from &s;ome neighbouring hou&s;es; but for this there does not appear to be the &s;malle&s;t evidence. The gazzettes about that time were &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent and badly com|po&s;ed, often contradicted by the friends of govern|ment that were upon the &s;pot, that the public have &s;ince given very little credit to them. It appeared from the whole tenor of the evidence, as well as of our own people who were taken pri&s;oners, as from many of the provincials, all who&s;e depo&s;itions were taken by proper magi&s;trates, that the firing both at Lexington and Concord, was begun by the king's troops. It is not at all probable that tho&s;e in the hou&s;es would have expo&s;ed the lives of their friends in the militia, who were &s;tanding in a manner under the muzzles of the guns of the &s;oldiers, by &s;iring upon the troops from their covers. The few militia who were now in the power of the troops, may be con|ceived as &s;ufficient pledges to prevent any outrage from their friends and neighbours in te adjoining hou&s;es.</P>
<P>After this execution, the detachment proceeded to Concord, the commanding officer having previou&s;ly di&s;patched &s;ix companies of light infantry, to po&s;&s;e&s;s two bridges which lay beyond the town, upon the <HI>Sudbury</HI> and North Concord, with a de&s;ign to pre|vent any of the &s;tores from being carried away, or the two devoted rebels, Adams and Hancock, from e&s;caping. It happened, however, that they were di&s;appointed in both their views; for they could not find the&s;e two obnoxious per&s;ons, and except three old cannon, and a &s;mall quantity of flour, they found nothing of con&s;equence. They indeed did execution upon the cannon by rendering them un&s;erviceable,
<PB N="441" REF="452">and mo&s;t heroically threw the barrels of flour into the river. About a year after that flour would have been of &s;ome &s;ervice to the &s;ame troops, when they were cooped up in Bo&s;ton. It argues a great malignity of temper to de&s;troy the bounties of provi|dence, for fear that our enemies &s;hould enjoy them. We have certainly a right, provided we are in want of provi&s;ions, to prefer our&s;elves to our enemies; but wantonly to de&s;troy corn and flour, for fear others &s;hould u&s;e it, is a waring with providence, and decla|ring, we have no confidence in the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e. Weapons of war, and in&s;truments of ho&s;tility, may lawfully be de&s;troyed in the hands of our foes, or taken away from them whether we need them or not, but to de&s;troy that food which is the general &s;upport of all men, for fear tho&s;e we call enemies &s;hould u&s;e it, af|fords a different moral reflection. Be&s;ides, at this time the&s;e coloni&s;ts had not &s;hewn any acts of enmity again&s;t the troops; they were therefore both &s;eeking to &s;tarve and murder their friends and countrymen. The co|loni&s;ts appear to have indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided engaging in ho&s;tilities on this occa&s;ion; for a body of militia, which occupied a hill in the way between Concord and the bridge, retired, and pa&s;&s;ed along it at the ap|proach of the troops, which immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof. This &s;hews that they did not intend to have begun ho&s;tilities at this time, otherwi&s;e they would have di&s;puted the pa&s;&s;age of the bridge with the light in|fantry, which they might ea&s;ily have done. The mili|tia had not retired far till they perceived &s;everal fires in the town, which they imagined were hou&s;es in flames; they therefore returned towards the bridge which they had pa&s;&s;ed, which lay directly in their way. Upon this the light infantry retired on the Concord &s;ide of the river, and began to pull up the bridge; but
<PB N="442" REF="453">upon the approach of the militia, who &s;eemed indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly to avoid beginning the attack, and made as if they intended to pa&s;s as common travellers, the &s;ol|diers immediately fired and killed two men. The provincials returned the fire, and a &s;kirmi&s;h in&s;ued at the bridge, in which the king's troops were put into &s;ome confu&s;ion, and were forced to retreat, having &s;everal men killed and wounded, and a lieutenant and &s;ome others taken pri&s;oners. This fully proves that the provincials had no intention of beginning ho&s;tilities at this time; for they might have at fir&s;t di&s;puted the bridge with the troops, had they de&s;igned to have come to blows, more ea&s;ily than to drive them from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The country now aro&s;e upon the king's troops; they were attacked on all quar|ters, and &s;kirmi&s;h &s;ucceeded &s;kirmi&s;h. A continued, though &s;cattered and irregular fire, was maintained through the whole of a long and very hot day. The troops did not find it &s;o ea&s;y in marching back as they did in marching from Bo&s;ton. All the way between Concord and Lexington the hou&s;es, walls, and coverts, were lined with armed men, which con&s;tantly annoyed the troops, and they were pur&s;ued and attacked in the rear by the militia which defeated them at the bridge. They were now in a very critical &s;ituation, and much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, which evils they had brought upon them&s;elves, by their ra&s;hne&s;s in &s;hedding blood when they had no occa&s;ion; they were now likely to &s;uffer &s;everely, when Lord Percy arrived at Lexing|ton with a &s;trong reinforcement for their relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. General Gage, either through &s;u&s;picion of what would happen, or from knowing what orders he had given to Colonel Smith, had, early in the morn|ing, &s;ent off Earl Percy with &s;ixteen companies of foot, a detachment of marines, and two pieces of cannon,
<PB N="443" REF="454">to &s;upport the operations of the Colonel. This rein|forcement was ju&s;t arrived as the fatigued troops re|turned to Lexington. This fre&s;h a&s;&s;i&s;tance was the more acceptable and &s;ea&s;onable, as the troops are &s;aid to have been run &s;hort of all kinds of ammunition; but &s;uppo&s;e that had not been the ca&s;e, it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for them to have e&s;caped being cut off, or being taken, in the journey of fifteen miles they had to make before they arrived at Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>This powerful &s;upport gave them a breathing, and the cannon was of great &s;ervice to them. The&s;e kept the pur&s;uers at &s;ome di&s;tance, as they had no ordinance of the &s;ame kind to an&s;wer them. But when the troops re&s;umed their march the attack became more fierce and violent; the country a&s;&s;embled on all &s;ides, and attacked the forces with the utmo&s;t fury. Many were killed in the retreat by people that watched the approach of the troops behind walls, hedges, and ditches, and the danger encrea&s;ed until &s;un-&s;etting, when they arrived at Charle&s;town in a mo&s;t &s;hattered and fatigued &s;ituation. All things con&s;idered, both officers and men, who did not fall by the way, made an exceeding &s;wift and expeditious march back to Bo&s;|ton. What on this occa&s;ion was exceedingly &s;ingular was, the troops accu&s;ed the provincials of cruelty, and upbraided them with cowardice; though their behavi|our to their pri&s;oners &s;hewed the accu&s;ation to be fal&s;e, and the defeating the king's troops &s;hewed their a&s;&s;ertion of cowardice to be unju&s;t. It had long been the tone of military men, that the coloni&s;ts were cow|ards and would not fight, but they began now to ex|perience to their co&s;t that they had been greatly mi&s;|taken. Courage is a thing that may be acquired more ways than one; and is not confined to tho&s;e who make war a profe&s;&s;ion. When men are per&s;uaded
<PB N="444" REF="455">of the ju&s;tne&s;s of their cau&s;e, and are endowed with equal bodily &s;trength, a little practice in arms will render them as courageous as others; and in propor|tion as they pur&s;ue the ideas of ju&s;tice and true liber|ty, their courage will be more &s;teady, rational, and deliberate. People often mi&s;take madne&s;s and fury for courage, when, through the heat of pa&s;&s;ion, they ri&s;k their lives for what neither their rea&s;on nor con|&s;cience can approve; and often nece&s;&s;ity pa&s;&s;es under the &s;ame appellation; when men are obliged, by the force of command, to venture their lives one way, otherwi&s;e they will be taken from in another. Neither of the&s;e de&s;erve the name of true courage, for both of them may be found in other animals as well as in man. Ju&s;tice is the foundation of courage; all other exer|tions of force is violence and madne&s;s. There are &s;ome &s;pecies of courage like that of the gentleman who &s;aid he would chearfully go to hell, provided he could obtain the ruin of a cla&s;s of people he greatly abhorred.&mdash;This was daring courage, and wrought up to a great pitch.</P>
<P>This unfortunate beginning of the American war was not attended with &s;o great a lo&s;s of men on either &s;ide, as might have been expected from the length, irregu|larity, and variety of the engagement. This mu&s;t be attributed to the provincials having few men at fir&s;t, and to their afterwards being kept at a di&s;tance by the cannon of the king's troops. His maje&s;ty's forces as is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;uffered mo&s;t upon this occa|&s;ion; though it is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the number of killed and wounded in this unfortunate expedition. According to the neare&s;t and be&s;t calculation that has yet been given; of the king's troops there were killed, wounded, and taken, 273. Of the&s;e 65 were killed, 2 lieutenants, and above 20 private men were taken
<PB N="445" REF="456">pri&s;oners; and Colonel Smith, with another lieutenant-colonel, and &s;everal officers were wounded. Accord|ing to the provincial accounts, which give the names and places of abode of tho&s;e who fell on their &s;ide, their lo&s;s in killed and wounded, including tho&s;e that were killed in the morning at Lexington, amounted only to about 60, of which near two thirds were killed.</P>
<P>By the be&s;t accounts, there were near 2000 of the be&s;t troops in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, that were at this time &s;tationed at Bo&s;ton, employed in this expedition. The event proved to a demon&s;tration, how ill inform|ed many people at home were, who affirmed, that 500 men would force their way through the whole conti|nent of America, and the &s;ight of a grenadier would be &s;ufficient to put the whole American army to flight. Such idle and unguarded a&s;&s;ertions, even after this unfortunate expedition, were frequently uttered by the friends of the government, as they called them|&s;elves; and the cowardice of the provincials was &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on by per&s;ons who, either through ignorance and prejudice, were di&s;po&s;ed to per&s;i&s;t in their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>After this expedition was over, each party charged the other with the mo&s;t inhuman acts of cruelty. This has always been common in civil wars, and on &s;uch occa&s;ions it is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the exact point of truth on either &s;ide. Sometimes the wor&s;t part of the charge is too true, which is no argument in favour of the purity of human nature. On this occa&s;ion both parties were no doubt ready to give &s;trong co|lourings to the conduct and tran&s;actions of each other, and to exaggerate their actions and their criminality. The coloni&s;ts were charged by the king's troops of being guilty of the mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarity to the &s;oldiers that fell into their hands; whereas, &s;ome
<PB N="446" REF="457">officers and men, who were wounded and taken pri&s;oners, gave public te&s;timonials of the humanity with which they were treated. And the provincial commanders &s;ent an offer to General Gage, to admit his &s;urgeons to come and dre&s;s his wounded men.</P>
<P>The coloni&s;ts, on the other hand, charged the troops with killing the old and infirm, the unarmed and the wounded; with burning hou&s;es, and plunder|ing every thing that came in their way. Con&s;idering the character of &s;oldiers in the&s;e modern times, this is not at all unlikely; for though in our army there are both officers and common men that have honour and humanity, yet there are &s;uch a great number of officers that are mere &s;oldiers of fortune, and common men collected from the dregs of mankind, that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train them from evil when it is in the power of their hands to do it. It would have been a greater wonder if no &s;uch cruelties had happened, than that they &s;hould have fallen out in the time of action, when &s;uch a number of wicked people were concerned. But this is more to be imputed to the impo&s;&s;ibility of re&s;training bad men in the time of ac|tion, than to the intentions of government, or of the principal commanders in the army. There is no doubt that the provincials would be ready to give &s;trong colourings to every appearance of &s;everity, which the troops might proceed to, from the con&s;ider|ation that they were in a &s;tate of rebellion. We mu&s;t therefore, after examining all circum&s;tances, deter|mine according to the neare&s;t degree of certainty, or the highe&s;t degree of probability.</P>
<P>This affair at Concord put the whole province in motion, and al&s;o alarmed the whole continent of America. All New-England was now almo&s;t in arms; for although a &s;ufficient number were a&s;&s;embled to
<PB N="447" REF="458">inve&s;t the king's troops in Bo&s;ton, it was with difficulty that tho&s;e who were ha&s;tily marching from different parts could be prevailed upon to return to their re|re&s;pective places of abode. Every road that directed to Bo&s;ton was crouded with men in armour marching to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their friends in di&s;tre&s;s. General Wa&s;hington, with the Virginian hor&s;e and riflemen, were marching from the &s;outh, the New-Hamp&s;hire troops and rangers advancing by two ways from the north, and tho&s;e of Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land were po&s;ting from the &s;outh by another way. Along with the&s;e la&s;t were a company of artillery, and waggons with &s;tores and provi&s;ions. The body of militia a&s;|&s;embled in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, before the arrival of the troops from the other provinces, amounted to near 20,000, under the command of the Generals Ward, Pribble, Heath, Pre&s;cot, and Thomas. The&s;e gentlemen were before only colonels, but now acted in the capacity of generals; who, having fixed their head quarters at Cambridge, &s;even miles north-we&s;t from Bo&s;ton, formed a line of encampment, which on the right extended to Roxbury, towards the &s;outh a|bout the &s;ame di&s;tance from Bo&s;ton as Cambridge; on the &s;outh-we&s;t, along the &s;ide of Charles' River, oppo|&s;ite to Watertown, about ten miles from Bo&s;ton; and on the north, along the &s;ide of My&s;tic River, near to the &s;ame di&s;tance from the town. The di&s;tance be|tween the points was very near thirty miles. The&s;e were joined by General Putnam, an old officer, who had acquired experience and reputation in the two la&s;t wars. He encamped, with a body of Connecticut forces, in &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be ready to &s;upport tho&s;e who were before the town.</P>
<P>The affair of Concord and Lexington greatly ex|cited the indignation of the other colonies, and they
<PB N="448" REF="459">prepared for war with as much zeal as if an enemy had already appeared at their doors. It was a circum&s;tance which gave &s;pirit to the re&s;t of the colonies, that the militia of New-England had been able to make &s;uch a good defence, and in a manner even beat the king's troops; this was reported and publi&s;hed with great exultation, and it mu&s;t be allowed that it was an event that neither them&s;elves, nor any others, expected to have fallen out at that time. Tho&s;e who fell in the action were lamented with deep concern, and honour|ed not only as patriots, but as martyrs for the cau&s;e of liberty, who had nobly &s;acrificed their lives for the freedom of their country, and died like heroes in that great cau&s;e. The cruelties and outrages of the king's forces were now painted in &s;uch a light at the funerals of tho&s;e who were &s;lain in this action, that the &s;peeches and reports which were made, however ju&s;tly or un|ju&s;tly founded, produced a great effect, and encrea&s;ed like a violent flame throughout the whole continent.</P>
<P>The provincial congre&s;s, which was now removed to Watertown, drew up an addre&s;s to the inhabitants of Great-Britain, in which they &s;tated the mo&s;t material particulars that related to the engagement at Concord, and endeavoured to &s;hew that ho&s;tilities were fir&s;t be|gun by the king's troops, and that blood was fir&s;t &s;hed at Lexington by the regular forces. They al&s;o com|plain of the ravages committed by the troops in their retreat, and &s;eem to place much confidence in the honour, wi&s;dom, and valour of Britons, from which they expect their interference in preventing mea&s;ures which they repre&s;ent as equally ruinous to the mother country and the colonies. They al&s;o made great pro|fe&s;&s;ions of their loyalty, but at the &s;ame time declare, that they will not tamely &s;ubmit to the tyranny of a cruel mini&s;try; and they appeal to heaven, that they
<PB N="449" REF="460">are determined to be free. The provincial congre&s;s al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed a vote for mar&s;halling and &s;upporting an army; fixed the pay of the officers and &s;oldiers, and publi&s;hed rules and orders for its regulation and go|vernment. For this purpo&s;e they pa&s;&s;ed a vote for i&s;&s;uing a con&s;iderable &s;um in paper currency, which was to be received in all ca&s;es as money, and the faith of the province pledged for its payment; this was ap|pointed for the payment of the troops. The term for which they were cho&s;en was to expire on the 10th of May, &s;o they gave notice for a new election for members to the next congre&s;s, which was to meet on the 31&s;t of that month, at the &s;ame place, and to be continued for &s;ix months and no longer. They al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed a vote, declaring General Gage utterly di&s;quali|fied and incapable of &s;erving the colony as governour, or in any other capacity, and that in future no obedi|ence was due to him; but on the contrary, that he ought to be guarded again&s;t, and con&s;idered as a mo&s;t inveterate enemy to the country.</P>
<P>As one thing generally brings on another, and the coli&s;ion of parties, for the mo&s;t part, breaks in the end into outrage, the oppo&s;ition to government at la&s;t i&s;&s;ued in &s;eizing the revenues and magazines that be|longed to the king. In New-Jer&s;ey they &s;eized the trea&s;ury, and applied it again&s;t government, and for the purpo&s;e of their own defence. There was at this time a con&s;iderable &s;um of money in Jer&s;ey for the purpo&s;es of government, which was now appropriated for paying the new levies which were carrying on for the defence of the colonies. At the &s;ame time, with|out con&s;ulting with one another, a &s;top was made al|mo&s;t every where to the exportation of provi&s;ions; and in &s;ome places all kind of exportation was &s;topt till the &s;entiments of the general congre&s;s was taken
<PB N="450" REF="461">concerning that &s;ubject. Lord North's conciliatory plan, or the re&s;olution founded upon it, was totally rejected by the a&s;&s;embly of Philadelphia and New-Jer&s;ey; nor was it regarded or received in any place.</P>
<P>While things were going on in this manner, the governour and forces in Bo&s;ton, as al&s;o the inhabi|tants, continued clo&s;ely blocked up by land, and being &s;hut out from fre&s;h provi&s;ions and vegetables, which could ea&s;ily have been afforded from the neighbour|ing countries, they began to feel and experience a real di&s;tre&s;s. The inhabitants were in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion with the forces, and had no other re&s;ources for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; this made the provincials watch the more carefully to keep out any &s;upply, thinking the &s;oldiers would &s;uffer the inhabitants to depart for fear of an ab&s;olute famine; or at lea&s;t that the women and chil|dren would be &s;uffered to depart, which was repeat|edly required and applied for. There is &s;ome rea&s;on to imagine that the governour con&s;idered the inhabi|tants as nece&s;&s;ary ho&s;tages for the &s;ecurity of the town at lea&s;t, if not for the &s;afety of the troops. This had as much the appearance of cowardice as any thing that appeared in the conduct of the provincials; for it argued that they were afraid either to fight the colo|ni&s;ts in the open field, or to defend the town again&s;t their force. To keep women, old men, and children confined for a &s;ecurity for their own &s;afety, argued that they were either afraid to fight, or believed they were not able to conquer the force that was before the town. It had often been a&s;&s;erted at home, that a few regular troops would go through all America, but now a general, with a number of the be&s;t troops in the &s;ervice, was cooped up in a town, and dur&s;t not even &s;tay in it without old men, women, and children,
<PB N="451" REF="462">to guard them. This had a very bad appearance, and gave con&s;iderate people rea&s;on to conclude that the mini&s;try were greatly mi&s;taken in their conjectures.</P>
<P>The general at la&s;t entered into an agreement with the towns-people, that if they would deliver up their arms, they &s;hould have liberty to go where they plea&s;ed, and carry their effects where they had a mind. This they accordingly did; but to their amazement and &s;urprize, the governour refu&s;ed to fulfil the conditions on his &s;ide. This was matter of great complaint a|gain&s;t General Gage; and it mu&s;t be allowed, that it favoured both of cowardice and di&s;hone&s;ty; for though he had &s;tripped the towns-people of all their weapons of defence by means of treachery, he dur&s;t not &s;tay in it without them, for fear of the force that lay en|camped in the neighbourhood. Many, however, were &s;uffered afterwards to quit the town at different times, but they were obliged to leave all their effects behind them; &s;o that tho&s;e who had hitherto lived in affluence, were at once reduced to extreme indigence and mi&s;ery. The general congre&s;s complained loudly of this con|duct of the general, and ranked the &s;uffering of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton among the mo&s;t grievous and the mo&s;t bitter of their complaints. They &s;aid that pa&s;&s;|ports were granted in &s;uch a manner that families were broken, and the neare&s;t connections &s;eparated; part being compelled to leave the town, and part retained again&s;t their will. This was very di&s;honourable to General Gage, and one could wi&s;h that it had never happened; but as it was po&s;itively a&s;&s;irmed by the pro|vincials, and never contradicted, &s;o the truth of hi&s;tory requires it to be fairly &s;tated. The poor and the helple&s;s were all &s;ent out. It is po&s;&s;ible that the ideas which General Gage had of the Americans being rebels, made him conclude that they were a political
<PB N="452" REF="463">&s;ort of heretics, with whom no faith was to be kept, which made him break his promi&s;e in &s;uch a flagrant manner: It is certain that no man who believed that promi&s;es are &s;acred would have &s;o palpably violated a voluntary contract, when it was in his power to have performed it.</P>
<P>The continental congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled on the 10th of May at Philadelphia, and &s;oon adopted &s;uch mea&s;ures as e&s;tabli&s;hed the people in their conduct and re&s;olu|tion. One of their acts was for rai&s;ing an army, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a large paper currency for its payment; the &s;ecurity of the united colonies, which title they now a&s;&s;umed, was given for realizing the nominal value of this currency. They al&s;o prohibited the &s;up|plying the Briti&s;h fi&s;heries with any kind of provi&s;ions; and to inforce this prohibition the more effectually, they &s;topt all exportation to tho&s;e colonies and i&s;lands which &s;till remained in their obedience to Great-Britain. This was a home &s;troke which the mini&s;try and people in the mother country were not thinking upon; it was a mea&s;ure they never apprehended the coloni&s;ts would have fallen upon in their then &s;ituation. It greatly di&s;$re&s;&s;ed the people of Newfoundland, and all tho&s;e who were employed in the fi&s;neries; in&s;omuch, that to prevent an ab&s;olute famine, &s;everal &s;hips were o|bliged to return light from that &s;tation, to carry out cargoes of provi&s;ions from Ireland. When the tidings of this re&s;olution came to Britain, it was con&s;idered as a mere chimera, and it was &s;aid that the coloni&s;ts would not continue in this re&s;olution, becau&s;e it would greatly injure them&s;elves; but the&s;e per&s;ons after|wards found a &s;teadine&s;s in the re&s;olutions of the colo|ni&s;ts, which they never expected would have happen|ed. The mini&s;try at home &s;eem to have been either ill informed concerning the temper of the coloni&s;ts,
<PB N="453" REF="464">or willing to be deceived; for nothing fell out accord|ing to their profe&s;&s;ed hopes and expectations. In the progre&s;s of future events in this conte&s;t, they al|ways found them&s;elves di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The city and province of New-York, from which government had the greate&s;t hopes, on account of their former re&s;olutions, upon receiving the news of the action at Concord and Lexington, began to depart from their moderation, and &s;eemed to have received a liberal portion of the common temper and &s;pirit that operated in the other colonies. A mo&s;t numerous a&s;&s;ociation was formed, and a provincial congre&s;s was cho&s;en. The &s;ituation of this city and province was at this time very critical; for &s;ome regiments of troops were expected from Ireland, and as New York is ex|po&s;ed to the &s;ea, it was not probable that it would be able to abide an attack. However, a body of men from Connecticut arrived in the neighbourhood of that city, avowedly for its protection, and with an in|tention to &s;upport the di&s;po&s;ition of the people. But as there were &s;u&s;picions of the in&s;ufficiency of this force in ca&s;e of an attack by &s;ea, they applied to the general congre&s;s for advice how to behave upon the arrival of the troops. The congre&s;s, with a prudence which would in &s;ome a&s;&s;emblies have been accounted great wi&s;dom and &s;agacity, advi&s;ed them for the pre|&s;ent to act defen&s;ively with re&s;pect to the troops, as far as it could be done con&s;i&s;tently with their own &s;e|curity and &s;afety;&mdash;to permit them to occupy the bar|racks, &s;o long as they behaved quietly and peaceably, but not to &s;uffer them to erect any fortifications, or in any manner to cut off the communication between the city and the country. If they attempted ho&s;tilities they &s;hould defend them&s;elves, and repel force by
<PB N="454" REF="465">force. They al&s;o advi&s;ed them to provide for the wor&s;t that might happen, by &s;ecuring places of retreat for the women and children; by removing the arms and ammunition from the magazines; and by keeping a &s;uf|ficient number of men embodied for the protection of the inhabitants in general. The departure of &s;uch a number of helple&s;s objects from the places of their habitation, was a very affecting &s;ight, and an unu&s;ual &s;pectacle. That once flouri&s;hing and trading city was now almo&s;t become a wilderne&s;s. It was by its own inhabitants devoted to the flames. It was one happy circum&s;tance for New-York, that the troops were more wanted at Bo&s;ton, and did not at this time land at that place. It was probably not in the favour of government that the troops did not arrive at New-York at this time; for it gave both the town and the province time to form, and to confirm their re&s;olutions, and to drink more deep in the &s;ame &s;ources of difaffec|tion with the re&s;t of the colonies.</P>
<P>While Bo&s;ton was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king's troops, and &s;urrounded with the provincial armies, a few private adventurers attempted an enterprize which was a&s;toni&s;hing to all Europe. Some per&s;ons belonging to the back parts of Connecticut, Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, and New-York, undertook at their own ri&s;k, and without any public command or authority, or without communicating their de&s;igns, an expedi|tion of the utmo&s;t importance, which not only in its con&s;equence mo&s;t materially affected the intere&s;ts of government in the colonies, but brought the que&s;tion to a point of critical nicety, whether Britain &s;hould have a &s;ingle po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion left in all North-America. This was the &s;urprizing of Ticonderago, Crown-Point, and other forts &s;ituated on the Great Lakes, and which commanded the pa&s;&s;es between the Briti&s;h
<PB N="455" REF="466">colonies and Canada. Some of tho&s;e who had formed this de&s;ign, and were &s;et out upon this expedition with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy, met others upon their march, who, without any previous concert, were &s;et out upon the &s;ame de&s;ign, and embarked in the &s;ame project. The&s;e adventurers, amounting to 240 men of Colonel Ea&s;ton and Colonel Ethan Allen's, with great per&s;e|verence and addre&s;s &s;urprized the &s;mall garri&s;ons of Ticonderago and Crown-Point. They took the&s;e two fortifications without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle man on either &s;ide. In the&s;e forts they found a con&s;iderable quan|tity of artillery, amounting, as was reported, to 200 pieces of cannon, be&s;ides &s;ome mortars, howitzers, and quantities of other &s;tores; they al&s;o took two ve&s;|&s;els, which gave them the command of Lake Champ|lain, and materials provided at Ticonderago for the building and equipping others. This was as daring an act of intrepidity as had been known for a long time, and &s;hewed that the coloni&s;ts were now in earne&s;t in their oppo&s;ition. Such an enterprize performed by Briti&s;h forces, would have been accounted an act of heroi&s;m, and was no le&s;s a bold action when per|formed by tho&s;e provincials.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, the Generals Howe, Burgoyne, and Clinton, arrived at Bo&s;ton from England, together with a reinforcement of marines, and draughts from other regiments, to &s;upply the vacancies that were in the troops at Bo&s;ton. Several regiments from Ireland &s;oon followed the&s;e, &s;o that the forces at Bo&s;ton, with re&s;pect to number, the goodne&s;s of the troops, and the character of the com|manding officers, were become very re&s;pectable, and it was now thought that matters could not remain long in the &s;ituation they were then in. No remark|able
<PB N="456" REF="467">achievements had for &s;ome time been performed on either &s;ide; the blockade was continued, but no|thing material attempted, except &s;ome &s;mall &s;kirmi&s;hes for provi&s;ions, which happened in the i&s;lands which ly in the bay, in which the king's troops were wor&s;t|ed. In the la&s;t &s;kirmi&s;h which happened at Noddle|i&s;land, a &s;mall i&s;land which lies ea&s;t from Bo&s;ton, they de&s;troyed a &s;chooner belonging to government, which had been left by the tide, in &s;pite of all oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>Matters continued &s;till in the &s;ame &s;ituation at Bo&s;|ton, notwith&s;tanding of the new generals, and rein|forcement of fre&s;h troops. Both parties appear to have been doubtful of the event of an engagement, and indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided coming to action as long as they could. It is highly probable, that the provincials would have made an attempt to &s;torm the town, im|mediately after the affair of Lexington, had not they been determined to &s;pare it for the fake of their friends who were in it; this prevailed over every other con&s;ideration. It mu&s;t be granted, that from the num|ber of &s;hips of war which almo&s;t &s;urrounded the penin|&s;ula, as well as the va&s;t artillery by which it was pro|tected, and the goodne&s;s of the troops, that &s;uch an attempt would have been attended with great danger and difficulty, and that the de&s;truction of the town mu&s;t have been the certain con&s;equence. There were o|ther cau&s;es that operated on this occa&s;ion, in deter|mining the provincials not to attack the town. A re|pul&s;e, or even a victory, attended with much blood|&s;hed in &s;o arduous a &s;truggle, might have been at|tended with fatal con&s;equences. The people were not yet accu&s;tomed to war; their &s;ituation was new and critical; they were entering into a conte&s;t of a
<PB N="457" REF="468">&s;ingular nature, untried, unthought of, and unnatural; loaded with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences, without a precedent to direct them, or experience to guide them: nor had they as yet given up all hopes of an accommo|dation. They were therefore afraid that tho&s;e who were not fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in their principles of oppo|&s;ition, would totally condemn any violent mea&s;ures which might exclude them from &s;uch a de&s;irable e|vent. In this &s;tate of anxious hope and fear much caution was nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed, le&s;t any un&s;uccesful event might &s;uddenly damp the &s;pirit and ardour of the people, &s;tagger their re&s;olution, and di&s;olve their confederacy.</P>
<P>The continental congre&s;s upon the 8th of June, re&s;olved that the compact between the crown of Eng|land, and the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay was di&s;&s;olv|ed, by the violation of the charter of William and Mary; and recommended to the people of that pro|vince, to proceed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new govern|ment, by the electing a governour and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, ac|cording to the powers contained in the original char|ter. They pa&s;&s;ed another re&s;olution, that no bill of exchange, draught, or order, of any officer in the army or navy, their agents or contractors, &s;hould be received or negociated, or any money &s;upplied to them by any per&s;on; and prohibited the &s;upplying of the army or navy, or &s;hips employed in the tran&s;port &s;er|vice, with provi&s;ions or nece&s;&s;aries of any kind. They at the &s;ame time erected a general po&s;t-office at Philadelphia, which extended through the united colonies; and &s;ome time after, placed Dr Franklin, who had been di&s;graced and removed from that office by government, at the head thereof. The congre&s;s had now, under the &s;oft idea of recommendation and
<PB N="458" REF="469">advice, a&s;&s;umed the power of a &s;upreme govern|ment.</P>
<P>General Gage, nearly about the &s;ame time, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, in which was offered, in the king's name, a free pardon to all tho&s;e who &s;hould forthwith lay down their arms, and return to their re&s;pective oc|cupations and peaceable duties, excepting only from the benefit of the pardon, Samuel A dams, and John Hancock, who&s;e offences were con&s;idered to be &s;o a|trocious as to be beyond the reach of forgivene&s;s. All &s;uch as did not accept of this offered mercy, or who &s;hould protect, a&s;&s;i&s;t, conceal, or corre&s;pond with them, were to be treated as rebels and traitors. It was al&s;o declared, that as a &s;top was put to the due cour&s;e of law and ju&s;tice, that the martial law &s;hould take place till the laws were re&s;tored to their former cour&s;e, and ju&s;tice executed in its u&s;ual chan|nel. This proclamation produced no effect. Mr Hancock was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of the congre&s;s at the very &s;ea&s;on that this proclamation was intended to operate. Such a proclamation at this time was con|&s;idered as a preliminary to immediate action; accord|ingly, from this time both parties held them&s;elves in readine&s;s for it. The po&s;t of Charle&s;town had been neglected by both parties, though it was a po&s;t of much con&s;equence; for by having the command of the rock which joins the penin&s;ula to the continent, tho&s;e that are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, have it in their power to &s;top the pa&s;&s;ages to the north and north-we&s;t, and to prevent the communication between Bo&s;ton, the we&s;t parts of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, New-Hamp&s;hire, and the other parts to wards the we&s;t and north-we&s;t. The neck of the penin&s;ula is not much above half a mile in breadth, and by being properly fortified, may
<PB N="459" REF="470">command Charles' river on the &s;outh, and My&s;tic river on the north, and interrupt the communication be|tween Bo&s;ton and tho&s;e parts of the bay on both &s;ides, in a great mea&s;ure. It would have been an ea&s;y matter for the king's forces, who had the com|mand of the river, to have fortified this neck, and rendered it exceedingly &s;erviceable to them. They found afterwards their mi&s;take in neglecting it. The provincials con&s;idered it of &s;ervice for them, whether they &s;hould chu&s;e to act on the defen&s;ive or offen&s;ive. There is a ri&s;ing ground, called Bunker-hill, ju&s;t within the neck, that joins the penin&s;ula to the con|tinent. This neck is very like that on which Bo&s;|ton &s;tands; except the I&s;thmus is con&s;iderably wider, and Bunker-hill higher, than any hill in the other. The towns are only &s;eparated by Charles' river, which, in that part, is only about the breadth of the Thames between London and Southwark; &s;o that Charle&s;town &s;eemed to hold the &s;ame connection with Bo&s;ton, that the Borough does with London. We&s;t from Bunker hill lies another ri&s;ing ground called Winter|hill, and on the right hand, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, ano|ther called Pro&s;pect-hill; all the&s;e being contiguous, were advantageous po&s;ts, and were by this &s;tep in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the provincials.</P>
<P>The party that was &s;ent in the night to fortify Bunker-hill, carried on their work with &s;o much &s;ecre|cy and expedition, that though the penin&s;ula was &s;ur|rounded with &s;hips of war and &s;py boats, they were not heard during the night, and &s;uch extraordinary di&s;patch had they u&s;ed, that in the morning by day|break, they had a &s;mall redoubt, con&s;iderable en|trenchments, and a brea&s;t-work, that in &s;ome parts was cannon-proof, very near compleated. The &s;ight
<PB N="460" REF="471">of the&s;e works was the fir&s;t notice that alarmed the Lively man of war in the morning, and her guns cal|led the town, camp, and fleet to behold a &s;ight which appeared little le&s;s than a prodigy. A heavy and continued fire of cannon, howitzers, and mortars, was now carried on upon the works, from the &s;hips, floating batteries, and from the top of Cop's-hill in Bo&s;ton. Such an ince&s;&s;ant and prodigious roar of ar|tillery, would have been a trial to the courage and firmne&s;s of the olde&s;t &s;oldiers, and mu&s;t have undoubt|edly greatly interrupted the fini&s;hing of the works; it was however &s;aid, that the provincials bore this &s;evere fire with wonderful firmne&s;s, and &s;eemed to go on with their bu&s;ine&s;s as if no enemy had been near, nor any danger in the &s;ervice. General Gage now per|ceived that the provincials were not to be frighted merely with the found of cannons and mortars, and that &s;ome more effectual method behoved to be u&s;ed to make them give over their undertaking. About noon, June 21&s;t, the &s;ame day that the works were be|gun, and brought to the condition that has been men|tioned, he ordered a con&s;iderable body of troops un|der the command of Major Gen. Howe, and Brigadier Pigot, to drive the provincials from their works. This detachment con&s;i&s;ted of 10 companies of grenadiers, as many of light-infantry, and the 5th, 38th, 43d, 51&s;t, and 52d battallions, with a &s;uitable artillery, landed and drawn up without oppo&s;ition from the &s;hips of war. The two generals found the enemy &s;o advan|tagiou&s;ly po&s;ted, and in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence, that they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end back for a rein|forcement before they began the attack. They were accordingly joined with &s;ome companies of light-in|fantry and grenadiers, by the 47 regiment, and by the
<PB N="461" REF="472">1&s;t battallion of marines, amounting in whole, as re|pre&s;ented by General Gage's letter, to &s;omething more than 2000 men.</P>
<P>The attack was begun by a heavy di&s;charge of can|non and howitzers, under which the troops advanced in a &s;low march towards the enemy, and halted &s;everal times to afford time for the artillery to de&s;troy the works, and to throw the provincials into confu&s;ion. But this did not happen according to their expecta|tions; for the enemy remained &s;teady, and the troops were unu&s;ually &s;taggered in this attack. The provin|cials threw &s;ome men into the hou&s;es of Charle&s;town, which covered their right flank, by which means General Pigot, who commanded the left wing, and who behaved with great bravery and firmne&s;s, was at once expo&s;ed to the fire of the lines, and to that from the hou&s;es. In this attack Charle&s;town was &s;et on fire, and burnt to a&s;hes. It remains a point as yet un|determined how and by whom this town was &s;et on fire; whether by bombs from the &s;hips, or by the troops. It is mo&s;t probable that the troops &s;et it on fire, for their own defence again&s;t the attack that was made from the hou&s;es, and with a de&s;ign to di&s;lodge the provincials that were in it. Whatever way it happened, that fine town, con&s;i&s;ting of 400 hou&s;es, was reduced to a&s;hes. The provincials were &s;till un|moved, notwith&s;tanding the continual fire of &s;mall arms and artillery. They behaved like veterans, and troops of the greate&s;t experience. All this, while they did not return a &s;ingle &s;hot, until the king's forces had almo&s;t approached their works, when a dreadful fire took place, by which a number of brave Briti&s;h officers fell. Some officers who had &s;erved in the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed actions in the la&s;t war, declared,
<PB N="462" REF="473">that this action, for the time it la&s;ted, was the hotte&s;t engagement they ever &s;aw. It is no wonder, if under &s;o heavy and de&s;tructive a fire, our troops were thrown into di&s;order. It was reported that General Howe was for a few &s;econds left almo&s;t alone; and it is cer|tain that mo&s;t of the officers that was near his per&s;on were either killed or wounded. He de&s;erves the greate&s;t prai&s;e for his coolne&s;s and intrepidity on this occa&s;ion; he fully di&s;covered, that &s;olid and rational courage that has appeared &s;o con&s;picuous in the fami|ly of the Howes. General Clinton, who at this time had ju&s;t arrived from Bo&s;ton, during the time of the engagement, is &s;aid to have rallied the troops, and led them on again to charge the enemy. After a mo&s;t dreadful carnage, they attacked the works with fixed bayonets, and di&s;lodged the provincials. This would have been a work of mueh more &s;laughter, provided the coloni&s;ts had been &s;ufficiently provided with bay|onets; for though many of them had no bayonets, and their ammunition was expended, they fought de&s;perately within the works, and were with difficulty drove from them. They, however, retreated over Charle&s;town neck, which was enfiladed by the guns of the Gla&s;gow man of war, and of two floating bat|teries. The&s;e did but &s;mall execution, though the dread of it had prevented &s;ome regiments, who were ordered to &s;upport that po&s;t from fulfilling their duty.</P>
<P>The battle of Bunker's-hill was one of the mo&s;t bloody actions that has happened this long time, in which there were more Briti&s;h officers killed and wounded, according to the proportion of the number engaged, than were in any engagement la&s;t war. According to the public accounts, publi&s;hed by authority, the whole lo&s;s in killed and wounded amounted to 1054, of whom
<PB N="463" REF="474">226 were killed; of the&s;e 19 were commi&s;&s;ioned offi|cers, including a lieutenant-colonel, 2 majors, and 7 captains; 70 other officers were wounded. Among tho&s;e who were mo&s;t lamented on this occa&s;ion were lieutenant-colonel Abercromby, and Major Pitcairne of the marines. The majors, Williams and Spendlove, the la&s;t of which died of his wounds &s;ome time after the action, had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in &s;uch a man|ner as to make their lo&s;s more &s;en&s;ibly felt. The king's troops behaved with much bravery, as was ma|nife&s;t by the event; for there was &s;carce a &s;ingle offi|cer who had not an opportunity of &s;ignalizing him&s;elf, and the generals and field officers u&s;ed the mo&s;t extra|ordinary efforts. All the&s;e things concur to &s;hew the dangerous and difficult &s;ervice in which they were en|gaged. The battle of Quebec in the la&s;t war, with all the glory and va&s;t con&s;quences that attended it, was not &s;o de&s;tructive to our officers as this entrench|ment, thrown up in a few hours. It was a matter of grievous reflection, that &s;uch brave men, many of whom had contributed to exalt the dignity of their country in &s;ubduing her enemies and enlarging her territories, &s;hould have fallen in &s;upporting a power that was &s;eeking to en&s;lave and ruin the Briti&s;h em|pire. The&s;e brave Briti&s;h officers found to their &s;ad experience what wonderful exertions the &s;pirit of li|berty will produce even in unexperienced and raw troops. The provincials, who had been rated as cow|ards and poltroons in the mini&s;terial vocabulary, un|der the influence of the powerful &s;pirit of liberty &s;hewed in&s;tances of wi&s;dom, courage and intrepidity, that would not have di&s;graced troops of more experi|ence and reputation. The con&s;equences of this action were of more advantage to tho&s;e that were &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="464" REF="475">to be vanqui&s;hed, than to the conquerors; for the provincials began to find that they could face the king's troops, and al&s;o to make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon them; and they al&s;o di&s;covered, that they could re|treat without being pur&s;ued by the king's troops, which had confirmed them in the opinion that their enemies had &s;uffered &s;everely. What was the lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the provincials could not be learned by our troops; for unle&s;s 30 wounded men which were left on the field, the Briti&s;h forces took no pri&s;oners. Ac|cording to the account publi&s;hed by the congre&s;s of the province, their lo&s;s was comparatively &s;mall, a|mounting to about 450 killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing. They affirm that on our &s;ide the &s;laughter was much more con&s;iderable; but of this our accounts &s;aid no|thing. It was affirmed that the provincials buried a great number of their dead in the time of their en|gagement; but this is an extraordinary circum&s;tance, which does not appear very credible; or if it was true, it &s;hews that they had plenty of time, and were not hardly charged by our troops.</P>
<P>The per&s;on among the provincials that was mo&s;t lamented, who was &s;lain in this action, was Doctor Warren, who acted as a major-general and comman|der on this occa&s;ion; he was killed fighting bravely at the head of his troops, in a little redoubt to the right of the lines. This gentleman, who was generally e|&s;teemed for his merits, eloquence, and other abilitics, had been one of the delegates to the fir&s;t general con|gre&s;s, and was at this time pre&s;ident of the provincial congre&s;s. He is &s;aid to have been an eminent phy&s;i|cian, and a per&s;on of an amiable character. When he &s;aw his country going to be en&s;laved, as he judged, he fired with indignation at the thought, and broke thro'
<PB N="465" REF="476">all the endearing ties of family &s;atisfaction, and de|voted him&s;elf to the public &s;ervice of the community, and fell gallantly in the cau&s;e of freedom and liberty. &mdash;They lo&s;t &s;ome other officers of character, one of whom, a lieutenant-colonel, died of his wounds, in the pri&s;on of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to &s;ettle the different claims of parties, with re&s;pect to this action. Each &s;ide claimed much ho|nour to them&s;elves. The king's troops &s;aid they defeat|ed three times their own number, out of a &s;trong forti|fied po&s;t, and under many di&s;advantages. On the o|ther &s;ide, they repre&s;ented the regulars as amounting to 3000 men, and rated them&s;elves at the number of only 1500; and affirmed that this &s;mall body not only with&s;tood their attack, and repeatedly repul&s;ed them with great lo&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the powerful artille|ry they had brought with them, but that they had at the &s;ame time, and for &s;everal hours, &s;u&s;tained a mo&s;t &s;evere and intolerable fire from the &s;hips, floating bat|teries, and fixed battery at Bo&s;ton, which prevented them from being able to fini&s;h their works. In ca|&s;es of this &s;ort, great allowances mu&s;t be made for the prejudice of parties; for it is very common for each &s;ide of a que&s;tion to &s;ay the mo&s;t favourable things of them&s;elves that they can. The number of the provincials were perhaps neither &s;o many as our accounts &s;et them forth, nor &s;o few as they them&s;elves pretended. It is however manife&s;t that the coloni&s;ts were not ca&s;ten down nor di&s;pirited by this defeat; and it appears that they both had &s;ome judgment of the power of our troops, and of their own &s;trength. It is highly probable that our troops on this occa&s;ion, though they pretended to de&s;pi&s;e the provincials, as inferior to them in courage and military di&s;cipline,
<PB N="466" REF="477">received &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion of what they would and could do, which made them more cautious afterwards. Had &s;ome of our boa&s;ting heroes at home been in the &s;ituation of General Howe and his officers, they would have been more cautious in talking of Ameri|can cowardice. The provincials &s;hewed a great de|gree of activity and &s;kill in the con&s;truction of their works, and of &s;teadine&s;s and con&s;tancy in defending them, under many great di&s;advantages. They &s;aid, tho' they had lo&s;t a po&s;t, they had almo&s;t all the effects of a compleat victory; as they entirely put a &s;top to the offen&s;ive operations of a large army &s;ent to &s;ubdue them; and which they continued to block up in a narrow town. They now triumphed that their ac|tions had refuted tho&s;e reproaches which had been thrown upon them in England, of being deficient in courage and re&s;olution. The advantages of this en|gagement did not counterbalance the lo&s;s to the King's troops; for all that could be &s;aid to have been obtained in lieu of 1054 men killed and wounded was 5 pieces of cannon, and 30 wounded men.</P>
<P>The provincials after the action at Bunker's-hill, threw up works upon Winter-hill, on their &s;ide Chare&s;town neck, &s;o that the troops were as clo&s;ely inve&s;ted in that penin&s;ula, as they had been in Bo&s;|ton. They were al&s;o indefatigable in &s;ecuring the mo&s;t expo&s;ed po&s;ts of the lines with redoubts cover|ed with artillery, and advanced their works clo&s;e to the fortification on Bo&s;ton-neck, where with equal boldne&s;s and addre&s;s they burnt a guard-hou&s;e be|longing to the king's troops. As the army was abun|dantly furni&s;hed with all manner of military &s;tores, and artillery; the troops were not &s;paring in throw|ing &s;hells and maintaining a great cannonade upon

<P>The melancholy effects of this battle, appeared mo&s;t manife&s;t in the ruins of the town of Charle&s;town, which was now an affecting &s;pectacle to the &s;erious and un|prejudiced of all parties. It was the fir&s;t &s;ettlement made in this colony, and was con&s;idered as the mother of Bo&s;ton; for the town of Bo&s;ton was fir&s;t built by a number of emigrants from Charle&s;town &s;ome &s;hort time after the year 1630. Chare&s;town was large, hand&s;ome, and well-built,&mdash;both with regard to its public and private edifices; it was about half as large as Bo&s;ton, and was capable of being made as &s;trong, for it &s;tood upon a penin&s;ula much in the fame man|ner as Bo&s;ton does, and had nearly the &s;ame natural advantages. It was both a market and county town, being the county town of Middle&s;ex, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay. It had a good large church, a market-place in a hand&s;ome &s;quare by the river &s;ide, &s;upplied with all nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions, both of fle&s;h and fi&s;h,&mdash;and two large &s;treets leading down to it, which were both re|gular and elegant. It carried on the greate&s;t trade of any town in the province, except Bo&s;ton. It is &s;aid that the two ports cleared out a thou&s;and ve&s;&s;els an|nually for foreign trade, exclu&s;ive of a va&s;t number of coa&s;ters. Such is the end of human labour, wi&s;|dom and indu&s;try&mdash;and &s;uch the effects and fatal fruits of civil di&s;&s;ention and di&s;cord! The work of a day will ruin the labour of ages, and lay riches, grandeur, magnificence, and &s;plendour in ruins.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's forces were now in a very ineligible
<PB N="468" REF="479">&s;ituation; they were deprived of provi&s;ions from the country, by two cau&s;es;&mdash;they were hedged in by the provincial troops by land, and the colonies had agreed to &s;end them none by &s;ea. They had nothing but what they had from the &s;hips, or what they took at the hazard of their lives; and their duty was now doubled, by being obliged both to guard their en|campment and defend the town. This evil had one advantage attending it; it enlarged their quarters, and afforded them more room, and more fre&s;h air.&mdash;They were mo&s;t dreadfully incommoded in the town during the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;ummer, which was ready to bring on di&s;tempers and crowd the ho&s;pitals: This encampment was therefore a &s;ort of relief for the pre&s;ent, tho' it was attended with more fatigue. &mdash;Their wants were at the &s;ame time very grievous, their &s;ituation irk&s;ome and degrading: they were in|&s;ulted by an enemy whom they had been taught to de|&s;pi&s;e, and in continual alarm from a people whom they had &s;ufficiently provoked. Their provi&s;ions were both &s;alt and bad; and, like other things that are de|rived from government contracts, were pernicious in their effects, and exorbitant in their price. The heat of the climate, the badne&s;s of provi&s;ions, and confine|ment, naturally brought on di&s;ea&s;es, and filled the ho&s;|pitals. The number of &s;ick and wounded, at a mode|rate computation, amounted now to 1600. Con&s;ider|ing all circum&s;tances, if was a wonder there were not more in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation. It was however for|tunate, that few, in compari&s;on of the numbers that were &s;ick, died.</P>
<P>A regiment of light cavalry arrived from Ireland,&mdash;which, in&s;tead of affording aid to their friends, were rather a grievance; for they were never able to &s;et a
<PB N="469" REF="480">foot out of the garri&s;on, and only helped to con&s;ume the provi&s;ions which were in the town; by which means both the &s;oldiers and the town's people were more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Almo&s;t all circum&s;tances that concurred to di&s;tre&s;s and render the troops unea&s;y; they found from experience that the provincials were not &s;uch cowards as they had been repre&s;ented, and that it was dangerous to pre&s;ume too far upon that hypo|the&s;is, and that many of tho&s;e things which they needed greatly could not be obtained without encountering a de&s;perate enemy. They were con&s;tantly witne&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t daring adventures performed by per&s;ons whom they had been told were mean, da&s;tardly pol|troons, and who would run at the &s;ight of a grenadier.&mdash;They were now not only obliged to ri&s;k their lives for &s;upplies of nece&s;&s;ary food for them&s;elves, but to venture them for &s;upplies to their hor&s;es; for hay, as well as bread, corn, and fle&s;h, was become an article of very great importance. The hay, &s;heep, and cattle in the i&s;lands were now as much the rea&s;ons of war, as the rights of the Briti&s;h parliament over America; and they were heartily in earne&s;t to fight for their food, who were indifferent about fighting for the dominion of others. The provincials knew the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of the troops, and under&s;tood what ne|ce&s;&s;ity would &s;ugge&s;t to them; having therefore pro|cured a number of whale boats, and being ma&s;ters of the &s;hore and inlets of the bay, they burnt, de&s;troyed, and carried away, in &s;pite of all the &s;hips of war and armed ve&s;&s;els, tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary articles which the King's troops &s;tood mo&s;t in need of.&mdash;The&s;e enterpri&s;es brought on &s;undry &s;kirmi&s;hes, and the provincials grew &s;o daring at length, as to burn the light-hou&s;e, which was built upon an i&s;land at the entrance of the
<PB N="470" REF="481">harbour, tho's a man of war lay within a mile of them at the time. Some carpenters were afterwards, un|der the protection of a &s;mall party of marines, to erect a temporary light-hou&s;e, when they killed and carried off the whole detachment. All the&s;e actions were at home repre&s;ented as deeds of cowardice, and we heard nothing from mini&s;terial demagogues, except, coward, rebel, or poltroon. Such is the infatuation of prejudiced minds, when &s;et upon a favourite pro|ject, that they not only will not perceive the truth, but wilfully pervert it. Even when appearances were &s;trongly again&s;t us, we &s;till interpreted them in our own favour; from whence the public news became the vehicles of fal&s;hood, mi&s;information, and decep|tion. We were promi&s;ed that in one campaign the war would be ended, the Americans obliged to &s;ub|mit to the will and plea&s;ure of the mini&s;ter, and Bri|tain indemnified for all her expences by the wealth of the colonies. So far will blinded mortals proceed, when pride, intere&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ion put out their eyes.</P>
<P>While the troops were thus blockaded in Bo&s;ton, a war of plunder commenced, or in more polite terms, it became praedatory. It was carried on be|tween the &s;hips of war and the inhabitants in differ|ent parts of the coa&s;t. The fir&s;t being refu&s;ed the provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries which they wanted for them&s;elves or the army, endeavoured to obtain them by force, and in the&s;e attempts were frequently oppo&s;ed, and &s;ometimes repul&s;ed by the country peo|ple. The &s;eizing of &s;hips according to the new laws, or at the commands of the admiral, was al&s;o a conti|nual &s;ource of animo&s;ity, the proprietors naturally hazarding all dangers, in defence, or for the recovery of their property. The&s;e conte&s;ts brought the ven|geance
<PB N="471" REF="482">of the men of war, upon &s;everal of the &s;mall towns upon the &s;ea coa&s;t, &s;ome of which underwent a &s;evere correction. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the argu|ment concerning cowardice appeared to have as much force on the one &s;ide as the other; for if the provin|cials took the advantage of their country, and did not expo&s;e them&s;elves unnece&s;&s;arily to the violence of our men, our troops were cautious to keep within reach of their &s;hips, and did not venture to penetrate into the country. It might have been expected while the war was hanging in this kind of &s;u&s;pence, and both parties &s;eemed afraid to venture a general en|gagement, that &s;ome &s;parks of wi&s;dom would have &s;prung up in the minds of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and that they would have tried &s;ome &s;oftening mea&s;ures, to have prevented the further &s;hedding of blood.&mdash;But either pride or revenge operated &s;trongly upon their temper, and the blood they had &s;hed was only a &s;ort of a whet which made their appetites keener for &s;laughter, that they might glut their revenge. It was generally believed, that at this time the &s;overeign was greatly abu&s;ed, and matters were mi&s;repre&s;ented to him, otherwi&s;e he would not have given count|nance to a war, which could have no good effect in its pro&s;ecution, and might i&s;&s;ue in di&s;membering the empire. The friends of the revolution and the Ha|noverian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, could not prevail upon them&s;elves to believe, that a king of the family of Brun&s;wick could be &s;o blind to his own intere&s;t, and that of his people, as to li&s;ten to the coun&s;els of men that were advi&s;ing him to ruin his own family. They at la&s;t had rea&s;on to fear that a great infatuation had &s;eized the moving powers of the body politic, and the head as well as the members, was greatly infected. This
<PB N="472" REF="483">they could only lament; for all the remedies which they tried proved ineffectual. Petitions and remon|&s;trances were con&s;tructed di&s;re&s;pectful to his Maje&s;ty, and in&s;ults to government; and tho&s;e who had ven|tured their lives and fortunes in quelling an actual re|bellion again&s;t the &s;overeign, were accounted di&s;loyal for pleading the cau&s;e of <HI>magna charta</HI> and the <HI>revolu|tion;</HI> while &s;ome who had drawn their &s;words again&s;t their king and the laws, were preferred to high ho|nours, and &s;uffered to ba&s;k in the warm &s;un&s;hine of royal favour. The true lovers of Engli&s;h liberty were &s;tigmatized with the opprobrious names of fac|tious di&s;turbers of the peace, and mock patriots, and venal &s;criblers were privileged to blacken their cau&s;e and abu&s;e their characters. Their oppo&s;ition to vio|lent mea&s;ures, for &s;upporting what at be&s;t was pro|blematical, was termed indirect rebellion; and tho&s;e who had once actually rebelled, were loude&s;t in the cry again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The policy of the mini&s;try at this time was as un|&s;ucce&s;sful as it was ab&s;urd in its principles; the Ca|nada bill, which is commonly called the Quebec act, operated in a manner directly oppo&s;ite to its fir&s;t and true intention. Its pernicious con&s;equences were now di&s;plaid in a manner and degree beyond what its mo&s;t &s;anguine oppo&s;ers ever imagined could happen. In|&s;tead of gaining the French Canadians to the inte|re&s;ts of government, by this ab&s;urd and incon&s;i&s;tent law the mini&s;try lo&s;t their affections, and they were found as much aver&s;e to this act, and as much di&s;gu&s;t|ed at its operations as the Briti&s;h &s;ettlers. General Carleton, the governor of this province, who had placed much confidence in the rai&s;ing a con&s;iderable army of Canadians, and being enabled to march at
<PB N="473" REF="484">their head to the relief of General Gage, found him|&s;elf &s;adly di&s;appointed; for tho' government relied much upon the hope of this manoeuvre, and had &s;ent 20,000 &s;tands of arms, and a great quantity of milita|ry &s;tores for this wi&s;e and gracious purpo&s;e, the Canadians were not di&s;po&s;ed to make any u&s;e of them. The people &s;aid they were now under the Briti&s;h go|vernment; that they could not pretend to under&s;tand the cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent di&s;putes, nor the ju&s;tice of the claims on either &s;ide; that they did and would &s;hew them&s;elves dutiful &s;ubjects, by a quiet and peace|able demeaner, and due obedience to the government under which they were placed; but that if was to|tally incon&s;i&s;tent with their pre&s;ent &s;tate and condi|tion, to interfere, or in any degree render them&s;elves parties in the conte&s;t that might ari&s;e between the go|vernment and its ancient &s;ubjects. The governor i&s;|&s;ued a proclamation for a&s;&s;embling the militia, and for the execution of the martial law, but it was in vain, for it produced no effect: they &s;aid they would defend the province if it was attacked; but they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to march out of it, or to commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t their neighbours. When all earthly argu|ments failed, the governor had recour&s;e to &s;piritual injunctions. He applied to the Bi&s;hop of Quebec to u&s;e his &s;piritual authority and influence with the peo|ple towards di&s;po&s;ing them to the adoption of this fa|vourable mea&s;ure, and particularly that he would i&s;|&s;ue an epi&s;copal mandate to be read in all the pari&s;h churches, by the prie&s;ts, in the time of divine &s;ervice;&mdash;but the Bi&s;hop excu&s;ed him&s;elf from a compliance with this propo&s;ition, by repre&s;enting, that an epi&s;co|pal mandate on &s;uch a &s;ubject would be contrary to the canons of the church of Rome. The eccle&s;ia&s;|tics,
<PB N="474" REF="485">in the place of this, i&s;&s;ued pa&s;toral letters which al|mo&s;t were generally di&s;regarded. The noble&s;&s;e alone, who were chiefly con&s;idered in the Quebec act, &s;hew|ed a zeal again&s;t the Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts; but as they &s;tood &s;eparated from the great body of the people, they &s;hewed no formidable degree of &s;trength. The&s;e proceedings fully &s;hew the real intention of this po|pi&s;h, ab&s;urd, and uncon&s;titutional law; that it was formed with no other de&s;ign than to make popery, as far as its profe&s;&s;ors would comply with the orders of &s;tate, &s;ub&s;ervient to arbitrary government. It was by no means to ea&s;e the con&s;ciences of catholics, nor to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of their religion, nor tho&s;e of any other form of godline&s;s, but to &s;erve the ends of the mini&s;ter in &s;ubduing and en&s;laving the colonies.&mdash;The catholics in Canada perceived the de&s;ign, and were far from thanking government for the new fa|vour that was pretended to be conferred upon them; they de&s;pi&s;ed the idea, and inferred, that government would make the &s;ame u&s;e of all religions to &s;erve the ends of their ambition. This was &s;uch a coar&s;e &s;pun thread of human policy, that it was ea&s;ily perceived by every eye, and the mini&s;try greatly expo&s;ed both their weakne&s;s and malice in fabricating &s;uch an ab|&s;urd law. It will in &s;ome after ages be con&s;idered as a &s;trange political phaenomonon, to find that a Briti&s;h parliament &s;hould have given fanction to a law &s;o ex|ceedingly contrary to the con&s;titution of the empire. As this act was publicly complained of, and expo|&s;ed in the &s;everal publications, the friends of the mini|&s;try &s;et their hirelings to work to defend it; that if they could not altogether lick it into the form of truth, they might as far as was po&s;&s;ible conceal, or varni&s;h its deformity. His Maje&s;ty's promi&s;e in his
<PB N="475" REF="486">declaration at the peace 1763 was in&s;i&s;ted upon as a rea&s;on for this new law; but it was affirmed that there was a wide difference between the promi&s;e of per|mitting the free exerci&s;e of any religion, and ingraft|ing it upon the &s;tates as a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment: that the government had now e&s;tabli&s;hed popery, and left the prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of the empire no more than a precarious toleration, depending upon his Maje&s;ty's will and plea&s;ure, while popery was not only &s;ecured by law, but its clergy &s;upported by the authority of parliament. This bill, like many other things which proceed from evil principles and &s;prings of action, neither an&s;wered the de&s;ign of the contrivers, nor plea&s;ed any party that was concerned in it.</P>
<P>This endeavour, which was expected to have great efficacy, not &s;ucceeding according to the wi&s;hes of the contrivers, the mini&s;try proeeded to another, equally ab&s;urd, cruel, and pernicious. Agents were employ|ed who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have influence among the Indian tribes, which border upon the back &s;ettle|ments of the colonies, to &s;tir them up to war, and make them fall upon the coloni&s;ts with that fury that is peculiar to them when they engage.&mdash;But neither pre&s;ents nor per&s;ua&s;ions were capable of pro|ducing this effect. From whatever cau&s;e it proceed|ed, tho&s;e &s;avage warriors, who had at other times been ready to take up the hatchet, without &s;up|port or encouragement, now turned a deaf ear to all propo&s;als and &s;olicitations, and declared for a neutra|lity. They u&s;ed much the &s;ame rea&s;ons that the Ca|nadians had done: they &s;aid, they did not under&s;tand the &s;ubject, and were &s;orry for the pre&s;ent unfortu|nate di&s;putes; but it was not fit nor becoming for them to take any part in quarrels between Engli&s;h|men,
<PB N="476" REF="487">for all of whom, on both &s;ides of the water, they had a great affection. This reply might have been &s;ufficent to have made an impre&s;&s;ion upon con|&s;ciences that were not altogether hardened;&mdash;it was a plain te&s;timony that the Indians did not imagine that the claims of the mini&s;try were a &s;ufficient foundation for war, and that the di&s;pute ought not to have been determined by the &s;word. The congre&s;s on this oc|ca&s;ion did not neglect their own intere&s;t, nor lo&s;e an opportunity of &s;o much con&s;equence to their cau&s;e;&mdash;they accordingly employed proper per&s;ons to cultivate the favourable opinion of the Indians, and by degrees took &s;uch mea&s;ures as made the agents for government think it proper to provide for their own &s;afety. It is &s;aid that &s;ome of the Indians made propo&s;als to take up arms on the other &s;ide; but the coloni&s;ts only reque&s;ted them to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neu|trality. Candour mu&s;t oblige an hi&s;torian to confe&s;s that this was a very different temper from that of the mini&s;try, who wanted the Indians by all means to fall upon the coloni&s;ts: it would have had &s;ome appear|ance of rea&s;on for the coloni&s;ts to have de&s;ired the In|dians to have taken up the hatchet, becau&s;e the government had &s;hewn an intention to employ them in that manner; for it could only have been account|ed &s;elf-defence to have made u&s;e of their enemies in|&s;truments again&s;t them. But this they did not do, which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a wi&s;e and prudent part of their conduct. It is a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable ta&s;k in go|ing over this part of our hi&s;tory, to be obliged to de|termine in many in&s;tances again&s;t the conduct of our government,&mdash;which in former times has been &s;o re|markable for ju&s;tice, mercy, and benevolence. Ge|neral Gage's late proclamation tended much to in|crea&s;e
<PB N="477" REF="488">the animo&s;ity, indignation, and rage, which were already &s;o prevalent in the colonies; and brought forth a declaration from the congre&s;s, which in the nature of the&s;e appeals that are made to mankind, as well as Heaven, in a declaration of war, &s;et forth the cau&s;es and nece&s;&s;ity of their taking up arms. Among the long li&s;t of the cau&s;es which they offer, be&s;ides the late ho&s;tilities, they &s;tate endeavours u&s;ed to &s;tir up the Indians and Canadians to attack them, and &s;e|verely reproach General Gage for what they call his perfidy, cruelty, and breach of faith, in breaking the conditions which he had engaged to ob&s;erve with the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton; they al&s;o freely cen&s;ure the army, whom they charge with the burning of Charle&s;|town wantonly and unnece&s;&s;arily.</P>
<P>When they &s;tat their re&s;ources, they con&s;ider fo|reign a&s;&s;i&s;tance as undoubtedly attainable if it were nece&s;&s;ary. They however &s;ay, that le&s;t this declara|tion &s;hould di&s;quiet the minds of their friends and fel|low &s;ubjects in any part of the empire, they a&s;&s;ure them that they meant not to di&s;&s;olve that happy union which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, and which they earne&s;ty wi&s;hed to &s;ee re&s;tored: that nece&s;&s;ity had not yet driven them to that de&s;perate mea&s;ure, or induced them to excite any other nation to war again&s;t them; they had not rai&s;ed armies with ambitious de|&s;igns of &s;eparating from Great Britain, and e&s;tabli&s;hing independent &s;tates; they fought not for conque&s;t or glory.&mdash;This declaration was read with great &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s, and even religious &s;olemnity to the different bodies of the army who were encamped around Bo&s;|ton, and was received by them with loud acclamations of applau&s;e and approbation.</P>
<P>This declaration was followed by an addre&s;s to the
<PB N="478" REF="489">inhabitants of Great Britain; another to the people of Ireland; and a petition to the King. All the&s;e writings were drawn up in a very ma&s;terly manner, and in re&s;pect to art, addre&s;s, and execution, equal to any public declarations made by any powers, upon the greate&s;t occa&s;ions. The congre&s;s had in their decla|ration, without mentioning it particularly, reprobated the principles of Lord North's conciliatory propo&s;i|tion, which they called an in&s;idious manoeuvre, adopted by parliament. They &s;ometime afterwards took the re&s;olution more formally into con&s;ideration. It had been communicated to them by direction, or at lea&s;t by permi&s;&s;ion of the mini&s;ter, in the hand writing of Sir Grey Cowper, one of the two principal &s;ecreta|ries of the trea&s;ury. In the cour&s;e of a long and ar|gumentative di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, they condemn it as unrea&s;on|able and in&s;idious: that it is unrea&s;onable, becau&s;e, if they declare they will acccede to it, they declare without re&s;ervation, that they will purcha&s;e the favor of parliament, not knowing at the &s;ame time at what price they will e&s;timate their favour: that it is in&s;idi|ous, becau&s;e, individual colonies having bid and bid|den again, till they find the avidity of the &s;eller too great for all their powers to &s;atisfy, are then to turn into oppo&s;ition divided from their &s;i&s;ter colonies, whom the mini&s;ter will have previou&s;ly detached by a grant of ea&s;ier terms, or by an artful procra&s;tination of a defen&s;ive treaty. They conclude upon the whole, that the propo&s;ition was held up to the world to de|ceive it into a belief, that there was nothing in di&s;|pute except the <HI>mode</HI> of levying taxes; and that par|liament having now been &s;o good as to give up that, the colonies mu&s;t have been unrea&s;onable in the high|e&s;t degree if they were not perfectly &s;atisfied.</P>

<P>The colony of Georgia at length joined in the ge|neral alliance. A provincial congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled in the beginning of the month of July, which &s;peedily agreed to all the re&s;olutions of the two general congre&s;&s;es, in the utmo&s;t extent, and appointed five delegates to at|tend the pre&s;ent. To make an amends for their de|lay, they entered to all the &s;pirit of the re&s;olutions formed by the other colonies, and adopted &s;imilar ones, and declared, that tho' their province was not included in any of the oppre&s;&s;ive acts lately pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Ame|rica, they con&s;idered that circum&s;tance as an in&s;ult ra|ther than a favour, as being done only with a view to divide them from their American brethren. They al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed a petition, under the title of an humble petition and addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, which however trite the &s;ubject was now become, was not deficient in a certain fre&s;hne&s;s of colouring, which gave it the ap|pearance of novelty. Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of this pro|vince, the coloni&s;ts a&s;&s;umed after this period the appella|tion of The <HI>Thirteen United Colonies.</HI> Such was the progre&s;s of the general &s;pirit of liberty, which we at home called rebellion, that it &s;urmounted difficulties of the mo&s;t grievous nature, and produced &s;uch an union among the colonies, which few would have expected to have happened for &s;ome ages to come.</P>
<P>The general congre&s;s, in compliance with the ge|neral wi&s;hes of the people, and the particular appli|cation of the New England provinces, appointed George Wa&s;hington, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a gentleman of affluent fortune in Virginia, and who had acquired con&s;ider|able military experience in the la&s;t war, to be general and commander in chief of all the American forces.&mdash;They al&s;o appointed Artemus Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler, and I&s;rael Putnam, to be major gene|rals;
<PB N="480" REF="492">and Horatio Gates, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> adjutant-general.&mdash;The congre&s;s al&s;o fixed and appointed the pay of both officers and &s;oldiers; the latter of which were much better provided for than tho&s;e upon our e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.</P>
<P>About the beginning of July, the generals Wa&s;h|ington and Lee arrived at the camp before Bo&s;ton, who were treated with the greate&s;t honours in all places thro's which they pa&s;&s;ed. They were e&s;corted by large detachments of volunteers, compo&s;ed of gen|tlemen in the different provinces; and received ad|dre&s;&s;es from the provincial congre&s;&s;es of New-York and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay. The military &s;pirit and di&s;|po&s;ition were now &s;o high and general, that war and military preparations employed the minds and hands of all orders of people throughout the continent.&mdash;Men of the highe&s;t rank and fortunes, who were not appointed to public offices in the army, entered chear|fully as private men, and &s;erved as volunteers in the ranks. Many of the younger quakers, that peacea|ble and inoffen&s;ive denomination of Chri&s;tians, when they &s;aw their rights and liberties at &s;take, forgot their pa&s;&s;ive principles of forbearance and non-re&s;i&s;t|ance, took up arms, and formed them&s;elves into com|panies at Philadelphia, and applied with a&s;&s;iduity to &s;tudy the military exerci&s;e and di&s;cipline. It was reported, though not with any degree of certainty, that there were no fewer than 200,000 men in arms and train|ing this year, throughout the continent of America.</P>
<P>Bo&s;ton continued to be &s;hut up by the provincial troops, and matters continued much in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation, all the re&s;t of this year and a con&s;iderable part of the next: the king's forces and the remaining inha|bitants &s;uffered prodigiou&s;ly by fevers, fluxes, and the
<PB N="481" REF="493">&s;curvy, brought on thro' confinement, heat of wea|ther, and bad provi&s;ions. Some things which were begun this year in Canada will fall more properly un|der the hi&s;tory of the tran&s;actions of the following year, which &s;hall be con&s;idered after we have fini&s;h|ed the political hi&s;tory of this year.&mdash;The mini&s;try, notwith&s;tanding their zeal in pur&s;uing mea&s;ures to bring the coloni&s;ts to &s;ubjection, &s;hewed a real want of &s;y&s;tem and de&s;ign in their whole proceedings.&mdash;Tho' they &s;aw the oppo&s;ition in the colonies every day gathering &s;trength, and encrea&s;ing in force, they &s;eemed not to regard it, but formed their e&s;timate wholly upon a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. The land-tax was continued at three &s;hillings in the pound, and no vote of credit was required: the army remained upon its former footing, and a reduction was made of 4000 &s;eamen, only 16,000 being required for the en&s;uing year. This had the appearance of great incon&s;i&s;ten|cy; for as the &s;peech from the throne announced the American affairs to be in a mo&s;t critical and alarming &s;ituation, and &s;eemed to call for the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures, yet in appearance there was nothing but &s;upinene&s;s and want of attention prevailing upon the conduct of government. It was &s;aid by the oppo&s;ition that this was only a mini&s;terial &s;tratagem to form e|&s;timates which were de&s;igned for no other purpo&s;e than to wa&s;te paper, but was never intended to be pur&s;ued; that under colour of this, the hou&s;e would be &s;urpri&s;ed and driven into grants of an enormous nature. That it was fit the mini&s;try &s;hould explain their real intention, that gentlemen might be able to inform their con&s;tituents concerning what future bur|dens were to be impo&s;ed, or whether compul&s;ive mea|&s;ures were intended again&s;t America; for that to talk
<PB N="482" REF="494">of inforcing acts upon a reduced e&s;tabli&s;hment, either naval or military, was a &s;ort of language only fit to amu&s;e children. It had undoubtedly the appearance of great incon&s;i&s;tency to pretend to dimini&s;h the &s;ea forces, when the king's &s;peech declared that the affairs in America were in a critical and dangerous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The conduct of the mini&s;try was greatly complain|ed of on this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e when they were lead|ing the nation into war, they were taking every &s;tep they could to make that war ruinous, by neglecting tho&s;e preparations that were nece&s;ary for carrying it on with honour and &s;ucce&s;s. That they would nei|ther make peace by making rea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions, nor war by any vigorous military arrangements; but fluctuating between both, deprived the nation of a po&s;|&s;ibility of deriving benefit from either. It was &s;aid, that this delay was &s;o far from &s;aving any thing for the public, that it would increa&s;e the future expence which the nation would a&s;&s;uredly feel in due time.&mdash;The oppo&s;ition &s;aid they were far from de&s;iring war, and as far from de&s;iring large peace e&s;tabli&s;hments; but if again&s;t their will, war mu&s;t be carried on, that common &s;en&s;e dictated that it ought to be carried on with effect; and that if a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, and e|ven lower than a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, was &s;ufficient to &s;upport a war, this was a demon&s;trative proof that the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment had been &s;hamefully prodigal, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the nation profu&s;ely wa&s;ted.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this charge, the mini&s;ter of the naval department publicly a&s;&s;erted in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that he knew the low e&s;tabli&s;hment propo&s;ed, would be fully &s;ufficient for reducing the colonies to obedi|ence. He &s;poke with great contempt of the Ameri|cans, and &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e both their power and
<PB N="483" REF="493">courage. He affirmed that they were not di&s;ciplin|ed, nor capable of di&s;cipline, and that formed of &s;uch materials, and &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed to action, the numbers of which &s;uch boa&s;ts had been made, would only add to the facility of their defeat.&mdash;From what has been &s;hewn above, in the affairs of Lexington and Bunkers-hill, we may &s;ee how ill informed this mini&s;ter of &s;tate was concerning the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the coloni&s;ts. He &s;eemed to affirm a real fal&s;hood by de|claring he knew what he did not know, and what ex|perience has fully proved was in no re&s;pects the truth. It appears exceedingly &s;trange to hone&s;t men, to hear per&s;ons in &s;uch exalted &s;tations of life, &s;o far degrad|ing their characters, as to expo&s;e their own ignorance and folly in &s;uch a public manner. A nation is in a very critical &s;ituation when it is under the manage|ment of &s;uch ignorant per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Altho's on the&s;e grounds the e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;tood, or &s;eemed to &s;tand as reduced, the mini&s;ters did not di&s;claim any farther arrangement of a political nature. By being frequently pre&s;&s;ed, &s;ome explanation was drawn out on that &s;ubject in the Hou&s;e of Commons. A member of the Commons called publicly upon the mini&s;ter in that Hou&s;e, to know whether he had any information to lay before them, or any mea&s;ures to propo&s;e concerning America; for if he had not, he thought it the duty of parliament to interpo&s;e, to call for papers, and to proceed on &s;uch information, how|ever defective, as they could obtain. He concluded his &s;peech by totally condemning the mea&s;ures adopt|ed by the late parliament, as equally impolitic and im|practicable; and &s;aid that they never could be pru|dently or effectually carried into execution.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter did not enter into a defence of the
<PB N="484" REF="496">mea&s;ures of the late parliament. He pretended that the &s;ubject required the greate&s;t attention and dili|gence, as being a matter of the greate&s;t con&s;equence ever di&s;puted within the walls, and that he would not agree to condemn mea&s;ures ha&s;tily which had been taken up upon &s;uch weighty motives; that at that time it was impo&s;&s;ible to tell how they might an&s;wer, but that they &s;hould have a fair trial before they were reprobated; and that the wi&s;dom and policy of them could only be known in the event. That he had in|formation which he would lay before the Hou&s;e &s;oon after the hollidays, and that he would adopt the gen|tleman's ideas &s;o far, who had called upon him, as to propo&s;e the appointment of a committee, for taking the affairs of America under con&s;ideration. This delay was the cau&s;e of much altercation, and many &s;evere reflections again&s;t the mini&s;try. To pur&s;ue the debates in parliament on this occa&s;ion, would be both tedious and unintere&s;ting to many of our readers;&mdash;we &s;hall conclude the hi&s;tory of this year by laying in one view before them, the &s;ub&s;tance of all tho&s;e de|bates in the following &s;tate papers.</P>

We can never &s;o far de&s;ert the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in us, as to relinqui&s;h any part of the &s;overeign authority over all your Maje&s;ty's dominions, which, by law, is ve&s;ted in your Maje&s;ty and the two hou&s;es of parliament; and the conduct of many per&s;ons, in &s;everal of the colonies, during the late di&s;turbances, is alone &s;ufficient to convince us how nece&s;&s;ary this power is for the protection of the lives and fortunes of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>We ever have been, and always &s;hall be, ready to pay attention and regard to any real grievances of any of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, which &s;hall, in a duti|ful and con&s;titutional manner, be laid before us; and whenever any of the colonies &s;hall make a proper ap|plication to us, we &s;hall be ready to afford them every ju&s;t and rea&s;onable indulgence: At the &s;ame time, we con&s;ider it as our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty humbly to be&s;eech
<PB N="486" REF="498">your Maje&s;ty, that you will take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature; and we beg leave, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to a&s;&s;ure your Ma|je&s;ty, that it is our fixed re&s;olution, at the hazard of our lives and properties, to &s;tand by your Maje&s;ty, again&s;t all rebellious attempts in the maintenance of the ju&s;t rights of your Maje&s;ty and the two hou&s;es of parliament."</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Prote&s;t of &s;everal of the Lords, on its being re&s;olved in their Hou&s;e, on Tue&s;day, the 7th of February 1775, to put a main que&s;tion, viz. To agree with the Commons in the foregoing addre&s;s, &s;ent by them to their Lord&s;hips for their con|currence, by filling up the blank left in it for that purpo&s;e, with the words, "Lords Spiritual and Temporal;" as likewi&s;e another Prote&s;t of
<PB N="487" REF="499">&s;everal of the Lords, on their Hou&s;e's agreeing with the Commons in the &s;aid Addre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;&s;entient,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The previous que&s;tion was moved, not to pre|vent the proceedings in the addre&s;s communicated at the conferrence with the Commons, but in order to pre&s;ent the petitions of the N. American merchants and of the We&s;t-India merchants and planters, which petitions the Hou&s;e might reject if frivolous, or po&s;t|pone if not urgent, as might &s;eem fit to their wi&s;|dom; but to hurry on the bu&s;ine&s;s to which the&s;e pe|titions &s;o materially and directly related, the expre&s;s prayer of which was, that they might be heard before "any re&s;olution may be taken by this right honoura|ble Hou&s;e re&s;pecting America," to refu&s;e &s;o much as to &s;uffer them to be pre&s;ented, is a proceeding of the mo&s;t unwarrantable nature, and directly &s;ubver&s;ive of the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of the &s;ubject. It is the more particularly exceptionable, as a Lord, in his place, at the expre&s;s de&s;ire of the We&s;t-India merchants, in|formed the Hou&s;e, that if nece&s;&s;iated &s;o to do, they were ready, without coun&s;el, or farther preparation, in&s;tantly to offer evidence to prove, that &s;everal i&s;lands of the We&s;t-Indies could not be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t after the operation of the propo&s;ed addre&s;s in America. Ju&s;|tice, in regard to individuals, policy with regard to the public, and decorum, with regard to our&s;elves, required that we &s;hould admit this petition to be pre|&s;ented. By refu&s;ing it, ju&s;tice is denied.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Becau&s;e the papers laid upon our table by the mini&s;ters, are &s;o manife&s;tively defective, and &s;o avowedly curtailed, that we can derive from them nothing like information of the true &s;tate of the ob|ject on which we are going to act, or of the con&s;e|quences
<PB N="488" REF="500">of the re&s;olutions which we may take. We ought, as we conceive, with gladne&s;s, to have accept|ed that information from the merchants, which if it had not been volutarily offered, it is our duty to &s;eek. There is no information concerning the &s;tate of our colonies (taken in any point of view,) which the merchants are not far more competent to give than governors or officers, who often know far le&s;s of the temper and di&s;po&s;ition, or may be more di&s;|po&s;ed to mi&s;repre&s;ent it than the merchants. Of this we have a full and melancholy experience, in the mi&s;|taken ideas on which the fatal acts of the la&s;t parlia|ment were formed.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Becau&s;e we are of opinion, that in entering into a war, in which mi&s;chief and inconveniences are real and certain (but the utmo&s;t extent of which it is impo&s;&s;ible to for&s;ee) true policy requires that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t likely to be immediately affected, &s;hould be tohroughly &s;atisfied of the deliberation with which it was undertaken: and we apprehend that the planters, merchants, and manufacturers will not bear ther lo&s;&s;es and burthens, brought on them by the propo&s;ed civil war, the better for our refu&s;ing &s;o much as to hear them previous to our engaging in that war; not will our precipitation in re&s;olving, add much to the &s;ucce&s;s in executing any plan that may be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>We prote&s;t therefore again&s;t the refu&s;al to &s;uffer &s;uch petitions to be pre&s;ented, and we thus clear our|&s;elves to our country of the di&s;grace and mi&s;chief, which mu&s;t attend this uncon&s;titutional, indecent, and improvident proceeding.</P>

<P><HI>Di&s;&s;entient,</HI> 1&s;t. Becau&s;e the violent matter of this dangerous addre&s;s was highly aggravated by the violent manner in which it was precipitately hurried through the Hou&s;e. Lords were not allowed the in|terpo&s;ition of a moment's time for deliberation, before they were driven headlong into a declaration of civil war. A conference was held with the Commons, an addre&s;s of this importance pre&s;ented, all extrane|ous information, although offered, po&s;itively refu&s;ed, all petitions arbitrarily rejected, and the whole of this mo&s;t awful bu&s;ine&s;s received, debated, and concluded in a &s;ingle day.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Becau&s;e no legal grounds were laid in argu|ment or in fact, to &s;hew that a rebellion, properly &s;o called, did exi&s;t in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, when the pa|pers of the late&s;t date, and from whence alone we de|rive our information, were written. The overt-acts to which the &s;pecies of trea&s;on affirmed in the addre&s;s ought to be applied, were not e&s;tabli&s;hed, nor any of|fenders to be marked out: but a general ma&s;s of the acts of turbulence, &s;aid to be done at various times and places, and of various natures, were all thrown together to make out one general con&s;tructive trea&s;on. Neither was there any &s;ort of proof of the continu|ance
<PB N="490" REF="502">of any unlawful force, from whence we could infer that a rebellion does now exi&s;t. And we are the more cautious of pronouncing any part of his Ma|je&s;ty's dominions in actual rebellion, becau&s;e the ca|&s;es of con&s;tructive trea&s;on, under that branch of the 25th of Edward the Third, which de&s;cribes the crime of rebellion, have been already &s;o far extended by the judges, and the di&s;tinctions upon it &s;o nice and &s;ubtle, that no prudent man ought to declare any &s;ingle per|&s;on in that &s;ituation, without the cleare&s;t evidence of the uncontrovertible overt-acts, to warrant &s;uch a de|claration. Much le&s;s ought &s;o high an authority as both hou&s;es of parliament, to denounce &s;o &s;evere, a judgment again&s;t a con&s;iderable part of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, by which his forces may think them&s;elves ju&s;|tified in commencing a war without any further order or commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Becau&s;e we think that &s;everal acts of the late parliament, and &s;everal late proceedings of admi|ni&s;tration with regard to the colonies, are real griev|ances, and ju&s;t cau&s;es of complaint; and, we cannot, in honour, or in con&s;cience, con&s;ent to an addre&s;s which commends the temper by which proceedings &s;o very intemperate, have been carried on; nor can we per&s;uade our&s;elves to authorize violent cour&s;es a|gain&s;t per&s;ons in the colonies who have re&s;i&s;ted au|thority, without, at the &s;ame time, redre&s;&s;ing the grievances which have given but too much provoca|tion for their behaviour.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Becau&s;e we think the loo&s;e and general a&s;|&s;urances given by the addre&s;s, of future redre&s;s of grievances, in ca&s;e of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, is far from &s;atisfac|tory, or at all likely to produce their end, whil&s;t the acts complained of continue unrepealed, or unamend|ed.,
<PB N="491" REF="503">and their authors remain in authority here, be|cau&s;e the&s;e advi&s;ers of all the mea&s;ures which have brought on the calamities of this empire, will not be tru&s;ted whil&s;t they defend as ju&s;t, nece&s;&s;ary, and even indulgent, all the acts complained of as grievances by the Americans; and mu&s;t, therefore, on their own principles, be bound in future to govern the colonies in the manner which has already produced &s;uch fatal effects; and we fear that the refu&s;al of this Hou&s;e &s;o much as to receive, previous to determination (which is the mo&s;t offen&s;ive mode of rejection) petitions from the unoffending natives of Great Britain, and the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, affords but a very di&s;couraging pro&s;pect of our obtaining hereafter any petitions at all from tho&s;e whom we have declared actors in re|bellion, or abettors of that crime.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Becau&s;e the means of enforcing the author|ity of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, is confided to per&s;ons of who&s;e capacity, for that purpo&s;e, from abundant expe|rience, we have rea&s;on to doubt; and who have hi|therto u&s;ed no effectual means of conciliating or of reducing tho&s;e who oppo&s;e that authority:&mdash;this ap|pears in the con&s;tant failure of all their projects, the in&s;ufficiency of all their information, and the di&s;ap|pointment of all the hopes, which they have for &s;e|veral years held out to the public. Parliament has never refu&s;ed any of their propo&s;als, and yet our af|fairs have proceed daily from bad to wor&s;e, until we have been brought, &s;tep by &s;tep, to that &s;tate of con|fu&s;ion, and even civil violence, which was the natural re&s;ult of the&s;e de&s;perate mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>We therefore prote&s;t again&s;t an addre&s;s amounting to a declaration of war, which is founded on no pro|per parliamentary information; which was introdu|ced
<PB N="492" REF="504">by refu&s;ing to &s;uffer the pre&s;entation of petitions again&s;t it, (although it be the undoubted right of the &s;ubject to pre&s;ent the &s;ame) which followed the rejec|tion of every mode of conciliation; which holds out no &s;ub&s;tantial offer of redre&s;s of grievances; and which promi&s;es &s;upport to tho&s;e mini&s;ters who have inflamed America, and gro&s;ly mi&s;conducted the affairs of Great Britain.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sheweth,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"THAT although your petitioners bear all due re&s;pect to the policy of tho&s;e acts of parliament, which have anciently pre&s;erved Great Britain a nece&s;&s;ary and beneficial commerce with our colonies, yet they are exceedingly alarmed at the con&s;equences that mu&s;t en&s;ue, if the bill now depending in this honourable hou&s;e &s;hould pa&s;s into a law, entitled, "A bill to re|&s;train the trade and commerce of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay and New Hamp&s;hire, and colonies of Connecticut and Rhode I&s;land, and Providence Plantations in North America, to Great Britain, Ireland, and the Briti&s;h i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies, and to prohibit &s;uch pro|vinces and colonies from carrying on any fi&s;hery on the banks of Newfoundland, or other places there|in to be mentioned, under certain conditions, and for a time to be limited;" the &s;aid bill, as your petition|ers conceive, being unju&s;tly founded, becau&s;e it in|volves the whole in the puni&s;hment intended for the &s;uppo&s;ed offences of a few.</P>
<P>"That it mu&s;t, in its con&s;equences, overwhelm thou&s;ands of his Maje&s;ty's loyal and u&s;eful &s;ubjects with the utmo&s;t poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, ina&s;much as they will be thereby deprived of the fi&s;heries, which are the natural means of &s;upporting them&s;elves and fami|lies.</P>
<P>"That the exten&s;ive commerce between Great-Britain and her colonies will, by this bill, be greatly injured, as a capital &s;ource of remittance will be &s;topt,
<PB N="494" REF="506">which will not only di&s;connect the future commercial intercour&s;e between tho&s;e colonies and this country, but will eventually render them incapable of paying the large debts already due to the merchants of this city,</P>
<P>"That the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion will probably en&s;ue from enforcing this bill, if it is pa&s;&s;ed into a law, as it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that a great number of men, na|turally hardy and brave, will quietly &s;ubmit to a law which will reduce them almo&s;t to famine, they not having within them&s;elves provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>"That it will induce the French to extend their fii&s;heries, and by that means increa&s;e the wealth and &s;trength of our rivals in trade, to the great prejudice of this country.</P>
<P>"That your petitioners feel for the many hard|&s;hips which their fellow-&s;ubjects in America already labour under, from the execution of &s;everal late acts of parliament, evidently partial and oppre&s;&s;ive; and which &s;eem to be extended and continued by this bill; ina&s;much as it confirms tho&s;e acts, which in par|ticular ca&s;es deprive the American &s;ubject of trial by jury, prohibit the Americans from carrying provi&s;ions from one colony to another, invite a contraband trade under military protection, prevent any &s;ubject of Great Britain or Ireland from being part owner of cer|tain American &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els, and ve&s;t an undue and dangerous authority in the governor and council of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay.</P>

<P>ARTICLE I.</P>
<P>The name of the confederacy &s;hall henceforth be, The United Colonies of North America.</P>
<P N="2">II. The united colonies hereby &s;everally enter in|to a firm league of friend&s;hip with each other, bind|ing on them&s;elves and their po&s;terity, for their com|mon defence again&s;t their enemies, for the &s;ecurity of their liberties and properties, the &s;afety of their per&s;ons and families, and their mutual and general welfare.</P>
<P N="3">III. That each colony &s;hall enjoy and retain as much as it may think fit of its own pre&s;ent laws, cu&s;|toms, rights, privileges, and peculiar juri&s;dictions, within its own limits; and may amend its own con&s;ti|tution, as &s;hall &s;eem be&s;t to its own a&s;&s;embly or con|vention.</P>

Only where particular circum|&s;tances do not make a deviation nece&s;&s;ary, it is under|&s;tood to be a rule, that each &s;ucceeding congre&s;s is to be held in a different colony, till the whole number be gone through, and &s;o in perpetual rotation; and that accordingly, the next congre&s;s after the pre&s;ent &s;hall be held at Annapolis, in Maryland.</P>
<P N="5">V. That the power and duty of the congre&s;s &s;hall extend to the determining on war and peace,
<PB N="496" REF="508">the entering into alliances, the reconciliation with G. Britain, the &s;ettling all di&s;putes between colony and colony, if any &s;hould ari&s;e, and the planting new co|lonies where proper. The Congre&s;s &s;hall al&s;o make &s;uch general ordinances thought nece&s;&s;ary to the ge|neral welfare, of which particular a&s;&s;emblies cannot be competent, viz. tho&s;e that may relate to our ge|neral commerce or general currency, to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of po&s;ts, the regulation of our common forces; the congre&s;s &s;hall al&s;o have the appointment of all of|ficers civil and military, appertaining to the general confederacy,&mdash;&s;uch as general trea&s;urer, &s;ecretary, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">VI. All charges of war, and all other general ex|pences to be incurred for the common welfare, &s;hall be defrayed out of a common trea&s;ury, which is to be &s;upplied by each colony, in proportion to its num|ber of male polls between 16 and 60 years of age; the taxes for paying that proportion are to be laid and levied by the laws of each colony.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The number of delegates to be elected, and &s;ent to the congre&s;s by each colony, &s;hall be regulated from time to time, by the number of &s;uch polls re|turned; &s;o as that one delegates are to bring with them to every congre&s;s an authenticated return of the number of polls in their re&s;pective colonies, which is to be taken for the purpo&s;es above-mentioned.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. At every meeting of the congre&s;s, one half of the members returned, exclu&s;ive of the proxies, &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to make a quorum; and each dele|gate at the congre&s;s &s;hall have a vote in all ca&s;es; and if nece&s;&s;arily ab&s;ent, &s;hall be allowed to appoint any other delegate from the &s;ame colony to be his proxy, who may vote for him.</P>

<P N="9">IX. An executive council &s;hall be appointed by the congre&s;s out of their own body, con&s;i&s;ting of 12 per&s;ons, of whom in the fir&s;t appointment one-third, viz. four, &s;hall be for one year, four for two years, and four for three years; and as the &s;aid terms ex|pire, the vacancies &s;hall be filled up by appointments for three years, whereby one-third of the members will be cho&s;en annually; and each per&s;on who has &s;erved the &s;ame term of three years as coun&s;ellor, &s;hall have a re&s;pite of three years, before he can be elected again. This council, of whom two-thirds &s;hall be a quorum, in the rece&s;s of the congre&s;s is to exe|cute what &s;hall have been enjoined thereby; to ma|nage the general continental bu&s;ine&s;s and intere&s;ts, to receive applications from foreign countries, to pre|pare matters for the con&s;ideration of the congre&s;s, to fill up, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> continental offices that fall vacant, and to draw on the general trea&s;urer for &s;uch monies as may be nece&s;&s;ary for general &s;ervices, and appro|priated by the congre&s;s to &s;uch &s;ervices.</P>
<P N="10">X. No colony &s;hall engage in an offen&s;ive war with any nation of Indians, without the con&s;ent of the con|gre&s;s or great council above mentioned, who are fir&s;t to con&s;ider the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch war.</P>
<P N="11">XI. A perpetual alliance, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, is to be entered into, as &s;oon as may be, with the &s;ix nations; their limits a&s;certained and &s;ecured to them; their lands not to be encroached on, nor any private or colony purcha&s;e to be made of them hereafter to be be held good, nor any contract for lands to be made, but between the great Council of the Indians at Onondega and the general congre&s;s. The bound|aries and lands of all the other Indians &s;hall al&s;o be a&s;|certained and &s;ecured to them in the &s;ame manner;
<PB N="498" REF="510">and per&s;ons appointed to re&s;ide among them in pro|per di&s;tricts, who &s;hall take care to prevent inju&s;tice in the trade with them; and be enabled at our general expence, by occa&s;ional &s;mall &s;upplies, to relieve their per&s;onal wants and di&s;ttre&s;&s;es; and all purcha&s;es from them &s;hall be by the congre&s;s, for the general advan|tage and benefit of the united colonies.</P>
<P N="12">XII. As all new in&s;titutions may have imperfec|tions, which only time and experience can di&s;cover, it is agreed that the general congre&s;s, from time to time, &s;hall propo&s;e &s;uch amendments of this con&s;titu|tion, as may be found nece&s;&s;ary, which being appro|ved by a majority of the colony a&s;&s;emblies, &s;hall be equally binding with the re&s;t of the articles of this confederation.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Any and every colony from Great Britain upon the continent of North America, not at pre&s;ent engaged in our a&s;&s;ociation, may, upon application, and joining the &s;aid a&s;&s;ociation, be received into the confederation, viz. Quebec, St. John's, Nova-Scotia, Bermudas, and the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Floridas, and &s;hall thereupon be entitled to all the advantages of our union, mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and commerce.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles &s;hall be propo&s;ed to the &s;everal pro|vincial conventions or a&s;&s;emblies, to be by them con|&s;idered; and if approved, they are advi&s;ed to em|power their delegates to agree and ratify the &s;ame in the en&s;uing congre&s;s; after which the union thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed is to continue firm, till the terms of recon|ciliation propo&s;ed in the petition of the la&s;t congre&s;s to the king are agreed to; till the acts, &s;ince made, re&s;training the American commerce and fi&s;heries, are repealed; till reparation is made for the injuries done to Bo&s;ton by &s;hutting up its port; for burning Charle&s;|town,
<PB N="499" REF="511">and for the expence of this unju&s;t war; and till all the Briti&s;h troops are withdrawn from Ameri|ca. On the arrival of the&s;e events, the colonies are to return to their former connections and friend&s;hip with Great Britain; but on failure thereof, this con|federation is to be perpetual.</P>
<P>WHEREAS it hath plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s the&s;e countries with a mo&s;t plentiful harve&s;t, whereby much corn and other provi&s;ions can be &s;pared to foreign nations who may want the &s;ame:</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That after the expiration of &s;ix months, from the 20th of July in&s;t. being the day appointed by a late act of parliament of Great Britain, for re|&s;training the trade of the confederate colonies, all cu&s;tom-hou&s;es therein (if the &s;aid act be not fir&s;t re|pealed) &s;hall be &s;hut up, and all the officers of the &s;ame di&s;charged from the execution of their &s;everal func|tions; and all the ports of the &s;aid colonies are here|by declared to be thenceforth open to the &s;hips of every &s;tate in Europe that will admit our commerce, and protect it, who may bring in and expo&s;e to &s;ale, free of all duties, their re&s;pective produce and manu|factures, and every kind of merchandize, excepting teas, and the merchandize of Great Britain, Ireland, and the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That we will, to the utmo&s;t of our pow|er, maintain and &s;upport this freedom of commerce for two years certain after its commencement, any re|conciliation between us and Great Britain notwith|&s;tanding, and as much longer beyond that term as the late acts of parliament for re&s;training the commerce and fi&s;heries, and di&s;allowing the laws and charters of any of the colonies, &s;hall continue unrepealed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"Mo&s;t gracious Sovereign,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t loyal and dutiful &s;ubjects, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the ci|ty of London, in common council a&s;&s;embled, with all humility beg leave to lay them&s;elves at your royal feet, humbly imploring your benign attention towards the grievous di&s;tractions of their fellow-&s;ubjects in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tic of the people, Sire, over whom you reign, has ever been equally remarked for their unparalleled loyalty to their Sovereign, whil&s;t the prin|ciples of the con&s;titution have been the rule of his government, as well as a firm oppo&s;ition whenever their rights have been invaded.</P>
<P>Your American &s;ubjects, Royal Sire, de&s;cended from the &s;ame ance&s;ters with our&s;elves, appear equal|ly jealous of the prerogatives of freemen,&mdash;without which they cannot deem them&s;elves happy.</P>
<P>Their chearful and una&s;ked for contributions, as well as willing &s;ervices to the mother-country, whil&s;t they remained free from the clog of compul&s;ory laws, will, we are &s;ure, plead powerfully with the human|ity of your di&s;po&s;ition, for graciou&s;ly granting them every rea&s;onable opportunity of giving, as freemen, what they &s;eem re&s;olutely determined to refu&s;e under the injunction of laws made independent of their own con&s;ent.</P>

<P>The abhorrence we entertain of civil blood&s;hed and confu&s;ion will, we tru&s;t, Sire, if not wholly exculpate us in your royal mind, yet plead powerfully in our fa|vour, for the warmth with which we lament tho&s;e mea&s;ures, who&s;e de&s;tructive principles have driven our American brethren to acts of de&s;peration.</P>
<P>Convinced of the earne&s;t di&s;po&s;ition of the coloni&s;ts to remain firm in all duteous obedience to the con&s;titu|tional authority of this kingdom, permit us, mo&s;t gra|cious &s;overeign, to be&s;eech you that tho&s;e operations of force, which at pre&s;ent di&s;tract them with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions, may be &s;u&s;pended; and that, uncontrouled by a re&s;traint incompatible with a free government, they may po&s;&s;e&s;s an opportunity of ten|dering &s;uch terms of accomodation, as, we doubt not, will approve them worthy of a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank a|mong the firme&s;t friends of this country."</P>

<P>You have maintained, with a firm and &s;teady re&s;o|lution, the rights of my crown, and the authority of parliament, which I &s;hall ever con&s;ider as in&s;eparable: you have protected and promoted the commercial intere&s;ts of my kingdoms, and you have at the &s;ame time, given convincing proofs of your readine&s;s, as far as the con&s;titution will allow you, to gratify the wi&s;hes, and remove the apprehen&s;ions, of my &s;ubjects in America; and I am per&s;uaded, that the mo&s;t &s;aluta|ry effects mu&s;t, in the end, re&s;ult from mea&s;ures form|ed and conducted on &s;uch principles.</P>

<HEAD>A Decaration by the Repre&s;entatives of the United Colonies of North America, now met in general Congre&s;s at Philadelphia, &s;etting forth the cau&s;es and nece&s;&s;ity of their taking up arms.</HEAD>
<P>IF it were po&s;&s;ible for men, who exerci&s;e their rea|&s;on, to believe that the Divine Author of our exi&s;t|ence intended a part of the human race to hold an ab&s;olute property in, and an unbounded power over others, marked out by his infinite goodne&s;s and wi&s;|dom, as the objects of a legal domination, never right|ly re&s;i&s;table, however &s;evere and oppre&s;&s;ive; the in|habitants of the&s;e colonies might at lea&s;t require from the parliament of Great Britain &s;ome evidence, that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that body. But a reverence for our Great Crea|tor, principles of humanity, and the dictates of com|mon
<PB N="504" REF="518">&s;en&s;e, mu&s;t convince all tho&s;e who reflect upon the &s;ubject, that government was in&s;tituted to pro|mote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be admi|ni&s;tered for the attainment of that end. The legi&s;la|ture of Great Britain, however &s;timulated by an in|ordinate pa&s;&s;ion for a power not only unju&s;tifiable, but which they know to be peculiarly reprobated by the very con&s;titution of that kingdom, and de&s;perate of &s;ucce&s;s in any mode of conte&s;t where regard &s;hould be had to truth, law, or right, have at length, de&s;ert|ing tho&s;e, attempted to effect their cruel and impoli|tic purpo&s;e of en&s;laving the&s;e colonies by violence, and have thereby rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for us to clo&s;e with their la&s;t appeal from rea&s;on to arms. Yet, however blinded that a&s;&s;embly may be, by their in|temperate rage for unlimited domination, &s;o as to &s;light ju&s;tice and the opinion of mankind, we e&s;teem our&s;elves bound, by obligations of re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the world, to make known the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Our forefathers, inhabitants of the i&s;land of Great Britain, left their native land, to &s;eek on the&s;e &s;hores a re&s;idence for civil and religious freedom. At the expence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, without the lea&s;t charge to the country from which they removed, by uncea&s;ing labour and an unconquer|able &s;pirit, they effected &s;ettlements in the di&s;tant and inho&s;pitable wilds of America, then filled with nume|rous and warlike natives of Barbarians. Societies or governments, ve&s;ted with perfect legi&s;latures, were formed under charters from the crown, and an har|monious intercour&s;e was e&s;tabli&s;hed between the co|lonies and the kingdom from which they derived their origin. The mutual benefits of this union be|came in a &s;hort time &s;o extraordinary, as to excite
<PB N="505" REF="517">a&s;toni&s;hment. It is univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed, that the a|mazing increa&s;e of the wealth, &s;trength, and navigation of the realm, aro&s;e from this &s;ource; and the mini$ter, who &s;o wi&s;ely and &s;ucce&s;sfully d$rected the mea|&s;ures of Great Britain in the late war, publicly de|clared that the&s;e colonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies. Towards the conclu&s;ion of that war, it plea&s;ed our Sovereign to make a change in his coun&s;els. From that fatal moment the affairs of the Briti&s;h empire began to fall into confu&s;ion, and, gra|dually &s;liding from the &s;ummit of glorious pro&s;perity, to which they had been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man, are at length di&s;tracted by the convul&s;ions that now &s;hake it to its deepe&s;t founda|tions. The new mini&s;try, finding the brave foes of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet &s;till contend|ing, took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a ha&s;ty peace, and then of &s;ubduing her faithful friends.</P>
<P>The&s;e devoted colonies were judged to be in &s;uch a &s;tate, as to pre&s;ent victories without blood&s;hed, and all the eo&s;y emoluments of &s;tatutable plunder. The uninterrupted tenure of their peaceable and re&s;pectful behaviour, from the beginning of colonization; their dutiful, zealous, and u&s;eful &s;ervices during the war, though &s;o recently and amply acknowledged in the mo&s;t honourable manner by his Maje&s;ty, by the late king, and by parliament; could not &s;ave them from the meditated innovations. Parliament was influen|ced to adopt the pernicieus project, and, a&s;&s;uming a new power over them, have in the cour&s;e of eleven years, given &s;uch decicive &s;pecimens of the &s;pirit and con&s;equences attending this power, as to leave no doubts concerning the effects of acquie&s;cence under it. They have undertaken to give and grant our mo|ney
<PB N="506" REF="518">without our con&s;ent, though we have ever exer|ci&s;ed an exclu&s;ive right to di&s;po&s;e of our own proper|ty. Statutes have been pa&s;&s;ed for extending the ju|ri&s;diction of courts of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty beyond their ancient limits, for depriving us of the accu&s;tomed and ine&s;timable privileges of trial by jury, in ca&s;es affecting both life and property; for &s;u&s;pend|ing the legi&s;lature of one of the colonies; for inter|dicting all commerce of another; and for altering fun|damentally the form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter, and &s;ecured by acts of its own legi&s;lature, &s;o|lemnly confirmed by the crown; for exempting the 'murderers' of coloni&s;ts from legal trial, and, in ef|fect, from puni&s;hment, for erecting in a neigbouring province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Britain and America, a de&s;poti&s;m dangerous to our very exi&s;t|ence; and for quartering &s;oldiers upon the coloni&s;ts in times of profound peace. It has al&s;o been re&s;olved in parliament, that coloni&s;ts, charged with committing certain offences, &s;hall be tran&s;ported to England to be tried.</P>
<P>But &s;hould we enumerate our injuries in detail?&mdash;By one &s;tatute it is declared, that Parliament can 'of right make laws to bind us in all ca&s;es whatever.'&mdash;What is to defend us again&s;t &s;o enormous, &s;o unli|mited a power? Not a &s;ingle man of tho&s;e who a&s;|&s;ume it is cho&s;en by us, or is &s;ubject to our controul, or influence; but, on the contrary, they are all of them exempt from the operation of &s;uch laws; and an American revenue, if not diverted from the o&s;ten|&s;ible purpo&s;es for which it is rai&s;ed, would actually lighten their own burthens, in proportion as they in|crea&s;ed ours. We &s;aw the mi&s;ery to which &s;uch de&s;|poti&s;m would reduce us. We for ten years ince&s;&s;ant|ly
<PB N="507" REF="519">and ineffectually be&s;ieged the throne as &s;upplicants; we rea&s;oned, we remon&s;trated with parliament in the mo&s;t mild and decent language. But admini&s;tration, &s;en&s;ible that we &s;hould regard the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive mea|&s;ures as freemen ought to do, &s;ent over fleets and ar|mies to enforce them. The indignation of the Ame|ricans was rou&s;ed it is true; but it was the indigna|tion of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people. A congre&s;s of delegates from the united colonies was a&s;&s;embled at Philadelphia, on the 5th day of la&s;t Sep|tember. We re&s;olved again to offer an humble and dutiful petition to the King, and al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed our fellow-&s;ubjects of Great Britain. We have pur&s;ued every temperate, every re&s;pectful mea&s;ure; we have even proceeded to break off our commercial inter|cour&s;e with our fellow-&s;ubjects, as the la&s;t peaceable admonition, that our attachment to no nation upon earth would &s;upplant our attachment to liberty.&mdash;This we flatter our&s;elves, was the ultimate &s;tep of the controver&s;y; but &s;ub&s;equent events have &s;hewn how vain was this hope of finding moderation in our ene|mies.</P>
<P>Several threatening expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the colo|nies were in&s;erted in his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech. Our pe|tition, though we are told it was a decent one, that his Maje&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to receive it graciou&s;ly, and to promi&s;e laying it before his parliament, was huddled into both hou&s;es among&s;t a bundle of Ame|rican papers, and there neglected. The Lords and Commons, in their addre&s;s, in the month of February &s;aid,&mdash;'that a rebellion at that time actually exi&s;ted within the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay; and that the&s;e concerned in it had been countenanced and en|couraged by unlawful combinations and engagements,
<PB N="508" REF="520">entered into by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in &s;everal of the other colonies: and therefore they be&s;ought his Ma|je&s;ty that he would take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature.' Soon after the commer|cial intercour&s;e of whole colonies, with foreign coun|tries and with each other, was cut off by an act of par|liament; by another, &s;everal of them were intirely prohibited from the fi&s;heries in the &s;eas near their coa&s;ts, on which they always depended for their &s;u&s;|tenance; and large reinforcements of &s;hips and troops were immediately &s;ent over to General Gage.</P>
<P>Fruitle&s;s were all the intreaties, arguments, and eloquence of an illu&s;trious band, of the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed peers and commoners, who nobly and &s;trenu|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, to &s;tay or even to mitigate the heedle&s;s fury with which the&s;e accu|mulated and unexampled outrages were hurried on &mdash;Equally fruitle&s;s was the interference of the city of London, of Bri&s;tol, and many other re&s;pectable towns in our favour. Parliament adopted an in&s;idious ma|naevure, calculated to divide us, to e&s;tabli&s;h a perpetual auction of taxations, where colony &s;hould bid again&s;t colony, all of whom uninformed what ran&s;om &s;hould redeem their lives; and thus to extort from us at the point of the bayonet the unknown &s;ums that &s;hould be &s;ufficient to gratify, if po&s;&s;ible to gratify, mini&s;te|rial rapacity, with the mi&s;erable indulgence left to us of rai&s;ing in our mode the pre&s;cribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humiliating could have been dic|tated by remor&s;ele&s;s victors to conquered enemies?&mdash;In our circum&s;tances, to accept them would be to de|&s;erve them.</P>
<P>Soon after the intelligence of the&s;e proceedings ar|rived
<PB N="509" REF="521">on this continent, General Gage, who, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town of Bo&s;ton, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, and &s;till occupied it as a garri&s;on, on the 19th of April, &s;ent out from that place a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked a&s;&s;ault on the in|habitants of the &s;aid province, at the town of Lexing|ton, as appears by the affidavits of a great number of per&s;ons, &s;ome of whom were officers and &s;oldiers of that detachment; murdered eight of the inhabitants of the &s;aid province, and wounded many others.&mdash;From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they &s;et upon ano|ther party of the inhabitants of the &s;ame province, kil|ling &s;everal and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country-people &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled to repel this cruel aggre&s;&s;ion. Ho&s;tilities thus commen|ced by the Briti&s;h troops, have been &s;ince pro&s;ecuted by them without regard to faith or reputation. The inhabitants of Bo&s;ton being confined within that town by the General, their Governor; and having, in or|der to procure their admi&s;&s;ion, entered into a treaty with him; it was &s;tipulated that the &s;aid inhabitants, having depo&s;ited their arms with their own magi&s;trates, &s;hould have liberty to depart, taking with them their other effects. They accordingly delivered up their arms; but, in open violation of honour, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even &s;avage nations e&s;teem &s;acred, the Governor ordered the arms depo&s;it|ed as afore&s;aid, that they might be pre&s;erved for their owners to be &s;eized by a body of &s;oldiers; detained by the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few, who were permitted to retire, to leave their mo&s;t valuable effects behind.</P>
<PB N="510" REF="522">
<P>By this perfidy wives are &s;eparated from their hu&s;|bands, children from their parents, the aged and &s;ick from their relations and friends, who wi&s;hed to attend and comfort them; and tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to live in plenty, and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The General further emulating his mini&s;terial ma&s;|ters, by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th day of June, after venting the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;hoods and calum|nies again&s;t the good people of the&s;e colonies, pro|ceeds to 'declare them all, either by name or de&s;crip|tion, to be rebels and traitors, to &s;uper&s;ede the cour&s;e of the common law, and in&s;tead thereof to publi&s;h and order the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of the law martial.'&mdash;His troops have butchered our countrymen; have wan|tonly burnt Charle&s;town, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable num|ber of hou&s;es in other places; our &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els are &s;eized; the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of provi&s;ion are in|tercepted; and he is exerting his utmo&s;t power to &s;pread de&s;truction and deva&s;tation around him.</P>
<P>We have received certain intelligence, that Gene|rel Carleton, the Governor of Canada, is in&s;tigating the people of that province and the Indians to fall upon us; and we have but too much rea&s;on to ap|prehend, that &s;chemes have been formed to excite dome&s;tic enemies among&s;t us. In brief, a part of tho&s;e colonies now feels, and all of them are &s;ure of feeling, as far as the vengeance of admini&s;tration can inflict them, the complicated calamities of fire, &s;word, and famine. We are reduced to the alternative of chu|&s;ing an unconditional &s;umi&s;&s;ion to the tyranny of irri|tated mini&s;ters, or re&s;i&s;tance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the co&s;t of this con|te&s;t, and find nothing &s;o dreadful as voluntary &s;lavery.
<PB N="511" REF="523">Honour, ju&s;tice, and humanity forbid us tamely to &s;urrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ance&s;tors, and which our innocent po&s;terity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of re&s;igning &s;ucceeding genera|tions to that wretchedne&s;s which ineveitably awaits them, if we ba&s;ely entail hereditary bondage upon them.</P>
<P>Our cau&s;e is ju&s;t: Our union is perfect: Our in|ternal re&s;ources are great, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance is undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully acknowledge, as &s;ignal in&s;tances of the divine favour towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this &s;evere controver&s;y, until we were grown up unto our pre&s;ent &s;trength, had been previou&s;ly exerci&s;ed in warlike operations, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed the means of defending our&s;elves. With hearts fortified with the&s;e animating reflections, we mo&s;t &s;o|lemnly before God and the world declare, that, ex|erting the utmo&s;t energy of tho&s;e powers which our benificent Creator hath graciou&s;ly be&s;towed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to a&s;&s;ume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with un|abated firmne&s;s and per&s;everence, employ for the pre|&s;ervation of our liberties, being with one mind re&s;olv|ed to die freemen rather than live like &s;laves.</P>
<P>Le&s;t this declaration &s;hould di&s;quiet the minds of our friends and fellow-&s;ubjects in any part of the em|pire, we a&s;&s;ure them, that we mean not to di&s;&s;olve that union which has &s;o long and &s;o happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween us, and which we &s;incerely wi&s;h to &s;ee re&s;tor|ed. Nece&s;&s;ity has not yet driven us into that de&s;pe|rate mea&s;ure, or induced us to excite any other nation to war again&s;t them. We have not rai&s;ed armies with
<PB N="512" REF="524">ambitious de&s;igns of &s;eparating from Great Britain, and e&s;tabli&s;hing independent &s;tates. We fight not for glory or for conque&s;t. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable &s;pectacle of a people attacked by unpro|voked enemies, without any imputation, or even &s;u&s;|picion of offence. They boa&s;t of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than &s;ervitude or death.</P>
<P>In our own native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it; for the protection of our property, acquired &s;olely by the hone&s;t indu&s;try of our forefathers, and our&s;elves; again&s;t violence actu|ally offered, we have taken up arms. We &s;hall lay them down when ho&s;tilities &s;hall cea&s;e on the part of the aggre&s;&s;ors, and all danger of their being renew|ed &s;hall be removed, and not before.</P>
<P>With an humble confidence in the mercies of the &s;upreme and impartial judge and ruler of the univer&s;e, we mo&s;t devoutly implore his divine goodne&s;s to con|duct us happily through this great conflict, to di&s;po&s;e our adver&s;aries to reconciliation on rea&s;onable terms, and thereby to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil war.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the King's mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t Gracious Sovereign,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE your Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects of the colonies of New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay, Rhode I|&s;land, and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, the counties of New-Jer&s;ey, Kent and Su&s;&s;ex in Delaware, Maryland, Vir|ginia, North and South Carolina, in behalf of our|&s;elves and the inhabitants of the&s;e colonies who have deputed us to repre&s;ent them in General Congre&s;s, entreat your Maje&s;ty's gracious attention to this our humble petition.</P>
<P>The union betweeen our mother-country and the&s;e colonies, and the energy of mild and ju&s;t govern|ment, produced benefits &s;o remarkably important, and afforded &s;uch a&s;&s;urances of their permanency and in|crea&s;e, that the wonder and envy of other nations were excited, while they beheld Great Britain ri&s;ing to a power the mo&s;t extraordinary the world had e|ver known. Her rivals ob&s;erving that there was no probability of this happy connection being broken by civil di&s;&s;entions, and apprehending its future effects, if left any longer undi&s;turbed, re&s;olved to prevent her receiving &s;o continued and formidable an acce&s;&s;ion of wealth and &s;trength, by checking the growth of the&s;e &s;ettlements, from which they were to be derived.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this attempt, events &s;o unfa|vourable to the de&s;ign took place, that every friend to the intere&s;t of Great Britain and the&s;e colonies,
<PB N="514" REF="526">entertained plea&s;ing and rea&s;onable expectations of &s;eeing an additional force and exten&s;ion immediately given to the operations of the union hitherto experi|enced, by an enlargement of the dominions of the crown, and the removal of ancient and warlike ene|mies to a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion, therefore, of the late war, the mo&s;t glorious and advantageous that ever had been carried on by Briti&s;h arms, your loyal colonies hav|ing contributed to its &s;ucce&s;s by &s;uch repeated and &s;treneous exertions as frequently procured them the de&s;tingui&s;hed approbation of your Maje&s;ty, of the late king, and of parliament, doubted not but that they &s;hould be permitted, with the re&s;t of the empire, to &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and the emoluments of victory and conque&s;t. While the&s;e recent and ho|nourable acknowledgments of their merits remained on record in the journals and acts of that augu&s;t legi&s;la|ture, the parliament, undefaced by the imputation, or even the &s;u&s;picion of any offence, they were alarm|ed by a new &s;y&s;tem of &s;tatutes, and regulations adopt|ed for the admini&s;tration of the colonies, that filled their minds with the mo&s;t painful fears and jealou&s;ies; and to their inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;hment, perceived the dangers of a foreign quarrel quickly &s;ucceeded by dome&s;tic dangers, and in their judgment of a more dreadful kind.</P>
<P>Nor were their anxieties alleviated by any tenden|cy in this &s;y&s;tem to promote the welfare of the mo|ther country: for though its effects were more imme|diately felt by them, yet its influence appeared to be injurious to the commerce and pro&s;perity of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>We &s;hall decline the ungratefel task of of de&s;crib|ing
<PB N="515" REF="527">the irk&s;ome variety of artifices practi&s;ed by many of your Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, the delu&s;ive pretences, fruitle&s;s terrors, and unavailing &s;everities, which have from time to time been dealt out by them in their at|tempts to execute this impolitic plan, or of tracing through a &s;eries of years pa&s;t the progre&s;s of the unhappy differences between Great Britain and the&s;e colonies, which have flowed from this fatal &s;ource.&mdash;Your Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters per&s;evering in their mea|&s;ures, and proceeding to open ho&s;tilities for enforcing them, have compelled us to arm in our own defence, and have engaged us in a controver&s;y &s;o peculiarly abhorrent from the affections of your &s;till faithful co|loni&s;ts, that when we con&s;ider whom we mu&s;t oppo&s;e in this conte&s;t, and if it continues, what may be the con&s;equence; our own particular misfortunes are ac|counted by us only as parts of our di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Knowing to what violent re&s;entments and incura|ble animo&s;ities civil di&s;ords are apt to exa&s;perate and inflame the contending parties, we think our&s;elves required by indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations to Almighty God, to your Maje&s;ty, to our fellow-&s;ubjects, and our&s;elves, immediately to u&s;e all the means in our power, not incompatible with our &s;afety, for &s;top|ping the further effu&s;ion of blood, and for averting the impending calamities that threaten the Briti&s;h empire. Thus called upon to addre&s;s your Maje&s;ty on affairs of &s;uch moment to America, and probably to all your dominions, we are earne&s;tly de&s;irous of performing this office with the utmo&s;t deference to your Maje&s;ty; and we therefore pray that your roy|al magnanimity and benevolence may make the mo&s;t favourable con&s;tructions of our expre&s;&s;ions on &s;o un|common an occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>Could we repre&s;ent, in their full force, the &s;enti|ments which agitate the minds of us, your dutiful &s;ubjects, we are per&s;uaded your Maje&s;ty would a&s;cribe any &s;eeming deviation from reverence, in our lan|guage, and even in our conduct, not to any reprehen|&s;ible intention, but to the impo&s;&s;ibility of reconciling the u&s;ual appearances of re&s;pect with a ju&s;t attention to our pre&s;ervation again&s;t tho&s;e artful and cruel ene|mies, who abu&s;e your royal confidence and author|ity for the purpo&s;e of effecting our de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Attached to your Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, family, and go|vernment, with all the devotion that principle and affection can in&s;pire, connected with Great Britain by the &s;tronge&s;t ties that can unite &s;ocieties, and deplor|ing every event that tends in any degree to weaken them, we &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that we not only mo&s;t ardently de&s;ire the former harmony be|tween her and the&s;e colonies may be re&s;tored, but that a concord may be e&s;tabli&s;hed between them on &s;o firm a ba&s;is as to perpetuate its ble&s;&s;ings uninter|rupted by any future di&s;&s;entions to &s;ucceeding gene|rations in both countries; to tran&s;mity our Maje&s;ty's name to po&s;terity, adorned with that &s;ignal and la&s;t|ing glory that has attended the memory of tho&s;e illu&s;|trious per&s;onages, who&s;e virtues and abilities have ex|tricated &s;tates from dangerous convul&s;ions, and by &s;ecuring happine&s;s to others, have erected the mo&s;t noble and durable monuments to their own fame.</P>
<P>We beg leave further to a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;ufferings of your loyal coloni&s;ts, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, our brea&s;ts retain too tender a regard for the kingdom from which we derive our origin, to reque&s;t &s;uch a re|conciliation, as might in any manner be incon&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="517" REF="529">with her dignity or her welfare. The&s;e, related as we are to her, honour and duty, as well as inclina|tion, induce us to &s;upport and advance; and the ap|prehen&s;ions that now oppre&s;s our hearts with un|&s;peakable grief being once removed, your Maje&s;ty will find your faithful &s;ubjects, on this continent, rea|dy and willing, at all times, as they have ever been, with their lives and fortunes to a&s;&s;ert and maintain the rights and intere&s;ts of your Maje&s;ty, and of our mo|ther country.</P>
<P>We therefore be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty, that your roy|al authority and influence may be graciou&s;ly inter|po&s;ed to procure us relief from our afflicting fears and jealou&s;ies, occa&s;ioned by the &s;y&s;tem before-men|tioned, and to &s;ettle peace through every part of your dominions; with all humility &s;ubmitting to your Ma|je&s;ty's wi&s;e con&s;ideration, whether it may not be ex|pedient, for facilitating tho&s;e important purpo&s;es that your Maje&s;ty be plea&s;ed to direct &s;ome mode by which the united applications of your faithful coloni&s;ts to the throne, in pur&s;uance of their common-councils, may be improved into a happy and permament reconcili|ation; and that in the mean time mea&s;ures may be taken for preventing the further de&s;truction of the lives of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and that &s;uch &s;tatutes as more immediately di&s;tre&s;s any of your Maje&s;ty's co|lonies be repealed.

<P>By the operation of divers acts of the Briti&s;h parli|ament, we behold, with deep affliction, that happy communion of intere&s;ts and good offices, which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between this country and America, &s;u&s;pended, and an intercour&s;e (which, augmenting, as it grew, the &s;trength and dignity of your Maje&s;ty's dominions, hath enabled your Maje&s;ty to defeat the natural rivals of your greatne&s;s in every quarter of the world) threatened with irretrievable ruin.</P>
<P>We &s;hould humbly repre&s;ent to your Maje&s;ty, if they had not been already repre&s;ented, the deadly wounds which the commerce of this country mu&s;t feel from the&s;e unfortunate mea&s;ures; for that it has not yet more deeply felt them is owing to temporary and accidental cau&s;es, which cannot long continue.</P>
<P>But we beg your Maje&s;ty to ca&s;t an eye on the ge|neral property of this land, and to reflect what mu&s;t
<PB N="520" REF="532">be its fate when deprived of our American com|merce.</P>
<P>It fills our mind with additional grief to &s;ee the blood and trea&s;ure of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects wa&s;ted in effecting a fatal &s;eparation between the different part of your Maje&s;ty's empire, by a war, uncertain in the event, de&s;tructive in its con&s;equences, and the object contended for lo&s;t in the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>The experience we have had in your Maje&s;ty's paternal regard for the welfare and privileges of all your people, and the opinion we entertain of the ju&s;|tice of the Briti&s;h parliament, forbids us to believe that laws, &s;o repugnant to the policy of former time would have received their &s;anction, had the real circum&s;tances and &s;entiments of the colonies been thoroughly under&s;tood, or the true principles of their connection with the mother country been duly weigh|ed: we are therefore nece&s;&s;arily con&s;trained to im|pure blame to tho&s;e by whom your Maje&s;ty and the parliament have been de&s;ignedly mi&s;led, or partially informed of tho&s;e matters, on a full knowledge of which alone, determinations of &s;uch importance &s;hould have been founded.</P>
<P>We beg leave further to repre&s;ent to your Maje&s;|ty, that, in que&s;tions of high national concern affect|ing the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of a &s;late, &s;peculation and ex|periment are &s;eldom to be ju&s;tified:&mdash;That want of fore&s;ight is want of judgment; and per&s;everence in mea&s;ures, which repeated experience hath condemn|ed, cea&s;es to be error.</P>
<P>We might appeal to the hi&s;tories of all countries to &s;hew, that force had never been employed with &s;uc|ce&s;s, to change the opinions or convince the minds of freemen; and, from the annals of our own in parti|cular,
<PB N="521" REF="533">we learn, that the free and voluntary gifts of the &s;ubject have ever exceeded the exactions of the &s;word.</P>
<P>Re&s;training prohibitary and penal laws have failed to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the public tranquility; and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this unfortunate di&s;pute affords rea&s;on to be|lieve, that, as it commenced without policy, it mu&s;t be pro&s;ecuted by means which the natural and con&s;ti|tutional &s;trength of Great Britain cannot &s;upply.</P>
<P>In your Maje&s;ty's ju&s;tice we confide for a fair con|&s;truction of an apprehen&s;ion we have coneeived, that your Maje&s;ty hath been advi&s;ed to take foreign troops into Briti&s;h pay, and to rai&s;e and di&s;cipline Papi&s;ts both in Ireland and Canada, for the purpo&s;e of en|forcing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to laws which your Maje&s;ty's Pro|te&s;tant &s;ubjects in America conceive to be de&s;tructive of their liberties, and again&s;t which they have re|peatedly petitioned in vain.</P>
<P>Anxious to vindicate the national honour we would willingly di&s;credit reports of &s;laves incited to in&s;urrec|tion, and barbarous nations encouraged to take up arms again&s;t our American brethren if they had not prevailed without refutation, and filled the minds of your Maje&s;ty's faithful &s;ubjects with indignation and horror.</P>
<P>If to the&s;e circum&s;tances of peril and di&s;tre&s;s our fears could &s;ugge&s;t any addition, we might ju&s;tly ex|pect it from the re&s;entment of tho&s;e powerful ene|mies, who have ever &s;hewn a readine&s;s to take advan|tages of our internal commotions, and will joyfully embrace the occa&s;ion of avenging that di&s;grace they &s;u&s;tained, during the late glorious war, from the u|nited arms of Great Britain and America;&mdash;and we &s;hould indeed be reduced to de&s;pair, but that we are
<PB N="522" REF="534">encouraged to look up to your Maje&s;ty, the common father of all your people, as the happy in&s;trument in the hands of Divine Providence, which bringeth good out of evil, for re&s;toring to this di&s;tracted empire the ble&s;&s;ings of mutual confidence, liberty and peace.</P>
<P>For the &s;peedy effecting of which, we mo&s;t hum|bly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to cau&s;e ho&s;tilities to cea&s;e in your Maje&s;ty's colonies in America, and to adopt &s;uch a mode of reconciling this happy controver&s;y as may be&s;t promote the intere&s;t of commerce and the welfare of all your people.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Geutlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;ituation of America, and by con|&s;tant de&s;ire to have your advice, concurrence, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance on every important occa&s;ion, have deter|mined me to call you thus early together.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have long too &s;ucce&s;sfully laboured to inflame my people in America by gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions, and to infu&s;e into their minds a &s;y&s;tem of opi|nions
<PB N="524" REF="536">repugnant to the true con&s;titution of the colo|nies, and to their &s;ubordinate relation to Great Bri|tain, now openly avow their revolt, ho&s;tility, and re|bellion. They have rai&s;ed troops, and are collect|ing a naval force; they have &s;eized the public reve|nue, and a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves legi&s;lative, executive, and judical powers, which they already exerci&s;e, in the mo&s;t arbitrary maner, over the per&s;ons and pro|perties of their fellow-&s;ubjects; and although many of the&s;e unhappy people may &s;till retain their loyalty, and may be too wi&s;e not to &s;ee the fatal con&s;equence of this u&s;urpation, and wi&s;h to re&s;i&s;t it; yet the tor|rent of violence has been &s;trong enough to compel their acquie&s;cence till a &s;ufficient force &s;hall appear to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>The authors and promoters of this de&s;perate con|con&s;piracy have, in the conduct of it, derived great ad|vantage from the difference of our intentions and theirs. They meant only to amu&s;e us by vague ex|pre&s;&s;ions of attachment to the parent &s;tate, and the &s;tronge&s;t prote&s;tations of loyalty to me, whil&s;t they were preparing for a general revolt. On our part, though it was declared in your la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions, that a re|bellion exi&s;ted within the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ett's-Bay, yet even that province we wi&s;hed rather to reclaim than to &s;ubdue. The re&s;olutions of parlia|ment breathed a &s;pirit of moderation and forbearance; conciliatory propo&s;itions accompanied the mea&s;ures taken to enforce authority; and the coercive acts were adapted to ca&s;es of criminal combinations a|mong&s;t &s;ubjects not then in arms. I had acted with the &s;ame temper; anxious to prevent, if it had been po&s;&s;ible, the effu&s;ion of the blood of my &s;ubjects, and the calamities which are in&s;eparable from a &s;tate of
<PB N="525" REF="537">war; &s;till hoping that my people in America would have di&s;cerned the traiterous views of their leaders, and have been convinced that to be a &s;ubject of Great Britain, with all its con&s;equences, is to be the free&s;t member of any civil &s;ociety in the known world.</P>
<P>The rebellious war now levied is become more general, and is manife&s;tly carried on for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing an independent empire. I need not dwell upon the fatal effects of the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch a plan. The object is too important, the &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h nation too high, the re&s;ources which God hath ble&s;&s;ed her too numerous, to give up &s;o many colo|nies which &s;he has planted with great indu&s;try, nur&s;ed with great tenderne&s;s, encouraged with many com|commercial advantages, and protected and defended at much expence of blood and trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is now become the part of wi&s;dom, and (in its effects) of clemency, to put a &s;peedy end to the&s;e di&s;|orders by the mo&s;t decicive exertions. For this pur|po&s;e, I have increa&s;ed my naval e&s;tabli&s;hment, and have greatly augmented my land forces; but in &s;uch a manner as may be the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome to my king|doms.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o the &s;atisfaction to inform you, that I have received the mo&s;t friendly offers of foreign a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and if I &s;hall make any treaties in con&s;equence thereof, they &s;hall be laid before you. And I have, in te&s;timony of my affection for my people, who can have no cau&s;e in which I am not equally intere&s;ted, &s;ent to the garri&s;on of Gibraltar and Port Mahon a part of my Electoral troops, in order that a large num|ber of the e&s;tabli&s;hed forces of this kingdom may be applied to the maintenance of its authority, and the national militia planned and regulated with equal
<PB N="526" REF="538">regard to the rights, &s;afety, and protection of my crown and people, may give a farther extent and ac|tivity to our military operations.</P>
<P>When the unhappy and deluded multitude, again&s;t whom this force will be directed, &s;hall become &s;en&s;ibie of their error, I &s;hall be ready to receive the mi&s;led with tenderne&s;s and mercy; and, in order to prevent the inconveniences which may ari&s;e from the great di&s;tance of their &s;ituation, and to remove, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, the calamities which they &s;uffer, I &s;hall give authority to certain per&s;ons upon the &s;pot, to grant general or particular pardons or indemnities, in &s;uch manner, and to &s;uch per&s;ons, as they &s;hall think fit, and to receive the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of any province or co|lony which &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to return to its allegi|ance. It may be al&s;o proper to authori&s;e the per&s;ons &s;o commi&s;&s;ioned to re&s;tore &s;uch province or colony, &s;o returning to its allegiance, to the free exerci&s;e of its trade and commerce, and to the &s;ame protection and &s;ecurity, as if &s;uch peovince or colony had never revolted.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</P>
<P>I have ordered the proper e&s;timates for the en&s;uing year to be laid before you; and I rely on your affec|tion to me, and your re&s;olution to maintain the ju&s;t rights of this country, for &s;uch &s;upplies as the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of our affairs require.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> A &s;hort View of American Affairs, <HI>1775.</HI>&mdash;The Inva&s;ion of Canada by the Coloni&s;ts.&mdash;The Forts of Chamblee and St. John taken.&mdash;Montreal taken.&mdash;Arnold ap|pears before Quebec.&mdash;General Montgomery joins him. The Seige.&mdash;An Attempt to Storm the Town.&mdash;Mont|gomery killed.&mdash;Arnold wounded.&mdash;The Provincials retire.</HEAD>
<P>THE coloni&s;ts in proportion as their hopes of ac|comodation with the mother country decrea&s;ed, grew more daring in their enterpri&s;es, and extended their views to more di&s;tant and remote con&s;equences. The parliament of Great Britain having pa&s;&s;ed a law e&s;tabli&s;hing the Popi&s;h religion in Canada, greatly alarmed the coloni&s;ts.&mdash;They con&s;idered this law, which went by the name of the Quebec Act, as a &s;tra|tagem of &s;tate, intended to &s;educe the Papi&s;ts in Ca|nada into the de&s;igns of government; which were to excite the Canadians to take up arms, and fall up|on the back &s;ettlements of the New England pro|vinces. It appeared even to the people at home to have this intention, and was greatly complained of by the true friends of the con&s;titution. It was &s;aid to be an infringement of the revolution &s;ettlement, and a violation of the King's coronation oath, as well as a palpable &s;y&s;tem of partiality to popery in the framers of that law. The whole of the di&s;pute upon this &s;ub|ject is &s;o well known, and has been &s;o often reviewed
<PB N="529" REF="542">in various publications, that I &s;hall take no more no|tice of it on this occa&s;ion. The intentions of the Bri|ti&s;h government were perfectly under&s;tood by the coloni&s;ts, who pur&s;ued &s;uch mea&s;ures as they thought were mo&s;t proper to render the &s;chemes of the mini|try of none effect. It was the apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equences of this bill that made the colonies in op|po&s;ition &s;o warmly addre&s;s the French inhabitants of Canada, which has been already taken notice of.</P>
<P>As the good &s;ucce&s;s of a former expedition to the Lakes, had given &s;pirits to the Americans, and Ticon|derago and Crown Point was now in their hands, the congre&s;s was re&s;olved to make a bold pu&s;h for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Canada; the way to it was open by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the command of the Lakes, and they thought that if they could accompli&s;h this grand de|&s;ign they would in a great mea&s;ure emancipate them|&s;elves from the tyranny of the Briti&s;h government.&mdash;Such a mea&s;ure, of &s;o extraordinary a magnitude re|quired the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration. They had hi|therto been only &s;tanding upon the defen&s;ive, and endeavouring to &s;upport what they believed to be their ju&s;t rights and privileges, again&s;t the inva&s;ion of an arbitrary pow$r, that &s;eemed determined to wre&s;t them from them; but this was a new project, and carried the matter a great deal farther. It was mak|ing the war offen&s;ive, and attacking the power of the Sovereign in tho&s;e parts where they were not imme|diately concerned. The conduct of the colonies in their former proceedings was &s;upported by very &s;trong authority, and precedents the mo&s;t re&s;pectable; op|pre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice in many governments had been oppo&s;ed and re&s;i&s;ted. But this new proceeding of the coloni&s;ts was &s;aid to be without precedent. To
<PB N="530" REF="543">fly in the face of the Sovereign, carry on war in his dominions, and invade a province to which they could lay no claim, nor pretend to any right, appeared &s;uch an outrage as not only to overthrow every plea of ju&s;tifiable re&s;i&s;tance, but militated with the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed opinions, principles, and feelings of mankind in ge|neral.</P>
<P>It was alledged on the other &s;ide, that the danger was pre&s;&s;ing and great. General Carleton had re|ceived powers from government of an alarming na|ture, and was authorized to arm the Canadians, and to march them out of the country again&s;t the other co$onies, with a de&s;ign to reduce them to a &s;tate of bondage and &s;lavery; and was impowered to proceed even to capital puni&s;hment, again&s;t all tho&s;e, and in all places, whom he &s;hould judge rebels and oppo|&s;ers of the laws. The powers he had received with|in his own province were equal to tho&s;e of the mo&s;t arbitrary princes in Europe, and had been already felt both by the Engli&s;h and French &s;ubjects. Tho' the Canadians had hitherto refu&s;ed to be embodied, or to march upon any terms out of the province, it was ea&s;ily perceived, that as &s;oon as the Governor's authority was inforced by the arrival of troops from England, that the Canadians would be obliged to o|bey him implicitly, as well in that as in other mat|ters.</P>
<P>He had already engaged a con&s;iderable number of Canadians, and other Indians, in his &s;ervice; and if his arms once became predominant, the de&s;ire of &s;poil would bring the &s;avages in crouds from the re|mote&s;t de&s;arts to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Be&s;ides, they were per|fectly acquainted with, and therefore had every thing to dread from the zeal and &s;pirit of enterprize,
<PB N="531" REF="544">and talents of that able and re&s;olute officer. In &s;uch circum&s;tances they con&s;idered it contrary to all the rules of rea&s;on and prudence to wait till they were attacked by a formidable force at their backs, in the very in&s;tant that it would require all their pow|er and force to defend their coa&s;ts and protect their capital cities again&s;t the re&s;entment of a mighty power, which they had &s;o much provoked and offended, and with whom they were entering into a conte&s;t, arduous and hitherto untried. They alledged that it was as ju&s;t to prevent a known enemy from gathering &s;trength to de&s;troy them, when they knew that he intend|ed their ruin, as it was ju&s;t to defend them&s;elves a|gain&s;t them, when they a&s;&s;aulted them; and that the principes of &s;elf defence allowed them to take every &s;tep which their rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted to prevent their own ruin; and that it was le&s;s cruel to prevent &s;uch an evil than to &s;uffer it, if they po&s;&s;ibly could prevent it. They &s;aid that there was no law of nature or rea&s;on, nor convention among mankind, by which a per&s;on was bound to be a &s;imple &s;pectator while his enemy was loading his gun for his de&s;truction; was he to wait till the execution was over, for fear he &s;hould be con&s;idered as an aggre&s;&s;or? Ca&s;es and que&s;tions of this nature, however entertaining in other occa&s;ions, have no weight in circum&s;tances on which the fate of nations depend. Were they only to &s;eek a redre&s;s when the &s;avages had penetrated into their country, and the fury of the flames which had con&s;umed their &s;ettlements were only retarded by the blood of their wives and infants?</P>
<P>The congre&s;s were &s;en&s;ible that they had now pro|ceeded &s;o far as would only be ju&s;tified by the force of arms; for force of argument had no influence up|on
<PB N="532" REF="545">on tho&s;e they had to di&s;pute with. They had already drawn the &s;word, and the appeal was made. It was now too late to turn back, and to waver was certain de&s;truction. Their &s;ucce&s;s now depended upon vi|gorous mea&s;ures, which could alone give &s;anction to their re&s;i&s;tance, and di&s;po&s;e the government of Great Britain to an accomodation upon lenient terms; with|out this they knew that they would not only lo&s;e tho&s;e liberties for which they contended, but all their other privileges would be at the mercy of a jealous and provoked government. In &s;uch a &s;itu|ation, their moderation in the in&s;tance of Canada they imagined would be but a poor plea for compa&s;|&s;ion or indulgence.</P>
<P>They were well informed of the &s;tate of affairs in Canada, and under&s;tood the temper of the people: This la&s;t gave them encouragement in the enterprize they were about to engage in. They knew that the French inhabitants, excepting the noble&s;&s;e and clergy, were generally as much di&s;contented at the &s;etting a&s;ide the Engli&s;h laws, and the introduction of the new &s;y&s;tem of government, as the Briti&s;h &s;ettlers them&s;elves. It appeared exceeding probable that this new di&s;content co-operating with their rooted a|ver&s;ion which they had to their ancient, proud, and oppre&s;&s;ive tyrants, the noble&s;&s;e, or lords of the ma|nors, and the mortal dread which they had of being again reduced to their former &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, would incline them to con&s;ider the provincials rather as friends than invaders, and make them embrace &s;o fa|vourable an opportunity of obtaining a &s;hare of the common liberty, which they were contending for.&mdash;Though the Canadians were unacquainted with the nature of the controver&s;y, and very little intere&s;ted in
<PB N="533" REF="546">it, yet as it appeared to be for liberty, and American freedom, the name was plea&s;ing, and likely to en|gage their attention. It was al&s;o in favour of the colonies, of which Canada was a part.</P>
<P>It was determined not to lo&s;e the opportunity of pur&s;uing this mea&s;ure, while the Briti&s;h arms were weak, and &s;hut up within the town of Bo&s;ton: this was con&s;idered as a proper time for attempting the reduction of the province of Canada. A body of New York militia and New England troops, and &s;ome o|thers, to the amount of 2000 men, under the com|mand of the Generals Schulyer and Montgomery, were appointed for this &s;ervice. Batteaux and flat|boats were built at Ticonderago and Crown Point, to convey the troops along Lake Champlain to the ri|ver Sorrel, which forms the entrance into Canada, and is compo&s;ed of the &s;urplus waters of the Lakes, which it di&s;charges into the river St. Laurence, and would afford an agreeable communication betwixt that river and the Lakes, were it not on account of the rapidity in &s;ome parts that ob&s;tructs the naviga|tion. The Sorrel runs a cour&s;e of 69 miles, and falls into the river St Laurence in latitude 46.10. lon. 72.25.</P>
<P>General Montgomery, who was at Crown Point, had received intelligence, that a &s;chooner of &s;ome con&s;iderable force, with other armed ve&s;&s;els which lay at St. John's on the river Sorrel, were making ready to enter the Lake, and were intended to ob|&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age of the provincials. Upon receiving this information, tho' he had not the half of the forces that were intended for this expedition, he proceeded with tho&s;e which he had to the I&s;le of Noix, which lies in the entrance of the river, and took nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="534" REF="547">mea&s;ures to guard again&s;t the pa&s;&s;age of the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els into the Lakes. General Schuyler, who was at that time chief in command, having arrived at Alba|ny, the two Generals publi&s;hed a declaration to en|courage and per&s;uade the Canadians to join them, and with this expectation marched on to the Fort of St. John, which lies only about twelve miles from the above-mentioned i&s;land. Having taken a view of the fort at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance, they perceived &s;igna|tures of &s;trong re&s;i&s;tance, which made them land at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance in a woody country, full of deep &s;wamps, and inter&s;ected with creeks and waters. In this &s;ituation they were attacked by a con&s;iderable body of Indians, who did not neglect to take hold of the advantages which the &s;ituation afforded them.&mdash;The&s;e two circum&s;tances concurring, namely, the ap|parent &s;trength of the fort, and the re&s;i&s;tance of the Indians, determined them to return to their former &s;tation in the i&s;land, and to wait till the arrival of the artillery and reinforcements, which were expected.</P>
<P>Schuyler upon this returned to Albany, to con|clude a treaty with the Indians in the&s;e parts which he had been negociating for &s;ome time pa&s;t; but be|ing thro' illne&s;s unable to return, the whole weight of the war fell upon General Montgomery. This gentleman was mo&s;t eminently qualified for military &s;ervice; though perhaps this expedition required the utmo&s;t reach of all his abilities. His fir&s;t mea&s;ure was to detach from the &s;ervice of General Carleton tho&s;e Indians who had joined them, and being &s;trengthened by the arrival of his reinforcements and artillery, he prepared to lay &s;iege to the fort of St. John. This fort was garri&s;oned by the greater part of the 7th and 26th regiments, being nearly all
<PB N="535" REF="548">the regular troops then in Canada; and was well pro|vided with &s;tores, ammunition, and artillery.</P>
<P>The parties of the provincials were &s;pread over the adjacent country, and were every where well re|ceived by the Canadians, who be&s;ides joining them in great numbers, gave every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whe|ther in carrying on the &s;iege; removing their artille|ry, or &s;upplying them with provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries. While matters were in this &s;ituation, the famous E|than Allan, who without any commi&s;&s;ion from the congre&s;s had a principal &s;hare in the original expedi|tion to the lakes, and the taking of the forts; and who &s;ince, under the title of colonel, &s;eems rather to have acted as one of the party, had a mind to &s;ignal|ize him&s;elf, by &s;urpri&s;ing the town and garri&s;on of Montreal. He undertook this hazardous enterprize at the head of a &s;mall party of provincials and Cana|dians, without the knowledge of the commander in chief, or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he might have procur|ed from &s;ome of the other detached parties. The event was un&s;ucce&s;sful as the undertaking was ra&s;h. The militia, &s;upported by a few regular troops under the command of &s;ome Engli&s;h officers met the adven|turer at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town, defeated his troops, and took him&s;elf pri&s;oner, with forty others; the re&s;t of his party e&s;caped into the woods. Allen and his fellow pri&s;oners were by the orders of Gene|ral Carleton loaded with chains, and in that condition &s;ent a-board a man of war to England. They were however afterwards &s;ent back to America, for what rea&s;on is not particularly affirmed.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of the &s;iege of St. John was for &s;ome time retarded for want of ammunition &s;ufficient
<PB N="536" REF="549">for &s;uch an operation. Of all which none were more nece&s;&s;ary than powder and ball.&mdash;The fort of St. John's, which commands the entrance into Canada, could not be reduced without a &s;uitable provi&s;ion of this &s;ort. General Montgomery by a fortunate event was delivered from this difficulty. A little fort called Chamble, lay deep in the country, and feemed cover|ed by St. John's. It was garri&s;oned by a &s;mall de|tachment of the &s;eventh regiment, and was in a &s;tate not fit for enduring a &s;iege. The General turned his attention fir&s;t to this fort, and by pu&s;hing forward a party joined by &s;ome Canadians, he ea&s;ily became ma&s;ter of the place. Here he found con&s;iderable &s;tore, but the article of the greate&s;t con&s;equence was gun-powder, which they were greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for, and of which they took about 120 barrels.&mdash;This acqui&s;ition facilitated the &s;iege of St. John's, which had been for &s;ome time in a great mea&s;ure interrupt|ed for want of ammunition.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on of St. John's under the command of Major Pre&s;ton, amounted to between 6 and 700 men, of which about five hundred were regulars, and the re&s;t Canadian volunteers. They endured the dif|ficulties of a very hard &s;iege, and &s;uffering the hard|&s;hips attending it, augmented by a &s;carcity of provi|&s;ions, with unremitted &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s and re&s;olution.&mdash;In the mean time General Carleton was indefatigable in his endeavours to rai&s;e &s;ufficient forces for its re|lief. Attempts were al&s;o made by Colonel M'Clean for rai&s;ing a Scotch regiment, under the title of Roy|al Highland Emigrants, to be compo&s;ed of natives of that country, who had lately arrived in America, and who in con&s;equence of the troubles had not obtained &s;ettlements. The colonel with the&s;e and &s;ome Cana|dians,
<PB N="537" REF="550">to the amount of a hundred men, was po&s;ted near the junction of the Sorrel with the river St. Lawrence. General Carleton u&s;ed his utmo&s;t dili|gence to effect a junction with Colonel M'Clean, and then to march to the relief of St. John's; but his pur|po&s;e was fru&s;trated, and his de&s;ign rendered abor|tive by the activity and vigilence of the provincials.&mdash;He was attacked at Longueil, in attempting to pa&s;s over from the i&s;land of Montreal, by a party of pro|vincials, who ea&s;ily repul&s;ed the Canadians, and fru|&s;trated his whole de&s;ign. Another party had pu&s;hed M'Clean towards the mouth of the Sorrel, where the Canadians having received advice of the Gover|nor's defeat, immediately abandoned him to a man, and he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of making the be$$ of his way to Quebec with his Royal Scotch Emigrants.&mdash;The provincials on this occa&s;ion were extremely ac|tive, and took every opportunity that might be thought nece&s;&s;ary to crown this expedition with &s;uc|ce&s;s; their contrivances, and their attempts to exe|cute them, were equally &s;urpri&s;ing. Upon 'Cleans retreat to Quebec, the party who had reduced him to that nece&s;&s;ity, immediately erected batteries on a point of land at the junction of the Sorrel with the river St. Laurence, with a de&s;ign to prevent a num|ber of armed ve&s;&s;els which General Carleton had at Montreal, from e&s;caping down the river. They al&s;o con&s;tructed armed rafts, and flowing batteries for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, The&s;e mea&s;ures effectually prevent|ed the pa&s;&s;age of General Carleton's armament to Quebec, which were not only defeated in &s;everal at|tempts, but pur&s;ued, attacked, and driven from their anchor up the river by the provincial; &s;o that as General Montgomery approached Montreal immedi|ately
<PB N="538" REF="551">after the &s;urrender of St. John's, the gover|nor's &s;ituation, whether in town or a-board the ve&s;|&s;els, became dangerous and critical. General Carle|ton on this occa&s;ion needed all his military &s;agacity and fortitude; his condition was truly critical and a|larming, for it appeared &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that he could e&s;cape the &s;trict watch of a people who&s;e intere&s;t depended &s;o much in the ruin of &s;o inveterate an ene|my.</P>
<P>This danger was increa&s;ed by the arrival of Gene|ral Montgomery at Montreal, where a capitulation was propo&s;ed by the principal French and Engli&s;h in|habitants, including a &s;ort of general treaty, which Montgomery refu&s;ed, as they were in no &s;tate of de|fence to entitle them to a capitulation, and were on their &s;ide unable to fulfil the conditions. He howe|ver &s;ent them a written an&s;wer, in which he declared that the continental army having a generous di&s;dain of every act of oppre&s;&s;ion and violence, and having come for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of giving them liberty and &s;ecurity;&mdash;he therefore engaged his honour to maintain in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their property of every kind, the individuals and religious communi|ties of the city of Montreal. He al&s;o engaged for the maintenance of all the inhabitants in the free ex|erci&s;e erci&s;e of their religion, and expre&s;&s;ed his hopes, that the civil and religious rights of all the Canadians would be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the mo&s;t permanent foot|ing by a provincial congre&s;s. He promi&s;ed that courts of ju&s;tice &s;hould be &s;peedily e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the mo&s;t liberal plan, conformable to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; and he in general complied with other articles, &s;o far as they were in his power, and con&s;i&s;tent to him to grant. This &s;ecurity being given to the people, his
<PB N="539" REF="552">troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town upon the thirteenth of November.</P>
<P>It was now that &s;ea&s;on of the year when troops in|&s;tead of marching to inve&s;t formal &s;ieges, u&s;ually go into winter quarters; and in &s;uch a climate as Canada this &s;tep appeared more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;The &s;nows here are generally deep and the fro&s;ts &s;evere, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for an army to carry along with them all tho&s;e implements of war, which are nece&s;&s;ary for be&s;ieging ca&s;tles or &s;torming cities. It is even a ta&s;k beyond the ordinary efforts of nature, for troops to march in that &s;ea&s;on of the year in &s;uch a wild and uncultivated country, where the woods are &s;o ex|ten&s;ive, the thickets almo&s;t impenetrable, and the &s;wamps &s;o numerous. It required an uncommon re|&s;olution, as well as an extraordinary &s;trength of body, to endure the toil and fatigue that attended &s;uch an expedition.&mdash;Nothing but an ardent inclination to &s;upport the cau&s;e of liberty could have &s;upported this &s;mall army under the many di&s;advantages that were in their way. The inhabitants of Canada mu&s;t have in general wi&s;hed well to this enterpri&s;e, otherwi&s;e it was in their power to have cru&s;hed it in its fir&s;t open|ing; tho' they did not enter heartily into it, yet it is manife&s;t that they wi&s;hed it to &s;ucceed, rather than de&s;ired it might fail of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Nothing now could afford the &s;lighte&s;t hope of the pre&s;ervation of Canada, except the &s;ea&s;on of the year; it was this which alone gave hope of its pre&s;ervation to government. It appears &s;ome what extraordinary that the provincials did not begin their operations &s;ooner in the &s;ummer; for had they had three months of good weather before them, there was the greate&s;t rea&s;on to conclude that they would have be|come
<PB N="540" REF="553">ma&s;ters of all Canada. It has not yet been a&s;|certained whether this neglect happened thro' want of ability, or proceeded from difference in opinion in the managers of public affairs; it was however un|fortunate for their de&s;ign of becoming ma&s;ters of Ca|nada, that they did not &s;et out three months &s;ooner upon this expedition. As a balance to this di&s;advan|tage, there were but few forces belonging to the go|vernment in Canada; and the taking of General Carleton, which &s;eemed almo&s;t certain, would have rendered the reduction of Canada exceedingly ea&s;y.&mdash;A particular accident, which was fortunate for Ge|neral Carleton, determined this matter otherwi&s;e.&mdash;At that time all hopes of armed ve&s;&s;els being able to get down the river were given up; and when Mont|gomery was preparing batteaux with light artillery at Montreal to attack them on that &s;ide, and force them down upon the batteries, means were &s;ucce&s;sful|ly u&s;ed to convey the Governor in a dark night in a boat with mufled paddles pa&s;t the enemies guards and batteries, to Quebec, where he arrived in &s;afety.&mdash;This was a fortunate incident for government, but a mo&s;t unlucky one for the provincial adventurers, who provided they had got the Governor into their pow|er, would have ea&s;ily brought over all Canada to their views of liberty.</P>
<P>But to return to the &s;iege of St. John's, which was carried on with great vigour, and had been attended with better &s;ucce&s;s than the adventurers had rea&s;on to expect, The works were advanced near the bo|dy of the fort, and all things prepared for a general a&s;&s;ault. This would have probably been a very dan|gerous as well as a fruitle&s;s enterpri&s;e, con&s;idering the goodne&s;s of the troops within the fort, and the
<PB N="541" REF="554">weakne&s;s of the a&s;&s;ailants. Major Pre&s;ton was a good officer, and his men were regular troops, and under|&s;tood the military exerci&s;e to a great exactne&s;s;&mdash;he was determined to defend the fort to the la&s;t extrem|ity, which would have made the capture dear to the be&s;iegers. In this &s;ituation of affairs, on account of the &s;ucce&s;s at Longueil, accompanied with the pri&s;on|ers arrived at the camp, upon which General Mont|gomery &s;ent a flag and a letter by one of them to Ma|jor Pre&s;ton, wherein he &s;ignified his hopes that as all means of relief were cut off by the Governor's defeat, he would by a timely &s;urrender of the fort, prevent the further effu&s;ion, of blood, which a fruitle&s;s and ob&s;tinate defence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion.&mdash;This greatly &s;taggered the major's re&s;olution, and brought him to a parley, which had he been as well acquaint|ed with the &s;tate of the country and his enemy's force, as he might have been, he would certainly have re|fu&s;ed; for as he had near 700 regular troops in the fort, well appointed and furni&s;hed with a &s;ufficient quantity of ammunition, he might have re&s;i&s;ted the force of double the number of his own troops, e&s;pe|cially as the be&s;iegers were but raw and inexperienced, and not well appointed for carrying on a &s;iege. It appears to have been the general misfortune of the Briti&s;h Governors in America, and the officers &s;erving under them, that they were unacquainted with the &s;tate of the country, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabi|tants. This mu&s;t have preceeded either from want of capacity, or from want of attention to their duty. It would have certainly been an ea&s;y matter for the &s;ervants of government to have been acquainted with the whole proceedings of the inhabitants within the circle of their admini&s;tration, and by that means have
<PB N="542" REF="555">had it in their power to have guarded again&s;t and prevented being &s;urprized by any attack from the a&s;|&s;embling of the &s;ubjects. When government intend|ed to impo&s;e &s;uch obnoxious laws upon the coloni&s;ts, they ought fir&s;t to have known their di&s;po&s;itions, and in ca&s;e that they found them aver&s;e to compliance, have &s;ecured their obedience by &s;uch &s;ound &s;teps of policy as would have an&s;wered their own intentions. To be &s;urprized by their own &s;ubjects, argued a real want of under&s;tanding of the di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple, and a deficiency of political foreca&s;t with re|gard to the means of executing their new laws.&mdash;Both General Carleton and Major Pre&s;ton, ought to have informed them&s;elves of every &s;tep that the colo|nies were taking, and to have acquainted government with the real &s;ituation of the country. Two things appear obvious in the hi&s;tory of the proceedings of government, that they either never intended to in|force their new laws, or that they were totally infa|tuated with regard to the means of rendering them effectual; for if they had &s;tudied for an age to ex|po&s;e their own weakne&s;s, they could not have taken more effectual methods to have done it than tho&s;e they pur&s;ued. The troubles in America have prin|cipally ari&s;en from either the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s or incapacity of the Governors in tho&s;e parts, who either were con&s;tantly pur&s;uing their own intere&s;ts without mind|ing either the affairs of government or the people, or were per&s;ons preferred to tho&s;e po&s;ts by the inte|re&s;ts of friends, without having a &s;ingle qualification for the office they were preferred to. It has long been a mi&s;taken opinion prevailing in the mother country, that &s;uch as are not qualified for offices at home, may an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of colony admini&s;tra|tion;
<PB N="543" REF="556">from this idea has the governments aborad in the colonies been &s;upplied with both the weake&s;t and the wor&s;t of men.</P>
<P>Major Pre&s;ton endeavoured to obtain a few days time in hopes of &s;ome relief; but this was refu&s;ed, on account of the latene&s;s and &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on: he al&s;o endeavoured in &s;ettling the terms of capitulation, to obtain liberty for the garri&s;on to depart for Great Britain, which proved equally un&s;ucce&s;sful, and they were obliged, after being allowed the honours of war, on account of their brave defence, to lay down their arms, and &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners&mdash;They were allowed their baggage and effects, the of|ficers to wear their &s;words, and their other arms to be pre&s;erved for them till the troubles were at an end.&mdash;General Montgomery in all tran&s;actions with the King's troops, writ, &s;poke, and behaved with that attention, regard, and politene&s;s, to both private men and officers, which might be expected from a man of honour, and integrity, who found him&s;elf involv|ed in an unhappy quarrel with his friends and coun|trymen. Such behaviour was no more than what all who were per&s;onally acquainted with that officer, would always have expected of him. All the pri&s;on|ers who were taken at this time, were &s;ent up the Lakes, by way of Ticonderago, to tho&s;e inland parts of the colonies, which were be&s;t adapted for their reception, and provi&s;ion. The provincials found in this fort a con&s;iderable quantity of artillery and u&s;eful &s;tores, nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the enterpri&s;e they were now engaged in. The &s;ucce&s;s of this expedi|tion had hitherto proceeded beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of the adventurers, and their good fortune in what they had attempted pu&s;hed them on to achiev|ments
<PB N="544" REF="557">altogether beyond their &s;trength. Their &s;uc|ce&s;s upon the Lakes &s;educed them into an opinion of reducing the city of Quebec to the obedience of the congre&s;s, and they &s;eem to have both forgotten and de&s;pi&s;ed the dangers and fatigues of an inclement &s;ea|&s;on, thro' the hopes of fini&s;hing with glory &s;o import|ant an enterpri&s;e. The provincials had now the whole command of the lakes. General Pre&s;cot had been obliged to enter into a capitulation with them, by which the whole of the river's naval force, con&s;i&s;t|ing of eleven armed ve&s;&s;els, was &s;urrendered into their hands. General Pre&s;cot, with &s;everal officers, and &s;ome gentlemen of the civil department, Canadi|an volunteers, with 120 Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, all of whom had taken refuge on board the ve&s;&s;els upon the ap|proach of General Montgomery were made pri&s;on|ers of war. Tho' the rapid &s;ucce&s;s of Montgomery was not at that time blazoned with mini&s;terial figures of embelli&s;hment in the Gazette, yet there has no|thing during the cour&s;e of this unfortunate war been carried on with more addre&s;s, and &s;upported with greater energy, than this enterpri&s;e. The humanity of the commander, and the regularity of the troops, would have done honour to the mo&s;t legal military corps, and their fortitude in combating dangers and fatigues &s;ets them forth in a point of view which he|roes need not be a&s;hamed of. Feats of a much infe|rior nature have been in our government accounts extolled with the highe&s;t &s;trains of hyperbole, while the epithets of cowardice and rebellion have been gi|ven this bold and daring expedition. It is not the province of a hi&s;torian to determine what is rebelli|on; this mu&s;t be left to the judgment of after ages, who will determine with more impartiality than the
<PB N="545" REF="558">pre&s;ent concerning the character of American re&s;i&s;t|ance. There have been &s;ome grand rebellions in times pa&s;&s;ed recorded in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, which have changed their names in tho&s;e of Revolu|tions, and are now adorned with the epithet <HI>glorious,</HI> which according to the principles now in vogue a|mong courtiers, would have been &s;tigmatized with the name rebellion had they been un&s;ucce&s;sful.&mdash;It is time that mu&s;t declare which of the two this American re&s;i&s;tance belongs to.&mdash;Perhaps an hundred years hence what we account rebellion, will in the hi&s;tory of America be eclept <HI>a Revolution.</HI> Shall it prove in the end un&s;ucce&s;sful, it mu&s;t continue in the language and &s;tile of &s;tate politicians, a grand rebellion.</P>
<P>While Montgomery and his troops were carrying on the war in upper Canada, from New York by the old beaten cour&s;e of the Lakes, an expedition, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by its novely, &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, the difficul|ties that oppo&s;ed it, and the con&s;tancy maintained in its execution, was undertaken directly again&s;t the lower part of the province of Quebec, from the New England &s;ide, by a route that had hitherto been un|explored, and con&s;idered as impracticable. About the mid&s;t of September, Colonel Arnold, at the head of two regiments, con&s;i&s;ting of about 1100 men, marched from the camp near Bo&s;ton to Newport at the mouth of the river Merrimack, where ve&s;&s;els were ready to carry them to the mouth of the river Kennebee, in Newhamp&s;hire, a voyage of about forty leagues. Upon the twenty-&s;econd of the &s;ame month, they embarked their &s;tores and troops at Gardiner's Town, on the Kennebec; and proceeded with great difficulty up that river. The Kennebec has a rapid &s;tream, and its bottom and &s;hores on many places are
<PB N="546" REF="559">rocky, the navigation is continually interrupted by falls, and the carrying places are exceedingly difficult.&mdash; In this pa&s;&s;age the battaux were frequently filled with water, and over&s;et, in con&s;equence of which a part of their arms, ammunition, and provi&s;ions, were &s;ome|times lo&s;t. Be&s;ides the labour of loading and reload|ing at the carrying places, they were obliged to car|ry the boats upon their &s;houlders. The great carry|ing place was about twelve miles a cro&s;s, which was attended with much labour and fatigue. That part of the detachment which was employed in managing the batteaux, marched along the banks of the river, and the boats and men being di&s;po&s;ed in three divi|&s;ions, each divi&s;ion encamped together every night.&mdash; The march by land was not more eligible than the pa&s;&s;age by water.&mdash;They had thick woods, deep &s;wamps, difficult mountains and precipices, alternate|ly to encounter, and were upon occa&s;ions obliged to cut their way through the thickets for miles together. At the carrying places they were obliged to traver&s;e the &s;ame ground twice over heavy loaded. From all the&s;e impediments their progre&s;s was of cour&s;e very &s;low, travelling in general only from four or five to nine or ten miles a day. The con&s;tant and &s;evere fa|tigue cau&s;ed many of them to fall &s;ick, which added to their hard&s;hips;&mdash;and provi&s;ions grew at la&s;t &s;o &s;carce, that &s;ome of the men eat their dogs, and what|ever el&s;e of any kind could be converted into food.&mdash; When they arrived at the head of the Kennebec, which is upwards of an hundred and fifty miles from Gardiner's Town, and according to their way of tra|velling mu&s;t have been much more, they &s;ent back their &s;ick, and one of the colonels took that oppor|tunity of returning with his whole divi&s;ion, under the
<PB N="547" REF="560">pretence of the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions. This was done without the con&s;ent of the commander in chief, who had marched forward to explore the way. By this de&s;ertion, and the &s;ick that were returned, Arnold's detachment was reduced about one-third from its o|riginal number. They however proceeded with their u&s;ual con&s;tancy, and having cro&s;&s;ed the heights of land which are ridges of mountains that extend quite thro' the continent called heights they at la&s;t arrived at the head of river Chandiece, which runs thro' Canada, and falls into the river St. Lawrence near Quebec.&mdash; This ridge of little hills &s;eems to be the middle of the continent in tho&s;e parts; for as &s;oon as you come to the top of the heights, the river runs towards north, as they do on this &s;ide towards the &s;outh. This little army had &s;till a great way to march, though the great|e&s;t hard&s;hips were now over; they were now arrived at the inhabited part of Canada, where they found provi&s;ions. On the third day of November, an ad|vanced party returned with provi&s;ions, and they &s;oon after came to an hou&s;e, which was the fir&s;t they had &s;een for thirty-one days, having &s;pent the whole time in traver&s;ing an hideous wilderne&s;s, without ever &s;ee|ing an human face, except tho&s;e of their own party. Their march from the mouth of the Kennebec, was almo&s;t &s;treight north where they were approaching nearer to the pole every &s;tage, and encountering a &s;evere winter in a cold climate. They had from their taking &s;hip at Bo&s;ton, in the middle of September tra|velled 365 miles directly north, &s;uppo&s;ing they had travelled in a direct line,&mdash;but cou&s;idering the many turnings and windings in their journey, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that they marched near double that num|ber of miles.</P>

<P>The Canadians received them with the &s;ame good will that Montgomery and his corps were received in the neighbourhood of Montreal; they &s;upplied them li|berally with all &s;orts of provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries, and rendered them every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power. Arnold publi&s;hed immediately an addre&s;s to the peo|ple &s;igned by General Wa&s;hington, of the &s;ame na|ture with that which had been i&s;&s;ued before by Ge|neral Shuyler, and Montgomery. They were invited to join with the other colonies in an indi&s;&s;oluble uni|on, and to range them&s;elves under the &s;tandard of li|berty. They were informed in this addre&s;s that the armament was not &s;ent into the province to plunder, but to protect and animate them;&mdash;that they them|&s;elves were injoined to act, and to con&s;ider them&s;eves as in the country of their be&s;t friends; that they were therefore reque&s;ted not to de&s;ert their habitations, nor to fly from their friends, but to provide them with &s;uch &s;upplies as their country afforded; and he pled|ged him&s;elf for their fafety and &s;ecurity, as well as for an ample and &s;atisfactory compen&s;ation. The recep|tion which the&s;e adventurers met with from the Ca|nadians, &s;hews plainly that the Engli&s;h governors and new laws were not popular nor acceptable among them; that provided the &s;cale &s;hould have preponde|rated in favour of the coloni&s;ts, they would not have been aver&s;e to join the a&s;&s;ociation. This is very un|like the &s;ub&s;tance of the petition that was &s;ent from Canada to obtain an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the French laws, and a repeal of the Engli&s;h trials by juries.</P>
<P>The city of Quebec was at this time in a &s;tate of great weakne&s;s, as well as internal di&s;content and di&s;|order. The Briti&s;h merchants and inhabitants had been for a long time much di&s;gu&s;ted and di&s;&s;atisfied.
<PB N="549" REF="562">They had oppo&s;ed the Quebec act, and &s;ent petitions to England upon that &s;ubject, which had been griev|ou&s;ly re&s;ented by their own government, and from that period they &s;aid they had been not only &s;lighted and treated with indifference, but even regarded with an apparent eye of di&s;tru&s;t and &s;u&s;picion. They com|plained that as the great political object in that coun|try was to attach the native Canadians inviolably to government, &s;o the French noble&s;&s;e and civil officers became, except the Briti&s;h military, the only favour|ites, and the&s;e having acquired the manners and affec|tion of all other courtiers and favourites, &s;uffered no occa&s;ion to pa&s;s of in&s;ulting the Engli&s;h as malcon|tents, with the violence of their zeal and the outrage|ou&s;ne&s;s of their loyalty. They repre&s;ented that the&s;e new courtiers indu&s;triou&s;ly brought in que&s;tions up|on public affairs and di&s;cour&s;es upon government in their company, and then con&s;trued that freedom which the native Engli&s;h had derived from nature and habit, as well from the pre&s;ent di&s;content, as proceeding from ill de&s;ign and di&s;affection.&mdash; Their complaints upon this head appear to have had a real foundation, and it is a proof how little they were either tru&s;ted or regarded; that when the troops were &s;ent off to Montreal and the Sorrel, to oppo&s;e the other coloni&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding the very alarming &s;tate of public affairs, and that that city, together with the property which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in it, were left expo&s;|ed without a garri&s;on, yet when they applied for leave to be embodied as a militia for its defence, &s;o far were government from complying with their reque&s;t, that they even did not judge them worthy of an an&s;wer. There &s;eems to have been an uniformity to the mea&s;ures of government in all parts of the em|pire,
<PB N="550" REF="563">in di&s;obliging and offending all &s;uch as either whi&s;pered or hinted their regaad to liberty and the con&s;titution. The noble&s;&s;e and the popi&s;h clergy, the&s;e <HI>dupes</HI> to tyranny and <HI>&s;laves</HI> to princes, were now become the favourites of the Briti&s;h government be|cau&s;e they were known to be friends to arbitrary power, and enemies to the common rights of the people. The policy of our court in this prediliction to creatures of its own principles, was far from an|&s;wering the ends which it had in view; the de&s;igns of the mini&s;try were even perceived and di&s;approved by the meane&s;t French pea&s;ant in Canada. Nature, notwith&s;tanding all its corruptions, di&s;po&s;es mankind to love and pur&s;ue liberty, as &s;oon as they perceive it, through all the ranks and degrees of &s;ociety; and it requires a very deep draught of corruption &s;o to intoxicate the mind as to make men love &s;lavery and and oppre&s;&s;ion, when they know that it is their right to be free. Pen&s;ioned ca&s;ui&s;ts, and &s;uch as for the &s;ake of lu&s;t or worldly intere&s;t, have given up con&s;ci|ence, and have lo&s;t the feelings of the moral &s;en&s;e, may varni&s;h the rights of &s;overeigns, and the power of princes with all the fine colourings of &s;ophi&s;try and deceit, and dignify tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion in the hands of monarchs, with the divine epithets of the <HI>powers that be,</HI> or the ordinance of God: but common &s;en&s;e will teach every unprejudiced &s;ubject, that there can be no powers or ordinances derived from divine au|thority that authori&s;es a few to gratify their own pa&s;|&s;ions or appetites, at the expence of the common weal of &s;ociety. What on all occa&s;ions would deter|mine the truth of this point, would be, for the di&s;pu|tants to change &s;ituations, and the friends of arbitrary power to become &s;ubject to it in the hands of others.
<PB N="551" REF="564">A very &s;hort trial would &s;oon alter their &s;entiments.&mdash; If the Deity had ever intended a certain form of go|vernment to have been univer&s;ally adopted, he would have certainly pointed it out in &s;uch a manner as it could not have been mi&s;taken, and given infallible marks of the per&s;ons who were to &s;uperintend it.&mdash; But as this is not the ca&s;e, we have no other me|thod of judging concerning governments, but that of their an&s;wering the end of common weal. When they an&s;wer this end, they are from heaven;&mdash;but when they de&s;troy it, they proceed from another &s;ource.</P>
<P>When Arnold arrived at Quebec, the inhabitants were in a wavering &s;ituation; the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects were di&s;gu&s;ted, and the French were not to be tru&s;t|ed with the defence of the city. There were no troops of any &s;ort in the place till M'Clean's new rai&s;|ed emigants arrived from the Sorrel. Some marines, whom the Governor had &s;ent for from Bo&s;ton, were refu&s;ed by a naval council of war, on account of the latene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, and the danger of navigation. The militia had been lately embodied by the Lieute|nant-governor, and this was the condition of Quebec when Arnold arrived with his party, and appeared at Fort Levi, oppo&s;ite to the town. The river was for|tunately between them, and the boats &s;ecured, other|wi&s;e it appeared highly probable that they would have become ma&s;ters of it in the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e and confu&s;ion. This defect in a few days was &s;upplied by the alacrity of the Canadians, who &s;upplied them with canoes, and they effected their pa&s;&s;age in a dark night, not|with&s;tanding the vigilance of the armed ve&s;&s;els and fri|gates of war in the river. The critical moment was now over, and the inhabitants began to think of
<PB N="552" REF="565">&s;ecuring their property; the di&s;contented, both Eng|li&s;h and Canadians, when the danger pre&s;&s;ed them, united for their common defence. Had the city been taken by &s;urpri&s;e, it is highly probable that the mal|contents would have joined the conquerors; but as it was now doubtful whether they &s;hould &s;ucceed in their enterpri&s;e, they con&s;idered it as the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e to hold with tho&s;e who had the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The in|habitants were embodied and armed, and the &s;ailors landed from the &s;hips to attend the batteries and &s;erve the guns. The be&s;ieged were con&s;iderably &s;uperior in number to the be&s;iegers, and Arnold had no artil|lery.</P>
<P>It is probable that Arnold depended upon the di&s;|affection of the inhabitants, which in ca&s;e he had been able to have taken the town by &s;urpri&s;e, might have been of &s;ervice to his undertaking; but being di&s;ap|pointed in this view, there was nothing that remained practicable for him but intercepting the roads, and cutting off the &s;upplies till Montgomery &s;hould arrive. He made a &s;hew for &s;ome days upon the heights near the town, and &s;ent two flags to &s;ummon the inhabi|tants, but they were fired at and no me&s;&s;age admitted. Upon which he withdrew his detachment into quar|ters of refre&s;hment. Con&s;idering their long and wea|ri&s;ome march, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that they were in much need of &s;ome re&s;t and refre&s;hment: but when we reflect upon their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, it mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t that their re&s;t would be far from being very refre&s;h|ing.</P>
<P>After Montgomery had received large &s;upplies of all nece&s;&s;aries for his men at Montreal, and clothed and refre&s;hed his little army, he &s;et forward to Que|bec. Tho' appearances were greatly on his &s;ide at
<PB N="553" REF="566">this time, his &s;ituation was far from being agreeable. Continual difficulties, and encrea&s;ing hard&s;hips attend|ed him that nothing le&s;s could have &s;urmounted than his own enterpri&s;ing genius. The difficulty of go|verning an army compo&s;ed wholly of new &s;oldiers, and the&s;e led directly from their civil employments to the field, even &s;uppo&s;ing them rai&s;ed in old countries, and where &s;ubordination is the mo&s;t perfectly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, will be conceived by tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t conver&s;ant in military affairs. Montgomery's troops were compo&s;ed of men the mo&s;t unaccu&s;tomed, and who from principles and habit, and manner of life, were the mo&s;t aver&s;e to our ideas of military &s;ubordi|nation, of any people what&s;oever. I cannot howe|ver agree with tho&s;e who affirm, that they are a peo|ple from habit and principle, and manner of life the mo&s;t aver&s;e to every idea of &s;ubordination, of any ci|vilized people in the world. This certainly is not the ca&s;e, for they <HI>then</HI> did and have &s;ince volun|tarily &s;ubmitted to all the rules of military order and di&s;cipline. Had no the army which followed Mont|gomery been influenced with &s;ome more powerful principle than it was po&s;&s;ible for his genius to in&s;pire them with, they would never have endured the fa|tigues, undergone the hard&s;hips, and encountered the dangers which they voluntarily went through.&mdash; It was the &s;pirit of liberty, the animating influence of freedom, and love of independency of a government which they conceived tended to en&s;lave them, that operated more powerfully than the genius of Mont|gomery. It can ea&s;ily be conceived that as they join|ed Montgomery freely and voluntarily, and knew the nature of the expedition they were going upon, that, they had re&s;olved to undergo the dangers and hard|&s;hips
<PB N="554" REF="567">which attended it, in hopes of promoting the great end which the coloni&s;ts had in view. When military men &s;erve from principle, and are actuated by con&s;cience, there will be little need for that &s;evere di&s;cipline which is nece&s;&s;ary to be practi&s;ed among tho&s;e that are either forced into the &s;ervice, or enter into it from principles of idlene&s;s, love of plunder, or other &s;imilar ba&s;e principles. The Roman &s;oldiers in the time of the common wealth, while virtue was pre|dominent in the empire, without force or con&s;traint, &s;erved their country, and maintained good decipline from mutual choice: the &s;oldiers who, were free Romans, and had an intere&s;t in the happine&s;s of their country, as well as the officers, endured hard&s;hips and encountered dangers, not from force, but be|cau&s;e they con&s;idered them&s;elves members of the common wealth, and mutual &s;harers of the honours and privileges which they were fighting for, with the greate&s;t &s;enators of Rome. The provincial troops did not follow Montgomery to Canada for the &s;ake of plunder or from any wanton de&s;ire of laying wa&s;te the country, but to prevent government from making u&s;e of the forces in that quarter, in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the back &s;ettlements of the New England provinces, ; they had therefore determined with them&s;elves before their &s;etting out, to ob&s;erve a &s;trict di&s;cipline as true friends of liberty, avoiding all licentiou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;orders.</P>
<P>General Carleton arrived at Quebec near about the time that Arnold's detachment had retired from its neighbourhood, and immediately took &s;uch mea|&s;ures for its defence, as were &s;uitable to the charac|ter, which he had &s;u&s;tained as a military officer.&mdash;He fir&s;t obliged all tho&s;e with their families to leave the town who refu&s;ed to take up arms in its defence.&mdash;
<PB N="555" REF="568">The garri&s;on, including all orders who did duty, con|&s;i&s;ted of about 1500 men, a number totally unequal to the defence of &s;uch exten&s;ive works, provided they had been attacked by a powerful force &s;upported with thing nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;iege. The be&s;iegers were not more numerous than the be&s;ieged, and were but ill appointed for &s;uch an ardous undertaking;&mdash; their artillery was too light and trifling to demoli&s;h &s;uch works as defended Quebec. Nothing could have rendered their &s;ucce&s;s probable, except a divi|&s;ion among the inhabitants of the town, or a &s;udden attack to have thrown them into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The troops in the town, except one company of the 7th regiment, which had e&s;caped being taken, and were principally recruits, were only a new rai&s;ed mi|litia, unacquainted with, and &s;carcely trained to any form of military di&s;cipline; &s;o that the troops on both &s;ides might have been con&s;idered as nearly equal in their characters. The principal defence of the town re&s;ted in &s;ome marines and about 450 &s;eamen, be|longing to the King's frigates and the merchant &s;hips that wintered in the harbour. The&s;e being accu&s;|tomed to the management of the great guns, and the ready manaeuvres of that &s;ort of exerci&s;e were the real &s;trength of the garri&s;on. There was however a great difference in the intrepidity of both the troops and officers of the parties; the towns men were not all well affected to the Governor; for though they had through nece&s;&s;ity taken up arms for fear of &s;ome ill con&s;equences, or becau&s;e they thought it impo&s;&s;i|ble for the provincials to take the town, yet in their hearts they wi&s;hed well to their cau&s;e, and would not have been ill plea&s;ed if they had &s;ucceded. The o|ther had marched with the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;olution to ful|fil
<PB N="556" REF="569">the end for which they were &s;ent, and were in ge|neral of an intrepid and daring di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Montgomery, having left &s;ome troops in Montreal and the forts, and &s;ent detachments into the different parts of the province to encourage the Canadians, as well as to forward &s;upplies of provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;a|ries, pu&s;hed on with as many men as could be &s;pared, and &s;uch artillery as he could procure, to join Ar|nold. Their march was in winter, through bad roads, in a &s;evere climate, beneath the fall of the fir&s;t &s;nows, and therefore made under great hard&s;hips; which they howevere encountered with equal re&s;olution, and arrived with incredible expedition at Quebec.</P>
<P>It was upon the twenty-fifth day of December when Montgomery appeared before the town, when he wrote a letter to the Governor, magnifying his own &s;trength, &s;tating the weakne&s;s of the garri&s;on, &s;hewing the impo&s;&s;ibility of relief, and recommending an immediate &s;urrender, to avoid the con&s;equences which mu&s;t attend a &s;torm, from victorious troops ir|ritated with the injurious treatment which they had in various in&s;tances received at their hand. The flag which carried this letter was fired at, as well as every other which was &s;ent, &s;o that all communication was totally forbidden between the be&s;iegers and the inha|bitants, by the Governor. Notwith&s;tanding of this &s;trict guard, Montgomery found other means to con|vey a letter of the &s;ame nature and import into the town; but this had no effect upon the Governor, who remained firm and inflexible, in &s;pite of all threaten|ings. It appears &s;ome what of a &s;trange adventure in Montgomery, to inve&s;t a fortified place with a num|ber of troops not &s;uperior to tho&s;e that defended it, either in quantity or quality. His only pro&s;pect of
<PB N="557" REF="570">&s;ucce&s;s feems to have depended upon the effect which his warlike preparations and the violence of his attack might have upon the inhabitants of the town, who being ha&s;tily embodied were but a very motley garri&s;on; or in ca&s;e he &s;hould fail in an a&s;&s;ault, to weary them out with continued and fal&s;e alarms.&mdash; He accordingly commenced a bombardment with five &s;mall mortars, which continued for &s;ome days, and might have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;truck terror into the minds of the people, and to have intimidated the town into a &s;urrender; but the intrepidity of the Governor, &s;upported by the bravery of the general officers, as the activity of the &s;eamen and marines, prevent this effect. The garri&s;on in general behaved with great bravery, and nobly followed the example of their officers, and endured incommodities, wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es incident to &s;o long a &s;iege, with wonder|ful &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>General Montgomery in a few days opened a &s;ix gun battery, about 700 yards di&s;tance from the walls, but his metal was too light to produce any con&s;ider|able effect. The walls of Quebec were not &s;o ea&s;ily battered down as to give way to &s;uch a feeble force as that of a few &s;mall pieces, more adapted to the field than fitted for a &s;iege. Meanwhile the &s;now lay deep upon the ground, and &s;uch was &s;everity of the climate, that human nature &s;eemed incapable of with&s;tanding its force in the open field.&mdash;The hard&s;hips of the provincials, both ari&s;ing from the &s;ea|&s;on and the &s;mallne&s;s of their numbers, &s;eemed incre|dible, and could only be endured through an enthu&s;i|a&s;tic adherence to their cau&s;e, aad the affectionate e|&s;teem they had for their general, who bore fatigue and encountered danger equally with them&s;elves. This
<PB N="558" REF="571">con&s;tancy was likely to fail provided the evil &s;hould en|crea&s;e or continue too long, human nature mu&s;t have yielded to difficulties which were totally un&s;upport|able in their then &s;ituation. An excu&s;e for relin|qui&s;hing this project was &s;oon likely to happen, as the time was near expired for which every man of the &s;oldiers had been li&s;ted; and it was mo&s;t likely that the feelings of nature, and the future pro&s;pect of dan|ger, would prevail over their enthu&s;ia&s;m, and make them take the advantage of the opportunity of re|turning home according to their agreement. This would have totally broke up Montgomery's little ar|my. The New York troops felt the &s;everity of the cli|mate, and did not &s;hew &s;o much &s;teadine&s;s and per&s;eve|rence, as the hardy New Englandmen who had tra|ver&s;ed the de&s;art with Arnold. The&s;e &s;hewed an a|mazing con&s;tancy and intrepidity. Montgomery in the&s;e circum&s;tances found that &s;omething deci&s;ive be|hoved immediately to be done, otherwi&s;e the benefit of his pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;s and labour, would be in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t to the cau&s;e he was engaged in, and his fame and reputation, which now &s;hone with the greate&s;t lu&s;tre, would be dimmed, if not totally ob&s;cured. He knew that the Americans depended greatly upon his conduct and valour, and would con&s;ider Quebec as good as taken as &s;oon as they heard that he was ar|rived before it, and that the higher their expectations were rai&s;ed, the more grievous the di&s;appointment would be to them, in ca&s;e the undertaking was fru|&s;trated. Their confidence of &s;ucce&s;s was founded upon the high opinion which they held of his cou|rage and ability. : to forfeit that opinion was to him the wor&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences. To &s;torm the city with an army not &s;uperior to the garri&s;on which
<PB N="559" REF="572">defended it, con&s;idering al&s;o the natural &s;trength of the place which in the common way of &s;peaking was reckoned impregnable, was a de&s;perate undertaking. But per&s;ons who have their minds po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the romantic ideas of honour in war, &s;eldom e&s;timate dan|ger by the &s;trict rules of prudence; but provided the honours in view be great, &s;eldom attend minute|ly to the dangers which lye in the way of the object. In the hi&s;tory of military achievements in all ages we find that the &s;ucce&s;s of great attempts have depended upon a noble contempt of forms and ordinary calcu|lations. Providence, in contempt of human pride, ever was, and ever will be, the great arbiter in war. Montgomery depending much upon fortune, and al|&s;o upon the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the garri&s;on, determined on a de&s;perate attempt to carry the place by &s;caling the walls.</P>
<P>As in the mo&s;t perfect &s;ociety upon earth there have been found traitors, &s;o in this army of provinci|als there were &s;ome who betrayed the purpo&s;es of the General to the garri&s;on of Quebec. Some de|&s;erters, either through de&s;ign, or to make their peace with the Governor, informed the be&s;ieged of the de|&s;ign of the General. This he was fortunate enough to perceive, from the motions of the town&s;men, who had not only been informed of his de&s;ign in general, but of the particular manner of carrying it into exe|cution. This unfortunate circum&s;tance di&s;concerted his whole plan, and made him change his di&s;po&s;itions, which had a con&s;iderable influence on the &s;ucceeding events. Had he &s;ucceeded in his fir&s;t &s;cheme, and made good a lodgment in the city in any part that was unguarded, there would have been a &s;evere &s;truggle for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and it is not impro|bable
<PB N="560" REF="573">that Quebec would have been taken, notwith|&s;tanding the vigilence and activity of the Governor. Montgomery being fru&s;trated in his plan of operation, proceeded to attack the town according to a new plan. Upon the la&s;t day of the year 1775, and un|der the cover of a violent &s;torm of &s;now, he proceed|ed to this ardous attempt. Having di&s;po&s;ed his little army into four divi&s;ions, of which two carried on fal&s;e attacks again&s;t the upper town, whil&s;t him&s;elf and Arnold conducted two real ones again&s;t oppo&s;ite 0 parts of the tower. By this means the alarm was general, in both towns, and might have di&s;concerted the mo&s;t experienced troops. From the &s;ide of the of the river St. Lawrence, and round to the Ba&s;on, every part &s;eemed equally threatened and equally in danger.</P>
<P>About five o'clock, Montgomery, at the head of the New York troops, advanced again&s;t the lower town, at a place called Aunce de Mere under Cape Diamond: but for &s;ome difficulties which had inter|vened in his approach, the &s;ignal for engaging had been given, and the garri&s;on alarmed before he could reach the place. He notwith&s;tanding pre&s;&s;ed on in a narrow file upon a &s;canty path, with a precipice to the river on one &s;ide, and an hanging above him which in a manner projected over him. Having &s;eized and pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t barrier, accompanied by a few of his brave&s;t of men and officers, he marched boldly at the head of his detachment to attack the &s;econd. This was much &s;tronger than the fir&s;t, and had &s;everal can|non loaded with grape &s;hot. From this much execu|tion was done upon the a&s;&s;ailants; both the cannon and mu&s;ketry were well directed, and from this bar|rier or battery Montgomery was killed, and fini&s;hed
<PB N="561" REF="574">his military career; he fell together with his Aid-de camp, and &s;everal officers; and the mo&s;t of tho&s;e that were near his per&s;on lay dead upon the &s;pot. Upon the fall of Montgomery, the command devolved up|on one Campbell, who retired immediately, without making any further attempt to proceed.&mdash;It was thought by the coloni&s;ts that Campbell yielded too ea&s;ily to the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and that had he continu|ed the attack as re&s;olutely as Montgomery began it, as they were now clo&s;e at the battery, and might have taken it with little lo&s;s, that the town would have fallen into their hands.&mdash;For as Arnold was gaining ground in that quarter which he attacked, had Campbell pu&s;hed the attack as he might have done, it would have prevented the Governor from em|ploying the forces in that part of the town again&s;t Arnold's divi&s;ion, which were already victorious, and would have di&s;tracted the town&s;men, that they would not have had time to had paid attention to the pro|gre&s;s of the other divi&s;ion of the provincials.</P>
<P>While things were carried on this quarter as has been mentioned, Arnold was not idle in pu&s;hing mat|ters as far as he could in the department a&s;&s;igned to him. With an intrepidity that would have done honour to the mo&s;t veteran troops, this divi&s;ion at|tacked that part of the town called the Saut, at Mate|lot, and having penetrated through St Roques, they attacked a well defended battery, which they carried after an hour's &s;harp engagement with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. It was here that their commander was wound|ed, his leg was &s;hattered by a &s;hot, and they were o|bliged to carry him to the camp; but the&s;e troops did not retreat ha&s;tily upon the departure of the com|mander, as the New York detachment did; his place
<PB N="562" REF="575">was &s;upplied by other officers, who with no le&s;s in|trepidity carried on the attack, and the men &s;hewed a re&s;olution on that occa&s;ion equal to the olde&s;t and mo&s;t regular forces. They were as yet ignorant of Montgomery's misfortune, and were &s;o far from being dejected with their own, that they pu&s;hed on with greater vigour, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of ano|ther battery. Had all the provincial troops on this occa&s;ion been equal to tho&s;e of New England, not|with&s;tanding all the misfortunes they &s;u&s;tained by the lo&s;s of their general officers, they would certainly have taken the town that very day. The New York forces certainly behaved but ill in precipitately re|treating upon the death of their General, for had they continued to have made a diver&s;ion in that part of the town where they were appointed to &s;erve, they would have prevented the garri&s;on from attacking Arnold's party in the rear, which would have been of great con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Upon Campbell's retreat, the garri&s;on had now time to turn their whole attention to Arnold's divi&s;ion, and perceived they had now an occa&s;ion offered of cutting their retreat off. The &s;ituation of the a&s;&s;ailants was now &s;uch that in attempting a retreat, they had to pa&s;s a con&s;iderable way within fifty yards of the walls, expo&s;ed to the whole fire of the garri&s;on. And what rendered their fate ineveitable was, a con&s;idera|ble detachment with &s;everal field pieces i&s;&s;ued thro' a gate which commanded that pa&s;&s;age, and attacked them furiou&s;ly in the rear, while they were already fully employed in every other part, by the troops which poured upon them in every other quarter. In the&s;e de&s;perate circum&s;tances, without a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape, attacked on all &s;ides, and under every di&s;ad|vantage
<PB N="563" REF="576">of ground, as well as numbers, they ob&s;ti|nately defended them&s;elves for three hours, and at la&s;t &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war. A greater in&s;tance of bravery has not been exhibited by any veteran troops on almo&s;t any occa&s;ion, and provided they had not been under the predicament of rebellion, would have had the honour of being extolled as the greate&s;t heroes in the Gazette. The Governor treated the pri&s;oners with great humanity, and it was thought a thing more extraordinary that he pu&s;ued &s;uch lene|tive mea&s;ures, &s;eeing he had been long habituated to the &s;everity of a military life. This ob&s;ervation &s;ug|ge&s;ts an idea in no wi&s;e friendly to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume a military character, and pur&s;ue war as a profe&s;&s;ion;&mdash;&s;uch a manner of life hardens the human heart, and renders the feelings of the &s;oul callous to the pains and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our fellow-creatures. The profe&s;&s;ion of arms ought certainly only to be occa&s;ional, when there is a &s;pecial call to defend our&s;elves and property again&s;t unju&s;t claims and a&s;&s;aults;&mdash;but it ought never to be the &s;tudy of a man's life, and the con&s;tant theme of his practice. Such as go volun|teers to foreign wars, in which they are in no wi&s;e in|tere&s;ted, only for the &s;ake of learning to &s;hed blood, can only be con&s;idered as profe&s;&s;ional butchers, go|ing abroad to learn their bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;After the death of Montgomery, all enmity again&s;t him ari&s;ing from party animo&s;ity cea&s;ed, and re&s;pect to his private cha|racter prevailed over every other con&s;ideration; his dead body received every po&s;&s;ible mark of di&s;tinction from the victors, and was interred at Quebec with all the military honours due to a brave &s;oldier. By comparing the different accounts and circum&s;tances &s;ub&s;equent to the engagement, the provincials in
<PB N="564" REF="577">killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, did not lo&s;e fewer than half of their number. This appears from a let|ter of General Arnold, written &s;oon after,&mdash;which &s;tates their remaining number at only 700 men.</P>
<P>Thus fell Richard Montgomery in the cau&s;e of li|berty, fighting as he believed, and as unbia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on will in after ages determine, for the rights of hu|man nature and of his country, again&s;t the illegal en|croachments of a Briti&s;h mini&s;try, who by mi&s;leading their mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, the rightful prince and monarch of a va&s;t empire, procured by the energy of &s;ome invi&s;ible influence, the &s;anction of legi&s;lative au|thority, to oppre&s;s the &s;ubjects, contrary to the fund|amental &s;tatutes of a noble and well-poi&s;ed con&s;titu|tion.&mdash;He died in modern &s;tile, a rebel; but no other|wi&s;e de&s;erved that character than Ru&s;&s;el and Sidney, names which will ever live, while there are any per|&s;ons living who value the glorious Revolution and love liberty. He was a gentleman of a good family in the kingdom of Ireland, and &s;erved with reputation in the la&s;t war with France and Spain: He fell in the prime of life, much lamented by his friends, and even prai&s;ed by his enemies. His many and excellent qualities, and agreeable di&s;po&s;ition, had procured him an uncommon &s;hare of both public and private e&s;teem, and there was perhaps no per&s;on engaged on the &s;ame &s;ide, and few on either, who&s;e lo&s;s would have been more regretted both in Britain and America.&mdash;He was a real and firm lover of liberty, and his ene|mies could never with ju&s;tice accu&s;e him of being a friend to licentiou&s;ne&s;s; he had &s;tudied and under|&s;tood the true principles of liberty, believed their real value, and counted nothing too dear in &s;upport|ing of them. He married a lady, and purcha&s;ed an
<PB N="565" REF="578">e&s;tate in New York, and on this account induced to con&s;ider him&s;elf as American. When he perceived the mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try with regard to his country directly overturning what he believed to be the colony con&s;titution, he joined in oppo&s;ing them, not from wrath, but principle. He was led from &s;entiment and full per&s;ua&s;ion, that it was his du|ty to quit the &s;weets of an ea&s;y fortune, the enjoy|ment of a loved and philo&s;ophic rural life, with the highe&s;t dome&s;tic felicity, to take a &s;hare in all the mi|&s;eries and dangers of tho&s;e troubles which have been already &s;o baneful to the empire. He had undoubt|edly great military abilities, though in the attempt in which he fell he was un&s;ucce&s;sful. It is much to be lamented that a man of &s;o great abilities, and &s;o well formed to &s;upport the glory of his country, &s;hould have fallen in a mo&s;t unnatural civil conte&s;t. In Ame|rica he was revered and extolled as a martyr to the cau&s;e of human nature and the liberties of mankind. What was more extraordinary, the mo&s;t eminent ora|tors in the Briti&s;h &s;enate, di&s;played their eloquence in prai&s;ing his virtues and lamenting his fate. A great &s;peaker, who&s;e eloquence has often been admired, a veteran fellow-&s;oldier of Montgomery in the late war, &s;hed abundance of tears whil&s;t he expatiated on their pa&s;t friend&s;hip and participation of &s;ervice in that &s;ea|&s;on of enterpri&s;e and glory. Even the mini&s;ter ex|tolled his virtues, whil&s;t he condemned the rebellious cau&s;e they were employed in, and the fatal effects which their mi&s;taken application had produced. In this prai&s;e of the mini&s;ter there is &s;omething exceed|ingly my&s;terious, for it &s;uppo&s;es what can never hap|pen, namely, that virtue can be applied to rebellious purpo&s;es. When a man is really engaged in what is
<PB N="566" REF="579">truly rebellion, that which &s;ome people call virtue is no more than vicious exertions of the mind again&s;t truth. If Montgomery's application of the powers of his mind and body was employed in &s;upporting rebellion in the true &s;en&s;e of the word, in&s;tead of be|ing reckoned virtuous, he ought to have been ac|counted a per&s;on de&s;titute of all true &s;en&s;e of moral virtue. But it would appear that the mini&s;ter had a different opinion, and mu&s;t have had &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of the exi&s;tence of Montgomery's rebellion.</P>
<P>Governor Carleton and his officers acquired great honour by the defence they made, and the behaviour of the garri&s;on would have done honour to veteran troops. It &s;hews how far the example of a few brave officers will operate to render the rawe&s;t and wor&s;t formed troops re&s;pectable. The Governor is allow|ed on all hands to be one of the fir&s;t military charac|ters of the age, and on this occa&s;ion he by no means tarni&s;hed the reputation he had formerly acquired.</P>
<P>After the un&s;ucce&s;sful attack of Quebec, the be|&s;iegers immediately quitted their camp, and retired about three miles out of the city, where they &s;ecured and &s;trengthened their quarters as well as they were able, being apprehen&s;ive of an attack from the garri|&s;on; but the one was as unfit for pur&s;uing, as the o|thers were to have endured a &s;evere attack. The Governor wi&s;ely contented him&s;elf with the unex|pected advantage he had obtained, without hazard|ing the fate of the province, and perhaps of America, by a ra&s;h and uncertain enterpri&s;e. The city was now out of danger, and the great &s;uccours which were expected would not fail to relieve the whole province. Arnold, who now commanded in chief, upon the death of Montgomery was far from being
<PB N="567" REF="580">in an eligible &s;ituation; the climate was uncommonly cold and the weather &s;evere; the hope of a&s;&s;i&s;tance was di&s;tant, and the arrival of &s;uccours of con&s;e|quence &s;low. Notwith&s;tanding the provincials with an a&s;toni&s;hing per&s;everence bore every hard&s;hip.&mdash;They had lo&s;t their commander in chief, the be&s;t of their officers, and &s;ome of the brave&s;t of their men, with a part of their &s;mall artillery: they could not de|pend upon the Canadians, who&s;e ficklene&s;s rendered it un&s;afe to depend upon, and whom &s;ucce&s;s or di&s;ap|pointment were equally ready to influence. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, it required no &s;mall &s;hare of addre&s;s and activity to keep together &s;uch an army, where their hopes were &s;mall and their danger multiplying. Ge|neral Arnold, who had hitherto di&s;played uncommon abilities in his march into Canada, di&s;covered on this occa&s;ion the utmo&s;t vigour of a determined mind, and a genius full of re&s;ources. Wounded and defeated as he was, he put his troops in &s;uch a condition as to keep them &s;till formidable; and in&s;tead of appear|ing as one who had met with a defeat, he continued to threaten the city, by turning the &s;iege into a bloc|kade, and effectually to ob&s;truct the arrival of all &s;up|plies of provi&s;ions and nece&s;&s;aries into the town. He di&s;patched an expre&s;s to General Woo&s;ter, who was at Montreal, to bring &s;uccours, and take upon him the command; but as this was not immediately to be done, he &s;upported him&s;elf again&s;t the difficulties that &s;urrounded him with the force which he had. It ap|pears from the whole of his operations that the Go|vernor con&s;idered it as a dangerous expedient to at|tack Arnold in the open field, though he had near double the number of his forces, and that provided it had been in the power of General Woo&s;ter to have
<PB N="568" REF="581">&s;ent a &s;uitable reinforcement, the fate of Quebec would have &s;till been doubtful. Had not Arnold been wounded, notwith&s;tanding the death of Mont|gomery, it is not improbable that Quebec would have been taken that evening. It was certainly a bold adventure for fo few troops to make &s;uch a dar|ing attack upon a fortified place, by many reckoned impregnable again&s;t any force what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The march of the New England troops from Gar|diner's Town to Quebec, may be con&s;idered as one of tho&s;e amazing exertions of conduct and intrepedity, which could only be undertaken by a great mind, and executed by a people willing to &s;ubmit to every hard|&s;hip for the &s;ake of freedom and liberty. A multi|tude of men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch ideas, di&s;po&s;ing them voluntarily to encounter &s;uch hard&s;hips and difficulties, can never be &s;ubdued by any power on earth, with|out fir&s;t conquering their exi&s;tence, and extirpating them from the face of the ground. The mo&s;t ro|mantic notions of military glory and honour will never determine a multitude of per&s;ons freely and voluntarily, without any hope of pre&s;ent advantage, to encounter &s;uch great immediate hard&s;hips and diffi|culties. The famous retreat of Xenophon with ten thou&s;and Greeks, which is famous in hi&s;tory, was an effort of nece&s;&s;ity, which is the parent of invention, and the long and dangerous march which was con|ducted with &s;o much wi&s;dom and intrepidity was un|dertaken and pur&s;ued for immediate &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. But the march of Arnold through the American de|farts was undertaken for the &s;ake of the general cau&s;e of liberty as they believed, and with a de&s;ign to pre|vent a power which they thought inimical to the rights of mankind from en&s;laving their country.&mdash;Men
<PB N="569" REF="582">of different opinions concerning the policy of nations will judge differently with regard to this ex|pedition; but whether they determine the ends of it good or evil, all mu&s;t allow, that it was a great under|taking, and conducted with much intrepidity. After the fermentation of party zeal has &s;ub&s;ided, and men cooly con&s;ider the actions of others and their princi|ples, they will be obliged to confe&s;s that the march of Colonel Arnold and his troops is one of the greate&s;t exploits recorded in the annals of nations, whether the way in which they marched, the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the &s;everity of the climate, and the many other di&s;advantages and hard&s;hips which attended them are con&s;idered. They were only new &s;oldiers who had but lately taken up arms for the defence of their li|berties, and had never been accu&s;tomed to the hard|&s;hips of war; they were led through a wilderne&s;s un|explored by human eye, where there was no paths, and through thickets almo&s;t impenetrable, and &s;wamps next to impa&s;&s;ible. They had no po&s;&s;ibility of obtain|ing any more provi&s;ions than they carried with them, till they came to Canada, either by force or other|wi&s;e, and it was uncertain when they &s;hould arrive there. It required an amazing re&s;olution to deter|mine men to engage in &s;uch evident and unavoidable hard&s;hips already fore&s;een, and pre&s;ented to their minds.</P>

<HEAD>A VIRGINIA CHARTER. KING JAMES I.'s Letters patent to Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers and others,&mdash;for two &s;everal Colonies and Plantations, to be made in Virginia, and other parts and territories of America. Dated April 10, 1606.</HEAD>
