In fact, Aldrovan|dus
<PB N="7" REF="18">
and Olina wrote in the climate of Italy; but Fri&s;ch, who&s;e ob&s;ervations apply to Ger|many, mentions only two hatches annually; and Schwenckfeld takes notice of one only in Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>The young keep at a little di&s;tance from each other; for the mother does not always gather them under her wings. She flutters over their heads, watches them with a truly maternal affection, directing their motions, an|ticipating their wants, and guarding them from danger.</P>
<P>The in&s;tinctive warmth of attachment which the female &s;ky-lark bears to her young, often di&s;covers it&s;elf at a very early period; and even before &s;he is capable of di&s;charging the functions of a mother, which might be &s;up|po&s;ed to precede, in the order of nature, the maternal &s;olicitude. A young hen-bird was brought to me in the month of May, which was not able to feed without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I cau&s;ed it to be educated, and it was hardly fledged when I received, from another place, a ne&s;t of three or four callow &s;ky-larks. She took a &s;trong liking to the&s;e new-comers, which were &s;carcely younger than her&s;elf; &s;he tended them night and day, cheri&s;hed them beneath her wings, and fed them with her bill. Nothing could divert her tender offices: if the young were torn from her, &s;he flew back to them as &s;oon as &s;he was liberated, and would not think
<PB N="8" REF="19">
of effecting her own e&s;cape, which &s;he might have done an hundred times. Her affection grew upon her; &s;he neglected food and drink; &s;he now required the &s;ame &s;upport as her adopt|ed offspring, and expired at la&s;t, con&s;umed with maternal anxiety. None of the young ones &s;urvived her; they died one after another: &s;o e&s;&s;ential were her cares, which were equally tender and judicious.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common food of the young &s;ky-larks is worms, caterpillars, ants eggs, and even gra&s;shoppers; which has ju&s;tly procured them much regard in countries &s;ubject to the ravages of the&s;e de&s;tructive in&s;ects <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch <HI>de I&s;ide.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>In Flanders, the young ones are fed with moi&s;tened poppy-&s;eeds; and after they can eat without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they are pre&s;ented with crumbs of bread, likewi&s;e &s;oaked: but when they be|gin to &s;ing, they are given &s;heeps' and calves' hearts ha&s;hed with hard eggs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Albin.</NOTE>; and to this are added, wheat, &s;pelt, and oats previou&s;ly cleaned, millet, lin&s;eed, and the &s;eeds of poppy and hemp, the whole being &s;teeped in milk <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Olina<HI>&mdash;De&s;cription of</HI> 300 <HI>Animals&mdash;</HI>Fri&s;ch.</NOTE>.

In &s;ummer, on the contrary, they are very lean: then they always go in pairs, eat &s;paringly, &s;ing ince&s;&s;antly, and never alight but to hold the dalliance of love. During &s;evere weather, par|ticularly when much &s;now has fallen, they re|&s;ort to the margins of the &s;prings, where the fro&s;t does not prevail; in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, they crop the gra&s;s, and are even obliged to &s;eek their food among the hor&s;e-dung which is dropt on the high roads: yet notwith&s;tanding, they are &s;till fatter than in any part of the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>They mount in the air almo&s;t perpendicularly, and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;prings, and hover at a va&s;t height.

The Chevalier des Mazis informs me, that the larks pa&s;s the i&s;land of Malta in the month of November; and though he does not &s;pecify the particular kinds, the &s;ky-lark is probably one of them: for Lottinger has ob&s;erved, that a con&s;iderable flight of &s;ky-larks into Lorraine, cea&s;es exactly at this time; and that as tho&s;e bred in the coun|try join the train of their vi&s;itors, few &s;tay be|hind; but that &s;hortly after, the u&s;ual numbers again appear, whether that others &s;ucceed to their place, or that they return back, which is the more probable &s;uppo&s;ition. However, it is certain that they do not entirely migrate, &s;ince they are found at all &s;ea&s;ons in our pro|vince; and con&s;iderable numbers of them are caught in Beauce, Picardy, and many other parts, during winter. It is indeed the general opinion, in the&s;e places, that they are not birds of pa&s;&s;age. If they be ab&s;ent for a few days during the exce&s;&s;ive cold weather, e&s;pecially

<P>Every per&s;on knows the various contrivan|ces for catching larks; the noo&s;e, the trammel, the &s;pringe, the draw-net, &amp;c; but the engine mo&s;t commonly employed, is what is called the <HI>lark-net.</HI> A cool morning gladdened by a bright &s;un, is cho&s;en for the &s;port; a mirror that turns freely on its pivots is provided, and a pair of &s;ky-larks are u&s;ed as calls; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to imitate their &s;ong &s;o clo&s;ely as to deceive them, and hence they li&s;ten to no artificial &s;ub|&s;titute.

After all the&s;e limed-rods are planted, an oblong &s;quare is traced, which pre&s;ents one of its &s;ides to the ground where the larks are lodged; and at each corner a flag is fixed, which &s;erves the fowlers as a mark, and &s;ometimes as a &s;ignal for their manoeuvres. The number of per&s;ons em|ployed mu&s;t be proportioned to the extent of the field.&mdash;About four or five o'clock in the afternoon, according as the autumn is more or le&s;s advanced, the company divides into two equal detachments, each conducted by an intelligent leader, who is likewi&s;e &s;ubject to the direc|tion of the commander in chief, who&s;e &s;ta|tion is in the centre.

In fact, it is a true &s;ky-lark, which according to Fri&s;ch comes from the north, like the white &s;parrow and &s;tare, the white &s;wallow and petty-chaps, &amp;c. in all which the plumage retains the impre&s;&s;ion of their natal climate. Klein rejects this opinion, becau&s;e at Dantzic, which is &s;ituated farther north than the countries where white larks &s;ome|times appear, not one has been found in the cour&s;e of half a century. If I were to decide this point, I &s;hould &s;ay that the a&s;&s;ertion of
<PB N="19" REF="30">
Fri&s;ch, that all the white larks arrive from the boreal tracts, is too general, and that the ob|jection which Klein makes is by no means conclu&s;ive. In fact, ob&s;ervations evince that white larks are found in other countries be&s;ides tho&s;e of the north; but it is obvious that from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, they could more ea&s;ily enter the we&s;tern part of Germany, which is &s;eparated from the&s;e countries by only a narrow &s;ea, than cro&s;s the Baltic, and reach the mouth of the Vi&s;tula and the coa&s;ts of Pru&s;&s;ia.&mdash;At any rate, be&s;ides the white larks &s;ometimes found near Berlin according to Fri&s;ch, they are often &s;een in the vicinity of Hilde&s;heim in Lower Saxony. They are &s;eldom of a &s;nowy white; the &s;ubject examined by Bri&s;&s;on was tinged with yellow; but the bill, the feet, and the nails were entirely white.&mdash;At the very time when I was writing this article, a white lark was brought to me, which was &s;hot under the walls of the little town where I live: the crown of the head and &s;ome parts of the body were of the ordinary colour; the re&s;t of the upper &s;urface, including the tail and the wings, was variegated with brown and white; mo&s;t of the plumage and even the quills were edged with white; the under part of the body was white, &s;peckled with brown, e&s;pecially the fore part, and the right &s;ide; the lower mandible whiter than the upper, and the feet of a dirty white, variegated with brown. This &s;ubject
<PB N="20" REF="31">
&s;eemed to form the intermediate &s;hade between the common lark and that which is of a pure white.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince &s;een another lark who&s;e plumage was perfectly white, except on the head, where there were &s;ome traces of a grey but half effaced. It was found in the neighbourhood of Mont|bard. It is not likely that either this or the other lark came from the northern &s;hores of the Baltic.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE BLACK SKY-LARK. I join Bri&s;&s;on in con&s;idering this as a variety of the common &s;ky-lark; whether we are to impute it to the bird's feeding on hemp-&s;eed, or to any other cau&s;e. The &s;ubject which I have directed to be engraved was of a rufous brown at the ri&s;e of the back, and its feet of a light brown.</P>
<P>Albin, who &s;aw and de&s;cribed this bird from nature, repre&s;ents it entirely of a dull brown and reddi&s;h, verging to black; except however the back of the head, which is of a dun yellow, and below the belly, where there are &s;ome fea|thers edged with white; the feet, the toes, and the nails were of a dirty yellow. The &s;ubject from which Albin formed his de&s;cription was caught with a net in a meadow near Highgate; and it appears that there &s;uch birds are &s;eldom met with.</P>
<P>Mauduit a&s;&s;ures me that he &s;aw a lark which was perfectly black, and had been caught in the plain of Mont-rouge near Paris.</P>

<P>HAD not this bird been brought by Com|mer&s;on from Buenos-Ayres; were it not much &s;maller than our common &s;ky-lark, and a native of a very different climate, the re&s;em|blance of its plumage is &s;o &s;triking that we could not help con&s;idering it as only a variety of the preceding &s;pecies. The head, the bill, the feet, the throat, the fore part of the neck, and all the under &s;urface of the body, are of a blacki&s;h brown; the quills of the wings and of the tail are of a &s;omewhat lighter &s;hade; the outermo&s;t of the&s;e la&s;t are edged with rufous; the hind part of the tail, the back, and the &s;houlders, are of an orange fulvous; the &s;mall and middle coverts of the wings blacki&s;h, edged al&s;o with fulvous.</P>

<P>I CONCEIVE this bird to differ &s;o much from the common lark as to con&s;titute a di&s;tinct &s;pecies. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed by its &s;ize and its general form, being &s;horter, rounder, and much &s;maller, not weighing more than an ounce: by its plumage, who&s;e colours are more dilute, le&s;s mixed with white, and its whiti&s;h crown is more con&s;picuous than in the ordinary &s;pecies: by the dimen&s;ions too of its wing quills, the fir&s;t and outermo&s;t being half an inch &s;horter than the re&s;t. It is di&s;criminated from the &s;ky-lark al&s;o by its habits: it perches on trees, though only indeed on the thick branches, becau&s;e the length of its hind too, or rather the projection and &s;light curvature of the nail, will not permit it to cling to the twigs: it haunts
<PB N="24" REF="36">
the uncultivated tracts near cop&s;es, or even the verge of young cop&s;es; and hence the name of <HI>wood-lark,</HI> though it never penetrates into the woods. Its &s;ong too re&s;embles more the war|ble of the nightingale than that of the &s;ky|lark <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina and Albin.</NOTE>; and is heard not only in the day, but, like the former, in the night; both when it flutters on the wing and when it &s;its on a bough. Hebert ob&s;erves, that the fifers of the Swi&s;s guards imitate well its notes; hence I conclude, that this bird is common among the moun|tains of Switzerland <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am informed that it actually frequents the highe&s;t meadows in Switzerland.</NOTE>, as in tho&s;e of Bugey. Its fecundity is inferior to that of the &s;ky-lark; for, though it al&s;o lays four or five eggs, and is not &s;o much de&s;troyed, becau&s;e &s;maller and le&s;s valued, yet its numbers are not &s;o great <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Briti&s;h Zoology.</NOTE>.

It is be&s;ides more delicate; for, ac|cording to Albin, it is impo&s;&s;ible to rear the young taken out of the ne&s;t. But this holds only in regard to England, and other &s;imilar or colder climates; and Olina po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that in Italy the young are removed from the

<P>In every other property the wood-lark bears a clo&s;e analogy to the &s;ky-lark. It mounts high, warbling its notes, and hovers in the air: it flies in flocks during the winter colds: it builds its ne&s;t on the ground, and conceals it under a turf: it lives ten or twelve years: it feeds on beetles, caterpillars, and &s;eeds: its tongue is forked; its &s;tomach mu&s;cular and fle&s;hy: and it has no craw, but a moderate di|latation of the lower part of the <HI>oe&s;ophagus:</HI> its <HI>caeca</HI> are very &s;mall <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Olina remarks that, in the male, the crown of the head is darker than in the female, and its hind nail longer. He might have al&s;o added, that its brea&s;t is more &s;potted, and its great wing quills edged with olive, while, in the female, they are bordered with gray. He &s;ubjoins, that the wood-lark is caught in the &s;ame manner as the &s;ky-lark, which is true; but he pretends that this &s;pecies is hardly known out of the Pope's territories, which is ju&s;tly controverted by the be&s;t informed modern naturali&s;ts. In fact, it would &s;eem that the wood-lark is not confined to any one country:
<PB N="26" REF="38">
it is found in Sweden <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE> and Italy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>, and is probably &s;pread through the intervening coun|tries, and con&s;equently &s;cattered over the greate&s;t part of Europe <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus.</NOTE>.&mdash;The wood-lark is pretty fat in autumn, and is then excellent meat.</P>
<P>Albin &s;ays, that there are three &s;ea&s;ons for catching the wood-larks. The fir&s;t is in the &s;um|mer, when the &s;mall branchers begin to chirp, before they undergo the moulting.&mdash;The &s;e|cond is in the month of September, when they fly in flocks, and roam from one country to another, roving over the pa&s;ture grounds, and perching on trees near lime-kilns <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Kramer.</NOTE>. At this time the young birds change their plumage, and are no longer to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the old ones.&mdash;The third &s;ea&s;on, and the mo&s;t fa|vourable for catching the wood-larks, begins with the month of January <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">M. Hebert killed the&s;e birds during winter in Brie, in Picardy, and in Burgundy: he remarked that, during this &s;ea&s;on, they are found on the ground in the plains, that they are pretty common in Bugey, and &s;till more &s;o in Burgundy. On the other hand, M. Lottinger a&s;&s;erts that they arrive about the end of February, and retire in the beginning of October. But the&s;e oppo&s;ite accounts might be reconciled, if of the&s;e larks, as of the common &s;ort, &s;ome are migratory and others &s;tationary.</NOTE>, and la&s;ts till the end of February, when they &s;eparate to pair.

<P>BELON and Olina mention this as the &s;malle&s;t of all the larks; but they were unacquainted with the gra&s;hopper-lark, of which we &s;hall afterwards &s;peak. The tit-lark weighs &s;ix or &s;even gros, and its alar extent is only nine inches. The prevailing colour of its upper &s;urface is olive, variegated with black on the fore part, and pure olive behind. Its under &s;urface is yellowi&s;h white, with black longitudinal &s;pots on the brea&s;t and the &s;ides, and the ground colour of the plumage is black. The quills of the wings are almo&s;t black, edged with olive; and tho&s;e of the tail are &s;imilar, ex|cept the outermo&s;t one, which is edged with white, and the one next it, which is tipt with the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>This bird has a &s;ort of white eyelids, which
<PB REF="41">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>THE TIT-LARK.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="29" REF="42">
Linnaeus adopts as its &s;pecific character.&mdash;The male has in general more yellow than the female, on the throat, on the brea&s;t, on the legs, and even on the feet, according to Albin.</P>
<P>The tit-lark is flu&s;hed at the lea&s;t noi&s;e, and &s;hoots with a rapid flight; it perches, though with difficulty, on trees; it con&s;tructs its ne&s;t nearly as the wood-lark, and lays the &s;ame number of eggs, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Briti&s;h Zoology.</NOTE> But, what di&s;tingui&s;hes it, the fir&s;t quill in its wing is equal to the re&s;t, and its &s;ong, though very plea&s;ant, is le&s;s varied. Mr. Pennant compares this to a jeering laugh, and Albin, to the warble of the canary finch; but both complain that it is too &s;hort and broken. However, Belon and Olina agree that this &s;mall bird is e&s;teemed for the &s;weetne&s;s of its &s;ong; and I mu&s;t own, that having occa|&s;ion to hear it I found it really agreeable, though rather plaintive, and &s;imilar to the nightingale's &s;train, yet not &s;o full and connected. It de|&s;erves to be noticed that this one was a female, &s;ince, in di&s;&s;ecting it, I di&s;covered an <HI>ovarium:</HI> it contained three eggs that were larger than the re&s;t, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e a &s;econd hatch. Olina tells us that the tit-lark is rai&s;ed in the &s;ame way as the nightingale, but its delicacy renders the &s;ucce&s;s extremely precarious; and, as it lives only three or four years, we readily
<PB N="30" REF="43">
perceive the rea&s;on why the &s;pecies is unfre|quent, and why the male, when he mounts into the air to de&s;cry his mate, is obliged to &s;weep a much wider circuit than the common lark, or even the wood-lark. Albin indeed pretends that it is long-lived, little &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es, and lays five or &s;ix eggs: but if this were true, the number would be much greater.</P>
<P>According to M. Guys, the tit-lark feeds chiefly upon the worms and in&s;ects for which it &s;earches in new-ploughed lands. Willughby actually found beetles and &s;mall worms in its &s;tomach; and I have my&s;elf &s;een in it portions of in&s;ects and of &s;mall worms, and al&s;o &s;eeds and pebbles. If we believe Albin, it wags its tail from &s;ide to &s;ide while it eats.</P>
<P>The tit-larks breed generally in the mea|dows, and even in low and mar&s;hy grounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Briti&s;h Zoology.</NOTE>. They make their ne&s;t on the &s;urface <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Belon.&mdash;Briti&s;h Zoology.</NOTE>, and conceal it artfully. While the female hatches, the male &s;its on a neighbouring tree, and ri&s;es at times, &s;inging and clapping his wings.</P>
<P>Willughby, who &s;eems to have ob&s;erved this bird with great accuracy, &s;ays properly that its iris is hazel, the tip of its tongue divided into &s;everal filaments, its &s;tomach moderately fle&s;hy, its <HI>c$eca</HI> rather longer than in the &s;ky-lark,
<PB N="31" REF="44">
and that it has a gall-bladder. All this I have verified; and I &s;hall add that there is no craw, and that even the <HI>oe&s;ophagus</HI> has &s;carce any in|flation at its junction with the &s;tomach, and that this &s;tomach or gizzard is large in propor|tion to the body.&mdash;I kept one of the&s;e birds a whole year, and gave it no other food than &s;mall &s;eeds.</P>
<P>The tit-lark inhabits Italy, France, Germany, England, and Sweden. Albin tells us that it ap|pears (in that part of England, no doubt, where he lived) about the beginning of April with the nightingale, and that it departs about the month of September. It &s;ometimes begins its flight before the clo&s;e of Augu&s;t, according to Lottinger <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Lottinger only once &s;aw a tit-lark in Lorraine, in the month of February 1774. But, that &s;ame winter, he &s;aw other birds which do not u&s;ually remain in that pro|vince, &s;uch as green-finches, wagtails, &amp;c. which M. Lot|tinger a&s;cribes properly to the mildne&s;s of that year.</NOTE>, and &s;eems to perform a long jour|ney. If this be admitted, and if we &s;uppo&s;e that it makes occa&s;ional halts in the temperate countries which it traver&s;es, it may be among the number of tho&s;e larks which are &s;een to pa&s;s the i&s;land of Malta in November. In au|tumn, that is, in the time of vintage, it haunts the vicinity of the high-roads. M. Guys re|marks that it is exceedingly fond of the com|pany of its fellows; and if it cannot obtain the
<PB N="32" REF="45">
&s;ociety of the&s;e, it will intermingle with the flocks of finches and linnets which it meets in its pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Comparing what authors have &s;aid of the tit. lark, I perceive differences which di&s;po&s;e one to think that the &s;pecies is much &s;ubject to vary, or that it has been &s;ometimes confounded with its kindred &s;pecies, &s;uch as tho&s;e of the wood-lark and the gra&s;hopper-lark <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;pots on the plumage is nearly the &s;ame in the three &s;pecies, though the colours of the&s;e &s;pots are different in each, and the habits &s;till more different; but le&s;s &s;o, however, than the opinions of authors concerning the properties of the tit-lark. We need only compare Belon, Aldrovandus, Bri&s;&s;on, Olina, Albin, &amp;c. The co|lours by which Bri&s;&s;on characteri&s;es the &s;pecies are not the &s;ame with tho&s;e de&s;cribed by Aldrovandus; who takes no notice of the long hind toe, but &s;peaks of a certain motion of the tail, which the others, except Albin, omit. The latter pretends that the tit-lark is long-lived, and little &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es. Olina and Belon, on the contrary, a&s;&s;ert that it is difficult to be rai&s;ed; Olina po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts that it is &s;hort|lived.

Its &s;ize was the &s;ame with that of the &s;ky-lark, and it had the chief character, which is the long nail projecting from each foot. The plumage of the head and of the upper &s;ide of the body was variegated with che&s;nut, with lighter brown, with whiti&s;h, and with bright rufous.

<P>The cre&s;ted lark is a bird of little timidity, &s;ays Belon, which &s;eems plea&s;ed at the &s;ight of man, and begins to &s;ing when he comes near it. It lives in the meadows and fields, on the &s;ides of ditches and the backs of furrows: it is often &s;een at the margin of water, and on the high-roads, where it picks its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the hor&s;e-dung, e&s;pecially in winter. Fri&s;ch tells us, that it is found al&s;o in the &s;kirts of the woods, perched on a tree; but this &s;eldom occurs, and &s;till more rarely is it di&s;covered in the heart of fore&s;ts. It &s;ometimes re&s;ts on hou&s;e-tops, the walls of abbeys, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This lark, though not &s;o common as the &s;ky|lark, is however &s;pread through the mo&s;t of Europe, if not in the northern parts. It is found in Italy, according to Olina; in France, according to Belon; in Germany, according to Willughby; in Poland, according to Rzacyn&s;ki; and in Scotland, according to Sibbald: but I doubt whether it inhabit Sweden, &s;ince Lin|naeus does not mention it in his <HI>Fauna Succica.</HI></P>
<P>The cre&s;ted lark changes not its abode in winter; but Belon was ha&s;ty in &s;u&s;pecting the

<P><PB N="68" REF="85">
But be&s;ides the excellence of his warble, the male is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;trength of his bill, the bigne&s;s of his head, and by a larger &s;hare of black on his brea&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Olina.</NOTE>. He conducts his amours in the &s;ame way as the &s;ky-lark; only, by rea&s;on of the &s;maller numbers, he is obliged to de&s;cribe a more &s;pacious circle in the air.</P>
<P>The female con&s;tructs her ne&s;t like the com|mon lark, but oftene&s;t near the highways: &s;he lays four or five eggs, and takes little concern in hatching them. It is even &s;aid that a very moderate warmth, aided by the &s;un's rays, is &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As the&s;e ne&s;ts are made on the ground, &s;ome ignorant credulous per&s;on may have &s;een a toad be&s;ide them, or even on the eggs; and hence the fable, that the cre&s;ted and &s;ome other &s;pecies of larks entru&s;ted the toads with the bu&s;ine&s;s of incubation.</NOTE>; but after the young are excluded, they awaken her tenderne&s;s by their repeated cries, and &s;he then provides for them with a maternal affection till they are flown.</P>

have a&s;&s;erted on the authority of Fri&s;ch, to pre|&s;erve them alive in the cage for a whole year. And even when we give them the food that agrees be&s;t with them, which is ants' eggs, ox and &s;heep's hearts minced down, brui&s;ed hemp|&s;eed and millet, we mu&s;t be careful, in intro|ducing the little balls into the throat, not to derange the tongue, which might prove fatal.</P>
<P>Autumn is the proper &s;ea&s;on to lay &s;nares for the&s;e birds; and then great numbers in plump condition are caught on the verge of the fore&s;ts. Fri&s;ch ob&s;erves, that they may be decoyed by the call, which the &s;ky-larks are proof again&s;t. The other differences are the&s;e: The cre&s;ted lark never con&s;orts in flocks; its plumage is le&s;s varied and more white; its bill is longer, and its tail and wings &s;horter; it does not mount &s;o high in the air, is le&s;s able to &s;truggle with the winds, and returns &s;ooner to the ground. In other properties, the two &s;pecies are alike, and even with regard to the period of their lives, when not abridged by the con&s;traints of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it appears that, of all the larks, the cre&s;ted, notwith&s;tanding the attach|ment it is &s;aid to &s;hew to man, has the mo&s;t independent di&s;po&s;ition, and recoils from the dome&s;tic &s;tate.

the &s;ong of the nightingale la&s;ts in its full vigour for fifteen days and nights, without intermi&s;&s;ion, at the time when the trees expand their foliage. But this mu&s;t be re&s;tricted to the wild nightin|gales, and even the&s;e are not always &s;ilent before and after the period a&s;&s;igned; indeed, they &s;ing then with mo&s;t animation and con|&s;tancy. They generally begin in the month of April, and cea&s;e not until June, about the time of the &s;ol&s;tice. Their &s;ilence is greate&s;t when the young are excluded from the eggs, and ab&s;orb their attention in providing food. The tame nightingales &s;ing during &s;ix months, and their warble has not only more extent, but is more perfectly formed: whence Barrington infers, that in this &s;pecies, as well as in many others, the male does not chant with the view of amu&s;ing the female, or of relieving the tedium of incubation; a conclu&s;ion which is entirely ju&s;t and well founded. The female hatches from in&s;tinct; &s;he is prompted by a pa&s;&s;ion &s;tronger than love it&s;elf; and, in that occupation, &s;he mu&s;t feel a plea&s;ure, which, though we cannot conceive it, mu&s;t be exqui&s;ite, and needs no &s;olace. The male is the mo&s;t powerfully &s;timulated to court the joys of love, and warble his amorous tales; and the opening flu&s;h of &s;pring inflames his ardent de&s;ires. When the nightingale is confined, his wants are &s;up|plied and anticipated, and he enjoys the vernal

mildne&s;s through the greater part of the year; every thing concurs to fo&s;ter his pa&s;&s;ion, and the melody of his &s;ong cea&s;es only for a &s;hort interval. Such is al&s;o the ca&s;e with tho&s;e which are caught after they are grown up; within a few hours they often re&s;ume their warble, in all its richne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion; no longer is it limited by the tran&s;ient &s;ea&s;ons. But the love of liberty is not extingui&s;hed in their bo|&s;om: for the fir&s;t week, they can hardly &s;upport their forlorn condition; they mu&s;t be pinioned and fed. However, their pa&s;&s;ion for warbling in the end &s;urmounts every de&s;ponding recol|lection. The &s;ong of other birds, the mu&s;ic of in&s;truments, the accents of a &s;weet and &s;onorous voice, powerfully awaken their languid powers. They are eagerly attracted by &s;weet &s;ounds, and &s;eem particularly fond of <HI>duos;</HI> which &s;hews that they are not in&s;en&s;ible to the effects of har|mony. But they are not &s;ilent auditors; they &s;trike the uni&s;on, and &s;trive to eclip&s;e their rivals. It is &s;aid that a nightingale dropped dead at the feet of a per&s;on who &s;ung; another fretted, &s;well|ed its throat, and murmured di&s;content when|ever a canary, which was be&s;ide it, began to chant, till at la&s;t, by its menaces, it &s;ilenced its competitor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note of M. de Varicourt, Advocate.</HI> M. le Moine, trea|&s;urer of France, at Dijon, who takes plea&s;ure in rai&s;ing nightingales, remarked al&s;o that his pur&s;ued bitterly a tame canary, that was kept in the &s;ame room, when it approached their cage. But this jealou&s;y turns &s;ometimes into emu|lation; for nightingales have been ob&s;erved to &s;ing better than others, merely becau&s;e they heard birds who&s;e &s;trains were inferior to theirs. <HI>Certant inter &s;e, palamque animo&s;a contentic e&s;t: victa morte finit &s;aepe vitam.</HI> Plin. lib. x. 29.

exempt from jealou&s;y. May not this de&s;ire of excelling be the rea&s;on why they choo&s;e advan|tageous &s;ituations, and delight to &s;ing to the returning echo?</P>
<P>The nightingales differ much in the quality of their &s;ong; in &s;ome it is &s;o inferior, that they are reckoned not worth keeping. It is even &s;aid, their warble is not the &s;ame in every country: the bird-fanciers in England prefer the nightingales of Surry to tho&s;e of Middle|&s;ex; as they value mo&s;t the chaffinches from E&s;&s;ex, and the goldfinches from Kent. This diver&s;ity of &s;ong has been properly compared to the different dialects of the &s;ame language. It may ari&s;e from accidental cau&s;es: a nightingale happens to hear the &s;weet mu&s;ic of &s;ome other birds, and, in the glow of emulation, improves his own; he communicates the melody to his young <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny relates, that the parent is careful in in&s;tructing his young. Lib. x. 29. &amp; lib. iv. 9.</NOTE>; and thus it is tran&s;mitted, with va|rious alterations, through the &s;ucceeding races.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="102">
After the month of June, the nightingale's warble is gone; a raucous croaking remains, and the &s;weet Philomela is no longer recognized. No wonder that, in ancient Italy, it then received another name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, <HI>Hi&s;t. Anim.</HI> lib. ix. 49.</NOTE>. In regard to &s;ong, it is quite a different bird, and even the colours of its plumage are &s;omewhat altered.</P>
<P>In the nightingales, as in other &s;pecies, there are females which enjoy &s;ome prerogatives of the male, and particularly participate of his &s;ong. I &s;aw a female of that &s;ort which was tame; her warble re&s;embled that of the male, yet neither &s;o full nor &s;o varied: &s;he retained it until &s;pring, when, re&s;uming the character of the &s;ex, &s;he exchanged it for the occupation of building her ne&s;t and laying her eggs, though &s;he had no mate. It would &s;eem that in warm coun|tries, as in Greece, &s;uch females are pretty common, both in this &s;pecies, and many others at lea&s;t this is implied in a pa&s;&s;age of Ari&s;totle <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Some males &s;ing like their females, as appears in the genus of the nightingales; but the female gives over &s;ong when &s;he hatches." <HI>Hi&s;t.

<P>A mu&s;ician, &s;ays Fri&s;ch, ought to &s;tudy the &s;ong of the nightingale, and write it. This is what the je&s;uit Kircher formerly attempted, and which has been lately tried by Barrington.
<PB N="85" REF="103">
Yet the latter owns that he could not &s;ucceed; for though the notes were played by an excel|lent performer on the flute, they bore no re&s;em|blance to the nightingale's warble. Mr. Bar|rington &s;u&s;pects the difficulty to ari&s;e from the impo&s;&s;ibility of marking the mu&s;ical intervals. Their mea&s;ures are &s;o varied, their tran&s;itions &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly blended, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their tones &s;o wild and irregular as to &s;oar beyond every con&s;traint of method: but &s;till more dif|ficult it would be, to imitate with a dead in&s;tru|ment the expre&s;&s;ion of the nightingale, his tender &s;ighs, and his melting accents. The animated organ of voice can alone a&s;pire to the mu&s;ic of nature; and the rare accompli&s;hment of a &s;oft, clear, flexible, &s;onorous tone, of a delicate and di&s;cerning ear, and of an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, will &s;ometimes &s;ucceed. I knew two per&s;ons, who, though they had not noted a &s;ingle bar, imitated the whole extent of the nightingale's warble, and &s;o accurately as to deceive the hearer: they were two men, who rather whi&s;tled than &s;ung: the one whi&s;tled &s;o &s;oftly, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible to perceive the motion of his lips; the other blew with more force, and his attitude was &s;omewhat con&s;trained, though his imitation was &s;till perfect. A few years ago, there was a man at London who attracted the nightingales with his &s;ong; in&s;omuch that they alighted on
<PB N="86" REF="104">
him, and allowed them&s;elves to be caught by the hand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Annual Regi&s;ter,</HI> for 1764. <HI>Aldrovandus,</HI> p. 783.

<P>But though few can imitate the nightingale, every per&s;on is eager to enjoy its &s;ong. It is a dome&s;tic of a capricious humour, which neither cheerfulne&s;s nor affection can direct. It mu&s;t be treated with tenderne&s;s, and &s;upplied abun|dantly with the food it likes: the walls &s;hould be painted with verdure, and &s;haded and enrich|ed with foliage; mo&s;s &s;hould be &s;trewed beneath its feet; it mu&s;t be guarded again&s;t cold, and from trouble&s;ome vi&s;its <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is even recommended to clean it &s;eldom when it &s;ings.</NOTE>; and every illu&s;ion mu&s;t be employed to di&s;pel the gloom of captivity.

They may be in&s;tructed even to &s;ing by turns with a chorus, and repeat their couplet at the proper time. They may be al&s;o taught to &s;peak any language. The &s;ons of the empe|ror Claudius had &s;ome nightingales that &s;poke Greek and Latin <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pliny, lib. x. 42.</NOTE>. But what Pliny &s;ubjoins is more marvellous; that the&s;e birds prepared every day new expre&s;&s;ions, and even of con&s;i|derable length, with which they entertained their ma&s;ters <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e young princes were Dru&s;us and Britannicus.</NOTE>. The arts of flattery might work upon the under&s;tandings of young princes; but a philo&s;opher like Pliny ought not to have credited &s;uch a &s;tory, nor have publi&s;hed it under the &s;anction of his name. Several authors accordingly, re&s;ting on the authority of the Roman naturali&s;t, have amplified the marvellous tale. Ge&s;ner, among others, quotes a letter from a per&s;on of credit (as we &s;hall find), who mentions two nightingales belonging to an inn|keeper at Rati&s;bon which pa&s;&s;ed the night di&s;|cour&s;ing
<PB N="88" REF="106">
in German on the political intere&s;ts of Europe; on the events already happened, and on tho&s;e which might be expected, and which actually took place. It is true that the author of the letter endeavours to render the &s;tory more probable, by telling us that the birds only repeated what they heard of &s;ome officers, or deputies from the Diet, who frequented the tavern; but &s;till the whole is &s;o ab&s;urd as to merit no &s;erious refutation.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that the old pri&s;oners had two &s;ea&s;ons for &s;inging; the months of May and December. But here art interferes, and again diverts the cour&s;e of nature. The chamber is darkened, and the birds are &s;ilent. If the light be re&s;tored by degrees, it will produce the effect of &s;pring, and the nightingales will re&s;ume their warble. If we have a &s;ufficient number of old &s;ingers, we may, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive manoeuvres, and by ha&s;tening or retarding the time of moulting, be entertained with continual melody. Some of the young birds which are rai&s;ed, &s;ing dur|ing the night; but mo&s;t of them begin to chant at eight or nine of the morning, in the winter &s;ol&s;tice, and gradually earlier as the days lengthen.</P>
<P>One would hardly believe that a &s;ong &s;o varied as that of the nightingale is confined within the narrow limits of a &s;ingle octave; yet this is a&s;certained by an ob&s;erver of infor|mation

<P>Though &s;low in acquiring it, the nightingale is &s;u&s;ceptible of an un&s;haken attachment. It di&s;tingui&s;hes the &s;tep of its ma&s;ter, and wel|comes his approach with the mu&s;ic of joy; and even in the moulting &s;ea&s;on, it idly &s;trains its enfeebled organs to expre&s;s the warmth of its heart.

In eighteen or twenty days the young begin to bur&s;t their &s;hells, and the number of the cock birds is generally double that of the hens.

The hen di&s;gorges the food for the young, as in the canaries; and the cock a&s;&s;i&s;ts.

Nightingales that are kept in the cage com|monly bathe after &s;inging. Hebert remarks, that this is the fir&s;t thing they do in the even|ing, when the candles are lighted.

<P>The&s;e birds have a &s;ort of vibrating motion, and by turns rai&s;e and depre&s;s their body.

<P>Nightingales hide them&s;elves in the thick|e&s;t bu&s;hes: they live upon aquatic and other in&s;ects, &s;mall worms, the eggs, or rather nymphs, of ants; they al&s;o eat figs, ber|ries, &amp;c. But as it would be difficult always to provide &s;uch food, &s;everal kinds of pa&s;te have been contrived, which agree very well with them. I &s;hall, in the notes, give the receipt of a bird-fancier of my acquaintance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M.

<P>It has been found, that heating medicines and perfumes incited the nightingales to warble; that flour mites and dung maggots were the mo&s;t proper to give when they were too fat, and figs when too lean; and that &s;piders &s;erved them as a purge. It has been recommended to make them take this purge once a year; a dozen &s;piders is the proper do&s;e. They &s;hould al&s;o have nothing that is &s;alt.</P>
<P>When they &s;wallow any indige&s;tible &s;ub|&s;tance, they regorge it in little pellets like the birds of prey; and indeed, though they are &s;mall, they merit that appellation.

If they be let loo&s;e in a place where there are other birds in cages, they fly directly towards the&s;e; and this is one method among many others of catching them.

<P>The&s;e birds are delicious food when fat, and in this re&s;pect they rival the ortolans. In Ga&s;|cony, they are fatted for the table. This re|minds us of the whim of the Emperor He|liogabalus, who ate the tongues of nightin|gales, of peacocks, &amp;c. and the famous di&s;h of the comedian Ae&s;op, which con&s;i&s;ted of an hundred birds, all noted for their &s;ong or their prattle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pliny, lib. x. 51.

<P>As it is a matter of &s;ome con&s;equence not to lo&s;e time in breeding females, many marks have been given to di&s;tingui&s;h the cocks.

Others add, that the male has two or three quills

in each wing who&s;e outer &s;urface is black, and their legs, if viewed in a &s;ide light, appear reddi&s;h, while tho&s;e of the female look whiti&s;h: however, the hen has the &s;ame motion of the tail; and, when cheerful, &s;he does not walk, but hops like the cock. To the&s;e we may join the more deci&s;ive differences of internal &s;tructure. The males which I di&s;&s;ected in the &s;pring had two very large te&s;ticles of an egg &s;hape; the large&s;t of the two (for they were not equal) was three lines and a half in length, and two in breadth: the <HI>ovaria</HI> of the females which I ob&s;erved at the &s;ame time contained eggs of different &s;izes, from a quarter of a line to one line in diameter.</P>
<P>The plumage of this bird is much inferior to its warble. All the upper &s;ide of the body is brown, more or le&s;s ru&s;ty; the throat, brea&s;t and belly are of a white gray; the fore part of the neck, of a deeper gray; the inferior coverts of the tail and wings, ru&s;ty white and of a ferrugi|nous ca&s;t in the males; the quills of the wings, of a browni&s;h gray verging on rufous, and the tail of a brown tinged more with rufous: the bill is brown, and al&s;o the feet, but with a &s;hade of fle&s;h colour: the ground colour of the feathers is deep cinereous.</P>

<P>IN the dreary &s;ea&s;on of winter, nature &s;inks into inactivity and torpor. The in&s;ects no more appear; the reptiles cea&s;e to crawl; the vegetables are &s;tripped of their verdure, and arre&s;ted in their growth; the inhabitants of the air have peri&s;hed, or retired to happier climes; tho&s;e of the waters are confined to their icy pri&s;ons, and mo&s;t of the land animals have repaired to their caves and &s;ubterraneous man|&s;ions; the whole is a boundle&s;s picture of de&s;o|lation, and languor, and death. The vernal appearance of the feathered vi&s;iters of the grove proclaims the return of animation and of joy. Nature awakens from her lethargy, and re&s;umes her enlivening powers. The trees &s;pread their leafy &s;hade; the vegetable tribes glow with their riche&s;t tints; the &s;cene &s;miles around, it

warbles on every &s;pray, and a genial flu&s;h heightens the whole.</P>
<P>Of the joyous gue&s;ts of the woods, the fau|vettes are the mo&s;t numerous and the mo&s;t charming: lively and volatile, each motion is expre&s;&s;ive, each accent is cheerful, and each ge&s;ture di&s;plays the tenderne&s;s of love. The&s;e pretty warblers arrive when the trees put forth their leaves, and begin to expand their blo&s;&s;oms; they di&s;per&s;e through the whole extent of our plains: &s;ome inhabit our gardens, others pre|fer the clumps and avenues; &s;ome conceal them|&s;elves among the reeds, and many retire to the heart of large woods. Thus the fauvettes are di&s;per&s;ed through every &s;pot, and their &s;prightly movements, and their cheerful airs, enchant each &s;cene <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In &s;ummer, a per&s;on cannot walk into any &s;hady &s;pot be&s;ide brooks, but he will hear the fauvettes warbling even at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a league: this bird is known therefore in all countries." <HI>Belou.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every grace and elegance, beauty alone was wanted to perfection. But nature has here checked her profu&s;ion, and withheld decoration. Their plumage is dull and ob&s;cure, except in two or three &s;pecies, which are &s;lightly &s;potted: all the re&s;t are &s;tained with dark &s;hades of whiti&s;h, gray, and ru&s;ty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;pecies, which is the pettychaps,
<PB N="112" REF="131">
is of the &s;ize of the nightingale. The robe of the nightingale is brown rufous, that of the pettychaps is brown-gray: it is al&s;o lightly tinged with ru&s;ty gray, on the fringe of the coverts of the wings, and along the webs of the &s;mall quills: the large quills are of a blacki&s;h cinereous; and &s;o are al&s;o the quills of the tail, of which the two outermo&s;t are white on their exterior &s;ide, and at the tips on both &s;ides: over the eye there extends, from the bill, a white line like an eyebrow; and under the eye, and a little behind, there is a blacki&s;h &s;pot; and this &s;pot borders with the white on the throat, which has a ru&s;ty ca&s;t on the &s;ides, of a deeper colour under the belly.</P>
<P>This is the large&s;t of all the fauvettes, except the Alpine warbler, of which we &s;hall treat in the &s;equel. Its total length is &s;ix inches; its alar extent, eight inches ten lines; its bill, from the tip to the angles, eight lines and a half; its tail, two inches &s;ix lines; its foot, ten lines.</P>
<P>It lives with other &s;maller &s;pecies in gar|dens, in thickets, and in fields of pea&s;e and beans: they all &s;it on the &s;takes which prop the&s;e; and there they frolic, build their ne&s;t, and continually go out and in, till harve&s;t, which precedes their departure, forces them from this a&s;ylum, or rather this abode of love.</P>
<P>It is amu&s;ing to &s;ee them play together, grow angry, and cha&s;e each other: their attacks are
<PB N="113" REF="132">
gentle, and their quarrels commonly end in &s;ongs. The pettychaps was regarded as the emblem of volatile amours, as the turtle was the image of ardent and &s;teady love; yet the petty|chaps, though lively and joyous, maintains a faithful and &s;trong attachment, while the turtle, all &s;ad and plaintive, infringes &s;hamefully on the connubial rights. The male of the petty|chaps lavi&s;hes a thou&s;and little offices on his mate during incubation; he &s;hares with her the &s;olicitude for their tender young, and does not abandon her after the education of their family: his attachment outlives the appetite of fruition.</P>
<P>The ne&s;t is compo&s;ed of dry herbs and &s;talks of hemp, and lined with a little hair. It con|tains commonly five eggs, which the mother de&s;erts if they are touched: this approach of an enemy &s;he regards as a bad omen for the ex|pected family. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to deceive her with the eggs of other birds. "I have often &s;et &s;trange eggs under &s;everal &s;mall birds," &s;ays Vi&s;count Querho&euml;nt; "tho&s;e of the titmice un|der wrens, tho&s;e of the linnet under the red-brea&s;t: but I could never make the fauvettes hatch them; they always broke them; and, when I &s;ub&s;tituted other young ones, they &s;oon killed them." From what wonderful in&s;tinct, if we believe the bulk of bird-catchers, and even of ob&s;ervers, do the pettychaps hatch the egg which the cuckoo drops into their ne&s;t after
<PB N="114" REF="133">
de&s;troying their own; and how can they fo&s;te the little ugly u&s;urper as their own progeny However, it is the babbling fauvette or warble to which this tru&s;t is the oftene&s;t committed and perhaps that &s;pecies has different in&s;tincts&mdash;The pettychaps is of a timid character; flies from birds as &s;mall as it&s;elf, and with bet|ter rea&s;on it makes a rapid retreat from th$ &s;hrike, its formidable enemy: but the danger is forgotten the moment it is pa&s;t, and the little warbler again re&s;umes its cheerfulne&s;s, and fri&s;ks, and &s;ings. It is heard in the thicke boughs, where it is generally concealed; a times it pops out to the edge of a bu&s;h, but hides it&s;elf again in an in&s;tant, particularly i$ the heat of the day. In the morning it gather the dew; and, after the fall of a &s;ummer's &s;howe$ it trips among the wet leaves, and bru&s;hes off the drops.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t all the fauvettes retire at the &s;ame time, in the middle of autumn, and &s;carcel$ any remain in October. Their departure pre+cedes the cold weather, which de&s;troys the in+&s;ects, and bla&s;ts the &s;mall fruits, on which the &s;ub&s;i&s;t; for they not only catch flies, and gnat$ and &s;earch for worms, but they eat the berries $ ivy, mezereon, and brambles: they grow f$ during the maturity of the elders, dwarf elde$ and privets.</P>
<P>The bill is &s;lightly &s;calloped near the poin$
<PB N="115" REF="134">
the tongue is fringed at the tip, and appears forked: the in&s;ide of the bill is yellow at the bottom, and black towards the extremity: the gizzard is mu&s;cular, and preceded by a dilatation of the <HI>oesophagus:</HI> the inte&s;tines are &s;even inches and a half long: there is generally no gall blad|der, but two &s;mall <HI>coeca:</HI> the outer toe is con|nected to the middle one by the fir&s;t <HI>phalanx,</HI> and the outer nail is the &s;tronge&s;t of all. The te&s;ticles in a male caught the 18th of June were five inches lengthwi&s;e, and the &s;maller diameter four inches. A female was di&s;&s;ected on the fourth of the &s;ame month, and the oviduct was much dilated, and contained an egg, and the <HI>ovarium</HI> pre&s;ented a clu&s;ter of unequal &s;izes.</P>
<P>In the &s;outhern provinces of France, and in Italy, mo&s;t of the fauvettes are called epicurean warblers <HI>(bec-figues);</HI> an error to which the nomenclators with their generic term <HI>ficedula</HI> have not a little contributed. Aldrovandus gives a confu&s;ed and incomplete account of the &s;pecies comprehended; and he &s;eems not &s;ufficiently acquainted with them. Fri&s;ch remarks, that the genus of the fauvettes is the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and indetermined in the whole of ornithology. We have endeavoured to throw on it &s;ome light, by following the order of nature. All our de&s;criptions, except that of a &s;ingle &s;pecies, have been drawn from life; and it is from our own ob&s;ervations, and from the facts communi|cated
<PB N="116" REF="135">
by intelligent ob&s;ervers, that we have de|lineated the di&s;tinctions and the &s;imilitudes and the habits which obtain among the&s;e little birds. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Nothing can exceed the confu&s;ion which nomencla|tors have introduced into the article of the pettychaps, or fauvette. Gmelin and Latham have transferred the Greek name, <HI>hippolais,</HI> which Linnaeus had injudiciou&s;ly applied to that bird, and have be&s;towed it on another bird about one third of the &s;ize; and at the &s;ame time they have given the pettychaps, or fauvette, the epithet <HI>horten&s;is.</HI> Yet while the&s;e two authors agree in the application of the terms, the one a&s;&s;erts that the <HI>motacilla horten&s;is</HI> is larger than the redpole or black-cap, but the other repre&s;ents it as &s;maller than even the linnet.

A very delicate white gray covers all the fore and under part of the body, receiving a very light brown ca&s;t on the &s;ides: an uniform a&s;h gray is &s;pread over the whole of the upper part, and &s;tained &s;omewhat with blacki&s;h on the great quills of the wings and of the tail: there is a &s;mall whiti&s;h &s;treak which pa&s;&s;es over the eye.

<PB N="120" REF="140">
the one nor the other; and the explication is very ea&s;y. In fact, the young black-caps have, through the whole &s;ummer, the plumage of the epicurean warblers, and only a&s;&s;ume their pro|per garb after the fir&s;t moulting: and this is the interpretation which Pliny gives <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;t.

In the male, a black cap covers the back of the head and the crown, as far as the eyes; below and round the neck the plumage is of a &s;late gray, lighter on the throat, attenuated into white on the brea&s;t, and &s;haded with blacki&s;h on the &s;ides: the back is of a brown gray, lighter on the ex|terior &s;urface of the quills, deeper on the lower ones, and &s;tained with an olive tint. The bird is five inches five lines in length; the alar extent eight inches and a half.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="141">
The black-cap has the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and the fulle&s;t warble of all the fauvettes. It is &s;ome|what like the nightingale's &s;ong, and we enjoy it much longer; for &s;everal months after the groves no more echo Philomel's notes, the mu&s;ic of the black-cap is heard. Its airs are ea&s;y and light, and con&s;i&s;t of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of modu|lations of &s;mall compa&s;s, but &s;weet, flexible, and blended: they expre&s;s the happine&s;s and tran|quillity that dwell in their haunts. The &s;en&s;ible heart warms with delicious emotions at accents in&s;pired by nature, and flowing from that feli|city which &s;he has be&s;towed.</P>
<P>The male &s;hews a tender concern for his fe|male: not only does he carry flies, worms, and ants to her; but he relieves the languor of in|cubation, and &s;its by turns. The ne&s;t is placed near the ground, and carefully concealed in a coppice: it contains four or five eggs, of a green|i&s;h hue, with &s;pots of light brown. The young ones grow in a few days; and though but &s;lightly fledged, they will leap out of the ne&s;t when a per&s;on comes near it, and never will return. The black-cap has generally only one annual hatch in France.

<P>The mother was caught with her young: the iris was of a che&s;nut colour; the edges of the upper mandible lightly &s;calloped at the point; the two eyelids furni&s;hed with white la&s;hes: the tongue was frittered at the end; the inte&s;tinal tube from the gizzard to the <HI>anus</HI> was &s;ix inches long: there were two <HI>caeca</HI> two lines in length, their di&s;tance two inches, and the fir&s;t before its in&s;ertion made a dilatation: the <HI>ova|rium</HI> contained different &s;ized eggs.</P>

Aldrovandus remarks, that the eye of the pa&s;&s;erine is &s;mall, but bri&s;k and lively. The back and crown of the head are a&s;h gray: the tem|ples, the plumage above and behind the eye, are marked with a more blacki&s;h &s;pot: the throat is white as far as the eye: the brea&s;t and &s;tomach are whiti&s;h, and &s;haded with a light ru&s;ty or vinous tint. The bird is larger than the epicurean warbler: its total length is five inches &s;even lines; its alar extent eight inches. In Provence it enjoys another climate, and its habits are rather different.

<P>Like the re&s;t of the fauvettes, this bird is perpetually joyous, lively, and active, and often utters a feeble cry: it has al&s;o a &s;ong, which though monotonous is not di&s;agreeable; and it improves the notes when it has opportunities of hearing more varied and more brilliant modu|lations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Tho&s;e which I rai&s;ed &s;eemed to have a more melo|dious &s;ong than the wild ones, becau&s;e they pretty often heard a &s;iddle.

eight inches eight lines: its bill is &s;even inches and a half long; its feet, nine lines; its tail, two inches: the wings, when clo&s;ed, reach beyond the middle of the tail: all the upper part of its body is of a light ru&s;ty gray, and in|clining &s;omewhat to olive near the rump: the feathers of the wings are browner than tho&s;e of the tail: the inferior coverts of the wings are of a light yellow; the throat and all the fore part of the body yellowi&s;h on a whiti&s;h ground, and &s;tained on the &s;ides and near the tail with brown &s;hades.</P>
<P>It is not in the lea&s;t degree probable that the <HI>petronella</HI> of Schwenckfeld, "a bird which ne&s;tles under rocks and on the bare ground, which is &s;een only in the craggy parts of the mountains, and which continually jerks its tail like the wag|tail," is the &s;ame with our reed fauvette.

<P>If the <HI>&s;edge bird</HI> of Albin is al&s;o the &s;ame, his figure mu&s;t be a very bad one, and all its colours fal&s;e: it is not painting but ma&s;king nature.

<P>The rufous warbler has commonly five young; but they often become the prey of the rapacious birds, particularly the &s;hrikes.

The in&s;ide is lined with hor&s;e-hair; but the ne&s;t ob&s;erved by Belon had

a hole in the bottom, which he a&s;cribes to de|&s;ign, though it was probably accidental <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is lined on the in&s;ide with hor&s;e-hair, and &s;o nicely that it is per&s;orated like a noo&s;e; &s;o that the excrements of the young e&s;cape, and they are always pre&s;erved clean." <HI>Nat. des Oi&s;.</HI> p. 341.</NOTE>; for this is contrary to the general con&s;truction, which is calculated to collect and concentrate the heat.</P>

<P>Nature, who paints mo&s;t of the birds in the New World with the riche&s;t colours, denies them the charms of &s;ong, and, in the de&s;ert tracts, &s;he be&s;tows only &s;ome &s;avage cries. They yellow-neck is one of the &s;mall number who&s;e warble is lively and cheerful, and who&s;e plumage is at the &s;ame time di&s;tingui&s;hed for beauty: the tints are well blended, and are heightended by the fine yellow which &s;preads over the throat, the neck, and the brea&s;t: black gray predominates on the head, and, growing more dilute as it de&s;cends to the neck, it changes into a deep gray on the back: there is a white line which crowns the eye, and joins to a &s;mall yellow &s;treak lying between the eye and the bill: the belly is white, and the &s;ides are &s;peckled with white and black gray: the coverts of the wings are &s;potted with black and white, di&s;po&s;ed in hori|zontal &s;tripes; there are al&s;o large white &s;pots on the quills, of which there are &s;ixteen in each wing, and with a &s;mall white gray border at

the end of the great webs: the tail con&s;i&s;ts of twelve quills, of which the four outer ones are marked with large white &s;pots: a &s;caly fine &s;kin, of a greeni&s;h gray, covers the legs: the bird is four inches and nine lines in length; its alar extent eight inches, and it weighs one gros and a half.</P>
<P>Under this rich clothing, the pen&s;ile warbler has the figure and proportions of the fauvettes; and its habits are al&s;o the &s;ame. It prefers for its haunts the &s;ides of rivulets, and the cool refre&s;hing &s;pots near &s;prings, and wet gullies; whether becau&s;e a mild temperature is mo&s;t congenial to its nature, or that it &s;eeks retire|ment where nothing may di&s;turb its mu&s;ic.

It preys on flies, caterpillars, and butter|flies; and yet, in the &s;ea&s;on, it cracks the &s;eeds of the guava and water melon, &amp;c. probably to find the maggots which are bred in the&s;e at a certain &s;tate of maturity.

Bri&s;&s;on calls the <HI>cinereous red&s;tart,</HI> and which Willughby and Ray de&s;cribe from Aldrovan|dus. Fri&s;ch mentions another variety of the hen red&s;tart, in which the brea&s;t is marked with rufous &s;pots; and this variety con&s;titutes Klein's &s;econd &s;pecies. The gray red&s;tart of Edwards <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Motacilla Gibraltarien&s;is, <HI>Gmel.</HI></NOTE>, &s;ent from Gibraltar to Cate&s;by, and which Bri&s;|&s;on makes his &s;econd &s;pecies, is probably only a variety of climate. It is of the &s;ame &s;ize with the common red&s;tart; the greate&s;t difference is, that there are no rufous tints on its brea&s;t, and that the outer edges of the middle quills of its wing are white.</P>
<P>Another variety nearly the &s;ame is the bird &s;ent to us by M. D'Orcy, in which the black co|lour of the throat &s;preads over the brea&s;t and &s;ides; whereas in the common red&s;tart the&s;e parts are rufous. We do not know whence M.

<P>There is be&s;ides in America a &s;pecies of red|&s;tart de&s;cribed by Cate&s;by, which we &s;hall leave undecided, and not ranged expre&s;sly with that of Europe; not &s;o much becau&s;e of the differ|ence of characters, as of the wide &s;eparation be|tween

the continents. In fact, Cate&s;by a&s;cribes to the Virginian red&s;tart the &s;ame habits which we &s;urvey in our own. It lives in the clo&s;e&s;t woods; it is &s;een only in &s;ummer: its head, neck, back and wings are black, except a &s;mall &s;pot of vivid rufous on its wing; the rufous colour of the brea&s;t is divided into two by the continuation of the gray of the &s;tomach; the point of its tail is black. Are the&s;e differences &s;pecific, and more marked than what might be expected from the influence of another hemi|&s;phere?</P>

<PB N="172" REF="195">
a rutilous plumage, but the red&s;tart or red-brea&s;t. It will be more difficult to a&s;certain the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <HI>rubicilla.</HI> The&s;e names have been applied by all the nomenclators to the bulfinch: their opinion was noticed, but not di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, at that article; and we &s;hall now re&s;ume the &s;ub|ject, and &s;tate the rea&s;ons which di&s;po&s;e us to make a very different conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle enumerates at this place the &s;mall birds, with a &s;lender bill, which live chiefly on vegetables; &s;uch are, &s;ays he, the <HI>cygalis,</HI> the <HI>beccafico</HI> (or epicurean warbler), the <HI>melancory|phus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know that Belon and many naturali&s;ts after him, have referred al&s;o to the bul&s;inch the name of <HI>melancory|phus;</HI> but I am convinced that this application is erroneous.

It will not touch in&s;ects in the &s;ea&s;on when mo&s;t others feed upon them; and
<PB N="173" REF="196">
it &s;eems to differ as much from the vermivorous birds by its in&s;tincts as by the &s;hape of its bill: and it is not likely that Ari&s;totle would over|look this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>To what other bird, then, can we a&s;cribe the&s;e properties? I perceive none but the <HI>red|tail,</HI> which inhabits the woods with the red-brea&s;t, and al&s;o feeds on in&s;ects during the whole &s;ummer, and departs at the &s;ame time in winter. Wotton conceived that the pyrrhulas was a kind of red-tail <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Apud Ge&s;nerum,</HI> p. 701.</NOTE>, and John&s;ton makes the &s;ame remark <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pyrrhulas, <HI>John&s;t.</HI></NOTE>; but the former was mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing this bird to be the red&s;tart, &s;ince Ari&s;totle nicely di&s;tingui&s;hes them.</P>
<P>The red-tail is actually very different from the red&s;tart, and Ari&s;totle and Ge&s;ner did well to &s;eparate them. It is larger than the red&s;tart: it never vi&s;its our dwellings, nor ne&s;tles in the walls; but lives in the woods and bu&s;hes like the fauvettes and beccafigos: its tail is of a light vivid fire colour; the re&s;t of the plumage con&s;i&s;ts of gray, e&s;pecially on all the upper &s;urface, and deeper and fringed with ru&s;ty on the quills of the wings, and with white gray, mixed confu&s;edly with ru&s;ty, on all the fore part of the body: the rump is rufous, and &s;o is the tail. Some have a fine black collar, and
<PB N="174" REF="197">
the colours over the whole of their plumage more lively and varied. Bri&s;&s;on has formed the&s;e into a &s;econd &s;pecies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phoenicurus Torquatus.</NOTE>; but we conceive that they are only the males, and &s;ome very ex|perienced bird-fanciers have confirmed our opinion. Bri&s;&s;on &s;ays, that the collared red-tail is <HI>found in Germany,</HI> as if it were peculiar to that country: but wherever the gray red-tails occur, the collared red-tails are equally frequent. Be&s;ides, he is mi&s;taken in his reference; for the figure in Fri&s;ch, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the red-tail, is only the female of the blue-throated warbler.</P>
<P>We regard the collared red-tail, therefore, as the male, and the gray red-tail as the female: in both, the tail is equally red; but, be&s;ides the collar, the male has a deeper plumage, being a brown gray on the back, and gray &s;potted with brown on the brea&s;t and &s;ides.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds prefer the hilly countries, and &s;carcely appear in the low grounds, except in their autumnal pa&s;&s;age <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"I have &s;een in Brie, in autumn, a bird which like|wi&s;e had a very rufous tail, but different from the red|&s;tart: I thought it was the &s;ame with the <HI>collier</HI> of Nantua in its fir&s;t year.

<P>It is in Provence where they are properly named fig-peckers, for they are con&s;tantly &s;een on the fig-trees pecking the ripe&s;t fruit.

<P>This delicious bird has long been famous: Apicius mentions it more than once, with the little thru&s;h, as both equally exqui&s;ite. Eu&s;ta|thius and Athenaeus &s;peak of the fowling for epicurean warblers <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Ge&s;ner.</NOTE>, and He&s;ychius pre&s;erves the name of a net with which they were caught in Greece. Nothing indeed is more delicate or juicy than the meat of the&s;e birds at the proper &s;ea&s;on; it is a pellet of light, &s;avoury, melting fat, of ea&s;y dige&s;tion; it is the extract of all the juices of the excellent fruits on which they feed.</P>
<P>We are acquainted with only one &s;pecies, though the name has been be&s;towed on &s;everal <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus gives (t. ii. p. 759) two figures of the fig-pecker, of which the &s;econd, according to him&s;elf, exhi|bits only a variety of the fir&s;t, perhaps even accidental, and which, he &s;ays, may be called <HI>the variegated fig-pecker, black and white being mixed through its whole plumage, as the figure &s;hews:</HI> but this figure &s;hews only in that the white on the wing is a little broader, and there is &s;ome white on the fore &s;ide of the neck and on the brea&s;t; which con&s;titutes only an individual variety.</NOTE>. If indeed we call every bird <HI>fig-pecker</HI> which pecks
<PB N="183" REF="206">
the figs in that &s;ea&s;on, the fauvettes and all the birds with &s;lender bills, and even &s;ome with thick bills, would be entitled to that appellation. Hence the Italian proverb, <HI>Nel' me&s;e d' Ago&s;to ogni uccello e beccafico</HI> (In the month of Augu&s;t every bird is a fig-pecker). But this vulgar &s;aying, which very well expre&s;&s;es the delicacy of flavour that the figs give to the little birds which feed on them, would be a very vague and improper foundation for arrangement; and were it adopt|ed, it would introduce the greate&s;t confu&s;ion. Yet &s;ome naturali&s;ts have fallen into this error. <HI>The hemp fig-pecker</HI> of Olina <HI>(beccafico canapino)</HI> is only the babbling warbler. The great war|bler, or the pettychaps, is according to Ray, called <HI>beccafigo</HI> in Italy. Belon applies the &s;ame name to the rufous warbler; and we have ju&s;t &s;een that he is &s;till more mi&s;taken in &s;up|po&s;ing that term belonged al&s;o to the <HI>bulfinch,</HI> to which he is, by con&s;equence, led to a&s;&s;ign the ancient appellations of the fig-pecker <HI>&s;ycalis</HI> and <HI>ficedula.</HI> In Provence, &s;everal different birds are confounded under the name of fig-pecker.

<P>THIS little bird pa&s;&s;es the whole &s;ummer in our woods, and vi&s;its our habitations only at its departure in autumn, and its arrival in &s;pring: but this la&s;t appearance is tran&s;ient; it ha&s;tens to the fore&s;ts to enjoy, under the new|&s;pread foliage, its &s;olitude and its love. Its ne&s;t is placed near the ground, on the roots of young trees, or on herbs that are able to &s;up|port it; it is con&s;tructed with mo&s;s, intermixed with hair and oak leaves, and lined with feathers. Often after this is built, &s;ays Willugh|by, the bird &s;trews it with leaves, pre&s;erving only a narrow winding entrance under the
<PB N="186" REF="210">
heap, and even &s;huts the mouth of it with a leaf when &s;he goes abroad. The ne&s;t generally con|tains between five and &s;even eggs, of a brown co|lour. During the whole time of incubation, the cock makes the woods re&s;ound with his light, ten|der &s;ong: it is a &s;weet, delicate warble, enlivened with &s;ome brilliant modulations, and broken by graceful melting accents, which &s;eem to be the expre&s;&s;ions of amorous de&s;ire. The &s;oft &s;o|ciety of the female fills up his wi&s;hes, and makes him unea&s;y at the intru&s;ion of other company. He keenly cha&s;es all the birds of his own &s;pecies, and drives them from his little &s;ettlement; and never did the &s;ame bu&s;h lodge two pairs of red|brea&s;ts, as faithful as they are amorous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unum arbu&s;tum non alit duos erithacos.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The red-brea&s;t prefers thick &s;hade and water|ed &s;pots; it feeds in the &s;pring on worms and in&s;ects, which it hunts &s;kilfully and nimbly. It flutters like a butterfly about a leaf where it &s;ees a fly; and on the ground it advances by &s;mall &s;prings, and darts on its prey, clapping its wings. In autumn, it al&s;o eats bramble-berries; and, on its departure, it feeds on the grapes of the vineyards, and on the &s;orbs in the woods; which is the rea&s;on that it is apt to be caught in the gins &s;et for the thru&s;hes, and which are baited with the&s;e &s;mall wild fruits. It re&s;orts often to the &s;prings, to bathe or drink,
<PB N="187" REF="211">
but mo&s;t frequently in the autumn; for it is fat|ter at that &s;ea&s;on than at any other, and needs more to be cooled.</P>
<P>No bird is earlier awake than the red-brea&s;t; it begins the mu&s;ic of the woods, welcomes the dawn of day. It al&s;o protracts its warble to the late&s;t hour, and is &s;een fluttering about in the evening. It is often caught in gins after there is &s;carce light &s;ufficient for taking it up. It has little &s;hyne&s;s; and its volatility, its re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, or its curio&s;ity, hurry it into every &s;ort of &s;nare <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of all birds that live in the &s;tate of liberty, the red|brea&s;t is perhaps the lea&s;t &s;hy: they often approach &s;o near, that a per&s;on might think that he could catch them with the hand; but the bird keeps con&s;tantly retiring as he advances. It &s;eems fond too of accompanying travellers through the fore&s;ts, and it is often ob&s;erved to precede or follow them a pretty long time. <HI>Note communicated by the Sieur Trecourt.</HI></NOTE>. It is always the fir&s;t bird that is caught by the decoy; even the voice of the fowlers, and the noi&s;e made in cutting the branches, attract it; and it alights behind them, and is entangled by the &s;pringe or limed twig, the in&s;tant they are &s;et.

They may al&s;o be caught in the open parts of the woods by means of poles, to which are fa&s;tened noo&s;es and limed twigs; but the &s;pringes are the mo&s;t &s;ure and &s;ucce&s;sful; nor is it requi&s;ite that the&s;e be baited; we need only &s;et them in the edge of glades, or in the middle of paths, and the un|fortunate little bird, pu&s;hed on by curio&s;ity, will throw it&s;elf into the &s;nare.</P>

<P>IN its &s;hape, its &s;ize, and its general appear|ance, this bird is an exact copy of the red-brea&s;t: the only difference is, that its throat is of a brilliant azure blue, while that of the other is orange red. Even in marking the di&s;crimi|nation between the&s;e birds, nature &s;eems to point at their analogy; for beneath this blue &s;pace; we may perceive a black &s;a&s;h and an orange red zone which bounds the top of the brea&s;t: this orange tint again appears on the fir&s;t half of the lateral quills of the tail; from the corner of the bill, a &s;treak of ru&s;ty white pa&s;&s;es over the eye; and in general the colours, though darker, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the red-brea&s;t. They &s;hare al&s;o the &s;ame habits, only their haunts are different: the red-brea&s;t
<PB N="196" REF="221">
lives in the heart of the woods; but the blue-throat frequents their &s;kirts, and &s;eeks mar&s;hes, wet meadows, and places that abound with willows and reeds: and with the &s;ame &s;olitary in&s;tinct as the red-brea&s;t, it &s;eems alike di&s;po&s;ed to be familiar with man; for, after the &s;um|mer months are &s;pent in its &s;eque&s;tered retreats, it vi&s;its the gardens, avenues, and hedges, be|fore its departure, and ventures &s;o near that it may be &s;hot with the trunk.</P>
<P>Like the red-brea&s;ts, they never keep in flocks, and &s;eldom more than two are &s;een together. In the end of &s;ummer, &s;ays Lottinger, the blue-throats alight in the fields that are &s;own with large &s;orts of grain. Fri&s;ch mentions fields of pea&s;e as their favourite haunt, and even pre|tends that they breed among the&s;e; but their ne&s;t is more commonly found in the willows, the o&s;iers, and other bu&s;hes which grow in wet &s;ituations: it is formed of herbs interwoven at the origin of the branches or boughs.</P>
<P>In the love &s;ea&s;on, the male mounts perpen|dicular to a little height in the air, chant|ing as he ri&s;es; he whirls round, and drops back on his bough as cheerfully as the petty-chaps, of which the blue-throat &s;eems to have &s;ome habits. He al&s;o &s;ings in the night; and, according to Fri&s;ch, his warble is very &s;weet. Hermann, on the contrary, informs us, that it

This contradiction is owing, perhaps, to the different times at which the&s;e ob&s;ervers heard the bird; for as great difference would have been found between the ordinary chirp of our red-brea&s;t, and its mel|low, tender &s;ong in the &s;pring, or its pretty warble which cheers the bright days of au|tumn.</P>
<P>The blue-throat is as fond of bathing as the red-brea&s;t, and oftener haunts the margins of water. It lives on worms and other in&s;ects; and in the &s;ea&s;on of its pa&s;&s;age it eats elder|berries. It may be &s;een among the fens, &s;eek|ing its food on the ground, and running bri&s;kly, and cocking its tail, e&s;pecially the male, when he hears the real or imitated voice of the fe|male.</P>
<P>The young ones are of a blacki&s;h brown, and have not a&s;&s;umed the blue tint of the throat; the males have only &s;ome brown feathers amid&s;t the white of the throat and brea&s;t. The female never has the whole of the blue &s;pace on the throat; &s;he is only marked with a cre&s;cent or a bar below the neck: and on this difference, and on the figure of Edwards, who has given

The others, which are more nume|rous, have a &s;pot like a half collar, of a fine white, which Fri&s;ch compares to the lu&s;tre of poli&s;hed &s;ilver <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Linnaeus is probably mi&s;taken when he de&s;cribes this colour as a dull, yellowi&s;h white. <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI></NOTE>; and, from this character, the bird-catchers at Brandenburg have applied to the blue-throat the name of <HI>mirror-bird.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e rich colours tarni&s;h and fade in con|finement, and even after the fir&s;t moulting. The blue-throats are caught with the noo&s;e, like the nightingales, and with the &s;ame bait.

We &s;ee, from the denomination of Bri&s;&s;on's <HI>pretended</HI> &s;econd &s;pecies, that this bird is found even at Gibraltar. It is al&s;o &s;een in Provence, where the people call it <HI>blue ru&s;&s;et-bottom.</HI> And from the name which Linnaeus be&s;tows, we might &s;uppo&s;e that it is a native of Sweden <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Motacilla Suecica.</NOTE>; but this proves only that the blue-throat vi&s;its the northern regions. It leaves them in autumn, and travels into milder climates in que&s;t of food; and this habit, or rather this nece&s;&s;ity, is common to the blue|throat, and all the birds which feed on in&s;ects, or on &s;oft fruits. <NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Specific character of the Blue-throat, <HI>Motacilla Suecica:</HI> "Its brea&s;t is ferruginous, with a blue &s;tripe; its tail quills du&s;ky, and ferruginous near the ba&s;e."

<HEAD>THE FIG-EATERS. LES FIGUIERS, <HI>Buff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THESE birds are of a genus approaching to that of the fig-peckers, and re&s;emble the&s;e in their principal characters. Their bill is &s;traight, &s;lender, and very acute, with two &s;mall &s;callops near the extremity of the upper man|dible; a property which they have in common with the tanagres, in which however the bill is much thicker and &s;horter. The no&s;trils of the fig-eaters are uncovered, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the titmice: the angle of their hind nail is arched, which &s;eparates them from the larks; and therefore they mu&s;t be ranged by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We are acquainted with five &s;pecies of fig-eaters in the hot countries of the old continent, and twenty-nine in tho&s;e of America: the&s;e differ from the former in the &s;hape of the tail, which is regularly tapered in the &s;pecies that inhabit the old continent, but notched at the end in the natives of America, and almo&s;t fork|ed, the two middle quills being &s;horter than the

<P>WHEN we compare the birds which inha|bit the two continents, we perceive that tho&s;e with &s;trong bills, and which feed upon grain, are the mo&s;t numerous in the old; but, on the contrary, tho&s;e which have &s;lender bills, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon in&s;ects, predominate in the new. This circum&s;tance &s;trikingly evinces the exten&s;ive influence which human indu&s;try has upon the productions of nature: for it is ob|viou&s;ly the cultivation of the various &s;orts of corn, &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;upport of man, that has multiplied the granivorous birds. In the va&s;t de&s;erts of America, in her magnificent fo|re&s;ts, and her immen&s;e &s;avannas, where rude una&s;&s;i&s;ted nature yields nothing &s;imilar to our corn, and affords only fruits and &s;mall &s;eeds, with enormous quantities of in&s;ects, there the number of the &s;pecies of birds which feed on the&s;e, and have &s;lender bills, is proportionally great: but an in&s;en&s;ible gradation connects the various productions of the univer&s;e, and bids defiance to the &s;hackles of &s;y&s;tem.

It is called <HI>bimbel&egrave;</HI> by the negroes, from its re&s;emblance to an African bird of that name. But probably this appellation is not better ap|plied than that of ba&s;tard linnet; for the bird re&s;embles the linnet neither in its &s;ong, in its plumage, nor the &s;hape of its bill.</P>
<P>Its &s;ong is not varied or rich: it turns on four or five notes. However, it is plea&s;ant: for the tones are full, &s;oft, and mellow.</P>
<P>It lives on fruits and &s;mall &s;eeds. It prefers the haunt of the palms, and builds its ne&s;t in a
<PB N="334" REF="366">
&s;ort of roo&s;t, which the palm birds and others form on tho&s;e trees, at the place where the foot|&s;talk &s;upporting the clu&s;ter is in&s;erted. It lays only two or three eggs, and this is perhaps one of the rea&s;ons the <HI>bimbel&egrave;s</HI> are &s;o rare.</P>
<P>Its plumage is &s;till inferior to its &s;ong: the throat, the fore part of the neck, the brea&s;t, and the top of the belly, are dirty white, tinged with yellow: the legs, the lower belly, and the inferior coverts of the tail, are of a faint yel|low; the flanks deep gray: all the upper part brown, deeper on the head, and lighter on the back: the rump and the &s;uperior coverts of the tail are olive green: the quills, and the &s;upe|rior coverts of the wings, and the quills of the tail, brown, edged exteriorly with a lighter co|lour: the two outer pairs of the tail quills edged interiorly with a broad bar of pure white near their extremity: the lower face of all the&s;e quills is of a &s;late gray: the iris is light brown.</P>
<P>The <HI>bimbel&eacute;</HI> weighs rather le&s;s than two gros and an half.</P>
<P>Total length five inches; the bill &s;even lines, very acute; the no&s;trils oblong, with a protu|berance; the alar extent &s;even inches; eighteen quills in each wing; the tail about eighteen

<P>WE have already noticed a Jamaica bird among the finches, and termed it <HI>bo|nana,</HI> but which mu&s;t be di&s;criminated from this. The pre&s;ent is much &s;maller, its plumage is different, and, though it haunts the &s;ame tree, its habits are probably di&s;tinct. We might de|cide this matter, if the bird mentioned by Sloane were as well known as that which we are to de&s;cribe from a coloured drawing, and an ac|count of it &s;ent by the Chevalier De&s;hayes. It is found in Saint Domingo, and the negroes affirm that it &s;u&s;pends its ne&s;t: it is often &s;een on the bananas; but other birds al&s;o feed on the fruit of the&s;e trees, and therefore the name is not appropriated to it.</P>
<P>The banana warbler has a bill &s;omewhat curved, very acute, and of a middle &s;ize. Be|&s;ides bananas, it feeds on oranges, citronelles, avigato pears, and papaws. We cannot decide whether it al&s;o eats &s;eeds or in&s;ects; but cer|tainly
<PB N="337" REF="369">
there were no traces of the&s;e in the &s;to|mach of the one di&s;&s;ected. It lodges in the ba|nana plantations, in the grounds uncultivated and covered with bu&s;hes. It flies by &s;tarts and jerks, and its motion is rapid, and attended with a little noi&s;e. Its warble is &s;carcely varied: it is a &s;eries of cadences that re&s;t more or le&s;s on the &s;ame tone.</P>
<P>But though the Bonana flies &s;wiftly, De&s;hayes regards it as too weak and delicate to perform di&s;tant journeys, and to &s;upport the cold of the northern climates; he therefore concludes it to be a native of the new continent.</P>
<P>The upper &s;ide of the body is of a deep gray, almo&s;t blacki&s;h, which approaches to brown on the tail, and the coverts of the wings: the quills of the tail are not &s;o deep coloured as tho&s;e of the wings, and are tipped with white: it has a &s;ort of white eyebrows: the eyes are placed in a black bar, which ri&s;es from the bill, and melts into the dark colour of the back of the head: the throat is a&s;h gray: the brea&s;t, the belly, and the rump, are of a delicate yellow: the flanks, the thighs, and the inferior coverts of the tail, are variegated with light yellow and gray: &s;ome of the inferior coverts are white, and ri&s;e on the tail: the anterior part of the &s;houlders is of a fine yellow: the bill is black; the legs &s;late gray.</P>

<P>ALL that Edwards, who fir&s;t de&s;cribed and figured this bird, mentions in regard to its hi&s;tory, is, that it is a native of South Ame|rica and of the adjacent i&s;lands, &s;uch as Cayenne.

<HEAD>THE PITPITS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the&s;e birds bear great re&s;em|blance to the fig-eaters, and al&s;o inhabit the new continent, the difference is &s;till &s;o con&s;ider|able, that they ought to be regarded as forming a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate genus. Mo&s;t of the fig-eaters are migratory: all the pitpits continue &s;ettled in the hotte&s;t parts of America. They remain in the woods, and perch on the large trees; whereas the fig-eaters haunt only the cleared grounds, and lodge among the bu&s;hes, and on the middle-&s;ized trees. The pitpits are al&s;o more &s;ocial than the fig-eaters: they keep in large flocks, and mix familiarly with the &s;mall birds of other &s;pecies: they are more joy|ous and lively, and are continually hopping. But be&s;ides the difference of their habits, they are al&s;o di&s;criminated by their conformation: their bill is thicker, and not &s;o &s;lender as that of the fig-eaters; and for this rea&s;on we have placed the middle-bills between them and the fig-eaters. The tail of the pitpits is al&s;o &s;quare-terminated, while, in the fig-eaters, it is &s;omewhat forked. The&s;e two characters, drawn
<PB N="343" REF="375">
from the bill and the tail, are a &s;ufficient founda|tion for forming two genera of the&s;e birds.</P>
<P>We know only five &s;pecies of the pitpits, and they are all found in Guiana and Brazil, and are nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize.</P>

<P>THE pitpits are in general nearly as large as the fig-eaters, but rather thicker: they are four and a half or five inches long. In the kind which we call the <HI>green pitpit</HI> the head and the &s;mall &s;uperior coverts of the wings only are of a &s;ine blue, and the throat of a bluei&s;h gray; but all the re&s;t of the body and the great &s;upe|rior coverts of the wings are of a brilliant green: the quills of the wings are brown, edged exte|riorly with green: tho&s;e of the tail are of a duller green: the bill is brown, and the legs gray.

<HEAD>VARIETIES of the BLUE PITPIT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The bird called by Edwards the <HI>blue mana|kin:</HI> for the only difference it has from the blue pitpit is, that the throat is black, and the face, as well as the &s;ides of the head, blue, like the re&s;t of the body.</P>

2. The bird figured in the <HI>Planches Enlumi|n&eacute;es,</HI> No. 669, fig. 1, and denominated the <HI>Blue Pitpit of Cayenne;</HI> the only difference be|ing, that it has no black on the face, or on the &s;ides of the head.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t ob&s;erve that Bri&s;&s;on regards the Mexican bird given by Fernandez under the name of <HI>elotototl,</HI> as a blue pitpit: but we can|not di&s;cover any foundation for this opinion; &s;ince Fernandez is the only one who has &s;een that bird, and all that he &s;ays is, "that the <HI>elotototl</HI> is hardly &s;o large as a goldfinch; that it is white or bluei&s;h, and its tail black; that it inhabits the mountains of Tetzocano; that its fle&s;h is palatable; that it has no &s;ong; and, for that rea&s;on, is not bred in hou&s;es."

<P N="1">I. THE RUBY-CROWNED WREN. I can|not help con&s;idering this Penn&s;ylvanian bird as a variety in point of &s;ize of our gold-cre&s;ted wren. In fact, its cre&s;t differs little either in &s;hape or colour, being rounder indeed, and of a purer and deeper red, emulating the lu&s;tre of the ruby, and not edged with a black zone. Al&s;o the upper &s;ide of the body is olive, which is deeper on the fore parts, and lighter on the rump, without any mixture of yellow: there is a tint of yellow on the lower part of the body, and deeper on the brea&s;t. But the greate&s;t difference con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ize, it being larger and heavier than the common gold-cre&s;ted wren in the proportion of eleven to eight. For the re&s;t, the only difference con&s;i&s;ts in a few &s;hades of the plumage: I &s;peak of the dried &s;peci|mens, for the habits and oeconomy of the ruby-crowned wren are entirely unknown; and if ever the&s;e be di&s;covered to be the &s;ame with tho&s;e of our gold-cre&s;ted wren, the identity of the &s;pecies will be completely e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>

<P>THOUGH Aldrovandus has re&s;tricted the word <HI>parra</HI> to the gold-cre&s;ted wren, I con|ceive that Pliny employed it to &s;ignify in gene|ral the titmice, and that he regarded this genus as a branch of the family of woodpeckers, which he accounted more exten&s;ive than is admitted by the modern naturali&s;ts. My rea&s;ons are as follow:</P>
<P N="1">1. Pliny &s;ays, that the woodpeckers are the only birds which breed in hollow trees <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pullos educant in cavis avium &s;oli.</HI> Lib. x. 18.</NOTE>; and it is well known that many &s;pecies of titmice do the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="380" REF="413">
2. All that he &s;ays in regard to certain woodpeckers, that they climb the trees like cats, that they hang with their heads down|ward, that they &s;eek their food beneath the bark, that they &s;trike it with their bill, &amp;c. agrees equally with the titmice and the wood|peckers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scandentes in &s;ubrectum &s;elium modo; illi vero &amp; &s;upini percu&s;&s;i corticis &s;ono, pabulum &s;ube&s;&s;e intelligunt.</HI> Plin. lib. x. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. The account which he gives of other woodpeckers that &s;u&s;pend their ne&s;t from the end of young branches, to prevent any qua|druped from approaching it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Picorum aliquis &s;u&s;pendit in &s;urculo (nidum).... ut nullus accedere po&s;&s;it.</HI> Lib. x. 33.</NOTE>, will only &s;uit &s;ome kinds of titmice, &s;uch as the penduline and the Languedoc, and not at all the wood|peckers properly &s;o called.</P>
<P N="4">4. We &s;carce can &s;uppo&s;e, that Pliny never heard of the penduline and Languedoc titmice, &s;ince one of them at lea&s;t breeds in Italy; and it is equally improbable that, being acquainted with this fact, he would omit to in&s;ert it in his Natural Hi&s;tory. But the pa&s;&s;age alluded to is the only one that applies to the&s;e birds; and they mu&s;t therefore have been included in the family of woodpeckers.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="414">
Moreover, the appellation of <HI>parrae</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In genere parrarum e&s;t, cui nidus ex mu&s;co arido ita ab|&s;oluta perficitur pila, ut inveniri non po&s;&s;it aditus.</HI> Plin. lib. x. 33. See Belon, p. 343.</NOTE> &s;eems to have been peculiarly be&s;towed on this branch of the woodpeckers; for in the genus of <HI>parrae,</HI> &s;ays Pliny, there are &s;ome which form their ne&s;t of dry mo&s;s into a ball, and &s;hut it &s;o clo&s;ely that the aperture can &s;carce be found. This applies to the common wren, which has been &s;ometimes confounded with the gold-cre&s;ted wren and the titmice. There is another &s;pecies which builds in the &s;ame manner, only employing hemp and flax for the materials; and this is the property of the long-tailed titmou&s;e. Since the name <HI>parrae</HI> therefore comprehended many &s;pecies, and the account of the&s;e agrees with the quali|ties of the titmice, it will follow that the genus is really that of the titmice. This idea is the more probable, as the epithet <HI>argatilis,</HI> which is given by Pliny to one of the&s;e &s;pecies, is &s;o like the Greek name <HI>aigithalos,</HI> which Ari&s;totle applies to the titmice, that we cannot help regarding it the &s;ame, only &s;omewhat altered in tran&s;crip|tion. Be&s;ides, Pliny u&s;es the word <HI>aigithalos</HI> in no other part, though he was well acquainted with Ari&s;totle's works, and had con&s;ulted them expre&s;sly in compo&s;ing his tenth book, which

<P>The titmice have al&s;o been confounded with the bee-eaters, becau&s;e they are both <HI>apivorous:</HI> they have been confounded too with the goat-&s;uckers, on account of the re&s;emblance of the Greek names <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is commonly reckoned a primitive word, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is compounded of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, a goat, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, a nip|ple.

I have al&s;o learned from experience, that the ox-eye kept in the cage &s;ometimes cleaves the &s;kull of the young birds that are pre&s;ented to it, and feeds greedily on the brain. Hebert a&s;|certained nearly the &s;ame fact by an experiment which he made: he put a red-brea&s;t in the &s;ame cage with eight or ten ox-eyes, about nine in the morning; and again&s;t mid-day the &s;cull of the red-brea&s;t was bored, and the brain entire|ly eaten.

<P>I KNOW that many naturali&s;ts regard this bird as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the preceding by con|&s;iderable differences. Willughby &s;ays that it is larger, its tail longer, and that it has le&s;s black under its throat; that the white of the lower &s;ide of its body is purer, and that it has no white on the back of the head, or on the wings.

<P>The mar&s;h titmou&s;e lives more in the woods than in the vineyards and gardens, feeding on &s;mall &s;eeds, preying on wa&s;ps, bees and gra&s;|hoppers, and forming &s;tores of hemp &s;eeds, when there is occa&s;ion, carrying &s;everal at once in its bill to place in the depo&s;it, and con&s;uming them afterwards at lei&s;ure. Its manner of eat|ing undoubtedly gives it this fore&s;ight: it re|quires time and a convenient place to pierce each &s;eed with its bill; and if it had not collect|ed provi&s;ions, it would often be reduced to want.</P>
<P>The mar&s;h titmou&s;e is found in Sweden, and even in Norway, in the fore&s;ts which &s;kirt the Danube, in Lorraine, in Italy, &amp;c.

through the whole year; it can hardly be bred in the cage. A ne&s;t was brought to me which was found in a hollow apple-tree in the mid&s;t of a little clump, not far from a river: it con&s;i&s;ted of a little mo&s;s laid in the bottom of the hole. The young ones, which were al|ready able to fly, were rather browner than the parent, but their legs were of a lighter lead colour; no &s;caloping on the edges of the bill, of which the two mandibles were very equal. What was remarkable, the gizzard of the young ones was larger than that of the adults in the ratio of five to three; the inte&s;tinal tube was al&s;o proportionally longer; but neither of them had a gall bladder or the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of a <HI>caecum.</HI> I found in the gizzard of the parent &s;ome frag|ments of in&s;ects and a grain of dry earth, and in that of the young ones &s;everal little pebbles.</P>

<P>FEW birds are &s;o well known as this; be|cau&s;e few are &s;o common, &s;o ea&s;ily caught, or &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by the colours of their plumage. Blue predominates on the upper &s;ide, yellow on the lower; and a nice di&s;tribution of black and white di&s;criminates and heightens the different hues, which are al&s;o diver&s;ified by a variety of different &s;hades. The blue titmou&s;e is the better known on account of its pernicious vi&s;its to our gardens, where it plucks the blo&s;&s;oms from the fruit-trees: it even dexterou&s;ly employs its little claws to detach the ripe fruit from the branch, which it after|wards carries to its depo&s;it. But it does not &s;ub&s;i&s;t wholly in this way; it has the &s;ame
<PB N="413" REF="447">
propen&s;ity to fle&s;h with other titmice, and it picks &s;o clean the bodies of the little birds which it ma&s;ters, that Klein propo&s;es to em|ploy it for preparing their &s;keletons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He advi&s;es us previou&s;ly to remove mo&s;t of the fle&s;h and the brain of the bird, who&s;e &s;keleton we want to have prepared.</NOTE>. It al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf above all the re&s;t by its ran|cour again&s;t the owl. The Vi&s;count de Quer|ho&euml;nt ob&s;erves, that it does not always &s;plit the &s;eeds of hemp like the other titmice, but brui&s;es them in its bill, like the canaries and linnets: he adds, that it &s;hews more fore&s;ight than the re&s;t, &s;ince it &s;elects for its winter haunt a warmer &s;ite, and one of more difficult acce&s;s; commonly a hollow tree, or the crevice of a wall.</P>
<P>The female al&s;o builds in holes, and is not &s;par|ing of feathers; &s;he lays in the month of April a great many &s;mall white eggs: I have counted from eight to &s;eventeen in the &s;ame ne&s;t; others have found even twenty-one. I am a&s;&s;ured that there is only one hatch, unle&s;s the incubation is di&s;turbed: a &s;ingle egg broken, or even handled, will occa&s;ion the whole to be for&s;aken. But after the young are excluded, the mother di&s;covers a &s;trong attachment, and defends them with courage; &s;he is inflamed, and whi&s;tles a

threatening air when di&s;turbed in her pri&s;on. The cock &s;eems to repo&s;e more at ea&s;e, and oftene&s;t clung to the top of the cage. Be&s;ides the di&s;agreeable grinding, it has a &s;lender but varied chirp, which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of the chaffinch.</P>
<P>Fri&s;ch alleges that the blue titmou&s;e will not live in the cage, and cannot therefore be u&s;ed as a call-bird. I have &s;een &s;ome, however, that were kept many months in confinement, and died only of exce&s;&s;ive fat.</P>
<P>Schwenckfeld tells us, that in Sile&s;ia this tit|mou&s;e is found at all &s;ea&s;ons on the mountains. With us, it prefers the woods, e&s;pecially in &s;um|mer, and next to the&s;e the vineyards, the gar|dens, &amp;c. Lottinger &s;ays, that it travels in company with the ox-eye; but the &s;ociety be|tween petulant and cruel animals mu&s;t be tur|bulent and temporary.

<P>The blue titmou&s;e is very little, &s;ince it weighs only three gros: but Belon, Klein, and the traveller Kolben, ought not to have repre|&s;ented it as the &s;malle&s;t of the titmice. The hen is rather &s;maller than the cock, and has le&s;s

Albin &s;ays were reported to inhabit the coun|ties of E&s;&s;ex and Lincoln, and always among the fens?</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed that the habits of the&s;e birds were better known. Their hi&s;tory would be curious, if we may judge from what is re|lated, that when they re&s;t the male &s;preads his wings over his mate; and this attention, were it well authenticated, mu&s;t imply many other intere&s;ting particulares with regard to incuba|tion.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t characteri&s;tic feature of the male is a black mark, very nearly triangular, on each &s;ide of the head: the ba&s;e of this inverted tri|angle ri&s;es a little above the eyes, and its ver|tex is turned downwards, and falls on the neck nine or ten lines from the ba&s;e: the&s;e two black marks, which have pretty long feathers, bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to whi&s;kers, and hence the names of the bird in different countries. Fri&s;ch &s;uppo&s;es that it is analogous to the canary, and that the two &s;pecies would intermix; but adds, that the bearded titmice are too rare for making the nece&s;&s;ary experiments. This opi|nion of Fri&s;ch is incon&s;i&s;tent with that of Ed|wards and Linnaeus, who &s;uppo&s;e it to re&s;emble the &s;hrike. But though the&s;e views be oppo&s;ite, they agree in one circum&s;tance, that the bill of the bearded titmou&s;e is larger than or|dinary
<PB N="418" REF="453">
in titmice. On the other hand, Lottin|ger affirms that it breeds in the holes of trees, and often con&s;orts with the long-tailed titmou&s;e; which, joined to the family likene&s;s and other re&s;emblances in &s;ize, exterior figure, mien, and habits, rank it with the titmice.</P>
<P>The head of the male is pearl gray; the throat, and the fore part of the neck, of a &s;ilvery white; the brea&s;t of a &s;ullied white tinged with gray in &s;ome &s;ubjects, and ro&s;e-colour in others; the re&s;t of the under &s;ide of the body ru&s;ty; the inferior coverts of the tail black; tho&s;e of the wings yellowi&s;h white; the upper &s;ide of the body light rufous; the anterior edge of the wings white; the &s;mall &s;uperior coverts black|i&s;h; the great ones edged with rufous, the middle ones with the &s;ame, edged interiorly with lighter rufous; the great quills edged with white externally; tho&s;e of the tail entirely ru|fous, except the outermo&s;t, which is blacki&s;h a$ the ba&s;e, and of a rufous a&s;h colour near it$ extremity; the iris orange; the bill yellowi&s;h and the legs brown.</P>
<P>In the female there is no red tinge under th$ body, nor black marks on the &s;ides of the head which is brown, and al&s;o the inferior coverts o$ the tail, of which the lateral quills are blacki&s;h tipt with white. The female is al&s;o rather &s;maller than the male.</P>

<P>EDWARDS &s;u&s;pects this bird, which is fi|gured in the work of Albin, to be the &s;ame with the bearded titmou&s;e; but this idea &s;eems contradicted by &s;everal circum&s;tances: 1. The figures referred to, though accurate, differ con|&s;iderably. 2. According to Albin, the bearded titmou&s;e weighs more than nine gros; and he repre&s;ents the mountain titmou&s;e as equal to the
<PB N="421" REF="456">
blue titmou&s;e, which is only three gros. 3. The plumage is different; and particularly the black bar on the &s;ide of the head has a very different po&s;ition in each. 4. The climate al&s;o differs: for Albin makes &s;ome of the coun|ties in England the ordinary haunt of the bearded titmou&s;e; but regards the penduline titmou&s;e as an inhabitant of Germany and Italy. Nor do Kramer and Linnaeus appear to judge better in con&s;idering the&s;e two birds as di&s;tin|gui&s;hed only by their &s;ex; and I cannot, with Edwards and Linnaeus, perceive any &s;trong re|&s;emblance between the&s;e and the &s;hrikes. It is true that the &s;hrikes have a black &s;tripe on the eyes, and that the penduline titmou&s;e inter|weaves its ne&s;t; but the materials are different, and al&s;o the manner of fa&s;tening the ne&s;t, the &s;hape of the bill, the claws, the food, the &s;ize, proportions, &s;trength, ge&s;ture, &amp;c.

<HEAD>THE CAPE TITMOUSE. Le Petit Deuil, <HI>Buff.</HI> Parus Capen&s;is, <HI>Gmel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS little titmou&s;e was brought from the Cape of Good Hope by Sonnerat, who publi&s;hed a de&s;cription of it in the <HI>Journal de Phy&s;ique.</HI> Its plumage is black, gray, and white; the head, the neck, the upper and under &s;ides of the body, light cinereous gray; the quills of the wings black, edged with white; the tail black above, and white below; the iris, the bill, and the legs black.</P>
<P>This bird re&s;embles tho&s;e preceding, parti|cularly the long-tailed titmou&s;e, in the manner it con&s;tructs its ne&s;t; which it places in the thicke&s;t bu&s;hes, but not at the extremity of the branches, as &s;ome naturali&s;ts have &s;uppo&s;ed. The cock a&s;&s;i&s;ts the hen in building; he &s;trikes his wings forcibly again&s;t the &s;ides of the ne&s;t, and compacts it into the form of an elongated ball; the aperture is in the &s;ide; the eggs in the centre, where they are &s;afe&s;t and warme&s;t.

Commer&s;on does not tell us if the &s;ame ardour pervades their other functions, and is di&s;played in the con|&s;truction of their ne&s;t, their incubation, &amp;c. and whether their brood is as numerous as in the other titmice. In the ordinary cour&s;e of nature the affirmative is the mo&s;t probable, though it may indeed be modified by climate, and peculiar in&s;tincts.</P>
<P>Their plumage is entirely of a &s;laty black, which appears equally on the upper and under &s;ide of the body, and the uniformity- of which is only interrupted by a bar divided by yellow and rufous, placed longitudinally on the wing, and formed by the exterior border of &s;ome of the middle quills: this bar has three indent|ings, at its origin, near the middle of the wing, which con&s;i&s;ts of fifteen or &s;ixteen quills dif|fering little in length.</P>

<P>Though the nuthatch &s;pends a great part of its time in climbing or creeping upon trees, its motions are quicker and nimbler than tho&s;e of the &s;parrow; they are al&s;o &s;moother and more connected, for it makes le&s;s noi&s;e in flying. It commonly lives in the woods, in the mo&s;t &s;oli|tary manner; yet if confined in a volery with other birds, &s;parrows, for in&s;tance, or finches, it will continue on good terms with them.</P>

The female is long invited, it is &s;aid, before &s;he will yield to the &s;olicitations; but, when the union is ac|compli&s;hed, both in concert labour in forming their ne&s;t. They fix it in the hole of a tree <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> Sometimes in the hole of a wall or of a roof, &s;ays Linnaeus.</NOTE>; and when they cannot find one that &s;uits them, they make an excavation with their bills, if the wood be worm-eaten: if the external aperture

be too large, they contract it with fat earth, and &s;ometimes with dirt, which they mould and fa&s;hion, it is &s;aid, as a potter would do his clay, and they &s;trengthen it with &s;mall &s;tones; and hence are derived the names <HI>ma&s;on-woodpecker</HI> and <HI>wipe-pot</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Torche-pot:</HI> this word comes from <HI>torche-poteux,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>wipe-hole.</HI></NOTE>.

Nor does &s;he leave her eggs to &s;eek food, but patiently expects the return of the male, who affectionately brings &s;upply.

"The pea&s;ants have ob&s;erved," &s;ays Belon, "that the cock beats the hen whenever he finds her after parting; and hence it is become a proverb, that a per&s;on who keeps his wife in due order is like a nuthatch." But the conduct of the hu&s;|band has no concern, I am confident, in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e: the female, as &s;he is the la&s;t to pair, is probably the fir&s;t in &s;eparating; and when the male meets her after a long ab&s;ence, he loads her with care&s;&s;es, and gives vent to rap|turous endearments, which inaccurate ob&s;ervers may mi&s;take for har&s;h u&s;age.</P>

<HEAD>THE CREEPERS. Les Grimpereaux, <HI>Buff.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have already treated of &s;everal creep|ing birds, the nuthatches and titmice: we &s;hall &s;ee others in the &s;equel, &s;uch as the woodpeckers; but the appellation of <HI>creepers</HI> is appropriated to the genus which we are now to con&s;ider. They creep very nimbly on trees, both in a&s;cending and de&s;cending; both on the upper and the under &s;ide of the branches: they run &s;wiftly along beams, cla&s;ping the edge with their little feet. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the woodpeckers by their bill and tongue; and from the titmice by the greater length of their bill; and from the nuthatches by its more &s;len|der and hooked form; and accordingly they do not &s;trike the bark with it, like the&s;e other birds.</P>
<P>Many foreign &s;pecies of creepers re&s;emble much the humming birds; by their diminutive &s;ize, by the rich colours of their plumage, by their &s;lender incurvated bill, only it is of a more lengthened and &s;harper form, while that of the
<PB N="474" REF="511">
humming bird is of an equal thickne&s;s through|out, or even &s;lightly inflated at the tip: the legs of the creepers are &s;horter, their wings longer, and their tail contains twelve quills, though that of the humming birds has only ten: and, la&s;tly, the tongue of the creepers is not, like that of the humming birds, compo&s;ed of two cylindri|cal half tubes, which, joined together, form an entire tube, and is properly an organ of re&s;pi|ration, and more analogous to the feeler of an in&s;ect than the tongue of a bird.</P>
<P>The genus of creepers is al&s;o &s;pread through a wider extent than that of the humming birds. The&s;e &s;eem peculiar to the continent of Ame|rica, and &s;eldom venture farther than the &s;outhern parts of Canada; and at that latitude the breadth of the ocean is too va&s;t to be tra|ver&s;ed by a little in&s;ect-bird. But the creeper of Europe penetrating to Denmark, or even beyond, tho&s;e of A&s;ia and America probably advanced al&s;o to the north, &s;o that an ea&s;y com|munication might be found from one continent to the other.</P>
<P>As the creepers live upon the &s;ame in&s;ects with the woodpeckers, the nuthatches, and the titmice, and cannot, from the defect of their bill, extract the in&s;ects lodged under the bark, they follow tho&s;e birds, which they make their
<PB N="475" REF="512">
providers, and dexterou&s;ly &s;natch the little prey. And &s;ince in&s;ects are their &s;ole &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, we may readily &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;pecies are more prolific and varied in hot climates, where &s;uch provi&s;ion abounds, than in cold or temperate climates, which are le&s;s favourable to the multiplication of in&s;ects. This is an ob|&s;ervation of Sonnerat, and it corre&s;ponds to facts.</P>
<P>It is a general remark, that the plumage of young birds is not &s;o bright as that of adults; but the difference is more &s;triking in the bril|liant tribes of the creepers, the humming birds, and other &s;mall birds that inhabit the immen&s;e fore&s;ts of America. Bajon informs us, that the colours of the&s;e are formed very gradually, and do not a&s;&s;ume their lu&s;tre till after a number of moultings.

<P>It is chiefly in winter that the&s;e birds appear near dwellings; and if we believe Belon, they are heard flying at a great di&s;tance in the air, de&s;cending from the mountains to lodge on the walls of cities.

<P>WE are acquainted with only three birds in the ancient continent to which this epithet belongs. Seba mentions al&s;o a female of that kind, which had not the long tail; whence it would appear that, in &s;ome &s;pecies at lea&s;t, this is the attribute of the male. And might not &s;everal males already de&s;cribed have attained the &s;ame character at the proper age or &s;ea&s;on? Many &s;ubjects which have been fi|gured and engraved, are perhaps only females, or young males, or even old ones in moult, when this decoration is lo&s;t.

<P>THIS and the three following have been reckoned American birds, and would therefore range with the guit-guits; but as from their conformation, and particularly the length of their bill, they are more related to the &s;oui|mangas, we have placed them between the two tribes. We adopt this plan the more rea|dily, as the climate of the&s;e birds re&s;ts &s;olely upon the authority of Seba, which naturali&s;ts know has little weight, and ever in&s;ufficient to balance again&s;t the force of analogy. We &s;hall not, however, hurt the received prejudices by changing the name; though that of &s;oui|manga would &s;uit them better.</P>
<P>Red is the prevailing colour in the plumage of this bird, but it has different &s;hades; for the crown of the head is lighter and more brilliant, and that on the re&s;t of the body is deeper. There are &s;ome exceptions, however: for the throat
<PB N="515" REF="554">
and the fore part of the neck are green; the quills of the tail and of the wings are terminated with bluei&s;h; the thighs, the bill, and the legs, of a light yellow.</P>
<P>Its voice is &s;aid to be plea&s;ant. It is a little larger than our creeper.</P>
<P>Total length, about four inches and a half; the bill, ten lines; the <HI>tar&s;us,</HI> &s;ix lines; the mid toe five lines, rather longer than the hind one; the tail fourteen lines, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve equal quills, and projecting about &s;even lines beyond the wings.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider as a variety of this &s;pecies the black-headed red bird, which Seba and &s;ome others after him have referred to New Spain. Its proportions are exactly like tho&s;e of the preceding: the only apparent difference is in the length of the bill, which is ten lines in the pre|ceding, and only &s;even in this, which would occa&s;ion a difference in the total length. But the&s;e mea&s;ures are taken from the figure, and therefore liable to error; e&s;pecially as the original ob&s;erver, Seba, &s;eems more &s;truck with its long bill than with that of the other. It is very probable that the de&s;igner or engraver took the liberty of &s;hortening it; and an alteration of three or four lines would bring the two birds to an almo&s;t perfect identity. There are &s;ome

<HEAD>THE AMERICAN GUIT-GUITS.</HEAD>
<P>GUIT-GUIT is an American name, ap|plied to one or two of this tribe, con|taining the creepers of the New Continent: I &s;hall u&s;e it as a generic appellation. I have al|ready noticed &s;ome differences that obtain be|tween them and the humming birds: I may add that they neither fly in the &s;ame manner, nor &s;ip the nectar of flowers. Yet the creoles at Cayenne frequently confound them; and we &s;hould be therefore aware of this circum|&s;tance in reading the relations of travellers.</P>
<P>I am a&s;&s;ured that the guit-guits of Cayenne never climb upon trees; that they live in flocks with tho&s;e of their own kind, and al&s;o with other birds, &s;uch as the little tanagres, nut|hatches, picucullas, &amp;c. and that they feed not only upon in&s;ects, but upon fruits and even buds.</P>

<P>THE face of this beautiful bird is of a bril|liant &s;ea green: there is a bar on the eyes of vel|vet black; the re&s;t of the head, the throat, and all the under part of the body (without excep|tion, according to Edwards), the lower part of the back, and the &s;uperior coverts of the tail, of an ultramarine blue, which is the only colour that appears when the feathers are regularly di&s;po&s;ed, though each has three colours, accord|ing to the remark of Bri&s;&s;on, brown at the ba&s;e, green in the middle, and blue at the ex|tremity; the top of the back, the part of the neck contiguous to the back, and the tail, velvet black: what appears of the wings, when they are clo&s;ed, is of the &s;ame black, except a blue bar, which cro&s;&s;es their coverts obliquely: the inner &s;ide of the quills of the wings, and their in&s;erior coverts, are of a fine yellow: &s;o that the wings, which &s;eem entirely black when at
<PB N="521" REF="560">
re&s;t, appear variegated with black and yellow when di&s;played, or in motion. The inferior coverts of the tail are of a dull black (and not blue, as Bri&s;&s;on repre&s;ents): the bill is black, and the legs &s;ometimes red, &s;ometimes orange, &s;ometimes yellow, and occa&s;ionally whiti&s;h.</P>
<P>It appears from this de&s;cription, that the co|lours of the plumage are &s;ubject to vary in dif|ferent &s;pecimens: in &s;ome, the throat is mixed with brown; in others it is black. In general, the di&s;tribution of the black &s;eems the mo&s;t ir|regular: the blue a&s;&s;umes &s;ometimes a violet tinge.</P>

<P>THIS variety is found in Cayenne: it dif|fers from the preceding only in the &s;hades of the plumage: the head is of a fine blue: there is a bar on the eyes of a velvet black: the throat, the wings, and the tail, are of the &s;ame black: all the re&s;t is of a &s;hining blue, verging upon violet; the bill black, and the legs yellow: the blue feathers which cover the body, are of three colours, the &s;ame as in the preceding.</P>
<P>With regard to &s;ize, it is rather &s;maller, and the tail e&s;pecially appears &s;horter; which would imply that it is either a young bird, or an adult that has not recovered from moulting; but the alar extent is greater, which precludes this &s;up|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It con&s;tructs its ne&s;t with much art: the out|&s;ide con&s;i&s;ts of coar&s;e &s;traw, and &s;tiff &s;talks of herbs; the in&s;ide of &s;ofter materials: the &s;hape re&s;embles that of a retort: it is &s;u&s;pended from
<PB N="523" REF="562">
the end of a pliant branch, and the aperture faces the ground. The bird enters the neck, and creeps into the belly of the retort, which is its proper ne&s;t. By this contrivance, the hatch is guarded again&s;t the vi&s;its of &s;piders, lizards, and other intruders. Wherever weak animals &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unprotected by man, we may infer that they are indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>The author of the E&s;&s;ay on the Natural Hi&s;|tory of Guiana <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bancroft.

<P>THE plumage of this American bird con|&s;i&s;ts of three or four colours, which are di&s;po&s;ed in di&s;tinct ma&s;&s;es, without any intermixture or &s;hading: a velvet black on the throat and head only; deep blue under the body; bright green on all the upper &s;ide, including the tail and the wings; but the tail is of a deeper &s;hade: the inferior coverts of the wings are cinereous brown, edged with green, and the bill is whiti&s;h.</P>

<P>ITS ordinary food is the &s;weet vi&s;cous juice of the &s;ugar cane, which it &s;ucks through the cracks of the &s;talk: &s;o I have been informed by a traveller who re&s;ided many years at Cayenne. In this re&s;pect it re&s;embles the humming birds; it is al&s;o exceedingly &s;mall; and from the rela|tive length of its wings, it approaches that of Cayenne, though it differs by the length of its legs and the &s;hortne&s;s of its tail. I &s;u&s;pect that the &s;ugar-birds likewi&s;e eat in&s;ects, though this has not been mentioned.</P>
<P>In a male from Jamaica, the throat, the neck, and the upper &s;ide of the head and body, were of a fine black, but with &s;ome exceptions; for there were white eyebrows, traces of white on the great quills of the wings, from their ori|gin to more than half their length, and al&s;o on
<PB N="533" REF="572">
the tips of all the lateral quills of the tail; the edge of the wings, the rump, the flanks and the belly, of a fine yellow, which &s;preads and grows dilute on the lower belly, and becomes whiti&s;h on the inferior coverts of the tail.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies is diffu&s;ed through Martinico, Cayenne, and St. Domingo, &amp;c. but the plum|age varies a little in the&s;e different i&s;lands, though nearly in the &s;ame parallel. In the &s;ugar-bird of Cayenne <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The negroes and creoles of St. Domingo call it <HI>Sicouri.</HI></NOTE>, the head is blacki&s;h; there are two white eyebrows, which extending meet behind the neck: the throat is light a&s;h gray; the back and the &s;uperior coverts of the wings of a deeper a&s;h gray; the quills of the wings and of the tail a&s;h gray, bordered with cinereous; the anterior part of the wings bor|dered with lemon yellow; the rump yellow; the brea&s;t and the under &s;ide of the body al&s;o yellow; but this colour is mixed with gray on the lower belly: the bill is black, and the legs bluei&s;h: the tail projects a very little beyond the wings.</P>
<P>This bird has a very delicate note, <HI>zi, zi,</HI> and, like the humming bird, al&s;o &s;ucks the juice of plants. Though I have been &s;trongly a&s;&s;ured that the one which I have de&s;cribed is a male,

<P>Sloane &s;ays, that this bird has a very &s;hort but plea&s;ant warble; but that was probably the female, and the male would &s;till have a &s;weeter air. The &s;ame ob&s;erver, who diffected one of the&s;e birds, tells us that the throat and gizzard were &s;mall, the latter not mu&s;cular, and lined by an inadhe&s;ive membrane; the liver bright red, and the inte&s;tines rolled into many circum|volutions.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a &s;ugar-bird from St. Domingo, in which the bill and the tail were rather &s;horter, the eyebrows white, and on the throat a &s;ort of whiti&s;h mark, which was larger than in the
