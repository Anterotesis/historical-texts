<P>THIS little Drama, which had
been thrown a&s;ide for many years, was
brought out la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, with &s;ome altera|tions,
for the benefit of Mr. KING, as a
token of regard for one, who, during
a long engagement, was never known,
unle&s;s confined by real illne&s;s, to di&s;appoint
the Public, or di&s;tre&s;s the Managers&mdash;The
Author is &s;incerely apprehen&s;ive that the
excellence of the performance upon the
&s;tage, will greatly le&s;&s;en its credit with the
readers in the clo&s;et.</P>

<P><HI>Sans doute mon cher Colonel</HI>&mdash;I'll meet you there without

<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! what is that, good Sir John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t meet your lawyers and creditors to-morrow,
and be told, what you have always turn'd a deaf ear to,
that the di&s;&s;ipation of your fortune and morals, mu&s;t be
followed by years of par&s;imony and repentance&mdash;as you
are fond of going abroad you may indulge that inclination
without having it in your power to indulge any other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The bumkin is no fool, and is damn'd &s;atirical&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This kind of quarantine for pe&s;tilential minds, will bring
you to your &s;en&s;es, and make you renounce foreign vices
and follies, and return with joy to your country and pro|perty
again&mdash;read that, my Lord, and know your fate.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Lord</HI> MINIKIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an abomination this is! that a man of fa&s;hion,
and a nobleman, &s;hall be oblig'd to &s;ubmit to the laws
of his country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank heaven, my Lord, we are in that country!&mdash;
You are &s;ilent, ladies&mdash;if repentance has &s;ubdu'd your
tongues, I &s;hall have hopes of you&mdash;a little country air might
perhaps do well&mdash;as you are di&s;tre&s;s'd, I am at your
&s;ervice&mdash;what &s;ay you, my Lady?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lady</HI> MIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>However appearances have condemn'd me, give me
leave to di&s;avow the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e appearances: My
mind has been tainted; but not profligate&mdash;your kindne&s;s
and example may re&s;tore me to my former natural Engli&s;h
con&s;titution.</P>

<P>Will you re&s;ign your Lady to me, my Lord for a time?</P>

<P>For ever, dear Sir John, without a murmur.</P>

<P>Guilty! the devil you are? of what?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mi&s;s</HI> TITT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of con&s;enting to marry one, whom my heart could not
approve, and coquetting with another which friend&s;hip,
duty, honour, morals, and every thing, but fa&s;hion, ought
to have forbidden.</P>

<P>Thus then, with the wife of one under this arm, and
the mi&s;tre&s;s of another, under this, I &s;ally forth a Knight
Errant, to re&s;cue di&s;tre&s;s'd dam&s;els from tho&s;e mon&s;ters,
foreign vices, and <HI>Bon Ton,</HI> as they call it; and I tru&s;t
that every Engli&s;h hand and heart here, will a&s;&s;i&s;t me in &s;o
