<P>THE numerous enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXVIII.</NOTE> whom Wol&s;ey's &s;udden
elevation, his a&s;piring character, and his haughty
deportment had rai&s;ed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1515.</NOTE> &s;erved only to rivet him
fa&s;ter in Henry's confidence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wol&s;ey's admini&s;tra|tion.</NOTE> who placed a pride in &s;up|porting
the choice, which he had made, and who was
incapable of yielding either to the murmurs of the people
or to the di&s;contents of the great. That artful prelate
likewi&s;e, well acquainted with the King's imperious
temper, concealed from him the absolute a&s;cendant,
<PB N="2" REF="10">
which he acquired; and while he &s;ecretly directed all
public councils, he ever pretended a blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to the will and authority of his ma&s;ter. By entering
into the King's plea&s;ures, he &s;till pre&s;erved his affections;
by conducting his bu&s;ine&s;s, he gratified his indolence;
and by his unlimited complai&s;ance in both capacities,
he prevented all that jealou&s;y, to which his exorbitant
acqui&s;itions, and his &s;plendid, o&s;tentatious train of life
&s;hould naturally have given birth. The archbi&s;hopric
of York falling vacant by the death of Bambrige, Wol&s;ey
was promoted to that &s;ee, and re&s;igned the bi&s;hopric of
Lincoln. Be&s;ides enjoying the admini&s;tration of Tour|nay,
he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, at very low lea&s;es, of the reve|nues
of Bath, Worce&s;ter, and Hereford, bi&s;hopricks
filled by Italians, who were allowed to re&s;ide abroad,
and who were glad to compound for this indulgence, by
parting with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of their profits. He
held in commendam the abbey of St. Albans, and many
other church preferments. He was even allowed to
unite with the &s;ee of York, fir&s;t that of Durham, next
that of Winche&s;ter; and there &s;eemed to be no end
of his acqui&s;itions. His advancement in eccle&s;ia&s;tical
dignity &s;erved him as a pretence for engro&s;&s;ing &s;till
more revenues; The pope, observing his great influence
over the King, was de&s;irous of engaging him in his
intere&s;t, and had created him a cardinal. Never church|man,
under colour of exacting regard to religion, car|ried
to a more exorbitant height, the &s;tate and dignity
of that character. His train con&s;i&s;ted of eight hundred
&s;ervants, of whom many were knights and gentlemen:
Some even of the nobility put their children into his
family as a place of education; and in order to ingra|tiate
them with their patron, allowed them to bear offices
as his &s;ervants. Whoever was di&s;tingui&s;hed by any art
or &s;cience payed court to the cardinal; and none payed
court in vain. Literature, which was then in its infancy,
<PB N="3" REF="11">
found in him a generous patron; and both by his public
in&s;titutions and private bounty, he gave encouragement
to every branch of erudition<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Era&s;m. Epi&s;t. lib. 2. epi&s;t. 1. lib. 16. epi&s;t. 3.</NOTE>. Not content with this
munificence, which gained him the approbation of the
wi&s;e, he &s;trove to dazzle the eyes of the populace, by
the &s;plendour of his equipage and furniture, the co&s;tly
embroidery of his liveries, the lu&s;tre of his apparel.
He was the fir&s;t clergyman in England who wore &s;ilk
and gold, not only on his habit, but al&s;o on his &s;ad|dles
and the trappings of his hor&s;es<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. Stowe, p. 501. Holling&s;hed, p. 847.</NOTE>. He cau&s;ed his
cardinal's hat to be borne aloft by a per&s;on of rank; and
when he came to the King's chapel, would permit it
to be laid on no place but the altar. A prie&s;t, the talle&s;t
and mo&s;t comely he could find, carried before him a
pillar of &s;ilver, on who&s;e top was placed a cro&s;s: But
not content with this parade, to which he thought him|&s;elf
intitled as cardinal, he provided another prie&s;t of
equal &s;tature and beauty, who marched along, bearing
the cro&s;s of York, even in the dioce&s;e of Canterbury;
contrary to the antient rule and agreement between the
prelates of the&s;e rival &s;ees<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. The people made merry
with the cardinal's o&s;tentation; and &s;aid they were now
&s;en&s;ible, that one cro&s;s alone was not &s;ufficient for the
expiation of his &s;ins and offences.</P>
<P>WARHAM, chancellor and archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a
man of a very moderate temper, aver&s;e to all di&s;putes, cho&s;e
rather to retire from public employment, than maintain
an unequal conte&s;t with the haughty cardinal. He re|&s;igned
his office of chancellor; and the &s;eals were im|mediately
intru&s;ted to Wol&s;ey. If this new accumulation
of dignity encrea&s;ed his enemies, it al&s;o &s;erved to exalt
his per&s;onal character, and prove the extent of his ca|pacity.
<PB N="4" REF="12">
A &s;trict admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice took place
during his enjoyment of this high office; and no chan|cellor
ever di&s;covered greater impartiality in his deci&s;ions,
deeper penetration of judgment, or more enlarged know|ledge
of law and equity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More. Stowe, p. 504.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, finding the King's money
almo&s;t entirely exhau&s;ted by projects and plea&s;ures, while
his inclination for expence &s;till continued, was glad to
re&s;ign his office of trea&s;urer, and retire from court.
His rival, Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, reaped no advan|tage
from his ab&s;ence; but partly overcome by years
and infirmities, partly di&s;gu&s;ted at the a&s;cendant acquired
by Wol&s;ey, withdrew him&s;elf entirely to the care of
his dioce&s;e. The duke of Suffolk had al&s;o taken offence,
that the King, by the cardinal's per&s;ua&s;ion, had refu&s;ed
to pay a debt, which he had contracted during his abode
in France; and he thenceforth affected to live in pri|vacy.
The&s;e incidents left Wol&s;ey to enjoy without a
rival the whole power and favour of the King; and put
into his hands every kind of authority. In vain, did
Fox, before his retirement, warn the King &startq;not to
&s;uffer the &s;ervant to be greater than his ma&s;ter:&endq;
Henry replied, &startq;that he knew well how to retain all
his &s;ubjects in obedience;&endq; but he continued &s;till an
unlimited deference in every thing to the directions and
coun&s;els of the cardinal.</P>
<P>THE public tranquillity was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in
England, the obedience of the people &s;o entire, the
general admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by the cardinal's
means<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Era&s;m. lib. 2, epi&s;t. 1. Cavendi&s;h, Hall.</NOTE>, &s;o exact, that no dome&s;tic occurrence happened
&s;o remarkable as to di&s;turb the repo&s;e of the King and
his mini&s;ter: They might even have di&s;pen&s;ed with
<PB N="5" REF="13">
them&s;elves from giving any &s;trict attention to foreign
affairs, were it po&s;&s;ible for men to enjoy any &s;ituation in
ab&s;olute tranquillity, or ab&s;tain from projects and enter|prizes,
however fruitle&s;s and unnec$&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE will of the late King of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots affairs.</NOTE> who left his
widow regent of the kingdom, and the vote of the con|vention
of e&s;tates, which confirmed that de&s;tination,
had expre&s;sly limited her authority to the condition of
her remaining unmarried<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond. Herbert.</NOTE>: But notwith&s;tanding this
limitation, a few months after her hu&s;band's death, &s;he
e&s;pou&s;ed the earl of Angus, of the name of Douglas, a
nobleman of great family and very promising hopes. Some
of the nobility now propo&s;ed the election of Angus as
regent, and recommended this choice as the mo&s;t likely
means of pre&s;erving peace with England: But the
jealou&s;y of the great families, and the fear of exalting
the Dougla&s;&s;es, begot oppo&s;ition to this mea&s;ure. Lord
Hume in particular, the mo&s;t powerful chieftain in the
kingdom, in&s;i&s;ted on recalling the duke of Albany, &s;on
to a brother of James the third, who had been bani&s;hed
into France, and who, having there married, had left
po&s;terity, that were the next heirs to the crown, and the
neare&s;t relations to their young &s;overeign. Albany,
though fir&s;t prince of the blood, had never been
in Scotland, was totally unacquainted with the man|ners
of the people, ignorant of their Situation, un|practiced
in their language; yet &s;uch was the favour
attending the French alliance, and &s;o great the autho|rity
of Hume, that this prince was invited to accept
the reins of, government. Francis, careful not to give
offence to the king of England, detained Albany &s;ome
time in France; but at la&s;t, &s;en&s;ible how important it
was to keep Scotland in his intere&s;ts, he permitted him
<PB N="6" REF="14">
to go over, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the regency: He even
renewed the antient league with that kingdom tho' it
implied &s;uch a clo&s;e connexion, as might be thought
&s;omewhat to intrench on his alliance with England.</P>
<P>WHEN the regent arrived in Scotland, he made en|quiries
concerning the &s;tate of the country, and charac|ter
of the people; and di&s;covered a &s;cene, with which
he was hitherto but little acquainted. That turbulent
kingdom, he found, was rather to be con&s;idered as a
confederacy, and that not a clo&s;e one, of petty princes,
than a regular &s;y&s;tem of civil polity; and even the King,
much more a regent, po&s;&s;e&s;t an authority very uncertain
and precarious. Arms, more than laws, prevailed;
and courage, preferably to equity or ju&s;tice, was the
virtue mo&s;t valued and re&s;pected. The nobility, in
whom the whole power re&s;ided, were &s;o connected by
hereditary alliances, or &s;o divided by inveterate enmities,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible, without employing force, either
to puni&s;h, the mo&s;t flagrant guilt, or give &s;ecurity to the
mo&s;t entire innocence. Rapine and violence, when
exerci&s;ed on a ho&s;tile tribe, in&s;tead of making a per&s;on
odious among his own clan, rather recommended him to
e&s;teem and approbation, and by rendering him u&s;eful
to the chieftain, entitled him to a preference above his
fellows. And tho' the nece&s;&s;ity of mutual &s;upport
&s;erved as a clo&s;e cement of friend&s;hip among tho&s;e of the &s;ame
kindred, the &s;pirit of revenge again&s;t enemies, and the
de&s;ire of pro&s;ecuting the deadly feuds, (&s;o they were
called) &s;till appeared to be pa&s;&s;ions the mo&s;t predominant
among that uncultivated people.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons, to whom Albany fir&s;t applied for in|formation
with regard to the &s;tate of the country, hap|pened
to be inveterate enemies of Hume<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond.</NOTE>; and they
<PB N="7" REF="15">
repre&s;ented that powerful nobleman as the chief &s;ource
of public di&s;orders, and the great ob&s;tacle to the execution
of the laws, and admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. Before
the authority of the magi&s;trate could be e&s;tabli&s;hed, it
was nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;aid, to make an example of this
great offender; and by the terror of his puni&s;hment,
teach all le&s;&s;er criminals to pay re&s;pect to the power of
their &s;overeign. Albany, moved by the&s;e rea&s;ons, was
induced to forget Hume's pa&s;t &s;ervices, to which he had
been, in a great mea&s;ure, beholden for the regency; and
he no longer bore towards him that favourable counte|nance,
with which he was wont to receive him. Hume
perceived the change, and was incited, both by views of
his own &s;ecurity and his revenge, to take mea&s;ures in
oppo&s;ition to the regent. He applied him&s;elf to Angus
and the queen dowager, and repre&s;ented to them the
danger to which the infant prince was expo&s;ed, from the
ambition of Albany, the next heir to the crown, to
whom the &s;tates had imprudently entru&s;ted the whole
authority of government. By his per&s;wa&s;ion, Margaret
formed the de&s;ign of carrying off the young King, and
putting him under the protection of her brother; and
when that con&s;piracy was di&s;covered, &s;he her&s;elf, ac|companied
with, Hume and Angus, withdrew into
England, where &s;he was &s;oon after delivered of a
daughter.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to check the authority of Albany
and the French party, gave encouragement to the&s;e
malecontents, and a&s;&s;ured them of his protection. Mat|ters
being afterwards in appearance accommodated be|tween
Hume and the regent, that nobleman returned
into his own country; but mutual &s;u&s;picions and jea|lou&s;ies
&s;till prevailed. He was committed to cu&s;tody,
under the care of the earl of Arran, his brother-in-law;
and was, for &s;ome time, detained pri&s;oner in his ca&s;tle.
<PB N="8" REF="16">
But having per&s;waded Arran to enter into the con&s;piracy
with him, he was allowed to make his e&s;cape; and he
openly made war upon the regent. A new accommoda|tion
en&s;ued, not more &s;incere than the foregoing; and
Hume was &s;o imprudent as to put him&s;elf, together with
his brother, into the hands of the regent. They were
immediately &s;eized, committed to cu&s;tody, brought to
their trial, condemned and executed. No legal crime
was proved again&s;t the&s;e brothers: It was only alleged,
that, at the battle of Flouden, they had not done their
duty in &s;upporting the King; and as this backwardne&s;s
could not, from the whole cour&s;e of their pa&s;t life, be
a&s;cribed to cowardice, it was commonly imputed to a
more criminal motive. The evidences, however, of guilt
produced again&s;t them, were far from, being valid or
convincing; and the people, who hated them while
alive, were very much di&s;&s;atisfied with their execution.</P>
<P>SUCH violent remedies often produce, for &s;ome time,
a deceitful tranquillity; but as they de&s;troy mutual con|fidence,
and beget the mo&s;t inveterate animo&s;ities, their
con&s;equences are commonly very fatal both to the public,
and to tho&s;e who make trial of them. The regent,
however, took advantage of the present calm which
prevailed; and being invited by the French king, who
was, at that time, willing to gratify Henry, he went
over into France; and was detained there during five
years. A great part of his authority he entru&s;ted into
the hands of Darcy, a Frenchman, whom he created
warden, of the marches, and who was extremely vigilant
in the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, and the puni&s;hment of
crimes and oppre&s;&s;ion. But Sir David Hume, a kin&s;man
of the nobleman lately executed, de&s;irous of revenging
his friend's death on the friend of the regent, way-laid
Darcy near Dun&s;e; and after reproaching him with that
execution, made an attack upon him. Darcy finding
<PB N="9" REF="17">
him&s;elf too weak to re&s;i&s;t, and tru&s;ting to the &s;wiftne&s;s of his
hor&s;e, fled towards Dunbar; but being ignorant of the
roads, he ran into a bog, was overtaken by the pur&s;uers,
and put to death. As he wore long flowing hair, Hume,
exulting in this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination as a gallant exploit, cut out
the&s;e locks, and plaiting them into a wreath, wore them

among the great families, that that kingdom was, for a

and a&s;&s;i&s;ting its friends. We have carried on the

as that country had little connexion with the general
&s;y&s;tem of Europe, we might be the le&s;s interrupted in the
narration of tho&s;e memorable events, which were tran&s;|acted
in the other kingdoms.</P>
<P>IT was fore&s;een, that a young, active prince, like
Francis, and of &s;o martial a di&s;po&s;ition, would &s;oon em|ploy
the great preparations, which his predece&s;&s;or, before
his death, had made for the conque&s;t of Milan. He
had been ob&s;erved even to weep at the recital of the mili|tary
exploits of Gallon de Foix; and the&s;e tears of
emulation were held to be &s;ure progno&s;tics of his future
valour. He renewed the treaty which Lewis had made
with Henry; and haying left every thing, as he thought,
&s;ecure behind him, he marched his armies towards the
&s;outh of France; pretending, that his &s;ole purpo&s;e was
to &s;ecure his kingdom again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Swi&s;s.
That formidable people &s;till retained their animo&s;ity
again&s;t France; and having taken Maximilian, duke of
Milan, under their protection, and indeed reduced him
to ab&s;olute dependance, they were determined, from
views both of honour and of intere&s;t, to defend him
<PB N="10" REF="18">
again&s;t this invader<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellai, lib. 1. Guic$iardini, lib. 12.</NOTE>. They fortified them&s;elves with
numerous forces in all tho&s;e vallies of the Alps, thro'
which, they thought, the French mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s;

pa&s;&s;age, they were not di&s;mayed, but de&s;cended into the
plain, tho' unprovided of cavalry, and oppo&s;ed them&s;elves
to the progre&s;s of the French arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th Sep|tember.</NOTE> At Marignan near
Milan, they fought with Francis one of the mo&s;t furious
and be&s;t conte&s;ted battles, which is to be met with in the
hi&s;toiry of the&s;e latter ages; and it required all the heroic
valour of that prince to in&s;pire his troops with courage
&s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t the de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault of tho&s;e moun|taineers.
After a bloody action in the evening, night
and darkne&s;s parted the combatants; but next morning,
the Swi&s;s renewed the attack with equal alacrity; and
it was not till they had loft all their brave&s;t troops that
they could be prevailed with to retire. The field was
&s;trowed with twenty thou&s;and &s;lain of both &s;ides; and
the mare&s;chal Trivulzio, who had been pre&s;ent at eigh|teen
pitched battles, declared that every engagement,
which he had yet &s;een, was only the play of children,
but that the action of Marignan was a combat of
heroes<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toire de la Ligue dc Cambray.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this great victory, the conque&s;t of the Milaneze
was ea&s;y and open. Francis, &s;en&s;ible how important the
alliance of the cantons was, even in their lowe&s;t fortune,
gave them all the conditions which they could have de|manded,
had they been ever &s;o &s;ucee&s;sful; and he courted
their friend&s;hip by every po&s;&s;ible conde&s;cen&s;ion. The
Venetians were in alliance with France; and as they
tru&s;ted entirely to the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of that crown for the
final recovery of their dominions on the continent, they
<PB N="11" REF="19">
&s;econded Francis in every enterprize. Pope Leo, who&s;e
&s;ole fault was too great fine&s;&s;e and artifice, a fault,
which, both as a prie&s;t and an Italian, it was difficult;
for him to avoid, had hitherto temporized between the
parties; and Francis's victory at Marignan determined
him ab&s;olutely to embrace the friend&s;hip of that monarch<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 12. Paullus Jovius.</NOTE>.
But what both facilitated mo&s;t, and &s;ecured the conque&s;t
of the Milaneze, was the re&s;olution of Maximilian
Sforza him&s;elf, who, tired of the vici&s;&s;itudes of his for|tune,
di&s;gu&s;ted with the tyranny of the Swi&s;s, and de|&s;irous
of privacy and repo&s;e, put him&s;elf into Francis's
hands; and having &s;tipulated a yearly pen&s;ion of thirty
thou&s;and ducats, re&s;igned all preten&s;ions to that dutchy,
and retired into France.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s and glory of the French monarch began<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealou&s;y of Henry.</NOTE>
to excite jealou&s;y in Henry; and his rapid progre&s;s, tho'
in &s;o di&s;tant a country, was not regarded without appre|hen&s;ions
by the Engli&s;h mini&s;try. Italy was during
that age the &s;eat of religion, of literature, and of com|merce;
and as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed alone that lu&s;tre, which has
&s;ince been &s;hared among other nations, it fixed the atten|tion
of all Europe, and every acqui&s;ition which was
made there, appeared more important than its weight in
the ballance of power &s;hould, &s;trictly &s;peaking, have
made it be e&s;teemed. Henry al&s;o thought, that he had
rea&s;on to complain of Francis for &s;ending the duke of Al|bany
into Scotland, and undermining the power and
credit of his &s;i&s;ter, the queen dowager<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, vol. iii. p. 31.</NOTE>. The repairing
the fortifications of Tero&uuml;enne was al&s;o regarded as a
breach of treaty. But above all, what tended to alienate
the court of England, was the di&s;gu&s;t which Wol&s;ey had
taken again&s;t the French monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="20">
HENRY, on the conque&s;t of Tournay, had refu&s;ed to
admit Lewis Gaillart, the bi&s;hop elect, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the temporalities, becau&s;e that prelate declined taking
the oath of allegiance to his new &s;overeign; and Wol|&s;ey
was appointed, in his room, admini&s;trator of the
bi&s;hopric. As the cardinal wi&s;hed to obtain free and
undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he applied to Francis, and de&s;ired
him to be&s;tow on Gaillart &s;ome &s;ee of equal value in
France, and to obtain his re&s;ignation of Tournay.
Francis, who &s;till hoped to recover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that city,
and who feared that the full &s;ettlement of Wol&s;ey in the
bi&s;hopric would prove an ob&s;tacle to his purpo&s;e, had
hitherto neglected to gratify the haughty prelate; and
the bi&s;hop of Tournay, by applying to the court of
Rome, had obtained a bull for his &s;ettlement in that &s;ee.
Wol&s;ey, who expected to be complied with, in every
reque&s;t, and who exacted re&s;pect even from the greate&s;t
monarchs, re&s;ented the &s;light put upon him by Francis;
and he pu&s;hed his ma&s;ter to &s;eek an occa&s;ion for wreaking
his vengeance again&s;t that monarch<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MAXIMILIAN the emperor was ready to embrace
every propo&s;al of a new enterprize, e&s;pecially if attended
with an offer of money, of which he was extremely
greedy, extremely prodigal, and extremely nece&s;&s;itous.
Richard Pace, formerly &s;ecretary to cardinal Bambrige,
now &s;ecretary of &s;tate, was di&s;patched to the court of
Vienna, and had a commi&s;&s;ion to propo&s;e &s;ome con&s;i|derable
payments to Maximilian<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, epi&s;t. 568.</NOTE>: He thence made a
journey into Switzerland; and by like motives engaged
&s;ome of the cantons to furni&s;h troops to the emperor.
That prince invaded Italy with a con&s;iderable army;
but being repul&s;ed from before Milan, he retreated with
his army into Germany, made peace with France and
<PB N="13" REF="21">
Venice, delivered Verona to that republic for a &s;um of
money, and thus excluded him&s;elf, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
from all future acce&s;s into Italy. And Henry found,
that, after expending five or &s;ix hundred thou&s;and ducats,
in order to gratify the cardinal's re&s;entment, he had only
loo&s;ened his alliance with Francis, without dimini&s;hing
the power of that prince.</P>
<P>THERE were many rea&s;ons, which engaged the King
not to proceed farther at pre&s;ent in his enmity again&s;t
France. He could hope for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from no power in
Europe. Ferdinand, his father in law, who had often,
deceived him, was now declining fa&s;t thro' age and in|firmities;
and a &s;peedy end was looked for to the long
and pro&s;perous reign of that great monarch. Charles,
prince of Spain, &s;overeign of the Low Countries, de&s;ired
nothing but peace with Francis, who had it &s;o much in
his power, if provoked, to ob&s;truct his peaceable acce&s;|&s;ion
to that rich inheritance, which was waiting him.
The pope was overawed by the power of France, and
Venice was engaged in a clo&s;e alliance with that mo|narchy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 12.</NOTE>.
Henry therefore remained in tranquility
during &s;ome time; and &s;eemed to give him&s;elf no con|cern
with regard to the affairs of the continent. In
vain did Maximilian endeavour to allure him into &s;ome
expence, by offering to make a re&s;ignation of the im|perial
crown in his favour. That artifice was too gro&s;s
to &s;ucceed even with a prince &s;o little politic as Henry;
and Pace, his envoy, who was perfectly well acquainted
with the emperor's motives and character, gave him
warning, that the &s;ole view of that prince, in making
him &s;o liberal an offer, was to draw money from him.</P>
<P>WHILE an univer&s;al peace prevailed in Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1516.</NOTE> that
event happened, which had &s;o long been looked for, and
from which &s;uch important con&s;equences were expected,
<PB N="14" REF="22">
the death of Ferdinand the Catholic, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of his grand&s;on, Charles, to his exten&s;ive dominions.
No commotion, however, or alteration followed imme|diately
upon that great incident.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Jan.</NOTE> This young prince,
who had not yet reached his &s;ixteenth year, was already
a great &s;tate&s;man, from the excellent education which
he had received, and from the mature and &s;olid judgment,
with which nature had endowed him. He was &s;en&s;ible
how important it was to pre&s;erve peace with foreigners,
till he &s;hould have e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority in his
new dominions; and finding Francis de&s;irous to take advan|tage
of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, he made him an offer of
&s;uch terms as gained the friend&s;hip and alliance of that
monarch. He engaged to marry Francis's daughter,
tho' only an infant of a year old; to receive as her
dowry all her father's preten&s;ions on the kingdom of Na|ples;
to pay him a hundred thou&s;and crowns a year, till
the con&s;ummation of the marriage; and to give the King
of Navarre &s;ati&s;faction with regard to his dominions<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Recueil de Trait&eacute;s par Leonard, tom. ii.</NOTE>.
Charles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1517.</NOTE> having fini&s;hed this treaty at Noyon by his
mini&s;ters, and having thus left every thing in &s;ecurity in
the Low-Countries, departed for Spain, and was wil|lingly
received to the government of the&s;e united king|doms.
the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion lay in his mother, Joan,
who was &s;till alive; but as &s;he was u&s;ually di&s;ordered in
her judgment, Ferdinand had left the admini&s;tration to
his grand&s;on, Charles; and the &s;tates, both of Ca&s;tile
and Arragon, gave their con&s;ent to this de&s;tination.</P>
<P>THE more Charles advanced in power and authority,
the more was Francis &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity he lay
under of gaining the confidence and friendship of Henry;
and he took at la&s;t the only method by which he could
obtain &s;ucce&s;s, the paying court, by pre&s;ents and flattery,
to the haughty cardinal.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23">
BONNIVET, admiral of France, was di&s;patched to
London, and he was directed to employ all his in&s;inuation
and addre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1518.</NOTE> qualities for which he was remarkable, to
procure him&s;elf a place in Wol&s;ey's good graces. After
the amba&s;&s;ador had &s;ucceeded in his purpo&s;e, he took an
opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his ma&s;ter's regret, that, by
mi&s;takes and mi&s;apprehen&s;ions, he had been &s;o unfortu|nate
as to lo&s;e a friend&s;hip, which he &s;o much valued
as that of his eminence. Wol&s;ey was not deaf to the&s;e
honourable advances from &s;o great a monarch; and he
was thenceforth ob&s;erved to expre&s;s him&s;elf, on all occa|&s;ions,
in favour of the French alliance. The more to
engage him in his intere&s;ts, Francis entered into &s;uch
confidence with him, that he a&s;ked his advice even in
his mo&s;t &s;ecret affairs, and in all difficult emergencies
had recour&s;e to him as to an oracle of wi&s;dom and pro|found
policy. The cardinal made no &s;ecret to the King
of this private corre&s;pondence; and Henry was &s;o pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in favour of the great capacity of his mini&s;ter,
that, he &s;aid, he verily believed he would govern Francis
as well as him&s;elf<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN matters &s;eemed &s;ufficiently prepared, Bonnivet
opened to the cardinal his matter's de&s;ire of recovering
Tournay; and Wol&s;ey immediately, without he&s;itation,
engaged to effectuate his purpo&s;e. He took an oppor|tunity
of repre&s;enting to the King and council, that
Tournay lay &s;o remote from Calais, that it would be
very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, in ca&s;e of a war, to keep
the communication open between the&s;e two places:
That as it was &s;ituate on the frontiers both of France and
the Netherlands, it was expo&s;ed to the attacks of both
the&s;e powers, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, either by force or
famine, fall into the hands of the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ailant: That
even in time of peace, it could not be pre&s;erved without
<PB N="16" REF="24">
a large garri&s;on, to re&s;train the numerous and mutinous
inhabitants, ever di&s;contented with the Engli&s;h govern|ment:
And that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tournay, as it was
thus precarious and expensive, &s;o was it entirely u&s;ele&s;s,
and gave little or no means to annoy, on occa&s;ion, the
dominions either of Charles or of Francis.</P>
<P>THESE rea&s;ons were of them&s;elves very convincing,
and were &s;ure of meeting with no oppo&s;ition, when
they came from the mouth of the cardinal. A
treaty therefore was entered into for the delivering up<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tournay delivered to France.</NOTE>
of Tournay; and in order to give to that mea&s;ure a more
graceful appearance, it was agreed, that the Dauphin
and the prince&s;s Mary, both of them infants, &s;hould be
betrothed, and that this city &s;hould be con&s;idered as the
dowry of the prince&s;s. Such kinds of agreement were
then common among Sovereigns, tho' it was very rare,
that the intere&s;ts and views of the parties continued &s;o
&s;teady as to render the intended marriages effectual.
But as Henry had been at con&s;iderable expence in build|ing
a citadel at Tournay, Francis agreed to pay him
600,000 crowns at twelve yearly payments, and to put
into his hands eight ho&s;tages, all of them men of quality,
for the performance of the article<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, liv. I.</NOTE>. And le&s;t the cardi|nal
&s;hould think him&s;elf neglected in the&s;e &s;tipulations,
he promi&s;ed him a yearly pen&s;ion of twelve thou&s;and
livres, as an equivalent for his admini&s;tration of the bi|&s;hopric
of Tournay. He al&s;o engaged to recall Albany
from Scotland.</P>
<P>FRANCIS having &s;ucceeded &s;o well in this negotiation,
began to enlarge his views, and to hope for more con|&s;iderable
advantages, by practi&s;ing on the vanity and
&s;elf conceit of this haughty favourite. He redoubled his
flatteries to the cardinal, con&s;ulted him more frequently
in every doubt or difficulty, called him in each letter,
<PB N="17" REF="25">
<HI>father, tutor, governor,</HI> and profe&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t unbounded
deference to his advice and opinion. All tho&s;e care&s;&s;es
were preparatives to a negotiation for the delivery of
Calais, in con&s;ideration of a &s;um of money to be paid for
it; and if we may credit Polydore Virgil, who bears a
particular &s;pite to Wol&s;ey, on account of his being di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of his employment and thrown into pri&s;on by
that mini&s;ter, &s;o extravagant a proposal met with a very
favourable reception from the cardinal. He ventured not,
however, to lay the matter before the council: He was
contented to &s;ound privately the opinions of men, by
dropping hints in conver&s;ation, as if he thought Calais a
u&s;ele&s;s burthen to the kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>: But when he found,
that all men were &s;trongly riveted in a contrary per&s;ua|&s;ion,
he thought it dangerous to proceed any farther in
his purpo&s;e; and falling, &s;oon after, into new attach|ments
with the King of Spain, the great friend&s;hip be|tween
Francis and him began gradually to decline.</P>
<P>THE enormous pride of Wol&s;ey was now farther en|crea&s;ed
by a great acce&s;&s;ion of dignity and power which
he had received.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wol&s;ey ap|pointed le|gate.</NOTE> Cardinal Campeggio had been &s;ent as
legate into England, in order to procure a tythe from the
clergy, for enabling the pope to oppo&s;e the progre&s;e of
the Turks; a danger which was real, and was formida|ble
to all Chri&s;tendom, but which had been &s;o often
made u&s;e of to &s;erve the intere&s;ted purpo&s;es of
the court of Rome, that it had lo&s;t all influence on the minds of
the people. The Clergy refu&s;ed to comply with Leo's
demands: Campeggio was recalled; and the King de|&s;ired
of the pope, that Wol&s;ey, who had been joined in
this commi&s;&s;ion, might alone be inve&s;ted with the lega|tine
power, together with the right of vi&s;iting all the
clergy and mona&s;teries, and even with &s;u&s;pending all the
<PB N="18" REF="26">
laws of the church during a twelve-month. Wol&s;ey,
having obtained this new dignity, made a new di&s;play of
that &s;tate and parade, to which he was &s;o much addicted.
On &s;olemn fea&s;t-days, he was not contented without
&s;aying ma&s;s after the manner of the pope him&s;elf: Not
only he had bi&s;hops and abbots to &s;erve him; he even
engaged the fir&s;t nobility to give him water and the
towel. He affected a rank &s;uperior to what had ever
been claimed by any churchman in England. Warham,
the primate, having wrote him a letter, where he &s;ub|&s;cribbed
him&s;elf, <HI>your loving brother,</HI> Wol&s;ey complained
of his pre&s;umption, in thus challenging an equality with
him. When Warham was told what offence he had
given, he made light of the matter. &startq;Know ye not,&endq;
he &s;aid, &startq;that this man is drunk with too much pro&s;|perity.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT Wol&s;ey carried the matter much farther than vain
pomp and o&s;tentation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His manner of exerci&s;|ing that of|fice.</NOTE> He erected an office, which he
called the legatine court; and as he was now, by means
of the pope's commi&s;&s;ion and the King's favour, inve&s;ted
with all power, both eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil, no man
knew what bounds were to be &s;et to the authority of this
new tribunal. He conferred on it a kind of inqui&s;itorial
and cen&s;orial powers even over the laiety, and directed it
to examine into all matters of con&s;eience; into all con|duct
which had given &s;candal; into all actions, which,
though they e&s;caped the law, might appear contrary to
good morals. Offence was ju&s;tly taken at this commi&s;|&s;ion,
which was really unbounded; and the people were
the more di&s;gu&s;ted, when they &s;aw a man, who indulged
him&s;elf in the licen&s;es of plea&s;ure, &s;o &s;evere in repre&s;&s;ing
the lea&s;t appearance of immorality in others. But to
render his court more obnoxious, Wol&s;ey made one John
Allen the judge in it, a per&s;on of &s;candalous life<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memorials, vol. i. p. 125.</NOTE>, whom
<PB N="19" REF="27">
he him&s;elf, as chancellor, had condemned for perjury:
And as this man either exacted fines from every one whom
he was plea&s;ed to find guilty, or took bribes to drop pro|&s;ecutions,
men concluded, and with &s;ame appearance of
rea&s;on, that he &s;hared with the cardinal the&s;e wages of
iniquity. The clergy, and in particular the monks,
were expo&s;ed to this tyranny; and as the libertini&s;m of
their lives often gave a ju&s;t handle again&s;t them, they
were obliged to buy an indemnity, by paying large &s;ums
of money to the legate ox his judge. Not contented
with this authority, Wol&s;ey pretended, by virtue of his
commi&s;ion, to a&s;&s;ume the power of all the bi&s;hops courts;
particularly that of judging of Wills and Te&s;taments;
and his deci&s;ions in the&s;e important points were deemed
not a little arbitrary. As if he him&s;elf were pope, and
as if the pope could di&s;po&s;e ab&s;olutely of every eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
e&s;tabli&s;hment, he pre&s;ented to whatever priories or
benefices he plea&s;ed, without regard to the right of elec|tion
in the monks, or of patronage in the nobility and
gentry<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.

<P>No one dur&s;t carry to the King any complaint again&s;t

among chri&s;tian princes, it put all men's &s;pirits into agi|tation,
and proved a kind of aera in the general &s;y&s;tem of
Europe. The Kings of France and Spain immediately
declared them&s;elves candidates for the imperial throne;
and employed every expedient of money or intrigue,
which promi&s;ed them &s;ucce&s;s in &s;o great a point of ambi|tion.
Henry al&s;o was encouraged to put in his preten|&s;ions;
but his mini&s;ter, Pace, who was di&s;patched to the
electors, found that he began to &s;olicit too late, and that
the votes of all the&s;e princes were already pre-engaged
either on the one fide or the other.</P>
<P>FRANCIS and Charles made profe&s;&s;ion from the be|ginning
of carrying on this rival&s;hip with emulation, but
without enmity; and Francis in particular declared, that
his brother Charles and he were, fairly and openly,
&s;uitors to the &s;ame mi&s;tre&s;s: The more fortunate, added
he, will carry her; and the other mu&s;t re&s;t contented<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Belcario, lib. 16. Guicciardin, lib. 13.</NOTE>.
<PB N="21" REF="29">
But all men apprehended, that this extreme moderation,
however rea&s;onable, would not be of long duration; and
that incidents would certainly occur to &s;harpen the minds
of the candidates again&s;t each other. It was Charles
who at la&s;t prevailed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charles, King of Spain, cho&s;en em|peror.</NOTE> to the great di&s;appointment of the
French monarch, who &s;till continued to the la&s;t in the
belief, that the majority of the electoral college was en|gaged
in his favour. And as he was &s;ome years &s;uperior
in age to his rival, and, after his victory at Marignan,
and conque&s;t of the Milane&s;e, much &s;uperior in renown,
he could not &s;uppre&s;s his indignation, at being thus, in
the face of all mankind, after long and anxious expecta|tion,
po&s;t-poned in &s;o important a preten&s;ion. From
this competition, as much as from oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t,
aro&s;e that emulation between tho&s;e two great monarchs,
which, while it kept their whole age in agitation, &s;ets
them in &s;o remarkable a contra&s;t to each other: Both of
them princes endowed with talents and abilities; brave,
a&s;piring, active, indu&s;trious; beloved by their &s;ervants
and &s;ubjects, dreaded by their enemies, and re&s;pected by
all the world: Francis, open, frank, liberal, munificent,
carrying the&s;e virtues to an exce&s;s which prejudiced his
affairs: Charles, political, clo&s;e, artificial, frugal; bet|ter
calculated to obtain &s;ucce&s;s in wars and in negotia|tions,
e&s;pecially the latter. The one, the more amiable
man; the other, the greater monarch. The King, from
his over&s;ights and indi&s;cretions, naturally expo&s;ed to mi&s;|fortunes;
but qualified, by his &s;pirit and magnanimity,
to extricate him&s;elf from them with honour: The empe|ror,
by his de&s;igning, intere&s;ted character, fitted, in his
greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, to excite jealou&s;y and oppo&s;ition even
among his allies, and to rouze up a multitude of ene|mies,
in the place of one whom he had &s;ubdued. And
as the per&s;onal qualities of the&s;e princes thus counter|poi&s;ed
each other, &s;o did the advantages and di&s;advantages
<PB N="22" REF="30">
of their dominions. Fortune alone, without the con|currence
of prudence or valour, never reared up of a
&s;udden &s;o great a power as that which centered in the
emperor Charles. He reaped the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Ca&s;tile,
of Arragon, of Au&s;tria, of Burgundy: He inherited the
conque&s;t of Naples, of Granada: Election entitled him
to the empire: Even the bounds of the globe &s;eemed to
be enlarged a little before his time, that he might po&s;&s;e&s;s the
whole trea&s;ure, as yet entire and unrifled, of the new
world. But tho' the concurrence of all the&s;e advantages
formed an empire greater and more exten&s;ive than any
known in Europe &s;ince that of the Romans, the king|dom
of France alone, being clo&s;e, compact, united,
rich, populous, and being interpo&s;ed between all the
provinces of Charles's dominions, was able to make a
vigorous oppo&s;ition to his progre&s;s, and maintain the
conte&s;t again&s;t him.</P>
<P>HENRY po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that felicity, of being able, both by
the native force of his kingdom and its &s;ituation, to hold
the balance between tho&s;e two powers; and had he
known to improve, by policy and prudence, this &s;ingular
and ine&s;timable advantage, he was really, by means of
it, a greater prince than either of tho&s;e mighty mo|narchs,
who &s;eemed to &s;trive for the dominion of Eu|rope.
But the character of this King was heedle&s;s, in|con&s;iderate,
capricious, impolitic; guided by his pa&s;&s;ion
or his favourite; vain, imperious, haughty; &s;ometimes
actuated by friend&s;hip for foreign powers, oftener by re|&s;entment,
&s;eldom by his true intere&s;t. And thus, tho'
he triumphed in that &s;uperiority which his &s;ituation in
Europe gave him, he never employed it to his own e&s;&s;en|tial
and durable advantage, or to that of his kingdom.</P>
<P>FRANCIS was well acquainted with Henry's character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1520.</NOTE>
and endeavoured to accommodate his conduct to it. He
&s;olicited an interview near Calais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interview between Henry</NOTE> in expectation of being
<PB N="23" REF="31">
able, by familiar conver&s;ation, to gain upon his friend|&s;hip
and confidence. Wol&s;ey earne&s;tly &s;econded this
propo&s;al; and hoped, in the pre&s;ence of both courts, to
make parade of his riches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Francis at Calais.</NOTE> his &s;plendour, and his in|fluence
over both monarchs<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. And as Henry him&s;elf
loved pomp and magnificence, and had entertained a
curio&s;ity of being per&s;onally acquainted with the French
King, he very chearfully adju&s;ted all the preliminaries of
this interview. The nobility of both nations &s;trove to
&s;urpa&s;s each other in pomp and expence; Many of them
involved them&s;elves in large debts, and were not able, by
the penury of their whole lives, to repair the vain &s;plen|dour
of a few days. The duke of Buckingham, who,
tho' immen&s;ely rich, was &s;omewhat addicted to frugality,
finding the preparations for this fe&s;tival amount to im|men&s;e
&s;ums, threw out &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;plea&s;ure
again&s;t the cardinal, whom he believed the author of
that mea&s;ure<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. Herbert. Holling&s;hed, p. 855.</NOTE>. An imprudence which proved afterwards
the &s;ource of great misfortunes to that nobleman.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry was preparing to depart for Calais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The emper|or Charles arrives in England. 25th of May.</NOTE>
he was &s;urprized to hear that the emperor was
arrived at Dover; and he immediately ha&s;tened thi|ther
with the queen, in order to give a &s;uitable re|ception
to his royal gue&s;t. That great prince, po|litic
tho' young, having heard of the intended inter|view
between Francis and Henry, was apprehen&s;ive
of the con&s;equences, and was re&s;olved to take the oppor|tunity,
in his pa&s;&s;age from Spain to the Low Countries,
to make the King &s;till a higher compliment, by paying
him a vi&s;it in his own dominions. Be&s;ides the marks of
regard and attachment which he gave to Henry, he
&s;trove, by every te&s;timony of friend&s;hip, by flatteries,
prote&s;tations, promi&s;es and pre&s;ents, to gain on the va|nity,
the avarice, and the ambition of the cardinal. He
<PB N="24" REF="32">
here in&s;tilled into this a&s;piring prelate the hope of attain|ing
the papacy; and as that was the &s;ole point of eleva|tion,
beyond his pre&s;ent greatne&s;s, it was &s;ure to attract
his wi&s;hes with the &s;ame ardour, as if fortune had never,
as yet, favoured him with any of her pre&s;ents. In hopes
of reaching this dignity by the emperor's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he
&s;ecretly devoted him&s;elf to that monarch's intere&s;ts;
and Charles was perhaps the more liberal of his promi&s;es,
becau&s;e Leo was a very young man; and it was not
likely, that, for many years, he would be called upon to
fulfil his engagements. Henry ea&s;ily ob&s;erved this court|&s;hip
payed to his mini&s;ter; but in&s;tead of taking umbrage
at it, he only made it a &s;ubjects of vanity; and believed,
that, as Wol&s;ey's &s;ole &s;upport was his favour, the obei|&s;ance
of &s;uch mighty monarchs to his &s;ervant, was in
reality a more con&s;picuous homage to his own grandeur.</P>
<P>THE day of Charles's departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of May.</NOTE> Henry went over to
Calais with the queen and his whole court; and from
thence proceeded to Gui&s;nes, a &s;mall town near the
frontiers. Francis, attended in like manner, came to
Ardres, a few miles di&s;tant; and the two monarchs met,
for the fir&s;t time, in the fields, at a place &s;ituate between
the&s;e two towns, but &s;till within the Engli&s;h pale: For
Francis agreed to pay that compliment to Henry, in
con&s;ideration of that prince's pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ea, that he
might be pre&s;ent at the interview. Wol&s;ey, to whom
both Kings had entru&s;ted the regulation of the ceremo|nial,
contrived this circum&s;tance, in order to do honou$
to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE two monarchs, after &s;aluting each other in the
mo&s;t cordial manner, retired into a tent which had been
erected on purpo&s;e, and they held a &s;ecret conference
together. Henry here propo&s;ed to make &s;ome amend|ments
on the articles of their former alliance; and
he began to read the treaty, <HI>I Henry King:</HI> The&s;e were
<PB N="25" REF="33">
the fir&s;t words; and he &s;topt a moment. He &s;ubjoined only
the words, <HI>of England,</HI> without adding, <HI>France,</HI> the u&s;ual
&s;tyle of the Engli&s;h monarchs<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. Francis remarked this
delicacy, and expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;mile his approbation of
it.</P>
<P>HE took an opportunity &s;oon after of paying a com|pliment
to Henry of a more e&s;&s;ential nature. That
generous prince, full of honour him&s;elf, and incapable
of di&s;tru&s;ting others, was &s;hocked at all the precautions
which were ob&s;erved, whenever he had an interview
with the Engli&s;h monarch: The number of their guards
and attendants was carefully counted on both &s;ides:
Every &s;tep was &s;crupulou&s;ly mea&s;ured and adju&s;ted: And
if the two Kings propo&s;ed to pay a vi&s;it to the queens,
they departed from their &s;everal quarters at the &s;ame
in&s;tant, which was marked by the firing of a culverin;
they pa&s;&s;ed each other in the middle point between the
places; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant that Henry entered Ar|dres,
Francis put him&s;elf into the hands of the Engli&s;h
at Gui&s;nes. In order to break off this tedious ceromony,
which contained &s;o many di&s;honourable implications,
Francis, one day, took with him two gentlemen and a
page, and rode directly into Gui&s;nes. The guards were
&s;urprized at the pre&s;ence of the monarch, who called
aloud to them, <HI>You are all my pri&s;oners: Carry me to your
ma&s;ter.</HI> Henry was equally a&s;toni&s;hed at the appearance
of Francis; and taking him in his arms, &startq;My brother,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;you have here played me the mo&s;t agreeable
trick in the world, and have &s;howed me the full
confidence I may place in you: I &s;urrender my&s;elf
your pri&s;oner from this moment.&endq; He took from his
neck a collar of pearls, worth 15000 angels<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">An angel was then e&s;timated at &s;even &s;hillings, or near twelve of our pre&s;ent money.</NOTE>; and put|ting
<PB N="26" REF="34">
it about Francis's, begged him to wear it, for the
&s;ake of his pri&s;oner. Francis agreed, but on condition
that Henry &s;hould wear a bracelet, of which he made
him a pre&s;ent, and which was double in value to the
collar<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. The King went next day to Ardres, without
guards or attendants; and confidence being now fully
e&s;tabli&s;hed between the monarchs, they employed the re&s;t
of the time entirely in tournaments and fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>A DEFIANCE had been &s;ent by the two Kings to each
others court, and thro' all the chief cities of Europe, im|porting,
that Henry and Francis, with fourteen aids,
would be ready in the plains of Picardy, to an&s;wer all
comers, that were gentlemen, at tilt, tourney, and bar|riers.
The monarchs, in order to fulfil this challenge,
advanced into the field on hor&s;eback, Francis &s;urrounded
with Henry's guards, and Henry with tho&s;e of Francis.
They were gorgiou&s;ly apparelled; and were both of
them the mo&s;t comely per&s;onages of their age, as well
as the mo&s;t expert in every military exerci&s;e. They
carried away the prize at all trials in tho&s;e rough and
dangerous pa&s;times; and &s;everal hor&s;es and riders were
overthrown by their vigour and dexterity. The ladies
were the judges in the&s;e feats of chivalry, and put an end
to the rencounter whenever they judged it expedient.
Henry erected a &s;pacious hou&s;e of wood and canvas,
which had been framed in London; and he here fea&s;ted
the French monarch. He had placed a motto on this
fabric, under the figure of an Engli&s;h archer embroidered
on it, <HI>Cui adhaereo praee&s;t; He prevails whom I favour</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Mezeray.</NOTE>:
Expre&s;&s;ing his own &s;ituation, as holding in his hands the
balance of power among the potentates of Europe.
In the&s;e entertainments, more than in any &s;erious bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
did the two Kings pa&s;s their time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th June.</NOTE> till their
departure.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="35">
HENRY, after his return to Calais, paid a vi&s;it to
the emperor and Margaret of Savoy at Gravelines, and
engaged them to go along with him to Calais, and pa&s;s
&s;ome days in that fortre&s;s. The artful and politic Charles
here compleated the impre&s;&s;ion, which he had begun to
make on Henry and his favourite, and effaced all the
friend&s;hip, to which the frank and liberal nature of
Francis had given birth. As the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria began
&s;en&s;ibly to take the a&s;cendant over the French monarchy,
the intere&s;ts of England required that &s;ome &s;upport &s;hould
be given to the latter, and above all, that any important
wars &s;hould be prevented, which might be&s;tow on either
of them a deci&s;ive &s;uperiority over the other. But the
jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h again&s;t France has ever prevented
a cordial union between the&s;e nations: And Charles,
&s;en&s;ible of this hereditary animo&s;ity, and de&s;irous farther
to flatter Henry's vanity, had made him an offer, (an
offer in which Francis was afterwards obliged to concur)
that he &s;hould be entire arbiter in any di&s;pute or difference
that &s;hould ari&s;e between the monarchs. But the
great ma&s;terpiece of Charles's politics was the &s;ecuring
Wol&s;ey in his intere&s;ts, by very important &s;ervices, and
&s;till higher promi&s;es. He renewed a&s;&s;urances of a&s;&s;i&s;ting
him in obtaining the papacy; and he put him in pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the revenues, belonging to the &s;ees of Bada|jox
and Palencia in Ca&s;tile. The acqui&s;itions of Wol&s;ey were
now become &s;o exorbitant, that, joined to the
pen&s;ions from foreign powers, which Henry allowed him
to po&s;&s;e&s;s, his revenues were computed nearly to equal
tho&s;e which belonged to the crown it&s;elf; and he &s;pent
them with a magnificence, or rather an o&s;tentation,
which gave general offence to the people; and much
le&s;&s;ened his ma&s;ter in the eyes of all foreign nations<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil. Hall.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="36">
THE violent per&s;onal emulation and political jealou&s;y
which had taken place between the emperor and the
French King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1521.</NOTE> &s;oon broke out in action. Francis &s;ent
an army into Navarre under the command of De Foix,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War between Charles and Francis.</NOTE>
in order to replace the family of Albert in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that kingdom; and this enterprize could not have
been complained of as a breach of treaty, if De Foix
had confined him&s;elf to that equitable de&s;ign. But after
he had &s;ubdued Navarre, finding Spain in great di&s;order
from the in&s;urrections of the people, he thought the
opportunity favourable, and he ventured, with Francis's
approbation, to lay &s;iege to Logrogno in Ca&s;tile. This
inva&s;ion, contrary to what was expected, put an end to
the dome&s;tic di&s;&s;entions of the Ca&s;tilians; who attacked
the French, obliged them to rai&s;e the &s;iege, pur&s;ued the
advantage, and entirely expelled them Navarre, which
has ever &s;ince remained united with the Spani&s;h mo|narchy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Vera, hi&s;t. de Charl. V.</NOTE>. Robert de la Marck, duke of Bo&uuml;illon and
prince of Sedan, having received &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t from the
governe&s;s of the Low Countries, had taken arms and
invaded tho&s;e provinces; and had even &s;ent a challenge
or defiance to the emperor him&s;elf<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Bellay, lib. 1.</NOTE>: A boldne&s;s, which
&s;eemed entirely unaccountable, except on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that this petty prince had received &s;ecret encouragement
from Francis. On the other hand, Charles, in order to
cha&s;ti&s;e the in&s;olence of Robert, had levied a powerful
army, and advanced to the frontiers of France, which
he threatened with an inva&s;ion. Ho&s;tilities were &s;oon
carried farther; his generals be&s;ieged Mou&s;on, which
they took; they inve&s;ted Mezieres, where they met
with a repul&s;e. In Italy likewi&s;e the two monarchs
were not inactive. Francis negotiated with the Pope, in
order to engage him to concur in expelling the Imperi|ali&s;ts
<PB N="29" REF="37">
from Naples: But Charles had the addre&s;s to fini&s;h
his league with the &s;ame power for expelling the French
from Milan; and the united arms of the allies had
invaded that dutchy, and had almo&s;t entirely fini&s;hed
their enterprize.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e ambitious and warlike princes were
committing ho&s;tilities on each other in every part of
Europe, they &s;till made profe&s;&s;ions of the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire
of peace; and both of them carried ince&s;&s;antly their
complaints to Henry, as to the umpire between them.
The King, who appeared neutral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mediation of Henry.</NOTE> engaged them to &s;end
their amba&s;&s;adors to Calais, there to negotiate a peace
under the mediation of Wol&s;ey and the pope's nuntio.
The emperor was well acquainted with the partiality of
the&s;e mediators; and his demands in the conference
were &s;o unrea&s;onable, as plainly proved him con&s;cious of
this advantage. He required the re&s;titution of Burgundy,
a province, which many years before had been ceded to
France by treaty, and which would have given him
acce&s;s into the mid&s;t of that kingdom: And he demanded
to be freed from the homage, which his ance&s;tors had
ever paid for Flanders and Artois, and which he him&s;elf
had, by the treaty of Noyon, promi&s;ed to renew. On
Francis's rejecting the&s;e terms, the congre&s;s at Calais
broke up, and Wol&s;ey, &s;oon after, took a journey to
Bruges, where he met with the emperor. He was re|ceived
of with the &s;ame &s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of November.</NOTE> magnificence, and re&s;pect, as
if he had been the King of England him&s;elf; and he
concluded in his ma&s;ter's name an offen&s;ive alliance with
the pope and the emperor again&s;t France. He engaged
that England &s;hould next &s;ummer invade that kingdom
with forty thou&s;and men; and he betrothed to Charles
the prince&s;s Mary, the King's only child, who had now
&s;ome pro&s;pect of inheriting the crown. This extravagant
<PB N="30" REF="38">
alliance, which was prejudicial to the intere&s;ts, and
might have proved fatal to the liberty and indepen|dence
of the kingdom, was the re&s;ult of the humours
and prejudices of the King, and the private views and
expectations of the cardinal.</P>
<P>THE people &s;aw every day new in&s;tances of the un|controuled
authority of this mini&s;ter. The duke of
Buckingham, con&s;table of England, the fir&s;t nobleman
both for family and fortune in the kingdom, had been &s;o
unfortunate as to give di&s;gu&s;t to the cardinal, and it was
not long before he found rea&s;on to repent his indi&s;cretion.
He &s;eems to have been a man full of levity and ra&s;h pro|jects;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and condemna|tion of the duke of Bucking|ham.</NOTE>
and being infatuated with judicial a&s;trology, he
entertained commerce with one Hopkins, a carthu&s;ian
monk, who encouraged him in the notion of his mount|ing
one day the throne of England. He was de&s;cended
by a female from the duke of Gloce&s;ter, younge&s;t &s;on of
Edward the third; and tho' his claim to the crown was
thereby very remote, he had been &s;o imprudent as to let
fall &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, as if he thought him&s;elf be&s;t in|titled,
in ca&s;e the King &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
the royal dignity. He had not even ab&s;tained from
threats again&s;t the King's life, and had provided him&s;elf
of arms, which he intended to employ, in ca&s;e a favour|able
opportunity &s;hould offer. He was brought to a
trial; and the duke of Norfolk, who&s;e &s;on, the earl of
Surrey, had married Buckingham's daughter, was created
lord &s;teward, in order to precide at this &s;olemn proce|dure.
The jury con&s;i&s;ted of a duke, a marquis, &s;even
earls, and twelve barons; and they gave their verdict
again&s;t Buckingham, which was &s;oon after put in exe|cution.
There is no rea&s;on to think the &s;entence unju&s;t<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Herber: Hall. Stowe, 513. Holling&s;hed, p. 862.</NOTE>;
but as Buckingham's crime &s;eemed to proceed more
from indi&s;cretion than deliberate malice, the people, who
<PB N="31" REF="39">
loved that nobleman, expected that the King would grant
him a pardon, and a&s;cribed their di&s;appointment to the
malice and revenge of the cardinal. The King's own
jealou&s;y, however, again&s;t all pretenders to the crown,
was, notwith&s;tanding his undoubted title, very remark|able
during the whole cour&s;e of his reign; and was
alone &s;ufficient to render him implacable again&s;t Buck|ingham.
The office of con&s;table, which Buckingham
inherited from the Bohuns, earls of Hereford, was
forfeited, and was never after revived by Henry.</P>

<P>DURING &s;ome years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIX.</NOTE> many parts of Europe had
been agitated with tho&s;e religious controver&s;ies,
which produced the reformation, one of the greate&s;t:
events in hi&s;tory: But as it was not till this time, that
the King of England publickly took part in the quarrel,
we had no occa&s;ion to give any account of its ri&s;e and
progre&s;s. It will now be nece&s;&s;ary to explain the&s;e theo|logical
di&s;putes; or what is more material, to trace from
their origin tho&s;e abu&s;es, which &s;o generally diffu&s;ed the
opinion, that a reformation of the church or eccle&s;ia&s;tical
order was become highly expedient, if not ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary. We &s;hall be better enabled to comprehend
the &s;ubject, if we take the matter a little higher, and
reflect a moment on the rea&s;ons, why there mu&s;t be an
eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, and a public e&s;tabli&s;hment of reli|gion
in every civilized community. The importance of
the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion will, I hope, excu&s;e this &s;hort
digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="41">
MOST of the arts and profe&s;&s;ions in a &s;tate are of &s;uch
a nature, that, while they promote the intere&s;ts of the
&s;ociety, they are al&s;o u&s;eful or agreeable to &s;ome indivi|duals;
and in that ca&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Digre&s;&s;ion concerning the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical &s;tate.</NOTE>. the con&s;tant rule of the magi|&s;trate,
except, perhaps, on the fir&s;t introduction of any
art, is, to leave the profe&s;&s;ion to it&s;elf, and tru&s;t its en|couragement
to the individuals who reap the benefit of
it. The artizans, finding their profits to ri&s;e by the
favour of their cu&s;tomers, encrea&s;e, as much as po&s;&s;ible,
their &s;kill and indu&s;try; and as matters are not di&s;turbed
by any injudicious tampering, the commodity is al|ways
&s;ure to be at all times exactly proportioned to the
demand.</P>
<P>BUT there are al&s;o &s;ome callings, which, tho' u&s;eful
and even nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;tate, bring no advantage nor
plea&s;ure to any individuals; and the &s;upreme power is
obliged to alter its conduct with regard to the retainers of tho&s;e
profe&s;&s;ions. It mu&s;t give them public encourage|ment
in order to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and it mu&s;t provide
again&s;t that negligence, to which they will naturally be
&s;ubject, either by annexing particular honours to the
profe&s;&s;ion, by e&s;tabli&s;hing a long &s;ubordination of ranks
and a &s;trict dependance, or by &s;ome other expedient.
The per&s;ons employed in the finances, armies, fleets,
and magi&s;tracy are in&s;tances of this order of men.</P>
<P>IT may naturally be thought, at fir&s;t view, that
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics belong to the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and that their
encouragement, as well as that of lawyers and phy&s;icians,
may &s;afely be tru&s;ted to the liberality of individuals, who
are attached to their doctrines, and who find benefit or
con&s;olation from their &s;piritual mini&s;try and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
Their indu&s;try and vigilance will, no doubt, be whetted
by &s;uch an additional motive; and their &s;kill in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
as well as their addre&s;s in governing the minds
<PB N="34" REF="42">
of the people, mu&s;t receive daily encrea&s;e, from their
encrea&s;ing practice, &s;tudy, and attention.</P>
<P>BUT if we con&s;ider the matter more clo&s;ely, we &s;hall
find, that this intere&s;ted diligence of the clergy is what
every wi&s;e legi&s;lator will &s;tudy to prevent; becau&s;e in
every religion, except the true, it is highly pernicious,
and has even a natural tendency to pervert the true, by
infu&s;ing into it a &s;trong mixture of &s;uper&s;tition, folly,
and delu&s;ion. Each gho&s;tly practitioner, in order to
render him&s;elf more precious and &s;acred in the eyes of
his retainers, mu&s;t in&s;pire them with the mo&s;t violent
abhorrence again&s;t all other &s;ects, and continually endea|vour,
by &s;ome novelty, to excite the languid devotion of
his audience. No regard will be paid to truth, morals,
or decency in the doctrines inculcated. Every tenet
will be adopted, that be&s;t &s;uits the di&s;orderly affections
of the human frame. Cu&s;tomers will be drawn to each
conventicle by new indu&s;try and addre&s;s in practi&s;ing
on the pa&s;&s;ions and credulity of the populace. And in
the end, the civil magi&s;trate will find, that he has paid
dearly for his pretended frugality, in &s;aving a &s;ettled
foundation for the prie&s;ts; and that in reality the mo&s;t
decent and advantageous compo&s;ition, which he can make
with the &s;piritual guides, is to bribe their indolence, by
affixing &s;tated &s;alaries to their profe&s;&s;ion, and rendering
it &s;uperfluous for them to be farther active, than merely
to pre&s;erve their flock from &s;traying in que&s;t of new
pa&s;tures. And in this manner eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments,
tho' commonly they aro&s;e at fir&s;t from religious views,
prove in the end advantageous to the political intere&s;ts
of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT we may ob&s;erve, that few eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;h|ments
have been fixed upon a wor&s;e foundation than that
of the church of Rome, or have been attended with
<PB N="35" REF="43">
circum&s;tances more hurtful to the peace and happine&s;s
mankind.</P>
<P>THE large revenues, privileges, immunities, and pow|ers
of the clergy rendered them formidable to the civil
magi&s;trate, and armed with too exten&s;ive authority an
order of men, who always adhere clo&s;ely together, and
who never want a plau&s;ible pretence for their encroach|ments
and u&s;urpations. The higher dignities of the
church &s;erved, indeed, to the &s;upport of gentry and no|bility;
but by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of mona&s;teries, many of
the lowe&s;t vulgar were taken from the u&s;eful arts, and
maintained in tho&s;e receptacles of &s;loth and ignorance.
The &s;upreme head of the church was a foreign potentate,
who was guided by intere&s;ts, always different, &s;ometimes
contrary to tho&s;e of the community. And as the hie|rarchy
was nece&s;&s;arily &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve an unity of
faith, rites and ceremonies, all liberty of thought ran a
manife&s;t ri&s;que of being extingui&s;hed; and violent per|&s;ecutions,
or what was wor&s;e, a &s;tupid and abject credu|lity,
took place every where.</P>
<P>TO encrea&s;e the&s;e evils, the church, tho' &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
large revenues, was not contented with her acqui&s;itions,
but retained a power of practi&s;ing farther on the ignor|ance
of mankind. She even be&s;towed on each individual
prie&s;t a power of enriching him&s;elf by the voluntary
oblations of the faithful, and left him &s;till a powerful
motive for diligence and indu&s;try in his calling. And
thus, that church, tho' an expen&s;ive and burthen&s;ome
e&s;tabli&s;hment, was liable to many of the inconveniences,
which belong to an order of prie&s;ts, tru&s;ted entirely to
their own art and invention for attaining a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>THE advantages, attending the Romi&s;h hierarchy,
were but a &s;mall compen&s;ation for its inconveniences.
The eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, during barbarous times, had
&s;erved as a cheque to the de&s;poti&s;m of Kings. The
<PB N="36" REF="44">
union of all the we&s;tern churches under the &s;upreme
pontiff facilitated the intercour&s;e of nations, and tended
to bind all the parts of Europe into a clo&s;e connection
with each other. And the pomp and &s;plendour of wor|&s;hip,
which belonged to &s;o opulent an e&s;tabli&s;hment,
contributed, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to the encouragement of
the fine arts, and began to diffu&s;e a general elegance of
ta&s;te, by uniting it with religion.</P>
<P>IT will ea&s;ily be conceived, that, tho' the ballance
of evil prevailed in the Romi&s;h church, this was not the
chief rea&s;on, which produced the reformation. A con|currence
of incidents mu&s;t have contributed to forward
that great work.</P>
<P>POPE Leo the tenth, by his generous and enterprizing
temper, had very much exhau&s;ted his trea&s;ury, and was
obliged to make u&s;e of every invention, which might
yield money, in order to &s;upport his protects, plea&s;ures,
and liberalities. The &s;cheme of &s;elling indulgences was
&s;ugge&s;ted to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the reform|ation.</NOTE> as an expedient which had often &s;erved
in former times to draw money from the chri&s;tian world,
and make devout people willing contributors to the
grandeur and riches of the court of Rome. The church,
it was &s;uppo&s;ed, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great &s;tock of merit, as
being intitled to all the good works of the &s;aints, be|yond
what were employed in their own ju&s;tification;
and even to the merits of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, which were
infinite and unbounded: And from this unexhau&s;ted
trea&s;ury, the pope might retail particular portions, and
by that traffic acquire money, to be employed in pious
purpo&s;es, the re&s;i&s;ting the Turk, or &s;ubduing &s;chi&s;|matics.
When the money came into his trea&s;ury,
the greate&s;t part of it was u&s;ually diverted to other
purpo&s;es<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fat$$r Paul and Sleidan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="45">
IT is commonly believed, that Leo, from the pene|tration
of his genius, and his familiarity with literature,
was fully acquainted with the ridicule and fallacy of the
doctrines, which, as &s;upreme pontiff, he was obliged by
his intere&s;t to promote: And it is the le&s;s wonder,
therefore, that he employed for his profit tho&s;e pious
frauds, which his predece&s;&s;ors, the mo&s;t ignorant and
credulous, had always, under plau&s;ible pretences, made
u&s;e of for their &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es. He publi&s;hed the &s;ale of
a general indulgence<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In 1517.</NOTE>; and as his expences had not
only exhau&s;ted his u&s;ual revenue, but even anticipated
the income of this extraordinary expedient, the &s;everal
branches of it were openly given away to particular per|&s;ons,
who were entitled to levy the impo&s;ition. The
produce particularly of Saxony and the countries border|ing
on the Baltic was a&s;&s;igned to his &s;i&s;ter, Magdalene,
married to Cibo, natural &s;on of Innocent the eighth; and
&s;he, in order to enhance her profit, had farmed out the
revenue to one Arcemboldi, a Genoe&s;e, now a bi&s;hop,
formerly a merchant, who &s;till retained all the lucrative
arts of his former profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, Sleidan.</NOTE>. The Au&s;tin friars had
u&s;ually been employed in Saxony to preach the indul|gences,
and from this tru&s;t had derived both profit and
con&s;ideration: But Arcemboldi, fearing, le&s;t practice
might have taught them means to &s;ecrete the money<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. I.</NOTE>,
and expecting no extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s from the ordinary
methods of collection, gave this occupation to the Domi|nicans.
The&s;e monks, in order to prove them&s;elves
worthy of the di&s;tinction, conferred on them, exaggerated
the benefit of indulgences by the mo&s;t unbounded pane|gyrics;
and advanced doctrines on that head, which,
tho' not more ridiculous than tho&s;e already received,
were &s;uch as the ears of the people were not yet fully
accu&s;t $word$ to. To add to the &s;candal, the collectors
<PB N="38" REF="46">
of this revenue are &s;aid to have lived very licentious
lives, and to have &s;pent in taverns, gaming hou&s;es, and
places &s;till more infamous, the money, which devout
per&s;ons had &s;aved from their u&s;ual expences, in order to
purcha&s;e a remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e circum&s;tances might have given offence,
but would have been attended with no event of any im|portance,
had there not ari&s;en a man, qualified to take
advantage of the incident. Martin Luther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin Luther.</NOTE> an Au&s;tin
friar, profe&s;&s;or in the univer&s;ity of Wirtemberg, re&s;enting
the affront put upon his order, began to preach again&s;t
the&s;e abu&s;es in the &s;ale of indulgences; and being natu|rally
of a fiery temper, and being provoked by oppo&s;ition,
he proceeded even to decry indulgences them&s;elves; and
was thence carried, by the heat of di&s;pute, to que&s;tion
the authority of the pope, from which his adver&s;aries
derived their chief arguments again&s;t him<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, Sleidan.</NOTE>. Still as he
enlarged his reading, in order to &s;upport the&s;e tenets, he
di&s;covered &s;ome new abu&s;e or error in the church of
Rome; and finding his opinions greedily hearkened to,
he promulgated them by writing, di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ermons,
conferences; and daily encrea&s;ed the number of his
di&s;ciples. All Saxony, all Germany, all Europe were
in a very little time filled with the voice of this daring
innovator; and men, rou&s;ed from that lethargy, in which
they had &s;o long &s;lept, began to call in que&s;tion the
mo&s;t antient and mo&s;t received opinions. The elector of
Saxony, favourable to Luther's doctrine, protected him
from the violence of the papal juri&s;diction: The republic
of Zuric even reformed their church according to the
new model: Many &s;overeigns of the empire, and the
imperial diet it&s;elf, &s;howed a favourable di&s;po&s;ition to|wards
it: And Luther, a man naturally inflexible, vehe|ment,
opinionative, was become incapable, either from
<PB N="39" REF="47">
promi&s;es of advancement, or terrors of &s;everity, to re|linqui&s;h
a &s;ect, of which he was him&s;elf the founder, and
which brought him a glory, &s;uperior to all others, the
glory of dictating the religious faith and principles of
multitudes.</P>
<P>THE rumour of the&s;e innovations &s;oon reached Eng|land;
and as there &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in that kingdom great
remains of the Lollards, who&s;e principles re&s;embled tho&s;e
of Luther, the new doctrines gained &s;ecretly many par|tizans
among the laity of all ranks and denominations.
Henry had been educated in a &s;trict attachment to the
church of Rome, and he bore a particular prejudice
again&s;t Luther, who, in his writings, &s;poke with con|tempt
of Thomas Aquinas, the King's favourite author:
He oppo&s;ed him&s;elf therefore to the progre&s;s of the Lu|theran
tenets, by all the influence which his exten&s;ive
and almo&s;t ab&s;olute authority conferred upon him: He
even undertook to combat them with weapons not u&s;u|ally
employed by monarchs, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the
flower of their age, and force of their pa&s;&s;ions. He
wrote a book in Latin again&s;t the principles of Luther;
a performance, which, if allowance be made for the
&s;ubject and the age, does no di&s;credit to his capacity.
He &s;ent a copy of it to Leo, who received &s;o magnificent
a pre&s;ent with great te&s;timony of regard; and conferred
on him, the title of <HI>defender of the faith;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry re|ceives the title of de|&s;ender of the faith.</NOTE> an appellation
&s;till retained by the Kings of England. Luther, who
was in the heat of controver&s;y, &s;oon wrote an an&s;wer
to Henry; and without regard to the dignity of his
antagoni&s;t, treated him with all the acrimony of &s;tyle,
to which, in the cour&s;e of his polemics, he had &s;o long
been accu&s;tomed. The King, by this ill u&s;age, was
&s;till more prejudiced again&s;t the new doctrines; but
the public, who naturally favour the weaker party, were
<PB N="40" REF="48">
inclined to attribute to Luther the victory in the di&s;|pute<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>. And as the controver&s;y became more illu&s;trious, by
Henry's entering the li&s;ts, it drew &s;till more the atten|tion
of mankind; and the Lutheran doctrine acquired
daily new converts in every part of Europe.</P>
<P>THE quick and &s;urprizing progre&s;s of this bold &s;ect may
ju&s;tly in part be a&s;cribed to the late invention of printing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;es of the progre&s;s of the re|formation.</NOTE>.
and revival of learning: Not that rea&s;on bore any con&s;i|derable
part, in opening men's eyes with regard to the
impo&s;tures of the Romi&s;h church: For of all branches
of literature, philo&s;ophy had, as yet, and till long after|wards,
made the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable progre&s;s; neither is
there any in&s;tance where argument has been able to free
the people from that enormous load of ab&s;urdity, with
which &s;uper&s;tition has every where overwhelmed them:
Not to mention, that the rapid advance of the Lutheran
doctrine, and the violence, with which it was embraced,
prove &s;ufficiently, that it owed not its &s;ucce&s;s to rea&s;on
and reflection. The art of printing and the revival of
learning forwarded its progre&s;s in another manner. By
means of that art, the books of Luther and his &s;ectaries,
full of vehemence, declamation and a rude eloquence,
were propagated more quickly, and in greater numbers.
The minds of men, &s;omewhat awakened from a pro|found
&s;leep of &s;o many centuries, were prepared for
every novelty, and &s;erupled le&s;s to tread in any unu&s;ual
path, which was opened to them. And as copies of the
Scriptures and other antient monuments of the chri&s;tian
faith became more common, men perceived the innova|tions,
which were introduced after the fir&s;t centuries;
and though argument and rea&s;oning could not give con|viction,
an hi&s;torical fact, well &s;upported, was able to
make impre&s;&s;ion on their under&s;tandings. Many of the
<PB N="41" REF="49">
powers, indeed, a&s;&s;umed by the church of Rome, were
very antient, and were prior to almo&s;t every political
government e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe: But as the eccle&s;ia&s;|tics
would not agree to po&s;&s;e&s;s their privileges as matters
of civil right, which time could render valid, but ap|pealed
&s;till to a divine origin, men were tempted to look
into their primitive charter; and they could, without
much difficulty, perceive its defect in truth and au|thenticity.</P>
<P>IN order to be&s;tow on this topic the greater influence,
Luther and his followers, not &s;atisfied with oppo&s;ing the
pretended divinity of the Romi&s;h church, and di&s;playing
the temporal inconveniencies of that e&s;tabli&s;hment, car|ried
matters-much farther, and treated the religion of
their ance&s;tors, as abominable, dete&s;table, damnable;
foretold by &s;acred writ it&s;elf as the &s;ource of all wicked|ne&s;s
and pollution. They denominated the pope anti|chri&s;t,
called his communion the &s;carlet whore, and
gave to Rome the appellation of Babylon; expre&s;&s;ions,
which, however applied, were to be found in Scripture,
and which were better calculated to operate on the
multitude than the mo&s;t &s;olid arguments. Excited by
conte&s;t and per&s;ecution on the one hand, by &s;ucce&s;s and
applau&s;e on the other, many of the reformers carried to
the greate&s;t extremity their oppo&s;ition again&s;t the church
of Rome; and in contradiction to the multiplied &s;uper|&s;titions,
with which that communion was loaded, they
adopted an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;train of devotion, which admitted
of no ob&s;ervances, rites or ceremonies, but placed all
merit in a my&s;terious &s;pecies of faith, in inward vi&s;ion,
rapture, and extacy. The new &s;ectaries, &s;eized with
this &s;pirit, were indefatigable in the propagation of their
doctrine, and &s;et at defiance all the anathemas and pu|ni&s;hments,
with which the Roman pontiff endeavoured
to overwhelm them.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="50">
THAT the civil power, however, might afford them
protection again&s;t the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, the Lu|therans
advanced doctrines favourable, in &s;ome re&s;pects,
to the temporal authority of &s;overeigns. They inveighed
again&s;t the abu&s;es of the court of Rome, with which men
were at that time generally di&s;contented; and exhorted
princes to rein&s;tate them&s;elves in tho&s;e powers, of which
the encroaching &s;pirit of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and e&s;pecially
of the &s;overeign pontiff, had &s;o long bereaved them.
They condemned celibacy and mona&s;tic vows, and
thereby opened the doors of the convents to tho&s;e who
were either tired of the obedience and cha&s;tity, or di&s;|gu&s;ted
with the licence, in which they had hitherto lived.
They blamed the exce&s;&s;ive riches, the idlene&s;s, the liber|tini&s;m
of the clergy; and pointed out their trea&s;ures
and revenues as lawful &s;poil to the fir&s;t invader. And as
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics had hitherto conducted a willing and a
&s;tupid audience, and were totally unacquainted with
controver&s;y, much more with every &s;pecies of true
literature; they were unable to defend them&s;elves again&s;t
men, armed with authorities, citations, and popular
topics, and qualified to triumph in every altercation or
debate. Such were the advantages, with which the re|formers
began their attack of the Roman hierarchy;
and &s;uch were the cau&s;es of their rapid and a&s;toni&s;hing
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>LEO the tenth, who&s;e over&s;ights and too &s;upine tru&s;t
in the profound ignorance of the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31&s;t Decem|ber.</NOTE> had given ri&s;e
to this &s;ect, but who&s;e &s;ound judgment, moderation and
temper, were well qualified to retard its progre&s;s, died in
the flower of his age, a little after he received the King's
book again&s;t Luther; and he was &s;ucceeded in the papal
chair, by Adrian, a Fleming, who had been tutor to the
emperor Charles. This man was &s;itted to gain on the
reformers by the integrity, candour, and &s;implicity of
<PB N="43" REF="51">
manners, by which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed; but, &s;o violent
were their prejudices again&s;t the church, he rather hurt
the cau&s;e by his imprudent exerci&s;e of tho&s;e virtues. He
frankly confe&s;&s;ed, that many abominable and dete&s;table
practices prevailed in the court of Rome; and by this
&s;incere avowal, he gave occa&s;ion of much triumph to
the Lutherans. This pontiff al&s;o, who&s;e penetration
was not equal to his good intentions, was &s;educed to
concur in that league, which Charles and Henry had
formed again&s;t France<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</NOTE>; and he thereby augmented the
&s;candal, occa&s;ioned by the practice of &s;o many preceding
popes, who &s;till made their &s;piritual arms &s;ub&s;ervient to
political purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE emperor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1522.</NOTE> Charles, who knew, that Wol&s;ey had
received a di&s;appointment in his ambitious hopes by the
election of Adrian, and who dreaded the re&s;entment of
that haughty mini&s;ter, was &s;olicitous to repair the breach
made in their friend&s;hip by this incident. He paid a
new vi&s;it to England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th May.</NOTE> and be&s;ides flattering the vanity
of the King and the cardinal, he repeated to Wol&s;ey all
the promi&s;es, which he had made him, of &s;econding his
preten&s;ions to the papal throne. Wol&s;ey, &s;en&s;ible that
Adrian's great age and infirmities promi&s;ed a &s;udden
vacancy, di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment, and was willing to
hope for a more pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue of the next election.
The emperor renewed the treaty made at Bruges, to
which &s;ome articles were added; and he agreed to in|demni&s;y
both the King and Wol&s;ey for the revenues
which they &s;hould lo&s;e by a breach with France. The
more to ingratiate him&s;elf with Henry and the Engli&s;h
nation, he gave to Surrey, admiral of England, a com|mi&s;&s;ion
for being admiral of his dominions; and he
him&s;elf was in&s;talled knight of the garter at London.
After a &s;tay of &s;ix weeks in England, he embarked at
<PB N="44" REF="52">
Southampton, and in ten days arrived in Spain, where
he &s;oon pacified the tumults which had ari&s;en in his
ab&s;ence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, epi&s;t. 765.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King declared war again&s;t France; and this
mea&s;ure was founded on &s;o little rea&s;on, that he could
allege nothing as a ground of quarrel, but Francis's re|fu&s;al
to &s;ubmit to his arbitration, and his &s;ending Albany
into Scotland. This la&s;t &s;tep had not been taken by the
French King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> till he was quite a&s;&s;ured of Henry's re&s;o|lution
to attack him. Surrey landed &s;ome troops at
Cherbourg in Normandy; and after laying wa&s;te the country,
he &s;ailed to Morlaix, a rich town in Britanny,
which he took and plundered. The Engli&s;h merchants
had great property in that place, which was no more
&s;pared by the &s;old$$$$ $word$ the goods of the French.
Surrey then left $span$ of the fleet to the vice-admiral;
and &s;ailed to Calais, where he took the com|mand
of the Engli&s;h army, de&s;tined for the inva&s;ion of
France. This army, when joined by forces from the
Low Countries under the command of the count de
Buren, con&s;i&s;ted in the whole of 18,000 men.</P>
<P>THE French had made it a maxim in all their wars
with the Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> &s;ince the reign of Charles the fifth,
never, without great nece&s;&s;ity, to hazard a general engage|ment;
and the duke of Vendome, who commanded
the French army, now embraced this wi&s;e policy.
He &s;upplied the towns mo&s;t expo&s;ed, e&s;pecially Boulogne,
Montreuil, Tero&uuml;enne, Hedin, with &s;trong garri&s;ons
and plenty of provi&s;ions: He him&s;elf took po&s;t at Abbe|ville,
with &s;ome Swi&s;s and French infantry, and a body
of cavalry: The count of Gui&s;e encamped under Mont|reuil
with &s;ix thou&s;and men. The&s;e two bodies were in
a &s;ituation to join upon occa&s;ion; to throw &s;uccour
<PB N="45" REF="53">
into any town, that was threatened; and to harra&s;s the
Engli&s;h in every movement. Surrey, who was not &s;up|plied
with magazines, fir&s;t divided his army for the con|venience
of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them; but finding that his quarters
were every moment beaten up by the activity of the
French generals, he drew together the forces, and laid
&s;iege to Hedin. But neither did he &s;ucceed in this enter|prize.
The garri&s;on made vigorous &s;allies upon his army:
The French forces a&s;&s;aulted them from without: Great
rains fell: Fatigue and bad weather threw his &s;oldiers
into dy&s;enteries: And Surrey was obliged to rai&s;e the
&s;iege, and put his troops into winter quarters about the
end of October. His rear guard was attacked at Pas in
Artois; and five or &s;ix hundred men were cut off; nor
could all his efforts make him ma&s;ter of one place within
the French frontier.</P>
<P>THE allies were more &s;ucce&s;sful in Italy. Lautrec,
who commanded the French, lo&s;t a bloody battle at Bi|cocca
near Milan; and was obliged to retire with the
remains of his army. This misfortune, which proceeded
from Francis's negligence in not &s;upplying Lautrec with
money<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</NOTE>. was followed by the lo&s;s of Genoa. The
ca&s;tle of Cremona was the &s;ole fortre&s;s in Italy, which
remained in the hands of the French.</P>
<P>EUROPE was now in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and &s;o con|nected
by alliances and intere&s;t, that it was almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible
for war to be kindled in one part, and not diffu&s;e
it&s;elf thro' the whole: But of all the leagues among
kingdoms, the clo&s;e&s;t was that which had &s;o long &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
between France and Scotland; and the Engli&s;h,
while at war with the former nation, could not expect
to remain long unmole&s;ted on the northern frontier. No
&s;ooner had Albany arrived in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> than he took
mea&s;ures for kindling a war with England; and he &s;um|moned
<PB N="46" REF="54">
the whole force of the kingdom to meet in the
fields of Ro&s;line<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond. Pi&s;cottie.</NOTE>. He thence conducted the army &s;outh|wards
into Annandale; and prepared to pa&s;s the borders
at Solway-Frith. But many of the nobility were di&s;|gu&s;ted
with the regent's admini&s;tration; and ob&s;erving,
that his connexions with his native country were very
feeble in compari&s;on of tho&s;e with France, they mur|mured,
that for the &s;ake of foreign intere&s;ts, their peace
&s;hould be &s;o often di&s;turbed, and war, during their King's
minority, be wantonly entered into with a neighbouring
nation, &s;o much &s;uperior in force and riches. The Gor|dons,
in particular, refu&s;ed to advance any farther; and
Albany, ob&s;erving a general di&s;content to prevail, was
obliged to conclude a truce with lord Dacres, warden of
the Engli&s;h we&s;t marches. Soon after, he departed for
France; and le&s;t the oppo&s;ite faction &s;hould gather force
in his ab&s;ence, he &s;ent thither before him the earl of An|gus,
hu&s;band to the queen dowager.</P>
<P>NEXT year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1523.</NOTE> Henry, that he might take advantage of
the regent's ab&s;ence, marched an army into Scotland
under the command of Surrey, who ravaged the Mer&s;e
and Teviotdale without oppo&s;ition, and burned the town
of Jedburgh. The Scots had neither King nor Regent
to conduct them: The two Humes had been put to
death: Angus was in a manner bani&s;hed; No nobleman
of vigour or authority remained, who was qualified to
a&s;&s;ume the government: And the Engli&s;h monarch, who
knew the di&s;tre&s;t &s;ituation of the country, determined to
pu&s;h them to extremity, in hopes of engaging them, by
the &s;en&s;e of their pre&s;ent mi&s;eries, to make a &s;olemn re|nounciation
of the French alliance, and embrace that of
England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Herbert.</NOTE>. He even gave them hopes of contracting a
<PB N="47" REF="55">
marriage between the lady Mary, heire&s;s of England,
and their young monarch; an expedient, which would
for ever unite the two kingdoms<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 39.</NOTE>: And the queen dow|ager,
with her whole party, recommended every where
the advantages of this alliance, and of a confederacy with
England. They &s;aid, that the intere&s;ts of Scotland had
too long been &s;acrificed to tho&s;e of the French nation,
who, whenever they found them&s;elves reduced to diffi|culties,
called for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their allies, but were
ready to abandon them, &s;o &s;oon as they found their ad|vantage
in making peace with England: That where a
&s;mall &s;tate entered into &s;o clo&s;e a confederacy with a
greater, it mu&s;t always expect this treatment, as a con|&s;equence
of the unequal alliance; but that there were
peculiar circum&s;tances in the &s;ituation of the kingdoms,
which, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, rendered it inevitable: That
France was &s;o di&s;tant and &s;o divided from them by &s;eas,
that &s;he &s;carce could by any means, and never could in
time, &s;end &s;uccours to the Scots, &s;ufficient to protect
them again&s;t ravages from the neighbouring kingdom:
That nature had, in a manner, framed an alliance be|tween
the two Briti&s;h nations; having enclo&s;ed them in
the &s;ame i&s;land; given them the &s;ame manners, language,
laws, and form of government; and prepared every
thing for an intimate union between them: And that, if
national antipathies were aboli&s;hed, which would &s;oon
be the effect of peace, the&s;e two kingdoms, &s;ecured by
the ocean and by their dome&s;tic force, could &s;et at de|fiance
all foreign enemies, and remain for ever &s;ecure and
unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE partizans of the French alliance &s;aid, on the
other hand, that the very rea&s;ons, which were urged in
favour of a league with England, the clo&s;e neighbour|hood
of the kingdom and its &s;uperior force, were the
<PB N="48" REF="56">
real cau&s;es, why a &s;incere and durable confederacy could
never be framed with that ho&s;tile nation: That among
neighbouring &s;tates, occa&s;ions of quarrel were frequent;
and the more powerful people would be &s;ure to &s;eize
every frivolous pretence for oppre&s;&s;ing the weaker, and
reducing them to &s;ubjection: That as the near neigh|bourhood
of France and England had kindled a war al|mo&s;t
perpetual between them, it was the intere&s;t of the
Scots, if they wi&s;hed to maintain their independancy, to
pre&s;erve their league with the former kingdom, which
ballanced the force of the latter: That if they de&s;erted
that old and &s;alutary alliance, on which their importance
in Europe chiefly depended, their antient enemies, &s;ti|mulated
both by intere&s;t and by pa&s;&s;ion, would &s;oon in|vade
them with &s;uperior force, and reduce them to &s;ub|jection:
Or if they delayed the attack, the in&s;idious
peace, by making the Scots lo&s;e the u&s;e of arms, would
only prepare the way for a &s;lavery more certain and more
irretrieveable<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE arguments employed by the French party, being
&s;econded by the natural prejudices of the people, &s;eemed
rather to prevail: And when the regent him&s;elf, who
had been long detained beyond his appointed time by the
terror of the Engli&s;h fleet, at la&s;t appeared among them,
he was able to throw the balance entirely on that &s;ide.
By the authority of the convention of &s;tates, he a&s;&s;embled
an army, with a view of avenging the ravages committed
by the Engli&s;h in the beginning of the campaign; and
he led them &s;outhwards towards the borders. But when
they were pa&s;&s;ing the Tweed at the bridge of Melro&s;s,
the Engli&s;h party were again able to rai&s;e &s;uch oppo&s;ition,
that Albany thought proper to make a retreat. He
marched downwards, along the banks of the Tweed,
keeping that river on his right; and fixed his camp op|po&s;ite
<PB N="49" REF="57">
to Werk-Ca&s;tle, which Surrey had lately repaired.
He &s;ent over &s;ome troops to be&s;iege that fortre&s;s, who
made a breach in it, and &s;tormed &s;ome of the outworks:
But the regent, hearing of the approach of an Engli&s;h
army, and di&s;couraged by the advanced &s;ea&s;on, thought
proper to di&s;band his forces and retire to Edinburgh.
Soon after he went over to France, and never again re|turned
to Scotland. The Scots nation, agitated by their
dome&s;tic factions, were not, during &s;everal years, in a
condition to give any more di&s;turbance to England; and
Henry had full lei&s;ure to pro&s;ecute his de&s;igns on the
continent.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on, why the war again&s;t France proceeded
&s;o &s;lowly on the part of England was the want of money.
All Henry the &s;eventh's trea&s;ures were long &s;ince di&s;&s;i|pated;
the King's habits of expence &s;till remained; and
his revenues were unequal even to the ordinary &s;upport
of his government, much more to his military enter|prizes.
He had la&s;t year cau&s;ed a general &s;urvey to be
made of the kingdom; the numbers of men, their years,
profe&s;&s;ion, &s;tock, revenue<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe, 514.</NOTE>; and expre&s;&s;ed great &s;ati&s;|faction
on finding the nation &s;o opulent. He then i&s;&s;ued
out privy &s;eals to the mo&s;t wealthy, demanding loans of
particular &s;ums; and this act of power, tho' &s;omewhat
irregular and tyrannical, had been formerly practi&s;ed by
the Kings of England; and the people were now fami|liarized
to it. But Henry carried his authority much
farther on this occa&s;ion. He publi&s;hed an edict for a
general tax upon his &s;ubjects, which he &s;till called a loan;
and he levied five &s;hillings in the pound from the clergy,
two &s;hillings from the laity. This pretended loan, as
being more regular, was really more dangerous to the
liberties of the people; and was a precedent for the
King's impo&s;ing taxes without con&s;ent of Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="58">
HENRY &s;ummoned a Parliament this year, together
with a convocation; and found neither of them in a di&s;|po&s;ition
to complain of the infringement of their privi|leges.
It was only doubted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> how far they would carry
their liberality to the King. Wol&s;ey, who had under|taken
the management of this affair, began with the con|vocation;
in hopes, that their example would influence
the Parliament to grant a large &s;upply. He demanded a
moiety of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues to be levied in five
years, or two &s;hillings in the pound during that time,
and tho' he met with oppo&s;ition, he reprimanded &s;o &s;e|verely
the refractory members, that his reque&s;t was at la&s;t
complied with. The cardinal afterwards, attended by
&s;everal of the nobility and prelates, came to the hou&s;e of
commons; and in a long and elaborate &s;peech laid before
them the public nece&s;&s;ities, the dangers of an inva&s;ion
from Scotland, the affronts received from France, the
league in which the King was engaged with the pope and
the emperor; and he demanded a grant of 800,000
pounds, divided into four yearly payments; a &s;um, com|puted
from the late &s;urvey or valuation, to be equivalent
to four &s;hillings in the pound of one year's revenue, or
one &s;hilling in the pound yearly, according to the divi&s;ion
propo&s;ed. So large a grant was unu&s;ual from the com|mons;
and tho' the cardinal's demand was &s;econded by
Sir Thomas More the &s;peaker, and &s;everal other mem|bers
attached to the court, the hou&s;e could not be pre|vailed
with to comply<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Stowe, 518. Parliamentary Hi&s;tory. Strype, vol. i. p. 49, 50.</NOTE>. They only voted two &s;hillings
in the pound on all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of twenty pounds a year
and upwards, one &s;hilling on all between twenty pounds
and forty &s;hillings a year; and on all the re&s;t of the &s;ub|jects
above &s;ixteen years of age a groat a-head. This la&s;t
&s;um was divided into two yearly payments; the former
<PB N="51" REF="59">
into four yearly payments, and was not therefore at the
outmo&s;t above &s;ix-pence in the pound. The grant of the
commons was but the moiety of the &s;um demanded; and
the cardinal, therefore, much mortified with the di&s;ap|pointment,
came again to the hou&s;e, and de&s;ired to rea|&s;ion
with &s;uch as refu&s;ed to comply with the King's re|que&s;t.
He was told, that it was a rule of the hou&s;e never
to rea&s;on but among them&s;elves; and his de&s;ire was re|jected.
The commons, however, enlarged a little their
former grant, and voted an impo&s;ition of three &s;hillings
in the pound on all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fifty pounds, a year, and
upwards<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid, that when Henry heard that the commons made a great difficulty of granting the required &s;upply, he was &s;o provoked, that he &s;ent for Edward Montague, one of the members, who had a con&s;iderable influence on the hou&s;e; and he being introduced to his maje&s;ty, had the mortification to hear him &s;peak in the&s;e words: <HI>Hoo! Man! will they not &s;uffer my bill to pa&s;s?</HI> And laying his hand on Montague's head, who was then on his knees before him: <HI>Get my bill pa&s;&s;ed by to-morrow, or el&s;e to-morrow this head of yours &s;hall be off.</HI> This cavalier manner o$ Henry &s;ucceeded: For next day the bill was pa&s;&s;ed. <HI>Collins's British $eerage. Grove's life of Wol&s;ey.</HI> We are told by <HI>Hall,</HI> fol. 38. That cardinal Wol&s;ey endeavoured to terrify the citizens of London into the general loan, exacted in 1525, and told them plainly, that <HI>it were better, that &s;ome &s;hould &s;uffer indigence, than that the King at this time &s;hould lack; and therefore beware and re&s;i&s;t not, nor ruffle not in this ca&s;e, for it may for|tune to co&s;t &s;ome people their heads.</HI> Such was the &s;tyle, employed by this King and his mini&s;ters.</NOTE>. The proceedings of this hou&s;e of commons
di&s;cover evidently the humour of the times: They were
extremely tenacious of their money, and refu&s;ed a de|mand
of the crown, which was far from being unrea&s;on|able;
but they allowed an encroachment on national
privileges to pa&s;s uncen&s;ured, tho' its direct tendency
was to &s;ubvert entirely the liberties of the people. The
King was &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied with this &s;aving di&s;po&s;ition of the
commons, that, as he had not called a Parliament during
&s;even years before, he allowed &s;even more to elap&s;e, be|fore
<PB N="52" REF="60">
he &s;ummoned another. And on pretence of nece&s;&s;ity,
he levied, in one year, from all who were worth forty
pounds, what the parliament had granted him payable in
four years<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Speed. Hall. Herbert.</NOTE>; a new inva&s;ion of national privileges.
The&s;e irregularities were commonly a&s;cribed to the car|dinal's
coun&s;els, who, tru&s;ting to the protection, afforded
him by his eccle&s;ia&s;tical character, was le&s;s &s;crupulous
in his encroachments on the civil rights of the nation.</P>
<P>THAT ambitious prelate received this year a new di&s;|appointment
in his a&s;piring views. The pope, Adrian
the &s;ixth, died; and Clement the &s;eventh, of the family
of Medicis, was elected in his place, by the concurrence
of the imperial party. Wol&s;ey began now to perceive
the in&s;incerity of the emperor, and concluded that that
prince would never &s;econd his preten&s;ions to the papal
chair. This injury was highly re&s;ented by the cardinal;
and he began thenceforth to e&s;trange him&s;elf from the
imperial court, and to pave the way for an union between
his ma&s;ter and the French King. Meanwhile, he di&s;|&s;embled
his re&s;entment; and after congratulating the new
pope on his promotion, applied for a continuation of the
legatine powers, which the two former popes had con|ferred
upon him. Clement, knowing the importance of
gaining his friend&s;hip, granted him a commi&s;&s;ion for life;
and by this unu&s;ual conce&s;&s;ion, he in a manner tran&s;|ferred
to him the whole papal authority in England. In
&s;ome particulars, Wol&s;ey made a good u&s;e of this exten|&s;ive
power. He erected two colleges, one at Oxford,
another at Ip&s;wich, the place of his nativity: He &s;ought,
all over Europe, for learned men to &s;upply the chairs of
the&s;e colleges: And in order to be&s;tow endowments on
them, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;maller mona&s;teries, and di&s;tri|buted
the monks into other convents. The execution
of this project became the le&s;s difficult for him, becau&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="61">
the Romi&s;h church began to perceive, that &s;he over|abounded
in monks, and that &s;he wanted &s;ome &s;upply of
learning, in order to oppo&s;e the inqui&s;itive, or rather di&s;|putative,
humour of the new reformers.</P>
<P>THE confederacy again&s;t France &s;eemed more formi|dable
than ever, on the opening of this campaign<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 14.</NOTE>.
Adrian, before his death, had renewed the league with
Charles and Henry. The Venetians had been induced
to de&s;ert the French alliance, and to form engagements
for the &s;ecuring Sforza in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Milane&s;e. The
Florentines, the dukes of Ferrara and Mantua, and all
the powers of Italy combined in the &s;ame mea&s;ure. The
emperor in per&s;on menaced France with a powerful inva|&s;ion
on the &s;ide of Guienne: The forces of England and
the Netherlands &s;eemed ready to break into Picardy: A
numerous body of Germans were preparing to ravage
Burgundy: But all the&s;e perils from foreign enemies were
le&s;s threatening than a dome&s;tic con&s;piracy, which had
been forming, and which was now come to full maturity
again&s;t the French monarch.</P>
<P>CHARLES duke of Bourbon, con&s;table of France, was
a prince of the mo&s;t &s;hining merit; and, be&s;ide di&s;tin|gui&s;hing him&s;elf in many military enterprizes, he was
adorned with every accompli&s;hment, which became a
per&s;on of his high &s;tation. His virtues, embelli&s;hed with
the graces of youth, had made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on Loui&s;e
of Savoy, Francis's mother, that, without regard to the
inequality of their years, &s;he made him propo&s;als of mar|riage;
and meeting with a refu&s;al, &s;he formed &s;chemes
of unrelenting vengeance again&s;t him. She was a woman,
fal&s;e, deceitful, vindictive, malicious; but, unhappily
for France, had by her capacity, which was con&s;iderable,
acquired an ab&s;olute a&s;cendant over her &s;on. By her in|&s;tigation,
<PB N="54" REF="62">
Francis put many affronts on the con&s;table,
which it was difficult for a gallant &s;pirit to endure; and
at la&s;t he permi$ted Loui&s;e to pro&s;ecute a law&s;uit again&s;t
him, by which, on the mo&s;t frivolous pretences, he was
deprived of his ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and inevitable ruin was
brought upon him.</P>
<P>BOURBON, provoked at all the&s;e indignities, and
thinking, that, if any injuries could ju&s;tify a man in re|belling
again&s;t his prince and country, he mu&s;t &s;tand ac|quitted,
had entered into a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with
the emperor and the King of England<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, liv. 2.</NOTE>. Francis, per|tinacious
in his de&s;ign of recovering the Milane&s;e, had
propo&s;ed to lead his army in per&s;on into Italy; and Bour|bon,
who feigned &s;ickne&s;s, in order to have a pretence
for &s;taying behind, intended, &s;o &s;oon as the King had
pa&s;&s;ed the Alps, to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection among his nu|merous
va&s;&s;als, by whom he was extremely beloved, and
to introduce foreign enemies into the heart of the king|dom.
Francis got intimation of his de&s;ign; but not
being prompt enough in &s;ecuring &s;o dangerous a foe, the
con&s;table made his e&s;cape<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Belcarius, lib. 17.</NOTE>; and putting him&s;elf in the
emperor's &s;ervice, did all the injuries to his native coun|try,
which his enterprizing &s;pirit and his great talents for
war enabled him to perform. Charles profe&s;&s;ed &s;uch re|gard
for him, that he promi&s;ed him his &s;i&s;ter in marriage,
Eleonora, widow to Emanuel, King of Portugal; and
when the con&s;table came to Madrid, &s;ome time after,
the emperor received him with all the demon&s;trations of
friend&s;hip. He &s;aid to a Spani&s;h grandee, that he mu&s;t
de&s;ire him, while Bourbon re&s;ided in that city, to allow
him to take up his re&s;idence in his hou&s;e, as mo&s;t &s;uitable
to his rank and quality. The nobleman replied, with a
Ca&s;tilian dignity, that his maje&s;ty's de&s;ire was to him a
<PB N="55" REF="63">
&s;ufficient rea&s;on; but he mu&s;t tell him beforehand, that
&s;o &s;oon as Bourbon departed, he would raze to the ground
the hou&s;e which had been polluted by the pre&s;ence of &s;uch
a traitor<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of England, de&s;irous that Francis &s;hould
undertake his Italian expedition, did not openly threaten
Picardy this year with an inva&s;ion; and it was late before
the duke of Suffolk, who commanded the Engli&s;h forces,
pa&s;&s;ed over to Calais.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Aug.</NOTE> He was attended with the lords
Montacute, Herbert, Ferrars, Morney, Sandys, Berke|ley,
Powis, and many other noblemen and gentlemen<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>.
The Engli&s;h army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> reinforced by &s;ome troops, drawn
from the garri&s;on of Calais, amounted to about 12,000
men; and having joined an equal number of Flemings
under the count de Buren, they prepared for an inva&s;ion
of France. The &s;iege of Boulogne was fir&s;t propo&s;ed;
but that enterprize appearing difficult, it was thought
more advi&s;eable to leave this town behind them. The
frontier of Picardy was very ill provided of troops; and
the only defence of that province was the activity of the
French officers, who infe&s;ted the allied army in their
march, and threw garri&s;ons, with great expedition, into
every town, which was threatened by them. After
coa&s;ting the Somme, and pa&s;&s;ing Hedin, Montreuil, Dour|lens,
the Engli&s;h and Flemings pre&s;ented them&s;elves be|fore
Bray, a place of &s;mall force, which commanded a
bridge over the Somme. Here they were re&s;olved to
pa&s;s, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to take up winter quarters in
France; but Crequi threw him&s;elf into the town, and
&s;eemed determined to defend it. The allies attacked him
with vigour and &s;ucce&s;s; and when he retreated over the
bridge, they pur&s;ued him &s;o hotly, that they allowed him
not time to break it down, but pa&s;&s;ed it along with him,
and put him to route. They next advanced to Mont|didier,
<PB N="56" REF="64">
which they be&s;ieged and took by capitulation,
Meeting with no oppo&s;ition, they proceeded to the river
Oi&s;e, within eleven leagues of Paris, and threw that city
into great con&s;ternation; till the duke of Vend&ocirc;me ha&s;|tened
with &s;ome forces to its relief. The confederates,
then, afraid of being &s;urrounded, and reduced to extre|mities
during &s;o advanced a &s;ea&s;on, thought proper to re|tire.
Montdidier was abandoned: And the Engli&s;h and
Flemings went each into their own country.</P>
<P>FRANCE defended her&s;elf from the other inva&s;ions
with equal facility and equal good fortune. Twelve
thou&s;and Lan&s;quenets broke into Burgundy under the
command of the count of Fur&s;tenberg. The count of
Gui&s;e, who defended that frontier, had nothing to op|po&s;e
to them but &s;ome militia, and about nine hundred
heavy-armed cavalry. He threw the militia into the gar|ri&s;on-towns;
and with his cavalry, he kept the field,
and &s;o harra&s;&s;ed the Germans, that they were glad to
make their retreat into Lorraine. Gui&s;e attacked them
as they pa&s;&s;ed the Meu&s;e, put them into di&s;order, and
cut off the greate&s;t part of their rear.</P>
<P>THE emperor made great preparations on the &s;ide of
Navarre; and, tho' that frontier was well guarded by
nature, it &s;eemed now expo&s;ed to great danger from this
powerful inva&s;ion which threatened it. Charles be&s;ieged
Fontarabia, which had fallen a few years before into
Francis's hands; and when he had drawn thither Lautrec,
the French general, he rai&s;ed the &s;iege of a &s;udden, and
&s;at down before Bayonne. Lautrec, aware of that &s;tra|tagem,
made a &s;udden march and threw him&s;elf into Bay|onne,
which he defended with &s;uch vigour and courage,
that the Spaniards were con&s;trained to rai&s;e the &s;iege.
The emperor would have been totally unfortunate on this
$ide, had he not turned back upon Fontarabia, and,
contrary to the advice of all his generals, &s;at down, in
<PB N="57" REF="65">
the winter &s;ea&s;on, before that city, well fortified and
&s;trongly garri&s;oned. The cowardice or mi&s;conduct of
the governor &s;aved him the &s;hame of a new di&s;appoint|ment.
The place was &s;urrendered in a few days; and
the emperor, having fini&s;hed this enterprize, put his
troops into winter quarters.</P>
<P>SO ob&s;tinate was Francis in pro&s;ecuting his Italian ex||pedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Italian wars.</NOTE>
that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e dangerous inva&s;ions,
with which his kingdom was menaced on every &s;ide, he
had determined to lead in per&s;on a powerful army to the
conque&s;t of Milan. The intelligence of Bourbon's revolt
and e&s;cape &s;topped him at Lyons; and fearing &s;ome in|$urrection in the kingdom from the intrigues of a man
&s;o powerful and &s;o beloved, he thought it prudent to re|main
in France; and to &s;end forward his army, under
the command of admiral Bonnivet. The dutchy of Milan
had been purpo&s;ely left in a condition &s;omewhat defence|le&s;s,
with a view of alluring Francis to attack it; and no
&s;ooner had Bonnivet pa&s;&s;ed the Te&s;in, than the army of
the league, and even Pro&s;per Colonna, who commanded
it, a very prudent general, were in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion.
It is agreed, that if Bonnivet had immediately advanced
to Milan, that great city, on which the whole dutchy
depends, would have opened its gates without re&s;i&s;tance:
But as he wa&s;ted his time in frivolous enterprizes, Co|lonna
had opportunity to reinforce the garri&s;on, and to
put the place in a po&s;ture of defence. Bonnivet was
now obliged to attempt reducing the city by blockade and
famine; and he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ail the po&s;ts, which
commanded the pa&s;&s;ages to it. But the army of the
league, mean-while, was not inactive; and they &s;o
&s;traitened and harra&s;&s;ed the quarters of the French, that
it &s;eemed more likely the latter would them&s;elves peri&s;h
by famine, than reduce the city to that extremity. Sick|ne&s;s
and fatigue and want had wa&s;ted them to &s;uch a<NOTE PLACE="marg">1524.</NOTE>
<PB N="58" REF="66">
degree, that they were ready to rai&s;e the blockade; and
their only hopes con&s;i&s;ted in a great body of Swi&s;s, which
was levied for the &s;ervice of the French King, and who&s;e
arrival was every day expected.</P>
<P>THE Swi&s;s had in that ago &s;o great a &s;uperiority in
the field above a almo&s;t every other nation, and had been
&s;o much courted by all the great potentates of Europe,
that they were become extremely capricious and haughty,
and thought that the &s;ate of kingdoms depended entirely
on their a&s;&s;i&s;tance or oppo&s;ition. Francis had promi&s;ed
to this body of mercenaries, whom he had hired to join
Bonnivet, that &s;o &s;oon as they arrived in the plains of
Piedmont, the duke of Longueville &s;hould join them
with four hundred lances, and conduct them to the
French camp: But by &s;ome accident Longueville's
march had been retarded, and the Swi&s;s had been oblig|ed
to march, without the honour of being e&s;corted by
him. Offended at this neglect, as they interpreted it,
they no &s;ooner came within &s;ight of the French camp,
than they &s;topped, and in&s;tead of joining Bonnivet, they
&s;ent orders to a great body of their countrymen, who
then &s;erved under him, immediately to begin their march,
and to return home in their company<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15. Memoires du Bellay, liv. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER, this de&s;ertion of the Swi&s;s, Bonnivet had no
other choice, but that of making his retreat, as fa&s;t as
po&s;&s;ible, into France. He accordingly put him&s;elf in
motion for that purpo&s;e; but the allies, who fore&s;aw
this mea&s;ure, were ready to fall upon his rear. The
French army, however, after a &s;harp action, made good
their retreat, though not without con&s;iderable lo&s;s both
in officers and private men. Among the re&s;t, fell in
this action the brave chevalier. Bayard, e&s;teemed in that
age the model of &s;oldiers and men of honour, and de|nominated
<PB N="59" REF="67">
the <HI>knight without fear and withhout reproach.</HI>
When this gallant gentleman felt his wounds to be mor|tal,
and could no longer &s;upport him&s;elf on hor&s;eback,
he ordered his attendants to &s;et him under a tree, and
turn his face towards the enemy, that he might die in
that po&s;ture. The generals of the allies, and among
the re&s;t the duke of Bourbon, came about him, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
their concern for his pre&s;ent condition. &startq;Pity
not me,&endq; cried he to Bourbon; &startq;I die in the di&s;|charge
of my duty: They alone are the objects of
pity, who fight again&s;t their prince and country<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, vol. iii. p. 152.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE French being thus expelled Italy, the pope, the
Venetian's, the Florentines were &s;atisfied with the ad|vantage
obtained over them, and were re&s;olved to pro&s;e|cute
their victory no farther. All the&s;e powers, e&s;pecially
Clement, had entertained a violent jealou&s;y of the em|peror's
ambition; and their jealou&s;y was extremely aug|mented,
when they &s;aw him refu&s;e the inve&s;titure of
Milan, a fief of the empire, to Francis Sforza, who&s;e
title he had acknowledged, and who&s;e defence he had
embraced<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15.</NOTE>. They all concluded, that he intended to
put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that important dutchy, and
reduce Italy to &s;ubjection: Clement in particular, actu|ated
by this jealou&s;y, proceeded &s;o far in oppo&s;ition to
the emperor, that he &s;ent orders to his nuncio at London
to mediate a reconciliation between France and England.
But affairs were not yet fully ripe for this change.
Wol&s;ey, di&s;gu&s;ted with the emperor, but &s;till more actu|ated
by vain-glory, was determined, that he him&s;elf
&s;hould have the renown of bringing about that great alter|ation;
and he engaged the King to reject the pope's medi|ation.
A new treaty was even concluded between Henry
and Charles for the inva&s;ion of France. Charles &s;tipu|lated

to &s;upply the duke of Bourbon with a powerful
army, in order to conquer Provence and Dauphiny:
Henry agreed to pay him a hundred thou&s;and crowns for
the fir&s;t month; after which, he might either chu&s;e to
continue the &s;ame monthly payments, or invade Picardy
with a powerful army. Bourbon was to po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e
provinces with the title of King; but to hold them in
fief of Henry as King of France. The dutchy of Bur|gundy
was to be given to Charles: The re&s;t of the
kingdom to Henry.</P>
<P>THIS chimerical partition immediately failed of exe|cution
in the article, which was mo&s;t ea&s;ily performed:
Bourbon refu&s;ed to acknowledge Henry as King of
France. His enterprize, however, again&s;t Provence &s;till
took place. A numerous army of Imperiali&s;ts invad|ed
that country under his command and that of the
marquis of Pe&s;cara. They laid &s;iege to Mar&s;eilles,
which, being weakly garri&s;oned, they expected to carry
in a little time: But the burge&s;&s;es defended them&s;elves
with &s;uch valour and ob&s;tinacy, that Bourbon and Pe|&s;cara,
who heard of the French King's approach with a
numerous army, found them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of
rai&s;ing the &s;iege; and they led their forces, much weak|ened,
baffled, and di&s;heartened, into Italy.</P>
<P>FRANCIS might now have enjoyed in &s;afety the glory
of repul&s;ing all his enemies, in every attempt which
they had hitherto made of breaking into his kingdom:
But as he received intelligence, that the King of England,
di&s;couraged by his former fruitle&s;s enterprizes, and di&s;|gu&s;ted with the emperor, was making no preparations
for the inva&s;ion of Picardy, his antient ardour &s;eized
him for the conque&s;t of Milan; and, notwith&s;tanding
the advanced &s;ea&s;on, he was immediately determined,
contrary to the advice of his wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors,
to lead his army into Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="71">
HE pa&s;&s;ed the Alps at Mount Cenis, and no &s;ooner
appeared in Piedmont, than he threw the whole Milane&s;e
into con&s;ternation. There was no army in the field able
to oppo&s;e him; and Milan it&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France invades Itlay.</NOTE> though affectionate to
its duke, was not in the &s;ame po&s;ture of defence as la&s;t
year, when blockaded by admiral Bonnivet. It was
almo&s;t de&s;titute of inhabitants: Great numbers had died
of the plague; and the re&s;t had fled into the country
for &s;afety. Francis immediately marched to that city,
which opened its gates to receive him. The forces of
the emperor and Sforza fled to Lodi; and had Francis
been &s;o fortunate as to pur&s;ue them, they had abandoned
that place, and had been totally di&s;&s;ipated<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 15. Du Bellay, lib, 2.</NOTE>. But his ill
fate led him to be&s;iege Pavia, a town of con&s;iderable
&s;trength, well-garri&s;oned, and defended by Leyva, one
of the brave&s;t officers in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice. Every at|tempt,
which the French King made to gain this im|portant
place, proved fruitless. He battered the walls,
and made breaches; but by the vigilance of Leyva,
new retrenchments were in&s;tantly thrown up behind the
breaches: He attempted to divert the cour&s;e of the
Te&s;in, which ran by one &s;ide of the city, and defended
it; but an inundation of the river deftroyed in one
night all the mounds which the &s;oldiers, during a long
time, and with infinite pains, had been erecting. Fa|tigue
and the bad &s;ea&s;on (for it was now the depth of
winter) had wa&s;ted the French army. And the more
to dimini&s;h its force, Francis, at the pope's &s;olicitation,
who now declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1525.</NOTE> almo&s;t openly, for him, had detach|ed
a con&s;iderable body, under the duke of Albany, to
invade the kingdom of Naples. The imperial generals
mean while were not idle. Pe&s;cara and Lannoy, vice|roy
of Naples, gathered forces from all quarters. Bour|bon,
having pawned his jewels for money, went into
<PB N="62" REF="72">
Germany, and by his per&s;onal intere&s;t, levied twelve
thou&s;and Lan&s;quenets, with which he joined the impe|riali&s;ts.
This army was advancing to rai&s;e the &s;iege of
Pavia; and the danger to the French became every day
more imminent.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of Europe was &s;uch, during that age, that,
partly from the want of commerce and indu&s;try every
where, except in Italy and the Low Countries, partly
from the exten&s;ive privileges &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the people
in all the great monarchies, and their frugal maxims in
granting money, the revenues of the princes were ex|tremely
narrow, and even the &s;mall armies, which they
kept on foot, could not be regularly paid by them. The
imperial forces, commanded by Bourbon, Pe&s;cara, and
Lannoy, exceeded not twenty thou&s;and men; they were
the only body of troops maintained by the emperor (for
he had not been able to levy any army for the inva&s;ion of
France, either on the &s;ide of Spain or Flanders.) Yet
&s;o poor was that mighty monarch, that he could tran&s;|mit
no money for the payment of this army; and it was
chiefly the hopes of &s;haring the plunder of the French
camp, which had made them advance, and kept them
to their &s;tandards. Had Francis rai&s;ed the &s;iege before
their approach, and retired to Milan, they mu&s;t immedi|ately
have di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves; and he bad obtained a
complete victory, without danger or blood&s;hed. But it
was the character of this monarch, to become ob&s;tinate
in proportion to the difficulties which he encountered;
and having once &s;aid, that he would take Pavia or peri&s;h
before it, he was re&s;olved rather to endure the utmo&s;t
extremities than depart from this re&s;olution.</P>
<P>THE imperial generals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Fe|bruary. Battle of Pavia, and captivity of Francis.</NOTE> after cannonading the French
camp for &s;everal days, at la&s;t gave a general a&s;&s;ault, and
and broke into the intrenchments. Leyva fallied from the
town, and threw the be&s;iegers into &s;till greater confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="73">
The Swi&s;s infantry, contrary to their u&s;ual practice,
behaved in a da&s;tardly manner, and de&s;erted their po&s;t.
Francis's whole army was put to rout; and he him&s;elf,
&s;urrounded by his enemies, after fighting with the mo&s;t
heroic valour, and killing &s;even men with his own
hand, was at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf pri&s;oner.
Almo&s;t the whole army, full of nobility and brave of|ficers,
either peri&s;hed by the &s;word, or were drowned in
the river. The few, who e&s;caped with their lives, fell
into the hands of the enemy. The imperial generals
had &s;o little authority over their own troops, even after
this &s;ignal victory, that Lannoy, apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the
Lan&s;quenets &s;hould &s;eize Francis as &s;ecurity for the pay
due to them, immediately removed him from the camp,
and &s;ent him to Pizzighitone. And taking advantage
of the terrors, which had &s;eized the pope, the Florentines,
the duke of Ferrara, and other Italian &s;tates, he obliged
them, though &s;ecretly enemies, to advance money for the
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his army.</P>
<P>THE emperor received this news by Pennalo&s;a, who
pa&s;&s;ed through France, by means of a &s;afe-conduct,
which he received from the captive King. The modera|tion,
which he di&s;played on this occa&s;ion, had it been
&s;incere, would have done him great honour. In&s;tead of
rejoicing, he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ympathy with Francis's ill for|tune,
and di&s;covered his &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e calamities, to
which the greate&s;t monarchs are expo&s;ed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vera. hi&s;t. de Charl. V.</NOTE>. He refu&s;ed
the city of Madrid permi&s;&s;ion to make any public expre&s;|&s;ions
of triumph; and &s;aid that he re&s;erved all his exulta|tion
till he &s;hould be able to obtain &s;ome victory over
the infidels. He &s;ent orders to his frontier garri&s;ons to
commit no ho&s;tilities upon France. He &s;poke of con|cluding
immediately a peace on rea&s;onable terms. But
all this &s;eeming equity was only hypocri&s;y, &s;o much the
<PB N="64" REF="74">
more dangerous, as it was profound. And his &s;ole oc|cupation
was the forming &s;chemes, how, from this great
incident, he might draw the utmo&s;t advantage, and gra|tify
that exorbitant ambition, by which, in all his actions,
he was wholly governed.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Pennalo&s;a, in pa&s;&s;ing through France, car|ried
al&s;o a letter from Francis to his mother, whom he
had left regent, and who then re&s;ided at Lyons. It
contained only the&s;e few words, <HI>Madam, all is lo&s;t,
except our honour.</HI> The prince&s;s was &s;truck with the greatne&s;s
of the calamity. She &s;aw the kingdom without a &s;ove|reign,
without an army, without generals, without
money; &s;urrounded on every hand by implacable and
victorious enemies: And her &s;ole re&s;ource, in her pre&s;ent
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, were the hopes, which &s;he entertained, of peace
and even of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the King of England.</P>
<P>HAD the King entered into the war again&s;t France
from any concerted political views, it is evident, that
the victory of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis, were
the mo&s;t fortunate incidents which could have befallen
him, and the only ones which could render his &s;chemes
effectual. While the war was carried on in the former
feeble manner, without any deci&s;ive advantage, he might
have been able to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of &s;ome frontier towns,
or perhaps of a &s;mall territory, which he could not keep
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, without expending much more than its
value. By &s;ome great calamity alone, which annihilated
the power of France, could he hope to acquire the do|minion
of con&s;iderable provinces, or di&s;member that
mighty monarchy, &s;o affectionate to its own government
and its own &s;overeigns. But as it is probable, that Henry
had never before carried his reflections &s;o far; he was
&s;tartled at this important event, and became &s;en&s;ible of
his own danger, as well as that of all Europe, from the lo&s;s
of a proper counterpoi&s;e to the great power of Charles.
<PB N="65" REF="75">
In&s;tead of taking advantage, therefore, of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
condition of France, he was determined to lend her his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her pre&s;ent calamities; and as the glory of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry em|braces the alliance of France.</NOTE>
genero&s;ity, in rai&s;ing a fallen enemy, concurred with his
political intere&s;ts, he he&s;&s;itated the le&s;s in embracing the&s;e
new mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>SOME di&s;gu&s;ts al&s;o had previou&s;ly taken place between
Charles and Henry, and &s;till more between Charles and
Wol&s;ey; and that powerful minifter waited only for a
favourable opportunity of revenging the di&s;appointments,
which he had met with. The behaviour of Charles,
immediately after the victory of Pavia, gave him oc|ca&s;ion
to revive the King's jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picions of his
ally. The emperor &s;upported &s;o ill the appearance of
moderation, which he at fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed, that he had al|ready
changed his u&s;ual &s;tile to Henry; and in&s;tead of
writing to him with his own hand, and &s;ub&s;cribing him|&s;elf
<HI>your affectionate &s;on and cou&s;in;</HI> he dictated his letters
to his &s;ecretary, and &s;imply &s;ub&s;cribed him&s;elf <HI>Charles</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>.
Wol&s;ey al&s;o perceived a diminution in the care&s;&s;es and
profe&s;&s;ions, with which the emperor's letters to him were
u&s;ually loaded; and this la&s;t imprudence, proceeding from
the intoxication of &s;ucce&s;s, was probably more dangerous
to Charles's intere&s;ts than the other.</P>
<P>HENRY, though determined to embrace new mea&s;ures,
was careful to &s;ave appearances in the change; and he
cau&s;ed rejoicings to be every where made on account of
the victory of Pavia, and the captivity of Francis. He

with her; and be&s;ides a&s;&s;uring her of his friendship and
protection, he exacted a promi&s;e, that &s;he never would
con&s;ent to the di&s;membering any province of the mo|narchy
for her &s;on's ran&s;om. With the emperor, how|ever,
he put on the appearance of vigour and enterprize;
and in order to have a pretence for breaking with him,
he di&s;patched Ton&s;tal, bi&s;hop of London, to Madrid,
with propo&s;als for a powerful inva&s;ion of France. He
required, that Charles &s;hould immediately enter Guienne
at the head of a great army, in order to put him in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that province; and he demanded the payment
of large &s;ums of money, which that prince had borrowed
from him in his la&s;t vi&s;it at London. He knew, that
the emperor was in no &s;ituation of executing either of
the&s;e conditions; and that he had as little inclination to
make him ma&s;ter of &s;uch con&s;iderable territories upon the
frontiers of Spain.</P>
<P>TONSTAL likewi&s;e, after his arrival at Madrid, in|formed
his ma&s;ter, that Charles, on his part, wanted
not complaints again&s;t England; and in particular was
di&s;plea&s;ed with Henry, becau&s;e la&s;t year he had neither
continued his monthly payments to Bourbon, nor invad|ed
Picardy, according to his &s;tipulations; that, in&s;tead
of expre&s;&s;ing his intentions to e&s;pou&s;e Mary, when &s;he
&s;hould be marriageable, he had hearkened to propo&s;als,
for marrying his niece I&s;abella, prince&s;s of Portugal;
and that he had entered into a &s;eparate treaty with Fran|cis,
and &s;eemed determined to reap alone all the advan|tages
of the &s;ucce&s;s, with which fortune had crowned
his arms.</P>
<P>THE King, influenced by all the&s;e motives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE> conclud|ed
at Moore his alliance with the regent, and engaged
to procure Francis his liberty on reafonable conditions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Du Tillet, Resueil des Traites de Leonard, t$m, 2. Merbert.</NOTE>:
<PB N="67" REF="77">
The regent al&s;o, in another treaty, acknowledged the
kingdom to be Henry's debtor for one million eight hun|dred
thou&s;and crowns, to be di&s;charged in half yearly
payments of fifty thou&s;and crowns; After which, Henry
was to receive during his own life, a yearly pen&s;ion of a
hundred thou&s;and crowns. Notwith&s;tanding his gene|ro&s;ity,
he could not forbear taking advantage of the ca|lamitous
&s;ituation of France, in order to exact this lucra|tive
condition from her. A large pre&s;ent of a hundred
thou&s;and crowns was al&s;o made to Wol&s;ey, for his good
offices, but covered under the pretence of arrears due on
the pen&s;ion granted him for relinqui&s;hing the admini&s;tra|tion
of Tournay.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, as Henry fore&s;aw, that this treaty with
France might involve him in a war with the emperor,
he was al&s;o determined to fill his trea&s;ury by impo&s;itions
upon his own &s;ubjects; and as the parliament had di&s;|covered
&s;ome reluctance in complying with his demands,
he followed the advice of Wol&s;ey, and re&s;olved to make
u&s;e of his prerogative alone for that purpo&s;e. He i&s;&s;ued
out commi&s;&s;ions to all the counties of England, for levy|ing
four &s;hillings in the pound from the clergy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contends of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> three
&s;hillings and four pence from the laity; and &s;o uncon|troulable
did he deem his authority, that he took no
care to cover, as formerly, this arbitrary exaction, even
under the &s;lender pretence of a loan. But he &s;oon found,
that he had pre&s;umed too far on the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of
his &s;ubjects. The people, di&s;plea&s;ed with an exaction,
beyond what was u&s;ually levied in tho&s;e days, but &s;till more di&s;gu&s;ted with the illegal method of impo&s;ing it,
broke out in murmurs, complaints, oppo&s;ition to the
commi&s;&s;ioners; and their refractory di&s;po&s;ition even
threatened a general in$urrection. Henry had the pru|dence
to &s;top &s;hort, in that dangerous path, into which
he had entered. He &s;ent letters to all the counties;
<PB N="68" REF="78">
declaring, that he meant no force by this la&s;t imposition,
and that he would take nothing of his &s;ubjects but by
way of <HI>benevolence.</HI> He flattered him&s;elf, that his con|de&s;cen&s;ion in employing that di&s;gui&s;e would &s;atisfy the
people, and that no one would dare to render him&s;elf
obnoxious to royal authority, by refu&s;ing any payment
required of him in this manner. But the &s;pirit of oppo|sition
was once rou&s;ed, and could not &s;o ea&s;ily be quieted
at plea&s;ure. A lawyer in the city objecting the &s;tatute
of Richard the third, by which benevolences were for
ever aboli&s;hed, it was replied by the court, that Richard
being an u&s;urper, and his parliaments factious a&s;&s;emblies,
his &s;tatutes could not bind a lawful and <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> monarch,
who held his crown by hereditary right, and needed not
to court the favour of a licentious populace<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall.</NOTE>. The
judges even went &s;o far as to affirm po&s;itively, that the
King might exact by commi&s;&s;ion any &s;um which he
plea&s;ed; and the privy council gave a ready a&s;&s;ent to
this decree, which annihilated the mo&s;t valuable privi|lege
of the people, and rendered all their other privileges
precarious. Armed with &s;uch formidable authority, of
royal prerogative and a pretence of law, Wol&s;ey &s;ent
for the mayor of London, and de&s;ired to know what he
was willing to give for the &s;upply of his maje&s;ty's nece&s;|&s;ities.
The mayor &s;eemed de&s;irous, before he &s;hould
declare him&s;elf, to con&s;ult the common council; but the
cardinal required, that he and all the aldermen &s;hould
&s;eparately confer with him&s;elf about the benevolence;
and he eluded by that means the danger of a formed op|position.
Matters, however, went not &s;o &s;moothly in
the country. An in&s;urrection was begun in &s;ome places;
but as the people were not headed by any con&s;iderable
per&s;on, it was ea&s;y for the duke of Suffolk, and the earl
of Surrey, now duke of Norfolk, by employing per&s;ua&s;ion
<PB N="69" REF="79">
and authority, to induce the ringleaders to lay down
their arms, and &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners. The
King, finding it dangerous to puni&s;h criminals, engaged
in &s;o popular a cau&s;e, was determined, notwith&s;tanding
his violent, imperious temper, to grant them a general
pardon; and he very prudently imputed their guilt, not
to their want of loyalty or affection, but to their po|verty.
The offenders were brought before the &s;tar|chamber;
where, after a &s;evere charge laid again&s;t them
by the King's council, the cardinal &s;aid, &startq;That, not|with&s;tanding
their grievous offences, the King, in
con&s;ideration of their nece&s;&s;ities, had granted them
his gracious pardon, upon condition, that they would
give in &s;ureties for their future good behaviour.&endq; But
they replying, that they had no &s;ureties, the cardinal
fir&s;t, and after him the duke of Norfolk, &s;aid, that they
would &s;tand bound for them. Upon which they were
di&s;charged<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall. Stowe, 525. Holling&s;hed, p. 891.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE arbitrary impo&s;itions, being generally imputed
to the cardinal's coun&s;els, increa&s;ed the general odium,
under which he laboured; and the clemency of the par|don,
being a&s;cribed to the King, was con&s;idered as an
atonement on his part for the illegality of the mea&s;ure.
But Wol&s;ey, &s;upported both by royal and papal autho|rity,
proceeded, without &s;cruple, to violate all eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
privileges, which, during that age, were much
more &s;acred than civil; and having once prevailed in that
unu&s;ual attempt of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;ome mona&s;teries, he kept
all the re&s;t in awe, and exerci&s;ed over them the mo&s;t
arbitrary juri&s;diction. By his commi&s;&s;ion as legate, he
was impowered to vi&s;it them, and reform them, and
cha&s;ti&s;e their irregularities; and he employed his u&s;ual
agent, Allen, in the exerci&s;e of this authority. The
<PB N="70" REF="80">
religious hou&s;es were obliged to compound for their
guilt, real or pretended, by giving large &s;ums to the car|dinal
or his deputy; and this oppre&s;&s;ion was carried &s;o
far, that it reached at la&s;t the King's ears, which were
not commonly open to complaints again&s;t his favourite.
He reproved. Wol&s;ey in &s;evere terms, which rendered
him, if not more innocent, at lea&s;t more cautious for
the future. That haughty mini&s;ter had built a &s;plendid
palace at Hampton-court, which he probably intended,
as well as that of York-place in We&s;tmin&s;ter, for his own
u&s;e; but fearing the increa&s;e of envy on account of this
magnificence, and de&s;irous to appea&s;e the King, he
made him a pre&s;ent of that building, and told him,
that, from the fir&s;t, he had erected it for his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE ab&s;olute authority, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the King, render|ed
his dome&s;tic government, both over his people and
his mini&s;ters, ea&s;y and expeditious: The conduct of
foreign affairs alone required effort and application; and
they were now brought to &s;uch a &s;ituation, that it was
no longer &s;afe for England to be entirely neutral. The
$eigned moderation of the emperor was of very &s;hort
date; and it was &s;oon obvious to all the world, that his
great dominions, far from gratifying his ambition, were
only regarded as the means of acquiring an empire more
exten&s;ive. The terms, propo&s;ed by him to his pri&s;oner,
were &s;uch as mu&s;t have for ever annihilated the power
of France, and de&s;troyed the balance of Europe. He
required, that that monarch &s;hould re&s;tore to him the
dutchy of Burgundy, u&s;urped, as he pretended, by Lewis
the eleventh upon his ance&s;tors; that he &s;hould yield
Provence and Dauphiny to the duke of Bourbon, to be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him in full &s;overeignty, without fief or ho|mage
to the crown of France; that he &s;hould &s;atisfy the
King of England with regard to the provinces, which
that prince claimed as his inheritance; and that he
<PB N="71" REF="81">
&s;hould renounce all title to Naples, Milan, Genoa, or
any territory in Italy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE demands were propo&s;ed to Francis, &s;oon after
the battle of Pavia, while he was detained in Pizzighi|tone;
and as he had hitherto tru&s;ted &s;omewhat to the
emperor's genero&s;ity, the di&s;appointment excited in his
brea&s;t the mo&s;t lively indignation. He &s;aid, that he
would rather live and die a pri&s;oner than agree to di&s;|member
his kingdom; and that, even were he &s;o ba&s;e as
to &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms, his &s;ubjects would never permit
him to carry them into execution. The offers which
he made for obtaining his liberty, were, that he would
renounce all claims in Italy, that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t the
emperor in recovering the territories u&s;urped upon the
empire by the Venetians, that he would relinqui&s;h the
homage due by the emperor for Artois and Flanders,
that he would marry Eleonora, the emperor's &s;i&s;ter, (for
he was now a widower) and acknowledge the dutchy of
Burgundy to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as her dowry; and to be in|herited
by her children<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">De Vera hi&s;t. de Charles V.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FRANCIS was encouraged to per&s;i&s;t in the&s;e efforts, by
the favourable accounts, which he heard of Henry's di&s;|po&s;itions
towards him, and of the alarms which had
&s;eized all the chief powers in Italy, upon his defeat and
captivity. He was unea&s;y, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Francis re|moved to Madrid.</NOTE> to be &s;o far di&s;tant
from the emperor with whom he mu&s;t treat; and he
de&s;ired to be removed to Madrid, in hopes that a per&s;onal
interview would operate much in his favour, and that
Charles, if not influenced by his mini&s;ters, might be
found po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame frankne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, by
which he him&s;elf was di&s;tingui&s;hed. He was &s;oon con|vinced
of his mi&s;take. The emperor, under pretence of
an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates at Toledo, kept, during &s;ome
<PB N="72" REF="82">
time, at a di&s;tance from him; and even after they broke
delayed his vi&s;it to the captive King; feigning a
delicacy In that particular, as if his company, in the
pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, before any terms were agreed
on, would be regarded as an in&s;ult upon the royal pri|&s;oner.
Francis, partly from want of exerci&s;e, partly
from reflections on his pre&s;ent melancholy &s;ituation, fell
into a langui&s;hing illne&s;s; which begot apprehen&s;ions in
Charles, left the death of his captive &s;hould bereave him
of all tho&s;e advantages, which he propo&s;ed to extort
from him. He then paid him a vi&s;it in the ca&s;tle of
Madrid; and as he approached the bed in which Francis
was laid, the &s;ick monarch called to him, &startq;You come,
Sir, to vi&s;it your pri&s;oner.&endq; &startq;No,&endq; replied the
emperor, &startq;I come to vi&s;it my brother, and my friend,
who &s;hall &s;oon obtain his liberty.&endq; He &s;oothed his
affliction with many &s;peeches of a like nature, which
had &s;o good an effect, that the King daily recovered<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Herbert. De Vera, Sandoval.</NOTE>;
and thenceforth employed him&s;elf in concerting with
the mini&s;ters of the emperor, the terms of this treaty.</P>
<P>WHILE this negociation advanced &s;lowly, fortune
threw into the emperor's hands a new opportunity of
aggrandizing his dominions in Italy. Francis Sforza,
impatient that his inve&s;titure of Milan &s;hould &s;o long be
delayed, and that even after it was granted, it &s;hould be
encumbered with many exorbitant conditions, had en|deavoured
to &s;educe Pe&s;cara, the imperial general, from
his fidelity, and to engage him in a con&s;piracy again&s;t
his ma&s;ter. Pe&s;cara feigned to enter into the de&s;ign;
but having revealed the whole contrivance, he received
orders to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Milane&s;e; and Charles
made no &s;ecret of his intention to try Sforza and forfeit
his fief, on account of the trea&s;on, which he had com|mitted
<PB N="73" REF="83">
again&s;t his liege-lord and &s;overeign<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>. This inci|dent
retained the Italian powers in clo&s;er union with
France; and the emperor, by gra&s;ping too much, found
him&s;elf in danger of lo&s;ing all his advantages. His ap|prehen&s;ions
were encrea&s;ed, when he heard, that Francis
had &s;ent a re&s;ignation of his crown to the regent, and
had de&s;ired that the dauphin might be crowned King;
orders, which, though they were not obeyed, &s;hewed his
determined re&s;olution never to &s;ubmit to the unrea&s;onable
terms required of him. The chief difficulty of the
treaty was now reduced to the dutchy of Burgundy; and
even that territory, Francis had agreed to yield, but he
&s;till in&s;i&s;ted on fir&s;t recovering his liberty. All mutual
confidence was lo&s;t between the two princes; and each
feared, le&s;t advantage &s;hould be taken of his &s;implicity,
&s;hould he fir&s;t execute his part of the treaty.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t the emperor was willing to relax of his ri|gour
in this particular;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1526. 14 January.</NOTE> and the treaty of Madrid was
&s;igned, by which, it was hoped, an end would be finally
put to the differences between the&s;e great monarchs. The
principal condition was the re&s;toring of Francis's liberty,
and the delivery of his two elde&s;t &s;ons as ho&s;tages to the
emperor for the re&s;titution of Burgundy: If any difficulty
&s;hould afterwards occur in the execution of this article,
with regard to Burgundy, from the oppo&s;ition of the
&s;tates, either of France or of that province, Francis &s;ti|pulated,
that in &s;ix weeks time, he &s;hould return to his
pri&s;on, and remain there till the full performance of the
treaty. There were many other articles in this famous
convention, all of them rigorous and &s;evere to the la&s;t
degree again&s;t the captive monarch; and Charles di&s;|covered
evidently his intention of reducing Italy, as well
as France, to &s;ubjection and dependance.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="84">
MANY of Charles's mini&s;ters fore&s;aw, that Francis,
however &s;olemn the oaths, promi&s;es, and prote&s;tations
exacted of him, never would execute a treaty, which was
&s;o di&s;advantageous, or rather ruinous and de&s;tructive, to
him&s;elf, his po&s;terity, and his country. By putting Bur|gundy
into the emperor's hands, he gave his powerful
enemy an entrance into the heart of the kingdom: By
Sacrificing his allies in Italy, he deprived him&s;elf of all
foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and arming his oppre&s;&s;or with the
whole force and wealth of that opulent country, ren|dered
him ab&s;olutely irre&s;i&s;table. To the&s;e great views
of intere&s;t, were added the motives, no le&s;s cogent, of
pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment; while Francis, a prince, who,
piqued him&s;elf on genero&s;ity, reflected on the rigour with
which he had been treated during his captivity, and the
cruel terms which had been exacted of him for the re|covery
of his freedom. It was al&s;o fore&s;een, that ths
emulation and rival&s;hip, which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween
the&s;e two monarchs, would make him feel the
&s;tronge&s;t reluctance on yielding the &s;uperiority to an an|tagoni&s;t, wlio, by the whole tenor of his conduct, he
would be apt to think, had &s;hown him&s;elf &s;o little wor|thy
of that advantage, which fortune, and fortune alone,
had put into his hands. His mini&s;ters, his friends, his
&s;ubjects, his allies, with one voice, would be &s;ure to
&s;ugge&s;t to him, that the fir&s;t object of a prince, was the
pre&s;ervation of his people; and that the laws of honour,
which with a private man ought to be ab&s;olutely &s;u|preme,
and &s;uperior to all intere&s;ts, were with a &s;overeign
&s;ubordinate to the great duty of en&s;uring the &s;afety of his
country. Nor could it be imagined, that Francis would
be &s;o romantic in his principles, as not to hearken to a
ca&s;ui&s;try, which was &s;o plau&s;ible in it&s;elf, and which &s;o
much, flattered all the pa&s;&s;ions, by which, both as a
prince and a man, he was &s;trongly actuated.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="85">
SUCH was the rea&s;oning of &s;everal of Charles's mini&s;|ters,
particularly of Gattinara, his chancellor<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 16.</NOTE>, who
coun&s;elled him to treat Francis with more genero&s;ity,
and to give him his liberty on &s;uch terms, as would en|gage
him, not by the feeble band of treaties, but by the
more forcible tye of honour, to a &s;trict and faithful per|formance.
But the emperor's avidity prevented him from
following this wi&s;er and more honourable council; at
the &s;ame time, that the pro&s;pect of a general combina|tion
of Europe hindered him from detaining Francis in
captivity, and taking advantage of the confu&s;ions, which
his ab&s;ence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion in his kingdom.
Still &s;u&s;picious, however, of the &s;incerity of his pri&s;oner,
he took an opportunity, before they parted, of a&s;king
him, privately and as a friend, whether he &s;eriou&s;ly in|tended
to execute the treaty of Madrid; prote&s;ting, that,
in all ca&s;es, he was firmly determined to re&s;tore him to
his liberty, and that the pro&s;pect of obtaining this ad|vantage
needed no longer engage him to di&s;&s;emble.
Francis was too well acquainted with Charles's charac|ter
to tru&s;t to the &s;incerity of this prote&s;tation; and
therefore renewed his a&s;&s;urances of fidelity, and a &s;trict
ob&s;ervance of his word. The emperor replied, that
Francis was now his be&s;t friend and ally; but if he
&s;hould afterwards break his engagements, which he could
not &s;u&s;pect, he &s;hould think him&s;elf entitled to reproach
him with a condudt &s;o ba&s;e and unworthy: And on
the&s;e terms the two monarchs parted.</P>

&s;uffered violation in the arms of their parents, and upon

Aged prelates, after enduring every indignity, and even
every torture, were thrown into dungeons, and menaced
each moment with the mo&s;t cruel death, in order to en|gage
them to reveal their &s;ecret trea&s;ures, or purcha&s;e

had tru&s;ted for protection to the &s;acredne&s;s of his cha|racter,
and neglected to make his e&s;cape in time, was
taken captive, and found that his dignity, which pro|cured

draw on him the in&s;olent mockery of the German, who,

gro&s;s, is able, when &s;econded by authority, to im|po&s;e
upon the people, he ordered prayers, during &s;everal
months, to be put up in all the churches for the Pope's
liberty; an event, which, all men knew, a letter under
his hand could in a moment have procured.</P>
<P>THE concern, expre&s;&s;ed by Henry and Francis for
the calamity of their ally, was much more &s;incere.
The&s;e two monarchs, a few days before the &s;ack of
Rome, had concluded a treaty<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">30th April.</NOTE> at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in
which, be&s;ides renewing former alliances, they agreed
to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Charles, requiring him to accept
of two millions of crowns as the ran&s;om of the
French princes, and to repay the money, borrowed of
Henry; and in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, the amba&s;&s;adors, attended
with heralds, were ordered to denounce war again&s;t him.
This war, it was agreed to pro&s;ecute in the Low Coun|tries,
with an army of thirty thou&s;and infantry and fif|teen
hundred men at arms, two thirds to be &s;upplied by
Francis, the re&s;t by Henry. And in order to &s;trengthen
the alliance between the princes, it was &s;tipulated, that
either Francis or his &s;on, the duke of Orleans, as &s;hould
afterwards be agreed on, &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s
Mary, Henry's daughter. No &s;ooner did the monarchs
receive intelligence of Bourbon's enterprize, than they
changed, by a new treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> the &s;cene of the projected war
from the Netherlands to Italy; and hearing of the pope's
captivity, they were farther &s;timulated to undertake the
war with vigour for the re&s;toring his liberty. Wol&s;ey
him&s;elf cro&s;&s;ed the &s;eas, in order to have an interview
with Francis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th July.</NOTE> and to concert mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e;
and he di&s;played all that grandeur and magnificence,
with which he was &s;o much intoxicated. He was attend|ed
with a train, of a thou&s;and hor&s;e. The cardinal of
<PB N="80" REF="88">
Lorraine, and the chancellor Alan&ccedil;on, met him at Bou|logne:
Francis him&s;elf, be&s;ides granting to that haughty
prelate the power of giving in every place, where he came,
liberty to all pri&s;oners, made a journey as far as Amiens
to meet him, and even advanced &s;ome miles from the
town, the more to honour his reception. It was here
&s;tipulated, that the duke of Orleans &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the
prince&s;s Mary; and as the emperor &s;eemed to be taking
&s;ome &s;teps towards a&s;&s;embling a general council, the two
monarchs agreed not to acknowledge it, but, during the
interval of the pope's captivity, to govern the churches in
their dominions, each by his own authority. Wol&s;ey
made &s;ome attempts to get his legatine power extended
into France, and even into Germany; but finding his
efforts fruitle&s;s, he was obliged, tho' with great reluc|tance,
to de&s;i&s;t from the&s;e ambitious enterprizes<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, book 3. coll. 12, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE more to cement the union, between the&s;e princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Sept.</NOTE>
a new treaty was, &s;ome time after, concluded at London;
in which Henry agreed to renounce for ever all claims to
the crown of France; claims, which might now indeed
be deemed chimerical, but which often &s;erved as a pre|tence
for exciting the unwary Engli&s;h to wage war upon
the French monarchy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">League with France.</NOTE> As a return for this conce&s;&s;ion,
Francis bound him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to pay for ever
fifty thou&s;and crowns a year to Henry and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors;
and that a greater &s;olemnity might be given to this treaty,
it was agreed, that the Parliaments and great nobility of
both kingdoms &s;hould give their con&s;ent to it. The
mare&s;chal Montmorency, accompanied with many per|&s;ons
of di&s;tinction, and attended by a pompous equipage,
was &s;ent over to ratify the treaty; and was received at
London with all the parade, which &s;uited the &s;olemnity
of the occa&s;ion. The terror of the emperor's greatne&s;s
had entirely extingui&s;hed the antient animo&s;ity between
<PB N="81" REF="89">
the nations; and Spain, during more than a century,
became, tho' a more di&s;tant power, the chief object of
jealou&s;y to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>THIS appearance of a cordial union between France
and England, tho' it added influence to the joint emba&s;&s;y
which they &s;ent to the emperor, was not able to bend
that ambitious monarch to &s;ubmit entirely to the condi|tions
in&s;i&s;ted on by the allies. He departed indeed from
his demand of Burgundy as the ran&s;om of the French
princes; but: he required, previou&s;ly to their recovery of
liberty, that Francis &s;hould evacuate Genoa, and all the
fortre&s;&s;es held by him in Italy: And he declared his in|tention
of bringing Sforza to a trial, and confi&s;cating
the dutchy of Milan, on account of his pretended trea&s;on.
The English and French heralds, therefore, according
to agreement, declared war again&s;t him, and &s;et him at
defiance. Charles an&s;wered the Engli&s;h herald with mo|deration;
but to the French, he reproached his ma&s;ter
with breach of faith, reminded him of the private conver|&s;ation
which had pa&s;&s;ed between them at Madrid before
their &s;eparation, and offered to prove by &s;ingle combat,
that that monarch had acted di&s;honourably. Francis re|taliated
this challenge by giving Charles the lie; and,
after demanding &s;ecurity of the field, he offered to main|tain
his cau&s;e by &s;ingle combat. Many me&s;&s;ages pa&s;&s;ed
to and fro between them; but tho' both the princes were
undoubtedly brave, the intended duel never took place.
The French and Spaniards, during that age, di&s;puted
zealou&s;ly which of the monarchs incurred the blame of
this failure; but all men of moderation every where la|mented
the power of fortune, that the prince the more
candid, generous, and &s;incere, &s;hould, by unhappy in|cidents,
have been reduced to that cruel &s;ituation, that
nothing but the breach of his word could pre&s;erve his
people, and that he mu&s;t ever after, without being able
<PB N="82" REF="90">
to make a proper reply, bear to be reproached with this
infidelity by a rival, inferior to him both in honour and
in virtue.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this famous challenge between Charles and
Francis had no immediate con&s;equences with regard to
the&s;e monarchs them&s;elves, it produced a con&s;iderable
alteration on the manners of the age. The practice of
challenges and duels, which had been part of the antient
barbarous juri&s;prudence, which was &s;till pre&s;erved on very
&s;olemn occa&s;ions, and which was even countenanced by
the civil magi&s;trate, began thenceforth to prevail on the
mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions; and men, on any affront or inju|ry,
thought them&s;elves entitled, or even required in ho|nour,
to take private revenges on their enemies, by vin|dicating
their right in &s;ingle combat. The&s;e ab&s;urd, tho'
generous maxims, &s;hed much of the be&s;t blood in chri&s;|tendom
during more than two centuries; and notwith|&s;tanding the &s;everity of law, &s;uch Is the prevailing force
of cu&s;tom, they are far from being as yet entirely ex|ploded.</P>

his brother's widow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scruples concerning the King's marriage.</NOTE> had not pa&s;&s;ed, without much &s;cru|ple
and difficulty. The prejudices of the people were in
general bent again&s;t a conjugal union, between &s;uch near
relations; and the late King, tho' he had &s;olermized the
e&s;pou&s;als, when his &s;on was but twelve years of age,
gave evident proofs of his intention to take afterwards a
proper opportunity of annulling them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mori&s;on's Apomaxis, p. 13.</NOTE>. He ordered the
young prince, &s;o &s;oon as he came of age, to enter a pro|te&s;tation again&s;t the marriage<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mori&s;on, p. 13. Heylin's Queen Mary, p. 2.</NOTE>; and on his death-bed he
charged him, as his la&s;t injunction, not to fini&s;h an al|liance,
&s;o unu&s;ual and expo&s;ed to &s;uch in&s;uperable objec|tions.
After the King's acce&s;&s;ion, &s;ome members of the
Privy Council, particularly Warham, the primate, open|ly
declared again&s;t the re&s;olution, of compleating the
<PB N="84" REF="92">
marriage; and tho' Henry's youth and di&s;&s;ipation kept
him, during &s;ome times from entertaining any &s;cruples
with regard to the mea&s;ure which he had embraced,
there happened incidents, &s;ufficient to rouze his atten|tion,
and to inform him of the &s;entiments, generally e|ntertained
on that &s;ubject. The &s;tates of Ca&s;tile had op|po&s;ed
the emperor Charles's e&s;pou&s;als with Mary, Henry's
daughter; and among other objections, had in&s;i&s;ted on
the illegitimate birth of the young prince&s;s<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, Fiddes's life of Wol&s;ey.</NOTE>. And when
the negotiations were afterwards opened with France,
and mention was made of betrothing her to Francis or
the duke of Orleans, the bi&s;hop of Tarbe, the French
amba&s;&s;ador, revived the &s;ame objection<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. 192, 203. Heylin, p. 3.</NOTE>. But tho' the&s;e
events naturally rai&s;ed &s;ome doubts in Henry's mind,
there concurred other cau&s;es, which tended much to for|tify
his remor&s;e, and render his con&s;cience more &s;cru|pulous.</P>
<P>THE queen was older than the King by no le&s;s than
&s;ix years;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King enters into the&s;e &s;cru|ples.</NOTE> and the decay of her beauty, together with
particular infirmities and di&s;ea&s;es, had contributed, not|with&s;tanding her blamele&s;s character and deportment, to
render her per&s;on unacceptable to him. Tho' &s;he had
borne him &s;everal children, they all died in early infancy,
except one daughter; and he was the more &s;truck with
this misfortune, becau&s;e the cur&s;e of being childle&s;s is the
very threatening, contained in the Mo&s;aical law again&s;t
tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e their brother's widow. The King
was actuated by a &s;trong de&s;ire of having male i&s;&s;ue:
With a view to that end, it is believed, more than from
de&s;ire towards other gratification, he had, a few years
before this period, made addre&s;&s;es to a young lady, Ca|therine,
daughter of Sir John Blount; and when &s;he
<PB N="85" REF="93">
bore him a &s;on, he expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, and
immediately created him duke of Richmond. The &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the crown too was a con&s;ideration, that oc|curred
to every one, whenever the lawfulne&s;s of Henry's
marriage was que&s;tioned; and it was apprehended, that,
if doubts of Mary's legitimacy concurred with the weak|ne&s;s
of her &s;ex, the King of Scots, the next heir, would
certainly advance his own preten&s;ions, and might throw
the kingdom into confu&s;ion. The evils, as yet recent,
of civil wars and convul&s;ions, ari&s;ing from a di&s;puted
title, made great impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of men, and
rendered the people univer&s;ally de&s;irous of any event,
which might obviate &s;o irreparable a calamity. And the
King was thus impelled, both by his private pa&s;&s;ions,
and by motives of public intere&s;t, to &s;eek the di&s;&s;olution
of his inau&s;picious, and, as it was e&s;teemed, unlawful
marriage with Catherine.</P>
<P>HENRY afterwards affirmed, that his &s;cruples of con|&s;cience
aro&s;e entirely from private reflection; and that
on con&s;ulting his confe&s;&s;or, the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, he
found that prelate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame doubts and dif|ficulties.
The King him&s;elf, being &s;o great a ca&s;ui&s;t
and divine, proceeded then to examine the que&s;tion more
carefully by his own learning and &s;tudy; and having had
recour&s;e to Thomas of Aquine, he ob&s;erved that this ce|lebrated
doctor, who&s;e authority was great in the church
and ab&s;olute with him, had treated of that very ca&s;e, and
had expre&s;sly declared again&s;t the lawfulness of &s;uch mar|riages<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Fiddes.</NOTE>. The prohibitions, &s;aid Thomas, contained in
Leviticus, and among the re&s;t, that of marrying a bro|ther's
widow, are moral, eternal, and founded on a di|vine

rules of the church, the laws of God cannot be fet a&s;ide

partly de&s;irous of connecting the King more
clo&s;ely with Francis, by marrying him to the dutche&s;s of
Alen&ccedil;on, &s;i&s;ter to that monarch; and perhaps too &s;ome|what
di&s;gu&s;ted with the queen her&s;elf, who had reproved
him for certain freedoms, unbefitting his character and
&s;tation<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 38. Strype, vol. i. p. 88.</NOTE>. But Henry was carried forward, tho' perhaps
not at fir&s;t excited, by a motive more forcible than even
the &s;ugge&s;tions of that powerful favourite.</P>
<P>ANNE Boleyn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anne Bo|leyn.</NOTE> who lately appeared at court, had been
created maid of honour to the queen; and having had
frequent opportunities of being &s;een by the King, and of
conver&s;ing with him, &s;he had acquired an entire a&s;cendant
over his affections. This young lady, who&s;e grandeur and
misfortunes have rendered her &s;o celebrated, was daugh|ter
to Sir Thomas Boleyn, who had been employed by
the King in &s;eveval emba&s;&s;ies, and who was allied to all
the principal nobility of the kingdom. His wife, mother
to Anne, was daughter of the duke of Norfolk; his own
mother was daughter of the earl of Ormond; his grand|father
Sir Geoffry Boleyn, who had been mayor of Lon|don,
had e&s;pou&s;ed one of the daughters and co-heirs of
the lord Ha&s;tings<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Camden's preface to the life of Elizabeth. Burnet, vol, i. p. 44.</NOTE>. Anne her&s;elf, tho' then in very early
youth, had been carried over to Paris by the King's
&s;i&s;ter, when &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed Lewis the twelfth of France;
<PB N="87" REF="95">
and upon the decea&s;e of that monarch, and the return of
his dowager into England, Anne, who&s;e accompli&s;h|ments
even in her tender years were always much ad|mired,
was retained in the &s;ervice of Claude, queen of
France, &s;pou&s;e to Francis; and after her death, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
into the family of the dutche&s;s of Alen&ccedil;on, a prince&s;s of
&s;ingular merit. The exact time, when &s;he returned to
England, is not certainly known; but it was after the
King had entertained doubts with regard to the lawful|ne&s;s
of his marriage with Catherine; if the account is
to be credited, which he him&s;elf afterwards gave of that
tran&s;action. Henry's &s;cruples had made him break off all
conjugal commerce with the queen; but as he &s;till &s;up|ported
an intercour&s;e of civility and friendship with her,
he had occa&s;ion, in the vi&s;its, which he paid her, to ob|&s;erve the beauty, the youth, the charms of Anne Boleyn.
Finding the accompli&s;hments of her mind nowi&s;e inferior
to her exterior graces, he even entertained the de&s;ign of
rai&s;ing her to the throne; and was the more confirmed
in this re&s;olution, when he found that her virtue and mo|de&s;ty
prevented all hopes of gratifying his pa&s;&s;ion after
any other manner. And as every motive of inclination
and policy, &s;eemed thus to concur in making the King
de&s;irous of a divorce from Catherine, and as his pro&s;pect
of &s;ucce&s;s was inviting, he re&s;olved to make applications
to Clement, and he &s;ent Knight, his &s;ecretary, to Rome
for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT he might not &s;hock the haughty claims of the
pontiff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry ap|plies to the pope for a divorce.</NOTE> it was re&s;olved not to found the application on
any general doubts of the papal power to permit marriage
in the nearer degrees of con&s;anguinity; but only to in&s;i&s;t
on particular grounds of invalidity in the bull, which
Julius had granted for the marriage of Henry and Cathe|rine.
It was a maxim in the court of Rome, that, if
the pope be &s;urprized into any conce&s;&s;ion, or grant any
<PB N="88" REF="96">
indulgence upon fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, the bull may after|wards
be annulled; and this pretence had u&s;ually been
employed, wherever one pope had recalled any deed,
executed by any of his predece&s;&s;ors. But Julius's bull,
when examined, afforded plentiful matter of this kind;
and any tribunal, favourable to Henry, needed not want
a &s;pecious colour for gratifying him in his applications
for a divorce. It was &s;aid in the preamble, that the bull
had been granted upon his &s;olicitation; tho' it was
known, that, at that time, he was below twelve years of
age: It was al&s;o affirmed, as another motive for the
bull, that the marriage was requi&s;ite, in order to pre&s;erve
peace between the two crowns; tho' it is certain, that
there was not then any ground or appearance of quarrel
between them. The&s;e fal&s;e premi&s;es in Julius's bull,
&s;eemed to afford Clement, a &s;ufficient rea&s;on or pretence
for annulling it, and granting Henry a di&s;pen&s;ation for a
&s;econd marriage<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Collier, Eccle&s;. Hi&s;t. vol. ii. p. 25. from the Cott. Lib. Vitell.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho'<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pope favourable.</NOTE> the pretext for this indulgence had been le&s;s
plau&s;ible, the pope was in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that he had
the &s;tronge&s;t motive to embrace every opportunity of gra|tifying
the Engli&s;h monarch. He was then a pri&s;oner
in the hands of the emperor, and had no hopes of reco|vering
his liberty on any rea&s;onable terms, unle&s;s by the
efforts of the league, which Henry had formed with
Francis and the Italian powers, in order to oppo&s;e the
exorbitant ambition of Charles. When the Engli&s;h Se|cretary,
therefore, made private applications to him, he
received a very favourable an&s;wer; and a di&s;pen&s;ation
was forthwith promi&s;ed to be expedited to his ma&s;ter<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 47.</NOTE>.
Soon after, the march of a French army into Italy, under
the command of Lautrec, obliged the imperiali&s;ts to give
Clement his liberty; and he retired to Orvietto, where
<PB N="89" REF="97">
the Secretary, with Sir Gregory Ca&s;&s;ali, the King's re|&s;ident
at Rome, renewed their applications to him.
They found him &s;till full of high profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip,
gratitude, and attachment to the King; but not &s;o ex|peditious
in granting his reque&s;t as they expected. The
emperor, who had got intelligence of Henry's application
to Rome, had exacted a promi&s;e of the pope, to take no
&s;teps in that affair before he communicated them to the
imperial mini&s;ters; and Clement, confined by this pro|mi&s;e,
and &s;till more overawed by the emperor's forces in
Italy, &s;eemed willing to po&s;tpone tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions de|&s;ired
of him by Henry. Importuned, however, by the
Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, he at la&s;t put into their hands a <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ion</HI>
to Wol&s;ey, as legate, in conjunction with the
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, or any other Engli&s;h prelate,
to examine the validity of the King's marriage, and of
Julius's di&s;pen&s;ation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. 237.</NOTE>: He al&s;o granted them a provi|&s;ional
<HI>di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> for the King's marriage with any other
per&s;on; and promi&s;ed to expedite a <HI>decretal bull,</HI> annulling
the marriage with Catherine. But he repre&s;ented to them
the dangerous con&s;equences, which mu&s;t en&s;ue to him,
if the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions &s;hould come to the emperor's know|ledge;
and he conjured them not to publi&s;h tho&s;e papers,
or make any further u&s;e of them, till his affairs were in
&s;uch a &s;ituation as to &s;ecure his liberty and independance.
And his &s;ecret advice was, whenever they &s;hould find
the proper time of opening the &s;cene, that they &s;hould
prevent all oppo&s;ition, by proceeding immediately to a
conclu&s;ion, by declaring the marriage with Catherine in|valid,
and by Henry's in&s;tantly e&s;pou&s;ing &s;ome other per|&s;on.
Nor would it be &s;o difficult, he &s;aid, for him&s;elf to
confirm the&s;e proceedings, after they were pa&s;&s;ed, as pre|viou&s;ly
to render them valid, by his con&s;ent and autho|rity<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Collier, from Cott. Lib. Vitell. B. 10.</NOTE>.</P>

WHEN Henry received the commi&s;&s;ion and di&s;pen&s;a|tion
from his amba&s;&s;adors, and was informed of the pope's
advice, he laid the whole matter before his mini&s;ters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1528.</NOTE>
and a&s;ked their opinion in &s;o delicate a &s;ituation. The
Engli&s;h coun&s;ellors con&s;idered the danger of proceeding
in the manner pointed out to them. Should the pope
refu&s;e to confirm a deed, which he might ju&s;tly call pre|cipitate
and irregular, and &s;hould he di&s;avow the advice
which he gave in &s;o clande&s;tine a manner, the King
would find his &s;econd marriage totally invalidated; any
children, which it might bring him, declared illegiti|mate;
and his marriage with Catherine more firmly ri|vetted
than ever<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 51.</NOTE>. And Henry's apprehen&s;ions of the
po&s;&s;ibility, or even probability, of &s;uch an event, were
much confirmed, when he reflected on the character and &s;ituation of the &s;overeign pontiff.</P>
<P>CLEMENT the &s;eventh was a prince of excellent judg|ment,

by entering into a league again&s;t Charles, had
&s;o affected his imagination, that he never afterwards ex|erted
him&s;elf with vigour in any public mea&s;ures, e&s;pe|cially
if the intere&s;ts or inclinations of that potentate
&s;tood in oppo&s;ition to him. The imperial forces were,
at pre&s;ent, powerful in Italy, and might return to the
attack of Rome, which was &s;till defencele&s;s, and expo&s;ed
to the &s;ame calamities with which it had already been
overwhelmed. And be&s;ides the&s;e dangers, Clement found
or fancied him&s;elf expo&s;ed to perils, which threatned,
&s;till more immediately, his per&s;on and dignity.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="99">
CHARLES, apprized of the timid di&s;po&s;ition of the
holy father, threw out perpetual menaces of &s;ummoning
a general council; which he repre&s;ented was nece&s;&s;ary
to reform the church, and correct tho&s;e enormous abu&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The empe|ror threat|ens him.</NOTE>
which the ambition and avarice of the court of Rome
had introduced into every branch of eccle&s;ia&s;tical admi|ni&s;tration.
The power of Clement him&s;elf, he &s;aid, the
&s;overeign pontiff, required limitation; his conduct called
aloud for amendment; and even his title to the throne,
which he filled, might ju&s;tly be brought in que&s;tion.
That pope had always pa&s;&s;ed for the natural &s;on of Julian
of Medicis, who was of the &s;overeign family of Flo|rence;
and tho' Leo the tenth, his cou&s;in, had declared
him legitimate, upon a pretended promi&s;e of marriage
between his father and mother, few per&s;ons believed that
declaration to be founded on any ju&s;t rea&s;on or autho|rity<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.
The canon law, indeed, had been entirely &s;ilent
with regard to the promotion of ba&s;tards to the papal
throne; but, what was &s;till dangerous, the people had
entertained a violent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that that &s;tain in the
birth of any per&s;on was &s;ufficient to incapacitate him for
&s;o holy an office. And in another point, the canon law
was expre&s;s and po&s;itive, that no man, guilty of &s;imony,
could attain that dignity. A &s;evere bull of Julius the
&s;econd had added new &s;anctions to this law, by declaring,
that a &s;imoniacal election &s;hould not be rendered valid,
even by a po&s;terior con&s;ent of the cardinals. But unfor|tunately
Clement had given to cardinal Colonna a billet,
containing promi&s;es of advancing that cardinal, in ca&s;e
he him&s;elf &s;hould attain the papal dignity by his concur|rence:
And this billet, Colonna, who was in entire de|pendance
on the emperor, threatened every moment to
expo&s;e to public view<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="100">
WHILE Charles terrified the pope with the&s;e menaces,
he al&s;o allured him by hopes, which were no le&s;s preva|lent
over his affections. At the time when the emperor's
forces &s;acked Rome, and reduced Clement to captivity,
the Florentines, pa&s;&s;ionate for their ancient liberty, had
taken advantage of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and revolting again&s;t
the family of Medicis, had entirely aboli&s;hed their autho|rity
in Florence, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the former demo|cracy.
The better to protect them&s;elves in their freedom,
they had entered into the alliance with France, England,
and Venice, again&s;t the emperor; and Clement found,
that, by this intere&s;t, the hands of his confederates were
tied from a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in the re&s;toration of his family;
the event, which, of all others, he mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately de|&s;ired. The emperor alone, he knew, was able to effect|tuate
this purpo&s;e; and therefore, whatever profe&s;&s;ions he
made of fidelity to his allies, he was always, on the lea&s;t
glimp&s;e of hope, ready to embrace every propo&s;al of a
cordial reconcilement with that monarch<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Father Paul.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE views and intere&s;ts of the pope were well
known in England; and as the oppo&s;ition of the emperor
was fore&s;een to Henry's divorce, both on account of the
honour and intere&s;ts of Catherine, his aunt, and the ob|vious
motive of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing an enemy, it was e&s;teemed
dangerous to take any mea&s;ure of con&s;equence, in expec|tation
of the &s;ub&s;equent concurrence of a man of Cle|ment's
character, who&s;e behaviour contained always &s;o
much duplicity, and who was at pre&s;ent &s;o little at his
own di&s;po&s;al. The &s;afe&s;t mea&s;ure &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t in
previou&s;ly engaging him &s;o far, that he could not after|wards
recede, and in making u&s;e of his pre&s;ent ambiguity
and uncertainty, to extort the mo&s;t important conce&s;|&s;ions
from him. For this purpo&s;e, Stephen Gardiner,
the cardinal's &s;ecretary, and Edward Fox, the King's
almoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Feb.</NOTE> were di&s;patched to Rome, and were ordered to
<PB N="93" REF="101">
&s;olicit a commi&s;&s;ion from the pope, of &s;uch a nature as
would oblige him to confirm the &s;entence of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners,

account, to recall the commi&s;&s;ion, or evoke the cau&s;e to
Rome<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert. Burnet, vol. i. p. 29. in the collect. Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 28. Strype, vol. i. p. 93. with App. N^o. 23, 24, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ame rea&s;on which made the King &s;o de&s;irous
of obtaining this conce&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pope's ambiguous conduct.</NOTE> confirmed the pope in the
re&s;olution of refu&s;ing it: He was &s;till determined to keep
the door open to an agreement with the emperor, and
made no &s;cruple of &s;acrificing all other con&s;iderations to a
point which he deemed, of all others, the mo&s;t important
to his own &s;ecurity, and to that of his family. He
granted, therefore, a new commi&s;&s;ion, in which cardinal
Campeggio was joined to Wol&s;ey, for the trial of the
King's marriage; but he could not be prevailed on to
in&s;ert the clau&s;es de&s;ired of him. And though he put
into Gardiner's hands a letter, promi&s;ing not to recall
the pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ion; this promi&s;e was found, on ex|amination,
to be couched in &s;uch ambiguous terms, as
left him &s;till the power, whenever he plea&s;ed, of depart|ing
from it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert, p. 221. Burnet, p. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CAMPEGGIO lay under &s;ome obligations to the King;
but his dependance on the pope was &s;o much greater,
that he conformed him&s;elf entirely to the views of his
holine&s;s; and tho' he received his commi&s;&s;ion in April,
he protracted his departure by &s;o many artificial delays,
that it was October before he arrived in England. The
fir&s;t &s;tep which he took, was to exhort the King to de&s;i&s;t
from the pro&s;ecution of his divorce; and finding that this
coun&s;el gave great offence, he &s;aid, that his intention
was al&s;o to exhort the queen to enter into a convent,
and that he thought it his duty, previou&s;ly to attempt an
amicable compo&s;ure of all differences<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 225.</NOTE>. The more to
<PB N="94" REF="102">
pacify the King, he &s;hewed to him, as al&s;o to the cardi|nal,
the decretal bull, annulling the former marriage
with Catherine; but no entreaties could prevail with him
to make any other of the King's council privy to the
&s;ecret<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 58.</NOTE>. In order to atone, in &s;ome degree, for this
ob&s;tinacy, he expre&s;&s;ed to the King and the cardinal, the
pope's great de&s;ire of &s;atisfying them in every rea&s;onable
demand; and in particular, he &s;howed, that their reque&s;t
for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;ome more mona&s;tries, and converting
them into cathedrals and bi&s;hops &s;ees, had obtained the
con&s;ent of his holine&s;s<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. p. 270. Strype, vol. i. p. 110, 111. Appen, N^o. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE ambiguous circum&s;tances in the behaviour of
the pope and the legate, kept the court of England in
&s;u&s;pence, and determined the King to wait with patience
the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch uncertain councils.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1529.</NOTE> Fortune meanwhile
&s;eemed to promi&s;e him a more &s;ure and expeditious way of
extricating him&s;elf from his pre&s;ent difficulties. Cle|ment
was &s;eized with a dangerous illne&s;s; and the in|trigues
for electing his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, began already to take
place among the cardinals. Wol&s;ey, in particular, &s;up|ported
by the intere&s;t of England and France, entertained
hopes of mounting the throne of St. Peter<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 63.</NOTE>; and it ap|pears,
that if a vacancy had then happened, there was a
probability of his reaching that &s;ummit of his ambition.
But the pope recovered his health, tho' after &s;everal re|lap&s;es;
and he returned to the &s;ame train of fal&s;e and
deceitful politics, by which he had hitherto amu&s;ed the
Engli&s;h court. He &s;till flattered Henry with profe&s;&s;ions
of the mo&s;t cordial attachment, and promi&s;ed him a &s;ud|den
and favourable i&s;&s;ue of his proce&s;s: He &s;till conti|nued
his &s;ecret negociations with Charles, and per&s;evered
in the re&s;olution of &s;acrificing all his promi&s;es, and all the
intere&s;ts of the Romi&s;h religion, to the elevation of his
<PB N="95" REF="103">
family. Campeggio, who was perfectly acquainted with
his views and intentions, protracted the deci&s;ion by the
mo&s;t artificial delays; and gave Clement full lei&s;ure to
adju&s;t all the terms of his treaty with the emperor.</P>
<P>THE emperor, acquainted with the King's extreme
earne&s;tne&s;s in this affair, was determined, that he &s;hould
obtain &s;ucce&s;s by no other means but by an application to
him, and by de&s;erting his alliance with Francis, which
had hitherto &s;upported, again&s;t the &s;uperior force of Spain,
the tottering &s;tate of the French monarchy. He willing|ly
hearkened, therefore, to the applications of Catherine,
his aunt; and promi&s;ing her his utmo&s;t protection, ex|horted
her never to yield to the malice and per&s;ecutions
of her enemies. The queen her&s;elf was naturally of a
firm and re&s;olute temper; and was engaged by every
motive to per&s;evere in prote&s;ting again&s;t the inju&s;tice to
which &s;he thought her&s;elf expo&s;ed. The imputation of
ince&s;t, which was thrown upon her marriage with Henry,
&s;truck her with the highe&s;t indignation: The illegiti|macy
of her daughter, which &s;eemed a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence,
gave her the mo&s;t ju&s;t concern: The reluctance
of yielding to a rival, who, &s;he believed, had &s;upplanted
her in the King's affections, was a very natural motive.
Actuated by all the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;he never cea&s;ed
&s;oliciting her nephew's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and earne&s;tly entreat|ing
an evocation of the cau&s;e to Rome, where alone, &s;he
thought, &s;he could expect ju&s;tice. And the emperor, in
all his negociations with the pope, made the recall of the
commi&s;&s;ion, which Campeggio and Wol&s;ey exerci&s;ed in
England, a fundamental article<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 225. Burnet, vol. i. p. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE two legates, meanwhile, opened their court at
London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31 May.</NOTE> and cited the King and Queen to appear before
it. They both pre&s;ented them&s;elves; and the King an|&s;wered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of the King's marriage.</NOTE> to his name, when called: But the Queen, in|&s;tead
<PB N="96" REF="104">
of an&s;wering to hers, ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and
throwing her&s;elf at the King's feet, made a very pathetic
harangue, which her virtue, her dignity, and her misfor|tunes,
rendered the more affecting. She told him, that
&s;he was a &s;tranger in his dominions, without protection,
without council, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; expo&s;ed to all the
inju&s;tice, which her enemies were plea&s;ed to impo&s;e upon
her: That &s;he had quitted her native country without
other re&s;ource, than her connexions with him and his
family, and had expected, that, in&s;tead of &s;uffering thence
any violence or iniquity, &s;he was a&s;&s;ur$d in them of a
&s;afeguard again&s;t every misfortune: That &s;he had been
his wife during twenty years, and would here appeal to
him&s;elf, whether her affectionate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will
had not merited other treatment, than to be thus, after
&s;o long a time, thrown from him with &s;o much indignity:
That &s;he was con&s;cious&mdash;h$ him&s;elf was a&s;&s;ured&mdash;that her
virgin honour was yet un&s;tained, when he received her
into his bed, and that her connections with his brother
had been carried no further than the ceremony of mar|riage:
That their parents, the Kings of England and
Spain, were e&s;teemed the wi&s;e&s;t princes of their time,
and had undoubtedly acted by the be&s;t advice, when they
formed the agreement for that marriage, which was now
repre&s;ented as &s;o criminal and unnatural: And that &s;he
acquie&s;ced in their judgment, and would not &s;ubmit her
cau&s;e to be tried by a $ourt, who&s;e dependance on her
enemies was too vi&s;ible, ever to allow her any hopes of
obtaining from them an equitable or impartial deci&s;ion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 73. Hall, Stowe, p. 543.</NOTE>.
Having &s;poken the&s;e words, &s;he ro&s;e, and making the
King a low reverence, &s;he departed from the court, and
never would again appear in it.</P>
<P>AFTER her departure, the King did her the ju&s;tice to
acknowledge, that &s;he had ever been a dutiful and affec|tionate
<PB N="97" REF="105">
wife, and that the whole tenor of her behaviour
had been conformable to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of probity and
honour. He only in&s;i&s;ted on his own &s;cruples, with re|gard
to the lawfulne&s;s of their marriage; and he explained
the origin, the progre&s;s, and the foundation of tho&s;e
doubts, by which he had been &s;o long and &s;o violently
agitated. He acquitted cardinal Wol&s;ey of having any
hand in encouraging his &s;cruples; and he begged a
&s;entence of the court, conformable to the ju&s;tice of his
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE legates, after citing the queen anew to appear
before them, declared her <HI>contumacious,</HI> notwith&s;tanding
her appeal to Rome; and then proceeded to the exami|nation
of the cau&s;e. The fir&s;t point which came before
them, was, the proof of prince Arthur's con&s;ummation
of his marriage with Catherine; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed,
that no &s;tronger arguments could rea&s;onably be expected
of &s;uch a fact after &s;o long an interval. The age of the
prince, who had pa&s;&s;ed his fifteenth year, the good &s;tate
of his health, the long time that he had cohabited with
his &s;pou&s;e, many of his expre&s;&s;ions to that very purpo&s;e;
all the&s;e circum&s;tances form a violent pre&s;umption, in
favour of the King's a&s;&s;ertion<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Henry him&s;elf, after
his brother's death, was not allowed for &s;ome time to
bear the title of prince of Wales, in expectation of her
pregnancy: The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, in order the better
to en&s;ure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her jointure, had &s;ent over to Spain,
proofs of the con&s;ummation of her marriage<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 35.</NOTE>: Julius's
bull it&s;elf was founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that Arthur

the court; accompanied with many rea&s;onings concerning
the extent of the pope's authority, and his power of
granting a di&s;pen&s;ation to marry within the prohibited
degrees. Campeggio heard the&s;e doctrines with great
impatience; and notwith&s;tanding his re&s;olution to pro|tract
the cau&s;e, he was often tempted to interrupt and
&s;ilence the King's council, when they in&s;i&s;ted on &s;uch
di&s;agreeable topics. The trial was &s;pun out till the 23d
of July; and Campeggio chiefly took on him the part of
conducting it. Wol&s;ey, tho' the elder cardinal, per|mitted
him to act as pre&s;ident of the court; becau&s;e it
was thought, that a trial, managed by an Italian cardi|nal,
would carry the appearance of greater candour and
impartiality, than if the King's own mini&s;ter and favou|rite
had pre&s;ided in it. The bu&s;ine&s;s now &s;eemed to be
drawing near to a period; and the King was every day
in expectation of a &s;entence in his favour; when, to his
great &s;urprize, Campeggio, on a &s;udden, without any
warning, and upon very frivolous pretences<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 76, 77.</NOTE>, prorogued
the court, till the fir&s;t of October. The evocation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cau&s;e evoked to Rome.</NOTE> which came a few days after from Rome, put an end to all
the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, which the King had &s;o long and &s;o
anxiou&s;ly cheri&s;hed<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 254.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the time, that the trial was carried on before
the legates at London, the emperor had by his mini&s;ters
earne&s;tly &s;olicited Clement to evoke the cau&s;e to Rome;
and had employed every topic of hope or terror, which
could operate either on the pa&s;&s;ion or timidity of the pon|tiff.
The Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, on the other hand, in
conjunction with the French, had been no le&s;s earne&s;t in
their applications, that the legates &s;hould be allowed to
fini&s;h the trial; but, tho' they employed the &s;ame engines
of promi&s;es and menaces, the objects, which they could
&s;et before the pope, were not &s;o in&s;tant nor immediate as
<PB N="99" REF="107">
tho&s;e which were held up to him by the emperor<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 75.</NOTE>. The
dread of lo&s;ing England, and of fortifying the Lutherans
by &s;o con&s;iderable an acce&s;&s;ion, made &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion on
Clement's mind, in compari&s;on of the anxiety for his
own per&s;onal &s;afety, and the fond de&s;ire of re&s;toring the
Medici to their dominion in Florence. So &s;oon, there|fore,
as he had adju&s;ted all terms with the emperor, he
laid hold of the pretence of ju&s;tice, which required him,
he &s;aid, to pay regard to the queen's appeal; and &s;u&s;|pending
the commi&s;&s;ion of the legates, he evoked the
cau&s;e to Rome. The legate, Campeggio, had before|hand
received private orders, delivered by Campana, to
burn the decretal bull, with which he was entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>WOLSEY had long fore&s;een this mea&s;ure as the &s;ure
forerunner of his own ruin. Tho' he had at fir&s;t de&s;ired,
that the King &s;hould rather marry a French prince&s;s than
Anne Boleyn, he had employed him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t
a&s;&s;iduity and earne&s;tne&s;s to bring the affair to an happy
i&s;&s;ue<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 45. Burnet, vol. i. p. 53.</NOTE>: He was not therefore to be blamed for the un|pro&s;perous
event, which the pope's partiality had pro|duced.
But he had &s;ufficient experience of the extreme
ardour and impatience of Henry's temper, who could
bear no contradiction, and who was wont, without exa|mination
or di&s;tinction, to make his mini&s;ters an&s;werable
for the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, with which they were
entru&s;ted. Anne Boleyn al&s;o, who was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
again&s;t him, had imputed to him the failure of her hopes;
and as &s;he was newly returned to court, whence &s;he had
been removed, from a regard to decency, during the trial
before the legates, &s;he had naturally acquired an additio|nal
influence on Henry's mind, and &s;he &s;erved much to
fortify his prejudices again&s;t the cardinal<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h, p. 40.</NOTE>. Even the
queen and her partizans, judging of Wol&s;ey by the part
<PB N="100" REF="108">
which he had openly acted, had expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t
animo&s;ity again&s;t him; and the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite factions
&s;eemed now to combine in the ruin of this haughty mi|ni&s;ter.
The high opinion it&s;elf, which Henry had en|tertained
of the cardinal's capacity, tended to ha&s;ten his
downfal; while he imputed the bad &s;ucce&s;s of that mi|ni&s;ter's
undertakings, not to ill fortune or to mi&s;take,
but to the malignity or infidelity of his intentions. The
blow, however, fell not in&s;tantly on his head. The
King, who probably could not ju&s;tify by any good rea&s;on
his alienation from his antient favourite, &s;eems to have
remained &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pence; and he received him,
if not with all his former kindne&s;s, at lea&s;t with the ap|pearance
of tru&s;t and regard.</P>
<P>BUT it is found almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a high confidence
and affection to receive the lea&s;t diminution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wol&s;ey's fall.</NOTE> without
&s;inking into ab&s;olute indifference, or even running into
the oppo&s;ite extreme of hatred and aver&s;ion. The King
now determined to bring on the ruin of the cardinal with
a motion almo&s;t as precipitate as he had formerly em|ployed
in his elevation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Oct.</NOTE> The dukes of Norfolk and Suf|folk

<P>WOLSEY was ordered to depart from York-Place, a
palace which he had built in London, and which, tho' it
really belonged to the &s;ee of York, was &s;eized by Henry,
and became afterwards the re&s;idence of the Kings of Eng|land,
under the title of Whitehall. All his furniture
and plate were converted to the King's u&s;e. Their riches
<PB N="101" REF="109">
and &s;plendour befitted rather a royal than a private for|tune.
The walls of his palace were covered with cloth
of gold or cloth of &s;ilver: He had a cupboard of plate of
ma&s;&s;y gold: There were found a thou&s;and pieces of fine
holland belonging to him. All the re&s;t of his riches and
furniture was in proportion; and his opulence was pro|bably
no &s;mall inducement to this violent per&s;ecution
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE cardinal was ordered to retire to A&s;her, a coun|try
&s;eat which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed near Hampton-Court. The
world, who had paid him &s;uch abject court during his
pro&s;perity, now entirely de&s;erted him, on this fatal re|ver&s;e
of all his fortunes. He him&s;elf was much dejected
with the change; and from the &s;ame turn of mind, which
had made him be &s;o vainly elated with his grandeur, he
felt the blow of adver&s;ity with double rigour<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 114, 115. App. N^o 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The
&s;malle&s;t appearance of his return to favour threw him into
tran&s;ports of joy, unbecoming a man. The King had
&s;eemed willing, during &s;ome time, to intermit the blows,
which overwhelmed him. He granted him his protec|tion,
and left him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ees of York and
Winche&s;ter. He even &s;ent him a gracious me&s;&s;age, ac|companied
with a ring, as a te&s;timony of his affection.
Wol&s;ey, who was on hor&s;eback when the me&s;&s;enger met
him, immediately alighted; and throwing him&s;elf on his
knees in the mire, received in that humble po&s;ture the&s;e
marks of his maje&s;ty's gracious di&s;po&s;ition towards him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 547.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT his enemies, who dreaded his return to court,
never cea&s;ed plying the King with accounts of his &s;everal
offences; and Anne Boleyn in particular, who bore him
no kindne&s;s, contributed her endeavours, in conjunction
with her uncle the duke of Norfolk, to exclude him from
all hopes of ever being rein&s;tated in his former authority.
<PB N="102" REF="110">
He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed therefore his numerous retinue; and as he
was a kind and beneficent ma&s;ter, the &s;eparation pa&s;&s;ed
not without a plentiful effu&s;ion of tears on both &s;ides<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h. Stowe, 549.</NOTE>.
The King's heart, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome gleams of kind|ne&s;s,
&s;eemed now totally hardened again&s;t his old favou|rite.
He ordered him to be indicted in the Star Chamber,
where a &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed upon him. And not con|tented
with this &s;everity, he abandoned him to all the
rigour of the Parliament, which now, after a long inter|val,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov.</NOTE>
was again a&s;&s;embled. The hou&s;e of lords voted a
long charge again&s;t Wol&s;ey, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-four ar|ticles;
and accompanied it with an application to the
King for his puni&s;hment, and his removal from all au|thority.
Little oppo&s;ition was made to this charge in
the upper hou&s;e: No evidence of any part of it was &s;o
much as called for; and as it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of general
accu&s;ations, it was &s;carce &s;u&s;ceptible of any<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t article of the charge again&s;t the cardinal is his procuring the legatine power, which, however, as it was certainly done with the King's con&s;ent and permi&s;&s;ion, could be nowi&s;e criminal. Many of the other articles al&s;o regard the mere exerci&s;e of that power. Some arti|cles impute to him as crimes, particular actions, which were natural or unavoidable to any man, that was prime mini&s;ter with &s;o unlimited an authority; &s;uch as receiving fir&s;t all letters from the King's mini&s;ters abroad, receiving fir&s;t all vi&s;its from foreign mini&s;ters, de&s;iring that all applications &s;hould be made thro' him. He was al&s;o accu&s;ed of naming him&s;elf with the King, as if he had been his fellow, <HI>the King and I:</HI> It is reported that &s;ometimes he even put his own name before the King's, <HI>ego et rex meus.</HI> But this mode of expre&s;&s;ion is ju&s;tified by the Latin idiom. It is remarkable, that his whi&s;pering in the King's ear, knowing him&s;elf to be affected with venereal di&s;tempers, is an article again&s;t him. Many of the charges are general and incapable of proof. Lord Herbert goes &s;o far as to affirm, that no man ever fell from &s;o high a &s;tation, who had &s;o few real crimes objected to him. This opinion is perhaps too favourable to the cardinal. Yet the refutation of the articles by Cromwel, and their being rejected by a hou&s;e of commons even in this arbitrary reign, is almo&s;t a demon&s;tration of Wol&s;ey's innocence. Henry was, no doubt, entirely bent on his de&s;truction, when, on his failure by a parliamentary impeachment, he attacked him upon the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors, which afforded him &s;o little ju&s;t hold on that mini&s;ter. For $hat this indictment was &s;ub&s;equent to the attack in parliament, appears by Ca|vendi&s;h's life of Wol&s;ey, Stowe, p. 551, and more certainly by the very articles of impeachment them&s;elves.

<PB N="103" REF="111">
articles were &s;ent down to the hou&s;e of commons; where
Thomas Cromwel, formerly a &s;ervant of the cardinal,
and who had been rai&s;ed by him from a very low &s;tation,
defended his unfortunate patron with &s;uch &s;pirit, gene|ro&s;ity,
and courage, as acquired him great honour, and
laid the foundation of that favour, which he afterwards
enjoyed with the King.</P>
<P>WOLSEY's enemies, finding that either his innocence
or his caution prevented them from having any ju&s;t ground
of accu&s;ing him, had recour&s;e to a very extraordinary ex|pedient.
An indictment was lodged again&s;t him; that,
contrary to a &s;tatute of Richard the &s;econd, commonly
called the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors, he had procured bulls from
Rome, particularly that inve&s;ting him with the legatine
power, which he had exerci&s;ed with very exten&s;ive au|thority.
He confe&s;&s;ed the indictment, pleaded ignorance
of the &s;tatute, and threw him&s;elf on the King's mercy.
He was perhaps within reach of the law; but be&s;ides
that this &s;tatute was fallen altogether into di&s;u&s;e, nothing
could be more rigorous and &s;evere than to impute to him
as a crime, what he had openly, during a cour&s;e of &s;o
many years, practi&s;ed with the con&s;ent and approbation
of the King, and the acquie&s;cence of the Parliament and
kingdom. Not to mention, what he always a&s;&s;erted<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h, page 72.</NOTE>,
and what we can &s;carce doubt of, that he had obtained
the royal licence in the mo&s;t formal manner, which, had
he not been apprehen&s;ive of the dangers attending any
<PB N="104" REF="112">
oppo&s;ition to Henry's lawle&s;s will, he might have pleaded
in his own defence before the judges. Sentence, how|ever,
was pronounced again&s;t him, &startq;That he was out
of the King's protection; his lands and goods forfeited,
and that his per&s;on might be committed to cu&s;tody.&endq;
But this pro&s;ecution of Wol&s;ey, tho' it was not di&s;agree|able
to Henry, was carried no farther. He even granted
him his pardon for all offences; re&s;tored him part of his
plate and furniture; and &s;till continued, from time to
time, to drop expre&s;&s;ions of favour and compa&s;&s;ion to|wards
him.</P>
<P>THE complaints again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the eccle&s;i|a&s;tics<NOTE PLACE="marg">Com|mencement of the re|formation in England.</NOTE>
had been very antient in England, as well as in
mo&s;t other European kingdoms; and as this topic was
now become popular every where, it had paved the way
for the Lutheran tenets, and reconciled the people, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, to the frightful idea of here&s;y and innova|tion.
The commons, finding the occa&s;ion favourable,
pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal bills, re&s;training the impo&s;itions of the cler|gy;
one for regulating of mortuaries; another again&s;t
the exactions for the probates of wills<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The&s;e exactions were quite arbitrary, and had ri&s;en to a great height.

the laity. Lord Herbert<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">P. 293.</NOTE> has even pre&s;erved the &s;peech
of a gentleman of Grey's-Inn, which is of a very &s;ingular
nature, and contains &s;uch topics as we &s;hould little expect
to meet with during that period. The member in&s;i&s;ts

in different nations and ages; the endle&s;s inextri|cable
controver&s;ies maintained by the &s;everal &s;ects; the
impo&s;&s;ibility, that any man, much le&s;s the people, could

judgment with regard to all the&s;e objects of di&s;pute:
And upon the whole, he infers, that the only religion
obligatory on mankind is the belief of one &s;upreme Being,
the author of nature; and the nece&s;&s;ity of good morals,
in order to obtain his favour and protection. Such &s;enti|ments
would be deemed latitudinarian, even in our time;
and would not be advanced, without &s;ome precaution, in
a public a&s;&s;embly. But tho' the fir&s;t broaching of reli|gious
controver&s;y might encourage the &s;ceptical turn in a
few per&s;ons of a &s;tudious di&s;po&s;ition; the zeal, with
which men &s;oon after attached them&s;elves to their &s;everal
parties, &s;erved effectually to bani&s;h for a long time all
&s;uch obnoxious liberties.</P>
<P>THE bills for regulating the clergy met with &s;ome op|po&s;ition
in the hou&s;e of lords. Bi&s;hop Fi&s;her in particu|lar
imputed the&s;e mea&s;ures of the commons to their want
of faith; and to a formed de&s;ign, derived from heretical
and Lutheran principles, of robbing the church of her
patrimony, and overturning the national religion. The
duke of Norfolk reproved the prelate, in very &s;evere, and
even &s;omewhat indecent terms. He told him, that the
greate&s;t clerks were not always the wi&s;e&s;t men. But
Fi&s;her replied, that he did not remember any fools in his
time, that had proved great clerks. The exceptions
taken at the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter's &s;peech &s;topped not
there. The commons, by the mouth of Sir Thomas
Audley, their &s;peaker, made complaints to the King of
the reflections thrown upon them; and the bi&s;hop was
<PB N="106" REF="114">
obliged to put a more favourable con&s;truction on his
words<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary Hi&s;tory, vol. iii. p. 59. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 82.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY was not di&s;plea&s;ed, that the court of Rome
and the clergy &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible, that they were entirely
dependant on him, and that his Parliament, if he were
willing to &s;econd their inclinations, were &s;ufficiently di&s;|po&s;ed
to reduce the power and privileges of the eccle&s;i|a&s;tics.
The commons gratified the King in another par|ticular
of moment: They granted him a di&s;charge of all
tho&s;e debts, which he had contracted &s;ince the beginning
of his reign: And they grounded this bill, which occa|&s;ioned
many complaints, on a pretence of the King's
great care of the nation, and of his employing regularly
all the money, which he had borrowed, in the public
&s;ervice. Mo&s;t of the King's creditors con&s;i&s;ted of friends
to the cardinal, who had been engaged by their patron to
contribute to the &s;upply of Henry's demands; and the
pre&s;ent courtiers were well plea&s;ed to take the opportu|nity
of mulcting them<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 83.</NOTE>. Several al&s;o approved of an
expedient,
which, they hoped, would ever after di&s;credit
a method of &s;upply, &s;o irregular and &s;o unparliamentary.</P>
<P>THE dome&s;tic tran&s;actions of England were at pre&s;ent
&s;o intere&s;ting to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign affairs.</NOTE> that they chiefly engaged his
attention; and he regarded foreign affairs only in &s;ubor|dination
to them. He had declared war again&s;t the em|peror;
but the mutual advantages reaped by the com|merce
between England and the Netherlands had engaged
him to &s;tipulate a neutrality with tho&s;e provinces; and
except by money contributed to the Italian wars, he had
in effect exerci&s;ed no ho&s;tilities again&s;t any of the impe|rial
dominions. A general peace was this &s;ummer e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in Europe. Margaret of Au&s;tria and Loui&s;e of
Savoy met at Cambray, and &s;ettled the terms of pacifica|tion
<PB N="107" REF="115">
between the French King and the emperor. Charles
accepted of two millions of crowns in lieu of Burgundy;
and he delivered up the two princes of France, whom
he had retained as ho&s;tages. Henry was &s;o generous to
his friend and ally Francis, that he &s;ent him an acquital
of near 600,000 crowns, which that prince owed him.
Francis's Italian confederates were not &s;o well &s;atisfied
as the King with the peace of Cambray: They were
there almo&s;t wholly abandoned to the will of the empe|ror;
and &s;eemed to have no other means of &s;ecurity left,
but his equity and moderation. Florence, after a brave
re&s;i&s;tance, was &s;ubdued by the imperial arms, and finally
delivered over to the dominion of the family of Medici.
The Venetians were better treated: They were only
obliged to relinqui&s;h &s;ome acqui&s;itions, which they had
made on the coa&s;t of Naples. Even Francis Sforza
obtained the inve&s;titure of Milan, and was pardoned all
his pa&s;t offences. The emperor in per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed into
Italy with a magnificent train, and received the imperial
crown from the hands of the pope at Bologna. He was
but twenty-nine years of age; and having already, by
his vigour and capacity, &s;ucceeded in every enterprize,
and reduced to captivity the two greate&s;t potentates in
Europe, the one &s;piritual, the other temporal, he at|tracted
the eyes of all men; and many progno&s;tications
were formed of his growing empire.</P>
<P>BUT though Charles &s;eemed to be pro&s;perous on every
&s;ide, and the conque&s;t of Mexico and Peru now began
to prevent that &s;carcity of money, under which he had
hitherto laboured, he found him&s;elf threatened with dif|ficulties
in Germany; and his de&s;ire of remedying them
was the chief cau&s;e of his granting &s;uch moderate con|ditions
to the powers in Italy. Sultan Solyman, the
greate&s;t and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed prince that ever &s;at on
<PB N="108" REF="116" MS="Y">
the Ottoman throne, had almo&s;t entirely &s;ubdued Hun|gary,
had be&s;ieged Vienna, and, though repul&s;ed, &s;till
menaced the hereditary dominions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria
with conque&s;t and &s;ubjection. The Lutheran princes
in the empire, finding that liberty of con&s;cience was de|nied
them, had combined in a league for their own
defence at Smalcalde; and becau&s;e they prote&s;ted again&s;t
the votes of the imperial diet, they thenceforth received
the appellation of <HI>prote&s;tants.</HI> Charles had undertaken
to reduce them to obedience; and on pretence of &s;ecur|ing
the purity of religion, he had laid a &s;cheme of ag|grandizing
his own family, by extending its dominions
over all Germany.</P>
<P>THE friend&s;hip of Henry was one material circum|&s;tance
yet wanting to Charles, in order to render his
ambitious projects fea&s;ible; and the King was &s;ufficiently
acquainted, that the concurrence of that prince would at
once remove all the difficulties, which lay in the way of
his divorce; that point, which had long been the object
of his mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;hes. But be&s;ides that the inte|re&s;ts
of his kingdom &s;eemed to require a confederacy
with France, his haughty &s;pirit could not brook a friend|&s;hip
impo&s;ed on him by con&s;traint; and as he had ever
been accu&s;tomed to receive court&s;hip, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and
&s;olicitation from the greate&s;t potentates, he could ill
bear that dependance, to which this unhappy affair
&s;eemed to have reduced him. Amid&s;t the anxieties with
which he was agitated, he was often tempted to break
off all connexion with the court of Rome; and though
he had been educated in a &s;uper&s;titious reverence to the
papal authority, it is likely, that his per&s;onal experience
of the duplicity and &s;elfi&s;h politics of Clement, had
&s;erved much to open his eyes in that particular. He
found his royal prerogative firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed at home:
<PB N="109" REF="117">
He ob&s;erved that his people were in general much di&s;|gu&s;ted
with clerical u&s;urpations, and di&s;po&s;ed to reduce
the powers and privileges of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order: He
knew that they had cordially taken part with him in his
pro&s;ecution of the divorce, and highly re&s;ented that un|worthy
treatment, which, after &s;o many &s;ervices and
&s;uch devoted attachment, he had received from the court
of Rome. Anne Boleyn al&s;o could not fail, by her in|&s;inuations,
to engage him into extremities with the
pope, both as it was the readie&s;t way to her attaining
royal dignity, and as her education in the court of the
dutche&s;s of Alen&ccedil;on, a prince&s;s inclined to the reformers,
had already di&s;po&s;ed her to a belief of the new doctrines.
But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e inducements, Henry had
&s;trong motives &s;till to de&s;ire a good agreement with the
&s;overeign pontiff. He apprehended the danger of &s;uch
great innovations: He dreaded the reproach of here&s;y:
He abhorred all connexions with the Lutherans, the
chief opponents of the papal power: And having once
exerted him&s;elf with &s;uch applau&s;e, as he imagined, in
defence of the Romi&s;h communion, he was a&s;hamed to
retract his former opinions, and betray from pa&s;&s;ion &s;uch
a palpable incon&s;i&s;tency. While he was agitated by the&s;e
contrary motives, an expedient was propo&s;ed, which, as
it promi&s;ed a &s;olution of all difficulties, was embraced by
him with the greate&s;t joy and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>DR. Thomas Cranmer, a fellow of Je&s;us-College in
Cambridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The uni|ver&s;ities con&s;ulted about the King's marriage.</NOTE> was a man remarkable in that univer&s;ity for
his learning, and &s;till more, for the candour and di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s
of his temper. He fell one evening by
accident into company with Gardiner, now &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, and Fox the King's almoner; and as the bu&s;ine&s;s
of the divorce became the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, he
ob&s;erved, that the readie&s;t way either to quiet Henry's
con&s;cience or extort the pope's con&s;ent, would be to

con&s;ult all the univer&s;ities of Europe with regard to this
controverted point: If they agreed to approve the King's
marriage with Catherine, his remor&s;es would naturally
cea&s;e; if they condemned it, the pope would find it dif|ficult
to re&s;i&s;t the &s;olicitations of &s;o great a monarch
&s;econded by the opinion of all the learned men in Chri&s;|tendom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox, p. 1860. 2d edit, Burnet, vol. i. p. 79. Speed, p. 769. Heylin, p. 5.</NOTE>. When the King was informed of the propo&s;al,
he was delighted with it; and &s;wore, with more alacrity
than delicacy, that Cranmer had got the right &s;ow by
the ear: He &s;ent for that divine; entered into conver|&s;ation
with him; conceived a high opinion of his virtue
and under&s;tanding; engaged him to write in defence of
the divorce; and immediately, in pro&s;ecution of the
&s;cheme propo&s;ed, employed his agents to collect the
judgment of all the univer&s;ities in Europe.</P>
<P>HAD the que&s;tion of Henry's marriage with Catherine
been examined by the principles of &s;ound philo&s;ophy,
exempt from &s;uper&s;tition, it &s;eemed not liable to much
difficulty. The natural rea&s;on, why marriage in certain
degrees is prohibited by the civil laws, and condemned
by the moral &s;entiments of all nations, is derived from
men's care to pre&s;erve purity of manners; while they
reflect, that if a commerce of love were authorized be|tween
the neare&s;t relations, the frequent opportunities of
intimate conver&s;ation, e&s;pecially during early youth,
would introduce an univer&s;al di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and corruption.
But as the cu&s;toms of countries vary con&s;iderably, and
open an intercour&s;e, more or le&s;s re&s;trained, between
different families, or between the &s;everal members of the
&s;ame family, &s;o we find, that the moral precept, varying
with its cau&s;e, is &s;u&s;ceptible, without any inconvenience,
of very different latitude in the &s;everal ages and nations
<PB N="111" REF="121">
of the world. The extreme delicacy of the Greeks,
permitted no conver&s;e between per&s;ons of the two &s;exes,
except where they lived under the &s;ame roof; and even
the apartments of a &s;tep-mother, and her daughters,
were almo&s;t as much &s;hut up again&s;t vi&s;its from the
hu&s;band's &s;ons, as again&s;t tho&s;e from any &s;trangers or
more remote relations: Hence, in that nation, it was law|ful
for a man to marry, not only his niece, but his half
&s;i&s;ter by the father: A liberty unknown to the Romans,
and other nations, where a more open intercour&s;e was
authorized between the &s;exes. Rea&s;oning from this
principle, it would appear, that the ordinary commerce
of life among great princes, is &s;o ob&s;tructed by ceremony,
and numerous attendants, that no ill con&s;equence would
re&s;ult among them, from the marriage of a brother's
widow; e&s;pecially if the di&s;pen&s;ation of the &s;overeign
prie&s;t is previou&s;ly required, in order to ju&s;tify what may
in common ca&s;es be condemned, and to hinder the pre|cedent
from becoming too common and familiar. And
as &s;trong motives of public intere&s;t and tranquillity may
frequently require &s;uch alliances between the &s;overeign
families, there is le&s;s rea&s;on for extending towards them
the full rigour of that rule which has place among individuals<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Even judging of this que&s;tion by the &s;cripture, to which the appeal was every moment made, the arguments for the King's cau&s;e appear but lame and imperfect. Marriage in the degree of affinity which had place between Henry and Catherine, is, indeed, prohibited in Leviticus; but it is natural to interpret that prohibition as a part of the Jewi&s;h ceremonial or municipal law: And though it is there &s;aid, in the con|clu&s;ion, that the gentile nations, by violating the&s;e degrees of con&s;an|guinity, had incurred the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, the exten&s;ion of this maxim to every preci&s;e ca&s;e before &s;pecified, is &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;criptures to be compo&s;ed with a minute accuracy and preci&s;ion, to which, we know with certainty, the &s;acred penmen did not think proper to confine them&s;elves. The de&s;cent of mankind from one common father, obliged them, in the fir&s;t generation, to marry in the neare&s;t degrees of con&s;an|guinity: In&s;tances of a like nature occur among the patriarchs: And the marriage of a brother's widow was, in certain ca&s;es, not only per|mitted, but even enjoined as a po&s;itive precept by the Mo&s;aical law. It is in vain to &s;ay, that this precept was an exception to the rule; and an exception confined merely to the Jewi&s;h nation. The inference is &s;till ju&s;t, that &s;uch a marriage can contain no natural or moral turpi|tude; otherwi&s;e God, who is the author of all purity, would never, in any ca&s;e, have enjoined it.</NOTE>.</P>

BUT in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e rea&s;ons, and many more
which might be collected, Henry had cu&s;tom and prac|tice
on his &s;ide, the principle by which men are almo&s;t
wholly governed in their actions and opinions. Mar|riages
with a brother's widow were &s;o unu&s;ual, that no
other in&s;tance of it could be found in any hi&s;tory or
record of any Chri&s;tian nation; and though the popes
were accu&s;tomed to di&s;pen&s;e with more e&s;&s;ential precepts
of morality, and even permitted marriages within other
prohibited degrees, &s;uch as tho&s;e of uncle and niece, the
imaginations of men were not as yet reconciled to this
particular exercis&s;e of his authority. Several univer&s;ities
of Europe, therefore, without he&s;itation, as well as with|out
intere&s;t or reward<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>, gave verdict in the King's fa|vour;
not only tho&s;e of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1530.</NOTE> Paris, Orleans, Bourges,
Tholou&s;e, Angiers, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to lie under
the influence of their prince, ally to Henry; but al&s;o
tho&s;e of Italy, Venice, Ferrara, Padua; even Bologna
it&s;elf, though under the immediate juri&s;diction of Cle|ment.
Oxford alone<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Wood. hi&s;t. and ant. Ox. lib. i. p. 225.</NOTE> and Cambridge<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 6.</NOTE> made &s;ome dif|ficulty;

who&s;e con&s;equences, they feared, would prove &s;o fatal to
the antient $$ligion. Their opinion however, conform|able
to that of the other univer&s;ities of Europe, was at
<PB N="113" REF="125" MS="Y">
la&s;t procured; and the King, in order to give weight to
all the&s;e authorities, engaged his nobility to write a let|ter,
to the pope, recommending his cau&s;e to the holy fa|ther,
and threatening him with the mo&s;t dangerous con|&s;equences
in ca&s;e of a denial of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol xiv. 405. Burnet, vol. i. p. 95.</NOTE>. The convoca|tions
too both of Canterbury and York, pronounced the
King's marriage invalid, irregular, and contrary to the
law of God, with which no human power had authority
to di&s;pen&s;e<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer vol. xiv. p. 454, 472.</NOTE>. But Clement, lying &s;till under the influence
of the emperor, continued to &s;ummon the King to appear,
either by him&s;elf or proxy, before his tribunal at Rome;
and the King, who knew that he could expect no fair
trial there, refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a condition, and
would not even admit of any citation, which he regarded
as a high in&s;ult, and a violation of his royal prerogative.
The father of Anne Boleyn, created earl of Wilt&s;hire,
carried to the pope the King's rea&s;ons for not appearing
by proxy; and as the fir&s;t in&s;tance of di&s;re&s;pect from
England, refu&s;ed to ki&s;s his holine&s;s's foot, which he very
graciou&s;ly held out to him for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE extremities to which Henry was pu&s;hed, both
again&s;t the pope and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, were naturally
very di&s;agreeable to cardinal Wol&s;ey; and as Henry
fore&s;aw his oppo&s;ition, it is the mo&s;t probable rea&s;on
which can be a&s;&s;igned for his continuing to pro&s;ecute
with &s;o much rigour his ancient favourite. After Wol&s;ey
had remained &s;ome time at A&s;her, he was allowed to re|move
to Richmond, a palace which he had received as
a pre&s;ent from Henry, in return for Hampton-Court:
But the courtiers, dreading &s;till his near neighbourhood
to the King, procured an order for him to remove to his
&s;ee of York. The cardinal knew it was in vain to
<PB N="114" REF="126">
re&s;i&s;t: He took up his re&s;idence at Cawood in York&s;hire,
where he rendered him&s;elf extremely popular to the
neighbourhood, by his affability and ho&s;pitality<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h. Stowe, p. 554.</NOTE>; but he
was not allowed to remain long unmole&s;ted in this re|treat.
The earl of Northumberland received orders,
without regard to Wol&s;ey's eccle&s;ia&s;tical character, to
arre&s;t him for high trea&s;on, and to conduct him to Lon|don,
in order to his trial. The cardinal, partly from the
fatigues of his journey, partly from the agitation of his
anxious mind, was &s;eized with a di&s;order which turned
into a dy&s;entery; and he was able, with &s;ome difficulty,
to reach Leice&s;ter-abbey. When the abbot and monks
advanced to receive him with much re&s;pect and cere|mony,
he told them, that he was come to lay his bones
among them; and he immediately took his bed, whence
he never ro&s;e more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28 Novem.</NOTE> A little before he expired, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf in the following words to Sir William
King&s;ton, con&s;table of the Tower, who had him in cu&s;|tody.
&startq;I pray you, have me heartily recommended
unto his royal maje&s;ty, and be&s;eech him on my behalf
to call to his remembrance all matters that have pa&s;&s;ed
between us frm the beginning, e&s;pecially with regard
to his bu&s;ine&s;s with the queen; and then will he
know in his con&s;cience whether I have offended
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;HE is a prince of a mo&s;t royal carriage, and hath a
princely heart; and rather than he will mi&s;s or want
any part of his will, he will endanger the one half
of his kingdom.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I DO a&s;&s;ure you, that I have often kneeled before
him, &s;ometimes three hours together, to per&s;uade him
from his will and appetite; but could not prevail:
Had I but &s;erved God as diligently as I have &s;erved
<PB N="115" REF="127">
the King, he would not have given me over in my
grey hairs. But this is the ju&s;t reward that I mu&s;t
receive for my indulgent pains and &s;tudy, not regard|ing
my &s;ervice to God, but only to my Prince.
Therefore, let me advi&s;e you, if you be one of the
privy-council, as by your wi&s;dom you are fit, take
care what you put into the King's head: For you
can never put it out again<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THUS died this famous cardinal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wol&s;ey's death.</NOTE> who&s;e character
&s;eems to have contained as &s;ingular a variety as the for|tune
to which he was expo&s;ed. The ob&s;tinacy and
violence of the King's temper may alleviate much of the
blame which &s;ome of his favourite's mea&s;ures have under|gone;
and when we con&s;ider, that the &s;ub&s;equent part
of Henry's reign was much more unfortunate and criminal
than that which was directed by Wol&s;ey's councils, we
&s;hall be inclined to &s;u&s;pect of partiality tho&s;e hi&s;torians,
who have endeavoured to load the memory of this fa|vourite
with &s;uch violent reproaches. If in foreign po|litics,
he &s;ometimes employed his influence over the
King for his private purpo&s;es, rather than his ma&s;ter's
intere&s;t, which, he boa&s;ted, he had &s;olely at heart; we
mu&s;t remember, that he had in view the papal throne;
a dignity, which, had he attained it, would have enabled
him to make Henry a &s;uitable return for all his favours.
The cardinal d'Amboi&s;e, who&s;e memory is precious in
France, always made this apology for his own conduct,
which was, in &s;ome re&s;pect, &s;imilar to Wol&s;ey's; and
we have rea&s;on to think, that Henry was well acquainted
with the motives by which his mini&s;ter was influenced.
He regretted very much his death, when informed of it;
and always &s;poke favourably of his memory: A proof,
that humour more than rea&s;on, or any di&s;covery of
<PB N="116" REF="128">
treachery, had occa&s;ioned his la&s;t per&s;ecutions again&s;t
him.</P>
<P>A NEW &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was held,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1531. 16 January. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> together with
a convocation; and the King gave &s;trong proofs of his
exten&s;ive authority, as well as of his intention to employ
it to the depre&s;&s;ion of the Clergy. As an antient &s;tatute,
now almo&s;t ob&s;olete, had been made u&s;e of to ruin Wol|&s;ey,
and render his exerci&s;e of the legatine power
criminal, notwith&s;tanding the Kng's permi&s;&s;ion; the
&s;ame law was now turned again&s;t the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. It
was pretended, that every one who had &s;ubmitted to the
legatine authority, that is, the whole church, had vio|lated
the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors; and the attorney-general
brought accordingly an indictment again&s;t them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Brit. Eccle&s;. p. 325. Burnet, vol. i. p. 106.</NOTE>. The
convocation knew that it would be in vain to oppo&s;e
rea&s;on or equity to the King's arbitrary will, or plead
that their ruin would have been the certain con&s;equence
of not &s;ubmitting to Wol&s;ey's commi&s;&s;ion, which was
procured by Henry's con&s;ent, and &s;upported by his au|thority.
They cho&s;e therefore to throw them&s;elves on
the mercy of their &s;overeign; and they agreed to pay
118, 840 l. for their pardon<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 923.</NOTE>. A confe&s;&s;ion was likewi&s;e
extorted from them, that <HI>the King was the protector and
the &s;upreme head of the church and clergy of England;</HI>
though &s;ome of them had the dexterity to get a clau&s;e
in&s;erted, which invalidated the whole &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and
which ran in the&s;e terms, <HI>in &s;o far as is permitted by
the law of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE commons, finding that a pardon was granted the
clergy, began to be apprehen&s;ive for them&s;elves, le&s;t
either they &s;hould afterwards be brought into trouble,
<PB N="117" REF="129">
on account of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the legatine court, or
a &s;upply be extorted from them, in return for their par|don.
They therefore petitioned the King, to grant a
remi&s;&s;ion to his lay &s;ubjects; but met with a repul&s;e.
He told them, that, if he ever plea&s;ed to forgive their
offence, it would be from his own goodne&s;s, not from
their application, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;eem to be compelled to
it. Some time after, when they de&s;paired of obtaining
this conce&s;&s;ion, he was plea&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue a pardon to the
laity; and the commons expre&s;&s;ed great gratitude for
this act of clemency<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hall's chronicle. Holling&s;hed, p. 923. Baker, p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the &s;trict execution of the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1532.</NOTE> a
great part of the profit, and &s;till more of the power, of
the court of Rome was cut off; and the connexions be|tween
the pope and the Engli&s;h clergy were, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, di&s;&s;olved. The next &s;e&s;&s;ion found both King
and Parliament in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 January.</NOTE> An act was
pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t levying the annates or fir&s;t fruits<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. Collect. N^o. 41. Strype, vol. i. p. 144.</NOTE>; being
a year's rent of all the bi&s;hoprics that fell vacant: A tax
which was impo&s;ed by the court of Rome for granting
bulls to the new prelates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of the re&s;or|mation.</NOTE> and which was found to
amount to con&s;iderable &s;ums. Since the &s;econd of
Henry the &s;eventh, no le&s;s than one hundred and &s;ixty
thou&s;and pounds had been tran&s;mitted to Rome, on ac|count
of this claim; which the Parliament, therefore,
reduced to five per cent. of all the epi&s;copal benefices.
The better to keep the pope in awe, the King was en|tru&s;ted
with a power of regulating the&s;e payments, and
of confirming or inf$inging this act at his plea&s;ure:
And it was voted, that any cen&s;ures which &s;hould be
pa&s;&s;ed by the court of Rome, on account of that law,
&s;hould be entirely di&s;regarded, and that ma&s;&s; &s;hould be
<PB N="118" REF="130">
&s;aid, and the &s;acraments admini&s;tered, as if no &s;uch cen|&s;ures
had been i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>THIS &s;e&s;&s;ion the commons preferred to the King, a
long complaint again&s;t the abu&s;es and oppre&s;&s;ions of the
eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts; and they were proceeding to enact
laws for remedying them, when a difference aro&s;e, which
put an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion, before the Parliament had
fini&s;hed all their bu&s;ine&s;s. It was become a cu&s;tom for
men to make &s;uch &s;ettlements, or tru&s;t deeds, of their
land by will, that they defrauded, not only the King,
but all other lords, of their wards, marriages, and re|liefs;
and by the &s;ame artifice the King was deprived of
his primier &s;ei&s;in, and the profits of the livery, which
were no incon&s;iderable branches of the revenue. Henry
made a bill be drawn to moderate, not remedy altogether,
this abu&s;e: He was contented, that every man &s;hould
have the liberty of di&s;po&s;ing in this manner of the half of
his land; and he told the Parliament in plain terms,
&startq;If they would not take a rea&s;onable thing, when it
was offered, he would &s;earch out the extremity of the
law; and then would not offer them &s;o much again.&endq;
The lords came willingly into his terms; but the com|mons
rejected the bill: A &s;ingular in&s;tance, where Henry
might &s;ee, that his power and authority, tho' exten&s;ive,
had yet &s;ome boundaries. The commons, however,
&s;ound rea&s;on to repent of their victory. The King
made good his threats: He called together the judges
and able&s;t lawyers, who argued the que&s;tion in chan|cery;
and it was decided, that a man could not by
law bequeath any part of his lands, in prejudice of his
heir<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 116. Hall. Parlimentary hi&s;tory.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament being again a&s;&s;embled after a &s;hort
prorogation, the King cau&s;ed the two oaths to be read
<PB N="119" REF="131">
to them, that which the bi&s;hops took to the pope,
and that to the King, on their in&s;tallation; and as a
contradiction might be &s;u&s;pected between them, while
the prelates &s;eemed to &s;wear allegiance to two &s;ove|reigns<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 123, 124.</NOTE>, the Parliament &s;hewed their intention of a|boli&s;hing
the oath to the pope, when their proceedings
were &s;uddenly &s;topped by the breaking out of the plague
at We&s;tmin&s;ter, which occa&s;ioned a prorogation. It is
remarkable, that one Tem&s;e ventured this &s;e&s;&s;ion to
move, that the Hou&s;e &s;hould addre&s;s the King, to take
back the queen, and &s;top the pro&s;ecution of his divorce.
This motion occa&s;ioned the King to &s;end for Audley,
the Speaker; and to explain to him the &s;cruples with
which his con&s;cience had &s;o long been agitated; &s;cruples,
he &s;aid, which had proceeded from no wanton appetite,
which had ari&s;en after the fervours of youth were pa&s;t,
and which were confirmed by the concur$ing &s;enti|ments
of all the learned &s;ocieties in Europe. Except
in Spain and Portugal, he added, it was never heard of,
that any man had e&s;pou&s;ed two &s;i&s;ters; but he him&s;elf
had the misfortune, he believed, to be the fir&s;t chri&s;tian
man who had ever married his brother's widow<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the prorogation, Sir Thomas More, the chan|cellor,
fore&s;eeing that all the mea&s;ures of the King and
Parliament tended to a breach with the church of Rome,
and to an alteration of religion, which his principles
would not permit him to concur with, de&s;ired leave to
re&s;ign the &s;eals; and he de&s;cended from this high &s;tation
with more joy and alacrity than he had mounted up to
it. The au&s;terity of this man's virtue, and the &s;anctity
of his manners, had nowi&s;e encroached on the gentlene&s;s
of his temper, nor even dimini&s;hed that frolic and gaity
<PB N="120" REF="132">
to which he was naturally inclined. He &s;ported with
all the varieties of fortune into which he was thrown;
and neither the pride naturally attending a high &s;tation,
nor the melancholy incident to poverty and retreat, could
ever lay hold of his &s;erene and equal &s;pirit. While his
family di&s;covered &s;ymptoms of &s;orrow on laying down
the grandeur and magnificence to which they had been
accu&s;tomed, he drew a &s;ubject of mirth from their di&s;|tre&s;&s;es;
and made them a&s;hamed of lo&s;ing even a mo|ment's
chearfulne&s;s, on account of &s;uch trivial misfor|tunes.
The King, who had entertained a high opinion
of his virtue, admitted his re&s;ignation with &s;ome dif|ficulty;
and he be&s;towed the &s;eals &s;oon after on Sir
Thomas Audley.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions in England, and the&s;e in|va&s;ions
of the papal and eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, the court
of Rome were not without &s;olicitude; and they enter|tained
very ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing entirely their
authority in England; the kingdom, which, of all others,
had long been mo&s;t devoted to the holy &s;ee, and which
had yielded it the mo&s;t ample revenue. While the im|perial
cardinals pu&s;hed Clement to proceed to extremi|ties
again&s;t the King, his more moderate and impartial
coun&s;ellers repre&s;ented to him the indignity of his pro|ceedings;
that a great monarch, who had &s;ignalized
him&s;elf, both by his pen and his &s;word, in the pope's
cau&s;e, &s;hould be denied a favour, which he demanded on
&s;uch ju&s;t grounds, and which had &s;carce ever before been
refu&s;ed to any per&s;on of his rank and &s;tation. Notwith|&s;tanding
the&s;e remon&s;trances, the Queen's appeal was
received at Rome; the King was cited to appear; and
&s;everal con&s;i&s;tories were held, to examine the validity of
their marriage. Henry was determined not to &s;end any
proxy to plead his cau&s;e before this court: He only
di&s;patched Sir Edward Karne and Dr. Bonner, in quality
<PB N="121" REF="133">
excu&s;ators, &s;o they were called, to carry his apology,
for not paying that deference to the papal authority.
The prerogatives of his crown, he &s;aid, mu&s;t be &s;acri|ficed,
if he allowed of appeals from his own kingdom;
and as the que&s;tion regarded con&s;cience, not power or
interest, no proxy could &s;upply his place, or convey that
&s;atisfaction which the dictates of his own mind could
alone con&s;er.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11 October.</NOTE> In order to &s;upport him&s;elf in this mea|&s;ure,
and add greater &s;ecurity to his defection from
Rome, he procured an interview with Francis at Bou|logne
and Calais, where he renewed his per&s;onal friend|&s;hip,
as well as public alliance, with that monarch, and
concerted all mea&s;ures for their mutual defence. He
even employed arguments, by which, he believed, he
had per&s;uaded Francis to imitate his example in with|drawing
his obedience from the bi&s;hop of Rome, and
admini&s;tering eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs without having farther
recour&s;e to that &s;ee. And being now fully determined
in his own mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Novem.</NOTE> as well as re&s;olute to &s;tand all con&s;e|quences,
he privately celebrated his marriage with Anne
Boleyn, whom he had created marchione&s;s of Pembroke.
Rouland Lee, &s;oon after rai&s;ed to the bi&s;hopric of Co|ventry,
officiated at the marriage. The duke of Norfolk,
uncle to the new Queen, her father, mother, and bro|ther,
together with Dr. Cranmer, were pre&s;ent at the
ceremony<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 340, 341.</NOTE>. Anne became pregnant &s;oon after her mar|riage;
and this event, both gave great joy to the King,
and was regarded by the people as a &s;trong proof of the
Queen's former mode&s;ty and virtue.</P>
<P>THE Parliament was again a&s;&s;embled; and Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1533.</NOTE> in
conjunction with the great council of the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 February. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> pro|ceeded
&s;till in tho&s;e gradual and &s;ecure &s;teps, by which
<PB N="122" REF="134">
they loo&s;ened their connexions with the &s;ee of Rome,
and repre&s;&s;ed the u&s;urpations of the Roman pontiff. An
act was made again&s;t all appeals to Rome in cau&s;es
of matrimony, divorces, wills, and other &s;uits cognizable in
eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts; appeals e&s;teemed di&s;honourable to
the kingdom, by &s;ubjecting it to a foreign juri&s;diction;
and found to be infinitely vexatious, by the expence and
the delay of ju&s;tice, which, nece&s;&s;arily attended them<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">24 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>.
The more to &s;hew his disregard to the pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 April.</NOTE> Henry, finding the new Queen's pregnancy to advance, publicly
owned his marriage; and in order to remove all doubts
with regard to its lawfulne&s;s, he prepared mea&s;ures for
declaring, by a formal &s;entence, the invalidity of his
former marriage with Catherine: A &s;entence which
ought naturally to have preceded his e&s;pou&s;als of Anne<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 31. and Records, N^o. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, notwith&s;tanding his &s;cruples and remor&s;es
on account of his fir&s;t marriage, had always treated
Catherine with re&s;pect and di&s;tinction; and he endea|voured,
by every &s;oft and per&s;ua&s;ive art, to engage her
to depart from her appeal to Rome, and her oppo&s;ition
to his divorce. Finding her ob&s;tinate in maintaining
the ju&s;tice of her cau&s;e, he had totally forborne all vi&s;its
and intercour&s;e with her; and had de&s;ired her to make
choice of any one of his palaces in which &s;he &s;hould
plea&s;e to re&s;ide. She had fixed her court for &s;ome time
at Amphill near Dun&s;table; and it was in this latter
town that Cranmer, now created archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 May.</NOTE>
on the death of Warham<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Burnet has given us an account of the number of bulls re|qui&s;ite for Cranmer's in&s;tallation By one bull, directed to the King, he is, upon the royal nomination, made archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. By a &s;econd, directed to him&s;elf, he is made archbi&s;hop. By a third, he is ab&s;olved from all cen&s;ures. A fourth, is to the &s;uffragans, requiring them to receive and acknowledge him as archbi&s;hop. A fifth to the dean and chapter, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. A &s;ixth to the clergy of Canterbury. A &s;eventh to all the laity in his &s;ee. An eighth to all that held lands of it. By a ninth he was ordained to be con&s;ecrated, taking the oath that was in the pontifical. By a tenth bull the pall was &s;ent him. By an eleventh, the archbi&s;hop of York, and the bi&s;hop of Lon|don, were required to put it on him. The&s;e were &s;o many artifices to draw fees to offices, which the popes had erected, and di&s;po&s;ed of for money. It may be worth ob&s;erving, that Cranmer, before he took the oath to the pope, made a prote&s;tation, that he did not intend thereby to re&s;train him&s;elf from any thing that he was bound to, either by his duty to God, the King, or the country; and that he renounced every thing in it that was contrary to any of the&s;e. This device was the invention of &s;ome ca&s;ui&s;t, and not very compatible with that &s;trict &s;incerity, and that &s;crupulous con&s;cience, of which Cranmer made pro|fe&s;&s;ion.

The near neighbourhood of the place was cho&s;en in
order to deprive her of all plea of ignorance; and as
&s;he made no an&s;wer to the citation, neither by her&s;elf

proceeded to the examination of the cau&s;e. The
evidences of Arthur's con&s;ummation of the marriage were
produced; the opinions of the univer&s;ities were read;
together with the judgment pronounced two years before
by the convocations both of Canterbury and York; and
after the&s;e preparatory &s;teps, Cranmer proceeded to a
&s;entence, and annulled the King's marriage with Ca|therine
as unlawful and invalid. By a &s;ub&s;equent &s;en|tence,
he ratified the marriage with Anne Boleyn, who
&s;oon after was publicly crowned Queen, with all the
pomp and dignity &s;uited to that ceremony<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 6.</NOTE>. To com|plete
the King's &s;atisfaction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7 Sept.</NOTE> on the conclu&s;ion of this
intricate and vexatious affair, &s;he was &s;afely delivered
<PB N="124" REF="136">
of a daughter, who received the name of Elizabeth, and
who afterwards &s;wayed the &s;cepter with &s;uch renown
and felicity. Henry was &s;o much delighted with the
birth of this child, that &s;oon after he conferred on her
the title of prince&s;s of Wales<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 134.</NOTE>; a &s;tep &s;omewhat ire|gular,
as &s;he was only pre&s;umptive, not apparent heir
of the crown. But he had, during his former marriage,
thought proper to honour his daughter Mary with that
title; and he was determined to be&s;tow on the offspring
of his pre&s;ent marriage, the &s;ame marks of di&s;tinction, as
well as exclude Mary from all hopes of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
His regard for the new Queen &s;eemed rather to increa&s;e
than dimini&s;h by his marriage; and all men expected
to &s;ee the entire a&s;cendant of one who had mounted a
throne, from which her birth had &s;et her at &s;o great a
di&s;tance, and who, by a proper mixture of &s;everity and
indulgence, had long managed &s;o intractable a &s;pirit as
that of Henry. In order to efface, as much as po&s;&s;ible,
all marks of his fir&s;t marriage, Lord Mountjoy was &s;ent
to the unfortunate and divorced Queen, to inform her,
that &s;he was henceforth to be treated only as prince&s;s-dowager
of Wales; and all means were employed to
make her acquic&s;ce in that determination. But &s;he
continued ob&s;tinate in maintaining the validity of her
marriage; and &s;he would admit of no &s;ervice from any
per&s;on, who did not approach her with the accu&s;tomed
ceremonial. Henry, forgetting his wonted genero&s;ity
towards her, employed menaces again&s;t &s;uch of her
&s;ervants as complied with her commands in this par|ticular;
but was never able to make her relinqui&s;h her

<P>WHEN intelligence was conveyed to Rome of the&s;e
tran&s;actions, &s;o injurious to the authority and reputation
<PB N="125" REF="137">
of the holy &s;ee, the conclave were in a rage, and all the
cardinals of the imperial faction urged the pope to pro|ceed
to a definitive &s;entence, and to emit his &s;piritual
thunders again&s;t Henry. But Clement proceeded no
farther than to declare the nullity of Cranmer's &s;entence,
as well as that of Henry's &s;econd marriage; threatening
him with excommunication, if, before the fir&s;t of No|vember
en&s;uing, he did not replace every thing in the
condition, in which they formerly &s;tood<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 566.</NOTE>. An event had happened, from which the pontiff expected a more amicable conclusion of the difference, and which hindered him from carrying matters to extremity again&s;t the King.
THE pope had claims upon the dutchy of Ferrara for the &s;overeignty of Reggio and Modena<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 133. Guicciardini.</NOTE>; and having
&s;ubmitted his preten&s;ions to the arbitration of the em|peror,
he was &s;urprized to find a &s;entence pronounced
again&s;t him. Enraged at this di&s;appointment, he heark|ened
to propo&s;als of amity from Francis; and when that
monarch made overtures of marrying the duke of Orleans,
his &s;econd &s;on, with Catherine of Medici, niece to the
pope, Clement gladly embraced an alliance, by which
his family was &s;o much honoured. An interview was
even appointed of the pope and French King at Mar&s;eil|les;
and Francis, as a common friend, employed his
good offices in mediating an agreement between his new
ally and the King of England.</P>
<P>HAD this connexion of France with the &s;ee of Rome
taken place a few years &s;ooner, there had been little dif|ficulty
in compo&s;ing the quarrel with Henry. The
Kind's reque&s;t was an ordinary one; and the &s;ame ple|nary
power of the pope, which had granted a di&s;pen|&s;ation
<PB N="126" REF="138">
for his e&s;pou&s;ing Catherine, could ea&s;ily have an|nulled
the marriage. But in the progre&s;s of the quarrel,
the &s;tate of affairs was much changed on both &s;ides.
Henry had &s;haken off much of that reverence with which
he had been early imbued for the apo&s;tolical &s;ee; and
finding, that his &s;ubjects of all ranks had taken part with
him, and willingly complied with his movements for
breaking foreign dependance, he had taken a reli&s;h for
his &s;piritual authority, and would &s;carce, it was appre|hended,
be induced to renew his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the
Roman pontiff. The pope, on the other hand, ran
now a manife&s;t ri&s;que of infringing his authority by a
compliance with the King; and as a &s;entence of divorce
could no longer be re&s;ted on nullities in Julius's bull,
but would be con&s;trued as an acknowledgment of papal
u&s;urpations, it was fore&s;een, that the Lutherans would
thence take occa&s;ion of triumph, and would per&s;evere
more ob&s;tinately in their pre&s;ent principles. But not|with&s;tanding
the&s;e ob&s;tacles, Francis did not de&s;pair of
mediating an agreement. He &s;till ob&s;erved that the King
had &s;ome remains of prejudice in favour of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee,
and was apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences, which
might en&s;ue from too violent innovations. He &s;aw
plainly the intere&s;t, that Clement had in pre&s;erving the
obedience of England, which was one of the riche&s;t
jewels in the papal crown. And he hoped, that the&s;e
motives on both &s;ides Would facilitate a mutual agree|ment,
and would forward the effects of his good of|fices.</P>
<P>FRANCIS fir&s;t prevailed on the pope to promi&s;e, that,
if the King would &s;end a proxy to Rome, and thereby
&s;ubmit his cau&s;e to the holy &s;ee, he would appoint com|mi&s;&s;ioners
to meet at Cambray, and form the proce&s;s;
and he would immediately afterwards pronounce the
&s;entence of divorce, required of him. Bellay, bi&s;hop of
<PB N="127" REF="139">
Paris, was next di&s;patched to London, and obtained a
promi&s;e of the King, that he would &s;ubmit his cau&s;e to
the Roman con&s;i&s;tory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1534.</NOTE> provided the cardinals of the im|perial
faction were excluded from it. The prelate car|ried
this verbal promi&s;e to Rome; and the pope agreed,
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's final breach with Rome.</NOTE> if the King would &s;ign a written agreement to the
&s;ame purpo&s;e, his demands &s;hould be fully cornplied
with. A day was appointed for the return of the me&s;|&s;engers;
and all the world regarded this affair, which
had threatened a violent rupture between England and
the Romi&s;h church, as drawing towards an amicable
conclu&s;ion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.
But the greate&s;t affairs often depend on
the mo&s;t frivolous incidents. The courier, who carried
the King's written promi&s;e, was detained beyond the day
appointed: News were brought to Rome that a libel had
been publi&s;hed in England again&s;t the court of Rome,
and a farce acted before the King in deri&s;ion of the pope
and cardinals<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d March.</NOTE> The pope and cardinals entered into
the con&s;i&s;tory enflamed with anger; and by a precipitate
&s;entence, the marriage of Henry and Catherine was pro|nounced
valid, and Henry declared to be excommuni|cated
if he refu&s;ed to adhere to it. Two days after, the
courier arrived; and Clement, who had been hurried
from his u&s;ual prudence, found, that, tho' he repented
heartily of this ha&s;ty mea&s;ure, it would be difficult for
him to retract it, or replace affairs on the &s;ame footing
as before.</P>
<P>IT is not probable, that the pope, had he conducted
him&s;elf with ever &s;o great moderation and temper, could
hope, during the life-time of Henry, to have regained
much authority or influence in England. That mo|narch
was both impetuous and ob&s;tinate in his cha|racter;
and having proceeded &s;o far in throwing
<PB N="128" REF="140">
off the papal yoke, he never could again have been in|duced
tamely to bend his neck to it. Even at the time,
when he was negotiating a reconcilement with Rome,
he either entertained &s;o little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15 January.</NOTE> or was
&s;o indifferent about the event,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> that he had a&s;&s;embled a
Parliament; and continued to enact laws totally de&s;truc|tive
of the papal authority. The people had been pre|pared
by degrees for this great innovation. Each pre|ceding
&s;e&s;&s;ion had retrenched &s;omething from the power
and profit of the pontiff. Care had been taken, during
&s;ome years, to teach the nation, that a general council
was much &s;uperior to the pope. But now a bi&s;hop
preached every Sunday at Paul's Cro&s;s, in order to in|culcate
the doctrine, that the pope was intitled to no
authority at all beyond the bounds of his own dioce&s;e<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 144.</NOTE>.
The proceedings of the Parliament &s;howed that they
had entirely adopted this opinion; and there is rea&s;on to
believe, that the King, after having procured a favour|able
&s;entence from Rome, which would have removed
all the doubts with regard to his &s;econd marriage and
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, might indeed have lived on terms of ci|vility
with the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, but never would have &s;ur|rendered
to it any con&s;iderable &s;hare of his a&s;&s;umed
prerogative. The importance of the laws, pa&s;&s;ed this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, even before news arrived of the violent re&s;o|lutions
taken at Rome, is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify this
opinion.</P>
<P>ALL payments made to the apo&s;tolic chamber; all
provi&s;ions, bulls, di&s;pen&s;ations, were aboli&s;hed: Mona&s;|teries
were &s;ubjected to the vi&s;itation and government
of the King alone: The law for puni&s;hing heretics was
moderated; the ordinary was prohibited to impri&s;on or
try any per&s;on upon &s;u&s;picion alone, without pre&s;ent|ment
<PB N="129" REF="141">
by two lawful witne&s;&s;es; and it was declared,
that to &s;peak again&s;t the pope's authority was no here&s;y:
Bi&s;hops were to be appointed, by a <HI>cong&egrave; d'elire</HI> from
the crown, or in ea&s;e of the dean and chapter's refu&s;al,
by letters patent; and no recour&s;e was to be had to
Rome for palls, bulls, or provi&s;ions: Campeggio and
Ghinucci, two Italians, were deprived of the bi&s;hoprics
of Sali&s;bury and Worce&s;ter, which they had hitherto
enjoyed<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Le Neve's Fa&s;ti Eccle&s;. Angl.</NOTE>: The law which had been formerly made
again&s;t paying annates or fir&s;t fruits, but which had been
left in the King's power to &s;u&s;pend or enforce, was
finally e&s;tabli&s;hed: And a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which was exacted
two years before from the clergy, and which had been
obtained with great difficulty, received this &s;e&s;&s;ion the
&s;anction of Parliament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">25. H. 8. c. 19.</NOTE>. In this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the clergy
acknowledge, that convocations ought only to be a&s;|&s;embled
by the King's authority; they promi&s;e to enact
no new canons without his con&s;ent; and they agree,
that he &s;hould appoint thirty-two commi&s;&s;ioners, in order
to examine the old canons, and abrogate &s;uch as &s;hould
be found prejudicial to his royal prerogative<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 69, 70.</NOTE>. An ap|peal
was al&s;o allowed from the bi&s;hop's $ourt to the
King in Chancery.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t important law pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was
that which regulated the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown: The
marriage of the King with Catherine was declared un|lawful,
void, and of no effect: The primate's &s;entence,
annulling it, was ratified: And the marriage with Queen
Anne was e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed. The crown was
appointed to de&s;cend to the i&s;&s;ue of that marriage, and
failing them to the King's heirs for ever. An oath like|wi&s;e
was ordered to be taken in favour of this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="130" REF="142">
under the penalty of impri&s;onment during the King's
plea&s;ure, and forfeiture of goods and chattels. And all
&s;lander again&s;t the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30 March.</NOTE> Queen, or their i&s;&s;ue, was
&s;ubjected to the penalty of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. After
the&s;e compliances, the Parliament was prorogued; and
tho&s;e acts, &s;o contemptuous towards the pope, and &s;o
destructive of his authority, were pa&s;&s;ed at the very time
that Clement pronounced his ha&s;ty &s;entence again&s;t the
King. Henry's re&s;entment again&s;t Queen Catherine, on
account of her ob&s;tinacy, was the rea&s;on why he exclud|ed
her daughter from all hopes of Succeeding to the
crown; contrary to his fir&s;t intention, when he began
the &s;uit of divorce, and of di&s;pen&s;ation for a &s;econd
marriage.</P>
<P>THE King found his eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ubjects as com|pliant
as the laity. The convocation ordered, that the
act again&s;t appeals to Rome, together with the King's
appeal from the pope to a general council, &s;hould be af|fixed
to the doors of all the churches in the kingdom:
And they voted, that the bi&s;hop of Rome had, by the law
of God, no more juri&s;diction in England than any other
foreign bi&s;hop; and that the authority, which he and
his predece&s;&s;ors had exerci&s;ed there, was only by u&s;ur|pation
and the &s;ufferance of Engli&s;h princes. Four per|&s;ons
only oppo&s;ed this vote in the lower hou&s;e, and one
doubted. It pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly in the upper. The
bi&s;hops went &s;o far in their complai&s;ance, that they took
out new commi&s;&s;ions from the crown, where all their
&s;piritual and epi&s;copal authority was expre&s;sly affirmed
to be derived ultimately from the civil magi&s;trate, and
to be entirely dependent on his good plea&s;ure<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Collier's Eccl. hi&s;t. vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE oath regarding the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was generally &s;worn
throughout the kingdom. Fi&s;her, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter,
<PB N="131" REF="143">
and Sir Thomas More, were the only per&s;ons of note,
who entertained &s;cruples with regard to its legality.
Fi&s;her was obnoxious on account of &s;ome practices, into
which his credulity, rather than any bad intentions,
&s;eems to have betrayed him. But More was the per&s;on
of greate&s;t reputation in the kingdom for virtue and
integrity; and as it was believed, that his authority
would have influence on the &s;entiments of others, great
pains were taken to convince him of the lawfulne&s;s of
the oath. He declared, that he had no &s;cruple with re|gard
to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and thought that the Parliament
had full power to &s;ettle it: He offered to draw an
oath him&s;elf, which would a&s;&s;ure his allegiance to the
heir appointed; but he refu&s;ed the oath pre&s;cribed by
law; becau&s;e the preamble of that oath a&s;&s;erted the
legality of the King's marriage with Anne, and thereby
implied, that his former marriage with Catherine was
unlawful and invalid. Cranmer, the primate, and
Cromwel, now &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who highly loved and
e&s;teemed More, earne&s;tly &s;olicited him to lay a&s;ide his
&s;cruples; and their friendly entreaties &s;eemed to weight
more with him, than all the penalties attending his
refu&s;al<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 156.</NOTE>. He per&s;i&s;ted however, in a mild, though firm
manner, to maintain his re&s;olution; and the King, irri|tated
again&s;t him as well as Fi&s;her, ordered them both
to be indicted upon the &s;tatute, and committed pri&s;oners
to the Tower.</P>
<P>THE Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d Novem|ber.</NOTE> being again a&s;&s;embled, conferred
on the King the title or the only &s;upreme <HI>head</HI> on earth
of the church of England; as they had already inve&s;ted
him with all the real power belonging to it. In this
memorable act, the Parliament granted him power, or
<PB N="132" REF="144">
rather acknowledged his inherent power, &startq;to vi&s;it, and
repre&s;s, redre&s;s, reform, order, correct, re&s;train, or
amend all errors, here&s;ics, abu&s;es, offences, contempts
and enormities, which fell under any &s;piritual autho|rity
or juri&s;diction<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">26 H. 8. c. 1.</NOTE>.&endq; They al&s;o declared it trea&s;on
to attempt, imagine, or &s;peak evil again&s;t the King,
Queen, or his heirs, or to endeavour the depriving them
of their dignities or titles. They gave him a right to all
the annates and tythes of benefices, which had formerly
been paid to the court of Rome. They granted him a
&s;ub&s;idy and a fifteenth. They attainted More and Fi&s;her
for mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. And they compleated the
union of England and Wales, by giving to that princi|pality
all the benefit of the Engli&s;h laws.</P>
<P>THUS the authority of the popes, like all exorbitant
power, was ruined by the exce&s;s of its acqui&s;itions, and
by &s;tretching its preten&s;ions beyond what it was po&s;&s;ible
for any human principles or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to &s;u&s;tain.
The right of granting indulgences had in former ages
contributed extremely to enrich the holy &s;ee; but being
openly abu&s;ed, they &s;erved to exite the fir&s;t commotions
and oppo&s;itions in Germany. The prerogative of grant|ing
di&s;pen&s;ations had al&s;o contributed much to attach
all the &s;overeign princes and great families in Europe to
the papal authority; but meeting with an unlucky con|currence
of circum&s;tances, was now the cau&s;e, why
England &s;eparated her&s;elf from the Romi&s;h communion.
The acknowledgment of the King's &s;upremacy introduced
there a greater &s;implicity into the government, by uniting
the spiritual with the civil power, and preventing di&s;|putes
about limits, which never could be exactly deter|mined
between the contending parties. A way was al&s;o
prepared for checking the exorbitancy of &s;uper&s;tition, and
<PB N="133" REF="145">
breaking tho&s;e &s;hackles, by which all human rea&s;on, po|licy
and indu&s;try had &s;o long been incumbered. The
prince, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, being head of the religion,
as well as of the temporal juri&s;diction of the kingdom,
though he might &s;ometimes employ the former as an en|gine
of government, had no intere&s;t, like the Roman
pontiff, in nouri&s;hing its exce&s;&s;ive growth; and, except
when blinded by ignorance or bigotry, would be &s;ure to
retain it within tolerable limits, and prevent its abu&s;es.
And on the whole, there followed from the&s;e revolutions
very beneficial con&s;equences; though perhaps neither
fore&s;een nor intended by the per&s;ons who had the chief
hand in conducting them.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry proceeded with &s;o much order and
tranquillity in hanging the antient religion, and while
his authority &s;eemed entirely &s;ecure in England, he was
held in &s;ome inquietude by the &s;tate of affairs in Ireland
and in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE earl of Kildare was deputy of Ireland, under
the duke of Richmond, the King's natural &s;on, who bore
the title of lieutenant; and as Kildare was accu&s;ed of
&s;ome violences again&s;t the family of O&s;&s;ory, his heredi|tary
enemy, he was called over to an&s;wer for his con|duct.
He left his authority in the hands of his &s;on, who
hearing that his father was thrown into pri&s;on, and
was in danger of his life, immediately took up arms,
and joining him&s;elf to Oneale, Ocarrol, and other
Iri&s;h nobility, committed many ravages, murdered Al|len,
archbi&s;hop of Dublin, and laid &s;iege to that
city, Old Kildare mean-while died in pri&s;on, and
his &s;on, per&s;evering in his revolt, made applications
to the emperor, who promi&s;ed him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The
King $word$ obliged to &s;end over &s;ome forces to Ire|land,
which &s;o harra&s;&s;ed the rebels, that Kildare, find|ing
<PB N="134" REF="146">
the emperor backward in fulfilling his promi&s;es,
was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering him&s;elf
pri&s;oner to Lord Leonard Gray, the new deputy, brother
to the marquis of Dor&s;et. He was &s;ent over to Eng|land,
together with his five uncles; and after trial
and conviction, they were all brought to public ju&s;|tice;
though two of the uncles, in order to &s;ave the
family, had pretended to join the King's party.</P>
<P>THE earl of Angus had acquired the entire a&s;cend|ant
in Scotland, and having got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King's
per&s;on, then in early youth, he was able, by means
of that advantage, and by employing the power of
his own family, to retain the reins of government.
The queen-dowager, however, his &s;pou&s;e, bred him
great di&s;&s;urbance: For having &s;eparated her&s;elf from
him, on account of &s;ome jealou&s;ies and di&s;gu&s;ts, and
having procured a divorce, &s;he had married another man
of quality, of the name of Stuart; and &s;he joined all the
di&s;contented nobility, who oppo&s;ed Angus's authority.
James him&s;elf was di&s;&s;atisfied with the &s;lavery, to
which he was reduced; and by &s;ecret corre&s;pondence,
he excited fir&s;t Walter Scot, then the earl of Lenox,
to attempt, by force of arms, to free him from the
hands of Angus. Both enterprizes failed of &s;ucce&s;s;
but James, impatient of re&s;traint, found means at la&s;t
of flying to Stirling, where his mother then re&s;ided;
and having &s;ummoned all the nobility to attend him,
he overturned the authority of the Dougla&s;&s;es, and
obliged Angus and his brother to fly into England,
where they were protected by Henry. The King
of Scotland, being now arrived at years of majority,
took the government into his own hands; and em|ployed
him&s;elf with great &s;pirit and valour, in repre&s;&s;ing
tho&s;e feuds, ravages, and di&s;orders, which, though they
di&s;turbed the cour&s;e of public ju&s;tice, &s;erved to &s;upport
<PB N="135" REF="147">
the martial &s;pirit of the Scots, and contributed, by that
means, to maintain national independancy. He was de|&s;irous
of renewing the antient league with the French
nation; but finding Francis in clo&s;e union with Eng|land,
and on that account &s;omewhat cold in hearkening
to his propo&s;als, he received the more favourably the ad|vances
of the emperor, who hoped, by means of &s;uch an
ally, to breed di&s;turbance to England. He offered the
Scots King the choice of three prince&s;&s;es, his near rela|tions,
and all of the name of Mary; his &s;i&s;ter the dowa|ger
of Hungary, his niece a daughter of Portugal, or his
cou&s;in the daughter of Henry, whom he pretended to
di&s;po&s;e of unknown to her father. James was more in|clined
to the latter propo&s;al, had it not, upon reflection,
been found impracticable; and his natural propen&s;ity to
France at la&s;t prevailed over all other con&s;iderations.
The alliance with Francis nece&s;&s;arily engaged James to
agree to terms of peace with England. But though in|vited
by his uncle, Henry, to confer with him at New|ca&s;tle,
and concert common mea&s;ures for repre&s;&s;ing the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics in both kingdoms, and &s;haking off the yoke
of Rome, he could not be prevailed with to put him&s;elf
in the King's power. In order to have a pretext for re|fu&s;ing
the conference, he applied to the pope, and ob|tained
a brief, forbidding him to engage in any per&s;onal
negotiations with an enemy of the holy &s;ee. By the&s;e
mea&s;ures, Henry ea&s;ily concluded, that he could very
little depend on the friend&s;hip of his nephew. But tho&s;e
events took not place till &s;ome time after our pre&s;ent
period.</P>

<P>THE antient and almo&s;t uninterrupted oppo&s;ition of
intere&s;t between the laity and clergy in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXI.</NOTE>
and between the Engli&s;h clergy and the court of Rome,
had &s;ufficiently prepared the nation for a breach with the
Roman pontiff;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious principles of the people.</NOTE> and men had penetration enough to
di&s;cover abu&s;es, which were plainly calculated for the
temporal advantages of the hierarchy, and which they
found de&s;tructive of their own. The&s;e &s;ubjects &s;eemed
proportioned to human under&s;tanding; and even the
people, who felt the power of intere&s;t in their own
brea&s;ts, could perceive the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e numerous
inventions, which the intere&s;ted &s;pirit of the &s;overeign
had introduced into religion. But when the
<PB N="137" REF="149">
reformers proceeded thence to di&s;pute concerning the
nature of the &s;acraments, the operations of grace, the
terms of acceptance with the Deity, men were thrown
into amazement, and were, during &s;ome time, at a lo&s;s
how to chu&s;e their party. The profound ignorance,
in which both the clergy and laity formerly lived, and
their freedom from theological altercations, had pro|duced
a &s;incere, but indolent acquie&s;cence in received
opinions; and the multitude were neither attached to
them by topics of reasoning, nor by tho&s;e prejudices
and antipathies again&s;t opponents, which have ever a
more natural and powerful influence over them. As
soon as a new opinion therefore was advanced, &s;up|ported
by &s;uch an authority as to call up their at|tention,
they felt their capacity totally unfitted for &s;uch
di&s;qui&s;itions; and they perpetually fluctuated between
the contending parties. Hence the &s;udden and vio|lent
movements by which the people were agitated,
even in the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite directions: Hence their &s;eem|ing
pro&s;titution in &s;acrificing to pre&s;ent power the
mo&s;t &s;acred principles: And hence the rapid progre&s;s
during &s;ome time, and the &s;udden as well as entire
check given afterwards to the new doctrines. When
men were once &s;ettled in their particular &s;ects, and
had fortified them&s;elves in an habitual dete&s;tation a|gain&s;t
tho&s;e e&s;teemed heretics, they adhered with more
ob&s;tinacy to the principles of their education; and the
limits of the two religions remained thenceforth fixed and
unchangeable.</P>
<P>NOTHING forwarded more the fir&s;t progre&s;s of the
reformers, than the offer, which they made, of &s;ub|mitting
all religious doctrines to private judgment,
and the &s;ummons given every one to examine the
principles formerly impo&s;ed upon him. Though the
multitude were totally unqualified for this undertaking,
<PB N="136" REF="150">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="137" REF="151">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="138" REF="152">
they yet were highly plea&s;ed with it. They fancied
that they were exerci&s;ing their judgment, while they
oppo&s;ed to the prejudices of antient authority more
powerful prejudices of another kind. The novelty it|&s;elf
of the doctrines; the plea&s;ure of an imaginary
triumph in di&s;pute; the &s;ervent zeal of the reformed
preachers; their patience, and even alacrity, in &s;uffering
per&s;ecution, death, and torments; a di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the
restraints of the old religion; an indignation again&s;t
the tyranny and intere&s;ted &s;pirit of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics;
the&s;e motives were prevalent with the people, and by
&s;uch con&s;iderations were men &s;o generally induced
during that age, to throw off the religion of their
ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>BUT in proportion as the practice of &s;ubmitting reli|gion
to private judgment was acceptable to the people,
it appeared in &s;ome re&s;pects, dangerous to the rights of
&s;overeigns, and &s;eemed to de&s;troy that implicit obedience
on which the authority of the civil magi&s;trate is chiefly
founded. The very precedent of &s;haking &s;uch an an|tient
and deep founded e&s;tabli&s;hment as that of the Ro|man
hierarchy might, it was apprehended, prepare
the way for other innovations. The republican &s;pirit,
which naturally took place among the reformers, in|crea&s;ed
this jealou&s;y. The furious in&s;urrections of the
populace, excited by Muncer and other anabapti&s;ts in
Germany<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, $word$ 4. &amp; 5.</NOTE>, furni&s;hed a new pretence for decrying the
reformation. Nor ought we to conclude, becau&s;e Pro|te&s;tants
in our time prove as dutiful &s;ubjects as tho&s;e of
any other religion, that therefore &s;uch apprehen&s;ions
were altogether without any appearance or plau&s;ibility.
Though the liberty of private judgment be tendered to
the di&s;ciples of the reformation, it is not in reality ac|cepted
<PB N="139" REF="153">
of; and men are generally contented to acquie&s;ce
in tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments, however new, into which their
early education has thrown them.</P>
<P>NO prince in Europe was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch ab&s;olute
authority as Henry, not even the pope him&s;elf, in his own
capital, where he united both the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical
powers<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Here are the terms in which the King's mini&s;ter expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the pope. An non, inquam, &s;anctitas ve&s;tra plero&s;que habet qui|bu&s;cum arcanum aliquid crediderit, putet id non minus celatum e&s;&s;e quam &s;i uno tantum pectore contineretur; quod multo magis &s;ereni&s;|&s;imo Angliae Regi evenire debet, cui &s;inguli in &s;uo regno &s;unt &s;ubjecti, neque etiam velint, po&s;&s;unt Regi non e&s;&s;e fideli&s;&s;imi. Vae namque illis, &s;i vel parvo momento ab illius voluntate recederent. Le Grand, tom. III. p. 113. The King once &s;aid publicly before the council, that if any one &s;poke of him or his actions, in terms which became them not, he would let them know, that he was ma&s;ter. Et qu'il n'y $uroit &s;i belle tete qu'il ne fit voler. Id. p. 218.</NOTE>; and there was &s;mall likelihood, that any doc|trine,
which lay under the imputation of encouraging
&s;edition, could ever pretend to his favour and counte|nance.
But be&s;ides this political jealou&s;y,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the King.</NOTE> there was
another rea&s;on which in&s;pired this imperious monarch
with an aver&s;ion to the reformers. He had early de|clared
his &s;entiments again&s;t Luther; and having entered
the li&s;ts in tho&s;e &s;chola&s;tic quarrels, he had received,
from his courtiers and theologians, infinite applau&s;e for
his performance. Elated by this imaginary &s;ucce&s;s, and
blinded by a natural arrogance and ob&s;tinacy of temper,
he had entertained the mo&s;t lofty opinion of his own
erudition, and he received with impatience, mixed with
contempt, any contradiction to his &s;entiments. Luther
al&s;o had been &s;o imprudent, as to treat in a very indecent
manner his royal antagoni&s;t; and though he afterwards
made the humble&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to Henry, and apologized
for the vehemence of his former expre&s;&s;ions, he never
could efface the hatred which the King had conceived
<PB N="140" REF="154">
again&s;t him and his doctrines. The idea of here&s;y &s;till
appeared detectable as well as formidable to that prince;
and whil&s;t his re&s;entment again&s;t the &s;ee of Rome had
removed one con&s;iderable part of his early prejudices, he
had made it a point of honour never to relinqui&s;h the re&s;t.
Separate as he &s;tood from the catholic church, and from
the Roman pontiff, the head of it, he &s;till valued hirn&s;elf
on maintaining the catholic doctrine, and on guarding,
by fire and &s;word, the imagined purity of his &s;peculative
principles.</P>
<P>HENRY'S mini&s;ters and courtiers were of as motley a
character as his conduct;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the mi|ni&s;ters.</NOTE> and &s;eemed to waver, during
this whole reign, between the ancient and the new reli|gion.
The Queen, engaged by intere&s;t as well as incli|nation,
favoured the cau&s;e of the reformers: Cromwel,
who was created &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and who was every
day advancing in the King's confidence, had embraced
the &s;ame views; and as he was a man of prudence and
ability, he was able, very effectually, tho' in a covert
manner, to promote the late innovations: Cranmer,
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, had &s;ecretly adopted the pro|te&s;tant
tenets; and he had gained Henry's friend&s;hip by
his candour and &s;incerity; virtues which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in
as eminent a degree as tho&s;e times, equally di&s;tracted
with faction and oppre&s;&s;ed with tyranny, could ea&s;ily
permit. On the other hand, the duke of Norfolk ad|hered
to the ancient faith; and by the greatne&s;s of his
rank, as well as by his talents, both for peace and war,
he had great weight in the King's council: Gardiner,
lately created bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, had inli&s;ted him&s;elf
in the &s;ame party; and the &s;upplene&s;s of his character,
and the dexterity of his conduct, had rendered him ex|tremely
u&s;eful to it.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e ministers, while they &s;tood in the mo&s;t irre|concileable
oppo&s;ition of principles, were obliged to di&s;|gui&s;e
<PB N="141" REF="155">
their particular opinions, and to pretend an entire
agreement with the &s;entiments of their ma&s;ter. Crom|wel
and Cranmer &s;till carried the appearance of a confor|mity
to the ancient &s;peculative tenets; but they artfully
made u&s;e of Henry's re&s;entment to widen the breach with
the &s;ee of Rome. Norfolk and Gardiner feigned an
a&s;&s;ent to the King's &s;upremacy, and to his renounciation
of the &s;overeign pontiff; but they encouraged his pa&s;&s;ion
for the catholic faith, and in&s;tigated him to puni&s;h tho&s;e
daring heretics, who had pre&s;umed to reject his theologi|cal
principles. Both &s;ides hoped, by their unlimited
compliance, to bring him over to their party: The King
mean while, who held the balance between the factions,
was enabled, by the court&s;hip payed him both by prote&s;|tants
and catholics, to a&s;&s;ume an immea&s;urable authority:
And tho' in all the&s;e mea&s;ures he was really driven by his
ungoverned humour, he ca&s;ually held a cour&s;e, which
led more certainly to arbitrary power, than any which
the mo&s;t profound politics could have traced out to him.
Artifice, refinement, and hypocri&s;y, in his &s;ituation,
would have put both parties on their guard again&s;t him,
and would have taught them re&s;erve in complying with a
monarch, whom, they could never hope thoroughly to
have gained: But while the frankne&s;s, &s;incerity, and
openne&s;s of Henry's temper were generally known, as
well as the dominion of his furious pa&s;&s;ions; each &s;ide
dreaded to lo&s;e him by the &s;malle&s;t oppo&s;ition, and flat|tered
them&s;elves that a blind compliance with his will,
would throw him, cordially and fully, into their in|tere&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE ambiguity of the King's conduct, tho' it kept
the courtiers in awe, &s;erved to encourage the prote&s;tant
doctrine among his &s;ubjects, and promoted that &s;pirit of
innovation with which the age was generally &s;eized, and
which nothing but an entire uniformity, as well as a
<PB N="142" REF="156">
&s;teady &s;everity in the admini&s;tration, could be able to
repre&s;s. There were &s;ome Engli&s;hmen, Tindal, Joye,
Con&s;tantine, and others, who, dreading the exertion of
the King's authority, had fled to Antwerp<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 159.</NOTE>; where the
great privileges po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Low Country provinces,
&s;erved, during &s;ome time, to give them protection.
The&s;e men employed them&s;elves in writing books,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther progre&s;s of the refor|mation</NOTE> in
Engli&s;h, again&s;t the corruptions of the church of Rome;
again&s;t images, reliques, pilgrimages; and they excited
the curio&s;ity of men with regard to that que&s;tion, the
mo&s;t important in theology, the terms of acceptance with
the Supreme Being. In conformity to the Lutherans
and other prote&s;tants, they a&s;&s;erted, that &s;alvation was
obtained by faith alone; and that the mo&s;t infallible road
to perdition<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sacrilegium e&s;t et impietas velle placere Deo per opera &amp; non per &s;olam Fidem. <HI>Luther adver&s;us regem.</HI> Ita vides quam dives &s;it homo chri&s;tianus &s;ive baptizatus, qui etiam volens non pote&s;t perdere &s;alutem &s;uam quanti&s;cunque peccatis.

terms they under&s;tood, as well the moral duties, as the
ceremonial and mona&s;tic ob&s;ervances. The defenders of
the ancient religion, on the other hand, maintained the
efficacy of <HI>good works;</HI> but tho' they did not exclude from
this appellation the &s;ocial virtues, it was &s;till the &s;uper|&s;titions,
gainful to the church, which they chiefly ex|tolled
and recommended. The books, compo&s;ed by
the&s;e fugitives, having &s;tole over to England, began to
make converts every where; but it was a tran&s;lation of
the &s;criptures by Tindal, that was e&s;teemed mo&s;t dange|rous
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed faith. The fir&s;t edition of this
work, compo&s;ed with little accuracy, was found liable
to con&s;iderable objections; and Tindal, who was poor,
and could not afford to lo&s;e a great part of the impre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="143" REF="157">
was longing for an opportunity of correcting his errors,
of which he had been made &s;en&s;ible. Ton&s;tal, then bi|&s;hop
of London, &s;oon after of Durham, a man of great
moderation, being de&s;irous to di&s;courage, in the gentle&s;t
manner, the&s;e innovations, gave private orders for buying
up all the copies, which could be found at Antwerp; and
he burnt them publicly in Cheap&s;ide. By this contri|vance,
he &s;upplied Tindal with money, enabled him to
print a new and correct edition of his work, and gave
occa&s;ion to great &s;candal and reproach, in thus commit|ting
to the flames the word of God<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hall. fol. 186. Fox, vol. i. p. 138. Burnet, vol. i. p. 159.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ciples of the reformation met with little &s;eve|rity
during the mini&s;try of Wol&s;ey, who, tho' him&s;elf a
clergyman, bore too &s;mall regard to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical or|der,
to &s;erve as an in&s;trument of their tyranny: It was
even an article of impeachment again&s;t him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Articles of impeachment in Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>, that by his
connivance he had encouraged the growth of here&s;y, and
that he had protected and acquitted &s;ome notorious of|fenders.
Sir Thomas More,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Thomas More</NOTE> who &s;ucceeded Wol&s;ey as
chancellor, is at once an object de&s;erving our compa&s;&s;ion,
and an in&s;tance of the u&s;ual progre&s;s of men's &s;entiments
during that age. This man, who&s;e elegant genius and
familiar acquaintance with the noble &s;pirit of antiquity,
had given him very enlarged &s;entiments, and who had in
his early years advanced principles, which even at pre|&s;ent
would be deemed &s;omewhat libertine, had, in the
cour&s;e of events, been &s;o irritated by polemics, and
thrown into &s;uch a &s;uper&s;titious attachment to the ancient
faith, that few inqui&s;itors have been guilty of greater vio|lence
in their pro&s;ecutions of here&s;y. Tho' adorned with
the gentle&s;t manners, as well as the pure&s;t integrity, he
carried to the utmo&s;t height his aver&s;ion to heterodoxy;
and James Bainham, in particular, a gentleman of the
<PB N="144" REF="158">
Temple, experienced from him the highe&s;t &s;everity.
Bainham, accu&s;ed of favouring the new opinions, was
carried to More's hou&s;e, and having refu&s;ed to di&s;cover
his accomplices, the chancellor ordered him to be whipt
in his pre&s;ence, and afterwards &s;ent him to the Tower,
where he him&s;elf &s;aw him put to the torture The un|happy
gentleman, overcome by all the&s;e &s;everities, ab|jured
his opinions; but feeling afterwards the deepe&s;t
compunction for this apo&s;tacy, he openly returned to his
former tenets, and even courted the crown of martyr|dom.
He was condemned as an ob&s;tinate and relap&s;ed
heretic, and was burned in Smithfield<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fox. Burnet, vol. i. p. 165.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY were brought into the bi&s;hops courts for of|fences,
which appear very trivial, but which were re|garded
as &s;ymbols of the party: Some for teaching their
children the Lord's prayer in Engli&s;h; others for reading
the new te&s;tament in that language, or for &s;peaking again&s;t
pilgrimages. To harbour the per&s;ecuted preachers, to ne|glect
the fa&s;ts of the church, to declaim again&s;t the vices
of the clergy, were capital offences. One Thomas Bilney,
a prie&s;t, who had embraced the new doctrine, had been
terrified into an abjuration; but was &s;o haunted by re|mor&s;e,
that his friends dreaded &s;ome fatal effects of his
de&s;pair. At la&s;t, his mind &s;eemed to be more compo&s;ed;
but this appearing calm proceeded only from the re&s;olution
which he had taken, of expiating his pa&s;t offence, by an
open confe&s;&s;ion of the truth, and by dying a martyr to it.
He went thro' Norfolk, teaching every where the people
to beware of idolatry, and of tru&s;ting either to pilgri|mages,
or to the cowle of St. Francis to the prayers of
the &s;aints, or to images. He was &s;oon &s;eized, tried in
the bi&s;hop's court, and condemned as a relap&s;ed heretic;
and the writ was &s;ent down to burn him. When brought
<PB N="145" REF="159">
to the &s;take, he di&s;covered &s;uch patience, fortitude, and
devotion, that the &s;pectators were much affected with the
horrors of his puni&s;hment; and &s;ome mendicant friars,
who were pre&s;ent, fearing that his death would be im|puted
to them, and make them lo&s;e tho&s;e alms, which
they received from the charity of the people, de&s;ired him
publicly to acquit them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 164.</NOTE> of having any hand in his
death. He very willingly complied; and by this meek|ne&s;s
gained the more on the &s;ympathy of the people. An|other
per&s;on, &s;till more heroic, being brought to the &s;take
for denying the real pre&s;ence &s;eemed almo&s;t in a tran&s;port
of joy; and he tenderly embraced the faggots, which
were to be the instruments of his puni&s;hment, as the
means of procuring him eternal re&s;t. In &s;hort, the tide
turning towards the new doctrine, tho&s;e &s;evere execu|tions,
which, in another disposition of men's minds,
would have &s;ufficed to &s;uppre&s;s it, now &s;erved only the
more to diffu&s;e it among the people, and to in&s;pire them
with horror again&s;t the unrelenting per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Henry neglected not to puni&s;h the prote&s;tant
doctrine, which he e&s;teemed here&s;y, his mo&s;t formidable
enemies, he knew, were the zealous adherents to the an|cient
religion, chiefly the monks, who, having their im|mediate
dependance on the Roman pontiff, apprehended
their own ruin to be the certain con&s;equence of aboli&s;hing
his authority in England. Peyto, a friar, preaching
before the King, had the a&s;&s;urance to tell him, &startq;That
many lying prophets had deceived him, but he, as a
true Micajah, warned him, that the dogs would lick
his blood, as they had done Ahab's<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 167</NOTE>.&endq; The King
took no notice of this in&s;ult; but allowed the preacher
to depart in peace. Next Sunday, he employed Dr.
Corren to preach before him; who ju&s;tified the King's
Proceedings, and gave Peyto the appellations of a rebel,
<PB N="146" REF="160">
a &s;landerer, a dog, and a traytor. El&s;ton, another friar
of the &s;ame hou&s;e, interrupted the preacher; and told
him, that he was one of the lying prophets, who &s;ought
to e&s;tabli&s;h by adultery the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown; but
that he him&s;elf would ju&s;tify all that Peyto had &s;aid.
Henry &s;ilenced this petulant friar; but &s;howed no other
mark of re&s;entment than ordering Peyto and him to be
&s;ummoned before the council, and to be rebuked for their
offence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 86. Burnet, vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>. He even here bore patiently &s;ome new in&s;tances
of their ob&s;tinacy and arrogance. For when the earl of
E&s;&s;ex, a privy coun&s;ellor, told them, that they de&s;erved
for their offence to be thrown into the Thames; El&s;ton
replied, that the road to heaven lay as near by water as
by land<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 562.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT &s;everal monks were detected in a con&s;piracy,
which, as it might have proved more dangerous to the
King, was on its di&s;covery attended with more fatal con|&s;equences
to them&s;elves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Maid of Kent.</NOTE> Elizabeth Barton, of Alding|ton
in Kent, commonly called the <HI>holy Maid of Kent,</HI>
had been &s;ubject to hy&s;terical fits, which threw her body
into unu&s;ual convul&s;ions; and having produced an equal
di&s;order in her mind, made her utter &s;trange &s;ayings,
which, as &s;he was &s;carce con&s;cious of them during the
time, had &s;oon after entirely e&s;caped her memory. The
&s;illy people in the neighbourhood were &s;truck with the&s;e
appearances, which they imagined to be &s;upernatural;
and Richard Ma&s;ters, vicar of the pari&s;h, a de&s;igning fel|low,
founded on them a project, by which he hoped to
draw both profit and con&s;ideration to him&s;elf. He went
to Warham, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was at
that time alive; and having given him an account of
Elizabeth's revelations, he &s;o far wrought on that pru|dent,
but &s;uper&s;titious prelate, as to receive orders from
<PB N="147" REF="161">
him to watch her in her trances, and to note down care|fully
all her future &s;peeches. The regard paid her by a
per&s;on of &s;o high a rank, &s;oon rendered her &s;till more
the object of attention to the neighbourhood; and it was
ea&s;y for Ma&s;ters to per&s;uade them, as well as the maid
her&s;elf, that her ravings were in&s;pirations of the Holy
Gho&s;t. Knavery, as is u&s;ual, &s;oon after &s;ucceeding to
illu&s;ion, &s;he learned to counterfeit trances; and &s;he then
uttered, in an extraordinary tone of voice &s;uch &s;peeches
as were dictated to her by her &s;piritual director Ma&s;|ters
a&s;&s;ociated with him Dr. Bocking, a canon of Can|terbury;
and their de&s;ign was to rai&s;e the credit of an
image of the virgin, which &s;tood in a chapel belonging
to Ma&s;ters and to draw &s;uch pilgrimages to it as u&s;ually
frequented the more famous images and reliques. In
pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, Elizabeth pretended revela|tions,
which directed her to have recour&s;e to that image
for a cure; and being brought before it, in the pre&s;ence
of a great multitude, &s;he fell anew into convul&s;ions; and
after di&s;torting her limbs and countenance during a com|petent
time, &s;he affected to have obtained a perfect re|covery
by the interce&s;&s;ion of the virgin<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 570. Blanquet's Epitome of chronicles.</NOTE>. This miracle
was &s;oon bruited abroad; and the two prie&s;ts, finding
the impo&s;ture to &s;ucceed beyond their own expectations,
began to extend their views, and to lay the foundation
of more important enterprizes. They taught their peni|tent
to declaim again&s;t the new doctrines, which &s;he de|nominated
here&s;y; again&s;t innovations in eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal

Catherine. She went &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, that, if he pro|&s;ecuted
that de&s;ign, and married another, he &s;hould not
be a King a month longer, and &s;hould not an hour
longer po&s;&s;e&s;s the favour of the Almighty, but &s;hould die

either from folly, or roguery, or from faction,
which is often a complication of both, entered into this
delu&s;ion; and one Deering, a friar, wrote a book of the
revelations and prophecies of Elizabeth<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 181.</NOTE>. Miracles were
daily added, to encrea&s;e the wonder; and the pulpit
every where re&s;ounded with accounts of the &s;anctity and
in&s;pirations of this new prophete&s;s. Me&s;&s;ages were car|ried
from her to Queen Catherine, by which that prin|ce&s;s
was exhorted to per&s;i&s;t in her oppo&s;ition to the di|vorce;
the pope's amba&s;&s;adors gave encouragement to the
popular credulity; and even Fi&s;her, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter,
tho' a man of &s;en&s;e and learning, was carried away with
an opinion &s;o favourable to the party, which he had
embraced<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 87.</NOTE>. The King at la&s;t began to think the mat|ter
worthy of his attention; and having ordered Eliza|beth
and her accomplices to be arre&s;ted, he brought them
before the &s;tar-chamber, where they freely, without
being put to the torture, made confe&s;&s;ion of their guilt.
The Parliament, in the &s;e&s;&s;ion held the beginning of this
year, pa&s;&s;ed an act of attainder again&s;t &s;ome who were
engaged in this trea&s;onable impo&s;ture<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 12. Burnet, vol. i. p. 149. Hall, fol. 220.</NOTE>; and Elizabeth
her&s;elf, Ma&s;ters, Bocking, Deering, Rich, Ri&s;by, Gold,
&s;uffered for their crime. The bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, Abel,
Addi&s;on, Laurence, and &s;ome others, were condemned
for mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on; becau&s;e they had not di&s;covered
&s;ome criminal &s;peeches which they heard from Eliza|beth<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Godwin's Annals, p. 53.</NOTE>: And they were thrown into pri&s;on. The better
to undeceive the multitude, the forgery of many of the
prophete&s;s's miracles was detected; and even, the &s;can|dalous
pro&s;titution of her manners was laid open to the
public. Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;o naturally in&s;inuate
them&s;elves amid&s;t the warm intimacies maintained by the
<PB N="149" REF="165">
devotees of different &s;exes, had taken place between Eli|zabeth
and her confederates; and it was found, that a
door to her dormitory, which was &s;aid to have been mi|raculou&s;ly
opened, in order to give her acce&s;s to the
chapel, for the &s;ake of frequent conver&s;e with heaven,
had been contrived by Bocking and Ma&s;ters for le&s;s re|fined
purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE detection of an impo&s;ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1535.</NOTE> attended with &s;o many
odious circum&s;tances, hurt much the credit of the eccle|&s;ia&s;tics,
particularly of the monks, and in&s;tigated the
King to take vengeance on them. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed three
mona&s;teries of the Ob&s;ervantine friars; and finding that
little clamour was excited by this act of power, he was
the more encouraged to lay his rapacious hands on the
re&s;t. Meanwhile, he exerci&s;ed puni&s;hment on indivi|duals,
who were obnoxious to him. The Parliament
had made it trea&s;on to endeavour the depriving the King
of his dignity or titles: They had lately added to his
other titles, that of &s;upreme head of the church: It was
inferred, that to deny his &s;upremacy was trea&s;on; and
many priors and eccle&s;ia&s;tics lo&s;t their lives for this new
&s;pecies of crime. It was certainly a high in&s;tance of
tyranny to make the mere delivery of a political opinion,
e&s;pecially one that nowi&s;e affected the King's temporal
right, to be a capital offence, tho' attended with no overt
act; and the Parliament, in pa&s;&s;ing this law, had over|looked
all the principles by which a civilized, much more
a free people, &s;hould be governed: But the violence of
changing &s;o &s;uddenly the whole &s;y&s;tem of government,
and the making it trea&s;on to deny what, during many
ages, it had been here&s;y to a&s;&s;ert, is an event which may
appear &s;omewhat extraordinary. Even the &s;tern unre|lenting
mind of Henry was, at fir&s;t, &s;hocked with the&s;e
&s;anguinary mea&s;ures; and he went &s;o far as to change
<PB N="150" REF="166">
his garb and dre&s;s, pretending &s;orrow for the nece&s;&s;ity,
by which he was pu&s;hed to &s;uch extremities. Still im|pelled,
however, by his violent temper, and de&s;irous of
&s;triking a terror into the whole nation, he proceeded, by
making examples of Fi&s;her and More, to con&s;ummate
his lawle&s;s tyranny.</P>
<P>JOHN Fi&s;her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and execution of Fi&s;her, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter.</NOTE> bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, was a prelate,
eminent for his learning and morals, no le&s;s than for his
eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities, and for the high favour which he
had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the King. When he was thrown
into pri&s;on, on account of his refu&s;ing the oath of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
and his concealment of Elizabeth Barton's trea|sonable
&s;peeches, he had not only been deprived of all
his revenues, but &s;tripped of his very cloaths, and, with|out
con&s;ideration of his extremeage, was allowed nothing
but rags, which &s;carce &s;ufficed to cover his nakedne&s;s<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">$uller's Church Hi&s;t. book 5. p. 203.</NOTE>.
In this condition, he lay in pri&s;on above a twelvemonth;
when the pope, willing to recompen&s;e the &s;ufferings of
&s;o faithful an adherent, created him a cardinal; tho'
Fi&s;her was &s;o carele&s;s of that dignity, that even if the
purple were lying on the ground, he declared that he
would not &s;toop to take it. This promotion of a man,
merely for his oppo&s;ition to royal authority, rouzed the
indignation of the King; and he re&s;olved to make the
innocent per&s;on feel the effects of his re&s;entment. Fi&s;her
was indicted for denying the King's &s;upremacy, was
tried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d June.</NOTE> condemned, and beheaded.</P>
<P>THE execution of this prelate was intended as a warn|ing
to More,<NOTE PLACE="marg">O$ Sir Tho|mas More.</NOTE> who&s;e compliance, on account of his great
authority both abroad and at home, and his high repu|tation
for learning and virtue, was anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired by
the King. That prince al&s;o bore as great per&s;onal affec|tion
and regard to More, as his imperious mind, the
&s;port of pa&s;&s;ions, was &s;u&s;ceptible of towards a man, who
<PB N="151" REF="167">
in any particular oppo&s;ed his violent inclination. But
More could never be prevailed on to acknowledge any
opinion &s;o contrary to his principles as that of the King's
&s;upremacy; and tho' Henry exacted that compliance
from the whole nation, there was, as yet, no law oblig|ing
any one to take an oath to that purpo&s;e. Rich, the
&s;olicitor general, was &s;ent to confer with More, then a
pri&s;oner, who kept a cautious &s;ilence with regard to the
&s;upremacy: He was only inveigled to &s;ay, that any
que&s;tion with regard to the law, which e&s;tabli&s;hed that
prerogative, was like a two-edged &s;word: If a per&s;on an|&s;wer
one way, it will confound his &s;oul; if another, it
will de&s;troy his body. No more was wanted to found an
indictment of high trea&s;on again&s;t the pri&s;oner. His
&s;ilence was called malicious, and made a part of his
crime; and the&s;e words, which had ca&s;ually dropped
from him, were interpreted as a denial of the &s;upremacy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">More's Life of Sir Thomas More. Herbert, p. 393.</NOTE>.
Trials were mere formalities during this reign: The
jury gave &s;entence again&s;t More, who had long expected
this fate, and who needed no preparation to fortify him
again&s;t the terrors of death. Not only his con&s;tancy,
but even his cheerfulne&s;s, nay, his u&s;ual facetiou&s;ne&s;s,
never for&s;ook him; and he made a &s;acrifice of his life to
his integrity with the &s;ame indifference that he maintained
in any ordinary occurrence. When he was mounting
the &s;caffold, he &s;aid to one, &startq;Friend, help me up, and
when I go down again let me &s;hift for my&s;elf.&endq; The
executioner a&s;king him forgivene&s;s, he granted the re|que&s;t,
but told him, &startq;You will never get credit by be|heading,
me, my neck is &s;o &s;hort.&endq; Then laying his
head on the block, he bid the executioner &s;tay till he put
a&s;ide his beard: &startq;For,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;it never committed
trea&s;on.&endq; Nothing was wanting to the glory of this
end, except a better cau&s;e, more free from weakne&s;s and
<PB N="152" REF="168">
&s;uper&s;tition. But as the man followed his principles and
&s;en&s;e of duty, however mi&s;guided, his con&s;tancy and in|tegrity
are equally objects of our admiration. He was
beheaded in the fifty-third year of his age.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th July.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN the execution of Fi&s;her and More was reported
at Rome, e&s;pecially that of the former, who was inve&s;ted
with the dignity of cardinal, every one di&s;covered the
mo&s;t violent rage again&s;t the King; and numerous libels
were publi&s;hed, by the wits and orators of Italy, com|paring
him to Caligula, Nero, Domitian, and all the
mo&s;t unrelenting tyrants of antiquity. Clement the &s;e|venth
had died about &s;ix months after he pronounced
&s;entence again&s;t the King; and Paul the third, of the
name of Farne&s;e, had &s;ucceeded to the papal throne.
This pontiff, who had always favoured Henry's cau&s;e
while a cardinal, had hoped, that, per&s;onal animo&s;ities
being buried with his predece&s;&s;or, it might not be im|po&s;&s;ible
to form an agreement with England: And Hen|ry
him&s;elf was &s;o de&s;irous of accommodating matters,
that in a negotiation, which he entered into with Francis
little before this time, he required, that that monarch
&s;hould conciliate a friend&s;hip between him and the court
of Rome. But Henry was accu&s;tomed to pre&s;cribe, not
to receive terms; and even while he was negotiating
peace, his u&s;ual violence often carried him to commit
offences, which rendered the quarrel totally incurable.
The execution of Fi&s;her was regarded by Paul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Aug.</NOTE> as &s;o
capital an injury, that he immediately pa&s;&s;ed cen&s;ures
again&s;t the King, citing him and all his adherents to ap|pear
in Rome within ninety days, in order to an&s;wer for
their crimes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">King ex|communi|cated.</NOTE> If they failed, he excommunicated them;
deprived the King of his realm; &s;ubjected the kingdom
to an interdict; declared his i&s;&s;ue by Anne Boleyn illegi|timate;
di&s;&s;olved all leagues which any catholic princes
had made with him; gave his kingdom to any invader;
<PB N="153" REF="169">
commanded the nobility to take arms again&s;t him; freed
his &s;ubjects from all oaths of allegiance; cut off their
commerce with foreign, &s;tates; and declared it lawful for
any one to &s;eize them, to make &s;laves of their per&s;ons,
and to convert their effects to his own u&s;e<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sanders, p. 148.</NOTE>. But tho'
the&s;e cen&s;ures were pa&s;&s;ed, they were not at that time
openly denounced: The pope delayed the publication,
till he &s;hould find an agreement with England entirely
de&s;perate; and till the emperor, who was at pre&s;ent
pre&s;&s;ed by the Turks and the prote&s;tant princes in Ger|many,
&s;hould be in a condition to carry the &s;entence into execution.</P>
<P>THE King knew, that he might expect any injury,
which it &s;hould be in Charles's power to inflict; and he
therefore made it the chief object of his policy to incapa|citate
that monarch from wreaking his re&s;entment upon
him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 350, 351.</NOTE>. He renewed his friend&s;hip with Francis, and
opened negotiations for marrying his infant-daughter,
Elizabeth, with the duke of Angouleme, third &s;on of
Francis. The&s;e two princes al&s;o made advances to the
prote&s;tant league in Germany, who were ever jealous of
the emperor's ambition: And Henry, be&s;ides remitting
them &s;ome money, &s;ent Fox, bi&s;hop of Hereford, as
Francis did Bellay, lord of Langey, to treat with tho&s;e
princes. But during the fir&s;t fervours of the reformation,
an agreement in theological tenets was held, as well as
an union of intere&s;t, to be e&s;&s;ential to a good corre&s;pon|dence
among &s;tates; and tho' both Francis and Henry
flattered the German princes with hopes of their em|bracing
the confe&s;&s;ion of Au&s;bourg, it was looked upon
as a bad &s;ymptom of their &s;incerity, that they exerci&s;ed
&s;uch extreme rigour again&s;t all preachers of the reforma|tion
in their re&s;pective dominions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, lib. 10.</NOTE>. Henry carried the
<PB N="154" REF="170">
feint &s;o far, that, while he thought him&s;elf the fir&s;t theo|logian
in the world, he yet invited over Melancthon,
Bucer, Sturmius, Draco, and other German divines,
in order to confer with him, and to in&s;truct him in the
foundation of their tenets. The&s;e theologians were now
of great importance in the world; and no poet or philo|&s;opher,
even in antient Greece, where they were treated
with mo&s;t re&s;pect had ever reached equal applau&s;e and
admiration with the&s;e wretched compo&s;ers of metaphy&s;ical
polemics. The German princes told the King, that
they could not &s;pare their divines; and as Henry had no
hopes of agreement with &s;uch zealous di&s;putants, and
knew that in Germany the followers of Luther would
not a&s;&s;ociate with the di&s;ciples of Zuinglius, becau&s;e,
tho' they agreed in every thing el&s;e, they differed in &s;ome
particulars with regard to the euchari&s;t, he was the more
indifferent on account of this refu&s;al. He could al&s;o
fore&s;ee, that even while the league of Smalcalde did not
act in concert with him, they would always be carried
by their intere&s;t to oppo&s;e the emperor: And the hatred
between Francis and that monarch was &s;o inveterate,
that he deemed him&s;elf &s;ure of a &s;incere ally in one or
other of the&s;e potentates.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e negotiations an incident happened in
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1536.</NOTE> which promi&s;ed a more amicable conclu&s;ion of
the&s;e di&s;putes, and &s;eemed even to open a way for a re|concilement
between Henry and Charles. Queen Ca|therine
was &s;eized with a lingering illne&s;s, which at la&s;t
brought her to her grave:<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Jan.</NOTE> She died at Kimbolton in the
county of Huntingdon, in the fiftieth year of her age.
A little before &s;he expired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Queen Ca|therine.</NOTE> &s;he wrote a very tender letter
to the King; where &s;he gave him the appellation of <HI>her
mo&s;t dear Lord King, and Hu&s;band.</HI> She told him, that
as the hour of her death was now approaching, &s;he laid
<PB N="155" REF="171">
hold of this la&s;t opportunity to inculcate on him the im|portance
of his religious duty, and the comparative empti|ne&s;s
of all human grandeur and enjoyment: That tho' his
fondne&s;s towards the&s;e peri&s;hing advantages had thrown
her into many calamities, as well as created to him&s;elf
much trouble, &s;he yet forgave him all pa&s;t injuries, and
hoped that this pardon would be ratified in heaven: And
that &s;he had no other reque&s;t to make, but to recommend
to him his daughter, the &s;ole pledge of their loves, and
to crave his protection for her maids and &s;ervants. She
concluded with the&s;e words, <HI>I make this vow, that mine
eyes de&s;ire you above all things</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 403.</NOTE>. The King was touched,
even to the &s;hedding of tears, by this la&s;t tender proof of
Catherine's affection; but Queen Anne is &s;aid to have
expre&s;&s;ed her joy for the death of a rival beyond what
decency or humanity could permit<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 192.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE emperor thought, that as the decea&s;e of his aunt
had removed all foundation for per&s;onal animo&s;ity between
him and Henry, it might not now be impo&s;&s;ible to de|tach
him from the alliance of France, and renew that
confederacy with England from which he had formerly
reaped &s;o much advantage. He &s;ent Henry propo&s;als for
a return to antient amity, upon the&s;e conditions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Du Bellay, liv. 5. Herbert. Burnet, vol. iii. in Coll. N^o 50.</NOTE>; that
he &s;hould be reconciled to the pope, that he &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t
him in his war with the Turk, and that he &s;hould take
party with him again&s;t Francis, who now threatened the
dutchy of Milan. The King replied, that he was wil|ling
to be on good terms with the emperor, provided he
would acknowledge, that the former breach of friend&s;hip
came entirely from him&s;elf: As to the conditions pro|po&s;ed;
the proceedings again&s;t the bi&s;hop of Rome were
&s;o ju&s;t, and &s;o fully ratified by the Parliament of Eng|land,
that they could not now be revoked; when chri&s;|tian
<PB N="156" REF="172">
princes &s;hould have &s;ettled peace among them&s;elves,
he would not fail to exert that vigour, which became
him, again&s;t the enemies of the faith; and after amity
with the emperor was once fully re&s;tored, he would then
be in a &s;ituation, as a common friend both to him and
Francis, either to mediate an agreement between them,
or to a&s;&s;i&s;t the injured party.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered Henry more indifferent to the ad|vances
made by the emperor, was his experience of the
u&s;ual duplicity and in&s;incerity of that monarch, and the
intelligence which he received of the pre&s;ent tran&s;actions
in Europe. Francis Sforza, duke of Milan, was dead
without i&s;&s;ue; and the emperor maintained, that the
dutchy, being a fief of the empire, was devolved to him,
as the head of the Germanic body: Not to give um|brage,
however, to the &s;tates of Italy, he pro&s;e&s;&s;ed his
intention of be&s;towing that principality on &s;ome prince,
who &s;hould be obnoxious to no party, and he even made
offer of it to the duke of Angouleme, third &s;on to Francis.
The French monarch, who pretended that his own right
to Milan was now revived upon Sforza's death, was con|tented
to &s;ub&s;titute his &s;econd &s;on, the duke of Orleans,
in his place; and the emperor pretended to clo&s;e with this
propo&s;al. But his &s;ole intention in that liberal conce&s;|&s;ion
was to gain time, till he &s;hould put him&s;elf in a
warlike po&s;ture, and be able to carry an inva&s;ion into
Francis's dominions. The antient enmity between the&s;e
princes broke out anew in bravadoes, and in per&s;onal in|&s;ults
on each other, not becoming per&s;ons of their rank,
and &s;till le&s;s &s;uitable to men of &s;uch unque&s;tioned bravery.
Charles &s;oon after invaded Provence in per&s;on, with an
army of fifty thou&s;and men; but met with no &s;ucce&s;s.
His army peri&s;hed with &s;ickne&s;s, fatigue, famine, and
other di&s;a&s;ters; and he was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of
Mar&s;eilles, and retire into Italy with the broken remains
<PB N="157" REF="173">
of his forces. An army of imperiali&s;ts, near 30,000
&s;trong, which invaded France on the &s;ide of the Nether|lands,
and laid &s;iege to Peronne, made no greater pro|gre&s;s,
but retired upon the approach of a French army.
And Henry had thus the &s;atisfaction to find, both that
his ally, Francis, was likely to &s;upport him&s;elf without
foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that his own tranquillity was fully
en&s;ured by the&s;e violent wars and animo&s;ities on the con|tinent.</P>
<P>IF any inquietude remained with the Engli&s;h court, it
was &s;olely occa&s;ioned by the &s;tate of affairs in Scotland.
James, hearing of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of his ally,
Francis, very generou&s;ly levied &s;ome forces; and em|barking
them on board ve&s;&s;els, which he had hired for
that purpo&s;e, landed them &s;afely in France. He even
came over in per&s;on; and making ha&s;te to join the French
King's camp, which then lay in Provence, and to par|take
of his danger, he met that prince at Lyons, who,
having repul&s;ed the emperor's inva&s;ion, was now return|ing
to his capital. Recommended by &s;o agreeable and
&s;ea&s;onable an in&s;tance of friend&s;hip, the King of Scots
made &s;uit to Magdalen, daughter of the French mo|narch,
who had no other &s;cruple in agreeing to the match,
than what was derived from the infirm &s;tate of his daugh|ter's
health, which &s;eemed to threaten her with an ap|proaching
end. But James having gained the affections
of the prince&s;s, and obtained her con&s;ent, the father
would no longer oppo&s;e the united de&s;ires of his daughter
and friend; and they were accordingly married, and &s;oon
after &s;et &s;ail for Scotland, where the young Queen, as
was fore&s;een, died in a little time after her arrival.
Francis, however, was afraid, le&s;t his ally, Henry,
whom he likewi&s;e looked on as his friend, and who lived
with him on a more cordial footing than is u&s;ual among
great princes, &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed that this clo&s;e confe|deracy
<PB N="158" REF="174">
between France and Scotland was concluded with|out
his participation. He therefore di&s;patched Pomme|raye
to London, in order to apologize for this mea&s;ure;
but Henry, with his u&s;ual openne&s;s and freedom, expre&s;&s;ed
&s;uch di&s;plea&s;ure, that he refu&s;ed even to confer with the
amba&s;&s;ador; and Francis was apprehen&s;ive of a rupture
with a prince, who regulated his mea&s;ures more by hu|mour
and pa&s;&s;ion than by the rules of political prudence.
But Henry was &s;o fettered by the oppo&s;ition, in which
he was engaged again&s;t the pope and the emperor, that
he pur&s;ued no farther this di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t Francis; and in
the end every thing remained in tranquillity both on the
&s;ide of France and Scotland.</P>
<P>THE dome&s;tic peace of England &s;eemed to be expo&s;ed
to more hazard, by the violent innovations in religion;
and it may be affirmed, that, in this dangerous conjunc|ture,
nothing en&s;ured public tranquillity &s;o much as the
deci&s;ive authority acquired by the King, and his great
a&s;cendant over all his &s;ubjects. Not only the devotion
paid to the crown, was profound during that age: The
per&s;onal re&s;pect, in&s;pired by Henry, was con&s;iderable;
and even the terrors, with which he over-awed every
one, were not attended with any con&s;iderable degree of
hatred. His frankne&s;s, his &s;incerity, his magnificence,
his genero&s;ity, were virtues which counterbalanced his
violence, cruelty, and impetuo&s;ity. And the important
rank, which his vigour, more than addre&s;s, acquired him
in all foreign negotiations, flattered the vanity of Engli&s;h|men,
and made them the more willingly endure tho&s;e
dome&s;tic hard&s;hips, to which they were expo&s;ed. The
King, con&s;cious of his advantages, was now proceeding
to the mo&s;t dangerous trial of his authority; and after
paving the way for that mea&s;ure by &s;everal expedients,
he was at la&s;t determined to &s;uppre&s;s the mona&s;teries, and
to put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ample revenues.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="175">
THE great encrea&s;e of mona&s;teries, if matters be con|&s;idered
merely in a political light, will appear the radical
inconvenience of the catholic religion; and every other
di&s;advantage, attending that communion, &s;eems to have
an in&s;eparable connection with the&s;e religious in&s;titutions.
Papal u&s;urpations, the tyranny of the inqui&s;ition, the
multiplication of holidays; all the&s;e fetters on liberty
and indu&s;try, were ultimately derived from the authority
and in&s;inuation of monks, who&s;e habitations, being e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
every where, proved &s;o many colonies of &s;uper|&s;tition
and of folly. This order of men were extremely
enraged again&s;t Henry; and regarded the abolition of the
papal authority in England, as the removal of the &s;ole
protection which they enjoyed again&s;t the rapacity of the
crown and of the courtiers. They were now &s;ubjected
to the King's vi&s;itation; the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;acredne&s;s of their
bulls from Rome was rejected; the progre&s;s of the refor|mation
abroad, which had every where been attended
with the abolition of the mona&s;tic &s;tate, gave them rea|&s;on
to expect like con&s;equences in England; and tho' the
King &s;till maintained the doctrine of purgatory, to which
mo&s;t of the convents owed their origin and &s;upport, it
was fore&s;een, that, in the progre&s;s of the conte&s;t, he
would every day be led to depart wider from antient in|&s;titutions,
and be drawn nearer the tenets of the refor|mers,
with whom his political intere&s;ts naturally induced
him to ally him&s;elf. Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, the
f$iars made u&s;e of all their influence to enflame the peo|ple
again&s;t the King's government; and Henry, finding
their &s;afety irreconcilable with his own, was determined
to &s;eize the pre&s;ent opportunity, and utterly de&s;troy his
declared enemies.</P>
<P>CROMWEL, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, had been appointed
vicar-general, or vicegerent, a new office, by which the
King's &s;upremacy, or the ab&s;olute, uncontroulable power
<PB N="160" REF="176">
a&s;&s;umed over the church, was delegated to him. He
employed Layton, London, Price, Gage, Petre, Bella|&s;is,
and others, as commi&s;&s;ioners, who carried on, every
where, a rigorous enquiry with regard to the conduct
and deportment of all the friars. During times of fac|tion,
e&s;pecially of the religious kind, no equity is to be
expected from adver&s;aries; and as it was known, that
the King's intention in this vi&s;itation was to find a pre|tence
for aboli&s;hing mona&s;teries, we may naturally con|clude,
that the reports of the commi&s;&s;ioners are very
little to be relied on. Friars were encouraged to bring
in informations again&s;t their brethren; the &s;lighte&s;t evi|dence
was credited; and even the calumnies &s;pread abroad
by the friends to the reformation, were regarded as
grounds of proof. Mon&s;trous di&s;orders are therefore &s;aid
to have been found in many of the religious hou&s;es:
Whole convents of women abandoned to lewdne&s;s:
Signs of abortions procured, of infants murdered, of un|natural
lu&s;ts between per&s;ons of the &s;ame &s;ex. It is in|deed
probable, that the blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the people,
during tho&s;e ages, would render the friars and nuns more
unguarded, and more di&s;&s;olute, than they are in any
roman catholic country at pre&s;ent: But &s;till, the re|proaches,
which it is &s;afe&s;t to credit, are &s;uch as point
at vices, naturally connected with the very in&s;titution of
convents, and with the mona&s;tic life. The cruel and in|veterate
factions and quarrels therefore which the com|mi&s;&s;ioners
mentioned, are very credible, among men,
who, being confined together within the &s;ame walls,
never can forget their mutual animo&s;ities, and who, being
cut off from all the mo&s;t endearing connections of nature,
are commonly cur&s;ed with hearts more &s;elfi&s;h, and tem|pers
more unrelenting, than fall to the &s;hare of other
men. The pious frauds, practi&s;ed to increa&s;e the devo|tion
and liberality of the people, may be regarded as
certain, in an order founded on illu&s;ions, lies, and &s;uper|&s;tition.
<PB N="161" REF="177">
The &s;upine idlene&s;s al&s;o, and its attendant, pro|found
ignorance, with which the convents were re|proached,
admit of no que&s;tion; and tho' monks were
the true pre&s;ervers, as well as inventors, of the dreaming
and captious philo&s;ophy of the &s;chools, no manly or ele|gant
knowledge could be expected among men, who&s;e life,
condemned to a tedious uniformity, and deprived of
all emulation, afforded nothing to rai&s;e the mind, or cul|tivate
the genius.</P>
<P>SOME few mona&s;teries, terrified with this rigorous in|qui&s;ition
carried on by Cromwel and his commi&s;&s;ioners,
&s;urrendered their revenues into the King's hands; and
the monks received &s;mall pen&s;ions as the reward of their
ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s. Orders were given to di&s;mi&s;s &s;uch nuns
and friars as were below four and twenty, and who&s;e
vows were, on that account, &s;uppo&s;ed not to be binding.
The doors of the convents were opened, even to &s;uch as
were above that age; and all tho&s;e recovered their liberty
who de&s;ired it. But as all the&s;e expedients did not fully
an&s;wer the King's purpo&s;e, he had recour&s;e to his u&s;ual
in&s;trument of power, the Parliaments and in order to
prepare men for the innovations projected, the report of
the vi&s;itors was publi&s;hed, and a general horror was en|deavoured
to be excited in the nation again&s;t in&s;titutions
which, to their ance&s;tors, had been the objects of the
mo&s;t profound veneration.</P>
<P>THE King, tho' determined to aboli&s;h utterly the mo|na&s;tic
orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Feb.</NOTE> re&s;olved to proceed gradually in this great
work; and he gave directions to the Parliament to go no
further at pre&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> than to &s;uppre&s;s the le&s;&s;er mona&s;teries,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed revenues below two hundred pounds a year
value<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">27 Hen, VIII. c. 28.</NOTE>. The&s;e were found to be the mo&s;t corrupted,
as lying le&s;s under the re&s;traint of &s;hame, and being ex|po&s;ed
to le&s;s &s;crutiny<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 193.</NOTE>; and it was deemed &s;afe&s;t to be|gin
<PB N="162" REF="178">
with them, and thereby prepare the way for the
greater innovations projected. By this act three hundred
and &s;eventy-&s;ix mona&s;teries were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and their re|venues,
amounting to thirty-two thou&s;and pounds a year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppre&s;&s;ion of the le&s;&s;er mona&s;te|ries.</NOTE>
were granted to the King; be&s;ides their goods, chattels,
and plate, computed at a hundred thou&s;and pounds
more<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It is pretended, &s;ee Holling&s;hed, p. 939, that ten thou&s;and monks were turned out on the di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;&s;er mona&s;teries. If &s;o, mo&s;t of them mu&s;t have been Mendicants: For the revenue could not have &s;upported near that number. The Mendicants, no doubt, &s;till conti|nued their former pro|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>. It does not appear that any oppo&s;ition was made
to this important law: So ab&s;olute was Henry's authority!
A court, called the court of augmentation of the King's
revenue, was appointed for the management of the&s;e
funds. The people naturally concluded, from the erec|tion
of this court, that Henry intended to proceed in de|&s;poiling
the church of her patrimony<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE act formerly pa&s;&s;ed, empowering the King to
name thirty-two commi&s;&s;ioners for framing a body of
canon law, was renewed; but the project was never car|ried
into execution. Henry thought, that the pre&s;ent
confu&s;ion of that law encrea&s;ed his authority, and kept
the clergy in &s;till greater dependance.</P>
<P>FARTHER progre&s;s was made in compleating the union
of Wales with England: The &s;eparate juri&s;dictions of
&s;everal great lords or marchers, as they were called,
which ob&s;tructed the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice in Wales, and en|couraged
robbery and pillaging, were aboli&s;hed; and the
authority of the King's courts was extended every where.
Some juri&s;dictions of a like nature in England were al&s;o
aboli&s;hed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII&punc; c. 4.</NOTE> this &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE commons, &s;en&s;ible that they had gained nothing
by oppo&s;ing the King's will, when he formerly endea|voured
<PB N="163" REF="179">
to &s;ecure the profits of ward&s;hips and liveries,
were now contented to frame a law<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">27 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>, &s;uch as he dictated
to them. It was enacted, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land
&s;hall be adjudged to be in tho&s;e who have the u&s;e of it,
not in tho&s;e to whom it is transferred in tru&s;t.</P>
<P>AFTER all the&s;e laws were pa&s;&s;ed, the King di&s;&s;olved
the Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 April.</NOTE> a Parliament memorable, not only for
the great and important innovations which it introduced,
but al&s;o for the long time it had &s;at, and the frequent
prorogations which it had undergone. Henry had found
it &s;o ob&s;equious to his will, that he did not chu&s;e, during
the&s;e religious ferments, to hazard a new election; and
he continued the &s;ame Parliament above &s;ix years: A
practice, at that time, unu&s;ual in England.</P>
<P>THE convocation, which &s;at during this &s;e&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A convoca|tion.</NOTE> were
engaged in a very important work, the deliberating on
the new tran&s;lation which was projected of the &s;criptures.
Tindal had formerly given a tran&s;lation, and it had been
greedily read by the people; but as the clergy complained
of it, as very inaccurate and unfaithful, it was now pro|po&s;ed
to them that they &s;hould them&s;elves publi&s;h a tran|&s;lation,
which would not be liable to tho&s;e objections.
The friends of the reformation a&s;&s;erted, that nothing
could be more ab&s;urd than to conceal, in an unknown
tongue, the word it&s;elf of God, and thus to counteract
the will of heaven, which, for the purpo&s;e of univer&s;al
&s;alvation, had publi&s;hed that &s;alutary doctrine to all na|tions:
That if this practice was not very ab&s;urd, the ar|tifice
at lea&s;t was very barefaced, and proved a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s,
that the glo&s;&s;es and traditions of the clergy &s;tood in
direct oppo&s;ition to the original text, dictated by Supreme
Intelligence: That it was now nece&s;&s;ary for the people,
&s;o long abu&s;ed by intere&s;ted preten&s;ions, to &s;ee with their
<PB N="164" REF="180">
own eyes, and to examine whether the claims of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics
were founded on that charter, which was on
all hands acknowledged to be derived from heaven: And
that as a &s;pirit of re&s;earch and curio&s;ity was happily re|vived,
and men were now obliged to make a choice
among the preten&s;ions of different &s;ects, the proper ma|terials
for deci&s;ion, and above all, the holy &s;criptures,
&s;hould be &s;et before them, and the revealed will of God,
which the change of language had &s;omewhat ob&s;cured,
be again, by their means, revealed to mankind.</P>
<P>THE favourers of the ancient religion maintained, on
the other hand, that the pretence of making the people
&s;ee with their own eyes, was a mere cheat, and was it|&s;elf
a very barefaced artifice, by which the new preachers
hoped to obtain the guidance of them, and &s;educe them
from tho&s;e pa&s;tors, whom the laws, whom ancient e&s;ta|bli&s;hments,
whom heaven it&s;elf had appointed for their
&s;piritual direction: That the people were, by their igno|rance,
their &s;tupidity, their nece&s;&s;ary avocations, totally
unqualified to choo&s;e their own principles, and it was a
mockery to &s;et materials before them, of which they
could not po&s;&s;ibly make any proper u&s;e: That even in
the affairs of common life, and in their temporal con|cerns,
which lay more within the compa&s;s of human rea|&s;on,
the laws had, in a great mea&s;ure, deprived them of
the right of private judgment, and had, happily, for their
own and the public intere&s;t, regulated their conduct and
behaviour: That theological que&s;tions were placed much
beyond the &s;phere of vulgar comprehen&s;ion; and eccle|&s;ia&s;tics
them&s;elves, tho' a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the advantages of
education, erudition, and an a&s;&s;iduous &s;tudy of the &s;ci|ence,
could not be fully a&s;&s;ured of a ju&s;t deci&s;ion; except
by the promi&s;e made them in &s;cripture, that God would
be ever pre&s;ent with his church, and that the gates of
hell &s;hould not prevail again&s;t her: That the gro&s;s errors
<PB N="165" REF="181">
adopted by the wi&s;e&s;t heathens, proved how unfit men
were to grope their own way, thro' this profound dark|ne&s;s;
nor would the &s;criptures, if tru&s;ted to every man's
judgment, be able to remedy; on the contrary, they
would much augment, the&s;e fatal illu&s;ions: That &s;acred
writ it&s;elf was involved in &s;o much ob&s;curity, was expo&s;ed
to &s;o many difficulties, contained &s;o many appearing con|tradictions,
that it was the mo&s;t dangerous weapon which
could be intru&s;ted into the hands of the ignorant and
giddy multitude: That the poetical &s;pirit, in which a
great part of it was compo&s;ed, at the &s;ame time that it
occa&s;ioned uncertainty in the &s;en&s;e, by its multiplied
tropes and figures, was &s;ufficient to kindle the zeal of
$&s;anatici&s;m, and thereby throw civil &s;ociety into the mo&s;t
furious combu&s;tion: That a thou&s;and fects mu&s;t ari&s;e,
which would pretend, each of them, to derive its tenets
from the &s;cripture; and would be able, by &s;pecious ar|guments,
or even without &s;pecious arguments, to &s;educe
&s;illy women, and ignorant mechanics, into a belief of
the mo&s;t mon&s;trous principles:, And that if ever this di&s;|order,
dangerous to the magi&s;trate him&s;elf, received a
remedy, it mu&s;t be from the tacit acquie&s;cence of the
people in &s;ome new authority; and it was evidently bet|ter,
without farther conte&s;t or enquiry, to adhere peace|ably
to ancient, and therefore the more &s;ecure e&s;tabli&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>THESE latter arguments being more agreeable to ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
government, would probably have prevailed in
the convocation, had it not been for the authority of
Cranmer, Latimer, and &s;ome other bi&s;hops, who were
&s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak the King's &s;en&s;e of the matter. A vote
was pa&s;&s;ed for publi&s;hing a new tran&s;lation of the &s;crip|tures;
and in three years time this great work was fini&s;h|ed,
and printed at Paris. This was deemed a great
point gained by the reformers; and a con&s;iderable ad|vancement
<PB N="166" REF="182">
of their cau&s;e. Farther progre&s;s was &s;oon
expected, after &s;uch important &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT while the retainers to the new religion were
triumphing in their pro&s;perity, they met with a mortifi|cation,
which &s;eemed to bla&s;t all their hopes: Their pa|trone&s;s,
Anne Boleyn, lo&s;t the King's favour, and &s;oon
after her life, from the rage of that furious monarch.
Henry had per&s;evered con&s;tantly in his love to this lady,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;grace of Q. Anne.</NOTE>
during &s;ix years that his pro&s;ecution of the divorce la&s;ted;
and the more ob&s;tacles he met with to the gratification
of his pa&s;&s;ion, the more determined zeal did he exert in
pur&s;uing his purpo&s;e. But the affection which had &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
&s;o long under difficulties, had no &s;ooner attained
&s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its object, than it langui&s;hed from
&s;atiety; and the King's heart was apparently alienated
from his con&s;ort. Anne's enemies &s;oon perceived this
fatal change; and they were very forward to widen the
breach, when they found that they incurred no danger by
interpo&s;ing in tho&s;e delicate concerns. She had brought
forth a dead &s;on; and Henry's extreme fondne&s;s for male
i&s;&s;ue being thus, for the pre&s;ent, di&s;appointed, his tem|per,
equally violent and &s;uper&s;titious, was di&s;po&s;ed to
make the innocent mother an&s;werable for this misfor|tune<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burner, vol. i. p. 196.</NOTE>.
But the chief means which Anne's enemies
employed to inflame the King again&s;t her, was his
jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>ANNE, though &s;he appears to have been entirely in|nocent,
and even virtuous, in her conduct, had a certain
gaity, if not levity, of character, which threw her off
her guard, and made her le&s;s circum&s;pect than her &s;itu|ation
required. Her education in France rendered her
the more prone to the&s;e freedoms; and it was with diffi|culty
&s;he conformed her&s;elf to that &s;trict ceremonial
<PB N="167" REF="183">
which was practi&s;ed in the court of England. More
vain than haughty, &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ee the influence
of her beauty on all around her, and &s;he indulged her|&s;elf
in an ea&s;y familiarity with per&s;ons, who were formerly
her equals, and who might then have pretended to her
friend&s;hip and good graces. Henry's dignity was offend|ed
with the&s;e popular manners; and though the lover
had been entirely blind, the hu&s;band po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but too
quick di&s;cernment and penetration. Wicked in&s;truments
interpo&s;ed, and put a malignant interpretation on the
harmle&s;s liberties of the Queen: The vi&s;counte&s;s of
Rocheford, in particular, who was married to the Queen's
brother, but who lived on bad terms with her &s;i&s;ter-in-law,
in&s;inuated the mo&s;t cruel &s;u&s;picions into the King's
mind; and as &s;he was a woman of a very profligate
character, &s;he paid no regard either to truth or humanity
in tho&s;e calumnies which &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted. She pretended,
that her own hu&s;band was engaged in a criminal corre|&s;pondence
with his &s;i&s;ter; and not contented with this
imputation, &s;he poi&s;oned every action of the Queen, and
repre&s;ented each in&s;tance of favour which &s;he conferred
on any one, as a token of affection. Henry Norris,
groom of the &s;tole, We&s;ton, and Brereton, gentlemen of
the King's chamber, together with Mark Smeton, groom
of the chamber, were ob&s;erved to po&s;&s;e&s;s much of the
Queen's friend&s;hip; and they &s;erved her with a zeal
and attachment which, though chiefly derived from gra|titude,
might not improbably be &s;ea&s;oned with &s;ome
mixture of tenderne&s;s for &s;o amiable a prince&s;s. The
King's jealou&s;y laid hold of the &s;lighte&s;t circum&s;tance;
and finding no particular object on which it could fa&s;ten,
it vented it&s;elf equally on every one who came within
the verge of its fury.</P>
<P>HAD Henry's jealou&s;y been derived from love, though
it might on a &s;udden have proceeded to the mo&s;t violent
<PB N="168" REF="184">
extremities, it would have been &s;ubject to many remor&s;es
and contrarieties; and might at la&s;t have &s;erved only to
augment that affection, on which it was founded. But
it was a more &s;tern jealou&s;y, fo&s;tered entirely by pride:
His love was wholly transferred to another object. Jane
Seymour, daughter of Sir John Seymour, and maid of
honour to the Queen, a young lady of &s;ingular beauty
and merit, had obtained an entire a&s;cendant over him;
and he was determined to &s;acrifice every thing to the
gratification of this new appetite. Unlike to mo&s;t
monarchs, who judge lightly of the crime of gallantry,
and who deem the young dam&s;els of their court rather
honoured than di&s;graced by their pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;eldom
thought of any other attachment than that of marriage;
and in order to attain this end, he underwent more
difficulties and committed greated crimes than tho&s;e which
he fought to avoid by forming that legal connexion.
And having thus entertained the de&s;ign of rai&s;ing his
new mi&s;tre&s;s to his bed and throne, he more willingly
hearkened to every &s;ugge&s;tion, which threw any imputa|tion
of guilt on the unfortunate Anne Boleyn.</P>
<P>THE King's jealou&s;y fir&s;t appeared openly in a tilting<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st May.</NOTE>
at Greenwich, where the Queen happened to drop her
handkerchief; an incident probably ca&s;ual, but inter|preted
by him as an in&s;tance of gallantry to &s;ome of her
paramours<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 198.</NOTE>. He immediately retired from the place;
&s;ent orders to confine her to her chamber; arre&s;ted
Norris, Brereton, We&s;ton, and Smeton, together with
her brother, Rocheford; and threw them into pri&s;on.
The Queen, a&s;toni&s;hed at the&s;e instances of his fury,
thought that he meant only to try her; but finding him
in earne&s;t, &s;he reflected on his ob&s;tinate unrelenting &s;pirit,
and &s;he prepared her&s;elf for that melancholy doom, which
<PB N="169" REF="185">
was awaiting her. Next day, &s;he was &s;ent to the Tower;
and on her way thither, &s;he was informed of her &s;uppo&s;ed
offences, of which &s;he had been hitherto ignorant: She
made earne&s;t prote&s;tations of her innocence; and when
&s;he entered the pri&s;on, &s;he fell on her knees, and prayed
God &s;o to help her, as &s;he was not guilty of the crime
imputed to her. Her &s;urprize and confu&s;ion threw her
into hi&s;terical di&s;orders; and in that &s;ituation, &s;he thought
that the be&s;t proof of innocence was to make an entire
con&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;he di&s;covered &s;ome indi&s;cretions and le|vities,
which her &s;implicity had equally betrayed her to
commit and to avow. She owned, that &s;he had once
rallied Norris on his delaying his marriage, and had told
him, that he probably expected her, when &s;he &s;hould be
a widow: She had reproved We&s;ton, &s;he &s;aid, for his
affection to a kin&s;woman of hers, and his indifference
towards his wife: But he told her, that &s;he had mi&s;taken
the object of his affection, for it was her&s;elf: Upon
which, &s;he defied him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 281.</NOTE>. She affirmed, that Smeton had
never been in her chamber but twice when he played on
the harp&s;ichord: But &s;he acknowledged, that he had once
had the boldne&s;s to tell her, that a look &s;ufficed him.
The King, in&s;tead of being &s;atisfied with the candour
and &s;incerity of her confe&s;&s;ion, regarded the&s;e indi&s;|cretions
only as preludes to greater and more criminal
intimacies.</P>
<P>OF all tho&s;e multitudes, whom the beneficence of the
Queen's temper had obliged, during her pro&s;perous for|tune,
no one dur&s;t interpo&s;e between her and the King's
fury; and the per&s;on, who&s;e advancement every breath
had favoured, and every countenance had &s;miled upon,
was now left neglected and abandoned. Even her uncle
the duke of Norfolk, preferring the connexions of party
<PB N="170" REF="186">
to the ties of blood, was become her mo&s;t dangerous
enemy; and all the retainers to the catholic religion
hoped, that her death would terminate the King's quar|rel
with Rome, and leave him again to his natural and
early bent, which had inclined him to &s;upport the mo&s;t
intimate connexions with the apo&s;tolic &s;ee. Cranmer
alone, of all the Queen's adherents, &s;till retained his
friend&s;hip for her; and, as far as the King's impetuo&s;ity
permitted him, he endeavoured to moderate the violent
prejudices, entertained again&s;t her.</P>
<P>THE Queen her&s;elf wrote Henry a letter from the
Tower, full of the mo&s;t tender expo&s;tulations, and of the
warme&s;t prote&s;tations of innocence. It contains &s;o much
nature and even elegance, as to de&s;erve to be tran&s;mitted
to po&s;terity, without any alteration of the expre&s;&s;ion. It
is as follows.</P>
<P>&startq;SIR, your grace's di&s;plea&s;ure and my impri&s;onment
are things &s;o &s;trange unto me, as what to write, or
what to excu&s;e, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas
you &s;end unto me (willing me to confe&s;s a truth, and &s;o
obtain your favour) by &s;uch an one, whom you know
to be mine antient profe&s;&s;ed enemy, I no &s;ooner re|ceived
this me&s;&s;age by him, than I rightly conceived
your meaning; and, if, as you &s;ay, confe&s;&s;ing a truth
indeed may procure my &s;afety, I &s;hall with all wil|lingne&s;s
and duty perform your command.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;BUT let not your grace ever imagine, that your
poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a fault,
where not &s;o much as a thought thereof preceded.
And to &s;peak a truth, never prince had wife more
loyal in all duty, and in all true affection, than you
have ever found in Anne Boleyn: With which name
and place I could willingly have contented my&s;elf,
<PB N="171" REF="187">
if God and your grace's plea&s;ure had been &s;o plea&s;ed.
Neither did I at any time &s;o far forget my&s;elf in my
exaltation or received queen&s;hip, but that I always
looked for &s;uch an alteration as I now find; for the
ground of my preferment being on no &s;urer foundation
than your grace's fancy, the lea&s;t alteration I knew
was fit and &s;ufficient to draw that fancy to &s;ome other
object. You have cho&s;en me from a low e&s;tate to be
your Queen and companion, far beyond my de&s;ert or
de&s;ire. If then you found me worthy of &s;uch honour,
good your grace let not any light fancy, or bad coun|&s;el
of mine enemies, withdraw your princely favour
from me; neither let that &s;tain, that unworthy &s;tain,
of a di&s;loyal heart towards your good grace, ever ca&s;t
&s;o foul a blot on your mo&s;t dutiful wife, and the in|fant-prince&s;s
your daughter. Try me, good King,
but let me have a lawful trial, and let not my &s;worn
enemies &s;it as my accu&s;ers and judges; yea let me
receive an open trial, for my truth &s;hall fear no open
&s;hame; then &s;hall you &s;ee either mine innocence
cleared, your &s;u&s;picion and con&s;cience &s;ati&s;fied, the
ignominy and &s;lander of the world &s;topped, or my
guilt openly declared. So that what&s;oever God or
you may determine of me, your grace may be freed
from an open cen&s;ure, and mine offence being &s;o
lawfully proved, your grace is at liberty, both before
God and man, not only to execute worthy puni&s;h|ment
on me as an unlawful wife, but to follow your
affection, already &s;ettled on that party, for who&s;e &s;ake
I am now as I am, who&s;e name I could &s;ome good
while &s;ince have pointed unto, your grace not being
ignorant of my &s;u&s;picion therein.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;BUT if you have already determined of me, and
that not only my death, but an infamous &s;lander mu&s;t
<PB N="172" REF="188">
bring you the enjoying of your de&s;ired happine&s;s;
then I de&s;ire of God, that he will pardon your great
&s;in therein, and likewi&s;e mine enemies, the in&s;truments
thereof, and that he will not call you to a &s;trict ac|count
for your unprincely and cruel u&s;age of me, at
his general judgment-&s;eat, where both you and my|&s;elf
mu&s;t &s;hortly appear, and in who&s;e judgment I
doubt not (what&s;oever the world may think of me)
mine innocence &s;hall be openly known, and &s;ufficiently
cleared.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;MY la&s;t and only reque&s;t &s;hall be, that my&s;elf may
only bear the burden of your grace's di&s;plea&s;ure, and
that it may not touch the innocent &s;ouls of tho&s;e poor
gentlemen, who (as I under&s;tand) are likewi&s;e in
&s;trait impri&s;onment for my fake. If ever I have found
favour in your &s;ight, if ever the name of Anne Boleyn
hath been plea&s;ing in your ears, then let me obtain
this reque&s;t, and I will &s;o leave to trouble your grace
any further, with mine earne&s;t prayers to the Trinity
to have your grace in his good keeping, and to direct
you in all your actions. From my doleful pri&s;on in
the Tower, this &s;ixth of May;&endq;</P>

and ever faithful wife,&endq;

<DIV2>
<P>THIS letter had no influence on the unrelenting mind
of Henry, who was determined to pave the way for his
new marriage by the death of Anne Boleyn. Norris,
We&s;ton, Brereton, and Smeton, were tried; but no legal
evidence was produced again&s;t them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her trial.</NOTE> The chief proof
of their guilt con&s;i&s;ted in a hear-&s;ay report from one lady
Wingfield, who was dead. Smeton was prevailed on,
by the vain hope of life, to confe&s;s a criminal corre&s;pon|dence
<PB N="173" REF="189">
with the Queen<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. pi 202.</NOTE>; but even her enemies expected
little advantage from this confe&s;&s;ion: For they never
dared to confront him with her; and he was immediately
executed; as were al&s;o Brereton and We&s;ton. Norris
had been much in the King's favour; and an offer was
made him of life, if he would confe&s;s his crime, and
accu&s;e the Queen: But he generou&s;ly rejected that propo|&s;al;
and &s;aid, that in his con&s;cience he believed her en|tirely
guiltle&s;s: But, for his part, he could accu&s;e her of
nothing, and he would die a thou&s;and deaths rather than
calumniate an innocent per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Queen and her brother were tried by a jury of
peers, con&s;i&s;ting of the duke of Suffolk, the marquis of
Exeter, the earl of Arundel, and twenty-three more:
Their uncle, the duke of Norfolk, pre&s;ided as lord high
&s;teward. Upon what proof or pretence the crime of in|ce&s;t
was imputed to them is unknown: The chief evi|dence,
it is &s;aid, amounted to no more than that Roche|ford
had been &s;een to lean on her bed before &s;ome com|pany.
Part of the charge again&s;t her was, that &s;he had
affirmed to her minions, that the King never had her
heart; and had &s;aid to each of them apart, that &s;he loved
him better than any per&s;on what&s;oever: <HI>Which was to the
&s;lander of the i&s;&s;ue begot between the King and her:</HI> By this
&s;trained interpretation, her guilt was brought under the
&s;tatute of the 25th of this reign; in which it was declared
criminal to throw any &s;lander upon the King, Queen,
or their i&s;&s;ue. Such palpable ab&s;urdities were, at that
time, admitted, and they were regarded by the peers of
England as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for &s;acrificing an innocent
Queen to the cruelty of their tyrant. Though una&s;&s;i&s;ted
by coun&s;el, &s;he defended her&s;elf with great judgment and
pre&s;ence of mind; and the &s;pectators could not forbear
pronouncing her entirely innocent. Judgment, however,
<PB N="174" REF="190">
was given by the court, both again&s;t the Queen and
lord Rocheford; and her verdict contained, that &s;he
&s;hould be burned or beheaded at the King's plea&s;ure.
When this dreadful &s;entence was pronounced, &s;he was
not terrified, but lifting up her hands to heaven, &s;aid,
&startq;O! Father, O! Creator, thou who art the way, the
truth, and the life, thou knowe&s;t that I have not
de&s;erved this death.&endq; And then turning to the
judges, made the mo&s;t pathetic declarations of her inno|cence.</P>
<P>HENRY, not &s;atisfied with this cruel vengeance, was
re&s;olved entirely to annul his marriage with Anne Boleyn,
and to declare her i&s;&s;ue illegitimate: He recalled to his
memory, that, a little after her appearance in the Engli&s;h
court, &s;ome attachment had been acknowledged between
her and the earl of Northumberland, then lord Piercy;
and he now que&s;tioned the nobleman with regard to the&s;e
engagements. Northumberland took an oath before the
two archbi&s;hops, that no contract nor promi&s;e of marriage
had ever pa&s;&s;ed between them: He received the &s;acra|ment
upon it, before the duke of Norfolk and others of
the privy council; and this &s;olemn act he accompanied
with the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations of his veracity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 384.</NOTE>. The
Queen, however, was &s;haken by menaces, of executing
the &s;entence again&s;t her in its greate&s;t rigour, and was
prevailed on to confe&s;s in court, &s;ome lawful impediment
to her marriage with the King<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 94.</NOTE>. The afflicted primate,
who &s;at as judge, thought him&s;elf obliged by this confe&s;|&s;ion,
to pronounce the marriage null and invalid. Henry,
in the tran&s;ports of his fury, did not perceive that his pro|ceedings
were totally incon&s;i&s;tent, and that if her marriage
was, from the beginning, invalid, &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly
be guilty of adultery.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="191">
THE Queen now prepared for &s;uffering that death
to which &s;he was &s;entenced. She &s;ent her la&s;t me&s;&s;age
to the King, and acknowledged the obligations which
&s;he owed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And execu|tion.</NOTE> in continuing thus uniformly his endea|vours
for her advancement: From a private gentle wo|man,
&s;he &s;aid, he had fir&s;t made her a marchione&s;s, then
a queen, and now, &s;ince he could rai&s;e her no higher in
this world, he was &s;ending her to be a &s;aint in heaven:
She then renewed the prote&s;tations of her innocence, and
recommended her daughter to his care. Before the
lieutenant of the Tower, and all who approached her,
&s;he made the like declarations; and continued to behave
her&s;elf with her u&s;ual &s;erenity, and even with chearful|ne&s;s.
&startq;The executioner,&endq; &s;he &s;aid to the lieutenant,
is, I hear, very expert; and my neck is very &s;lender:&endq;
Upon which &s;he gra&s;ped it in her hand, and laughted
heartily.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th May.</NOTE> When brought, however, to the &s;caffold, &s;he
&s;oftened her tone a little with regard to her prote&s;tations
of innocence. She probably reflected, that the ob&s;ti|nacy
of Queen Catherine, and her re&s;i&s;tance to the
King's will, had much alienated him from the lady
Mary; and her maternal concern, therefore, for Eliza|beth,
prevailed in the&s;e la&s;t moments over that indigna|tion,
which the unju&s;t &s;entence, by which &s;he &s;uffered,
naturally excited in her. She &s;aid, that &s;he was come
to die, as &s;he was &s;entenced, by the law: She would
accu&s;e none, nor &s;ay any thing of the ground upon
which &s;he was judged. She prayed heartily for the
King; and called him a mo&s;t merciful and gentle prince,
and acknowledged, that he had always been to her a
good and gracious &s;overeign; and if any one &s;hould
think proper to canva&s;s her cau&s;e, &s;he de&s;ired him to
judge the be&s;t<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 205.</NOTE>. She was beheaded by the executioner
<PB N="176" REF="192">
of Calais, who was brought over as more expert than
any in England. Her body was negligently thrown in|to
a common che&s;t of elm-tree, made to hold arrows;
and was buried in the Tower.</P>
<P>THE innocence of this unfortunate Queen cannot
rea&s;onably be called in que&s;tion. Henry him&s;elf, in the
violence of his rage, knew not whom to accu&s;e as her
lover; and though he imputed guilt to her brother, and
four per&s;ons more, he was able to bring proof again&s;t
none of them. The whole tenour of her conduct for|bids
us to a&s;cribe to her an abandoned character, &s;uch as
is implied in the King's accu&s;ation; and had &s;he been &s;o
lo&s;t to all prudence and &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, &s;he mu&s;t have
expo&s;ed her&s;elf to detection, and afforded her enemies
the cleare&s;t evidence again&s;t her. But the King made
the mo&s;t effectual apology for her, by marrying Jane
Seymour the very day after her execution<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 207.</NOTE>. His im|patience
to gratify this new pa&s;&s;ion, cau&s;ed him to forget
all regard to decency; and his cruel heart was not &s;of|tened
a moment by the bloody cata&s;trophe of a per&s;on,
who had &s;o long been the object of his mo&s;t tender
affections.</P>
<P>THE lady Mary thought the death of her &s;tep-mother
a proper opportunity for reconciling her&s;elf with the
King, who, be&s;ides other cau&s;es of di&s;gu&s;t, had been of|fended
with her, on account of the part which &s;he had
taken in her mother's quarrel. Her advances were not
at fir&s;t received; and Henry exacted from her &s;ome fur|ther
proofs of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience: He required
this young prince&s;s, then about twenty years of age, to
adopt his theological tenets; to acknowledge his &s;upre|macy;
to renounce the pope; and to own her mother's
marriage to be ince&s;tuous and unlawful. The&s;e points
<PB N="177" REF="193">
were of hard dige&s;tion with the prince&s;s; but after &s;ome
delays, and even refu&s;als, &s;he was at la&s;t prevailed with
to write a letter to her father<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 207. Strype, vol. i. p. 285.</NOTE>, containing her a&s;&s;ent to
the articles required of her: Upon which &s;he was re|ceived
into favour. But notwith&s;tanding the return of
the King's affection to the i&s;&s;ue of his fir&s;t marriage, he
dive&s;ted not him&s;elf of kindne&s;s towards the lady Eliza|beth;
and the new Queen, who was ble&s;t with a &s;in|gular
&s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, di&s;covered &s;trong proofs of
attachment to that young prince&s;s.</P>
<P>THE trial and conviction of Queen Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th June. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> and the
&s;ub&s;equent events, made it nece&s;&s;ary for the King to
&s;ummon a new Parliament; and he here, in his &s;peech,
made a merit to his people, that, notwith&s;tanding his
misfortunes in his two former marriages, he had been
induced, for their good, to venture on a third. The
&s;peaker received this pro&s;e&s;&s;ion with &s;uitable gratitude;
and he took thence occa&s;ion to prai&s;e the King for his
wonderful gifts of grace and nature: He compared him,
for ju&s;tice and prudence, to Solomon; for &s;trength and
fortitude to Samp&s;on; and for beauty and comeline&s;s to
Ab&s;alom. The King very humbly replied, by the mouth
of his chancellor, that he di&s;avowed the&s;e prai&s;es; &s;ince,
if he was really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch virtues, they were the
gifts of Almighty God only. Henry found that the
Parliament were equally &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive in deeds as complai&s;ant
in their expre&s;&s;ions, and that they would go the &s;ame
lengths as the former in gratifying even his mo&s;t lawle&s;s
pa&s;&s;ions. His divorce from Anne Boleyn was ratified;
that Queen, and all her accomplices, were attainted; the
i&s;&s;ue of both the two former marriages were declared
illegitimate, and it was even made trea&s;on to a&s;&s;ert the
legitimacy of either of them; to throw any &s;lander upon
<PB N="178" REF="194">
the pre&s;ent King, Queen, or their i&s;&s;ue, was &s;ubjected
to the &s;ame penalty; the crown was &s;ettled on the King's
i&s;&s;ue by Jane Seymour, or any &s;ub&s;equent wife; and in
ca&s;e he &s;hould die without children, he was impowered
by his will, or letters patent, to di&s;po&s;e of the crown:
An enormous conce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The King is thought to have had a de&s;ign of leaving the crown, in ca&s;e of the failure of his lawful male i&s;&s;ue, to his favourite &s;on the duke of Richmond.

was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the kingdom, as well as the
accu&s;ations of trea&s;on multiplied to an unrea&s;onable de|gree.
The King was al&s;o empowered to confer on any

was al&s;o, by another act, made trea&s;on to marry, without
the King's con&s;ent, any prince&s;s related in the fir&s;t de|gree
to the crown. This act was occa&s;ioned by the di&s;|covery
of a de&s;ign, formed by Thomas Howard, brother
to the duke of Norfolk, to e&s;pou&s;e the lady Margaret
Douglas, niece to the King by his &s;i&s;ter the Queen of
Scots and the earl of Angus. Howard, as well as the
young lady, was committed to the Tower. She re|covered
her liberty &s;oon after; but he died in confine|ment.
An act of attainder pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him this &s;e&s;&s;ion
of parliament.</P>
<P>A NEW acce&s;&s;ion was likewi&s;e gained to the authority
of the crown: The King or any of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors was
<PB N="179" REF="195">
empowered to repeal or annul, by letters patent, what|ever
acts of parliament had been pa&s;&s;ed before he was
four and twenty years of age. Whoever maintained the
authority of the bi&s;hop of Rome, by word or writ, or
endeavoured in any manner to re&s;tore it in England, was
&s;ubjected to the penalty of a premunire; that is, his
goods were forfeited, and he was put out of the protection
of the laws. And any per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any office,
eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil, or received any grant or charter
from the crown; and yet refu&s;ed to renounce the pope
by oath, was declared to be guilty of trea&s;on. The
renounciation pre&s;cribed runs in the &s;tyle of <HI>So help me
God, all &s;aints, and the holy evangeli&s;ts</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">28 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>. The pope, hear|ing
of Anne Boleyn's di&s;grace and death, hoped that the
door was opened to a reconciliation, and had been making
&s;ome advances to Henry: But this was the reception he
met with. Henry was now become ab&s;olutely indifferent
with regard to papal cen&s;ures; and finding a great increa&s;e of
authority, as well as revenue, to accrue from his quar|rel
with Rome, he was determined to per&s;evere in his
pre&s;ent mea&s;ures. This Parliament al&s;o, even more
than any foregoing, convinced him how much he com|manded
the re&s;pect of his &s;ubjects, and what confidence
he might repo&s;e in them. Tho' the elections had been
made of a &s;udden, without any preparation or intrigue,
the members di&s;covered an unlimited attachment to his
per&s;on and government<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 212.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE extreme complai&s;ance of the convocation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A convo|cation.</NOTE> which
&s;at at the &s;ame time with the Parliament, encouraged him
in his re&s;olution of breaking entirely with the court of
Rome. There was a divi&s;ion of &s;entiments in the minds
of this a&s;&s;embly; and as the zeal of the reformers had
been augmented by &s;ome late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the re&s;entment
<PB N="180" REF="196">
of the catholics was no le&s;s excited by their fears and
lo&s;&s;es: But the authority of the King kept every one
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and &s;ilent; and the new-a&s;&s;umed prerogative,
the &s;upremacy, who&s;e limits no one was fully acquainted
with, re&s;trained even the mo&s;t furious movements of theo|logical
rancour. Cromwel &s;at as vicar-general; and tho'
the catholic party expected, that, on the fall of Queen
Anne, his authority would receive a great check, they
were &s;urprized to find him &s;till maintain equal credit as
before. With the vicar general concurred Cranmer the
primate, Latimer bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, Shaxton of Sali&s;|bury,
Hil&s;ey of Roche&s;ter, Fox of Hereford, Barlow of
St. David's. The oppo&s;ite party were led by Lee arch|bi&s;hop
of York, Stoke&s;ley bi&s;hop of London, Ton&s;tal of
Durham, Gardiner of Winche&s;ter, Longland of Lincoln,
Sherborne of Chiche&s;ter, Nix of Norwich, and Kite of
Carli&s;le. The former party, by their oppo&s;ition to the
pope, &s;econded the King's ambition and love of power:
The latter party, by maintaining the antient theological
tenets, were more conformable to his &s;peculative prin|ciples:
And both of them had alternately the advantage
of gaining on his humour, by which he was more govern|ed
than by either of the&s;e motives.</P>
<P>THE church in general was aver&s;e to the reformation;
and the lower hou&s;e of convocation framed a li&s;t of
opinions, in the whole &s;ixty-&s;even, which they pro|nounced
erroneous, and which was a collection of prin|ciples,
&s;ame held by the ancient Lollards, others by the
modern prote&s;tants, or Go&s;pellers, as they were &s;ome|times
called. This catalogue they &s;ent to the upper
hou&s;e to be cen&s;ured; but in the preamble of their repre|&s;entation,
they di&s;covered the &s;ervile &s;pirit by which they
were governed. They &s;aid, &startq;that they intended not
to do or &s;peak any thing which might be unplea&s;ant to
the King, whom they acknowledge their &s;upreme head,
<PB N="181" REF="197">
and who&s;e commands they were re&s;olved to obey; re|nouncing
the pope's u&s;urped authority, with all his
laws and inventions, now extingui&s;hed and aboli&s;hed;
and addicting them&s;elves to Almighty God and his
laws, and unto the King and the laws made within
this kingdom<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 119.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE convocation came at la&s;t, after &s;ome debate, to
decide articles of religion; and their tenets were of as
compounded a nature as the a&s;&s;embly it&s;elf, or rather as
the King's &s;y&s;tem of theology, by which they were re|&s;olved
entirely to &s;quare their principles. They deter|mined
the &s;tandard of faith to con&s;i&s;t in the Scriptures and
the three creeds, the Apo&s;tolic, the Nicene, and the
Athana&s;ian; and this article was a &s;ignal victory to the
reformers: Auricular confe&s;&s;ion and penance were ad|mitted,
a doctrine agreeable to the catholics: No men|tion
was made of marriage, extreme unction, confirma|tion,
or holy orders, as &s;acraments; and in this omi&s;&s;ion
the influence of the prote&s;tants appeared. The real pre|&s;ence
was a&s;&s;erted, con&s;ormable to the antient doctrine:
The terms of acceptance were e&s;tabli&s;hed to be the merits
of Chri&s;t, and the mercy and good plea&s;ure of God, &s;uit|able
to the new principles.</P>
<P>SO far the two fects &s;eem to have made a fair partition,
by &s;haring alternately the &s;everal clau&s;es. In framing
the &s;ub&s;quent articles, each of them &s;eems to have
thrown in their ingredient. The catholics prevailed in
a&s;&s;erting, that the u&s;e of images was warranted by Scrip|ture;
the prote&s;tants, in warning the people again&s;t ido|latry,
and the abu&s;e of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible repre&s;entations.
The ancient faith was adopted in maintaining the ex|pediency
of praying to &s;aints; the late innovations in
<PB N="182" REF="198">
rejecting the peculiar patronage of &s;aints to any trade,
profe&s;&s;ion, or cour&s;e of action. The former rites of wor|&s;hip,
the u&s;e of holy water, the ceremonies practi&s;ed on
A&s;h-wedne&s;day, Palm-&s;unday, and Good-friday, &amp;c.
were &s;till maintained; but the new refinements were al&s;o
adopted, which made light of the&s;e in&s;titutions, by the
convocation's denying that they had any immediate
power of remitting &s;in and by its a&s;&s;erting that their &s;ole
merit con&s;i&s;ted in promoting pious and devout di&s;po&s;itions
in the mind.</P>
<P>BUT the article with regard to purgatory, contains
the mo&s;t curious jargon, ambiguity and he&s;itation, ari&s;|ing
from the mixture of oppo&s;ite tenets. It was to this
purpo&s;e: &startq;Since according to due order of charity, and
the book of Maccabees, and divers antient authors, it
is a very good and charitable deed to pray for &s;ouls
departed; and &s;ince &s;uch a practice has been main|tained
in the church from the beginning; all bi&s;hops
and teachers &s;hould in&s;truct the people not to be
grieved for the continuance of the &s;ame. But &s;ince
the place where departed &s;ouls are retained, before
they reach Paradi&s;e, as well as the nature of their pains,
is left uncertain by Scripture; all &s;uch que&s;tions are
to be &s;ubmitted to God, to who&s;e mercy it is meet and
convenient to commend the decea&s;ed, tru&s;ting that he
accepteth our prayers for them<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 122, &amp; &s;eq. Fuller. Burnet, vol. i. p. 215.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE articles, when framed by the convocation, and
corrected by the King, were &s;ub&s;cribed by every member
of that a&s;&s;embly; while, perhaps, neither there nor
throughout the whole kingdom, could one man be found,
except the King him&s;elf, who had adopted preci&s;ely the&s;e
very doctrines and opinions. For though there be not
any contradiction in the tenets here advanced, it had
<PB N="183" REF="199">
happened in England, as in all other &s;tates where factious
divi&s;ions have place; a certain creed was embraced by
each party; few neuters were to be found; and the&s;e
con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;peculative or whim&s;ical people, of
whom two per&s;ons could &s;carce be brought to an agree|ment
in the &s;ame dogmas. The prote&s;tants, all of them,
carried their oppo&s;ition to Rome farther than the&s;e ar|ticles:
None of the catholics went &s;o far: And the
King, by being able to retain the nation in &s;uch a deli|cate
medium, di&s;played the utmo&s;t power of an imperious
de&s;poti&s;m, of which any hi&s;tory furni&s;hes an example.
To change the religion of a country, even when &s;econded
by a party, is one of the mo&s;t perilous enterprizes, which
any &s;overeign can attempt, and often proves the mo&s;t
de&s;tructive to royal authority. But Henry was able to &s;et
the political machine in that furious movement, and yet
regulate and even &s;top its career: He could &s;ay to it, thus
far&s;halt thou go and no farther: And he made every vote
of his parliament and convocation &s;ub&s;ervient, not only
to his intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, but even to his &s;malle&s;t
caprices; nay, to his mo&s;t refined and mo&s;t &s;chola&s;tic
&s;ubtilties.</P>
<P>THE concurrence of the&s;e two national a&s;&s;emblies
&s;erved, no doubt, to increa&s;e the King's power among
the people, and rai&s;ed him to an authority more ab&s;olute,
than any prince, in a &s;imple monarchy, even by means
of military force, is ever able to attain. But there are
certain bounds, beyond which the mo&s;t flavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion
cannot be extended. All the late innovations, par|ticularly
the di&s;&s;olution of the &s;maller mona&s;teries, and
the imminent danger to which all the re&s;t were expo&s;ed<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">A propo&s;al had formerly been made in the convocation for the abolition of the le&s;&s;er mona&s;teries; and had been much oppo&s;ed by bi&s;hop fi&s;her, who was then alive. He told his brethren, that this was fairly &s;howing the King the way, how he might come at the greater mo|na&s;teries. &startq;An ax, which wanted a handle, came upon a time into the wood, making his moan to the great trees, that he wanted a handle to work withal, and for that cau&s;e he was con&s;trained to &s;it idle; therefore he made it his reque&s;t to them, that they would be plea&s;ed to grant him one of their &s;mall &s;aplings within the wood to make him a handle; who, mi&s;tru&s;ting no guile, granted him one of their &s;maller trees to make him a handle. But now becoming a compleat ax, he fell &s;o to work, within the &s;ame wood, that, in proce&s;s of time, there was neither great nor &s;mall trees to be found in the place, where the wood &s;tood. And &s;o, my lords, if you grant the King the&s;e &s;maller mona&s;teries, you do but make him a handle, whereby, at his own plea&s;ure, he may cut down all the cedars within your Lebanons.&endq; Dr. Bailie's life of bi&s;hop Fi&s;her, p. 108.</NOTE>

country, excited both men's piety and compa&s;&s;ion; and as
the antient religion laid hold of the populace by powerful
motives, &s;uited to their capacity, it was able, now that it

laws, human and divine, which prevailed in their country,
&s;hould be turned out of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;o little care
be taken of their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. And when it was

intercepted much of the profits re&s;ulting from the&s;e
confi&s;cations, it tended much to increa&s;e the general di&s;|content<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p, 223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the people did not break out into open &s;edition,
till the complaints of the &s;ecular clergy concurred with
tho&s;e of the regular. As Cromwel's per&s;on was very little
acceptable to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics; the authority, which he
exerci&s;ed, being &s;o new, &s;o ab&s;olute, &s;o unlimited, in|&s;pired
them with great di&s;gu&s;t and terror. He publi&s;hed,
in the King's name, without the con&s;ent either of par|liament
or convocation, an ordonance, by which he re|trenched
a great many of the antient holydays; prohi|bited
&s;everal &s;uper&s;titions, gainful to the clergy, &s;uch as
pilgrimages, images, reliques; and even ordered the
incumbents in the pari&s;hes to &s;et apart a con&s;iderable
portion of their revenues for repairs and for the &s;upport
of exhibitioners and the poor of their pari&s;h. The &s;ecular
prie&s;ts, finding them&s;elves thus reduced to a grievous
&s;lavery, in&s;tilled into the people tho&s;e di&s;contents, which
they had long harboured in their own bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t ri&s;ing was in Lincoln&s;hire. It was headed
by Dr. Mackrel, prior of Barlings, who was di&s;gui&s;ed
like a mean mechanic, and who bore the name of cap|tain
Cobler. This tumultuary army amounted to above
20,000 men<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 227. Herbert.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tion.</NOTE> but notwith&s;tanding their number, they
&s;howed little di&s;po&s;ition of proceeding to extremities
again&s;t the King, and &s;eemed &s;till over-awed by his au|thority.
They acknowledged him to be &s;upreme head
of the church of England: but they complained of his
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the mona&s;teries, of evil coun&s;ellers, of men
<PB N=" 186" REF="204">
of mean birth entru&s;ted by him, of the danger to which
the jewels and plate of their parochial churches were
expo&s;ed: And they prayed him to con&s;ult the nobility
of the realm concerning the redre&s;s of the&s;e grievances<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 410.</NOTE>.
The King was little di&s;po&s;ed to entertain apprehen&s;ions
of danger, e&s;pecially from a low multitude, whom he
de&s;pi&s;ed. He &s;ent forces again&s;t the rebels under the
command of the duke of Suffolk;<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Oc|tober.</NOTE> and he returned them
a very &s;harp an&s;wer to their petition. There were &s;ome
gentry, whom the populace had forced to take party with
them, and who kept a &s;ecret correspondence with Suf|folk.
They informed him, that re&s;entment again&s;t the
King's reply was the chief cau&s;e, which retained the
malecontents in arms, and that a milder an&s;wer would
probably di&s;&s;ipate the rebellion. Henry had levied a great
force at London, with which he was preparing to march
again&s;t the rebels; and being &s;o well &s;upported by power,
he thought, that, without lo&s;ing his dignity, he might
now &s;how them &s;ome greater conde&s;cen&s;ion. He &s;ent
a new proclamation, requiring them to return to their
obedience, with &s;ecret a&s;&s;urances of pardon. This ex|pedient
had its effect: The populace were di&s;&s;ipated:
Mackrel and &s;ome of their leaders fell into the King's
hands, and were executed: The greater part of the mul|titude
retired peaceably to their u&s;ual occupations: A few
of the more ob&s;tinate fled into the North, where they
joined the in&s;urrection, that was rai&s;ed in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>THE northern rebels, as they were more numerous,
were al&s;o more formidable than tho&s;e of Lincoln&s;hire,
becau&s;e the people in tho&s;e parts were more accu&s;tomed
to arms, and becau&s;e of the near neighbourhood to Scot|land,
which might make advantage of the&s;e di&s;orders.
One A&s;ke, a gentleman, had taken the command of
<PB N="187" REF="205">
them, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of governing the populace.
Their enterprize they called the <HI>Pilgrimage of Grace:</HI>
Some prie&s;ts marched before in the habits of their order,
carrying cro&s;&s;es in their hands: In their banners was
wove a crucifix, with the repre&s;entation of a chalice, and
of the five wounds of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 992.</NOTE>: They wore on their &s;leeve
an emblem of the five wounds, with the name of Je&s;us
wrought in the mid&s;t: They all took an oath, that they
had entered into the pilgrimage of grace from no other
motive, than their Jove to God, their care of the King's
per&s;on and i&s;&s;ue, their de&s;ire of purifying the nobility, of
driving ba&s;e-born per&s;ons from about the King, of re&s;tor|ing
the church, and of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing here&s;y. Allured by
the&s;e fair pretences, about 40,000 men from the counties
of York, Durham, Lanca&s;ter, and tho&s;e northern pro|vinces,
flocked to their &s;tandard; and their zeal, no le&s;s
than their numbers, in&s;pired the court with apprehen|&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE earl of Shrew&s;bury, moved by his regard for the
King's &s;ervice, rai&s;ed forces, though at fir&s;t without any
commi&s;&s;ion, in order to oppo&s;e the rebels. The earl of
Cumberland repul&s;ed them from his ca&s;tle of Skipton:
Sir Ralph Evers defended Scarborow-ca&s;tle again&s;t them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 574. Baker, p. 258.</NOTE>:
Courtney, marquis of Exeter, the King's cou&s;in-german,
obeyed orders from court, and levied troops. The earls
of Huntingdon, Derby, and Rutland, imitated his ex|ample.
The rebels, however, prevailed in taking both
Hull and York: They laid &s;iege to Pomfret ca&s;tle, into
which the archbi&s;hop of York and lord Darcy had
thrown them&s;elves. It was &s;oon &s;urrendered to them;
and the prelate and nobleman, who &s;ecretly favoured
the cau&s;e, &s;eemed to yield to the force impo&s;ed on them,
and joined the rebels.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="206">
THE duke of Norfolk was named general in chief
of the King's forces again&s;t the northern rebels; and as
he headed the party, which &s;upported the antient reli|gion,
he was al&s;o &s;u&s;pected of bearing &s;ome favour to the
cau&s;e, which he was &s;ent to oppo&s;e. His prudent con|duct,
however, &s;eems to acquit him of this imputation.
He encamped at Donca&s;ter, together with the earl of
Shrew&s;bury; and as his army was &s;mall, &s;carce exceed|ing
five thou&s;and men, he made choice of a po&s;t, where
he had the river in front, the ford of which he propo&s;ed
to defend again&s;t the rebels. They had intended to at|tack
him in the morning; but during the night, there
fell &s;uch violent rains as rendered the river utterly im|pa&s;&s;ible;
and Norfolk very wi&s;ely laid hold of the oppor|tunity
to enter into treaty with them. In order to
open the door for negotiation, he &s;ent them a herald;
whom A&s;ke, their leader, received with great ceremony;
he him&s;elf &s;itting in a chair of &s;tate, with the archbi&s;hop
of York on one hand, and lord Darcy on the other. It
was agreed that two gentlemen &s;hould be di&s;patched
to the King with propo&s;als from the rebels; and Henry
protracted giving an an&s;wer, and allured them with hopes
of entire &s;atisfaction, in expectation that nece&s;&s;ity would
&s;oon oblige them to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves. Being inform|ed,
that his artifice had in a great mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded, he
required them in&s;tantly to lay down their arms and &s;ub|mit
to mercy; promi&s;ing a pardon to all except &s;ix whom
he named, and four whom he re&s;erved to him&s;elf
the power of naming. But tho' the greate&s;t part of the
rebels had gone home for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they had
entered into the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements to return to
their &s;tandards, in ca&s;e the King's an&s;wer &s;hould not
prove &s;atisfactory. Norfolk, therefore, &s;oon found him|&s;elf
in the &s;ame difficulty as before; and he opened
again a negotiation with the leaders of the multitude.
<PB N="189" REF="207">
He engaged them to &s;end three hundred per&s;ons to Don|ca&s;ter,
with propo&s;als for an accommodation; and he
hoped to be able, by intrigue and &s;eparate intere&s;ts, to
throw di&s;&s;ention among &s;o great a number. A&s;ke him|&s;elf
had propo&s;ed to be one of the deputies, and he re|quired
a ho&s;tage for his &s;ecurity: But the King, when
con&s;ulted, replied, that he knew no gentleman or other,
whom he e&s;teemed &s;o little as to put him in pledge for
&s;uch a villain. The demands of the in&s;urgents were
&s;o exorbitant, that Norfolk rejected them; and they
prepared again to decide the conte&s;t by force of arms.
They were as formidable as ever both by their numbers
and &s;pirit; and notwith&s;tanding a &s;mall river, which
lay between them and the royal army, Norfolk had great
rea&s;on to dread the effects of their fury. But while they
were preparing to pa&s;s the ford, rain fell a &s;econd time
in &s;uch abundance, as made it impracticable for them
to execute their de&s;ign; and the populace, partly re|duced
to nece&s;&s;ity by the want of provisions, partly &s;truck
with &s;uper&s;tition at being thus again di&s;appointed by
the &s;ame accident, &s;uddenly di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves. The

He publi&s;hed, however, a manife&s;to again&s;t the rebels,

a very lofty &s;tyle, &s;uited to &s;o haughty a monarch. He
told them, that they ought no more to pretend giving a
judgment with regard to government, than a blind man
with regard to colours: &startq;And we,&endq; he added, &startq;with

As this pacification was not likely to be of long
continuance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1537.</NOTE> Norfolk was ordered to keep his army to|gether,
and to go into the northern parts, in order to
exact a general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Lord Darcy as well as A&s;ke
were &s;ent for to court; and the former, upon his refu&s;al
or delay to appear, was thrown into pri&s;on. Every place
was full of jealou&s;y and complaints. A new in&s;urrection
broke out, headed by Mu&s;grave and Tilby; and the
rebels be&s;ieged Carli&s;le with 8000 men. Being repul&s;ed
by that town, they were encountered in their retreat by
Norfolk, who put them to flight; and having made pri|&s;oners
of all their officers, except Mu&s;grave, who e&s;cap|ed,
he in&s;tantly put them to death by martial law, to
the number of &s;eventy per&s;ons. An attempt made by Sir
Francis Bigot and Halam to &s;urprize Hull, met with no
better &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;everal other ri&s;ings were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
by the viligance of Norfolk. The King, enraged by the&s;e
multiplied revolts, was determined riot to adhere to the
general pardon, which he had granted; and from a
movement of his u&s;ual violence, he made the innocent
&s;uffer for the guilty. Norfolk, by command from his
ma&s;ter, &s;pread the royal banner, and, wherever he
thought proper, executed martial law in the puni&s;hment
of offenders. Be&s;ides A&s;ke, leader of the fir&s;t in&s;urrec|tion,
Sir Robert Con&s;table, Sir John Bulmer, Sir Tho|mas
Piercy, Sir Stephen Hamilton, Nicholas Tempe&s;t,
William Lumley, and many others, were thrown into
pri&s;on; and mo&s;t of them were condemned and execu|ted.
Lord Hu&s;&s;ey was found guilty as an accomplice in
the in&s;urrection of Lincolnshire, and was executed at
Lincoln. Lord Darcy, though he pleaded compul&s;ion,
and appealed, for his ju&s;tification, to a long life, pa&s;&s;ed
in the &s;ervice of the crown, was beheaded on Tower|hill.
Before his execution, he accu&s;ed Norfolk of ha|ving
&s;ecretly encouraged the rebels; but Henry, either
<PB N="191" REF="209">
&s;en&s;ible of that nobleman's great &s;ervices and convinced
of his fidelity, or afraid to offend one of &s;uch exten&s;ive
power and great capacity, rejected the information. Be|ing
now &s;atiated with puni&s;hing the rebels, he published
anew a general pardon, to which he faithfully adhered<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 428.</NOTE>; and he erected by patent a court of ju&s;tice at York, for
deciding law-&s;uits to the northern counties: A demand
which had been made by the in&s;urgents.</P>
<P>SOON after this pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 October. Birth of prince Ed|ward, and death of Q. Jane.</NOTE> an event happened,
which crowned Henry's joy, the birth of a &s;on, who
was bapti&s;ed under the name of Edward. Yet was not
this happine&s;s complete: The Queen died two days
after<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii. p. 5.</NOTE>. But a &s;on had &s;o long been ardently longed for

to prevent di&s;putes with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, after
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive illegitimation of the two Prince&s;&s;es, that
the King's affliction was drowned in his joy, and he
expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction on this occa&s;ion. The Prince,
not &s;ix days old, was created Prince of Wales, Duke of
Cornwal, and Earl of Che&s;ter. Sir Edward Seymour,
the Queen's brother, formerly made Lord Beauchamp,
was rai&s;ed to the dignity of Karl of Hertford. Sir William
Fitz Williams, high admiral, was created Earl of South|ampton;
Sir William Paulet, Lord St. John; Sir John
Ru&s;&s;el, Lord Ru&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>THE &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion and the birth of a
&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1538.</NOTE> as they confirmed Henry's authority at home, en|crea&s;ed
his con&s;ideration among foreign princes, and
made his alliance be courted by all parties. He main|tained,
however, a neutrality in the wars, which were
carried on, with varied &s;ucce&s;s, and without any deci|&s;ive
event, between Charles and Francis; and though
inclined more to favour the latter, he determined not to
<PB N="192" REF="210">
incur, without nece&s;&s;ity, either hazard or expence in his
behalf. A truce, concluded about this time, between
the&s;e potentates, and which was afterwards prolonged
for ten years, freed him from all anxiety on account of
his ally, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the tranquillity of Europe.</P>
<P>HENRY was very de&s;irous of cementing an union with
the German prote&s;tants; and for that purpo&s;e, he &s;ent
Chri&s;topher Mount to a congre&s;s which they held at
Brun&s;wick; but that mini&s;ter made no great progre&s;s in
his negotiations. The princes de&s;ired to know, what
were the articles in their confe&s;&s;ion which Henry di&s;liked;
and they &s;ent new amba&s;&s;adors to him, who had orders
both to negotiate and to di&s;pute. They endeavoured to
convince the King, that he was guilty of a mi&s;take, in
admini&s;tering the euchari&s;t in one kind only, in allowing
of private ma&s;&s;es, and in requiring the celibacy of the
clergy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 145. from the Cott. Lib. Cleopatra, E. 5. fol. 173.</NOTE>. Henry would by no means acknowlege any
error in the&s;e particulars; and was offended that they
&s;hould pretend to prescribe rules to &s;o great a monarch
and theologian. He found arguments and &s;yllogi&s;ms
enough to defend his cau&s;e; and he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the amba&s;|&s;adors
without coming to any conclu&s;ion. Jealous al&s;o
le&s;t his own &s;ubjects &s;hould become &s;uch theologians as to
que&s;tion his tenets, he u&s;ed great precaution in publi&s;hing
that tran&s;lation of the &s;cripture, which was fini&s;hed this
year. He would only allow a copy of it to be depo&s;ited
in each pari&s;h church, where it was fixed by a chain:
And he took care to inform the people by proclamation,
&startq;That this indulgence was not the effect of his duty,
but of his goodne&s;s and his liberality to them; who
therefore &s;hould u&s;e it moderately, for the encrea&s;e of
virtue, not of &s;trife: And he ordered that no man
&s;hould read the Bible aloud, &s;o as to di&s;turb the prie&s;t,
<PB N="193" REF="211">
while he &s;ang ma&s;s, nor pre&s;ume to expound doubtful
places, without advice from the learned.&endq; In this
mea&s;ure, as in the re&s;t, he &s;till halted half way between
the catholics and the prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>THERE was only one particular, in which Henry was
quite deci&s;ive, becau&s;e he was there impelled by his ava|rice,
or more properly &s;peaking, his rapacity, occa&s;ioned
by profu&s;ene&s;s: This mea&s;ure was the intire de&s;truction
of the mona&s;teries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppre&s;&s;ion of the great|er mona&s;te|ries.</NOTE> The pre&s;ent opportunity &s;eemed fa|vourable
for that great enterprize; while the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion
of the late rebellion fortified and encrea&s;ed the royal au|thority;
and as &s;ome of the abbots were &s;u&s;pected of
having encouraged the in&s;urrection, and of corre&s;ponding
with the rebels, the King's re&s;entment was farther in|cited
by that motive. A new vi&s;itation was appointed of
all the mona&s;teries in England; and a pretence only
being wanted for their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, it was ea&s;y for a
prince, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch exorbitant power, and &s;econding
the pre&s;ent humour of a great part of the nation, to find
or feign one. The abbots and monks knew the danger,
to which they were expo&s;ed; and having learned, by the
example of the le&s;&s;er mona&s;teries, that nothing could
with&s;tand the King's will, they were mo&s;t of them in|duced,
in expectation of better treatment, to make a vo|luntary
re&s;ignation of their hou&s;es. Where promi&s;es
failed of effect, menaces and even extreme violence were
employed; and as &s;everal of the abbots, &s;ince the breach
with Rome, had been named by the court, with a view
to this event, the King's intentions were the more ea&s;ily
effectuated. Some al&s;o, having &s;ecretly embraced the
doctrine of the reformation, were glad to be freed from
their vows; and on the whole, the de&s;ign was conducted
with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that, in le&s;s than two years, the King
had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the mona&s;tic revenues.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="212">
IN &s;everal places, particularly in the county of Oxford,
great intere&s;t was made to pre&s;erve &s;ome convents of
women, who, as they lived in the mo&s;t irreproachable
manner, ju&s;tly merited, it was thought, that their hou&s;es
&s;hould be &s;aved from the general de&s;truction<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 328.</NOTE>. There
appeared al&s;o great difference between the ca&s;e of nuns
and friars; and the one in&s;titution might be very laud|able,
while the other was expo&s;ed to much blame. The
males of all ranks, if endowed with indu&s;try, might be
of &s;ervice to the public; and none of them could want
employment, &s;uited to his &s;tation and capacity. But a
woman of family, who failed of a &s;ettlement in the mar|ried
&s;tate, an accident to which &s;uch per&s;ons were more
liable than women of lower &s;tation, had really no rank
which &s;he properly filled; and a convent was a retreat
both honourable and agreeable, from the inutility and
often want, which attended her &s;ituation. But the King
was determined to aboli&s;h mona&s;teries of every denomi|nation;
and probably thought, that the&s;e antient e&s;ta|bli&s;hments
would be the &s;ooner forgot, if no remains of
them, of any kind, were allowed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the king|dom.</P>
<P>THE better to reconcile the people to this great in|novation,
&s;tories were published of the dete&s;table lives
of the friars in many of the convents; and great care
was taken to defame tho&s;e whom the court was deter|mined
to ruin. The reliques al&s;o, and &s;uper&s;titions,
which had &s;o long been the object of the people's vene|ration,
were expo&s;ed to their ridicule; and the religious
&s;pirit, now le&s;s bent on exterior ob&s;ervances and &s;en&s;ible
objects, was encouraged in this new direction. It is
needle&s;s to be particular in &s;uch an enumeration: Prote&s;|tant
hi&s;torians mention on this occa&s;ion with great tri|umph
the &s;acred repo&s;itories of convents; the parings of

St. Edmond's toes; &s;ome of the coals that roa&s;ted St.
Laurence; the girdle of the Virgin &s;hown in eleven &s;eve|ral

St. Thomas of Lanca&s;ter, an infallible cure for the head|ach;
part of St. Thomas of Canterbury's &s;hirt, much
reverenced by big-bellied women; &s;ome reliques, an ex|cellent
preventive again&s;t rain; others, a remedy to
weeds in corn. But &s;uch fooleries, as they are to be
found in all ages and nations of the world, and even
took place during the mo&s;t refined periods of antiquity,
form no peculiar nor violent reproach on the catholic re|ligion.</P>
<P>THERE were al&s;o di&s;covered, or &s;aid to be di&s;covered,
in the monasteries &s;ome impo&s;tures of a more artificial
nature. At Hales, in the county of Glouce&s;ter, had
been &s;hown, during &s;everal ages, the blood of Chri&s;t
brought from Jeru&s;alem; and it is ea&s;y to imagine the
veneration, with which &s;uch a relique was regarded. A
miraculous circum&s;tance al&s;o attended this miraculous
relique; the &s;acred blood was not vi&s;ible to any one in
mortal &s;in, even when &s;et before him; and till he had
performed good works &s;uffcient for his ab&s;olution, it
would not deign to di&s;cover it&s;elf to him. At the di&s;&s;o|lution
of the mona&s;tery, the whole contrivance was di&s;|covered.
Two of the monks, who were let into the
&s;ecret, had taken the blood of a duck, which they re|newed
every week: They put it into a phial, one &s;ide of
which con&s;i&s;ted of thin and tran&s;parent chry&s;tal, the other
of thick and ob&s;cure. When any rich pilgrim arrived,
they were &s;ure to &s;how him the dark &s;ide of the phial,
till ma&s;&s;es and offerings had expiated his offences; and
then finding his money, or patience, or faith, near ex|hau&s;ted,
they made him happy by turning the phial<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 431, 432. Stowe, p. 575.</NOTE>.</P>

A MIRACULOUS crucifix had been kept at Boxley in

The lips, and eyes, and head of the image moved on the
approach of its votaries. Hil&s;ey, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter,
broke the crucifix at St. Paul's cro&s;s, and &s;hewed the
whole people the springs and wheels by which it had
been &s;ecretly moved. A great wooden idol of Wales,

&s;ome pretended here&s;ies. A finger of St. Andrew's, co|vered
with a thin plate of &s;ilver, had been pawned by a
convent for a debt of forty pounds; but as the King's
commi&s;&s;ioners refu&s;ed to relea&s;e the pawn, people made
them&s;elves very merry with the poor creditor, on account
of his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>BUT of all the in&s;truments of antient &s;uper&s;tition, no|one
was &s;o zealou&s;ly de&s;troyed as the &s;hrine of Thomas a
Becket, commonly called St. Thomas of Canterbury.
This &s;aint owed his canonization to the zealous defence,
which he had made for the apo&s;tolic &s;ee; and on that ac|count
al&s;o, the monks had extremely encouraged the de|votion
of pilgrimages towards his tomb, and numberle&s;s
were the miracles, which, they pretended, his reliques
wrought on his devout votaries. They rai&s;ed his body
once a year; and the day, on which this ceremony was
performed, which was called the day of his tran&s;lation,
was a general holyday: Every fiftieth year there was ce|lebrated
a jubilee to his honour, which la&s;ted fifteen days:
Plenary indulgences were then granted to all that vi&s;ited
his tomb; and a hundred thou&s;and pilgrims have been
registered at a time in Canterbury. The devotion to|wards
<PB N="197" REF="215">
him had quite effaced in that town the adoration
of the Deity; nay, even that of the Virgin. At God's
altar, for in&s;tance, there was offered in one year three
pounds two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence; at the Virgin's, &s;ixty|three
pounds five &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence; at St. Tho|mas's,
eight hundred and thirty-two pounds twelve &s;hil|lings
and three-pence. But next year, the di&s;proportion
was &s;till greater: There was not a penny offered at God's
altar; the Virgin's gained only four pounds one &s;hilling
and eight-pence; but St. Thomas had got for his &s;hare
nine hundred and fifty-four pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and
three-pence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 244.</NOTE>. Lewis the &s;eventh of France had made
a pilgrimage to this miraculous tomb, and had be&s;towed
on the &s;hrine a jewel, which was e&s;teemed the riche&s;t in
Chri&s;tendom. It is obvious, how obnoxious to Henry a
&s;aint of this character mu&s;t appear, and how much con|trary
to all his projects for degrading the authority of the
court of Rome. He not only pillaged the rich &s;hrine,
dedicated to St. Thomas: He made the &s;aint him&s;elf be
cited to appear in court, and be tried and condemned as a
traitor: He ordered his name to be &s;truck out of the ca|lendar;
the office for his fe&s;tival to be expunged from all
breviaries; and his bones to be burned, and the a&s;hes to
be di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>ON the whole, the King, at different times, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed

It is worth tran&s;cribing, as it &s;hews the ideas of the Engli&s;h government, entertained during the reign of Henry the eighth, and even in the time of Sir Edward Coke, when he wrote his In&s;titutes. It clearly appears, that the people had then little notion of being jealous of their liberties, were de&s;irous of making the crown quite independent, and wi&s;hed only to remove from them&s;elves, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the burthens of go|vernment. A large &s;tanding army, and a fixed revenue, would, on the&s;e conditions, have been regarded as great ble&s;&s;ings; and it was owing entirely to the prodigality of Henry, and to his little &s;u&s;picion, that the power of the crown could ever fail, that the Engli&s;h owe all their liberty. The title of the chapter in Coke is, <HI>Advice concerning new and plau&s;ible Projects and Offers in Parliament.</HI> &startq;When any plau&s;ible pro|ject,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;is made in parliament, to draw the lords and commons to a&s;&s;ent to any act, (e&s;pecially in matters of weight and importance) if both hou&s;es do give upon the matter projected and promi&s;ed their con&s;ent, it &s;hall be mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, they being tru&s;ted for the common-wealth, to have the matter projected and promi&s;ed (which moved the hou&s;es to con&s;ent) to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;ame act, lea&s;t the be|nefit of the act be taken, and the matter projected and promi&s;ed never performed, and &s;o the hou&s;es of parliament perform not the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in them, as it fell out (taking one example for many) in the reign of Henry the eighth: On the King's behalf, the members of both hou&s;es were informed in parliament, that no king or kingdom was &s;afe, but where the King had three abilities; 1. To live of his own, and able to defend his kingdom upon any &s;udden inva&s;ion or in&s;urrection. 2. To aid his confederates, otherwi&s;e they would never a&s;&s;i&s;t him. 3. To reward his well-de&s;erving &s;ervants. Now the project was, that if the parliament would give unto him all the abbies, priories, friories, nunneries, and other mona&s;teries, that, for ever in time then to come, he would take order that the &s;ame &s;hould not be converted to private u&s;es; but fir&s;t, that his exchequer for the purpo&s;es afore&s;aid &s;hould be enriched; &s;econdly, the king|dom &s;trengthened by a continual maintenance of forty thou&s;and well-trained &s;oldiers, with &s;kilful captains and commanders; thirdly, for the benefit and ea&s;e of the &s;ubject, who never afterwards, (as was projected) in any time to come, &s;hould be charged with &s;ub&s;idies, fifteenths, loans, or other common aids; fourthly, lea&s;t the honour of the realm &s;hould receive any diminution of honour by the di&s;&s;o|lution of the &s;aid mona&s;teries, there being twenty-nine lords of par|liament of the abbots and priors, (that held of the King <HI>per baro|niam,</HI> whereof more in the next leaf) that the King would create a number of nobles, which we omit.

the King the entire property of their e&s;tates. In order
to reconcile the people to &s;uch mighty innovations, they

the&s;e were al&s;o at this time transferred to the crown, and
by that means came, into the hands of laymen: An abu&s;e
which many zealous churchmen regard as the mo&s;t cri|minal
&s;acrilege. The monks were formerly much at
their ea&s;e in England, and enjoyed revenues, which
much exceeded the regular and &s;tated expence of the
hou&s;e. We read of $he abbey of Chert&s;ey in Surrey,
which po&s;&s;e&s;t 744 pounds a year, tho' it contained only
fourteen monks: That of Furne&s;s, in the county of
Lincoln, was valued at 960 pounds a year, and contain|ed
but thirty monks<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 237.</NOTE>. In order to di&s;&s;ipate their reve|nues,
and &s;upport popularity, the mona&s;teries lived in a
very ho&s;pitable manner; and be&s;ides the poor, maintained
from their offals, there were many decayed gentlemen,
who pa&s;&s;ed their lives in travelling from convent to con|vent,
and were entirely &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at the tables of the
friars. By this ho&s;pitality, as much as by their own in|activity,
did the convents prove nur&s;eries of idlene&s;s; but
<PB N="201" REF="219">
the King, not to give offence by too &s;udden an innova|tion,
bound the new proprietors of abbey lands, to &s;up|port
the ancient ho&s;pitality. But this engagement was
fulfilled in very few places, and for a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to imagine the indignation with which the
intelligence of all the&s;e violences was received at Rome;
and how much the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of that court, who had &s;o
long kept the world in &s;ubjection by big founding epi|thets,
and by holy execrations, would now vent their
rhetoric again&s;t the character and conduct of Henry.
The pope was provoked at la&s;t to publi&s;h the bull, which
he had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t that monarch; and in a public
manner delivered over his &s;oul to the de$$l, and his do|minions
to the fir&s;t invader. Libels were di&s;per&s;ed, in
which he was compared to the mo&s;t furious per&s;ecutors
in antiquity; and the preference was even given on their
&s;ide: He had declared war with the dead, whom the
pagans them&s;elves re&s;pected; was at open enmity with
heaven; and had engaged in profe&s;&s;ed ho&s;tility with the
whole ho&s;t of &s;aints and angels. Above all, he was often
reproached with his re&s;emblance to the emperor Julian,
whom, it was &s;aid, he imitated in his apo&s;tacy and learn|ing,
tho' he fell &s;hort of him in his morals. Henry
could di&s;tingui&s;h in many of the&s;e libels the &s;tile and ani|mo&s;ity
of his kin&s;man, Pole; and he was thence anew
incited to vent his rage, by every po&s;&s;ible expedient, on
that famous cardinal.</P>
<P>REGINALD de la Pole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinal Pole.</NOTE> or Reginald Pole, was de|&s;cended
of the royal family, being fourth &s;on of the
counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, daughter of the duke of Clarence.
He di&s;covered in very early youth evident &s;ymptoms of
that fine genius, and generous di&s;po&s;ition, by which,
during his whole life, he was &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed;
and Henry having conceived great friend&s;hip for him,
propo&s;ed to rai&s;e him to the highe&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical digni|ties;
<PB N="202" REF="220">
and, as a pledge of future favours, he conferred on
him the deanry of Exeter<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.</NOTE>, in order to help him to bear
the expences of his education. Pole was carrying on his
&s;tudies in Paris, at the time when the King &s;olicited the
&s;uffrages of that univer&s;ity in favour of his divorce; but
tho' applied to by the Engli&s;h agent, he declined taking
any part in that affair. Henry bore this neglect with
more temper than was natural to him; and he appeared
unwilling, on that account, to renounce friend&s;hip with
a per&s;on, who&s;e virtues and talents, he hoped, would
prove u&s;eful, as well as ornamental, to his court and
kingdom. He allowed him &s;till to po&s;&s;e&s;s his deanry,
and gave him permi&s;&s;ion to fini&s;h his &s;tudies at Padua:
He even paid him &s;ome court, in order to bring him into
his mea&s;ures; and wrote to him, while in Italy, de&s;iring
him to give his opinion freely, with regard to the late
mea&s;ures taken in England, for aboli&s;hing the papal au|thority.
Pole had now entered into an intimate friend|&s;hip
with whatever was eminent for dignity or merit in
Italy; Sadolet, Bembo, and other reviv$rs of true ta&s;te
and learning; and he was moved by the&s;e connections,
as well as by religious zeal, to forget, in &s;ome re&s;pect,
the duty which he owed to Henry, his benefactor, and
his &s;overeign. He replied, by writing a treati&s;e of <HI>the
unity of the church,</HI> where he inveighed again&s;t the King's
&s;upremacy, his divorce, his &s;econd marriage; and even
exhorted the emperor to revenge on him the injury done
to his family, and to the catholic cau&s;e. Henry, tho'
provoked beyond mea&s;ure at this outrage, di&s;&s;embled his
re&s;entment; and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Pole, de&s;iring him to
return to England, in order to explain certain pa&s;&s;ages
of his book, which he found &s;omewhat ob&s;cure and dif|ficult:
But Pole was on his guard again&s;t this infidious
invitation; and was determined to remain in Italy,
<PB N="203" REF="221">
where he was extremely beloved and e&s;teemed by all the
world.</P>
<P>THE pope and emperor thought them&s;elves obliged to
provide for a man of Pole's eminence and dignity, who,
in &s;upport of their cau&s;e, had &s;acrificed all his preten&s;ions
to fortune in his own country. He was created a car|dinal;
and tho' he took not higher orders than tho&s;e of a
deacon, he was &s;ent legate into Flanders about the year
1536<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Henry was &s;en&s;ible, that Pole's chief intention
in choo&s;ing that employment, was to foment the muti|nous
di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h catholics; and he there|fore
remon&s;trated in &s;uch a vigorous manner with the
queen of Hungary, regent of the Low Countries, that
&s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the legate, without allowing him to exer|ci&s;e
his commi&s;&s;ion. The enmity which he bore Pole,
was now open, as well as violent; and the cardinal, on
his part, kept no farther mea&s;ures in his intrigues again&s;t
Henry. He is even &s;u&s;pected of having a&s;pired to the
crown, by means of a marriage with the lady Mary;
and the King was every day alarmed by informations,
which he received, of the corre&s;pondence maintained in
England by that fugitive. Courtney, marquis of Exeter,
had entered into a con&s;piracy with him; Sir Edward
Nevil, brother to the lord Abergavenny, Sir Nicholas
Carew, ma&s;ter of hor&s;e, and knight of the garter;
Henry de la Pole, lord Montacute, and Sir Geoffrey de
la Pole, brothers to the cardinal. The&s;e per&s;ons were
indicted, and tried, and convicted, before lord Audley,
who pre&s;ided in the trial, as lord high &s;teward. They
were all executed, except Sir Geoffrey de la Pole, who
was pardoned; and he owed this grace to his having
fir&s;t carried to the King &s;ecret intelligence of the con|&s;piracy.
We know little of the ju&s;tice or iniquity of the
&s;entence pronounced again&s;t the&s;e men: We only know,
<PB N="204" REF="222">
that the condemnation of a man, who was, at that time,
pro&s;ecuted by the court, forms no pre&s;umption of his
guilt; tho' as no hi&s;torian of credit mentions, in the
pre&s;ent ca&s;e, any complaints occa&s;ioned by the&s;e trials,
we may pre&s;ume, that &s;ufficient evidence was produced
again&s;t the marquis of Exeter, and his a&s;&s;ociates<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Herbert in Kennet, p. 216.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE rough hand of Henry &s;eemed well adapted for
rending a&s;under tho&s;e bands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXII.</NOTE> by which the an|cient
&s;uper&s;tition had fa&s;tened it&s;elf on the kingdom;
and tho', after renouncing the pope's &s;upremacy, and
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing mona&s;teries, mo&s;t of the political ends of a
reformation were already attained, few people expected,
that he would &s;top at tho&s;e innovations. The &s;pirit of
oppo&s;ition, it was thought, would carry him to the ut|mo&s;t
extremity again&s;t the church of Rome; and lead
him to declare war again&s;t the whole doctrine and wor|ship,
as well as di&s;cipline, of that mighty hierarchy. He
had formerly appealed from the pope to a general coun|cil;
but now, that a general council was &s;ummoned to
meet at Mantua, he previou&s;ly renounced all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to it, as being &s;ummoned by the pope, and lying entirely
under &s;ubjection to that &s;piritual u&s;urper. He engaged
his clergy to make a declaration to the like purpo&s;e; and
he had pre&s;cribed to them many other alterations on an|cient
tenets and practices. Cranmer took advantage of
every opportunity to carry him on in this cour&s;e; and
<PB N="206" REF="224">
while Queen Jane lived, who favoured the reformers,
he had, by means of her in&s;inuation and addre&s;s, been
very &s;ucce&s;sful in his endeavours. After her death, Gar|diner,
who was returned from his emba&s;&s;y to France,
kept the King more in &s;u&s;pence; and by feigning an un|limited
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, he was frequently able to
guide him to his own purpo&s;es. Fox, bi&s;hop of Here|ford,
had &s;upported Cranmer in his &s;chemes for a more
entire reformation; but his death had made way for the
promotion of Bonner, who, tho' he had hitherto &s;eemed
a furious enemy to the &s;ee of Rome, was determined to
&s;acrifice every thing to pre&s;ent intere&s;t, and had joined
the confederacy of Gardiner and the partizans of the old
religion. Gardiner him&s;elf, it was believed, had &s;ecretly
entered into mea&s;ures with the pope, and even with the
emperor; and in concert with the&s;e powers, he endea|voured
to pre&s;erve, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the ancient faith
and wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>HENRY was &s;o much governed by pa&s;&s;ion, that no|thing
could have retarded his animo&s;ity and oppo&s;ition again&s;t
Rome, but &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;topped
his career, and rai&s;ed him new &s;ubjects of animo&s;ity.
Tho' he had gradually, &s;ince he came to years of matu|rity,
been changing the tenets of that theological &s;y&s;tem,
in which he had been educated, he was equally po&s;itive
and dogmatical in the few articles which remained to
him, as if the whole fabric had continued entire and
un&s;haken: And tho' he &s;tood alone in his opinion, the
flattery of courtiers had &s;o enflamed his tyrannical arro|gance,
that he thought him&s;elf entitled to regulate, by
his own particular &s;tandard, the religious faith of the
whole nation. The point, on which he chiefly re&s;ted
his orthodoxy, happened to be the real pre&s;ence; that
very doctrine, in which, among the numberle&s;s victories
of &s;uper&s;tition over common &s;en&s;e, her triumph is the
<PB N="207" REF="225">
mo&s;t &s;ignal and egregious. All departure from this prin|ciple
he held to be heretical and dete&s;table; and nothing,
he thought, would be more honourable for him, than,
while he broke off all connections with the Roman pon|tiff,
to maintain, in this e&s;&s;ential article, the purity of
the catholic faith.</P>
<P>THERE was one Lam|bert<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 396.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;putation with Lambert.</NOTE> a &s;chool-ma&s;ter in Lon|don,
who had been que&s;tioned for un&s;ound opinions by
archbi&s;hop Warham; but, upon the death of that pre|late,
and the changing of councils at court, he had been
relea&s;ed. Not terrified with the danger which he had
incurred, he &s;till continued to promulgate his tenets;
and having heard Dr. Taylor, afterwards bi&s;hop of Lin|coln,
defend in a &s;ermon the corporal pre&s;ence, he could
not forbear expre&s;&s;ing to Taylor his di&s;&s;ent from that
doctrine; and he drew up his objections under ten &s;everal
heads. Taylor carried the paper to Dr. Barnes, who
happened to be a Lutheran, and who maintained, that,
tho' the &s;ub&s;tance of bread and wine remained in the &s;a|crament,
yet the real body and blood of Chri&s;t were there
al&s;o, and were, in a certain my&s;terious manner, incor|porated
with the material elements. By the pre&s;ent laws
and practice, Barnes was no le&s;s expo&s;ed to the &s;take
than Lambert; yet &s;uch was the per&s;ecuting rage which
prevailed, that he was determined to bring this man to
condign puni&s;hment; becau&s;e, in their common de|parture
from the ancient faith, he had dared to go one &s;tep
farther than him&s;elf. He engaged Taylor to accu&s;e
Lambert to Cranmer and Latimer, who, whatever their
private opinion might be on the&s;e points, were obliged
to conform them&s;elves to the &s;tandard of orthodoxy, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
by Henry. When Lambert was cited before
the&s;e prelates, they endeavoured to bend him to a recan|tation;
<PB N="208" REF="226">
and they were &s;urprized, when, in&s;tead of com|pliance,
he ventured to appeal to the King.</P>
<P>THE King, not di&s;plea&s;ed with an opportunity, where
he could at once exert his &s;upremacy, and di&s;play his
learning, accepted the appeal; and was determined to
mix, in a very unfair manner, the magi&s;trate with the
di&s;putant. Public notice was given, that he intended to
enter the li&s;ts with this &s;chool-ma&s;ter: Scaffolds were
erected in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, for the accommodation of
the audience: Henry appeared on his throne, accompa|nied
with all the en&s;igns of maje&s;ty: The prelates were
placed on his right hand: The temporal peers on his
left. The judges and mo&s;t eminent lawyers had a place
a&s;&s;igned them behind the bi&s;hops: The courtiers of
greate&s;t di&s;tinction behind the peers: And in the mid&s;t of
this &s;plendid a&s;&s;embly was produced the unhappy Lam|bert,
and he was required to defend his opinions again&s;t
his royal antagoni&s;t<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 426.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter opened the conference, by
&s;aying, that Lambert, being charged with heretical pra|vity,
had appealed from his bi&s;hop to the King; as if he
expected more favour from this application, and as if the
King could ever be induced to protect a heretic: That
tho' his maje&s;ty had thrown off the u&s;urpations of the &s;ee
of Rome; had di&s;incorporated &s;ome idle monks, who
lived like drones in a bee-hive; had remedied the idola|trous
wor&s;hip of images; had publi&s;hed the bible in Eng|li&s;h,
for the in&s;truction of all his &s;ubjects; and had made
&s;ome le&s;&s;er alterations, which every one mu&s;t approve of;
yet was he determined to maintain the purity of the ca|tholic
faith, and to puni&s;h with the utmo&s;t &s;everity all
departure from it: And that he had taken the pre&s;ent
opportunity, before &s;o learned and grave an auditory, of
convincing Lambert of his errors; but if he &s;till per&s;e|vered
<PB N="209" REF="227">
ob&s;tinately in them, he mu&s;t expect the mo&s;t con|dign
puni&s;hment<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this preamble, which was not very encourag|ing,
the King a&s;ked Lambert, with a &s;tern countenance,
what his opinion was of Chri&s;t's corporal pre&s;ence in the
&s;acrament of the altar; and when Lambert began his di&s;|cour&s;e
with &s;ome compliment to his maje&s;ty, he rejected
the prai&s;e with di&s;dain and indignation. He afterwards
pre&s;&s;ed Lambert with &s;ome arguments, drawn from Scrip|ture
and the &s;choolmen: The audience applauded the
force of his rea&s;oning, and the extent of his erudition:
Cranmer &s;econded his proofs by &s;ome new topics: Gar|diner
entered the lifts as a &s;upport to Cranmer: Ton&s;tal
took up the argument after Gardiner: Stoke&s;ley brought
fre&s;h aid to Ton&s;tal: Six bi&s;hops more appeared &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
in the field after Stoke&s;ley. And the di&s;putation,
if it de&s;erves the name, was prolonged for five hours;
till Lambert, fatigued, confounded, brow-beaten, and
aba&s;hed, was at la&s;t reduced to &s;ilence. The King then,
returning to the charge, a&s;ked him whether he was con|vinced?
and he propo&s;ed, as a concluding argument,
this intere&s;ting que&s;tion, whether he was re&s;olved to live
or die? Lambert, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that courage which
con&s;i&s;ts in ob&s;tinacy, replied, that he ca&s;t him&s;elf wholly
on his maje&s;ty's clemency: The King told him, that he
would be no protector of heretics; and therefore, if that
was his final an&s;wer, he mu&s;t expect to be committed to
the flames. Cromwel, as vicegerent, read the &s;entence
again&s;t him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Collier, in his eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, vol. II p. 152, has pre&s;erved an account which Cromwel gave of this conference, in a letter to Sir Thomas Wyat, the King's emba&s;&s;ador in Germany. &startq;The King's maje&s;ty,&endq; &s;ays Cromwel, &startq;for the reverence of the holy &s;acrament of the altar, did &s;it openly in his hall, and there pre&s;ided at the di&s;pu|tation, proce&s;s and judgment of a mi&s;erable heretic &s;acramentary, who was burned the 20th of November. It was a wonder to &s;ee how princely, with how excellent gravity, and ine&s;timable maje&s;ty his highne&s;s exerci&s;ed there the very office of &s;upreme head of the church of England. How benignly his grace e&s;&s;ayed to convert the mi&s;erable man: How &s;trong and manife&s;t rea&s;ons his highne&s;s alledged again&s;t him.

LAMBERT, who&s;e vanity had probably incited him
the more to per&s;evere on account of the greatne&s;s of
this public appearance, was not daunted by the ter|rors
of that puni&s;hment, to which he was condemned.
His executioners took care to make the &s;ufferings of a
man who had per&s;onally oppo&s;ed the King, as cruel as
po&s;&s;ible: He was burned at a &s;low fire; his legs and
thighs were con&s;umed to the &s;tumps; and when there
appeared no end of his tortures, &s;ome of the guards, more
merciful than the re&s;t, lifted him on their halberts, and
threw him into the flames, where he was con&s;umed.
While they were employed in this friendly office, he
cried aloud &s;everal times, <HI>None but Chri&s;t, none but
Chri&s;t;</HI> and the&s;e words were in his mouth when he
expired<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox's acts and monuments, p. 427. Burnet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME few days before this execution, four Dutch ana|bapti&s;ts,

IT was the unhappy &s;ituation of the Engli&s;h, during
that age, that when they laboured under any grievance,
they had not the &s;atisfaction of expecting redre&s;s from
Parliament:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1539.</NOTE> On the contrary, they had rea&s;on to dread
each meeting of that a&s;&s;embly, and were then &s;ure of
having tyranny converted into law, and aggravated, per|haps,
with &s;ome circum&s;tance, which the arbitrary prince
and his mini&s;ters had not hitherto devi&s;ed, or did not
think proper, of them&s;elves, to carry into execution.
This abject &s;ervility never more eminently appeared than
in a new Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment. 28th April.</NOTE> which the King now a&s;&s;embled,
and which, if he had been &s;o plea&s;ed, might have been
the la&s;t that ever &s;at in England. But he found them
too u&s;eful in&s;truments of dominion ever to entertain
thoughts of giving them a total exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE chancellor opened the Parliament by informing
the hou&s;e of Lords, that it was his maje&s;ty's earne&s;t de|&s;ire,
to extirpate from his kingdom all diver&s;ity of opi|nions
with regard to religion; and as this enterprize was
difficult and important, he de&s;ired them to chu&s;e a com|mittee
among them&s;elves, who might frame certain ar|ticles,
and communicate them afterwards to the Parlia|ment.
The lords named the vicar-general, Cromwel,
now created a peer, the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and
York, the bi&s;hops of Durham, Carli&s;le, Worce&s;ter, Bath
and Wells, Bangor, and Ely. The hou&s;e might have
&s;een what a hopeful ta&s;k they were undertaking: This
&s;mall committee it&s;elf was agitated with &s;uch diver&s;ity of
opinions, that it could come to no conclu&s;ion. The
duke of Norfolk then moved in the hou&s;e, that, &s;ince
there were no hopes of having a report from the com|mittee,
the articles of faith, propo&s;ed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed,
&s;hould be reduced to &s;ix; and new committees be ap|pointed
to frame an act with regard to them. As this
<PB N="212" REF="230">
peer was under&s;tood to &s;peak the King's mind, his motion
was immediately a&s;&s;ented to; and, after a &s;hort pro|rogation,
the bill of the <HI>&s;ix articles,</HI> or the bloody bill
as the prote&s;tants ju&s;tly termed it, was introduced, and
having pa&s;&s;ed the two hou&s;es, had the King's a&s;&s;ent
affixed to it.</P>
<P>IN this law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law of the &s;ix articles.</NOTE> the real pre&s;ence was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the
communion in one kind, the perpetual obligation of
vows of cha&s;tity, the utility of private ma&s;&s;es, the celi|bacy
of the clergy, the nece&s;&s;ity of auricular confe&s;&s;ion.
The denial of the fir&s;t article, with regard to the real

not the privilege of abjuring: An unheard of &s;everity,
and unknown to the inqui&s;ition it&s;elf. The denial of
any of the other five articles, even though recanted, was
puni&s;hable by the forfeiture of goods and chattels, and
impri&s;onment during the King's plea&s;ure: An ob&s;tinate
adherence to error, or a relap&s;e, was adjudged to be fe|lony,
and puni&s;hable with death. The marriage of
prie&s;ts was &s;ubjected to the &s;ame puni&s;hment. Their
commerce with women, for the fir&s;t offence, was for|feiture
and impri&s;onment; for the &s;econd, death. Ab|&s;taining
from confe&s;&s;ion, and from receiving the euchari&s;t
at the accu&s;tomed times, &s;ubjected the per&s;on to fine and
impri&s;onment, during the King's plea&s;ure; and if the
criminal per&s;evered after conviction, he was puni&s;hable
by death and forfeiture, as in ca&s;es of felony<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 14. Herbert in Kennet, p. 219.</NOTE>. Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
were to be appointed by the King, for en|quiring
into the&s;e here&s;ies and irregular practices, and
the criminals were to be tried by a jury.</P>
<P>THE King, in framing this law, laid his oppre&s;&s;ive
hand on both parties; and even the catholics had rea&s;on
<PB N="213" REF="231">
to complain, that the friars and nuns, though di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
their convent, &s;hould be capriciou&s;ly re&s;trained to the
practice of celibacy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">There is a &s;tory, that the duke of Norfolk, meeting, &s;oon after this act was pa&s;&s;ed, one of his chaplains, who was &s;u&s;pected of favouring the reformation, &s;aid to him, &startq;Now, Sir, what think you of the law to hinder prie&s;ts from having wives?&endq; &startq;Yes, my lord,&endq; replies the chaplain, &startq;you have done that; but I will an&s;wer for it, you cannot hinder men's wives from having prie&s;ts.&endq;</NOTE>: But as the prote&s;tants were
chiefly expo&s;ed to the &s;everity of the act, the mi&s;ery of
adver&s;aries, according to the u&s;ual maxims of party,
was regarded by the adherents to the ancient religion,
as their own pro&s;perity and triumph. Cranmer had the
courage to oppo&s;e this bill in the hou&s;e; and though
the King de&s;ired him to ab&s;ent him&s;elf, he could not be
prevailed on to give this proof of compliance<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 249, 270. Fox, vol. ii. p. 1037.</NOTE>. Henry was
accu&s;tomed to Cranmer's freedom and &s;incerity; and be|ing
convinced of the general rectitude of his intentions,
gave him an unu&s;ual indulgence in that particular, and
never allowed even a whi&s;per again&s;t him. That pre|late,
however, was now obliged, in obedience to the &s;ta|tute,
to di&s;mi&s;s his wife, the niece of O&s;iander, a famous
divine of Nuremburg<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert in Kennet, p. 219.</NOTE>; and Henry, &s;atisfied with
this proof of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;howed him his former countenance
and favour. Latimer and Shaxton threw up their bi&s;hop|rics,
on account of this law, and were committed to
pri&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Parliament having thus re&s;igned all their eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
liberties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proclama|tions made equal to laws.</NOTE> proceeded to an entire &s;urrender of their
civil; and without &s;cruple or deliberation they made
by one act a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the English con&s;titution.
They gave to the King's proclamations the &s;ame force
as to a &s;tatute enacted by Parliament; and to render

the matter wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, they framed this law as if
it were only declarative, and were intended to explain the
natural extent of the regal authority. The preamble con|tains,
that the King had formerly &s;et forth &s;everal pro|clamations,
which froward per&s;ons had wilfully con|temned,
not con&s;idering what a King by his royal
power may do; that this licence might encourage of|fenders
not only to di&s;obey the laws of Almighty God,
but al&s;o to di&s;honour the King's mo&s;t royal maje&s;ty,
<HI>who may full ill bear it;</HI> that &s;udden emergencies often
occur, which require &s;peedy remedies, and cannot await
the &s;low a&s;&s;embling and deliberations of Parliament; and
that, though the King was empowered, by his authority,
derived from God, to con&s;ult the public good on the&s;e
occa&s;ions, yet the oppo&s;ition of refractory &s;ubjects might
pu&s;h him to extremity and violence: For the&s;e rea&s;ons,
the Parliament, that they might remove all occa&s;ion of
doubt, ascertained by a &s;tatute this prerogative of the
crown, and enabled his maje&s;ty, with the advice of his
council, to &s;et forth proclamations, enjoining obedience
under whatever pains and penalties he &s;hall think proper:
And the&s;e proclamations were to have the force of per|petual
laws<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;hows either a &s;tupid or wilful blindness of the
Parliament is, that they pretended, even after this &s;ta|tute,
to maintain &s;ome limitations in the government;
and they enacted, that no proclamation &s;hould deprive
any per&s;on of his lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, liberties, inheritances,
privileges, franchi&s;es; nor yet infringe any common law
or laudable cu&s;tom of the realm. They con&s;idered not,
that no pains could be inflicted on the di&s;obedience of
proclamations, without invading &s;ome liberty or property
of the &s;ubject; and that the power of enacting new
<PB N="215" REF="235">
laws, joined to the di&s;pen&s;ing power, then exerci&s;ed by
the crown, amounted to a full legi&s;lative authority. It
is true, the Kings of England had been always accu&s;|tomed,
from their own authority, to i&s;&s;ue proclamations,
and to exact obedience to them; and this prerogative
was, no doubt, a &s;trong &s;ymptom of ab&s;olute govern|ment:
But &s;till there was a difference between a power,
which was exerci&s;ed on a particular emergence, and
which mu&s;t be ju&s;tified by the pre&s;ent expediency or
nece&s;&s;ity; and an authority conferred by a po&s;itive
&s;tatute, which could no longer admit of controul or
limitation.</P>
<P>COULD any act be more oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of li|berty
than this law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> it would have been another of the
&s;ame parliament. They pa&s;&s;ed attainders, not only a|gain&s;t
the Marquis of Exeter, the Lords Montacute,
Darcy, Hu&s;&s;ey, and others, who had been legally tried
and condemned; but al&s;o again&s;t &s;ome per&s;ons, of the
highe&s;t quality, who had never been accu&s;ed, or examin|ed,
or convicted. The violent hatred, which Henry bore
to cardinal Pole, had extended it&s;elf to all his friends
and relations; and his mother in particular, the coun|te&s;s
of Sali&s;bury, had, on that account, become ex|tremely
obnoxious to him. She was al&s;o accu&s;ed of
having employed her authority with her tenants, to hin|der
them from peru&s;ing the new tran&s;lation of the Bible;
of having procured bulls from Rome, which, 'tis &s;aid,
were found at Coudray, her country &s;eat; of having
kept a corre&s;pondence with her &s;on, the cardinal: But
Henry found, either that the&s;e offences could not be
proved, or that they would not by law be &s;ubject to &s;uch
&s;evere puni&s;hment as he de&s;ired to inflict upon her. He
re&s;olved, therefore, to proceed again&s;t her in a more
&s;ummary and more tyrannical manner; and for that
purpo&s;e, he &s;ent Cromwel, who was but too ob&s;equious
<PB N="216" REF="236">
to his will, to demand of the judges, whether the Par|liament
could attaint a per&s;on, who was forth-coming,
without giving him any trial, or citing him to appear
before them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Coke's 4th In&s;t. p. 37, 38.</NOTE>? The judges replied, that it was a danger|ous
que&s;tion, and that the high court of Parliament
ought to give examples to inferior courts of proceeding
according to ju&s;tice: No inferior court could act in
that arbitrary manner, and they thought that the Parlia|ment
never would. Being pre&s;&s;ed to give a more explicit
an&s;wer, they replied, that, if a per&s;on were attainted in
that manner, the attainder could never after be brought
in que&s;tion, but mu&s;t remain good in law. Henry learn|ed
by this deci&s;ion, that &s;uch a method of proceeding,
though directly contrary to all the principles of equity,
was yet practicable; and this being all he was anxious
to know, he re&s;olved to employ it again&s;t the counte&s;s
of Sali&s;bury. Cromwel &s;howed to the hou&s;e of peers a
banner, on which were embroidered the five wounds of
Chri&s;t, the &s;ymbol, cho&s;en by the northern rebels; and
this banner, he affirmed, was found in the Counte&s;s's
hou&s;e<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. 652.</NOTE>. No other proof &s;eems to have been produced,
in order to a&s;certain her guilt: The Parliament, with|out
farther enquiry, pa&s;&s;ed a bill of attainder again&s;t her;
and they involved in the &s;ame act, without any better
proof, as far as appears, Gertrude Marchione&s;s of Exe|ter,
Sir Adrian Forte&s;cue, and Sir Thomas Dingley.
The&s;e two gentlemen were executed: The marchione&s;s
was pardoned, and &s;urvived the King; the counte&s;s re|ceived
a reprieve.</P>
<P>THE only beneficial act, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was that
by which the parliament confirmed the &s;urrender of the
mona&s;teries; and yet even this act contains much fal&s;|hood,
much tyranny, and were it not that all private
<PB N="217" REF="237">
rights mu&s;t &s;ubmitt$ public intere&s;t, much inju&s;tice and
iniquity. The &s;cheme of engaging the abbots to make
a &s;urrender of their mona&s;teries had been conducted, as
may ea&s;ily be imagined, with many invidious circum|&s;tances:
Arts of all kinds had been employed; every
motive, that could work on the frailty of human nature,
had been &s;et before them; and it was with great dif|ficulty
that the&s;e dignified conventuals were brought to
a conce&s;&s;ion, which mo&s;t of them regarded as de&s;tructive
of their intere&s;ts, as well as &s;acrilegious and criminal
in it&s;elf<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 158. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>. Three abbots had &s;hown more con&s;tancy
than the re&s;t, the abbots of Colche&s;ter, Reading, and
Gla&s;tenbury; and in order to puni&s;h them for their op|po&s;ition,
and make them an example to others, means
had been found to convict them of trea&s;on; they had
peri&s;hed by the hands of the executioner, and the reve|nues
of the convents had been forfeited<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 10.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides, though
none of the&s;e violences had had place, the King knew,
that a &s;urrender made by men, who were only tenants
for life, would not bear examination; and he was there|fore
re&s;olved to make all &s;ure by his u&s;ual expedient, an
act of parliament. In the preamble to this act, the par|liament
a&s;&s;erts, that all the &s;urrenders, made by the ab|bots,
had been, &startq;without con&s;traint, of their own ac|cord,
and according to the due cour&s;e of common
law.&endq; And in con&s;equence, the parliament confirms
the &s;urrenders, and a&s;certains the property of the abbey
lands to the King and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">31 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. It is re|markable,
that all the mitred abbots &s;till fat in the hou&s;e
of peers; and that none of them made any prote&s;tation
again&s;t this &s;tatute.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="238">
IN this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the rank of all the great officers of
&s;tate was fixed: Cromwel, as vicegerent, had the pre|cedency
a&s;&s;igned him above all of them. It was thought
&s;ingular, that a black-&s;mith's &s;on, for he was no other,
&s;hould have place next the royal family; and that a man
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no manner of literature, &s;hould be &s;et at the
head of the church.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the act of the &s;ix articles had pa&s;&s;ed, the
catholics were extremely vigilant to inform again&s;t of|fenders;
and $word$ le&s;s than five hundred per&s;ons were in
a little time thrown into pri&s;on But Cromwel, who
had not had intere&s;t enough to prevent that act, was able,
for the pre&s;ent, to elude its execution. Seconded by the
duke of Suffolk, and lord chancellor Audley, as well
as Cranmer, he remon&s;trated again&s;t the cruelty of pu|ni&s;hing
&s;o many delinquents; and he obtained permi&s;&s;ion
to &s;et them at liberty. The uncertainty of the King's
humour gave each party an opportunity of triumphing in
its turn. No &s;ooner had Henry, pa&s;&s;ed this law, which
&s;eemed to give &s;o deep a wound to the reformers, than
he granted a general permi&s;&s;ion, for every one to have
the new translation of the Bible in his Family: A con|ce&s;&s;ion
regarded by that party, as a mo&s;t important
victory.</P>
<P>BUT as Henry was ob&s;erved to be much governed by
his wives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry's Projects of marriage.</NOTE> while he retained his fondne&s;s for them, the
final prevalence of either party, &s;eemed to depend much
on the choice of the future Queen. Immediately after
the death of Jane Seymour, the mo&s;t beloved of all his
wives, he began to think of a new marriage. He fir&s;t
ca&s;t his eye on the dutche&s;s-dowager of Milan, $$ece to
the Emperor; and he made propo&s;als for that alliance.
But meeting with difficulties in this de&s;ign, he was car|ried,
by his friend&s;hip for Francis, rather to think of a
<PB N="219" REF="239">
French prince&s;s. He demanded the dutche&s;s-dowager
of Longueville, daughter of the duke of Gui&s;e, a prince
of the hou&s;e of Lorraine; but Francis told him, that
that lady was already betrothed to the King of Scotland.
The King, however, would not take a repul&s;e: He had
&s;et his heart extremely on the match: The information,
which he had received, of the dutche&s;s's accompli&s;hments
and beauty, had prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him in her favour; and
having privately &s;ent over Meautys to examine her per|&s;on,
and get certain intelligence of her conduct, the ac|counts,
which that agent brought him, &s;erved farther to
inflame his de&s;ires. He learned, that &s;he was big made;
and he thought her, on that account, the more proper
match for him, who was now become &s;omewhat corpu|lent.
The plea&s;ure too of mortifying his nephew, whom,
he did not love, was a farther incitement to his pro&s;ecu|tion
of this match; and he in&s;i&s;ted, that Francis &s;hould
give him the preference to the King of Scots. But
Francis, though &s;en&s;ible that the alliance of England
was of much greater importance to his intere&s;t, would
not affront his friend and ally; and to prevent farther
&s;olicitations, he immediately &s;ent the Prince&s;s to Scot|land.
Not to &s;hock, however, Henry's humour, Francis
made him an offer of Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the
duke of Vendome; but as the King was informed, that
James had formerly rejected this Prince&s;s, he would not
hear any farther of &s;uch a propo&s;al. The French mo|narch
then offered him the choice of the two younger
&s;i&s;ters of the new Queen of Scots; and he a&s;&s;ured him,
that they were nowi&s;e inferior either in merit or &s;ize
to their elder &s;i&s;ter, and that one of them was even,
&s;uperior in beauty. The King was as &s;crupulous with
regard to the per&s;on of his wives, as if his heart had been
really &s;u&s;ceptible of a delicate pa&s;&s;ion; and he was un|willing
to tru&s;t any relations, or even pictures, with
<PB N="220" REF="240">
regard to this important particular. He propo&s;ed to
Francis, that they &s;hould have a conference at Calais on
pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s; and that that monarch &s;hould bring
along with him the two Prince&s;&s;es of Gui&s;e, together
with the fine&s;t ladies of quality in France, that he might
make a choice among them. But the gallante &s;pirit of
Francis was &s;hocked with this propo&s;al; and he was
impre&s;&s;ed with too much regard, he &s;aid, for the fair &s;ex,
to carry ladies of the fir&s;t quality, like geldings, to a
market, there to be cho&s;en or rejected by the humour of
the merchant<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 638.</NOTE>. Henry would hearken to none of the&s;e
niceties, but &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on his propo&s;al; which, how|ever,
notwith&s;tanding Francis's earne&s;t de&s;ire of con|tinuing
a good corre&s;pondence with him, was finally rejected.</P>
<P>THE King began then to turn his thoughts towards
a German alliance; and as the princes of the Smal|caldic
league were extremely di&s;gu&s;ted again&s;t the Em|peror
on account of the per&s;ecution of their religion,
he hoped, by matching him&s;elf into one of their fami|lies,
to renew an amity, which he regarded as &s;o u&s;eful
to him. Cromwel joyfully &s;econded this intention; and
propo&s;ed to him Anne of Cleves, who&s;e father, the duke
of that name, had great intere&s;t among the Lutheran
princes, and who&s;e &s;i&s;ter, Sibylla, was married to the
elector of Saxony, the head of the prote&s;tant alliance.
A flattering picture, drawn for the Prince&s;s by Hans
Holben, determined Henry to apply to her father; and
after &s;ome negotiations, the marriage, notwith&s;tanding
the oppo&s;ition of the elector of Saxony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marries Anne of Cleves.</NOTE> was at la&s;t con|cluded;
and the Prince&s;s was &s;ent over to England.
The King, impatient to be &s;atisfied with regard to the
per&s;on of his bride, came privately to Roche&s;ter, and
<PB N="221" REF="241">
got a &s;ight of her. He found her big, indeed, and tall,
as he could wi&s;h; but utterly devoid both of beauty
and grace; very unlike the pictures and repre&s;entations,
which he had received: He &s;wore &s;he was a great
Flanders-mare; and declared, that he never could po&s;|&s;ibly
bear her any affection. The matter was wor&s;e,
when he found, that &s;he could &s;peak no language but
Dutch, of which he was entirely ignorant; and that the
charms of her conver&s;ation were not likely to compen&s;ate
for the homeline&s;s of her per&s;on. He returned to Green|wich
very melancholy; and much lamented his hard
fate to Cromwel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;likes her.</NOTE> as well as to Lord Ru&s;&s;el, Sir An|thony
Brown, and Sir Anthony Denny. This la&s;t
gentleman, in order to give him comfort, told him, that
his misfortune was common to Kings, who could not,
like private per&s;ons, choo&s;e for them&s;elves; but mu&s;t
receive their wives from the judgment and fancy of others.</P>
<P>IT was the &s;ubject of debate among the King's coun|&s;ellers,
whether the marriage could not yet be broke;
and the Prince&s;s be &s;ent back to her own country.
Henry's &s;ituation &s;eemed at that time very critical.
After the ten years truce, concluded between the Em|peror
and the king of France, a good under&s;tanding
&s;eemed to have taken place between the&s;e rival mo|narchs;
and &s;uch marks of union appeared, as gave
great jealou&s;y to the court of England. The Emperor,
who knew the generous nature of Francis, even put a
confidence in him, which is rare, to that degree, among
great princes. An in&s;urrection had been rai&s;ed in the
Low Countries by the inhabitants of Ghent, and &s;eemed
to threaten the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. Charles,
who re&s;ided at that time in Spain, re&s;olved to go in
per&s;on to Flanders, in order to appea&s;e the&s;e di&s;orders;
<PB N="222" REF="242">
but he found great difficulties in contriving the manner
of his pa&s;&s;age thither. The road by Italy and Germany
was tedious: The voyage through the Channel dange|rous,
by rea&s;on of the Engli&s;h naval power: He a&s;ked Francis's
permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s through his dominions; and
he entru&s;ted him&s;elf into the hands of a rival, whom he
had &s;o mortally offended. The French monarch received
him at Paris, with great magnificence and courte&s;y; and
though prompted both by revenge and intere&s;t, as well
as by the advice of his mi&s;tre&s;s and favourites, to make
advantage of the pre&s;ent opportunity, he conducted the
Emperor &s;afely out of his dominions; and would not &s;o
much as &s;peak to him of bu&s;ine&s;s during his abode in
France, le&s;t his demands &s;hould bear the air of violence
upon his royal gue&s;t.</P>
<P>HENRY, who was informed of all the&s;e particulars,
believed that an entire and cordial union had taken place
between the&s;e two great monarchs; and that their reli|gious
zeal might prompt them to fall with combined
arms upon England<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 579.</NOTE>. An alliance with the German
princes &s;eemed now, more than ever, requi&s;ite for his
intere&s;t and &s;afety; and he knew, that, if he &s;ent back
the Prince&s;s of Cleves, &s;uch an affront would be highly
re&s;ented by her friends and family.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1540. 6 January.</NOTE> He was therefore
re&s;olved, notwith&s;tanding his aver&s;ion to her, to complete
the marriage; and he told Cromwel, that, &s;ince matters
had gone &s;o far, he mu&s;t put his neck into the yoke.
Cromwel, who knew how much his own intere&s;t was
concerned in this affair, was very anxious to learn from
the King, next morning after the marriage, whether
he now liked his &s;pou&s;e any better. The King told him,
that he hated her wor&s;e than ever; and that her per&s;on
was more loth&s;ome on a near approach: He was re&s;olved
<PB N="223" REF="243">
never to meddle with her; and even &s;u&s;pected her not to
be a true maid: A point, about which he had entertained
an extreme delicacy. He continued $owever to be civil
to Anne; he even &s;eemed to repo&s;e his u&s;ual confidence
in Cromwel; but though he exerted this command over
his temper, a di&s;content lay lurking in his brea&s;t, and
was ready to bur&s;t out on the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>A SESSION of Parliament was held;<NOTE PLACE="marg">12 April. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> and none of the
abbots were now allowed a place in the hou&s;e of peers.
The King, by the mouth of the chancellor, complained to
the Parliament of the great diver&s;ity of religions, which
&s;till prevailed among his &s;ubjects: A grievance, he &s;aid,
which ought the le&s;s to be endured; becau&s;e the Scrip|tures
were now publi&s;hed in Engli&s;h, and ought uni|ver&s;ally
to be the &s;tandard of belief to all mankind. But
he had appointed, he &s;aid, &s;ome bi&s;hops and divines to
draw up a li&s;t of tenets, to which his people were to
a&s;&s;ent; and he was determined, that Chri&s;t, the doctrine
of Chri&s;t, and the truth &s;hould have the victory. The
King &s;eems to have expected more effect in a&s;certaining

en&s;$ed from the publication of the Scriptures. Crom|wel,
as vicar-general, made al&s;o in the King's name a
&s;peech to the upper hou&s;e; and the peers, in return,
be&s;towed &s;uch flattery on him, that they &s;aid he was
worthy, by his de&s;ert, to be vicar-general of the uni|ver&s;e.
That mini&s;ter &s;eemed to be no le&s;s in his ma&s;ter's
good graces: He received, &s;oon after the &s;itting of the
Parliament, the title of Earl of E&s;&s;ex, and was in&s;talled.

<P>THERE remained only one religious order in England;
the knights of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, or the knights of
Malta, as they are commonly called. This order, partly

great &s;ervice to Chri&s;tendom; and had very much re|tarded,
at Jeru&s;alem, Rhodes, and Malta, the rapid pro|gre&s;s
of the barbarians. During the general &s;urrender of
the religions hou&s;es in England, they had exerted their
&s;pirit; and $ad ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to yield up their reve|nues
to the King; and Henry, who would endure no
&s;ociety that profe&s;&s;ed obedience to the pope, was obliged
to have recour&s;e to the Parliament for the di&s;&s;olution
of this order. Their revenues were large; and formed
an addition nowi&s;e contemptible to the many acqui&s;itions,
which the King had already made. But he had very ill
hu&s;banded the great revenue obtained by the plunder of
the church: His profu&s;e genero&s;ity di&s;&s;ipated fa&s;ter than
his rapacity could &s;upply; and the Parliament were
&s;urprized this &s;e&s;&s;ion to find a new demand made upon
them of four tenths and a &s;ub&s;idy of one &s;hilling in the
pound during two years: So ill were the people's expec|tations
an&s;wered, that the crown was never more to re|quire
any &s;upply from the people. The commons,
though lavi&s;h of their liberty, and of the blood of their
fellow &s;ubjects, were extremely frugal of their money;
and it was not without difficulty that that grant could
be obtained by this ab&s;olute and dreaded monarch. The
convocation gave the King four &s;hillings in the pound to
be levied in two years. The pretext for the&s;e grants
was the great expence, which Henry had been put to
for the defence of the nation, in building forts along the
&s;ea. coa&s;t, and in equipping a navy. As he had at pre&s;ent
no ally on the Continent, in whom he repo&s;ed much
confidence, he relied only on his dome&s;tic &s;trength,
and was on that account obliged to be more expen&s;ive
in his preparations again&s;t the dangers of an inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King's favour to Cromwel, and his acquie&s;cence
in the marriage of Anne of Cleves, were both of them
deceitful appearances; His aver&s;ion to the Queen &s;ecretly
<PB N="225" REF="247">
encrea&s;ed every day; and having at la&s;t broke all re|&s;traint,
it prompted him at once to &s;eek the di&s;&s;olution
of a marriage &s;o odious to him, and to involve his mini|&s;ter
in ruin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fall of Cromwel.</NOTE> who had been the author of it. The fall
of Cromwel was ha&s;tened by other cau&s;es. All the no|bility
hated a man, who, being of &s;uch ba&s;e extraction,
had not only mounted above them by his &s;tation of vicar
general, but had engro&s;&s;ed many of the other con&s;iderable
offices of the kingdom: Be&s;ides that commi&s;&s;ion, which
gave him a high, and almo&s;t ab&s;olute authority over the
clergy, and even over the laity, he was Lord privy &s;eal,
Lord chamberlain, and Ma&s;ter of the wards: He had
al&s;o obtained the order of the garter, a dignity which
had ever been conferred only on men of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious
families, and which &s;eemed to be profaned by its being
communicated to &s;o mean a per&s;on. The people were
aver&s;e to him, as the &s;uppo&s;ed author of the violences on
the mona&s;teries; e&s;tabli&s;hments, which were &s;till re|vered
and beloved by the commonalty. The catholics
regarded him as the concealed enemy of their religion:
The prote&s;tants, ob&s;erving his exterior concurrence with
all the per&s;ecutions exerci&s;ed again&s;t them, were inclined,
to bear him as little favour; and reproached him with
the timidity, if not treachery, of his conduct. And the
King, who found, that great clamours had on all hands
ari&s;en again&s;t the administration, was not di&s;plea&s;ed to
throw on Cromwel the load of public hatred; and he
hoped, by &s;o ea&s;y a &s;acrifice, to regain the affections of
his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>BUT there was another cau&s;e, which &s;uddenly &s;et all
the&s;e motives in action, and brought about an unexpect|ed
revolution in the mini&s;try. The King had fixed his
affection on Catherine Howard, niece to the Duke of
Norfolk; and being determined to gratify this new pa&s;|&s;ion,
he could find no other expedient but by procuring
<PB N="226" REF="248">
a divorce from his pre&s;ent con&s;ort, to rai&s;e Catherine to
his bed and throne. The Duke, who had long been en|gaged
in enmity with Cromwel, made the &s;ame u&s;e of
her in&s;inuations to ruin the mini&s;ter, that he had formerly
done of Anne Boleyn's again&s;t Wol&s;ey: And when all
engines were prepared, he obtained a commi&s;&s;ion from
the King, to arre&s;t Cromwel at the council-board on
the accu&s;ation of high trea&s;on, and to commit him to
the Tower. Immediately after, a bill of attainder was
framed again&s;t him; and the hou&s;e of peers thought pro|per,
without trial, examination, or evidence, to condemn
to death a man, whom, a few days before, they had de|clared
worthy to be vicar-general of the univer&s;e. The
hou&s;e of commons pa&s;&s;ed the bill, though not without
&s;ome oppo&s;ition. Cromwel was accu&s;ed of here&s;y and
trea&s;on; but the in&s;tances of his trea&s;onable practices are
utterly improbable, or even ab&s;olutely ridiculous<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 278.</NOTE>. The
only circum&s;tance of his conduct, by which he &s;eems to
have merited this fate, was his being the in&s;trument of
the King's tyranny, in conducting like iniquitous bills,
in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion, again&s;t the Counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury
and others.</P>
<P>CROMWEL endeavoured to &s;often the King by the
mo&s;t humble &s;upplications; but all to no purpo&s;e: It
was not the practice of that Prince to ruin his mini&s;tere
and favourites by halves; and though the unhappy pri|&s;oner
wrote once in &s;o moving a &s;train as even to draw
tears from his eyes, he hardened him&s;elf again&s;t all move|ments
of pity, and refu&s;ed his pardon. The conclu&s;ion
of Cromwel's letter ran in the&s;e words. &startq;I, a mo&s;t wo|ful
pri&s;oner, am ready to &s;ubmit to death when it &s;hall
plea&s;e God and your maje&s;ty; and yet the frail fle&s;h
incites me to call to your grace for mercy and pardon
<PB N="227" REF="249">
of mine offences. Written at the Tower with the
heavy heart and trembling hand of your highne&s;s's
mo&s;t mi&s;erable pri&s;oner and poor &s;lave, Thomas
Cromwel.&endq; And a little below, &startq;Mo&s;t gracious
prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th July. His exe|cution.</NOTE> I cry for mercy, mercy, mercy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 281, 282.</NOTE>.&endq; When
brought to execution, he avoided all earne&s;t prote&s;ta|tions
of his innocence;, and all complaints again&s;t the
&s;entence pronounced upon him. He knew that Henry would
re&s;ent on his &s;on the&s;e &s;ymptoms of oppo&s;ition to
his will, and that his death alone would not terminate
that monarch's vengeance. Me was a man of prudence,
indu&s;try, and ability; worthy of a better ma&s;ter and of a
better fate. Though rai&s;ed to the &s;ummit of power from
a very low origin, he betrayed no in&s;olence or contempt
of his inferiors; and was careful to remember all the
obligations which, during his lower fortune, he had
owed to any one. He had &s;erved as a private &s;entinel in
the Italian wars, where he received &s;ome good offices
from a Lucque&s;e merchant, who had entirely forgot his
per&s;on, as well as the &s;ervice, which he had rendered
him. Cromwel, in his grandeur, happened, at London,
to ca&s;t his eye on his benefactor, now reduced to po|verty,
by misfortunes. He immediately &s;ent for him,
put him in mind of their antient friend&s;hip, and by his
grateful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, re-in&s;tated him in his former pro&s;per|ous
circum&s;tances<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 172.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mea&s;ures for divorcing the King from Anne of
Cleves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's di|vorce from Anne of Cleves.</NOTE> were carried on at the &s;ame time with the bill
of attainder again&s;t Cromwel. The hou&s;e of peers, in
conjunction with the commons, applied to him by peti|tion,
de&s;iring that he would allow his marriage to be
examined; and orders were immediately given to lay the
matter before the convocation. Anne had been formerly
<PB N="228" REF="250">
contracted by her father to the Duke of Lorrain; but
&s;he, as well as the Duke, were at that time under age,
and the contract had been afterwards annulled by the
con&s;ent of both, parties. The King, however, pleaded
this contract as a ground of divorce; and he added two
rea&s;ons more, which may &s;eem a little extraordinary;
that, when he e&s;pou&s;ed Anne, he had not <HI>inwardly</HI> given
his con&s;ent, and that he had not thought proper to con|&s;ummate
the marriage. The convocation were &s;atisfied
with the&s;e rea&s;ons, and &s;olemnly annulled the marriage
between the King and Queen: The Parliament ratified
the deci&s;ion of the clergy<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">To &s;how how much Henry &s;ported with law and common &s;en&s;e, how &s;ervilely the Parliament followed all his caprices; and how much $word$ of them were lo&s;t to all &s;entiment of &s;hame; an act was pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, declaring, that a precontract &s;hould be no ground of annulling a marriage; as if that pretext had not been made u&s;e in both in the ca&s;e of Anne Boleyn and Anne of Cleves. But the King's intention in this law is &s;aid to be a de&s;ign of re&s;toring the prince&s;s Elizabeth to her right of legitimacy; and it was his character never to look farther than the pre&s;ent object, without regarding the incon&s;i&s;tency of his conduct. The Parliament made it high trea&s;on to deny the di&s;&s;olution of Henry'$ marriage with Anne of Cleves. Herbert.</NOTE>; and the &s;entence was &s;oon
after notified to that Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>ANNE was ble&s;t with a happy in&s;en&s;ibility of temper,
even in the points which the mo&s;t nearly affect her &s;ex; and
the King's aver&s;ion towards her, as well as his pro&s;ecu|tion
of the divorce, had never given her the lea&s;t unea|&s;ine&s;s.
She willingly hearkened to terms of compo&s;ition
with him; and when he offered to adopt her as his &s;i&s;ter,
to give her place next the Queen, and his own daughter,
and to make a &s;ettlement of three thou&s;and pounds a year
upon her; &s;he accepted of the conditions, and gave her
con&s;ent to the divorce<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 458, 459.</NOTE>. She even wrote to her brother,
(for her father was dead) that &s;he had been very well
<PB N="229" REF="251">
u&s;ed in England, and de&s;ired him to live on good terms
with the King. The only in&s;tance of pride which &s;he
betrayed was that &s;he refu&s;ed to return into her own
country after the affront which &s;he had received; and &s;he
lived and died in England.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING Anne's moderation, this inci|dent
produced a great coldne&s;s between the King and the
German princes; but as the &s;ituation of Europe was now
much altered, Henry was the more indifferent about their
re&s;entment. The clo&s;e intimacy which had taken place
between Francis and Charles, had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted during a very
&s;hort time: The di&s;&s;imilarity of their characters &s;oon re|newed,
with greater violence than ever, their former jea|lou&s;y
and hatred. While Charles remained at Paris,
Francis had been imprudently engaged, by his open tem|per,
and by that &s;atisfaction which a noble mind natu|rally
feels in performing generous actions, to make &s;ome
very dangerous, confidences to that intere&s;ted monarch;
and having now lo&s;t all &s;u&s;picion of his rival, he hoped,
that the emperor and he, &s;upporting each other, might
neglect every other alliance. He not only communicated
to his gue&s;t the &s;tate of his negociations with Sultan So|lyman
and the Venetians: He al&s;o laid open the &s;olici|tations
which he had received from the court of England,
to enter into a confederacy again&s;t him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel, Du Tillet.</NOTE>. Charles had
no &s;ooner reached his own dominions, than he &s;hewed
him&s;elf unworthy of the friendly reception which he had
met with. He flatly refu&s;ed to execute his promise, and
put the Duke of Orleans in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Milane&s;e:
He informed Solyman, and the &s;enate of Venice, of the
treatment which they had received from their ally: And
he took care that Henry &s;hould not be ignorant how wil|lingly
Francis had abandoned his ancient friend, to
<PB N="230" REF="252">
whom he owed &s;uch important obligations, and had &s;a|crificed
him to a new confederate: He even poi&s;oned and
mi&s;repre&s;ented many things, which the un&s;u&s;pecting heart
of the French monarch had di&s;clo&s;ed to him. Had Henry
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed true judgment and genero&s;ity, this incident
alone had been &s;ufficient to guide him in the choice
of his allies. But his domineering pride carried him
immediately to renounce the friendship of Francis, who
had &s;o unexpectedly given the Emperor the preference:
And as Charles invited him to a renewal of ancient ami|ty,
he willingly accepted the offer; and thinking him|&s;elf
&s;ecure in this alliance, he neglected the friend&s;hip
both of France and of the German princes.</P>
<P>THE new turn which Henry had taken with regard to
foreign affairs, was extremely agreeable to his catholic
&s;ubjects; and as it had perhaps contributed, among other
rea&s;ons, to the ruin of Cromwel, it made them entertain
hopes of a final prevalence over their antagoni&s;ts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th Augu&s;t. His mar|riage with Catherine Howard.</NOTE> The
marriage of the King with Catherine Howard, which
followed &s;oon after his divorce from Anne of Cleves, was
al&s;o regarded as a very favourable incident to their cau&s;e;
and the &s;ub&s;equent events corre&s;ponded perfectly to their
expectations. The King's councils being now directed
by Norfolk, and Gardiner, a furious per&s;ecution com|menced
again&s;t th prote&s;tants; and the law of the &s;ix
articles was executed with rigour. Dr. Barnes, who had
been the cau&s;e of Lambert's execution, felt, in his turn,
the &s;everity of the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit; and, by a bill
which pa&s;&s;ed in parliament, without trial, he was con|demned
to the flames, together with Jerome and Ger|rard.
He di&s;cu&s;&s;ed theological que&s;tions even at the
&s;take; and as the debate between him and the &s;heriff,
turned upon the invocation of &s;aints, he &s;aid, that he
doubted whether the &s;aints could pray for us; but if they
could, he hoped in half an hour, to be praying for the
<PB N="231" REF="253">
&s;heriff and all the &s;pectators. He next entreated the &s;he|riff
to carry to the King his dying reque&s;ts, which he
fondly imagined would have authority with that monarch,
who had &s;ent him to the &s;take. The purport of his re|que&s;ts
was, that Henry, be&s;ides repre&s;&s;ing &s;uper&s;titious
ceremonies, &s;hould be extremely vigilant in preventing
fornication and common &s;wearing<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 298. Fox.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry was exerting this violence again&s;t the
prote&s;tants, he &s;pared not the catholics who denied his
&s;upremacy; and a foreigner, who was at that time in
England, had rea&s;on to &s;ay, that tho&s;e who were again&s;t
the pope were burned, and tho&s;e who were for him were
hanged<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 529.</NOTE>. The King even di&s;played, in an o&s;tentatious
manner, this tyrannical equity and impartiality, which
reduced both parties to &s;ubjection, and infu&s;ed terror in|to
every brea&s;t. Barnes, Gerrard, and Jerome had been
carried to the place of execution on three hurdles; and
along with them there was placed on each hurdle a ca|tholic,
who was al&s;o executed for his religion. The&s;e
catholics were Abel, Fether&s;tone, and Powel, who de|clared,
that the mo&s;t grievous part of their puni&s;hment
was the being coupled to &s;uch heretical mi&s;creants as
&s;uffered with them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Saunders, de Schi&s;m. Angl.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h &s;eemed to be total|ly
&s;unk under the de&s;potic power of Henry, there ap|peared
&s;ome &s;ymptoms of di&s;content: An incon&s;iderable
in&s;urrection broke out in York&s;hire, headed by Sir John
Nevil; but it was &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and Nevil, with the
other ringleaders, was executed. The rebels were &s;up|po&s;ed to have been
in&s;tigated by the intrigues of cardi|nal

make the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, who lay under &s;entence

to be carried to the place of execution, and this ve|nerable
matron maintained &s;till, in the&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful cir|cum&s;tances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 May.</NOTE>

whom &s;he was de&s;cended<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 468.</NOTE>. She refu&s;ed to lay her head
on the block, or &s;ubmit to a &s;entence where &s;he had re|ceived
no trial. She told the executioner, that, if he
would have her head, he mu&s;t win it the be&s;t way he
could: And thus &s;haking her venerable grey locks, &s;he
ran about the &s;caffold; and the executioner followed her
with his ax, aiming many fruitle&s;s blows at her neck,
before he was able to give her the fatal &s;troke. Thus
peri&s;hed the la&s;t of the line of Plantagenet, which, with
great glory, but &s;till greater crimes and misfortunes, had
governed England for the &s;pace of three hundred years.
The lord Leonard Grey, a man who had formerly ren|dered
great &s;ervice to the crown, was al&s;o beheaded for
trea&s;on, &s;oon after the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury. We know
little of the grounds of his pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>THE in&s;urrection in the North engaged Henry to make
a progre&s;s thither, in order to quiet the minds of his
people, to reconcile them to his government, and to
aboli&s;h the ancient &s;uper&s;titions, to which tho&s;e parts
were much addicted. He had al&s;o another motive for
his journey:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1541.</NOTE> He propo&s;ed to hold a conference at York
with his nephew the King of Scotland, and, if po&s;&s;ible,
to cement a clo&s;e and indi&s;&s;oluble union with that
kingdom.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame &s;pirit of religious innovation, which had
&s;eized the other parts of Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of af|fairs in Scotland.</NOTE> had made its way into
Scotland, and had begun, long before this period, to ex|cite
the &s;ame jealou&s;ies, fears, and per&s;ecutions. About
the year 1527, Patrick Hamilton, a young man of a
<PB N="233" REF="257">
noble family, having been created abbot of Ferne, was
&s;ent abroad for his education; but had fallen into com|pany
with &s;ome reformers, and he returned into his own
country very ill di&s;po&s;ed towards that church, of which
his birth and his merit entitled him to attain the highe&s;t
honours. The fervour of youth, and his zeal for no|velty,
made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to conceal his &s;enti|ments;
and Campbel, prior of the Dominicans, who,
under colour of friend&s;hip, and a &s;ympathy in opinion,
had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into his confidence, accu&s;ed him
to Beaton, archbi&s;hop of St. Andrews. Hamilton was
invited to St. Andrews, in order to maintain, with &s;ome
of the clergy, a di&s;pute concerning the controverted
points; and after much rea&s;oning with regard to ju&s;tifi|cation,
freewill, original &s;in, and other topics of that
nature, the conference ended with their condemning
Hamilton to be burnt for his errors. The young man,
who had been deaf to the in&s;inuations of ambition, was
le&s;s likely to be &s;haken with the fears of death, while
he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf both the glory of bearing te&s;ti|mony
to the truth, and the immediate reward atten|ding
his martyrdom. The people, who compa&s;&s;ionated
his youth, his virtue, and his noble birth, were much
moved with the con&s;tancy of his end; and an incident,
which &s;oon followed, &s;till more confirmed them in their
favourable &s;entiments towards him. He cited Campbel,
who &s;till in&s;ulted him at the &s;take, to an&s;wer before the
judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t; and as that per&s;ecutor, either
a&s;toni&s;hed with the&s;e events, or overcome with remor&s;e,
or, perhaps, &s;eized with a di&s;temper, &s;oon after lo&s;t his
&s;en&s;es, and fell into a fever, of which he died; the peo|ple
regarded Hamilton as a prophet, as well as a
martyr<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood's Hi&s;t. church of Scotland, p. 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="258">
AMONG the di&s;ciples converted by Hamilton, was one
friar Forre&s;t, who became a zealous preacher; and who,
though he did not openly di&s;cover his &s;entiments, was
&s;u&s;pected to lean towards the new opinions. His dioce|&s;an,
the bi&s;hop of Dunkel, enjoined him, when he met
with a good epi&s;tle or good go&s;pel, which favoured the
liberties of holy church, to preach on it, and let the re&s;t
alone. Forre&s;t an&s;wered, that he had read both Old and
New Te&s;tament, and had not found an ill epi&s;tle, or ill
go&s;pel in any part of them. The extreme attachment to
the Scriptures was regarded in tho&s;e days as a &s;ure cha|racteri&s;tic
of here&s;y; and Forre&s;t was &s;oon after brought
to his trial, and condemned to the flames. While the
prie&s;ts were deliberating on the place of his execution, a
by&s;tander advi&s;ed them to burn him in &s;ome cellar: For
that the &s;moke of Mr. Patrick Hamilton had infected
all tho&s;e on whom it blew<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE clergy were at that time reduced to great diffi|culties,
not only in Scotland, but all over Europe. As
the reformers aimed at a total &s;ubver&s;ion of ancient e&s;ta|bli&s;hments,
which they repre&s;ented as idolatrous, im|pious,
dete&s;table, the prie&s;ts, who found both their ho|nours
and properties at &s;take, thought that they had a
right to re&s;i&s;t, by every extremity, the&s;e dangerous in|vaders,
and that the &s;ame &s;imple principles of equity,
which ju&s;tified a man in killing a pyrate or a robber,
would acquit them for the execution of &s;uch heretics. A
toleration, though it is never acceptable to eccle&s;ia&s;tics,
might, they &s;aid, be admitted in other ca&s;es; but &s;eemed
an ab&s;urdity where fundamentals were &s;haken, and where
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and even the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the e&s;tabli&s;hed
clergy were brought in danger. But though the church
was thus carried by policy, as well as inclination, to
<PB N="235" REF="259">
kindle the fires of per&s;ecution, they found the &s;ucce&s;s of
this remedy very precarious, and ob&s;erved, that the en|thu&s;ia&s;tic
zeal of the reformers, inflamed by puni&s;hment,
was apt to prove very contagious on the compa&s;&s;ionate
minds of the &s;pectators. The new doctrine, amid&s;t all
the dangers to which it was expo&s;ed, &s;pread it&s;elf &s;ecretly
every where; and the minds of men were gradually di&s;|po&s;ed
to a revolution in religion.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptom for the clergy in
Scotland was, that the nobility, moved by the example
of England, had ca&s;t a wi&s;hful eye on the church reve|nues,
and hoped, if a reformation took place, to enrich
them&s;elves by the plunder of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics. James
him&s;elf, who was very poor, and was &s;omewhat inclined
to magnificence, particularly in building, had been &s;way|ed
by like motives; and began to threaten the clergy
with the &s;ame &s;ate which attended them in the neighbour|ing
country. Henry al&s;o, never cea&s;ed exhorting his
nephew to imitate his example; and being moved both
by the pride of making pro&s;elytes, and the pro&s;pect of
&s;ecurity, if Scotland &s;hould embrace a clo&s;e union with
him, he &s;olicited the King of Scots to meet him at
York; and he obtained a promi&s;e to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE eccle&s;ia&s;tics were extremely alarmed with this re|&s;olution
of James; and they employed every expedient,
in order to prevent it. They repre&s;ented the dangers of
innovation; the pernicious con&s;equences of aggrandizing
the nobility, already too powerful; the hazard of putting
him&s;elf into the hands of the Engli&s;h, his hereditary
enemies; the dependance which mu&s;t en&s;ue upon lo&s;ing
the friend&s;hip of France, and of all foreign potentates.
To the&s;e considerations, they added the pro&s;pect of pre|&s;ent
intere&s;t, by which they found the King to be much
governed: They offered him a pre&s;ent gratuity of fifty
thou&s;and pounds Scots: They promi&s;ed him, that the
<PB N="236" REF="260">
church &s;hould always be ready to contribute to his &s;up|ply:
And they pointed out to him, the confi&s;cations of
heretics, as the means of filling his exchequer, and of
adding a hundred thou&s;and pounds a year to the crown
revenues<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. xiv. Drummond in Ja. 5. Pit&s;cotie, ibid. Knox.</NOTE>. The in&s;inuations of his new Queen, to
whom youth, beauty, and addre&s;s had given a powerful
influence over him, &s;econded all the&s;e rea&s;ons; and
James was at la&s;t engaged, fir&s;t to delay his journey,
then to &s;end excu&s;es to the King of England, who had
already come to York, in order to be pre&s;ent at the
conference.</P>
<P>HENRY, vexed with the di&s;appointment, and enraged
at the affront, vowed vengeance again&s;t his nephew; and
he began, by permitting pyracies at &s;ea, and incur&s;ions
at land, to put his threats in execution. But he
received &s;oon after, in his own family, an affront to
which he was much more &s;en&s;ible, and which touched
him in a point where he had always &s;hewn an extreme
delicacy. He had thought him&s;elf very happy in his
new marriage: The youth, beauty, and agreeable di&s;po|&s;ition
of Catherine, had entirely captivated his affections;
and he made no &s;ecret of his devoted attachment to her.
He had even put up a prayer in his chapel, returning
thanks to heaven for the felicity which the conjugal &s;tate
afforded him; and he de&s;ired the bi&s;hop of Lincoln to
compo&s;e a form of thank&s;giving for that purpo&s;e. But
the queen very little merited this tenderne&s;s which he
bore her:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;covery of the Queen's crimes.</NOTE> She had abandoned her&s;elf to lewdne&s;s. One
La&s;celles brought intelligence of her di&s;&s;olute life to
Cranmer; and told him, that his &s;i&s;ter, formerly a &s;ervant
in the old dutche&s;s of Norfolk's family, with whom Ca|therine
was educated, had given him a particular account
<PB N="237" REF="261">
of all her di&s;orders. Derham and Mannoc, both of
them &s;ervants of the dutche&s;s, had been admitted to her
bed; and &s;he had even taken little care to conceal her
&s;hame from the other &s;ervants of the family. The pri|mate,
&s;truck with this intelligence, which it was equally
dangerous to conceal or to di&s;cover, communicated the
matter to the earl of Hertford and to the chancellor. They
agreed, that the matter &s;hould by no means be buried
in &s;ilence; and the archbi&s;hop him&s;elf &s;eemed the mo&s;t
proper per&s;on to di&s;clo&s;e it to the King. Cranmer, un|willing
to &s;peak on &s;o delicate a &s;ubject, wrote a narrative
of the whole, and conveyed it to Henry, who was infi|nitely
a&s;toni&s;hed at the intelligence. So confident was
he of the fidelity of his con&s;ort, that he gave at fir&s;t no
credit to the information; and he &s;aid to the lord privy|&s;eal,
to lord Ru&s;&s;el, high admiral, Sir Anthony Brown,
and Wriothe&s;ely, that he regarded the whole as a forgery.
Cranmer was now in a very perilous &s;ituation; and had
not full proofs been found, certain and inevitable de&s;truc|tion
hung over him. The King's impatience, however,
and jealou&s;y prompted him to &s;earch the matter to the
bottom: The privy-&s;eal was ordered to examine La&s;|celles,
who per&s;i&s;ted in the information he had given;
and &s;till appealed to his &s;i&s;ter's te&s;timony. That noble|man
made next a pretence of hunting, and went to Su&s;|&s;ex,
where the woman at that time re&s;ided; He found
her both con&s;tant in her former intelligence, and parti|cular
as to the facts; and the whole bore but too much
the face of probability. Mannoc and Derham, who
were arre&s;ted at the &s;ame time, and examined by the
chancellor, made the Queen's guilt entirely certain by
their confe&s;&s;ion; and di&s;covered other particulars, which
redounded &s;till more to her di&s;honour. Three maids of
the family were admitted into her &s;ecrets; and &s;ome of
<PB N="238" REF="262">
them had even pa&s;t the night in bed with her and her
lovers. All the examinations were laid before the King,
who was &s;o deeply affected, that he remained a long time
&s;peechle&s;s, and at la&s;t bur&s;t into tears. He found to his
&s;urprize, that his great &s;kill in di&s;tingui&s;hing a true maid,
of which he boa&s;ted in the ca&s;e of Anne of Cleves, had
failed him in that of his pre&s;ent con&s;ort. The Queen
being now que&s;tioned, denied her guilt; but when in|formed,
that a full di&s;covery was made, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed,
that &s;he had been criminal before her marriage; and
only in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;he had never been fal&s;e to the King's
bed. But as there was evidence, that one Colepeper had
pa&s;&s;ed the night with her alone &s;ince her marriage; and
as it appeared, that &s;he had taken Derham, her old
paramour, into her &s;ervice; &s;he &s;eemed to de&s;erve very
little credit in this a&s;&s;everation; and the King be&s;ides,
was not of a humour to make any difference between
the&s;e degrees of guilt.</P>
<P>HENRY found,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1542.</NOTE> that he could not &s;o fully or expedi|tiou&s;ly
&s;atiate his vengeance on all the&s;e criminals as by
a&s;&s;embling a Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 Jan.</NOTE> the u&s;ual in&s;trument of his
tyranny. The two hou&s;es, having received the Queen's
confe&s;&s;ion, began by an addre&s;s to the King; which
con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal particulars. They entreated him not
to be vexed with this untoward accident, to which all
men were &s;ubject; but to con&s;ider the frailty of human
nature, and the mutability of human affairs; and from
the&s;e views to derive a &s;ubject of con&s;olation. They
de&s;ired leave to frame a bill of attainder again&s;t the Queen
and her accomplices; and they begged him to give his
a&s;&s;ent to this bill, not in per&s;on, which would renew his
vexation, and might endanger his health, but by com|mi&s;&s;ioners
appointed for that purpo&s;e. And as there was
a law in force, making it trea&s;on to &s;peak ill of the
<PB N="239" REF="263">
Queen, as well as King, they craved his royal pardon,
if any of them &s;hould, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, have tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed
any part of that &s;tatute.</P>
<P>HAVING obtained a gracious an&s;wer to the&s;e reque&s;ts,
the Parliament proceeded to an act of attainder for trea&s;on
again&s;t the Queen, and the vi&s;counte&s;s of Rocheford,
who had conducted her &s;ecret amours; and in this act
Colepeper, and Derham, were al&s;o comprized. At the
&s;ame time, they pa&s;&s;ed a bill of attainder for mi&s;pri&s;ion of
trea&s;on again&s;t the old dutche&s;s of Norfolk, Catherine's
grandmother, her uncle, lord William Howard, and his
lady, together with the counte&s;s of Bridgewater, and
nine per&s;ons more; becau&s;e they knew the Queen's vici|ous
life before her marriage, and yet concealed it. This
was an effect of Henry's u&s;ual extravagance, to expect
that parents &s;hould &s;o far forget the ties of natural affec|tion,
and the &s;entiments of &s;hame and decency, as to
reveal to him the mo&s;t &s;ecret di&s;orders of their family.
He him&s;elf &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of the cruelty of
this &s;entence: For he pardoned the dutche&s;s of Norfolk,
and mo&s;t of the others, condemned for mi&s;pri&s;ion o
trea&s;on.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to &s;ecure him&s;elf for the future, as well
as his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, from this fatal accident, he engaged
the Parliament to frame a law, equally full of extrava|gance.
It was enacted, that any one, who knew, or
vehemently pre&s;umed any guilt in the Queen, and did
not, within twenty days, di&s;clo&s;e it to the King or
council, &s;hould be guilty of trea&s;on; prohibiting every
one, at the &s;ame time, from &s;preading the matter abroad,
or even privately whi&s;pering it to others. It was al&s;o
enac$ed, that if the King married any woman, who had
been incontinent, taking her for a true maid, &s;he &s;hould
be guilty of trea&s;on, in ca&s;e &s;he did not previou&s;ly reveal
<PB N="240" REF="264">
her guilt to him. The people made merry with this ex|traordinary
clau&s;e, and &s;aid, that the King mu&s;t hence|forth
look out for a widow; for no reputed maid would
ever be per&s;uaded to incur the penalty of the &s;tatute<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 314.</NOTE>.
After all the&s;e laws were pa&s;&s;ed, the Queen was beheaded
on Tower-hill, together with the lady Rocheford. They
behaved in a manner &s;uitable to their di&s;&s;olute life; and
as the lady Rocheford was known to be the chief in&s;tru|ment,
who had brought Anne Boleyn to her end, &s;he
died unpitied; and men were farther confirmed, by the
di&s;covery of this woman's guilt, in the favourable &s;enti|ments
which they had entertained of that unfortunate
Queen.</P>
<P>THE King made no demand of any &s;ub&s;idies from this
Parliament; but he found means of enriching his ex|chequer
from another quarter: He took farther &s;teps to|wards
the di&s;&s;olution of colleges, ho&s;pitals, and other
foundations of that nature. The courtiers had been
practi&s;ing on the pre&s;idents and governors, to make a
&s;urrender of their revenues to the King; and they had
been &s;ucce&s;sful with eight of them. But there was an
ob&s;tacle to their farther progre&s;s: It had been provided,
by the local &s;tatutes of mo&s;t of the&s;e foundations, that no
pre&s;ident, nor any fellows, could make &s;uch a deed with|out
the unanimous vote of all the fellows; and this con|&s;ent
was not ea&s;ily obtained. All &s;uch &s;tatutes were now
annulled by Parliament; and the revenues of the&s;e hou&s;es,
&s;o u&s;eful to the public, were now laid open to the rapa|city
of the King and his favourites<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It was enacted by this Parliament, that there &s;hould be trial of trea|&s;on in any county where the King &s;hould appoint by commi&s;&s;ion. The &s;tatutes of trea&s;on had been extremely multiplied in this reign; and &s;uch an expedient &s;aved trouble and charges in trying that crime. The &s;ame Parliament erected Ireland into a kingdom; and Henry henceforth an|nexed the title of King of Ireland to his other titles. This &s;e&s;&s;ion, the commons fir&s;t began the practice of freeing any of their members, who were arre&s;ted, by a writ i&s;&s;ued by the &s;peaker. Formerly it was u&s;ual for them to apply for a writ from chancery to that purpo&s;e. This pre|cedent encrea&s;ed the authority of the commons, and had afterwards con&s;iderable con&s;equences. Holling&s;hed, p. 955, 956. Baker, p. 289.</NOTE>. The church had
<PB N="241" REF="265">
been &s;o long their prey, that nobody was &s;urprized at any
new inroads made upon it. From the regular, Henry
now proceeded to make deva&s;tations on the &s;ecular clergy.
He extorted from many of the bi&s;hops a &s;urrender of
chapter lands; and by this devi&s;e he pillaged the &s;ees of
Canterbury, York, and London, and enriched his greedy
para&s;ites and flatterers with their &s;poils.</P>
<P>THE clergy have been commonly &s;o fortunate as to
make a concern for their temporal intere&s;ts go hand in
hand with a jealou&s;y for orthodoxy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecele&s;ia&s;ti$ affairs.</NOTE> and both the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions
be regarded, by the people, ignorant and &s;uper&s;ti|tious,
as a zeal for religion: But the violent and head|&s;trong
character of Henry now disjoined the&s;e objects.
His rapacity was gratified by plundering the church; his
bigotry and arrogance by per&s;ecuting heretics. Though
he engaged the Parliament to mitigate the penalties of
the &s;ix articles, &s;o far as regards the marriage of prie&s;ts,
which was now only &s;ubjected to a forfeiture of goods,
chattels, and lands during life; he was &s;till equally bent
on maintaining a rigid purity in &s;peculative principles.
He had appointed a commi&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of the two
archbi&s;hops and &s;everal bi&s;hops of both provinces, to|gether
with a con&s;iderable number of doctors of divinity;
and by virtue of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy be had given
them in charge to choo&s;e a religion for his people. Be|fore
the commi&s;&s;ioners had made any progre&s;s in this ar|duous
undertaking, the Parliament, in 1541, had pa&s;&s;ed
a law, by which they ratified all the tenets, which the&s;e
divines &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h with the King's con&s;ent: And
<PB N="242" REF="266">
they were not a&s;hamed of expre&s;sly declaring that they took
their religion upon tru&s;t, and had no other rule, in reli|gious
as well as temporal concerns, than the arbitrary
will of their ma&s;ter. There is only one clau&s;e of the
&s;tatute, which may &s;eem at fir&s;t &s;ight to &s;avour &s;omewhat
of the &s;pirit of liberty: It was enacted that the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h nothing repugnant
to the laws and &s;tatutes of the realm. But in reality
this provi&s;o was in&s;erted by the King, to &s;erve his own
purpo&s;es. By introducing a confu&s;ion and contradiction
into the laws, he became more the ma&s;ter of every one's
life and property. And as the antient independance of the
church &s;till gave him jealou&s;y, he was well plea&s;ed, under
cover of &s;uch a clau&s;e, to introduce appeals from the
&s;piritual to the civil courts. It was for a like rea&s;on, that
he would never promulgate a body of canon law; and
encouraged the judges on all occa&s;ions to interpo&s;e in
eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es wherever they thought the law or
royal prerogative concerned. A happy innovation; tho'
at fir&s;t invented for arbitrary purpo&s;es!</P>
<P>THE King, armed by the authority of Parliament, or
rather by their acknowlegement of that &s;piritual &s;upre|macy,
which he believed inherent in him, employed his
commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;elect a &s;y&s;tem of tenets for the a&s;&s;ent
and belief of the nation. A &s;mall volume was &s;oon after
publi&s;hed, called, the <HI>In&s;titution of a Chri&s;tian Man,</HI>
which was received by the convocation, and voted to be
the infallible &s;tandard of orthodoxy. All the delicate
points of ju&s;tification, faith, free-will, good works, and
grace, are there defined, with a leaning towards the opi|nion
of the reformers: The &s;acraments, which a few
years before were only allowed to be three, are now en|crea&s;ed
to the number of &s;even, conformable to the &s;en|timents
of the catholics. The King's caprice is di&s;cern|able
<PB N="243" REF="267">
through the whole; and the book is in reality to be
regarded as his compo&s;ition. For Henry, while he made
his opinion a rule for the nation, would tye his own
hands by no canon or authority, not even by any which
he him&s;elf had formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE people had occa&s;ion &s;oon after to &s;ee a farther
in&s;tance of the King's incon&s;tancy. He was not long
&s;ati&s;fied with his In&s;titution of a Chri&s;tian Man: He
ordered a new book to be compo&s;ed, called, the <HI>Erudition
of a Chri&s;tian Man;</HI> and without a&s;king the a&s;&s;ent of the
convocation, he publi&s;hed, by his own authority, and
that of the Parliament, this new model of orthodoxy.
It differs from the In&s;titution<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 190.</NOTE>; but the King was no
le&s;s po&s;itive in his new creed than he had been in the
old; and he required the belief of the nation to veer
about at his &s;ignal. In both the&s;e books, he was parti|cularly
careful to inculcate the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience;
and he was no le&s;s careful to retain the nation
in the practice.</P>
<P>WHILE the King was &s;preading his own books among
the people, he &s;eems to have been extremely perplexed,
as well as the clergy, what cour&s;e to take with the Scrip|tures..
A review had been made by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
&s;ynod of the new tran&s;lation of the Bible; and Gardiner
had propo&s;ed, that, in&s;tead of employing Engli&s;h expre&s;|&s;ions
throughout, &s;everal Latin words &s;hould &s;till be pre|&s;erved,
becau&s;e they contained, as he pretended, &s;uch
peculiar energy and &s;ignificance, that they had no cor|re&s;pondent
terms in the vulgar tongue<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 315.</NOTE>. Among the&s;e
were <HI>ecle&s;ia, paenitentia, pontifex, contritus, holo$au&s;ta, &s;a|cramentum,
elementa, ceremonia, my&s;terium, pre&s;byte, &s;acri|ficium,
humilitas, &s;atisfactio, pecc$tum, gratia, ho&s;tia, cha|ritas,</HI>
&amp;c. But as this mixture would have appeared ex|tremely
<PB N="244" REF="268">
barbarous, and was plainly calculated for no
other purpo&s;e than to retain the people in their antient
ignorance, the propo&s;al was rejected. The knowledge of
the people, however, at lea&s;t their di&s;putative turn,
&s;eemed to be an inconvenience &s;till more dangerous; and
the King and Parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Which met on the 22d of January, 1543.</NOTE>, &s;oon after the publication of
the Scriptures, retracted the conce&s;&s;ion, which they had
formerly made; and prohibited all but gentlemen and
merchants to peru&s;e them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">33 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. Even that liberty was not
granted, without an apparent he&s;itation, and a dread of
the con&s;equences: The&s;e per&s;ons were allowed to read,
<HI>&s;o it be done quietly and with good order.</HI> And the preamble
to the act &s;ets forth, &startq;that many &s;editious and ignorant
per&s;ons had abu&s;ed the liberty granted them for read|ing
the Bible, and that great diver&s;ity of opinions,
animo&s;ities, tumults, and &s;chi&s;ms had been occa&s;ioned
by perverting the &s;en&s;e of the Scriptures.&endq; It &s;eemed
very difficult to reconcile the King's model for uniformity,
with the permi&s;&s;ion of free enquiry.</P>
<P>THE ma&s;s book al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed under the King's cognizance;
and little alteration was as yet made in it: Some doubtful
or fictitious &s;aints only were &s;truck out; and the name
of the pope was erazed. This latter precaution was like|wi&s;e
u&s;ed with regard to every new book that was printed,
or even old book that was &s;old. The word, Pope, was
carefully omitted or blotted out<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary hi&s;tory, vol. iii. p. 113.</NOTE>; as if that precaution
could aboli&s;h the term from the language, or as if &s;uch a
per&s;ecution of it did not rather imprint it more &s;trongly
in the memory of the people.</P>
<P>THE King took care about this time to clear the
churches of another abu&s;e, which had crept into them.
<PB N="245" REF="269">
Plays, interludes, and farces were there often acted in de|ri&s;ion
of the former &s;uper&s;titions; and the reverence of
the multitude for their antient principles and modes of
wor&s;hip, was thereby gradually effaced<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 318.</NOTE>. We do not
hear, that the catholics attempted to retaliate by employ|ing
this powerful engine again&s;t their adver&s;aries, or en|deavoured
by like arts to expo&s;e that fanatical &s;pirit, by
which, it appears, the reformers were often actuated.
Perhaps the people were not di&s;po&s;ed to reli&s;h a je&s;t on
that &s;ide: Perhaps the greater &s;implicity and the more
&s;piritual ab&s;tract wor&s;hip of the prote&s;tants, gave le&s;s hold
to ridicule, which is commonly founded on &s;en&s;ible re|pre&s;entations.
It was, therefore, a very agreeable con|ce&s;&s;ion,
which Henry made the catholic party, to &s;uppre&s;s
entirely the&s;e religious comedies.</P>
<P>THUS Henry laboured ince&s;&s;antly, by arguments,
creeds, and penal &s;tatutes, to bring his &s;ubjects to an uni|formity

<P>HENRY being determined to avenge him&s;elf of the
King of Scots for &s;lighting the advances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXIII.</NOTE> which
he made for his friend&s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1542.</NOTE> would gladly have obtained a
&s;upply from the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Scotland.</NOTE> to enable him to pro&s;ecute
that enterprize; but as he did not think it prudent to di&s;|cover
his intentions, the Parliament, conformable to their
frugal maxims, would under&s;tand no hints; and the
King was di&s;appointed in his expectations. He continued,
however, to make preparations for war; and &s;o &s;oon as
he thought him&s;elf in a condition to invade Scotland,
he publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, by which he endeavoured to
ju&s;tify his ho&s;tilities. He complained of James's di&s;ap|pointing
him in the promi&s;ed interview; which was the
real ground of the quarrel<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14. Drummond in James the fifth.</NOTE>: But in order to give a more
&s;pecious colouring to the enterprize, he mentioned other
injuries; that his nephew had given protection to &s;ome
Engli&s;h rebels and fugitives, and had detained &s;ome ter|ritory,
which, Henry pretended, belonged to England.
He even revived the old claim of the dependance of the
<PB N="247" REF="271">
crown of Scotland, and he &s;ummoned James to do ho|mage
to him as his liege lord and &s;uperior. He em|ployed
the duke of Norfolk, whom he called the &s;courge
of the Scots, to command in the war; and tho' James
&s;ent the bi&s;hop of Aberdeen, and Sir James Learmont of
Dar&s;ay, to appea&s;e his uncle, he would hearken to no
terms of accommodation. While Norfolk was a&s;&s;em|bling
his army at Newca&s;tle, Sir Robert Bowes, attended
with Sir Ralph Sadler, Sir Ralph Evers, Sir Brian
Latoun, and others, made an incur&s;ion into Scotland,
and advanced towards Jedburgh, with an intention of
pillaging and de&s;troying that town. The earl of Angus,
and George Douglas, his brother, who had been &s;o
many years bani&s;hed their country, and had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
by Henry's bounty, joined the Engli&s;h army in this
incur&s;ion; and the forces, commanded by Bowes, ex|ceeded
four thou&s;and men. James had not been negli|gent
in his preparations for defence, and had po&s;ted a
con&s;iderable body, under the command of the earl of
Huntley, for the protection of the borders. Lord Hume,
at the head of his va&s;&s;als, was ha&s;tening to join Huntley,
when he met with the Engli&s;h army; and a battle im|mediately
en&s;ued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 Augu&s;t</NOTE> While they were engaged, the forces
under Huntley began to appear; and the Engli&s;h,
afraid of being overpowered and &s;urrounded, took to
flight, and were pur&s;ued by the enemy. Evers, Latoun,
and &s;ome other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, were taken pri|&s;oners.
A few only of &s;mall note fell in this &s;kir|mi&s;h<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Norfolk, mean while, began to move
from his camp at Newca&s;tle; and being attended by the
earls of Shrew&s;bury, Derby, Cumberland, Surrey, Hert|ford,
Rutland, with many others of the nobility, he ad|vanced
<PB N="248" REF="272">
to the borders. His army amounted to above
twenty thou&s;and men; and it required the utmo&s;t efforts
of Scotland to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch formidable preparations. James
had a&s;&s;embled his whole military force at Fala and Sau|trey,
and was ready to advance &s;o &s;oon as he &s;hould be
informed of Norfolk's invading his kingdom. The Eng|li&s;h
pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed at Berwic, and advanced along the
banks of the river as far as Kel&s;o; but hearing that James
had gathered together near thirty thou&s;and men, they repa&s;|&s;ed
the river at that village, and retreated into their own
country<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 14.</NOTE>. The King of Scots, inflamed with a de&s;ire of
military glory, and of revenge on his invaders, gave the
&s;ignal for pur&s;uing them, and carrying the war into
England. He was &s;urprized to find, that his nobility,
who were generally di&s;affected on account of the prefe|rence,
which he had given the clergy, oppo&s;e$$ this re&s;o|lution,
and refu&s;ed to attend him in his projected enter|prize.
Enraged at this defection, he reproached them
with cowardice, and threatened vengeance; but &s;till re|&s;olved,
with the forces which adhered to him, to make
an impre&s;&s;ion on the enemy's country. He &s;ent ten
thou&s;and men to the we&s;tern borders, who entered Eng|land
at Solway firth; and he him&s;elf followed them at a
&s;mall di&s;tance, ready to join them upon occa&s;ion. Di&s;|gu&s;ted,
however, with the refractory di&s;po&s;ition of his
nobles, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the army, depriving lord
Maxwel, their general, of his commi&s;&s;ion, and confer|ring
the command on Oliver Sinclair, a private gentle|man,
who was his favourite. The army were extremely
di&s;plea&s;ed with this alteration, and were ready to di&s;|band;
when a &s;mall body of Engli&s;h appeared, not ex|ceeding
500 men, under the command of Dacres and
Mu&s;grave. A panic &s;eized the Scots, who immediately
<PB N="249" REF="273">
took to flight, and were pur&s;ued by the enemy. Few
were killed in this rout; for it was no action; but a
great many were taken pri&s;oners, and &s;ome of the princi|pal
nobility.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th No|vember. Victory at Solway.</NOTE> Among the&s;e were the earls of Ca&s;&s;ilis and
Glencairn; the lords Maxwel, Fleming, Sommerville,
Oliphant, Grey, who were all &s;ent to London, and gi|ven
in cu&s;tody to different noblemen.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots, hearing of this di&s;a&s;ter, was con|founded;
and being naturally of a melancholic di&s;po&s;i|tion,
as well as endowed with a high &s;pirit, he lo&s;t all command
of his temper on this di&s;mal occa&s;ion. Rage
again&s;t his nobility, who, he believed, had betrayed
him; &s;hame for a defeat by &s;uch unequal numbers; re|gret
of the pa&s;t, fear of the future; all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions &s;o
wrought upon him, that he would admit of no con&s;ola|tion,
but abandoned him&s;elf wholly to de&s;pair. His body
was wa&s;ted by &s;ympathy with his anxious mind; and
even his life began to be thought in danger. He had no
child living; and hearing that his Queen was &s;afely de|livered,
he a&s;ked whether &s;he had brought him a male or
female? Being told, the latter; he turned about in his
bed: &startq;The crown came with a woman,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;and it will go with one: Many mi&s;eries await this
poor kingdom: Henry will make it his own either by
force of arms or by marriage.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of De|cember. Death of James the fifth.</NOTE> A few days after, he
expired, in the flower of his age; a prince of con&s;ider|able
virtues and talents, well fitted, by his vigilance and
per&s;onal courage, for repre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e di&s;orders, to which,
his kingdom, during that age, was &s;o much expo&s;ed.
He executed ju&s;tice with the greate&s;t impartiality and ri|gour;
but as he &s;upported the commonalty and the
church again&s;t the rapine of the nobility, he e&s;caped
not the hatred of that order. The prote&s;tants al&s;o,
whom he repre&s;&s;ed, have endeavoured to throw many
<PB N="250" REF="274">
&s;tains on his memory; but have not been able to fix any
con&s;iderable imputation on him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The per&s;ecutions, exerci&s;ed during James's reign, are not to be a&s;cribed to his bigotry, a vice, of which he &s;eems to have been as free as Francis the fir&s;t or the emperor Charles, both of whom, as well as James, &s;hewed, in different periods of their lives, even an inclination to the new doctrines. The extremities to which all the&s;e princes were carried, proceeded entirely from the &s;ituation of affairs, during that age, which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to act with greater temper or moderation, after they had embraced the re&s;olution of &s;upporting the antient e&s;tabli&s;hments. So violent was the propen&s;ity of the times towards innovation, that a toleration of the new preachers was equiva|lent to a formed de&s;ign of changing the national religion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY was no &s;ooner informed of his victory and of
the death of his nephew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1543.</NOTE> than he projected, as James
had fore&s;een, the &s;cheme of uniting Scotland to his own
dominions, by marrying his &s;on, Edward, to the heire&s;s
of that kingdom<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 584. Herbert, Burnet, Buchanan.</NOTE>. He called together the Scots nobles,
who were his pri&s;oners; and after reproaching them, in
&s;evere terms, for their breach of treaty, as he pretended,
he began to &s;often his tone, and propo&s;ed to them this
expedient, by which, he hoped, tho&s;e di&s;orders, &s;o pre|judicial
to both &s;tates, would for the future be prevented.
He offered to be&s;tow on them their liberty without
ran&s;om; and only required of them engagements to fa|vour
the marriage of the Prince of Wales with their
young mi&s;tre&s;s. They were ea&s;ily prevailed on to give
their a&s;&s;ent to a propo&s;al, which &s;eemed &s;o natural, and
&s;o advantageous to both kingdoms; and being conducted
to Newca&s;tle, they delivered to the duke of Norfolk,
ho&s;tages for their return, in ca&s;e the intended nuptials
were not compleated: And they thence proceeded to
Scotland, where they found affairs in &s;ome confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Pope, finding his authority in Scotland expo&s;ed
to danger from the &s;preading of the new opinions, had
<PB N="251" REF="275">
be&s;towed on Beaton, the primate, the dignity of cardi|nal;
and that prelate had been long regarded as prime
mini&s;ter to James, and as the head of that party, which
defended the antient privileges and properties of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics.
Upon the death of his ma&s;ter, this man, ap|prehen&s;ive
of the con&s;equences both to his party and
him&s;elf, endeavoured to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power;
and for that purpo&s;e, he is accu&s;ed of executing a deed
which required a high degree of temerity. He forged,
it is &s;aid, a will for the King, appointing him&s;elf, and
three noblemen, regents of the kingdom during the mi|nority
of the infant Prince&s;s<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Sadler's Letters, p. 161. Spot&s;wood, p. 71. Buchanan, lib. 15.</NOTE>: At lea&s;t, for hi&s;torians
are not well agreed in the circum&s;tances of the fact, he
had read to James a paper of that import, to which that
monarch, during the delirium which preceded his death,
had given an imperfect a&s;&s;ent and approbation<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">John Knox, Hi&s;tory of the reformation.</NOTE>. By
virtue of this will, Beaton had put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the government; and having joined his intere&s;ts with
tho&s;e of the Queen-dowager, he obtained the con&s;ent of
the convention of &s;tates, and excluded the preten&s;ions of
the earl of Arran.</P>
<P>JAMES earl of Arran, of the name of Hamilton, was
next heir to the crown by his grandmother, daughter to
James the third; and on that account &s;eemed be&s;t entitled
to po&s;&s;e&s;s that high office, into which the cardinal had
intruded him&s;elf. The pro&s;pect al&s;o of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion af|ter
a prince&s;s, who was in &s;uch tender infancy, procured
him many partizans; and though his character contained
little &s;pirit, activity, or ambition, a propen&s;ity, which he
had di&s;covered for the new opinions, had attached to
him all the zealous promoters of the&s;e innovations. By
means of the&s;e adherents, joined to the va&s;&s;als of his
<PB N="252" REF="276">
family, he had been able to make oppo&s;ition to the car|dinal's
admini&s;tration; and the &s;u&s;picion of Beaton's
forgery, with the acce&s;&s;ion of the noblemen, who had
been pri&s;oners in England, a&s;&s;i&s;ted too by &s;ome money,
&s;ent from London, was able to turn the balance in his
favour. The earl of Angus, and his brother, having
taken the pre&s;ent opportunity of returning into their
own country, oppo&s;ed the cardinal with all the force of
that powerful family; and the majority of the conven|tion
had now embraced oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts to tho&s;e which
formerly prevailed. Arran was declared governor; the
cardinal was committed to cu&s;tody under the care of
lord Seton; and a negotiation was commenced with Sir
Ralph Sadler, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, for the marriage
of the infant Queen with the Prince of Wales. The
following conditions were quickly agreed on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with Scot|land.</NOTE> that the
Queen &s;hould remain in Scotland till &s;he was ten years
of age; that &s;he &s;hould then be &s;ent to England to be
educated; that &s;ix Scots nobles &s;hould immediately be
delivered as ho&s;tages to Henry; and that the kingdom,
notwith&s;tanding its union with England, &s;hould &s;till pre|&s;erve
its laws and privileges<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sir Ralph Sadler's Letters.</NOTE>. By means of the&s;e equi|table
conditions, the war between the nations, which
had threatened Scotland with &s;uch di&s;mal calamities,
&s;eemed to be fully compo&s;ed, and to be changed into
perpetual concord and unanimity.</P>
<P>BUT the cardinal-primate, having prevailed on Seton
to re&s;tore him to his liberty, was able, by his intrigues,
to confound all the&s;e mea&s;ures, which appeared to be &s;o
well concerted. He a&s;&s;embled the mo&s;t considerable ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics;
and having repre&s;ented to them the imminent
danger, to which their revenues and privileges were ex|po&s;ed,
he per&s;uaded them to collect privately from the
<PB N="253" REF="277">
clergy a large &s;um of money, by which, if entru&s;ted to
his management, he promi&s;ed to overturn the &s;chemes
of their enemies<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 15.</NOTE>. Be&s;ides the partizans, whom he ac|quired
by pecuniary motives, he rouzed up the zeal of
tho&s;e, who were attached to the catholic wor&s;hip; and
he repre&s;ented the union with England as the &s;ure fore|runner
of ruin to the church and to the antient religion.
The national antipathy of the Scots again&s;t the Engli&s;h.
nation, was al&s;o an infallible engine, by which the car|dinal
wrought upon the people; and though the terror
of Henry's arms, and their inability to make re&s;i&s;tance,
had procured a temporary a&s;&s;ent to the alliance and mar|riage
propo&s;ed, the &s;ettled habits of the nation produced
an extreme aver&s;ion to tho&s;e mea&s;ures. The Engli&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador and his train received many in&s;ults from per|&s;ons
whom the cardinal had incited to commit tho&s;e
indignities, in hopes of bringing on a rupture. But
Sadler very prudently di&s;&s;embled the matter; and waited
patiently till the day appointed for the delivery of the
ho&s;tages. He then demanded of the regent the perform|ance
of that important article; but received for an&s;wer,
that his authority was very precarious, that the nation
had now taken a different impre&s;&s;ion, and that it was
not in his power to compel any of the nobility to deliver
them&s;elves as ho&s;tages to the Engli&s;h. Sadler, fore&s;ee|ing
the con&s;equence of this refu&s;al, &s;ent a &s;ummons to
all tho&s;e who had been pri&s;oners in England, and re|quired
them to fulfil the promi&s;e which they had given
of returning into cu&s;tody. None of them &s;howed &s;o
much &s;entiment of honour, as to perform their engage|ments,
except Gilbert Kennedy, earl of Ca&s;&s;ilis. Henry
was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the behaviour of this nobleman,
that he not only received him graciou&s;ly, but honoured
<PB N="254" REF="278">
him with pre&s;ents, gave him his liberty, and &s;ent him
back to Scotland, with his two brothers, whom he had
left as ho&s;tages<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS behaviour of the Scots nobles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New rup|ture.</NOTE> though it reflect|ed
di&s;honour on the nation, was not unacceptable to the
cardinal, who fore&s;aw, that all the&s;e per&s;ons would now
be deeply intere&s;ted to maintain their enmity and oppo|&s;ition
to the Engli&s;h. And as a war was &s;oon expected
with that kingdom, he found it nece&s;&s;ary immediately to
apply to France, and to crave the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that an|tient
ally, during the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Scots na|tion.
Though Francis was fully &s;en&s;ible of his intere&s;t
in &s;upporting Scotland, a demand of aid could not have
been made on him at a more un&s;ea&s;onable juncture. His
preten&s;ions on the Milane&s;e, and his re&s;entment again&s;t
Charles, had engaged him in a war with that potentate;
and having made very great, though fruitle&s;s efforts
during the preceding campaign, he was the more di&s;abled
at pre&s;ent from defending his own dominions, much
more from granting any &s;uccour to the Scots. Matthew
Stuart, earl of Lenox, a young nobleman of a great fa|mily,
was at that time in the French court; and Francis,
being informed, that he was engaged in ancient and he|reditary
enmity with the Hamiltons, who had murdered
his father, &s;ent him over to his native country, as a &s;up|port
to the cardinal and the Queen-mother: And he pro|mi&s;ed,
that a &s;upply of money, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, even
military &s;uccours, &s;hould &s;oon be di&s;patched after him.
Arran, the governor, &s;eeing all the&s;e preparations again&s;t
him, a&s;&s;embled his friends, and made an attempt to get
the per&s;on of the infant Queen into his cu&s;tody; but
being repul&s;ed, he was obliged to come to an accommo|dation
with his enemies, and to entru&s;t that precious
<PB N="255" REF="279">
charge to four neutral per&s;ons, the heads of potent fami|lies,
the Grahams, Are&s;kines, Lind&s;eys, and Levi&s;tons.
The arrival of Lenox, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions,
&s;erved to render the victory of the French party over
the Engli&s;h &s;till more undi&s;putable<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 15. Drummond.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE oppo&s;ition which Henry met with in Scotland
$rom the French intrigues, excited his re&s;entment, and
farther confirmed the re&s;olution which he had before
taken, of breaking with France, and of uniting his
arms with tho&s;e of the emperor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with France.</NOTE> He had other grounds
of complaint again&s;t the French King; which, though
they were not of great importance, yet being recent,
were able to overbalance tho&s;e great injuries which he
had formerly received from Charles. He pretended, that
Francis had engaged to imitate his example in &s;eparating
him&s;elf entirely from the &s;ee of Rome, and that he had
broke his promi&s;e in that particular. He was di&s;&s;atisfied,
that James, his nephew, had been allowed to marry,
fir&s;t Magdalene of France, then a prince&s;s of the hou&s;e
of Gui&s;e; and he $on&s;idered the&s;e alliances as pledges
which Francis gave of his intentions to &s;upport the Scots
again&s;t the power of England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel.</NOTE>. He had been informed
of &s;ome railleries, which the French King had thrown
out again&s;t his conduct with regard to his wives. He
was di&s;gu&s;ted, that Francis, after &s;o many obligations
which he owed him, had &s;acrificed him to the emperor;
and, in the confidence of friend&s;hip, had ra&s;hly revealed
his &s;ecrets to that &s;ubtle and intere&s;ted monarch. And
he complained, that regular payments were never made
of the &s;ums due to him by France, and of the pen&s;ion
which had been promi&s;ed. Impelled by all the&s;e motives,
he alienated him&s;elf from his ancient friend and confe|derate,
and formed a league with the emperor, who very
<PB N="256" REF="280">
earne&s;tly courted his alliance. This league, be&s;ides &s;ti|pulations
for mutual defence, contained a plan for in|$ading
France; and the two monarchs agreed to enter
Francis's dominions with an army, each of twenty-five
thou&s;and men; and to require that prince to pay Henry
all the &s;ums which he owed him, and to con&s;ign Bou|logne,
Montreuil, Terouenne, and Ardres, as a &s;ecurity
for the regular payment of his pen&s;ion for the future: In
ca&s;e the&s;e conditions were rejected, the confederate princes
agreed, to challenge, for Henry, the crown of France,
and the dutchies of Normandy, Aquitaine, and Guienne;
for Charles, the dutchy of Burgundy, and &s;ome other
territories<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiv. p. 768. vol. xv. p. 2.</NOTE>. That they might have a pretence for en|forcing
the&s;e claims, they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Francis, re|quiring
him to renounce his alliance with Sultan Soly|man,
and to make reparation for all the prejudice which
Chri&s;tendom had &s;uffered from that unnatural confede|racy.
Upon the French King's refu&s;al, war was de|clared
again&s;t him by the confederates. It may be pro|per
to ob&s;erve, that the partizans of France objected to
Charles his alliance with the heretical King of England,
as no le&s;s odious than that which Francis had contracted
with Solyman: And they ob&s;erved, that this league was
a breach of that &s;olemn promi&s;e which he had given to
Clement the &s;eventh, never to make peace or alliance
with England.</P>
<P>WHILE the treaty with the emperor was negociating,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Ja|nuary. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE>
the King &s;ummoned a new &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, in or|der
to obtain &s;upplies for his projected war with France.
The Parliament granted him a &s;ub&s;idy to be paid in three
years: It was levied in a peculiar manner; but exceeded
not three &s;hillings in the pound upon any individual<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">They who were worth in goods twenty &s;hillings and upwards to five pounds, paid four pence of every pound; from five pounds to ten pounds, eight pence; from ten pounds to twenty pounds, &s;ixteen pence; from twenty and upwards, two &s;hillings.

always, even during the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the catholic re|ligion,
exacted from the clergy than the laity: Which
made the emperor Charles &s;ay, when Henry di&s;&s;olved the

which brought him the golden eggs<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament al&s;o facilitated the execution of
the former law, by which the King's proclamations
were made equal to &s;tatutes: They appointed, that any
nine coun&s;ellors &s;hould form a legal court for puni&s;hing
all di&s;obedience to proclamations. The total abolition
of juries in criminal cau&s;es, as well as of all parliaments,
&s;eemed, if the King had &s;o plea&s;ed, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence
of this enormous law. He might i&s;&s;ue a procla|mation,
for the execution of any penal &s;tatute, and af|terwards
try the criminals, not for breach of the &s;tatute,
but for di&s;obedience to his proclamation. It is remark|able,
that the lord Mountjoy entered a prote&s;t again&s;t
this law; and it is equally remarkable, that that prote&s;t
is the only one which was entered again&s;t any public
bill during this whole reign<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE have taken notice, in the end of the former chap|ter,
of &s;ome laws regarding religion, which the Parlia|ment
pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, in order to gratify the King's
humour. It was farther enacted<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">34 &amp; 35 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>, that every &s;piritual
<PB N="258" REF="282">
per&s;on, who preached or taught contrary to the doctrine
contained in the King's book, the <HI>Erudition of a chri&s;tian
man,</HI> or contrary to any doctrine which he &s;hall <HI>hence|forth</HI>
promulgate, was to be admitted on the fir&s;t convic|tion
to renounce his errors; on the &s;econd, he was re|quired
to carry a faggot; which if he refu&s;ed to do, or
fell into a third offence, he was to be burnt. But the
laity, for the third offence, were only to forfeit their
goods and chattels, and to be liable to perpetual impri|&s;onment.
Indictments mu&s;t be laid within a year after
the offence, and the pri&s;oner was allowed to bring wit|ne&s;&s;es
for his purgation. The&s;e penalties were lighter
than tho&s;e formerly impo&s;ed on a denial of tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation:
It was, however, &s;ubjoined in this &s;tatute, that
the act of the &s;ix articles was &s;till in force. But in order
to make the King more entirely ma&s;ter of his people,
it was enacted, that he might hereafter, at his plea&s;ure,
change this act, or any provi&s;ion in it. By this clau&s;e,
both parties were retained in &s;ubjection; &s;o far as regard|ed
religion, the King was inve&s;ted, in the fulle&s;t man|ner,
with the &s;ole legi&s;lative authority in his kingdom;
and all his &s;ubjects were, under the &s;ever&s;t penalties,
expre&s;sly bound to receive implicitly, whatever doctrine
he &s;hould plea&s;e to recommend to them.</P>
<P>THE reformers began to entertain hopes, that this
exorbitant power would be employed in their favour.
The King married Catherine Par,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$th July.</NOTE> widow to Nevil lord
Latimer; a woman of virtue, and &s;omewhat inclined to
the new doctrine. By this marriage, Henry made good
what had formerly been foretold in je&s;t, that he would
be obliged to e&s;pou&s;e a widow. The King's league with
the emperor, &s;eemed to be a circum&s;tance no le&s;s fa|vourable
to the catholic party; and thus matters remained
&s;till nearly balanced between the factions.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="283">
THE advantages gained by this powerful confederacy
between Henry and Charles, were very incon&s;iderable
during the pre&s;ent year. The campaign was opened with
a victory, gained by the duke of Cleves, Francis's ally,
over the forces of the emperor<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Memoires du Bellay, lib. 10.</NOTE>: Francis, in per&s;on,
took the field early; and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter, without
re&s;i&s;tance, of the whole dutchy of Luxembourg: He
afterwards took Landrecy, and added &s;ome fortifications
to it. Charles, having at la&s;t a&s;&s;embled a powerful ar|my,
appeared in the Low Countries; and after taking
almo&s;t every fortre&s;s in the dutchy of Cleves, he reduced
the duke to &s;ubmit to the terms which he was plea&s;ed to
pre&s;cribe to him. Being then joined by a body of &s;ix
thou&s;and Engli&s;h, he &s;at down before Landrecy, and
covered the &s;iege with an army of above forty thou&s;and
men. Francis advanced at the head of an army not
much inferior; as if he intended to give the emperor
battle, or oblige him to abandon the &s;iege: But while
the&s;e two rival monarchs were facing each other, and
all the world &s;tood in expectation of &s;ome great event;
the French found means to throw &s;uccours into Lan|drecy,
and having thus effected their purpo&s;e, they &s;kil|fully
made a retreat. Charles, finding the &s;ea&s;on far ad|vanced,
de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s in his enterprize, and found
it nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e the &s;iege.</P>
<P>THE vanity of Henry was flattered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> by the figure
which he made in the great tran&s;actions on the conti|nent:
But the intere&s;ts of his kingdom were much more
deeply concerned in the event of affairs in Scotland.
Arran, the governor, was of &s;o indolent and unambi|tious
a character, that had he not been &s;timulated by
his friends and dependants, he never had a&s;pired to any
&s;hare in the admini&s;tration; and when he found him|&s;elf
<PB N="260" REF="284">
overpowered by the party of the Queen-dowageer, the
cardinal, and the earl of Lenox, he was glad to accept
of any terms of accommodation, however di&s;honourable.
He even gave them a &s;ure pledge of his &s;incerity, by re|nouncing
the principles of the reformers, and reconciling
him&s;elf to the Romi&s;h communion in the Franci&s;can
church at Stirling. By this weakne&s;s and levity he lo&s;t
his credit with the whole nation, and rendered the pro|te&s;tants,
who were hitherto the chief &s;upport of his
power, his mo&s;t mortal enemies. The cardinal acquired
the entire a&s;cendant in the kingdom: The Queen-dow|ager
put implicit confidence in him: The governor was
obliged to yield to him in every preten&s;ion: Lenox alone
was become an ob&s;tacle to his mea&s;ures, and reduced
him to &s;ome difficulty.</P>
<P>THE inveterate enmity which had taken place between
the families of Lenox and Arran, made the intere&s;ts
of the&s;e two noblemen entirely incompatible; and as the
cardinal and the French party, in order to engage Lenox
the more in their cau&s;e, had flattered him with the hopes
of &s;ucceeding to the crown after their infant &s;overeign,
this rival&s;hip had tended &s;till farther to rouze the animo|&s;ity
of the Hamiltons. Lenox too had been encouraged
to a&s;pire to the marriage of the Queen-dowager, which
would have given him &s;ome preten&s;ions to the regency;
and as he was become a&s;&s;uming, on account of the &s;er|vices
which he had rendered the party, the cardinal
found, that, &s;ince he mu&s;t choo&s;e between the friend|&s;hip
of Lenox and Arran, the latter nobleman, who
was more ea&s;ily governed, and who was inve&s;ted with
pre&s;ent authority, was in every re&s;pect preferable. In
order to remove the former, after the ea&s;ie&s;t and lea&s;t ob|noxious
manner, he wrote to Francis, with whom he
had entire credit, by means of the duke of Gui&s;e, father
to the Queen-dowager; and after prai&s;ing Lenox for his
<PB N="261" REF="285">
pa&s;t &s;ervices, he repre&s;ented the pre&s;ent difficulties and
ob&s;tructions, which he occa&s;ioned in the admini&s;tration,
and de&s;ired that he might be recalled to France, where
he enjoyed great credit and large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But the
impatience of Lenox to attain his purpo&s;es, allowed not
this political artifice lei&s;ure to operate. Finding that he
was not likely to &s;ucceed in his preten&s;ions to the Queen|dowager,
and that Arran prevailed in every conte&s;t, he
retired to Dunbarton, the governor of which was en|tirely
in his intere&s;ts; he entered into a &s;ecret negocia|tion
with the Engli&s;h court; and he &s;ummoned his va&s;|&s;als
and partizans to attend him. All tho&s;e who were
inclined to the prote&s;tant religion, or were on any ac|count
di&s;contented with the cardinal's admini&s;tration,
now regarded Lenox as the head of their party; and
they readily made him a tender of their &s;ervices. In a
little time, he had collected an army of ten thou&s;and
men, and he threatened his enemies with immediate de|&s;truction.
The cardinal had no equal force to oppo&s;e to
him; but as he was a prudent man, he fore&s;aw that Le|nox
could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;o great an army, and he en|deavoured
to protract time, by opening a negociation
with him. He &s;educed his followers, by various arti|fices;
he engaged the Dougla&s;&s;es in his intere&s;ts; he re|pre&s;ented
to the whole nation the danger of civil wars
and commotions. And Lenox, finding him&s;elf engaged
in an unequal conte&s;t, was at la&s;t obliged to lay down
his arms, and to accept of terms of accommodation with
the governor and the cardinal. Pre&s;ent peace was re|&s;tored;
but no confidence took place between the par|ties.
Lenox, fortifying his ca&s;tles, and putting him|&s;elf
in a po&s;ture of defence, waited the &s;uccours of the
Engli&s;h, from who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance alone he expected to ob|tain
the &s;uperiority over his enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="286">
WHILE the winter &s;ea&s;on re&s;trained Henry from mili|tary
operations, he &s;ummoned a new Parliament; where
a law was pa&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1544.</NOTE> &s;uch as he was plea&s;ed to dictate, with
regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 Janu|ary. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> After declaring,
that the prince of Wales, or any of the King's male
i&s;&s;ue, were fir&s;t and immediate heirs to the kingdom, the
Parliament re&s;tored the two prince&s;&s;es, Mary and Eliza|beth,
to their right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This &s;eemed a rea|&s;onable
piece of ju&s;tice, and corrected what the King's
former violence had thrown into confu&s;ion; but it was
impo&s;&s;ible for Henry to do any thing, however laudable,
without betraying, in &s;ome circum&s;tances, his u&s;ual ca|price
and extravagance: Though he opened the way for
the&s;e two prince&s;&s;es to mount the throne, he would not
allow the act to be rever&s;ed which had declared them
both illegitimate; he made the Parliament confer on
him a power of &s;till excluding them, if they refu&s;ed to
&s;ubmit to any conditions which he &s;hould be plea&s;ed to
impo&s;e; and he required them to enact, that, in default
of his own i&s;&s;ue, he might di&s;po&s;e of the crown, as he
plea&s;ed, by will or letters patent. He did not probably
fore&s;ee, that in proportion as he degraded the Parlia|ment,
by rendering them the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument of his
variable and violent inclinations, he taught the people to
regard all their acts as invalid, and thereby defeated even
the purpo&s;es which he was &s;o bent to attain.</P>
<P>AN act was pa&s;&s;ed, that the King's u&s;ual &s;tile &s;hould
be &startq;King of England, France, and Ireland, defender
of the faith, and on earth the &s;upreme head of the
church of England and Ireland.&endq; It &s;eemed a pal|pable
incon&s;i&s;tency, to retain the title of Defender of the
faith, which the &s;ee of Rome had conferred on him for
maintaining its cau&s;e again&s;t Luther; and yet &s;ubjoin his
eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy, in oppo&s;ition to the claims of
that &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="287">
AN act was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, for the remi&s;&s;ion of the debts,
which the King had lately contracted by a general loan,
exacted from the people. It will ea&s;ily be believed, that,
after the former act of this kind, the loan was not en|tirely
voluntary<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">35 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>. But there was a peculiar circum&s;tance
attending the pre&s;ent &s;tatute, which none but Henry would
have thought of: That tho&s;e who had already got pay|ment,
either in whole or in part, &s;hould refund the &s;ums
to the exchequer.</P>
<P>THE oaths which Henry e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;ecurity
of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical model, were not more rea&s;onable
than his other mea&s;ures. All his &s;ubjects of any di&s;|tinction
had already been obliged to renounce the pope's
&s;upremacy; but as the clau&s;es which they &s;wore to, had
not been deemed entirely &s;atisfactory, another oath was
impo&s;ed, and it was added, that all tho&s;e who had taken
the former oaths, &s;hould be under&s;tood to have taken
the new one<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">35 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. A &s;trange &s;uppo&s;ition! to repre&s;ent men
as bound by an oath which they had never con&s;ented to
take.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t commendable act to which the Parliament
gave their &s;anction, was that by which they mitigated
the law of the &s;ix articles, and ordained, that no per|&s;on
&s;hould be put to his trial upon any accu&s;ation con|cerning
any of the offences comprized in that &s;anguinary
&s;tatute, except on the oath of twelve per&s;ons before
commi&s;&s;ioners authorized for that purpo&s;e; and that no
per&s;on &s;hould be arre&s;ted or committed to ward for any
&s;uch offence before he was indicted. Any preacher, ac|cu&s;ed
of &s;peaking in his &s;ermon contrary to the&s;e arti|cles,
mu&s;t be indicted within forty days.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="288">
THE King always experienced the limits of his exor|bitant
authority whenever he demanded &s;ub&s;idies, how|ever
moderate, from the Parliament; and, therefore,
not to hazard a refu&s;al, he made no mention this &s;e&s;&s;ion
of a &s;upply: But as his wars both with France and
Scotland, as well as his u&s;ual prodigality, had involved
him in great expence, he had recour&s;e to other methods
of filling his trea&s;ury: Notwith&s;tanding the former abo|lition
of his debts, he yet required new loans from his
&s;ubjects: And he enhanced gold from forty-five &s;hillings
to forty-eight an ounce; and &s;ilver from three &s;hillings
and nine pence to four &s;hillings. His pretence for this
innovation, was to prevent the money from being ex|ported;
as if that expedient could anywi&s;e &s;erve the
purpo&s;e. He even coined &s;ome ba&s;e money, and ordered
it to be current by his proclamation. He named com|mi&s;&s;ioners
for levying a benevolence, and he extorted
about &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds by that expedient. Read,
alderman of London<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe, p. 588. Baker, p. 292.</NOTE>, a man &s;omewhat advanced in
years, having refu&s;ed to contribute his &s;hare, or not
coming up to the expectations of the commi&s;&s;ioners,
was inrolled as a foot &s;oldier in the Scotti&s;h wars, and
was there taken pri&s;oner. Roach, who had been equal|ly
refractory, was thrown into pri&s;on, and obtained not
his liberty but by paying a large compo&s;ition<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals. Stowe, p. 588.</NOTE>. The&s;e
powers of the prerogative, (which at that time pa&s;&s;ed
for unque&s;tioned) the King's compelling any man to
&s;erve in any office, and impri&s;oning any man during
plea&s;ure, not to mention the practice of extorting loans,
rendered the &s;overeign, in a manner, ab&s;olute ma&s;ter
of the per&s;on and property of every individual.</P>
<P>EARLY this year the King &s;ent a fleet and army to
invade Scotland. The fleet con&s;i&s;ted of near two
<PB N="265" REF="289">
hundred ve&s;&s;els, and carried on board ten thou&s;and men.
Dudley lord Li&s;le commanded the &s;ea forces; the earl of
Hertford the land. The troops were di&s;embarked near
Leith; and after di&s;&s;ipating a &s;mall body which oppo&s;ed
them, they took that town without re&s;i&s;tance, and then
marched to Edinburgh. The gates were &s;oon beat down
(for little or no re&s;i&s;tance was made); and the Engli&s;h
fir&s;t pillaged, and then &s;et fire to the city. The regent
and cardinal were not prepared to oppo&s;e &s;o great a force,
and they fled to Stirling. Hertford marched ea&s;tward;
and being joined by a new body under Evers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th May.</NOTE> warden
of the ea&s;t marches, he laid wa&s;te the whole country,
burned and de&s;troyed Haddington and Dunbar, and then
retired into England; having lo&s;t only forty men in the
whole expedition. The earl of Arran collected &s;ome
forces; but finding that the Engli&s;h were already de|parted,
he turned them again&s;t Lenox, who was ju&s;tly
&s;u&s;pected of a corre&s;pondence with the enemy. That
nobleman, after making &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, was obliged to
fly into England; where Henry &s;ettled a pen&s;ion on
him, and even gave him his niece, the lady Margaret
Douglas, in marriage. In return, Lenox &s;tipulated con|ditions,
by which, had he been able to execute them,
he mu&s;t have reduced his country to a total &s;ervitude<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xv. p. 23, 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY's policy was blamed in this &s;udden and vio|lent
incur&s;ion; by which he inflamed the pa&s;&s;ion of the
Scots, without &s;ubduing their &s;pirit; and it was com|monly
&s;aid, that he did too much, if he intended to &s;o|licit
an alliance, and too little, if he meant a conque&s;t<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Burnet.</NOTE>.
But the rea&s;on of his withdrawing the troops &s;o &s;oon, was
his eagerne&s;s to carry on his projected enterprize again&s;t
France, in which he intended to employ the whole force
of his kingdom. He had concerted a plan with the em|peror,
<PB N="266" REF="290">
which threatened the total ruin of that monar|chy,
and mu&s;t, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, have in|volved
the &s;ubjection of England. The&s;e two princes
had agreed to invade France with forces amounting to
above a hundred thou&s;and men: Henry engaged to &s;et
out from Calais; Charles from the Low Countries:
They were to enter on no &s;iege, but leaving all the fron|tier
towns behind them, to march directly to Paris, where
they were to join their forces, and thence to proceed
to the entire conque&s;t of the kingdom. Francis could
not oppo&s;e to the&s;e formidable preparations, much above
forty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>HENRY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th July. Campaign in France.</NOTE> having appointed the Queen regent during
his ab&s;ence, pa&s;&s;ed over to Calais with thirty thou&s;and
men, accompanied with the dukes of Norfolk and Suf|folk,
Fitzalan earl of Arundel, Vere earl of Oxford,
the earl of Surrey, Paulet lord St. John, lord Ferrers
of Chartley, lord Mountjoy, lord Grey of Wilton, Sir
Anthony Brown, Sir Francis Bryan, and the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing
nobility and gentry of his kingdom. The Eng|li&s;h
army was &s;oon joined by the count de Buren, admi|ral
of Flanders, with ten thou&s;and foot, and four thou|&s;and
hor&s;e; and the whole compo&s;ed an army, which
nothing on that frontier was able to re&s;i&s;t. The chief
force of the French army was drawn to the &s;ide of Cham|pagne,
in order to oppo&s;e the imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE emperor, with an army of near &s;ixty thou&s;and
men, had taken the field much earlier than Henry; and
not to lo&s;e time, while he waited for the march of his
confederate, he &s;at down before Luxembourg, which he
took: He thence proceeded to Commercy on the Meu&s;e,
which was &s;urrendered to him: Ligny met with the
&s;ame fate: He next laid &s;iege to St. Di&s;ier on the Marne&punc;
which, though a weak place, made a brave re&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="267" REF="291">
under the count de Sancerre, the governor, and the &s;iege
was protracted beyond expectation.</P>
<P>THE emperor was employed before this town at the
time the Engli&s;h forces were a&s;&s;embled in Picardy.
Henry, either tempted by the defencele&s;s condition of
the French frontiers, or thinking that the emperor had
fir&s;t broke engagements by forming &s;ieges, or, perhaps,
fore&s;eeing at la&s;t the dangerous con&s;equences of de&s;troy|ing
entirely the French power, in&s;tead of marching for|ward
to Paris, &s;at down before Montreuil and Boulogne.
The duke of Norfolk commanded the army before Mon|treuil:
The King him&s;elf that before Boulogne. Ver|vin
was governor of Boulogne, and under him Philip
Cor&s;e, a brave old &s;oldier, who encouraged the garri&s;on
to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity again&s;t the
Engli&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Sep|tember.</NOTE> He was killed during the cour&s;e of the &s;iege,
and the town was immediately &s;urrendered to Henry by
the cowardice of Vervin; who was afterwards beheaded
for this di&s;honourable capitulation.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of this &s;iege, Charles had taken
St. Di&s;ier; and finding the &s;ea&s;on much advanced, he
began to hearken to a treaty of peace with France, &s;ince
all his &s;chemes for &s;ubduing that kingdom were likely to
prove abortive. In order to have a pretence for de&s;erting
his ally, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the Engli&s;h camp, re|quiring
Henry immediately to fulfil his engagements, and
to meet him with his army before Paris. Henry replied,
that he was too far engaged in the &s;iege of Boulogne to
rai&s;e it with honour, and that the emperor him&s;elf had
fir&s;t broke the concert by forming &s;ieges. This an&s;wer
&s;erved Charles as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for concluding a
peace with Francis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Sep|tember.</NOTE> at Crepy, where no mention was
made of the Engli&s;h. He &s;tipulated to give Flanders as
a dowry to his daughter, whom he agreed to marry to
<PB N="268" REF="292">
the duke of Orleans, Francis's &s;econd &s;on; and Francis,
in return, withdrew his troops from Piemont and Savoy,
and renounced all claim to Milan, Naples, and other ter|ritories
in Italy. This peace, &s;o advantageous to Fran|cis,
was procured partly by the deci&s;ive victory obtained
in the beginning of the campaign by the count d'Anguy|en
over the imperiali&s;ts at Ceri&s;olles in Piemont, partly
by the emperor's great de&s;ire to turn his arms again&s;t the
prote&s;tant princes in Germany. Charles ordered his
troops to &s;eparate from the Engli&s;h in Picardy; and
Henry, finding him&s;elf obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Mon|treuil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Sep|tember.</NOTE>
returned into England. This campaign &s;erved,
to the populace, as matter of great triumph; but all men
of &s;en&s;e concluded, that the King had, as in all his for|mer
military enterprizes, made, at an infinite charge, an
acqui&s;ition which was of no manner of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>THE war with Scotland, meanwhile, was conducted
feebly, and with various &s;ucce&s;s. Sir Ralph Evers, now
lord Evers, and Sir Bryan Latoun, made an inroad into
that kingdom; and having laid wa&s;te the counties of Ti|viotdale
and the Mer&s;e, they proceeded to the abbey of
Coldingham, which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and fortified.
The regent a&s;&s;embled an army of eight thou&s;and men, in
order to di&s;lodge them from this po&s;t; but he had no
&s;ooner opened his batteries before the place, than a &s;ud|den
panic &s;eized him, and he fled to Dunbar. He com|plained
of the mutinies of his army, and pretended to be
afraid le&s;t they &s;hould deliver him into the hands of the
Engli&s;h: But hid own unwarlike &s;pirit was generally be|lieved
to have been the motive of this di&s;honourable re|treat.
The Scots army, upon the departure of their
general, immediately fell into confu&s;ion; and had not
Angus, with a few of his retainers, brought off the can|non,
and protected their rear, the Engli&s;h might have
gained great advantages over them. Evers, elated with
<PB N="269" REF="293">
this &s;ucce&s;s, boa&s;ted to Henry, that he had conquered
all Scotland to the Forth; and he claimed a reward for
this important &s;ervice. The duke of Norfolk, who knew
with what difficulty &s;uch acqui&s;itions would be maintain|ed
again&s;t a warlike people, advi&s;ed the King to grant
him, as his reward, the conque&s;ts of which he &s;o highly
boa&s;ted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1545.</NOTE> The next inroad made by the Engli&s;h, &s;hewed
the vanity of Evers's hopes. This general led about
five thou&s;and men into Tiviotdale, and was employed in
ravaging that country; when intelligence was brought
him, that &s;ome Scots forces appeared near the abbey of
Melro&s;s. Angus had excited the regent to more activity;
and a proclamation being i&s;&s;ued for a&s;&s;embling the troops
of the neighbouring counties, a con&s;iderable body had
repaired to his &s;tandard. Norman Le&s;ly, &s;on to the earl
of Rothes, had al&s;o joined the army with &s;ome volun|teers
from Fife; and he in&s;pired courage into the whole,
as well by this acce&s;&s;ion of force, as by his per&s;onal bra|very
and intrepidity. In order to bring their troops to
the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;teady defence, the Scots leaders or|dered
all their cavalry to di&s;mount; and they re&s;olved to
wait, on &s;ome high grounds at Ancram, the a&s;&s;ault of
the Engli&s;h. The Engli&s;h, who&s;e pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es had
taught them too much to de&s;pi&s;e the enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of February.</NOTE> thought,
when they &s;aw the Scots hor&s;es led off the field, that the
whole army was retiring; and they ha&s;tened to attack
them. The Scots received them in good order; and be|ing
favoured by the advantage of the ground, as well as
by the &s;urprize of the Engli&s;h, who expected no re&s;i&s;t|ance,
they &s;oon put them to flight, and pur&s;ued them
with a con&s;iderable &s;laughter. Evers and Latoun were
both killed, and above a thou&s;and men were made pri|&s;oners.
In order to &s;upport the Scots in this war, Fran|cis,
&s;ome time $fter, &s;ent over a body of auxiliaries, to
the number of three thou&s;and five hundred men, under
<PB N="270" REF="294">
the command of Montgomery, lord of Lorges<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 15. Drummond.</NOTE>. Re|inforced
by the&s;e &s;uccours, the regent a&s;&s;embled an army
of fifteen thou&s;and men at Haddington, and marched
thence to ravage the ea&s;t borders of England. They
laid all wa&s;te wherever they came; and having met with
no con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance, they retired into their own
country, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves. The earl of Hert|ford,
in revenge, committed ravages on the middle and
we&s;t marches; and the war on both &s;ides was &s;ignalized
rather by the ills inflicted on the enemy, than by any
con&s;iderable advantage gained by either party.</P>
<P>THE war likewi&s;e between France and England was not
di&s;tingui&s;hed this year by any memorable events. Francis
had equipped a fleet of above two hundred &s;ail, be&s;ides
gallies; and having embarked &s;ome land forces on board,
he &s;ent them to make a de&s;cent in England<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Beleair. Memoires du Bellay.</NOTE>. They
&s;ailed to the I&s;le of Wight, where they found the Eng|li&s;h
fleet lying at anchor in St. Helens. It con&s;i&s;ted not
of above an hundred &s;ail; and the admiral thought it
mo&s;t advi&s;able to remain in that road, in hopes of draw|ing
the French into the narrow pa&s;&s;ages and rocks,
which were unknown to them. The two fleets canno|naded
one another for two days; and except the &s;inking
of the Mary Ro&s;e, one of the large&s;t &s;hips of the Engli&s;h
fleet, the damage on both &s;ides was incon&s;iderable. The
French landed troops in the I&s;le of Wight, and com|mitted
ravages; but being repul&s;ed by the militia of the
country, they retired to their &s;hips, which &s;oon after &s;et
&s;ail for France. They were again driven by the wind
on the coa&s;t of England, where they met with the Eng|li&s;h
fleet; and a new cannonading en&s;ued, which proved
no more deci&s;ive than the foregoing. It was indeed
<PB N="271" REF="295">
&s;carce po&s;&s;ible, that a fleet at that time could, without
boarding, gain any con&s;iderable advantage over the
enemy. The cannon were commonly &s;o ill &s;erved, that
a French writer of memoirs<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">De Langey.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, as a circum&s;tance
&s;omewhat &s;ingular, that each of the&s;e numerous fleets in
a two hours engagement, fired full three hundred &s;hot.
One &s;mall &s;hip in our time could, without difficulty, do
thrice as much.</P>
<P>FRANCIS's chief intention, in equipping &s;o great a
fleet, was to prevent the Engli&s;h from throwing &s;uccours
into Boulogne, which he intended to be&s;iege; and for
that purpo&s;e, he ordered a fort to be built, by which he
propo&s;ed to block up the harbour. After a con&s;iderable
lo&s;s of money and time, the fort was found &s;o ill con|&s;tructed,
that he was obliged to abandon it; and though
he had brought together, on that frontier, an army of
near forty thou&s;and men, he was not able to effect any
con&s;iderable enterprize. He broke into the territory of
Oye, an extent of country which lies near Calais, and
which &s;erved commonly to &s;upply the garri&s;on with pro|vi&s;ions;
and he laid it entirely wa&s;te by fire and &s;word.
Several &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued between the French and Eng|li&s;h,
in one of which the duke of Aumale received a
remarkable wound. A lance was run into his head
between his eye and no&s;e; and notwith&s;tanding that
the lance broke and the head of it remained in the
wound, he was not di&s;mounted by &s;o violent a &s;hock,
and the head of the lance being extracted by a &s;kilful &s;ur|geon,
he afterwards recovered, and rendered him&s;elf ex|tremely
famous by the name of the duke of Gui&s;e.
Henry, in order to defend his dominions in France, had
levied fourteen thou&s;and Germans; who, having march|ed
to Fleurines in the bi&s;hopric of Liege, found that
<PB N="272" REF="296">
they could advance no farther. The emperor would
not allow them a pa&s;&s;age through his dominions: They
received intelligence of a &s;uperior army on the &s;ide of
France ready to intercept them: Idlene&s;s and want of
pay &s;oon bred a mutiny among them: And having &s;eized
the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;aries as a &s;ecurity for arrears, they
retreated into their own country. There &s;eems to have
been &s;ome want of fore&s;ight and contrivance in this ex|pen&s;ive
armament.</P>
<P>THE great expence of the&s;e two wars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d No|vember. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> maintained by
Henry, obliged him to &s;ummon a new Parliament. The
commons granted him a &s;ub&s;idy, payable in two years,
of two &s;hillings a pound on land<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed goods or money, above five pound and below ten, were to pay eight pence a pound: Tho&s;e above ten pound, a &s;hilling.</NOTE>: The &s;pirituality
voted him &s;ix &s;hillings a pound. But the Parliament,
apprehen&s;ive left more demands &s;hould be made upon
them, thought to &s;ave them&s;elves by a very extraordinary
liberality of other people's property; and by one vote
they be&s;towed on the King all the revenues of the uni|ver&s;ities,
as well as of the chauntries, free chapels<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">A chauntry was a little church, chapel, or particular altar in &s;ome cathedral church, &amp;c. endowed with lands or other revenues for the maintenance of one or more prie&s;ts, daily to &s;ay ma&s;s or perform divine &s;ervice, for the u&s;e of the founders, or &s;uch others as they ap|pointed: Free chapels were independent on any church, and endowed for much the &s;ame purpo&s;e as the former.

ho&s;pitals. Henry was plea&s;ed with this conce&s;&s;ion, as it
encrea&s;ed his power; but he had no intention of de&s;poil|ing
learning of all her endowments; and he &s;oon took
care to inform the univer&s;ities, that he meant not to
touch their revenues. Thus the&s;e antient and celebrated
e&s;tabli&s;hments owed their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting to the genero&s;ity of
<PB N="273" REF="297">
the King, not to the protection of this &s;ervile and pro&s;ti|tute
Parliament.</P>
<P>THE pro&s;titute &s;pirit of the Parliament appeared far|ther
in the preamble of a &s;tatute<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">37 Hen. VIII. c. 17.</NOTE>; in which they re|cognize
the King to have always been by the word of
God &s;upreme head of the church of England, and ac|knowledge,
that archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, and other eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
per&s;ons, have no manner of juri&s;diction but by
his royal mandate: To him alone, &s;ay they, and &s;uch
per&s;ons as he &s;hall appoint, full authority and power is
given from above to hear and determine all manner
of cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and to correct all manner of
here&s;ies, errors, vices and &s;ins what&s;oever. No men|tion
is here made of the concurrence of a convocation,
nor even of a Parliament. His Proclamations are ac|knowledged
to have not only the force of a law, but the
authority of a revelation; and by his royal power he may
regulate the actions of men, and even direct their in|ward
&s;entiments and opinions.</P>
<P>THE King made in per&s;on a &s;peech to the Parliament
on proroguing them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th De|cember.</NOTE> where, after thanking them for
their loving attachment to him, which, he &s;aid, equalled
what was ever paid by their ance&s;tors to any King of
England, he complained of their diffen&s;ions, di&s;putes and
animo&s;ities in religion. He told them, that the &s;everal
pulpits were become a kind of batteries again&s;t each
other; and that one preacher called another heretic and
anabapti&s;t, which was retaliated by the opprobrious
terms of papi&s;t and hypocrite: That he had permitted
his people the u&s;e of the Scriptures, not in order to fur|ni&s;h
them materials for di&s;pute and railing, but that he
might enable them to inform their con&s;ciences and in|&s;truct
their children and families: That it grieved his
<PB N="274" REF="298">
heart to find how that precious jewel was pro&s;tituted, by
being introduced into the conver&s;ation of every alehou&s;e
and tavern, and employed as a pretence for decrying the
&s;piritual and legal pa&s;tors: And that he was &s;orry to ob|&s;erve,
that the word of God, while it was the object of
&s;o much anxious &s;peculation, had very little influence on
their practice; and that tho' an imaginary knowlege &s;o
much abounded, charity was daily going to decay<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 261. Herbert, p. 534.</NOTE>. The
King gave good advice; but his own example, by encou|raging
&s;peculation and di&s;pute, was ill qualified to pro|mote
that peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of opinion, which he
recommended.</P>
<P>HENRY employed in military preparations the money
granted by Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1546.</NOTE> and he &s;ent over the earl of
Hertford, and lord Li&s;le the admiral, to Calais with a
body of nine thou&s;and men, two thirds of which con|&s;i&s;ted
of foreigners. Some &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued of &s;mall
con&s;equence; and no hopes of any con&s;iderable progre&s;s
could be entertained by either &s;ide. Henry, who&s;e ani|mo&s;ity
again&s;t Francis was not violent, had given &s;uffi|cient
vent to his humour by this &s;hort war; and finding,
that from his great encrea&s;e in corpulence and decay in
&s;trength, he could not hope for much longer life, he
was de&s;irous of ending a quarrel, which might prove
dangerous to his kingdom during a minority. Francis
likewi&s;e, on his part, was not aver&s;e to peace with Eng|land;
becau&s;e, having lately lo&s;t his &s;on, the duke of
Orleans, he revived his antient claim upon Milan, and
fore&s;aw, that ho&s;tilities mu&s;t &s;oon, on that account, break
out between him and the Emperor. Commi&s;&s;ioners
therefore having met at Campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th June. Peace with France and Scotland.</NOTE> a place between Ardres
and Gui&s;nes, the articles were &s;oon agreed on, and the
peace &s;igned by them. The chief conditions were, that
<PB N="275" REF="299">
Henry &s;hould retain Boulogne during eight years, or till
the former debt due by Francis &s;hould be paid. This
debt was &s;ettled at two millions of livres, be&s;ides a claim
of 500,000 livres, which was afterwards to be adju&s;ted,
Francis took care to comprehend Scotland in the treaty.
Thus all that Henry obtained by a war, which co&s;t him
above one million three hundred and forty thou&s;and
pounds &s;terling<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe.</NOTE>, was a bad &s;ecurity for a debt, which
was not a third of the value.</P>
<P>THE King, being now freed from all foreign wars,
had lei&s;ure to give his attention to dome&s;tic affairs; and
particularly to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of uniformity of opinion,
on which he was &s;o intent. Tho' he allowed an Engli&s;h
tran&s;lation of the Bible, he had hitherto been very care|ful
to keep the ma&s;s in Latin; but he was at la&s;t prevailed
with to permit, that the Litany, a con&s;iderable part of
the public &s;ervice, &s;hould be celebrated in the vulgar
tongue; and by this innovation, he excited anew the
hopes of the reformers, who had been &s;omewhat di&s;cou|raged
by the &s;everity of the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles.
One petition of the new Litany was a prayer to &s;ave us
<HI>from the tyranny of the bi&s;hop of Rome, and from all his
dete&s;table enormities.</HI> Cranmer was employing his autho|rity
to engage Henry to farther innovations; and he took
advantage of Gardiner's ab&s;ence, who was &s;ent in an em|ba&s;&s;y
to the emperor; but Gardiner, having wrote to the
King, that, if he carried his oppo&s;ition again&s;t the catho|lic
religion to greater extremities, Charles threatened to
break off all commerce with him, the &s;ucce&s;s of Cran|mer's
projects was for that time retarded. Cranmer
lo&s;t this year the mo&s;t &s;incere and mo&s;t powerful friend,
whom he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at court; Charles Brandon, duke of
Suffolk: The Queen-dowager of France, &s;pou&s;e to
<PB N="276" REF="300">
Suffolk, had died &s;ome years before. This nobleman is one
in&s;tance, that Henry was not altogether incapable of a
cordial and &s;teady friend&s;hip; and Suffolk &s;eems to have
been entirely worthy of that favour, which, from his
earlie&s;t youth, he had enjoyed with him. The King
was &s;itting in council when informed of Suffolk's death;
and he took that occa&s;ion both to expre&s;s his own &s;orrow
for the lo&s;s, and to celebrate the merits of the decea&s;ed.
He declared, that, during the whole cour&s;e of their cor|re&s;pondence,
his brother-in-law had not made any attempt
to injure an adver&s;ary, and had never whi&s;pered a word
to the di&s;advantage of any one. &startq;Is there any of you,
my lords, who can &s;ay as much?&endq; When the King
&s;ubjoined the&s;e words, he looked round in all their faces,
and &s;aw that confu&s;ion, which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ecret
guilt naturally threw upon them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Coke's In&s;t. cap. 99.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CRANMER him&s;elf, when bereaved of this &s;upport,
was the more expo&s;ed to tho&s;e cabals of the courtiers,
which the oppo&s;ition of party and religion, joined to the
u&s;ual motives of intere&s;t, rendered &s;o frequent among
Henry's mini&s;ters and coun&s;ellors. The catholics took
hold of the King by his pa&s;&s;ion for orthodoxy; and they
repre&s;ented to him, that, if his laudable zeal for inforc|ing
the truth met with no greater &s;ucce&s;s, it was owing
altogether to the primate, who&s;e example and encou|ragement
were, in reality, the &s;ecret &s;upports of here&s;y.
Henry, &s;eeing the point to which they tended, &s;eigned a
compliance, and de&s;ired the council to make enquiry into
Cranmer's conduct; promi&s;ing that, if he was found
guilty, he would &s;end him to the Tower, and bring him
to condign puni&s;hment. All the world now gave the
primate for lo&s;t; and his old friends, from mercenary
views, as well as the oppo&s;ite party, from animo&s;ity, be|gan
<PB N="277" REF="301">
gan to &s;how him marks of neglect and di&s;regard. He
was obliged to &s;tand &s;everal hours among the lacqueys at
the door of the council-chamber, before he could be ad|mitted;
and when he was at la&s;t called in, he was told,
that they had determined to &s;end him to the Tower.
Cranmer &s;aid, that he appealed to the King him&s;elf;
and finding his appeal di&s;regarded, he produced a ring,
which Henry had given him as a pledge of favour and
protection. The council were confounded; and when
they came before the King, he reproved them, in the
&s;evere&s;t terms, and told them, that he was well acquainted
with Cranmer's merit, as well as with their malignity
and envy: But he was determined to cru&s;h all their ca|bals,
and to teach them, by the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline, &s;ince
gentle methods were in vain, a more dutiful concurrence
in promoting his &s;ervice. Norfolk, who was Cranmer's
capital enemy, apologized for their conduct, by &s;aying,
that their only intention was to &s;et the primate's inno|cence
in a full light by bringing him to an open trial:
And Henry obliged them all to embrace him, as a sign
of their cordial reconciliation. The mild temper of
Cranmer rendered this reconciliation more &s;incere on his
part, than is u&s;ual in &s;uch forced compliances<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burner, vol. i. p. 343, 344. Antiq. Brit. in vita Granm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUt tho' Henry's favour for Cranmer rendered fruitle&s;s
all accu&s;ations again&s;t him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Per&s;ecutions.</NOTE> his pride and peevi&s;hne&s;s,
irritated by his declining &s;tate of health, carried him to pu|ni&s;h
with fre&s;h &s;everity all others who pre&s;umed to enter|tain
a different opinion from him&s;elf, particularly in the ca|pital
point of the real pre&s;ence. Anne A&s;cue, a young
woman of merit as well as beauty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Bale, Speed, 780.</NOTE>, who had great con|nexions
with the chief ladies at court, and with the
Queen her&s;elf, was accu&s;ed of dogmatizing on that de|licate
<PB N="278" REF="302">
article; and Henry, in&s;tead of having indulgence
to the weakne&s;s of her &s;ex and age, was but the more
provoked, that a woman &s;hould dare to oppo&s;e his theo|logical
&s;entiments. She was prevailed on by Bonner's
menaces to make a &s;eeming recantation; but &s;he quail|fied
it with &s;ome re&s;erves, which did not &s;atisfy that
zealous prelate. She was thrown into pri&s;on, and there
employed her&s;elf in compo&s;ing prayers and di&s;cour&s;es,
by which &s;he fortified her re&s;olution to endure the utmo&s;t
extremity rather than relinqui&s;h her religious principles.
She even wrote to the King, and told him, that as to
the Lord's Supper, &s;he believed as much as Chri&s;t him|&s;elf
had &s;aid of it, and as much of his divine doctrine as
the catholic church had required: But while &s;he could
not be brought to acknowlege an a&s;&s;ent to the King's
explications, this declaration availed her nothing, and
was rather regarded as a fre&s;h in&s;ult. The chancellor,
Wriothe&s;ely, who had &s;ucceeded Audley, and who was
much attached to the catholic party, was &s;ent to examine
her with regard to her patrons at court, and the great
ladies who were in corre&s;pondence with her: But &s;he
maintained a very laudable fidelity to her friends, and
would confe&s;s nothing. She was put to the torture in
the mo&s;t cruel manner, and continued &s;till re&s;olute in
pre&s;erving &s;ecrecy. Some authors<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. 578. Speed, p. 780. Baker, p. 299. But Burnet que&s;tions the truth of this circum&s;tance: Fox, however, tran&s;cribes her own paper, where &s;he relates it. I mu&s;t add, in ju&s;tice to the king, that he di&s;approved of Wriothe&s;ely's conduct, and commended the lieutenant.</NOTE> add a very extraordi|nary
circum&s;tance: That the chancellor, who &s;tood by,
ordered the lieutenant of the Tower to &s;tretch the rack
farther; but the lieutenant refu&s;ed compliance with that
cruelty: The chancellor menaced him; but met with a
<PB N="279" REF="303">
new refu&s;al: Upon which that magi&s;trate, who was
otherwi&s;e a per&s;on of merit, but intoxicated with religi|ous
zeal, put his own hand to the rack, and drew it &s;o
violently that he almo&s;t tore her body a&s;under. Her
con&s;tancy &s;till &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the barbarity of her per&s;ecutors,
and they found all their efforts to be baff$ed. She was
then condemned to be burned alive; and being &s;o di&s;lo|cated
by the rack, that she could not &s;tand, &s;he was car|ried
to the &s;take in a chair. Together with her, were
brought Nicholas Belenian, a prie&s;t, John La&s;&s;els of the
King's family, and John Adams a taylor, who had been
condemned for the &s;ame crime to the &s;ame puni&s;hment.
They were all tied to the &s;take; and in that dreadful
&s;ituation, the chancellor &s;ent to inform them, that their
pardon was ready drawn and s;igned, and &s;hould in&s;tantly
be given them, if they would merit it by a recantation.
They only regarded this offer as a new ornament to their
crown of martyrdom; and they &s;aw with tranquillity the
executioner kindle the flames which con&s;umed them.
Wriothe&s;ely did not con&s;ider, that this public and noted
&s;ituation interested their honour the more to maintain a
&s;teady per&s;everance.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the &s;ecrecy and fidelity of Anne A&s;cue &s;aved
the Queen from this peril, &s;he &s;oon after fell into a new
danger, from which &s;he very narrowly e&s;caped. There
was an ulcer broke out in the King's leg, which, joined
to his extreme corpulency and his bad habit of body, be|gan,
both to threaten his life, and to render him, even
more than u&s;ual, peevi&s;h and pa&s;&s;ionate. The Queen,
during this time, attended him with the mo&s;t tender and
dutiful care, and endeavoured, by every foothing art and
compliance, to allay tho&s;e gu&s;ts of humour, to which he
was become &s;o &s;ubject. His favourite topic of conver&s;a|tion
was theology; and Catherine, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e
<PB N="280" REF="304">
made her capable of di&s;cour&s;ing on any &s;ubject, was fre|quently
engaged into the argument; and being &s;ecretly
inclined to the principles of the reformers, &s;he unwarily
di&s;covered too much of her mind on the&s;e occa&s;ions.
Henry, highly provoked that &s;he &s;hould pre&s;ume to differ
from him, made complaints of her ob&s;tinacy to Gardiner,
who gladly laid hold of the opportunity to inflame the
quarrel. He prai&s;ed the King's anxious care for pre|&s;erving
the orthodoxy of his &s;ubjects; and repre&s;ented,
that the more elevated the per&s;on was who was cha&s;ti&s;ed,
and the more near to his per&s;on, the greater terror
would the example &s;trike into every one, and the more
glorious would the &s;acrifice appear to all po&s;terity. The
chancellor, being con&s;ulted, was engaged by religious
zeal to &s;econd the&s;e topics; and Henry, hurried by his
own impetuous temper, and encouraged by his coun&s;el|lors,
went &s;o far as to order articles of impeachment to
be drawn up again&s;t his consort. Wriothe&s;ely executed
his commands; and &s;oon after brought the paper to him
to be &s;igned: For as it was high trea&s;on to throw &s;lander
upon the Queen, he might otherwi&s;e have been que&s;tioned
for his temerity. In going home, he chanced to drop
this important paper from his pocket; and as &s;ome per&s;on
of the Queen's party found it, it was immediately carried
to her. She was &s;en&s;ible of the extreme danger to which
&s;he was expo&s;ed; but did not de&s;pair of being able, by
her prudence and addre&s;s, &s;till to elude the efforts of her
enemies. She paid her u&s;ual vi&s;it to the King, and found
him in a more &s;erene di&s;po&s;ition than &s;he had rea&s;on to
expect. He entered on the &s;ubject which was &s;o familiar
to him, and he &s;eemed to challenge her to an argument
in divinity. She gently declined the conver&s;ation, and
ob&s;erved, that &s;uch profound &s;peculations were ill &s;uited
to the natural imbecillity of her &s;ex. Women, &s;he &s;aid,
<PB N="281" REF="305">
by their fir&s;t creation, were made &s;ubject to men: The
male was created after the image of God; the female
after the image of the male: It belonged to the hu&s;band
to choo&s;e principles for his wife; the wife's duty was, in
all ca&s;es, to adopt implicitly the &s;entiments of her hu&s;|band:
And as to her&s;elf, it was doubly her duty, being
ble&s;t with a hu&s;band, who was qualified, by his judgment
and learning, not only to choo&s;e principles for his own
family, but for the mo&s;t wife and knowing of every na|tion.
&startq;Not &s;o! by St. Mary,&endq; replied the King, &startq;you
are now become a doctor, Kate; and better fitted to
give than receive in&s;tructions.&endq; She meekly replied,
that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible how little &s;he was intitled to the&s;e
prai&s;es; that though &s;he u&s;ually declined not any con|ver&s;ation,
however &s;ublime, when propo&s;ed by his ma|je&s;ty,
&s;he well knew, that her conceptions could &s;erve to
no other purpo&s;e than to give him a little momentary
amu&s;ement; that &s;he found the conver&s;ation apt to lan|gui&s;h
when not revived by &s;ome oppo&s;ition, and had ven|tured
&s;ometimes to feign a contrariety of &s;entiments, in
order to give him the plea&s;ure of refuting her; and that
&s;he al&s;o propo&s;ed, by this innocent artifice, to engage
him into topics, whence, &s;he had ob&s;erved, by frequent
experience, that &s;he reaped profit and in&s;truction. &startq;And
is it &s;o, &s;weet-heart?&endq; replied the King, &startq;then we
are perfect friends again.&endq; He embraced her with
great affection, and &s;ent her away with a&s;&s;urances of his
protection and kindne&s;s. Her enemies, who knew no|thing
of this turn, prepared next day to convey her to
the Tower, pur&s;uant to the King's warrant. Henry and
Catherine were conver&s;ing amicably in the garden, when
the chancellor appeared with forty of the pur&s;uivants.
The King &s;poke to him at &s;ome di&s;tance from her; and
&s;eemed to expo&s;tulate with him in the &s;evere&s;t manner:
She even overheard the terms of <HI>knave, fool,</HI> and <HI>bea&s;t,</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="306">
which he very liberally be&s;towed upon that magi&s;trate;
and then ordered him to depart his pre&s;ence. She after|wards
interpo&s;ed to mitigate his anger: He &s;aid to her,
&startq;Poor &s;oul! you know not how little intitled this man
is to your good offices.&endq; From thenceforth, the
Queen, having narrowly e&s;caped &s;o great a danger, was
careful not to offend Henry's humour by any contradic|tion;
and Gardiner, who&s;e malice had endeavoured to
widen the breach, could never afterwards recover his fa|vour
and good opinion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 344. Herbert, p. 560. Speed, p. 780. Fox's Acts and Monuments, vol. ii. p. 58.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Henry's tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oured by ill health,
bur&s;t out &s;oon after to the de&s;truction of a man, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
a much &s;uperior rank to Gardiner. The duke
of Norfolk and his father, during this whole reign, and
even a great part of the foregoing, had been regarded as
the greate&s;t &s;ubjects in the kingdom, and had rendered
very con&s;iderable &s;ervices to the crown. The duke him|&s;elf
had in his youth di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by naval enter|prizes:
He had much contributed to the victory over the
Scots at Flouden: He had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a dangerous rebel|lion
in the North: And he had always done his part with
honour in all the expeditions, again&s;t France. Fortune
&s;eemed to con&s;pire with his own indu&s;try, in rai&s;ing him
to the highe&s;t elevation. By the favours heaped on him
from the crown, he had acquired an immen&s;e e&s;tate:
The king had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been married to two of his
nieces; and the King's &s;on, the duke of Richmond, had
married his daughter: Be&s;ides his de&s;cent from the antient
family of the Moubrays, by which he was allied to the
throne, he had e&s;pou&s;ed a daughter of the duke of
Buckingham, who was de&s;cended by a female from Ed|ward
the third: And as he was believed &s;till to adhere
<PB N="283" REF="307">
&s;ecretly to the antient religion, he was regarded, abroad
and at home, as the head of the catholic party. But all
the&s;e circum&s;tances, in proportion as they exalted the
duke, provoked the jealou&s;y of Henry; and he fore&s;aw
danger, during his &s;on's minority, both to the public
tranquillity, and to the new eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;y&s;tem, from
the attempts of so potent a &s;ubject. But nothing tended
more to expo&s;e Norfolk to the King's vengeance, than
the prejudices, which Henry had entertained again&s;t the
earl of Surrey, &s;on to that nobleman.</P>
<P>SURREY was a young man of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing
hopes, and had di&s;tingui&s;hed himself by every accom|pli&s;hment,
which became a &s;cholar, a courtier, and a
&s;oldier. He excelled in all the military exerci&s;es, which
were then in reque&s;t: He encouraged the fine arts by his
patronage and example: He had made &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful
attempts in poetry; and being &s;mit with the romantic
gallantry of that age, he celebrated the prai&s;es of his
mi&s;tre&s;s by his pen and his lance, in every ma&s;que and
tournament. His &s;pirit and ambition were equal to his
talents and his quality; and he did not always regulate
his conduct by that caution and re&s;erve, which his &s;itua|tion
required. He had been left governor of Boulogne,
when that town was taken by Henry; but though his
per&s;onal bravery was unque&s;tioned, he had been unfortu|nate
in &s;ome rencounters with the French, The King,
&s;ome what di&s;plea&s;ed with his conduct, had &s;ent over
Hertford to command in his place; and Surrey was &s;o
imprudent as to drop &s;ome menacing expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t
the mini&s;ters, on account of this affront, which was put
upon him. And as he had refu&s;ed to marry Hertford's
daughter, and even waved every propo&s;al of marriage,
which was made him; Henry imagined, that he had
entertained views of e&s;pou&s;ing the lady Mary; and he
<PB N="284" REF="308">
was in&s;tantly determined to repre&s;s, by the mo&s;t &s;evere
expedients, &s;o dangerous an ambition.</P>
<P>ACTUATED by all the&s;e motives, and perhaps too in|fluenced
by that old di&s;gu&s;t, with which the ill conduct
of Catherine Howard had in&s;pired him again&s;t all her
family, he gave private orders to arre&s;t Norfolk and
Surrey; and they were on the &s;ame day confined to the
Tower.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of December.</NOTE> Surrey being a commoner, his trial was the
more expeditious; and as to proofs, neither parliaments
nor juries &s;eem ever to have given the lea&s;t attention to
them in any cau&s;e of the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1547.</NOTE> during this whole reign.
He was accu&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the earl of Surrey.</NOTE> that he had entertained in his family
&s;ome Italians Who were <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> to be &s;pies; a &s;ervant
of his had paid a vi&s;it to cardinal Pole in Italy, whence
he was <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> of entertaining a corre&s;pondence with
that obnoxious prelate; he had quartered the arms of
Edward the Confe&s;&s;or on his &s;cutcheon, which, made
him be <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> of a&s;piring to the crown, tho' both he
and his ance&s;tors had openly, during the cour&s;e of many
years, maintained that practice; and the heralds had
even ju&s;tified it by their authority. The&s;e were the
crimes, for which a jury, notwith&s;tanding his eloquent
and &s;pirited defence, condemned this nobleman for high
trea&s;on; and their &s;entence was &s;oon after executed upon
him.</P>
<P>THE innocence of the duke of Norfolk was &s;till,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attainder of the duke of Norfolk.</NOTE>, if
po&s;&s;ible, more apparent than that of his &s;on; as his &s;er|vices
to the crown had been much greater. His dutche&s;s,
with whom he lived on bad terms, had been &s;o ba&s;e as
to carry intelligence to his enemies of all &s;he knew again&s;t
him: Elizabeth Holland, a mi&s;tre&s;s of his, had been
equally &s;ub&s;ervient to the des;igns of the court: Yet with
all the&s;e advantages his accu&s;ers di&s;covered no greater
crime, than that he had once &s;aid, that the King was
<PB N="285" REF="309">
&s;ickly, and could not hold out long, and the kingdom
was likely to fall into di&s;orders, thro' the diver&s;ity of re|ligious
opinions. He wrote a mo&s;t pathetic letter to the
King, pleading his pa&s;t &s;ervices, and prote&s;ting his in|nocence:
Soon after he embraced a more proper expe|dient
for appealing Henry, by making a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and
confe&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as his enemies required: But nothing
could mollify the unrelenting temper of the King. He
a&s;&s;embled the Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14 January.</NOTE> as the &s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t expe|ditious
in&s;trument of his tyranny; and the hou&s;e of
peers, without examining the pri&s;oner, without trial or
evidence, pa&s;&s;ed a bill of attainder again&s;t him, and &s;ent
it down to the commons. Cranmer, tho' engaged for
many years in an oppo&s;ite party to Norfolk, and tho' he
had received many and great injuries from him, would
have no hand in &s;o unju&s;t a pro&s;ecution, and he retired
to his &s;eat at Croydon<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. 348. Fox.</NOTE>. The King was now appoach|ing
fa&s;t towards his end; and fearing le&s;t Norfolk &s;hould
e&s;cape him, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, by which
he de&s;ired them to ha&s;ten the bill, on pretence, that
Norfolk, enjoyed the dignity of earl mar&s;hal, and it was
nece&s;&s;ary to appoint another, who might officiate at the
en&s;uing ceremony of in&s;talling his &s;on prince of Wales.
The ob&s;equious commons obeyed his directions, though
founded on &s;o frivolous a pretence; and the King, hav|ing
affixed the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bill by commi&s;&s;ioners,
i&s;&s;ued orders for the execution of Norfolk on the morning
of the twenty-ninth of January. But news being carried
to the Tower, that the King him&s;elf had expired that
night, the lieutenant deferred the execution of the war|rant,
and it was not thought advi&s;able by the council,
to begin a new reign by the death of the greate&s;t noble|man
in the kingdom, who had been condemned by a &s;en|tence
&s;o unju&s;t and tyrannical.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="310">
THE King's health had been long in a very declining
condition; but for &s;everal days all tho&s;e near him plainly
&s;aw his end approaching. He was become &s;o forward
that no one dur&s;t inform him of his condition; and as
&s;ome per&s;ons, during this reign, had undergone the pu|ni&s;hment
of traitors for foretelling the King's death<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Lanquet's Epitome of chronicles in the year 1541.</NOTE>,
every one was afraid, le&s;t, in the tran&s;ports of his fury,
he might, on this pretence, inflict death on the author
of &s;uch friendly intelligence. At la&s;t, Sir Anthony Denny
ventured to di&s;clo&s;e to him the fatal &s;ecret, and exhorted
him to prepare for the fate which was awaiting him.
He expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;ignation; and de&s;ired that Cranmer
might be &s;ent for: But before that prelate arrived, he
was &s;peechle&s;s, tho' he &s;till &s;eemed to retain his &s;en&s;es.
Cranmer de&s;ired him to give &s;ome &s;ign of his dying in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the King.</NOTE>
the faith of Chri&s;t: He &s;queezed his hand, and immedi|ately
expired, after a reign of thirty-&s;even years and nine
months; and in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his age.</P>
<P>THE King had made his will near a month before his de|cea&s;e;
where he confirmed the de&s;tination of Parliament
in leaving the crown fir&s;t to prince Edward, then to the
lady Mary, next to the lady Elizabeth: The two prin|ce&s;&s;es
he obliged, under the penalty of forfeiting their
title to the crown, not to marry without the con&s;ent of
the council, which he appointed for the government of
his minor &s;on. After his own children, he &s;ettled the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion on Frances Brandon, marchione&s;s of Dor&s;et
elde&s;t daughter to his &s;i&s;ter, the French Queen; then or
Eleonor, counte&s;s of Cumberland, the &s;econd daughter
in pa&s;&s;ing over the po&s;terity of the Queen of Scots, his
elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, he made u&s;e of the power obtained from
Parliament; but as he &s;ubjoined, that after the failure
of the French Queen's po&s;terity, the crown &s;hould de|&s;cend
<PB N="287" REF="311">
to the next lawful heir, it afterwards became a
que&s;tion, whether the&s;e words could be applied to the
Scotti&s;h line. It was thought, that the&s;e princes were
not the next heirs after the hou&s;e of Suffolk, but before
that hou&s;e, and that Henry, by expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in this
manner, meant entirely to exclude them. The late in|juries
which he had received from the Scots, had irritated
him extremely again&s;t that nation; and he maintained to
the la&s;t that character of violence and caprice, by which
his life had been &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed. Another cir|cum&s;tance
of his will may &s;ugge&s;t the &s;ame reflection with
regard to the &s;trange contrarieties of his temper and con|duct;
He left money for ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for delivering
his foul from purgatory; and tho' he de&s;troyed all tho&s;e
in&s;titutions, e&s;tabli&s;hed by his ance&s;tors and others, for
the benefit of <HI>their</HI> &s;ouls, and had even left the doctrine
of purgatory doubtful in all the articles of faith which he
publi&s;hed during his latter years, he was yet determined,
when matters came to the la&s;t, to take care, at lea&s;t,
of his own future repo&s;e, and to adhere to the &s;afer &s;ide
of the que&s;tion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See his will in Fuller, Heylin, and Rymer, p. 110. There is no to rea&s;onable ground to &s;u&s;pect its authenticity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to give a ju&s;t &s;ummary of this prince's
qualities:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His character.</NOTE> He was &s;o different from him&s;elf in different
parts of his reign, that, as is well remarked by lord
Herbert, his hi&s;tory is his be&s;t character and de&s;cription.
The ab&s;olute, uncontrouled authority which he main|tained
at home, and the regard which he acquired among
foreign nations, are circum&s;tances which entitle him to
the appellation of a <HI>great</HI> prince; while his tyranny, and
cruelty, &s;eem to exclude him from the character of a <HI>good</HI>
one. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, indeed, great vigour of mind, which
qualified him for exerci&s;ing dominion over men; courage,
<PB N="288" REF="312">
intrepidity, vigilance, inflexibility: And tho' the&s;e qua|lities
lay not always under the guidance of a regular and
&s;olid judgment, they were accompanied with good parts,
and an exten&s;ive capacity; and every one dreaded a con|te&s;t
with a man who was known never to yield, or to
forgive; and who, in every controver&s;y, was determined,
either to ruin him&s;elf or his antagoni&s;t. A catalogue of
his vices would comprehend many of the wor&s;t qualities
incident to human nature: Violence, cruelty, profu&s;ion,
rapacity, inju&s;tice, ob&s;tinacy, arrogance, bigotry, pre|&s;umption,
caprice: But neither was he &s;ubject to all the&s;e
vices in the mo&s;t extreme degree, nor was he, at inter|vals,
altogether devoid of virtues: He was &s;incere, open,
gallant, liberal, and capable at lea&s;t of a temporary friend|&s;hip
and attachment. In this re&s;pect he was unfortunate,
that the incidents of his times &s;erved to di&s;play his faults
in their full light: The treatment which he met with
from the court of Rome, provoked him to violence; the
danger of a revolt from his &s;uper&s;titious &s;ubjects, &s;eemed
to require the mo&s;t extreme &s;everity. But it mu&s;t, at the
&s;ame time, be acknowledged, that his &s;ituation tended to
throw an additional lu&s;tre on what was great and mag|nanimous
in his character; The emulation between the
emperor and the French King, rendered his alliance,
notwith&s;tanding his impolitic conduct, of great importance
in Europe: The exten&s;ive powers of his prerogative, and
the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, not to &s;ay &s;lavi&s;h, di&s;po&s;tion of his Par|liament,
made it the more ea&s;y for him to a&s;&s;ume and
maintain that entire dominion by which his reign is &s;o
much di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IT may &s;eem a little extraordinary, that notwith&s;tand|ing
cruelty, his extortion, his violence, his arbitrary
admini&s;tration, this prince not only acquired the regard
of his &s;ubjects; but never was the object of their hatred:
<PB N="289" REF="313">
He &s;eems even in &s;ome degree to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to the
la&s;t, their love and affection<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 389.</NOTE>. His exterior qualities
were advantageous, and fit to captivate the multitude:
His magnificence and per&s;onal bravery rendered him il|lu&s;trious
in vulgar eyes: And it may be &s;aid, with truth,
that the Engli&s;h in that age, were &s;o thoroughly &s;ubdued,
that, like ea&s;tern &s;laves, they were inclined to admire
even tho&s;e acts of violence and tyranny, which were
exerci&s;ed over them&s;elves, and at their own expence.</P>
<P>WITH regard to foreign &s;tates, Henry appears long to
have &s;upported an intercour&s;e of friend&s;hip with Francis,
more &s;incere and di&s;intere&s;ted than u&s;ually takes place
between neighbouring princes. Their common jealou&s;y
of the emperor Charles, and &s;ome re&s;emblance in their
characters, (tho' the compari&s;on is extremely to the ad|vantage
of the French monarch) &s;erved as the cement of
their mutual amity. Francis is &s;aid to have been affected
with the King's death, and to have expre&s;&s;ed much regret
for the lo&s;s. His own health began to decline: He fore|told,
that he &s;hould not long &s;urvive his friend<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Le Thou.</NOTE>: And
he died in about two months after him.</P>
<P>THERE were ten Parliaments &s;ummoned by Henry
the eighth, and twenty-three &s;e&s;&s;ions held. The whole
time in which the&s;e Parliaments &s;at during this long reign,
exceeded not three years and a half. It amounted not to
a year during the fir&s;t twenty years. The innovations in
religion obliged, him afterwards to call the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies
more frequently: But though the&s;e were the mo&s;t im|portant
tran&s;actions that ever fell under the cognizance
of Parliament, their devoted attachment to Henry's will,
joined to their earne&s;t de&s;ire of returning &s;oon to their
country &s;eats, produced a very quick di&s;patch of the bills,
and made the &s;e&s;&s;ions of &s;hort duration. All the King's
<PB N="290" REF="314">
caprices were, indeed, blindly complied with, and no
regard was payed to the &s;afety or liberty of the &s;ubject.
Be&s;ides the violent pro&s;ecution of whatever he was
plea&s;ed to call here&s;y, the laws of trea&s;on were multi|plied
beyond all former precedent. Even words to the
di&s;paragement of the King, Queen, or royal i&s;&s;ue, were
&s;ubjected to that penalty; and &s;o little care was taken in
framing the&s;e rigorous &s;tatutes, that they contain obvi|ous
contradictions; in&s;omuch, that, had they been &s;trict|ly
executed, every man, without exception, mu&s;t have
fallen under the penalty of trea&s;on. By one &s;tatute<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">28 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</NOTE>,
for in&s;tance, it was declared trea&s;on to a&s;&s;ert the validity
of the King's marriage, either with Catherine of Arra|gon,
or Anne Boleyn: By another<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">34, 35 Hen. VIII. c. i.</NOTE>, it was trea&s;on to
&s;ay any thing to the di&s;paragement or &s;lander of the prin|ce&s;&s;es,
Mary and Elizabeth; and to call them &s;purious
would, no doubt, be con&s;trued to their &s;lander. Nor
would even a profound &s;ilence with regard to the&s;e deli|cate
points, be able to &s;ave a per&s;on from &s;uch penalties.
For by the former &s;tatute, whoever refu&s;ed to an&s;wer
upon oath to any point contained in that act, was &s;ubject|ed
to the pains of trea&s;on. The King, therefore, needed
only to propo&s;e to any one a que&s;tion with regard to the
legality of either of his fir&s;t marriages: If the per&s;on
was &s;ilent, he was a traytor by law: If he an&s;wered,
either in the negative or in the affirmative, he was no
le&s;s a traytor. So mon&s;trous were the incon&s;i&s;tencies,
which aro&s;e from the furious pa&s;&s;ions of the King, and
the &s;lavi&s;h obedience of his Parliaments. It is hard to
&s;ay, whether the&s;e contradictions were owing to Henry's

<PB N="291" REF="315">
the genius of the age than &s;uch a review of the laws.
The abolition of the ancient religion contributed much
to the regular execution of ju&s;tice. While the catholic
&s;uper&s;tition &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of puni&s;hing
any crimes in the clergy: The church would not allow
the magi&s;trate to try the offences of her members, and
&s;he could not her&s;elf inflict any civil penalties upon
them. But Henry re&s;trained the&s;e pernicious exemp|tions:
The privilege of clergy was aboli&s;hed for the
crimes of petty trea&s;on, murder, and &s;elony, to all under
the degree of a &s;ubdeacon<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">23 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. But the former &s;uper&s;tition
not only protected crimes in the clergy: It exempted al|&s;o
the laity from puni&s;hment, by affording thenn &s;helter
in the churches and &s;anctuaries. The Parliament re|&s;trained
the&s;e abu&s;es. It was fir&s;t declared, that no
&s;anctuaries were allowed in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">26 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>; next,
in tho&s;e of murder, &s;elony, rapes, burglary, and petty
trea&s;on<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">32 Hen. VIII. c. 12.</NOTE>: And it limited them in other particulars<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>.
The only expedient employed to &s;upport the military
&s;pirit during this age, was the reviving and extending
&s;ome old laws, enacted for the encouragement of arch|ery,
on which the defence of the kingdom was &s;uppo&s;ed
very much to depend. Every man was ordered to have
a bow<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">3. Hen. VIII. C. 3.</NOTE>; Buts were ordered to be erected in every pa|ri&s;h<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>:
And every bowyer was ordered, for each bow of
yew which he made, to make two of elm or wich, for
the &s;ervice of the common people<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The u&s;e of cro&s;s|bows
and hand-guns was al&s;o prohibited<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. C. 13.</NOTE>. What ren|dered
the Engli&s;h bowmen more formidable was, that
they carried halberts with them, by which they were en|abled,
upon occa&s;ion, to engage in clo&s;e fight with the
<PB N="292" REF="316">
enemy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>. Frequent mu&s;ters or arrays were al&s;o made of
the people, even during time of peace; and all men of
&s;ub&s;tance were obliged to have a compleat &s;uit of armour
or harne&s;s, as it was called<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 234. Stowe, p. 515. Holling&s;hrf, p. 947.</NOTE>. The martial &s;pirit of
the Engli&s;h, during that age, rendered this precaution,
it was thought, &s;ufficient for the defence of the nation;
and as the King had then an ab&s;olute power of com|manding
the &s;ervice of all his &s;ubjects, he could pre&s;ent|ly,
in ca&s;e of danger, appoint new officers, and levy re|giments,
and collect an army as numerous as he plea&s;ed.
When no faction or divi&s;ion prevailed among the people,
there was no foreign power that ever dared to think of
invading England. There is a &s;aying of Francis the
fir&s;t, which &s;hews the e&s;timation in which the nation
was held in Europe. That magnanimous prince boa&s;ted,
that, notwith&s;tanding the combination of Charles and
Henry again&s;t him, in the year 1524, he &s;hould be able
to defend him&s;elf. Spain, &s;ays he, has no money; the
Low Countries have no &s;oldiers: And as to England, my
frontier is &s;trong on that &s;ide<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">P. Daniel.</NOTE>. The city of London
alone could mu&s;ter fifteen thou&s;and men<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 235. Holling&s;hed, p. 547. Stowe, p. 577.</NOTE>. Di&s;cipline,
however, was an advantage wanting to the&s;e troops; tho'
the garri&s;on of Calais was a nur&s;ery of officers; and
Tournay fir&s;t<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 68.</NOTE>, Boulogne afterwards, &s;erved to encrea&s;e
the number. Every one, who &s;erved abroad, was al|lowed
to alienate his lands without paying any fees<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">14 and 15 Hen, VIII. c. 15.</NOTE>. A
general permi&s;&s;ion was granted to di&s;po&s;e of land by will<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">34 and 35 Hen. VIII. C. 5.</NOTE>.
The Parliament were &s;o little jealous of their privileges,
(which indeed were, at that time, &s;carce worth pre|&s;erving)
that there is an in&s;tance of one Strode, who,
becau&s;e he introduced into the lower hou&s;e &s;ome bill re|garding
<PB N="293" REF="317">
tin, was very &s;everely treated by the Stannery
courts of Cornwal: Heavy fines were impo&s;ed on him; and
upon his refu&s;al to pay, he was thrown into a dungeon,
loaded with irons, and u&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as brought
his life in danger: Yet all the notice which the Parlia|ment
took of this enormity, even in &s;uch an inferior
court, was to enact, that no man could be que&s;tioned af|terwards
for his conduct in Parliament<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">4 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>. This prohibi|tion,
however, mu&s;t only be extended to the inferior
courts: For as to the King and privy council, and &s;tar|chamber,
they were &s;carce bound by any law. There is
a bill of tonnage and poundage, which &s;hews what un|certain
ideas the Parliament had formed both of their
own privileges and of the rights of the &s;overeign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">6 Hen. VIII. c. 14.</NOTE>. This
duty had been voted to every King &s;ince Henry the
fourth, during the term of his own life: Yet Henry
the eighth had already been allowed to levy it &s;ix years
without any law; and though there had been four Par|liaments
a&s;&s;embled, no attention had been given either to
grant it to him regularly, or retrain him from levying it.
At la&s;t, the Parliament re&s;olved to give him that &s;upply;
but even in this conce&s;&s;ion, they &s;how them&s;elves plainly
at a lo&s;s to determine whether they grant it, or whether
he has a right of him&s;elf to levy it. They &s;ay, that the
impo&s;ition was made to endure during the natural life of
the late King, and no longer: They yet blame the mer|chants
who had not paid to the pre&s;ent King that duty:
They ob&s;erve, that the law for tonnage and poundage
was expired; yet make no &s;cruple to call that impo&s;ition
the King's due: They affirm, that he had &s;u&s;tained great
and manifold lo&s;&s;es by tho&s;e who had defrauded him
of this duty: And to provide a remedy, they vote him
that &s;upply during his life, and no longer. It is re|markable,
<PB N="294" REF="318">
that notwith&s;tanding this la&s;t clau&s;e, all his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for more than a century, continued in the
like irregular practice: If a practice may de&s;erve that
epithet, which all the world acquie&s;ced in, and which
gave no offence. But when Charles the fir&s;t attempted
to continue in the &s;ame cour&s;e, which had now received
the &s;anction of many generations, &s;o much were the opi|nions
of men altered, that a furious tempe&s;t was excited
by it, and hi&s;torians, partial or ignorant, &s;till repre&s;ent
that mea&s;ure as a mo&s;t violent and unprecedented enor|mity
in that unhappy prince.</P>
<P>THE King was allowed to make laws for Wales,
without con&s;ent of Parliament<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">34 Hen. VIII.</NOTE>. With regard to Eng|land,
the re&s;traint was little more than a formality.</P>
<P>THE foreign commerce of England, during this age,
was mo&s;tly confined to the Netherlands. The inhabi|tants
of the Low Countries bought the Engli&s;h commo|dities,
and di&s;tributed them into the other parts of Eu|rope.
Hence the mutual dependance of the&s;e countries
on each other; and the great lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by both, in
ca&s;e of a rupture. During all the variations of politics,
the &s;overeigns u&s;ually avoided the coming to this extre|mity;
and though the King bore a much greater friend|ship
to Francis, the propen&s;ity of the nation always lay
towards the emperor.</P>
<P>IN 1528, ho&s;tilities commenced between England and
the Low Countries; but were &s;oon &s;topt by mutual
agreement. While the Flemings were not allowed to
purcha&s;e cloth in England, the Engli&s;h merchants could
not buy it of the clothiers, and the clothiers were obliged
to di&s;mi&s;s their workmen, who began to be tumultuous
for want of bread. The cardinal, to appea&s;e them, &s;ent
for the merchants, and ordered them to buy cloth as
<PB N="295" REF="319">
u&s;ual: They told him, that they could not di&s;po&s;e of it
as u&s;ual; and notwith&s;tanding all his menaces, he could
get no other an&s;wer from them<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">$x Hall, folio 174.</NOTE>. An agreement was
at la&s;t made to continue the commerce between the &s;tates,
even during war.</P>
<P>THE foreign artificers, in general, much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the
Engli&s;h in dexterity, indu&s;try, and frugality; and hence
the violent animo&s;ity, which the latter, on many occa|&s;ions,
expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t any of the former who were &s;et|tled
in England. They had the a&s;&s;urance to complain,
that all their cu&s;tomers went to foreign trade&s;men; and
in the year 1517, being moved by the &s;editious &s;ermons
of one doctor Bele, and the intrigues of Lincoln, a
broker, they rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection. The apprentices,
and others of the poorer &s;ort, in London, began by
breaking up the pri&s;ons, where &s;ome per&s;ons were con|fined
for in&s;ulting foreigners. They next proceeded to
the hou&s;e of Meutas, a Frenchman, much, hated by
them; where they committed great di&s;orders; killed &s;ome
of his &s;ervants, and plundered his goods. The mayor
could not appea&s;e them; nor Sir Thomas More, late
under &s;heriff, though extremely re&s;pected in the city.
They al&s;o threatened cardinal Wol&s;ey with &s;ome in&s;ult;
and he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to fortify his hou&s;e, and put
him&s;elf on his guard. Tired at la&s;t with the&s;e di&s;orders,
they di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves; and the earls of Shrew&s;bury
and Surrey &s;eized &s;ome of them. A proclamation was i&s;|&s;ued,
that women &s;hould not meet together to babble
and talk, and that all men &s;hould keep their wives in
their hou&s;es. Next day the duke of Norfolk came into
the city, at the head of thirteen hundred armed men,
and made enquiry into the tumult. Bele and Lincoln,
and &s;everal others, were &s;ent to the Tower, and con|demned
<PB N="296" REF="320">
for trea&s;on. Lincoln and thirteen more were
executed. The other criminals, to the number of four
hundred, were brought before the King, with ropes
about their necks, fell on their knees, and cried for mer|cy.
Henry knew at that time how to pardon; he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
them all without further puni&s;hment<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Stowe, 505. Holling&s;hed, 840.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So great was the number of foreign artizans in the
city, that at lea&s;t fifteen thou&s;and Flemings alone were
at one time obliged to leave it, by an order from the
council, when Henry became jealous of their favour for
Queen Catherine<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Le Grand, vol. iii. p. 232.</NOTE>. Henry him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es,
in an edict of the &s;tar-chamber, printed among the &s;tatutes, that the
foreigners &s;tarved the natives; and obliged them from
idlene&s;s to have recour&s;e to theft, murder, and other
enormities<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">21 Hen. VIII.</NOTE>. He al&s;o a&s;&s;erts, that the va&s;t multitudes of
the foreigners, rai&s;ed the price of grain and bread<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. And
to prevent the increa&s;e of the evil, all foreign artificers
were prohibited to have above two foreigners in their
hou&s;e, either journeymen or apprentices. A like jealou&s;y
aro&s;e again&s;t the foreign merchants; and to comply
with it, a law was enacted obliging all denizens to pay
the duties impo&s;ed upon aliens<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>. The Parliament had
done better to have encouraged foreign merchants and ar|tizans
to come over to England; which might have ex|cited
the emulation of the natives, and have improved
their &s;kill. The pri&s;oners in the kingdom, for debts and
crimes, are a&s;&s;erted in an act of parliament, to be &s;ixty
thou&s;and per&s;ons and above<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a remarkable clau&s;e in a &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed near
the beginning of this, reign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">3 Hen. VIII. c. 8.</NOTE>, by which we might be in|duced
to believe, that England was extremely decayed
<PB N="297" REF="321">
from the flouri&s;hing condition which it had attained in
former times. It had been enacted in the reign of Ed|ward
the &s;econd, that no magi&s;trate in town or borough,
who by his office ought to keep a&s;&s;ize, &s;hould, during
the continuance of his magi&s;tracy, &s;ell either in whole|&s;ale
or retail, any wine or victuals. This law &s;eemed
very equitable, in order to prevent fraud or private views
in fixing the a&s;&s;ize: Yet the law is repealed in this reign.
The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned is, that &startq;&s;ince the making of that
&s;tatute and ordinance, many and the mo&s;t part of all
the cities, boroughs, and towns corporate, within the
realm of England, are fallen in ruin and decay, and
are not inhabited by merchants, and men of &s;uch &s;ub|&s;tance
as at the time of making that &s;tatute: For at
this day, the dwellers and inhabitants of the &s;ame
cities and boroughs are commonly bakers, vintners,
fi&s;hmongers, and other victuallers, and there remain
few others to bear the offices.&endq; Men have &s;uch a
propen&s;ity to exalt pa&s;t times above the pre&s;ent, that it
&s;eems dangerous to credit this rea&s;oning of the Parlia|ment,
without further evidence to &s;upport it. So differ|ent
are the views in which the &s;ame object appears, that
&s;ome may be inclined to draw an oppo&s;ite inference from
this fact. A more regular police was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
reign of Henry the eighth than in any former period, and
a &s;tricter admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; an advantage which
induced the men of landed property to leave the provin|cial
towns, and to retire into the country. Cardinal
Wol&s;ey, in a &s;peech to the Parliament, repre&s;ented it as
a proof of the increa&s;e of riches, that the cu&s;toms had
increa&s;ed beyond what they were formerly<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hall,folio 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if there was really a decay of commerce and in|du&s;try,
and populou&s;ne&s;s in England, the &s;tatutes of this
<PB N="298" REF="322">
reign, except by aboli&s;hing mona&s;teries, and retrenching
holidays, a circum&s;tance of confiderable moment, were
not in otner re&s;pects well calculated to revive them. The
fixing the wages of artificers was attempted<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">6 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>: Luxury in
apparel was prohibited, by repeated &s;tatutes<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">1 Hen. VIII. c. 14. 6 Hen. VIII. c. 1. 7 Hen. VIII. c. 7.</NOTE>; and pro|bably
without &s;ucce&s;s. The chancellor and other mini|&s;ters
were empowered to fix the price of poultry, chee&s;e,
and butter<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 2.</NOTE>. A &s;tatute was even pa&s;&s;ed to fix the price
of beef, pork, mutton, and veal<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">24 Hen. VIII. c. 3.</NOTE>. Beef and pork were
ordered to be &s;old at a halfpenny a pound: Mutton and
veal at a halfpenny half a farthing. The preamble of the
&s;tatute &s;ays, that the&s;e four &s;pecies of butcher's meat
were the food of the poorer fort. This act was after|wards
repealed<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">33 Men. VIII c. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE practice of depopulating the country, by aban|doning
tillage, and throwing the lands into pa&s;turage,
&s;till continued<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 392.</NOTE>; as appears by the new laws which
were enacted again&s;t that practice. The King was
entitled to half the rents of the land, where any farm|hou&s;es
were allowed to go to decay<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">6 Hen. VIII. c. 5. 7 Hen. VIII. c. 1.</NOTE>. The un&s;kil|ful
hu&s;bandry was probably the cau&s;e why the pro|prietors
found no profit in tillage. The number of &s;heep
allowed to be kept in one flock, was re&s;trained to two
thou&s;and<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">25 Hen. VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. Sometimes, &s;ays the &s;tatute, one proprietor
or farmer would keep a flock of twenty-four thou&s;and.
It is remarkable, that the Parliament a&s;cribes the in|crea&s;ing
price of &s;heep and mutton, to this increa&s;e of
&s;heep; Becau&s;e, &s;ay they, the commodity being got into
few hands, the price of it is rai&s;ed at plea&s;ure<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. It is
probable, that the effect proceeded from the daily increa&s;e
<PB N="299" REF="323">
of money: For it is impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a commodity
could be monopolized. Intere&s;t was fixed during this
reign at ten per cent<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">37 Hen. VIII. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME laws were madewith regard to beggars and va|gabonds<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">22 Hen. VIII. c. 12. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 5.</NOTE>;
one of the circum&s;tances in government,
which humanity would mo&s;t powerfully recommend to a
benevolent legi&s;lator; which &s;eems, at fir&s;t &s;ight, the
mo&s;t ea&s;ily adju&s;ted; and which is yet the mo&s;t difficult
to &s;ettle in &s;uch a manner, as to attain the end without
de&s;troying indu&s;try. The convents formerly were a &s;up|port
to the poor; but at the &s;ame time tended to en|courage
idlene&s;s and beggary.</P>
<P>HENRY, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ome talents for let|ters,
was an encourager of them in others. He founded
Trinity college in Cambridge, and gave it very ample
endowments. Wol&s;ey founded Chri&s;t Church in Ox|ford,
and intended to call it Cardinal college: But upon
his fall, which happened before he had entirely fini&s;hed
his &s;cheme, the King &s;eized all the revenues; and this
violence, above all the other misfortunes of that great
mini&s;ter, is &s;aid to have given him the greate&s;t anxiety
and concern<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. i. p. 117.</NOTE>. But Henry afterwards re&s;tored the reve|nues
of the college, and only changed the name. The
cardinal founded in Oxford the fir&s;t chair for teaching
Greek; and this novelty rent that univer&s;ity into the
mo&s;t violent factions, which frequently came to blows.
The &s;tudents divided them&s;elves into parties, which bore
the names of Greeks and Trojans, and &s;ometimes fought
with as great animo&s;ity as was formerly exerci&s;ed by tho&s;e
ho&s;tile nations. A new and more correct method of
pronouncing Greek, being introduced into the univer|&s;ities,
it divided al&s;o the Grecians them&s;elves into par|ties;
<PB N="300" REF="324">
and it was remarked, that the catholics favoured
the former pronunciation, the prote&s;tants gave counte|nance
to the new. Gardiner employed the authority of
the King and council to &s;uppre&s;s innovations in this par|ticular,
and to pre&s;erve the old found to the Greek alpha|bet.
The ri&s;e of the Greek language in Oxford, excited
the emulation of Cambridge<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Wood's Hi&s;t. &amp; Antiq. Oxon. lib. i. p. 245.</NOTE>. Wol&s;ey intended to have
enriched the library of his college at Oxford, with co|pies
of all the manu&s;cripts that were in the Vatican<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid, 249.</NOTE>.
The countenance given to letters by this King and his
mini&s;ters, contributed to render learning fa&s;hionable in
England; and Era&s;mus &s;peaks with great &s;atisfaction of
the general regard paid by the nobility and gentry of that

that his mini&s;ters, who had always been &s;o ob&s;e|quious

was at pre&s;ent only a few months pa&s;t nine, he ap|pointed
<PB N="302" REF="326">
&s;ixteen executors; to whom, during the mi|nority,
he entru&s;ted the government of the King and
kingdom. Their names were, Cranmer, archbi&s;hop
of Canterbury; lord Wriothe&s;ely, chancellor; lord St.
John, great ma&s;ter; lord Ru&s;&s;el, privy &s;eal; the earl of

Sir Edward Montague, chief ju&s;tice of the common

Sir Edward Wotton, trea&s;urer of Calais; Dr. Wotton,
dean of Canterbury. To the&s;e &s;ixteen executors, with
whom was entru&s;ted the whole regal authority, were
added twelve coun&s;ellors, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no immediate
power, and could only a&s;&s;i&s;t with their advice, when any
affair was laid before them. The council was compo&s;ed

trea&s;urer of the hou&s;ehold; Sir John Gage, comptroller;

u&s;ual caprice of Henry appears &s;omewhat in this no|mination;
while he appointed &s;everal per&s;ons of inferior
&s;tation among his executors, and gave only the place

of Arundel, and to Sir Thomas Seymour, the King's

<P>BUT the fir&s;t act of the executors and coun&s;ellors was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovations in the regency.</NOTE>
to depart from the de&s;tination of the late King in a ma|terial
article. No &s;ooner were they met, than it was
<PB N="303" REF="327">
&s;ugge&s;ted, that the government would lo&s;e its dignity,
for want of &s;ome head, who might repre&s;ent the royal
maje&s;ty, who might receive addre&s;&s;es from foreign am|ba&s;&s;adors,
to whom di&s;patches from Engli&s;h mini&s;ters
abroad might be carried, and whole name might be em|ployed
in all orders and proclamations: And as the
King's will &s;eemed to labour under a defect in this parti|cular,
it was concluded nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply it, by choo&s;|ing
a protector; who, though he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s all the
exterior &s;ymbols of royal dignity, &s;hould yet be bound,
in every exerci&s;e of power, to follow the opinion of the
executors<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burner, vol. ii. P. 5.</NOTE>. This propo&s;al was very di&s;agreeable to
chancellor Wriothe&s;ely. That magi&s;trate, a man of an
active &s;pirit and high ambition, found him&s;elf, by his of|fice,
entitled to the fir&s;t: rank in the regency after the
primate; and as he knew, that that prelate had no talent
nor inclination for &s;tate affairs, he hoped, that the di|rection
of public bu&s;ine&s;s would of cour&s;e devolve in a
great mea&s;ure upon him&s;elf. He oppo&s;ed, therefore, this
propo&s;al of choo&s;ing a protector; and repre&s;ented that in|novation
as an infringement of the King's will, which,
being corroborated by act of Parliament, ought in every
thing to be a law to them, and could not be altered but
by the &s;ame authority, which had e&s;tabli&s;hed it. The
executors and coun&s;ellors were mo&s;tly courtiers, who had
been rai&s;ed by Henry's favour, not men of high birth or
great dependances; and as they had been &s;ufficiently ac|cu&s;tomed
to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion during the reign of the late mo|narch,
and had no preten&s;ions to govern the nation by
their own authority, they acquie&s;ced the more willingly
in a propo&s;al, which &s;eemed calculated for pre&s;erving
public peace and tranquillity. It being therefore agreed
to name a protector, the choice fell of cour&s;e on the earl
<PB N="304" REF="328">
of Hertford, who, as he was the King's maternal uncle,
was &s;trongly intere&s;ted in his &s;afety; and having no
claims to inherit the crown, could never have any &s;epa|rate
to intere&s;t; which might engage him to endanger Ed|ward's
per&s;on or his authority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heylin, Hi&s;t. Ref. Edw. VI.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somer&s;et protector.</NOTE> The public were in|formed
by proclamation of this change in the admini&s;tra|tion;
and di&s;patches were &s;ent to all foreign courts to
give them intimation of it. All tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any
office res;igned their former commi&s;&s;ions, and took out
new ones in the name of the young King. The bi&s;hops
them&s;elves were con&s;trained to make a like &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.
Care was taken to in&s;ert in their new commi&s;&s;ions, that
they held their office during plea&s;ure<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 218. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 6. Strype's Mem. of Cranm. p. 141.</NOTE>: And it is there

as well eccle&s;ia&s;tical as civil, is originally de|rived
from the crown<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Strype's Mem. of Cranm. p. 141.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE executors &s;howed, in their next mea&s;ure, a more
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference to Henry's will; becau&s;e many of
them found their own account in it. The late King had
intended, before his death, to make a new creation of
nobility, in order to &s;upply the place of tho&s;e who had
fallen by former attainders, or the failure of i&s;&s;ue; and
that he might enable the per&s;ons to &s;upport their new
dignity, he had re&s;olved either to be&s;tow e&s;tates on them,
or advance them to higher offices. He had even gone &s;o
far as to inform them of this re&s;olutlon; and in his will,
he charged his executors to make good all his promi&s;es<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fuller, Heylin, and Rymer.</NOTE>.
That they might a&s;certain his intentions in the mo&s;t au|thentic
manner, Sir William Paget, Sir Anthony Denny,
and Sir William Herbert, with whom Henry had always
conver&s;ed in a familiar manner, were called before the
<PB N="305" REF="329">
board of regency; and having given evidence of what
they knew concerning the King's promi&s;es, their te&s;ti|mony
was relied on, and the executors proceeded to the
fulfilling the&s;e engagements. Hartford was created duke
of Somer&s;et,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of February.</NOTE> mar&s;chal and lord trea&s;urer; Wriothe&s;ely,
earl of Southampton; the earl of E&s;&s;ex, marque&s;s of
Northampton; vi&s;count Li&s;le, earl of Warwick; Sir
Thomas Seymour, lord Seymour of Sudley, and admiral:
Sir Richard Rich, Sir William Willoughby, Sir Edward
Sheffield, accepted the title of baron<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe's Annals, p. 594.</NOTE>. Several, to
whom the &s;ame dignity was offered, refu&s;ed it; becau&s;e
the other part of the King's promi&s;e, the be&s;towing
e&s;tates on the&s;e new noblemen, was deferred till a more
convenient opportunity. Some of them, however, par|ticularly
Somer&s;et the protector, were, in the mean time,
endowed with &s;piritual preferments, deaneries and pre|bends.
For among many other inva&s;ions of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
privileges and properties, this irregular practice, of
be&s;towing &s;piritual benefices on laymen, began now to
prevail.</P>
<P>THE earl of Southampton had always been engaged in
an oppo&s;ite party to Somer&s;et; and it was not likely that
factions, which had &s;ecretly prevailed, even during the
arbitrary reign of Henry, &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the
weak admini&s;tration, which u&s;ually attends a minority.
The former nobleman, that he might have the greater
lei&s;ure for attending to &s;tate-affairs, had, of him&s;elf and
from his own authority, put the great &s;eal in commi&s;&s;ion,
and had empowered four lawyers, Southwel, Tregonel,
Oliver, and Bella&s;is, to execute in his ab&s;ence the office
of chancellor. This mea&s;ure &s;eems very exceptionable;
and the more &s;o, as two of the commi&s;&s;ioners being ca|noni&s;ts,
<PB N="306" REF="330">
the lawyers &s;u&s;pected, that, by this nomination,
the chancellor had intended to di&s;credit the common law,
Complaints were made to the council; who, influenced
by the protector, gladly laid hold of this opportunity to
depre&s;s Southampton. They con&s;ulted the judges with
regard, to &s;o unu&s;ual a ca&s;e, and received for an&s;wer, that
the commi&s;&s;ion was illegal, and that the chancellor, by
his pre&s;umption in granting it, had ju&s;tly forfeited the
&s;eals, and was even liable to puni&s;hment. The council
&s;ummoned him to appear before them; and though he
maintained, that he held his office by the late King's
will, founded on an act of Parliament, and could not lo&s;e
it without a trial before the Parliament; that if the com|mi&s;&s;ion,
which he had granted, was found illegal, it
might be declared null and void, and all the ill con&s;e|quences
of it be ea&s;ily remedied; and that the depriving
him of the &s;eals for an error of this nature, was a prece|dent
by which any other innovation might be authorized;
the council, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e topics of defence,
declared that he had forfeited his office; that a fine
&s;hould be impo&s;ed upon him; and that he &s;hould be con|fined
to his own hou&s;e during plea&s;ure<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 979.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH the removal of Southampton encrea&s;ed the
protector's authority, as well as tended to &s;uppre&s;s fac|tions
in the regency; yet was not Somer&s;et contented
with this advantage: His ambition carried him to &s;eek
&s;till farther acqui&s;itions. On pretence, that the vote of
the executors, choo&s;ing him protector, was not a &s;uffi|cient
foundation for his authority, he procured a patent
from the young King, by which he entirely overturned
the will of Harry the eighth, produced a total revolution
in the government, and may &s;eem even to have &s;ubverted
<PB N="307" REF="331">
all the laws of the kingdom. He named him&s;elf pro|tector
with full regal power, and appointed a council,
con&s;i&s;ting of all the former coun&s;ellors, and all the exe|cutors
except Southampton: He re&s;erved a power of
naming any other coun&s;ellors at plea&s;ure: And he was
bound to con&s;ult with &s;uch only as he thought proper.
The protector and his council were likewi&s;e empowered
to act at di&s;cretion, and to execute whatever they
thought &s;erviceable to the government, without incurring
any penalty or forfeiture from any law, &s;tatute, procla|mation,
or ordinance whatsoever<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Records, N$ 6.</NOTE>. Even had this pa|tent
been le&s;s exorbitant in its conce&s;&s;ions, and had it
been drawn by directions from the executors appointed
by Henry, its legality might ju&s;tly be que&s;tioned; &s;ince
it &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to a tru&s;t of this nature to be exerci&s;ed
by the per&s;ons entru&s;ted, and not to admit of a delega|tion
to others: But as the patent, by its very tenor,
where the executors are not &s;o much as mentioned, ap|pears
to have been &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained from a minor
King, the protector&s;hip of Somer&s;et was a plain u&s;urpa|tion,
which it is impo&s;&s;ible by any arguments to ju&s;tify.
The connivance, however, of the executors, and their
pre&s;ent acquie&s;cence in the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, made it be
univer&s;ally &s;ubmitted to; and as the young King di&s;co|vered
an extreme attachment to his uncle, who was al&s;o
in the main a man of moderation and probity, no ob|jections
were made to his power and title. All men of
&s;en&s;e, likewi&s;e, who &s;aw the nation divided by the reli|gious
zeal of the oppo&s;ite &s;ects, thought it the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to entru&s;t the government to one per&s;on, who
might check the exorbitances of party, and en&s;ure the
public tranquillity. And though &s;ome clau&s;es of the pa|tent
&s;eemed to imply a formal &s;ubver&s;ion of all liberty or
<PB N="308" REF="332">
limited government, &s;o little jealou&s;y was then u&s;ually
entertained on that head, that no exception was ever
taken at bare claims or preten&s;ions of this nature,
advanced by any per&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;overeign power.
The actual exerci&s;e alone of arbitrary admini&s;tration, and
that in many and great and flagrant and unpopular in|&s;tances,
was able &s;ometimes to give &s;ome umbrage to
the nation.</P>
<P>THE exten&s;ive authority and imperious character of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reformation completed.</NOTE>
Henry, had retained the partizans of both religions in
&s;ubjection; but upon his decease, the hopes of the pro|te&s;tants
and the fears of the catholics began to revive,
and the zeal of the&s;e parties produced every where di&s;|putes
and animo&s;ities, the u&s;ual preludes of more fatal
divi&s;ions. The protector had long been regarded as the
&s;ecret partizan of the reformers; and being now freed
from re&s;traint, he &s;crupled not to expre&s;s his intention
of correcting all the abu&s;es of the ancient religion, and
of adopting &s;till more of the prote&s;tant innovations. He
took, care, that all the per&s;ons, to whom he entru&s;ted the
King's education, &s;hould be attached to the &s;ame prin|ciples;
and as the young Prince di&s;covered a zeal for
every kind of literature, e&s;pecially the theological, far be|yond
his tender years, all men fore&s;aw, in the cour&s;e of
his reign, the total abolition of the catholic faith; and
they early began to declare them&s;elves in favour of tho&s;e
tenets, which were likely to become in the end entirely
prevalent. After Southampton's fall, few members of
the council &s;eemed to retain any attachment to the Ro|mi&s;h
communion; and mo&s;t of the coun&s;ellors appeared
even &s;anguine in forwarding the progre&s;s of the reforma|tion.
The riches which mo&s;t of them had acquired from
the &s;poils of the clergy, induced them to widen the
breach between England and Rome; and by e&s;tabli&s;hing
a contrariety of &s;peculative tenets, as well as of di&s;ci|pline
<PB N="309" REF="333">
and wor&s;hip, to render a coalition with the mother
church altogether impracticable<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Goodwin's Annals, Heylin.</NOTE>. Their rapacity al&s;o,
the chief &s;ource of their reforming &s;pirit, was excited by
the pro&s;pect of pillaging the &s;ecular, as they had already
done the regular clergy; and they knew, that, while
any &s;hare of the old principles remained, or any regard
to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, they never could hope to &s;ucceed in
their preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE numerous and burthen&s;ome &s;uper&s;titions, with
which the Romi&s;h church was loaded, had thrown many
of the reformers, by the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, into an en|thu&s;ia&s;tic
&s;train of devotion; and all rites, ceremonies,
pomp, order, and exterior ob&s;ervances were zealou&s;ly
aboli&s;hed by them, as hindrances of their &s;piritual con|templations,
and ob&s;tructions to their immediate conver&s;e
with heaven. Many circum&s;tances concurred to enflame
this daring &s;pirit; the novelty it&s;elf of their doctrines,
the triumph of making pro&s;elytes, the furious per&s;ecu|tions
to which they were, expo&s;ed, their animo&s;ity again&s;t
the antient tenets and practices, and the nece&s;&s;ity of pro|curing
the concurrence of the laity, by depre&s;&s;ing the
hierarchy, and by tendering to them the plunder of the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics. Wherever the reformation prevailed over
the oppo&s;ition of civil authority, this genius of religion
appeared in its full extent, and was attended with con|&s;equences,
which, though le&s;s durable, were, for &s;ome
time, no le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e which were connected
with the ancient &s;uper&s;tition. But as the magi&s;trate took
the lead in England, the tran&s;ition was more gradual;
much of the antient religion was &s;till preserved; and a
rea&s;onable degree of &s;ubordination was retained in di&s;ci|pline,
as well as &s;ome pomp, order, and ceremony in
public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="334">
THE protector, in his &s;chemes for advancing the re|formation,
had always recour&s;e to the councils of Cran|mer,
who, being a man of moderation and prudence,
was aver&s;e to all violent changes, and determined to
bring over the people, by in&s;en&s;ible innovations, to that
&s;y&s;tem of doctrine and di&s;cipline, which he deemed the
mo&s;t pure and perfect. He probably al&s;o fore&s;aw, that a
&s;y&s;tem, which carefully avoided the extremes of reforma|tion,
was likely to be mo&s;t la&s;ting; and that a devotion,
merely &s;piritual, was fitted only for the fir&s;t fervours of a
new &s;ect, and upon the relaxation of the&s;e naturally gave
place to the inroads of &s;uper&s;tition. He &s;eems therefore
to have intended the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a hierarchy, which,
being &s;uited to a great and &s;ettled government, might
&s;tand as a perpetual barrier again&s;t Rome, and might re|tain
the reverence of the people, even after their enthu&s;i|a&s;tic
zeal was dimini&s;hed or entirely evaporated.</P>
<P>THE per&s;on, who oppo&s;ed, with greate&s;t authority,
any farther advances towards reformation, was Gardiner,
bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; who, tho' he had not obtained
a place in the council of regency, on account of &s;ome,
late di&s;gu&s;ts, which he had given to Henry, was entitled,
by his age, experience, and capacity, to the highe&s;t tru&s;t
and confidence of his party.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardiner's oppo&s;ition.</NOTE> This prelate continued &s;till
to magnify the great wi&s;dom and learning of the late
King, which were generally and &s;incerely admired by the
nation; and he in&s;i&s;ted on the prudence of per&s;evering,
at lea&s;t till the young King's majority, in the eccle&s;ia&s;|tical
model, e&s;tabli&s;hed by that great monarch. He de|fended
the u&s;e of images, which were now very openly
attacked by the prote&s;tants; and he repre&s;ented them as
&s;erviceable in maintaining a &s;en&s;e of religion among the
illiterate multitude<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. P. 742.</NOTE>. He even deigned to write an apo|logy
for <HI>holy water,</HI> which bi&s;hop Ridley had decried in a
<PB N="311" REF="335">
&s;ermon; and he maintained, that, by the power of the
Almighty, it might be rendered an in&s;trument of doing
good; as much as the &s;hadow of St. Peter, the hem of
our Saviour's garment, or the &s;pittle and clay laid upon
the eyes of the blind<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. p. 724.</NOTE>. Above all, he in&s;i&s;ted, that the
laws ought to be ob&s;erved, that the con&s;titution ought to
be pre&s;erved inviolate, and that it was dangerous to fol|low
the will of the &s;overeign, in oppo&s;ition to an act of
parliament<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 228. Fox, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' there remained at that time in England an
idea of laws and a con&s;titution, &s;ufficient at lea&s;t to fur|ni&s;h
a topic of argument to, &s;uch as were di&s;contented
with the pre&s;ent exerci&s;e of authority; this plea could
&s;carcely, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, be maintained with any
plau&s;ibility by Gardiner. An act of parliament had in|ve&s;ted
the crown with a legi&s;lative power; and royal
proclamations, even during a minority, were armed with
the force and authority of laws. The protector, finding
him&s;elf &s;upported by this &s;tatute, was determined to em|ploy
his influence in favour of the reformers; and hav|ing
&s;u&s;pended, during the interval, the authority of the
bi&s;hops, he appointed a general vi&s;itation to be made in
all the dioce&s;es of England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cranm. p. 146, 147, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The vi&s;itors con&s;i&s;ted of a
mixture of clergy and laity, and had &s;ix circuits a&s;s;igned
them. The chief purpo&s;e of their in&s;tructions was, be|&s;ides
correcting immoralities and irregularities in the cler|gy,
to aboli&s;h the antient &s;uper&s;titions, and to bring the
di&s;cipline and wor&s;hip &s;omewhat nearer the practice of
the reformed churches. The moderation of Somer&s;et and
Cranmer is apparent in the conduit of this delicate af|fair.
The vi&s;itors were enjoined to retain for the pre|&s;ent
all images which had not been abu&s;ed to idolatry;
<PB N="312" REF="336">
and to in&s;truct the people not to de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch ceremonies
as were not yet abrogated, but only to beware, of &s;ome
particular &s;uper&s;titions, &s;uch as the &s;prinkling their beds
with holy water, the ringing of bells, or u&s;ing of ble&s;&s;ed
candles, in order to drive away the devil<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. P. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT nothing required more the correcting hand of au|thority,
than the abu&s;e of preaching, which was now
generally employed, throughout England, in defending
the antient practices and &s;uper&s;titions. The court of
augmentations, in order to ea&s;e the King of the annui|ties
paid to monks, had commonly placed them in the
vacant churches; and the&s;e men were led by intere&s;t, as
well as inclination, to &s;upport tho&s;e principles, which
had been invented for the profit of the clergy. Orders
therefore were given to re&s;train the topics of their &s;er|mons:
Twelve homilies were publi&s;hed, which they
were enjoined to read to the people: And all of them
were prohibited, without expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion, to preach
any where but in their pari&s;h churches. The des;ign of
this injunction was to throw a re&s;traint on the catholic
divines; while the prote&s;tant, by the grant of particular
licences, &s;hould be allowed unbounded liberty.</P>
<P>BONNER made &s;ome oppo&s;ition to the&s;e mea&s;ures; but
&s;oon after retracted and acquie&s;ced. Gardiner was more
high-&s;pirited and more &s;teady. He repre&s;ented the peril
of perpetual innovations, and the nece&s;&s;ity of adhering
to &s;ome &s;y&s;tem. &startq;'Tis a dangerous thing,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;to u&s;e too much freedom, in re&s;earches of this kind.
If you cut the old canal, the water is apt to run fur|ther
than you have a mind to. If you indulge the
humour of novelty, you cannot put a &s;top to people's
demands, nor govern their indi&s;cretions at plea&s;ure.
For my part,&endq; &s;aid he, on another occa&s;ion, &startq;my
<PB N="313" REF="337">
&s;ole concern is to manage the third and la&s;t act of my
life with decency, and to make a hand&s;ome exit off the
&s;tage. Provided this point is &s;ecured, I am not &s;olicit|ous
about the re&s;t. I am already by nature condemned
to death; No man can give me a pardon from this &s;en|tence;
nor &s;o much as procure me a reprieve. To
&s;peak my mind, and to act as my con&s;cience directs,
are two branches of liberty, which I can never part
with. Sincerity in &s;peech, and integrity in action, are
entertaining qualities: They will &s;tick by a man,
when every thing el&s;e takes its leave; and I mu&s;t not
re&s;ign them upon any con&s;ideration. The be&s;t on it is,
if I do not throw them away my&s;elf, no man can force
them from me: But if I give them up, then am
I ruined by my&s;elf, and de&s;erve to lo&s;e all my prefer|ments<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">$ol$ier, vol. ii. p. 228. ex MS. Col. C. C. Cantab. Bibliothica Brittanica, article GARDINER.</NOTE>.&endq;
This oppo&s;ition of Gardiner drew on him
the indignation of the council; and he was &s;ent to the
Fleet, where he was u&s;ed with &s;ome har&s;hne&s;s and
&s;everity.</P>
<P>ONE of the chief objections, urged by Gardiner again&s;t
the new homilies, was that they defined with the mo&s;t
metaphysical preci&s;ion the doctrine of grace, and of ju&s;|tification
by faith; points, he thought, which it was
&s;uperfluous for any man to know exactly, and which
certainly much exceeded the comprehen&s;ion of the vul|gar.
A famous martyrologi&s;t calls Gardiner, on account
of this opinion, &startq;An in&s;en&s;ible a&s;s, and one that had no
feeling of God's &s;pirit in the matter of ju&s;tification<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii.</NOTE>.&endq;
The meane&s;t prote&s;tant imagined at that time, that he
had a full comprehen&s;ion of all tho&s;e my&s;terious doctrines,
and he heartily de&s;pi&s;ed the mo&s;t learned and knowing
per&s;on of the antient religion, who acknowleged his
ignorance with regard to them. It is indeed certain,
<PB N="314" REF="338">
that the reformers were very fortunate in their doctrine
of ju&s;tification, and might venture to expect its &s;ucce&s;s
in oppo&s;ition to all the ceremonies, &s;hows, and &s;uper&s;ti|tions
of popery. By exalting Chri&s;t and his &s;ufferings,
and renouncing all claim to independent merit in our|&s;elves,
it was calculated to become popular, and coincided
with tho&s;e principles of panegyric and of &s;elf-aba&s;ement,
which generally have place in religion.</P>
<P>TONSTAI, bi&s;hop of Durham, having, as well as
Gardiner, made &s;ome oppo&s;ition to the new regulations,
was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the council-board; but no farther &s;everity
was, for the pre&s;ent, exerci&s;ed again&s;t him. He was a
man of perfect moderation, and of the mo&s;t unexception|able
character in the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame religious zeal which engaged Somer&s;et to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign affairs.</NOTE>
promote the reformation at home, led him to carry his
attention to foreign countries; where the intere&s;ts of the
prote&s;tants were now expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent dan|ger.
The Roman pontiff, with much reluctance and
after long delays, had at la&s;t &s;ummoned a general council,
which was a&s;&s;embled at Trent, and was employed in
correcting the abu&s;es of the church, and in a&s;certaining
her doctrines. The emperor, who de&s;ired to repre&s;s the
power of the court of Rome, as well as gain over the
prote&s;tants, promoted the former object of the council;
the pope, who found his own greatne&s;s &s;o deeply intere&s;ted,
de&s;ired rather to employ them in the latter. He gave in|&s;tructions
to his legates, who pre&s;ided in the council, to
protract the debates, and to engage the theologians in al|tercation,
and arguments, and di&s;putes concerning the
nice points of faith, canva&s;&s;ed before them: A policy,
which was &s;o ea&s;y to be executed, that the legates found
if rather nece&s;&s;ary to interpo&s;e, in order to appea&s;e the
animo&s;ity of the divines, and bring them at la&s;t to &s;ome
deci&s;ion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 2.</NOTE>. The more difficult ta&s;k for the legates
<PB N="315" REF="339">
was to moderate or divert the zeal of the council for
reformation, and to repre&s;s the ambition of the prelates,
who de&s;ired to exalt the epi&s;copal authority on the ruins
of the &s;overeign pontiff. Finding this humour become
intractable, the legates, on pretence that the plague had
broke out at Trent, transferred of a &s;udden the council
to Bologna, where, they hoped, it would be more under
the direction of his holine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE emperor, no le&s;s than the pope, had learned to
make religion &s;ub&s;ervient to his ambition and policy.
He was re&s;olved to employ the imputation of here&s;y as a
pretence for &s;ubduing the prote&s;tant princes, and oppre&s;|&s;ing
the liberties of Germany; but found it requi&s;ite to
cover his intentions under a deep artifice, and to prevent
the combination of his adversaries. He &s;eparated the
Palatine and the elector of Brandenburgh from the pro|te&s;tant
confederacy: He took arms again&s;t the elector of
Saxony, and the landgrave of He&s;&s;e: By the fortune of
war he made the former pri&s;oner: He employed treachery
and prevarication again&s;t the latter, and detained him
captive, by breaking a &s;afe-conduct which he had granted
him. He &s;eemed to have reached the &s;ummit of his am|bition;
and the German princes, who were a&s;toni&s;hed
with his &s;ucce&s;s, were farther di&s;couraged by the intel|ligence,
which they had received, of the death fir&s;t of
Henry the eighth, then of Francis the fir&s;t, their u&s;ual
re&s;ources in every calamity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sleidan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY the &s;econd, who &s;ucceeded to the crown
of France, was a prince of vigour and ability; but le&s;s
prompt in his re&s;olutions than Francis, and le&s;s enflamed
with rival&s;hip and animo&s;ity again&s;t the emperor, Charles.
Tho' he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the princes of the Smal|caldic
League, and promi&s;ed them his protection, he was
unwilling, in the commencement of his reign, to hurry
<PB N="316" REF="340">
into a war again&s;t &s;o great a power as that of the
emperor, and he thought that the alliance of the&s;e
princes was a &s;ure re&s;ource, which he could at any time
lay hold of<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Pere Daniel.</NOTE>. He was much governed by the duke of
Gui&s;e and the cardinal of Lorraine, brothers to the Queen|dowager
of Scotland, and he hearkened to their coun&s;el,
in chu&s;ing rather to give immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that an|tient
ally, which, even before the death of Henry the
eighth, had loudly claimed the protection of the French
monarchy.</P>
<P>THE hatred between the two factions, the partizans
of the antient and tho&s;e of the new religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s the reformation in Scotland.</NOTE> became every
day more violent in Scotland; and the re&s;olution, which
the cardinal primate had taken to employ the mo&s;t rigor|ous
puni&s;hments again&s;t the reformers, brought matters
to a quick deci&s;ion. There was one Wi&s;hart, a gentle|man
by birth, who employed him&s;elf with great zeal in
preaching again&s;t the antient &s;uper&s;titions, and began to
give alarm to the clergy, who were ju&s;tly terrified with
the danger of &s;ome fatal revolution in religion. This
man was much celebrated for the purity of his morals,
and for his exten&s;ive learning: But the&s;e prai&s;es cannot
be much depended on; becau&s;e, we know, that, among
the reformers, &s;everity of manners &s;tood in place of many
virtues; and the age was in general &s;o ignorant, that
mo&s;t of the prie&s;ts in Scotland imagined the New Te&s;ta|ment
to be a compo&s;ition of Luther's, and a&s;&s;erted that
the Old alone was the word of God<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, p. 75. The &s;ame author, p. 92, tells us a &s;tory, which confirms this character of the popi&s;h clergy in Scotland. It became a great di&s;pute in the university of St. Andrews, whether the <HI>pater</HI> &s;hould be &s;aid to God or the &s;aints. The friars, who knew in general that the reformers neglected the &s;aints, were determined to maintain their honour with great ob&s;tinacy, but they knew not upon what topics to found their doctrine. Some held that the <HI>pater</HI> was &s;aid to God <HI>formaliter,</HI> and to &s;aints <HI>materialiter;</HI> others, to God <HI>principaliter,</HI> and to &s;aints <HI>minus principaliter;</HI> others would have it <HI>ultimate</HI> and <HI>non ultimate:</HI> But the majority &s;eemed to hold, that the <HI>pater</HI> was &s;aid to God <HI>capiende &s;tricte,</HI> and to &s;aints <HI>capiendo large.</HI> A &s;imple fellow, who &s;erved the &s;ubprior, thinking there was &s;ome great matter in hand, that made the doctors hold &s;o many conferences together, a&s;ked him one day what the matter was; the &s;ub-prior an&s;wering, <HI>Tom,</HI> that was the fellow's name, <HI>we cannot agree to whom the pater-no&s;ter &s;hould be &s;aid.</HI> He &s;uddenly replied, <HI>To whom, Sir, should it be &s;aid, but unto God?</HI> Then &s;aid the &s;ub-prior, <HI>What &s;hall we do with the &s;aints?</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>Give them Aves and Creeds enow in the devil's name; for that may &s;uffice them.</HI> The an&s;wer going abroad, many &s;aid, <HI>that be bad given a wi&s;er deci&s;ion than all the doctors had done with all their di&s;tinctions.</HI></NOTE>. But however the
<PB N="317" REF="341">
ca&s;e may have been with regard to tho&s;e e&s;timable qua|lities
a&s;cribed to Wi&s;hart, he was &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
a de&s;ire of innovation; and he enjoyed tho&s;e talents,
which qualified him for becoming a popular preacher,
and for &s;eizing the attention and affections of the multi|tude.
The magi&s;trates of Dundee, where he exerci&s;ed
his mi&s;&s;ion, were alarmed with his progre&s;s; and being
unable or unwilling to treat himwith rigour, they con|tented
them&s;elves with denying him the liberty of
preaching, and with di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him the bounds of their
juri&s;diction. Wi&s;hart, moved with indignation, that they
had dared to reject the word of God, menaced them, in
imitation of the antient prophets, with &s;ome imminent
calamity; and he withdrew to the we&s;t country, where he
daily encrea&s;ed the number of his pro&s;elytes. Meanwhile,
a plague broke out in Dundee; and all men exclaimed,
that the town had drawn down the vengeance of Heaven
by bani&s;hing the pious preacher, and that the pe&s;tilence
would never cea&s;e till they had made him attonement for
their offence again&s;t him. No &s;ooner did Wi&s;hart hear
of this change in their di&s;po&s;ition, than he returned to
them, and made them a new tender of his doctrine: But
le&s;t he &s;hould &s;pread the contagion by bringing multitudes
together, he erected his pulpit on the top of a gate:
<PB N="318" REF="342">
The infected &s;tood within; the others without. And the
preacher failed not, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, to take advantage
of the immediate terrors of the people, and to enforce
his evangelical mi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Knox's Hi&s;t. of Ref. p. 44. Spot&s;wood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s of Wi&s;hart became an ob|ject
of attention to cardinal Beaton; and he re&s;olved,
by the puni&s;hment of &s;o celebrated a preacher, to &s;trike a
terror into all other innovators. He engaged the earl of
Bothwel to arre&s;t him in his retirement; and to deliver
him into his hands, contrary to a promi&s;e given by Both|wel
to that unhappy man: And being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his
prey, he conducted him to St. Andrew's, where, after a
trial, he condemned him to the flames for here&s;y. Arran,
the regent, was very irrc&s;olute in his temper; and the
cardinal, though he had gained him to his party, found,
that he would not concur in the condemnation and exe|cution
of Wi&s;hart. He determined, therefore, without
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ecular arm, to bring that heretic to
puni&s;hment; and he him&s;elf beheld from his windows
the di&s;mal &s;pectacle. Wi&s;hart &s;uffered with the u&s;ual
patience; but could not forbear remarking the triumph
of his in&s;ulting enemy. He foretold, that in a few days
he would in the very &s;ame place lie as low, as now he
was exalted alo&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to true piety and reli|gion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Spot&s;wood, Buchanan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS prophecy was probably the immediate cau&s;e of
the event which it foretold. The di&s;ciples of this mar|tyr,
enraged at the cruel execution, formed a con&s;piracy
again&s;t the cardinal; and having a&s;&s;ociated to them Nor|man
Le&s;ly, who was di&s;gu&s;ted on account of &s;ome pri|vate
quarrel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of cardinal Beaton.</NOTE> they conducted their enterprize with great
&s;ecrecy and &s;ucce&s;s. Early in the morning they entered
the cardinal's palace, which he had &s;ftrongly fortified;
<PB N="319" REF="343">
and though they were not above &s;ixteen per&s;ons, they
thru&s;t out an hundred trade&s;men and fifty &s;ervants, whom
they &s;eized &s;eparately, before any &s;u&s;picion aro&s;e of their
intentions; and having &s;hut the gates, they proceeded
very deliberately to execute their purpo&s;e on the cardinal.
That prelate had been alarmed with the noi&s;e which
he heard in the ca&s;tle; and had barricadoe'd the door
of his chamber: But finding that they had brought fire in
order to force their way, and having obtained, as is be|lieved,
a promi&s;e of life, he opened the door; and re|minding
them, that he was a prie&s;t, he conjured them to
&s;pare him. Two of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins ru&s;hed upon him with
drawn &s;words; but a third, James Melvil, more calm
and more con&s;iderate in villany, &s;topped their career, and
bid them reflect, that this &s;acri&s;ice was the work and
judgment of God, and ought to be executed with the
utmo&s;t deliberation and gravity. Then turning the point
of his &s;word towards Beaton, he called to him, &startq;Re|pent
thee, thou wicked cardinal, of all thy &s;ins and
iniquities, but e&s;pecially of the murder of Wi&s;hart,
that in&s;trument of God for the conver&s;ion of the&s;e
lands: It is his death, which now cries vengeance up|on
thee: We are &s;ent by God to inflict the de&s;erved
puni&s;hment. For here, before the Almighty, I pro|te&s;t,
that it is neither hatred of thy per&s;on, nor love
of thy riches, nor fear of thy power, which moves me
to &s;eek thy death: But only becau&s;e thou ha&s;t been,
and &s;till remaine&s;t, an ob&s;tinate enemy to Chri&s;t Je&s;us,
and his holy go&s;pel.&endq; Having &s;poke the&s;e words,
without giving him lei&s;ure to fini&s;h that repentance, to
which he exhorted him, he thru&s;t him through the body;
and the cardinal fell dead at his feet<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The famous Scots reformer, John Knox, calls James Melvil, p. 65. a man mo&s;t gentle and mo&s;t mode&s;t. It is very horrid, but at the &s;ame time &s;omewhat amu&s;ing, to consider the joy and alacrity and plea&s;ure, which that hi&s;torian di&s;covers in his narration of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: And it is remarkable that in the fir&s;t edition of his work, the&s;e words were printed on the margin of the page, <HI>The godly Fact and Words of James Melvil.</HI> But the following editors retrenched them. Knox him&s;elf had no hand in the murder of Beaton; but he afterwards joined the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in holding out the ca&s;tle. See Keith's Hi&s;t. of the Ref. of Scotland, p. 43.</NOTE>. This murther
<PB N="320" REF="344">
was executed on the 28th of May 1546. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins
being reinforced by their friends to the number of an
hundred and forty per&s;ons, prepared them&s;elves for the
defence of the ca&s;tle, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to London,
craving a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Henry. That prince, tho' Scot|land
was comprehended in his peace with France, would
not reject this opportunity of di&s;turbing the government
of that kingdom; and he agreed to take them under his
protection.</P>
<P>IT was the peculiar misfortune of Scotland, that five
&s;hort reigns had been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively followed by as many long
minorities; and the execution of ju&s;tice, which the prince
was beginning to introduce, had been continually inter|rupted
by the cabals, factions, and animo&s;ities of the
great. But be&s;ides the&s;e inveterate and antient evils, a
new &s;ource of di&s;order had ari&s;en, the di&s;putes and con|tentions
of theology, which were &s;ufficient to di&s;turb the
mo&s;t &s;ettled government; and the death of the cardinal,
who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ability and vigour, &s;eemed much to
weaken the hands of the admini&s;tration. But the Queen-dowager
was a woman of uncommon talents and virtues;
and &s;he did as much to &s;upport the government, and &s;up|ply
the weakne&s;s of Arran, the governor, as could be ex|pected
in her &s;ituation. A &s;tipulation was made with the
garri&s;on of St. Andrews, that they &s;hould &s;urrender the
ca&s;tle upon receiving a pardon, together with an ab&s;olu|tion
from the Pope; and that they &s;hould never after|wards
be called in que&s;tion for Beaton's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.
Meanwhile, till the pope's ab&s;olution &s;hould arrive, &s;he
<PB N="321" REF="345">
applied to France for &s;uccours; and Henry &s;ent her &s;ome
gallies, with a train of artillery, commanded by Strozzi,
prior of Capua. Before the &s;iege of St. Andrews was
opened, the ab&s;olution was &s;ent to the garri&s;on, and they
were required to &s;urrende; but becau&s;e the pope, among
other exaggerations of the cardinal's murder, had &s;aid,
that he pardoned an unpardonable crime, the garri&s;on,
fearing that this expre&s;&s;ion was employed in order to en|&s;nare
them, refu&s;ed to open their gates<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 75. Spot&s;wood, Buchanan.</NOTE>. They were,
however, &s;oon obliged to depart from their ob&s;tinacy:
A great breach was made in the walls: The plague
broke out among them: And &s;eeing no hopes of &s;uc|cour
from England, they &s;urrendered to the French
upon conditions, which were not very &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erv|ed
to them.</P>
<P>THE protector of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the war with Scot|land.</NOTE> &s;o &s;oon as the govern|ment
was brought to &s;ome compo&s;ure, made preparations
for the attack of Scotland; and he was determined to
execute, if po&s;&s;ible, that project, of uniting the two
kingdoms by marriage, on which the late King had been
&s;o intent, and which he had recommended with his dying
breath to his executors. He rai&s;ed an army of 18,000
men, and equipped a fleet of &s;ixty &s;ail, one half of which
were &s;hips of war, the other loaded with provi&s;ions and
ammunition. He gave the command of the fleet to lord
Clinton: He him&s;elf marched at the head of the army,
attended by the earl of Warwic. The&s;e ho&s;tile mea&s;ures
were covered with a pretence of revenging &s;ome depre|dations
committed by the borderers; but be&s;ides, that the
protector revived the antient claim of the &s;uperiority of the
Engli&s;h crown over that of Scotland, he refu&s;ed to enter
into negotiation on any other conditions than the marriage
of the young queen with Edward.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="346">
THE protector publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, in which he in|forced
all the arguments for that mea&s;ure. He &s;aid,
that nature &s;eemed originally to have intended this i&s;land
for one empire; and having cut it off from all communi|cation
with foreign &s;tates, and guarded it by the ocean,
&s;he had pointed out to the inhabitants the road to hap|pine&s;s
and &s;ecurity: That the education and cu&s;toms of
the people concurred with nature; and by giving them
the &s;ame language, and laws, and manners, had invited
them to a thorough union and coalition: That fortune
had at la&s;t removed all ob&s;tacles, and had prepared an
expedient, by which they might become one people,
without leaving any place for that jealou&s;y either of ho|nour
or of intere&s;t, to which rival nations are naturally &s;o
much expo&s;ed: That the crown of Scotland had devolved
to a female; that of England to a male; and happily the
two &s;overeigns, as of a rank, were al&s;o of an age, the
mo&s;t &s;uitable to each other: That the ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition,
which prevailed between the nations, and which aro&s;e from
pa&s;t injuries, would &s;oon be extingui&s;hed, after a long
and &s;ecure peace had e&s;tabli&s;hed confidence between them:
That the memory of former mi&s;eries, which at pre&s;ent
inflamed their mutual animo&s;ity, would then &s;erve only
to make them cheri&s;h, with more pa&s;&s;ion, a &s;tate of hap|pine&s;s
and tranquillity, &s;o long unknown to their ance&s;|tors:
That when ho&s;tilities had cea&s;ed between the king|doms,
the Scots nobility, who were at pre&s;ent obliged
to remain perpetually in a warlike po&s;ture, would learn
to cultivate the arts of peace, and would &s;often their
minds to a love of dome&s;tic order and obedience: That
as this &s;ituation was de&s;irable to both kingdoms, &s;o par|ticularly
to Scotland, which had been expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t
mi&s;eries from inte&s;tine and foreign wars, and &s;aw her&s;elf
every moment in danger of lo&s;ing her independency, by
the efforts of a richer and more powerful people: That
<PB N="323" REF="347">
tho' England had claims of &s;uperiority, &s;he was willing
to res;ign every preten&s;ion for the &s;ake of future peace,
and de&s;ired an union, which would be the more &s;ecure,
as it would be concluded on terms entirely equal: And
that be&s;ides all the&s;e motives, po&s;itive engagements had
been taken for the compleating this alliance, and the
honour and good faith of the nation were pledged to fulfil
what her intere&s;t and &s;afety &s;o loudly demanded<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sir John Haywood in Kennet, p. 279. Heylin, p. 42.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOMERSET &s;oon found, that the&s;e remon&s;trances would
have no influence; and that the Queen dowager's at|tachments
to France and to the catholic religion would
render ineffectual all negotiations for the intended mar|riage.
He found him&s;elf therefore obliged to try the force
of arms, and to con&s;train the Scots by nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ubmit
to a mea&s;ure, for which they &s;eemed to have entertained
the mo&s;t incurable aver&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of Sept.</NOTE> He pa&s;&s;ed the borders at

any re&s;i&s;tance for &s;ome days, except from &s;ome &s;mall
ca&s;tles, which were con&s;trained to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.
The protector intended to have puni&s;hed the governor
and garri&s;on of one of tho&s;e ca&s;tles for their temerity in
re&s;i&s;ting &s;uch unequal force; But they eluded his anger by
a&s;king only a few hours re&s;pite till they &s;hould prepare
them&s;elves for death; after which they found his ears more
open to their applications for mercy<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Haywood. Patten.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE governor of Scotland had &s;ummoned together the
whole force of the kingdom; and his army, double the
number of the Engli&s;h, had taken po&s;t on very advanta|geous
ground, guarded by the banks of the E&s;ke, about
four miles from Edinburgh. The Engli&s;h came within
&s;ight of them at Fa&s;ide; and after a &s;kirmi&s;h between
the hor&s;e, where the Scots were wor&s;ted, and lord Hume
<PB N="324" REF="348">
dangerou&s;ly wounded, Somer&s;et prepared him&s;elf for a
more deci&s;ive action. But having taken a view of the
Scots camp with the earl of Warwic, he found it difficult
to make any attempt upon it with a probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s.
He wrote therefore another letter to Arran; and
offered to retire out of the kingdom, as well as to repair
all damages which he had committed, provided that the
Scots would &s;tipulate not to contract the Queen to any
foreign prince, but to keep her at home, till &s;he reached
the age of choo&s;ing a hu&s;band for her&s;elf. Such mode|rate
terms were rejected by the Scots merely on account
of their moderation; and they begat an opinion, that
the protector mu&s;t either be reduced to great di&s;tre&s;s or
be influenced by fear, that he was now contented to
abate &s;o much of his former preten&s;ions. Actuated al&s;o
by their prie&s;ts, who had come to the camp in great
numbers, they believed, that the Engli&s;h were dete&s;table
heretics, abhorred of God, and expo&s;ed to divine ven|geance;
and that no &s;ucce&s;s could ever crown their arms.
They were confirmed in this fond conceit, when they
&s;aw the protector change his ground, and move towards
the &s;ea; nor did they any longer doubt that he intended
to embark his army, and make his e&s;cape on board the
&s;hips, which at that very time moved into the bay, oppo|&s;ite
to him<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 985.</NOTE>. Determined therefore to cut off his retreat,
they quitted their camp;<NOTE PLACE="marg">$0th Sept.</NOTE> and pa&s;&s;ing the river E&s;ke, ad|vanced
into the plain. They were divided into three
bodies: Angus commanded the vanguard; Arran the
main body; Huntley the rear: Their cavalry con&s;i&s;ted
only of light hor&s;e, which were placed on their left flank,
&s;trengthened by &s;ome Iri&s;h archers, whom Argyle had
brought over for this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>SOMERSET was plea&s;ed when he &s;aw this movement
of the Scots army; and as the Engli&s;h had u&s;ually been
<PB N="325" REF="349">
&s;uperior in pitched battles, he conceived great hopes of
&s;ucce&s;s. He arranged his van on his left, farthe&s;t from
the &s;ea; and ordered them to remain on the high grounds
on which he placed them, till the enemy &s;hould approach:
He placed his main battle and his rear towards the right;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battle of Pinkey.</NOTE>
and beyond the van he po&s;ted lord Grey at the head of
the men at arms, and ordered him to take the Scots van
in flank, but not till they &s;hould be engaged in clo&s;e
fight with the van of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>WHILE the Scots were advancing on the plain, they
were galled with the artillery from the Engli&s;h &s;hips:
The ma&s;ter of Graham was killed: The Iri&s;h archers
were thrown into di&s;order; and even the other troops
began to &s;tagger: When the lord Grey, perceiving their
&s;ituation, neglected his orders, left his ground, and at
the head of his heavy-armed hor&s;e made an attack on the
Scots infantry, in hopes of gaining all the honour of the
victory. On advancing, he found a &s;lough and ditch in
his way; and behind were ranged the Scots infantry arm|ed
with &s;pears, and the field, on which they &s;tood, was
fallow ground, broken with ridges, which lay cro&s;s their
front, and di&s;ordered the movements of the Engli&s;h ca|valry.
From all the&s;e accidents, the &s;hock of this body
of hor&s;e was feeble and irregular; and as they were re|ceived
on the points of the Scotti&s;h &s;pears, which were
longer than the lances of the Engli&s;h hor&s;emen, they
were in a moment pierced, overthrown, and di&s;comfited.
Grey him&s;elf was dangerou&s;ly wounded: Lord Edward
Seymour, &s;on to the protector, lo&s;t his hor&s;e; The &s;tan|dard
was near being taken: And had the Scots po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
any good body of cavalry, who could have pur&s;ued the
advantage, the whole Engli&s;h army had been expo&s;ed to
great danger<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Patten, Holling&s;hed, p. 986.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="350">
THE protector mean-while, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Sir Ralph Sadler
and Sir Ralph Vane, employed him&s;elf with diligence
and &s;ucce&s;s, in rallying the cavalry. Warwic &s;howed
great pre&s;ence of mind in maintaining the ranks of the
foot, on which the hor&s;e had recoiled: Me made Sir Peter
Meutas advance, captain of the foot hackbutters, and
Sir Peter Gamboa, captain of &s;ome Italian and Spani&s;h
hackbutters, on hor&s;eback; and ordered them to ply the
Scots infantry with their &s;hot. They marched to the
&s;lough, and di&s;charged their pieces full in the face of the
enemy: The &s;hips galled them from the flank: The
artillery, planted on a height, infe&s;ted them from the
front: The Engli&s;h archers poured in a &s;hower of arrows
upon them: And the vanguard, de&s;cending from the hill,
advanced, lei&s;urely and orderly, towards them. Di&s;|mayed
with all the&s;e circum&s;tances, the Scots van began
to retreat: The retreat &s;oon changed into a flight, which
was begun by the Iri&s;h archers. The pannic of the van
communicated it&s;elf to the main body, and pa&s;&s;ing thence
to the rear, rendered the whole field a &s;cene of confu&s;ion,
terror, flight and con&s;ternation. The Engli&s;h army per|ceived
from the heights the condition of the Scots, and
began the pur&s;uit with loud &s;houts and acclamations,
which added &s;till more to the di&s;may of the vanqui&s;hed.
The hor&s;e in particular, eager to revenge the affront,
which they had received in the beginning of the day,
performed the mo&s;t bloody execution on the flying enemy;
and from the field of battle to Edinburgh, for the &s;pace
of five miles, the whole ground was &s;trowed with dead
bodies. The prie&s;ts above all, and the monks received
no quarter; and the Engli&s;h made &s;port of &s;laughtering
men, who, from their extreme zeal and animo&s;ity, had
engaged in an enterpri&s;e &s;o ill &s;uited to their profe&s;&s;ion.
Few victories have been more deci&s;ive, or gained with
&s;maller lo&s;s to the conquerors. There fell not two hun|dred

of the Engli&s;h; and according to the mo&s;t moderate
computation, there peri&s;hed above ten thou&s;and of the
Scots. About fifteen hundred were taken pri&s;oners. This
action was called the Battle of Pinkey, from a nobleman's
&s;eat of that name in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>THE Queen dowager and Arran fled to Stirling, and
were &s;carce able to collect &s;uch a body of forces as could
check the incur&s;ions of &s;mall parties of the Engli&s;h.
About the &s;ame time, the earl of Lenox and lord Wharton
entered the We&s;t Marches, at the head of five thou&s;and
men, and after taking and plundering Annan, they &s;pread
deva&s;tation over all the neighbouring countries<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 992.</NOTE>. Had
Somer&s;et pro&s;ecuted his advantage, he might have impo&s;ed
what terms he plea&s;ed on the Scots nation: But he was
impatient to return to England, where he heard, &s;ome
coun&s;ellors, arid even his own brother, the admiral, were
carrying on cabals again&s;t his authority. Having taken
the ca&s;tles of Hume, Dungla&s;s, Eymouth, Fa&s;tca&s;tle,
Roxborough, and &s;ome other &s;mall places; and having
received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome counties on the borders,
he retired out of Scotland. The fleet, be&s;ides de&s;troying
all the &s;hips along the coa&s;t, took Broughty in the Firth
of Tay, and haying fortified it, they left there a gar|ri&s;on.
Arran de&s;ired leave to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners in order
to treat of a peace; and Somer&s;et, having appointed
Berwic for the place of meeting, left Warwic with full
powers to negociate: But no commi&s;&s;ioners from Scot|land
ever appeared. The overture of the Scots was an
artifice, to gain time, till &s;uccours &s;hould arrive from
France.</P>
<P>THE protector,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th No|vember.</NOTE> on his arrival in England, &s;ummoned
a Parliament: And being &s;omewhat elated with his &s;uc|ce&s;s

&s;ame honours and privileges which had u&s;ually been po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by any princes of the blood, or uncles of the Kings
of England. In this parent, the King di&s;pen&s;ed with
the &s;tatute of precedency, enacted during the former
reign<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xv. p. 164.</NOTE>. But if Somer&s;et gave offence by a&s;&s;uming too
much &s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> he de&s;erves the highe&s;t prai&s;e on account of
the laws pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, by which the rigour of former
&s;tatutes was much mitigated, and &s;ome &s;ecurity given to
the freedom of the con&s;titution. All laws were repealed
which extended the crime of trea&s;on beyond the &s;tatute
of the twenty-fifth of Edward the third<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 12.</NOTE>; all laws en|acted

with the &s;tatute of the &s;ix articles. None were to be ac|cu&s;ed
of words but within a month after they were &s;poken.
By the&s;e repeals &s;everal of the mo&s;t rigorous laws that
ever were pa&s;&s;ed in England, were annulled, and &s;ome
dawnings, both of civil and religious liberty, began to
appear to the people. Here&s;y, however, was &s;till a ca|pital
crime by the common law, and was &s;ubjected to
the penalty of burning. Only there remained no preci&s;e
&s;tandard by which that crime could be defined or deter|mined:
A circum&s;tance which might either be advan|tageous
or hurtful to public &s;ecurity, according to the
di&s;po&s;ition of the judges.</P>
<P>A REPEAL al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed of that law, the de&s;truction of
all laws, by which the King's proclamation was made of
equal force with a &s;tatute<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 2.</NOTE>. That other law was like|wi&s;e
mitigated, by which the King was empowered to
annul all laws pa&s;&s;ed before the four and twentieth year

could not recal any pa&s;&s;ed effects, which had en&s;ued from
them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Edw. VI. c. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME &s;tatutes too were pa&s;&s;ed which were of the ut|mo&s;t
importance, becau&s;e they promoted the principles
and practices of the reformers, though they may not, all
of them, appear to be attended with any material con|equences
to civil &s;ociety. The cup was re&s;tored to the
laity; private ma&s;&s;es were aboli&s;hed; the King was em|powered
to create bi&s;hops by letters patent, without any
fictitious election of the chapter; the bi&s;hops were or|dered
to i&s;&s;ue their writs, and hold their courts in the
King's name<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; vagabonds were adjudged to be &s;laves

&s;trolling prie&s;ts and friars.</P>
<P>THE chantries and free chapels had been given by act
of Parliament to the late King; and he had appointed
commi&s;&s;ioners to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the revenues; but as
they had not proceeded far in the execution of their of|fice,
it was found nece&s;&s;ary to make a renewal of the
grant. The preamble to the &s;tatute promi&s;es, that the&s;e
funds &s;hould be employed to good and godly u&s;es, in
erecting grammar &s;chools, in farther augmenting the
univer&s;ities, and in making better provi&s;ion for the poor

devoured the prey in their imaginations; and it was not
long before it was &s;hared out among them.</P>
<P>IT was al&s;o enacted, that all who denied the King's
&s;upremacy, or a&s;&s;erted the pope's, &s;hould, for the fir&s;t

any overt act or deed, to deprive the King of his e&s;tate

trea&s;on. If any of the heirs of the crown &s;hould u&s;urp
upon another, or endeavour to break the order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
it was declared trea&s;on in them, their aiders and
abetters. The&s;e were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable acts pa&s;&s;ed
during this &s;e&s;&s;ion. The members di&s;covered a very
pa&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition with regard to religion: Some few ap|peared
zealous for the reformation: Others harboured
&s;ecretly a &s;trong inclination to the catholic faith: But
the greate&s;t part appeared willing to take any impre&s;&s;ion
which they &s;hould receive from intere&s;t, authority, or the
reigning fa&s;hion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 48.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE convocation met at the &s;ame time with the Par|liament;
and as it appeared, that their debates were at
fir&s;t cramped by the rigour of the &s;tatute of the &s;ix arti|cles,
the King granted them a di&s;pen&s;ation from that
law, before it was repealed by Parliament<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Britan, p. 339.</NOTE>. The lower
hou&s;e of convocation applied to, have liberty of &s;itting
with the commons in Parliament; or if this privilege
was refu&s;ed them, which they claimed as their ancient
right, they de&s;ired that no law regarding religion, might
pa&s;s in Parliament without their con&s;ent and approbation.
But the principles which now prevailed, were more ad|vantageous
to the civil than the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power.</P>
<P>THE protector had permitted the repeal of that law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1548.</NOTE>
which gave to the King's proclamations the authority of
&s;tatutes; but he did not intend to renounce that arbitrary
<PB N="331" REF="355">
or di&s;cretionary exerci&s;e of power, which had ever been
a&s;&s;umed by the crown, an$ which it is difficult to di&s;tint|gui&s;h
exactly from the power of making laws. He even
continued to exert this authority in &s;ome particulars,
which were regarded as the mo&s;t momentous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther progre&s;s of the refor|mation.</NOTE> Orders

practices, now denominated &s;uper&s;titions; tho' it
is very fortunate for mankind, when &s;uper&s;tition, happens
to take a direction &s;o innocent and inoffen&s;ive. The &s;e|vere
di&s;po&s;ition which naturally attends all reformers,
prompted likewi&s;e the council to aboli&s;h &s;ome gay and
&s;howy ceremonies, which belonged to the ancient reli|gion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN order was al&s;o i&s;&s;ued by the council for the remo|val
of all images from the churches: An innovation
which was much de&s;ired by all the reformers, and which
alone, with regard to the populace, amounted almo&s;t to
a total change of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. 60. Collier, vol. ii. p. 241. Heylin, p. 55.</NOTE>. An attempt
had been made to &s;eparate the u&s;e of images from their
abu&s;e, the reverence from the wor&s;hip of them; but the
execution of this de&s;ign was found, upon trial, very dif|ficult,
if not wholly impracticable.</P>
<P>AS private ma&s;&s;es were aboli&s;hed by law, it became
nece&s;&s;ary to frame a new communion-office; and the
council went &s;o far, in the preface which they had pre|fixed
to this work, as to leave the practice of auricular
confe&s;&s;ion wholly indifferent<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii.</NOTE>. This was a prelude to
the entire abolition of that invention, one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="332" REF="356">
powerful engines that ever was contrived for degrading
the laity, and giving their &s;piritual guides an entire a&s;cen|dant
over them. And it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, that though
the prie&s;t's ab&s;olution, which attends confe&s;&s;ion, &s;erves
&s;omewhat to ea&s;e weak minds from the immediate agonies
of &s;uper&s;titious terror, it operates only by enforcing &s;u|per&s;tition
it&s;elf, and thereby preparing the mind for a
more violent relap&s;e into the &s;ame di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THE people were at that time extremely di&s;tracted, by
the oppo&s;ite opinions of their preachers; and as they
were totally incapable to judge of the rea&s;ons advanced
on either fide, and naturally regarded every thing which
they heard at church, as of equal authority, a great con|fu&s;ion
and fluctuation re&s;ulted from this uncertainty.
The council fir&s;t endeavoured to remedy that inconve|nience,
by laying &s;ome re&s;traints on preaching; but
finding this expedient ineffectual, they impo&s;ed a total
&s;ilence on the preachers, and thus put an end at once to
all the polemics of the pulpit<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fuller, Heylin, Burnet.</NOTE>. By the nature of things,
this re&s;traint could only be temporary. For in propor|tion
as the ceremonies of public wor&s;hip, its &s;hews and
exterior ob&s;ervances, were retrenched by the reformers,
the people were inclined to contract a &s;tronger attach|ment
to &s;ermons, whence alone they received any occu|pation
or amu&s;ement. The ancient religion, by giving
its votaries &s;omething to do, freed them from the trouble
of thinking: Sermons were only delivered in the princi|pal
churches, and at &s;ome particular fa&s;ts and fe&s;tivals:
And the practice of haranguing the populace, which, if
abu&s;ed, is &s;o powerful an incitement to faction and &s;edi|tion,
had much le&s;s &s;cope and influence during tho&s;e
ages.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="357">
THE greater progre&s;s was made towards a reformation
in England, the further did the protector find him&s;elf
from all pro&s;pect of compleating the union with Scot|land;
and the Queen-dowager,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> as well as the clergy,
became the more aver&s;e to all alliance with a nation
which had departed &s;o far from all ancient principles.
Somer&s;et, having taken the town of Haddington, had or|dered
it to be &s;trongly garri&s;oned and fortified, by lord
Gray: He al&s;o erected &s;ome fortifications at Lauder:
And he hoped, that the&s;e two places, together with
Broughty and &s;ome &s;maller fortre&s;&s;es, which were in the
hands of the Engli&s;h, would &s;erve as a curb to Scot|land;
and would give him acce&s;s into the heart of the
country.</P>
<P>ARRAN, being di&s;appointed in &s;ome attempts on
Broughty, relied chiefly on the &s;uccours expected from
France, for the recovery of the&s;e places; and they ar|rived
at la&s;t in the Firth, to the number of &s;ix thou&s;and
men; one half of whom were Germans. They were
commanded by De&s;&s;&eacute;, and under him by Andelot, Strozzi,
Meilleraye, count Rhingrave. The Scots were at that
time &s;o &s;unk by their misfortunes, that five hundred
Engli&s;h hor&s;e were able to ravage the whole country
without re&s;i&s;tance; and make inroads to the gates of the
capital<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Beague, hi&s;t. of the Campagnes 1548 and 1549, p. 6.</NOTE>: But on the appearance of the French &s;uccours,
they collected more courage; and having joined De&s;&s;&eacute;
with a con&s;iderable reinforcement, they laid &s;iege to
Haddington<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 993.</NOTE>. This was an undertaking for which they
were them&s;elves totally unfit; being only practi&s;ed in a
kind of de&s;ultory war, where they &s;erved without pay,
and with a few weeks provi&s;ions, which they brought
along with them. Even with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French,
<PB N="334" REF="358">
they placed their chief hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in &s;tarving the
garri&s;on; and after &s;ome vain attempts to take the place
by a regular &s;iege, the blockade of Haddington was
formed. The garri&s;on were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s in &s;everal
&s;ailles which they made upon the be&s;iegers.</P>
<P>THE ho&s;tile attempts which the late King and the
protector had made again&s;t Scotland, not being &s;teady,
regular, nor pu&s;hed to the la&s;t extremity, had &s;erved only
to irritate the nation, and to in&s;pire them with the &s;trong|e&s;t
aver&s;ion to that confederacy which was courted in &s;o
violent a manner. Even tho&s;e who were inclined to the
Engli&s;h alliance, were di&s;plea&s;ed to have it impo&s;ed on
them by force of arms; and the earl of Huntley in par|ticular,
&s;aid plea&s;antly, that he di&s;liked not the match,
but he hated the manner of wooing<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 46. Patten.</NOTE>. The Queen-dowager,
finding the&s;e &s;entiments to prevail, called a Par|liament,
in an abbey near Haddington; and it was there
propo&s;ed, that the young Queen, for her greater &s;ecu|rity,
&s;hould be &s;ent to France, and be committed to the
protection of that ancient ally. Some objected, that
this mea&s;ure was de&s;perate, allowed no re&s;ource in ca&s;e
of mi&s;carriage, expo&s;ed the Scots to be &s;ubjected by
foreigners, involved them in perpetual war with Eng|land,
and left them no expedient by which they could
conciliate the friend&s;hip of that powerful nation. It
was an&s;wered, on the other hand, that the Queen's
pre&s;ence was the very cau&s;e of war with England; that
that nation would de&s;i&s;t when they found that their views
of forcing a marriage had become altogether impracti|cable;
and that Henry, being engaged by &s;o high a mark
of confidence, would take their &s;overeign under his
guardian&s;hip, and u&s;e his utmo&s;t efforts to defend the
kingdom. The&s;e arguments were aided by French

put the garri&s;on to the &s;word: They repul&s;ed, with lo&s;s,
the Engli&s;h, who, under the command of lord Seymour,
made a de&s;cent, fir&s;t in Fife, and then at Montro&s;e:
In the former action, James Stuart, natural brother to
<PB N="336" REF="360">
the Queen, acquired honours; in the latter, Are&s;kine of
Dun. An attempt was made by Sir Robert Bowes and
Sir Thomas Palmer, at the head of a con&s;iderable body,
to throw relief into Haddington; but the&s;e troops falling
into an ambu&s;cade, were almo&s;t wholly cut in pieces<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 595. Holling&s;hed, p. 994.</NOTE>.
And though a &s;mall body of two hundred men e&s;caped all
the vigilance of the French, and arrived &s;afely in Had|dington,
with &s;ome ammunition and provi&s;ions, the gar|ri&s;on
was reduced to &s;uch difficulties, that the protector
found it nece&s;&s;ary to provide more effectually for their
relief. He rai&s;ed an army of eighteen thou&s;and men,
And adding three thou&s;and Gernans, who, on the di&s;&s;o|lution
of the prote&s;tant alliance, had offered their &s;ervice
to England, he gave the command of the whole to the
earl of Shrew&s;bury<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 291.</NOTE>. D'E&s;&s;&eacute; rai&s;ed the &s;iege on the ap|proach
of the Engli&s;h; and with great difficulty made
good his retreat to Edinburgh, where he po&s;ted him&s;elf
advantageou&s;ly. Shrew&s;bury, who had lo&s;t the opportu|nity
of attacking him on his march, dur&s;t not give him
battle in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and contenting him&s;elf
with the advantage already gained of &s;upplying Hadding|ton,
he retired into England.</P>
<P>WHILE the French troops remained in Scotland,
many complaints had ari&s;en between them and the na|tives;
and a &s;mall accident<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Beagu&eacute;, p. 68. Knox, p. 81.</NOTE> having excited a tumult in
Edinburgh, the provo&s;t and his &s;on were unfortunately
killed by the French &s;oldiers. This event encrea&s;ed the
animo&s;ity between the two nations: But D'E&s;&s;&eacute;, in or|der
to make atonement for that act of violence, led his
troops ha&s;tily to Haddington, and in the night-time at|tempted
to &s;urprize the town. He found the garri&s;on
unprepared to re&s;i&s;t him; and had already entered the
<PB N="337" REF="361">
outer court: But a French de&s;erter firing a cannon,
which pointed towards the gates, the &s;hot fell among the
thicke&s;t of the enemy, and made &s;uch havoc as threw the
whole into confu&s;ion, and enabled the Engli&s;h to repul&s;e
them. R is pretended, that no le&s;s than a hundred per|&s;ons
fell by this &s;ingle &s;hot.</P>
<P>THE French general was a man of ability and expe|rience;
but as he had not the good fortune to be ac|ceptable
to the Scots nation, it was thought proper to re|call
him, and to &s;end over De Thermes in his place.
D'E&s;&s;&eacute;, before his departure, fortified Leith, which,
from a &s;mall village, &s;oon became a con&s;iderable town,
by the concour&s;e of inhabitants, who found there a &s;e|curity,
which they could no where el&s;e enjoy in Scot|land.
He al&s;o attacked an Engli&s;h garri&s;on in Inch|keith,
an i&s;land oppo&s;ite to that harbour, and made them
pri&s;oners. After the&s;e exploits, he re&s;igned his command
to De Thermes, who brought over with him Monluc,
bi&s;hop of Valence, a man celebrated for wi&s;dom and
ability. This prelate was named chancellor of the king|dom;
and it was probably intended, by his means, to
in&s;pire the nation with &s;ome greater attachment to the
principles of law and equity: But the Scots, impatient
of re&s;traint, and jealous of a foreigner, expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch
di&s;content, that it was thought more prudent &s;oon after
to recall him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 85. Thuanus, lib. v. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH the protection of France was of great con|&s;equence
to the Scots, in &s;upporting them again&s;t the in|va&s;ions
of England, they reaped &s;till more benefit from
the di&s;tractions and divi&s;ions which had crept into the
councils of that latter kingdom Even the two brothers,

&s;tations which they &s;everally enjoyed, and the great emi|nence
to which they had ri&s;en, had entertained the mo&s;t
violent jealou&s;y of each other's authority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabals of lord Sey|mour.</NOTE> and they di|vided
the whole court and kingdom, by their oppo&s;ite
cabals and preten&s;ions. Lord Seymour was a man of
in&s;atiable ambition, arrogant, a&s;&s;uming, implacable;
and though e&s;teemed of &s;uperior capacity to the protector,
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not to the &s;ame degree the confidence and
regard of the people. By his flattery and addre&s;s, he had
&s;o in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the good graces of the Queen-dowager,
that, forgetting her u&s;ual prudence and de|cency,
&s;he married him immediately upon the decea&s;e
of the late King: In&s;omuch, that, had &s;he &s;oon proved
pregnant, it might have been doubtful to which hu&s;band
the child belonged. The credit and riches of this alli|ance
&s;upported the ambition of the admiral; but gave
umbrage to the dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et, who, unea&s;y that
the younger brother's wife &s;hould have the precedency,
employed all her intere&s;t with her hu&s;band, which was
too great, fir&s;t to create, and then to widen a breach be|tween
the two brothers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 301. Heylin, p. 72. Camden&punc; Thuanus, lib. vi. c. 5. Haynes, p. 69.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of this mi&s;under&s;tanding appeared
when the protector commanded the army in Scotland.
The &s;ecretary, Paget, a man devoted to Somer&s;et, re|marked,
that Seymour was forming &s;eparate intrigues
among the coun&s;ellors; was corrupting, by pre&s;ents, the
King's &s;ervants; and even endeavouring, by improper
indulgencies and liberalities, to captivate the affections
of the young monarch. Paget repre&s;ented to him the
danger of this conduct; de&s;ired him to reflect on the nu|merous
enemies whom the &s;udden elevation of their fa|mily
had created; and warned him that any di&s;&s;en&s;ion
<PB N="339" REF="365">
between him and the protector, would be greedily laid
hold of, to draw on the ruin of both. Finding his re|mon&s;trances
ineffectual, he conveyed intelligence of the
danger to Somer&s;et, and engaged him to leave the enter|prize
upon Scotland unfini&s;hed, in order to guard again&s;t
the attempts of his dome&s;tic enemies. In the en&s;uing
Parliament, the admiral's projects appeared &s;till more
hazardous to public tranquillity; and as he had acquired
many partisans and retainers, he made a direct attack
upon his brother's authority. He repre&s;ented to his
friends, that formerly, during a minority, the office of
protector of the kingdom had been kept &s;eparate from
that of governor of the King's per&s;on; and that the pre|&s;ent
union of the&s;e two important tru&s;ts, conferred on
Somer&s;et an authority which could not &s;afely be lodged
in any &s;ubject<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 82, 90.</NOTE>. He even prevailed on the young King,
to write a letter to the Parliament, de&s;iring that Seymour
might be appointed his governor; and he had formed a
party in the two hou&s;es, by which he hoped to have ef|fected
his purpo&s;e. The de&s;ign was di&s;covered before its
execution; and &s;ome common friends were &s;ent to re|mon&s;trate
with him, but had &s;o little influence, that he
threw out many menacing expre&s;&s;ions, and ra&s;hly threat|ned,
that, if he was thwarted in his attempt, he would
make this Parliament the blacke&s;t that ever was in Eng|land<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 75.</NOTE>.
The council &s;ent for him, to an&s;wer for his con|duct;
but he refu&s;ed to attend: They then began to
threaten in their turn, and informed him, that the King's
letter, in&s;tead of availing him any thing to the execution
of his purpo&s;e, would be imputed to him as a criminal
enterprise, and be con&s;trued a de&s;ign no di&s;turb the go|vernment,
by forming a &s;eparate intere&s;t with a child
and minor. They even let fall &s;ome menaces of &s;ending
<PB N="340" REF="366">
him to the Tower for his temerity; and the admiral,
finding hlm&s;elf prevented in his de&s;ign, was obliged to
&s;ubmit, and to de&s;ire a reconciliation with his brother.</P>
<P>THE mild and moderate temper of Somer&s;et made him
willing to forget the&s;e enterprizes of the admiral; but
the ambition of that turbulent &s;pirit could not be &s;o
ea&s;ily appea&s;ed. His &s;pou&s;e, the Queen-dowager, died
in child-bed; but &s;o far from regarding this event as a
check to his a&s;piring views, he founded on it the &s;cheme
of a more extraordinary elevation. He made his addre&s;&s;es
to the lady Elizabeth, then in the &s;ixteenth year of her
age; and that prince&s;s, whom even the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s,
and the pur&s;uits of ambition, could not, in her more ad|vanced
years, di&s;engage entirely from the tender pa&s;&s;ions,
&s;eems to have li&s;tened to the in&s;inuations of a man who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every talent proper to captivate the affections of
the fair<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 95, 96, 102, 108.</NOTE>. But as Henry the eighth had excluded his
daughters from all hopes of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, if they married
without the con&s;ent of his executors, which Seymour
could never hope to attain; it was concluded, that he
propo&s;ed to effectuate his purpo&s;e by expedients &s;till more
ra&s;h and more criminal. All the other mea&s;ures of the
admiral tended to confirm this &s;u&s;picion. He continued
to attack, by pre&s;ents, the fidelity of all tho&s;e who had
more immediate acce&s;s to the King's per&s;on: He endea|voured
to feduce that young prince into his intere&s;ts:
He found means of holding a private corre&s;pondence
with him: He openly decried his brother's admini&s;tration;
and a&s;&s;erted, that by enli&s;ting Germans, and other
foreigners, he intended to form a mercenary army, which
endangered the King's authority, and the liberty of the
people: By promi&s;es and per&s;ua&s;ion he brought over to
his party many of the principal nobility; and had di&s;tri|buted
<PB N="341" REF="367">
his intere&s;t all over England: He neglected not
even the mo&s;t popular per&s;ons of inferior rank; and had
computed, that he could, on occa&s;ion, command the &s;er|vice
of ten thou&s;and men, among his &s;ervants, tenants,
and retainers<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Haynes, p. 105, 106.</NOTE>: He had already provided arms for their
u&s;e; and having engaged in his intere&s;ts Sir John Shar|ington,
a very corrupt man, ma&s;ter of the mint at Bri&s;tol,
he flattered him&s;elf that money would not be wanting.
Somer&s;et was well informed of all the&s;e alarming cir|cum&s;tances,
and endeavoured by the mo&s;t friendly expe|dients,
by intreaty, rea&s;on, and even by heaping new
favours upon his brother, to make him depart from his
precipitate councils: But finding all his endeavours inef|fectual,
he began to think of more &s;evere remedies.
The earl of Warwic was an ill in&s;trument between
the brothers; and had formed the de&s;ign, by inflaming
the quarrel, to rai&s;e his own fortune on tie ruins of
both.</P>
<P>DUDLEY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dudley, earl of Warwic.</NOTE> earl of Warwic, was the &s;on of that Dud|ley,
mini&s;ter to Henry the &s;eventh, who having, by ra|pine,
extortion, and perver&s;ion or law, incurred the ha|tred
of the public, had been &s;acrificed to popular animo&s;ity,
in the beginning of the &s;ub&s;equent reign. The late
King, &s;en&s;ible of the iniquity, at lea&s;t illegality of the
&s;entence, had afterwards re&s;tored young Dudley's blood
by act of Parliament; and finding him endowed with
ability, indu&s;try, and enterprize, he had entru&s;ted him
with many important commands, and had ever found him
&s;ucce&s;sful in all his undertakings. He rai&s;ed him to the
dignity of vi&s;count Li&s;le, conferred on him the office of
admiral, and gave him by his will a place among his exe|cutors.
Dudley made &s;till farther progre&s;s during the
minority; and having obtained the title of earl of War|wic,
<PB N="342" REF="368">
and undermined the credit of Southampton, he bore
the fir&s;t rank among the protector's counsellors. The
victory, gained at Pinkey, was much a&s;cribed to his cou|rage
and conduct; and he was univer&s;ally regarded as a
man equally endowed with the talents of peace and war.
But all the&s;e virtues were ob&s;cured by &s;till greater vices;
an exorbitant ambition, an in&s;atiable avarice, a neglect
of decency, a contempt of ju&s;tice: And as he found,
that lord Seymour, who&s;e ability and enterprise he chiefly
dreaded, was involving him&s;elf in ruin, by his ra&s;h coun|cils,
he was determined to pu&s;h him over the precipice;
and thereby remove the chief ob&s;tacle to his own projec|ted
greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN Somer&s;et &s;ound that the public peace was ex|po&s;ed
by his brother's &s;editious, if not rebellious, &s;chemes,
he was the more ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, by Warwic, to employ
the extent of royal authority again&s;t him; and after de|priving
him of the office of admiral, he &s;igned a warrant
for committing him to the Tower. Some of his accom|plices
were al&s;o taken into cu&s;tody; and three privy
coun&s;ellors, being &s;ent to examine them, made a report,
that they had met with very full and important di&s;coveries.
Yet &s;till the protector &s;u&s;pended the blow, and &s;howed a
reluctance to ruin his brother. He offered to depart from
the pro&s;ecution, if Seymour would promi&s;e him a cordial
reconcilement; and relinqui&s;hing all ambitious hopes,
be contented with a private life, and retire into the coun|try.
But as Seymour made no other an&s;wer to the&s;e
friendly offers than menaces and defiances, he ordered a
charge to be drawn up again&s;t him, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty|three
articles<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Coll. 31. 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 18.</NOTE>; and the whole to be laid before the privy-council.
It is pretended, that every particular was &s;o
inconte&s;tibly proved, both by witne&s;&s;es and his own hand|writing,
<PB N="343" REF="369">
that there was no room for doubt; yet did the
council think proper to go in a body to the Tower, in
order more fully to examine the pri&s;oner. He was not
daunted by the appearance; but boldly demanded a fair
trial; required to be confronted with the witne&s;&s;es;
de&s;ired that the charge might be left with him, in order
to be con&s;idered; and refu&s;ed to an&s;wer any interroga|tories,
by which he might en&s;nare him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is apparent, that notwith&s;tanding what is pretend|ed,
there mu&s;t have been &s;ome deficiency in the evidence
again&s;t Seymour, when &s;uch demands, founded on the
plaine&s;t principles of law and equity, were ab&s;olutely re|jected.
We &s;hall indeed conclude, if we carefully exa|mine
the charge, that many of the articles were general,
and &s;carce capable of any proof; many of them, if true,
&s;u&s;ceptible of a mere favourable interpretation; and that,
tho' on the whole, Seymour appears to have been a very
dangerous &s;ubject, yet he had not advanced far in tho&s;e
trea&s;onable projects imputed to him. The chief part of
his guilt &s;eems to have con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome unwarrantable
practices in the admiralty, by which pyrates were pro|tected,
and illegal impo&s;itions laid upon the merchants.</P>
<P>BUT the admini&s;tration had, at that time, an ea&s;y in|&s;trument
of vengeance, to wit, the Parliament; and
needed not to give them&s;elves any concern with regard
either to the guilt of the per&s;ons whom they pro&s;ecuted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE>
or the evidence which could be produced again&s;t them.
A &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament being held,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th No|vember.</NOTE> it was propo&s;ed to
proceed again&s;t Seymour by bill of attainder; and much
per&s;ua&s;ion being employed to engage the young King to
con&s;ent to it, a con&s;iderable weight was put on his ap|probation.
The matter was fir&s;t laid before the upper
hou&s;e; and &s;everal peers, ri&s;ing up in their places, gave
an account of what they knew concerning lord Seymour's
<PB N="344" REF="370">
conduct, and his criminal words or actions. The&s;e nar|ratives
were received for undoubted evidence; and tho'
the pri&s;oner had formerly engaged many friends and par|tizans
among the nobility,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1549.</NOTE> no one had either the courage
or equity to move,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attainder of Lord Seymour.</NOTE> that he might be heard in his own
defence, that the testimony again&s;t him &s;hould be deli|vered
in a legal manner, and that he &s;hould be confronted
with the witne&s;&s;es. A little more &s;cruple was made in
the hou&s;e of commons: There were even &s;ome members
who objected again&s;t the whole method of proceeding by
bills of attainder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20 March.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed in ab&s;ence; and required, that
a formal trial &s;hould be given to every man before his
condemnation. But upon receiving a me&s;&s;age from the
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu|tion.</NOTE> requiring them to proceed, and offering that the
&s;ame narratives &s;hould be laid before them which had
&s;atisfied the peers, they were ea&s;ily prevailed on to ac|quie&s;ce<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 18.</NOTE>. The bill pa&s;&s;ed in a very full hou&s;e. Near four
hundred voted for it; and not above nine or ten again&s;t
it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 99.</NOTE>. The &s;entence was &s;oon after executed, and the
pri&s;oner was beheaded on Tower-hill. The warrant was
&s;igned by Somer&s;et, who was expo&s;ed to much blame, on
account of the violence of the&s;e proceedings. The at|tempts
of the admiral &s;eemed chiefly to be levelled again&s;t
his brother's u&s;urped authority; and tho' his ambitious,
enterprizing character, encouraged by a marriage with
the lady Elizabeth, might have proved dangerous to pub|lic
tranquillity, the prudence of fore&s;eeing dangers at &s;uch
a di&s;tance, was deemed too great, and the remedy was
plainly illegal. It could only be &s;aid, that this bill of
attainder was &s;omewhat more tolerable than the preceding
ones, to which the nation had beer accu&s;tomed. For
here, at lea&s;t, &s;ome &s;hadow of evidence was produced.</P>
<P>ALL the other Con&s;iderable bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted this &s;e&s;|&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal affairs.</NOTE>
be&s;ides the attainder of lord Seymour, regarded
<PB N="345" REF="371">
eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters; which were now the chief concern
of the nation. A committee of bi&s;hops and divines had
been appointed by the council, to frame a liturgy for the
&s;ervice of the church; and they had executed the work
committed to them. They proceeded with great mode|ration
in this delicate undertaking: They retained as
much of the ancient ma&s;s as the principles of the re|formers
would permit: They indulged nothing to the
&s;pirit of contradiction, which &s;o naturally takes place
in all great innovations: And they flattered them&s;elves,
that they had framed a &s;ervice, in which every denomi|nation
of Chri&s;tians might, without &s;cruple, concur.
The ma&s;s had been always celebrated in Latin; a prac|tice
which might have been deemed ab&s;urd, had it not
been found u&s;eful to the clergy, by impre&s;&s;ing the people
with an idea of &s;ome my&s;terious unknown virtue in tho&s;e
rites, and by checking all their preten&s;ions to be familiarly
acquainted with their religion. But as the reformers
pretended in &s;ome few particulars to encourage private
judgment in the laity, the translation of the liturgy, as
well as of the Scriptures, into the vulgar tongue, &s;eemed
more conformable to the genius of their &s;ect; and this
innovation, with the retrenchment of prayers to &s;aints,
and of &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies, was the chief dif|ference
between the old ma&s;s and the new liturgy. The
Parliament e&s;tabli&s;hed this form of wor&s;hip in all the
churches, and ordered an uniformity to be ob&s;erved in all
the rites and ceremonies<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was another very material act, which pa&s;&s;ed
this &s;e&s;&s;ion. The former canons had e&s;tabli&s;hed the ce|libacy
of the clergy; and though this practice be u&s;ually
a&s;cribed to the policy of the court of Rome, who thought,
that the eccle&s;ia&s;tics would be more devoted to their &s;piri|tual

head, and le&s;s dependant on the civil magi&s;trate,
when freed from the powerful tyes of wives and children;
yet was this in&s;titution much forwarded by the principles
of &s;uper&s;tition inherent in human nature. The&s;e princi|ples
had rendered the panegyrics of an inviolate cha&s;tity
&s;o frequent among the ancient fathers, long before the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of celibacy. And even the Engli&s;h parlia|ment,
though they framed a law, permitting the marriages of
prie&s;ts, yet confe&s;s, in the preamble, &startq;that it were
better for prie&s;ts and the mini&s;ters of the church to
live cha&s;te and without marriage, and it were much
to be wi&s;hed they would of them&s;elves ab&s;tain.&endq; The
inconveniences, which had ari&s;en from compelling cha&s;|tity
and prohibiting marriage, are the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for
indulging a liberty in this particular<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 21.</NOTE>. The ideas of pen|nance
al&s;o were &s;o much retained in other particulars,
that an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed, prohibiting the u&s;e of
fle&s;h-meat, during Lent and the other times of ab&s;ti|nence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><P>2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 19.</P>
<P>Another act, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, takes notice in the preamble, that the city of York, formerly well inhabited, was now much decayed: In&s;o|much that many of the cures could not afford a competent maintenance to the incumbents. To remedy this inconvenience, the magi&s;trates were impowered to unite as many pari&s;hes as they thought proper. An eccle|&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torian. Collier, vol. ii. p. 230, thinks that this decay of York is chiefly to be a&s;cribed to the di&s;&s;olution of mona&s;teries, by which the revenues &s;ell into the hands of per&s;ons who lived at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>A very grievous tax was impo&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion upon the whole &s;tock and monied intere&s;t of the kingdom, and even upon its indu&s;try. It was a &s;hilling in the pound yearly, during three years, on every per&s;on worth ten pounds or upwards: The double on aliens and denizens. The&s;e la&s;t, if above twelve years of age, and if worth le&s;s than twenty Shil|lings, were to pay eight pence yearly. Every wether was to pay two pence yearly; every ewe three pence. The woolen manufactures were to pay eight pence a pound on the value of all the cloth they made.</P>
<P>The&s;e exorbitant taxes on money are a proof, that few people lived on the money lent out at intere&s;t: For this tax amounts to the half of the yearly income of all money-holders, during three years, e&s;timating their intere&s;t at the rate allowed by law; and was too grievous to be borne, if many per&s;ons had been affected by it. It is remarkable, that no tax at all was laid upon land this &s;e&s;&s;ion. The profits of merchandi&s;e were commonly &s;o high, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed it could bear this impo&s;ition. The mo&s;t ab&s;urd part of the law &s;eems to be the tax upon the woolen manufacture. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 36. The &s;ub&s;equent Parlia|ment repealed the tax on &s;heep and woolen cloth. 3 &amp; 4 Edw. VI. cap. 23. But they continued the other tax a year longer. Ibid.</P>
<P>The clergy taxed them&s;elves at &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound to be paid in three years. This taxation was ratified in Parliament, which had been the common practice &s;ince the reformation, as if the clergy had no legislative power, even over them&s;elves. See 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 35.</P></NOTE>.</P>

THE principal tenets and practices of the catholic re|ligion
were now aboli&s;hed, and the reformation, &s;uch as
we enjoy it at pre&s;ent, was almo&s;t entirely compleated
in England. But the doctrine of the real pre&s;ence, tho'
tacitly condemned by the new communion-&s;ervice and
by the prohibition of many antient rites, &s;till retained
&s;ome hold of the minds of men; and it was the la&s;t doc|trine
of popery, which was wholly abandoned by the
people<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. cap. 104.</NOTE>. The extreme attachment of the late King to
that tenet might be &s;ome ground for this ob&s;tinacy; but
the chief cau&s;e was really the extreme ab&s;urdity of the
principle it&s;elf, and the profound veneration, which of
cour&s;e is impre&s;&s;ed on the mind. The prie&s;ts likewi&s;e
were much inclined to favour an opinion, which attributed
to them &s;o miraculous a power; and the people, who be|lieved
that they participated of the very body and blood
of their Saviour, were loth to renounce &s;o extraordinary,
and as they imagined, &s;o &s;alutary a privilege. The gene|ral
attachment to this dogma was &s;o violent, that the
Lutherans, notwith&s;tanding their &s;eparation from Rome,
<PB N="348" REF="376">
had thought proper, under another name, &s;till to retain
it: And the catholic preachers, in England, when re|&s;trained
in every other particular, could not forbear, on
every occa&s;ion, from inculcating that tenet. Bonner,
for this offence among others, had been tried by the
council, had been deprived of his &s;ee, and had been com|mitted
to cu&s;tody. Gardiner al&s;o, who had recovered
his liberty, appeared anew refractory to the authority,
which e&s;tabli&s;hed the late innovations; and he &s;eemed
willing to countenance that opinion, much favoured by
all the Engli&s;h catholics, that the King was indeed &s;u|preme
head of the church, but not the council, during a
minority. Having declined giving full &s;atisfaction on
this head, be was &s;ent to the Tower, and threatened with
farther effects of the council's di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THESE &s;everities, being exerci&s;ed again&s;t men, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
of office and authority, &s;eemed a nece&s;&s;ary policy,
in order to enforce an uniformity in public wor&s;hip and
di&s;cipline: But there were other in&s;tances of per&s;ecution,
which were derived from no other origin than the bigotry
of theologians; a malady, which &s;eems almo&s;t incurable.
Though the prote&s;tant divines had ventured to renounce
opinions, deemed certain during &s;o many centuries, they
regarded in their turn, the new &s;y&s;tem as &s;o certain,
that they could bear no contradiction with regard to it;
and they were ready to burn in the &s;ame flames, from
which they them&s;elves had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped, every
one who had the a&s;&s;urance to oppo&s;e them. A commi&s;|&s;ion
by act of council was granted to the primate and
&s;ome others, to examine and &s;earch after all anabapti&s;ts,
heretics, or contemners of the book of common prayer<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 3. Rymer, tom. xv. p. 181.</NOTE>.
They were enjoined to reclaim them, if po&s;&s;ible; to im|po&s;e
penance on them; and to give them ab&s;olution: Or
<PB N="349" REF="377">
if they were ob&s;tinate, to excommunicate and impri&s;on
them, and to deliver them over to the &s;ecular arm; And in
the execution of this charge, the commi&s;&s;ioners were not
bound to ob&s;erve the ordinary methods of trial; the
forms of law were di&s;pen&s;ed with, and if any &s;tatutes hap|pened
to interfere with the powers in the commi&s;&s;ion,
they were over-ruled and abrogated by the council.
Some trade&s;men in London were brought before the&s;e
commi&s;&s;ioners, and were accu&s;ed of maintaining, among
other opinions, that a man regenerate could not &s;in,
and that though the outward man might offend, the
inward was incapable of all guilt. They were prevailed
on to abjure and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. But there was a woman
accu&s;ed of heretical pravity, called Joan Bocher, or Joan
of Kent, who was &s;o extremely ob&s;tinate, that the com|mi&s;&s;ioners
could gain nothing upon her. Her doctrine
was, &startq;That Chri&s;t was not truly incarnate of the vir|gin,
who&s;e fle&s;h, being the outward man, was &s;infully
begotten and born in &s;in; and con&s;equen$ly; he could
take none of it: But the word, by the con&s;ent of the
inward man of the virgin, was made fle&s;h<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. coll, 35. Strype's Mem. Cranm. p. 181.</NOTE>.&endq; This
opinion, it would &s;eem, is not orthodox; and there was
a nece&s;&s;ity for delivering the woman to the flames for
maintaining it. But the young King, though in &s;uch
tender years, had more &s;en&s;e than all his coun&s;ellors and
preceptors; and he long refu&s;ed to &s;ign the warrant for
her execution. Cranmer was employed to per&s;uade him
to compliance; and he &s;aid, that there was a great dif|ference
between errors in other points of divinity, and
tho&s;e which were directly contradictory to the Apo&s;tles
creed; The&s;e latter were impieties again&s;t God, which
the prince, being God's deputy, ought to repre&s;s; in like
manner, as the King's deputies were bound to puni&s;h
<PB N="350" REF="378">
offences again&s;t the King's per&s;on. Edward, overcome
by importunity more than rea&s;on, at la&s;t &s;ubmitted, tho'
with tears in his eyes; and he told Cranmer, that, if
any wrong was done, the guilt &s;hould lie entirely on his
head. The primate, after making a new effort to re|claim
the woman from her errors, and. finding her ob&s;ti|nate
again&s;t all his arguments, at la&s;t committed her to
the flames. Some time after, a Dutchman, called Van
Paris, accu&s;ed of the here&s;y which has received the name
of Ariani&s;m, was condemned to the &s;ame puni&s;hment.
He &s;uffered with &s;o much &s;atisfaction, that he hugged
and care&s;&s;ed the faggots, which were con&s;uming him; a
&s;pecies of frenzy of which there is more than one in&s;tance
among the martyrs of this age<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 112. Strype's Mem. Cranm. p. 181.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE rigorous methods of proceeding &s;oon brought
the whole nation to a conformity with the new doctrine
and the new liturgy. The lady Mary alone continued
to adhere to the ma&s;s, and refu&s;ed to admit the e&s;tabli&s;hed
modes of wor&s;hip. When pre&s;&s;ed and menaced on this
head, &s;he applied to the Emperor; who, u&s;ing his in|tere&s;t

&s;low effect of time, and is &s;eldom perceived by the bulk
of a nation. Scarce any in&s;titution can be imagined le&s;s
favourable, in the main, to the intere&s;ts of mankind than
that of monks and friars; yet was it followed by many
good effects, which, having cea&s;ed by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of
mona&s;teries, were very much regretted by the people of
England. The monks, re&s;iding always in their con|vents,
in the heart of their e&s;tates, &s;pent their money in
the provinces and among their tenants, afforded a ready
market for commodities, were a &s;ure re&s;ource to the poor
and indigent and though their ho&s;pitality and charity
gave but too much encouragement to idlene&s;s, and pre|vented
the encrea&s;e of public riches, yet did it provide to
many a remedy again&s;t the extreme pre&s;&s;ures of want
<PB N="352" REF="380">
and nece&s;&s;ity. It is al&s;o ob&s;ervable, t$$ as the friar
were limited, by the rules of their in&s;titution, to a certain
train of life, they had not equal motives for avarice with
other men; and they were acknowledged to have been
in England, as they &s;till are in Roman catholic coun|tries,
the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent landlords. The ab|bots
and priors were allowed to give lea&s;es at an under|value,
and to receive, in return, a large pre&s;ent from the
tenant; in the &s;ame manner as is &s;till practi&s;ed by the
bi&s;hops and colleges. But when the abbey-lands were
di&s;tributed among the great nobility and courtiers, they
fell under a different management: The rents of farms
were rai&s;ed, while the tenants found not the &s;ame faci|lity
in di&s;po&s;ing of the produce; the money was &s;pent in
the capital; and the farmers, living at a di&s;tance, were
expo&s;ed to all the oppre&s;&s;ions of their new ma&s;ters, or to
the &s;till greater rapacity of the &s;tewards.</P>
<P>THESE complaints of the common people were at that
time heightened by other cau&s;es. The arts of manufac|ture
were much more advanced in other European coun|tries
than in England; and even in England the&s;e arts
had made greater progre&s;s than the knowledge of agri|culture;
a profe&s;&s;ion, which of all mechanical employ|ments,
requires the mo&s;t reflection and experience. A
great demand aro&s;e for wool both abroad and at home:
Pa&s;turage was found more profitable than un&s;kilful til|lage:
Whole e&s;tates were laid wa&s;te by inclo&s;ures: The
tenants, regarded as a u&s;ele&s;s burthen, were expelled
their habitations: Even the cottagers, deprived of the
commons, on which they formerly $ed their cattle, were
reduced to mi&s;ery: And a great decay of people, as well
as diminution of the former plenty, was remarked in the
kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii. Repo&s;itory O.</NOTE>. This grievance was now of an old date;
<PB N="353" REF="381">
and Sir Thomas More, alluding to it, ob&s;erves in his
Utopia, that a &s;heep had become in England a more ra|venous
animal than a lion or wolf, and devoured whole
villages, cities, and provinces.</P>
<P>THE general encrea&s;e al&s;o of gold and &s;ilver in Europe,
after the di&s;covery of the We&s;t Indies, had a tendency to
inflame the&s;e complaints. The growing demand, in the
more commercial countries, had heightened every where
the price of commodities, which could ea&s;ily be tran|&s;ported
thither; but in England, the labour of men,
who could not &s;o ea&s;ily change their habitation, &s;till re|mained
nearly at the ancient rates; and the poor people
complained that they could no longer gain a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
by their indu&s;try. It was by an addition alone of toil
and application they were enabled to provide a main|tenance;
and though this encrea&s;e of indu&s;try was at
la&s;t the effect of the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and an effect very
beneficial to &s;ociety, yet was it difficult for the people to
&s;hake off their former habits of indolence; and nothing
but nece&s;&s;ity could compel them to that exertion of their
faculties.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t al&s;o be remarked, that the profu&s;ion of
Henry the eighth, had reduced him, notwith&s;tanding
his rapacity, to &s;uch difficulties that he had been obliged
to remedy a pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, by the pernicious expedient
of deba&s;ing the coin; and the wars, in which the pro|tector
had been involved, had induced him to carry &s;till
farther the &s;ame abu&s;e. The u&s;ual con&s;equences en&s;ued:
The good coin was hoarded or exported; ba&s;e metal was
coined at home or imported from abroad in great abun|dance;
the common people, who received their wages in
it, could not purcha&s;e commodities at the u&s;ual rates;
an univer&s;al diffidence and &s;tagnation of commerce took
<PB N="354" REF="382">
place; and loud complaints were heard in every part
of England.</P>
<P>THE protector, who loved popularity, and compa&s;|&s;ionated
the condition of the people, encouraged the&s;e
complaints by his endeavours to remedy them. He ap|pointed
a commi&s;&s;ion for making enquiry concerning in|clo&s;ures;
and i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, ordering all late in|clo&s;ures
to be laid open by a day a&s;&s;igned. The popu|lace,
meeting with &s;uch countenance from the govern|ment,
began to ri&s;e in &s;everal places, and to commit di&s;|orders;
but were quieted by remon&s;tranees and per&s;ua|&s;ion.
In order to give them greater &s;atisfaction, Somer|&s;et
appointed new commi&s;&s;ioners, whom he &s;ent every
where, with an unlimited power to hear and determine
all cau&s;es about inclo&s;ures, high-ways, and cottages<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 115. Strype, vol. ii. p. 171.</NOTE>.
As the object of this commi&s;&s;ion was very di&s;agreeable to
the gentry and nobility, they called the commi&s;&s;ion ar|bitrary
and illegal; and the common people, fearing it
would be eluded, and being impatient for immediate re|dre&s;s,
could no longer contain their fury, but &s;ought for
a remedy by force of arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tions.</NOTE> The ri&s;ing began at once in
&s;everal parts of England, as if an univer&s;al con&s;piracy
had been formed by the commonalty. The rebels in
Wilt&s;hire were di&s;per&s;ed by Sir William Herbert: Tho&s;e
in the neighbouring counties, Oxford and Gloce&s;ter, by
lord Gray of Wilton. Many of the rioters were killed
in the field: Others were executed by martial law. The
commotions in Hamp&s;hire, Su&s;&s;ex, Kent, and other
counties, were quieted by gentler methods; but he di&s;|orders
in Devon&s;hire and Norfolk threatened the mo&s;t
fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="383">
THE commonalty in Devon&s;hire began with the u&s;ual
pretence of inclo&s;ures and of oppre&s;&s;ions from the gentry;
but the pari&s;h prie&s;t of Sampford-Courtenay, had the ad|dre&s;s
to give their di&s;contents a direction towards reli|gion;
and the delicacy of this &s;ubject, in the pre&s;ent
emergency, made the in&s;urrection immediately appear
dangerous. In other counties, the gentry had kept
clo&s;ely united with the government; but here many of
them took part with the populace; among others, Hum|phrey
Arundel governor of St. Michael's Mount. The
rioters were brought to the form of a regular army, and
amounted to the number of 10,000 men. Lord Ru&s;&s;el
had been &s;ent again&s;t them at the head of a &s;mall force;
but finding him&s;elf too weak to encounter them in the
field, he kept at a di&s;tance, and began to treat and ne|gotiate
with them; in hopes of eluding their fury by de|lay,
and of di&s;per&s;ing them by the difficulty of their &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting
in a body. Their demands were, that the ma&s;s
&s;hould be re&s;tored, half of the abbey-lands re&s;umed,
the law of the &s;ix articles executed, holy water and holy
bread re&s;pected, and all other particular grievances re|dre&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 292. Holling&s;hed, p. 1003. Fox vol ii. p. 666. Mem. Cranm, p. 186.</NOTE>.
The council, to whom Ru&s;&s;el tran&s;mitted
the&s;e demands, &s;ent a haughty an&s;wer; exhorted the re|bels
to di&s;per&s;e; and promi&s;ed them pardon upon their
immediate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; Enraged at this di&s;appointment,
they marched to Exeter; carrying before them cro&s;&s;es,
banners, holy-water, candle&s;ticks, and other implements
of the antient &s;uper&s;tition; together with the ho&s;te,
which they covered with a canopy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 76.</NOTE>. The inhabitants of
Exeter &s;hut their gates; and the rebels, as they had no
cannon, endeavoured to take the place, fir&s;t by &s;calade,
then by mining, but were repul&s;ed in all their attempts.
<PB N="356" REF="384">
Ru&s;&s;el meanwhile lay at Honiton, till reinforced by Sir
William Herbert, and lord Gray, with &s;ome German
hor&s;e, and &s;ome Italian arquebu&s;iers under Batti&s;ta Spi|nola.
He then re&s;olved to attempt the relief of Exeter,
which was now reduced to extremities. He attacked the
rebels, drove them from all their po&s;ts, committed great
&s;laughter upon them both in the action and pur&s;uit<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Stow's Annals, p. 597. Hayward, p. 295.</NOTE>, and
took many pri&s;oners. Arundel and the other leaders
were &s;ent to London, tried and executed. Many of the
inferior &s;ort were put to death by martial law<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 295, 296,</NOTE>: The vi|car

weeds, with his beads at his girdle<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 76. Holling&s;hed, p. 1026.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE in&s;urrection in Norfolk ro&s;e &s;till to a greater
height, and was attended with greater violences. The
populace were at fir&s;t excited, as in other places, by the
complaints again&s;t inclo&s;ures; but finding their num|bers
amount to twenty thou&s;and men, they grew in&s;olent
on their force, and proceeded to more exorbitant preten|&s;ions.
They required the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the gentry,
the placing new coun&s;ellors about the King, and the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the antient rites. One Ket, a tanner,
had a&s;&s;umed the government of them; and he exerci&s;ed
his authority with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence and outrage.
Having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mou&s;hold-Hill near Norwich,
he erected his tribunal under an old oak, thence called
the oak of reformation; and &s;ummoning the gentry to
appear before him, he gave &s;uch decrees as might be ex|pected
from his character and &s;ituation. The marquis
of Northampton was fir&s;t ordered again&s;t him; but met
with a repul&s;e, in an action, where lord Sheffield was
<PB N="357" REF="385">
killed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 597. Holling&s;hed, p. 1030&mdash;-34. Strype, vol. ii. p. 174.</NOTE>. The protector affected popularity, and cared
not to appear in per&s;on again&s;t the rebels; He therefore
&s;ent next the earl of Warwic at the head of 6000 men,
levied for the wars again&s;t Scotland; and he thereby
afforded his mortal enemy an opportunity of augmenting
his reputation and character. Warwic, haying tried
&s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes with the rebels, at la&s;t made a general
attack upon them, and put them to flight. Two thou|&s;and
of them fell in the fight and pur&s;uit: Ket was
hanged at Norwich ca&s;tle; nine of his followers on the
boughs of the oak of reformation; and the in&s;urrection
was entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Some rebels in York&s;hire, hear|ing
of the fate of their companions, accepted the offers
of pardon, and threw down their arms, A general in|demnity
was &s;oon after publi&s;hed by the protector<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 297, 298, 299.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though the in&s;urrections were thus quickly &s;ub|dued
in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the war with Scot|land.</NOTE> and no traces of them &s;eemed to re|main,
they were attended with very bad con&s;equences
with regard to the foreign intere&s;ts of the nation. The
forces of the earl of Warwic, which might have made a
great impre&s;&s;ion on Scotland, were diverted from that
enterprize; and De Thermes had lei&s;ure to reduce that
country to &s;ome &s;ettlement and compo&s;ure. He took the
fortre&s;s of Broughty, and put the garri&s;on to the &s;word.
He &s;traitened the Engli&s;h at Haddington; and though
lord Dacres found means to throw relief into the place,
and to reinforce the garri&s;on, it was experienced to be
very chargeable, and even impracticable to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that fortre&s;s. The Whole country in the neighbour|hood
was laid wa&s;te by the inroads both of the Scots and
Engli&s;h, and could afford no &s;upply to the garri&s;on:
The place lay above thirty miles from the borders; &s;o
<PB N="358" REF="386">
that a regular army was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;cort thither any
provi&s;ions: And as the plague had broke out among the
troops, they peri&s;hed daily, and were reduced to a &s;tate
of great weakne&s;s. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, orders were gi|ven
to di&s;mantle Haddington, and to convoy the artil|lery
and garri&s;on to Berwic; and the earl of Rutland,
now created warden of the ea&s;t marches, executed the
orders.</P>

di&s;tractions of the Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With France.</NOTE> in order to recover Boulogne,
and that territory, which Henry the eighth had con|quered

was repul&s;ed; but the garri&s;on, not thinking the place
tenable after the lo&s;s of the other fortre&s;&s;es, de&s;troyed the
works, and retired to Boulogne. The rains, which fell
in great abundance during the autumn, and a pe&s;tilential
di&s;temper, which broke out in the French camp, de|prived
Henry of all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t Boulogne it|&s;elf;
and he retired to Paris<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 300.</NOTE>. He left the command
of the army to Ga&s;par de Coligny, lord of Chatillon, &s;o
famous afterwards under the name of admiral Coligny;
and he gave him orders to form the &s;iege early in the
&s;pring. The active di&s;po&s;ition of this general engaged
him to make, during the winter, &s;everal attempts again&s;t
the place; but they proved all un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>

of the two nations differ &s;o widely in their accounts
of the event<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Thuan. King Edward's Journal, Stowe, p. 597.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the French war broke out, the protector
endeavoured to fortify him&s;elf with the alliance of the
emperor; and he &s;ent over &s;ecretary Paget to Bru&s;&s;els,
where Charles then re&s;ided, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t Sir Philip
Hobby, the ordinary amba&s;&s;ador, in this negotiation.
But that prince had formed a de&s;ign of extending his do|minions
by acting the part of champion for the catholic
religion; and though extremely de&s;irous of fortifying
him&s;elf by the Engli&s;h alliance again&s;t France, his capi|tal
enemy, he thought it un&s;uitable to his other preten|&s;ions
to enter into &s;trict confederacy with a nation, which
had broke off all connexions with the church of Rome.
He therefore declined all advances of friend&s;hip from
England; and eluded the applications of the amba&s;&s;a|dors.
An exact account is pre&s;erved of this negotiation
in a letter of Hobby; and it is remarkable, that the em|peror,
in a conver&s;ation with the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, a&s;|&s;erted,
that the prerogatives of a King of England were
more exten&s;ive than tho&s;e of a King of France<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 132, 175.</NOTE>. Bur|net,
who pre&s;erves this letter, &s;ubjoins, as a parallel in|&s;tance,
that one objection which the Scots made to mar|rying
their Queen with Edward, was that all their pri|vileges
would be fwallowed up by the great prerogative
of the Kings of England<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 133.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOMERSET, finding no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the emperor,
was inclined to conclude a peace with France and Scot|land;
and be&s;ides that he was not in a condition to
maintain &s;uch ruinous wars, he thought, that there no
<PB N="360" REF="388">
longer remained any object of ho&s;tilities. The Scots had
&s;ent away their Queen; and could not, if ever &s;o much
inclined, compleat the marriage contracted with Ed|ward:
And as Henry the eighth had &s;tipulated to re&s;tore
Boulogne in 1554, it &s;eemed a matter of &s;mall con&s;e|quence
to anticipate a few years, the term of the treaty.
But when he propo&s;ed the&s;e rea&s;ons to the council, he
met with &s;trong oppo&s;ition from his enemies, who, &s;ee|ing
him unable to &s;upport the war, were determined, for
that very rea&s;on, to oppo&s;e all propo&s;als for a pacifica|tion.
The factions ran very high in the court of Eng|land;
and matters were drawing to an i&s;&s;ue, fatal to the
authority of the protector.</P>
<P>AFTER Somer&s;et obtained the patent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Factions in the council.</NOTE> inve&s;ting him
with regal authority, he no longer paid any attention to
the opinion of the other coun&s;ellors; and being elated
with his high dignity, as well as with his victory at
Pinkey, he thought, that every one ought, in every
thing, to yield to his &s;entiments. All tho&s;e who were
not entirely devoted to him, were &s;ure to be neglected;
whoever oppo&s;ed his will received marks of anger or con|tempt<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii. p. 181.</NOTE>;
and while he &s;hewed a resolution to govern
every thing, his capacity appeared not, in any re&s;pect,
proportioned to his ambition. Warwic, more &s;ubtle and
artful, covered more exorbitant views under fairer ap|pearances;
and having a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with Southamp|ton,
who had been readmitted into the council, he
formed a &s;trong party, who were determined to free them|&s;elves
from the &s;lavery, impo&s;ed on them by the pro|tector.</P>
<P>THE malecontent coun&s;ellors found the di&s;po&s;ition of
the nation very favourable to their de&s;igns. The nobi|lity
<PB N="361" REF="389">
and gentry were in general di&s;plea&s;ed with, the pre|ference,
which Somer&s;et &s;eemed to have given the peo|ple;
and as they a&s;cribed all the in&s;ults to which they
had been lately expo&s;ed, to his procra&s;tination, and to
the encouragement given the multitude, &s;o they appre|hended
a renewal of the &s;ame di&s;orders from his pre&s;ent
affectation of popularity. He had erected a court of re|que&s;ts
in his own hou&s;e for the relief of the people<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii, p. 183.</NOTE>,
and he interpo&s;ed with the judges in their behalf; a
mea&s;ure which might be denominated illegal, if any ex|ertion
of prerogative at that time, could with certainty
de&s;erve that appellation. And this attempt, which was
a &s;tretch of power, &s;eemed the more unpolitic, becau&s;e it
di&s;gu&s;ted the nobility, the &s;ure&s;t &s;upport of monarchical
authority.</P>
<P>BUT though Somer&s;et courted the people, the intere&s;t
which he had formed with them, was in no degree an|&s;werable
to his expectations. The catholic party, who
retained influence with the multitude, were his declared
enemies; and took advantage of every opportunity to de|cry
his conduct. The attainder and execution of his
brother bore an odious a&s;pect: The introduction of fo|reign
troops into the kingdom, was repre&s;ented in very
invidious colours: The great e&s;tate which he had &s;ud|denly
acquired, at the expence of the church and of the
crown, rendered him obnoxious: And the palace which
he was building in the Strand, &s;erved by its magnifi|cence,
and &s;till more by other circum&s;tances which at|tended
it, to expo&s;e him to the cen&s;ures of the public.
The pari&s;h church of St. Mary, with three bi&s;hops
hou&s;es, were pulled down, to furni&s;h ground and mate|rials
for this &s;tructure: Not contented with that &s;acri|lege,
an attempt was made to demoli&s;h St. Margaret's,
<PB N="362" REF="390">
We&s;tmin&s;ter, and to employ the &s;tones to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e;
but the pari&s;hioners ro&s;e in a tumult, and chaced
away the protector's tradesmen. He then laid his hands
on a chapel in St. Paul's Church-yard, with a cloi&s;ter,
and charnel-hou&s;e belonging to it; and the&s;e edifices,
together with a church of St. John of Jeru&s;alem, were
made u&s;e of to rai&s;e his palace. What rendered the
matter more odious to the people, was that the tombs,
and other monuments of the dead were defaced; and
the bones carried away, and buried in uncon&s;ecrated
ground<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 72, 73. Stowe's Survey of London. Hayward, p. 303.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e imprudences were remarked by Somer&s;et's
enemies, who re&s;olved to take advantage of them. The
lord St. John,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Octo|ber.</NOTE> pre&s;ident of the council, the earls of
Warwic, Southampton, and Arundel, with five coun|&s;ellors
more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;piracy again&s;t So|mer&s;et.</NOTE> met at Ely-hou&s;e; and a&s;&s;uming to them|&s;elves
the whole power of the council, began to act in|dependent
of the protector, whom they repre&s;ented as the
author of every public grievance and misfortune. They
wrote letters to the chief nobility and gentry in England,
informing them of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, and requiring
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance: They &s;ent for the mayor and aldermen
of London, and enjoined them to obey their orders,
without regard to any contrary orders which they &s;hould
receive from the duke of Somer&s;et. They laid the &s;ame
injunctions on the lieutenant of the tower, who expre&s;&s;ed
his re&s;olution to comply with them. Next day, Rich,
lord chancellor, the marquis of Northampton, the earl
of Shrew&s;bury, Sir Thomas Cheney, Sir John Gage,
Sir Ralph Sadler, and the lord chief ju&s;tice Montague,
joined the malecontent coun&s;ellors; and every thing bore
a bad a&s;pect for the protector's authority. Secretary
<PB N="363" REF="391">
Petre, whom he had &s;ent to treat with the council,
cho&s;e rather to remain, with them; and the common
council of the city, being applied to, declared with one
voice their approbation of the new mea&s;ures, and their
re&s;olution of &s;upporting them<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 597, 598. Hollin&s;hed, p, 1057.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE protector had no &s;ooner heard of the defection of
the coun&s;ellors, than he removed the King from Hamp|ton-court,
where he then re&s;ided, to the ca&s;tle of
Wind&s;or; and, arming his friends and &s;ervants, &s;eemed
re&s;olute to defend him&s;elf again&s;t all his enemies. But
finding, that no man of rank, except Cranmer and Pa|get,
adhered to him, that the people did not ri&s;e at his
&s;ummons, that the City and Tower had declared again&s;t
him, that even his be&s;t friends and confidents had de|&s;erted
him, he lo&s;t all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and began to ap|ply
to his enemies for pardon and forgivene&s;s. No &s;oon|er
was this de&s;pondency known, than lord Ru&s;&s;el, Sir
John Baker, &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons, and
three coun&s;ellors more, who had hitherto remained neu|ters,
joined Warwic's party, whom every body now re|garded
as ma&s;ters. The council informed the public,
by proclamation, of their actions and intentions; they
wrote to the prince&s;&s;es Mary and Elizabeth, to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e; they made addre&s;&s;es to the King, in which, af|ter
the humble&s;t prote&s;tations of duty and obedience,
they informed him, that they were the council appointed
by his father, for the government of the kingdom during
his minority; that they had cho&s;en the duke of Somer|&s;et
protector, with the expre&s;s condition that he &s;hould
guide him&s;elf by their advice and direction; that he had
u&s;urped the whole authority to him&s;elf, and had ne|glected,
and even in every thing oppo&s;ed, their advice;
that he had proceeded to that height of pre&s;umption, as
<PB N="364" REF="392">
to levy forces again&s;t them, and place the&s;e forces a|bout
his maje&s;ty's per&s;on: They therefore begged that
they might be admitted to his royal pre&s;ence that he
would be plea&s;ed to re&s;tore them to his confidence,
and that Somer&s;et's &s;ervants might be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Their
reque&s;t was complied with: Somer&s;et capitulated only
for gentle treatment, which was promi&s;ed him. He
was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somer&s;et re&s;igns the protector|&s;hip.</NOTE> however, &s;ent to the Tower<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 600.</NOTE>, with &s;ome of his
friends and partizans, among whom was Cecil, who was
afterwards &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed. Articles of charge
were exhibited again&s;t him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. book i. coll. 46. Hay|ward, p. 308. Stowe, p. 601. Holling&s;hed, p. 1059.</NOTE>; of which the chief, at
lea&s;t the be&s;t founded, is his u&s;urpation of the govern|ment,
and his taking into his own hands the whole ad|mini&s;tration of affairs. The clau&s;e of his patent, which
inve&s;ted him with ab&s;olute power, unlimited by any law,
was never objected to him; plainly, becau&s;e, according
to the &s;entiments of tho&s;e times, that power was, in
&s;ome degree involved in the very idea of regal autho|rity.</P>
<P>THE catholics were extremely elevated with this revo|lution;
and as they had a&s;cribed all the late innovations
to Somer&s;et's councils, they hoped, that his fall would
prepare the way for the return of the antient religion.
But Warwic, who now bore chief &s;way in the council,
was entirely indifferent with regard to all the&s;e points
of controver&s;y; and finding, that the principles of the
reformation had &s;unk deeper into the young prince's
mind than to be ea&s;ily eradicated, he was determined to
comply with his inclinations, and not to hazard his new
acquired power by any dangerous councils. He took
care very early to expre&s;s his intentions of &s;upporting the
reformation; and he threw &s;uch di&s;couragements on
<PB N="365" REF="393">
Southampton, who &s;tood at the head of the Romani&s;ts,
and whom he con&s;idered as a dangerous rival, that the
high-&s;pirited nobleman retired from the council, and &s;oon
after died of vexation and di&s;appointment. The other
coun&s;ellors, who had concurred in bringing about the
revolution, received their reward by promotions and new
honours. Ru&s;&s;el was created earl of Bedford: The
marquis of Northampton obtained the office of great
chamberlain; and lord Wentworth, be&s;ides the office of
chamberlain of the hou&s;hold, got two large manors,
Stepney and Hackney, which were torne from the &s;ee
of London<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 85. Rymer, tom. xv. p. 226.</NOTE>. A council of regency was formed, not
that which Henry's will had appointed for the govern|ment
of the kingdom, and which, being founded on an
act of Parliament, was the only legal one; but compo&s;ed
chiefly of members who had formerly been appointed by
Somer&s;et, and who derived their &s;eats from an authority
which was now declared u&s;urped and illegal. But &s;uch
niceties were, during that age, little under&s;tood, and
&s;till le&s;s regarded, in England.</P>
<P>A SESSION of Parliament was held;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th No|vember. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> and as it was
the u&s;ual maxim of that a&s;&s;embly to acquie&s;ce in every
admini&s;tration which was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the council dreaded
no oppo&s;ition from that quarter, and had rea&s;on rather to
look for a corroboration of their authority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d De|cember.</NOTE> Somer&s;et
had been prevailed with to confe&s;s, on his knees, before
the council, all the articles of charge again&s;t him; and
he imputed the&s;e mi&s;demeanors to his own ra&s;hne&s;s, folly,
and indi&s;cretion, not to any malignity of his intentions<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 84. Hayward, p. 309. Stowe, p. 603.</NOTE>.
He even &s;ub&s;cribed this confe&s;&s;ion; and the paper was
given in to the Parliament, who, after &s;ending a com|mittee
to examine him, and hear him acknowlege it to
<PB N="366" REF="394">
be authentic, pa&s;&s;ed a vote, by which they deprived him
of all his offices, and fined him in two thou&s;and pounds
a year of land. Lord St. John was created trea&s;urer in
his place, and Warwic earl mar&s;hal. The pro&s;ecution
again&s;t him was carried no farther. His fine was re|mitted
by the King: He recovered his liberty: And
Warwic, thinking that he was now &s;ufficiently humbled,
and that his authority was much le&s;&s;ened by his late tame
and abject behaviour, re-admitted him into the council,
and even agreed to an alliance between their families, by
the marriage of his &s;on, lord Dudley, with the lady Jane
Seymour, daughter to Somer&s;et<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 309.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this &s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;evere act was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t
riots<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">3 &amp; 4. Edw. VI. c. 5.</NOTE>; that if any, to the number of twelve per&s;ons,
&s;hould meet together for any matter of &s;tate, and being
required by any lawful magistrate, &s;hould not di&s;per&s;e
them&s;elves, it &s;hould be trea&s;on; and if any broke
hedges, or violently pulled up pales about inclo&s;ures,
without lawful authority, it &s;hould be felony: Any at|tempt
to kill a privy coun&s;ellor, was &s;ubjected to the
&s;ame penalty. The bi&s;hops had made an application,
complaining, that they were deprived of all their power,
by the encroachments of the civil courts, and the pre&s;ent
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the canon law; that they could &s;ummon
no offenders before them, puni&s;h no vice, nor exert the
di&s;cipline of the church: From which diminution of
their authority, they pretended, immorality had every
where received great encouragement and encrea&s;e. The
de&s;ign of &s;ome was, to revive the penitentiary rules of
the primitive church: But others thought, that &s;uch an
authority committed to the bi&s;hops, would prove more
oppre&s;&s;ive than confe&s;&s;ion, penance, and all the clerical
inventions of the ancient &s;uper&s;tition. The Parliament,
<PB N="367" REF="395">
for the pre&s;ent, contented them&s;elves with empowering
the King to appoint thirty-two commi&s;&s;ioners to frame a
body of canon laws, which were to be valid though ne|ver
ratified by Parliament. Such implicit tru&s;t did they
repo&s;e in the crown, though all their liberties and pro|perties
might be affected by the&s;e canons<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">3 &amp; 4 Edw. VI. c. 2.</NOTE>. The King
died before the canons received the royal &s;anction. Sir
John Sharington, who&s;e crimes and malver&s;ations had
appeared &s;o egregious at the condemnation of lord Sey|mour,
obtained from Parliament a rever&s;al of his attain|der<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid, c. 1$.</NOTE>. This man &s;ought favour with the mo&s;t zealous of
the reformers; and bi&s;hop Latimer a&s;&s;erted, that though
formerly he was a mo&s;t notorious knave, he was now &s;o
penitent, that he had become a very hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>WHEN Warwic and the council of regency began to
exerci&s;e their power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1550.</NOTE> they found them&s;elves involved in
the &s;ame difficulties which had embarra&s;&s;ed the protector.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France and Scotland.</NOTE>
The wars with France and Scotland could not be &s;up|ported
by an exhau&s;ted exchequer, &s;eemed dangerous to a
divided nation, and were now acknowleged not to have
any object, which even the greate&s;t and mo&s;t uninter|rupted
&s;ucce&s;s could attain. The project of peace which
Somer&s;et entertained, had &s;erved them as a pretence of
clamour again&s;t his admini&s;tration; yet after &s;ending Sir
Thomas Cheney to the emperor, and making again a
fruitle&s;s effort to engage him in the protection of Bou|logne,
they found them&s;elves obliged to li&s;ten to the ad|vances
which Henry made them, by means of Guidotti,
a Florentine merchant. The earl of Bedford, Sir John
Ma&s;on, Paget, and Petre, were &s;ent over to Boulogne,
with full powers to negociate. The French King ab&s;o|lutely
refu&s;ed to pay the two millions of crowns which
his predece&s;&s;or had acknowledged to be due to the crown
<PB N="368" REF="396">
of England, as arrears of pen&s;ions; and &s;aid, that he
never would con&s;ent to render him&s;elf tributary to any
prince: But he offered a &s;um for the immediate re&s;titu|tion
of Boulogne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boulogne &s;urrendered</NOTE> and four hundred thou&s;and crowns
were at la&s;t agreed on, one half to be paid immediately,
the other in Augu&s;t following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 March.</NOTE> Six ho&s;tages were given
for the performance of this article. Scotland was com|prehended
in the treaty: The Engli&s;h &s;tipulated to re&s;tore
Lauder and Dunglas, and to demoli&s;h the fortre&s;&s;es of
Roxburgh and Eymouth<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 148. Hayward, 310, 311, 312. Rymer, vol. xv. p. 211.</NOTE>. No &s;ooner was peace con|cluded
with France, than a project was entertained of a
clo&s;e union with that kingdom; and Henry very wil|lingly
embraced a propo&s;al &s;o &s;uitable both to his intere&s;ts
and inclinations. An agreement, &s;ometime after, was
formed for a marriage between Edward and Elizabeth,
a daughter of France; and all the articles were, after a
little negociation, fully &s;ettled<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 318. Heylin, p. 104. Rymer, tom. xv. p. 293.</NOTE>: But this project never
took effect.</P>
<P>THE intentions of marrying the King to a daughter of
Henry, who was a violent per&s;ecutor of the prote&s;tants,
was no wi&s;e acceptable to that party in England: But in
all other re&s;pects, the council was very &s;teady in promot|ing
the reformation, and in enforcing the laws again&s;t the
Romani&s;ts. Many of the prelates were &s;till addicted to
that communion; and though they made &s;ome compli|ances,
in order to &s;ave their bi&s;hoprics, they retarded, as
much as they &s;afely could, the execution of the new laws,
and gave countenance to &s;uch as were negligent or refrac|tory.
A re&s;olution was therefore taken to &s;eek pretences
for depriving them; and the execution of this intention
was the more ea&s;y, as they had all of them been obliged
<PB N="369" REF="397">
to take commi&s;&s;ions, in which it was declared, that they
held their &s;ees only during the King's plea&s;ure. It was
thought proper to begin with Gardiner, in order to &s;trike
a terror into the re&s;t. The method of proceeding again&s;t
him was extremely violent, and had &s;carce any colour of
law or ju&s;tice. It had been pre&s;cribed him, to inculcate
in a &s;ermon, the duty of obedience to a King even du|ring
his minority; and becau&s;e he had neglected this
topic, he had been thrown into pri&s;on, and had been
there detained during two years, without being accu&s;ed
of any crime, except di&s;obedience to this arbitrary com|mand.
The duke of Somer&s;et, &s;ecretary Petre, and &s;ome
others of the council, were now &s;ent, in order to try his
temper, and endeavour to find &s;ome ground for depriving
him: He profe&s;&s;ed to them his intention of conforming
to the government, of &s;upporting the King's laws, and
of officiating by the new liturgy. This was not the
di&s;po&s;tion which they expected or de&s;ired<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 99.</NOTE>: A new de|putation
was therefore &s;ent, who carried him &s;everal ar|ticles
to &s;ub&s;cribe. He was to acknowledge his former
mi&s;behaviour, and confe&s;s the ju&s;tice of his con$inement:
He was likewi&s;e to own, that the King was &s;upreme head
of the church; that the power of making and di&s;pen&s;ing
with holidays, was part of the prerogative; that
the common-prayer book was a godly and commendable form;
that the King was a compleat &s;overeign in his minority;
that the act of the &s;ix articles was ju&s;tly repealed; and
that the King had full authority to correct and reform
what was ami&s;s in eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, government,
or doctrine. The bi&s;hop was willing to put his hand to
all the articles except the fir&s;t: He maintained his con|duct
to have been inoffen&s;ive; and declared, that he

<P>THE council, finding that he had gone &s;uch lengths,
were determined to prevent his full compliance, by mul|tiplying
the difficulties upon him, and &s;ending him new
articles to &s;ub&s;cribe. A li&s;t was &s;elected of &s;uch points
as they thought would be the mo&s;t hard of dige&s;tion;
and not content with the&s;e, they in&s;i&s;ted &s;till on his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
and an acknowlegement of pa&s;t errors. To
make this &s;ub&s;cription more mortifying, they required
a promi&s;e, that he would recommend and publi&s;h all the&s;e
articles from the pulpit: But Gardiner, who &s;aw, that
they intended either to ruin or di&s;honour him, or perhaps
both, determined not to gratify his enemies by any farther
compliances; He &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on his innocence; de&s;ired
a fair trial; and refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe more articles, till he
&s;hould recover his liberty. For this pretended offence his
bi&s;hopric was put under &s;eque&s;tration for three months;
and as he then appeared no more compliant than at fir&s;t,
a commi&s;&s;ion was appointed to try, or, more properly
&s;peaking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1551.</NOTE> to condemn him. The commi&s;&s;ions were, the
primate, the bi&s;hops of London, Ely, and Lincoln, &s;ecre|tary
Petre, Sir James Hales, and &s;ome other lawyers.
Gardiner objected to the legality of the commi&s;&s;ion,
which was not founded on any &s;tatute or precedent; and
he appealed from the commi&s;&s;ioners to the King. His
appeal was not regarded: Sentence was pronounced
again&s;t him: He was deprived of his bi&s;hopric: And
committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody: His books and papers were
&s;eized: all company was denied him; and it was not al|lowed

GARDINER, as well as the other prelates, had agreed
to hold his office during the King's plea&s;ure: But the
council, unwilling to make u&s;e of a conce&s;&s;ion which
had been &s;o illegally and arbitrarily exacted, cho&s;e rather
to employ &s;ome forms of ju&s;tice; a re&s;olutton, which
led them, to commit &s;till greater iniquities and &s;everities,
But the violence of the reformers did not &s;top there.
Day, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, Heathe of Wotce&s;ter, and
Voi&s;ey of Exeter, were deprived of their bi&s;hoprics, on
pretence of di&s;obedience. Even Kitchen of Landaff,
Capon of Sali&s;bury, and Sam&s;on of Coventry tho' they
had complied in every thing, yet not being &s;uppo&s;ed cor|dial
or hearty in their obedience, were obliged to &s;eek
protection, by &s;acrificing the mo&s;t con&s;iderable revenues
of their fee to the rapacious courtiers<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Goodwin de praeful. Angl. Heylin, p. 100.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE plunderers neglected not even &s;maller profits.
An order was i&s;&s;ued by council, for purging the library
of We&s;tmin&s;ter of all mi&s;&s;als, legends and other &s;uper|&s;titious
volumes, and delivering their garniture to Sir
Anthony Aucher<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 307, from the council books.</NOTE>. Many of the&s;e books were plaited
with gold and &s;ilver, and curiou&s;ly embo&s;&s;ed; and this
finery was probably the &s;uper&s;tition that de&s;troyed them.
Great havoc was likewi&s;e made on the libraries of Ox|ford.
Books and manu&s;cripts were de&s;troyed without
di&s;tinction: The volumes of divinity &s;uffered for their
rich binding: Tho&s;e of literature were condemned as
u&s;ele&s;s: Tho&s;e of geometry and a&s;tronomy were &s;uppo&s;ed
to contain nothing but necromancy<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wood, hi&s;t. &amp; antiq$ Oxon. lib. i. p. 271, 272.</NOTE>. The univer&s;ity

every moment to be &s;wallowed up by the earl of War|wic
and his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>THO' every thing be&s;ides yielded to the authority of
the council, the lady Mary could never be brought to
compliance; and &s;he &s;till continued to adhere to the ma&s;s,
and to reject the new liturgy. Her behaviour was, dur|ing
&s;ome time, connived at; but, at la&s;t, her two chap|lains,
Mallet and Berkeley, were thrown into pri&s;on<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. ii. p. 249.</NOTE>;
and the prince&s;s was remon&s;trated with for her di&s;obe|dience.
The council wrote her a letter, by which they
endeavoured to make her change her &s;entiments, and to
per&s;uade her, that her religious faith was very ill ground|ed.
They a&s;ked her, what warrant there was in Scrip|ture
for prayers in an unknown tongue, the u&s;e of images,
or offering up the &s;acrament for the dead; and they de|&s;ired
her to peru&s;e St. Au&s;tin, and the other ancient doc|tors,
who would convince her of the errors of the Ro|mi&s;h
&s;uper&s;tition, and prove that it was founded merely
on fal&s;e miracles and lying &s;tories<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. ii. Collier, Burnet.</NOTE>. The lady Mary
remained ob&s;tinate again&s;t all this advice, and prote&s;ted
her&s;elf willing to endure death rather than relinqui&s;h her
religion: She only feared, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he was not
worthy to &s;uffer in &s;o holy a cau&s;e; And as for prote&s;tant
books, &s;he thanked God, that, as &s;he never had, &s;o &s;he
hoped never to read any of them. Dreading farther vio|lence,
&s;he endeavoured to make her e&s;cape to her kin&s;|man
Charles; but her de&s;ign was di&s;covered and preven|ted<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heyward, p. 315.</NOTE>. The emperor remon&s;trated in her behalf, and even
threatned ho&s;tilities, if liberty of con&s;cience was refu&s;ed
her: But though the council, &s;en&s;ible that the kingdom
was in no condition to &s;upport, with honour, &s;uch a war,
was de&s;irous to comply; they found great difficulty to
<PB N="373" REF="401">
overcome the &s;cruples of the young King. He had been
educated in &s;uch a violent abhorrence of the ma&s;s, and
other popi&s;h rites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1551.</NOTE> which he regarded as impious and
idolatrous, that he &s;hould participate, he thought, in the
&s;in, if he allowed its commi&s;&s;ion: And when at la&s;t the
importunity of Cranmer, Ridley, and Poinet, prevailed
&s;omewhat over his oppo&s;ition, he bur&s;t into tears, lament|ing
his &s;i&s;ter's ob&s;tinacy, and bewailing his own fate, that he
mu&s;t &s;uffer her to continue in &s;uch an abominable
mode of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE great object, at this time, of antipathy among
the prote&s;tant &s;ects, was popery, or, more properly &s;peak|ing,
the papi&s;ts. The&s;e they regarded as the common
enemy, who threatened every moment to overwhelm the
evangelical faith, and de&s;troy its partizans by fire and
&s;word; They had not as yet had lei&s;ure to attend to the
other minute divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, which after|wards
became the objects of &s;uch furious quarrels and
animo&s;ities, and threw the whole kingdom into confu|&s;ion.
Several Lutheran divines, who had reputation in
tho&s;e days, Bucer, Peter Martyr, and others, were in|duced
to take &s;helter in England, from the per&s;ecutions
which the emperor exerci&s;ed in Germany; and they
received protection and encouragement. John A-la&s;co,
a Poli&s;h nobleman, being expelled his country by the
rigours of the catholics, &s;ettled, during &s;ome time, at
Embden in Ea&s;t-Friezland, where he became preacher to
a congregation of the reformed. Fore&s;eeing the per&s;e|cutions
which en&s;ued, he removed to England, and
brought his congregation along with him. The council,
who regarded them as indu&s;trious, u&s;eful people, and de|&s;ired
to invite over others of the &s;ame character, not only
gave them Augu&s;tine friars church for the exerci&s;e of
their religion, but granted them a charter, by which they
<PB N="374" REF="402">
were erected into a corporation, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;uper|intendant
and four a&s;&s;i&s;ting mini&s;ters. This eccle&s;ia&s;tical
e&s;tabli&s;hment was quite independant of the church of
England, and differed from it in &s;ome rites and cere|monies<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cran. p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE differences among the prote&s;tants were matter
of triumph to the catholics, who in&s;i&s;ted, that the mo|ment
men departed from the authority of the church,
they lo&s;t all criterion of truth and fal&s;hood in matters of
religion, and mu&s;t be carried away by every wind of
doctrine. The continual variations of every fect of pro|te&s;tants,
afforded them the &s;ame topic of rea&s;oning. The
book of common prayer &s;uffered in England a new revi|&s;al,
and &s;ome rites and ceremonies, which had given of|fence,
were omitted<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cran. p. 289.</NOTE>. The &s;peculative doctrines, or the
metaphy&s;ics of the religion, were al&s;o fixed in forty-two
articles. The&s;e articles were intended to obviate further
divi&s;ions and variations; and the framing them had been
po&s;tponed till the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the liturgy, which
was regarded as a more material object to the people.
The eternity of hell torments is a&s;&s;erted in the articles;
and care is al&s;o taken to inculcate, not only that no hea|then,
however virtuous, can e&s;cape an endle&s;s &s;tate of the
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery, but al&s;o that every one who pre|&s;umes
to maintain, that any pagan can po&s;&s;ibly be
&s;aved, is him&s;elf expo&s;ed to the penalty of eternal perdi|tion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Article xviii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE theological zeal of the council, tho' &s;eemingly
fervent, went not &s;o far as to make them neglect their
own temporal concerns, which &s;eem to have been ever
uppermo&s;t in their thoughts: They even found lei&s;ure to
attend to the public intere&s;t; nay, to the commerce of the
<PB N="375" REF="403">
nation, which was, at that time, very little the object of
general &s;tudy or attention. The trade of England had
anciently been carried on altogether by foreigners, chiefly
the inhabitants of the Han&s;e-towns, or Ea&s;terlings, as
they were called; and in order to encourage the&s;e merch|ants
to &s;ettle in England, they had been erected into a
corporation by Henry the third, had obtained a patent,
were endowed with privileges, and were exempted from
&s;everal heavy duties paid by aliens. So ignorant were the
Engli&s;h of commerce, that this company, commonly de|nominated
the merchants of the Steel-yard, engro&s;&s;ed
almo&s;t the whole foreign trade of the kingdom; and as
they naturally employed the &s;hipping of their own coun|try,
the navigation of England was al&s;o in a very lan|gui&s;hing
condition. It was therefore thought proper by
the council to find pretences for annulling the privileges
of this corporation, privileges which put them nearly on
an equal footing with Englishmen in the duties which they
paid; and as &s;uch patents were, during that age, granted
by the ab&s;olute power of the King, men were the le&s;s
&s;urprized to find them recalled by the &s;ame authority.
Several remon&s;trances were made again&s;t this innovation,
by Lubec, Hamburgh, and other Han&s;e-towns; but the
council per&s;evered in their re&s;olution, and the good ef|fects
of it became &s;oon vi&s;ible to the nation. The Eng|li&s;h
merchants, by their very &s;ituation as natives, had
advantages above foreigners in the purcha&s;e of cloth,
wool, and other commodities; though the&s;e advantages
had not been &s;ufficient to rouze their indu&s;try, or engage
them to become rivals to this opulent company: But
when aliens duty was al&s;o impo&s;ed upon all foreigners in|di&s;criminately, the Engli&s;h were tempted to enter into
commerce, and a &s;pirit of indu&s;try began to appear in
the kingdom<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hayward, p. 326. Heylin, p. 108. Strype's Mem. vol. ii. p. 295.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="404">
ABOUT the &s;ame time a treaty was made with Gu&s;ta|vus
Eric&s;on, King of Sweden, by which it was &s;tipulat|ed,
that if he &s;ent bullion into England, he might carry
away Engli&s;h commodities without paying cu&s;tom, that
he &s;hould carry bullion to no other prince, that if he &s;ent
ozimus, &s;teel, copper, &amp;c. he &s;hould pay cu&s;tom for
Engli&s;h commodities as an Engli&s;hman, and that if he
&s;ent other merchandize, he &s;hould have free intercour&s;e,

Sweden &s;et the mint to work: Good &s;pecie was coined:
And much of the ba&s;e metal, formerly i&s;&s;ued, was re|called:
A circum&s;tance which tended extremely to the
encouragement of commerce.</P>
<P>BUT all the&s;e &s;chemes for the improvement of indu&s;try
were like to prove abortive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwic created duke of North|umberland.</NOTE> by the fear of dome&s;tic con|vul&s;ions,
ari&s;ing from the exorbitant ambition of Warwic.
That nobleman, not contented with the &s;tation which he
had attained, carried farther his preten&s;ions, and had
gained to him&s;elf partizans who were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;econd
him in every enterprize. The la&s;t earl of Northumber|land
died without i&s;&s;ue; and as Sir Thomas Piercy, his
brother, had been attainted on account of the &s;hare which
he had in the York&s;hire in&s;urrection during the late reign,
the title was at pre&s;ent extinct, and the e&s;tate was ve&s;ted in
the crown. Warwic now procured to him&s;elf a grant
of tho&s;e ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which lay chiefly in the North,
the mo&s;t warlike part of the kingdom; and he was dig|nified
with the title of duke of Northumberland. His
friend, Paulet, lord St. John, the trea&s;urer, was created
fir&s;t earl of Wilt&s;hire, then marquis of Winche&s;ter: Sir
William Herbert was made earl of Pembroke.</P>
<P>BUT the ambition of Northumberland made him re|gard<NOTE PLACE="marg">His ambi|tion.</NOTE>
all increa&s;e of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and titles, either to him&s;elf
<PB N="377" REF="405">
or partizans, as &s;teps only to further acqui&s;itions. Find|ing
that Somer&s;et, though degraded from his dignity,
and even le&s;&s;ened in the public opinion by his &s;piritle&s;s
conduct, &s;till enjoyed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of popularity,
he determined to ruin a man whom he regarded as the
chief ob&s;tacle to the attainment of his hopes. The al|liance
which had been formed between the families had
produced no cordial union, and only enabled Northum|berland
to compa&s;s with more certainty the de&s;truction of
his rival. He &s;ecretly gained many of the friends and
&s;ervants of that unhappy nobleman: He &s;ometimes ter|rified
him by the appearance of danger: Sometimes pro|voked
him by ill u&s;age. The unguarded Somer&s;et often
broke out into menacing expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t Northum|berland:
At other times, he formed ra&s;h projects, which
he immediately abandoned: His treacherous confidents
carried to his enemy every pa&s;&s;ionate word which dropped
from him: They revealed the &s;chemes, which they them|&s;elves
had fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 112.</NOTE>: And Northumberland, think|ing
that the proper &s;ea&s;on was now come, began to act
in an open manner again&s;t him.</P>
<P>In one night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 October.</NOTE> the duke of Somer&s;et, the lord Grey,
David and John Seymour, Hammond and Neudigate,
two of the duke's &s;ervants, Sir Ralph Vane and Sir
Thomas Palmer were arre&s;ted and committed to cu&s;tody.
Next day, the dutche&s;s of Somer&s;et, with her favourites,
Crane and his wife, Sir Miles Partridge, Sir Michael
Stanhope, Banni&s;ter, and others were thrown into pri&s;on.
Sir Thomas Palmer, who had all along acted the part
of a &s;py upon Somer&s;et, accu&s;ed him of having formed a
de&s;ign to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection in the north, to attack the
gens d'armes on a mu&s;ter-day, to &s;ecure the Tower, and
to excite a rebellion in London: But what was the only
<PB N="378" REF="406">
probable accu&s;ation, he a&s;&s;erted, that Somer&s;et had once
laid a project for murdering Northumberland, North|ampton,
and Pembroke at a banquet, which was to be
given them by lord Paget. Crane and his wife confirm|ed
Palmer's testimony with regard to this la&s;t de&s;ign;
and it appears that &s;ome ra&s;h &s;cheme of that nature had
been mentioned; though no regular con&s;piracy had been
formed, nor means prepared for its execution. Ham|mond
confe&s;&s;ed, that the duke had armed men to guard
him one night in his hou&s;e at Greenwich.</P>
<P>SOMERSET was brought to his trial before the marquis<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Somer&s;et.</NOTE>
of Winche&s;ter, who acted as high &s;teward. Twenty|&s;even
peers &s;at as the jury, among whom were Northum|berland,
Pembroke, and Northampton, whom decency
&s;hould have hindered from acting as judges in the trial
of a man, who appeared to be their capital enemy.
Somer&s;et was accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on on account of the
projected in&s;urrections, and of felony in forming a de&s;ign
to murder privy-coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>WE have a very imperfect account of all &s;tate trials
during that age, which is a &s;en&s;ible defect in our hi&s;|tory:
But it appears, that &s;ome more regularity was ob|&s;erved
in the management of this pro&s;ecution than had
been u&s;ually employed in like ca&s;es. The witne&s;&s;es
were at lea&s;t examined by the privy-council; and though
they were neither produced in court, nor confronted with
the pri&s;oner (circum&s;tances required by the &s;trict prin|ciples<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t December.</NOTE>
of equity) their depo&s;itions were given in to the
jury. The proof &s;eems to have been very lame with re|gard
to the trea&s;onable part of the charge; and Somer&s;et's
defence was &s;o &s;atisfactory, that the peers gave verdict in
his favour: The intention alone of a&s;&s;aulting the privy
coun&s;ellors was &s;upported by any tolerable evidence; and
the jury brought him in guilty of felony. The pri&s;oner
<PB N="379" REF="407">
him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed, that he had mentioned the de&s;ign of
murdering Northumberland and the other lords; but
had not formed any re&s;olution on that head: And when he
received &s;entence, he a&s;ked pardon of tho&s;e peers for the
de&s;igns which he had hearkened to again&s;t them. The
people, by whom Somer&s;et was beloved, hearing the fir&s;t
part of his &s;entence, by which he was ab&s;olved from
trea&s;on, expre&s;&s;ed their joy by loud acclamations: But
their &s;atisfaction was &s;uddenly damped, on finding that
he was condemned to death for felony<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heyward, p. 320, 321, 322. Stow$, p. 606. Holling&s;hed, p. 1067.</NOTE>.</P>

a continued &s;eries of occupations and amu&s;ements.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu|tion. 22d Jan.</NOTE> At

them &s;oon after, when Northumberland met with a like
doom, upbraided him with this cruelty, and di&s;played to
him the&s;e &s;ymbols of his crime. Somer&s;et indeed, tho'
many actions of his life were very exceptionable, &s;eems,
in general, to have merited a better fate; and the faults,
which he committed, were owing to weakne&s;s, not to
any bad intentions. His virtues were better calculated
for private than for public life; and by his want of pene|tration
and firmne&s;s, he was ill-fitted to extricate him&s;elf
from tho&s;e cabals and violences to which that age was
&s;o much addicted. Sir Thomas Arundel, Sir Michael
<PB N="380" REF="408">
Stanhope, Sir Miles Partridge, and Sir Ralph Vane, all
of them Somer&s;et's friends, were brought to their trial,
condemned and executed: Great inju&s;tice &s;eems to have
been u&s;ed in their pro&s;ecution. Lord Paget, chancellor
of the dutchy, was, on &s;ome pretence, tried in the Star|chamber,
and condemned in a fine of 6000 pounds, with
the lo&s;s of his office. To mortify him the more, he was
degraded from the order of the garter; as unworthy, on
account of his mean birth, to &s;hare that honour<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 608.</NOTE>. Lord
Rich, chancellor, was al&s;o compelled to re&s;ign his office,
on the di&s;covery of &s;ome friend&s;hip, which he had &s;hewn

<P>THE day after the execution of Somer&s;et,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Jan. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> a &s;e&s;&s;ion of

To u&s;e the ma&s;s had already been prohibited under very

&s;cope thay had given to their own private judgment,
in di&s;puting the tenets of the antient religion, were re|&s;olved
not to allow the &s;ame privilege to others; and
the practice, nay the very doctrine of toleration, was, at
that time, equally unknown to all &s;ects and parties. To
di&s;&s;ent from the religion of the magi&s;trate was univer&s;ally
conceived to be as criminal as to que&s;tion his title, or re|bel

<P>A LAW was enacted again&s;t u&s;ury; that is, again&s;t
taking any intere&s;t for money<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ib. c. 20.</NOTE>. This act was the effect

lords, renewing tho&s;e rigorous &s;tatutes of trea&s;ons, which
had been abrogated in the beginning of this reign; and
though the peers, by their high &s;tation, &s;tood mo&s;t ex|po&s;ed
to the&s;e tempe&s;ts of &s;tate, yet had they &s;o little
regard to public &s;ecurity, or even to their own true in|tere&s;ts,
that they pa&s;&s;ed the bill with only one di&s;&s;enting
voice<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary hi&s;t. vol. iii. p. 258. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 190. 5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI. cap. 2.</NOTE>. But the commons rejected it, and prepared a
new bill, that pa&s;&s;ed into a law, by which it was enact|ed,
that whoever &s;hould call the King or any of his heirs,
named in the &s;tatute of the 35th of the la&s;t reign, heretic,
&s;chi&s;matic, tyrant, infidel, or u&s;urper of the crown, &s;hould
forfeit, for the fir&s;t offence, their goods and chattels, and
be impri&s;oned during plea&s;ure; for the &s;econd, &s;hould
incur a <HI>praemunire;</HI> for the third, &s;hould be attainted of
trea&s;on. But if any &s;hould unadvi&s;edly advance &s;uch a
&s;lander in writing, printing, painting, carving or grav|ing,
he was, for the fir&s;t offence, to be held a traitor$m.
It may be worthy of notice, that the King and his next
heir, the lady Mary, were profe&s;&s;edly of different reli|gions;
and religions, which threw on each other the
imputation of here&s;y, &s;chi&s;m, idolatry, prophanene&s;s,
bla&s;phemy, wickedne&s;s, and all the opprobrious epithets,
that religious zeal has invented. It was almo&s;t impo&s;|&s;ible,
therefore, for the people, if they &s;poke on the&s;e
&s;ubjects at all, not to fall into the crime, &s;o &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed
by this &s;tatute; and the jealou&s;y of the commons
for liberty, though it led them to di&s;&s;ent from the lords,
appears not to have been very active, vigilant, or clear|&s;ighted.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="410">
THE commons annexed to this bill a clau&s;e which was
of much more importance than the bill it&s;elf, that no
one &s;hould be convicted of any kind of trea&s;on, unle&s;s
the crime was proved by the oaths of two witne&s;&s;es, who
were confronted with the pri&s;oner. The lords &s;crupled to
pa&s;s this clau&s;e; though required by the mo&s;t obvious
principles of equity, and though their own intere&s;t was
fully as much concerned as that of the commons. But
the members of that hou&s;e tru&s;ted for protection to their
pre&s;ent per&s;onal intere&s;t and power, and neglected the
noble&s;t and mo&s;t permanent &s;ecurity, that of the laws.</P>
<P>A BILL was introduced into the hou&s;e of peers for
making a provi&s;ion for the poor; but the commons, not
chu&s;ing that a money-bill &s;hould begin in the upper|hou&s;e,
framed a new bill to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. By this
bill, the churchwardens were empowered to collect cha|ritable
contributions for the poor, and if any refu&s;ed to
contribute, or di&s;&s;waded others from that charity, the
bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e was impowered to proceed again&s;t
them. Such large di&s;cretionary powers, entru&s;ted to the
prelates, &s;eem as proper an object of jealou&s;y as the au|thority
a&s;&s;umed by the peers<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI. cap. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was another occa&s;ion in which the Parliament
repo&s;ed an unu&s;ual confidence in the bi&s;hops. They
empowered them to proceed again&s;t &s;uch as neglected
the Sundays and holydays<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 3.</NOTE>. But the&s;e were unguarded
conce&s;&s;ions granted to the church: The general humour
of the times led men to bereave the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of all
their power, and even to pillage them of all their pro|perty:
Many clergymen were obliged for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
to turn carpenters or taylors, and &s;ome kept alehou&s;es<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 202.</NOTE>.
The bi&s;hops them&s;elves were generally reduced to po|verty,
<PB N="383" REF="411">
and held both their revenues and &s;piritual office
by a very precarious and uncertain tenure.</P>
<P>TONSTAL, bi&s;hop of Durham, was one of the mo&s;t
eminent prelates of that age, &s;till le&s;s for the dignity of
his &s;ee, than for his own per&s;onal merit, his learning,
moderation, humanity, and beneficence. He had oppo&s;|ed,
by his vote and authority, all the innovations in
religion; but &s;o &s;oon as they were enacted, he had always
&s;ubmitted, and had paid conformity to each &s;y&s;tem of
religion, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed. His known probity had
made this compliance be a&s;cribed, not to an intere&s;ted or
time-&s;erving &s;pirit, but to a &s;en&s;e of duty, which led
him to think that all private opinions ought to be &s;acrifi|ced
to the great concerns of public peace and tranquillity.
That general regard which was paid his character, had
pre&s;erved him from any &s;evere treatment during the pro|tector&s;hip
of Somer&s;et; but when Northumberland gained
the a&s;cendant, he was thrown into pri&s;on; and as that
rapacious nobleman had laid a de&s;ign of appropriating
the revenues of the &s;ee of Durham, and of forming to
him&s;elf a principality in the northern counties, he was
re&s;olved, in order to effectuate his purpo&s;e, to deprive
Ton&s;tal of his bi&s;hopric. A bill of attainder, therefore,
on pretence of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, was introduced into
the hou&s;e of peers again&s;t that prelate; and it pa&s;&s;ed with
the oppo&s;ition only of lord Stourton, a zealous catholic,
and of Cranmer, who always bore a cordial and &s;incere
friend&s;hip to the bi&s;hop of Durham. But when the bill
was &s;ent down to the commons, they required that wit|ne&s;&s;es
&s;hould be examined, that Ton&s;tal &s;hould be al|lowed
to defend him&s;elf, and that he &s;hould be confronted
with his accu&s;ers: And when the&s;e demands were refu&s;ed,
they rejected the bill.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="412">
THIS equity, &s;o unu&s;ual in the Parliament during that
age, was a&s;cribed by Northumberland and his partizans,
not to any regard for liberty and ju&s;tice, but to the pre|valence
of Somer&s;et's faction in a hou&s;e of commons,
which, being cho&s;en during the admini&s;tration of that
nobleman, had been almo&s;t entirely filled with his crea|tures.
They were confirmed in this opinion, when
they found, that a bill ratifying the attainder of Somer&s;et
and his accomplices was al&s;o rejected by the commons,
though it had pa&s;&s;ed the upper hou&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April.</NOTE> A re&s;olution was
therefore taken to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament, which had &s;at during this whole reign; and &s;oon after to &s;ummon a new
one.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par|liament.</NOTE> in order to en&s;ure to him&s;elf a
hou&s;e of commons entirely ob&s;equious to his will, ventured
on an expedient which could not have been practi&s;ed, or
even thought of, in an age, when there was any idea or
comprehen&s;ion of liberty. He engaged the King to
write circular letters to all the &s;heriffs, in which he en|joined
them to inform the freeholders and voters, that
they were required to choo&s;e men of knowledge and ex|perience
for their repre&s;entatives. After this general ex|hortation,
the King continued in the&s;e words. &startq;And
yet, neverthele&s;s, our plea&s;ure is, that where our privy
council, or any of them &s;hall, in our behalf, recom|mend,
within their juri&s;diction, men of learning and
wi&s;dom; in &s;uch ca&s;es, their directions &s;hall be regarded
and followed, as tending to the &s;ame end which we
de&s;ire, that is, to have this a&s;&s;embly compo&s;ed of the
per&s;ons in our realm the be&s;t fitted to give advice and
good council<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strype's eccle&s;ia&s;tical memorials, vol. ii. p. 394.</NOTE>.&endq; Several letters were &s;ent from the
King, recommending members to particular counties,
Sir Richard Cotton for Hamp&s;hire; Sir William Fitz|williams
<PB N="385" REF="413">
and Sir Henry Neville for Berk&s;hire; Sir Wil|liam
Drury and Sir Henry Benningfield for Suffolk, &amp;c.
But tho' &s;ome counties only received this &s;pecies of <HI>cong&eacute;
d'elire</HI> form the King; the recommendations from the privy
council and the coun&s;ellors, we may fairly pre&s;ume,
would extend to the greate&s;t part, if not to the whole, of
the kingdom.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that this attempt was made during
the reign of a minor King, when the royal authority is
u&s;ually weake&s;t; that it was patiently &s;ubmitted to;
and that it gave &s;o little umbrage as &s;carce to be taken notice
of by any hi&s;torian. The painful and laborious collector
above-cited, who never omits the mo&s;t trivial matters, is
the only per&s;on, that has thought this memorable letter
worthy of being tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE Parliament an&s;wered Northumberland's expec|tations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1553.</NOTE>
As Ton&s;tal had in the interval been deprived<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t March.</NOTE>
of his bi&s;hopric after a very arbitrary manner, by the
&s;entence of lay commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed to try him, the
&s;ee of Durham was by act of Parliament divided into two
bi&s;hoprics, which had certain portions of the revenue a&s;|&s;igned
them. The regalities of the &s;ee, which included
the juri&s;diction of a count palatine, were given by the
King to Northumberland; and it was not to be doubted
but that nobleman had al&s;o propo&s;ed to make rich plunder
of the revenue, as was then the u&s;ual practice of the
courtiers, whenever a bi&s;hopric became vacant.</P>
<P>THE commons gave the mini&s;try another mark of at|tachment,
which was at that time the mo&s;t &s;incere, the
mo&s;t cordial, and the mo&s;t difficult to be obtained: They
granted a &s;upply of two &s;ub&s;idies and two fifteenths. To
render this pre&s;ent the more acceptable, they voted a
preamble, containing a long accu&s;ation of Somer&s;et,
<PB N="386" REF="414">
&startq;For involving the King in wars, wa&s;ting his trea&s;ure,
engaging him in much debt, emba&s;ing the coin, and
giving occa&s;ion for a mo&s;t terrible rebellion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">7 Edw. VI. cap. 12.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE debts of the crown were at this time very con|&s;iderable.
The King had received from France 400,000
crowns on delivering Boulogne; he had reaped profits
from the &s;ale of &s;ome chantry lands; the churches had
been de&s;poiled of all their plate and rich ornaments,
which, by a decree of council, without any pretence of
law or equity, had been converted to the King's u&s;e<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 95, 132.</NOTE>:
Yet &s;uch had been the rapacity of the courtiers, that the
Crown owed about 300,000 pounds<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Strype's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 344.</NOTE>; and great dilapi|dations
were, at the &s;ame time, made of the royal de|me&s;nes.
The young prince &s;howed, among other virtues,
a di&s;po&s;ition to frugality, which, had he lived, would
&s;oon have retrieved the&s;e lo&s;&s;es: But as his health was
declining very fa&s;t, the pre&s;ent emptine&s;s of the exche|quer
was a &s;en&s;ible ob&s;tacle to the execution of tho&s;e
projects, which the ambition of Northumberland had
founded on the pro&s;pect of Edward's approaching end.</P>
<P>THAT nobleman repre&s;ented to the prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Succe&s;&s;ion changed.</NOTE> whom
youth and an infirm &s;tate of health made &s;u&s;ceptible of
every impre&s;&s;ion, that his two &s;i&s;ters, Mary and Elizabeth,
had both been declared illegitimate by act of Parliament,
and though Henry by his will had re&s;tored them to a place
in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the nation would never bear to &s;ee the
throne of England filled by a ba&s;tard: That they were
only the King's &s;i&s;ters by the half-blood; and even if they
were legitimate, could not enjoy the crown as his heirs
and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: That the Queen of Scots &s;tood excluded
by the King's will; and being an alien, lo&s;t by the law
all right of inheriting; not to mention, that, as &s;he was
<PB N="387" REF="415">
betrothed to the dauphin, &s;he would, by her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
render England, as &s;he had already done Scotland, a pro|vince
to France: That the certain con&s;equence of his
&s;i&s;ter Mary's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or that of the Queen of Scots,
was the abolition of the prote&s;tant religion, the repeal of
tho&s;e laws enacted in favour of the reformation, and the
re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the u&s;urpations and idolatry of the
church of Rome: That fortunately for England, the
&s;ame order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which ju&s;tice required, was al&s;o
the mo&s;t conformable to public intere&s;t; and there was
not on any &s;ide any ju&s;t ground for doubt or deliberation:
That when the&s;e three prince&s;&s;es were excluded by &s;uch
&s;olid rea&s;ons, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion devolved to the marchione&s;s
of Dor&s;et, elde&s;t daughter to the French Queen and the
duke of Suffolk: That the next heir of the marchione&s;s
was the lady Jane Gray, a lady of the mo&s;t amiable virtue,
accompli&s;hed by the be&s;t education, both in literature and
religion; and every way worthy of a throne: And that
even, if her title by blood &s;hould be doubtful, which
there was no ju&s;t rea&s;on to pretend, the King was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the &s;ame power, which his father enjoyed; and
might leave her the crown by letters patent. The&s;e
rea&s;onings made impre&s;&s;ion on the young prince; and
above all, his zealous affection for the prote&s;tant religion
made him apprehend the con&s;equences, if &s;o bigotted a
catholic as his &s;i&s;ter Mary &s;hould &s;ucceed to the throne.
And though he bore a tender affection to the lady Eliza|beth,
who was liable to no &s;uch objection, means were
found to per&s;uade him, that he could not exclude the
one &s;i&s;ter, on account of illegitimacy, without al&s;o giv|ing
an exclu&s;ion to the other.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, finding that his arguments were
likely to operate on the King, began to prepare the
<PB N="388" REF="416">
other parts of that political fabric, which he intended
to rai&s;e. Two &s;ons of the duke of Suffolk by a
&s;econd venter having died, this &s;ea&s;on, of the &s;weat|ing
&s;ickne&s;s, that title was extinct; and Northumberland
engaged the King to be&s;tow it on the marquis of
Dor&s;et. By means of this favour and of others,
which he conferred upon him, he per&s;uaded the new duke
of Suffolk and the dutche&s;s, to give their daughter, the
lady Jane, in marriage to his fourth &s;on, the lord Guil|ford
Dudley. In order to fortify him&s;elf by farther
alliances, he negotiated a marriage between the lady
Catherine Grey, &s;econd daughter to Suffolk, and lord
Herbert, elde&s;t &s;on to the earl of Pembroke. He al&s;o
married his own daughter to lord Ha&s;tings, elde&s;t &s;on to
the earl of Huntingdon<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 109. Stowe, p. 609.</NOTE>. The&s;e marriages were &s;olem|nized
with great pomp and fe&s;tivity; and the people,
who hated Northumberland, could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing
their indignation at &s;eeing the&s;e public demon&s;trations
of joy, during the langui&s;hing &s;tate of the young prince's
health.</P>
<P>EDWARD had been &s;eized in the foregoing year, fir&s;t
with the mea&s;les, then with the &s;mall pox; but having
perfectly recovered from both the&s;e di&s;tempers, the na|tion
entertained hopes, that they would only &s;erve to
confirm his health; and he had afterwards made a pro|gre&s;s
through &s;ome parts of the kingdom. It was &s;u&s;|pected,
that he had there over-heated him&s;elf in exerci&s;es:
He was &s;eized with a cough, which proved ob&s;tinate,
and gave way neither to regimen nor medicines:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's $ickne&s;s.</NOTE> Several
fetal &s;ymptoms of a con&s;umption appeared; and though
it was hoped, that, as the &s;ea&s;on of the year advanced,
his youth and temperance might get the better of the
<PB N="389" REF="417">
Malady, men &s;aw with great concern his bloom and vi|gour
in&s;en&s;ibly decay. The general attachment to the
young prince, joined to the hatred borne the Dudleys,
made it be remarked, that Edward had every moment de|clined
in health, from the time that lord Robert Dudley
had been put about him, in the quality of gentleman of
the bedchamber.</P>
<P>THE langui&s;hing &s;tate of Edward's health made Nor|thumberland
the more intent on the execution of his
project. He removed all, except his own emi&s;&s;aries,
from about the King: He him&s;elf attended him with the
greate&s;t affiduity: He pretended the mo&s;t anxious concern
for his health and welfare: And by all the&s;e artifices, he
prevailed on him to give his final con&s;ent to the &s;ettlement
projected. Sir Edward Montague, chief ju&s;tice of the
Common Pleas, Sir John Baker and Sir Thomas Brom|ley,
two judges, with the attorney and &s;olicitor-general,
were &s;ent for to the council; where, after the minutes
of the intended deed were read to them, the King re|quired
them to draw them up in the form of letters pa|tent.
They he&s;itated in obeying this order; and de&s;ired
time to con&s;ider of it. The more they reflected, the
greater danger they found in compliance. The &s;ettle|ment
of the crown by Henry the eighth had been made
in con&s;equence of an act of Parliament; and by another
act, pa&s;&s;ed in the beginning of this reign, it was declared
trea&s;on in any of the heirs, their aiders or abettors, to
attempt on the right of another, or change the order of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The judges pleaded the&s;e rea&s;ons before the
council. They urged, that &s;uch a patent as was intended
would be entirely invalid; that it would &s;ubject, not only
the judges who drew it, but every coun&s;ellor who &s;igned
<PB N="390" REF="418">
it, to the pains of trea&s;on; and that the only proper ex|pedient,
both to give force to the new &s;ettlement, and
free its partizans from danger, was to &s;ummon a Parlia|ment,
and obtain the con&s;ent and fanction of that a&s;|&s;embly.
The King &s;aid, that he intended afterwards to
follow that method, and would call a Parliament, in
which he propo&s;ed, to have his &s;ettlement ratified;
but in the mean time, he required the judges, on their al|legiance,
to draw the patent in the form required. The
council told the judges, that their refu&s;al would &s;ubject
them all to the pains of trea&s;on. Northumberland gave
to Montague the appellation of traitor; and &s;aid that he
would fight in his &s;hirt with any man in &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e
as that of the lady Jane's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The judges were
reduced to great difficulties between the dangers of the
law, and tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the violence of pre&s;ent power
and authority<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fuller, book viii. p. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE arguments were canva&s;&s;ed in &s;everal different
meetings between the council and the judges; and no
&s;olution could be found of the pre&s;ent difficulties. At
la&s;t, Montague propo&s;ed an expedient, which &s;atisfied
both his brethren and the coun&s;ellors. He de&s;ired, that
a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed by the King and
council, requiring the judges to draw a patent for the
new &s;ettlement of the crown; and that a pardon &s;hould
immediately after be granted them for any offence which
they might have incurred by their compliance. When the
patent was d$$wn and brought to the bi&s;hop of Ely,
chancellor, in order to pa&s;s the great &s;eal, that prelate
required, that all the judges &s;hould &s;ign it. Go&s;nald at
fir&s;t refu&s;ed; and it was with much difficulty, that he was
prevailed on, by the violent menaces of Northumberland,
to comply; but the con&s;tancy of Sir James Hales, who,
<PB N="391" REF="419">
though a zealous prote&s;tant, preferred ju&s;tice on this oc|ca&s;ion
to the prejudices of his party, could not be &s;haken
by any expedient. The chancellor next required, for his
greater &s;ecurity, that all the privy councellors &s;hould &s;et
their hands to the patent: The intrigues of Northum|berland
or the fears of his violence were &s;o prevalent, that
the coun&s;ellors complied with this demand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t June.</NOTE> Cranmer
alone he&s;itated during &s;ome time, but yielded at la&s;t to
the earne&s;t and pathetic entreaties of the King<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Cranm. Mem. p. 295.</NOTE>. Cecil,
at that time &s;ecretary of &s;tate, pretended afterwards that
he only &s;igned as a witne&s;s to the King's &s;ub&s;cription.
And thus, by the King's letters patent, the two prin|ce&s;&s;es,
Mary and Elizabeth, were &s;et a&s;ide; and the
crown was &s;ettled on the heirs of the dutche&s;s of Suffolk:
For the dutche&s;s her&s;elf was content to be po&s;tponed to
her daughters.</P>
<P>AFTER this &s;ettlement was made, with &s;o many i$|au&s;picious
circum&s;tances, Edward declined vi&s;ibly every
day in his health; and &s;mall hopes were entertained of
his recovery. To make the matter wor&s;e, his phy&s;icians
were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by Northumberland's advice and by an
order of council; and he was put into the hands of an
ignorant woman, who undertook, in a little time, to
re&s;tore him to his former &s;tate of health. After the u&s;e
of her medicines, all the bad &s;ymptoms encrea&s;ed to the
mo&s;t violent degree: He felt a difficulty of &s;peech and
breathing; his pul&s;e failed, his legs &s;welled, his colour
became livid; and many other &s;ymptoms appeared of his
approaching end. He expired at Greenwich in the &s;ix|teenth
year of his age, and the &s;eventh of his reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">And death. 6th July.</NOTE></P>
<P>ALL the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians dwell with plea&s;ure on the

&s;tore his daughter to the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, her title was

violate the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, had di&s;played Northum|berland's
ambition and inju&s;tice in a full light; and
when the people reflected on the long train of fraud, ini|quity
and cruelty, by which that project had been con|ducted;
that the lives of the two Seymours, as well as
the title of the prince&s;&s;es, had been &s;acrificed to it; they
were moved by indignation to exert them&s;elves in oppo|&s;ition
to &s;uch criminal enterprizes. The general vene|ration
al&s;o, paid to the memory of Henry the eighth,
prompted the nation to defend the rights of his po&s;terity;
and the mi&s;eries of the antient civil wars were not &s;o en|tirely
forgotten, that men were willing, by a departure
from the lawful heir, to incur the danger of like blood|&s;hed
and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, &s;en&s;ible of the oppo&s;ition which
he mu&s;t expect, had carefully concealed the de&s;tination
made by the King; and in order to bring the two
prince&s;&s;es into his power, he had had the precaution to
engage the council, before Edward's death, to write
to them in that prince's name, de&s;iring their attendance,
on pretence that his infirm &s;tate of health required the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of their coun&s;el and the con&s;olation of their com|pany<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 154.</NOTE>.

Edward expired before their arrival; but Nor|thumberland,
in order to make the prince&s;&s;es fall into the

Mary had already reached Hodde&s;den, within half
a day's journey of the court. Happily, the earl of Arun|del
&s;ent her private intelligence, both of her brother's
death and of the con&s;piracy formed again&s;t her<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 233.</NOTE>: She

and retire to Flanders, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould find it impo&s;&s;i|ble
to defend her right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. She wrote letters
to the nobility and mo&s;t considerable gentry in every
county of England; commanding them to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in
the defence of her crown and per&s;on. And &s;he di&s;patch|ed
a me&s;&s;age to the council; by which &s;he notified to
them, that her brother's death was no longer a &s;ecret to
her, promi&s;ed them pardon for pa&s;t offences, and re|quired
them immediately to give orders for proclaiming
her acce&s;&s;ion in London<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND found that farther di&s;&s;imulation
was fruitle&s;s: He went to Sion-hou&s;e<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. xiii. c. 2.</NOTE>, accompanied
with the duke of Suffolk, the earl of Pembroke, and
others of the nobility; and he approached the lady Jane,

&s;overeign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane Gray pro|claimed Queen.</NOTE> Jane was, in a great mea&s;ure, ignorant of

&s;urprize, that &s;he received intelligence of them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Godwin in Kennet, p. 329. Heylin, p. 149. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 234.</NOTE>. She
was a lady of the mo&s;t amiable per&s;on, the mo&s;t engaging
di&s;po&s;ition, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed parts; and being of
an equal age with the late King, &s;he had received all
her education with him, and &s;eemed even to po&s;&s;e&s;s a
<PB N="396" REF="422">
greater facility in acquiring every part of manly and po|lite
literature. She had attained a knowledge of the Ro|man
and Greek languages, be&s;ide modern tongues; had
pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her time in an application to learning;
and expre&s;&s;ed a great indifference for other occupations
and amu&s;ements u&s;ual with her &s;ex and &s;tation. Roger
A&s;cham, tutor to the lady Elizabeth, having at one time
paid her a vi&s;it, found her employed in reading of Plato,
while the re&s;t of the family were engaged in a party of
hunting in the park; and upon his admiring the &s;ingu|larity
of her choice, &s;he told him, that &s;he received more
plea&s;ure from that author than the others could reap from
all their &s;port and gaiety. Her heart, full of this pa&s;&s;ion
for literature and the elegant arts, and of tenderne&s;s to|wards
her hu&s;band, who was de&s;erving of her affection,
had never opened it&s;elf to the flattering allurements of
ambition; and the information of her advancement to
the throne was by no means agreeable to her. She even
refu&s;ed to accept of the pre&s;ent; pleaded the preferable
right of the two prince&s;&s;es; expre&s;&s;ed her dread of the
con&s;equences attending an enterprize &s;o dangerous, not
to &s;ay &s;o criminal; and de&s;ired to remain in that private
&s;tation in which &s;he was born. Overcome at la&s;t with
the entreaties, rather than rea&s;ons, of her father and fa|ther-in-law,
and above all of her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;ubmitted
to their will, and was prevailed on to relinqui&s;h her own
judgment. It was then u&s;ual for the Kings of England,
after their acce&s;&s;ion, to pa&s;s the fir&s;t days in the Tower;
and Northumberland immediately conveyed thither the new
&s;overeign<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 159.</NOTE>. All the coun&s;ellors were obliged to at|tend
her to that fortre&s;s; and by this means became, in

who&s;e will they were nece&s;&s;itated to obey. Orders
<PB N="397" REF="423">
were given by the council, to proclaim Jane throughout
the kingdom; but the&s;e orders were executed only in
London, and the neighbourhood. No applau&s;e en&s;ued:
The people heard the proclamation with &s;ilence and con|cern:
Some even expre&s;&s;ed their &s;corn and contempt:
And one Pot, a vintner's prentice, was &s;everely puni&s;h|ed
for this offence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 160.</NOTE>. The prote&s;tant teachers them&s;elves,

wrought no effect upon his audience<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 611. Holling&s;hed, p. 1087. Strype's Mem. vol. iii. p. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE people of Suffolk, meanwhile, paid their at|tendance
on Mary. As they were much attached to the
reformed communion, they could not forbear, amid&s;t
their tenders of duty, to expre&s;s their apprehen&s;ion for
the prote&s;tant religion; but when &s;he a&s;&s;ured them, that
&s;he never meant to change the laws of King Edward<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 15. Baker, p. 314. Speed, p. 816.</NOTE>,
they enli&s;ted them&s;elves in her cau&s;e with zeal and affec|tion.
The nobility and gentry flocked to her daily, and
brought her reinforcement. The earls of Bath and Su&s;|&s;ex,
the elde&s;t &s;ons of lord Wharton and lord Mordaunt,
Sir William Drury, Sir Henry Benningfield, Henry Jer|ningham,
per&s;ons who&s;e intere&s;t lay in the neighbour|hood,
appeared at the head of their tenants and re|tainers<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 160. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 237.</NOTE>.
Sir Edward Ha&s;tings, brother of the earl of
Huntingdon, having received a commi&s;&s;ion from the
council to make levies for the lady Jane in Buckingham|&s;hire,
carried over his troops, which amounted to four
thou&s;and men, and joined Queen Mary. Even a fleet,
which had been &s;ent by Northumberland to lie off the

coa&s;t of Suffolk, being forced into Yarmouth, by a &s;torm,
were engaged to declare for that prince&s;s.</P>
<P>NORTHUMBERLAND, who had hitherto been blinded
by ambition, &s;aw at la&s;t the danger gather round him,
and knew not to what hand to turn him&s;elf. He had le|vied
forces, which were a&s;&s;embled at London; but
dreading the cabals of the courtiers and coun&s;ellors,
who&s;e compliance, he knew, had been entirely the re&s;ult
of fear or artifice, he was re&s;olved to keep near the per|&s;on
of the lady Jane, and &s;end Suffolk to command the
army. But the coun&s;ellors, who wi&s;hed to remove
him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 330. Heylin, p. 159. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 239. Fox, vol. iii. p. 15.</NOTE>, working on the filial tenderne&s;s of Jane, magni|fied
to her the danger to which her father would be ex|po&s;ed,
and repre&s;ented, that Northumberland, who had
gained reputation by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing formerly a rebellion in
tho&s;e parts, was much more proper to command in that
enterprize. The Duke him&s;elf, who knew the &s;lender
capacity of Suffolk, began to think, that none but him|&s;elf
was able to encounter the pre&s;ent danger; and he
agreed to take on him the command of the troops.
The coun&s;ellors attended on him at his departure with
the highe&s;t prote&s;tations of attachment, and none more
than Arundel, his mortal enemy<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 161. Baker, p. 315. Hol|ling&s;hed, p. 1086.</NOTE>. As he went along,
he remarked the di&s;affection of the people, which fore|boded
a fatal i&s;&s;ue to his ambitious hopes. &startq;Many,&endq;

than he found his army, which never exceeded &s;ix thou|&s;and
men, too weak to encounter the Queen's<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 331.</NOTE>, which
<PB N="399" REF="425">
amounted to double the number. He wrote to the coun|cil,
de&s;iring them to &s;end him a reinforcement; and the
coun&s;ellors immediately laid hold of this pretence to free
them&s;elves from their confinement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lady Jane de&s;erted by the people.</NOTE> They left the
Tower, as if they meant to execute Northumberland's
commands; but being a&s;&s;embled in Baynard's-ca&s;tle, a
hou&s;e belonging to Pembroke, they deliberated concern|ing
the method of &s;haking off his u&s;urped tyranny.
Arundel began the conference, by repre&s;enting the in|ju&s;tice
and cruelty of Northumberland, the exorbitancy
of his ambition, the criminal enterprize which he had
projected, and the guilt in which he had involved the
whole council; and he a&s;&s;erted, that the only method
of making atonement for their pa&s;t offences, was by a
prompt return to the duty which they owed their lawful
&s;overeign<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 331, 332. Thuanus, lib. xiii.</NOTE>. This motion was &s;econded by Pembroke,
who, clapping his hand to his &s;word, &s;wore he was ready
to fight any man who expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of a contrary &s;en|timent.
The mayor and aldermen of London were im|mediately
&s;ent for, who di&s;covered great ala$rity in obey|ing
the orders they received to proclaim Mary. The
people expre&s;&s;ed their approbation by &s;houts of applau&s;e.
Even Suffolk, who commanded in the Tower, finding
re&s;i&s;tance fruitle&s;s, opened the gates, and declared for the
Queen. The lady Jane, after wearing the vain pa|geantry
of a crown during ten days, returned to a private
life with much more &s;atisfaction than &s;he felt when the
royalty was tendered to her<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 332. Thuanu$$ lib. xiii. c. 2.</NOTE>: And the me&s;&s;engers who
were &s;ent to Northumberland, with orders to lay down
his arms, found that he had de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s, was de|&s;erted
by all his followers, and had already proclaimed
the Queen, with exterior marks of joy and &s;atisfaction<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 612.</NOTE>.
<PB N="400" REF="426">
The people every where, on the Queen's approach to
London, gave &s;en&s;ible expre&s;&s;ions of their loyalty and at|tachment.
And the lady Elizabeth met her at the head
of a thou&s;and hor&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen proclaimed and ac|knowleged.</NOTE> which that prince&s;s had levied, in
order to &s;upport their joint title again&s;t the u&s;urper<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 240. Heylin, p. 19. Stowe, p. 613.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Queen gave orders for taking into cu&s;tody
the duke of Northumberland, who fell on his knees to the
earl of Arundel that arre&s;ted him, and abjectly begged
his life<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 239. Stowe, p. 612. Baker, p. 315. Hol|ling&s;hed, p. 1088.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time were committed, the earl of
Warwic, his elde&s;t &s;on, Ambro&s;e and Henry Dudley,
two of his younger &s;ons, Sir Andrew Dudley, his bro|ther,
the marque&s;s of Northampton, the earl of Hun|tingdon,
Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir John Gates. The
Queen afterwards confined the duke of Suffolk, the lady
Jane Gray, and lord Guilford Dudley. But Mary was
de&s;irous, in the beginning of her reign, to acquire popu|larity
by the appearance of clemency; and becau&s;e the
coun&s;ellors pleaded con&s;traint, as an excu&s;e for their
trea&s;on, &s;he extended her pardon to mo&s;t of them. Suf|folk
him&s;elf recovered his liberty; and he owed this in|dulgence,
in a great mea&s;ure, to the contempt enter|tained
of his capacity. But the guilt of Northumberland
was too great, as well as his ambition and courage too
dangerous, to permit him to entertain any rea&s;onable
hopes of life. When brought to his trial, he only de|&s;ired
permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;k two que&s;tions of the peers who
were appointed to &s;it on his jury; whether a man could
be guilty of trea&s;on who obeyed orders given him by the
council under the great &s;eal? and whether tho&s;e who
were involved in the &s;ame guilt with him&s;elf, could act
as his judges? Being told, that the great &s;eal of an
u&s;urper was no authority, and that per&s;ons who lay not
<PB N="401" REF="427">
under any &s;entence of attainder, were &s;till innocent in
the eye of the law, and might be admitted on any jury<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 243. Heylin, p. 18. Baker, p. 316. Hol|ling&s;hed, p. 1089.</NOTE>;
he acquie&s;ced, and pleaded guilty. At his execution, he
made profe&s;&s;ion of the catholic religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 Augu&s;t. Northum|berland executed.</NOTE> and told the
people, that they never would enjoy tranquillity till they
returned to the faith of their ance&s;tors: Whether that
&s;uch were his real &s;entiments, which he had formerly
concealed, from intere&s;t and ambition, or that he hoped,
by this declaration, to render the Queen more favourable
to his family<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 19. Burnet, vol. iii. p. 243. Stowe, p. 614.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir John Gates,
&s;uffered with him; and this was all the blood &s;pilt on ac|count
of &s;o dangerous and criminal an enterprize again&s;t
the rights of the &s;overeign. Sentence was pronounced
again&s;t the lady Jane and lord Guilford; but without any
pre&s;ent intention of putting it in execution. The youth
and innocence of the per&s;ons, neither of whom had
reached their &s;eventeenth year, pleaded &s;ufficiently in their
favour.</P>
<P>WHEN Mary fir&s;t arrived in the Tower, the duke of
Norfolk, who had been detained pri&s;oner during all the
la&s;t reign; Courtney, &s;on to the marque&s;s of Exeter,
who, without being charged with any crime, had been
&s;ubjected to the &s;ame puni&s;hment ever &s;ince his father's
attainder; Gardiner, Ton&s;tal, and Bonner, who had
been confined for their adherence to the catholic cau&s;e,
appeared before her, and implored her clemency and pro|tection<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 20. Stowe, p. 613. Holling&s;hed, p. 1088.</NOTE>. They were all of them re&s;tored to their li|berty,
and immediately admitted to her confidence and
favour. Norfolk's attainder, notwith&s;tanding that it had
pa&s;&s;ed in Parliament, was repre&s;ented as null and invalid;
becau&s;e, among other informalities, no &s;pecial mat|ter
<PB N="402" REF="428">
had been alleged again&s;t him, except wearing a coat
of arms, which he and his ance&s;tors, without giving
any offence, had always made u&s;e of in the face of the
court and of the whole nation. Courtney received the
title of earl of Devon&s;hire; and though educated in &s;uch
clo&s;e confinement, that he was altogether unacquainted
with the world, he &s;oon acquired all the accompli&s;hments
of a courtier and a gentleman, and made a con&s;iderable
figure during the few years which he lived after he reco|vered
his liberty. Be&s;ides performing all tho&s;e popular
acts, which, though they only regarded individuals, were
very acceptable to the nation, the Queen endeavoured to
ingratiate her&s;elf with the public, by granting a general
pardon, though with &s;ome exceptions, and by remitting
the &s;ub&s;idy voted to her brother by the la&s;t Parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 616.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE joy ari&s;ing from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the lawful
heir, and from the gracious demeanour of the &s;overeign,
hindered not the people from being agitated with great
anxiety concerning the &s;tate of religion; and as the bulk
of the nation inclined to the prote&s;tant communion, ap|prehen&s;ions
were generally entertained of the principles
and prejudices of the new Queen. The legitimacy of
Mary's birth had appeared to be &s;omewhat connected
with the papal authority; and as that prince&s;s was edu|cated
with her mother, &s;he had imbibed the &s;tronge&s;t at|tachment
to the catholic communion, and the highe&s;t
aver&s;ion to tho&s;e new tenets, whence, &s;he believed, all
the misfortunes of her family had originally &s;prung. The
di&s;couragements which &s;he lay under from her father,
though at la&s;t they brought her to comply with his will,
tended &s;till more to encrea&s;e her di&s;gu&s;t to the reformers;
and the vexations which the protector and the council
gave her, during Edward's reign, had no other effect
<PB N="403" REF="429">
than to confirm her farther in her prejudices. Naturally
of a &s;our and ob&s;tinate temper, and irritated by contra|dictions
and misfortunes, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the qualities
fitted to compo&s;e a bigot; and her extreme ignorance
rendered her utterly incapable of doubt in her own be|lief,
or of indulgence to the opinions of others. The
nation, therefore, had great rea&s;on to dread, not only
the abolition, but the per&s;ecution of the e&s;tabli&s;hed reli|gion
from the zeal of Mary; and it was not long before
&s;he di&s;covered her intentions.</P>
<P>GARDINER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Catholic religion re|&s;tored.</NOTE> Bonner, Ton&s;tal, Day, Heath, Ve&s;ey,
were rein&s;tated in their &s;ees, either by a direct act of
power, or, what is nearly the &s;ame, by the &s;entence of
commi&s;&s;ioners, who were appointed to review their pro|ce&s;s
and condemnation. Though the bi&s;hopric of Dur|ham
had been di&s;&s;olved by authority of Parliament, the
Queen erected it anew by letters-patent, and replaced
Ton&s;tal in his regalities as well as in his revenue. On
pretence of di&s;couraging controver&s;y, &s;he &s;ilenced, by her
prerogative, all the preachers throughout England, ex|cept
&s;uch as &s;hould obtain a particular licence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 23. Fox, vol. iii. p. 16. Strype's Mem. vol. iii. p. 26.</NOTE>; and it
was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that none but the catholics would be
favoured with this privilege. Holgate, archbi&s;hop of
York, Coverdale, bi&s;hop of Exeter, Ridley of London,
and Hooper of Gloce&s;ter, were thrown into pri&s;on;
whither old Latimer al&s;o was &s;ent &s;oon after<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 336.</NOTE>. The
zealous bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts were encouraged in their for|wardne&s;s
to revive the ma&s;s, though contrary to the pre|&s;ent
laws. Judge Hales, who had di&s;covered &s;uch con|&s;tancy
in defending the Queen's title, lo&s;t all his merit
by an oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e illegal practices; and being
committed to cu&s;tody, was treated with &s;uch &s;everity,
<PB N="404" REF="430">
that he fell into frenzy, and killed him&s;elf<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 247. Fox, vol. iii. p. 15, 19. Baker, p. 317.</NOTE>. The men
of Suffolk were brow-beaten, when they pre&s;umed to
plead the promi&s;e which the Queen, when they inli&s;ted
them&s;elves in her &s;ervice, had given them, of maintain|ing
the reformed religion: One, in particular, was &s;et in
the pillory, becau&s;e he had been too peremptory in re|calling
to her memory the engagements which &s;he had
taken on that occa&s;ion. And though the Queen &s;till
promi&s;ed, in a public declaration before the council, to
tolerate tho&s;e who differed from her<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol&punc; ii. p. 245.</NOTE>, men fore&s;aw, that
this engagement, like the former, would prove but a
feeble &s;ecurity, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to religious pre|judices.</P>
<P>THE merits of Cranmer towards the Queen, during
the reign of Henry, had been con&s;iderable; and he had
&s;ucce&s;sfully employed his good offices in mitigating the
&s;evere prejudices which that monarch had entertained
again&s;t her<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 240, 241. Heylin, p. 25. Godwin, p. 336.</NOTE>. But the active part which he had borne in
promoting her mother's divorce, as well as in conducting
the reformation, had made him the object of her hatred;
and though Gardiner had been equally forward in &s;olli|citing
and defending the divorce, he had afterwards
made &s;ufficient atonement by his &s;ufferings in defence of
the catholic cau&s;e. The primate, therefore, had rea&s;on
to expect little favour during the pre&s;ent reign; but it
was by his own indi&s;creet zeal, that he brought on him|&s;elf
the fir&s;t violence and per&s;ecution. A report being
&s;pread, that Cranmer, in order to make his court to the
Queen, had promi&s;ed to officiate in the Latin &s;ervice, the
archbi&s;hop, to wipe off this a&s;per&s;ion, drew up a mani|fe&s;to
in his own defence. Among other expre&s;&s;ions, he
<PB N="405" REF="431">
there &s;aid, that as the devil was a lyar from the begin|ning,
and the father of lies, &s;o he had at this time &s;tirred
up his &s;ervants to per&s;ecute Chri&s;t and his true religion;
That the infernal &s;pirit now endeavoured to re&s;tore the
Latin &s;atisfactory ma&s;&s;es, a thing of his own invention,
and device; and in order to effectuate his purpo&s;e, had
fal&s;ely made u&s;e of Cranmer's name and authority: And
that the ma&s;s is not only without foundation, either in
the Scriptures or the practice of the primitive church,

which was &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;emble. A zealous reformer<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Beale. But Fox, who lived at the time, and is very minute in his narratives, &s;ays nothing of the matter. See vol. iii. p. 16.</NOTE>
pretends, that great violence and iniquity were u&s;ed in
the elections; but be&s;ides that the authority of this wri|ter
is incon&s;iderable, that practice, as the nece&s;&s;ities of
government &s;eldom required it, had not hitherto been
often employed in England. There &s;till remained &s;uch
numbers devoted, by opinion or affection, to many prin|ciples
of the ancient religion, that the authority of the
crown was able to give &s;uch candidates the prevalence in
mo&s;t elections; and all tho&s;e who &s;crupled compliance
with the court religion, rather declined taking a &s;eat in
the hou&s;e, which, while it rendered them obnoxious to
the Queen, could afterwards afford them no protection
again&s;t the violence of prerogative. It &s;oon appeared,
therefore, that a majority of the commons would be ob|&s;equious
to Mary's de&s;igns; and as the peers were mo&s;tly
attached to the court, from intere&s;t or expectation, little
oppo&s;ition was expected from that quarter.</P>
<P>IN opening the Parliament, the court &s;howed a very
&s;ignal contempt of the laws, by celebrating, before the
two hou&s;es, a ma&s;s of the Holy Gho&s;t, in the Latin
<PB N="407" REF="433">
tongue&punc; attended with all the ancient rites and ceremo|nies,
though aboli&s;hed by act of Parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 19.</NOTE>. Taylor,
bi&s;hop of Lincoln, having refu&s;ed to kneel at this &s;er|vice,
was very &s;everely handled, and was violently thru&s;t
out of the hou&s;e<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 252.</NOTE>. The Queen, however, &s;till retained
the title of &s;upreme head of the church of England;
and it was generally pretended, that the intention of
the court was only to re&s;tore religion to the &s;ame condi|tion
in which it had been left by Henry; but that the
other abu&s;es of popery, which were chiefly grievous to
the nation, would never be revived.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t bill pa&s;&s;ed by the Parliament, was of a very
popular nature, and aboli&s;hed every &s;pecies of trea&s;on
which was not contained in the &s;tatute of Edward the
third, and every &s;pecies of felony which did not &s;ub&s;i&s;t
before the fir&s;t of Henry the eighth<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mariae, &s;e&s;&s;. i. c. 1. By this repeal, though it was in general po|pular, the clau&s;e of 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 11. was lo&s;t, which required the confronting two witne&s;&s;es, in order to prove any trea&s;on.</NOTE>. The Parliament
next declared the Queen to be legitimate, ratified the
marriage of Henry with Catherine of Arragon, and an|nulled
the divorce pronounced by Cranmer<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mariae, &s;e&s;&s;. 2. c. 1.</NOTE>, whom they
greatly blamed on that account. No mention, however,
is made of the pope's authority, as any ground of the
marriage. All the &s;tatutes of King Edward, with regard
to religion, were repealed by one vote<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">1 Mariae, &s;e&s;&s;. 2. c. 12.</NOTE>; and thereby
the national religion was replaced on the &s;ame footing on
which it &s;tood at the death of Henry. The attainder of
the duke of Norfolk was rever&s;ed; and this act of ju&s;tice
was much more rea&s;onable than the declaring that attain|der
invalid, without farther authority. Mo&s;t of the
clau&s;es of the riot act, pa&s;&s;ed in the late reign, were re|vived:
<PB N="408" REF="434">
A &s;tep which eluded, in a great mea&s;ure, the po|pular
&s;tatute enacted at the fir&s;t meeting of the Par|liament.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the compliance of the two
hou&s;es with the Queen's inclinations, they had &s;till a
re&s;erve in certain articles; and her choice of a hu&s;band
was, in particular, of &s;uch importance to national in|tere&s;t,
that they determined not to &s;ubmit tamely, in
that re&s;pect, to her will and plea&s;ure. There were three
marriages<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Thuan. $word$. ii. c. 3.</NOTE>, concerning which it was &s;uppo&s;ed that Mary
had deliberated after her acce&s;&s;ion to the crown. The
fir&s;t per&s;on propo&s;ed to her, was Courtney, earl of De|von&s;hire,
who, being an Engli&s;hman, nearly allied to
the crown, could not fail to be acceptable to the nation;
and as he was of an engaging per&s;on and addre&s;s, he had
gained vi&s;ibly on the Queen's affections, and hints were
dropt him of her favourable di&s;po&s;itions towards him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 339.</NOTE>.
But that nobleman neglected the&s;e overtures; and &s;eemed
rather to attach him&s;elf to the lady Elizabeth, who&s;e
youth and agreeable conver&s;ation he preferred to all the
power and grandeur of her &s;i&s;ter. This choice occa&s;ion|ed
a great coldne&s;s of Mary towards Devon&s;hire; and
made her break out in a declared animo&s;ity again&s;t Eli|zabeth.
The ancient quarrel between their mothers had
&s;unk deep into the malignant heart of the Queen; and
after the declaration made by Parliament in favour of
Catherine's marriage, &s;he wanted not a pretence for re|pre&s;enting
the birth of her &s;i&s;ter as illegitimate. The at|tachment
of Elizabeth to the reformed religion offended
Mary's bigotry; and as the young prince&s;s had made
&s;ome difficulty of di&s;gui&s;ing her &s;entiments, very violent
menaces had been employed to bring her to compliance.
But when the Queen round that Elizabeth had ob&s;tructed
<PB N="409" REF="435">
her views in a point, which, perhaps, touched her &s;till
more nearly, her re&s;entment, excited by pride, knew no
longer any bounds; and the prince&s;s was vi&s;ibly expo&s;ed
to the greate&s;t danger<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 31. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 255.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Pole, who had never taken prie&s;t's orders,
was another party propo&s;ed to the Queen; and there ap|peared
many rea&s;ons to induce her to make choice of
this prelate. The high character of Pole for virtue and
genero&s;ity; the great regard paid him by the catholic
church, of which he had nearly reached the highe&s;t dig|nity
on the death of Paul the third<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, book iii.</NOTE>; the Queen's af|fection
for the counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury, his mother, who
had once been her governe&s;s; the violent animo&s;ity to
which he had been expo&s;ed on account of his attachment
to the Romi&s;h communion; all the&s;e con&s;iderations had
a powerful influence on Mary. But the cardinal was
now in the decline of life; and having contracted ha|bits
of &s;tudy and retirement, he was repre&s;ented as un|qualified
for the bu&s;tle of a court, and the hurry of bu|&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 31.</NOTE>.
The Queen, therefore, dropt all views of that
alliance: But as &s;he entertained a great regard for Pole's
wi&s;dom and virtue, &s;he &s;till propo&s;ed to reap the benefit
of his advice in the admini&s;tration of her government.
She &s;ecretly entered into a negotiation with Commen|done,
an agent of cardinal Dandino, legate at Bru&s;&s;els;
&s;he &s;ent a&s;&s;urances to the pope, then Julius the third, of
her earne&s;t de&s;ire to reconcile her&s;elf and her kingdoms
to the holy &s;ee; and &s;he de&s;ired that Pole might be ap|pointed
legate for the performance of that pious office<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 258.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE two marriages being rejected, the Queen
ca&s;t her eye towards the emperor's family, from which
<PB N="410" REF="436">
her mother was de&s;cended, and which, during her own
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, had always afforded her countenance and pro|tection.
Charles the fifth, who a few years before was
almo&s;t ab&s;olute matter of Germany, had exerci&s;ed his
power in &s;uch an arbitrary manner, that he gave extreme
di&s;gu&s;t to the nation, who apprehended the total extinc|tion
of their liberties and privileges from the encroach|ments
of that monarch<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Thuanus, lib. iv. c. 17.</NOTE>. Religion had &s;erved him as a
pretence for his u&s;urpations; and from the &s;ame principle
he met with that oppo&s;ition which overthrew his gran|deur,
and da&s;hed all his ambitious hopes. Maurice,
elector of Saxony, enraged that the landgrave of He&s;&s;e,
who, by his advice, and on his a&s;&s;urances, had put him|&s;elf
into the emperor's hands, &s;hould be unju&s;tly detained
pri&s;oner, formed a &s;ecret con&s;piracy among the prote&s;tant
princes; and covering his intentions with the mo&s;t art|ful
di&s;gui&s;es, he &s;uddenly marched his forces again&s;t
Charles, and narrowly mi&s;&s;ed becoming ma&s;ter of his
per&s;on. The prote&s;tants flew to arms in every quarter;
and their in&s;urrection, aided by an inva&s;ion from France,
reduced the emperor to &s;uch extremity, that he was
obliged to &s;ubmit to articles of peace, which en&s;ured the
independency of Germany. To retrieve his honour, he
made an attack on France; and laying &s;iege to Metz,
with an army of an hundred thou&s;and men, he conducted
the enterprize in per&s;on, and &s;eemed determined, at all
hazards, to &s;ucceed in an undertaking which had at|tracted
the attention of all Europe. But the duke of
Gui&s;e, who defended Metz, with a garri&s;on compo&s;ed of
the brave&s;t nobility of France, exerted &s;uch vigilance,
conduct, and valour, that the &s;iege was protracted to the
depth of winter; and the emperor found it dangerous to
per&s;evere any longer. He retired with the remains of
<PB N="411" REF="437">
his army, into the Low Countries, much dejected with
that rever&s;e of fortune which, in his declining years, had
&s;o fatally overtaken him.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner did Charles hear of the death of Edward,
and the acce&s;&s;ion of his kin&s;woman, Mary, to the crown
of England, than he formed the &s;cheme of acquiring that
kingdom to his family; and he hoped, by this incident,
to ballance all the lo&s;&s;es which he had &s;uffered in Ger|many.
His &s;on, Philip, who was a widower, had but
one &s;on by his former marriage; and tho' he was only
twenty-&s;even years of age, eleven years younger than
the Queen, this objection, it was thought, might ea&s;ily
be overlooked, and there was no rea&s;on to de&s;pair of her
having &s;till a numerous i&s;&s;ue. The emperor, therefore,
immediately &s;ent over an agent to &s;ignify his intentions
to Mary, who, plea&s;ed with the &s;upport of &s;o powerful
an alliance, and glad to unite her&s;elf more clo&s;ely with her
mother's family, to which &s;he was ever &s;trongly attached,
readily embraced the propo&s;al. Norfolk, Arundel, and
Paget, gave their advice for the match: And Gardiner,
who was become prime mini&s;ter, and who had been pro|moted
to the office of chancellor, finding how Mary's
inclinations lay, &s;econded the project of the Spani&s;h al|liance;
and repre&s;ented, both to her and the emperor,
the nece&s;&s;ity of stopping all farther innovations in reli|gion,
till the completion of the marriage. He ob&s;erved,
that the Parliament, amid&s;t all their compliances, had
di&s;covered evident &s;ymptoms of jealou&s;y, and &s;eemed at
pre&s;ent determined, to grant no further conce&s;&s;ions in
favour of the catholic religion: That though they might
make a &s;acrifice to their Sovereign of &s;ome &s;peculative
principles, which they did not well comprehend, or of
&s;ome rites, which &s;eemed not of any immediate impor|tance,
they had imbibed &s;uch &s;trong prejudices again&s;t
<PB N="412" REF="438">
the pretended u&s;urpations and exactions of the court of
Rome, that they would with great difficulty be again
brought to &s;ubmit to its authority: That the danger of
making a re&s;umption of the abbey lands, would alarm
the nobility and gentry, and induce them to encourage
the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which were but too general among the
people, again&s;t the doctrine and wor&s;hip of the catholic
church: That much pains had been taken to prejudice
the nation again&s;t the Spani&s;h alliance; and if that point
was urged, at the &s;ame time with further changes in re|ligion,
it would hazard a general revolt and in&s;urrection:
That the marriage, being once compleated, would give
authority to the Queen's mea&s;ures, and enable her after|wards
to forward that pious work, in which &s;he was en|gaged:
And that it was even nece&s;&s;ary previou&s;ly to re|concile
the people to the marriage, by rendering the
conditions extremely favourable to the Engli&s;h, and &s;uch
as would &s;eem to en&s;ure to them their independency, and
the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ancient laws and privi|leges<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 261.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE emperor, well acquainted with the prudence and
experience of Gardiner, a&s;&s;ented to all the&s;e rea&s;ons; and
he endeavoured to temper the zeal of Mary, by repre|&s;enting
the nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding gradually in the great
work of converting the nation. Hearing that cardinal
Pole, more &s;incere in his religious opinions, and le&s;s
guided by the maxims of civil policy, after having &s;ent
oppo&s;ite advice to the Queen, had &s;et out on his journey
to England, where he was to exerci&s;e his legantine com|mi&s;&s;ion;
he thought proper to &s;top him at Dillinghen, a
town on the Danube; and he afterwards obtained Mary's
con&s;ent for this detention. The negociation for the mar|riage
mean-while proceeded apace; and Mary's intentions
<PB N="413" REF="439">
to e&s;pou&s;e Philip became generally known to the nation.
The commons, who hoped that they had gained the
Queen by the conce&s;&s;ions which they had already made,
were alarmed to hear, that &s;he was re&s;olved to contract a
foreign alliance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Decem|ber.</NOTE> and they &s;ent a committee to remon|&s;trate
again&s;t that dangerous mea&s;ure. To prevent far|ther
applications of the &s;ame kind, &s;he thought proper
to di&s;&s;olve them.</P>
<P>A CONVOCATION had been &s;ummoned at the &s;ame
time with the Parliament; and the majority here al&s;o ap|peared
to be of the court religion. An offer was very
frankly made by the Romani&s;ts, to di&s;pute concerning
the points controverted between the two communions;
and as tran&s;ub&s;tantiation was the article which, of all
others, they deemed the cleare&s;t, and founded on the
mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible argument, they cho&s;e to try their &s;trength
by defending it. The prote&s;tants pu&s;hed the di&s;pute as
far as the clamour and noi&s;e of their antagoni&s;ts would
permit; and they fondly imagined, that they had obtained
&s;ome advantage, when, in the cour&s;e of the debate, they
obliged the catholics to avow, that, according to their
doctrine, Chri&s;t had, in his la&s;t &s;upper, held him&s;elf in
his hand, and had &s;wallowed and eat him&s;elf<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 356. Fox, vol. iii. p. 22.</NOTE>. This
triumph, however, was confined only to their own party:
The Romani&s;ts maintained, that their champions had
clearly the better of the day; that their adver&s;aries were
blind and ob&s;tinate heretics; that nothing but the mo&s;t
extreme depravity of heart could induce men to conte&s;t
&s;uch &s;elf-evident principles; and that the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;h|ments
were due to their perver&s;e wickedne&s;s. So plea&s;ed
were they with their &s;uperiority in this favourite point,
that they &s;oon after renewed the di&s;pute at Oxford; and
to &s;how, that they feared no force of learning or capacity,
<PB N="414" REF="440">
where rea&s;on was &s;o evidently on their &s;ide, they &s;ent
thither Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, under a guard,
to try whether the&s;e renowned controver&s;iali&s;ts could find
any appearance of argument to defend their baffled prin|ciples<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mem. Cran. p. 354. Heylin, p. 50.</NOTE>.
The i&s;&s;ue of the debate was very different from
what it appeared to be a few years before, in a famous
conference held at the &s;ame place during the reign of
Edward.</P>
<P>AFTER the Parliament and convocation were broke up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1554.</NOTE>
the new laws with regard to religion, though they had
been anticipated, in mo&s;t places, by the zeal of the ca|tholics,
countenanced by the government, were &s;till more
openly put in execution: The ma&s;s was every where re|e&s;tabli&s;hed;
and marriage was declared to be incompatible
with any &s;piritual office. It has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome
writers, that three fourths of the clergy were, at this
time, deprived of their livings; though other hi&s;torians,
more accurate<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Harmer, p. 138.</NOTE>, have e&s;timated the number of &s;ufferers
to be far &s;hort of this proportion. Could any principles
of law, ju&s;tice or rea&s;on be attended to, where &s;uper&s;tition
predominates; the prie&s;ts would never have been expelled
for their pa&s;t marriages, which at that time were permit|ted
by the laws of the kingdom. A vi&s;itation was ap|pointed,
in order to re&s;tore more perfectly the ma&s;s and
the antient rites. Among other articles the commi&s;&s;ioners
were enjoined to forbid the oath of &s;upremacy to be taken
by the clergy on their receiving any benefice<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Collier, vol. ii. p. 364. Fox, vol. iii. p. 38. Heylin, p. 35. Sleidan, lib. 25.</NOTE>. It is to
be ob&s;erved, that this oath had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the
laws of Henry the eighth, which were &s;till in force.</P>
<P>THIS violent and &s;udden change of religion in&s;pired
the prote&s;tants with great di&s;content; and even affected
<PB N="415" REF="441">
indifferent &s;pectators with concern, by the hard&s;hips, to
which &s;o many individuals were on that account expo&s;ed.
But the Spani&s;h match was a point of more general
concern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen's marriage with Phi|lip.</NOTE> and diffu&s;ed univer&s;al apprehen&s;ions for the
liberty and independance of the nation. To obviate all
clamour, the articles of marriage were drawn as favour|able
as po&s;&s;ible for the intere&s;t and &s;ecurity, and even
grandeur of England. It was agreed, that tho' Philip
&s;hould have the title of King, the admini&s;tration &s;hould
be entirely in the Queen; that no foreigner &s;hould be
capable of enjoying any office in the kingdom; that no
innovation &s;hould be made in the Engli&s;h laws, cu&s;toms
and privileges; that Philip &s;hould not carry the Queen
abroad without her con&s;ent, nor any of her children
without the con&s;ent of the nobility; that &s;ixty thou&s;and
pounds a year &s;hould be &s;ettled on her as her jointure;
that the male i&s;&s;ue of this marriage &s;hould inherit, to|gether
with England, both Burgundy and the Low
Countries; and that, if Don Carlos, Philip's &s;on by his
former marriage, &s;hould die and his line be extinct, the
Queen's i&s;&s;ue, whether male or female, &s;hould inherit
Spain, Sicily, Milan, and all the other dominions of
Philip<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, xv. p. 377.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Jan.</NOTE> Such was the treaty of marriage &s;igned by
count Egmont, and four other amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent over to
England by the emperor.</P>
<P>THESE articles when publi&s;hed, gave no &s;atisfaction
to the nation: It was univer&s;ally &s;aid, that the emperor,
in order to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of England, would verbally agree
to any terms; and the greater advantage there appeared
in the conditions which he granted, the more certainly
might it be concluded, that he had no &s;erious intention
of observing them: That the u&s;ual fraud and ambition
of that monarch might a&s;&s;ure the nation of &s;uch a con|duct;

and his &s;on Philip, while he inherited the&s;e vices
from his father, added to them tyranny, &s;ullenne&s;s, pride,
and barbarity, more dangerous vices of his own: That
England would become a province, and a province to a
kingdom which u&s;ually exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t violent autho|rity
over all her dependant dominions: That the Nether|lands,
Milan, Sicily, Naples groaned under the burthen
of Spani&s;h tyranny; and throughout all the new con|que&s;ts
in America there had been di&s;played &s;cenes of un|relenting
cruelty, hitherto unknown in the hi&s;tory of
mankind: That the inqui&s;ition was a tribunal invented
by that tyrannical nation; and would infallibly, with all
their other laws and in&s;titutions, be introduced into Eng|land:
And that the divided &s;entiments of the people with
regard to religion would &s;ubject multitudes to this ini|quitous
tribunal, and would reduce the whole nation to
the mo&s;t abject &s;ervitude<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 32. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 268. Godwin, p. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE complaints, being diffu&s;ed through the whole
people, prepared the nation for a rebellion; and had any
foreign power given them encouragement, or any great
man appeared to head them; the con&s;equences might
have proved fatal to the Queen's authority. But the
King of France, though engaged in ho&s;tilities with the
emperor, refu&s;ed to concur in any propo&s;al for an in&s;ur|rection,
le&s;t he &s;hould afford Mary a pretence for declar|ing
war again&s;t him. And the more prudent part of the
nobility thought, that, as the evils of the Spani&s;h alliance
were only dreaded at a di&s;tance, matters were not yet
fully prepared for a general revolt. Some per&s;ons, how|ever,
more turbulent than the re&s;t, believed, that it would
be &s;afer to prevent than to redre&s;s grievances; and they
framed a con&s;piracy to ri&s;e in arms, and declare again&s;t
the Queen's marriage with Philip, Sir Thomas Wiat
<PB N="417" REF="445">
propo&s;ed to rai&s;e Kent, Sir Peter Carew, Devon&s;hire;
and they engaged the duke of Suffolk, by the hopes of
recovering the crown for the lady Jane, to attempt rai&s;ing
the midland counties<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 33. Godwin, p. 340.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wiat's in|&s;urrection.</NOTE>. Carew's impatience or appre|hen&s;ions
engaged him to break the concert, and to ri&s;e
in arms before the day appointed: He was &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
by the earl of Bedford, and obliged to fly into France.
On this intelligence, Suffolk, dreading an arre&s;t, &s;ud|denly
left the town, with his brothers, the lord Thomas,
and lord Leonard Grey; and endeavoured to rai&s;e the
people in the counties of Warwic and Leice&s;ter; where
his intere&s;t lay: But he was &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the earl
of Huntingdon, at the head of 300 hor&s;e, that he was
obliged to di&s;per&s;e his retainers, and being di&s;covered in
his retreat, he was led pri&s;oner to London<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 30.</NOTE>. Wiat was
at fir&s;t more &s;ucce&s;sful in his attempt; and having pub|li&s;hed
a declaration at Maid&s;tone in Kent, again&s;t the
Queen's evil coun&s;ellors and again&s;t the Spani&s;h match,
without any mention, of religion, the people began to
gather under his &s;tandard. The duke of Norfolk with
Sir Henry Jernegan was &s;ent again&s;t him, at the head of
the guards and &s;ome other troops, reinforced with 500
Londoners commanded by Bret: And he came within
&s;ight of the rebels at Roche&s;ter, where they had fixed
their head quarters. Sir George Harper hare pretended
to de&s;ert from them; but having &s;ecretly gained Bret,
the&s;e two per&s;ons &s;o wrought on the Londoners, that that
whole body de&s;erted to Wiat, and declared that they
would not contribute to en&s;lave their native country.
Norfolk, dreading the contagion of this example, im|mediately
retreated with his troops and took &s;helter in
London<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 33. $word$ Godwin, p. 341. Stowe, p. 619. Baker, p. 318. Holling&s;hed, p. 1094.</NOTE>.</P>

AFTER this proof of the di&s;po&s;itions of the people,
e&s;pecially of the Londoners, who were mo&s;tly prote&s;tants,
Wiat was encouraged to proceed; and he led his forces
to Southwark, where he required of the Queen, that &s;he
&s;hould put the Tower into his hands, &s;hould deliver four
coun&s;ellers as ho&s;tages, and in order to en&s;ure the liberty
of the nation, &s;hould immediately marry an Engli&s;hman.
Finding that the bridge was &s;ecured again&s;t him, and that
the city was over-awed, he marched up to King&s;ton,
where he pa&s;&s;ed the river with 4000 men; and returning
towards London, hoped to encourage his partizans, who
had engaged to declare for him. He had imprudently
wa&s;ted &s;o much time at Southwark, and in his march from
King&s;ton, that the critical &s;ea&s;on, on which all popular
commotions depend, was entirely lo&s;t; and though he
entered We&s;tmin&s;ter without re&s;i&s;tance, his followers,
finding that no per&s;on of note joined him, in&s;en&s;ibly fell
off, and he was at la&s;t &s;eized near Temple-Bar by Sir
Maurice Berkley<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 31. Heylin, p. 34. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 270. Stowe, p. 621.</NOTE>. Above &s;eventy per&s;ons &s;uffered for
this rebellion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Febr.</NOTE> Four hundred were conducted before
the Queen with ropes about their necks; and falling on
their knees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tion &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> received a pardon, and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Wiat
was condemned and executed; and as it had been report|ed,
that on his examination, he had accu&s;ed the lady
Elizabeth and the earl of Devon&s;hire as accomplices, he
took care on the &s;caffold, before the whole people, fully
to acquit them of having any &s;hare in his rebellion.</P>
<P>THE lady Elizabeth had been, during &s;ome time,
treated with great har&s;hne&s;s by her &s;i&s;ter; and many
&s;tudied in&s;tances of di&s;couragement and di&s;re&s;pect had
been practi&s;ed again&s;t her. She was ordered to take place
at court after the counte&s;s of Lenox and the dutche&s;s of
<PB N="419" REF="449">
Suffolk, as if &s;he were not legitimate: Her friends were
di&s;countenanced on every occa&s;ion: And while her vir|tues,
which were now become very eminent, drew to
her the attendance of all the young nobility, and rendered
her the favourite of the nation, the malevolence of the
Queen &s;till di&s;covered it&s;elf every day by fre&s;h &s;ymptoms,
and obliged the Prince&s;s to retire into the country. Marry
&s;eized the opportunity of this rebellion; and hoping to
involve her &s;i&s;ter in &s;ome appearance of guilt, &s;ent for her
under a &s;trong guard, committed her to the Tower, and
ordered her to be very &s;trictly examined by the council.
But the public declaration made by Wiat rendered it im|practicable
to employ again&s;t her any fal&s;e evidence, which
might have offered; and the Prince&s;s made &s;o good a
defence, that the Queen found her&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of
di&s;mi&s;&s;ing her<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 343. Burnet, vol. iii. p. 273. Fox, vol. iii. p. 99, 105. Strype's Mem. vol. iii. p. 85.</NOTE>. In order to &s;end her out of the kingdom,
a marriage was propo&s;ed to her with the duke of Savoy;
and when &s;he declined giving her con&s;ent, &s;he was com|mitted
to cu&s;tody, under a very &s;trong guard, at Wode|&s;toke.
The earl of Devon&s;hire, tho' equally innocent,
was confined in Fotheringay ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>BUT this rebellion proved &s;till more fatal to the lady
Jane Gray, as well as to her hu&s;band: The duke of Suf|folk's
guilt was imputed to her; and tho' the rebels and
malecontents &s;eemed chiefly to re&s;t their hopes on the lady
Elizabeth and the earl of Devon&s;hire, the Queen, inca|pable
of genero&s;ity or clemency, determined to remove
every per&s;on, from whom the lea&s;t danger could be ap|prehended.
Warning was given the lady Jane to prepare
for death; a doom which &s;he had long expected, and
which the innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes
to which &s;he had been expo&s;ed, rendered no unwelcome
<PB N="420" REF="450">
news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under colour
of tender mercy to the pri&s;oner's &s;oul, induced her to
&s;end divines, who mole&s;ted her with perpetual di&s;puta|tion;
and even a reprieve of three days was granted her,
in hopes that &s;he would be per&s;uaded, during that time,
to pay, by a timely conver&s;ion, &s;ome regard to her eter|nal
welfare. The lady Jane had pre&s;ence of mind, in
tho&s;e melancholy circum&s;tances, not only to defend her
religion by all the topics then in u&s;e, but al&s;o to write a
letter to her &s;i&s;ter<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 35. Heylin, p. 166.</NOTE> in the Greek language; in which,
be&s;ides &s;ending her a copy of the Scriptures in that tongue,
&s;he exhorted her to maintain, in every fortune, a like
&s;teady per&s;everance. On the day of her execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th Febr.</NOTE> her hu&s;band, the lord Guilford, de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her;
but &s;he refu&s;ed her con&s;ent, and &s;ent him word, that the
tenderne&s;s of their parting would overcome the fortitude
of both, and would too much unbend their minds from
that con&s;tancy, which their approaching end required of
them: Their &s;eparation, &s;he &s;aid, would be only for a
moment; and they would &s;oon rejoin each other in a
&s;cene, where their affections would be for ever united,
and where death, di&s;appointment, and misfortunes could
no longer have acce&s;s to them, or di&s;turb their eternal
felicity<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167. Baker, p. 319.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT had been intended to execute the lady Jane and lord
Guilford together on the &s;ame &s;caffold at Tower-hill;
but the council, dreading the compa&s;&s;ion of the people
for their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble birth,
changed their orders, and gave directions that &s;he &s;hould
be beheaded within the verge of the Tower. She &s;aw
her hu&s;band led to execution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of lady Jane Gray.</NOTE> and having given him from
the window &s;ome token of her remembrance, &s;he waited
<PB N="421" REF="451">
with tranquillity till her own appointed hour &s;hould bring
her to a like fate. She even &s;aw his headle&s;s body carried
back in a cart; and found her&s;elf more confirmed by the
reports, which &s;he heard of the con&s;tancy of his end,
than &s;haken by &s;o tender and melancholy a &s;pectacle. Sir
John Gage, con&s;table of the Tower, when he led her to
execution, de&s;ired her to be&s;tow on him &s;ome &s;mall pre|&s;ent,
which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of
her: She gave him her table-book, where &s;he had ju&s;t
wrote three &s;entences on &s;eeing her hu&s;band's dead body;
one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in Engli&s;h<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167.</NOTE>.
The purport of them was, that human ju&s;tice was
again&s;t his body, but the divine mercy would be favour|able
to his &s;oul; and that if her fault de&s;erved puni&s;h|ment,
her youth at lea&s;t, and her imprudence were wor|thy
of excu&s;e; and that God and po&s;terity, &s;he tru&s;ted,
would &s;how her favour. On the &s;caffold, &s;he made a
&s;peech to the bye-&s;tanders, in which the mildne&s;s of her
di&s;po&s;ition led her to take the blame entirely on her&s;elf,
without uttering one complaint again&s;t the &s;everity, with
which &s;he had been treated. She &s;aid, that her offence
was not the having laid her hand upon the crown, but
the not rejecting it with &s;ufficient con&s;tancy: That &s;he
had le&s;s erred through ambition than through reverence
to her parents, whom &s;he had been taught to re&s;pect and
obey: That &s;he willingly received death, as the only
&s;atisfaction which &s;he could now make to the injured
&s;tate; and though her infringement of the laws had been
con&s;trained, &s;he would &s;how, by her voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to their &s;entence, that &s;he was de&s;irous to attone for that
di&s;obedience, into which too much filial piety had be|trayed
her: That &s;he had ju&s;tly de&s;erved this puni&s;h|ment
for being made the in&s;trument, though the unwilling
<PB N="422" REF="452">
in&s;trument, of the ambition of others: And that the &s;tory
of her life, &s;he hoped, might at lea&s;t be u&s;eful, by prov|ing
that innocence excu&s;es not great mi&s;deeds, if they
tend any way to the de&s;truction of the commonwealth.
After uttering the&s;e words, &s;he cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be di&s;|robed
by her women; and with a &s;teddy &s;erene counte|nance
&s;ubmitted her&s;elf to the executioner<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 167. Fox, vol. iii. p. 36, 37. Holling&s;hed, p. 1099.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Suffolk was tried, condemned, and exe|cuted
&s;oon after; and would have met with more com|pa&s;&s;ion,
had not his temerity been the cau&s;e of his daugh|ter's
untimely death. The lord Thomas Grey lo&s;t his life
for the &s;ame crime. Sir Nicholas Throcmorton was tried
in Guildhall; but there appearing no &s;atisfactory evidence
again&s;t him, he was able, by making an admirable de|fence,
to obtain a verdict of the jury in his favour. The
Queen was &s;o enraged at this di&s;appointment, that, in|&s;tead
of relea&s;ing him as the law required, &s;he re-com|mitted
him to the Tower, and kept him in clo&s;e confine|ment
during &s;ome time. But her re&s;entment &s;topped not
here: The jury, being &s;ummoned before the council,
were all of them &s;ent to pri&s;on, and afterwards fined,
&s;ome of them a thou&s;and pounds, others two thou&s;and
a-piece<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 99. Stowe, p. 624. Baker, p. 320. Holling|&s;hed, p. 1104, 1121. Strype, vol. iii. p. 120.</NOTE>. This illegal violence proved fatal to &s;everal,
among others to Sir John Throcmorton, brother to Sir
Nicholas, who was condemned on no better evidence
than had been formerly rejected. The Queen filled the
Tower and all the pri&s;ons with nobility and gentry, whom
their intere&s;t with the people, rather than any appearance
of guilt, had made the objects of her &s;u&s;picion. And
finding, that &s;he was become extremely odious to the
nation, &s;he was re&s;olved to di&s;able them from re&s;i&s;tance,
by ordering general mu&s;ters, and directing the commi&s;|&s;ioners
<PB N="423" REF="453">
to &s;eize their arms, and lay them up in forts and
ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>THOUGH the government laboured under &s;o general
an odium, the Queen's authority had received &s;uch an
increa&s;e from the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Wiat's rebellion, that the
mini&s;try hoped to find a very compliant di&s;po&s;ition in the
new Parliament, which was &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;emble. The
emperor al&s;o, in order to facilitate the &s;ame end, had
borrowed no le&s;s a &s;um than 400,000 pounds;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment. 5th April.</NOTE> which he had
&s;ent over to England, to be di&s;tributed in bribes and pen&s;ions
among the members: A pernicious practice, of which
there had not hitherto been any in&s;tance in England.
And not to give the public any alarm with regard to
the church lands, the Queen, notwith&s;tanding her bigotry,
re&s;umed her legal title of &s;upreme head of the church,
which &s;he had dropped three months before. Gardiner,
the chancellor, opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion by a &s;peech; in
which he a&s;&s;erted the Queen's hereditary title to the
crown; maintained her right to choo&s;e a hu&s;band for
her&s;elf; ob&s;erved how proper an u&s;e &s;he had made of that
right, by preferring an old ally, de&s;cended from the
hou&s;e of Burgundy; and remarked the failure of Henry
the eighth's po&s;terity, of whom there now remained none
but the Queen and the lady Elizabeth. He added,
that, in order to obviate the inconveniences, which
might ari&s;e from different pretenders, it was nece&s;&s;ary
to inve&s;t the Queen, by law, with a power of di&s;po&s;ing
of the crown, and of appointing her &s;ucce&s;&s;or: A power,
he &s;aid, which was not to be regarded as a new thing in
England, &s;ince it had formerly been conferred on Henry
the eighth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Carte, vol. iii. p. 310, from Amba&s;&s;. de No$illes.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Parliament were much di&s;po&s;ed to gratify the
Queen in all her de&s;ires; but when the liberty, indepen|dency,
and very being of the nation were brought into

&s;uch vi&s;ible danger, they could not by any means $word$
brought to compliance. They knew both the inveterate
hatred which &s;he bore the lady Elizabeth, and her devoted
attachment to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: They were acquainted
with her extreme bigotry, which would lead her to po&s;t|pone
all con&s;iderations of ju&s;tice or national intere&s;t to
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the catholic religion: They remark|ed,
that Gardiner had carefully avoided, in his &s;peech,
the giving to Elizabeth the appellation of the Queen's
&s;i&s;ter; and they thence concluded, that a de&s;ign was formed
of excluding her as illegitimate: They expected, that
Mary, if inve&s;ted with &s;uch a power as &s;he required,
would make a will in her hu&s;band's favour, and thereby
render England for ever a province of the Spani&s;h mo|narchy:
And they were the more alarmed with the&s;e
projects, when they heard, that Philip's de&s;cent from the
hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter was carefully in&s;i&s;ted on, and that he
was publicly repre&s;ented as the true and only heir by right
of inheritance.</P>
<P>THE Parliament, therefore, aware of their danger,
were determined to keep at a di&s;tance from the precipice,
which lay before them. They could not avoid ratifying
the articles of marriage<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 2.</NOTE>, which were drawn very favour|able
for England; but they declined pa&s;&s;ing any &s;uch law
as the chancellor pointed out to them: They would not
&s;o much as declare it trea&s;on to imagine or attempt the
death of the Queen's hu&s;band, while &s;he was alive; and
a bill introduced for that purpo&s;e was laid a&s;ide after the
fir&s;t reading. The more effectually to cut off Philip's
hopes of exerting any authority in England, they pa&s;&s;ed
a law, in which they declared, &startq;that her maje&s;ty as their
only Queen, &s;hould &s;olely and as a &s;ole Queen, enjoy
<PB N="425" REF="457">
the crown and &s;overeignty of her realms, with all the
pre-eminences, dignities, and rights thereto belong|ing,
in as large and ample a manner after her mar|riage
as before, without any title or claim accruing to
the prince of Spain, either as tenant by courte&s;y of the
realm, or by any other means<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. I.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>A LAW pa&s;&s;ed in this Parliament for re-erecting the
bi&s;hopric of Durham, which had been di&s;&s;olved by the
la&s;t Parliament of Edward<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ib. cap. 3.</NOTE>. The Queen had already,
by an exertion of her ab&s;olute power, put Ton&s;tal in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that &s;ee: But tho' it was u&s;ual at that time
for the crown to a&s;&s;ume authority which might &s;eem
entirely legi&s;lative, it was always deemed more &s;afe and
&s;atisfactory to procure the &s;anction of Parliament. Bills
were introduced for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing erroneous opinions con|tained
in books, and for reviving the law of the &s;ix ar|ticles,
together with tho&s;e again&s;t the Lollards, again&s;t
here&s;y and erroneous preaching: But none of the&s;e laws
could pa&s;s the two hou&s;es. A proof, that the Parliament
had re&s;erves even in their conce&s;&s;ions with regard to re|ligion;
about which they &s;eem to have been le&s;s &s;crupu|lous.
The Queen, therefore, finding that they would
not &s;erve all her purpo&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th May.</NOTE> fini&s;hed the &s;e&s;&s;ion by di&s;&s;olving
them.</P>
<P>MARY's thoughts were now entirely employed about re|ceiving
Don Philip, who&s;e arrival &s;he hourly expected.
This prince&s;s, who had lived &s;o many years in a very re|&s;erved
and private manner, without any pro&s;pect or hopes
of a hu&s;band, was &s;o &s;mit with affection for her young
&s;pou&s;e, whom &s;he had never &s;een, that &s;he waited with
the utmo&s;t impatience for the completion of the marriage;
<PB N="426" REF="458">
and every ob&s;tacle was to her a &s;ource of anxiety and di&s;|content<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Strype, vol. iii. p. 125.</NOTE>. She complained of Philip's delays as affected;
and &s;he could not conceal her vexation, that, though &s;he
brought him a kingdom as a dowry, he treated her with
&s;uch neglect, that he had never yet favoured her with a
&s;ingle letter. Her fondne&s;s was but the more encrea&s;ed
by this &s;upercilious treatment; and when &s;he found that
her &s;ubjects had entertained the greate&s;t aver&s;ion for the
event, to which &s;he directed her fonde&s;t wi&s;hes, &s;he made
the whole Engli&s;h nation the object of her re&s;entment.
A &s;quadron, under the command of lord E&s;&s;ingham, had
been fitted out to convoy Philip from Spain, where he
then re&s;ided; but the admiral informing her, that the
di&s;contents ran very high among the &s;eamen, and that
it was not &s;afe for Philip to entru&s;t him&s;elf into their
hands, &s;he gave orders to di&s;mi&s;s them. She then dread|ed,
that the French fleet, being ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, might
intercept her hu&s;band; and every rumour of danger, every
bla&s;t of wind, threw her into panics and convul&s;ions.
Her health, and even her under&s;tanding, were vi&s;ibly
impaired by this extreme impatience; and &s;he was &s;truck
with a new apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t her per&s;on, impaired by
time, and bla&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hould render her le&s;s ac|ceptable
to her future &s;pou&s;e. Her gla&s;s di&s;covered to
her how hagard &s;he was become, and when &s;he remarked
the decay of her per&s;on, &s;he knew not whether &s;he ought
more to de&s;ire or apprehend the arrival of Philip.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t came the moment &s;o impatiently expected;
and news were brought the Queen of Philip's arrival at
Southampton<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 99. Heylin, p. 39. Burnet, vol. iii. p. 392. Godwin, p. 345.

was ill calculated to cure the prejudices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th July. Philip's ar|rival in England.</NOTE> which the Eng|li&s;h

him the more acceptable to the Queen, who de&s;ired to

<P>THE Queen &s;oon found, that Philip's ruling pa&s;&s;ion

con&s;iderations of &s;mall moment, in compari&s;on of her
obtaining this favourite point. She &s;ummoned a new
Parliament, in hopes of finding them entirely compliant;
and that &s;he might acquire the greater authority over
them, &s;he imitated the precedent of the former reign,
and wrote circular letters directing a proper choice of

her a hou&s;e of commons which was, in a great mea&s;ure,
to her &s;atisfaction; and it was thought, from the di&s;po&s;i|tion
of the nation, that &s;he might now &s;afely omit, in
her &s;ummons of the Parliament, the title of <HI>&s;upreme head
of the church,</HI> though in&s;eparably annexed by law to the
crown of England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 291. Strype, vol. iii. p. 155.</NOTE>. Cardinal Pole was arrived in Flan|ders,
inve&s;ted with legantine power from the pope: In
order to prepare the way for his arrival in England, the
Parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act, rever&s;ing his attainder, and re|&s;toring
his blood; and the Queen, di&s;pen&s;ing with the old
&s;tatute of provi&s;ors, granted him permi&s;&s;ion to act as le|gate.
The cardinal came over to London; and after
being introduced to the King and Queen, he invited the
Parliament to reconcile them&s;elves and the kingdom to
the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, from which they had been &s;o long and
&s;o unhappily &s;eparated. This me&s;&s;age was taken in good
part: and both hou&s;es voted an addre&s;s to Philip and
Mary, acknowledging that they had been guilty of a mo&s;t
horrible defection from the true church; profe&s;&s;ing a &s;in|cere
repentance for their pa&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; declaring
their re&s;olution to repeal all laws enacted in prejudice of
the church of Rome; and praying their maje&s;ties, that
&s;ince they were happily uninfected with that criminal
&s;chi&s;m, they would intercede with the holy father for
their ab&s;olution and forgivene&s;s<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 3. Heylin, p. 42. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 293. Godwin, p. 247.</NOTE>. Their reque&s;t was
ea&s;ily granted. The legate, in name of his holine&s;s,
gave the Parliament and kingdom ab&s;olution, freed them
from all cen&s;ures, and received them again into the bo&s;om
of the church. The pope, then Julius the third, being
informed of the&s;e tran&s;actions, &s;aid, that it was an un|exampled
in&s;tance of his felicity, to receive thanks from

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the extreme zeal of tho&s;e times,
for and again&s;t popery, the object always uppermo&s;t with
the nobility and gentry, was their money and e&s;tates;
and they were not brought to make the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions in
favour of Rome, till they had received repeated a&s;&s;ur|ances,
from the pope as well as the Queen, that the
plunder which they had made of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &s;hould
never be enquired into; and that the abbey and church
lands &s;hould remain with the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 41.</NOTE>. But
not tru&s;ting altogether to the&s;e promi&s;es, the Parliament
took care, in the law it&s;elf<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 8.</NOTE>, by which they repealed the
former &s;tatutes enacted again&s;t the pope's authority, to
in&s;ert a clau&s;e, in which, be&s;ides be&s;towing validity on
all marriages celebrated during the &s;chi&s;m, and fixing the
right of incumbents to their benefices, they gave &s;ecurity
to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of church lands, and freed them from
all danger of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures. The convocation
al&s;o, in order to remove all apprehen&s;ions on that head,
were induced to pre&s;ent a petition to the &s;ame purpo&s;e<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 43. I &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 8. Strype, vol. iii. p. 159.</NOTE>;
and the legate, in his ma&s;ter's name, ratified all the&s;e
tran&s;actions. It now appeared, that, notwith&s;tanding the
efforts of the Queen and King, the power of the papacy
was effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and invincible barriers fixed
again&s;t its re-e&s;tabli&s;hment. For though the juri&s;diction
of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics was, for the pre&s;ent, re&s;tored, their
property, on which their power much depended, was ir|retrievably
lo&s;t, and no hopes remained of recovering it.
Even the&s;e arbitrary, powerful, and bigotted princes,
while the tran&s;actions were yet recent, could not regain

to the church her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;o lately ravi&s;hed from her;

and which had required many ages of ignorance, barba|ri&s;m,
and &s;uper&s;tition to operate their effect on man|kind<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The pope at fir&s;t gave cardinal Pole powers to tran&s;act only with regard to the pa&s;t fruits of the church lands; but being admoni&s;hed of the danger attending any attempt towards a re&s;umption of the lands, he enlarged the cardinal's power, and granted him authority to en&s;ure the future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church lands to the pre&s;ent proprietors. There was only one clau&s;e in the cardinal's powers that has given oc|ca&s;ion for &s;ome &s;peculation.

<P>THE Parliament having &s;ecured their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
were more indifferent with regard to religion, or even
the lives of their fellow-citizens; and they revived the
old &s;anguinary laws again&s;t heretics<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">I &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 6.</NOTE>, which had been
rejected in the former Parliament. They al&s;o enacted

they made it trea&s;on to imagine or attempt the death of
Philip, during his marriage with the Queen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">I &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 10.</NOTE>. Each
Parliament hitherto had been induced to go a &s;tep farther
than their predece&s;&s;ors; but none of them had entirely
lo&s;t all regard to national intere&s;ts. Their hatred again&s;t
the Spaniards, as well as their &s;u&s;picion of Philip's pre|ten&s;ions,
&s;till prevailed; and though the Queen attempted
to get her hu&s;band declared pre&s;umptive heir of the crown,

failed in all her hopes, and could not &s;o much as procure
the Parliament's con&s;ent to his coronation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 348. Baker, p. 322.</NOTE>. All at|tempts
likewi&s;e to obtain &s;ub&s;idies from the commons, in
order to &s;upport the emperor in his war again&s;t France,
proved fruitle&s;s; and the u&s;ual animo&s;ity and jealou&s;y of
the Engli&s;h again&s;t that kingdom, &s;eemed to have given
place, for the pre&s;ent, to like pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t Spain.
Philip, &s;en&s;ible of the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions entertained again&s;t
him, endeavoured to acquire popularity by procuring the
relea&s;e of &s;everal pri&s;oners of di&s;tinction; the lord Henry
Dudley, Sir George Harper, Sir Nicholas Throcmorton,
Sir Edmond Warner, Sir William St. Lo, Sir Nicholas
Arnold, Harrington, Tremaine, who had been confined
from the &s;u&s;picions or re&s;entment of the court<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 39. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 287. Stowe, p. 626.</NOTE>. But
nothing was more agreeable to the nation than his protec|tion
of the lady Elizabeth, from the &s;pite and malice of
the Queen, and the re&s;toring her to liberty. This mea|&s;ure
was not the effect of any genero&s;ity in Philip, a &s;en|timent
of which he was wholly incapable; but of a re|fined
policy, which made him fore&s;ee, that, if that prince&s;s
were put to death, the next lawful heir was the Queen
of Scots, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would for ever annex England
to the crown of France. The earl of Devon&s;hire al&s;o
reaped &s;ome benefit from the affected popularity of Philip,
and recovered his liberty: But that nobleman, finding
him&s;elf expo&s;ed to &s;u&s;picion, begged permi&s;&s;ion to travel<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 40. Godwin, p. 349.</NOTE>;
and he &s;oon after died in Padua, from poi&s;on, as is pre|tended,
given him by the Imperiali&s;ts. He was the
eleventh and la&s;t earl of Devon&s;hire of that noble family,
allied to the royal family of France.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="464">
THE Queen's extreme de&s;ire of having i&s;&s;ue, had made
her fondly give credit to any appearance of her pregnancy;
and when the legate was introduced to her, &s;he fancied,
that &s;he felt the embryo &s;tir in her womb. Her flatterers
compared this motion of the infant to that of John the
Bapti&s;t, who leaped in his mother's belly at the &s;alutation
of the virgin<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 292. Godwin, p. 348.</NOTE>. Di&s;patches were immediately &s;ent to in|form
foreign courts of this event: Orders were i&s;&s;ued to
give public thanks: Great rejoicings were made: The
family of the young prince was already &s;ettled<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 46.</NOTE>; for the
catholics held them&s;elves a&s;&s;ured that the child was to be
a male: And Bonner, bi&s;hop of London, made public
prayers be &s;aid, that Heaven would plea&s;e to render him
beautiful, vigorous, and witty. But the nation remained
&s;till &s;omewhat incredulous; and men were per&s;uaded,
that the Queen laboured under infirmities, which render|ed
her incapable of having children. Her infant proved
only the commencement of a drop&s;y, which the di&s;or|dered
&s;tate of her health had brought upon her. The
belief, however, of her pregnancy was &s;till maintained
with all po&s;&s;ible care; and was one artifice, by which
Philip endeavoured to &s;upport his authority in the king|dom.
The Parliament pa&s;&s;ed a law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1555.</NOTE> which, in ca&s;e of
the Queen's death, appointed him protector during the
minority; and the King and Queen, finding they could
obtain no further conce&s;&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16 January.</NOTE> came unexpectedly to
We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, and di&s;&s;olved them.</P>
<P>THERE happened a remarkable affair this &s;e&s;&s;ion,

of the lower hou&s;e, di&s;&s;atisfied with the mea&s;ures of
the Parliament, but finding them&s;elves unable to prevent
them, made a &s;ece&s;&s;ion, in order to &s;how their di&s;appro|bation,

<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s which Gardiner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXXVII.</NOTE> from his cautious and
prudent conduct, had met with in governing the
Parliament, and engaging them both to approve of the
Spani&s;h alliance, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ancient
religion, two points, to which, it was believed, they
bore an extreme aver&s;ion, had &s;o rai&s;ed his character for
wi&s;dom and policy, that his opinion was received as an
oracle in the Queen's councils; and his authority, as it
was always great in his own party, no longer &s;uffered
any oppo&s;ition or controul. Cardinal Pole him&s;elf, tho'
more beloved on account of his virtue and candour, and
tho' &s;uperior in birth and &s;tation, had not equal weight
in public deliberations; and while his learning, piety,
and humanity were extremely re&s;pected, he was repre|&s;ented
more as a good man than a great mini&s;ter. A very
important que&s;tion was frequently debated, before the
Queen and council, by the&s;e two eccle&s;ia&s;tics; whether
the laws lately revived again&s;t heretics &s;hould be put in
execution, or &s;hould only be employed to re&s;train, by
$$rror, the bold attempts of the&s;e zealots. Pole was very
<PB N="435" REF="467">
&s;incere in his religious principles; and tho' his modera|tion
had made him be &s;u&s;pected at Rome of a tendency
towards Lutherani&s;m; he was &s;eriou&s;ly per&s;uaded of the
catholic doctrines, and thought that no con&s;ideration of
human policy ought ever to come in competition with
&s;uch important intere&s;ts. Gardiner, on the contrary,
had always made his religion &s;ub&s;ervient to his &s;chemes
of &s;afety or advancement; and by his unlimited com|plai&s;ance
to Henry, he had &s;hown, that, had he not been
pu&s;hed to extremity under the late minority, he was &s;uf|ficiently
di&s;po&s;ed to make a &s;acrifice of his principles to
the e&s;tabli&s;hed theology. This was the well-known
character of the&s;e two great coun&s;ellors; yet &s;uch is the
prevalence of temper above &s;y&s;tem, that the benevolent
di&s;po&s;ition of Pole led him to advi&s;e a toleration of the
heretical tenets which he highly blamed; while the &s;evere
manners of Gardiner inclined him to &s;upport, by per&s;e|cution,
that religion which, at the bottom, he regarded
with great indifference<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 47.</NOTE>. This circum&s;tance of public
conduct was of the highe&s;t importance; and from being
the object of deliberation in the council, it &s;oon became
the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e throughout the nation. We
&s;hall repre&s;ent, in a few words, the topics by which each
&s;ide &s;upported, or might have &s;upported, their &s;cheme of
policy; and &s;hall di&s;play the oppo&s;ite rea&s;ons which have
been employed, with regard to an argument that ever
has been, and ever will be &s;o much canva&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE practice of per&s;ecution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons for and again&s;t toleration.</NOTE>&s;aid the defenders of
Pole's opinion, is the &s;candal of all religion; and the
theological animo&s;ity, &s;o fierce and violent, far from be|ing
an argument of men's conviction in their oppo&s;ite
tenets, is a certain proof, that they have never reached
<PB N="436" REF="468">
any &s;erious per&s;ua&s;ion with regard to the&s;e remote and
&s;ublime &s;ubjects. Even tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t impatient
of contradiction in other controver&s;ies, are mild and
moderate in compari&s;on of polemical divines; and where|ever
a man's knowlege and experience give him a perfect
a&s;&s;urance of his own opinion, he regards with contempt,
rather than anger, the oppo&s;ition and mi&s;takes of others.
But while men zealou&s;ly maintain what they neither
clearly comprehend, nor entirely believe, they are &s;ha|ken
in their imagined faith, by the oppo&s;ite per&s;ua&s;ion,
or even doubts of other men; and vent on their antago|ni&s;ts
that impatience which is the natural re&s;ult of &s;o dif|agreeable
a &s;tate of the under&s;tanding. They then em|brace
ea&s;ily any pretence for repre&s;enting opponents as
impious and prophane; and if they can al&s;o find a co|lour
for connecting this violence with the intere&s;ts of civil
government, they can no longer be re&s;trained from giv|ing
uncontrouled &s;cope to vengeance and re&s;entment.
But &s;urely never enterprize was more unfortunate than
that of founding per&s;ecution upon policy, or endeavour|ing,
for the &s;ake of peace, to &s;ettle an entire uniformity
of opinion, in que&s;tions which, of all others, are lea&s;t
&s;ubjected to the criterion of human rea&s;on. The univer|&s;al
and uncontradicted prevalence of one opinion in reli|gious
&s;ubjects, can only be owing at fir&s;t to the &s;tupid
ignorance and barbari&s;m of the people, who never in|dulge
them&s;elves in any &s;peculation or enquiry; and there
is no other expedient for maintaining that uniformity, &s;o
fondly fought after, but by bani&s;hing for ever all curio|&s;ity
and all improvement in &s;cience and cultivation. It
may not, indeed, appear difficult to check, by a &s;teady
&s;everity, the fir&s;t beginnings of controver&s;y; but be&s;ides
that this policy expo&s;es for ever the people to all the ab|ject
terrors of &s;uper&s;tition, and the magi&s;trate to the end|le&s;s
encroachments of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, it al&s;o renders men &s;o
<PB N="437" REF="469">
delicate, that they can never endure to hear of oppo&s;ition;
and they will &s;ome time pay dearly for that fal&s;e tranquil|lity
in which they have been &s;o long indulged. As
healthful bodies are ruined by too nice a regimen, and are
thereby rendered incapable of bearing the unavoidable
incidents of human life; a people who never were allowed
to imagine, that their principles could be conte&s;ted, fly
out into the mo&s;t outrageous violence when any event
(and &s;uch events are common) produces a faction among
their clergy, and gives ri&s;e to any difference in tenet or
opinion. But whatever may be &s;aid in favour of &s;uppre&s;|&s;ing,
by per&s;ecution, the fir&s;t beginnings of here&s;y, no
&s;olid argument can be alledged for extending &s;everity to|wards
multitudes, or endeavouring, by capital puni&s;h|ments,
to extirpate an opinion, which has diffu&s;ed it&s;elf
through men of every rank and &s;tation. Be&s;ides the ex|treme
barbarity of &s;uch an attempt, it proves commonly
ineffectual to the purpo&s;e intended; and &s;erves only to
make men more ob&s;tinate in their per&s;ua&s;ion, and to en|crea&s;e
the number of their pro&s;elytes. The melancholy
with which the fear of death, torture, and per&s;ecution
in&s;pires the &s;ectaries, is the proper di&s;po&s;ition for fo&s;tering
religious zeal: The pro&s;pect of eternal rewards, when
brought near, overpowers the dread of temporal puni&s;h|ment:
The glory of martyrdom &s;timulates all the more
furious zealots, e&s;pecially the leaders and preachers:
Where a violent animo&s;ity is excited by oppre&s;&s;ion, men
pa&s;s naturally from hating the per&s;ons of their tyrants, to
a more violent abhorrence of their doctrines: And the
&s;pectators, moved with pity towards the &s;uppo&s;ed martyrs,
are naturally &s;educed to embrace tho&s;e principles which
can in&s;pire men with a con&s;tancy that appears almo&s;t
&s;upernatural. Open the door to toleration, the mutual
hatred relaxes among the &s;ectaries; their attachment to
<PB N="438" REF="470">
their particular religion decays; the common occupations
and plea&s;ures of life &s;ucceed to the acrimony of di&s;puta|tion;
and the &s;ame man, who, in other circum&s;tances,
would have braved flames and tortures, is engaged to
change his religion from the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect of favour
and advancement, or even from the frivolous hopes of
becoming more fa&s;hionable in his principles. If any ex|ception
can be admitted to this maxim of toleration, it
will only be where a theology altogether new, nowi&s;e
connected with the ancient religion of the &s;tate, is im|ported
from foreign countries, and may ea&s;ily, at one
blow, be eradicated, without leaving the &s;eeds of future
innovations. But as this in&s;tance would involve &s;ome
apology for the ancient pagan per&s;ecutions, or for the
extirpation of Chri&s;tianity in China and japan; it ought
&s;urely, on account of this dete&s;ted con&s;equence, to be
rather buried in eternal &s;ilence and oblivion.</P>
<P>THOUGH the&s;e arguments appear entirely &s;atisfac|tory,
yet &s;uch is the &s;ubtilty of human wit, that Gardiner,
and the other enemies to toleration, were not reduced to
&s;ilence, and they &s;till found topics on which to &s;upport
the controver&s;y. The doctrine, &s;aid they, of liberty of
con&s;cience is founded on the mo&s;t flagrant impiety, and
&s;uppo&s;es &s;uch an indifference among all religions, &s;uch an
ob&s;curity in theological doctrines, as to render the church
and magi&s;trate incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing, with certainty,
the dictates of Heaven from the mere fictions of human
imagination. If the Divinity reveals principles to man|kind,
he will &s;urely give a criterion by which they may
be a&s;certained; and a prince, who knowingly allows the&s;e
principles to be perverted, or adulterated, is infinitely
more criminal than if he gave permi&s;&s;ion for the vending
of poi&s;on, under the &s;hape of bread, to all his &s;ubjects,
Per&s;ecution may, indeed, &s;eem better calculated to make

the habits of hypocri&s;y often turn into reality; and the

may happily be educated in more orthodox tenets. It is
ab&s;urd, in oppo&s;ition to con&s;iderations of &s;uch un&s;peak|able
importance, to plead the temporal and frivolous in|tere&s;ts
of civil &s;ociety; and if matters be thoroughly ex|amined,
even that topic will not appear &s;o certain and
univer&s;al in favour of toleration as by &s;ome it is repre|&s;ented.
Where &s;ects ari&s;e, who&s;e fundamental principle
on all &s;ides, is to execrate, and abhor, and damn, and
extirpate each other; what choice has the magi&s;trate left
but to take party, and by rendering one &s;ect entirely
prevalent, re&s;tore, at lea&s;t for a time, the public tran|quillity?
The political body, being here &s;ickly, mu&s;t
not be treated as if it were in a &s;tate of &s;ound health;
and an affected neutrality in the prince, or even a cool
preference, may &s;erve only to encourage the hopes of all
the &s;ects, and keep alive their animo&s;ity. The prote&s;|tants,
far from tolerating the religion of their ance&s;tors,
regard it as an impious and dete&s;table idolatry; and
during the late minority, when they were entirely ma&s;ters,
enacted very &s;evere, tho' not capital, puni&s;hments again&s;t
all exerci&s;e of the catholic wor&s;hip, and even again&s;t
&s;uch as barely ab&s;tained from their profane rites and &s;a|craments.
Nor are in&s;tances wanting of their endea|vours
to &s;ecure an imagined orthodoxy by the mo&s;t rigor|ous
executions: Calvin has burned Servetus at Geneva:
Cranmer brought Arians and Anabapti&s;ts to the &s;take:

the cruel bigotry of Mary and Philip, were better re|ceived;
and though Pole pleaded, as is affirmed<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Burn$t, vol. ii. Heylin, p. 47.

who, after endeavouring through his whole life to extir|pate
here&s;y, had, in the end, reaped nothing but con|fu&s;ion
and di&s;appointment, the &s;cheme of toleration was
entirely rejected. It was determined to let loo&s;e the
laws in their full rigour again&s;t the reformed religion;
and England was &s;oon filled with &s;cenes of horror, which
have ever &s;ince rendered the catholic religion the object
of general dete&s;tation, and which prove, that no human
depravity can equal revenge and cruelty, covered with
the mantle of religion.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ecutors began with Rogers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violent per&s;ecu|tions in England.</NOTE> who was pre|bendary
of St. Paul's, and a man eminent in his party for
virtue as well as for learning. Gardiner's plan was fir&s;t
to attack men of that character, whom, he hoped, ter|ror
would bend to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and who&s;e example, either
of puni&s;hment or recantation, would naturally have in|fluence
on the multitude: But he found a per&s;everance
and courage in Rogers, which it may &s;eem &s;trange to
find in human nature, and of which all ages, and
all &s;ects, do notwith&s;tanding furni&s;h many examples.
<PB N="441" REF="473">
Rogers, be&s;ide the care of his own pre&s;ervation, lay
under other very powerful temptations to compli|ance:
He had a wife, whom he tenderly loved, and
ten children; yet &s;uch was his &s;erenity after his condem|nation,
that the jailors, it is &s;aid, waked him from a
&s;ound &s;leep, when the hour of his execution approached.
He had de&s;ired to &s;ee his wife before he died; but Gar|diner
told him, that he was a prie&s;t; he could not po&s;|&s;ibly
have a wife: Thus joining in&s;ult to cruelty, Ro|gers

<P>HOOPER, bi&s;hop of Gloce&s;ter, had been tried at the
&s;ame time with Rogers; but was &s;ent to his own dioce&s;e
to be executed. This circum&s;tance was contrived to
&s;trike the greater terror into his flock; but it was a
&s;ource of &s;atisfaction to Hooper, who rejoiced in giving
te&s;timony by his death, to that doctrine which he had
formerly taught them. When he was tied to the &s;take,
a &s;tool was &s;et before him, and the Queen's pardon laid
upon it, which it was &s;till in his power to merit by his
recantation: But he ordered it to be removed; and
chearfully prepared him&s;elf for that dreadful puni&s;hment
to which he was &s;entenced. He &s;uffered it in its full &s;e|verity:
The wind, which was vehement, blew the flame
of the reeds from his body: The $aggots were green, and
did not kindle ea&s;ily: All his lower parts were con&s;umed,
before his vitals were attacked: One of his hands dropt
off: With the other he continued to beat his brea&s;t: He
was heard to pray and exhort the people, till his tongue,
&s;woln with the violence of his agony, could no longer
permit him utterance. He was three quarters of an
hour in torture, which he bore with inflexible con|&s;tancy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fox, vol. iii. p. 145. &amp;c. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 302. Heylin, p. 48, 49. Godwin, p. 349.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>ONE Hunter, a young man of nineteen, an appren|tice,
having been &s;educed by a prie&s;t into a di&s;pute, had
unwarily denied the real pre&s;ence. Sen&s;ible of his dan|ger,
he immediately concealed him&s;elf; and Bonner lay|ing
hold of his father, threatened him with the greate&s;t
&s;everities, if he did not produce the young man to &s;tand
his trial. Hunter, hearing the vexations to which his
father was expo&s;ed, voluntarily delivered him&s;elf up to
Bonner, and was condemned to the flames by that bar|barous
prelate.</P>
<P>THOMAS Haukes, when conducted to the &s;take,
agreed with his friends, that if he found the torture to|lerable,
he would make them a &s;ignal to that purpo&s;e in
the mid&s;t of the flames. His zeal for the cau&s;e in which
he &s;uffered, &s;o &s;upported him, that he &s;tretched out his

encouraged multitudes, not only to &s;uffer, but
even to a&s;pire to martyrdom.</P>
<P>THE tender &s;ex it&s;elf, as they have commonly a greater
propen&s;ity to religion, produced many in&s;tances of the
mo&s;t inflexible courage in &s;upporting the profe&s;&s;ion of
it, again&s;t all the fury of the per&s;ecutors. One execu|tion
in particular was attended with circum&s;tances which,
even at that time, excited a&s;toni&s;hment, by rea&s;on of their
<PB N="445" REF="475">
unu&s;ual barbarity. A woman in Guern&s;ey, being near
the time of her labour when brought to the &s;take, was
thrown into &s;uch agitation by the torture, that her belly
bur&s;t, and &s;he was delivered in the mid&s;t of the flames.
One of the guards immediately &s;natched the infant from
the fire, and attempted to &s;ave it: But a magi&s;trate who
&s;tood by, ordered it to be thrown back; being deter|mined,
he &s;aid, that nothing &s;hould &s;urvive which &s;prung

<P>THE per&s;ons condemned to the&s;e puni&s;hments were
not convicted for teaching, or dogmatizing, contrary to
the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: They were &s;eized merely on
&s;u&s;picion; and articles being offered them to &s;ub&s;cribe,
they were immediately, upon their refu&s;al, condemned to
the flames<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 306.</NOTE>. The&s;e in&s;tances of barbarity, &s;o unu&s;ual in
the nation, excited horror; the con&s;tancy of the martyrs
was the object of admiration; and as men have a prin|ciple
of equity engraven in their minds, which even fal&s;e
religion is not able totally to obliterate, they were &s;hocked
to &s;ee per&s;ons of probity, of honour, of pious di&s;po|&s;itions,
expo&s;ed to puni&s;hments more &s;evere than were
inflicted on the greate&s;t ruffians, for crimes &s;ubver&s;ive of
civil &s;ociety. To exterminate the whole prote&s;tant party,
was known to be impo&s;&s;ible; and nothing could appear
more iniquitous, than to &s;ubject to torture, the mo&s;t
con&s;cientious and courageous among them; and allow
the cowards and hypocrites to e&s;cape. Each martyrdom,
therefore, was equivalent to a hundred &s;ermons again&s;t
popery; and men either avoided &s;uch horrid &s;pectacles, or
returned from them full of a violent, though &s;ecret, in|dignation
again&s;t the per&s;ecutors. Repeated orders were
&s;ent from the council, to quicken the diligence of the

magi&s;trates in &s;earching after heretics; and, in &s;ome
places, the gentry were obliged to countenance, by their
pre&s;ence, the&s;e barbarous executions. The&s;e violences
tended only to render the Spani&s;h government daily more
odious; and Philip, &s;en&s;ible of the hatred which he in|curred,
endeavoured to remove the reproach from him&s;elf
by a very gro&s;s artifice: He ordered his confe&s;&s;or to deli|ver
in his pre&s;ence a &s;ermon in favour of toleration; a
doctrine &s;omewhat extraordinary in the mouth of a Spa|ni&s;h friar<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 56.</NOTE>. But the court, finding that Bonner, how|ever
&s;hamele&s;s and &s;avage, would not bear alone the
whole infamy, &s;oon threw off the ma&s;k; and the unre|lenting
temper of the Queen, as well as of the King,
appeared without controul. A bold &s;tep was even taken
towards the introduction of the inqui&s;ition into England. As the bi&s;hops' courts, though extremely arbitrary, and
$word$ confined by any ordinary forms of law, appeared not
to be inve&s;ted with &s;ufficient power, a commi&s;&s;ion was
appointed by authority of the Queen's prerogative, more
effectually to extirpate here&s;y. Twenty-one per&s;ons were named; but any three were armed with the powers
of the whole. The commi&s;&s;ion runs in the&s;e terms;
&startq;That &s;ince many fal&s;e rumours were publi&s;hed among
the &s;ubjects, and many heretical opinions were al&s;o
&s;pread among them, therefore they were to enquire
into tho&s;e, either by pre&s;entments by witne&s;&s;es, or
any other political way they could devi&s;e, and to &s;earch
after all here&s;ies; the bringers in, the &s;ellers, the
readers of all heretical books: They were to examine
and puni&s;h all mi&s;behaviours or negligences, in any
church or chappel; and to try all prie&s;ts that did not
preach the &s;acrament of the altar; all per&s;ons that did
not hear ma&s;s, or come to their pari&s;h church to &s;er|vice,
that would not go in proce&s;&s;ions, or did not take
<PB N="447" REF="477">
holy bread or holy water: And if they found any that
did ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch here&s;ies, they were to
put them into the hands of their ordinaries, to be pu|ni&s;hed
according to the &s;piritual laws: Giving the
commi&s;&s;ioners full power to proceed, as their di&s;cre|tions
and con&s;ciences &s;hould direct them, and to u&s;e
all &s;uch means as they would invent for the &s;earching
of the premi&s;es; empowering them al&s;o to call before
them &s;uch witne&s;&s;es as they plea&s;ed, and to force them

they &s;ought after<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Coll. 32.</NOTE>.&endq; Some civil powers were al&s;o

<P>TO bring the methods of proceeding in England &s;till
nearer the practice of the inqui&s;ition, letters were written
to the lord North, and others, enjoining them, &startq;To

tyrannical edict even exceeded the oppre&s;&s;ion of the in|qui&s;ition;
by introducing into every part of government,
the &s;ame iniquities which that tribunal practi&s;es only for
the extirpation of here&s;y, and which are, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
nece&s;&s;ary, wherever that end is earne&s;tly pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>BUT the court had devi&s;ed a more expeditious and
&s;ummary method of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing here&s;y than even the in|qui&s;ition
it&s;elf. They i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t books
of here&s;y, trea&s;on, and &s;edition; and declared, &startq;That
who&s;oever had any of the&s;e books, and did not pre|&s;ently
burn them, without reading them, or &s;hewing
them to any other per&s;on, &s;hould be e&s;teemed rebels;
and without any farther delay, be executed by martial
law<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 363. Heylin, p. 79.</NOTE>.&endq; From the &s;tate of the Engli&s;h government,
during that period, it is not &s;o much the illegality of
the&s;e proceedings, as their violence and their pernicious
tendency, which ought to be the object of our cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>WE have thrown together almo&s;t all the tran&s;actions
again&s;t heretics, though carried on during a cour&s;e of
three years; that we may be obliged, as little as po&s;&s;ible,
to return to &s;uch &s;hocking violences and barbarities. It
is computed, that in that time two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even
per&s;ons &s;uffered by fire; be&s;ides tho&s;e puni&s;hed by
<PB N="449" REF="479">
impri&s;onment, fines, and confi&s;cations. Among tho&s;e
who &s;uffered by fire, were five bi&s;hops, twenty-one cler|gymen,
eight lay gentlemen, eighty-four trade&s;men, one
hundred hu&s;bandmen, &s;ervants, and labourers, fifty-five
women, and four children. This per&s;evering cruelty ap|pears
a&s;toni&s;hing; yet is it much inferior to what has
been practi&s;ed in other countries. A great author<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE> com|putes,
that in the Low Countries alone, from the time
that the edict of Charles the fifth was promulgated again&s;t
the reformers, there had been fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons
hanged, beheaded, buried alive, or burnt, on account of
religion; and that in France the number had al&s;o been
con&s;iderable. Yet in both countries, as the &s;ame author
&s;ubjoins, the progre&s;s of the new opinions, in&s;tead of
being $$$cked, was rather forwarded by the&s;e per&s;e|cutio$.</P>
<P>TH$ $$$ing of heretics was a very natural method
of recon$$$$ng the kingdom to the church of Rome, and
little &s;olicitation was requi&s;ite to engage the pope to re|ceive
the &s;trayed flock, from which he reaped &s;uch
profit: Yet was there a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y &s;ent to Rome,
con&s;i&s;ting of Sir Anthony Brown, created vi&s;count Mon|tacute,
the bi&s;hop of Ely, and Sir Edward Carne; in
order to carry the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of England, and beg to be
re-admitted into the bo&s;om of the catholic church<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 45.</NOTE>. Paul
the fourth, after a &s;hort interval, now filled the papal
chair; the mo&s;t haughty pontiff, that during &s;everal ages
had been elevated to that dignity. He was offended, that
Mary &s;till retained among her titles, that of Queen of
Ireland; and he affirmed, that it belonged to him alone,
as he &s;aw proper, either to erect new kingdoms or abo|li&s;h
the old: But to avoid all di&s;pute with the new con|verts,
he thought proper to erect Ireland into a kingdom,
<PB N="450" REF="480">
and then admitted the title, as if it had been a&s;&s;umed
from his own conce&s;&s;ion. This was an u&s;ual artifice of
the popes to give allowance to what they could not
prevent<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 45. Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>,
and afterwards pretend, that per&s;ons, while
they exerci&s;ed their own power, were only acting by
authority from the papacy. And though Paul had at fir&s;t
intended to oblige Mary formally to recede from this
title, before he would be&s;tow it upon her; he found
it wi&s;er to proceed in a more political, and le&s;s haughty
manner<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other point of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion between the pope and
the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors was not &s;o ea&s;ily terminated.
Paul in&s;i&s;ted, that the property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the
church &s;hould be re&s;tored even to the uttermo&s;t farthing:
That whatever belonged to God, could never by any
law be converted to profane u&s;es, and every per&s;on who
detained &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions was in a &s;tate of eternal dam|nation:
That he would willingly, in con&s;ideration of
the humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of England, make them a pre&s;ent
of the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues; but &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion
exceeded his power, and the people might be certain
that &s;o great a profanation of holy things would be a
perpetual anathema upon them, and would bla&s;t all their
future felicity: That if they would truly &s;hew their filial
piety, they mu&s;t re&s;tore all the privileges and emoluments
of the Roman church, and Peter's pence among the
re&s;t; nor could they expect, that that apo&s;tle would open
to them the gates of paradi&s;e, while they detained from
him his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on earth<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5. Heylin, p. 45.</NOTE>. The&s;e earne&s;t remon|&s;trances,
being tran&s;mitted to England, though they had
little influence on the nation, operated powerfully on
the Queen; and &s;he was determined, in order to ea&s;e
<PB N="451" REF="481">
her con&s;cience, to re&s;tore all the church lands which
were &s;till in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown; and the more
to expre&s;s her zeal, &s;he erected anew &s;ome convents and
mona&s;teries, notwith&s;tanding the low condition of the
public revenues. When this mea&s;ure was debated in
council, &s;ome members objected, that if &s;uch a con|&s;iderable
part of the revenue was di&s;membered, the dig|nity
of the crown would fall to decay: But the Queen
replied, that &s;he preferred the &s;alvation of her &s;oul to
ten &s;uch kingdoms as England<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 53, 65. Holling&s;hed, p. 1127. Speed, p. 826.</NOTE>. The&s;e imprudent
mea&s;ures would not probably have taken place &s;o ea&s;ily,
had it not been for the death of Gardiner, which hap|pened
about this time: The &s;eals were given to Heathe,
archbi&s;hop of York; that an eccle&s;ia&s;tic might &s;till be
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that high office, and be better enabled by
his authority to forward the per&s;ecutions again&s;t the
reformed.</P>
<P>THESE per&s;ecutions were now become extremely
odious to the nation; and the effects of the public di&s;|contents
appeared in the new Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t Oc|tober.</NOTE> which was

the impropriations which remained in the hands of the
crown; but though this matter directly concerned none
but the Queen her&s;elf, great oppo&s;ition was made to the
bill in the hou&s;e of commons. An application being
made for a &s;ub&s;idy during two years, and for two fif|teenths,
the latter was refu&s;ed by the commons; and
many members &s;aid, that while the crown was thus de|$$oiling
it&s;elf of its revenues, it was in vain to be&s;tow
riches upon it. The Parliament rejected a bill for obliging
the exiles to return under certain penalties, and another
<PB N="452" REF="482">
for incapacitating &s;uch as were remi&s;s in the pro&s;ecution
of here&s;y from being ju&s;tices of peace. The Queen
finding the intractable humour of the commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th De|cember.</NOTE> thought
proper to di&s;&s;olve the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, which began to prevail in
Parliament, was likely to be the more vexatious to
Mary, as &s;he was otherwi&s;e in very bad humour on ac|count
of her hu&s;band's ab&s;ence, who, tired of her im|portunate
love and jealou&s;y, and finding his authority ex|tremely
limited in England, had laid hold of the fir&s;t op|portunity
to leave her, and had gone over la&s;t &s;ummer
to the emperor in Flanders. The indifference and ne|glect
of her hu&s;band, added to the di&s;appointment in her
imagined pregnancy, threw her into a deep melancholy;
and &s;he gave vent to her &s;pleen by enforcing daily the
per&s;ecutions again&s;t the prote&s;tants, and even by expre&s;|&s;ions
of rage again&s;t all her &s;ubjects, by whom &s;he knew
her&s;elf to be hated, and who&s;e oppo&s;ition, in refu&s;ing an
entire compliance with Philip, was the cau&s;e, &s;he be|lieved,
why he had alienated his affections from her, and
afforded her &s;o little of his company. The le&s;s return
her love met with, the more it increa&s;ed; and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
mo&s;t of her time in &s;olitude, where &s;he gave vent to her
pa&s;&s;ion, either in tears, or in writing fond epi&s;tles to
Philip, who &s;eldom returned her any an&s;wer, and &s;carce
deigned to counterfeit any &s;entiment of love or even of
gratitude towards her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's ex|tortions.</NOTE> The chief part of government,
to which &s;he attended, was the extorting money from
her people, in order to &s;atisfy his demands; and as the
Parliament had granted her but a &s;mall &s;upply, &s;he had
recour&s;e to expedients the mo&s;t violent and mo&s;t irregu|lar.
She levied a loan of 60,000 pounds upon a thou|&s;and
per&s;ons, of who&s;e compliance, either on account
of their riches or their affections to her, &s;he held her&s;elf
be&s;t a&s;&s;ured: But that &s;um not &s;ufficing, &s;he exacted a
<PB N="453" REF="483">
general loan of an hundred pounds a-piece on every one
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed twenty pounds a year. This grievous im|po&s;ition
lay very heavy on the gentry, who were obliged,
many of them, to retrench their expences, and di&s;mi&s;s
their &s;ervants, in order to enable them to comply with
her commands: And as the&s;e &s;ervants, accu&s;tomed to
idlene&s;s, and having no means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, betook
them&s;elves very commonly to theft and robbery, the
Queen publi&s;hed a proclamation, by which &s;he obliged
their former ma&s;ters to take them back to their &s;ervice.
She levied 60,000 marks from 7000 yeomen, who had
not contributed to the former loan; and &s;he exacted
36,000 pounds more from the merchants. In order to
engage &s;ome Londoners to comply the more willingly
with her multiplied extortions, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed an edict, pro|hibiting,
for four months, the exporting any Engli&s;h
cloths or ker&s;eys for Flanders; an expedient which pro|cured
a good market for &s;uch as had already &s;ent any
quantity of cloth thither. Her rapaciou&s;ne&s;s engaged
her to give endle&s;s di&s;turbance and interruption to com|merce.
The Engli&s;h company &s;ettled in Antwerp hav|ing
refu&s;ed her a loan of 40,000 pounds, &s;he di&s;&s;embled
her re&s;entment, till &s;he found, that they had bought
and &s;hipped great quantities of cloth for Antwerp fair,
which was approaching: She then laid an embargo on
the &s;hips, and obliged the merchants to grant her a loan
of the 40,000 pounds at fir&s;t demanded, to engage for
the payment of 20,000 pounds more at a limited time,
and to &s;ubmit to an arbitrary impo&s;ition of twenty &s;hil|lings
on each piece. Some time after, &s;he was informed,
that the Italian merchants had &s;hipped above 40,000
pieces of cloth for the Levant, for which they were to
pay a crown a piece, the u&s;ual impo&s;ition: She &s;truck
a bargain with the merchant adventurers in London;
prohibited entirely the foreigners to make any exporta|tion;
<PB N="454" REF="484">
and received, from the Engli&s;h merchants, in
con&s;ideration of this iniquity, the &s;um of 50,000 pounds,
and an impo&s;ition of four crowns on each piece of cloth
which they &s;houid export. She attempted to borrow
great &s;ums abroad; but her credit ran &s;o low, that, tho'
&s;he offered 14 per cent, to the city of Antwerp for a loan
of 30,000 pounds, &s;he could not obtain it, till &s;he con|&s;trained
the city of London to be &s;urety for her<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Godwin, p. 359. Cowper's Chronicle. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 359. Carte, p. 330, 333, 337, 341. Strype's Memor. vol. iii. p. 428, 558. Annals, vol. i. p. 15.</NOTE>. All the&s;e violent expedients were employed while &s;he her&s;elf

&s;ummoned the &s;tates of the Low Countries;<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Octo|ber.</NOTE> and &s;eating

&s;ubjects the rea&s;ons of his re&s;ignation, ab&s;olved them
from all oaths of allegiance, and devolving his authority
on Philip, told him, that his paternal tenderne&s;s made
him weep, when he reflected on the burthen which he
impo&s;ed upon him<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Thuan, lib. xvi. c. 20.</NOTE>. He inculcated on him the great
and only duty of a prince, the &s;tudy of his people's hap|pine&s;s; and repre&s;ented how much preferable it was to
<PB N="455" REF="485">
govern, by affection rather than fear, the nations &s;ub|jected
to his dominion. The cool reflections of age now
di&s;covered to him the emptine&s;s of his former pur&s;uits;
and he found, that the vain &s;chemes of extending his
empire had been the &s;ource of endle&s;s oppo&s;ition and di&s;|appointment,
had kept him&s;elf, his neighbours, and his
&s;ubjects in perpetual inquietude, and had fru&s;trated the
&s;ole end of government, the felicity of the nations com|mitted
to his care; an object which meets with no op|po&s;ition,
and which, if &s;teadily pur&s;ued, can alone con|vey
a la&s;ting and &s;olid &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A FEW months after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1556.</NOTE> he re&s;igned to Philip his other
dominions; and embarking on board a fleet, &s;ailed to
Spain, and took his journey to St. Ju&s;t, a mona&s;tery in
E&s;tramedura, which, being &s;ituated in a happy climate,
and amid&s;t the greate&s;t beauties of nature, he had cho&s;en
for the place of his retreat. When he arrived at Burgos,
he found, by the thinne&s;s of his court, and the negligent
attendance of the Spani&s;h grandees, that he was no
longer emperor; and though this ob&s;ervation might con|vince
him &s;till more of the vanity of the world, and
make him more heartily de&s;pi&s;e what he had renounced,
he &s;ighed to find that all the former adulation and obei|&s;ance
had been paid to his fortune, not to his per&s;on.
With better rea&s;on, was he &s;truck with the ingratitude of
his &s;on Philip, who allowed him to wait a long time for
the payment of the &s;mall pen&s;ion which he had re&s;erved;
and this di&s;appointment in his dome&s;tic enjoyments gave
him a very &s;en&s;ible concern. He pur&s;ued however his
re&s;olution with inflexible con&s;tancy; and &s;hutting him&s;elf
up in his retreat, he exerted &s;uch &s;elf-command, that he
re&s;trained even his curio&s;ity from any enquiry concerning
the tran&s;actions of the world, which he had entirely
abandoned. The fencing again&s;t the pains and infirmi|ties
<PB N="456" REF="486">
under which he laboured, occupied a great part of
his time; and during the intervals, he employed his lei|&s;ure
hours either in examining the controver&s;ies of the|ology,
with which his age had been &s;o much agitated,
and which he had hitherto con&s;idered only in a political
light, or in imitating the works of renowned arti&s;ts,
particularly in mechanics, of which he had always been
a great admirer and encourager. He is &s;aid to have here
discovered a propen&s;ity to the new doctrines; and to have
frequently dropped hints of this unexpected alteration in
his &s;entiments. Having amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the con|&s;truction
of clocks and watches, he thence remarked
how impracticable the object was, in which he had &s;o
much employed him&s;elf during his grandeur; and how
impo&s;&s;ible that he, who never could frame two machines
that would go exactly alike, could ever be able to make
all mankind concur in the &s;ame belief and opinion. He
&s;urvived his retreat two years.</P>
<P>THE emperor Charles had very early, in the beginning
of his reign, found the difficulty of governing &s;uch
di&s;tant dominions; and he had made his brother Ferdi|nand
be elected King of the Romans; with a view of
his &s;ucceeding to the imperial dignity, as well as to his
German dominions. But having afterwards enlarged his
views, and formed plans of aggrandizing his family, he
regretted, that he mu&s;t di&s;member &s;uch con&s;iderable
&s;tates; and he endeavoured to engage Ferdinand, by the
mo&s;t tempting offers, and mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;olicitations,
to yield up his preten&s;ions in favour of Philip. Finding his
attempts fruitle&s;s, he had re&s;igned the imperial crown
with his other dignities; and Ferdinand, according to
common form, applied to the pope for his coronation.
The arrogant pontiff refu&s;ed the demand; and pretended,
that, though, on the death of an emperor, he was obli|ged
to crown the prince elected, yet in the ca&s;e of a re|&s;ignation,
<PB N="457" REF="487">
the right devolved to the holy &s;ee, and it be|longed
to the pope alone to appoint an emperor. The
conduct of Paul was in every thing conformable to the&s;e
lofty preten&s;ions. He thundered always in the ears of
all amba&s;&s;adors, that he &s;tood in no need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of any prince, that he was above all potentates of the
earth, that he would not accu&s;tom monarchs to pretend
to a familiarity or equality with him, that it belonged to
him to alter and regulate kingdoms, that he was &s;ucce&s;|&s;or
of tho&s;e who had depo&s;ed kings and emperors, and
that, rather than &s;ubmit to any thing below his dignity,
he would &s;et fire to the four corners of the world. He
went &s;o far, as at table, in the pre&s;ence of many per|&s;ons,
and even openly, in a public con&s;i&s;tory, to &s;ay,
that he would not admit any Kings for his companions;
they were all his &s;ubjects, and he would hold them under
the&s;e feet: So &s;aying, he &s;tamped the ground with his
old and infirm limbs: For he was now pa&s;t four&s;core
years of age<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE world could not forbear making a compari&s;on
between Charles the fifth, a prince, who, though edu|cated
amid&s;t wars and intrigues of &s;tate, had prevented
the decline of age, and had de&s;cended from the throne,
in order to &s;et apart an interval for thought and re|flection,
and a prie&s;t, who in the extremity of old age
exulted in his dominion, and from re&s;tle&s;s ambition and
revenge was throwing all nations into combu&s;tion. Paul
had entertained the mo&s;t inveterate animo&s;ity again&s;t the
hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and though a truce of five years had
been concluded between France and Spain, he excited
Henry by his &s;olicitations to break it, and promi&s;ed to
a&s;&s;i&s;t him in recovering Naples and the dominions to
which he laid claim in Italy; a project which had ever
<PB N="458" REF="488">
proved fatal to his predece&s;&s;ors. He him&s;elf engaged in
ho&s;tilities with the duke of Alva, viceroy of Naples;
and the duke of Gui&s;e being &s;ent with forces to &s;upport
him, the renewal of war between the two crowns &s;eemed
almo&s;t inevitable. Philip, though le&s;s warlike than his
father, was no le&s;s ambitious; and he tru&s;ted, that by
the intrigues of the cabinet, where, he believed, his
caution and &s;ecrecy and prudence gave him the &s;uperi|ority,
he &s;hould be able to &s;ubdue all his enemies, and
extend his authority and dominion. For this rea&s;on, as
well as from the de&s;ire of &s;ettling his new empire, he
was de&s;irous to maintain peace with France; but when
he found, that, without &s;acrificing his honour, it was
impo&s;&s;ible for him to overlook the ho&s;tile attempts of
Henry, he prepared for war with great indu&s;try. In
order to give him&s;elf the more advantage, he was de&s;irous
to embark England in the quarrel; and though the
Queen was of her&s;elf extremely aver&s;e to that de&s;ign,
he hoped, that the devoted fondne&s;s, which, notwith|standing
repeated in&s;tances of his indifference, &s;he &s;till
bore him, would effectually &s;econd his applications.
Had the matter indeed depended &s;olely on her, &s;he was
incapable of re&s;i&s;ting her hu&s;band's commands; but
&s;he had little weight with her council, &s;till le&s;s with
her people; and her government, which was every day
becoming more odious, &s;eemed unable to &s;upport it&s;elf
even during the mo&s;t profound tranquillity, much more
if a war was kindled with France, and what &s;eemed an
inevitable con&s;equence, with Scotland, &s;upported by that
powerful kingdom.</P>
<P>AN act of barbarity was this year exerci&s;ed in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Cran|mer.</NOTE>
which, added to many other in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind,
tended to render the government extremely unpopular.
Cranmer had long been detained a pri&s;oner; but the Queen
now determined to bring him to puni&s;hment; and in
<PB N="459" REF="489">
order the more fully to &s;atiate her vengeance, &s;he re&s;ol|ved
to puni&s;h him for here&s;y, rather than for trea&s;on.
He was cited by the pope to &s;tand his trial at Rome; and
though he was known to be kept in clo&s;e cu&s;tody at Ox|ford,
he was, upon his not appearing, condemned as
contumacious. Bonner, bi&s;hop of London, and Thirleby
of Ely, were &s;ent down to Oxford to degrade him; and
the former executed that melancholy ceremony with all
the joy and exultation, which &s;uited his &s;avage nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mem. of Cranm. p. 375.</NOTE>.
The revenge of the Queen, not &s;atisfied with the eter|nal
damnation of Cranmer, which &s;he believed inevitable,
and with the execution of that dreadful &s;entence to which
he was condemned, prompted her al&s;o to &s;eek the ruin of
his honour, and the infamy of his name. Per&s;ons were
employed to attack him, not in the way of di&s;putation,
again&s;t which he was &s;ufficiently armed; but by flattery,
in&s;inuation and addre&s;s; by repre&s;enting the dignities to
which his character &s;till entitled him, if he would merit
them by a recantation; by giving hopes of long enjoying
tho&s;e powerful friends, whom his beneficent di&s;po&s;ition
had attached to him during the cour&s;e of his pro&s;perity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 55. Mem. p. 383.</NOTE>.
Overcome by the fond love of life, terrified by the pro&s;|pect
of tho&s;e tortures which awaited him; he allowed,
in an unguarded hour, the &s;entiments of nature to pre|vail
over his re&s;olution, and he agreed to &s;ign a paper, in
which he acknowledged the doctrines of the papal &s;u|premacy
and of the real pre&s;ence. The court, equally
perfidious and cruel, were determined, that this recant|ation
&s;hould avail him nothing; and they &s;ent orders,
that he &s;hould be required to acknowledge his errors in
church before the whole people, and that he &s;hould
thence be immediately led to execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t March.</NOTE>. Cranmer, whe|ther,
that he had received a &s;ecret intimation of their
<PB N="460" REF="490">
de&s;ign, or had repented of his weakne&s;s, &s;urprized the
audience by a contrary declaration. He &s;aid, that he was
well apprized of the obedience which he owed to his
Sovereign and the laws, but this duty extended no farther
than to &s;ubmit patiently to their commands, and to bear
without re&s;i&s;tance whatever hard&s;hips they &s;hould impo&s;e
upon him: That a &s;uperior duty, the duty which he
owed his Maker, obliged him to &s;peak truth on all occa|&s;ions,
and not to relinqui&s;h, by a ba&s;e denial, the holy
doctrine which the &s;upreme Being had revealed to man|kind:
That there was one mi&s;carriage in his life, of
which, above all others, he &s;everely repented; the in&s;in|cere
declaration of faith to which he had the weakne&s;s to
con&s;ent, and which the fear of death alone had extorted
from him: That he took this opportunity of atoning for
his error, by a &s;incere and open recantation; and was
willing to &s;eal with his blood that doctrine which he
firmly believed to be communicated from heaven: And
that as his hand had erred by betraying his heart, it &s;hould
fir&s;t be puni&s;hed, by a &s;evere but ju&s;t doom, and &s;ould
fir&s;t pay the forfeit of its offences. He was thence led to
the &s;take amid&s;t the in&s;ults of the catholics; and having
now &s;ummoned up all the force of his mind, he bore $word$
&s;corn as well as the torture of his puni&s;hment with &s;ingular
fortitude. He &s;tretched out his hand, and without be|traying,
either by his countenance or motions, the lea&s;t
&s;ign of weakne&s;s or even of feeling, he held it in the
flames till it was entirely con&s;umed. His thoughts &s;eem|ed
wholly occupied with reflections on his former fault;
and he called aloud &s;everal times, <HI>This hand has offended.</HI>
Satisfied with that atonement, he then di&s;covered a &s;ere|nity
in his countenance; and when the fire attacked his
body, he &s;eemed to be quite in&s;en&s;ible of his outer &s;uffer|ings,
and by the force of hope and re&s;olution to have
<PB N="461" REF="491">
collected his mind altogether within it&s;elf, and to repel
the fury of the flames. It is pretended, that, after his
body was con&s;umed, his heart was found entire and un|touched
amid&s;t the a&s;hes; an event, which, as it was the
emblem of his con&s;tancy, was fondly believed by the zeal|ous
prote&s;tants. He was undoubtedly a man of merit;
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of learning and capacity; and adorned with can|dour,
&s;incerity and beneficence, and all tho&s;e virtues,
which were fitted to render him u&s;eful and amiable in
&s;ociety. His moral qualities procured him univer&s;al re|spect;
and the courage of his martyrdom, though he fell
&s;hort of the rigid inflexibility ob&s;erved in many, made
him the hero of the prote&s;tant party<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 331, 332, &amp;c. Godwin, p. 352.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER Cranmer's death, cardinal Pole, who had now
taken prie&s;t's orders, was in&s;talled in the &s;ee of Canterbury;
and was thus by this office, as well as his commi&s;&s;ion of
legate, placed at the head of the church of England. But
though he was aver&s;e to all the &s;anguinary methods of
converting heretics, and e&s;teemed the reformation of the
clergy the more effectual, as the more laudable expedient
for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. p. 324, 325.</NOTE>; he found his authority too weak to
oppo&s;e the barbarous and bigotted di&s;po&s;ition of the Queen
and of her coun&s;ellors. He him&s;elf, he knew, had been
&s;u&s;pected of Lutherani&s;m; and as Paul, the reigning
pope, was a furious per&s;ecutor and his per&s;onal enemy,
he was prompted, by the mode&s;ty of his di&s;po&s;ition, to
re&s;erve his credit for other occa&s;ions, in which he had
a greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 68, 69. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 327.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE great object of the Queen was to engage the na|tion
in the war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1557.</NOTE> which was kindled between France and
Spain; and cardinal Pole, with many other coun&s;ellors,
<PB N="462" REF="492">
very openly and zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this mea&s;ure. Be&s;ides
in&s;i&s;ting on the marriage articles, which provided again&s;t
&s;uch an attempt, they repre&s;ented the violence of the do|me&s;tic
factions in England, and the di&s;ordered &s;tate of
the finances; and they foreboded, that the tendency of
all the&s;e mea&s;ures was to reduce the kingdom to a total
dependance on Spani&s;h councils. Philip had come to
London in order to &s;upport his partizans; and he told
the Queen, that, if he was not gratified in &s;o rea&s;onable
a reque&s;t, he never more would &s;et foot in England.
This declaration heightened extremely her zeal for pro|moting
his intere&s;ts, and overcoming the inflexibility of
her council. After employing other menaces of a more
violent nature, &s;he threatened to di&s;mi&s;s them all from the
board, and to appoint coun&s;ellors more ob&s;equious; yet
could &s;he not procure a vote for declaring war with
France. At la&s;t, one Stafford and &s;ome other con&s;pira|tors
were detected in a de&s;ign of &s;urprizing Scarborow<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Heylin, p. 72. Burnet, vol. ii. p. 351. Sir James Melvil's Memoirs.</NOTE>; and a confe&s;&s;ion being extorted from them, that they had
been encouraged by Henry in that attempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> the Queen's
importunity prevailed; and it was determined to make
this act of ho&s;tility, with others of a like &s;ecret and
doubtful nature, the ground of the quarrel. War was
accordingly declared again&s;t France; and preparations
were every where made for attacking that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE revenue of England at that time little exceeded

a$$ears to all her &s;ervants, be&s;ides the loans extorted from
her &s;ubjects; the&s;e con&s;iderations had no influence on
her, and &s;he continued to levy money in the &s;ame arbi|trary
and violent manner, which &s;he had formerly prac|ti&s;ed.
She obliged the city of London to &s;upply her with
60,000 pounds on her hu&s;band's entry; &s;he levied before

which &s;he &s;ent over to the Low Countries, under the
command of the earl of Pembroke. Meanwhile, in order
to prevent any di&s;turbance at home, many of the mo&s;t

<P>THE King of Spain had a&s;&s;embled an army, which,
after the junction of the Engli&s;h, amounted to above
&s;ixty thou&s;and &s;trong, commanded by Philibert, duke of
Savoy, one of the greate&s;t captains of the age. The
con&s;table, Montmorency, who commanded the French
army, had not half the number to oppo&s;e him. The
duke of Savoy, after menacing Mariembourg and Rocroy,
&s;at down &s;uddenly before St. Quintin; and as the place
was weak, and ill provided of a garri&s;on, he expected in
a few days to become ma&s;ter of it. But the admiral
<PB N="464" REF="494">
Coligny, governor of the province, thinking his honour
intere&s;ted to &s;ave &s;o important a fortre&s;s, threw him&s;elf
into St. Quintin, with &s;ome troops of French and Scots
gen&s;darmes; and by his exhortation and example animated
the &s;oldiers to a vigorous defence. He di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger
to his uncle, the con&s;table, de&s;iring a &s;upply of men; and
that general approached the place with his whole army,
in order to facilitate the entry of the&s;e &s;uccours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Aug.</NOTE> But the
duke of Savoy falling on the reinforcement, executed &s;uch
&s;laughter upon them, that not above five hundred men
got into the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of St. Quintin.</NOTE> He next made an attack on the
French army, and put them to a total rout, killing four
thou&s;and men, and di&s;per&s;ing the re&s;t. In this unfortu|nate
action many of the chief nobility of France were
either &s;lain or taken pri&s;oners: Among the latter was the
old con&s;table him&s;elf, who fighting valiantly, and re&s;olute
to die rather than &s;urvive his defeat, was &s;urrounded by
the enemy, and thus fell alive into their hands. The
whole kingdom of France was thrown into con&s;ternation:
Paris was attempted to be fortified in a hurry: And had
the Spaniards pre&s;ently marched thither, it could not fail
to have fallen into their hands. But Philip was of a
cautious temper; and he determined fir&s;t to take St.
Quintin, in order to &s;ecure a communication with his
own dominions. A very little time, it was expected,
would fini&s;h this enterprize; but the bravery of Coligny
&s;till prolonged the &s;iege &s;eventeen days, which proved the
&s;afety of France. Some troops were levied and a&s;&s;embled.
Couriers were &s;ent to recall the duke of Gui&s;e and his
army from Italy: And the French having recovered from
their fir&s;t alarm, put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence.
Philip, after taking Ham and Ca&s;telet, found the &s;ea&s;on
&s;o far advanced, that he could attempt no farther enter|prize,
and he broke up his camp and retired to winter quarters.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="495">
BUT the vigilant activity of Gui&s;e, not &s;atisfied with
&s;ecuring the frontiers, prompted him, in the depth of
winter, to attempt an enterprize which France, during
her greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, had always regarded as impo&s;&s;ible,
and had never thought of undertaking. Calais was, in
that age, deemed an impregnable fortre&s;s; and as it was
known to be the favourite of the Engli&s;h nation, by
whom it could ea&s;ily be &s;uccoured, the recovery of that
place by France, was con&s;idered as totally de&s;perate. But
Coligny had remarked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calaistaken by the French.</NOTE> that, as the town of Calais was
&s;urrounded with mar&s;hes, which, during the winter, were
impa&s;&s;ible, except over a dyke guarded by two ca&s;tles,
St. Agatha and Newnam bridge, the Engli&s;h were of
late accu&s;tomed, on account of the lowne&s;s of their finan|ces,
to di&s;mi&s;s a great part of the garri&s;on at the end of
autumn, and to recall them in the &s;pring, at which time
alone they judged their attendance nece&s;&s;ary. On this
circum&s;tance he had founded his de&s;ign of making a &s;ud|den
attack on the place; he had cau&s;ed it to be &s;ecretly
&s;urveyed by &s;ome engineers; and a plan of the whole
enterprize being found among his papers, it &s;erved, tho'
he him&s;elf was made pri&s;oner on the taking of St. Quin|tin,
to &s;ugge&s;t the project of that undertaking, and to
direct the conduct of the duke of Gui&s;e.</P>
<P>SEVERAL bodies of troops defiled towards the frontiers
on various pretences;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1558.</NOTE> and the whole being &s;uddenly a&s;|&s;embled,
formed an army with which the duke of Gui&s;e
made an unexpected march towards Calais. At the &s;ame
time a great number of French &s;hips, being ordered into
the channel, under colour of crui&s;ing on the Engli&s;h,
compo&s;ed a fleet which made an attack by &s;ea on the for|tifications.
The French a&s;&s;aulted St. Agatha with three
thou&s;and harquebu&s;iers; and though the garri&s;on made a
vigorous defence, they were &s;oon obliged to abandon the

place, and retreat towards Newnam bridge. The &s;iege
of this latter place was immediately undertaken, and at
the &s;ame time the fleet battered the ri&s;bank, which guard|ed
the entry of the harbour; and both the&s;e ca&s;tles
&s;eemed expo&s;ed to imminent danger. The governor, lord
Wentworth, was a brave officer, but finding that the
greater part of his weak garri&s;on was enclo&s;ed in New|nam
or the ri&s;bank, he ordered them to capitulate, and to
join him in Calais, which, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he
was utterly unable to defend. The garri&s;on of Newnam
bridge were &s;o happy as to effectuate this purpo&s;e; but
that of the ri&s;bank could not obtain &s;uch favourable con|ditions,
and were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>THE duke of Gui&s;e, now holding the place blockaded
by &s;ea and land, thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of &s;ucceeding in
his enterprize; but in order to prevent all accidents, he
delayed not a moment the attack of the place. He
pointed his batteri$$ towards the ca&s;tle, where he made a
large breach; and having ordered Andelot, Coligny's
brother, to drain the fo&s;&s;&eacute;e, he commanded an a&s;&s;ault,
which &s;ucceeded, and the French made a lodgement in
the ca&s;tle. On the night following Wentworth attempted
to recover this po&s;t; but having lo&s;t two hundred men in
a furious attack which he made upon it<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xx. cap. 2.</NOTE>, he found his
garri&s;on &s;o weak, that he was obliged to capitulate. Ham,
and Gui&s;nes fell &s;oon after; and thus the duke of Gui&s;e,
in eight days, during the depth of winter, recovered this
important place, that had co&s;t Edward the third a &s;iege
of eleven months, at the head of a numerous army,
which had that very campaign been victorious in the bat|tle
of Cre&s;&s;y. The Engli&s;h had held it above two hun|dred
years; and as it gave them, whenever they plea&s;ed,
<PB N="467" REF="499">
an entry into France, it was regarded as the mo&s;t impor|tant
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion belonging to the crown. The joy of the
French was extreme, as well as the glory acquired by the
duke of Gui&s;e, who, at the time that all Europe ima|gined
France to be &s;unk by the unfortunate battle of St.
Quintin, had, in oppo&s;ition to the Engli&s;h, and their
allies the Spaniards, acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a place which
no former King of France, even during the di&s;tractions
of the civil wars, between the hou&s;es of York and Lan|ca&s;ter,
had ever ventured to attempt. The Engli&s;h, on
the other hand, bereaved of this valuable fortre&s;s, mur|mured
loudly again&s;t the imprudence of the Queen and
her council; who, after engaging in a fruitle&s;s war, for
the &s;ake of foreign intere&s;ts, had thus expo&s;ed the nation
to &s;o &s;evere a di&s;grace. A trea&s;ury exhau&s;ted by expen|ces,
and burthened with debts; a people divided and de|jected;
a Sovereign negligent of her people's welfare;
were circum&s;tances which, notwith&s;tanding the fair offers
made by Philip, gave them &s;mall hopes of recovering Ca|lais.
And as the Scots, in&s;tigated by French councils,
began to move on the borders, they were now nece&s;&s;itated
rather to look to their defence at home, than to think of
foreign conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>AFTER the peace, which, in con&s;equence of King
Edward's treaty with Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> took place between Scot|land
and England, the Queen-dowager, on pretence of
vi&s;iting her daughter and her relations, made a journey
to France, and &s;he carried along with her the earls of
Huntley, Sutherland, Mari&s;chal, and many of the prin|cipal
nobility. Her &s;ecret de&s;ign was to take mea&s;ures
for engaging the earl of Arran to re&s;ign to her the govern|ment
of the kingdom; and as her brothers, the duke of
Gui&s;e, the cardinal of Lorraine, and the duke d'Aumale,
had uncontrouled authority in the court of France, &s;he
<PB N="468" REF="500">
ea&s;ily per&s;uaded Henry, and by his means the Scots no|bles,
to enter into her mea&s;ures. Having al&s;o gained over
Carnegy of Kinnaird, Panter, bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, and Gavin
Hamilton, commendator of Kilwinning, three creatures
of the governor's, &s;he per&s;uaded him, by their means, to
con&s;ent to this re&s;ignation<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. xiv. Keith, p. 56. Spot&s;wood, p. 92.</NOTE>; and when every thing was
thus prepared for her purpo&s;e, &s;he took her journey to
Scotland, and pa&s;&s;ed through England in her way thither.
Edward received her with great re&s;pect and civility; tho'
he could not forbear attempting a renewal of the old
treaty for his marriage with her daughter: A marriage,
he &s;aid &s;o happily calculated for the tranquillity, intere&s;t,
and &s;ecurity of both kingdoms, and the only means of
en&s;uring a durable peace between them. For his part,
he added, he never could entertain a cordial amity for any
other hu&s;band whom &s;he &s;hould choo&s;e; nor was it ea&s;y
for him to forgive a man, who, at the &s;ame time that he
di&s;appointed &s;o natural an alliance, had bereaved him of a
bride, to whom his affections, from his earlie&s;t infancy,
had been entirely engaged. The Queen eluded the&s;e ap|plications,
by telling him, that if any mea&s;ures had been
taken di&s;agreeable to him, they were entirely owing to
the imprudence of the duke of Somer&s;et, who, in&s;tead of
imploying courte&s;y, care&s;&s;es, and gentle offices, the pro|per
means of gaining a young prince&s;s, had had recour&s;e
to arms and violence, and had con&s;trained the Scots no|bility
to &s;end their &s;overeign into France, in order to in|tere&s;t
that kingdom in protecting their liberty and inde|pendence<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the Queen-dowager arrived in Scotland, &s;he
found the governor very unwilling to fulfil his engage|ments;
and it was not till after many delays that he could be
<PB N="469" REF="501">
per&s;uaded to re&s;ign his authority. But finding that the
majority of the young prince&s;s was approaching, and that
the Queen-dowager had gained the affections of all the
principal nobility, he thought it more prudent to &s;ubmit;
and having &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould be declared next
heir to the crown, and &s;hould be freed from giving any
account of his pa&s;t admini&s;tration, he placed her in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the power; and &s;he thenceforth a&s;&s;umed the
name of regent<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">12 April 1554.</NOTE>. It was an u&s;ual &s;aying of this prince&s;s,
that provided &s;he could render her friends happy, and
could en&s;ure to her&s;elf a good reputation, &s;he was entirely
indifferent what befel her; and though this &s;entiment is
greatly cen&s;ured by the zealous reformers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Knox, p. 89.</NOTE>, as being
founded wholly on &s;ecular motives, it di&s;covers a mind
well calculated for the admini&s;tration of kingdoms.
D' Oi&s;el, a Frenchman, celebrated for capacity, had at|tended
her as amba&s;&s;ador from Henry, but in reality to
a&s;&s;i&s;t her with his coun&s;els in &s;o delicate an undertaking as
the government of Scotland; and this man had formed a
&s;cheme for laying a general tax on the kingdom, in
order to &s;upport a &s;tanding military force, which might
at once repul&s;e the inroads of foreign enemies, and check
the turbulence of the Scots nobility. But though &s;ome
of the courtiers were gained over to this project, it gave
great and general di&s;content to the nation; and the
Queen-regent, after ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ing, that it would
prove pernicious to the kingdom, had the prudence to
de&s;i&s;t from it, and to tru&s;t entirely for her &s;ecurity to the
good-will and affections of her &s;ubjects<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Keith, p. 70. Buchanan, lib. xvi.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS laudable purpo&s;e &s;eemed to be the chief object
of her admini&s;tration; yet was &s;he &s;ometimes drawn from
it by her connections with France, and by the influence
<PB N="470" REF="502">
which her brothers had acquired over her. When Mary
declared war again&s;t that kingdom, Henry required the
Queen-regent to take part in the quarrel; and &s;he &s;um|moned
a convention of &s;tates at Newbottle, and reque&s;ted
them to concur in a declaration of war again&s;t England.
The Scots nobles, who were as jealous of French as
the Engli&s;h were of Spani&s;h influence, refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;ent;
and the Queen was obliged to have recour&s;e to artifice,
in order to effectuate her purpo&s;e. She ordered d' Oi&s;el
to begin &s;ome fortifications at Eymouth, a place which
had been di&s;mantled by the la&s;t treaty with Edward; and
when the garri&s;on of Berwic, as &s;he fore&s;aw, made an
inroad to prevent the undertaking, &s;he effectually em|ployed
this pretence to inflame the Scots nation, and to
engage them in ho&s;tilities again&s;t England<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. xvi. Thuan. lib. xix. c. 7.</NOTE>. The enter|prize,
however, of the Scots proceeded no farther than
&s;ome inroads on the borders; and when d' Oi&s;el, of
him&s;elf, conducted artillery and troops of be&s;iege the ca&s;tle
of Werke, he was recalled, and very &s;harply rebuked by
the council<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Knox, p 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to connect Scotland more clo&s;ely with France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the dauphin and the Queen of Scots.</NOTE>
and to encrea&s;e the influence of the latter kingdom, it was
thought proper by Henry to compleat the marriage be|tween
the young Queen and the dauphin; and a deputa|tion
was &s;ent by the Scots Parliament, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at this
ceremony, and to &s;ettle the terms of the contract. This
deputation con&s;i&s;ted of the archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, the
bi&s;hops of Ro&s;s and the Orkneys, the earls of Rothes,
and Ca&s;&s;ilis, the lords Fleming and Seton, James Stuart,
prior of St Andrews, natural brother to the Queen, and
Er&s;kine of Dun. The principal conditions recommended
to the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, was to obtain a &s;olemn engage|ment
<PB N="471" REF="503">
from the Queen and dauphin, that they would pre|&s;erve
the laws and privileges of Scotland, and to procure
a renewal of the French King's promi&s;e, to &s;upport, in
ca&s;e of the Queen's death, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the earl of
Arran, now created duke of Chatelraut. Both the&s;e
conditions were ea&s;ily obtained; but the court of France
took a very perfidious &s;tep, directly contrary to the&s;e &s;ti|pulations:
They &s;ecretly engaged the young Queen to
&s;ign three papers; by one of which &s;he made over the
kingdom of Scotland in gift to the King of France, in
ca&s;e of her decea&s;e without children; by another, &s;he
mortgaged it to him for a million of crowns of gold, or
&s;uch greater &s;um as he &s;hould have expended for her
maintenance and &s;upport; and by a third &s;he declared,
that whatever deed &s;he had been obliged, or &s;hould here|after
be obliged to perform, relative to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
crown, &s;hould be entirely invalid, and that her real
&s;en&s;e and intention was contained in the fir&s;t paper.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 April.</NOTE> The
marriage was &s;olemnized at Paris: The commi&s;&s;ioners,
in the name of the &s;tates of Scotland, &s;wore allegiance
to the Queen, and, during the continuance of the mar|riage,
to the King-dauphin, &s;o he was called: And
every thing &s;eemed to proceed with great unanimity and
concord. But the commi&s;&s;ioners being required to deliver
up the crown, and other en&s;igns of royalty, made an&s;wer,
that they had received no authority for that purpo&s;e; and
they &s;oon after &s;et out on their journey for Scotland. It
is remarkable, that before they embarked, four of the
commi&s;&s;ioners died, within a few days of each other;
and a violent, though ab&s;urd &s;u&s;picion prevailed, that
they had been poi&s;oned by orders from the family of Gui&s;e,
on account of this refu&s;al<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. xvi. Keith, p. 75. Spot&s;wood, p 95.</NOTE>. It was not con&s;idered, that
that accident, however rare, might have happened by the
<PB N="472" REF="504">
cour&s;e of nature; and that the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, though
not attended with any pe&s;tilential di&s;order, was, to a re|markable
degree, unhealthy all over Europe.</P>
<P>THE clo&s;e alliance between France and Scotland
threatned very nearly the repo&s;e and &s;ecurity of England;
and it was fore&s;een, that, though the factions and di&s;|orders
which might naturally be expected in the Scots
government during the ab&s;ence of their &s;overeign, would
make its power le&s;s formidable, that kingdom would at
lea&s;t afford to the French a means of invading England.
The Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Jan.</NOTE> therefore, found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ummon a
Parliament, and to demand of them &s;ome &s;upplies to her
exhau&s;ted exchequer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> As &s;uch an emergency u&s;ually gives
great advantage to the people, and as the Parliaments,
during this reign, had &s;hewn, that, where the liberty
and independency of the kingdom were menaced with
imminent danger, they were not entirely overawed by
the court; we &s;hall naturally expect, that the late arbi|trary
methods of extorting money &s;hould, at lea&s;t, be
cen&s;ured, and, perhaps, &s;ome remedy be for the future
provided again&s;t them. But &s;uch an exorbitant preroga|tive
was at this time acknowleged to belong to the crown,
that, though men might complain of its pre&s;ent abu&s;es,
all attempts to retrench it would have been regarded as
the mo&s;t criminal enterprize; and as that prerogative
involved a large di&s;cretionary power, any parliamentary
enquiry into its exerci&s;e, would have pa&s;&s;ed for in&s;olent
and pre&s;umptuous. The commons, therefore, without
making any reflections on the pa&s;t, voted, be&s;ides a fif|teenth,
a &s;ub&s;idy of four &s;hillings in the pound on land,
and two &s;hillings and eight pence on goods. The clergy
granted eight &s;hillings in the pound, payable in four years
by equal portions.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="505">
THE Parliament al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an act, confirming all the
&s;ales and grants of crown lands, which were either made
already by the Queen, or &s;hould be made during the
&s;even en&s;uing years. It was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that, in the
Queen's pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition and &s;ituation, this power would
be followed by a great alienation of the royal deme&s;nes;
and nothing could be more contrary to the principles of
good government, than a prince armed with very exten|&s;ive
authority, and yet reduced to beggary. This act
met with oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of commons. One
Copley expre&s;&s;d his fears le&s;t the Queen, under colour
of the power there granted, might alienate the crown
from the lawful heir: But his words were thought <HI>irre|verent</HI>
to her maje&s;ty: He was committed to the cu&s;tody
of the &s;erjeant at arms; and though he expre&s;&s;ed &s;orrow
for his offence, he was not relea&s;ed till the Queen was
applied to for his pardon.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h nation, during this whole reign, were
in continual apprehen&s;ions with regard not only to the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but the life of the lady Elizabeth. The vio|lent
hatred which the Queen bore her, broke out on
every occa&s;ion; and it required all the authority of Philip,
as well as her own great prudence, to prevent the fatal
effects of it. The prince&s;s retired into the country; and
knowing that &s;he was &s;urrounded with &s;pies, &s;he pa&s;t her
time wholly in reading and &s;tudy, intermeddled in no
bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;aw very little company. While &s;he re|mained
in this &s;ituation, which was for the pre&s;ent very
melancholy, but which prepared her mind for tho&s;e great
actions by which her life was afterwards &s;o much di&s;tin|gui&s;hed;
propo&s;als of marriage were made her by the
Swedi&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, in his ma&s;ter's name. As her fir&s;t
que&s;tion was, whether the Queen had been informed of
the&s;e propo&s;als; the amba&s;&s;ador told her, that his ma&s;ter
<PB N="474" REF="506">
thought, as he was a gentleman, it was his duty fir&s;t to
make his addre&s;&s;es to her&s;elf; and having obtained her
con&s;ent, he would next as a King, apply to her &s;i&s;ter.
But the prince&s;s would allow him to proceed no further;
and the Queen, after thanking her for this in&s;tance of
duty, de&s;ired to know how &s;he &s;tood affected to the Swe|di&s;h
propo&s;als. Elizabeth, though expo&s;ed to many pre|&s;ent
dangers and mortifications, had the magnanimity to
re&s;erve her&s;elf for better fortune; and &s;he covered her
refu&s;al with profe&s;&s;ions of a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to a
&s;ingle life, which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he infinitely preferred be|fore
any other<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. ii. Collect. N^o 37.</NOTE>. The prince&s;s &s;howed like prudence in
concealing her &s;entiments of religion, in complying with
the pre&s;ent modes of wor&s;hip, and in eluding all que&s;tions
with regard to that delicate &s;ubject<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>The common net at that time, &s;ays Sir Richard Baker, for catching of prote&s;tants, was the real pre&s;ence; and this net was u&s;ed to catch the lady Elizabeth: For being a&s;ked one time what &s;he thought of the words of Chri&s;t, <HI>This is my body,</HI> whether &s;he thought it the true body of Chri&s;t that was in the Sacrament; it is &s;aid, that, after &s;ome pau&s;ing, &s;he thus an&s;wered:
<Q><L>Chri&s;t was the word that &s;pake it;</L>
<L>He took the bread and brake it;</L>
<L>And what the word did make it,</L>
<L>That I believe and take it.</L></Q>
Which, though it may &s;eem but a &s;light expre&s;&s;ion, yet hath it more &s;olidne&s;s than at fir&s;t &s;ight appears; at lea&s;t it &s;erved her turn at that time, to e&s;cape the net, which by direct an&s;wer &s;he could not have done. Baker's Chronicle, p. 320.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE money granted by Parliament, enabled the Queen
to fit out a fleet of a hundred and forty &s;ail, which, being
joined by thirty Flemi&s;h &s;hips, and carrying &s;ix thou&s;and
land &s;orces on board, was &s;ent to make an attempt on the
coa&s;t of Brittany. The fleet was commanded by lord
<PB N="475" REF="507">
Clinton; the land forces by the earls of Huntingdon and
Rutland. But the equipment of the fleet and army was
&s;o dilatory, that the French got intelligence of the de&s;ign,
and were prepared to receive them. The Engli&s;h found
Bre&s;t too well guarded to make an attempt on that place;
but landing at Conquet, they plundered and burnt the
town with &s;ome adjoining villages, and were proceeding
to commit greater di&s;orders, when Ker&s;imon, a Breton
gentleman, at the head of &s;ome militia, fell upon them,
put them to rout, and drove them to their &s;hips with
con&s;iderable lo&s;s. But a &s;mall &s;quadron of ten Engli&s;h
&s;hips, had an opportunity of amply revenging this di&s;|grace
upon the French. The Mare&s;chal de Thermes,
governor of Calais, had made an irruption into Flanders,
with an army of fourteen thou&s;and men; and having
forced a pa&s;&s;age over the river Aa, had taken Dunkirk,
and Berg St. Winoc, and had advanced as far as New|port.
But count Egmont coming &s;uddenly upon him,
with &s;uperior forces, he was obliged to retire; and be|ing
overtaken by the Spaniards near Gravelines, he cho&s;e
very &s;kilfully his ground for the engagement. He fortified
his left wing with all the precautions po&s;&s;ible; and po&s;ted
his right along the river Aa, which, he rea&s;onably
thought, gave him a full &s;ecurity from that quarter.
But the Engli&s;h &s;hips, which were accidentally on the
coa&s;t, being drawn by the noi&s;e of the firing, &s;ailed up the
river, and flanking the French, did &s;uch execution by
their artillery, that they put them to flight, and the Spa|niards
gained a compleat victory<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 1150.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the principal army of France, under
the duke of Gui&s;e, and that of Spain, under the duke
of Savoy, approached very near each other on the fron|tiers
of Picardy; and as the two Kings had come into
<PB N="476" REF="508">
their re&s;pective camps, attended by the flower of their
nobility, men expected that &s;ome great and important
event would follow, from the emulation of the&s;e warlike
nations. But Philip, though actuated by ambition, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
not the enterprize, of a conqueror; and he was
willing, notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperiority of his numbers,
and the two great victories which he had gained at St.
Quintin and Gravelines, to put a period to the war by a
treaty. Negociations were entered into for that purpo&s;e;
and as the terms offered by the two monarchs were &s;ome|what
wide of each other, the armies were put into winter
quarters, till the princes could come to better agree|ment.
Among other conditions, Henry demanded the
re&s;titution of Navarre to its lawful owner; Philip that
of Calais and its territory to England: But in the mid&s;t
of the&s;e negociations and debates, news arrived of the
death of Queen Mary; and Philip, no longer connected
with England, began to relax in his in&s;tances on that
capital article. This was the only circum&s;tance which
could have made the death of that prince&s;s a lo&s;s to the
kingdom.</P>
<P>MARY had been long in a very declining &s;tate of
health; and having mi&s;taken her drop&s;y for a pregnancy,
&s;he had made u&s;e of an improper regimen, and her ma|lady
daily augmented. Every reflection now tormented
her: The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being hated by her &s;ubjects,
the pro&s;pect of Elizabeth's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, apprehen&s;ions of
the danger to which the catholic religion &s;tood expo&s;ed,
dejected for the lo&s;s of Calais<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The lo&s;s of Calais &s;o much affected her, that &s;he &s;aid to her atten|dants, that when &s;he was dead, they would find Calais at her heart.</NOTE>, concern for the ill &s;tate
of her affairs, and, above all, anxiety for the ab&s;ence of
her hu&s;band, who, &s;he knew, intended &s;oon to depart
for Spain, and to &s;ettle there during the re&s;t of his life:
<PB N="477" REF="509">
All the&s;e melancholy circum&s;tances preyed upon her
mind, and threw her into a lingering fever, of which &s;he
died, after a &s;hort and unfortunate reign of five years,
four months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Queen. 17th Nov.</NOTE> and eleven days.</P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to employ many words in drawing
the character of this prince&s;s. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed few quali|ties,
either e&s;timable or amiable; and her per&s;on was as
little engaging as her behaviour and addre&s;s. Ob&s;tinacy,
bigotry, violence, cruelty, malignity, revenge, tyranny;
every circum&s;tance of her character took a tincture from
her bad temper and narrow under&s;tanding. And amid&s;t
that complication of vices, which entered into her com|po&s;ition,
we &s;hall &s;carce find any virtue but &s;incerity; a
quality, which &s;he &s;eems to have maintained throughout
her whole life; except in the beginning of her reign,
when the nece&s;&s;ity of her affairs obliged her to make
&s;ome promi&s;es to the prote&s;tants, which &s;he certainly
never intended to perform. But in the&s;e ca&s;es a weak
bigotted woman, under the government of prie&s;ts, ea&s;ily
finds ca&s;ui&s;try &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify to her&s;elf the violation
of an engagement. She appears al&s;o, as well as her
father, to have been &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome attachments of
friend&s;hip; and that without the caprice and incon|&s;tancy
which were &s;o remarkable in the conduct of
that monarch. To which we may add, that, in many
circum&s;tances of her life, &s;he gave indications of re&s;o|lution
and vigour of mind; a quality, which &s;eems to
have been inherent in her family.</P>
<P>CARDINAL Pole had been long in a declining &s;tate
of health from an intermiting fever; and he died the
&s;ame day with the Queen, about &s;ixteen hours after
her. The benign character of this prelate, the mode&s;ty
and humanity of his deportment, made him be univer|&s;ally
beloved; in&s;omuch that in a nation, where the
mo&s;t furious per&s;ecution was carried on, and the mo&s;t
<PB N="478" REF="510">
violent religious factions prevailed, entire ju&s;tice, even
by mo&s;t of the reformers, has been done to his merit.
The haughty pontiff, Paul the fourth, had entertained
&s;ome prejudices again&s;t him; and when England declared
war again&s;t Henry, the ally of that pope, he &s;eized the
opportunity of revenge, and revoking Pole's legantine
commi&s;&s;ion, appointed in his room cardinal Peyto, an
ob&s;ervantine friar and confe&s;&s;or to the Queen. But
Mary would never permit the new legate to exerci&s;e his
power; and Paul was afterwards obliged to re&s;tore car|dinal
Pole to his authority.</P>
<P>THERE occur few general remarks, be&s;ides what have
been already made in the cour&s;e of our narration, with
regard to the general &s;tate of the kingdom during this
reign. The naval power of England was then &s;o incon|&s;iderable,
that fourteen thou&s;and pounds being ordered
to be applied to the fleet by the trea&s;urer and admiral,
both for repairing and victualling it, they computed,
that, when the money was expended, ten thou&s;and
pounds a year would afterwards an&s;wer all nece&s;&s;ary
charges<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. iii. p. 259.</NOTE>. The arbitrary proceedings of the Queen,
abovementioned, joined to many monopolies granted by
this prince&s;s, as well as by her father, checked very
much the growth of trade; and &s;o much the more, as
all other princes in Europe either were not permitted or
did not find it nece&s;&s;ary to act in &s;o tyrannical a manner.
Acts of Parliament, both in the la&s;t reign and in the
beginning of the pre&s;ent, had laid the &s;ame impo&s;itions
on the merchants of the &s;till-yard as on other aliens:
Yet the Queen, immediately after her marriage, com|plied
with the &s;olicitations of the emperor, and, by her
prerogative, &s;u&s;pended the&s;e acts of Parliament<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xv. p. 364.</NOTE>. No
body in that age pretended to que&s;tion this exerci&s;e of
<PB N="479" REF="511">
the prerogative. The hi&s;torians are entirely &s;ilent with
regard to it; and it is only by the collection of public
papers that it is handed down to us.</P>
<P>AN ab&s;urd law had been made in the preceding reign,
by which every one was prohibited from making cloth
unle&s;s he had &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip for &s;even years.
This law was repealed in the fir&s;t year of the Queen's
reign; and this plain rea&s;on given, that it had occa&s;ioned
the decay of the woollen manufactory, and had ruined
&s;everal towns<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">1 Mar. Parl. 2. cap. 7.</NOTE>. It is &s;trange that Edward's law &s;hould
have been revived during the reign of Elizabeth; and
&s;till more &s;trange, that it &s;hould &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>A PASSAGE to Archangel had been di&s;covered by the
Engli&s;h during the la&s;t reign; and a beneficial trade with
Mu&s;covy had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. A &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y was
&s;ent by the Czar to Queen Mary. The amba&s;&s;adors
were &s;hipwrecked on the coa&s;t of Scotland; but being
ho&s;pitably entertained there, they proceeded on their
journey, and were received at London with great pomp
and &s;olemnity<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 732. Heylin, p. 71.</NOTE>. This &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t inter|cour&s;e,
which that empire had with any of the we&s;tern
potentates of Europe.</P>
<P>A LAW was pa&s;&s;ed in this reign<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. cap. 2.</NOTE>, by which the
number of hor&s;es, arms, and furniture, was fixed, which
each per&s;on; according to the extent of his property,
&s;hould be provided of for the defence of the kingdom.
A man of a thou&s;and pounds a year, for in&s;tance, was
obliged to maintain at his own charge &s;ix hor&s;es fit for
demi-lances, of which three at lea&s;t to be furni&s;hed with
&s;ufficient harne&s;&s;es, &s;teel &s;addles, and weapons proper
for the demi-lances; and ten light hor&s;es fit for light
<PB N="480" REF="512">
hor&s;emen, with furniture and weapons requi&s;ite for them,
He was al&s;o obliged to have forty cor&s;lets furni&s;hed; fifty
almain revets, or in&s;tead of them, forty coats of plate,
cor&s;lets or brigandines furni&s;hed; forty pikes, thirty long
bows, thirty &s;heafs of arrows, thirty &s;teel caps or &s;kulls,
twenty black bills or halberts, twenty haquebuts, and
twenty morions or &s;allets. We may remark, that a man
of a thou&s;and marks of &s;tock was rated equal to one of
two hundred pounds a year: A proof that few or none
at that time lived on their &s;tock in money, and that great
profits were made by the merchants in the cour&s;e of
their trade. There is no cla&s;s above a thou&s;and pounds
a year.</P>
