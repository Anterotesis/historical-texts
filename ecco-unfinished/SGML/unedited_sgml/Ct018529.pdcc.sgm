<L>O'er mountains he &s;weeps,</L>
<L>Through de&s;arts and &s;teeps,</L>
<L>Till our javelins are drench'd in his gore;</L>
<L>Then madly foaming,</L>
<L>Deeply groaning,</L>
<L>The fore&s;ts re-echo his cries;</L>
<L>The pul&s;e of life ru&s;hes,</L>
<L>A &s;tream of blood gu&s;hes,</L>
<L>And writhing in torture he dies.</L>
<L>Thus we'll hunt the Chri&s;tian &s;laves,</L>
<L>Cha&s;e them from their gloomy caves,</L>
<L>And death &s;hall ru&s;h on like a &s;tood:</L>
<L>While they welter in gore,</L>
<L>We'll laugh, &s;hout and roar,</L>
<L>And revel in carnage and blood.</L>
