<SALUTE>COURTEOUS READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF, after having purcha&s;ed <HI>My Night&mdash;gown, and Slippers,</HI> you hold them two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence all too dear, you have only to journey to the foun|tain Ca&s;talius, in Baeotia, at the very bottom of Mount Parna&s;&s;us, (where &s;uch mere <HI>bijoux</HI> as the&s;e are manufactured) and I will return you the mo|ney:&mdash;Provided, at the &s;ame time, that you, there, do return to me my goods, clean, and uncut.</P>
<P>Let me, however, give you a brief account of the&s;e Trifles.</P>
<P><HI>The Maid of the Moor, the Newca&s;tle Apothecary,</HI> and <HI>Lodgings for &s;ingle Gentlemen,</HI> are &s;lip-&s;hod Tales, written for an Entertainment which I pro|po&s;ed to offer to the Publick, at the Haymarket Theatre, during Lent; and two of them were intended to be <HI>&s;poken,</HI> (read them, therefore, with a view to recitation) and the third to be &s;ung, as light matter, calculated to relieve the gravity of a didactick performance.</P>
<P>The whole performance (for rea&s;ons unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, here) was relinqui&s;hed:&mdash;</P>
<P>But, as it is my cu&s;tom to avoid the accumulation of my own papers, in my Bureau, I hold it more advi&s;eable to print my three Stories (light as they are) than to burn them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">I have put them into a kind of Crambo-vehicle, to make them connect; and, if <HI>The Maid of the Moor</HI> acts as an antidote, with o$e Foard$ng-&s;chool Mi&s;s, to the poi&s;on, &s;o plentifully di&s;tributed, in the &s;hape of Novels, Ro|mances, Legendary Tales, &amp;c. &amp;c. I may &s;ay, with Philo&s;ophers, that the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant things are of &s;ome utility.</P>

<L>A Man, in many a country town, we know,</L>
<L>Profe&s;&s;ing openly with death to wre&s;tle;</L>
<L>Ent'ring the field again&s;t the grimly foe,</L>
<L>Arm'd with a mortar, and a pe&s;tle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, &s;ome affirm, no enemies they are;</L>
<L>But meet ju&s;t like prize-fighters, in a Fair:</L>
<L>Who fir&s;t &s;hake hands before they box,</L>
<L>Then give each other plaguy knocks,</L>
<L>With all the love and kindne&s;s of a brother:</L>
<L>So (many a &s;uff'ring Patient &s;aith)</L>
<L>Though the Apothecary fights with Death,</L>
