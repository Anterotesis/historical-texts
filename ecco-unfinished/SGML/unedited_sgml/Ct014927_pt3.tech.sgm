<P>_POETRY is a mixture of Hi&s;tory and Fa|ble;
the foundation is hi&s;torical, becau&s;e
the Poet does not entirely neglect truth; the
re&s;t is fabulous, becau&s;e naked truth would
not be &s;ufficiently &s;urprizing; for the Mar|vellous
ought to take place, e&s;pecially in
Epic Poetry. But it may be ask'd, does not
<HI>Homer</HI> offend again&s;t all degrees of probabi|lity
in the&s;e Epi&s;odes of the <HI>Sirens, Scylla</HI>
and <HI>Charybdis, Cyclops</HI> and <HI>Antiphates?</HI> How are the&s;e incredible
&s;tories to be reduc'd into the bounds of probability? 'tis true,
the Marvellous ought to be u&s;ed in Epic Poetry; but ought it to
tran&s;gre&s;s all power of belief? <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI> lays
down a rule to ju&s;tifie the&s;e incidents; <HI>A Poet,</HI> &s;ays that Author,
<HI>ought to prefer things impo&s;&s;ible, provided they are probable, before things
po&s;&s;ible, that are neverthele&s;s incredible.</HI> Chap. 15. This $word$
<PB N="42" REF="43">
not without ob&s;curity; but Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dacier</HI> has explain'd it in his
Annotations upon that Author: A thing may be impo&s;&s;ible, and
yet probable: Thus when the Poet introduces a Deity, any inci|dent
humanly impo&s;&s;ible receives a full probability by being a&s;cri|bed
to the skill and power of a God: 'Tis thus we ju&s;tifie the
&s;tory of the transformation of the &s;hip of the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> into a
rock, and the fleet of <HI>Aeneas</HI> into Sea-nymphs. But &s;uch relati|ons
ought not to be too frequent in a Poem; for it is an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
rule, that all incidents which require a divine probability
only, &s;hould be &s;o di&s;engaged from the action, that they may be
&s;ub&s;tracted from, it, without de&s;troying it; for in&s;tance, if we
omit the transformation of the &s;hip, the action of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> will
retain the &s;ame perfection. And therefore tho&s;e Epi&s;odes which
are nece&s;&s;ary, and make e&s;&s;ential parts of the Poem, ought to be
grounded upon human probability; now the Epi&s;odes of <HI>Circe,
Polypheme,</HI> the <HI>Sirens, &amp;c.</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary to the action of the <HI>O|dy&s;&s;ey:</HI>
But will any man &s;ay they are within the bounds of hu|man
probability? How then &s;hall we &s;olve this difficulty? <HI>Homer</HI>
artificially has brought them within the degrees of it; he makes
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> relate them before a credulous and ignorant a&s;&s;embly; he
lets us into the character of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> by &s;aying they were
a very dull nation, in the &s;ixth book,
<Q>Where never Science rear'd her laurel'd head.</Q>
It is thus the Poet gives probability to his fables, by reciting
them to a people who believ'd them, and who thro' a lazine&s;s
of life were fond of romantic &s;tories; he adapts him&s;elf to his
audience, and yet even here he is not unmindful of his more in|telligent
Readers; he gives them (ob&s;erves <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI>) in the&s;e fables all
the plea&s;ure that can be reap'd from phy&s;ical or moral truths, di&s;|guis'd
under miraculous Allegories, and by this method recon|ciles
them to poetical probability.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal heads to which Probability may be reduced;
either to Divinity, and then nothing is improbable, for every thing
is po&s;&s;ible to a Deity; or to our Ideas of things whether true or
<PB N="43" REF="44">
fal&s;e: thus in the de&s;cent of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> into Hell, there is not one word
of probability or hi&s;toric truth, but if we examine it by the
ideas that the old world entertain'd of Hell, it becomes probable;
or la&s;tly, we may have re&s;pect to vulgar opinion or fame; for a
Poet is at liberty to relate a fal&s;hood, provided it be commonly
believ'd to be true. We might have recour&s;e to this la&s;t rule,
which is likewi&s;e laid down by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> to vindicate the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI>
if there were occa&s;ion for it; for in all ages &s;uch fables have found
belief.</P>
<P>I will only add, that <HI>Virgil</HI> has given a &s;anction to the&s;e &s;tories,
by in&s;erting them in his <HI>Aeneis;</HI> and <HI>Horace</HI> calls them by the re|markable
epithet of <HI>&s;pecious</HI> miracles.
<Q><L>&mdash;Ut &s;pecio&s;a dehinc miracula promat,</L>
<L>Antiphaten, Scyllamque &amp; cum Cyclope Charybdin.</L></Q>
<HI>Longinus</HI> calls the&s;e fables Dreams, but adds, that they are the
dreams of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> he likewi&s;e blames the&s;e Epi&s;odes, becau&s;e in
all of them there is much more fable and narration than action;
Which critici&s;m may perhaps be too &s;evere, if we con&s;ider that
pa&s;t adventures are here brought into pre&s;ent u&s;e, and tho' they
be not actions, yet they are the repre&s;entations of actions, agreea|ble
to the nature of Epi&s;odes.</P>
<P>It may be que&s;tion'd if <HI>Virgil</HI> is &s;o happy in the choice of the
audience, to which he relates many of the&s;e fables; the <HI>Carthagi|nians</HI>
were not ignorant, like the <HI>Phaeacians:</HI> From whence then
do his &s;tories receive their Probability? It is not &s;o ea&s;y to an&s;wer
this objection, unle&s;s we have recour&s;e to common fame: <HI>Virgil</HI>
was not the Author of them, <HI>Homer</HI> had e&s;tabli&s;h'd them, and
brought them into fame, &s;o that <HI>Virgil</HI> had common opinion to
vindicate him, joyn'd with <HI>Homer's</HI> authority.</P>

<P>VERSE 1. <HI>We reach'd</HI> Aeolia'<HI>s &s;hore.</HI>] It is difficult to di|&s;tingui&s;h
what is truth from what is fiction in this relation: <HI>Dio|dorus,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="45">
who was a <HI>Sicilian,</HI> &s;peaks of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> and refers to this pa&s;|&s;age:
&startq;This is that <HI>Aeolus,</HI> &s;ays he, who entertain'd <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in
his voyages: He is reported to have been a pious and ju&s;t
Prince, and given to ho&s;pitality, and therefore <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
as <HI>Homer</HI> expre&s;&s;es it.&endq; But whence has the fable of his being
the Governour of the Winds taken its foundation? <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> tells
us, that he was a very wi&s;e man and one who from long ob&s;er|vation
could foretell what weather was like to follow: others &s;ay
he was an A&s;tronomer, and &s;tudied chiefly the nature of the Winds;
and as <HI>Atlas</HI> from his knowledge in A&s;trology was &s;aid to &s;u&s;tain
the heavens; &s;o <HI>Aeolus,</HI> from his experience and ob&s;ervation, was fa|bled
to be the ruler or di&s;po&s;er of the Winds. But what explication
can be given of this bag, in which he is &s;aid to bind the Winds?
<HI>Erato&s;thenes,</HI> continues <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> &s;aid plea&s;antly, that we &s;hall then
find the places where <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> voyag'd, when we have di&s;cover'd
the arti&s;t, or cobler, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, who &s;ew'd up this bag of the
winds. But the rea&s;on of the fiction is &s;uppos'd to be this: <HI>Aeo|lus</HI>
taught the u&s;e and management of &s;ails, and having foretold
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> from what quarter the winds would blow, he may be
&s;aid to have gather'd them into a kind of enclo&s;ure, and retain'd
them as u&s;e &s;hould require. <HI>Diodorus</HI> explains it a little differently,
<HI>lib.</HI> 5. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; that is, &startq;He taught the u&s;e of &s;ails, and having
learn'd from ob&s;erving the bearing of the &s;moke and fires (of
tho&s;e <HI>Vulcanian</HI> I&s;lands) what winds would blow, he u&s;ually
foretold them with exactne&s;s, and from hence he is fabled to be
the di&s;po&s;er of the winds.&endq; The words of <HI>Varro,</HI> quoted by
<HI>Servius,</HI> are to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: <HI>Varro autem dicit hunc in&s;ularum
regem fui&s;&s;e, ex quarum nebulis &amp; fumo Vulcaniae in&s;ulae praedicens fu|tura
flabra ventorum, ab imperitis vi&s;us e&s;t ventos &s;u$ pote&s;tate re|tinere.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Polybius</HI> will not admit that this &s;tory of <HI>Aeolus</HI> is entirely
fable; and <HI>Strabo</HI> is of the &s;ame opinion, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was in the
<HI>Sicilian</HI> &s;eas; and that there was &s;uch a King as <HI>Aeolus,</HI> he affirms
<PB N="45" REF="46">
to be truth, but that he met with &s;uch adventures is, in the main,
fiction. There may another rea&s;on, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves, be
given for the fiction of binding up the winds in a bag: they who
practis'd the art of Incantation or charms, made u&s;e of the skin
of a Dolphin, and pretended by certain ceremonies to bind or
loo&s;e the winds as they plea&s;ed; and this practice is a &s;ufficient
ground to build upon in Poetry.</P>
<P>The &s;olution al&s;o of <HI>Bochart</HI> is worth our notice: <HI>Homer</HI> bor|row'd
the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> from the <HI>Phaeacian Aol,</HI> which &s;ignifies a
whirlwind or tempe&s;t, from whence the <HI>Greeks</HI> form'd their word
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> ob&s;erving the King of this I&s;land to be
very expert in foretelling the winds, call'd him King <HI>Aolin,</HI> or
King of the winds and &s;torms; from hence <HI>Homer</HI> form'd a pro|per
name, and call'd him <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that
this &s;olution is ingenious, and not without an appearance of pro|bability.</P>
<P>But having laid together what may be &s;aid in vindication of
this &s;tory of <HI>Aeolus:</HI> Ju&s;tice requires that I &s;hould not &s;uppre&s;s
what has been objected again&s;t it by no le&s;s a Critic than <HI>Lon|ginus:</HI>
he ob&s;erves that a genius naturally lofty &s;ometimes falls
into trifling; an in&s;tance of this, adds he, is what <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ays of

&s;ilent concerning his daughters; and therefore others, who can find
my&s;teries in the plaine&s;t de&s;cription, a&s;&s;ure us, that this is not to
be under&s;tood hi&s;torically, but allegorically: <HI>Aeolus</HI> repre&s;ents the
year, his twelve children are the twelve months, &s;ix of which
are female, to denote tho&s;e &s;ix months in which the earth brings
forth her fruits; by his &s;ix &s;ons the other months are under|&s;tood,
in which the &s;eed is &s;own, or in which the herbs, fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are nouri&s;h'd in order to production, the&s;e may therefore be call'd
males. But this is to darken an Author into my&s;tery, not to explain
him. <HI>Dacier</HI> gives us another allegorical interpretation: The Poet
makes him the governour of the winds, and gives him twelve
children, the&s;e denote the twelve principal winds; half of which
children are males, half females; the males denote the winter winds,
which as it were brood upon the earth, and generate its increa&s;e;
the females tho&s;e warmer &s;ea&s;ons of the year, when the more
prolific winds blow, and make the earth teem with fruitfulne&s;s:
The&s;e children of <HI>Aeolus</HI> are in continual fea&s;ts in his Palace; that
is, the winds are continually fed by the exhalations from the earth,
which may be call'd their food or nouri&s;hment: The brothers and
&s;i&s;ters inter-marry; this denotes the nature of the winds, which
blow promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and one wind unites it &s;elf with another
from all quarters of the world indifferently: The brothers and
&s;i&s;ters are &s;aid to &s;leep by night together; that is, the winds are
u&s;ually &s;till and calm, and as it were re&s;t together, at that &s;ea&s;on.

<P>VERSE 94. <HI>The &s;hepherd quitting here at night the plain,</HI> &amp;c.]
This pa&s;&s;age has been thought to be very difficult; but <HI>Eu&s;tathi|us</HI>
makes it intelligible: The land of the <HI>Lae&s;trigons</HI> was fruitful,
and fit for pa&s;turage; it was the practice to &s;end the &s;heep by
day, and the oxen by night; for it was infe&s;ted by a kind of fly that
was very grievous to the oxen by day, whereas the wool of the &s;heep
defended them from it; and therefore the &s;hepherds drove their oxen
to pa&s;ture by night. If the &s;ame &s;hepherd who watched the
&s;heep by day, could pa&s;s the night without &s;leep, and attend the
oxen, he perform'd a double duty, and con&s;equently merited a
double reward. <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ays, that the ways of the night and day
were near to each other, that is, the pa&s;tures of the &s;heep and
oxen, and the ways that led to them were adjacent; for the &s;hep|herd
that drove his flocks home, (or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, as <HI>Homer</HI> expre&s;&s;es
it,) could call to the herd&s;man, who drove his herds to pa&s;ture,
or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and be heard with ea&s;e, and therefore the roads mu&s;t
be adjoining.</P>
<P><HI>Crates</HI> gives us a very different interpretation: He a&s;&s;erts that
<HI>Homer</HI> intended to expre&s;s the &s;ituation of the <HI>Lae&s;trigons,</HI> and
affirms that they lay under the head of the Dragon, (<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,

If this be true, the Poet intended to expre&s;s that there was
&s;carce any night at all among the <HI>Lae&s;trigons,</HI> according to that of
<HI>Manilius,</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="53">

to that country. Neither is there any nece&s;&s;ity to have recour&s;e
to this &s;olution; for what &s;ignifies the length or &s;hortne&s;s of the
day to the double wages of the &s;hepherds, when it was paid to
him who took upon him a double charge of watching the whole
day and night, which comprehends the &s;pace of four and twenty
hours; which alone whether the greater part of it was by night
or day, entitled the &s;hepherd to a double reward? I therefore &s;hould
rather chu&s;e the former interpretation, with which <HI>Didymus</HI> agrees.

continual calamities: For how could <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> be ignorant of the
ea&s;t or we&s;t, when he &s;aw the &s;un ri&s;e and &s;et every day? others
under&s;tand it to &s;ignifie, that he was ignorant of the clime of the
world <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in which this I&s;land lay. <HI>Strabo</HI>
was of opinion, that the appearances of the heavenly bodies, as
the &s;tars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were different in this I&s;land from the po&s;ition
which he had ever before ob&s;erv'd in any country, and therefore
he might well confe&s;s his ignorance, and expre&s;s his concern for
his almo&s;t de&s;perate condition. He under&s;tands by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> all that
region thro' which the Sun pa&s;&s;es oppo&s;ite to the North. It is
true, that the four quarters of the world may be &s;uppos'd to be

thro' which the &s;un pa&s;&s;es, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> the oppo&s;ite quarter, which
may be &s;aid comparatively to be <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or dark: And then the

to expre&s;s the four quarters of the world, otherwi&s;e the &s;e|cond
ver&s;e is a tautology: <HI>Dacier</HI> calls it an explication of the fir&s;t
de&s;cription. And indeed the mind of man is apt to dwell long
upon any object, by which it is deeply affected, as <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> mu&s;t
here be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, and therefore he might enlarge upon the
&s;entiment advanc'd in the former line. The meaning then will
be this. I know not, &s;ays that Heroe, where this I&s;land lies, whe|ther
ea&s;t or we&s;t, where the Sun ri&s;es, or where he &s;ets. I &s;hould
therefore under&s;tand <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to mean, that he knows not how this
I&s;land lies with re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the world, and e&s;pecially to
<HI>Ithaca</HI> his own country. This is evident from his conduct when

with his companions to undertake it: This expedition appear'd
very hazardous, and if he had directly commanded a &s;elect num|ber

expo&s;ed them to almo&s;t certain de&s;truction; but the contrary

<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that <HI>Irae leonum vincla recu&s;antum,</HI> and the
epithets and &s;hort de&s;criptions adapted to the nature of each &s;a|vage,
are beautiful additions. <HI>Virgil</HI> likewi&s;e differs from <HI>Homer</HI>
in the manner of the de&s;cription: <HI>Homer</HI> draws the bea&s;ts with a
gentlene&s;s of nature; <HI>Virgil</HI> paints them with the fiercene&s;s of &s;a|vages.
The rea&s;on of <HI>Homer's</HI> conduct is, becau&s;e they &s;till retain'd
the &s;entiments of men, in the forms of bea&s;ts, and con&s;equently
their native tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a beautiful moral couch'd under this fable or allegory:
<HI>Homer</HI> intended to teach, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> remarks, that plea&s;ure and
&s;en&s;uality deba&s;e men into bea&s;ts. Thus <HI>Socrates</HI> under&s;tood it,
as <HI>Xenophon</HI> informs us. Perhaps, adds <HI>Dacier,</HI> by the fawning
wolves and lions that guard the portals of <HI>Circe</HI>'s Palace, the Poet
means to repre&s;ent the attendants of &s;uch hou&s;es of debauchery,
which appear gentle and courteous, but are in reality of a brutal
di&s;po&s;ition, and more dangerous than lions. But upon what foun|dation
is this fable built? Many writers inform us, that <HI>Circe</HI> was
a famous Courtezan, and that her beauty drew her admirers as it
were by enchantment. Thus <HI>Horace</HI> writes,
<Q><L>&mdash;Circes pocula no&s;ti,</L>
<L>Quae &s;i cum &s;ociis &s;tultus, cupidu&s;que bibi&s;&s;et,</L>
<L>Sub domin&acirc; <HI>Meretrice</HI> fui&s;&s;et turpis &amp; excors,</L>
<L>Vixi&s;&s;et canis immundus, vel amica luto &s;us.</L></Q>
It is evident, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had a very intimate commerce with
<HI>Circe,</HI> for <HI>He&s;iod</HI> writes that he had two &s;ons by her, <HI>Agrius</HI> and
<PB N="60" REF="61">
<HI>Latinus,</HI> who afterwards reign'd in <HI>Tu&s;cany;</HI> other Authors call
them <HI>Nau&s;ithous</HI> and <HI>Telegonus.</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</L></Q>
<HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarn.</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> mention <HI>Telegonus</HI> as the &s;on of
<HI>Circe</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who afterwards &s;lew his father with the bone
of a fi&s;h inadvertently. Thus <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q>Telegoni juga Parricidae.</Q>
But then is not this intrigue a breach of Morality, and conjugal
infidelity in that Heroe? I refer the Reader to Note XIV of
the fifth book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> I &s;hall only add, that the notions
of Morality are now very different from what they were in for|mer
ages: Adultery alone was e&s;teem'd criminal, and puni&s;h'd
with death by the ancient Heathens: Concubinage was not only
permitted, but thought to be honourable, as appears from the
practice, not only of Heroes, but even of the Pagan Deities; and
con&s;equently this was the vice of the age, not in particular of <HI>U|ly&s;&s;es.</HI>
But there is a &s;tronger objection again&s;t <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and it
may be ask'd, how is he to be vindicated for wa&s;ting no le&s;s &s;pace
than a whole year in dalliance with an harlot? <HI>Penelope</HI> and his
country &s;eem both forgotten, and con&s;equently he appears to ne|glect
his own re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, the chief de&s;ign of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI>
What adds &s;ome weight to this ob&s;ervation is, that his companions
&s;eem more &s;en&s;ible of his long ab&s;ence from his country, and re|gret
it more than that Heroe; for they awake him out of his
dream, and intreat him to depart from the I&s;land: It is there|fore
nece&s;&s;ary to take away this objection: for if it be unan&s;we|rable,
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is guilty of all the mi&s;eries of his family and coun|try,
by neglecting to redre&s;s them by returning; and therefore
he mu&s;t cea&s;e to be an Heroe, and is no longer to be propos'd
<PB N="61" REF="62">
as a pattern of Wi&s;dom, and imitation, as he is in the opening
of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> But the &s;tay of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is involuntary, and con|&s;equently
irreproachable; he is in the power of a Deity, and
therefore not capable of departing without her permi&s;&s;ion: this is
evident: for upon the remon&s;trance made by his companions, he
dares not undertake his voyage without her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. His ask|ing
con&s;ent plainly &s;hews that it was not &s;afe, if practicable, to go
away without it; if he had been a free agent, her leave had been
unnece&s;&s;ary: 'tis true, &s;he tells him &s;he will hot detain him any
longer again&s;t his inclinations; but this does not imply that his
&s;tay till then had been voluntary, or that he never had intreated
to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed before, but rather intimates the contrary: it only
&s;hews that now at la&s;t &s;he is willing he &s;hould go away. But
why &s;hould <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;tand in need of being admoni&s;h'd by his com|panions?
does not this imply that he was unmindful of return|ing?
This is only an evidence that they were de&s;irous to return
as well as he; but he makes a wi&s;e u&s;e of their impatience,
and takes an occa&s;ion from their importunities to pre&s;s for an
immediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I am not pleading for perfection in the character of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> Human Nature allows it not, and therefore it is not to
be a&s;cribed to it in Poetry. But if <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> were here guilty, his
character cea&s;es to be of a piece; we no longer intere&s;t our &s;elves
in his misfortunes, &s;ince they are all owing to his own folly; the
nature of the Poem requires, that he &s;hould be continually endeavour|ing,
to re&s;tore his affairs: if then he be here &s;unk into a lethargy, his
character is at once lo&s;t, his calamities are a ju&s;t puni&s;hment, and
the moral of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is de&s;troy'd, which is to &s;hew Wi&s;dom
and Virtue rewarded, and Vice and Folly puni&s;hed by the death of
the &s;uitors, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>

It is an undoubted truth, that <HI>Homer</HI> a&s;cribes more power to the&s;e
magical drugs and incantations than they have in reality; but we
<PB N="62" REF="63">
are to remember that he is &s;peaking before a credulous audience,
who readily believed the&s;e improbabilities, and at the &s;ame time he
very judiciou&s;ly provides for the &s;atisfaction of his more under|&s;tanding
Readers, by couching an excellent moral under his fa|bles;
<HI>viz.</HI> that by indulging our appetites we &s;ink below the
dignity of Human Nature, and degenerate into brutality.</P>
<P>I am not in the number of tho&s;e who believe that there ne|ver
were any Magicians who perform'd things of an uncommon
nature: The &s;tory of <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres,</HI> of the Witch of <HI>En|dor,</HI>
and <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> are undeniable in&s;tances of the contrary.
Magic is &s;uppos'd to have been fir&s;t practis'd in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and to
have &s;pread afterwards among the <HI>Chaldeans:</HI> It is very evident
that <HI>Homer</HI> had been in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where he might hear an account
of the wonders perform'd by it. <HI>Dacier</HI> is of opinion, that the&s;e

and that they are de&s;crib'd with a wand, in imitation of that
great Prophet.</P>
<P>But if any per&s;on thinks that Magic is mere fable, and never
had any exi&s;tence, yet e&s;tabli&s;h'd fame and common opinion ju|&s;tifie
a Poet for u&s;ing it. What has been more ridicul'd than the

pretend to the power of &s;elling a &s;torm or a fair wind at

is not only a remarkable harmony in the flowing of the Poetry,

the image produc'd be clear and lively, if the Poet have skill to
dignifie it by Poetical words, and if it perfectly paints the thing
it is intended to repre&s;ent. This rule fully vindicates <HI>Homer;</HI> tho'
he frequently paints low life, yet he never u&s;es terms which are
not noble; or if he u&s;es humble words or phra&s;es, it is with &s;o

once inhabited <HI>Italy,</HI> and that the famous cave of <HI>Pau&s;ilipe</HI> was
begun by them about the time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> wars: Here they
offer'd &s;acrifice to the <HI>Manes,</HI> which might give occa&s;ion to <HI>Ho|mer's</HI>
fiction. The <HI>Grecians,</HI> who inhabited the&s;e places after the

It is al&s;o probable, that <HI>Acheron</HI> was the ancient name of <HI>Aver|nus,</HI>
becau&s;e <HI>Acheru&s;ia,</HI> a large water near <HI>Cumae,</HI> flows into it by
conceal'd pa&s;&s;ages. <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> informs us, that <HI>Avernus</HI> was

Here <HI>Hannibal</HI> offer'd &s;acrifice to the <HI>Manes,</HI> as it is recorded by
<HI>Livy;</HI> and <HI>Tully</HI> affirms it from an ancient Poet, from whom he
quotes the following fragment;
<Q><L>Inde in vicini&acirc; no&s;tr&acirc; Averni lacus</L>
<L>Unde animae excitantur ob&s;cur&acirc; umbr&acirc;,</L>
<L>Alti Acherontis aperto o&s;tio.</L></Q>
This may &s;eem to ju&s;tifie the ob&s;ervation that <HI>Acheron</HI> was once
the name of <HI>Avernus,</HI> tho' the words are capable of a different
interpretation.</P>
<P>If the&s;e remarks be true, it is probable that <HI>Homer</HI> does not
neglect Geography, as mo&s;t Commentators judge. <HI>Virgil</HI> de&s;cribes
<HI>Aeneas</HI> de&s;cending into Hell by <HI>Avernus,</HI> after the example of
<HI>Homer. Milton</HI> places the&s;e rivers in Hell, and beautifully de|&s;cribes
their natures, in his <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Along the banks</L>
<L>Of four Infernal rivers, that di&s;gorge</L>
<L>Into the burning lake their baleful &s;treams,</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="77">
Abhorred <HI>Styx,</HI> the flood of deadly hate;</L>
<L>Sad <HI>Acheron,</HI> of &s;orrow, black and deep:</L>
<L><HI>Cocytus,</HI> nam'd of lamentation loud</L>
<L>Heard on the ruful &s;tream: fierce <HI>Phlegeton,</HI></L>
<L>Who&s;e waves of torrent fire inflame with rage;</L>
<L>Far off from the&s;e a &s;low and &s;ilent &s;tream,</L>
<L><HI>Lethe</HI> the river of oblivion, rouls</L>
<L>Her watry Labyrinth, whereof who drinks</L>
<L>Forthwith his former &s;tate and being forgets,</L>
<L>Forgets both joy and grief, plea&s;ure and pain.</L></Q>
Thus al&s;o agreeably to the idea of Hell the offerings to the in|fernal
powers are all black, the <HI>Cimmerians</HI> lie in a land of dark|ne&s;s;
the Heifer which <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is to offer is barren, like that in
<HI>Virgil,</HI>
<Q>&mdash;Sterilemque tibi, Pro&s;erpina, Vaccam;</Q>
to denote that the grave is unfruitful, that it devours all things,
that it is a place where all things are forgotten.</P>

<P>_THE Ancients call'd this book <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,

(&s;ays <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>) it contains an interview be|tween
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and the &s;hades of the dead.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has not only borrow'd the general
de&s;ign from <HI>Homer,</HI> but imitated many par|ticular
incidents: <HI>L'Abb&eacute; Fraguier</HI> in the
<HI>Memoirs of Literature</HI> gives his judgment in
favour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Poet, and ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves,
that the end and de&s;ign of the journey is more important
in <HI>Virgil</HI> than in <HI>Homer. Uly&s;&s;es</HI> de&s;cends to con&s;ult <HI>Tire&s;ias, Aeneas</HI>
his father. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> takes a review of the &s;hades of celebrated per|&s;ons
that preceded his times, or whom he knew at <HI>Troy,</HI> who
have no relation to the &s;tory of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey: Aeneas</HI> receives the
<PB N="126" REF="126">
Hi&s;tory of his own po&s;terity; his father in&s;tructs him how to manage
the <HI>Italian</HI> war, and how to conclude it with honour; that is,
to lay the foundations of the greate&s;t Empire in the world: and
the Poet by a very happy addre&s;s takes an opportunity to pay a
noble compliment to his patron <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> In the <HI>Aeneid</HI>
there is a magnificent de&s;cription of the de&s;cent and entrance
into Hell; and the <HI>di&s;ea&s;es, cares,</HI> and <HI>terrors</HI> that <HI>Aeneas</HI>
&s;ees in his journey, are very happily imagin'd, as an introduction
into the regions of Death: whereas in <HI>Homer</HI> there is nothing &s;o
noble, we &s;carce are able to di&s;cover the place where the Poet
lays his &s;cene, or whether <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> continues below or above the

which gave <HI>Orpheus</HI> the invention of his infernal ferriman;
an ill-favoured &s;lovenly fellow, as <HI>Virgil</HI> de&s;cribes him, <HI>Aeneid</HI> 6.

of like fables. When landed on the other &s;ide, the bodies were
brought before certain Judges; if convinc'd of an evil life
they were depriv'd of burial; if otherwi&s;e they &s;uffer'd them
to be interr'd&endq;. This explication &s;hews the foundation of tho&s;e
ancient fables of <HI>Charon, Rhadamanthus, &amp;c.</HI> And al&s;o that the
Poets had a regard to truth in their inventions, and grounded
even their fables upon &s;ome remarkable cu&s;toms, which grew ob|&s;cure
and ab&s;urd only becau&s;e the memory of the cu&s;toms to
which they allude is lo&s;t to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I will only add from <HI>Dacier,</HI> that this book is an evidence
of the antiquity of the opinion of the Soul's Immortality.
It is upon this that the mo&s;t ancient of all divinations was
founded, I mean that which was perform'd by the evocation of
the dead: There is a very remarkable in&s;tance of this in the holy
Scriptures, in an age not very di&s;tant from that of <HI>Homer.
Saul</HI> con&s;ults one of the&s;e infernal agents to call up <HI>Samuel,</HI> who
appears, or &s;ome evil &s;pirit in his form, and predicts his impend|ing
death and calamities. This is a pregnant in&s;tance of the an|tiquity
of Necromancy, and that it was not of <HI>Homer</HI>'s inventi|on;
it prevailed long before his days among the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> and
&s;pread over all the oriental world. <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> has a Tragedy in|titled
<HI>Per&s;ae,</HI> in which the &s;hade of <HI>Darius</HI> is call'd up, like that
of <HI>Samuel,</HI> and foretells Queen <HI>Ato&s;&s;a</HI> all her misfortunes. Thus it
appears that there was a foundation for what <HI>Homer</HI> writes; he only
embelli&s;hes the opinions of Antiquity with the ornaments of Poetry.</P>

It is the opinion of many Commentators, that <HI>Homer</HI> con&s;tantly
in the&s;e voyages of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> makes u&s;e of a fabulous Geography;
but perhaps the contrary opinion in many places may be true:
In this pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in the &s;pace of one day &s;ails from
the I&s;land of <HI>Circe</HI> to the <HI>Cimmerians:</HI> Now it is very evident

near the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> could not &s;ail
thi$her in the compa&s;s of a day; and therefore, &s;ays <HI>Strabo,</HI> the

darkne&s;s, from the northern <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> into <HI>Campania</HI> in <HI>I|taly.</HI></P>
<P>But that there really were a people in <HI>Italy</HI> named <HI>Cimmerians</HI>

We are inform'd by <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> that the Ancients rejected the&s;e &s;ix
ver&s;es; for &s;ay they, the&s;e are not the &s;hades of per&s;ons newly &s;lain,
but who have long been in the&s;e infernal regions: How then can
their wounds be &s;uppos'd &s;till to be vi&s;ible, e&s;pecially thro' their
armour, when the Soul was &s;eparated from the body? Neither is
this the proper place for their appearance, for the Poet immedi|ately
&s;ubjoins, that the gho&s;t of <HI>Elpenor</HI> was the fir&s;t that he encoun|ter'd
in the&s;e regions of darkne&s;s. But the&s;e objections will be ea|&s;ily
an&s;wer'd by having recour&s;e to the notions which the Anci|ents
entertain'd concerning the dead; we mu&s;t remember that
<PB N="131" REF="131">
they imagin'd that the &s;oul tho' freed from the body had &s;till a
vehicle, exactly re&s;embling the body; as the figure in a mold
retains the re&s;emblance of the mold, when &s;eparated from it; the
body is but as a ca&s;e to this vehicle, and it is in this vehicle that
the wounds are &s;aid to be vi&s;ible; this was &s;uppos'd to be le&s;s
gro&s;s than the mortal body, and le&s;s &s;ubtile than the Soul; &s;o that
whatever wounds the outward body receiv'd when living, were
believ'd to affect this inward Sub&s;tance, and con&s;equently might
be vi&s;ible after &s;eparation.</P>
<P>It is true that the Poet calls the gho&s;t of <HI>Elpenor</HI> the fir&s;t gho&s;t,
but this means the fir&s;t whom he knew: <HI>Elpenor</HI> was not yet bu|ried,
and therefore was not yet receiv'd into the habitation of
the dead, but wanders before the entrance of it. This is the rea|&s;on
why his &s;hade is &s;aid to pre&s;ent it &s;elf the foremo&s;t; it comes
not up from the realm of death, but de&s;cends towards it from
the upper world.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;hades of the warriors are &s;aid &s;till to wear their ar|mour
in which they were &s;lain, for the Poet adds that it was
&s;tain'd with blood: How is it po&s;&s;ible for the&s;e gho&s;ts, which
are only a &s;ubtle &s;ub&s;tance, not a gro&s;s body, to wear the armour
they wore in the other world? How was it convey'd to them in
the&s;e infernal regions? All that occurs to me in an&s;wer to this
objection is, that the Poet de&s;cribes them &s;uitably to the chara|cters
they bore in life; the warriors on earth are warriors in
Hell; and that he adds the&s;e circum&s;tances only to denote the
manner of their death, which was in battle, or by the &s;word. No
doubt but <HI>Homer</HI> repre&s;ents a future &s;tate according to the no|tions
which his age entertain'd of it, and this &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifies
him as a Poet, who is not oblig'd to write &s;evere truths, but ac|cording
to fame and common opinions.</P>
<P>But to prove the&s;e ver&s;es genuine, we have the authority of
<HI>Virgil:</HI> he was too &s;en&s;ible of their beauty not to adorn his Poems

&s;eriou&s;ly, not only becau&s;e &s;uch railleries are an in&s;ult upon the
unfortunate, and levities perhaps unworthy of Epic Poetry, but
al&s;o from the general conduct of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who at the &s;ight of <HI>Elpe|nor</HI>
bur&s;ts into tears, and compa&s;&s;ionates the fate of his friend.
Is there any thing in this that looks like raillery? if there be, we
mu&s;t confe&s;s that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> makes a very quick tran&s;ition from &s;or|row

they be &s;hort, and break not the thread of it: this before us is

Poetry: be&s;ides, it contains an excellent moral, and &s;hews us the
ill effects of drunkenne&s;s and debauchery. The Poet repre&s;ents
<HI>Elpenor</HI> as a per&s;on of a mean character, and puni&s;hes his crime

The death of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is related variou&s;ly, but the following ac|count

knowing him to be his father. Thus <HI>Oppian, Hyginus,</HI> and <HI>Dictys</HI>
relate the &s;tory. Many Poets have brought this upon the &s;tage,
and <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> criticizing upon one of the&s;e Tragedies gives us the

at the extremity of it; but this extremity is no more than one
day's voyage from the I&s;land of <HI>Circe,</HI> and con&s;equently that
I&s;land could not lie in the middle of the Ocean: Therefore

and Uncle to <HI>Tyro;</HI> he had &s;eiz'd upon the goods of <HI>Tyro</HI>
the mother of <HI>Neleus,</HI> among which were many beautiful oxen:

<HI>Melampus,</HI> after he was made a pri&s;oner, was tru&s;t|ed
to the care of a man and a woman; the man u&s;ed him
with mercy, and the woman with cruelty: One day he heard a
low noi&s;e, and a family of <HI>worms</HI> in conference. (He under&s;tood
the language of all the animal creation, bea&s;ts and reptiles) The&s;e
worms were di&s;cour&s;ing how they had eaten thro' a great beam
that lay over the head of <HI>Melampus:</HI> He immediately provides for
his own &s;afety, feigns a &s;ickne&s;s, and begs to be carried into
the fre&s;h air; The woman and the man immediately comply with
his reque&s;t; at which in&s;tant the beam falling, kills the woman:
An account of this is forthwith carried to <HI>Iphyclus,</HI> who &s;ending
for <HI>Melampus,</HI> asks who he is? He tells him, a Prophet, and that
he came for the Oxen of <HI>Neleus; Iphyclus</HI> commands him to de|clare
how he may have an heir? <HI>Melampus</HI> kills an Ox, and calls

Mon&s;. <HI>Rapin</HI> agrees with <HI>Longinus:</HI> The &s;tubborn, untractable <HI>Ajax,</HI>

compliments full of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which were paid him by <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI>

<HI>Elara</HI> being pregnant by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> he to avoid the jealou&s;y of <HI>Juno</HI>
conceal'd her in a cavern of the earth, where <HI>Tityus</HI> being born,
is fabled to be the &s;on of the earth: He adds, that the fiction of
his covering nine acres, aro&s;e from that &s;pace of ground which
was enclo&s;ed for his place of burial. Perhaps the &s;tory of <HI>Tan|talus</HI>

Here, (&s;ays <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI>) we &s;ee in the choice and di&s;po&s;ition of
the words the fact which they de&s;cribe; the weight of the
&s;tone, and the &s;triving to heave it up the mountain: To ef|fect
this, <HI>Homer</HI> clogs the ver&s;e with Spondees or long &s;yllables,
and leaves the vowels open, as in <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and in <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
which two words it is impo&s;&s;ible to pronounce without he&s;itati|on
and difficulty; the very words and &s;yllables are heavy, and as
it were make re&s;i&s;tance in the pronunciation, to expre&s;s the hea|vine&s;s
of the &s;tone, and the difficulty with which it is forced up
the mountain. To give the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader a faint image of
the beauty of the original in the tran&s;lation, I have load|ed
the ver&s;e with mono&s;yllables, and the&s;e almo&s;t all begin with

<Q>Up the high hill he heaves a huge round &s;tone.</Q>

Is it not evident, (continues <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI>) that the &s;wiftne&s;s of the

the ver&s;e runs with the greater rapidity? What is the cau&s;e of
<PB N="167" REF="167">
this? It is becau&s;e there is not one mono&s;yllable in the line, and
but two di&s;&s;yllables, ten of the &s;yllables are &s;hort, and not one
&s;pondee in it, except one that could not be avoided at the con|clu&s;ion
of it; there is no hiatus or gap between word and word,
no vowels left open to retard the celerity of it: the whole &s;eems
to be but one word, the &s;yllables melt into one another, and; flow
away with the utmo&s;t rapidity in a torrent of Dactyls. I was
too &s;en&s;ible of the beauty of this not to endeavour to imitate
it, tho' un&s;ucce&s;sfully: I have therefore thrown it into the &s;wift|ne&s;s

of it.
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
The negative <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, by being repeated, &s;eems to be redundant; and
this in a great mea&s;ure occa&s;ions the difficulty; but in the <HI>Greek</HI>
language two negatives more &s;trongly deny; this being premis'd,
we may read the ver&s;e as if the former <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> were ab&s;ent, and
then the meaning will be, &startq;He that made this zone, never made
any thing equal to it:&endq; as if we &s;hould &s;ay that <HI>Phidias</HI> who made
the &s;tatue of <HI>Jupiter</HI> never made any other &s;tatue like it; that
is, he employ'd the whole power of his skill upon it. Others un|der&s;tand
the ver&s;e as an execration: <HI>Oh never, never may the hand
that made it, make any thing again &s;o terrible as this Zone!</HI>
And this will give &s;ome rea&s;on for the repetition of the nega|tive
particles. <HI>Dacier</HI> approves of this latter explication, and mo|ralizes
upon it: It proceeds (&s;ays &s;he) from a tender &s;entiment
of humanity in <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who wi&s;hes that there may never more be
occa&s;ion for &s;uch a de&s;ign, as the arti&s;t executed in this belt of
<HI>Hercules;</HI> that there may be no more giants to conquer, no more
mon&s;ters to tame, or no more human blood be &s;hed. I wi&s;h
that &s;uch a pious and well-natur'd explication were to be drawn
from the pa&s;&s;age! But how is it po&s;&s;ible that the arti&s;t who made
this Zone &s;hould ever make another, when he had been in his
grave &s;ome Centuries? (for &s;uch a di&s;tance there was between the
days of <HI>Hercules</HI> and <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI>) and con&s;equently it would be im|pertinent
to wi&s;h it. I have therefore follow'd the former inter|pretation.
I will only add, that this belt of <HI>Hercules</HI> is the re|ver&s;e
of the girdle of <HI>Venus;</HI> in that, there is a collection of every
thing that is amiable, in this a variety of horrors; but both are

hanging over its eyes down from the forehead, of &s;uch thickne&s;s
that it &s;carce is able to remove it, to guide it &s;elf from danger;
but it kills not by its breath, but with emanations darted from
its eyes: The bea&s;t was well known in the time of <HI>Marius,</HI> for
certain of his &s;oldiers &s;eeing it, mi&s;took it for a wild &s;heep, and
pur&s;ued it to take it; but the hair being remov'd by the motion
of its flying, it &s;lew all upon whom it look'd: at length the
<HI>Nomades,</HI> who knew the nature of the bea&s;t, de&s;troy'd it with darts
at a di&s;tance, and carried it to the General <HI>Marius.</HI> How&s;o|ever

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS

TWELFTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_WE are now drawing to a conclu&s;ion of the
Epi&s;odic narration of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> it may
therefore not be unentertaining to &s;peak
&s;omething concerning the nature of it, be|fore
we di&s;mi&s;s it.</P>
<P>There are two ways of relating pa&s;t &s;ub|jects;
the one, &s;imply and methodically by
a plain rehear&s;al, and this is the province of
Hi&s;tory; the other artificially, where the
Author makes no appearance in per&s;on, but introduces Speakers,
and this is the practice of Epic Poetry. By this method the Poet
brings upon the &s;tage tho&s;e very per&s;ons who perform'd the action
he repre&s;ents: he makes them &s;peak and act over again the words
and actions they &s;poke or perform'd before, and in &s;ome &s;ort
<PB N="204" REF="205">
tran&s;ports his auditors to the time when, and the places where, the
action was done. This method is of great u&s;e; it prevents the
Poet from delivering his &s;tory in a plain &s;imple way like an Hi|&s;torian,
it makes the Auditors witne&s;&s;es of it, and the action
di&s;covers it &s;elf. Thus for in&s;tance, it is not <HI>Homer</HI> but <HI>Uly&s;|&s;es</HI>
who &s;peaks; the Poet is withdrawn, and the Heroe who&s;e
&s;tory we hear is as it were rais'd from the grave, and relates it
in per&s;on to the audience. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Epic Poem
ought to be Dramatic, that is active; <HI>Homer</HI> (&s;ays that Author)
ought to be e&s;pecially commended for being the only Poet who
knew exactly what to do; he &s;peaks little him&s;elf, but introduces
&s;ome of his per&s;ons, a man or a woman, a God or a Godde&s;s;
and this renders his Poem active, or Dramatic. Narration is the
very &s;oul that animates the Poem, it gives an opportunity to the
Poet to adorn it with different Epi&s;odes; it has, as it were, the
whole world for its &s;tage, and gives him liberty to &s;earch thro'
the Creation for incidents or adventures for the employment
of his Heroes: Thus for in&s;tance, he was at liberty to a&s;cribe the
&s;everal dangers of <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis,</HI> of <HI>Polypheme</HI> and <HI>Antipha|tes</HI>
to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> tho' that Heroe had been as unacquainted with tho&s;e
dangers, as <HI>Aeneas</HI> was in reality with <HI>Dido;</HI> the choice of the
Epi&s;odes being not e&s;&s;ential, but arbitrary.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is from this Epi&s;odic narration that the Poet could
at all find room to place the&s;e Epi&s;odes in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey. Ari&s;totle,</HI>
I confe&s;s, has &s;et no preci&s;e limits to the time of the action, but
the Critics in general confine it to one Campaign; at lea&s;t,
they affirm this to be the mo&s;t perfect duration, according to the
model of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> Now this Epi&s;odic narration
gives the Poet an opportunity to relate all that is contain'd in
four books without breaking in upon the time of the action: for
all that we read between the eighth book and the thir|teenth
comprehends only the &s;pace of one evening; namely,
the evening of the thirty third day. The Poet in&s;erts all the
adventures that happen'd to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in almo&s;t ten years from his
departure from <HI>Troy,</HI> into the compa&s;s of one evening by way of
<PB N="205" REF="206">
narration, and &s;o maintains the Unity both of the time and
action.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not of the Narration in general; concerning which the
curious may con&s;ult <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> or <HI>Dryden</HI>'s preface to the tran&s;lation
of the <HI>Aeneis.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 1. <HI>Thus o'er the rolling &s;urge</HI>&mdash;] The words in the
original are <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which <HI>Strabo</HI> judges to mean
no more than a <HI>part</HI> of the ocean, for if it be otherwi&s;e under|&s;tood
it will be a tautology, and who would write that <HI>he
went out of the ocean into the ocean,</HI> as it mu&s;t be rende|red
if <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> be the &s;ame with <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in the next line,
But it is perhaps better to under&s;tand the pa&s;&s;age literally and
plainly, only to denote the place from whence <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> return'd
from his infernal voyage; that is, from the extremity of the O|cean.
It is u&s;ual for the waves of the &s;ea to bear violently
and rapidly upon the &s;ame &s;hores, the waters being pent up by
the nearne&s;s of the land, and therefore forming a current, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
So that the expre&s;&s;ion means no more than <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;urmounted
this current, and then gain'd the wide Ocean.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e evident from the beginning of this book, that
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> pa&s;s'd only one night in Hell; for he arriv'd at the <HI>Cimme|rians</HI>
in one day, &s;aw the vi&s;ions of Hell in the following night,
and in the &s;pace of the next day return'd from the <HI>Cimmerians</HI> in
the evening to <HI>Circe</HI>'s I&s;land, as appears from his going to re|po&s;e
immediately upon his landing.</P>
<P>It may be further prov'd that this was a Nocturnal interview,
from the nature of the magical incantations which were always
perform'd by night: all &s;acrifices were offer'd by night to the
infernal powers, the offering it &s;elf was black, to repre&s;ent the
kingdom of darkne&s;s: Thus al&s;o in other Poets the Moon is &s;aid
to turn pale at the&s;e magical rites, or as <HI>Virgil</HI> expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q>Carmina vel coelo po&s;&s;unt deducere lunam.</Q>
<PB N="206" REF="207">
And indeed, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> ob&s;erves (from whom this note is chiefly
tran&s;lated) it would have been ab&s;urd to have repre&s;ented the
realms of darkne&s;s &s;urvey'd by the light of the day.</P>

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 3. Here the gay Morn re&s;ides in radiant bow'rs,</L>
<L>Here keeps her revels&mdash;]</L></Q>
This pa&s;&s;age is full of ob&s;curity: For how is it po&s;&s;ible
to &s;uppo&s;e this I&s;land of <HI>Circe</HI> to be the re&s;idence of the
Morning; that is, for the day to ri&s;e immediately upon it, when
it is known to lie in a we&s;tern &s;cituation? Some have imagin'd
that this is &s;poken &s;olely with re&s;pect to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who returning
from the &s;hades, might properly &s;ay that he arriv'd at the place
where the day re&s;ides, that is to a place enlighten'd by the &s;un.
Others under&s;tand it comparatively, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Cim|merians,</HI>
or rather to the realms of death, which <HI>Homer</HI> places in
the we&s;t; with regard to the&s;e, <HI>Aeaea</HI> may be &s;aid to lie in
the ea&s;t, or in the poetical language, to be the re&s;idence of the
morning. Be&s;ides the <HI>Circaean</HI> promontory is of an extraordinary
altitude, and con&s;equently the beams at &s;un-ri&s;ing may fall upon
it; nay, it is &s;aid to be illu&s;trated by the Sun even by night. Others
have conjectur'd, that what is here &s;aid implies no more than
that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> landed upon the ea&s;tern parts of the I&s;land: And la&s;tly,
others not improbably refer the whole to the word <HI>Ocean</HI> in the
former line, and then the whole pa&s;&s;age will be clear, and agree
with the fable of the Sun's ri&s;ing and &s;etting in the Ocean. This
is what <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> remarks, who adds, that the Ancients under|&s;tood
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> not to &s;ignify <HI>dances,</HI> but <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the <HI>regions of
the morning.</HI> I have tran&s;lated it in the former &s;en&s;e, according
to the con&s;ent of mo&s;t interpreters: And I am per&s;uaded it is
u&s;ed to denote the plea&s;ure and gaiety which the Sun re&s;tores to
the whole Creation, when di&s;pelling the melancholy darkne&s;s, he
re&s;tores light and gladne&s;s to the earth; which is imag'd to us by
the playing or dancing of the fir&s;t beams of the Sun; or rather
of <HI>Aurora,</HI> who properly may be &s;aid to dance, being a Godde&s;s.
<PB N="207" REF="208">
<HI>Dacier</HI> renders <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, dances; but judges that <HI>Homer</HI> here follows
a fabulous Geography, and that as he tran&s;ported the <HI>Cimmerians</HI>
with all their darkne&s;s from the <HI>Bo&s;phorus</HI> to <HI>Campania;</HI> &s;o like|wi&s;e
he now removes <HI>Aeaea</HI> with all its light from <HI>Cholchis</HI> into
<HI>Italy:</HI> and therefore the Poet gives the properties and &s;cituation
to the I&s;land of <HI>Circe,</HI> which are only true of the ea&s;tern <HI>Chol|chis.</HI></P>
<P>It is very evident, (continues &s;he) that <HI>Homer</HI> was perfectly ac|quainted
with the <HI>Phaenician</HI> &s;tory; he tells us that <HI>Elpenor</HI> was
buried upon the promontory on the &s;ea-&s;hores, and that it was
called by his name, <HI>Elpenor.</HI> Now the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> who endea|vour'd
to naturalize all names in their own language, affirm'd, ac|cording
to <HI>Bochart,</HI> that this promontory was not &s;o call'd from
<HI>Elpenor,</HI> but from their word <HI>Hilbinor,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>ubi albe|&s;cit
lux matutina;</HI> that is, &startq;where the dawning of the day begins
to appear:&endq; This Promontory being of great height, the rays
of the morning might fall upon it; and this tradition might fur|ni&s;h
<HI>Homer</HI> with his fiction of the bow'rs, and dances of it.</P>
<P>What may &s;eem to confirm <HI>Dacier</HI>'s opinion of the tran&s;por|tation
of <HI>Cholchis</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> is the immediate mention the Poet
makes of <HI>Ja&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Aeaetes</HI> King of <HI>Cholchis:</HI> Be&s;ides the An|cients
believ'd <HI>Pha&s;is,</HI> a river of <HI>Cholchis,</HI> to be the bounds of the
habitable oriental world: and <HI>Aeaea</HI> being the capital of it, lying
upon the <HI>Pha&s;is</HI> it might very rationally be mi&s;taken for the place
where the Sun ro&s;e; thus <HI>Mimnermus</HI> writes,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</L></Q>
That is, &startq;the city of <HI>Ae&euml;tes</HI> where the rays of the Sun appear
in a bed of gold, above the margin of the Ocean, where the
divine <HI>Ja&s;on</HI> arriv'd:&endq; This is an evidence that the Poet was
well acquainted with Antiquity, and that (as <HI>Strabo</HI> judges) his
a&s;toni&s;hing fictions have truth for their foundation.</P>

Here, there was a renown'd Academy in the reign of the&s;e <HI>Sirens,</HI>
famous for Eloquence and the liberal Sciences, which gave occa|&s;ion
for the invention of this fable of the &s;weetne&s;s of the
voice, and attracting &s;ongs of the <HI>Sirens.</HI> But why then are they
fabled to be de&s;troyers, and painted in &s;uch dreadful colours?
We are told that at la&s;t the Students abus'd their knowledge, to
the colouring of wrong, the corruption of manners, and &s;ubver&s;ion
of government; that is, in the language of Poetry, they were
feign'd to be transform'd into mon&s;ters, and with their mu&s;ic to
have entic'd pa&s;&s;engers to their ruin, who there con&s;um'd their pa|trimonies,
and poi&s;on'd their virtues with riot and effeminacy.
The place is now call'd <HI>Ma&s;&s;a.</HI> In the days of <HI>Homer</HI> the <HI>Sirens</HI>
were fabled to be two only in number, as appears from his &s;peak|ing
of them in the dual, as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">;
their names (adds <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>) were <HI>Thelxiepaea,</HI> and <HI>Aglaophem&egrave;.</HI>
Other writers, in particular <HI>Lycophron,</HI> mention three <HI>Sirens, Ligaea,
Parthenope,</HI> and <HI>Leuco&s;ia.</HI> Some are of opinion (continues the
&s;ame Author) that they were <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; that is,
&startq;&s;inging women and harlots,&endq; who by the &s;weetne&s;s of their
voices drew the unwary to ruin their health and fortune. O|thers
tell us of a certain Bay contracted within winding &s;treights
and broken cliffs, which by the &s;inging of the winds, and beat|ing
of the waters, returns a delightful harmony; that allures the
<PB N="209" REF="210">
pa&s;&s;enger to approach, who is immediately thrown again&s;t the
rocks, and &s;wallow'd up by the violent eddies.</P>
<P>But others under&s;tand the whole pa&s;&s;age allegorically, or as a
fable containing an excellent moral, to &s;hew that if we &s;uffer
our &s;elves to be too much allur'd by the plea&s;ures of an idle life,
the end will be de&s;truction: thus <HI>Horace</HI> moralizes it;
<Q><L>&mdash;Vitanda e&s;t improba Siren</L>
<L>De&s;idia&mdash;</L></Q>
But the fable may be apply'd to all plea&s;ures in general, which

&startq;When the winds begin to ruffle, e&s;pecially from the &s;outh, it
forthwith runs round with violent eddies, &s;o that many ve&s;&s;els

&s;o celebrated by the Poets, and hyperbolically de&s;crib'd by <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
as unacce&s;&s;able. The fables are indeed well fitted to the
place, there being divers little &s;harp rocks at the foot of the
greater: The&s;e are the dogs that are &s;aid to bark there, the

is very judicious in the Poet not to amu&s;e us with repeating the
compliments that pa&s;s'd between the&s;e two lovers at parting:
The commerce <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> held with <HI>Circe</HI> was &s;o far from contribu|ting

words, and pa&s;&s;es on directly to the great &s;ufferings and adven|tures
of his Heroe, which are e&s;&s;ential to the Poem. But it may
not be unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve how artfully the Poet connects this
Epi&s;ode of <HI>Circe</HI> with the thread of it; he makes even the God|de&s;s
who detains him from his country, contribute to his return
thither, by the advice &s;he gives him how to e&s;cape the dan|gers
of the Ocean, and how to behave in the difficult emergen|cies
of his voyages: 'Tis true, &s;he detains him out of fondne&s;s,

This account is very extraordinary. <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> continued upon the
Ma&s;t ten days, and con&s;equently ten days without any nouri&s;hment.
<HI>Longinus</HI> brings this pa&s;&s;age as an in&s;tance of the decay of <HI>Homer</HI>'s
Genius, and his launching out into extravagant Fables. I wonder
<HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> &s;hould be &s;ilent about this Objection; but <HI>Dacier</HI> en|deavours
to vindicate <HI>Homer,</HI> from a &s;imilar place in the <HI>Acts of
the Apo&s;tles, Cap.</HI> 27. ver. 33. where Saint <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays to the Sailors,
<HI>this is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued fa&s;ting,
having taken nothing.</HI> Now it the Sailors in the <HI>Acts</HI> could fa&s;t
fourteen days, why might not <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> fa&s;t ten? But this place
by no means comes up to the point. The words are <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
that is, expecting the
fourteenth day, (which is to-day) you continue without eating;
&s;o the meaning is, they had taken no food all that day; the
danger was &s;o great that they had no lei&s;ure to think upon hun|ger:
This is the literal con&s;truction of the Words, and implies
<PB N="232" REF="233">
that out of expectation of the fourteenth Day, (which they
look'd upon as a critical time when their danger would be at
the highe&s;t) they had forgot to take their u&s;ual repa&s;t; and
not, that they had fa&s;ted fourteen Days. But if any Per&s;on
thinks that the fa&s;ting is to be apply'd to the whole fourteen
Days, it mu&s;t be in that latitude wherein Interpreters expound
<HI>He&s;iod,</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">&mdash;</L></Q>
which &s;ignifies not that they eat no Meat at all, but that they
had not lei&s;ure thro' their danger to ob&s;erve the u&s;ual and &s;ta|ted
hours of repa&s;t: They eat in their Arms, with their Hands
foul'd with Blood. But I take the former &s;en&s;e to be the better.
Be&s;ides, it is impo&s;&s;ible to make this place of any &s;ervice to <HI>Ho|mer;</HI>
for if the&s;e Men continued &s;o long fa&s;ting, it was a mira|culous
fa&s;t; and how can this be apply'd to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who is not
imagin'd to owe his power of fa&s;ting to any &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance?
But it is almo&s;t a demon&s;tration that the &s;ailors in the
<HI>Acts</HI> eat during the tempe&s;t: Why &s;hould they ab&s;tain? It was
not for want of food; for at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s injunction they take &s;ome
&s;u&s;tenance: Now it is ab&s;urd to imagine a miracle to be per|form'd,
when common and ea&s;y means were at hand to make
&s;uch a &s;upernatural act unnece&s;&s;ary. If they had been without
food, then indeed a miracle might have been &s;uppos'd to &s;upply
it. If they had dy'd thro' fa&s;ting, when meat was at hand, they
would have been guilty of &s;tarving them&s;elves. If therefore
we &s;uppo&s;e a miracle, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it to be wrought, to pre|vent
men from being guilty of wilful &s;elf-murder, which is an
ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is u&s;ed to denote a per&s;on who takes
no food for the &s;pace of one day only, as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ignifies a
per&s;on who eats but one meal in the compa&s;s of one day; this
therefore is an evidence, that the &s;ailors in the <HI>Acts</HI> had not been
without &s;u&s;tenance fourteen days.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="234">
In &s;hort, I am not in the number of tho&s;e who think <HI>Homer</HI>
has no faults; and unle&s;s we imagine <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to have fa&s;ted ten
days by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Gods, this pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t be allow'd

Thus he omits the de&s;cription of the &s;acrifice, and the &s;ub|ject

impatience of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es:</HI> It is familiar, but expre&s;&s;ive. <HI>Horace</HI> was

It was very nece&s;&s;ary to dwell upon this impatience of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to

or even moderately warm upon this occa&s;ion; he had refu&s;ed

character to be drawn with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s of &s;oul, and
every moment mu&s;t appear tedious that keeps him from it; it
&s;hews therefore the judgment of <HI>Homer</HI> to de&s;cribe him in this
manner, and not to pa&s;s it over cur&s;orily, but force it upon the
notice of the Reader, by in&s;i&s;ting upon it &s;omewhat largely, and

<P><Q><L><HI>VERSE</HI> 98. As fiery cour&s;ers in the rapid race</L>
<L>To&s;s their high heads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q>
The Poet introduces two &s;imilitudes to repre&s;ent the &s;ailing of
the <HI>Phaeacian</HI> ve&s;&s;el: The former de&s;cribes the motion of it, as it
bounds and ri&s;es over the waves, like hor&s;es to&s;&s;ing their heads in
a race; and al&s;o the &s;teddine&s;s of it, in that it &s;ails with as much
firmne&s;s over the billows, as hor&s;es tread upon the ground.
The latter compari&s;on is &s;olely to &s;hew the &s;wiftne&s;s of the
ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The word in the original is <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; an in&s;tance, that four
hor&s;es were &s;ometimes joyn'd to the chariot. <HI>Virgil</HI> has borrow'd
this compari&s;on, <HI>Aen.</HI> 5.
<Q><L>Non tam praecipites bijugo certamine campum</L>
<L>Corripuere, ruuntque effu&s;i carcere currus,</L>
<L>Nec &s;ic immi&s;&s;is aurigae undantia lora</L>
<L>Concu&s;&s;ere jugis, pronique in verbera pendent.</L></Q>
It mu&s;t be allow'd that nothing was ever more happily executed
than this de&s;cription, and the copy far exceeds the original. <HI>Ma|crobius,
Saturnal. lib.</HI> 5. gives this as his opinion, and his rea&s;ons
for it. The <HI>Greek</HI> Poet (&s;ays that Author) paints only the &s;wift|ne&s;s
of the hor&s;es when &s;courg'd by the driver; <HI>Virgil</HI> adds, the
ru&s;hing of the chariot, the fields as it were devour'd by the ra|pidity
of the hor&s;es; we &s;ee the throwing up of the reins, in <HI>un|dantia
lora;</HI> and the attitude of the driver, leaning forward in
the act of la&s;hing the hor&s;es, in the words, <HI>Pronique in verbera
pendent.</HI> 'Tis true, nothing could be added more elegantly than
the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; in <HI>Homer,</HI> it paints at once the &s;wiftne&s;s of
the race, and the ri&s;ing po&s;ture of the hor&s;es in the act of run|ning;
but <HI>Virgil</HI> is more copious, and has omitted no circum|&s;tance,
and &s;et the whole race fully before our eyes; we may add,
that the ver&s;ification is as beautiful as the de&s;cription compleat;
every ear mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="269">
I will only further ob&s;erve the judgment of <HI>Homer,</HI> in &s;peak|ing
of every per&s;on in his particular character. When a vain|glorious
<HI>Phaeacian</HI> de&s;crib'd the &s;ailing of his own ve&s;&s;els, they
were &s;wift as thought, and endued with rea&s;on; when <HI>Homer</HI>
&s;peaks in his own per&s;on to his readers, they are &s;aid only to be
as &s;wift as hawks or hor&s;es: <HI>Homer</HI> &s;peaks like a Poet, with &s;ome
degree of amplification, but not with &s;o much hyperbole as <HI>Alci|nous.</HI>
No people &s;peak &s;o fondly as &s;ailors of their own &s;hips to

<P>The whole voyage of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> to his country, and indeed the

at eternal felicity. <HI>Spondanus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 124.&mdash;<HI>A gloomy Grotto's cool rece&s;s.</HI>] <HI>Porphyry</HI>
has wrote a volume to explain this cave of the Nymphs, with
more piety perhaps than judgment; and another per&s;on has per|verted
it into the utmo&s;t ob&s;cenity, and both allegorically. <HI>Por|phyry</HI>
(ob&s;erves <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>) is of opinion, that the cave means the
world; it is called gloomy, but agreeable, becau&s;e it was made
out of darkne&s;s, and afterwards &s;et in this agreeable order by the
hand of the Deity. It is con&s;ecrated to the Nymphs; that is,
it is de&s;tin'd to the habitation of &s;piritual &s;ub&s;tances united to the
body: The bowls and urns of living &s;tone, are the body which
are form'd out of the earth; the bees that make their hony in
the cave are the &s;ouls of men, which perform all their operati|ons
in the body, and animate it; the beams on which the
Nymphs roul their webs, are the bones over which the admira|ble
embroidery of nerves, veins and arteries are &s;pread; the foun|tains
which water the cave are the &s;eas, rivers and lakes that wa|ter
the world; and the two gates, are the two poles; thro' the nor|thern
the &s;ouls de&s;cend from Heaven to animate the body, thro'
the &s;outhern they a&s;cend to Heaven, after they are &s;eparated from
the body by death. But I confe&s;s I &s;hould rather chu&s;e to un|der&s;tand
the de&s;cription poetically, believing that <HI>Homer</HI> never
dream'd of the&s;e matters, tho' the age in which he flouri&s;h'd
was addicted to Allegory. How often do Painters draw from the
imagination only, merely to plea&s;e the eye? And why might not
<HI>Homer</HI> write after it, e&s;pecially in this place where he mani|fe&s;tly
indulges his fancy, while he brings his Heroe to the
<PB N="273" REF="271">
fir&s;t dawning of happine&s;s? He has long dwelt upon a &s;eries of
horrors, and his imagination being tired with the melancholy
&s;tory, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but his &s;pirit might be enliven'd with
the &s;ubject while he wrote, and this might lead him to indulge
his fancy in a wonderful, and perhaps fabulous de&s;cription. In
&s;hort, I &s;hould much rather chute to believe that the memory of
the things to which he alludes in the de&s;cription of the cave is lo&s;t,
than credit &s;uch a labour'd and di&s;tant Allegory.</P>

al&s;o <HI>Themis</HI> was &s;aid to form or di&s;&s;olve a&s;&s;emblies, becau&s;e they
carried her image to the a&s;&s;emblies when they were conven'd,
and when they were broken up they carried it away. Now we have
already remark'd, that this port was &s;acred to <HI>Phovcys,</HI> becau&s;e he
had a Temple by it: It may not then be impo&s;&s;ible, but that
this Temple having two doors, they might carry the &s;tatues of
the Gods in their proce&s;&s;ions thro' the &s;outhern gate, which
might be con&s;ecrated to this u&s;e only, and the populace be for|bid
to enter by it: For that rea&s;on the Deities were &s;aid to enter:

There is nothing in the whole <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> that more &s;hocks our rea|&s;on

&startq;The pa&s;&s;age (&s;ays <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Poetics</HI>) where <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> is
landed in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> is &s;o full of ab&s;urdities, that they would be
intolerable in a bad Poet; but <HI>Homer</HI> has conceal'd them un|der
an infinity of admirable beauties, with which he has a|dorn'd
<PB N="275" REF="273">
all that part of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey;</HI> the&s;e he has crowded toge|ther,
as &s;o many charms to hinder our perceiving the defects
of the &s;tory:&endq; <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;peak with great
judgment; for what probability is there that a man &s;o prudent
as <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who was alone in a ve&s;&s;el at the di&s;cretion of &s;trangers,
&s;hould &s;leep &s;o &s;oundly, as to be taken out of it, carried with all
his baggage on &s;hore, and the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> &s;hould &s;et &s;ail, and he ne|ver
awake? This is &s;till more ab&s;urd, if we remember that <HI>Uly&s;|&s;es</HI>
has his &s;oul &s;o &s;trongly bent upon his country; Is it then po&s;&s;ible,
that he could be thus &s;unk into a lethargy, in the moment when
he arrives at it? &startq;However (&s;ays Mon&s;. <HI>Dacier</HI> in his reflections
upon <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s <HI>Poetics</HI>) <HI>Homer</HI> was not a&s;hamed of that Ab|&s;urdity,
but not being able to omit it, he u&s;ed it to give Pro|bability
to the &s;ucceeding &s;tory: It was nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
to land alone, in order to his concealment; if he had been
di&s;cover'd, the &s;uitors would immediately have de&s;troy'd him,
if not as the real <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> yet under the pretext of his being
an impo&s;tor; they would then have &s;eiz'd his dominions, and
married <HI>Penelope:</HI> Now if he had been waked, the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>
would have been oblig'd to have attended him, which he could
not have deny'd with decency, nor accepted with &s;afety: <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
therefore had no other way left to unravel his fable hap|pily:
But he knew what was ab&s;urd in this method, and u&s;es
means to hide it; he lavi&s;hes out all his wit and addre&s;s, and
lays together &s;uch an abundance of admirable Poetry, that the
mind of the Reader is &s;o inchanted, that he perceives not the
defect; he is like <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> lull'd a&s;leep, and knows no more than
that Heroe, how he comes there. That great Poet fir&s;t
de&s;cribes the ceremony of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> taking leave of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> and
his Queen <HI>Arete;</HI> then he &s;ets off the &s;wiftne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;el by
two beautiful companions; he de&s;cribes the Haven with great
exactne&s;s, and adds to it the de&s;cription of the cave of the
Nymphs; this la&s;t a&s;toni&s;hes the Reader, and he is &s;o intent
upon it, that he has not attention to con&s;ider the ab&s;urdity in
the manner of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>'s landing: In this moment when
<PB N="276" REF="274">
he perceives the mind of the Reader as it were intoxicated
with the&s;e beauties, he &s;teals <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> on &s;hore, and di&s;mi&s;&s;es the
<HI>Phaeacians;</HI> all this takes up but eight ver&s;es. And then le&s;t
the Reader &s;hould reflect upon it, he immediately introduces
the Deities, and gives us a dialogue between <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Neptune.</HI>
This keeps up &s;till our wonder, and our rea&s;on has not time
to deliberate; and when the dialogue is ended, a &s;econd won|der
&s;ucceeds, the bark is transform'd into a rock: This is
done in the &s;ight of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> by which method the Poet
carries us a-while from the con&s;ideration of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> by remov|ing
the &s;cene to a di&s;tant I&s;land; there he detains us 'till we
may be &s;uppos'd to have forgot the pa&s;t ab&s;urdities, by relat|ing
the a&s;toni&s;hment of <HI>Alcinous</HI> at the &s;ight of the prodigy,
and his offering up to <HI>Neptune,</HI> to appea&s;e his anger, a &s;acri|fice
of twelve bulls. Then he returns to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> who now
wakes, and not knowing the place where he was, (becau&s;e
<HI>Minerva</HI> made all things appear in a di&s;guis'd view) he com|plains
of his misfortunes, and accu&s;es the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> of infide|lity;
at length <HI>Minerva</HI> comes to him in the &s;hape of a young
&s;hepherd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus this ab&s;urdity, which appears in the fable
when examin'd alone, is hidden by the beauties that &s;urround it:
this pa&s;&s;age is more adorn'd with fiction, and more wrought up
with a variety of poetical ornaments than mo&s;t other places of the
<HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> From hence <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> makes an excellent ob&s;ervation. All ef|forts
imaginable (&s;ays that Author) ought to be made to form
the fable rightly from die beginning; but if it &s;o happen that
&s;ome places mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily appear ab&s;urd, they mu&s;t be ad|mitted,
e&s;pecially if they contribute to render the re&s;t more
probable: but the Poet ought to re&s;erve all the ornaments of
diction for the&s;e weak parts: The places that have either &s;hi|ning
&s;entiments or manners have no occa&s;ion for them; a da|zling
expre&s;&s;ion rather damages them, and &s;erves only to e|clip&s;e
their beauty.</P>

<P>VERSE 142.&mdash;<HI>Then launch'd the bark again.</HI>] This vo|luntary
and unexpected return of the <HI>Phaeacians,</HI> and their landing
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> in his &s;leep, &s;eems as unaccountable on the part of the
<HI>Phaeacians,</HI> as of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> for what can be more ab&s;urd than to
&s;ee them expo&s;ing a King and his effects upon the &s;hores with|out
his knowledge, and then flying away &s;ecretly as from an ene|my?
Having therefore in the preceding note &s;hew'd what the
Critics &s;ay in condemnation of <HI>Homer,</HI> it is but ju&s;tice to lay to|gether
what they &s;ay in his defence.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> &s;hould fly away in &s;ecret is no wonder:
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> had thro' the whole cour&s;e of the eleventh book, (particu|larly
by the mouth of the Prophet <HI>Tire&s;ias</HI>) told the <HI>Phaeacians</HI>
that the &s;uitors plotted his de&s;truction; and therefore the mariners
might very rea&s;onably be apprehen&s;ive that the &s;uitors would u&s;e
any per&s;ons as enemies, who &s;hould contribute to re&s;tore <HI>Uly&s;|&s;es</HI>
to his country. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould &s;ail
away without any &s;tay upon the <HI>Ithacan</HI> &s;hores. This is the
rea&s;on why they made this voyage by night; namely, to avoid
di&s;covery; and it was as nece&s;&s;ary to return immediately, that
is, ju&s;t at the appearance of day, before people were abroad,
that they might e&s;cape ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> remarks, that the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> were an unwarlike na|tion,
or as it is expre&s;&s;ed by a <HI>Phaeacian,</HI>
<Q><L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</L></Q>
and therefore they were afraid to teach any per&s;ons the way to
their own country, by di&s;covering the cour&s;e of Navigation to it;
for this rea&s;on they begin their voyage to <HI>Ithaca</HI> by night, land
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> without waking him, and return at the appearance of day|light,
that they might not &s;hew what cour&s;e was to be &s;teer'd to
come to the <HI>Phaeacian</HI> &s;hores.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="276">
<HI>Plutarch</HI> in his treati&s;e of reading the Poets, tells us, that there
is a tradition among the <HI>Tu&s;cans,</HI> that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was naturally <HI>drow|zy,</HI>
and a per&s;on that could not ea&s;ily be convers'd with, by
rea&s;on of that <HI>&s;leepy</HI> di&s;po&s;ition. But perhaps this might be only
artful in a man or &s;o great wi&s;dom, and &s;o great di&s;gui&s;e or di&s;|&s;imulation;
he was &s;low to give an&s;wers, when he had no mind
to give any at all: Tho' indeed it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that this tra|dition
is countenanc'd by his behaviour in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> or rather
may be only a &s;tory form'd from it. His greate&s;t calamities ri&s;e from
his <HI>&s;leeping:</HI> when he was ready to land upon his own country, by
the favour of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> he falls <HI>a&s;leep,</HI> and his companions let loo&s;e
a wind that bears him from it: He is <HI>a&s;leep</HI> while they kill the
oxen of <HI>Apollo;</HI> and here he <HI>&s;leeps</HI> while he is landed upon his
own country. It might perhaps be this conduct in <HI>Homer,</HI> that
gave <HI>Horace</HI> the hint to &s;ay,
<Q>&mdash;<L><HI>Aliquando bonus</HI> dormitat <HI>Homerus.</HI></L></Q>
implying, that when <HI>Homer</HI> was at a lo&s;s to bring any diffi|cult
matter to an i&s;&s;ue, he immediately laid his Heroe <HI>a&s;leep,</HI>
and this &s;alv'd all the difficulty; as in the above-mention'd in|&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> is of opinion that this <HI>&s;leep</HI> of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was feign'd; and
that he made u&s;e of the pretence of a <HI>natural infirmity,</HI> to con|ceal
the &s;treights he was in at that time in his thoughts; being
a&s;ham'd to di&s;mi&s;s the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> without entertainment and gifts
of ho&s;pitality, and affraid of being di&s;cover'd by the fuitors, if
he entertain'd &s;uch a multitude: Therefore to avoid both the&s;e
difficulties, he feigns a Sleep while they land him, 'till they
&s;ail away.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> agrees with <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the main, and adds another
rea&s;on why the <HI>Phaeacians</HI> land <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> &s;leeping; namely, becau&s;e
they were a&s;ham'd to wake him, left he &s;hould think they did it
out of avarice, and expectation of a reward for bringing him to
his own country.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="277">
I will only add, that there might be a natural rea&s;on for the
Sleep of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es;</HI> we are to remember that this is a voyage in the
night, the &s;ea&s;on of repo&s;e: and his &s;pirits having been long a|gitated
and fatigued by his calamities, might, upon his peace of
mind at the return to his Country, &s;ettle into a deep calmne&s;s and
tranquility, and &s;o &s;ink him into a deep Sleep; <HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf
&s;eems to give this as the rea&s;on of it in the following lines:
<Q><L>Much danger long and mighty toils he bore.</L>
<L>In &s;torms by &s;ea, and combats on the &s;hore;</L>
<L>All which &s;oft &s;leep now bani&s;h'd from his brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Wrapt in a plea&s;ing, deep, and death-like re&s;t.</L></Q>
It mu&s;t be allowed that the la&s;t line admirably paves the way for
the following account; and the Poet undoubtedly in&s;erted it, to
prevent our &s;urprize at the manner of his being &s;et on &s;hore, by
calling his Sleep
<Q><L>&mdash;a plea&s;ing, deep, and death-like re&s;t.</L></Q>
How far a wi&s;e man is oblig'd' to re&s;i&s;t the calls of nature, I
leave to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of Philo&s;ophers; tho&s;e of &s;leep are no more
to be re&s;i&s;ted, than tho&s;e of thir&s;t or hunger. But yet I confe&s;s
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> yielded un&s;ea&s;onably, and the &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion and love for his
Country that &s;o fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd his &s;oul, &s;hould have given him

I refer the Reader to the eighth book of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> for a further
account of this transformation. <HI>Scaliger</HI> condemns it, <HI>Uly&s;&s;is navis
<PB N="280" REF="278">

monument of the vengeance and power of <HI>Neptune,</HI> and that when|ever
the &s;tory of the Ve&s;&s;el was mention'd, the puni&s;hment like|wi&s;e
mu&s;t be remembred in honour of that Deity? Some are of
opinion, that it is a phy&s;ical Allegory, and that <HI>Homer</HI> delivers
the opinion of the Ancients concerning the Transmutation of one
&s;pecies into another, as wood into &s;tone, by Water, that is by <HI>Nep|tune</HI>
the God of it; according to tho&s;e lines of <HI>Ovid:</HI>
<Q><L>Flumen habent Cicones, quod potum &s;axea reddit</L>
<L>Vi&s;cera, quod tactis inducit marmora rebus.</L></Q>
But perhaps this is only one of tho&s;e marvellous fictions written
after the ta&s;te of antiquity, which delighted in wonders, and
which the nature of Epic Poetry allows. &startq;The Marvellous
(&s;ays <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Poetics</HI>) ought to take place in Tragedy,
but much more in the Epic, in which it proceeds even to the ex|travagant;
for the Marvellous is always agreeable, and a Proof
of it is, that tho&s;e who relate any thing, generally add &s;ome|thing
to the Truth of it, that it, may better plea&s;e tho&s;e who
hear it. <HI>Homer</HI> (continues he) is the man who has given the
be&s;t In&s;tructions to other Poets how to tell Lies agreeably.&endq;
<HI>Horace</HI> is of the &s;ame opinion.
<Q><L>Atque ita mentitur, &s;ic veris fal&s;a remi&s;cet,</L>
<L>Primo ne medium, medio ne di&s;crepet imum.</L></Q>
However we mu&s;t not think that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> advi&s;es Poets to put
things evidently fal&s;e and impo&s;&s;ible into their Poems, or gives
them licence to run out into wildne&s;s; he only means (as Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Dacier</HI> ob&s;erves) that the Wonderful &s;hould exceed the Pro|bable,
but not de&s;troy it; and this will, be effected if the Poet
has the Addre&s;s to prepare the Reader, and to lead him by a
probable train of things that depend on miracle, to the miracle
<PB N="281" REF="279">
it &s;elf, and reconcile him to it by degrees, &s;o that his Rea&s;on does
not perceive, at lea&s;t is not &s;hock'd at the Illu&s;ion; thus for in|&s;tance,
<HI>Homer</HI> puts this Transformation into the hands of a Deity;
he prepares us for it in the eighth book, he gives us the rea&s;on
of the transformation; namely the anger of <HI>Neptune;</HI> and at
la&s;t he brings in <HI>Jupiter</HI> a&s;&s;enting to it. This is the method
<HI>Homer</HI> takes to reconcile it to Probabilty. <HI>Virgil</HI> undoubtedly
thought it a beauty, for after <HI>Homer</HI>'s example, he gives us a
transformation of the &s;hips of <HI>Aeneas</HI> into Sea-nymphs.</P>
<P>I have already remark'd from <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> that &s;uch miracles as the&s;e
ought not to be too frequent in an Epic Poem; all the ma|chines
that require Divine probability ought to be &s;o detach'd
from the action of the Poem, that they may be retrench'd from
it, without de&s;troying the action: Tho&s;e that are e&s;&s;ential to the
action ought to be founded upon human probability. Thus if
we take away this transformation, there is no cha&s;m; and it no
way affects the integrity of the action,</P>

The meaning of this whole pa&s;&s;age is probably no more than
that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> by his long ab&s;ence had forgot the face of his own
country; the woods by almo&s;t twenty years growth had a different
appearance; and the public roads were alter'd by &s;o great a

of the place? He goes to a &s;hepherd, and by telling him
a plau&s;ible &s;tory draws it from him. This artifice is the <HI>Mi|nerva</HI>
that gives him information. By the <HI>veil of thicken'd air</HI>
is meant, that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> to accompli&s;h his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, took up|on
him a di&s;gui&s;e, and conceal'd him&s;elf from the <HI>Ithacans;</HI> and
this too being the dictate of Wi&s;dom, <HI>Homer</HI> a&s;cribes it to <HI>Pal|las.</HI></P>
<P>The words of the original are,
<Q><L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">&mdash;</L></Q>
which are u&s;ually apply'd by interpreters to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and mean that
the Godde&s;s di&s;guis'd him with this veil, that no one might know
him. <HI>Dacier</HI> is of opinion that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ought to be u&s;ed active|ly;
that is, the Godde&s;s acted thus to make him <HI>unknowing</HI> where
<PB N="283" REF="281">
he was, not <HI>unknown</HI> to the people; for that this was the effect
of the veil appears from the removal of it; for immediately

<Q><L>The King with joy confe&s;s'd his place of birth.</L></Q>
That the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> will bear an active &s;ignification, &s;he

the context will not permit this interpretation, tho' we

runs thus: <HI>Pallas</HI> ca&s;t round a veil of air, that &s;he might
make him unknown, that &s;he might in&s;truct him, and that his
wife and friends might not know him; for thus <HI>Homer</HI> interprets
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in the very next line, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. It is there|fore
probable, that this veil had a double effect, both to render
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> unknown to the country, and the country to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> I

Here it can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ignify nothing, but <HI>I will render thee un|known

We may con&s;ider an Epic Poem as a &s;pacious garden, where
there are to be different walks and views, left the eye &s;hould be
tir'd with too great a regularity and uniformity: The chief avenue
ought to be the mo&s;t ample and noble, but there &s;hould be by|walks
to retire into &s;ometimes for our ea&s;e and refre&s;hment. The
Poet thus gives us &s;everal openings to draw us forward with plea|&s;ure;
and tho' the great event of the Poem be chiefly in view,
yet he &s;ometimes leads us a&s;ide into other &s;hort pa&s;&s;ages which
<PB N="293" REF="291">
end in it again, and bring us with plea&s;ure to the conclu&s;ion of
it. Thus for in&s;tance, <HI>Homer</HI> begins with the &s;tory of <HI>Telemachus</HI>
and the Suitors; then he leaves them a-while, and more largely
lays before us the adventures of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> the Heroe of his Poem;
when he has &s;atisfy'd the curio&s;ity of the Reader by a full nar|ration
of what belongs to him, he returns to <HI>Telemachus</HI> and the
&s;uitors: at length he unites the two &s;tories, and proceeds directly
to the end of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> Thus all the collateral and indirect
pa&s;&s;ages fall into one center, and main point of view. The eye
is continually entertain'd with &s;ome new object, and we pa&s;s on
from incident to incident, not only without fatigue, but with
plea&s;ure and admiration.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>_WE &s;ee in this book the character of a faith|ful,
wi&s;e, benevolent old man in <HI>Eumaeus;</HI>
one happily innocent, unambitious, and whol|ly
employed in rural affairs. The whole inter|view
between <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus</HI> has fallen
into ridicule; <HI>Eumaeus</HI> has been judg'd to be
of the &s;ame rank and condition with our mo|dern
&s;wineherds. But herds and flocks were
then kept and attended by the &s;ons of Kings;
thus <HI>Paris</HI> watched the flocks of <HI>Priam</HI> in the groves of <HI>Ida,</HI> and
the &s;ame is &s;aid of many of the Heroes in the <HI>Iliad;</HI> the&s;e offices
were places of dignity, and fill'd by per&s;ons of birth; and &s;uch
was <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> de&s;cended from a Prince, named <HI>Cte&s;ius:</HI> Thus the
Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> is a po&s;t of Honour in modern ages.</P>
<P>It is in Poetry, as in Painting; where the arti&s;t does not con|fine
him&s;elf to draw only Gods or Heroes, Palaces and Princes;
but he frequently employs his pencil in repre&s;enting Land&s;chapes,
rural &s;cenes, groves, cottages, and &s;hepherds tending their flocks.</P>
<P>There is a pa&s;&s;age in Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boileau</HI>'s reflections upon <HI>Lon|ginus,</HI>
which fully vindicates all the places of <HI>Homer</HI> that have
been cen&s;ur'd as low and too familiar. &startq;There is nothing, (ob|&s;erves
that Author) that more di&s;graces a compo&s;ition than the
<PB N="336" REF="328">
u&s;e of <HI>vulgar words:</HI> A mean thought expre&s;&s;ed in noble terms,
is generally more taking than a noble thought deba&s;ed by
mean terms: The rea&s;on is, every per&s;on cannot judge of the
ju&s;tne&s;s and &s;trength of a thought, but there are very few, e&s;|pecially
in living languages, who are not &s;hock'd at mean
words: and yet almo&s;t all writers fall, into this fault. <HI>Longinus</HI>
accu&s;es <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the mo&s;t polite of all the <HI>Greek</HI> Hi&s;torians, of
this defect; and <HI>Livy, Sallu&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> have fall'n under the
&s;ame imputation. Is it not then very &s;urprizing that no reproach
upon this account has fall'n upon <HI>Homer?</HI> e&s;pecially, tho' he has
compos'd two large Poems, and tho' no Author has de&s;cended
more frequently into the detail of little particularities; yet he ne|ver
u&s;es terms which are not noble, or if he u&s;es humble words
or phra&s;es it is with &s;o much art, that as <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;us</HI>
ob&s;erves, they become noble and harmonious. We may learn
from hence the ignorance of tho&s;e modern Criticks, who judge
of the <HI>Greek</HI> without the knowledge of it; and having never read
<HI>Homer</HI> but in low and inelegant tran&s;lations, impute the Meane&s;|&s;es
of the Tran&s;lator to the Poet. Be&s;ides, the words of different
languages are not exactly corre&s;pondent, and it often happens that
an expre&s;&s;ion which is noble in the <HI>Greek</HI> cannot be render'd in
a ver&s;ion but by words that are either mean in the &s;ound or
u&s;age. Thus <HI>a&s;s,</HI> and <HI>a&s;inus</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> are mean to the la&s;t degree;
tho' <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in the <HI>Greek</HI> be u&s;ed in the mo&s;t magnificent de&s;cri|ptions,
and has nothing mean in it; in like manner the terms
<HI>Hogherd</HI> and <HI>Cowkeeper,</HI> are not to be u&s;ed in our Poetry;
but there are no finer words in the <HI>Greek</HI> language than <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: And <HI>Virgil,</HI> who entitles his <HI>Eclogues Bucolics</HI> in the
<HI>Roman</HI> tongue, would have been a&s;hamed to have call'd them
in our language <HI>the Dialogues of Cowkeepers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> him&s;elf convinces us of the truth of this Ob&s;ervation;
nay, one would imagine that he intended indu&s;triou&s;ly to force
it upon our notice: for he frequently calls <HI>Eumaeus</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
or <HI>Prince of men;</HI> and his common epithet is <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
<HI>Homer</HI> would not have apply'd the&s;e appellations to him,
if he had not been a per&s;on of dignity; it being the &s;ame title
that he be&s;tows upon his greate&s;t Heroes, <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> or <HI>Achilles.</HI></P>

<P>VERSE 1. <HI>But He, deep-mu&s;ing, o'er the mountains &s;tray'd.</HI>]
I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the ob&s;ervation of <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us</HI> up|on
the fir&s;t ver&s;es in this book: The &s;ame method, remarks
that Author, makes both pro&s;e and ver&s;e beautiful; which
con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e three things, the judicious coaptation and
ranging of the words, the po&s;ition of the members and parts of
the ver&s;e, and the various mea&s;ure of the periods. Whoever
would write elegantly, mu&s;t have regard to the different turn
and juncture of every period, there mu&s;t be proper di&s;tances and
pau&s;es; every ver&s;e mu&s;t be a compleat &s;entence, but broken and
interrupted, and the parts made unequal, &s;ome longer, &s;ome
&s;horter, to give a variety of cadence to it. Neither the turn of
the parts of the ver&s;e, nor the length, ought to be alike. This is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: For the Epic or Heroic ver&s;e is of a fix'd de|terminate
length, and we cannot, as in the Lyric, make one long|er,
and another &s;horter; therefore to avoid an identity of
cadence, and a perpetual return of the &s;ame periods, it is re|qui&s;ite
to contract, lengthen, and interrupt the pau&s;e and &s;tru|cture
of the members of the ver&s;es, to create an harmonious in|equality,
and out of a fix'd number of &s;yllables to rai&s;e a perpe|tual
diver&s;ity. For in&s;tance,
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
Here one line makes one &s;entence; the next is &s;horter,
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">&mdash;</Q>
The next is &s;till &s;horter,
<Q>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">&mdash;</Q>
The next &s;entence compo&s;es two Hemy&s;tics,

and is entirely unlike any of the preceding periods.
<Q><L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L></Q>
Here again the &s;entence is not fini&s;h'd with the former ver&s;e, but
breaks into the fourth line; and le&s;t we &s;hould be out of breath
with the length of the &s;entence, the period and the ver&s;e conclude
together at the end of it.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Homer</HI> begins a new &s;entence, and makes it pau&s;e diffe|rently
from any of the former.
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></Q>
Then he adds,
<Q><L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">&mdash;</L></Q>
This is perfectly unequal to the foregoing period, and the pau&s;e of
the &s;entence is carry'd forward into the &s;econd ver&s;e; and what
then follows is neither di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the pau&s;es nor parts peri|odically,
but almo&s;t at every word there is a &s;top.
<Q><L>&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></L>
<L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</L></Q>
No doubt but <HI>Homer</HI> was a perfect ma&s;ter of numbers; a man
can no more be a Poet than a Mu&s;ician, without a good ear, as
we u&s;ually expre&s;s it. 'Tis true, that ver&s;i&s;ication is but the Me|chani&s;m
of Poetry, but it &s;ets off good &s;en&s;e to the be&s;t advantage,
'tis a colouring that enlivens the portrait, and makes even a beau|ty
more agreeable.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="333">

<Q><L>Tho' deep, yet clear, tho' gentle, yet not dull,</L>
<L>Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.</L></Q>
&startq;There are few (&s;ays he) who make ver&s;es, that have ob&s;erv'd the
&s;weetne&s;s of the&s;e lines, and fewer who can find the rea&s;on of
it.&endq; But I believe no one will be at a lo&s;s to &s;olve the difficulty
who con&s;iders this ob&s;ervation of <HI>Diony&s;ius:</HI> and I doubt not but
the chief &s;weetne&s;s ari&s;es from the judicious and harmonious
pau&s;es of the &s;everal periods of the ver&s;es; not to mention the
happy choice of the words, in which there is &s;carce one rough
con&s;onant, many liquids, and tho&s;e liquids &s;often'd with a mul|titude
of vowels.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>VERSE 25. <HI>Here &s;ate</HI> Eumaeus, <HI>and his cares apply'd,</HI> &amp;c.]
I doubt not but this employment of <HI>Eumaeus</HI> has been another
cau&s;e of the mean character that has been form'd of his conditi|on:
But this mi&s;take ari&s;es from our judging of the dignity of
men from the employments they follow'd three thou&s;and years
pa&s;t, by the notions we have of tho&s;e employments at pre&s;ent;
and becau&s;e they are now only the occupation of the vulgar, we
imagine that they were &s;o formerly: Kings and Princes in the
earlier ages of the world labour'd in arts and occupations, and
were above nothing that tended to promote the conveniencies
of life; they perform'd that with their own hands, which we
now perform by tho&s;e of our &s;ervants: If this were not &s;o, the
cookery of <HI>Achilles</HI> in the <HI>Iliad</HI> would equally di&s;parage that
Heroe, as this employment would di&s;grace <HI>Eumaeus</HI> in the <HI>Ody&s;|&s;ey:</HI>
Arts were then in their infancy, and were honourable to
the practi&s;ers: Thus <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> builds a ve&s;&s;el with his own hands,
as skilfully as a Shipwright.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="334">
Be&s;ides, even at this day Arts are in high e&s;teem in the orien|tal
world, and are practis'd by the greate&s;t per&s;onages. Every
man in <HI>Turky</HI> is of &s;ome trade; Sultan <HI>Achmet</HI> was a maker
of Ivory Rings, which the <HI>Turks</HI> wear upon their thumbs
when they &s;hoot their arrows, and in this occupation he
work'd &s;everal hours daily; and another of their Emperors was
depos'd, becau&s;e he refus'd to work in his occupation.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that our Tran&s;lations have contributed to
give tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the <HI>Greek,</HI> a mean Idea
of <HI>Eumaeus.</HI> This place is thus render'd by two of his Tran&s;lators.
<Q><L>Him&s;elf there &s;ate ord'ring a pair of brogues,</L>

<Q><L>Him&s;elf was leather to his foot applying,</L>

'Tis true, a Tran&s;lator in &s;uch places as the&s;e has an hard task;
a language like the <HI>Greek,</HI> which is always flowing, mu&s;ical,
and &s;onorous, is very difficult to be imitated in other tongues,
e&s;pecially where the corre&s;ponding words are not equally &s;ignifi|cant

<P>In &s;hort, the Reader is to con&s;ider this whole de&s;cription as a
true picture of ancient life; and then he will not fail of the plea|&s;ure
of knowing how the great men of ancient times pa&s;&s;ed
their lives, and how tho&s;e Heroes who perform'd &s;uch noble parts
on the public &s;tage of life, acted in private when withdrawn from
notice and ob&s;ervation. Tho&s;e ages retain'd an univer&s;al &s;implicity
of manners: <HI>Telemachus</HI> and <HI>Eumaeus</HI> have both dogs for their
<PB N="341" REF="335">

<P>VERSE 122. <HI>Twelve herds, twelve flocks,</HI> &amp;c.] I have alrea|dy
remark'd that <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> was a wealthy King, and this place is
an in&s;tance of it. He is ma&s;ter of twelve herds of Oxen, which
<PB N="345" REF="339">
probably amounted to fourteen thou&s;and four hundred head; for
if we count the herds by the &s;ame way of computation as the
droves of &s;wine, they will make that number, each drove con|&s;i&s;ting
of twelve hundred; for tho' <HI>Homer</HI> mentions but three hun|dred
and &s;ixty boars, yet he tells us, the rea&s;on why they were in|ferior
to the females was becau&s;e of the luxury of the &s;uitors. If
this be allow'd, then he had likewi&s;e the &s;ame number of &s;heep,
and as many hogs: for <HI>Eumaeus</HI> had the charge only of one herd,
eleven more were under the care of other officers: <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> like|wi&s;e
had thirteen thou&s;and two hundred goats. This will appear
to be a true calculation from the words of <HI>Homer,</HI> who tells us
that twenty of the greate&s;t Heroes of the age were not &s;o wealthy
as <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The old Poets and Hi&s;torians to expre&s;s a per&s;on of great riches
gave him the epithet of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">;
that is, &startq;a per&s;on that had a great number of &s;heep or cattle,
or a per&s;on of great wealth:&endq; This is likewi&s;e evident from
the holy Scriptures: <HI>David</HI> had his Officers, like <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> to attend
his flocks and herds: Thus 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxvii. <HI>Jehonathan</HI> was &s;et over
his trea&s;ures in the field, cities and villages; <HI>Shimei</HI> over his vine|yards;
<HI>Zabdi</HI> over his wines; <HI>Baal-hanan</HI> over his olive trees, and
<HI>Joa&s;h</HI> over his oil: He had herd&s;men that had charge over his
cattle, &s;heep, camels and a&s;&s;es. It was by cattle that the ancient
Kings enriched them&s;elves from the earlie&s;t ages: Thus no le&s;s a
per&s;on than <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> a powerful King of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> gave <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>
leave to appoint his brethren to be Rulers over his cattle; and
we read in all the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, that the wealth of Kings origi|nally
con&s;i&s;ted in herds and flocks. They lo&s;e much of the plea|&s;ure
of <HI>Homer</HI> who read him only as a Poet: he gives us an ex|act
Image of ancient life, their manners, cu&s;toms, laws, and
Politics; and it mu&s;t double our &s;atisfaction, when we con&s;ider
that in reading <HI>Homer</HI> we are reading the mo&s;t ancient Author
in the world, except the great Lawgiver <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>

tenderne&s;s and humanity. I will not call <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> cries <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> by

the be&s;t of men, good in every circum&s;tance of life: Valiant in
war, patient in adver&s;ity, a kind father, husband, and ma&s;ter, as
well as a mild and merciful King: By this conduct the Poet
deeply engages our affections in the good or ill fortune of the
Heroe: He makes him&s;elf ma&s;ter of our pa&s;&s;ions, and we re|joice

<HI>Solon</HI> was the fir&s;t who di&s;cover'd the latent &s;en&s;e of it, as <HI>Plu|tarch</HI>
informs us; &startq;<HI>Solon,</HI> &s;ays that Author, ob&s;erving the ine|quality
of the months, and that the Moon neither agreed with
the ri&s;ing or &s;etting of the Sun, but that often in the &s;ame

<HI>the old and new Moon;</HI> and allotted that part of the day
that preceded the Conjunction, to the old Moon, and the o|ther
part of it to the new: from hence we may judge that
he was the fir&s;t that comprehended the &s;en&s;e of this ver&s;e of
<HI>Homer,</HI>
<Q><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</Q>
Accordingly he nam'd the following day, <HI>the day of the new
Moon. Uly&s;&s;es</HI> then means that he will return on the la&s;t day of
the month, for on that day the Moon is both old and new; that
is, &s;he fini&s;hes one month, and begins another.&endq; This is taken
from the life of <HI>Solon;</HI> but whether the obvious &s;en&s;e in which

be preferable, is &s;ubmitted to the Reader's judgment; I confe&s;s

<P>VERSE 229. <HI>Know then I came From &s;acred</HI> Crete.] This
whole narration is a notable in&s;tance of that artful di&s;&s;imulation
&s;o remarkable in the character of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and an evidence that
<PB N="348" REF="342">
<HI>Homer</HI> excellently &s;u&s;tains it thro' the whole Poem, for <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
appears to be <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, as he is repre&s;ented in the fir&s;t line,
throughout the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> This narrative has been both prais'd and
cen&s;ur'd by the Critics, e&s;pecially by <HI>Rapin;</HI> I will lay his ob&s;er|vations
before the reader.</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Homer</HI> is guilty of verbo&s;ity, and of a tedious prolix man|ner
of &s;peaking: he is the greate&s;t talker of all Antiquity: The
very <HI>Greeks,</HI> tho' chargeable with an exce&s;s this way above all
Nations, have reprehended <HI>Homer</HI> for his intemperance of
words; he is ever upon his Rehear&s;als, and not only of the
&s;ame words, but of the &s;ame things, and con&s;equently is in a
perpetual circle of repetitions. 'Tis true he always &s;peaks na|turally,
but then he always &s;peaks too much: His adventures
in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which he relates to <HI>Eumaeus,</HI> are truly idle imperti|nent
&s;tories, purely for amu&s;ement: there is no thread in his
di&s;cour&s;e, nor does it &s;eem to tend to any propos'd end, but
exceeds all bounds: that va&s;t fluency of &s;peech, and tho&s;e
mighty overflowings of fancy, make him &s;hoot beyond the
mark. Hence his draughts are too accurate, and leave no|thing
to be perform'd by the imagination of the reader, a fault
which (as <HI>Cicero</HI> ob&s;erves) <HI>Apelles</HI> found in the antient Pain|ters.&endq;
This objection is intended only again&s;t the fulne&s;s of
<HI>Homer</HI>'s expre&s;&s;ion, not again&s;t the &s;ubject of the Narration: for
<HI>Rapin</HI> in another place &s;peaking of the beauties of <HI>Homer,</HI> gives
this very Story as an in&s;tance of his excellency: the&s;e are his
words,</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of all the Relations which <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> makes
to <HI>Eumaeus</HI> upon his return to his Country, and his wonderful
management to bring about his Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment; that whole
&s;tory is dre&s;t in colours &s;o decent, and at the &s;ame time &s;o
noble, that Antiquity can hardly match any part of the Nar|ration.</P>
<P>If what <HI>Rapin</HI> remarks in the latter Period be true, <HI>Homer</HI> will
ea&s;ily obtain a pardon for the fault of prolixity, imputed to him in
the aforemention'd objection. For who would be willing to retrench
one of the mo&s;t decent and noble narrations of Antiquity, meerly
<PB N="349" REF="343">
for the length of it? But it may, perhaps, be true that this &s;to|ry
is not impertinent, but well &s;uited to carry on the de&s;ign of
<HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and con&s;equently tends to a propos'd End: for in this
con&s;i&s;ts the &s;trength of <HI>Rapin</HI>'s objection.</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident than that the whole &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
depends upon his di&s;gui&s;e; a di&s;covery would be fatal to him, and at
once give a &s;ingle una&s;&s;i&s;ted per&s;on into the power of his enemies.
How then is this Di&s;gui&s;e to be carried on? e&s;pecially when <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI>
in per&s;on is required to give an account of his own &s;tory? Mu&s;t
it not be by a&s;&s;uming the name of another per&s;on, and giving
a plau&s;ible relation of his life, fortunes, and calamities, that brought
him to a &s;trange country, where he has no acquaintance or friend?
This obliges him to be circum&s;tantial, nothing giving a greater
air of probability than de&s;cending to particularities, and this
nece&s;&s;itates his prolixity. The whole relation is comprehended in
the compa&s;s of an hundred and &s;eventy lines; and an Epi&s;ode
of no greater length may not perhaps de&s;erve to be call'd <HI>ver|bo&s;e,</HI>
if compar'd with the length of the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey:</HI> Nay, there
may be a rea&s;on given why it ought to be of a con&s;iderable
length: There is a pau&s;e in the action, while <HI>Minerva</HI> pa&s;&s;es
from <HI>Ithaca,</HI> to <HI>Telemachus</HI> in <HI>Lacedaemon</HI> This interval is to be
fill'd up with &s;ome incident relating to <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> until <HI>Telemachus</HI>
is prepar'd to return; for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary to re-e&s;tabli&s;h
the affairs of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es.</HI> This then is a time of lei&s;ure, and the Poet
fills it up with the narrations of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es</HI> till the return of <HI>Telema|chus,</HI>
and con&s;equently there is room for a long relation. Be|&s;ides
(remarks <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI>) <HI>Homer</HI> intere&s;ts all men of all ages in
the &s;tory, by giving us pieces of true hi&s;tory, antient cu&s;toms,

The&s;e Oaks of <HI>Dodona</HI> were held to be oraculous, and to be en|dued

to be the Prie&s;te&s;&s;es of the Deity. <HI>Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Euterpe</HI> gives a

he was inform'd by the Prie&s;te&s;&s;es of <HI>Dodona,</HI> that two black
Pigeons flew away from <HI>Thebes</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and one of them perch|ing
upon a Tree in <HI>Dodona,</HI> admoni&s;h'd the Inhabitants with an
human voice to erect an Oracle in that place to <HI>Jupiter.</HI> But
<HI>Herodotus</HI> &s;olves this Fable after the following manner. &startq;There
were two Prie&s;te&s;&s;es carryed away from <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and one of
them was &s;old by the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> where &s;he in her
&s;ervitude con&s;ecrated an Altar to <HI>Jupiter</HI> under an oak; the <HI>Do|donaeans</HI>
gave her the name of a Pigeon, becau&s;e &s;he was a
<HI>Barbarian,</HI> and her &s;peech at fir&s;t no more under&s;tood than the
chattering of a Bird or Pigeon; but as &s;oon as &s;he had learn'd

&s;poke with an human Voice. She had the epithet <HI>Black,</HI> be|cau&s;e
&s;he was an <HI>Aegyptian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> informs us, that <HI>Dodona</HI> was antiently a City of
<HI>The&s;protia,</HI> and in proce&s;s of time the limits of it being chang'd,
it became of the country of the <HI>Molo&s;&s;ians,</HI> that is, it lay be|tween
<HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> and <HI>Epirus:</HI> Near this city was a mountain nam'd
<HI>Tmarus</HI> or <HI>Tomourus;</HI> on this mountain there &s;tood a Temple, and
within the precincts of it were the&s;e oraculous Oaks of <HI>Jupiter:</HI>
This was the mo&s;t ancient Temple of <HI>Greece,</HI> according to <HI>He|rodotus,</HI>
founded by the <HI>Pela&s;gians,</HI> and at fir&s;t &s;erv'd by Prie&s;ts

and the &s;ame word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ignifying al&s;o Pigeons, gave occa&s;ion
<PB N="352" REF="346">
to the fable of the Temple of <HI>Dodona</HI> having Doves for Prie&s;te&s;|&s;es.
But if, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirms, the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> &s;old this Prie&s;te&s;s
of <HI>Jupiter</HI> originally to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> it is probable they were
called Doves, after the <HI>Phoenician</HI> language, in which the &s;ame
word with a &s;mall alteration &s;ignifies both a Dove and a Prie&s;t|e&s;s.
See Note on <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> 12.</P>
<P><HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> gives us another &s;olution of this difficulty, and tells
us that as there were <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>Augurs,</HI> who drew predicti|ons
from the flight and ge&s;tures of Crows; &s;o there were o|thers
who predicted from ob&s;ervations made upon Doves: and

by the Augurs.</P>
<P>I have remark'd that the Temple of <HI>Dodona</HI> &s;tood upon the
mountain <HI>Timourus,</HI> hence the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> came to &s;ignify

<P>But whence aro&s;e the Fable of the&s;e oaks being vocal? I doubt
