<P>THUS pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t eight days of the Tunbridge
excur&s;ion, and another week &s;ucceeded without any va|rying
event.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery now, impelled with concern for Ca|milla,
and re&s;entment again&s;t Edgar, renewed the &s;ub|ject
of her opinion and advice upon his character and
conduct. &startq;My dear young friend,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;I
cannot bear to &s;ee your days, your views, your feelings,
thus fruitle&s;sly con&s;umed: I have ob&s;erved this young
man narrowly, and I am convinced he is not worth your
con&s;ideration.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, deeply colouring, was beginning to a&s;&s;ure her
&s;he had no need of this coun&s;el; but Mrs. Arlbery, not
li&s;tening, continued.</P>
<P>&startq;I know what you mu&s;t &s;ay; yet, once more, I
cannot refrain venturing at the liberty of lending you my
experience. Turn your mind from him with all the
expedition in your power, or its peace may be touched
for the better half of your life. You do not &s;ee, he
does not, perhaps, him&s;elf know how exactly he
is calculated to make you wretched. He is a watcher;
and a watcher, re&s;tle&s;s and perturbed him&s;elf, infe&s;ts
all he pur&s;ues with unea&s;ine&s;s. He is without tru&s;t,
and therefore without either courage or con&s;i&s;tency.
To-day he may be per&s;uaded you will make all his hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="202" REF="3">
to-morrow, he may fear you will give him no|thing
but mi&s;ery. Yet it is not that he is jealous of
any other; 'tis of the object of his choice he is jealous,
le&s;t &s;he &s;hould not prove good enough to merit it. Such
a man, after long wavering, and lo&s;ing probable happi|ne&s;s
in the terror of po&s;&s;ible di&s;appointment, will either
die an old batchelor, with endle&s;s repinings at his own
lingering fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s, or el&s;e marry ju&s;t at the eve of
confinement for life, from a fit of the gout. He then
makes, on a &s;udden, the fir&s;t prudent choice in his way;
a choice no longer difficult, but from the embarra&s;&s;ment
of its ea&s;e; for &s;he mu&s;t have no beauty, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould
be &s;ought by others, no wit, le&s;t others &s;hould be &s;ought
by her&s;elf; and no fortune, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould bring with
it a ta&s;te of independence, that might curb his own will,
when the &s;trength and &s;pirit are gone with which he
might have curbed her's.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla attempted to laugh at this portrait; but Mrs.
Arlbery intreated her to con&s;ider it as faithful and ex|act.
&startq;You have thought of him too much,&endq; cried &s;he,
&startq;to do ju&s;tice to any other, or you would not, with
&s;uch perfect unconcern, pa&s;s by your daily increa&s;ing in|fluence
with Sir Sedley Clarendel.&endq;</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ively, and very &s;eriou&s;ly offended, Camilla
earne&s;tly be&s;ought to be &s;pared any hints of &s;uch a na|ture.</P>
<P>&startq;I know well,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;how repugnant to &s;e|venteen
is every idea of life that is rational. Let us,
therefore, &s;et a&s;ide, in our di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, any thing &s;o
really beneficial, as a &s;olid connection formed with a
view to the worldly comforts of exi&s;tence and &s;peak of
Sir Sedley's devoirs merely as the in&s;trument of teaching
Mandlebert, that he is not the only rich, young, and hand|&s;ome
man in this lower &s;phere, who has viewed Mi&s;s
Camilla Tyrold with complacency. Clarendel, it is
true, would lo&s;e every charm in my e&s;timation by lofing
his heart; for the earth holds nothing comparable for
deadne&s;s of weight, with a poor &s;oul really in love&mdash;
except when it happens to be with one&s;elf!&mdash;yet, to
alarm the &s;elfi&s;h irre&s;olution of that impenetrable Man|dlebert,
<PB N="203" REF="4">
I &s;hould really delight to behold him complete|ly
caught.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and confu&s;ed, &s;ought to parry the
whole as raillery: but Mrs. Arlbery would not be
turned a&s;ide from her &s;ubject and purpo&s;e, &startq;I langui&s;h,
I own,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;to &s;ee that frozen youth worked
up into a little &s;en&s;ibility. I have an in&s;tinctive aver|&s;ion
to tho&s;e cold, haughty, drawing-back characters,
who are made up of the egoti&s;m of looking out for &s;ome|thing
that is wholly devoted to them, and that has not
a breath to breathe that is not a &s;igh for their perfec|tions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! this is far&mdash;&endq; Camilla began meaning to &s;ay,
far from the character of Mandlebert; but a&s;hamed of
undertaking his defence, &s;he &s;topt &s;hort, and only men|tally
added, even excellence &s;uch as his cannot, then,
with&s;tand prejudice!</P>
<P>&startq;If there is any way,&endq; continued Mrs. Arlbery,
&startq;of animating him for a moment out of him&s;elf, it can
only be by giving him a dread of &s;ome other. The
poor Major does his be&s;t; but he is not rich enough
to be feared, unle&s;s he were more attractive. Sir
Sedley will &s;eem more formidable. Countenance,
therefore, his pre&s;ent propen&s;ity to wear your chains,
till Mandlebert perceives that he is putting them on;
and then&mdash;mount to the ri&s;ing ground you ought to
tread, and &s;hew, at once your power and your di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s,
by turning from the hand&s;ome Baronet
and all his immen&s;e wealth, to mark&mdash;&s;ince you are de|termined
to indulge it&mdash;your unbia&s;&s;ed preference for
Mandlebert.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, irre&s;i&s;tibly appea&s;ed by a picture &s;o flatter|ing
to all her be&s;t feelings, and deare&s;t wi&s;hes, looked
down; angry with her&s;elf to find &s;he felt no longer
angry with Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, perceiving a point gained, deter|mined
to enforce the blow, and then leave her to her
reflections.</P>
<P>&startq;Mandlebert is a creature who&s;e whole compo&s;i|tion
is a pile of accumulated punctillos. He will &s;pend
his life in refining away his own happine&s;s: but do not
<PB N="204" REF="5">
let him refine away yours He is ju&s;t a man to be|witch
an innocent and unguarded young woman from
forming any other connexion, and yet, when her youth
and expectations have been &s;acrificed to his he&s;itation,&mdash;
to conceive he does not u&s;e her ill in thinking of her
no more, becau&s;e he has entered into no verbal engage|ment.
If his honour cannot be arraigned of break|ing
any bond,&mdash;What matters merely breaking her
heart?</P>
<P>She then left the room; but Camilla dwelt upon no|thing
&s;he had uttered except the one dear and inviting
project of proving her di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s to Edgar. &startq;O!
if once,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;I could annihilate every merce|nary
&s;u&s;picion! If once I could &s;hew Edgar that his
&s;ituation has no charms for me&mdash;and it has none!
none! then, indeed, I am his equal, though I am no|thing,
&mdash;equal in what is highe&s;t, in mind, in &s;pirit, in
&s;entiment!</P>
<P>From this time the whole of her behaviour became
coloured by this fa&s;cinating idea; and a &s;cheme which,
if propo&s;ed to her under it's real name of coquetry, &s;he
would have fled and condemned with antipathy, when
pre&s;ented to her as a means to mark her freedom from
&s;ordid motives, &s;he adopted with incon&s;iderate fond|ne&s;s.
The &s;ight, therefore, of Edgar, wherever &s;he
met him, became now the &s;ignal for adding &s;pirit to
the plea&s;ure with which, already, and without any de|&s;ign,
&s;he had attended to the young Baronet. Exer|tion
gave to her the gaiety of which &s;olicitude had de|prived
her, and &s;he appeared, in the eyes of Sir Sed|ley,
every day more charming. She indulged him with
the hi&s;tory of her adventure at the hou&s;e of Mr. Dub|&s;ter,
and his prevalent ta&s;te for the ridiculous made the
account enchant him. He ca&s;t off, in return, all airs
of affectation, when he conver&s;ed with her &s;eparately;
and though &s;till, in all mixt companies, they were re|&s;umed,
the real integrity, as well as indifference of
her heart, made that a circum&s;tance but to &s;timulate
<PB N="205" REF="6">
this new &s;pecies of intercour&s;e, by repre&s;enting it to
be equally void of future danger to them both.</P>
<P>All this, however, failed of its de&s;ired end. Edgar
never &s;aw her engaged by Sir Sedley, but he thought her
youthfully grateful, and e&s;teemed her the more, or
beheld her as a mere coquette, and cea&s;ed to e&s;teem her
at all. But never for a moment was any per&s;onal un|ea&s;ine&s;s
excited by their mutually increa&s;ing intimacy.
The conver&s;ations he had held, both with the Baronet
and her&s;elf, had &s;atisfied him that neither entertained
one &s;erious thought of the other; and he took, there|fore,
no intere&s;t in their acquaintance, beyond that which
was always alive,&mdash;a vigilant concern for the manner in
which it might operate upon her di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Major, he was by no means &s;o
entirely at his ea&s;e He &s;aw him &s;till the declared and
undi&s;gui&s;ed pur&s;uer of her favour; and though he per|ceived,
at the &s;ame time, &s;he rather avoided than &s;ought
him, he &s;till imagined, in general his acceptance was
arranged, from the many preceding circum&s;tances
which had fir&s;t given him that belief. The whole of
her behaviour, neverthele&s;s, perplexed as much as it
grieved him, and frequently, in the &s;ame half hour,
&s;he &s;eemed to him all that was mo&s;t amiable for in|&s;piring
admiration, and all that was lea&s;t to be depend|ed
upon, for retaining attachment.</P>
<P>Yet however, from time to time, he felt alarmed or
offended, he never cea&s;ed to experience the fonde&s;t in|tere&s;t
in her happine&s;s, nor the mo&s;t tender compa&s;&s;ion
for the dangers with which he &s;aw her environed. He
knew, that though her under&s;tanding was excellent, her
temper was &s;o incon&s;iderate, that &s;he rarely con&s;ulted
it; and that, though her mind was of the pure&s;t inno|cence,
it was unguarded by caution, and unprotected by
reflexion. He thought her placed where far higher di&s;|cretion,
far &s;uperior experience might ri&s;k being &s;haken:
and he did not more fervently wi&s;h, than internally
tremble for her &s;afety. Wherever &s;he appeared, &s;he was
&s;ure of di&s;tinction: &startq;'Tis Mi&s;s Tyrold, the friend of
Mrs. Berlinton,&endq; was buzzed round the moment &s;he was
&s;een; and the particular favour in which &s;he &s;tood with
<PB N="206" REF="7">
&s;ome votaries of the <HI>ton,</HI> made even her artle&s;&s;ne&s;s, her
retired education, and her ignorance of all that pertain|ed
to the <HI>certain circles,</HI> pa&s;t over and forgiven, in con|&s;ideration
of her per&s;onal attractions, her youth, and
newne&s;s.</P>
<P>Still, however, even this celebrity was not what mo&s;t
he dreaded: &s;o &s;udden and unexpected an elevation
upon the heights of fa&s;hionable fame might make her
head, indeed, giddy, but her heart he thought formed
of materials too pure and too good to be endangered
&s;o lightly; and though frequently, when he &s;aw her
&s;o circum&s;tanced; he feared &s;he was undone for private
life, he could not reflect upon her principles and di&s;po|&s;ition,
without &s;oon recovering the belief that a &s;hort
time might re&s;tore her mind to its native &s;implicity and
worth. But another rock was in the way, again&s;t
which he apprehended &s;he might be da&s;hed, whil&s;t lea&s;t
&s;u&s;picious of any peril.</P>
<P>This rock, indeed, exhibited nothing to the view
that could have affrighted any &s;pectator le&s;s anxious|ly
watchful, or le&s;s per&s;onally intere&s;ted in regarding
it. But youth it&s;elf, in the fervour of a &s;trong attach|ment,
is as open-eyed, as ob&s;ervant, and as prophetic as
age, with all its concomitants of practice, time, and
&s;u&s;picion. This rock, indeed, far from giving notice
of danger by any &s;harp points or rough prominences,
di&s;played only the &s;moothe&s;t and mo&s;t inviting &s;urface:
for it was Mrs. Berlinton, the beautiful, the accom|pli&s;hed,
the attractive Mrs. Berlinton, whom he be|held
as the object of the greate&s;t ri&s;k &s;he had to en|counter.</P>
<P>As he &s;till pre&s;erved the character with which &s;he
had con&s;ented to inve&s;t him of her monitor, he &s;eized
every opportunity of communicating to her his doubts
and apprehen&s;ions. But in proportion as her connex|ion
with that lady increa&s;ed, u&s;e to her manners and
&s;entiments abated the wonderment they in&s;pired, and
they &s;oon began to communicate an unmixt charm, that
made all other &s;ociety, that of Edgar alone excepted,
heartle&s;s and unintere&s;ting. Yet, in the conver&s;ations
&s;he held with him from time to time, &s;he frankly related
<PB N="207" REF="8">
the extraordinary attachment of her new friend to &s;ome
unknown corre&s;pondent, and confe&s;&s;ed her own &s;urpri&s;e
when it fir&s;t came to her knowledge.</P>
<P>Edgar li&s;tened to the account with the mo&s;t unaf|fected
di&s;may, and repre&s;ented the probable danger, and
actual impropriety of &s;uch an intercour&s;e, in the &s;trong|e&s;t
and mo&s;t eloquent terms; but he could neither ap|pal
her confidence, nor &s;ubdue her e&s;teem. The open|ne&s;s
with which all had originally and voluntarily been
avowed, convinced her of the innocence with which
it was felt, and all that his exhortations could obtain,
was a remon&s;trance on her own part to Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>She found that lady, however, per&s;uaded &s;he in|dulged
but on innocent friend&s;hip, which &s;he a&s;&s;ured
her was be&s;towed upon a per&s;on of as much honour as
merit, and which only with life &s;he &s;hould relinqui&s;h,
&s;ince it was the &s;ole con&s;olation of her fettered exi&s;|tence.</P>
<P>Edgar, to whom this was communicated, &s;aw with
terror the a&s;cendance thus acquired over her judgment
as well as her affections, and became more watchful
and more unea&s;y in ob&s;erving the progre&s;s of this
friend&s;hip, than all the flattering devoirs of the gay Ba|ronet,
or the more &s;erious a&s;&s;iduities of the Major.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, indeed, was no common object,
either for fear or for hope, for admiration, or for cen|&s;ure.
She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all that was mo&s;t &s;oftly attractive,
mo&s;t bewitchingly beautiful, and mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly cap|tivating,
in mind, per&s;on, and manners. But to all
that was thus mo&s;t fa&s;cinating to others, &s;he joined un|happily
all that was mo&s;t dangerous for her&s;elf; an
heart the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible, &s;entiments the mo&s;t romantic,
and an imagination the mo&s;t exalted. She had been
an orphan from earlie&s;t years, and left, with an only
brother, to the care of a fanatical maiden aunt, who
had taught her nothing but her faith and her prayers,
without one &s;ingle le&s;&s;on upon good works, or the &s;mall|e&s;t
in&s;truction upon the practical u&s;e of her theoretical
piety. All that ever varied the&s;e &s;tudies were &s;ome
common and ill &s;elected novels and romances, which a
young lady in the neighbourhood privately lent her to
<PB N="208" REF="9">
read; till her brother, upon his fir&s;t vacation from the
Univer&s;ity, brought her the works of the Poets. The&s;e,
al&s;o, it was only in &s;ecret &s;he could enjoy; but, to her
juvenile fancy, and irregularly principled mind, that did
not render them more ta&s;tele&s;s. Whatever was mo&s;t
beautifully picture&s;que in poetry, &s;he &s;aw verified in the
charming land&s;capes pre&s;ented to her view in the part
of Wales &s;he inhabited; whatever was mo&s;t noble or
tender in romance, &s;he felt promptly in her heart, and
conceived to be general; and whatever was enthu&s;ia&s;|tic
in theology, formed the whole of her idea and her
belief with re&s;pect to religion.</P>
<P>Brought up thus, to think all things the mo&s;t unu&s;u|al
and extraordinary, were merely common and of
cour&s;e; &s;he was romantic without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and
eccentric without intention. Nothing &s;teady or ration|al
had been in&s;tilled into her mind by others: and &s;he
was too young&punc; and too fanciful to have formed her
own principles with any depth of reflection, or &s;tudy
of propriety. She had entered the world, by a &s;udden
and mo&s;t unequal marriage, in which her choice had
no part, with only two &s;elf-formed maxims for the law
of her conduct. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was, that, from
her early notions of religion, no ve&s;tal &s;hould be more
per&s;onally cha&s;te; the &s;econd, that, from her more re|cently
imbibed ones of tenderne&s;s, her heart, &s;ince &s;he
was married without its concurrence, was &s;till wholly
at liberty to be di&s;po&s;ed of by its own propen&s;ities,
without reproach and without &s;cruple.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a character, where virtue had &s;o little
guide even while innocence pre&s;ided; where the per&s;on
was &s;o alluring, and the &s;ituation &s;o open to temptation,
Edgar &s;aw with almo&s;t every &s;pecies of concern the
daily increa&s;ing friend&s;hip of Camilla. Yet while he
feared for her firmne&s;s, he knew not how to blame her
fondne&s;s; nor where &s;o much was amiable in its ob|ject,
could he cea&s;e to wi&s;h that more were right.</P>
<P>Thus again lived and died another week; and the
fourth &s;ucceeded with no actual occurrence, but a new
<PB N="209" REF="10">
change of opinion in Mrs. Arlbery, that forcibly and
cruelly affected the feelings of Camilla.</P>
<P>Uninformed of the motive that occa&s;ioned the indif|ference
with which Edgar beheld the newly awakened
gallantry of Sir Sedley, and the plea&s;ure with which
Camilla received it, Mrs. Arlbery ob&s;erved his total
unconcern, fir&s;t with &s;urpri&s;e, next with perplexity, and
finally with a belief he was &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olved again&s;t
forming any connection with her him&s;elf. This &s;he
took an early opportunity to intimate to Camilla, warm|ly
exhorting her to drive him fa&s;t from her mind.</P>
<P>Camilla a&s;&s;ured her that no ta&s;k could be more ea&s;y;
but the di&s;appointment of the project with re&s;pect to
Sir Sedley, which &s;he blu&s;hed to have adopted, hurt her
in every po&s;&s;ible direction. Coquetry was as foreign to
the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of her nature, as to the dignity of all
her early maternal precepts. She had ha&s;tily encou|raged
the devoirs of the Baronet, upon the recommen|dation
of a woman &s;he loved and admired; but now that,
the failure of her aim brought her to reflection, &s;he felt
penitent and a&s;hamed to have heeded any advice &s;o
contrary to the &s;inglene&s;s of the doctrines of her father,
and &s;o inferior to the elevation of every &s;entiment &s;he
had ever heard from her mother. If Edgar had &s;een her
de&s;ign, he had &s;urely &s;een it with contempt: and though
his manner was &s;till the mo&s;t gentle, and his advice
ever ready and friendly, the opinion of Mrs. Arlbery
was corroborated by all her own ob&s;ervations, that he
was decidedly e&s;tranged from her.</P>
<P>What repentance en&s;ued! what &s;everity of regret!
how did &s;he canva&s;s her conduct, how lament &s;he had
ever formed that fatal acquaintance with Mrs Arlbery,
which he had &s;o early oppo&s;ed, and which &s;eemed eter|nally
de&s;tined to lead her into mea&s;ures and conduct
mo&s;t foreign to his approbation!</P>
<P>The melancholy that now again took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
her &s;pirits made her decline going abroad, from a re|newed
determination to avoid all meetings with Edgar.
Mrs. Arlbery felt provoked to find his power thus un|abated,
and Sir Sedley was a&s;toni&s;hed. He &s;till &s;aw
her perpetually, from his vi&s;its at Mount Plea&s;ant; but
<PB N="210" REF="11">
his vanity, that weake&s;t yet mo&s;t predominant feature
of his character, received a &s;hock for which no mo|de&s;ty
of apprehen&s;ion or forethought had prepared him,
in finding that, when he &s;aw her no more in the pre|&s;ence
of Mandlebert, he &s;aw her no more the &s;ame.
She was ready &s;till to conver&s;e with him; but no pe|culiar
attention was flattering, no de&s;ire to oblige was
pointed. He found he had been merely a pa&s;&s;ive in|&s;trument,
in her e&s;timation, to excite jealou&s;y; and
even as &s;uch had been powerle&s;s to produce that effect.
The raillery which Mrs. Arlbery &s;pared not upon the
occa&s;ion added greatly to his pique, and his mortifica|tion
was &s;o vi&s;ible, that Camilla perceived it, and per|ceived
it with pain, with &s;hame, and with &s;urpri&s;e.
She thought now, for the fir&s;t time, that the public
homage he had paid her had private and &s;erious mo|tives,
and that what &s;he imagined mere &s;portive gallan|try,
aro&s;e from a growing attachment.</P>
<P>This idea had no gratifying power; believing Edgar
without care for her, &s;he could not hope it would &s;timu|late
his regard; and conceiving &s;he had her&s;elf excited
the partiality by wilful civilities, &s;he could feel only re|proach
from a conque&s;t, unduly, unfairly, uningenuou&s;ly
obtained.</P>
<P>In proportion as the&s;e &s;elf-upbraidings made her le&s;s
de&s;erving in her own eyes, the merits of the young
Baronet &s;eemed to augment; and in con&s;idering her|&s;elf
as culpable for having rai&s;ed his regard, &s;he appear|ed
before him with a humility that gave a &s;oftne&s;s to
her look and manners, which &s;oon proved as intere&s;ting
to Sir Sedley as her marked gaiety had been flatter|ing.</P>
<P>When &s;he perceived this, &s;he felt di&s;tre&s;&s;ed anew.
To &s;hun him was impo&s;&s;ible, as Mrs. Arlbery not only
gave him completely the freedom of her hou&s;e, but
a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly promoted their belonging always to the &s;ame
group, and being &s;eated next to each other. There
was nothing &s;he would not have done to extenuate her
error, and to obviate its ill effect upon Sir Sedley; but
as &s;he always thought her&s;elf in the wrong, and regard|ed
him as injured, every effort was accompanied with
<PB N="211" REF="12">
a timidity that gave to every change a new charm, ra|ther
than any repul&s;ive quality.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of total &s;elf-di&s;approbation, to return to
Etherington was her only wi&s;h, and to pa&s;s the interme|diate
time with Mrs. Berlinton became her &s;ole plea&s;ure.
But &s;he was forced again into public to avoid an almo&s;t
&s;ingle intercour&s;e with Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>In meeting again with Edgar &s;he &s;aw him openly
delighted at her &s;ight, but without the lea&s;t apparent
&s;olicitude, or notice, that the young Baronet had
pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t the whole of the interval upon Mount
Plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>This was in&s;tantly noticed, and in&s;tantly commented
upon by Mrs. Arlbery, who again, and &s;trongly pointed
out to Camilla, that to &s;ave her youth from being wa&s;ted
by fruitle&s;s expectation, &s;he mu&s;t forget young Mandle|bert,
and &s;tudy only her own amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Camilla di&s;&s;ented not from the opinion; but the doc|trine
to which it was ea&s;y to agree, it was difficult to
put in practice; and her ardent mind believed it&s;elf fet|tered
for ever, and for ever unhappy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Traits of In&s;truction.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ixth and la&s;t we $word$ de&s;tined for the Tunbridge
&s;ojourn was begun, when Mrs. Arlbery once more took
her fair young gue&s;t apart, and intreated her attention
for one final half hour. The time, &s;he &s;aid, was fa&s;t
advancing in which they mu&s;t return to their re&s;pective
homes; but &s;he wi&s;hed to make a full and clear repre|&s;entation
of the advantages that might be reaped from this
<PB N="212" REF="13">
excur&s;ion, before the period for gathering them &s;hould
be pa&s;t.</P>
<P>She would forbear, &s;he &s;aid, entering again upon
the irk&s;ome &s;ubject of the in&s;en&s;ibility of Mandlebert,
which was, at lea&s;t, &s;ufficiently glaring to prevent any
delu&s;ion. But &s;he begged leave to &s;peak of what &s;he
believed had le&s;s obviou&s;ly &s;truck her, the apparent pro|mi&s;e
of a &s;erious attachment from Sir Sedley Claren|del.</P>
<P>Camilla would here in&s;tantly have broken up the
conver&s;ation, but Mrs. Arlbery in&s;i&s;ted upon being
heard.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, &s;he a&s;ked, &s;hould &s;he wilfully de&s;tine her
youth to a hopele&s;s wa&s;te of affection, and dearth of
all permanent comfort? To &s;acrifice every con&s;idera|tion
to the honours of con&s;tancy, might be &s;oothing,
and even glorious in this fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on of romance; but a
very &s;hort time would render it vapid; and the epoch
of repentance was always at hand to &s;ucceed. With
the lea&s;t addre&s;s, or the lea&s;t genuine encouragement, it
was now palpable &s;he might &s;ee Sir Sedley, and his title
and fortune at her feet.</P>
<P>Camilla re&s;entfully interrupted her, di&s;claiming with
Sir Sedley, as with every one el&s;e, all po&s;&s;ibility of
alliance from motives &s;o degrading; and per&s;i&s;ted, in
declaring, that the mo&s;t moderate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with free|dom,
would be preferable to the mo&s;t affluent obtained
by any mercenary engagement</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery de&s;ired her to recollect that Sir Sedley,
though rich even to &s;plendour, was &s;o young, &s;o gay,
&s;o hand&s;ome, and &s;o plea&s;ant, that &s;he might &s;afely
honour him with her hand, yet run no ri&s;k of being
&s;uppo&s;ed to have made a mere intere&s;ted alliance. &startq;I
throw out this,&endq; &s;he cried, in conclu&s;ion, for your deep|e&s;t
con&s;ideration, but I mu&s;t pre&s;s it no further. Sir
Sedley is evidently charmed with you at pre&s;ent; and
his vanity is &s;o potent, and, like all vanity, &s;o ea&s;ily
a&s;&s;ailable, that the &s;malle&s;t food to it, adroitly admi|ni&s;tered,
would &s;ecure him your &s;lave for life, and re|&s;cue
you from the antidiluvian court&s;hip of a man, who,
if he marries at all, is &s;o deliberate in his progre&s;s,
<PB N="213" REF="14">
that he mu&s;t reach his grand climacteric before he can
reach the altar.&endq;</P>
<P>Far from meditating upon this di&s;cour&s;e with any
view to following its precepts, Camilla found it nece&s;&s;ary
to call all her original fondne&s;s for Mrs. Arlbery to her
aid, to forgive the plainne&s;s of her attack, or the
worldline&s;s of her notions: and all that re&s;ted upon
her mind for con&s;ideration was, her belief in the &s;e|rious
regard of Sir Sedley, which, as &s;he apprehended
it to be the work of her own de&s;igned exertions, &s;he
could only think of with contrition.</P>
<P>The&s;e ruminations were interrupted by a call down
&s;tairs to &s;ee a learned bullfinch. The Dennels and Sir
Sedley were pre&s;ent, &s;he met the eyes of the latter with
a &s;en&s;ation of &s;hame that quickly deepened her whole
face with crim&s;on. He did not behold it without emo|tion,
and exprienced a &s;trong curio&s;ity to define its ex|act
cau&s;e.</P>
<P>He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her with the mo&s;t marked
di&s;tinction; &s;he could &s;carcely an&s;wer him; but her
manner was even touchingly gentle. Sir Sedley could
not re&s;train him&s;elf from following her in every motion
by his eyes; he felt an intere&s;t concerning her that &s;ur|pri&s;ed
him; he began to doubt if it had been indiffer|ence
which cau&s;ed her late change; her &s;oftne&s;s helped
his vanity to recover its tone, and her confu&s;ion almo&s;t
confirmed him that Mrs. Arlbery had been mi&s;taken in
rallying his failure of rivalry with Mandlebert.</P>
<P>The bird &s;ung various little airs, upon certain words
of command, and mounted his highe&s;t, and de&s;cended
to his lowe&s;t perch; and made whatever evolutions were
within the circumference of his limited habitation, with
wonderful preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Camilla, however, was not more plea&s;ed by his adroit|ne&s;s,
than pained to ob&s;erve the &s;evere a&s;pect with which
his keeper i&s;&s;ued his orders. She inquired by what
means he had obtained &s;uch authority.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="15">
The man, with a &s;ignificant wag of the head, bru|tally
an&s;wered, &startq;By the true old way, Mi&s;s; I licks
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lick him!&endq; repeated &s;he, with di&s;gu&s;t; how is
it po&s;&s;ible you can beat &s;uch a poor delicate little crea|ture?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, ea&s;y enough, Mi&s;s,&endq; replied the man, grin|ning;
&startq;every thing's the better for a little beating, as
I tells my wife. There's nothing &s;o fine &s;et, Mi&s;s, but
what will bear it, more or le&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Sedley a&s;ked with what he could &s;trike it, that
would not endanger its life.</P>
<P>&startq;That's telling, &s;ir!&endq; cried the man, with a &s;neer;
&startq;howbeit, we've plenty of ill luck in the trade. No
want of that. For one that I rears, I lo&s;es &s;ix or &s;e|ven.
And &s;ometimes they be &s;o plaguy &s;ulky, they
tempt me to give 'em a knock a little matter too hard,
and then they'll fall you into a fit, like, and go off in a
twinkle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how can you have the cruelty,&endq; cried Ca|milla,
indignantly, &startq;to treat in &s;uch a manner a poor
little in offen&s;ive animal who does not under&s;tand what
you require?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, yes, a does, mi&s;s, they knows what I wants as
well as I do my&s;elf; only they're &s;o dead tire&s;ome at
being &s;hy. Why now this one here, as does all his
learning to &s;atisfaction ju&s;t now, mayhap wont' do no|thing
at all by an hour or two. Why &s;ometimes you
may pinch 'em to a mummy before you can make 'em
budge.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pinch them!&endq; exclaimed &s;he; &startq;do you ever
pinch them?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do I? Ay, mi&s;s. Why how do you think one
larns them dumb creturs? It don't come to 'em na|tural.
They are main dull of them&s;elves. This one
as you &s;ee here would do nothing at all, if he was not
afraid of a tweak.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Poor unhappy little thing!&endq; cried &s;he! &startq;I hope,
at lea&s;t, now it has learnt &s;o much, its &s;ufferings are
over!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="16">
&startq;Yes, yes, he's pretty well off. I always gives
him his fill when he's done his day's work. But a little
&s;queak now and then in the intrum does 'em no harm.
They're mortal cunning. One's forced to be pretty
tough with 'em.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How &s;hould I rejoice,&endq; cried Camilla, &startq;to re&s;|cue
this one poor unoffending and oppre&s;&s;ed little ani|mal
from &s;uch tyranny!&endq; Then, taking out her pur&s;e,
&s;he de&s;ired to know what he would have for it.</P>
<P>The man, as a very great favour, &s;aid he would take
ten guineas; though it would be his ruin to part with it,
as it was all his livelihood; but he was willing to oblige
the young lady.</P>
<P>Camilla, with a con&s;trained laugh, but a very natural
blu&s;h, put up her pur&s;e, and &s;aid: &startq;Thou mu&s;t linger
on, then, in captivity, thou poor little unde&s;erving &s;uf|ferer,
for I cannot help thee!&endq;</P>
<P>Every body prote&s;ted that ten guineas was an impo&s;i|tion;
and the man offered to part with it for five.</P>
<P>Camilla, who had imagined it would have co&s;t half
a guinea, was now more a&s;hamed, becau&s;e equally in|capable
to an&s;wer &s;uch a demand; &s;he declined, there|fore,
the compo&s;ition, and the man was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>At night, when &s;he returned to her own room from
the play, &s;he &s;aw the little bulfinch, repo&s;ing in a $$perb,
cage, upon her table.</P>
<P>Delighted fir&s;t, and next perplexed, &s;he flew to Mrs.
Arlbery, and inquired whence it came.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was as much amazed as her$word$.</P>
<P>Que&s;tions were then a&s;ked of the &s;ervan$$ but none
knew, or none would own, how the bir$$ $came thus
&s;ituated.</P>
<P>Camilla could not now doubt but Sir S$dley had given
this commi&s;&s;ion to his &s;ervant, who $word$ ea&s;ily place
the cage in her room, from his con&s;ant acce&s;s to the
hou&s;e. She was enchanted to &s;ee the little animal re|lieved
from &s;o painful a life, but he$itated not a moment
in re&s;olving to refu&s;e its acceptance.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="17">
When Sir Sedley came the next day, &s;he carried it
down, and, with a &s;mile of open plea&s;ure, thanked him
for giving her &s;o much &s;hare in his generous liberality;
and a&s;ked if he could take it home with him in his car|riage,
or, if &s;he &s;hould &s;end it to his hotel.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley was di&s;appointed, yet felt the propriety of
her delicacy and her &s;pirit. He did not deny the &s;tep
he had taken; but told her that having ha&s;tily, from the
truth of reflection her compa&s;&s;ion had awakened, order|ed
his &s;ervant to follow the man, and buy the bird, he
had forgotten, till it arrived, his incapability of taking
care of it. His valet was as little at home as him&s;elf,
and there was &s;mall chance, at an inn, that any maid
would &s;o carefully watch, as to prevent its falling a prey
to the many cats with which it was &s;warming. He
hoped, therefore, till their return to Hamp&s;hire, &s;he
would take charge of a little animal that owed its deli|verance
from &s;lavery to her pitying comments.</P>
<P>Camilla, in&s;tinctively, would with unfeigned joy,
have accepted &s;uch a tru&s;t: but &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw
&s;omething archly &s;ignificant in the eye of Mrs. Arlbery,
and therefore &s;tammered out, &s;he was afraid &s;he &s;hould
her&s;elf be too little at home to &s;ecure its &s;afety.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley, looking extremely blank, &s;aid, it would
be better to re-deliver it to the man, brute as he was,
than to let it be unprotected; but, where genero&s;ity
touched Camilla, reflection ever flew her; and off all
guard at &s;uch an idea, &s;he exclaimed &s;he would rather
relinqui&s;h going out again while at Tunbridge, than ren|der
his humanity abortive; and ran off precipitately
with the bird to her chamber.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, &s;oon following, prai&s;ed her behavi|our;
and &s;aid, &s;he had &s;ent the Baronet away perfectly
happy.</P>
<P>Camilla, much provoked, would now have had the
bird conveyed after him; but Mrs. Arlbery a&s;&s;ured her,
incon&s;i&s;tency in a woman was as flattering, as in a man
it was tedious and alarming; and per&s;uaded her to let
the matter re&s;t.</P>
<P>Her mind, however, did not re&s;t at the &s;ame time:
in the evening, when the Baronet met them at the
<PB N="217" REF="18">
Rooms, he was not only unu&s;ually gay, but looked at
her with an air and manner that &s;eemed palpably to
mark her as the cau&s;e of his &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In the deepe&s;t di&s;turbance, &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf
now to be in a difficulty the mo&s;t delicate; &s;he could
not come forward to clear it up, without announcing
expectations from his partiality which he had never au|thori&s;ed
by any declaration; nor yet &s;uffer &s;uch &s;ymp|toms
of his believing it welcome to pa&s;s unnoticed,
without ri&s;king the reproach of u&s;ing him ill, when &s;he
made known, at a later period, her indifference.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery would not aid her, for &s;he thought the
embarra&s;&s;ment might lead to a termination the mo&s;t for|tunate.
To con&s;ult with Edgar was her fir&s;t wi&s;h; but
how open &s;uch a &s;ubject? The very thought, however,
gave her an air of &s;olicitude when he &s;poke to her, that
&s;truck him, and he watched for an opportunity to &s;ay,
&startq;You have not, I hope, forgotten my province?&mdash;
May I, in my permitted office, a&s;k a few que&s;tions?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, yes!&endq; cried &s;he, with alacrity; &startq;And, when
they are a&s;ked, and when I have an&s;wered them, if you
&s;hould not be too much tired, may I a&s;k &s;ome in my
turn?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Of me!&endq; cried he, with the mo&s;t gratified &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;Not concerning your&s;elf!&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, blu&s;h|ing;
&startq;but upon &s;omething which a little di&s;tre&s;&s;es
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When, and where may it be?&endq; cried he, while a
thou&s;and conjectures rapidly &s;ucceeded to each other;
&startq;may I call upon Mrs. Arlbery to-morrow morning?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, no! we &s;hall be, I &s;uppo&s;e, here again at
night,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered; dreading arranging a vi&s;it Mrs.
Arlbery would treat, &s;he knew, with raillery the mo&s;t
unmerciful.</P>
<P>There was time for no more, as that lady, &s;uddenly
tired, led the way to the carriage. Edgar followed her
to the door, hoping and fearing, at once, every thing
that was mo&s;t intere&s;ting from a confidence &s;o voluntary
and &s;o unexpected.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="19">
Camilla was &s;till more agitated; for though uncer|tain
if &s;he were right or wrong in the appeal &s;he meant
to make, to conver&s;e with him openly, to be guided by
his coun&s;el, and to convince him of her &s;uperiority to

At any other time, Camilla would have propo&s;ed

<P>He was undone, then, he &s;aid; for he could not live
without the money.</P>
<P>&startq;Rather &s;ay, not with it,&endq; cried &s;he; &startq;for you keep

<P>&startq;Nobody does, my dear; we all go on the &s;ame

<P><PB N="221" REF="22">
&startq;And what do you mean to be the end of it all,
Lionel? How do you propo&s;e living when all the&s;e re|&s;ources
are completely exhau&s;ted?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When I am ruined, you mean? why how do other
people live when they're ruined? I can but do the

<P>&startq;Do con&s;ider it, then, dear Lionel! for all our &s;akes,

<P>&startq;Well,&mdash;let us &s;ee.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I don't mean &s;o; I don't mean ju&s;t now; in this
mere idle manner.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, yes, I'll do it at once, and then it will be over.
Faith I don't well know. I have no great <HI>gu&s;ta</HI> for
blowing out my brains. I like the little dears mighty
well where they are. And I can't &s;ay&punc; I &s;hall much
reli&s;h to con&s;ume my life and prime and vigour in the
king's bench pri&s;on. 'Tis horribly tire&s;ome to re&s;ide
always on the &s;ame &s;pot. Nor I have no great di&s;po|tion
to whi&s;k off to another country. Old England's a
pretty place enough. I like it very well;&mdash;with a lit|tle
rhino under&s;tood! But it's the very deuce, with an
empty pur&s;e. So write the letter, my dear girl.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And is this your con&s;ideration, Lionel? And is
this its conclu&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why what &s;ignifies dwelling upon &s;uch di&s;malties?
If I think upon my ruin beforehand, I am no nearer to
enjoyment now than then. Live while we live, my

write!&endq;</P>
<P>Again &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, pleading her promi&s;e

<P>&startq;Keep a fiddle&s;tick!&endq; cried he, impatiently; &startq;you
don't know what mi&s;chief you may have to an&s;wer for!
you may bring mi&s;ery upon all our heads! you may make
my father bani&s;h me his &s;ight, you may make my mo|ther

<P>&startq;Good Heaven!&endq; cried Camilla interrupting him,
&startq;what is it you talk of? what is it you mean?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="23">
&startq;Ju&s;t what I &s;ay; and to make you under&s;tand me
better, I'll give you a hint of the truth; but you mu&s;t
lo&s;e your life twenty $$mes before you $word$&mdash;There's

<P>&startq;A pretty girl!&mdash;And what has that to do with
this rapacity for money?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What an innocent que&s;tion! why $ hat a baby thou
art, my dear Camilla?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I hope you are not forming any connexion un|known
to my father?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ha, ha, ha!&endq; cried Lionel laughing loud:
&startq;Why thou ha&s;t lived in that old par&s;onage-hou&s;e
till thou art almo&s;t too young to be rocked in a
cradle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you are entering into an engagement,&endq; &s;aid &s;he,
&s;till more gravely, &startq;that my father mu&s;t not know, and
that my mother would &s;o bitterly condemn,&mdash;why am I
to be tru&s;ted with it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You under&s;tand nothing of the&s;e things, child.
'Tis the very nature of a father to be an hunks, and of
a mother to be a bore.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O Lionel! &s;uch a father!&mdash;&s;uch a mother!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to their being perfectly good, and all that, I
know it very well. And I am very &s;orry for it A good
father is a very &s;erious misfortune to a poor lad like
me, as the world runs; it cau&s;es one &s;uch confounded
gripes of the con&s;cience for every little awkard thing
one does! A bad father would be the joy of my life;
'twould be all fair play there; the more he was chou&s;ed
the better.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But this pretty girl, Lionel!&mdash;Are you &s;erious?
Are you really engaging your&s;elf? And is &s;he &s;o poor?
Is &s;he &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that you require the&s;e immen&s;e
and frequent &s;ums for her?&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel laughed again, and rubbed his hands; but
after a &s;hort &s;ilence a&s;&s;umed a more &s;teady countenance,
and &s;aid, &startq;Don't a&s;k me any thing about her. It is
not fit you &s;hould be &s;o curious. And don't give a hint
of the matter to a &s;oul. Mind that! But as to the mo|ney,
<PB N="223" REF="24">
I mu&s;t have it. And directly: I &s;hall be blown
to the deuce el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lionel!&endq; cried Camilla, &s;hrinking. &startq;you make
me tremble! you cannot &s;urely be &s;o wicked&mdash;&s;o un|principled
&mdash;No! your connexions are never wor&s;e than
imprudent!&mdash;you would not el&s;e be &s;o unkind, &s;o in|jurious

<P>The whole face of Lionel now fl$&s;hed with &s;hame,
and he walked about the room, muttering: &startq;'Tis true.
I ought not to have done it.&endq; And &s;oon after, with
&s;till greater concern he exclaimed: &startq;If this appears
to you in &s;uch a heinous light&punc; what will my father think
of it? And how can I bear to let it be known to my
mother?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O never, never!&endq; cried &s;he emphatically; &startq;never
let it reach the knowledge of either! If indeed you
have been &s;o incon&s;iderate, and &s;o wrong&mdash;break
up, at lea&s;t, any &s;uch intercour&s;e before it offends their
ears&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But how, my dear, can I do that, if it gets blazed
abroad?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Blazed abroad!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes; and for want, only, of a few pitiful
guineas.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What can you mean? how can it depend upon a
few guineas?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Get me the guineas:&mdash;and leave the how to
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Lionel,&endq; cried &s;he, affectionately, &startq;I
would do any thing that is not ab&s;olute improper to
&s;erve you; but my uncle has now nothing more to
&s;pare; he has told me &s;o him&s;elf; and with what
courage, then, in this dark, my&s;terious, and, I fear,
wor&s;e than my&s;terious bu&s;ine&s;s, can I apply to him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear child, he only wants to hoard up his mo|ney
to &s;hew off poor Eugenia at her marriage; and you
know as well as I do what a ninny he is for his pains;
for what a poor little dowdy thing will &s;he look, dizened
out in jewels and laces?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="25">
&startq;Can you &s;peak &s;o of Eugenia? the mo&s;t amiable,
the mo&s;t de&s;erving, the mo&s;t excellent creature breath|ing!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;peak it in pure friend&s;hip. I would not have
her expo&s;ed. I love dear little Greek and Latin as
well as you do. Only the difference is I don't talk &s;o
like an old woman; and really when you do it your&s;elf,
you can't think the ridiculous effect it has, when one
looks at your young face. However, only write the
reque&s;t as if from your&s;elf, and tell him you'll acquaint
him with the rea&s;on next letter; but that the po&s;t is
ju&s;t going out now, and you have time for no more.
And then, ju&s;t coax him over a little, with, how you
long to be back, and how you hate Tunbridge, and how
you adore Cleves, and how tired you are for want of
his bright conver&s;ation,&mdash;and you may command half
his fortune.&mdash;My dear Camilla, you don't know from
what de&s;truction you will re&s;cue me! Think too of my
father, and what a &s;hock you will &s;ave him: And
think of my mother, whom I can never &s;ee again if
you won't help me?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;ighed, but let him put the pen into her hand,
whence, however, the very next moment's reflection
was urging her to ca&s;t it down, when he caught her in
his arms in a tran&s;port of joy, called her his protectre&s;s
from di&s;honour and de&s;pair, and &s;aid he would run
to the Rooms while &s;he wrote, ju&s;t to take the oppor|tunity
of &s;eeing them, and to un-order the carriage,
that &s;he might have no interruption to her compo&s;ition,
which he would come back to claim before the party
returned, as he mu&s;t &s;et off for Cleves, and gallop all
night, to procure the money, which the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle
day would render u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>All this he uttered with a rapidity that mocked every
attempt at expo&s;tulation or an&s;wer: and then ran out
of the roum and out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Horrour at &s;uch perpetual and increa&s;ing ill conduct,
grief at the compul&s;ive failure of meeting Edgar, and
perplexity how to extricate her&s;elf from her half given,
<PB N="225" REF="26">
but wholly &s;eized upon engagement to write, took for a
while nearly equally &s;hares in tormenting Camilla.
But all pre&s;ently concentred in one domineering &s;enti|ment
of &s;harp repentance for what &s;he had apparently
undertaken.</P>
<P>To claim two hundred pounds of her uncle, in her
own name, was out of all que&s;tion. She could not,
even a moment, dwell upon &s;uch a project; but how
repre&s;ent what &s;he her&s;elf &s;o little under&s;tood as the
nece&s;&s;ity of Lionel? or how a&s;$$ for &s;o large a &s;um, and
po&s;tpone, as he de&s;ired, all explanation? She was inca|pable
of any &s;pecies of fraud&punc; &s;he dete&s;ted even the
mo&s;t di&s;tant di&s;gui&s;e, Simple &s;upplication &s;eemed there|fore,
her only method; but &s;o difficult was even this,
in an affair &s;o dark and uncon&s;cionable, that &s;he began
twenty letters without proceeding in any one of them
beyond two lines.</P>
<P>Thus far, however, her ta&s;k was light to what it ap|peared
to her upon a little further deliberation. That
her brother had formed &s;ome unworthy engagement or
attachment, he had not, indeed, avowed clearly, but
he had by no means denied, and &s;he had even omitted,
in her &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ternation, exacting his promi&s;e
that it &s;hould immediately be concluded. What, then,
might &s;he be doing by endeavouring to procure this
money? Aiding perhaps vice and immorality, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ting
her mi&s;guided, if not guilty brother, to per&s;evere
in the mo&s;t dangerous errors, if not crimes?</P>
<P>She &s;huddered, &s;he pu&s;hed away her paper, &s;he ro&s;e
from the table, &s;he determined not to write another
word.</P>
<P>Yet, to permit parents &s;he ju&s;tly revered to &s;uffer
any evil &s;he had the &s;malle&s;t chance to &s;pare them, was
dreadful to her; and what evil could be inflicted upon
them, &s;o deeply, &s;o la&s;tingly &s;evere, as the conviction
of any &s;erious vices in-any of their children?</P>
<P>This, for one minute, brought her again to the table;
but the next, her better judgment pointed out the &s;hal|lowne&s;s
and fallacy of &s;uch rea&s;oning. To &s;ave them
pre&s;ent pain at the ri&s;k of future angui&s;h, to con&s;ult the
feelings of her brother, in preference to his morality.
<PB N="226" REF="27">
would be forgetting every le&s;&s;on of her life, which from
its earlie&s;t dawn, had imbibed a love of virtue, that
made her con&s;ider whatever was offen&s;ive to it as
equally di&s;gu&s;ting and unhappy.</P>
<P>To di&s;appoint Lionel was, however, terrible. She
knew well he would be deaf to remon&s;trance, ridicule
all argument, and laugh off whatever &s;he could urge by
per&s;ua&s;ion. She feared he would be quite outrageous to
find his expectations thus thwarted: and the latene&s;s
of the hour when he would hear it, and the weight he
annexed to obtaining the money expeditiou&s;ly, re|doubled
at once her regret for her momentary compli|ance&punc;
and her pity for what he would undergo through
its failure.</P>
<P>After con&s;idering in a thou&s;and ways how to &s;often
to him her recantation, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;o entirely
without courage to encounter his oppo&s;ition, that &s;he
re&s;olved to write him a &s;hort letter, and then retire to
her room, to avoid an intrview.</P>
<P>In this, &s;he be&s;ought him to forgive her error in
not &s;ooner being &s;en&s;ible of her duty, which had taught
her, upon her fir&s;t reflexion, the impo&s;&s;ibility of de|manding
two hundred pounds for her&s;elf, who wanted
nothing, and the impracticability of demanding it for
him&punc; in &s;o unintelligible a manner.</P>
<P>Thus far only &s;he had proceeded, from the length
of time con&s;umed in regret and rumination, when a vio|lent
ringing at the door, without the &s;ound of any car|riage,
made her &s;tart up, and fly to her chamber;
leaving her unfini&s;hed letter, with the beginnings of
her &s;everal e&s;&s;ays to addre&s;s Sir Hugh, upon the table,
to &s;hew her various efforts, and to explain that they
were relinqui&s;hed.</P>

<P>THUS, &s;elf-confined and almo&s;t in an agony, Ca|milla
remained for a quarter of an hour, without any
&s;pecies of interruption, and in the greate&s;t amazement
that Lionel forbore pur&s;uing her, either with letter or
me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Another violent ringing at the bell, but &s;till without
any carriage, then excited her attention, and pre&s;ently
the voice and &s;teps of Lionel re&s;ounded upon the &s;tairs,
whence her name was with violence vociferated.</P>
<P>She did not move; and in another minute he was
rapping at her chamber door, demanding admittance,
or that &s;he would in&s;tantly de&s;cend.</P>
<P>Alarmed for her open letter and papers, &s;he enquired
who was in the parlour.</P>
<P>&startq;Not a &s;oul,&endq; he an&s;wered; &startq;I have left them all
at the Rooms&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have you returned, then, twice?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No. I &s;hould have been here &s;ooner, but I met
two or three old cronies, that would not part with me.
Come, where's your letter?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have you not &s;een what I have written?&endq;</P>
<P>Down upon this intimation he flew, without any re|ply;
but was pre&s;ently back, &s;aying he found nothing
in the parlour, except a letter to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Affrighted, &s;he followed him; but not one of her
papers remained. The table was cleared, and nothing
was to be &s;een but a large packet, addre&s;&s;ed to her in a
hand &s;he did not know.</P>
<P>She rang to enquire who had been in the hou&s;e be|fore
her brother.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant an&s;wered, only Sir Sedley Clarendel,
who be thought had been there &s;till, as he had &s;aid he
&s;hould wait till Mrs. Arlbery came home.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="29">
&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;that a gentleman &s;uch
as Sir Sedley Clarendel, can have permitted him&s;elf to
touch my papers?&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel agreed that it was &s;ocking; but &s;aid the lo&s;s
of time to him&s;elf was &s;till wor&s;e; without &s;uffering
her, therefore, to open her packet, he in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he
&s;hould write another letter directly; adding, he had
met the Baronet in his way from the Rooms, but
had little &s;u&s;pected whence he came, or how he had
been amu&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Camilla now hung about her brother in the greate&s;t
tribulation, but refu&s;ed to take the pen he would have
put into her hands, and, at la&s;t, not without tears,
&s;aid: &startq;Forgive me, Lionel! but the papers you ought
to have found would have explained&mdash;that I cannot
write for you to my uncle.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel heard this with the indignation of an injured
man. He was utterly, he &s;aid, lo&s;t; and his family
would be utterly di&s;graced, for ruin mu&s;t be the lot of
his father, or exile or impri&s;onment mu&s;t be his own,
if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in &s;uch unkind and unnatural conduct.</P>
<P>Terrour now bereft her of all &s;peech or motion, till
the letter, which Lionel had been beating about in his
agitation, without knowing or caring what he was doing,
bur&s;t open, and &s;ome written papers fell to the floor,
which &s;he recogni&s;ed for her own.</P>
<P>Much amazed, &s;he &s;eized the cover, which had
only been fa&s;tened by a wafer that was &s;till wet, and
&s;aw a letter within it to her&s;elf, which &s;he ha&s;tily
read, while a paper that was enclo&s;ed dropt down, and

</LETTER>
<P>The loo&s;e paper, picked up by Lionel, was a draft,
upon a banker, for two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>While this, with &s;peechle&s;s emotion, was peru&s;ed by
Camilla, Lionel, with unbounded joy, began jumping,
&s;kipping, leaping over every chair, and capering round
and round the room in an ec&s;ta&s;y.</P>
<P>&startq;My deare&s;t Lionel,&endq; cried &s;he, when a little re|covered,
&startq;why &s;uch joy? you cannot &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;|&s;ible
this can be accepted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not accepted, child? do you think me out of my
&s;en&s;es? Don't you &s;ee me freed from all my misfor|tunes
at once? and neither my father grieved, nor my
mother offended, nor poor numps fleeced?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And when can you pay it? And what do you
mean to do? And to whom will be the obligation?
Weigh, weigh a little all this.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel heard her not; his rapture was too buoyant
for attention, and he whi&s;ked every thing out of its
place, from frantic merriment, till he put the apartment
into &s;o much di&s;order, that it was &s;carce practicable to
&s;tir a &s;tept in it; now and then interrupting him&s;elf to
make her low bows, &s;craping his feet all over the room,
and ob&s;equiou&s;ly &s;aying: &startq;My &s;i&s;ter Clarendel! How
does your La'&s;hip do? my dear Lady Clarendel, pray
afford me your La'&s;hip's countenance.&endq;</P>
<P>Nothing could be le&s;s plea&s;ant to Camilla than rail|lery
which pointed out, that, even by the unreflecting
Lionel, this action could be a&s;cribed but to one motive.
The draft, however, had fallen into his hands, and
neither remon&s;trance nor petition, neither repre&s;entati|on
of impropriety nor per&s;ua&s;ion, could induce him to
relinqui&s;h it; he would only dance, &s;ing, and pay her
grote&s;que homage, till the coach &s;topt at the door;
and then, ludicrou&s;ly hoping her Lady&s;hip would ex|cu&s;e
his leaving her, for once, to play the part of the
<PB N="230" REF="31">
hou&s;e-maid in &s;etting the room to rights, he &s;prang pa&s;t
them all, and bounded down the hill.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was much diverted by the confu&s;ion
in the parlour, and Mi&s;s Dennel a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;|tions
why the chairs and tables were all thrown down,
the china jars removed from the chimney-piece into the
middle of the room, and the fide board apparatus put
on the chimney-piece in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>Camilla was too much confounded either to laugh or
explain, and ha&s;tily wi&s;hing them good-night, retired
to her chamber.</P>
<P>Here, in the extreme&s;t perturbation, &s;he &s;aw the
full extent of her difficulties, without perceiving any
means of extrication. She had no hope of recovering
the draft from Lionel, whom &s;he had every rea&s;on to
conclude already journeying from Tunbridge. What
could &s;he &s;ay the next day to Sir Sedley? How account
for &s;o &s;udden, &s;o gro&s;s an acceptance of pecuniary obli|gation?
What inference might he not draw? And
how could &s;he undeceive him, while retaining &s;o im|proper
a mark of his dependence upon her favour? The
di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he felt that he &s;hould venture to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he
would owe to him &s;uch a debt, rendered but &s;till more
palpable the &s;pecies of expectation it might authori&s;e.</P>
<P>To de&s;troy this illu&s;ion occupied all her attention,
except what was imperiou&s;ly &s;eized upon by regret of
mi&s;&s;ing Edgar, with whom to con&s;ult was more than her
wi&s;h.</P>
<P>In this di&s;turbed &s;tate, when &s;he &s;aw Mrs. Arlbery
the next morning, her whole care was to avoid being
que&s;tioned: and that lady, who quickly perceived her
fears by her avoidance, took the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;ay
to her, with a laugh, &startq;I &s;ee I mu&s;t make no enqui|ries
into the gambols of your brother la&s;t night: but I
may put together, perhaps, certain circum&s;tances that
may give me a little light to the bu&s;ine&s;s: and if, as I
conjecture, Clarendel &s;poke out to him, his wilde&s;t
rioting is more rational than his &s;i&s;ter's gravity.'</P>
<P>Camilla prote&s;ted they had not conver&s;ed together at
all.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="32">
&startq;Nay&punc; then I own my&s;elf &s;till in the dark. But I
ob&s;erved that Clarendel left the Rooms at a very early
hour, and that your brother almo&s;t immediately follow|ed.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla ventured not any reply; and &s;oon after re|treated.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, in a few minutes, pur&s;uing her, laugh|ingly,
and with &s;portive reproach, accu&s;ed her of in|tending
to &s;teal a march to the altar of Hymen; as &s;he
had ju&s;t been informed, by her maid, that Sir Sedley
had actually been at the hou&s;e la&s;t night, during her ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he was in her
chamber when he arrived, and had not &s;een him.</P>
<P>&startq;For what in the world, then, could he come? He
was &s;ure I was not at home, for he had left me at the
Rooms?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla again was &s;ilent: but her tingling cheeks
proclaimed it was not for want of &s;omething to &s;ay.
Mrs. Arlbery forbore to pre&s;s the matter $urther; but
forbore with a nod that implied <HI>I &s;ee how it is!</HI> and a
&s;mile that publi&s;hed the plea&s;ure and approbation which
accompanied her &s;elf-conviction</P>
<P>The vexation of Camilla would have prompted an im|mediate
confe&s;&s;ion of the whole mortifying tran&s;action,
had &s;he not been endued with a &s;en&s;e of honour where
the intere&s;ts of others was concerned, that repre&s;&s;ed
her natural precipitance, and was more powerful even
than her imprudence.</P>
<P>She waited the greate&s;t part of the morning in &s;ome
little faint hope of &s;eeing Lionel: but he came not, and
&s;he &s;pent the re&s;t of it with Mrs. Berlinton. She anx|iou&s;ly
wi&s;hed to meet Edgar in the way, to a$ologi&s;e for
her non-appearance the preceding evening; but this did
not happen; and her concern was not le&s;&s;ened by reflect|ing
upon the &s;uperior intere&s;t in her health and welfare,
marked by Sir Sedley, who had taken the trouble to
walk from the Rooms to Mount Plea&s;ant to &s;ee what was
become of her.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="33">
She returned home but barely in time to dre&s;s for din|ner,
and was not yet ready, when &s;he &s;aw the carriage
of the Baronet drive up to the door.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t terrible confu&s;ion how to meet him, what
to &s;ay about the draft, how to mention her brother,
whether to &s;eem re&s;entful of the liberty he had &s;o unce|remoniou&s;ly
taken, or thankful for its kindne&s;s, &s;he had
&s;carce the force to attire her&s;elf, nor, when &s;ummoned
down &s;tairs, to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>This di&s;tre&s;s was but increa&s;ed upon her entrance, by
the &s;ight and the behaviour of the Baronet; who&s;e ad|dre&s;s
to her was &s;o marked, that it covered her with
blu&s;hes, and who&s;e air had an a&s;&s;urance that &s;poke a
&s;pecies of &s;ecret triumph. Offended as well as fright|ened,
&s;he looked every way to avoid him, or a&s;&s;umed a
look of haughtine&s;s, when forced by any direct &s;peech
to an&s;wer him. She &s;oon, however, &s;aw, by his con|tinued
&s;elf complacency, and even an increa&s;e of gaiety,
that he only regarded this as coquetry, or ba&s;hful em|barra&s;&s;ment,
&s;ince every time &s;he attempted thus to re|buff
him, an arch &s;mile &s;tole over his features, that di&s;|played
his different conception of her meaning.</P>
<P>She now wi&s;hed nothing &s;o much as a prompt and
po&s;itive declaration, that &s;he might convince him of his
mi&s;take and her rejection. For this purpo&s;e, &s;he &s;ub|dued
her de&s;ire of retreat, and &s;pent the whole after|noon
with Mrs. Arlbery and the Dennels in his com|pany.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, when Mrs. Arlbery, who had the &s;ame
object in view, though with a different conclu&s;ion, con|trived
to draw her other gue&s;ts out of the apartment and
to leave her alone with Sir Sedley, mode&s;ty and &s;hame
both interfered with her de&s;ire of an explanation, and &s;he
was ha&s;tily retiring; but the Baronet, in a gentle voice,
called after her, &startq;Are you going?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes; I have forgotten &s;omething.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He ro&s;e to follow her, with a motion that &s;eemed
purporting to take her hand; but, gliding quickly on,
&s;he prevented him, and was almo&s;t at the &s;ame moment
in her own chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="34">
With augmented &s;everity, &s;he now felt the impropri|ety
of an apparent acceptance of &s;o &s;ingular and unplea|&s;ant
an obligation, which obviou&s;ly mi&s;led Sir Sedley to
believe her at his command.</P>
<P>Shocked in her delicacy, and &s;tung in her be&s;t noti|ons
of laudable pride, &s;he could not re&s;t without de&s;|troying
this humiliating idea; and re&s;olved to apply to
Edgar for the money, and to pay the Baronet the next
day. Her objections to betraying the extravagance of
Lionel, though great and &s;incere, yielded to the &s;till
more dangerous evil of letting Sir Sedley continue in an
errour, that might terminate in branding her in his opi|nion,
with a character of incon&s;i&s;tency or duplicity.</P>
<P>Edgar, too, &s;o nearly a brother to them both, would
guard the &s;ecret of Lionel better, in all probability, than
he would guard it him&s;elf; and could draw no per&s;onal
inferences from the tru&s;t and obligation, when he found
its &s;ole incitement was &s;ooner to owe an obligation to a
ward of her father, than to a new acquaintance of her
own.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed at the &s;eeming nece&s;&s;ity of an application that
would lead &s;o naturally to a demand of the coun&s;el &s;he
langui&s;hed to claim, &s;he determined not to &s;uffer Sir Sed|ley
to wait even another minute under his mi&s;take; but,
&s;ince &s;he now could &s;peak of returning the money, to
take courage for meeting what might either precede or
en&s;ue in a conference.</P>
<P>Down, therefore, &s;he went; but as &s;he opened the
parlour door, &s;he heard Sir Sedley &s;ay to Mrs. Arlbery,
who had ju&s;t entered before her: &startq;O, fie! fie! you
know &s;he will be cruel to excruciation! you know me
de&s;tined to de&s;pair to the la&s;t degree.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who&s;e &s;o &s;peedy re-appearance was the la&s;t
&s;ight he expected, was too far advanced to retreat; and
the re&s;entment that tinged her whole complexiom &s;hew|ed
&s;he had heard what he &s;aid, and had heard it with
an application the mo&s;t offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>An immediate &s;en&s;ibility to his own impertinence now
&s;ucceeded in its vain di&s;play; he looked not merely
concerned, but contrite; and, in a voice &s;oftened near|ly
to timidity, attempted a general conver&s;ation, but
<PB N="234" REF="35">
kept his eyes, with an anxious expre&s;&s;ion, almo&s;t conti|nually
&s;ixed upon her's.</P>
<P>Anger with Camilla was a quick, but &s;hort-lived &s;en|&s;ation;
and this &s;udden change in the Baronet from
conceit to re&s;pect, produced a change equally &s;udden in
her&s;elf from di&s;dain to inquitetude. Though mortified
in the fir&s;t moment by his vanity, it was le&s;s &s;eriou&s;ly
painful to her than any belief that under it was couched
a di&s;po&s;ition towards a really &s;teady regard. With Mrs.
Arlbery &s;he was but &s;lightly offended, though certain
&s;he had been a&s;&s;uring him of all the &s;ucce&s;s he could de|mand&punc;
her way of thinking upon the &s;ubject had been
openly avowed, and &s;he did ju&s;tice to the kindne&s;s of
her motives.</P>
<P>No opportunity, however, aro&s;e to mention the re|turn
of the draft; Mrs. Arlbery &s;aw di&s;plea&s;ure in her
air, and not doubting &s;he had heard what had dropt from
Sir Sedley, thought the moment unfavourable for a
<HI>t&egrave;te-&acirc;-t&egrave;te,</HI> and re&s;olutely kept her place, till Camilla
her&s;elf, weary of u&s;ele&s;s waiting, left the room.</P>
<P>Following her then to her chamber, &startq;My dear Mi&s;s
Tyrold,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;do not let your extreme youth
&s;tand in the way of all your future life. A Baronet,
rich, young, and amiable, is upon the very point of
becoming your &s;lave for ever; yet, becau&s;e you di&s;co|ver
him to be a little re&s;tive in the la&s;t agonies of his li|berty,
you are eager, in the high-flown di&s;dain of juve|nile
&s;u&s;ceptibility, to ca&s;t him and his fortune away; as
if both were &s;uch every-day baubles, that you might
command or reject them without thought of future con|&s;equence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed no, dear madam; I am not actuated by
pride or anger; I owe too much to Sir Sedley to feel
either above a moment, even where I think them&mdash;par|don
me!&mdash;ju&s;tly excited. But I &s;hould ill pay my
debt, by accepting a la&s;ting attachment, where certain
I can return nothing but la&s;ting, eternal, unchangeable
indifference,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;acrifice, then, both him and your&s;elf, to the
fanciful delicacy of a fir&s;t love?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="36">
&startq;No, indeed!&endq; cried &s;he blu&s;hing. &startq;I have no
thought at all but of the &s;ingle life. And I &s;incerely
hope Sir Sedley has no &s;erious intentions towards me;
for my obligations to him are &s;o infinite, I &s;hould be
cruelly hurt to appear to him ungrateful.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You would appear to him, I confe&s;s, a little &s;ur|pri&s;ing,&endq;
&s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, laughing; &startq;for diffidence
certainly is not his weak part. However, with all his
foibles, he is a charming creature, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion only
can blind you to his merit.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla again denied the charge, and &s;trove to pre|vail
with her to undeceive the Baronet from any fal&s;e
expectations. But &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he would not be acce&s;|&s;ary
to &s;o much after-repentance; and left her.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s now wore a very &s;erious a&s;pect to Ca|milla.
Mrs. Arlbery avowed &s;he thought Sir Sedley
in earne&s;t, and he knew &s;he had her&s;elf heard him &s;peak
with &s;ecurity of his &s;ucce&s;s. The bullfinch had gone
far, but the draft &s;eemed to have riveted the per&s;ua&s;ion.
The bird it was now impo&s;&s;ible to return till her depar|ture
from Tunbridge; but &s;he re&s;olved not to defer ano|ther
moment putting upon her brother alone the obliga|tion
of the draft, to &s;top the further progre&s;s of &s;uch
dangerous inference.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily, therefore, &s;he wrote to him the following
note:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir Sedley Clarendel, Bart.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOME particular bu&s;ine&s;s compelled my brother &s;o
abruptly to quit Tunbridge, that he could not have the
honour to fir&s;t wait upon you with his thanks for the
loan you &s;o unexpectedly put into his hands; by mine,
however, all will be re&s;tored to-morrow morning, ex|cept
his gratitude for your kindne&s;s.</P>
<CLOSER>I am, &s;ir, in both our names,
your obliged humble &s;ervant,
<SIGNED>CAMILLA TYROLD.</SIGNED>
MOUNT PLEASANT,
Thur&s;day Evening.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="236" REF="37">
She now waited till &s;he was &s;ummoned down &s;tairs
to the carriage, and then gave her little letter to a &s;er|vant,
whom &s;he de&s;ired to deliver it to Sir Sedley's
man.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley did not accompany them to the Rooms,
but promi&s;ed to follow.</P>
<P>Camilla, on her arrival, with palpitating plea&s;ure,
looked round for Edgar. She did not, however, &s;ee
him. She was acco&s;ted directly by the Major; who,
as u&s;ual, never left her, and who&s;e a&s;&s;iduity to &s;eek her
favour &s;eemed increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>She next joined Mrs. Berlinton; but &s;till &s;he &s;aw no|thing
of Edgar. Her eyes ince&s;&s;antly looked towards
the door, but the object they &s;ought never met them.</P>
<P>When Sir Sedley entered, he joined the group of
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>Camilla tried to look at him and to &s;peak to him
with her cu&s;tomary civility and chearfulne&s;s, and nearly
&s;ucceeded; while in him &s;he ob&s;erved only an expre&s;&s;ive
attention, without any marks of pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Thus began and thus ended the evening. Edgar ne|ver
appeared.</P>
<P>Camilla was in the utmo&s;t amaze and deepe&s;t vexa|tion.
Why did he &s;tay away? was his wrath &s;o great
at her own failure the preceding night, that he purpo&s;ely
avoided her? what, al&s;o, could &s;he do with Sir Sed|ley?
how meet him the next morning without the draft
&s;he had now promi&s;ed?&endq;</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of extreme chagrin, when &s;he retired to
her chamber, &s;he found the following letter upon her
table:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold.</HEAD>
<P>CAN you think of &s;uch a trifle? or deem wealth &s;o
truly contemptible, as to deny it all honourable employ|ment?
Ah, rather, enchanting Camilla! deign further
to aid me in di&s;pen&s;ing it worthily!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>SEDLEY CLARENDEL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Camilla now was touched, penetrated, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
beyond what &s;he had been in any former time. She
<PB N="237" REF="38">
looked upon this letter as a po&s;itive intimation of the
mo&s;t &s;erious de&s;igns; and all his good qualities, as
painted by Mrs. Arlbery, with the very &s;ingular obliga|tion
&s;he owed to him, ro&s;e up formidably to &s;upport the
arguments and remon&s;trances of that lady; though every
feeling of her heart, every &s;entiment of her mind, and
every wi&s;h of her &s;oul, oppo&s;ed their &s;malle&s;t weight.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Helper.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, as Camilla had accompanied
Mrs. Berlinton, in earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, from her cham|ber
to the hall, &s;he heard the po&s;tman &s;ay Mi&s;s Tyrold
as he gave in a letter. She &s;eized it, &s;aw the hand|writing
of Lionel, and ran eagerly into the parlour,
which was empty, to read it, in &s;ome hopes it would at
lea&s;t contain an acknowledgment of the draft, that might
be &s;hewn to Sir Sedley, and relieve her from the pain
of continuing the principal in &s;uch an affair.</P>
<P>The letter, however, was merely a &s;portive rhap&s;ody,
beginning; <HI>My dear Lady Clarendel;</HI> de&s;iring her fa|vour
and protection, and telling her he had done what
he could for her honour, by adding two trophies to
the victorious car of Hymen, driven by the happy
Baronet.</P>
<P>Wholly at a lo&s;s how to act, &s;he &s;at ruminating over
this letter, till Mrs. Arlbery opened the door. Hav|ing
no time to fold it, and dreading her &s;eeing the fir&s;t
words, &s;he threw her handkerchief, which was then in
her hand, over it, upon the table, hoping pre&s;ently to
draw it away unperceived.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="39">
&startq;My dear friend,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;I am glad
to &s;ee you a moment alone. Do you know any thing
of Mandlebert?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No!&endq; an&s;wered &s;he affrighted, le&s;t any evil had hap|pened.</P>
<P>&startq;Did he not take leave of you at the rooms the other
night!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Leave of me? is he gone any where!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He has left Tunbridge.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla remained &s;tupified.</P>
<P>&startq;Left it,&endq; &s;he continued, &startq;without the poor civi|lity
to call, to a&s;k if you had any letters or me&s;&s;ages for
Hamp&s;hire&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla coloured high; &s;he felt to her heart this evi|dent
coldne&s;s, and &s;he knew it to be &s;till more marked
than $rs Arlbery could divine; for he was aware &s;he
wi&s;hed particularly to &s;peak with him; and though
&s;he had failed in her appointment, he had not inquired
why.</P>
<P>&startq;And this is the man for whom you would relinqui&s;h
all mankind? this is the grateful character who is to
render you in&s;en&s;ible to ever body?&endq;</P>
<P>The di&s;turbed mind of Camilla needed not this &s;peech;
her debt to Sir Sedley, ca&s;t wholly upon her&s;elf by the
thoughtle&s;s Lionel; her inability to pay it, the impre&s;|&s;ive
lines the Baronet had addre&s;&s;ed to her&punc; an the
cruel and pointed indifference of Edgar, all forcibly unit|ed
to make her wi&s;h, at this moment, her heart at her
own di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, the voice of Sir Sedley, gaily &s;ing|ing,
caught her ear. He was entering the hall, the
&s;treet door being open. She &s;tarted up; Mrs Arlbery
would have detained her, but &s;he could not endure to
encounter him, and without returning his &s;alutation, or
li&s;tening to his addre&s;s, cro&s;&s;ed him in the hall, and flew
up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>There, however, &s;he had &s;carcely taken breath, when
&s;he recollected the letter which &s;he had left upon the
table&punc; and which the afflicting intelligence that Edgar
had quitted Tunbridge, had made her forget &s;he had
received. In a terror immea&s;urable, le&s;t her handker|chief
<PB N="239" REF="40">
&s;hould be drawn a&s;ide, and betray the fir&s;t line,
&s;he re-de&s;cended the &s;tairs, and ha&s;tily entered the
room. Her &s;hock was then inexpre&s;&s;ible. The hand|kerchief,
which her own quick motion in retiring had
di&s;placed, was upon the floor, the letter was in full
view; the eyes of Sir Sedley were fixed upon his own
name, with a look indefinable between plea&s;ure and im|pertinence,
and Mrs. Arlbery was laughing with all her
might.</P>
<P>She &s;eized the letter, and was running away with it,
when Mrs. Arlbery &s;lipt out of the room&punc; and Sir Sed|ley,
&s;hutting the door, half archly half tenderly re|peated,
from the letter, &startq;My dear Lady Claren|del!&endq;</P>
<P>In a perfect agony, &s;he hid her face, exclaiming: &startq;O
Lionel! my fooli&s;h&mdash;cruel brother!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Not fooli&s;h not cruel, I think him,&endq; cried Sir Sed|ley,
taking her hand, &startq;but amiable&mdash;he has done ho|nour
to my name, and he will u&s;e it, I hope, henceforth,
as his own.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Forget, forget his flippancy,&endq; cried &s;he, withdraw|ing
impatiently her hand: &startq;and pardon his &s;i&s;ter's breach
of engagement for this morning. I hope &s;oon, very
&s;oon, to repair it, and I hope&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>She did not know what to add; &s;he &s;topt, &s;tammered,
and then endeavoured to make her retreat.</P>
<P>&startq;Do not go&punc;&endq; cried he, gently detaining her; &startq;in|comparable
Camilla! I have a thou&s;and things to &s;ay to
you. Will you not hear them?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No!&endq; cried &s;he, di&s;engaging her&s;elf; &startq;no, no,
no! I can hear nothing!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you fa&s;cinate then, &s;aid he, half reproachfully,
&startq;like the rattle&s;nake, only to de&s;troy?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla conceived this as alluding to her recent en|couragement,
and &s;tood trembling with expectation it
would be followed by a claim upon her ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But Sir Sedley, who was far from any meaning &s;o
pointed, lightly added, &startq;What thus agitates the faire&s;t
of creatures? can &s;he fear a poor captive entangled in
the witchery of her loveline&s;s, and only the more en|&s;laved
the more he &s;truggles to get free I&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="41">
&startq;Let me go,&endq; cried &s;he, eager to &s;top him; &startq;I be|&s;eech
you, Sir Sedley!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All beauteous Camilla!&endq; &s;aid he, retreating yet
&s;till &s;o as to intercept her pa&s;&s;age; &startq;I am bound to &s;ub|mit;
but when may I &s;ee you again?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At any time,&endq; replied &s;he ha&s;tily; &startq;only let me
pa&s;s now!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At any time! adorable Camilla! be it then to|night!
be it this evening!&mdash;be it at noon&mdash;be it&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, no, no!&endq; cried &s;he, panting with &s;hame and
alarm; &startq;I donot mean at any time! I &s;poke without
thought&mdash;I mean&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Speak &s;o ever and anon,&endq; cried he, &startq;if thought is
my enemy! This evening then&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topt, as if irre&s;olute how to fini&s;h his phra&s;e, but
&s;oon added: &startq;Adieu, till this evening, adieu!&endq; and
opened the door for her to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Triumph &s;at in his eye; exultation &s;poke in every
feature; yet his voice betrayed con&s;traint, and &s;eemed
checked, as if from fear of entru&s;ting it with his &s;en|timents.
The fear, however, was palpably not of diffi|dence
with re&s;pect to Camilla, but of indeci&s;ion with
regard to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Camilla, almo&s;t &s;inking with &s;hame now hung back,
from a dread of leaving him in this dangerous delu&s;ion.
She &s;at down, and in a faultering voice, &s;aid: &startq;Sir
Sedley! hear me, I beg!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hear you,&endq; cried he, gallantly ca&s;ting him&s;elf at her
feet; &startq;yes! from the fervid rays of the &s;un, to the
mild lu&s;tre of the moon!&mdash;from&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>A loud knock at the &s;treet door, and a ringing at
the &s;ame time at the bell, made him ri&s;e, meaning to
&s;hut again the door of the parlour; but he was pre|vented,
by the entrance of a man into the hall, calling
out, in a voice that reached to every part of the hou&s;e,
&startq;An expre&s;s for Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;tarted up, concluding it &s;ome &s;trange intelli|gence
concerning Edgar. But a letter was put into her
hand, and &s;he &s;aw it was the writing of Lavinia.</P>
<P>It was &s;hort, but mo&s;t affectionate. It told her that
news was ju&s;t arrived from the Continent, which gave

was a&s;&s;embling all the family to receive him. She was
then, with her father, going thither from Etherington,
where the re&s;tored health of her uncle had, for a week
pa&s;t, enabled them to re&s;ide, and &s;he was ordered to
&s;end off an expre&s;s to Tunbridge, to beg Camilla would
prepare immediately for the po&s;t-chai&s;e of Sir Hugh,
which would be &s;ent for her, with the Cleves hou&s;e|keeper,
and reach Mount Plea&s;ant within a few hours
after this notice.</P>
<P>A hundred que&s;tions a&s;&s;ailed Camilla when &s;he had
run over this letter, the noi&s;e of the expre&s;s having
brought Mrs. Arlbery and the Dennels into the par|lour.</P>
<P>She produced the letter, and putting it in the hands
of Mrs. Arlbery, relieved her painful confu&s;ion, by
quitting the room without again meeting the eyes of Sir
Sedley.</P>
<P>She could make no preparation, however, for her
journey, from mingled de&s;ire and fear of an explanation
with the Baronet before her departure.</P>
<P>Again&punc; therefore, in a few minutes &s;he went down;
gathering courage from the horror of a mi&s;take that might
lead to &s;o much mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>She found only $rs. Arlbery in the parlour.</P>
<P>Involuntarily &s;tarting, &startq;Where,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;is Sir
Sedley?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He is gone,&endq; an&s;wered Mrs. Arlbery, laughing at
her earne&s;tne&s;s; &startq;but no doubt you will &s;oon &s;ee him
at Cleves.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then I am undone!&endq; cried &s;he, bur&s;ting into tears
and running back to her chamber.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery in&s;tantly followed, and kindly inquired
what di&s;turbed her.</P>
<P>&startq;O, Mrs. Arlbery&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;lend me, I be&s;eech
you, &s;ome aid, and &s;pare me, in pity, your raillery!
Sir Sedley, I fear, greatly mi&s;takes me; &s;et him right, I
conjure you&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me&punc; my dear? and do you think if &s;ome happy fata|lity
is at work at this moment to force you to your good,
<PB N="242" REF="43">
I will come forth, like your evil genius, to counteract its
operations?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t write then,&mdash;yet, in this ha&s;te, this confu&s;ion,
I fear to involve rather than extricate my&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay, write by all means; there is nothing &s;o
prettily forwards the&s;e affairs, as a corre&s;pondence
between the parties undertaken to put an end to
them.&endq;</P>
<P>She went, laughing, out of the chamber, and Ca|milla,
who had &s;eized a pen, di&s;tre&s;sfully flung it from
her.</P>
<P>What indeed could &s;he &s;ay? he had made no direct
declaration; &s;he could give, therefore, no direct re|pul&s;e;
and though, through her brother's cruel want
of all con&s;ideration, &s;he was &s;o deeply in his debt, &s;he
dur&s;t no longer promi&s;e its di&s;charge; for the &s;trange
departure of Edgar robbed her of all courage to make
to him her meditated application.</P>
<P>Yet to leave Sir Sedley in this error was every way
terrible. If, which &s;till &s;eemed very po&s;&s;ible, from his
manner and behaviour, he &s;hould check his partiality,
and make the whole of what had pa&s;&s;ed end in mere
public-place gallantry, &s;he mu&s;t always have the mor|tification
to know he had con&s;idered her as ready to
accept him: If, on the contrary, encouraging what he
felt for her, from the belief &s;he returned his be&s;t opi|nion,
he &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly demand her hand&mdash;how could
&s;he ju&s;tify the apparent attention &s;he once paid him?
and how a&s;&s;ert, while &s;o hopele&s;sly his debtor, the inde|pendence
to reject one who &s;o many ways &s;eemed to
hold him&s;elf &s;ecure!</P>
<P>She was broken in upon by Mrs. Mittin, who en|tered
full of lamentation at the intelligence &s;he had ju&s;t
heard from Mi&s;s Dennel of her &s;udden departure;
which &s;he ended with, &startq;But as you are going in &s;uch
ha&s;te, my dear, you mu&s;t have fifty things to do, &s;o
pray now, let me help you. Come, what &s;hall I pack
up for you? Where's all your things?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="44">
Camilla, incapable of doing any bu&s;ine&s;s for her&s;elf,
accepted the offer.</P>
<P>&startq;Well then, now where's your gowns? Ble&s;s me!
what a one is here? why it's been in the dew, and then
in the du&s;t, and then in the dew again, till all the bot|tom
mu&s;t be cut off; why you can never &s;hew it among&s;t
your friends; it will quite bring a di&s;grace upon poor
Tunbridge; come, I think you mu&s;t give it to me;
I've got a piece of mu&s;&s;in ju&s;t like it, and I can piece
it &s;o that it won't appear; but it will never do for you
again.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was &s;urpri&s;ed; but her mind was filled with
other matters, and the gown was put apart.</P>
<P>&startq;What! are tho&s;e all your neck handkerchiefs?
why, my dear Mi&s;s Tyrold, that's a thing you want
very bad indeed; why here's one you can never wear
again; it wants more darning than it's worth.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;aid &s;he &s;hould have very good time to mend
it at home.</P>
<P>&startq;But then, my dear, you don't con&s;ider what a bad
look that will have among&s;t your friends; what will
they think of poor Tunbridge, that you &s;hould have let
it go &s;o far? why, may be they'll never let you
come again; the be&s;t way will be not to let them &s;ee it;
&s;uppo&s;e I take it off your hands? I dare &s;ay they don't
know your count.&endq;</P>
<P>At any other time, Camilla would either have re&s;i&s;t|ed
the&s;e &s;eizures, or have been diverted by the pretence
that they were made only for her own benefit; but &s;he
was now glad at any rate to get rid of the care of the
package.</P>
<P>When this was over, and Mrs. Mittin had pretty
well paid her&s;elf for her trouble: &startq;Well, my dear,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;and what can I do for you next? Have
you paid Mrs. Tilldin, and Mr. Dou&s;t, and Mr.
Tent?&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e were que&s;tions that indeed rou&s;ed Camilla
from her reverie? &s;he had not once thought of what &s;he
owed to the milliner, to her &s;hoemaker, nor to her ha|berda&s;her;
from all of whom &s;he had now, through the
hands of Mrs. Mittin, had various articles. She thank|ed
<PB N="244" REF="45">
her for reminding her of &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an attention, and
&s;aid &s;he would immediately &s;end for the bills.</P>
<P>&startq;I'll run and pay 'em for you my&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid Mrs.
Mittin: &startq;for they always take that kind; and as I re|commended
them all to you, I have a right they &s;hould
know how I &s;tand their friend; for there's many an
odd &s;ervice they may do me in return; &s;o I'll go for
you with all my heart; only give me the money.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla took out her pur&s;e, in which, from her debt
to Sir Sedley, and perpetually current expences, there
now remained but fifteen &s;hillings of her borrowed five
guineas; though latterly, &s;he had wholly denied her|&s;elf
whatever did not &s;eem an expence unavoidable.
What to do &s;he now knew not; for though all &s;he had
ordered had been trifling, &s;he was &s;ure it mu&s;t amount
to four or five guineas. She had repeatedly refu&s;ed
to borrow any thing more of Mrs. Arlbery, always
hoping every call for money would be the la&s;t; but &s;he
was too inexperienced to know, that in gay circles, and
public places, the demands for wealth are endle&s;s and
countle&s;s; and that oeconomy it&s;elf, which is always lo|cal,
is there lavi&s;h and extravagant, compared with its
character, in private &s;cenes and retired life.</P>
<P>Yet was this the la&s;t moment to apply to Mrs. Arl|bury
upon &s;uch a &s;ubject, &s;ince it would be endowing
her with fre&s;h arms to fight the cau&s;e of Sir Sedley. She
&s;at &s;till, and ruminating, till Mrs. Mittin, who with|out
&s;cruple had taken a full inventory of the contents
of the pur&s;e, exclaimed: &startq;La! my dear, why &s;ure I
hope that i'n't all you've got left?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was fain to confe&s;s &s;he had nothing more at
Tunbridge.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, don't be unea&s;y, my dear,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;and
I'll go to 'em all, and be caution for you, till you get the
money.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla thanked her very &s;incerely, and again re&s;um|ed
her fir&s;t opinion of her real good nature, and kind|ne&s;s
of heart. She took her direction in London,
whither &s;he was &s;oon to return, and promi&s;ed, in a
&s;hort time, to tran&s;mit the money for her to di&s;tribute,
<PB N="245" REF="46">
as every one of the &s;hop-keepers went to the metropo|lis
in the winter.</P>
<P>Delighted both with the prai&s;e and the commi&s;&s;ion,
Mrs. Mirtin took leave; and Camilla determined to
employ her next quarter's allowance in paying the&s;e
debts, and frankly to beg from her uncle the five guineas
that were due to Mrs Arlbery.</P>
<P>She then wrote an affectionate adieu to Mrs. Ber|linton,
intreating to hear from her at Etherington;
and, while &s;he was &s;ealing it. Mrs Arlbery came to
embrace her, as the carriage was at the door.</P>
<P>Camilla, in making her acknowledgments for the
kindne&s;s &s;he had received, intermingled a petition, that
at lea&s;t, &s;he would not augment, if &s;he refu&s;ed to clear
the mi&s;take of Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>&startq;I believe be may &s;afely,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;be left
to him&s;elf; though it is plain that, at this moment, he
is in a difficulty as great as your own; for marriage he
&s;till re&s;i&s;ts, though he finds you re&s;i&s;tle&s;s. I wi&s;h you
mutually to be parted till&mdash;pardon me, my fair friend&mdash;
your under&s;tandings are mutually cleared, and he is
dive&s;ted of what is too factitious, and you of what is too
artle&s;s. Your &s;ituation is, indeed rather whim&s;ical;
for the two mortals with whom you have to deal require
treatment diametrically oppo&s;ite; yet humour them a
little adroitly, and you pre&s;ently gain them both. He
that is proud, mu&s;t be di&s;tanced; he that is vain, mu&s;t
be flattered. This is paying them with their own coin;
but they hold no other to be current. Pride, if not
humbled, degenerates into contempt; vanity, if not in|dulged,
di&s;&s;olves into indifference.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla di&s;claimed taking any mea&s;ures with re&s;pect
to either; but Mrs. Arlbery in&s;i&s;ted the field would be
won by Sir Sedley, &startq;who is already,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;per&s;uaded you have for &s;ome time encouraged him,
and that now you are fully propitious&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla ha&s;tily interrupted her: &startq;O, Mrs. Arl|bery!&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;I cannot endure this! add
not to my di&s;turbance by making it my own
work!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="47">
She then embraced her; took leave of the Dennels,
and with the hou&s;e keeper of Sir Hugh &s;et out from
Tunbridge for Cleves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The right Style of Arguing.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA was received with the mo&s;t tender joy by
all her family, again re-a&s;&s;embled at Cleves to welcome
the return of young Lynmere, who was expected every
hour. Sir Hugh, perfectly recovered from his late ill|ne&s;s,
and bu&s;y, notwith&s;tanding all remon&s;trance, in
preparation for the approaching nuptials, was in &s;pirits
that exhilarated whoever &s;aw him. Eugenia awaited
that event with gentlene&s;s, though with varying &s;en&s;a|tions;
from fears, le&s;t her per&s;onal misfortunes &s;hould
prove repul&s;ive to Clermont, and from wi&s;hes to find
him re&s;embling Melmond in talents, and Bellamy in
pa&s;&s;ion and con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne gave now his le&s;&s;ons with redoubled
a&s;&s;iduity, from an ambition to produce to the &s;chola&s;tic
traveller, a phenomenon of his own workman&s;hip in a
learned young female: nor were his toils le&s;s ready,
nor le&s;s plea&s;ant, for a &s;ecret &s;urmi&s;e they would &s;hortly
end; though not till honour &s;hould be united with in|dependence,
for his recompence. But Mi&s;s Margland
fretted, that this wedding would advance no London
journey; and Indiana could not for a moment recover
from her indignation, that the deformed and ugly Eu|genia,
though two years younger than her&s;elf, &s;hould
be married before her. Lavinia had no thought but for
the happine&s;s of her &s;i&s;ter; and Mr. Tyrold lamented
the ab&s;ence of his wife, who, alike from under&s;tanding
<PB N="247" REF="48">
and affection, was the only per&s;on to properly &s;uperin|tend
this affair, but from whom Dr. Marchmont, ju&s;t
arrived, brought very faint hopes of a &s;peedy return.</P>
<P>Eugenia, however, was not the &s;ole care of her fa|ther,
at this period. The countenance of Camilla &s;oon
betrayed, to his inquiring eyes, the inefficacy of the
Tunbridge journey. But he forbore all que&s;tion; and
left to time or her choice to unravel, if new incidents
kept alive her inquietude, or, if no incident at all had
been equally prejudicial to her repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Two days after, while Camilla, &s;till a&s;toni&s;hed by no
news, nor &s;ight of Edgar, was &s;itting with her &s;i&s;ters,
and recounting to them her late adventures, and pre&s;ent
difficulties, with Sir Sedley Clarendel, Jacob brought
her, in its own &s;uperb bird-cage, the learned little bull|finch;
telling her, it had been delivered to him without
any me&s;&s;age, by a man who &s;aid &s;he had left it, by mi&s;|take,
at $ unbridge, whence he had had orders to fol|low
her with it to Cleves park.</P>
<P>She was much provoked thus to receive it. Mrs.
Arlbery had pre&s;&s;ed her to take it in her uncle's chai&s;e,
which &s;he had firmly refu&s;ed; and &s;he now concluded
this method was adopted, that Sir Sedley might ima|gine
&s;he detained it as his gift.</P>
<P>In drawing out, &s;oon after, the receptacle for the
bird's nouri&s;hment, &s;he perceived, written with a pencil
upon the wood, the&s;e words: &startq;Thou art gone then,
fair fugitive! Ah! at lea&s;t, fly only where thou may&s;t
be pur&s;ued!&endq;</P>
<P>This writing had not been vi&s;ible till the machine was
taken out to be repleni&s;hed. She recollected the hand
of Sir Sedley, and was now &s;ure it was &s;ent by him|&s;elf,
and could no longer, therefore, doubt his intenti|ons
being &s;erious.</P>
<P>With infinite perplexity &s;he con&s;ulted with her &s;i&s;|ters;
but, when candidly &s;he had related, that once, to
her never-ending regret, &s;he had apparently welcomed
his civilities, Eugenia pronounced her rectitude to be
engaged by that error, as &s;trongly as her gratitude by
<PB N="248" REF="49">
the pre&s;ervation of her life, and the extraordinary &s;er|vice
done to Lionel, not to reject the young baronet,
&s;hould he make his propo&s;als.</P>
<P>She heard this opinion with horror. Timid &s;hame,
and the coun&s;el of her father, united to impede her
naming the internal ob&s;tacles which &s;he felt to be in&s;ur|mountable:
and, while ca&s;ting up, in &s;ilence, her ap|pealing
eyes to Heaven, for relief, from the intricacy
in which &s;he found her&s;elf involved, &s;he &s;aw Lionel gal|loping
into the park.</P>
<P>She flew to meet him, and he di&s;mounted, and led
his h$r&s;e, to walk with her</P>
<P>She flattered her&s;elf, &s;he might now repre&s;ent$ the
mi&s;chief he was doing, and obtain from him &s;ome re|dre&s;s.
But he was more wild and impracticable than
ever. &startq;Well&punc; my dear girl,' he cried, &startq;when are
all the&s;e betterings and wor&s;ings to take place? Numps
has &s;ent for me to &s;ee poor little Greek and Latin hob|ble
to the altar; but 'tis a million to one, if our noble
baronet does not wi&s;k you there before her. He's a
charming fellow, faith. I had a good long confab with
him this morning.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This morning? I hope, then, you were &s;o good,
&s;o ju&s;t, as to tell him when you mean to pay the money
you have borrowed?</P>
<P>&startq;My dear child, I often think you were born but
ye&s;terday, only, by &s;ome accident, you came into the
world, like Minerva, grown up and ready dre&s;&s;ed.
What makes you think I mean to pay him? Have I
given him any bond?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A bond? Is that nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tice and ho|nour?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If I had a&s;ked the money, you are right, my dear;
I ought, then, certainly, to refund. But, as it now
&s;tands, 'tis his own affair. I have nothing to do with
it: except, indeed, receiving the dear little golden
boys, and making merry with them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O fie, Lionel, fie!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, what had I to do with it? Do you think he
would care one &s;ig if he &s;aw me &s;unk to the bottom of
the Red Sea? No, my dear, no; you are the little deb|tor;
<PB N="249" REF="50">
&s;o balance your accounts for your&s;elf, and don't
ca&s;t them upon your poor neighbours, who have full
enough to &s;ettle of their own.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was thunder&s;truck; &startq;And have you been
&s;o cruel,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;&s;eeing the matter in &s;uch a light,
to place me in &s;uch a predicament?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Cruel, my dear girl? why, what will it co&s;t you,
except a dimple or two the more? And don't you know
you always look be&s;t when you &s;mile? I a&s;&s;ure you, it's
a mercy he don't &s;ee you when you are giving me one
of my lectures. It disfigures you &s;o horribly, that he'd
take fright and never &s;peak to you again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What can I ever &s;ay, to make you hear me, or
feel for me? Tell me, at lea&s;t, what has pa&s;&s;ed this
morning; and a&s;&s;ure me that nothing new, nothing yet
wor&s;e, has occurred.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O no, nothing at all. All is in the faire&s;t train
po&s;&s;ible. I dare &s;ay, he'll come hither, upon the grand
que&s;tion, before &s;un-&s;et.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla ga&s;ped for breath, and was &s;ome time before
&s;he could a&s;k whence he drew &s;uch a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;O, becau&s;e I &s;ee he's in for it. I have a pretty
good eye, my dear! He &s;aid, too&punc; he had &s;uch a pro|digious&mdash;
friend&s;hip, I think he called it, for you, that
he was immea&s;urably happy, and all that, to be of the
lea&s;t &s;ervice to your brother. A fine fellow, upon my
word! a fine generous &s;park as ever I &s;aw. He charg|ed
me to call upon him freely when I had any little em|barra&s;&s;ment,
or difficulty, or was hard run, or things
of that &s;ort. He's a fine buck, I tell you, and knows
the world perfectly, that I promi&s;e you. He's none of
your drivellers, none of your ignoramu&s;es. He has
the true notion of things. He's ju&s;t a right friend for
me. You could not have made a better match.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, prote&s;ted her|&s;elf
di&s;engaged in thought, word, and deed; and de|clared
her fixed intention &s;o to continue. But he only
laughed at her declarations, calling them maidenly fibs;
and, a&s;&s;uring her, the young baronet was &s;o much in
earne&s;t, &s;he might as well be &s;incere as not. &startq;Be|&s;ides,&endq;
he added, &startq;'tis not fair to trifle where a man
<PB N="250" REF="51">
behaves &s;o hand&s;omely and honourably. Con&s;ider the
&pound;. 200!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall quite lo&s;e my &s;en&s;es, Lionel!&endq; cried &s;he,
in an agony; &startq;I &s;hall quite lo&s;e my &s;en&s;es if you &s;peak
in this manner.&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel &s;houted aloud; &startq;Why, my dear girl, what
is &pound;. 200 to Sir Sedley Clarendel? You talk as if he
had twenty pounds a-year for pin-money, like you and
Lavinia, that might go with half a gown a-year, if
good old Numps did not help you. Why, he's as rich
as Croo&s;us, child. Be&s;ides, he would have been quite
affronted if I had talked of paying him &s;uch a trifle, for
he offered me any thing I plea&s;ed. O, he knows the
world, I promi&s;e you! He's none of your &s;tarched
prigs. He knows life, my dear! He &s;aid, he could
perfectly conceive how hard it mu&s;t be to a lad of &s;pi|rit,
like me, to be always exact. I don't know that I
ever made a more agreeable acquaintance in my life.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was in an agitation that made him regard
her, for a moment, with a &s;erious &s;urpri&s;e; but his na|tural
levity &s;oon re&s;umed its po&s;t, and, laughing at him|&s;elf
for being nearly, he &s;aid, taken in, by her childi&s;h
freaks, he prote&s;ted he would bite no more: &startq;For,
after all, you mu&s;t not think to make a fool of me, my
dear. It won't do. I'm too knowing. Do you &s;up|po&s;e,
if he had not already made up his mind to the
noo&s;e, and was not &s;ure you had made up yours to let|ting
it be tied, he would have cared for poor me, and
my &s;crapes? No, no; whatever he does for me, before
you are married, you may &s;et down in your own me|morandum
book: whatever he may plea&s;e to do after|wards,
I am content &s;hould be charged to poor Pill|garlic.&endq;</P>
<P>He then bid her good-morrow, by the name of Lady
Clarendel; and &s;aid, he would go and &s;ee if little Greek
and Latin were as prepoiterous a prude about young
Lynmere.</P>
<P>Camilla remained almo&s;t petrified with amazement at
her own &s;ituation; and only was deterred from imme|diately
opening her whole heart and affairs to her father,
with the confidence to which his indulgence entitled
<PB N="251" REF="52">
him, by the impo&s;&s;ibility of explaining her full di&s;tre&s;s
without betraying her brother.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Council.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning, Camilla, eager to try once more
her influence with her brother, accompanied him into
the park, and renewed her remon&s;trances, but with no
better &s;ucce&s;s; and while they were pa&s;&s;ing by a private
gate, that opened to the high road, they &s;aw Sir Sedley
Clarendel driving by in his phaeton.</P>
<P>Lionel, bur&s;ting from his &s;i&s;ter, opened the gate,
called to Sir Sedley to give his reins to one of his &s;er|vants,
and brought him, not unwilling, though much
&s;urpri&s;ed, into the park.</P>
<P>Camilla, in di&s;may un&s;peakable at this conduct, and
the idea of &s;uch a meeting, had run forward in&s;tantly to
hide her&s;elf in the &s;ummer hou&s;e, to avoid re-pa&s;&s;ing the
gate in her way to the man&s;ion; but her &s;cheme was
more precipitate than wi&s;e; Lionel caught a glimp&s;e
of her gown as &s;he went into the little building, and
&s;houted aloud: &startq;Look! look! Sir Sedley! there's
Camilla making believe to run away from you!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, fair fugitive!&endq; cried the Baronet &s;pringing
forward and entering the &s;ummer-hou&s;e almo&s;t as &s;oon
as her&s;elf, &startq;fly only thus, where you may be pur&s;ued!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla utterly confounded, knew not where to ca&s;t
her eyes, where to hide her face; and her quick-chang|ing
colour, and &s;hort-heaved breath, manife&s;ted an ex|ce&s;s
of confu&s;ion, that touched, flattered, and pene|trated
the baronet &s;o deeply and &s;o &s;uddenly, as to put
him off from all guard of con&s;equences, and all recol|lection
<PB N="252" REF="53">
of matrimonial di&s;ta&s;te: &startq;Beautiful, re&s;i&s;tle&s;s
Camilla!&endq; he cried; &startq;how vain is it to&s;truggle again&s;t
your witchery! A&s;&s;ure me but of your clemency, and
I will adore the chains that &s;hackle me!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, wholly overcome, by &s;orrow, gratitude, re|pentance,
and &s;hame, &s;unk upon a chair, and &s;hed a tor|rent
of tears that &s;he even &s;ought not to re&s;train. The
&s;hock of refu&s;ing one to who&s;e error in believing him&s;elf
acceptable &s;he had largely contributed, or the horror of
yielding to him her hand, while her heart was in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another, made her almo&s;t wi&s;h, at this mo|ment,
he &s;hould divine her di&s;tre&s;s, that his own pride
might conclude it.</P>
<P>But far different from what would produce &s;uch an
effect, were the feelings of pride now working in his
bo&s;om. He imagined her emotion had its fource in
cau&s;es the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t flattering Every per&s;onal
ob&s;tacle &s;unk before this idea, and with a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s
in his manner he had not yet u&s;ed: &startq;This evening,
lovely Camilla,&endq; he cried, &startq;let me beg for this even|ing,
the audience accorded me upon that which I lo&s;t at
Tunbridge.&endq;</P>
<P>He was then going; but Camilla, ha&s;tily ri&s;ing,
cried, &startq;Sir Sedley, I be&s;eech&mdash;&endq; when Lionel caper|ing
into the little apartment, danced round it in mad
ec&s;ta&s;y, chanting, &startq;Lady Clarendel, Lady Clarendel,
my dear Lady Clarendel!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now was not confu&s;ed alone. Sir Sedley
him&s;elf could gladly have pu&s;hed him out of the build|ing;
but neither the looks of &s;urpri&s;e and provocation
of the Baronet, nor the prayers nor reprimands of Ca|milla,
could tame his wild tran&s;port. He &s;hook hands,
whether he would or not, with the one; he bowed mo&s;t
ob&s;equiou&s;ly, whether &s;he would regard him or not, to
the other; and &s;till chanting the &s;ame burden, made
a clamour that &s;hook the little edifice to its foundation.</P>
<P>The &s;trong ta&s;te for ridicule, that was a prominent
part of the character of Sir Sedley, was &s;oon conquered
by this ludicrous behaviour, and both his amazement
and di&s;plea&s;ure ended in a hearty &s;it of laughter. But
Camilla &s;uffered too &s;everely to join in the mirth; &s;he
<PB N="253" REF="54">
blu&s;hed for her brother, &s;he blu&s;hed for her&s;elf, &s;he hung
her head in &s;peechle&s;s &s;hame, and covered her eyes
with her hand.</P>
<P>The noi&s;y merriment of Lionel preventing any ex|planation,
though rendering it every moment more ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
Sir Sedley, repeating his reque&s;t for the even|ing,
took leave.</P>
<P>Camilla looked upon his departing in this manner
as her &s;entence to mi&s;ery, and was pur&s;uing him, to
decline the vi&s;it; but Lionel, &s;eizing her two hands,
&s;wung her round the room, in defiance of her even an|gry
expo&s;tulations and &s;ufferings, which he neither
credited nor conceived, and then &s;kipt after the baronet
him&s;elf, who was already out of the park.</P>
<P>She became now nearly frantic. She thought her|&s;elf
irretrievably in the power of Sir Sedley, and by
means &s;o forced and indelicate, that &s;he was &s;carcely
more afflicted at the event, than &s;hocked by its circum|&s;tances;
and though incapable to really harbour ran|cour
again&s;t a brother &s;he &s;incerely loved, &s;he yet be|lieved
at this moment &s;he never &s;hould forgive, nor will|ingly
&s;ee him more.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate &s;he was found by Lavinia. The hi&s;|tory
was inarticulately told, but Lavinia could give only
her pity; &s;he &s;aw not any avenue to an honourable re|treat,
and thought, like Eugenia, &s;he could now only
free her&s;elf by the breach of what &s;hould be dearer
to her even than happine&s;s, her probity and honour.</P>
<P>Utterly incon&s;olable &s;he remained, till again &s;he
heard the voice of Lionel, loudly &s;inging in the park.</P>
<P>&startq;Go to him! go to him! my deare&s;t Lavinia,&endq; &s;he
cried, &startq;and, if my peace is dear to you, prevail with
him to clear up the mi&s;takes of Sir Sedley, and to pre|vent
his dreaded, killing vi&s;it this evening!&endq;</P>
<P>Lavinia only an&s;wered by compliance; but, after
an half hour's u&s;ele&s;s conte&s;t with her riotous brother,
returned to her weeping &s;i&s;ter, not merely &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s
with regard to her petition, but loaded with fre&s;h ill
tidings that &s;he knew not how to impart. Lionel had
only laughed at the repugnance of Camilla, which he
regarded as &s;omething between childi&s;hne&s;s and af|fectation,
<PB N="254" REF="55">
and begged Lavinia to be wi&s;er than to heed to
it: &startq;Brother Sedley has de&s;ired me, however,&endq; he
added, &startq;not to &s;peak of the matter to Numps nor my
father, till he has had a little more conver&s;ation with
his charmer; and he intends to call to-night as if only
upon a vi&s;it to me.&endq;</P>
<P>When Camilla learnt, at length, this painful end
of her emba&s;&s;y, &s;he gave her&s;elf up &s;o completely to
de&s;pair, that Lavinia affrighted, ran to the hou&s;e for
Eugenia, who&s;e extreme youth was no impediment in
the minds of her liberal &s;i&s;ters, to their belief nor re|verence
of her &s;uperior wi&s;dom. Her &s;pecies of edu|cation
had early prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them with re&s;pect for her
knowledge, and her unaffected fondne&s;s for &s;tudy,
had fixed their opinion of her extraordinary under|&s;tanding.
The goodne&s;s of her heart, the evenne&s;s of
her temper, and her natural turn to contemplation, had
e&s;tabli&s;hed her character alike for &s;anctity and for phi|lo&s;ophy
throughout the family.</P>
<P>She li&s;tened with the &s;incere&s;t commi&s;eration to the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of the ca&s;e: &startq;Certainly,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;you
cannot in honour, now refu&s;e him; but deal with him
&s;incerely, and he may generou&s;ly him&s;elf relinqui&s;h his
claims. Write to him, my dear Camilla; tell him you
grieve to afflict, yet di&s;dain to deceive him; a&s;&s;ure
him of your perfect e&s;teem and eternal gratitude; but
confe&s;s, at once, your heart refu&s;es to return his ten|derne&s;s.
Entreat him to forgive whatever he may
have mi&s;taken, and nobly to re&s;tore to you the liberty of
which your obligations, without his con&s;ent mu&s;t rob
you.&endq;</P>
<P>To Lavinia this advice appeared infallible; but Ca|milla,
though &s;he felt an entanglement which fettered
her&s;elf, thought it by no means &s;ufficiently direct or
clear to authori&s;e a rejection of Sir Sedley; &s;ince,
&s;trangely as &s;he &s;eemed in his power, circum&s;tances
had placed her there, and not his own &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>Yet to prevent a vi&s;it of which her knowledge &s;eemed
con&s;ent, and which her con&s;ent mu&s;t be mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly
to authori&s;e, &s;he deemed as indi&s;pen&s;able to her charac|ter,
as to her fears. She he&s;itated therefore not a mo|ment
<PB N="255" REF="56">
in preferring writing to a meeting; and after va|rious
conver&s;ations, and various e&s;&s;ays, the following
billet was di&s;patched to Clarendel Place, through
the means of Molly Mill, and by her friend Tommy
Hodd.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir Sedley Clarendel.</HEAD>
<P>I SHOULD ill return what I owe to Sir Sedley Cla|rendel
by cau&s;ing him any u&s;ele&s;s trouble I can &s;pare
him. He &s;poke of a vi&s;it hither this evening, when I
was too much hurried to repre&s;ent that it could not be
received, as my brother's re&s;idence is at Ethrington, and
my father and my uncle have not the honour to be
known to Sir Sedley. For me, my gratitude mu&s;t
ever be unalterable; and where accident occa&s;ions a
meeting, I &s;hall be mo&s;t happy to expre&s;s it; but I
have nothing to &s;ay, nothing to offer, that could re|compen&s;e
one moment of Sir Sedley's time given vo|luntarily
to &s;uch a vi&s;it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Ill as this letter &s;atisfied her, &s;he could devi&s;e nothing
better; but though her &s;i&s;ters had both thought it too
rigorous, &s;he would not ri&s;k any thing gentler.</P>
<P>During the dinner, they all appeared ab&s;ent and de|jected;
but Sir Hugh attributed it to the non-arrival
of Clermont in watching for whom his own time was
completely occupied, by examining two weather-cocks,
and walking from one to the other, to &s;ee if they
agreed, or how they changed; Indiana was wholly en|gro&s;&s;ed
in con&s;ultations with Mi&s;s Margland, upon the
mo&s;t becoming dre&s;s for a bride's maid; and Mr.
Tyrold having ob&s;erved that his three girls had &s;pent
the morning together, concluded Camilla had divulged
to them her unhappy perplexity, and felt &s;oothed him|&s;elf
in con&s;idering &s;he had &s;oothers &s;o affectionate and
faithful.</P>
<P>Early in the evening Tommy Hodd arrived, and
Molly Mill brought Camilla the following an&s;wer of
Sir Sedley.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>AH! what in this lower &s;phere can be unchequered,

</LETTER>
<P>Camilla turned cold. She &s;hrunk from a remon|&s;trance
&s;he conceived &s;he had merited, and regarded
her&s;elf to be henceforth either culpable or unhappy.
Unacquainted with the feminine indulgence which the
world by long pre&s;cription, grants to coquetry, its
name was &s;carcely known to her; and &s;he &s;aw in its
own native egoti&s;m the ungenerous de&s;ire to plea&s;e,
where &s;he her&s;elf was indifferent, and anticipated from
Sir Sedley reproach, if not contempt. No &s;ophi&s;tica|tions
of cu&s;tom had warped the fir&s;t innocence of her
innate &s;en&s;e of right, and to trifle with the feelings of
another for any gratification of her own, made &s;ucce&s;s
bring a blu&s;h to her integrity, not exultation to her va|nity.</P>
<P>The words <HI>victim</HI> and <HI>bleeding,</HI> much affected the ten|der
Lavinia, while tho&s;e of <HI>fetters, captive,</HI> and <HI>in&s;en&s;ible,</HI>
&s;atisfied the herioc Eugenia that Sir Sedley de&s;erved
the hand of her &s;i&s;ter; but neither of them &s;poke.</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;ay nothing?&endq; cried Camilla turning paler and
paler, and &s;itting down le&s;t &s;he &s;hould fall.</P>
<P>They both wept and embraced her, and Eugenia
&s;aid, if, indeed, &s;he could not conquer her aver&s;ion,
&s;he &s;aw no way to elude the baronet, but by openly
confe&s;&s;ing her repugnance, in the conver&s;ation he de|manded.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;aw not le&s;s &s;trongly the nece&s;&s;ity of being
both prompt and explicit; but how receive Sir Sedley
<PB N="257" REF="58">
at Cleves? and upon what pretence conver&s;e with him
privately? Even Lionel the next day was to return to
the univer&s;ity, though his pre&s;ence if he &s;taid, would,
in all probability but add to every difficulty.</P>
<P>At length, they decided, that the conference &s;hould
take place at the Grove; and to prevent the threatened
vi&s;it of the next day, Camilla wrote the following an|&s;wer:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Sir Sedley Clarendel.</HEAD>
<P>I SHOULD be grieved, indeed, to return my obliga|tions
to Sir Sedley Clarendel by meriting his &s;erious
reproach; yet I cannot have the honour of &s;eeing him
at Cleves, &s;ince my brother is immediately quitting it
for Oxford. As &s;oon as I hear Mrs. Arlbery is again
at the Grove, I &s;hall wait upon her, and always be
mo&s;t happy to a&s;&s;ure Sir Sedley of my gratitude,
which will be as la&s;ting as it is &s;incere.</P>

<P>Though wretched in this &s;trange &s;tate of things, &s;he
knew not how to word her letter more po&s;itively, &s;ince
his own, notwith&s;tanding its inferences, had &s;o much
more the &s;tyle of florid gallantry than plain truth.
Molly Mill undertook that Tommy Hodd &s;hould carry
it early the next morning.</P>
<P>Lionel was &s;o enraged at the non-appearance of the
young baronet at night, that Camilla was compelled to
confe&s;s &s;he had promi&s;ed to &s;ee him, and to give him
his an&s;wer at Mrs. Arlbery's. He was out of humour,
neverthale&s;s, le&s;t Sir Sedley &s;hould be affronted by the
delay, and feared that the be&s;t match in the whole
county would prove abortive, from his &s;i&s;ter's fooli&s;h

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Propo&s;al of Marriage.</HEAD>
<P>THE increa&s;ing depre&s;&s;ion of Camilla, and the me|lancholy
of her &s;ympathi&s;ing &s;i&s;ters, though &s;till attri|buted
to the adver&s;e wind by the compa&s;s-watching ba|ronet,
e&s;caped not the notice of Mr. Tyrold; who,
alarmed for the peace of his daughter, determined to
watch for the fir&s;t quiet opportunity of inve&s;tigating her
actual &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Lionel, after breakfa&s;t, the next morning, was obli|ged
to relinqui&s;h waiting for Clermont, and to &s;et off
for Oxford. He contrived to whi&s;per to Camilla, that
he hoped &s;he would be a good girl at la&s;t, and not play
the fool; but, finding &s;he only &s;ighed, he laughed at
her calamitous &s;tate, in becoming mi&s;tre&s;s of fifteen
thou&s;and per annum, only by the &s;mall trouble of run|ning
over a &s;hort ceremony; and, a&s;&s;uring her he
would a&s;&s;i&s;t her off with part of the charge, if it were
too heavy for her, bid her inform him in time of the
propitious day.</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;hortly after, &s;aw from her window, gal|lopping
full &s;peed acro&s;s the park to the hou&s;e, Major
Cerwood. She &s;u&s;pected her tormenting brother to
have been again at work; nor was &s;he mi&s;taken. He
had met with the Major at the hotel at Tunbridge,
while his &s;pirits, always violent, were in a &s;tate of al|mo&s;t
intoxication of delight, at the fir&s;t idea of &s;uch
an acce&s;&s;ion to his powers of amu&s;ement, as a new bro|ther
rolling in immen&s;e wealth, which he already con|&s;idered
as nearly at his own di&s;po&s;al. High wrought,
therefore, for what he deemed good &s;port, he confirm|ed
what he had a&s;&s;erted at the ball at Northwick, of
the expectations of Camilla from Sir Hugh, by relat|ing
the public fact, of her having been announced, to
<PB N="259" REF="60">
the family and neighbourhood, for his uncle's heire&s;s,
at ten years of age; and only &s;inking, in his account,
the revocation made &s;o &s;oon after in favour of Eu|genia.
To this, he added his advice, that no time was
to be lo&s;t, as numberle&s;s new &s;uitors were likely to
pur&s;ue her from Tunbridge.</P>
<P>The Major, upon alighting, inquired for Sir Hugh,
deeming Mr. Tyrold of little con&s;equence, &s;ince it
was not from him Camilla was to inherit her fortune.</P>
<P>The baronet, as u&s;ual, was watching the winds and
the clouds; but, concluding whoever came would bring
&s;ome news from Clermont, received the Major with
the utmo&s;t cordiality, &s;aying: &startq;I &s;ee, &s;ir, you are a
&s;tranger; by which I &s;uppo&s;e you to be ju&s;t come from
abroad; where, I hope you left all well?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am ju&s;t come, &s;ir,&endq; an&s;wered the Major, &startq;from
Tunbridge, where I had the honour, through my ac|quaintance
with Mrs. Arlbery, of meeting daily
with your charming niece; an honour, fir, which
mu&s;t cau&s;e all the future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of my
life.&endq;</P>
<P>He then made a declaration, in form, of the mo&s;t
ardent pa&s;&s;ion for Camilla; mentioned his family, which
was an honourable one; talked of his expectations with
confidence, though vaguely; and de&s;ired to leave the
di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ettlement wholly to the Baronet;
who he hoped, would not refu&s;e to &s;ee his elder bro|ther,
a gentleman of fortune in Lincoln&s;hire, who
would have the honour to wait upon him at any time he
would be &s;o good as to appoint, upon this momentous
affair.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh heard this harangue with con&s;ternation.
The Major was in the prime of life, his per&s;on was
good, his &s;peech was florid, his air was a&s;&s;ured, and
his regimentals were gay. Not a doubt of his &s;ucce&s;s
occurred to the Baronet; who &s;aw, in one blow, the
darling &s;cheme of his old age demoli&s;hed in the depriva|tion
of Camilla.</P>
<P>The Major impatiently waited for an an&s;wer; but
Sir Hugh was too much di&s;ordered to frame one; he
walked up and down the room, muttering, in a de|&s;ponding
<PB N="260" REF="61">
manner, to him&s;elf, &startq;Lord, help us! what
a &s;et of poor weak mortals we are, we poor men! The
be&s;t &s;chemes and plans in the world always coming to
nothing before we can bring them about! I'll never
form another while I live, for the &s;ake of this one
warning. Nobody knows, next, but what Clermont
will be carrying off Eugenia to &s;ee foreign parts! and
then comes &s;ome other of the&s;e red-coats to take away
Indiana; and, after doing all for the be&s;t &s;o long, I
may be left all alone, except ju&s;t for Mrs. Margland and
the Doctor! that I don't take much plea&s;ure in, Lord
help me! except as a Chri&s;tian, which I hope is no
&s;in.&endq;</P>
<P>At length endeavouring to compo&s;e him&s;elf, he &s;at
down, and &s;aid, &startq;So you are come, &s;ir, to take away
from me my own particular little niece? which is a
hard thing upon an uncle, intending her to live with
him. However, I don't mean to find fault; but I can
tell you this one thing, &s;ir, which I beg you to re|member;
which is, if you don't make her happy, you'll
break my heart! For &s;he's what I love the be&s;t in the
world, little as I've made it appear, by not leaving her
a &s;hilling. For which &s;ake, however, I can't but re|&s;pect
you the more for coming after her, in&s;tead of Eu|genia.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir?&endq; cried the Major, amazed.</P>
<P>&startq;The other two chaps,&endq; continued he, &startq;that came
about us not long ago, wanted to make their court to
Eugenia and Indiana; as well as another that came
to the hou&s;e when I was ill, in the &s;ame coat as your|&s;elf,
by what I can gather from the de&s;cription; but
never a one has come to Camilla yet, except your&s;elf,
becau&s;e my brother can &s;pare her but a trifle, having
another young girl to provide for&punc; be&s;ides Lionel;
which is the mo&s;t expen&s;ive of them all, poor boy! ne|ver
having enough, by the rea&s;on Oxford is &s;o dear, as
&s;uppo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>The Major now wore an air of &s;urpri&s;e and unea&s;i|ne&s;s
that Sir Hugh began to ob&s;erve, but attributed to
his unplea&s;ant reception of his propo&s;als. He begged his
pardon, therefore, and again a&s;&s;ured him of his re&s;pect for
<PB N="261" REF="62">
a choice &s;o little mercenary, which he looked upon as a
mark of a good heart.</P>
<P>The Major, completely &s;taggered, and &s;u&s;pect|ing
the information of Lionel to be ill grounded, if
not purpo&s;ely deluding, entreated his permi&s;&s;ion to
wait upon him again; and offered for the pre&s;ent to
take leave.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, in a melancholy voice, &s;aid, he would
fir&s;t &s;ummon his niece, as he could not an&s;wer it to
his con&s;cience preventing the meeting, unle&s;s &s;he gave
him leave.</P>
<P>He then rang the bell, and told Jacob to call Ca|milla.</P>
<P>Major Cerwood was exce&s;&s;ively di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. To re|treat
&s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible; yet to connect him&s;elf without
fortune, when he thought he was addre&s;&s;ing a rich
heire&s;s, was a turn of fate he &s;carcely know how either
to &s;upport or to parry. All that, in this ha&s;te, he
could re&s;olve, was, to let the matter pa&s;s for the mo|ment,
and then in&s;i&s;t upon &s;atisfaction from Lionel,
either in clearing up the mi&s;take, or taking upon him&s;elf
its blame.</P>
<P>When Camilla appeared, the di&s;turbance of Sir Hugh
&s;till augmented; and he could hardly articulate, &startq;My
dear, in the ca&s;e you are willing to leave your family,
here's a gentleman come to make his addre&s;&s;es to you;
which I think it right you &s;hould know, though how I
&s;hall &s;truggle through it, if I lo&s;e you, is more than my
poor weak head can tell; for what &s;hall I do without
my dear little girl, that I thought to make the be&s;t
comfort of my old age? which, however, I beg you
not to think of in ca&s;e this young captain's more
agreeable.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! my dear uncle!&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;your Camilla
can never return half the comfort &s;he receives from you!
keep me with you &s;till, and ever! I am much obliged
to Major Cerwood. I beg him to accept my &s;incere&s;t
thanks; but to pardon me when I a&s;&s;ure him, they are
all I have to offer him.&endq;</P>
<P>Repul&s;e was not new to the Major; who, in vari|ous
country towns had &s;ought to retrieve his affairs by
<PB N="262" REF="63">
&s;ome prudent connection; his pride, however, had
never &s;o little &s;uffered as on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, for
his apprehen&s;ion of error or impo&s;ition had removed
from him all thought of even the po&s;&s;ibility of a refu&s;al;
which, now, therefore, unexpectedly and joyfully ob|viated
his embarra&s;&s;ment, and enabled him to quit the
field by an honourable retreat. He bowed profoundly,
called him&s;elf, without knowing what he &s;aid, the mo&s;t
unhappy of men; and, without ri&s;king one &s;olicitation,
or a moment for repentance, ha&s;tily took leave, with
intention, immediately, to demand an explanation of
Lionel.</P>
<P>But he had not e&s;caped a mile from the hou&s;e, ere he
gave up that de&s;ign, from anticipating the ridicule that
might follow it. To require &s;atisfaction for a young
lady's want of fortune, however rea&s;onable, would al|ways
be derided as ludicrous. He re&s;olved therefore,
quietly to put up with the rejection; and to gather his
next documents concerning the portion of a fair dam&s;el,
from authority better to be relied upon than that of a
brother.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh for &s;ome time, di&s;covered not that he had
retired. Enchanted by &s;o unexpected a dimi&s;&s;ion, his
favourite &s;cheme of life &s;eemed accorded to him, and
he pre&s;&s;ed Camilla to his bo&s;om, in a tran&s;port of
joy. &startq;We &s;hall live together, now, I hope,&endq; he
cried, &startq;without any of the&s;e young chaps coming in
again to part us. Not that I would object to your mar|rying,
my dear girl, if it was with a relation, like
Eugenia, or, with a neighbour, like Indiana, if it
had not been for its going off; but to &s;ee you taken
away from me by a m$re &s;tranger, coming from di&s;tant
parts, and knowing nothing of any of us, is a thing
that makes my heart ache but to think of; &s;o I hope it
will happen no more; for the&s;e trials do not good to my
recovery.&endq;</P>
<P>Turning round, then, with a view to &s;ay &s;omething
con&s;olatory to the Major, he was &s;eriou&s;ly concerned to
find him departed. &startq;I can't &s;ay,&endq; he cried, &startq;I had any
intention to &s;end him off &s;o &s;hort, his meaning not be|ing
bad, con&s;idering him in the light of a per&s;on in love;
<PB N="263" REF="64">
which is a time when a man has not much thought,
except for him&s;elf, by what I can gather.&endq;</P>
<P>He then propo&s;ed a walk, to watch if Clermont were
coming. The wind, he acknowledged, was indeed
contrary; but, he did not doubt, upon &s;uch a particular
occa&s;ion, his good lad would not mind &s;uch difficul|ties.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Bull-Dog.</HEAD>
<P>SIR HUGH called upon his other nieces to join him;
purpo&s;ing to &s;troll to the end of a lane which led to
the London road.</P>
<P>Camilla accompanied the party in the mo&s;t mournful
&s;ilence. The a&s;&s;uming letter &s;he had received; the inter|view
&s;he &s;hould have to &s;u&s;tain; and her apparent de|pendance
upon Sir Sedley, &s;inking her into complete de|&s;pondence.</P>
<P>When they came to the high road, Sir Hugh made
a &s;top, and bid every body look &s;harp.</P>
<P>A hor&s;eman was &s;een advancing full gallop. By his
figure he appeared to be young; by his pace, in uncom|mon
&s;peed.</P>
<P>&startq;That's him,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, &s;triking his &s;tick
upon the ground, and &s;miling mo&s;t complacently; &startq;I
&s;aid he would not mind the wind, my dear Eugenia!
what's the wind, or the waves either, to a lover?
which is a thing, however, that I won't talk about;
&s;o don't be a&s;hamed, my dear girl, nobody knowing
what we mean.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="65">
Eugenia looked down; deeply colouring, and much
regretting the lamene&s;s that prevented her running
back, to avoid &s;o public and di&s;countenancing a meet|ing.</P>
<P>The hor&s;eman now came up to them, and was pre|paring
to turn down the lane; when all at once, they
perceived him to be Edgar Mandlebert.</P>
<P>He had left Tunbridge in a manner not more abrupt
than comfortle&s;s. His di&s;appointment in the failure of
Camilla at the rooms had been as bitter, as his ex|pectations
from the promi&s;ed conference had been
animated. When Lionel appeared, he inquired if his
&s;i&s;ter were ab&s;ent from illne&s;s&mdash;No; &s;he was only writ|ing
a letter. To take this moment for &s;uch a purpo&s;e,
be the letter what it might, &s;eemed &s;porting with his
curio&s;ity and warm intere&s;t in her affairs: and he went
back, mortified and dejected, to his lodgings; where,
ju&s;t arrived by the &s;tage, he found a letter from Dr.
Marchmont, acquainting him with his return to his
rectory. In this &s;u&s;pen&s;ive &s;tate of mind, to ca&s;t him|&s;elf
upon his &s;agacious friend &s;eemed a relief the mo&s;t
de&s;irable: but, while con&s;idering whether fir&s;t to claim
from Camilla her promi&s;ed communication the voice
of Lionel i&s;&s;uing from the room of Major Cerwood,
&s;truck his ears. He darted forth, and accompanied the
youth to his hor&s;e, who was &s;etting out upon &s;ome ex|pedition,
in the dark; and then received information,
under the pretence of great &s;ecrecy, that Major er|wood
was going immediately to a&s;k leave of ab&s;ence,
and proceed &s;traight to Hamp&s;hire, with his final pro|po&s;als
of marriage with Camilla. He now concluded
this was the &s;ubject upon which &s;he had meant to con|&s;ult
with him; but delicacy, pride, and hope all com|bated
his interference. He determined even to avoid
her, till the an&s;wer &s;hould be given. &startq;I mu&s;t owe her
hand,&endq; cried he, &startq;to her heart, not to a conte&s;t &s;uch
as this: and, if impartially and unbia&s;&s;ed, the Major
is refu&s;ed, no farther cruel doubt, no torturing he&s;ita|tion,
&s;hall keep me another minute from her feet!&endq;
With the dawn, therefore, he &s;at out for Hamp&s;hire;
but, fixed to avoid Cleves, till he could learn that the
<PB N="265" REF="66">
Major's vi&s;it were over, he devoted his mornings to
rides, and his evenings to Dr. Marchmont, till now, a
mile or two from the Park, he had met the Major him|&s;elf,
and concluded the acceptance or the rejection de|cided.
They merely touched their hats as they pa&s;&s;ed
each other; and he in&s;tantly took the route which the
Major was quitting.</P>
<P>In the exce&s;s of his tribulation, he was gallopping
pa&s;t the whole group, without di&s;cerning one of its fi|gures;
when Sir Hugh called out, &startq;Why it's young
Mr. Edgar! So now we've walked all this way for no|thing!
and Clermont may be &s;till at Jericho, or at
Rome, for any thing we know to the contray!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar &s;topt &s;hort. He felt him&s;elf &s;hiver at &s;ight of
Camilla, but di&s;mounted, gave his hor&s;e to his groom,
and joined the party.</P>
<P>Eugenia recovering, now fearle&s;sly looked up; but
Camilla, &s;truck and affected, &s;hook in every limb, and
was forced to hold by Lavinia.</P>
<P>Edgar called upon his utmo&s;t pre&s;ence of mind to
carry him through what he conceived to be a final trial.
He &s;poke to Sir Hugh, and compelled him&s;elf to &s;peak
&s;eparately to every one el&s;e: but, when he addre&s;&s;ed
Camilla, to whom he &s;aid &s;omething not very di&s;tinct|ly,
about Tunbridge, &s;he curt&s;ied to him &s;lightly, and
turned away, without making any an&s;wer. Her mind,
taking &s;uddenly a quick retro&s;pection of all that had
pa&s;&s;ed between them, pre&s;ented him to her view as un|certain
and delu&s;ive; and, ca&s;ting upon him, internal|ly,
the whole odium of her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, and her
feelings were &s;o indignant, that, in her pre&s;ent de&s;perate
&s;tate, &s;he deemed it beneath her to di&s;gui&s;e them, either
from him&s;elf or the world.</P>
<P>Edgar, to who&s;e troubled imagination every thing
painted his rival, concluded the Major had been heard
with favour; and his own adver&s;e coun&s;el was now re|collected
with re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, far more fatigued by his di&s;appointment
than by his walk, &s;aid he &s;hould go no further, as he
found it in vain to expect Clermont; and accepted the
arm of Edgar to aid his &s;tick in helping him home.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="67">
Camilla, &s;till leaning upon Lavinia, mounted a little
bank, which &s;he knew Sir Hugh could not a&s;cend, that
&s;he might walk on where Edgar could not join her; in|voluntarily
ejaculating, &startq;Lavinia! if you would avoid
deceit and treachery, look at a man as at a picture,
which tells you only the pre&s;ent moment! Rely upon
nothing of time to come! They are not like us, Lavinia.
They think them&s;elves free, if they have made no ver|bal
profe&s;&s;ion; though they may have pledged them|&s;elves
by looks, by actions, by attentions, and by man|ners,
a thou&s;and, and a thou&s;and times!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar ob&s;erved her avoidance with the keene&s;t ap|prehen&s;ion;
and, connecting it with her failure at the
rooms, imagined the Major had now influenced her to
an utter aver&s;ion of him.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh meanwhile, though wholly unheard, re|lated,
in a low voice, to Edgar, the hi&s;tory of his pre|parations
for Clermont; begging him, however, to take
no notice of them to Eugenia: and, then, adding,
&startq;Very likely, Mr. Edgar, you are ju&s;t come from
Tunbridge! and, if &s;o, you may have met with that
young Captain that has been with us this morning;
who, I under&s;tand to be a Major?&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar was thrown into the utmo&s;t trepidation; the
artle&s;s openne&s;s of Sir Hugh gave him every rea&s;on to
&s;uppo&s;e he &s;hould immediately gather full intelligence,
and all his peace and all his hopes might hang upon
another word. He could only bow to the que&s;tion;
but before Sir Hugh could go on, a butcher's boy, who
was riding by, from a wanton love of mi&s;chief, gave a
&s;ignal to his attending bull-dog, to attack the old &s;pa|niel
that accompanied Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>Su&s;tained by his ma&s;ter many a year, the proud old
favourite, though unequal to the combat, di&s;dained to
fly; and the fierce bull-dog would pre&s;ently have demo|li&s;hed
him, had not Edgar, recovering all his vigour
from his earne&s;t de&s;ire to re&s;cue an animal &s;o dear to Sir
Hugh, armed him&s;elf with the baronet's &s;tick, and
thru&s;t it dexterou&s;ly acro&s;s the jaws of his intended an|tagoni&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="68">
Nothing, however, could with&s;tand the fangs of the
bull-dog; they &s;oon &s;evered it, and, again, he made at
the &s;paniel; but Edgar ru&s;hed between them, with no
other weapons than the broken fragments of the &s;tick:
and, while the baronet and Eugenia &s;creamed out to old
Rover to return to them, and Lavinia, with more rea|dine&s;s
of common &s;en&s;e, exerted the fulle&s;t powers of
which her gentle voice was capable, to conjure the
wicked boy to call off his dog, Camilla, who was the
la&s;t to look round at this &s;cene, only turned about as
the incen&s;ed and di&s;appointed bull-dog, mi&s;&s;ing his ob|ject,
aimed at Edgar him&s;elf. Rou&s;ed at once from her
&s;ullen calm to the mo&s;t agoni&s;ing &s;en&s;ibility, every thing
and every body, her&s;elf mo&s;t of all, were forgotten in
the &s;ight of his danger; and, with a piercing &s;hriek,
&s;he darted down the bank, and arrived at the tremen|dous
&s;pot, at the &s;ame in&s;tant that the more u&s;eful ex|hortations
of Lavinia, had induced the boy to withdraw
the fierce animal; who, with all his might, and all his
fury, obeyed the weak whi&s;tle of a little urchin he had
been bred to love and re&s;pect, for bringing him his daily
food.</P>
<P>Camilla perceived not if the danger were impending,
or over; ga&s;ping, pale, and agitated, &s;he caught Man|dlebert
by the arm, and, in broken accents, half pro|nounced,
&startq;O Edgar!&mdash;are you hurt?&endq;</P>
<P>The revul&s;ion that had operated in her mind took
now its ample turn in that of Mandlebert; he could
hardly tru&s;t his &s;en&s;es, hardly believe he exi&s;ted; yet
he felt the pre&s;&s;ure of her hand upon his arm, and &s;aw
in her countenance terror the mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed, and ten|derne&s;s
that went &s;traight to his &s;oul. &startq;Is it Camil|la,&endq;
he cried, &startq;who thus &s;peaks to me?&mdash;Is not my
&s;afety or my de&s;truction alike indifferent to Camilla?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O no! O no!&endq; cried &s;he, &s;carce con&s;cious &s;he an|&s;wered
at all, till called to recollection by his own
changed looks; changed from incredulity and amaze|ment
to animation that lightened up every feature, to
eyes that &s;hot fire. Aba&s;hed, a&s;toni&s;hed, a&s;hamed, &s;he
precipitately drew away her hand, and &s;ought quietly
to retire.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="69">
But Edgar was no longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf; he con|ceived
he was on a pinnacle, whence he could only,
and without any gradation, turn to happine&s;s or de&s;pair.
He followed her, trembling and uncertain, his joy fad|ing
into alarm at her retreat, his hope transforming into
apprehen&s;ion at her re&s;umed coldne&s;s of demeanor.
&startq;Do you repent,&endq; he cried, &startq;that you have &s;hewn
$span$ humanity?&mdash;will the Major&mdash;the happy
Major&punc;&mdash;be offended you do le&s;s than dete&s;t me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Major!&endq; repeated &s;he, looking back, &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
&startq;can you think the Major has any influence
with me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Heaven!&endq; he cried, &startq;what do you &s;ay!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Enchanted, affrighted, bewildered, yet &s;ilent, &s;he
hurried on; Edgar could not forget him&s;elf more than
a moment; he forbore, therefore, to follow, and, though
with a &s;elf-denial next to torture, returned to Sir Hugh,
to whom his arm was doubly nece&s;&s;ary, from the &s;cene
he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed, and the lo&s;s of his &s;tick.</P>
<P>The butcher's boy and his bull-doy were decamped;
and the baronet and Eugenia were rivalling each other
in fondling the re&s;cued &s;paniel, and in pouring thanks
and prai&s;es unlimited upon Edgar.</P>
<P>They then walked back as before; and, as &s;oon as
they re-entered the man&s;ion, the female party went up
&s;tairs, and Sir Hugh, warmly &s;haking Edgar by the
hand, &s;aid: &startq;My dear Mr. Edgar, this is one of the
happie&s;t days of my life, except ju&s;t that of my ne|phew's
coming over, which it is but right to put before
it. But here, fir&s;t, my dear Camilla's refu&s;ed that
young Captain, who would have carried her the Lord
knows where, immediately, as I make no doubt: and
next, I've &s;aved the life of my poor old Rover, by the
means of your good-nature.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Refu&s;ed?&endq; cried Edgar; &startq;my dear Sir Hugh!&mdash;
did you &s;ay refu&s;ed?&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh innocently gratified him with the repetition
of the word, but begged him not to mention it, &startq;For
fear,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;it &s;hould hurt the young man when
he falls in love &s;omewhere el&s;e; which I heartily hope
<PB N="269" REF="70">
he will do &s;oon, poor gentleman! for the &s;ake of its
not fretting him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;s Camilla, then, has refu&s;ed him?&endq; again re|peated
Edgar, with a countenance that, to any man
but the baronet, mu&s;t have betrayed his whole &s;oul.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, poor gentleman! this very morning; for
which I am thankful enough: for what do we know of
tho&s;e young officers, who may all be &s;ent to the Ea&s;t
Indies, or Jamaica, every day of their lives? Not but
what I have the proper pity for him, which, I hope, is
all that can be expected.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar walked about the room, in a perturbation of
hope, fear, and joy, that di&s;abled him from all further
appearance of attention. He wi&s;hed to relate this tran&s;|action
to Dr. Marchmont, yet dreaded any retarding
advice; he langui&s;hed to make Camilla her&s;elf the &s;ole
mi&s;tre&s;s of his de&s;tiny: the intere&s;t &s;he had &s;hewn for
his &s;afety &s;eemed to admit but one interpretation; and,
finally, he re&s;olved to &s;tay at Cleves till he could meet
with her alone.</P>
<P>Camilla had not uttered a word after the adventure of
the bull-dog. The &s;malle&s;t idea that &s;he could excite
the lea&s;t emotion in Edgar, brought a &s;ecret rapture to
her heart, that, at any former period, would alone have
&s;ufficed to render her happy: but, at this in&s;tant of en|tanglement
with another, &s;he revolted from the indul|gence
of &s;uch plea&s;ure; and in&s;tead of dwelling, as &s;he
would have done before, on the look, the accent, the
manner, that were &s;u&s;ceptible, by any con&s;truction, of
partiality, &s;he checked every idea that did not repre&s;ent
Edgar as un&s;table and incon&s;i&s;tent; and &s;ought, with
all her power, to regard him as Mrs. Arlbery had paint|ed
him, and to believe him, except in a few ca&s;ual mo|ments
of caprice, in&s;en&s;ible and hard of heart.</P>
<P>Yet this entanglement, in which, &s;carce knowing
how, &s;he now &s;eemed to be entwined with Sir Sedley,
grew more and more terrific; and when &s;he con&s;idered
that her &s;i&s;ters them&s;elves thought her independence
gone, and her honour engaged, &s;he was &s;eized with &s;o
much wonderment, how it had all been brought about,
<PB N="270" REF="71">
that her under&s;tanding &s;eemed to play her fal&s;e, and
&s;he believed the whole a dream.</P>

<P>WHEN the &s;i&s;ters were &s;ummoned down &s;tairs to
dinner, planted at the door, ready to receive them at
their entrance, &s;tood Edgar. Lavinia and Eugenia ad|dre&s;&s;ed
him as u&s;ual; but Camilla could not &s;peak, could
not return his &s;alutation, could not look at him. She
&s;at ha&s;tily down in her accu&s;tomed place by her uncle,
and even the pre&s;ence of her father &s;carcely re&s;trained
her tears, as &s;he contra&s;ted the hopele&s;s uncertainties of
Edgar, with the perilous pur&s;uit of Sir Sedley.</P>
<P>Edgar, for the fir&s;t time, &s;aw her avoidance without
&s;u&s;pecting that it flowed from repugnance. The intere&s;t
&s;he had &s;hewn for his &s;afety was &s;till bounding in his
brea&s;t, and as, from time to time, he &s;tole a glance at
her, and ob&s;erved her emotion, his heart whi&s;pered
him the &s;ofte&s;t hopes, that &s;oon the mo&s;t perfect confi|dence
would make every feeling reciprocal.</P>
<P>But the&s;e hopes were not long without alloy; he
&s;oon di&s;cerned &s;omething that far exceeded what could
give him plea&s;ure in her perturbation; he read in it not
merely hurry and alarm, but &s;uffering and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>He now ventured to look at her no more; his con|fidence
gave place to pity; he &s;aw &s;he was unhappy,
and breathed no pre&s;ent wi&s;h but to relieve and con&s;ole
her.</P>
<P>When the de&s;&s;ert was &s;erved, &s;he was preparing to
retire; but &s;he caught the eye of her father, and &s;aw

&s;he &s;hould not long be alone; &s;he re-&s;eated her&s;elf, there|fore,
in ha&s;te, to po&s;tpone, at lea&s;t, his &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>Every body, at length, aro&s;e, and Sir Hugh pro|po&s;ed
that they &s;hould all walk in the park, during his
nap, but keep clo&s;e to the pales, that they might li&s;ten
for all pa&s;&s;engers, in ca&s;e of Clermont's coming.</P>
<P>To this, al&s;o, Camilla could make no objection, and
they &s;et out. She took an arm of each &s;i&s;ter, and in|dulged
the heavine&s;s of her heart in not uttering a
word.</P>
<P>They had not gone far when a &s;ervant ran after Mr.
Tyrold with a pacquet, ju&s;t arrived, by a private hand,
from Li&s;bon. He returned to read it in his own room;
Lavinia and Eugenia accompanied him to hear its con|tents,
and Camilla, for the fir&s;t time, &s;eemed the lea&s;t
affectionate of his daughters; &s;he dur&s;t not encounter
him but in the mixt company of all the hou&s;e; &s;he told
Lavinia to make ha&s;te back with the news, and took
the arm of Indiana.</P>
<P>The compul&s;ion of unintere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e &s;oon be|came
intolerable; and no longer chained to the party
by the awe of her father, &s;he pre&s;ently left Indiana to
Mi&s;s Margland, and perceiving that Edgar was conver|&s;ing
with Dr. Orkborne, &s;aid the would wait for her
&s;i&s;ters; and, turning a little a&s;ide, &s;at down upon a
bench under a large oak.</P>
<P>Here her painful &s;truggle and unwilling forbearance
ended; &s;he gave free vent to her tears, and thought
her&s;elf the mo&s;t wretched of human beings; &s;he found
her heart, her aching heart, more than ever devoted to
Mandlebert, filled with his image, revering his virtues,
honouring even his coldne&s;s, from a per&s;ua&s;ion &s;he de|&s;erved
not his affection, and &s;ighing &s;olely&punc; for the pri|vilege
to con&s;ign her&s;elf to his remembrance for life,
though unknown to him&s;elf, and un&s;u&s;pected by the
world. The very idea of Sir Sedley was horror to
her; &s;he felt guilty to have involved her&s;elf in an in|tercour&s;e
&s;o fertile of danger; &s;he thought over, with
&s;evere&s;t repentance, her &s;hort, but unju&s;ti&s;iable deviati|on
from that tran&s;parent openne&s;s, and unde&s;igning
plainne&s;s of conduct, which her di&s;po&s;ition as much
<PB N="272" REF="73">
as her education ought to have rendered unchangeable.
To that, alone, was owing all her actual difficulty, for
to that alone was owing her own opinion of any claim
upon her ju&s;tice. How dearly, &s;he cried, do I now pay
for the unthinking plan with which I ri&s;ked the peace
of another, for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my own! She
langui&s;hed to throw her&s;elf into the arms of her father,
to unbo&s;om to him all her errors and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and owe
their extrication to his wi&s;dom and kindne&s;s. She was
&s;ure he would be unmoved by the glare of a brilliant
e&s;tabli&s;hment, and that far from de&s;iring her to &s;acri|fice
her feelings to wealth and &s;hew, he would him&s;elf
plead again&s;t the alliance when he knew the &s;tate of
her mind and recommend to her, &s;o circum&s;tanced,
the &s;ingle life, in the true &s;pirit of chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy
and moderation: but all was &s;o clo&s;ely interwoven in
the affairs and ill conduct of her brother, that &s;he be|lieved
her&s;elf engaged in honour to guard the fatal &s;e|cret,
though hazarding by its concealment impropriety
and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The&s;e afflicting ruminations were at length interrupt|ed
by the &s;ound of feet; &s;he took her handkerchief
from her eyes, expecting to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ters; &s;he was
mi&s;taken, and beheld Mandlebert.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted and ro&s;e: &s;he &s;trove to chace the tears
from her eyes without wiping them, and a&s;ked what
he had done with Dr. Orkborne?</P>
<P>&startq;You are in grief!&endq; cried he in a tone of &s;ympa|thy;
&startq;&s;ome evil has befallen you!&mdash;let me a&s;k&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No; I am only waiting for my &s;i&s;ters. They
have ju&s;t received letters from Li&s;bon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have been weeping! you are weeping now!
why do you turn away from me? I will not obtru&s;ively
demand your confidence&mdash;yet, could I give you the
mo&s;t di&s;tant idea what a weight it might remove from
my mind,&mdash;you would find it difficult to deny your&s;elf
the plea&s;ure of doing &s;o much good!&endq;</P>
<P>The tears of Camilla now &s;treamed afre&s;h. Words
&s;o kind from Edgar, the cold, the hard-hearted Ed|gar,
&s;urpri&s;ed and over&s;et her; yet &s;he endeavoured to
hide her face, and made an effort to pa&s;s him.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="74">
&startq;Is not this a little unkind?&endq; cried he, gravely;
&startq;however, I have no claim to oppo&s;e you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Unkind&endq; &s;he repeated, and involuntarily turning
to him, &s;hewed a countenance &s;o di&s;con&s;olate, that he
lo&s;t his &s;elf-control, and taking her reluctant hand,
&s;aid: &startq;O Camilla! torture me no longer!&endq;</P>
<P>Almo&s;t transfixed with a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;he looked at
him for a moment in a &s;peechle&s;s wonder; but the in|terval
of doubt was &s;hort; the character of Edgar, for
unalienable &s;teadine&s;s, unalterable honour, was fixed
in her mind, like &startq;truths from holy writ,&endq; and &s;he
knew, with certainty incontrovertible, that his fate was
at her di&s;po&s;al, from the in&s;tant he acknowledged
openly her power over his feelings.</P>
<P>Every oppo&s;ite &s;en&s;ation, that with violence the mo&s;t
ungovernable could encounter but to combat, now met
in her bo&s;om, elevating her to rapture, harrowing her
with terror, menacing even her under&s;tanding. The
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite wi&s;h of her heart &s;eemed accorded at a
period &s;o nearly too late for its acceptance, that her
faculties, bewildered, confu&s;ed, deranged, lo&s;t the capa|city
of clearly conceiving if &s;till &s;he were a free agent
or not.</P>
<P>He &s;aw her exce&s;s of di&s;order with alarm; he &s;ought
to draw her again to her &s;eat; but &s;he put her hand
upon her forehead, and leant it again&s;t the bark of
the tree.</P>
<P>&startq;You will not &s;peak to me!&endq; cried he; you will
not tru&s;t me! &s;hall I call you cruel? No! for you are
not aware of the pain you inflict, the angui&s;h you make
me &s;uffer! the genero&s;ity of your Nature would el&s;e,
unbidden, impul&s;ively interfere.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>You</HI> &s;uffer! <HI>you!</HI>&endq; cried &s;he, again di&s;tre&s;sfully,
almo&s;t incredulou&s;ly, looking at him, while her hands
were uplifted with amazement: &startq;I thought you above
any &s;uffering! &s;uperior to all calamity!&mdash;almo&s;t to all
feeling!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Camilla! what thus e&s;tranges you from can|dor?
from ju&s;tice? what is it can prompt you to goad
thus a heart which almo&s;t from its fir&s;t beating&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="75">
He &s;topt, de&s;irous to check him&s;elf; while pene|trated
by his &s;oftne&s;s, and a&s;hamed of what, in the
bitterne&s;s of her &s;pirit, &s;he had pronounced, &s;he again
melted into tears, and &s;unk down upon the bench; yet
holding out to him one hand, while with the other &s;he
covered her face: &startq;Forgive me,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;I en|treat&mdash;for
I &s;carce know what I &s;ay.&endq;</P>
<P>Such a &s;peech, and &s;o accompanied, might have de|moli&s;hed
the &s;toici&s;m of an older philo&s;opher than Ed|gar;
he fervently ki&s;&s;ed her proferred hand, exclaim|ing:
&startq;Forgive you! can Camilla u&s;e &s;uch a word?
has &s;he the &s;lighte&s;t care for my opinion? the mo&s;t re|mote
concern for me, or for my happine&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Farewell! farewell!&endq; cried &s;he, ha&s;tily drawing
away her hand, &startq;go now, I be&s;eech you!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a moment to expect me to depart! O Ca|milla!
my &s;oul &s;ickens of this &s;u&s;pence! End it gene|rous
Camilla! beloved as lovely! my heart is all your
own! u&s;e it gently, and accept it nobly!&endq;</P>
<P>Every other emotion, now, in the vanqui&s;hed Ca|milla,
every retro&s;pective fear, every actual regret,
yielded to the conquering charm of grateful tenderne&s;s;
and re&s;toring the hand &s;he had withdrawn: &startq;O Ed|gar,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;how little can I merit &s;uch a gift!
yet I prize it&mdash;far, far, beyond all worlds!&endq;</P>
<P>The agitation of Edgar was, at fir&s;t, too mighty
and too delicious for &s;peech; but his eyes, now ca&s;t
up to heaven, now fixed upon her own, &s;poke the mo&s;t
ardent, yet pure&s;t felicity; while her hand, now held
to his heart, now pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, &s;trove vainly to
recover its liberty. &startq;Ble&s;t moment&endq; he at length
uttered, &startq;that fini&s;hes for ever &s;uch mi&s;ery of uncer|tainty!
that gives my life to happine&s;s&mdash;my exi&s;tence
to Camilla!&endq;</P>
<P>Again &s;peech &s;eemed too poor for him. Perfect &s;a|tisfaction
is &s;eldom loquacious; its character is rather
tender than gay; and where happine&s;s &s;ucceeds abrupt|ly
to long &s;olicitude and &s;orrow, its enjoyment is fear|ful;
it &s;oftens rather than exhilarates. Sudden joy is
&s;portive, but &s;udden happine&s;s is awful.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="76">
The pau&s;e, however, that on his &s;ide was ec&s;tatic
thankfulne&s;s, &s;oon became mixt, on that of Camilla,
with confu&s;ion and remor&s;e: Sir Sedley returned to
her memory, and with him every reflection, and every
apprehen&s;ion, that mo&s;t cruelly could fully each trem|bling,
though nearly gratified hope.</P>
<P>The cloud that &s;o &s;oon dimmed the tran&s;ient radi|ance
of her countenance, was in&s;tantly perceived by
Edgar; but as he was beginning the mo&s;t anxious in|quiries,
the two &s;i&s;ters approached, and Camilla, who&s;e
hand he then relinqui&s;hed, ru&s;hed forward, and throw|ing
her arms around their necks, wept upon their bo|&s;oms.</P>
<P>&startq;Sweet &s;i&s;ters!&endq; cried Edgar, embracing them all
three in one; &startq;long may ye thus endearingly entwine
each other, in the &s;acred links of affectionate affinity!
Where &s;hall I find our common father?&mdash;where is Mr.
Tyrold?&endq;</P>
<P>The amazed &s;i&s;ters could with difficulty an&s;wer that
he was with their uncle, to whom he was communica|ting
news from their mother.</P>
<P>Edgar looked tenderly at Camilla, but, perceiving
her emotion, forbore to &s;peak to her, though he could
not deny him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of &s;natching one ki&s;s of
the hand which hung down upon the &s;houlder of Eu|genia;
he then whi&s;pered to both the &s;i&s;ters: &startq;You
will not, I tru&s;t, be my enemies?' and hurried to the
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;What can this mean?&endq; cried Eugenia and Lavi|nia
in a breath.</P>
<P>&startq;It means, &s;aid Camilla, &startq;that I am the mo&s;t di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
&mdash;yet the happie&s;t of human beings!&endq;</P>
<P>This little &s;peech, began with the deepe&s;t &s;igh, but
fini&s;hed with the mo&s;t refulgent &s;mile, only added to
their wonder.</P>
<P>&startq;I hope you have been con&s;ulting with Edgar,&endq;
&s;aid the innocent Eugenia; &startq;nobody can more ably
advi&s;e you, &s;ince, in geuero&s;ity to Lionel, you are
prohibited from coun&s;elling with my father.&endq;</P>
<P>Again the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive &s;miles played in every fea|ture
through the tears of Camilla, as &s;he turned, with
<PB N="276" REF="77">
involuntary archne&s;s, to Eugenia, and an&s;wered:
&startq;And &s;hall I follow his coun&s;el, my dear &s;i&s;ter, if he
gives me any?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why not? he is wi&s;e, prudent, and much at|tached
to us all. How he can have &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;&s;ible
we could be his enemies, is pa&s;t all divination!&endq;</P>
<P>Gaiety was &s;o truly the native growth of the mind
of Camilla, that neither care nor affliction could chace
it long from its home. The &s;peeches of the un&s;u&s;pi|cious
Eugenia, that a moment before would have pa&s;t
unheeded, now regaled her renovated fancy with a thou|&s;and
amu&s;ing images, which &s;o vigorou&s;ly &s;truggled
again&s;t her &s;adne&s;s and her terrors, that they were &s;oon
nearly driven from the field by their &s;portive a&s;&s;ailants;
and, by the time &s;he reached her chamber, whither,
lo&s;t in amaze, her &s;i&s;ters followed her, the &s;urpri&s;e &s;he
had in &s;tore for them, the plea&s;ure with which &s;he knew
they would &s;ympathi&s;e in her happine&s;s, and the &s;ecurity
of Edgar's decided regard, had liberated her mind
from the &s;hackles of remini&s;cence, and re&s;tored her vi|vacity
to its original &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Fa&s;tening, then, her door, &s;he turned to them with
a countenance of the brighte&s;t animation; alternately
and almo&s;t wildly embraced them, and related the ex|plicit
declaration of Edgar; now hiding in their bo&s;oms
the blu&s;hes of her mode&s;t joy, now offering up to
Heaven the thank&s;giving of her artle&s;s rapture, now di&s;|&s;olving
in the &s;oft tears of the tendere&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, ac|cording
to the quick changing impul&s;es of her natural
and lively, yet feeling and &s;u&s;ceptible character. Nor
once did &s;he look at the rever&s;e of this darling portrait
of cho&s;en felicity, till Eugenia, with a gentle &s;igh, ut|tered:
&startq;Unhappy Sir Sedley Clarendel! how may
this &s;troke be &s;oftened to him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah Eugenia!&endq; &s;he cried; &startq;that alone is my im|pediment
to the mo&s;t perfect, the mo&s;t unmixt content!
why have you made me think of him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear Camilla,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, with a look of
curious earne&s;tne&s;s, and taking both her hands, while
&s;he &s;eemed examining her face, &startq;you are then, it &s;eems,
in love? and with Edgar Mandlebert?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="78">
Camilla, blu&s;hing, yet laughing, broke away from her,
denying the charge</P>
<P>A con&s;ultation &s;ucceeded upon the method of pro|ceeding
with the young Baronet. Tommy Hodd was
not yet returned with the an&s;wer; it was five miles to
Clarendel Place, which made going and returning his
day's work. She re&s;olved to wait but this one reply,
and then to acknowledge to Edgar the whole of her
&s;ituation. The delicacy of Lavinia, and the high ho|nour
of Eugenia, concurred in the propriety of this con|fe&s;&s;ion;
and they all &s;aw the urgent nece&s;&s;ity of an imme|diate
explanation with Sir Sedley, who&s;e di&s;appointment
might every hour receive added weight from delay.
Painful, therefore, confu&s;ing and di&s;ta&s;teful, as was the
ta&s;k, Camilla determined upon the avowal, and as com|pletely
to be guided by Edgar in this difficult conjunc|ture,
as if his advice were already &s;anctioned by conju|gal
authority.</P>

<P>EDGAR returned to the parlour with a countenance
&s;o much brightened, a joy &s;o open, a confidence &s;o
manly, and an air &s;o &s;trongly announcing &s;ome intere&s;t|ing
intelligence, that his hi&s;tory required no prelude.
&startq;Edgar,&endq; &s;aid Mr Tyrold, &startq;you have a look to di&s;|arm
care of its corro&s;ion. You could not take a better
time to wear &s;o cheering an a&s;pect; I have ju&s;t learnt
that my wife can fix no &s;ort of date for her return; I
mu&s;t borrow, therefore, &s;ome reflected happine&s;s; and
none, after my children, can bring its &s;un&s;hine &s;o home
to my bo&s;om as your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="79">
&startq;What a fortunate moment have you cho&s;en,&endq; cried
Edgar, affectionately taking him by the hand, to expre&s;s
this generous plea&s;ure in &s;eeing me happy! will you
repent, will you retract, when you hear in what it may
involve you?&mdash;Deare&s;t &s;ir! my honoured, my parental
friend! to what a te&s;t &s;hall I put your kindne&s;s!&mdash;Will
you give me in charge one of the deare&s;t ties of
your exi&s;tence? will you repo&s;e in my care &s;o large a
portion of your peace? will you tru&s;t to me your Ca|milla?&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>With all the ardour of her character, all the keen and
quick feelings of her &s;en&s;itive mind, &s;carce had Camilla
her&s;elf been more &s;truck, more penetrated with &s;udden
joy, &s;udden wonder, &s;udden gratification of every kind,
than Mr. Tyrold felt at this moment. He more than
returned the pre&s;&s;ure with which Edgar held his hand,
and in&s;tantly an&s;wered, &startq;Yes, my excellent young
friend, without he&s;itation, without a &s;hadow of appre|hen&s;ion
for her happine&s;s! though &s;he is all the fonde&s;t
father can wi&s;h;&mdash;and though &s;he only who gave her
to me is dearer!&endq;</P>
<P>Felicity and tenderne&s;s were now the &s;ole gue&s;ts in
the brea&s;t of Edgar. He ki&s;&s;ed with reverence the hand
of Mr. Tyrold, called him by the honoured and endear|ing
title of father; acknowledged that, from the earli|e&s;t
period of ob&s;ervation, Camilla had &s;eemed to him
the mo&s;t amiable of human creatures; &s;poke with the
warm devotion he &s;incerely felt for her of Mrs. Tyrold;
and was breatning &s;orth his very &s;oul in tender rapture
upon his happy pro&s;pects, when &s;omething between a
&s;igh and a groan from the baronet, made him ha&s;tily
turn round, apologi&s;e for not &s;ooner addre&s;&s;ing him, and
re&s;pectfully &s;olicit his con&s;$nt.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was in an agitation of delight and &s;urpri&s;e
almo&s;t too potent for his &s;trength. &startq;The Lord be
good unto me,&endq; he cried; &startq;have I lived to &s;ee &s;uch
a day as this!&endq; Then, throwing his arms about Ed|gar's
neck, while his eyes were fa&s;t filling with tears,
which &s;oon ran plentifully down his cheeks, &startq;Good
young Mr. Edgar!&endq; he cried; &startq;good- young man!
and do you really love my poor Camilla, for all her not
<PB N="279" REF="80">
being worth a penny? And will my dear little darling
come to &s;o good an end at la&s;t, after being di&s;inherited
for doing nothing? And will you never vex her, nor
&s;peak an unkind word to her? Indeed, young Mr. Ed|gar,
you are a noble boy! you are indeed; and I love
you to the bottom of my old heart for this true good
naturedne&s;s!&endq;</P>
<P>Then, again and again embracing him, &startq;This is all
of a piece,&endq; he continued, &startq;with your &s;aving my
poor old Rover, which is a thing I &s;hall never forget to
my longe&s;t day, being a remarkable &s;ign of a good heart;
the poor dog having done nothing to offend, as we can
all te&s;tify. So that it's a &s;urpri&s;ing thing what that
ma&s;tiff owed him &s;uch a grudge for.&endq;</P>
<P>Then quitting him abruptly to embrace Mr. Tyrold,
&startq;My dear brother,&endq; he cried, &startq;I hope your judg|ment
approves this thing, as well as my &s;i&s;ter's, when
&s;he comes to hear it, which I &s;hall &s;end off expre&s;s, be|fore
I &s;leep another wink, for fear of accidents.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Approved,&endq; an&s;wered Mr. Tyrold, with a look
of the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive kindne&s;s at Edgar, &startq;is too cold
a word; I rejoice, even thankfully rejoice, to place my
dear child in &s;uch worthy and beloved hands.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then,&endq; cried the enchanted baronet, &startq;if
that's the ca&s;e, that we are all of one mind, we had
better &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s at once, all of us being &s;ubject
to die by delay.&endq;</P>
<P>He then rang the bell, and ordered Jacob to &s;ummon
Camilla to the parlour, adding, &startq;And all the re&s;t too,
Jacob, for I have &s;omething to tell them every one,
which, I make no doubt, they will be very glad to
hear, your&s;elf included, as well as your fellow-&s;ervants,
who have no right to be left out; only let my niece
come fir&s;t, being her own affair.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla obeyed not the call without many &s;ecret &s;en|&s;ations
of di&s;tre&s;s and difficulty, but which, mingled
with the more obvious ones of mode&s;ty and embarra&s;&s;|ment,
all pa&s;&s;ed for a flutter of &s;pirits that appeared na|tural
to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold could only &s;ilently embrace her: know|ing
what &s;he had &s;uffered, and judging thence the exce&s;s
<PB N="280" REF="81">
of her pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction, he would not add to her con|fu&s;ion
by any information of his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; but the
&s;oftne&s;s with which he held her to his bo&s;om &s;poke,
beyond all words, his heartfelt &s;ympathy in her happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Camilla had no power to draw her&s;elf from his arms;
but Edgar hovered round her, and Sir Hugh repeatedly
and impatiently demanded to have his turn. Mr. Ty|rold,
gently di&s;engaging him&s;elf from her embraces,
gave one of her hands to Edgar, who, with grateful
joy, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips. &startq;My children!&endq; he then
&s;aid, laying a hand upon the &s;houlder of each, &startq;what
a &s;ight is this to me! how precious a union! what will
it be to your excellent mother! So long and &s;o deci|dedly
it has been our favourite earthly wi&s;h, that, were
&s;he but re&s;tored to me&mdash;to her country and to her fa|mily&mdash;I
might, perhaps, require &s;ome new evil to pre|vent
my forgetting where&mdash;and what I am!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear brother, I &s;ay! my dear niece! My
dear Mr. young Edgar!&endq; cried Sir Hugh, in the high|e&s;t
good humour, though with nearly exhau&s;ted pati|ence,
&startq;won't you let me put in a word? nor &s;o much
as give you my ble&s;&s;ing? though I can hardly hold life
and &s;oul together for the &s;ake of my joy!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla ca&s;t her&s;elf into his arms, he ki&s;&s;ed her mo&s;t
fondly, &s;aying: &startq;Don't forget your poor old uncle,
my dear little girl, for the account of this young Mr.
Edgar, becau&s;e, good as he is, he has taken to you but
a &s;hort time in compari&s;on with me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &s;till tenaciou&s;ly retaining the
hand parentally be&s;towed upon him; &startq;no, dear Sir
Hugh, I wi&s;h not to rob you of your darling. I wi&s;h
but to be admitted my&s;elf into this dear and re&s;pected
family, and to have Etherington, Cleves, and Beech
Park, con&s;idered as our alternate and common habita|tions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are the very be&s;t young man in the whole wide
world!&endq; cried Sir Hugh, almo&s;t &s;obbing with ec&s;ta&s;y;
&startq;for you have hit upon ju&s;t the very thing I was think|ing
of in my own private mind! What a mercy it is
our not accepting that young Captain, who would have
<PB N="281" REF="82">
run away with her to I don't know where, in&s;tead of
being married to the very neare&s;t e&s;tate in the county,
that will always be living with us!&endq;</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the family now, obedient to the directi|on
of Jacob, who had intimated that &s;omething extra|ordinary
was going forward, entered the room.</P>
<P>&startq;Come in, come in,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, &startq;and hear
the good news; for we have ju&s;t been upon the very
point of lo&s;ing the be&s;t opportunity that ever we had in
our lives of all living together: which, I hope, we &s;hall
now do, without any more &s;trangers coming upon us
with their company, being a thing we don't de&s;ire.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But what's the good news, uncle?&endq; &s;aid Indiana;
&startq;is it only about our living together?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes, my dear, that's the fir&s;t principal,
and the other is, that young Mr. Edgar's going to marry
Camilla; which I hope you won't take ill, liking being
all fancy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me?&endq; cried &s;he, with a di&s;dainful to&s;s of the head,
though &s;everely mortified; &startq;it's nothing to me, I'm
&s;ure!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla a&s;hamed, and Edgar embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;trove now
mutually to &s;hew Sir Hugh they wi&s;hed no more might
be &s;aid: but he only embraced them again, and declar|ed
he had never been &s;o full of joy before in his whole
life, and would not be cut &s;hort.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, extremely piqued, vently her &s;pleen
in oblique &s;arca&s;ms, and &s;ought to heal her offended
pride by appeals for ju&s;tice to her &s;agacity and fore&s;ight
in the whole bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Jacob, now, opening the door, &s;aid all the &s;ervants
were come.</P>
<P>Camilla tried to e&s;cape; but Sir Hugh would not per|mit
her, and the hou&s;e-heeper and butler led the way,
followed by every other dome&s;tic of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my friends,&endq; he cried, wi&s;h her joy, which
I am &s;ure you will do of your own accord, for &s;he's
going to be mi&s;tre&s;s of Beech-Park; which I thought
would have been the ca&s;e with my other niece, till I
found out my mi&s;take; which is of no con&s;equence
<PB N="282" REF="83">
now, all having ended for the be&s;t; though unknown
to us poor mortals.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;ervants obeyed with alacrity, and offered their
hearty congratulations to the blu&s;hing Camilla and hap|py
Edgar, Molly Mill excepted; who, having conclud|ed
Sir Sedley Clarendel the man, doubted her own &s;en|&s;es,
and, in&s;tead of open felicitations, whi&s;pered Ca|milla,
&startq;Dear Mi&s;s, I've got another letter for you!
It's here in my bo&s;om.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, frightened, &s;aid: &startq;Hu&s;h! hu&s;h!&endq; while
Edgar, imagining the girl, who&s;e &s;implicity and talka|tivene&s;s
were familiar to him, had &s;aid &s;omething ridi|culous,
intreated to be indulged with hearing her re|mark:
but &s;eeing Camilla look grave, forbore to pre&s;s
his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The baronet now began an harangue upon the happi|ne&s;s
that would accrue from the&s;e double unions, for
which he a&s;&s;ured them they &s;hould have double remem|brances,
though the &s;ame preparations would do for
both, as he meant they &s;hould take place at the &s;ame
time, provided Mr. Edgar would have the obligingne&s;s
to wait for a fair wind, which he was expecting every
hour.</P>
<P>Camilla could now &s;tay no longer: nor could Edgar,
though adoring the hearty joy of Sir Hugh, refu&s;e to
aid her in ab&s;conding.</P>
<P>He begged her permi&s;&s;ion to follow, as &s;oon as it
might be po&s;&s;ible, which &s;he tacitly accorded. She was
impatient her&s;elf for the important conference &s;he was
planning, and felt, with increa&s;ing &s;olicitude, that all
her life's happine&s;s hung upon her power to extricate
her&s;elf honourably from the terrible embarra&s;&s;ment in
which &s;he was involved.</P>
<P>She &s;auntered about the hall till the &s;ervants came
out, anxious to receive the letter which Molly Mill had
announced. They all &s;ought to &s;urround her with fre&s;h
good wi&s;hes; but &s;he &s;ingled out Molly, and begged the
re&s;t to leave her for the pre&s;ent. The letter, however,
was not unpinned from the in&s;ide of Molly's neck
handkerchief, before Edgar, eager and gay, joined
her.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="84">
Trembling then, &s;he intreated her to make ha&s;te.</P>
<P>&startq;La, Mi&s;s,&endq; an&s;wered the girl, &startq;if you hurry me
&s;o, I &s;hall tear it as &s;ure as can be; and what will you
&s;ay then, Mi&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well&mdash;then&mdash;another time will do&mdash;take it to
my room.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, Mi&s;s; the gentleman told Tommy Hodd
he wanted an an&s;wer as quick as can be; he &s;aid, if
Tommy'd come a-hor&s;eback, he'd pay for the hor&s;e, to
make him quicker; and Tommy &s;ays he always behaves
very hand&s;ome.&endq;</P>
<P>She then gave her the &s;queezed billet. Camilla, in
great confu&s;ion, put it into her pocket. Edgar, who
even unavoidably heard what pa&s;&s;ed, held back till Molly
retired; and then, with an air of undi&s;gui&s;ed &s;urpri&s;e
and curio&s;ity, though in a laughing tone, &s;aid, &startq;Mu&s;t
not the letter be read till I make my bow?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes,&endq;&mdash;cried &s;he, &s;tammering, &startq;it may be
read&mdash;at any time.&endq; And &s;he put her hand in her
pocket to re-produce it. But the idea of making known
the &s;trange aad unexpected hi&s;tory &s;he had to relate, by
&s;hewing &s;o &s;trange a corre&s;pondence, without one lead|ing
and &s;oftening previous circum&s;tance, required a force
and confidence of which &s;he was not mi&s;tre&s;s. She
twi&s;ted it, therefore, ha&s;tily round, to hide the hand|writing
of the direction, and, then, with the &s;ame care,
rolled it up, and encircled it with her fingers.</P>
<P>&startq;Shall I be jealous?&endq; &s;aid he, gently, though di&s;ap|pointed.</P>
<P>&startq;You have much rea&s;on!&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, with a
&s;mile &s;o &s;oft, it di&s;per&s;ed every fear, yet with an atten|tion
&s;o careful to conceal the addre&s;s, that it kept alive
every wonder. He took her other hand, and, ki&s;&s;ing
it cried: &startq;No, &s;weete&s;t Camilla, &s;uch unworthy di&s;|tru&s;t
&s;hall make no part of our compact. Yet I own
my&s;elf a little intere&s;ted to know what gentleman has
obtained a privilege I &s;hould my&s;elf prize above almo&s;t
any other. I will leave you, however, to read the
letter, and, perhaps, before you an&s;wer it&mdash;but no&mdash;
I will a&s;k nothing; I &s;hall lo&s;e all plea&s;ure in your con|fidence,
<PB N="284" REF="85">
if it is not &s;pontaneous. I will go and find
your &s;i&s;ters.&endq;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t impul&s;e of Camilla was, to commit to him
immediately the unopened letter: but the fear of its
contents, its &s;tile, its requi&s;itions, made her terror over|power
her genero&s;ity; and, though &s;he looked after him
with regret, &s;he &s;tood &s;till to break the &s;eal of her letter.</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>SEDLEY CLARENDEL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The immediate pre&s;ence of Edgar him&s;elf could not
have made this letter die the cheeks of Camilla of a
deeper red. She &s;aw that Sir Sedley thought her only
coqueti&s;hly trifling, and &s;he looked forward with nearly
equal horror to clearing up a mi&s;take that might
embitter his future life, and to acknowledging to
Edgar&mdash;the &s;crupulous, the &s;crutini&s;ing, the de|licate
Edgar&mdash;that &s;uch a mi&s;take could have been
formed.</P>
<P>She was ruminating upon this formidable, this ter|rible
ta&s;k, when Edgar again appeared, accompanied
by her &s;i&s;ters. She hurried the letter into her pocket.
Edgar &s;aw the action with a concern that dampt his
<PB N="285" REF="86">
&s;pirits: he wi&s;hed to obtain from her immediately the
unlimited tru&s;t, which immediately, and for ever, he
meant to repo&s;e in her They all &s;trolled together for
a &s;hort time in the park; but &s;he was anxious to retreat
to her room, and her &s;i&s;ters were dying with impatience
to read Sir Sedley's letter Edgar, di&s;turbed to &s;ee
how little any of their countenances accorded with the
happy feelings he had &s;o recently experienced, propo&s;ed
not to lengthen the walk, but flattered him&s;elf, upon
re-entering the hou&s;e, Camilla would afford him a few
minutes of explanation. But &s;he only, with a faint
&s;mile, &s;aid &s;he &s;hould &s;oon return to the parlour; and
he &s;aw Molly Mill eagerly waiting for her upon the
&s;tairs, and heard her, in reply to &s;ome que&s;tion con|cerning
Tommy Hodd, de&s;ire the girl to be quiet till &s;he
got to her room.</P>
<P>Edgar could form no idea of what all this meant,
yet, that &s;ome &s;ecret di&s;turbance preyed upon Camilla,
that &s;ome gentleman wrote to her, and expected im|patiently
an an&s;wer; and that the corre&s;pondence pa&s;|&s;ed
neither through her friends, nor by the po&s;t, but by
the medium of Molly Mill, were circum&s;tances not le&s;s
unaccountable than unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Camilla, meanwhile, produced the letter to her
&s;i&s;ters, be&s;eeching their able&s;t coun&s;el. &startq;See but,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;how dreadfully unprepared is Sir Sedley
for the event of the day! And oh!&mdash;how yet more
unprepared mu&s;t be Edgar for &s;eeing that &s;uch a letter
could ever be addre&s;&s;ed to me! How &s;hall I &s;hew it
him, my dear &s;i&s;ters? how help his believing I mu&s;t
have given every po&s;&s;ible encouragement, ere Sir Sed|ley
could have written to me in &s;o a&s;&s;ured a &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Much deliberation en&s;ued; but they were all &s;o per|plexed,
that they were &s;ummoned to tea before they had
come to any re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el of Eugenia, then, prevailed; and it
was &s;ettled, that Camilla &s;hould avoid, for the pre&s;ent,
any communication to Edgar, le&s;t it &s;hould lead to mi&s;|chief
between him and the young Barotet, who could
not but be mutually di&s;plea&s;ed with each other; and
<PB N="286" REF="87">
that the next morning, before &s;he &s;aw Edgar again, &s;he
&s;hould &s;et out for the Grove, and there ca&s;t her&s;elf
wholly upon the genero&s;ity of Sir Sedley; and, when
freed from all engagement, return, and relate, without
re&s;erve, the whole hi&s;tory to Edgar; who would &s;o
&s;oon be brother of her brother, that he would pardon
the faults of Lionel, and who would then be in no
danger him&s;elf from per&s;onal conte&s;t or di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with
Sir Sedley. She wrote, therefore, one line, to &s;ay &s;he
would &s;ee Mrs. Arlbery early the next day, and de|livered
it to Molly Mill; who promi&s;ed to borrow a
hor&s;e of the under-groom, that Tommy Hodd might
be back before bed-time, without any obligation to Sir
Sedley.</P>
<P>She, then, went down &s;tairs; when Edgar di&s;ap|pointed
by her long ab&s;ence, &s;ought vainly to recom|pen&s;e
it by conver&s;ing with her. She was gentle, but
&s;eated her&s;elf aloof, and avoided his eyes.</P>
<P>His de&s;ire to unravel &s;o much my&s;tery he thought now
&s;o legitimated by his peculiar &s;ituation, that he was fre|quently
upon the point of &s;oliciting for information:
but, to know him&s;elf privileged, upon further reflection,
was &s;ufficient to in&s;ure his forbearance. Even when
that knot was tied which would give to him all power,
he &s;incerely meant to owe all her tru&s;t to willing commu|nication.
Should he now, then, make her deem him
exacting, and tenacious of prerogative? no; it might
&s;hackle the freedom of her mind in their future inter|cour&s;e.
He would quietly, therefore, wait her own
time, and &s;ubmit to her own inclination. She could not
doubt his impatience; he would not compel her gene|ro&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Triumph of Pride.</HEAD>
<P>THE three &s;i&s;ters were retired, at night, to ano|ther
council in the room of Camilla, when Molly Mill,
with a look of di&s;may, bur&s;t in upon them, bringing,
with the an&s;wer of Sir Sedley, news that Tommy
Hodd, by an accident he could not help, had rode the
hor&s;e &s;he had borowed for him of the under-groom to
death.</P>
<P>The di&s;may, now, &s;pread equally to them all.
What a tale would this misfortune unfold to Sir Hugh,
to Edgar, to the whole hou&s;e! the debt of Lionel,
the corre&s;pondence with Sir Sedley, the expectations
of the young Baronet&mdash;Camilla could not &s;upport it,
&s;he &s;ent for Jacob to own to him the affair, and beg his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Jacob, though getting into bed, obeyed the call.
He was, however, &s;o much irritated at the lo&s;s of the
hor&s;e, and the boldne&s;s of the under-groom, in lending
him without leave, that, at fir&s;t, he would li&s;ten to no
intreaties, and prote&s;ted that both the boy and Molly
Mill &s;hould be complained of to his ma&s;ter. The elo|quence,
however, of his three young mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, for &s;o
all the nieces of Sir Hugh were called by the &s;er|vants
at Cleves, &s;oon &s;oftened his ire; he almo&s;t
adored his ma&s;ter, and was affectionately attached to
the young family. They begged him, therefore, to
buy another hor&s;e as like it as po&s;&s;ible, and to con|trive
not to employ it when Sir Hugh was in &s;ight,
till they were able to clear up the hi&s;tory to their uncle
them&s;elves: this would not be difficult, as the Baronet
rarely vi&s;ited his &s;tables, &s;ince his fall, from the me|lancholy
<PB N="288" REF="89">
with which he was filled by the &s;ight of his
hor&s;es.</P>
<P>There was to be a fair of cattle in the neighbourhood
the next day, and Jacob promi&s;ed to ride over to &s;ee
what bargain he could make for them.</P>
<P>They then inquired about what money would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>The co&s;t&punc; he &s;aid, of poor Tom Jones was 40l.</P>
<P>Camilla held up her hands, almo&s;t &s;creaming. Eu|genia,
with more pre&s;ence of mind, &s;aid they would
&s;ee him again in the morning before he went, and
then told Molly Mill to wait for her in her own
room.</P>
<P>&startq;What can I now do?&endq; cried Camilla; &startq;I would
not add the hi&s;tory of this dreadful expence to the &s;ad
tale I have already to relate to Edgar for the univer&s;e!
To begin my career by &s;uch a &s;tring of humiliations
would be in&s;upportable. Already I owe five guineas to
Mrs. Arlbery, which the tumult of my mind &s;ince my
return has prevented me from naming to my uncle; and
I have left debts at Tunbridge that will probably take up
all my next quarter's allowance!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As far as the&s;e three guineas will go,&endq; &s;aid Lavi|nia,
taking out her pur&s;e, &startq;here, my deare&s;t Camilla,
they are;&mdash;but how little that is? I never before
thought my pittance too &s;mall! yet how well we all
know my dear father cannot augment it.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, who, in ha&s;te, had &s;tept to her own room,
$ow came back and putting twenty guineas into the
hand of Camilla, &s;aid: &startq;This, my beloved &s;i&s;ter, is
all I now have by me; but Jacob is rich and good, and
will rejoice to pay the re&s;t for us at pre&s;ent; and I &s;hall
very &s;oon reimbur&s;e him, for my uncle has in&s;i&s;ted upon
making me a very con&s;iderable pre&s;ent, which I &s;hall
now, no longer refu&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla bur&s;t into tears, and, hanging about their
necks: &startq;O my &s;i&s;ters,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;what goodne&s;s
is yours! but how can I avail my&s;elf of it with any ju&s;tice?
Your three guineas, my Lavinia, your little all&mdash;how can
I bear to take?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="90">
&startq;Do not teach me to repine, my dear Camilla, that
I have no more! I am &s;ure of being remembered by
my uncle on the approaching occa&s;ions, and I can never,
therefore, better &s;pare my little &s;tore.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are all kindne&s;s! and you, my dear Eugenia,
though you have more, have claims upon that more, and
are both expected and u&s;ed to an&s;wer them&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, I have indeed more!&endq; interrupted Eugenia,
&startq;which only &s;i&s;ters good as mine could pardon; but
becau&s;e my uncle has made me his heire&s;s, has he made
me a brute? No! whatever I have, mu&s;t be among&s;t
us all in common, not only now, but&mdash;&endq; She &s;topt,
affrighted at the idea &s;he was pre&s;enting to her&s;elf, and
&s;ervently cla&s;ping her hands, exclaimed: &startq;O long&mdash;
long may it be ere I can &s;hew my &s;i&s;ters all I feel for
them! they will believe it, I am &s;ure&mdash;and that is far
happier!&endq;</P>
<P>The idea this rai&s;ed &s;truck them all, at the &s;ame
moment, to the heart. Not one of them had dry eyes,
and with a &s;adne&s;s overpowering every other con&s;ider|ation,
they &s;ighed as heavily, and with looks as di&s;|con&s;olate,
as if the uncle &s;o dear to them were already
no more.</P>
<P>The influence of parts, the predominance of know|ledge,
the honour of learning, the captivation of ta|lents,
and even the charm of fame it&s;elf, all &s;hrink in
their effects before the &s;uperior force of goodne&s;s, even
where mo&s;t &s;imple and uncultivated, for power over
the &s;ocial affections.</P>
<P>At an early hour, the next morning, the commi&s;|&s;ion,
with the twenty guineas in hand, and the promi&s;e
of the re&s;t in a &s;hort time, were given to Jacob; and
Camilla, then, begged permi&s;&s;ion of her father, and the
carriage of her uncle, to vi&s;it Mrs. Arlbery, who, &s;he
had heard, was ju&s;t returned to the Grove.</P>
<P>Concluding &s;he wi&s;hed to be the me&s;&s;enger of her
own affairs to that lady, they made no oppo&s;ition, and
&s;he &s;et off before eight o'clock, without entering the
<PB N="290" REF="91">
parlour, where Edgar, &s;he was informed, was already
arrived for breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>The little journey was terrible to her; &s;cenes of di&s;|appointment
and de&s;pair on the part of Sir Sedley, were
anticipated by her alarmed imagination, and &s;he re|proached
her&s;elf for every word &s;he had ever &s;poken,
every look &s;he had ever given, that could have rai&s;ed
any pre&s;umption of her regard.</P>
<P>The la&s;t note was written in the &s;tyle of all the
others, and not one ever expre&s;&s;ed the &s;malle&s;t doubt of
&s;ucce&s;s; how dreadful then to break to him &s;uch news,
at the very moment he might imagine &s;he came to meet
him with partial plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was not yet ri&s;en. Camilla inquired,
&s;tammering, if any company were at the hou&s;e. None,
was the an&s;wer. She then begged leave to walk in the
garden till Mrs. Arlbery came down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>She was not &s;orry to mi&s;s her; &s;he dreaded her yet
more than Sir Sedley him&s;elf, and hoped to &s;ee him
a one.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;he remained a full hour in waiting,
ruminating upon the wonder her di&s;appearance would
give to Edgar, and nearly per&s;uaded &s;ome chance had
anticipated her account to Sir Sedley, who&s;e rage and
grief were too violent to &s;uffer him to keep his appoint|ment.</P>
<P>This idea &s;erved but to add to her perturbation,
when, at la&s;t, &s;he &s;aw him enter the garden.</P>
<P>All pre&s;ence of mind then for&s;ook her; &s;he looked
around to &s;ee if &s;he could e&s;cape, but his approach was
too quick for avoidance. Her eyes, unable to encoun|ter
his, were bent upon the ground, and &s;he &s;tood &s;till,
and even trembling, till he reached her.</P>
<P>To the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed notions and vain character of Sir
Sedley, the&s;e were &s;ymptoms by no means di&s;couraging;
with a confidence almo&s;t amounting to arrogance he
advanced, pitying her di&s;tre&s;s, yet pitying him&s;elf &s;till
more for the &s;nare in which it was involving him. He
permitted his eyes for a moment to fa&s;ten upon her, to
admire her, and to enjoy triumphantly her confu&s;ion
in &s;ilence: &startq;Ah, beauteous tyrant!&endq; he then cried;

thy lacerating barbarity?&endq;</P>
<P>He then, almo&s;t by force, took her hand; &s;he &s;trug|gled
eagerly to recover it, but &startq;No,&endq; he cried,
&startq;fair torturer! it is now my pri&s;oner, and mu&s;t
be puni&s;hed for its inhuman &s;ins, in the congeal|ing
and unmerciful lines it has portrayed for me.&endq;</P>
<P>And then, regardle&s;s of her re&s;i&s;tance, which he
attributed to mere ba&s;hfulne&s;s, he ob&s;tinately and in|ce&s;&s;antly
devoured it with ki&s;&s;es, in defiance of op|po&s;ition,
&s;upplication, or anger, till, &s;uddenly and pier|cingly,
&s;he &s;tartled him with a &s;cream, and &s;natched it
away with a force irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>Amazed, he &s;tared at her. Her face was almo&s;t
convul&s;ed with emotion; but her eyes, which appeared
to be fixed, directed him to the cau&s;e. At the bottom
of the walk, which was only a few yards di&s;tant, &s;tood
Mandlebert.</P>
<P>Pale and motionle&s;s, he looked as if bereft of &s;trength
and faculties. Camilla had &s;een him the moment &s;he
rai&s;ed her eyes, and her horror was uncontrollable.
Sir Sedley, a&s;toni&s;hed at what he beheld, a&s;toni&s;hed
what to think, drew back, with a &s;upercilious kind of
bow. Edgar, recalled by what he thought in&s;olence
to his recollection, advanced a few &s;teps, and addre&s;&s;|ing
him&s;elf to Camilla, &s;aid: &startq;I had the commands
of Sir Hugh to pur&s;ue you, Mi&s;s Tyrold, to give you
immediate notice that Mr. Lynmere is arrived.&endq; He
added no more, deigned not a look at Sir Sedley, but
rapidly retreated, remounted his hor&s;e and gallopped
off.</P>
<P>Camilla looked after him till he was out of &s;ight,
with uplifted hands and eyes, deploring his departure,
his mi&s;take, and his re&s;entment, without courage to
attempt &s;topping him.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley &s;tood &s;u&s;pended, how to act, what to
judge. If Edgar's was the di&s;plea&s;ure of a di&s;carded
lover, why &s;hould it &s;o affect Camilla? if of a &s;ucce&s;s|ful
one, why came &s;he to meet him? why had &s;he re|ceived
and an&s;wered his notes?</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="93">
Finding &s;he attempted neither to &s;peak nor move,
be again approached her, and &s;aying, &startq;Fair Incom|prehen&s;ible!&mdash;&endq;
would again have taken her hand;
but rou&s;ing to a &s;en&s;e of her &s;ituation, &s;he drew back,
and with &s;ome dignity, but more agitation, cried:
&startq;Sir Sedley, I blu&s;h if I am culpable of any part of
your mi&s;take: but &s;uffer me now to be explicit, and
let me be fully, finally, and not too late under&s;tood.
You mu&s;t write to me no more; I cannot an&s;wer nor
read your letters. You mu&s;t &s;peak to me no more,
except in public &s;ociety; you mu&s;t go further, Sir
Sedley&mdash;you mu&s;t think of me no more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Horrible!&endq; cried he, &s;tarting back; &startq;you di&s;|tre&s;s
me pa&s;t mea&s;ure!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, no, you will &s;oon&mdash;ea&s;ily&mdash;readily for|get
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Inhuman! you make me unhappy pa&s;t thought!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed I am inexpre&s;&s;ibly concerned; but the
whole affair&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hock, you annihilate me, you injure me in
the tendere&s;t point!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now, amazed, cried, &startq;what is it you
mean, &s;ir?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;By inve&s;ting me, fair barbarian, with the teme|rity
of forming any claim that can call for repul&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>Utterly confounded by &s;o unexpected a di&s;claiming
of all de&s;ign, &s;he again, though from far different fen|&s;ations,
ca&s;t up her eyes and hands. And is it, &s;he
thought, for a trifler &s;uch as this, &s;o unmeaning, &s;o
unfeeling, I have ri&s;ked my whole of hope and hap|pine&s;s?</P>
<P>She &s;aid, however, no more; for what more could
be &s;aid? She coloured, pa&s;t him, and ha&s;tily quitting
the garden, told the footman to apologi&s;e to Mrs. Arl|bery
for her &s;udden departure, by informing her that
a near relation was ju&s;t arrived from abroad; and
then got into the carriage and drove back to Cleves.</P>
<P>Sir Sedley followed carele&s;sly, yet without aiming
at overtaking her, and intreated, negligently, to be
heard, yet &s;aid nothing which required the &s;malle&s;t
an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="94">
Piqued completely, and mortified to the quick,
by the conviction which now broke in upon him of
the &s;uperior a&s;cendance of Mandlebert, he could not
brook to have been thought in earne&s;t when he &s;aw he
&s;hould not have been accepted, nor pardon his own va|nity
the affront it had brought upon his pride. He
&s;ung aloud an opera air till the carriage of Sir Hugh
was out of &s;ight, and then drove his phaeton to Claren|del-place,

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Summons to Happine&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA had but ju&s;t &s;et out from Cleves, when
Sir Hugh, con&s;ulting his weather-cocks, which a new
chain of ideas had made him forget to examine, &s;aw
that the wind was fair for the voyage of his nephew;
and heard, upon inquiry, that the favourable change
had taken place the preceding day, though the general
confu&s;ion of the hou&s;e had prevented it from being
heeded by any of the family.</P>
<P>With eagerne&s;s the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive, he went to the
room of Eugenia, and bid her put on a &s;mart hat to
walk out with him, as there was no knowing how &s;oon
a certain per&s;on might arrive.</P>
<P>Eugenia, colouring, &s;aid &s;he would rather &s;tay
within.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="95">
&startq;Well,&endq; cried he, &startq;you'll be neater, to be &s;ure,
for not blowing about in the wind; &s;o I'll go take
t'other girls.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, left alone, became exceedingly fluttered.
She could not bear to remain in the hou&s;e under the
notion of &s;o degrading a con&s;ideration as owing any
advantage to outward appearance; and fearing her
uncle, in his extreme openne&s;s, &s;hould give that rea&s;on
for her not walking, &s;he determined to take a &s;troll by
her&s;elf in the park.</P>
<P>She bent her &s;teps towards a &s;mall wood at &s;ome di&s;|tance
from the hou&s;e, where &s;he meant to re&s;t her&s;elf
and read; for &s;he had learnt of Dr. Orkborne never to
be unprovided with a book: But &s;he had not yet reach|ed
her place of intended repo&s;e, when the &s;ound of feet
made her turn round, and, to her utter con&s;ternation,
&s;he &s;aw a young man, who&s;e boots, whip, and foreign
air, announced in&s;tantly to be Clermont Lynmere.</P>
<P>She doubted not but he was &s;ent in pur&s;uit of her;
and though youthful timidity prompted her to &s;hun him,
&s;he retained &s;ufficient command over her&s;elf to check
it, and to &s;top till he came up to her; while he, nei|ther
quickening nor &s;lackening his pace as he approach|ed,
pa&s;&s;ed her with &s;o little attention, that &s;he was pre|&s;ently
convinced he had &s;carce even perceived her.</P>
<P>Di&s;concerted by a meeting &s;o &s;trange, and &s;o ill
timed, &s;he involuntarily &s;tood &s;till, without any other
power than that of looking after him.</P>
<P>In a few minutes Molly Mill, running up to her,
cried: &startq;Dear Mi&s;s, have not you &s;een young Mr.
Lynmere? He come by t'other way ju&s;t as ma&s;ter, and
Mi&s;s Margland, and Mi&s;s Lynmere, and Mi&s;s Ty|rold,
was gone to meet him by the great gate; and
&s;o he &s;aid he$d come and look who he could find him|&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia had merely voice to order her back. The
notion of having a figure &s;o in&s;ignificant as to be pa&s;&s;ed,
without even exciting a doubt whom &s;he might be, was
cruelly mortifying. She knew not how to return to
the hou&s;e, and relate &s;uch an incident. She &s;at down
under a tree to recollect her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="96">
Pre&s;ently, however, &s;he &s;aw the &s;tranger turn quick
about, and before &s;he could ri&s;e, &s;lightly touching his
hat, without looking at her: &startq;Pray, ma'am,&endq; he &s;aid,
&startq;do you belong to that hou&s;e?&endq; pointing to the man|&s;ion
of Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>Faintly &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;Yes, &s;ir;&endq; and he then ad|ded:
&startq;I am ju&s;t arrived, and in &s;earch of Sir Hugh
and the young ladies; one of them they told me, was
this way; but I can trace nobody. Have you &s;een any
of them?&endq;</P>
<P>More and more confounded, &s;he could make no re|ply.
Inattentive to her embarra&s;&s;ment, and &s;till look|ing
every way around, he repeated his que&s;tion. She
then pointed towards the great gate, &s;tammering &s;he
believed they went that way. &startq;Thank you;&endq; he an|&s;wered,
with a nod, and then hurried off.</P>
<P>She now thought no more of moving nor of ri&s;ing;
&s;he felt a kind of &s;tupor, in which, fixed, and without
reflection, &s;he remained, till, &s;tartled by the &s;ound of
her uncle's voice, &s;he got up, made what ha&s;te &s;he was
able to the hou&s;e by a private path, and a&s;cended to
her own room by a back &s;tair-ca&s;e.</P>
<P>That an interview to which &s;he had &s;o long looked
forward, for which, with unwearied a&s;&s;iduity, &s;he had
&s;o many years laboured to prepare her&s;elf, and which
was the declared precur&s;or of the mo&s;t important aera of
her life, &s;hould pa&s;s over &s;o abruptly, and be circum|&s;tanced
&s;o aukwardly, equally di&s;pirited and confu&s;ed
her.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, Molly Mill, entering, &s;aid:
&startq;They're all come back, and Sir Hugh's fit to eat the
young &s;quire up; and no wonder, for he's a &s;weet
proper gentleman, as ever I &s;ee. Come, mi&s;s, I hope
you'll put on &s;omething el&s;e, for that hat makes you
look wor&s;e than any thing. I would not have the young
&s;quire &s;ee you &s;uch a figure for never &s;o much.&endq;</P>
<P>The artle&s;&s;ne&s;s of unadorned truth, however &s;ure in
theory of extorting admiration, rarely, in practice,
fails inflicting pain or mo$$ification. The &s;imple ho|ne&s;ty
of Molly redoubled the chagrin of her young
mi&s;tre&s;s, who, &s;ending her away, went anxiou&s;ly to
<PB N="296" REF="97">
the looking-gla&s;s, whence, in a few moments, &s;he
perceived her uncle, from the window, laughing, and
making &s;ignificant &s;igns to &s;ome one out of her &s;ight.
Extremely a&s;hamed to be &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;he retreated to
the other end of the room, though not till &s;he had
heard Sir Hugh &s;ay: &startq;Ay, ay, &s;he's getting ready
for you; I told you why &s;he would not walk out
with us, &s;o don't let's hurry her, though I can't but
commend your being a little impatient, which I dare
&s;ay &s;o is &s;he, only young girls can't &s;o well talk about
it.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia now found that Clermont had no &s;u&s;picion
he had &s;een her. Sir Hugh concluded &s;he had left not
her room, and a&s;ked no que&s;tions that could lead to the
di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently the baronet came up &s;taris him&s;elf, and
tapping at the door, &s;aid. &startq;Come, my dear, don't
be too curious, the breakfa&s;t having been &s;poilt this
hour already; be&s;ides your cou&s;in's having nothing on
him&s;elf but his riding dre&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Happy &s;he could at lea&s;t clear her&s;elf from &s;o dero|gatory
a de&s;ign, &s;he opened her door. Sir Hugh, &s;ur|veying
her with a look of &s;urpri&s;e and vexation, ex|claimed:
&startq;What my dear! an't you dizen'd yet?
why I thought to have &s;een you in all your be&s;t
things!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, &s;ir,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he calmly; &startq;I &s;hall not drefs
till dinner-time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear girl,&endq; cried he, kindly, though a little
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed how to explain him&s;elf; there's no need you
&s;hould look wor&s;e than you can help; though you can
do better things, I know, than looking well at any
time; only what I mean is, you &s;hould let him &s;ee
you to the be&s;t advantage at the fir&s;t, for fear of his
taking any di&s;like before he knows about Dr. Ork|borne,
and that.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Di&s;like, &s;ir!&endq; repeated &s;he, extremely hurt; &startq;if
you think he will take any di&s;like&mdash;I had better not &s;ee
him at all!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear girl, you quite mi&s;take me, owing to my
poor head's always u&s;ing the wrong word; which is a
<PB N="297" REF="98">
remarkable thing that I can't help. But I don't mean
in the lea&s;t to doubt his being plea&s;ed with you, ex|cept
only at the beginning, from not being u&s;ed to
you; for as to all your &s;tudies, there's no more
Greek and Latin in one body's face, than in ano|ther's;
but, however, if you won't dre&s;s, there's
no need to keep the poor boy in hot water for
nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>He then took her hand, and rather dragged than
drew her down &s;tairs, &s;aying as they went: I mu&s;t wi&s;h
you joy, though, for I a&s;&s;ure you he's a very fine lad,
and hardly a bit of a coxcomb.&endq;</P>
<P>The family was all a&s;&s;embled in the parlour, except
Camilla, for whom the baronet had in&s;tantly di&s;patch|ed
Edgar, and Mr. Tyrold, who was not yet returned
from a morning ride, but form whom Sir Hugh had
ordered the great dinner bell to be rung, as a &s;ignal of
&s;omething extraordinary.</P>
<P>Young Lynmere was waiting the arrival of Euge|nia
with avowed and unbridled impatience. Far from
&s;urmi&s;ing it was her he had met in the park, he had
concluded it was one of the maids, and thought of
her no more. He a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions in
a breath when his uncle was gone. Was &s;he tall?
was &s;he &s;hort? was &s;he plump? was &s;he lean?
was &s;he fair? was &s;he brown? was &s;he florid? was &s;he
pale? But as &s;he a&s;ked them of every body, nobody
an&s;wered; yet all were in &s;ome di&s;may at a curio&s;ity
implying &s;uch entire ignorance, except Indiana, who
could not, without &s;impering, fore&s;ee the amaze|ment
of her brother at her cou&s;in's per&s;on and ap|pearance.</P>
<P>&startq;Here's a noble girl for you!&endq; cried Sir Hugh,
opening the door with a flouri&s;h; &startq;for all &s;he's got &s;o
many be&s;t thing's, &s;he's come down in her wor&s;t, for
the &s;ake of looking ill at the beginning, to the end
that there may be no fault to be found afterwards;
which is a wi&s;ene&s;s that does honour to her educa|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>This was, perhaps, the fir&s;t time an harangue from
the baronet had been thought too &s;hort; but the &s;ur|pri&s;e
<PB N="298" REF="99">
of young Lynmere, at the view of his de&s;tined
bride, made him wi&s;h he would &s;peak on, merely to
annul any nece&s;&s;ity for &s;peaking him&s;elf. Eugenia
aimed in vain to recover the calmne&s;s of her na|ture,
or to borrow what might re&s;emble it from her
notions of female dignity. The injudicious &s;peech of
Sir Hugh, by publicly forcing upon the whole party
the &s;ettled purpo&s;e of the interview, covered her with
blu&s;hes, and gave a tremor to her frame that obliged
her precipitately to &s;eat her&s;elf, while her joined hands
&s;upplicated his &s;ilence.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear, well!&endq; &s;aid he, ki&s;&s;ing her,
&startq;don't let me vex you; what I &s;aid having no mean|ing,
except for the be&s;t; though your cou&s;in might as
well have &s;aluted you before you &s;at down, I think;
which, however, I &s;uppo&s;e may be out of fa&s;hion
now, every thing changing &s;ince my time; which,
Lord help me! it will take me long enough to
learn.&endq;</P>
<P>Lynmere noticed not this hint, and they all &s;eat|ed
them&s;elves round the breakfa&s;t table; Sir Hugh
&s;carce able to refrain from crying for joy, and con|tinually
exclaiming: &startq;This is the happie&s;t day of all
my life, for all I've lived &s;o long! To &s;ee us all to|gether,
at la&s;t, and my dear boy come home to his na|tive
old England!&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland made the tea, and young Lynmere
in&s;tantly and almo&s;t voraciou&s;ly began eating of every
thing that was upon the table. Indiana, when &s;he
&s;aw her brother as hand&s;ome as her cou&s;in was de|formed,
thought the contra&s;t &s;o droll, &s;he could look
at neither without tittering; Lavina ob&s;erved, with
extreme concern, the vi&s;ible di&s;tre&s;s of her &s;i&s;ter;
Dr. Orkborne forbore to ruminate upon his work,
in expectation, every moment, of being called upon
to conver&s;e with the learned young traveller; but Sir
Hugh alone &s;poke, though his delight and his loqua|city
joined to his plea&s;ure in remarking the good old
Engli&s;h appetite which his nephew had brought with
<PB N="299" REF="100">
him from foreign parts, prevented his being &s;truck with
the general taciturnity.</P>
<P>The entrance of Mr. Tyrold proved a relief to all
the party, though a pain to him&s;elf. He &s;uffered in &s;ee|ing
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed confu&s;ion of Eugenia, and felt &s;ome|thing
little &s;hort of indignation at the &s;upercilious air
with which Clermont &s;eemed to examine her; hold|ing
his head high and back, as if mea&s;uring his &s;uperior
height, while every line round his mouth marked that
ridicule was but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by contempt.</P>
<P>When Sir Hugh, at length, ob&s;erved, that the young
traveller uttered not a &s;yllable, he exclaimed: &startq;Lord
help us! what fools it makes of us, being overjoyed!
here am I talking all the talk to my&s;elf, while my young
&s;cholar &s;ays nothing! which I take to be owing to my
&s;peaking only Engli&s;h; which, however, I &s;hould not
do, if it was not for the misfortune of knowing no
other, which I can't properly call a fault, being out of
no idlene&s;s, as that gentleman can witne&s;s for me; for
I'll warrant nobody's taken more pains; but our heads
won't always do what we want.&endq;</P>
<P>He then gave a long and melancholy detail of his &s;tu|dies
and their failure.</P>
<P>When the carriage arrived with Camilla, young Lyn|mere
loitered to a window, to look at it; Eugenia aro&s;e
meaning to &s;eize the opportunity to e&s;cape to her room;
but &s;eeing him turn round upon her moving, &s;he again
&s;at down, experiencing, for the fir&s;t time, a &s;en&s;ation
of &s;hame for her lamene&s;s, which, hitherto, &s;he had
regularly borne with fortiude, when &s;he had not forgot|ten
from indifference; neither did &s;he feel &s;pirits to ex|hibit
again, before his tall and &s;trikingly elegant figure,
her diminutive little per&s;on.</P>
<P>Camilla entered with traces of a di&s;ordered mind too
&s;trongly marked in her countenance to have e&s;caped ob&s;er|vation,
had &s;he been looked at with any attention. But
Eugenia and Lynmere ingro&s;&s;ed all eyes and all thoughts.
Even her&s;elf, at fir&s;t &s;ight of the hu&s;band elect of her
&s;i&s;ter, lo&s;t, for a moment, all per&s;onal con&s;ideration,
and looked at him only with the intere&s;ting idea of the
future fate of Eugenia. But it was only for a moment;
when &s;he turned round, and &s;aw nothing of Edgar,
<PB N="300" REF="101">
when her uncle's inquiry what had become of him con|vinced
her he was gone el&s;ewhere, her heart &s;unk, &s;he
$elt &s;ick, and would have glided out of the room, had
not Sir Hugh, thinking her faint for want of her breakfa&s;t,
begged Mi&s;s Margland to make her &s;ome fre&s;h tea;
adding, &startq;As this is a day in which I intend us all to
be happy alike, I beg nobody will go out of the room,
for the &s;ake of our enjoying it all together.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;ummons to happine&s;s produced the u&s;ual effect
of &s;uch calls; a general &s;ilence, &s;ucceeded by a gene|ral
yawning, and a univer&s;al &s;ecret wi&s;h of &s;eparation,
to the &s;ingle exception of Sir Hugh, who, after a pau&s;e,
&s;aid, &startq;Why nobody &s;peaks but me! which I really
think odd enough. However, my dear nephew, if
you don't care for our plain Engli&s;h conver&s;ation, which,
indeed, after all your &s;tudies, one can't much wonder
at, nobody can be again&s;t you and the Doctor jabbering
together a little of your Greek and Latin.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lynmere, letting fall his bread upon the table,
leaned back in his chair, and, &s;ticking his hands in his
&s;ide, looked at his uncle with an air of a&s;toni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay&endq; continued the baronet, &startq;I don't pretend I
&s;hould be much the wi&s;er for it; however, it's what I've
no objection to hear; &s;o come, Doctor! you're the old|e&s;t;
break the ice!&endq;</P>
<P>A ver&s;e of Horace with which Dr. Orkborne was
opening his an&s;wer, was &s;topt &s;hort, by the eager manner
in which Lynmere re-&s;eized his bread with one hand,
while with the other, to the great di&s;compo&s;ure of the
exact Mi&s;s Margland, he &s;tretched forth for the tea-pot,
to pour out a ba&s;on of tea; not cea&s;ing the libation till the
&s;aucer it&s;elf, overcharged, &s;ent his beverage in trickling
rills from the table-cloth to the floor.</P>
<P>The ladies all moved &s;ome paces from the table, to
&s;ave their clothes; and Mi&s;s Margland reproachfully
inquired if &s;he had not made his tea to his liking.</P>
<P>&startq;Don't mind it, I beg, my dear boy,&endq; cried Sir
Hugh; &startq;a little &s;lop's &s;oon wiped up; and we're all
friends: &s;o don't let that &s;top your Latin.&endq;</P>
<P>Lynmere, noticing neither the Latin, the mi&s;chief,
<PB N="301" REF="102">
nor the con&s;olation, fini&s;hed his tea in one draught, and
then &s;aid: &startq;Pray, &s;ir, where do you keep all your
new&s;papers?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;New&s;papers, my dear nephew? I've got no new&s;|papers:
what would you have us do with a mere &s;et
of politics, that not one of us under&s;tand, in point of what
may be their true drift; now we're all met together
o'purpo&s;e to be comfortable?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No new&s;papers, &s;ir?&endq; cried Lynmere, ri&s;ing, and
vehemently ringing the bell; and, with a &s;cornful
laugh, adding, half between his teeth, &startq;Ha! ha!
live in the country without new&s;papers! a good joke,
faith?&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;ervant appearing, he gave orders for all the morn|ing
papers that could be procured.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh looked much amazed; but pre&s;ently &s;tart|ing
up, &s;aid, &startq;My dear nephew, I believe I've caught
your meaning, at la&s;t; for if you mean, as I take for
granted, that we're all rather dull company, why I'll
take your hint, and leave you and a certain per&s;on to|gether,
to make a better acquaintance; which you can't
do &s;o well while we're all by, on account of mo|de&s;ty.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, frightened almo&s;t to &s;ickne&s;s, caught by
her two &s;i&s;ters; and Mr. Tyrold, tenderly compa&s;&s;io|nating
her apprehen&s;ions, whi&s;pered to Sir Hugh to di&s;|pen&s;e
with a <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI> &s;o early: and, taking her hand,
accompanied her him&s;elf to her room, compo&s;ing, and
re-a&s;&s;uring her by the way.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, though vexed, then followed, to i&s;&s;ue &s;ome
particular orders, the re&s;t of the party di&s;per&s;ed, and
young Lynmere remained with his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Walking on tiptoe to the door, he &s;hut it, and put
his ear to the key-hole, till he no longer heard any foot|&s;tep.
Turning then ha&s;tily round, he flung him&s;elf,
full length, upon a &s;ofa, and bur&s;t into &s;o violent a fit of
laughter, he was forced to hold his &s;ides.</P>
<P>Indiana, tittering, &s;aid, &startq;Well, brother, how do
you like her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Like her!&endq; he repeated, when able to &s;peak;
<PB N="302" REF="103">
&startq;why the old gentleman doats! He can never, el&s;e,
&s;eriou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e I'll marry her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He! he! he! yes, but he does, indeed, brother.
He's got every thing ready.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Has he, faith?&endq; cried Lynmere, again rolling on
the &s;ofa, almo&s;t &s;uffocated with violent laughter: from
which &s;uddenly recovering, he &s;tarted up to &s;troam to a
large looking-gla&s;s, and, &s;tanding before it, in an ea&s;y
and mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured attitude, &startq;Much obliged to him, 'pon
honour!' he exclaimed: &startq;Don't you think,&endq; turning
carele&s;sly, yet in an elegant po&s;ition, round to his &s;i&s;ter,
&startq;don't you think I am, Indiana?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Me, brother? la! I'm &s;ure I think &s;he's the $glie&s;t
little fright, poor thing! I ever &s;aw in the world, poor
thing! &s;uch a little, &s;hort, dumpty, hump backed,
crooked, limping figure of a fright&mdash;poor thing!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, yes,&endq; cried he, changing his po&s;ture, but
&s;till undauntedly examining him&s;elf before the gla&s;s,
&startq;he has taken amazing care of me, I confe&s;s; matched
me mo&s;t exactly!&endq;</P>
<P>Then &s;itting down, as if to con&s;ider the matter more
&s;eriou&s;ly, he took Indiana by the arm, and, with &s;ome
di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;aid, &startq;Why, what does the old quoz
mean? Does he want me to to&s;s him in a blanket?&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana tittered more than ever at this idea, till her
brother angrily demanded of her, why &s;he had not writ|ten
her&s;elf &s;ome de&s;cription of this young Hecate, to
prepare him for her &s;ight? Sir Hugh having merely
given him to under&s;tand that &s;he was not quite beauti|ful.</P>
<P>Indiana had no excu&s;e to plead, but that &s;he did not
think of it. She had, indeed, grown up with an aver|&s;ion
to writing, in common with whatever el&s;e gave
trouble, or required attention; and her corre&s;pondence
with her brother rarely produced more than two letters
in a year, which were briefly upon general topics, and
read by the whole family.</P>
<P>She now related to him the hi&s;tory of the will, and
the vow, which only in an imperfect, and but half-cre|dited
manner had reached him.</P>
<P>His laughter then gave place to a &s;torm of rage. He
<PB N="303" REF="104">
called him&s;elf ruined, bla&s;ted, undone; and abu&s;ed Sir
Hugh as a good-for-nothing dotard, defrauding him of
his ju&s;t rights and expectations.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, that's the rea&s;on,&endq; &s;aid Indiana, &startq;he wants
to marry you to cou&s;in Eugenia; becau&s;e, he &s;ays, it's
to make you amends.&endq;</P>
<P>This led him to a rather more &s;erious con&s;ideration
of the affair; for, he prote&s;ted the money was what
he could not do without. Yet, again parading to the
gla&s;s, &startq;What a &s;hame, Indiana,&endq; he cried, &startq;what a
&s;hame would it be to make &s;uch a &s;acrifice? If he'll
only pay a trifle of money for me, and give me a few
odd hundreds to begin with, I'll hold him quit of all
el&s;e, &s;o he'll but quit me of that wizen little &s;tump.&endq;</P>
<P>A new&s;paper, procured from the neare&s;t public hou&s;e,
being now brought, he pinched Indiana by the chin,
&s;aid &s;he was the fine&s;t girl he had &s;een in England, and
whi&s;tled off to his appointed chamber.</P>
<P>Clermont Lynmere &s;o entirely re&s;embled his &s;i&s;ter in
per&s;on, that now in his fir&s;t youth, he might almo&s;t
have been taken for her, even without change of dre&s;s;
but the effect produced upon the beholders bore not the
&s;ame parallel: what in her was beauty in its highe&s;t
delicacy, in him &s;eemed effeminacy in its lowe&s;t de|gradation.
The brilliant fairne&s;s of his fore-head, the
tran&s;parent pink of his cheeks, th$ pouting vermillion
of his lips, the liquid lu&s;tre of his langui&s;hing blue
eyes, the minute form of his almo&s;t infantine mouth,
and the &s;nowy whitene&s;s of his &s;mall hands and taper
fingers, far from bearing the attraction which, in his
&s;i&s;ter, rendered them &s;o lovely, made him con&s;idered by
his own &s;ex as an unmanly fop, and by the women, as
too conceited to admire any thing but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to his under&s;tanding, his &s;uperiority
over his &s;i&s;ter was rather in education than in parts,
and in practical intercour&s;e with the world, than in any
higher rea&s;oning faculties. His character, like his
per&s;on, wanted maturing, the one being as di&s;tinct from
intellectual deci&s;ion, as the other from ma&s;culine digni|ty.
He had youth without diffidence, &s;prightline&s;s with|out
wit, opinion without judgment, and learning without
<PB N="304" REF="105">
knowledge. Yet, as he contemplated his fine per&s;on
in the gla&s;s, he thought him&s;elf without one external
fault; and, early ca&s;t upon his own re&s;pon&s;ibility, was
not con&s;cious of one mental deficiency.</P>

<P>MR. TYROLD left Eugenia to her &s;i&s;ters, un|willing
to &s;peak of Lynmere till he had &s;een &s;ome|thing
more of him. Sir Hugh, al&s;o, was going, for
he had no time, he &s;aid, to lo&s;e in his preparations;
but Eugenia, taking his arm, be&s;ought that nothing of
that kind might, at pre&s;ent, be mentioned.</P>
<P>&startq;Don't trouble your&s;elf about that, my dear,&endq;
he an&s;wered; &startq;for it's what I take all into my own
hands; your cou&s;in being a per&s;on that don't talk much;
by which, how ca$ any thing be brought forward, if
nobody interferes? A girl, you know, my dear, can't
&s;peak for her&s;elf, let her wi&s;h it never &s;o much.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas!&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, when he was gone, &startq;how
painfully am I &s;ituated! Clermont will &s;urely &s;uppo&s;e
this precipitance all mine; and already, po&s;&s;ibly, con|cludes
it is upon my &s;ugge&s;tion he has thus prematurely
been called from his travels, and impeded in his prai&s;e-worthy
ambition of &s;tudying the laws, manners, and
cu&s;toms of the different nations of Europe!&endq;</P>
<P>The wan countenance of Camilla, &s;oon, however,
drew all ob&s;ervation upon her&s;elf, and obliged her to
narrate the cruel adventure of the morning.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters were both petrified by the account of Sir
Sedley; and their compa&s;&s;ion for his expected de&s;pair
was changed into di&s;gu&s;t at his in&s;ulting impertinence.
<PB N="305" REF="106">
They were of opinion that his bird and his letters
&s;hould immediately be returned; and their horror of
any debt with a character mingling &s;uch pre&s;umption
with &s;uch levity, made Eugenia promi&s;e that, as &s;oon
as &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o much money, &s;he would &s;end
him, in the name of Lionel, his two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The bird, therefore, by Tom Hodd, was in&s;tantly
conveyed to Clarendel-Place; but the letters Camilla
retained, till &s;he could fir&s;t &s;hew them to Edgar,&mdash;if
this event had not lo&s;t him to her for ever, and if he
manife&s;ted any de&s;ire of an explanation.</P>
<P>Edgar him&s;elf, meanwhile, in a paroxy&s;m of &s;udden
mi&s;ery, and torturing jealou&s;y, had gallopped furiou&s;ly
to the rectory of Cleves.</P>
<P>&startq;O, Doctor Marchmont!&endq; he cried &startq;what a tale
have I now to unfold! Within the&s;e la&s;t twenty-four
hours I have been the mo&s;t wretched&mdash;the happie&s;t&mdash;
and again the mo&s;t agonized of human beings! I have
thought Camilla be&s;towed upon another,&mdash;I have be|lieved
her,&mdash;oh, Doctor!&mdash;my own!&mdash;I have con|ceived
my&s;elf at the &s;ummit of all earthly felicity!&mdash;
I find my&s;elf, at this moment deluded and undone!&endq;</P>
<P>He then detailed the account, calling upon the Doc|tor
to unravel to him the in&s;upportable aenigma of his
de&s;tiny; to tell him for what purpo&s;e Camilla had
&s;hewn him a tenderne&s;s &s;o bewitching&punc; at the very time
&s;he was carrying on a clande&s;tine intercour&s;e with ano|ther?
with a man, who, though de&s;titute neither of
wit nor good qualities, it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould
love, &s;ince &s;he was as incapable of admiring as of par|ticipating
in his defects? To what incomprehen&s;ible
motives attribute &s;uch incongruities? Why accept and
&s;uffer her friends to accept him, if engaged to Sir
Sedley? why, if &s;eriou&s;ly meaning to be his, this &s;e|cret
corre&s;pondence? Why &s;o early, &s;o private, &s;o
&s;trange a meeting? &startq;Whence, Doctor Marchmont, the
daring boldne&s;s of his &s;eizing her hand? whence the
never-to-be-forgotten licence with which he pre&s;umed
to lift it to his lips,&mdash;and there hardily to detain it, &s;o
<PB N="306" REF="107">
as never man dur&s;t do, who&s;e hopes were not all alive,
from his own belief in their encouragement! explain,
expound to me this work of darkne&s;s and amazement;
tell me why, with every appearance of the mo&s;t artle&s;s
oppenne&s;s, I find her thus eternally di&s;ingenuous and un|intelligible?
why, though I have ca&s;t my&s;elf wholly in|to
her power, &s;he retains all her my&s;tery&mdash;&s;he heightens
it into deceit next perjury?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;k me, my dear young friend, why the &s;un does
not give night, and the moon day; then why women
practi&s;e conquetry. Alas! my &s;ea&s;on for &s;urpri&s;e has
long been pa&s;&s;ed! They will rather trifle, even with
tho&s;e they de&s;pi&s;e, than be candid even with tho&s;e they
re&s;pect. The young baronet, probably has been mak|ing
his court to her, or &s;he has believed &s;uch was his
de&s;ign; but as you fir&s;t came to the point, &s;he would
not hazard rejecting you, while uncertain if he were
&s;erious. She was, po&s;&s;ibly, putting him to the te&s;t, by
the account of your declaration, at the moment of your
un&s;ea&s;onable intru&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If this, Doctor, is your &s;tatement, and if your
&s;tatement is ju&s;t, in how de&s;pi$able a lo$$ery have I ri&s;k|ed
the peace of my life! You &s;uppo&s;e then&mdash;that, if
&s;ure of Sir Sedley&mdash;I am di&s;carded?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You know what I think of your &s;ituation: can I,
when to yet more riches I add a title, &s;uppo&s;e that of
Sir Sedley le&s;s &s;ecure?&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;huddering &s;tart, the di&s;tracted look of Edgar,
with his hand clapped to his burning forehead, now
alarmed the Doctor; who endeavoured to &s;omewhat
&s;often his &s;entence, di&s;&s;uading him again&s;t any immedi|ate
mea&s;ures, and advi&s;ing him to pa&s;s over the&s;e fir&s;t
moments of emotion, and then coolly to &s;uffer inquiry
to take place of deci&s;ion. But Edgar could not hear
him; he &s;hook hands with him, faintly &s;miled, as an
apology for not &s;peaking; and hurrying off, without
waiting for his &s;ervant, gallopped toward the New
Fore&s;t: leaving his ab&s;ence from Cleves to declare
his defection, and bent only to fly from Camilla, and
all that belonged to her.</P>
<P>All, however, that belonged to Camilla was preci&s;e|ly
<PB N="307" REF="108">
what followed him; pur&s;ued him in every po&s;&s;ible form,
clung to his heart-&s;trings, almo&s;t maddened his &s;en&s;es.
He could not bear to reflect; retro&s;pection was torture,
anticipation was horror. To lo&s;e thus, without nece&s;|&s;ity,
without calamity, the object of his deare&s;t wi&s;hes,
&mdash;to lo&s;e her from mere declen&s;ion of e&s;teem&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Any inevitable evil,&endq; he cried, &startq;I could have
&s;u&s;tained; any blow of fortune, however &s;evere; any
&s;troke of adver&s;ity, however terrible;&mdash;but this&mdash;this
error of all my &s;en&s;es&mdash;this deception of all my hopes
&mdash;this extinction of every feeling I have cheri&s;hed&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>He rode on yet harder, leaping over every thing,
thoughtle&s;s rather than fearle&s;s of every danger he could
encounter, and galloping with the &s;peed and violence
of &s;ome pur&s;uit, though wholly without view, and al|mo&s;t
without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s; as if, hoping by flight, to
e&s;cape from the degenerate portrait of Camilla: but
its painter was his own imagination, and mocked the
attempt.</P>
<P>From the other &s;ide of a five-barred gate, which,
with almo&s;t frantic &s;peed, he was approaching with a
view to clear, a voice halloo'd to &s;top him; and, at
the &s;ame time, a man who was leading one hor&s;e, and
riding another, di&s;mounted, and called out, &startq;Why,
as &s;ure as I'm alive, it's Squire Mandlebert!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar now, perceiving Jacob, was going to turn
back to avoid him; but, re&s;training this fir&s;t movement,
&s;aintly de&s;ired him to &s;tand by, as he had $ot a mo|ment
to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;Good lack!&endq; cried Jacob, with the freedom of
an old &s;ervant, who had known him from a boy;
&startq;why, I would not but have happened to come this
way for never &s;o much! why you might have broke
your neck, el&s;e! Leap &s;uch a gate as this here? why I
can't let you do no &s;uch a thing! Mi&s;s Camilla's like
a child of my own, as one may &s;ay; and &s;he'll never
hold up her head again, I'll be bound for it, if you
&s;hould come to any harm; and, as to poor old ma&s;ter!
'twould go nigh to break his heart.&endq;</P>
<P>Struck with words which, from &s;o faithful an old &s;er|vant,
<PB N="308" REF="109">
could not but be touching, Edgar, was brought
&s;uddenly to him&s;elf, and felt the claim of the Tyrold
family for a conduct more guarded. He endeavoured
to put his own feelings apart, and con&s;ider how be&s;t
he might &s;pare tho&s;e of the friends of Camilla; tho&s;e
of Camilla her&s;elf he concluded to be out of his reach,
except as they might &s;imply relate to the female pride
and vanity of refu&s;ing rather than being given up.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, now, to weigh how he might obviate any
offence; and, after fir&s;t re&s;olving to write a fort of ge|neral
leave-taking, and next, &s;eeing the almo&s;t in&s;upe|rable
objections to whatever he could &s;tate, determined
upon gaining time for deliberation, by merely com|mi&s;&s;ioning
Jacob to carry a me&s;&s;age to Cleves, that
&s;ome &s;udden affairs called him, for the pre&s;ent, to a
di&s;tant part of the country. This, at &s;uch a period,
would create a &s;urpri&s;e that might lead the way to what
would follow: and Camilla, who could not, he thought
be much a&s;toni&s;hed, might then take her own mea&s;ures
for the defection &s;he would &s;ee rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>But Jacob re&s;i&s;ted bearing the intelligence: &startq;Good
lack, &s;ir,&endq; he cried, what have you got in your head!
&s;omething that will do you no good, I'll be bound, by
the look of your eyes, which look as big as if they was
both going to drop out; you'd better come your&s;elf and
tell'em what's the matter, and &s;peak a word to poor
Mi&s;s Camilla, or &s;he'll never believe but what &s;ome
ill has $$tided you. Why we all knew about it,
fa&s;t enough, before our ma&s;ter told us; &s;ervants have
eyes as well as their ma&s;ters; only Mary will have it
&s;he found it out at the fir&s;t, which an't true, for I &s;aw
it by the time you'd been a week in the hou&s;e; and if
you'll take my word, &s;quire, I don't think there's &s;uch
another heart in the world as Mi&s;s Camilla's except ju&s;t
my own old ma&s;ter's.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar leant again&s;t his hor&s;e, neither &s;peaking no$
moving, yet involuntarily li&s;tening, while deeply
&s;ighing.</P>
<P>&startq;What a power of good &s;he'll do,&endq; continued Jacob,
&startq;when &s;he's mi&s;tre&s;s of Beech Park! I warrant &s;he'll
go about, vi&s;iting the poor, and making them clothes,
<PB N="309" REF="110">
and broths, and wine po&s;&s;ets, and baby-linen, all day long.
She has done it at Etherington quite from a child; and
when &s;he had nothing to give 'em, &s;he u&s;ed to take her
thread papers and needle books, and &s;it down and work
for them, and carry them bits and &s;craps of things to
help 'em to patch their gowns. Why when &s;he's got
your fine fortunes, &s;he'll bring a ble&s;&s;ing upon the whole
country.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar felt touched; his wrath was &s;oftened into ten|derne&s;s,
and he ejaculated to him&s;elf: &startq;Such, indeed,
I thought Camilla! active in charity, gentle in good
works&mdash;I thought that in putting my fortune into her
hands, I was &s;erving the unhappy,&mdash;feeding the indi|gent,
&mdash;reviving the &s;ick!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ma&s;ter,&endq; continued Jacob, &startq;took a fancy to her
from the very fir&s;t, as well as I; and when ma&s;ter &s;aid
&s;he was coming to live with us, I a&s;ked to make it a ho|liday
for all our folks, and ma&s;ter was as plea&s;ed as I.
But nobody'd think what a tender heart &s;he's got of her
own, without knowing her, becau&s;e of her &s;inging, and
laughing, and dancing &s;o, except when old Mi&s;s Marg|land's
in the way, who's what Mr. Lionel calls a kill|joy
at any time. Howbeit, I'll take &s;pecial care &s;he
&s;han't be by when I tell her of my &s;topping you from
breaking your neck here; but I wi&s;h you could be in a
corner your&s;elf, to peep at her, without her knowing it;
I'll warrant you &s;he'll give me &s;uch a &s;mile, you'd be fit
to eat her!&endq;</P>
<P>Shaken once more in every re&s;olution, becau&s;e un|certain
in every opinion, Edgar found the indignant
de&s;peration which had &s;eized him begin to &s;ub&s;ide, and
his mind again become a&s;&s;ailable by &s;omething re&s;emb|ling
hope. Almo&s;t in&s;tinctively he remounted his hor&s;e&punc;
and almo&s;t involuntarily&mdash;drawn on by hearkening to
the prai&s;e of Camilla, and fa&s;cinated by the det$$$
made by Jacob of her regard, accompanied him back to
Cleves.</P>
<P>As they rode into the park, and while he was ear|ne&s;tly
endeavouring to form &s;ome palliation, by which
he might exculpate what &s;eemed to him &s;o guilty in the
&s;trange meeting and its &s;trange circum&s;tances, he per|ceived
<PB N="310" REF="111">
Camilla her&s;elf, walking upon the lawn. He
&s;aw &s;he had ob&s;erved him, and &s;aw, from her air, &s;he
&s;eemed irre&s;olute if to re-enter the hou&s;e, or await
him.</P>
<P>Jacob, &s;ignificantly pointing her out, offered to &s;hew
the effect he could produce by what he could relate;
but Edgar, giving him the charge of his hou&s;e, earne&s;tly
be&s;ought him to retire in quiet, and to keep his opinions
and experiments to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Each now, &s;eparately, and with nearly equal difficul|ty,
&s;trove to attain fortitude to &s;eek an explanation.
They approached each other; Camilla with her eyes
fixed upon the ground, her air embarra&s;&s;ed, and her
cheeks covered with blu&s;hes; Edgar with quick, but
almo&s;t tottering &s;teps, his eyes wildly avoiding hers, and
his complexion pale even to indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>When they were met within a few yards, they &s;topt;
Camilla &s;till without courage to look up, and Edgar
&s;triving to &s;peak, but finding no pa&s;&s;age for his voice.
Camilla, then, a&s;hamed of her &s;ituation, rai&s;ed her eyes,
and forced her&s;elf to &s;ay, &startq;Have you been into the
hou&s;e? Have you &s;een my cou&s;in Lynmere?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No&mdash;madam.&endq;</P>
<P>Struck with a cold formality that never before, from
Edgar, had reached her ears, and &s;hocked by the &s;ight
of his e&s;tranged and altered countenance, with the cruel
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that appearances authori&s;ed the mo&s;t de|preciating
&s;u&s;picions, &s;he advanced, and holding out her
hand, &startq;Edgar,&endq; &s;he gently cried, &startq;are you ill? or
only angry?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O Camilla!&endq; he an&s;wered, &startq;can you deign to u&s;e
to me &s;uch a word? can you di&s;tort my deare&s;t affections,
convul&s;e my faire&s;t hopes, eradicate every power of hap|pine&s;s
&mdash;yet &s;peak with &s;o &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s&mdash;yet look at
me with &s;uch mildne&s;s? &s;uch &s;oftne&s;s&mdash;I had almo&s;t
&s;aid&mdash;&s;uch kindne&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>Deeply affected, &s;he could hardly &s;tand. He had
taken her offered hand, but in a manner &s;o changed from
the &s;ame action the preceding day, that &s;he &s;carce knew
if he touched while he held it, &s;carce felt that he relin|qui&s;hed,
as almo&s;t immediately &s;he withdrew it.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="112">
But her conde&s;cen&s;ion at this moment was rather a
new torment than any &s;olace to him. The hand which
&s;he proferred, and which the day before he had received
as the token of permanent felicity, he had now &s;een in
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion $word$ $nother, with every licence, every ap|parent
mark of permitted rapture in which he had been
indulged him&s;elf. He knew not to whom it of right
belonged; and the doubt not merely bani&s;hed happine&s;s,
but mingled re&s;entment with mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;ee,&endq; cried &s;he, after a morti$ied pau&s;e; &startq;you
have lo&s;t your good opinion of me&mdash;I can only, there|fore&mdash;&endq;
She &s;topt, but his melancholy &s;ilence was a
confirmation of her &s;ugge&s;tion that offended her into
more exertion, and, with &s;en&s;ibility rai&s;ed into dignity,
&s;he added, &startq;only hope your intended tour to the Con|tinent
may take place without delay!&endq;</P>
<P>She would then have walked on to the hou&s;e; but
following her, &startq;Is all over?&endq; he cried, &startq;and is it
thus, Camilla, we part?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why not?&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a &s;igh, yet turning
back.</P>
<P>&startq;What a que&s;tion! cruel Camilla! Is this all the
explanation you allow me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What other do you wi&s;h?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All!&mdash;every other!&mdash;that meeting&mdash;tho&s;e let|ters&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you have any curio&s;ity yet remaining&mdash;only
name what you de&s;ire.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are you indeed &s;o good?&endq; cried he, in a voice that
&s;hewed his &s;oul again melting; &startq;tho&s;e letters, then&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You &s;hall have them&mdash;every one!&endq; &s;he cried, with
alacrity; and in&s;tantly taking out her pocket-book,
pre&s;ented him with the prepared packet.</P>
<P>&startq;Penetrated by this unexpected openne&s;s and com|pliance,
he &s;natched her hand, with intent to pre&s;s it to
his lips; but again the recollection he had &s;een that li|berty
accorded to Sir Sedley, joined to the &s;ight of his
writing, checked him; he let it go; bowed his thanks
with a look of grateful re&s;pect, and attempting no more
to &s;top her, walked towards the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, to pe|ru&s;e
the letters.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Re&s;olutions.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ound of the dinner-bell, which rang in the
ears of Edgar before he reached his intended retreat,
would have been unnoticed, if not &s;econded by a me&s;|&s;age
from Sir Hugh, who had &s;een him from his win|dow.</P>
<P>Compelled to obey, though in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e
almo&s;t intolerable, he put up the important little
packet, and repaired to the dining parlour; where,
though none were equally di&s;turbed with him&s;elf, no
one was at ea&s;e. Young Lynmere, under an appear|ance
of mingled a&s;&s;urance and apathy, the effect of
acquired conceit, playing upon natural in&s;ipidity, was
&s;ecretly tormented with the rue$ul nece&s;&s;ity of &s;acrifi|cing
either a noble $ortune, or his own fine per&s;on;
Sir Hugh felt a &s;trange di&s;appointment from the whole
behaviour of his nephew, though it was what he would
not acknowledge, and could not define; Mr. Tyrold
&s;aw with much unea&s;ine&s;s the glaringly apparent un|&s;uitablene&s;s
of the intended alliance; Eugenia had
never yet thought her&s;elf &s;o plain and in&s;ignificant,
and felt as if, even &s;ince the morning, the &s;mall-pox
had renewed its ravages, and &s;he had &s;unk into being
&s;horter; Indiana and Mi&s;s Margland were both acute|ly
incen&s;ed with Mandlebert; Dr. Orkborne &s;aw
but &s;mall rea&s;on to expect gratitude for his labours
from the &s;upercilious negligence of the boa&s;ted young
&s;tudent; Lavinia was di&s;turbed for both her &s;i&s;ters;
and Camilla $elt that all &s;he valued in li$e depended
upon the next critical hour or two.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of general di&s;comfort, Sir Hugh, who
<PB N="313" REF="114">
could never be $ilent, alone talked. Having long pre|pared
him&s;elf to look upon this meeting as a day of
happine&s;s, he &s;trove to believe, for a while, the whole
family were peculiarly enjoying them&s;elves; but, upon
a dead &s;ilence, which enlued upon his taking a copious
draught of Mad$ira and water, &startq;Why, my dear
nephew,&endq; he cried, putting down his goblet, &startq;you
don't tell us any thing? which I've no doubt but you
know why your&s;elf. However, as we're all met o'
purpo&s;e to &s;ee you, I can't &s;ay I &s;hould be &s;orry
to hear the &s;ound of your voice, provided it won't be
di&s;agreeable.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We are no$ much&mdash;conver$ant, &s;ir, in each
other's connexions, I believe,&endq; an&s;wered Lynmere,
without $$a&s;ing a moment $word$ eat, and to help him&s;elf,
and ordering a $$$h plate at every &s;econd mouthful;
&startq;I have &s;een nothing, yet, of your folks hereabouts;
and, I fancy, &s;ir, you don't know a great deal of the
people I have been u&s;ed to.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, having good humouredly acknowledged
this to be t$$th, was at a lo&s;s what further to pur|po&s;e;
and, imagining the taciturnity of the re&s;t of
the party to proceed from an awe of the knowledge
and abilities of his nephew, &s;oon became him&s;elf &s;o
infected with fear and reverence, that, though he
could not be $$$$t, he &s;poke only to tho&s;e who were
next him, and in a whi&s;per.</P>
<P>When the de&s;&s;ert was &s;erved, &s;omething like a ge|neral
relief was effected by the unexpected entrance
of Dr. Marchmont&punc; Alarmed by the ungoverned, and,
in him, unpre$edented, emotions of Edgar, he had
been to Beech Park; and, finding he had not returned
there, had ridden on, in the mo&s;t unea&s;y uncertainty,
to inquire for him at Cleves.</P>
<P>Happy to &s;ee him &s;afe, though almo&s;t &s;miling to
&s;ee with whom, he was beginning &s;ome excu&s;e for his
intru&s;ion, when the baronet &s;aved his proceeding, by
calling our, &startq;Well, this is as good a piece of good
luck as any we've met with yet! Here's Dr. March|mont
come to with us joy; and he's as good a &s;cholar
as your&s;elf, nephew, for any thing I know to the
<PB N="314" REF="115">
contrary, why you need not be &s;o afraid of &s;peaking,
for the &s;ake of our not under&s;tanding you; which
here's five of us can do now, as well as your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Lynmere, readily concluding Mr. Tyrold and
Edgar, with the two Doctors, made four, glanced
round the table to &s;ee who might be the fifth; when,
&s;uppo&s;ing it Mi&s;s Margland, he withdrew his eyes
with a look of deri&s;ion, and, turning to the butler,
a&s;ked what wines he might call for.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh then propo&s;ed that they &s;hould all pair
off; the ignorant ones going one way, and the learned
ones &s;taying another.</P>
<P>It would be difficult to &s;ay which looked mo&s;t
aver&s;e to this propo&s;ition, Eugenia, or the young
traveller; who ha&s;tily &s;aid, &startq;I always ride after
dinner, &s;ir. Is your groom at hand? Can he &s;hew
me your hor&s;es?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My nephew little &s;u&s;pects,&endq; cried Sir Hugh,
winking, &startq;Eugenia belongs to the &s;cholars! Ten
to one but he thinks he's got Homer and Horace
to him&s;elf! But here, my dear boy, as you're &s;o
fond of the cla&s;&s;ics&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Clermont, nimbly ri&s;ing, and knocking down a
decanter of water in his ha&s;te, but not turning back
to look at it, nor &s;taying to offer any apology, af|fected
not to hear his uncle, and flung ha&s;tily out
of the room, calling upon Indiana to follow him.</P>
<P>&startq;In the name of all the <HI>Diavoli,</HI>&endq; cried he,
pulling her into the park with him, &startq;what does
all this mean? Is the old gentleman <HI>non compos?</HI>
what's all this &s;tuff he de&s;cants upon &s;o freely, of
&s;cholars, and cla&s;&s;ics, and Homer, and Horace?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O you mu&s;t a&s;k Eugenia, not me!&endq; an&s;wered In|diana,
&s;cornfully.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, what does Eugenia know of the mat|ter?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Know? why every thing. She's a great &s;cho|lar,
and has been brought up by Dr. Orborne; and
&s;he talks Greek and Latin.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Does &s;he &s;o? then, by the Lord! &s;he's no
wife of mine! I'd as &s;oon marry the old Doctor him|&s;elf!
<PB N="315" REF="116">
and I'm &s;ure he'd make me as pretty a wife&punc;
Greek and Latin! why, I'd as &s;oon tie my&s;elf to a
rod. Pretty &s;ort of dinners &s;he'll give!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O dear, yes, brother; &s;he don't care what &s;he
eats; &s;he cares for nothing but books, and &s;uch kind
of things.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Books! ha! ha! Books, and Latin and Greek!
upon my faith, a pretty wife the old gentleman has
been &s;o good as to find me! why he mu&s;t b$ a down|right
driveller!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, brother, if we had all that fortune, what a
different figure we &s;hould cut with it!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes, I rather flatter my&s;elf we &s;hould. No
great need of five thou&s;and a year to pore over books!
Ha! ha! faith, this is a good hum enough! So he
thinks to take me in, does he?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, you know, &s;he is &s;o rich, brother.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Rich? well, and what am I? do you &s;ee &s;uch a
figure as this,&endq; (&s;uddenly &s;kipping before her,) &startq;every
day? Am I reduced to my la&s;t legs, think you? Do
you &s;uppo&s;e I can't meet with &s;ome kind old dowa|ger
any time the&s;e twenty years?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La, brother, won't you have her then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, faith, won't I! It's not come to that, nei|ther.
This learning is wor&s;e than her ugline&s;s;
'twould make me look like a dunce in my own
hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>He then prote&s;ted he had rather lo&s;e forty e&s;tates,
than &s;o be &s;acrificed, and vowed, without venturing
a direct refu&s;al he would &s;oon &s;icken the old gentle|man
of his &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Eugenia, in retreating to her room, was again
accompanied by her father and her uncle, whom &s;he
conjured now, to name her to Clermont no more.</P>
<P>&startq;I can't &s;ay I admire the&s;e puttings off, my dear,&endq;
&s;aid the baronet, &startq;in this our mortal &s;tate, which is
always liable to end in our dying. Not that I pretend
to tell you I think him over much alert; but there's
<PB N="316" REF="117">
no knowing but what he may have &s;ome meaning in
it that we can't under&s;tand; a per&s;on having &s;tudied
all his life, has a right to a little particularity.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold him&s;elf now &s;eriou&s;ly interfered, and
de&s;ired that, henceforth, Clermont might be treated
as if his vi&s;it to Cleves was merely to congratulate his
uncle upon his recovery; and that all &s;chemes, pre|parations,
and allu&s;ions, might be put a&s;ide, unle&s;s
the youth him&s;elf, and with a good grace, brought
them forward; mean while, he and Lavinia would
return without delay to Etherington, to obviate all
appearance of waiting the deci&s;ion of any plan.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was much di&s;comfited by the exaction
of &s;uch forbearance, yet could the le&s;s oppo&s;e it, from
his own internal di&s;content with his nephew, which
he inadvertently betrayed, by murmuring, in his way
to his chamber, &startq;There's no denying but what
they've got &s;ome odd-fangled new ways of their
own, in tho&s;e foreign parts; meeting a &s;et of old
relations for the fir&s;t time, and &s;aying nothing to
them, but a&s;king for the new&s;papers! Lord help us!
caring about the wide world, &s;o, when we know no|thing
of it, in&s;tead of one's own uncles and nephews,
and kin&s;people!&endq;</P>
<P>During this time, Edgar, almo&s;t agoni&s;ed by &s;u&s;|pence
and doubt, had e&s;caped to the &s;ummer-hou&s;e,
whither he was followed by Dr. Marchmont, greatly
to the wonder, almo&s;t with the contempt of Dr.
Orkborne; whom he quitted, in anxiety for his
young friend, ju&s;t as he had intimated a de&s;ign to
con&s;ult him upon a difficult pa&s;&s;age in an ancient au|thor,
which had a place in his work, that was now
nearly ready for the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;I know well, Doctor,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, &startq;that to
find me here, after all that has pa&s;&s;ed, will make
you conclude me the weake&s;t of men&mdash;but I cannot
now explain how it has been brought about&mdash;the&s;e
letters mu&s;t fir&s;t tell me if Camilla and I m$et more
than once again.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="118">
He then ha&s;tily ran over the letters; but by no
means ha&s;tily could he dige&s;t, nor even comprehend
their contents. He thought them florid, affected, and
pre&s;uming; yet vague, &s;tudied, with little appear|ance
of &s;incerity, and le&s;s of explicit deci&s;ion. What
related to Lionel, and to aiding him in the di&s;po&s;al of
his wealth, &s;eemed lea&s;t intelligible, yet mo&s;t like &s;e|rious
meaning; but when he found that the inter|view
at the Grove was by po&s;itive appointment, and
granted to a reque&s;t made with a $orwardne&s;s and a&s;|&s;urance
&s;o wide from all delicacy and propriety, the
blood mounted high into his cheeks, and precipitately
putting up the packer, he exclaimed: &startq;Here, then,
it ends! the la&s;t little ray of he&s;itation is extinct&mdash;ex|tinct
to be kindled never more!&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;ound of the&s;e la&s;t words cau&s;ed him an emo|tion
of &s;orrow he was unable to re&s;i&s;t, though unwil|ling
to betray, and he hurried out of the &s;ummer|hou&s;e
to the wood, where he &s;trove to compo&s;e his
mind to the la&s;t leave-taking upon which he was now
determined; but &s;o dreadful was the re&s;olution which
exacted from his own mouth the re&s;ignation of all
that, till now, had been deare&s;t to his views and
hopes, that the afternoon was far advanced, before he
could a&s;&s;ume &s;ufficient courage to direct his &s;teps to
the &s;pot where the &s;acrifice was to be made.</P>
<P>Accu&s;ing, him&s;elf, then, of weakne&s;s unpardona|ble,
he returned to the &s;ummer-hou&s;e, to apologi&s;e
to Dr. Marchmont for his abrupt retreat; but the
Doctor had already re-entered the man&s;ion. Thither,
therefore, he proceeded, purpo&s;ing to &s;eek Camilla, to
return her the letters of Sir Sedley, and to de&s;ire her
commands in what manner to conduct him&s;elf with
her father and her uncle, in acknowledging his fears
that the projected union would fail of affording, to
either party, the happine&s;s which, at fir&s;t, it &s;eemed
to promi&s;e.</P>
<P>The carriage of Sir Hugh was in waiting at the
door, and Mr. Tyrold and Lavinia were in the hall.
Edgar, in no condition for &s;uch an encounter, would
have avoided them; but Mr. Tyrold, little &s;u&s;pect|ing
<PB N="318" REF="119">
his de&s;ire, rejoiced at the meeting, &s;aying he had
had the hou&s;e &s;earched for him in vain, that he might
&s;hake hands with him before his return to Ethe|rington.</P>
<P>Then, taking him apart, &startq;My dear Edgar,&endq; he
cried, &startq;I have long loved you as tenderly, and I
may now confide in you as completely, $s if you were
my &s;on. I go hen$e in &s;ome inquietude; I fear my
brother has been too ha&s;ty in making known his view
with regard to Clermont; who does not &s;eem equal to
appreciating the worth of $word$, though it is evi|dent
he has not been &s;lack in nothing h$r misfortunes.
I entreat you, during my ab&s;ence, to examine him as
if you were already the brother of that dear child,
who merits, you well know, the be&s;t and tendere&s;t of
hu&s;bands.&endq;</P>
<P>He then followed Lavinia into the carriage, pre|vented
by his own occupied mind from ob&s;erving
the fallen countenance of Edgar, who, more wretch|ed
than ever, bemoaned now the kindne&s;s of which
he had hitherto been proud, and lamented the pater|nal
tru&s;t which he would have purcha&s;ed the day be|fore
almo&s;t with life.</P>
<P>Camilla, during this period, had gone through con|flicts
no le&s;e &s;evere.</P>
<P>Jacob, who had bought a hor&s;e, for which he
had cheerfully advanced $word$. had informed her of the
gate adventure of Edgar, and told her that, but for
his &s;topping him, he was riding like mad from Cleres,
and only &s;ending them all a me&s;&s;age that he could not
come back.</P>
<P>Grieved, &s;urpri&s;ed, and offended, &s;he in&s;tantly de|termined
&s;he would not ri&s;k &s;uch another mark of his
cold &s;uperiority, but re&s;tore to him his liberty, and
leave him ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. &startq;If the &s;everity of his
judgment,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;is &s;o much more potent than
the warmth of his affection, it &s;hall not be his delicacy,
nor his compa&s;&s;ion, that &s;hall make me his. I will
neither be the wife of his repentance nor of his pity.
<PB N="319" REF="120">
I mu&s;t be convinced of his unaltered love, his e&s;teem,
his tru&s;t&mdash;or I &s;hall de&s;cend to humiliation not ri&s;e
to happine&s;s, in becoming his. Softne&s;s h$$e would
be meanne&s;s; &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion degrading&mdash;if he he&s;itates&mdash;
let him go!&endq;</P>
<P>She then, without weighing, or even &s;eeing one ob|jection,
precipitately re&s;olved to beg permi&s;&s;ion of
her friends, to accept an invitation &s;he had received,
without as yet an&s;wering, to meet Mrs. Berlinton at
Southampton, where that lady was going to pa&s;s &s;ome
weeks. She could there, &s;he thought, give the re|jection
which here its inviolable circum&s;tances made
her, for Lionel's &s;ake, afraid to ri&s;k; or &s;he could
there, if a full explanation &s;hould appea&s;e him, find
opportunity to make it with equal &s;afety; his di&s;|like
to that acquaintance rather urged than impeded
her plan, for her wounded &s;pirit panted to prove
its independence and dignity.</P>
<P>Eugenia approved this elevation of &s;entiment, and
doubted not it would &s;hew her again in her true
light to Edgar, and bring him, with added e&s;teem,
to her feet.</P>
<P>Camilla wept with joy at the idea: &startq;Ah!&endq; &s;he
cried, &startq;if &s;uch &s;hould be my happy fate; if, after
hearing all my imprudence, my precipitance, and
want of judgment, he &s;hould voluntarily, when
wholly &s;et free, return to me&mdash;I will confe&s;s to him
every feeling&mdash;and every failing of my heart! I will
open to him my whole &s;oul, and ca&s;t my&s;elf ever af|ter
upon his genero&s;ity and his goodne&s;s&mdash;O, my
Eugenia! almo&s;t on my knees could I receive&mdash;a &s;e|cond

<P>LYNMERE, at tea-time, returned from his ride,
with a fixed plan of frightening or di&s;gu&s;ting the

imagined the attempt would be vain, $or he did not
conoeive it po&s;&s;ible any woman who had eyes could
be induced to reject him.</P>
<P>Determined, therefore, to indulge, in full, both
the natural pre&s;umption and acquired luxuriance of
his character, he conducted him&s;elf in a manner that,
to any thing &s;hort of the partiality of Sir Hugh,
would have rendered him in&s;upportably offen&s;ive:
but Sir Hugh had &s;o long cheri&s;hed a reverence for
what he had him&s;elf ordered with regard to his &s;tu|dies,
and what he implicitly credited of his attain|ments,
that it was more ea&s;y to him to doubt his
&s;en&s;es, than to &s;uppo&s;e &s;o accompli&s;hed a &s;cholar
could do any thing but what was right.</P>
<P>&startq;Your hor&s;es are worth nothing, &s;ir,&endq; cried he,
in entering; &startq;I never rode &s;o unplea&s;ant a bea&s;t.
&startq;I don't know who has the care of your &s;tud; but
whoever it is, he de&s;erves to be hanged.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh could not refu&s;e, either to his ju&s;tice or
his kindne&s;s, to vindicate his faithful Jacob; and for his
hor&s;es he made as many excu&s;es, as if every one had
been a human creature, whom he was recommending
to his mercy, with a fear they were unworthy of
his favour.</P>
<P>Not a word was &s;aid more, except what Mi&s;s
Margland, from time to time, extorted, by begging
que&s;tions, in prai&s;e of her tea, till Lynmere, violently
ringing the bell, called out to order a fire.</P>
<P>Every body was &s;urpri&s;ed at this liberty, without
any previous demand of permi&s;&s;ion from the baronet,
<PB N="321" REF="122">
or any inquiry into the feelings of the re&s;t of the
company; and Sir Hugh, in a low voice, &s;aid to
Eugenia, &startq;I am a little afraid poor Mary will be
rather out of humour to have the grate to po$$&s;h
again to-morrow morning, in the ca&s;e my nephew
&s;hould not like to have another fire then; which, I &s;up|po&s;e,
if the weather continues &s;o hot, may very like|ly
not be agreeable to him.&endq;</P>
<P>Another pau&s;e now en&s;ued; Dr. Marchmont, who,
of the whole party, was alone, at this time, capable of
leading to a general conver&s;ation, was &s;eparately oc|cupied
by watching Camilla; while him&s;elf, as u&s;ual,
was curiou&s;ly and unremittingly examined by Dr.
Orkborne, in whom &s;o much attention to a young
lady rai&s;ed many private doubts of the ju&s;tice of his
&s;chola&s;tic fame; which &s;oon, by what he ob&s;erved
of his civility even to Mi&s;s Margland, were confirmed
nearly to &s;ceptici&s;m.</P>
<P>Mary, now, entering with a coal &s;$uttle and a can|dle,
Lynmere, with much di&s;plea&s;ure, called out,
&startq;Bring wood; I hate coals.&endq;</P>
<P>Mary, as much di&s;plea&s;ed, and nearly as much hu|moured
as him&s;elf, an&s;wered that nothing but coals
were ever burnt in that grate.</P>
<P>&startq;Take it all away, then, and bid my man &s;end me
my peli&s;&s;e. That I made to cro&s;s the Alps in.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am very &s;orry, indeed, nephew,&endq; &s;aid Sir
Hugh, &startq;that we were not better prepared for your
being &s;o chilly, owing to the weather being &s;et in &s;o
&s;ultry, that we none of us much thought of having a
fire; and, indeed, in my young time, we were ne|ver
allowed thinking of &s;uch things before Michael-mas-day;
which I &s;uppo&s;e is quite behind-hand now.
Pray, nephew, if it is not too much trouble to you,
what's the day for lighting fires in foreign parts?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There's no rule of that &s;ort, now, fir, in modern
philo&s;ophy; that kind of thing's completely out; en|tirely
exploded, I give you my word.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, every thing's new, Lord help me, &s;ince
I was born! But pray, nephew, if $ may a&s;k,
without tiring you too much, on account of my ig|norance,
<PB N="322" REF="123">
have they fires in &s;ummer as well as win|ter
there?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you imagine there are grates and fires on
the Continent, &s;ir, the &s;ame as in England? ha!
ha!&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was di&s;countenanced from any further in|quiry.</P>
<P>Another &s;ilence en&s;ued, broken again by a vehe|ment
ringing of the bell.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervant appeared, &startq;What have you
got,&endq; cried Lynmere, &startq;that you can bring me to
eat?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Eat, nephew! why you would not eat before
&s;upper, when here's nobody dore tea? not that I'd
have you baulk your appetite, which, to be &s;ure, ought
to be the be&s;t judge&endq;</P>
<P>The youth ordered &s;ome oy&s;ters.</P>
<P>There were none in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired a barrel might immediately be procu|red;
he could eat nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Still Edgar, though frequent opportunities occur|red,
had no fortitude to addre&s;s Camilla, and no &s;pi|rits
to &s;peak. To her, however, his dejection was a
revival; &s;he read in it her power, and hoped her pre|&s;ent
plan would finally confirm it.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant now came in, announcing a per&s;on who
had brought two letters, one for Sir Hugh, the other
for Mi&s;s Camilla, but who &s;aid he would deliver
them him&s;elf. The baronet de&s;ired he might be ad|mitted.</P>
<P>Several minutes pa&s;&s;ed, and he did not appear.
The wonder of Sir Hugh was awakened for his letter;
but Camilla, dreading a billet from Sir Sedley, was in
no ha&s;te.</P>
<P>Lynmere, however, glad of an opportunity to i&s;&s;ue
orders, or make di&s;turbance, furiou&s;ly rang the bell,
&s;aying: &startq;Where are the&s;e letters?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Jacob,&endq; $aid the baronet, &startq;my nephew don't
mean the &s;lowne&s;s to be any fault of yours, it being
what you can't help; only tell the per&s;on than brought
us our letters, we &s;hould be glad to look at them, not
knowing who they may be from.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="124">
&startq;Why he &s;eems but an odd &s;ort of $&s;h, &s;ir; I can't
much make him out; he's been begging &s;ome flour to
put in his hair; he'll make him&s;elf &s;o &s;pruce, he &s;ays,
we &s;ha'n't know him again; I can't much think he's a
gentleman.&endq;</P>
<P>He then, however, added he had made a mi&s;take,
as there was no letter for his ma&s;ter, but one for Mi&s;s
Camilla, and the other for Mi&s;s Margland.</P>
<P>&startq;For me?&endq; exclaimed Mi&s;s Margland, breaking
from a &s;cornful &s;ilence, during which her under lip
had been bu&s;y to expre&s;s her contempt of the curio&s;ity
excited upon this &s;ubject &startq;Why how dare they not
tell me it was for me? it may be from &s;omebody of
con&s;equence, about &s;omething of importance, and
here's half a day lo&s;t before I can &s;ee it!&endq;</P>
<P>She then ro&s;e to go in &s;earch of it her&s;elf, but
opened the door upon Mr. Dub&s;ter.</P>
<P>A gho&s;t, could &s;he have per&s;uaded her&s;elf &s;he had
&s;een one, could not more have a&s;toni&s;hed, though it
would more have di&s;mayed her. She drew haugh|tily
back, &s;aying: &startq;Is there nobody el&s;e to come?&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;ervant an&s;wered in the negative, and &s;he re|treated
to her chair.</P>
<P>Camilla alone was not perplext by this &s;ight; &s;he
had already, from the de&s;cription, &s;ugge&s;ted whom &s;he
might expect, according to the intimation given by
the ever mi&s;chievous Lionel.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, concluding he would turn out to
be &s;ome broken trade&s;man, prepared her&s;elf-to expect
that the letter was a petition, and watched for an op|portunity
to &s;teal out of the room.</P>
<P>Mr. Dub&s;ter made two or three low bows, while
he had his hand upon the door, and two or three more
when he had &s;hut it. He then ca&s;t his eyes round
the room, and e&s;pying Camilla, with a leering &s;or$
of &s;mile, &s;aid: &startq;O, you're there, ma'am! I &s;hould
find you our in a hundred. I've got a letter for you,
ma'am, and another for the gentlewoman I took for
your mamma; and I was not much out in my gue&s;s,
for there's no great difference, as one may &s;ay, be|tween
a mamma and a governe&s;s; only the mother's the
more natural, like.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="125">
He then pre&s;ented her a letter, which &s;he ha&s;tily
put up, not daring to venture at a public peru&s;al,
le&s;t it might contain not merely &s;omething ludi$rous
concerning Mr. Dub&s;ter, to which &s;he was wholly in|different,
but allu&s;ions to Sir Sedley Clarendel, which,
in the actual &s;ituation of things, might be fatally un|&s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P>&startq;And now,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dub&s;ter, &startq;I mu&s;t give up
my t'other letter, a&s;king the gentlewoman's pardon
for not giving it before; only I was willing to give
the young lady her's fir&s;t, young ladies being apt to
be more in a hurry than people a little in years.&endq;</P>
<P>This addre&s;s did not much add to the benevolent
eagerne&s;s of Mi&s;s Margland to read the epi&s;tle, and
endeavouring to decline accepting it: &startq;Really,&endq; &s;he
&s;aid, &startq;unle&s;s I know what it's about, I'm not much
u&s;ed to receiving letters in that manner.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to what it's about,&endq; cried he, with a half &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
&s;imper, and nodding his head on one &s;ide;
&startq;that's a bit of a &s;ecret, as you'll &s;ee when you've
read it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Indeed, good man, I wi&s;h you very well; but
as to reading all the letters that every body brings one,
it requires more time than I can pretend to have to
&s;pare, upon every trifling occa&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>She would then have retired; but Mr. Dub&s;ter,
&s;topping her, &s;aid: &startq;Why, if you don't read it, ma'
am, nobody'll be never the wi&s;er for what I come
about, for it's ungain-like to &s;peak for one's &s;elf; and
the young gentleman &s;aid he'd write to you, becau&s;e,
he &s;aid, you'd like it the be&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The young gentleman? what young gentle|man?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Young &s;quire Tyrold; he &s;aid you'd be as plea|&s;ed
as any thing to tell it to the old gentleman your|&s;elf;
for you was va&s;t fond, he &s;aid, of matrimo|ny.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Matrimony? what have I to do with matrimo|ny?&endq;
cried Mi&s;s Margland, reddening and bridling;
&startq;if it's any vulgar trick of that kind, that Mr. Lio|nel
is amu&s;ing him&s;elf with, I'm not quite the right
<PB N="325" REF="126">
&s;ort of per&s;on to be &s;o played upon; and I de&s;ire,
mi&s;ter, you'll take care how you come to me any more
upon &s;uch errands, le&s;t you meet with your proper de|&s;erts.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear heart! I'm not going to offer any thing un|civil.
As to matrimony, it's no great joke to a man,
when once he's made his way in the world; it's more
an affair of you ladies by half.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Of us? upon my word! this is a compliment ra|ther
higher than I expected. Mr. Lionel may find,
however, I have friends who will re&s;ent &s;uch im|pertinence,
if he imagines he may &s;end who he will
to me with propo&s;als of this &s;ort.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lauk, ma'am, you need not be in &s;uch a$$right
for nothing! however, there's your lett$$$ ma'am,&endq;
putting it upon the table; &startq;and when you are in bet|ter
cue, I &s;uppo&s;e you'll read it.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, advancing to Camilla: &startq;Now, ma'am, let's
you and I have a little talk together; but fir&s;t, by
good rights, I ought to &s;peak to your uncle only I
dont know which he is; 'twill be mortal kind if you'll
help a body out.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh was going to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, when
Lynmere, &s;at$gued with &s;o long a &s;cene in which
he had no &s;hare, had recour&s;e to his friend the bell,
calling out, at the &s;ame time, in a voice of impatience,
&startq;No oy&s;ters yet!&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now began to grow unhappy for his &s;er|vants;
for him&s;elf he no$ only could bear any thing,
but &s;till con$luded he had nothing to bear; but his
dome&s;tics began all to wear long fa$es, and, accu&s;tom|ed
to &s;ee them happy, he was hurt to ob&s;erve the
change. No partiality to his nephew could di&s;gui&s;e
to him, that, long u&s;ed to every po&s;&s;ible indulgence,
it was vain to hope they would &s;ubmit, without mur|muring,
to &s;o new a bondage of continual and pe|remptory
commands. In&s;tead of attending, therefore,
to Mr Dub&s;ter, he con&s;idered what apology to offer to
Jacob; who &s;u&s;pecting by whom he was &s;ummoned,
did not make his appearance till Lynmere had rung
again.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="127">
&startq;Where are the&s;e oy&s;ters?&endq; he then demanded&punc;
&startq;have you been eating them?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, &s;ir,&endq; an&s;wered he &s;urlily; &startq;we're not &s;o
&s;harp &s;et; we live in Old England; we don't come
from outlandi&s;h countries.&endq;</P>
<P>This true John Bulli&s;m, Lynmere had neither &s;en&s;e
to de&s;pi&s;e, nor humour to laugh at; and, &s;eriou&s;ly in
a rage, called out, &startq;Sirrah, I'll break your bones!&endq;
and li$ted up his riding &s;witch, with which, as well
as his boots, he had re-entered the parlour.</P>
<P>&startq;The Lord be good unto me!&endq; cried Sir Hugh,
&startq;what new ways are got into the world! but don't
take it to heart, Jacob, $or as to breaking your bones,
after all your long &s;ervices, it's a thing I &s;ha'n't con|&s;ent
to; which I hope my nephew won't take ill.&endq;</P>
<P>Affronted with the ma&s;ter, and enraged with the
man, Lynmere &s;troamed petulantly up and dwon the
room, with loud and marked &s;teps, that called, or at
lea&s;t di&s;turbed the attention of every one, exclaiming,
at every turning, &startq;A confounded country this! a
villainous country! nothing to be had in it! I don't
know what in the world to think of that there's any
chance I can get!&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, recovering, &s;aid he was &s;orry he was &s;o
badly off; and de&s;ired Jacob not to fail procuring
oy&s;ters if they were to be had within a mile.</P>
<P>&startq;A mile?&mdash;ten miles! &s;ay ten miles round,&endq;
cried Lynmere, &startq;or you do nothing; what's ten
miles for a thing of that &s;ort?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ten miles, nephew? what? at this time of night!
why you don't think, with all your travelling, that
when they've got ten miles there, they'll have ten
miles to come back, and that makes count twenty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Sir, and &s;uppo&s;e it was forty; what have
&s;uch fellows to do better?&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and Mr. Dub&s;ter &s;aid to
Camilla: &startq;So, ma'am, why you don't read your let|ter,
neither, no more than the gentlewoman; how|ever,
I think you may as well &s;ee a little what's in it;
though I &s;uppo&s;e no great matters, being from a
lady.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="128">
&startq;A lady$ what lady?&endq; cried &s;he, and eagerly ta|king
it from her pocket, &s;aw the hand-writing of
Mrs Berlinton, and inquired how it came into his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, that happening to meet the lady's
foo$man, whom he had known &s;omething of while in
bu&s;ine&s;s, as he was going to put it to the po&s;t, he
told him he was coming to the very hou&s;e, and &s;o took
it to bring him&s;elf, the man being rather in a hurry
to go another way; &startq;&s;o I thought 'twas as well,
ma'am,&endq; he added, &startq;to &s;ave you the po&s;tage; for as
to a day or &s;o &s;ooner or later, I &s;uppo&s;e it can break
no great &s;quares, in you ladies letter-writing.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, ha&s;tily running it over; found it contain|ed
a mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing repetition of invitation from Mrs.
Berlinton for the Southampton plan, and informa|tion
that &s;he &s;hould make a little circuit, to call and
take her up at Cleves, if not immediately forbidden;
the time &s;he named for her arrival, though four days
di&s;tant from the date of her letter, would be now
the following morning.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed, to the agitated &s;pirits of Camilla,
an inviting opening to her &s;cheme. She gave the
letter to her uncle, &s;aying, in a fluttered manner, &s;he
&s;hould be happy to accompany Mrs. Berlinton, for
a few days, if her father &s;hould not di&s;approve the
excur&s;ion, and if he could him&s;elf have the goodne&s;s
to &s;pare one of the carriages to fetch her home, as
Southampton was but &s;ixteen miles off.</P>
<P>While Sir Hugh, amazed at this reque&s;t, yet al|ways
unable to pronounce a negative to what &s;he de|&s;ired,
&s;tammered, Edgar abruptly took leave.</P>
<P>Thunder&s;truck by his departure, &s;he looked af|frighted,
after him, with a &s;igh impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;s;
&s;he now fir&s;t weighed the hazard of what &s;he was do|ing,
the deep game &s;he was incon&s;iderately playing.
Would it &s;under&mdash;would it unite them?&mdash;Tears
&s;tarted into her eyes at the doubt; &s;he did not hear
her uncle's an&s;wer; &s;he ro&s;e to hurry out of the room;
but before &s;he could e&s;cape, the big drops rolled fa&s;t
down her cheeks; and, when arrived at her chamber,
<PB N="328" REF="129">
&startq;I have lo&s;t him!&endq; &s;he cried, by my own unreflect|ing
precipitance; &startq;I have lo&s;t him, perhaps, for
ever!&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont now al&s;o took leave; Mr. Dub|&s;ter
de&s;ired he might &s;peak with the baronet the next
morning; and the family remained alone.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Dilemmas.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the baronet was pondering, in the mo&s;t
melancholy manner, upon this &s;udden and unexpect|ed
demand of ab&s;ence in Camilla, the grim godde&s;s
of Envy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fine features of Indi|ana;
who declared &s;he was immured alive, while her
cou&s;in went every where. The curio&s;ity of Lynmere
being excited, to inquire what was to be had or done
at Southampton, he heard it abounded in good com|pany,
and good fi&s;h, and prote&s;ted he mu&s;t undoubt|edly
&s;et out for it the next morning.</P>
<P>Indiana then wept with vexation and anger, and
Mi&s;s Margland affirmed, &s;he was the only young
lady in Hamp&s;hire, who had never been at South|ampton
Sir Hugh, concluding Edgar would attend
Camilla, feared it might hurt the other match to
part Eugenia from Clermont; and, after a little pau&s;e,
though deeply $ighing at &s;uch a di&s;per&s;ion from Cleves,
con&s;ented that they &s;hould all go together. Camilla,
therefore, was commi&s;&s;ioned to a&s;k leave of Mr. Ty|rold
for Eugenia, as well as for her&s;elf, and to add a
petition from Sir Hugh, that he and Lavinia would
&s;pend the time of their ab&s;ence at Cleves. The ba|ronet
then, of his own accord, a&s;ked Dr. Orkborne
<PB N="329" REF="130">
to be of the party, that Eugenia, he &s;aid, might
run over her le&s;&s;ons with him in a morning, for
fear of forgetting them.</P>
<P>A breach, however, &s;uch as this, of plans &s;o long
formed, and a de&s;ertion &s;o voluntary of his hou&s;e, at
the very epoch he had &s;ettled for rendering its re&s;i|dence
the mo&s;t de&s;irable, &s;ent him in complete di&s;|comfiture
to his bed. But there, in a few hours,
his &s;anguine temper, and the kindne&s;s of his heart
new modelled and new coloured the circum&s;tances
of his chagrin. He con&s;idered he &s;hould have
full time to prepare for the double marriages; and
that, with the aid of Lavinia, he might delight and
amaze them all, with new dre&s;&s;es and new trinkets,
which he could now choo&s;e without the torment of
continual oppo&s;ition from the documenti&s;ing Mi&s;s
Margland. Thus he re&s;tored his pla&s;tic mind to its
u&s;ual &s;atisfaction, and aro&s;e the next morning with|out
a cloud upon his brow. The pure de&s;ign of be|nevolence
is to be&s;tow happine&s;s upon others, but its
intrin&s;ic reward is bringing happine&s;s home!</P>
<P>But this &s;weetne&s;s of nature, &s;o aptly &s;upplying
the fir&s;t calls, and the fir&s;t virtues of philo&s;ophy, was
yet more &s;everely again tried the next morning:
for when, forgetting the caution he had &s;olemnly
promi&s;ed, but vainly endeavoured to ob&s;erve, he in|timated
to Lynmere the&s;e purpo&s;es, the youth, blu&s;h|ing
at the idea of being taken for the de&s;tined hu&s;|band
of Eugenia in public, preferred all ri&s;ks to be|ing
followed by &s;uch a rumour to Southampton;
and, when he found &s;he was to be of the party, po|&s;itively
declared the match to be out of all que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now &s;tood agha&s;t. Many had been his
di&s;appointments; his rage for forming &s;chemes, and
his credulity in per&s;uading him&s;e they would be &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
were &s;ources not more $ertile of amu&s;ement
in their projection, than of mortification in their
event: but here, the length of time &s;ince his plan had
been arranged, joined to the very &s;uperficial view he
had taken of any chance of its failure, had made him,
by degrees, regard it as &s;o fixed and &s;ettled, that it
<PB N="330" REF="131">
rather demanded congratulation than concurrence,
rather waited to be enjoyed than executed.</P>
<P>Lynmere took not the &s;malle&s;t intere&s;t in the di&s;|may
of his uncle, but, turning upon his heel, &s;aid
he would go to the &s;tables, to &s;ee if he could find
&s;omething that would carry him any better than the
mi&s;erable jade he had mounted the preceding even|ing.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh remained in a kind of &s;tupefaction. He
&s;eemed to him&s;elf to be bereft of every purpo&s;e of
life; and robbed at once, of all view for his actions,
all &s;ubject for his thoughts. The wide world, he be|lieved,
had never, hitherto, given birth to a plan &s;o
&s;aga$iou&s;ly conceived, &s;o rationally combined, &s;o in|&s;allibly
&s;ecure: yet it was fallen, cru&s;hed, rejected!</P>
<P>A gleam of &s;un&s;hine, however, ere long, emitted
upon his de&s;pondence; it occurred to him, that the
learned education of Eugenia was &s;till a &s;ecret to her
cou&s;in; his whole &s;cheme, therefore, might perhaps
yet be retrieved, when Lynmere &s;hould be informed
of the peculiar preparations made for his conjugal
happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Fetching now a long breath, to aid the revival of
his faculties and his &s;pirits, he con&s;idered how to open
his di&s;cour&s;e &s;o as to render it mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive, and
then &s;ent for Clermont to attend him in his chamber.</P>
<P>&startq;Nephew,&endq; cried he, upon his entrance, &startq;I am
now going to talk to you a little in your own way,
having &s;omething to tell you of, that, I believe, you
won't know how to hold cheap, being a thing that
belongs to your &s;tudies; that is to &s;ay, to your cou|&s;in's;
which, I hope, is pretty much the &s;ame thing,
at lea&s;t as to the end. Now the ca&s;e of what I have to
&s;ay is this; you mu&s;t know, nephew, I had always
fet my heart upon having a rich heir; but it's what
did not turn out, which I am &s;orry enough for;
but where's the man that's &s;o wi&s;e as to know his
own doom? that is, the doom of his fortune. How|ever,
that's what I &s;hould not talk of to you, ha|ving
&s;o little; which, I hope, you won't take to
heart. And, indeed, it in't much worth a wi&s;e
<PB N="331" REF="132">
man's thinking of, when he han't got it, for what's a
fortune, at bottom, but mere metal? And &s;o having,
as I &s;aid before, no heir, I'm forced, in default of it,
to take up with an heire&s;s. But, to the end of ma|king
all parties happy, I've had her brought up in the
&s;tyle of a boy, for the &s;ake of your marrying her.
For which rea&s;on, I believe, in point of the cla&s;&s;ics&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Me, &s;ir!&endq; cried Lynmere, recovering from a long
yawning fit, &startq;and what have I to do with marrying
a girl like a boy? That's not my ta&s;te, my dear &s;ir,
I a&s;&s;ure you. Be&s;ides, what has a wife to do with the
cla&s;&s;ics? will they &s;how her how to order her table?
I &s;uppo&s;e when I want to eat, I may go to a cook's
&s;hop!&endq;</P>
<P>Here &s;ub&s;ided, at once, every particle of that re|verence
Sir Hugh had &s;o long nouri&s;hed for Clermont
Lynmere. To hear the cla&s;&s;ics &s;poken of with di&s;re|&s;pect,
after all the pains he had taken, all the orders
he had given for their exclu&s;ive &s;tudy and veneration,
and to find the common calls of life, which he had be|lieved
every &s;cholar regarded but as means of exi&s;tence,
not auxiliaries of happine&s;s, named with preference,
di&s;tanced, at a &s;troke, all high opinion of his nephew,
and made way, in its &s;tead, for a di&s;plea&s;ure not
wholly free from di&s;dain.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Clermont,&endq; &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e, &startq;I
won't keep you any longer, now I know your mind,
which I wi&s;h I had known before, for the account of
your cou&s;in, who has had plague enough about it in
her bringing up; which, however, I &s;hall put an end
to now, not &s;eeing that any good has come from it.&endq;</P>
<P>Lynmere joyfully accepted the permi&s;&s;ion to retire,
enchanted that the rejection was thus completely off
his mind, and had incurred only &s;o &s;light a reproof,
unaccompanied with one menace, or even remon|&s;trance.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;ternation of Sir Hugh, at the fall of
this favourite project, was, indeed, &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened,
at this moment, by the fall of his re&s;pectful opinion
of its principal object. He &s;ent therefore, ha&s;tily,
for Eugenia, to whom he abruptly exclaimed, &startq;My
<PB N="332" REF="133">
dear girl, who'd have thought it? here's your cou&s;in
Clermont, with all his Greek and Latin, which I be|gin
to ble&s;s God I don't know a word of, turning out
a mere common nothing, thinking about his dinners
and &s;uppers! for which rea&s;on I beg you'll think of
him no more, it not being worth your while; in par|ticular,
as he don't de&s;ire it.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, at this intimation, felt nearly as much re|lieved
as di&s;turbed. To be refu&s;ed was, indeed,
&s;hocking; not to her pride, &s;he was a &s;tranger to
that pa&s;&s;ion; but to her delicacy, which pointed out
to her, in &s;trong colours, the impropriety of having
been expo&s;ed to &s;uch a deci&s;ion: neverthele&s;s, to find
her&s;elf un&s;hackled from an alliance to which &s;he look|ed
forward with dread, without offending her uncle,
to whom &s;o many rea&s;ons made it dear, or militating
again&s;t her own heroic &s;entiments of genero&s;ity, which
revolted again&s;t wilfully depriving her cou&s;in of an in|heritance
already offered to him, removed a weight
from her mind, which his every word, look, and ge&s;|ture,
had contributed to increa&s;e &s;ince their fir&s;t meet|ing.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont had ridden to Beech Park, where
he had &s;pent the night, though univited by its agita|ted
owner, whom the very name of Mrs Berlinton,
annexed to an accepted party of plea&s;ure, had driven,
in &s;peechle&s;s agony, from Cleves.</P>
<P>&startq;I wonder not,&endq; cried he&punc; &startq;at your di&s;turbance;
I feel for it, on the contrary, more than ever, from
my ob&s;ervations of this evening; for I now &s;ee the
charm, the potent charm, as well as the difficulties of
your &s;ituation. This &s;trange affair with Sir Sedley
Clarendel cannot, in common fore&s;ight of what may
en&s;ue from it, be pa&s;&s;ed over without the mo&s;t rigid
&s;crutiny, and &s;evere&s;t deliberation; yet, I &s;incerely
hope, inquiry may produce &s;ome palliation: this young
lady, I &s;ee, will not ea&s;ily, for &s;weetne&s;s, for counte|nance,
for every apparent attraction, be replaced:
and, the fir&s;t of all requi&s;ites is certainly in your fa|vour;
<PB N="333" REF="134">
it is evident &s;he loves you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Loves me?&endq; cried Edgar, his arms involuntarily
encircling him as he repeated the magneti&s;ing words:
&startq;Ah! Dr. Marchmont, could &s;he then thus grieve
and defy me?&mdash;And yet, &s;o too &s;aid Jacob,&mdash;that
good, faithful, excellent old &s;ervant&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes; I watched her unremittingly; and &s;aw
her &s;o much hurt by your abrupt retreat, that her
eyes filled with rears the moment you left the room.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, Dr. Marchmont!&mdash;and for me were they
&s;hed?&mdash;my dear&mdash;dear friend!&mdash;withhold from me
&s;uch a picture&mdash;or reconcile me completely to viewing
no other!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Once more, let me warn you to circum&s;pection.
The &s;take for which you are playing is life in its be&s;t
part, 'tis peace of mind. That her manners are en|gaging,
that her looks are captivating, and even that
her heart is yours, admit no doubt: but the &s;olidity or
the lightne&s;s of that heart are yet to be proved.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Still, Doctor, though nearly in defiance of all
my &s;en&s;es, &s;till I can doubt any thing rather than
the heart of Camilla! Precipitate, I know, &s;he has
always been reckoned; but her precipitance is of
kin to her noble&s;t virtues; it &s;prings but from the
un&s;u&s;picious &s;rankne&s;s of an unguarded, becau&s;e in|nocent
nature. And this, in a &s;hort time, her un|der&s;tanding
will correct.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are you &s;ure it is adequate to the ta&s;k? There
is often, in early youth, a quickne&s;s of parts which
rai&s;es expectations that are never reali&s;ed. Their
origin is but in the animal &s;pirits, which, in&s;tead of
ripening into judgment and &s;en&s;e by added years,
dwindle into nothingne&s;s, or harden into flippancy.
The character, at this period, is often &s;o un&s;table,
as to be completely new moulded by every new ac|cident,
or new a&s;&s;ociate. How innumerable are the
lurking ill qualities that may lie dormant beneath
the &s;miles of youth and beauty, in the &s;ea&s;on of their
untried &s;erenity! The contemporaries of half our
fierce&s;t viragos of fifty, may a&s;&s;ure you that, at fif|teen,
they were all &s;oftne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s. The
<PB N="334" REF="135">
pre&s;ent aera, however, my dear young friend, is high|ly
favourable to all you can judiciou&s;ly wi&s;h; namely,
the entire re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, or total de&s;truction of all
confidence.&mdash;To a man of your nice feelings, there is
no medium. Your love demands re&s;pect, or your
tranquillity exacts flight from its object. Set apart
your offence at the cultivation of an acquaintance
you di&s;approve; be your&s;elf of the party to South|ampton,
and there, a very little ob&s;ervation will ena|ble
you to dive into the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of her
character&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Steadine&s;s, Doctor, I do not want, nor yet, how|ever
I &s;uffer from its exertion, fortitude: but a plan
&s;uch as this, requires &s;omething more; it calls for an
equivocal conduct, which, to me, would be impracti|cable,
and to her, might prove delu&s;ive. No!&mdash;the
openne&s;s I &s;o much pine to meet with, I mu&s;t, at lea&s;t,
not forfeit my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The fervour of your integrity, my dear Mandle|bert,
mi&s;takes caution for deceit. If, indeed, this
plan had any other view than your union, it would
not merely be cruel, but infamous: the truth, how|ever,
is, you mu&s;t either pur&s;ue her upon proof, or
abandon her at once, with every chance of repenting
&s;uch a mea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! how torturing is hefitation! to believe
my&s;elf the object of her regard&mdash;to think that fir&s;t
of all human felicities mine, yet to find it &s;o pli|ant&mdash;
&s;o precarious&mdash;to &s;ee her, with &s;uch thought|le&s;s
readine&s;s, upon the point of falling into the hands
of another!&mdash;receiving&mdash;an&s;wering&mdash;his letters!&mdash;
letters too &s;o confident, &s;o daring! made up of in&s;o|lent
demands and imperious reproaches&mdash;to meet him
by his own appointment&mdash;O, Dr. Marchmont! all
delicious as is the idea of her preference&mdash;all en|twined
as &s;he is around my &s;oul, how, now, how
ever again, can I be happy, either to quit&mdash;or to
claim her?&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This divi&s;ion of &s;entiment is what gives ri&s;e to my
plan. At Southampton, you will &s;ee if Sir Sedley
pur&s;ues her; and, as &s;he will be uncertain of your
<PB N="335" REF="136">
intentions, you will be enabled to judge the &s;inglene&s;s
of her mind, and the &s;tability of her affection by the
reception &s;he gives him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But if&mdash;as I think I can gather from her deliver|ing
me his letters, the affair, whatever it has been,
with Sir Sedley, is over&punc;&mdash;What then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will have lei&s;ure to di&s;cu&s;s it; and oppor|tunity,
al&s;o, to &s;ee her with other Sir Sedleys. Pub|lic
places abound with tho&s;e flutterers after youth and
beauty; unmeaning admirers, who &s;igh at every new
face; or black traitors to &s;ociety, who &s;eek but to
try, and try but to publi&s;h their own power of con|que&s;t&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Will you, then, my dear Doctor, be al&s;o of the
party? for my &s;ake, will you, once more, quit your
&s;tudies and repo&s;e, to give me, upon the &s;pot, your
coun&s;el, according to the va$ying exigence of vary|ing
circum&s;tances? to aid me to prepare and compo&s;e
my mind for whatever may be the event, and to guide
even, if po&s;&s;ible, my wavering and di&s;tracted thoughts.&endq;</P>
<P>To the importance of the period, and to a plea &s;o
&s;erious, every ob&s;tacle yielded, and Dr. Marchmont
agreed to accompany him to Southampton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Live and Learn.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the Cleves party a&s;&s;embled to breakfa&s;t,
after the various arrangements made for Southamp|ton,
Mr. Dub&s;ter arrived, and demanded an inter|view
with Sir Hugh, who, attending him to the draw|ing-room,
a&s;ked his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, have you not read the young gentleman's
<PB N="336" REF="137">
letter, &s;ir?&endq; cried he, &s;urpri&s;ed, &startq;becau&s;e he &s;aid.
he'd put it all down, clear as a pike &s;taff, to &s;ave
time.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh had not heard of it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, if you plea&s;e, &s;ir, we'll go and a&s;k
that elderly gentlewoman, what &s;he's done with it.
She might as well have &s;hewed it, after the young
gentleman's taking the trouble to write it to her. But
&s;he is none of the good naturede&s;t I take it.&endq;</P>
<P>Repairing, then, to Mi&s;s Margland, after his u&s;ual
bows to all the company, &startq;I a&s;k pardon, ma'am,&endq; he
cried; &startq;but pray, what's the rea&s;on of your keeping
the young gentleman's letter to your&s;elf, which was
writ o'purpo&s;e to let the old gentleman know what I
come for?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Becau&s;e I never trouble my&s;elf with any thing
that's impertinent;&endq; &s;he haughtily an&s;wered: though,
in fact, when the family had retired, &s;he had &s;tolen
down &s;tairs, and read the letter; which contained a
warm recommendation of Mr. Dub&s;ter to her favour,
with abundant flippant offers to promote her own in|tere&s;t
for &s;o de&s;irable a match, &s;hould Camilla prove
blind to its advantages. This &s;he had then burnt,
with a determination never to acknowledge her con|de&s;cen&s;ion
in opening it.</P>
<P>The repeated calls of Mr. Dub&s;ter procuring no
further &s;atisfaction; &startq;Why, then, I don't &s;ee.&endq; he
&s;aid, &startq;but what I'm as bad off, as if the young gen|tleman
had not writ the letter, for I've got to &s;peak
for my&s;elf at la&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Taking Sir Hugh, then, by a button of his coat,
he de&s;ired he would go back with him to the other
parlour: and there, with much circumlocution, and
unqualified declarations of his having given over all
thoughts of further marrying, till the young gentle|man
over per&s;uaded him of his being particular agree|able
to the young lady, he &s;olemnly propo&s;ed him&s;elf
for Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who perceived in this addre&s;s nothing
that was ridiculous, was &s;omewhat drawn from re|flecting
on his own di&s;appointment, by the pity he con|ceived
<PB N="337" REF="138">
for this hopele&s;s &s;uitor, to whom, with equal
circumlocution of concern, he communicated, that his
niece was on the point of marriage with a neighbour.</P>
<P>&startq;I know that,&endq; replied Mr. Dub&s;ter, nodding &s;a|gaciou&s;ly,
&startq;the young gentleman having told me of
the young baronight; but he &s;aid, it was all again&s;t
her will, being only your over tea&s;ing, and the like.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Lord be good unto me!&endq; exclaimed the ba|ronet,
holding up his hands; &startq;if I don't think all
the young boys have a mind to drive me out of my
wits, one after t'other.&endq;</P>
<P>Hurrying, then, back to the breakfa&s;t parlour,
and to Camilla, &startq;Come hither, my dear,&endq; he cried,
&startq;for here's a gentleman come to make his addre&s;&s;es
to you, that won't take an an&s;wer.&endq;</P>
<P>Every &s;erious thought, and every melancholy ap|prehen&s;ion
in Camilla gave place, at this &s;peech, to
the ludicrous machinations of Lionel. She took Sir
Hugh by the hand, and, drawing him away to the
mo&s;t di&s;tant window, &s;aid, in a low voice &startq;My dear
uncle, this is a mere trick of Lionel; the per&s;on you
&s;ee here is, I believe, a tinker.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A tinker!&endq; repeated Sir Hugh, quite loud, in
defiance of the &s;igns and hi&s;ts! hi&s;ts! of Camilla,
&startq;good lack! that's a per&s;on I &s;hould never have
thought of!&endq; Then walking up to Mr. Dub&s;ter, who
was taking into his hands all the ornaments from the
chimney-piece, one by one, to examine, &startq;Sir,&endq; he
&s;aid, &startq;you may be a very good &s;ort of man, and I
don't doubt but you are, for I've a proper re&s;pect for
every trade in its way; but in point of marrying my
niece, it's a thing I mu&s;t beg you to put out of your
head; it not being a proper &s;ubject to talk of to a
young lady, from a per&s;on in that line.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Very well, &s;ir,&endq; an&s;wered Mr. Dub&s;ter, &s;tiffly,
and pouting, &startq;it's not of much con&s;equence; don't
make your&s;elf unea&s;y. There's nothing in what I
was going to propo&s;e but what was quite genteel. I'd
&s;corn to addre&s;s a lady el&s;e. She'd have a good five
hundred a-year, in ca&s;e of outliving me.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="139">
&startq;Good lack! five hundred a year! who'd have
thought of &s;uch a thing by the tinkering bu&s;ine&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The what bu&s;ine&s;s, did you &s;ay, &s;ir?&endq; cried
Mr. Dub&s;ter, &s;trutting up to the baronet, with a &s;o|lemn
frown.</P>
<P>&startq;The tinkering bu&s;ine&s;s, my good friend. An't
you a tinker?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sir!&endq; cried Mr. Dub&s;ter, &s;welling, &startq;I did $ot
think, when I was coming to make &s;uch a hand&s;ome
offer, of being affronted at &s;uch a rate as this. Not
that I mind it. It's not worth fretting about. How|ever,
as to a tinker, I'm no more a tinker than your|&s;elf,
whatever put it in your head.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good lack, my dear,&endq; cried the baronet, to Ca|milla,
&startq;the gentleman quite denies it.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, though unable to refrain from laughing,
confe&s;&s;ed &s;he had received the information from Mrs.
Arlbery at the Northwick breakfa&s;t, who, &s;he now
&s;uppo&s;ed, had &s;aid it in random &s;port.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh cordially begged his pardon, and a&s;ked
him to take a &s;eat at the breakfa&s;t table, to &s;often the
unde&s;igned offence.</P>
<P>A note now arrived from Mr. Tyrold to the ba|ronet.
It contained his con&s;ent to return, with La|vinia,
to Cleves, and his ready acquie&s;cence in the
little excur&s;ion to Southampton, &s;ince Mi&s;s Margland
would be &s;uperintendant of the party; &startq;and &s;ince,&endq;
he added, &startq;they will have another guardian, to whom
already I con&s;ign my Camilla, and, upon her account,
my dear Eugenia al&s;o, with the &s;ame fearle&s;s confidence
I &s;hould feel in &s;eeing them again under the mater|nal
wing.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, who always read his letters aloud, &s;aid,
when he had done: &startq;See what it is to be a good boy!
my brother looks upon young Mr. Edgar as the&s;e young
girls' hu&s;band already; that is, of one of them; by
which means the other becomes his &s;i&s;ter; which, I'm
&s;ure, is a trouble he won't mind, except as a plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla's di&s;tre&s;s at this &s;peech pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed,
from the abrupt entrance of Lynmere, giving orders
aloud to his &s;ervant to get ready for Southampton.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="140">
Inflamed with triumph in his recent &s;ucce&s;s in baf|fling
his uncle, that youth was in the mo&s;t turbulent
&s;pirits, and fixed a re&s;olution either to lord it over the
whole hou&s;e, or regain at once his liberty for return|ing
to the Continent.</P>
<P>Forcing a chair between Sir Hugh and Camilla, he
&s;eized rapidly whatever looked mo&s;t inviting from
every plate on the table, to place upon his own, mur|muring
the whole time again&s;t the hor&s;es, declaring
the &s;tud the mo&s;t wretched he had ever &s;een, and pro|te&s;ting
the old groom mu&s;t be turned away without
lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P>&startq;What, Jacob?&endq; cried the baronet; &startq;why, ne|phew,
he has lived with me from a boy: and now he's
grown old, I'd&punc; &s;ooner rub down every hor&s;e with my
own hand, than part with him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He mu&s;t certainly go, &s;ir. There's no keeping
him. I may be tempted el&s;e to knock his brains out
&s;ome day. Be&s;ides, I have a very good fellow I can
recommend to you of my own.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Clermont, I've no doubt of his being a
good fellow, which I'm very glad of; but as to
your always knocking out the brains of my &s;ervants,
it's a thing I mu&s;t beg you not to talk of any more,
being again&s;t the law. Be&s;ides which, it don't
&s;ound very kind of you, con&s;idering their having done
you no harm; never having &s;een your face, as one
may &s;ay, except ju&s;t to wait upon you; which can
hardly be reckoned a bad office; be&s;ides a &s;ervant's
being a man, as well as you; whether Homer and
Horace tell you &s;o or no.&endq;</P>
<P>To &s;ee Sir Hugh di&s;plea&s;ed, was a &s;ight new to the
whole hou&s;e. Camilla and Eugenia, mutually pained
for him, endeavoured, by various little kind offices,

ro&s;e in &s;pirits and in in&s;olence upon the &s;ame idea: too
&s;hallow to know, that of all the qualities with which
the perver&s;ity of human nature is gifted, the power
which is the mo&s;t common to attain, and the mo&s;t
ea&s;y to practi&s;e, is the art of provoking.</P>

Jacob now appearing, Lynmere ordered &s;ome
&s;hrimps.</P>
<P>There were none.</P>
<P>&startq;No &s;hrimps? There's nothing to be had! 'Tis
a wretched county this.!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You'll get nice &s;hrimps at Southampton, &s;ir, by
what I can hear,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Dub&s;ter. &startq;Tom Hicks &s;ays
he has been &s;ick with 'em many a day, he's eat &s;uch
a heap. They gets 'em by hundreds, and hundreds,
and hundreds at a time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pray, nephew how long &s;hall you &s;tay? becau&s;e
of my nieces coming back at the &s;ame time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A fortnight's enough to tire me any where, &s;ir.
Pray what do you all do with your&s;elves here after
breakfa&s;t? What's your mode?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mode, nephew? we've got no particular mode
that ever I heard of. However, among &s;o many of us,
I think it's a little hard, if you can find nothing to
&s;ay to us; all in a manner, your relations too.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We take no notice of relations now, &s;ir; that's
out.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'm &s;orry for it, nephew, for a relation's a relation,
whether you take notice of him or not. And there's
ne'er an ode in Virgil will tell you to the contrary,
as I believe.&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;hort &s;ilence now en&s;ued, which was broken by
a &s;igh from Sir Hugh, who ejaculated to him&s;elf,
though aloud, &startq;I can't but think what my poor friend
We&s;twyn will do, if his &s;on's came home in this man|ner!
caring for nobody, but an oy&s;ter, or a &s;hrimp;
&mdash;unle&s;s it's a new&s;paper!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what &s;hould a man care for el&s;e, my good
old friend, in a de&s;art place &s;uch as this?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good old friend!&endq; repeated the baronet; &startq;to
be &s;ure, I'm not very young&punc;&mdash;However, as to that&mdash;
but you mean no harm, I know, for which rea&s;on I
can't be &s;o ill-natured as to take it ill. However, if
poor We&s;twyn is &s;erved in this&mdash;way&mdash;He's my dear|e&s;t
friend that I've got, out of us all here, of my own
kin, and he's got only one &s;on, and he &s;ent him to
foreign parts only for cheapne&s;s; and if he &s;hould
<PB N="341" REF="142">
happen to like nothing he can get at home, it won't
an&s;wer much in &s;aving, to &s;end out for things all day
long.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O don't be troubled, &s;ir; We&s;twyn's but a poor
creature, He'll take up with any thing. He live
within his allowance the whole time. A mighty poor
creature.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I'm glad of it! glad of it indeed!&endq; cried Sir
Hugh, with involuntary eagerne&s;s; &startq;I &s;hould have
been &s;orry if my poor good old friend had had &s;uch
di&s;appointment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Upon my honour,&endq; cried Lynmere, piqued, &startq;the
quoz of the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on are beyond what a man
could have hoped to &s;ee!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Quoz! what's quoz, nephew?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, it's a thing there's no explaining to you &s;ort
of gentlemen; and &s;ometimes we &s;ay quiz; my good
old &s;ir.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, now, f$r almo&s;t the fir&s;t time in his life,
felt &s;eriou&s;ly affronted. His utmo&s;t lenity could not
palliate the wilful di&s;re&s;pect of this language; and,
with a look of grave di&s;plea&s;ure, he an&s;wered, &startq;Re|ally,
nephew, I can't but &s;ay, I think you've got rather
a particular odd way of &s;peaking to per&s;ons. As to
talking &s;o much about people's being old, you'd do
well to con&s;ider that's no fault in any body; except
one's years, which is what we can't be &s;aid to help.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You de&s;cant too much upon words, &s;ir; we have
left off, now, u&s;ing them with &s;uch prodigious preci&s;ion.
It's quite over, fir.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, my dear Clermont!&endq; cried Sir Hugh, lo&s;ing
his &s;hort movement of anger in a more tender &s;en|&s;ation
of concern, &startq;how it goes to my heart to &s;ee
you turn out &s;uch a jackanapes!&endq;</P>
<P>Lynmere, re&s;entfully hanging back, &s;aid no more:
and Mr. Dub&s;ter, having drunk &s;even di&s;hes of tea,
with a long apology between each for the trouble,
gladly &s;eized the moment of pau&s;e, to a&s;k Camilia
when &s;he had heard from <HI>their friend Mrs. Mittin,</HI>
adding, &startq;I &s;hould have brought you a letter from
her, ma'am, my&s;elf, but that I was rather out of &s;orts
<PB N="342" REF="143">
with her; for happening to meet her, the day as you
went, walking on them Pantiles, with &s;ome of her
quality binding, when I was not dre&s;&s;ed out quite in
my be&s;t becomes, &s;he made as if &s;he did not know me.
Not as it &s;ignifies. It's pretty much of a muchne&s;s
to me. I remember her another &s;ort of per&s;on to what
&s;he looks now, before I was a gentleman my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, pray, what was you then, &s;ir?&endq; cried Sir
Hugh, with great &s;implicity.</P>
<P>&startq;As to that, &s;ir, there's no need to &s;ay whether I
was one thing or another, as I know of; I'm not in
the lea&s;t a&s;hamed of what I was.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh &s;eeing him offended, was beginning an
apology; but, interrupting him, &startq;No, &s;ir, &startq;he &s;aid,
&startq;there's no need to &s;ay nothing about it. It's not a
thing to take much to heart. I've been defamed often
enough, I hope, to be above minding it. Only ju&s;t
this one thing, &s;ir; I beg I may have the &s;avour to
be introduced to that lady as had the obligingne&s;s to
call me a tinker, when I never was no &s;uch thing.&endq;</P>
<P>Breakfa&s;t now being done, the ladies retired to pre|pare
for their journey.</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; cried Mr. Dub&s;ter, looking after Euge|niat
&startq;that little lady will make no great figure at
&s;uch a place as Southton. I would not have her look
out for a hu&s;band there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She'd have been ju&s;t the thing for me!&endq; cried
Lynmere, haughtily ri&s;ing, and conceitedly parading
his fine form up and down the room; hi seyes catching
it from looking-gla&s;s, to looking gla&s;s; by every po&s;&s;ible
contrivance; &startq;ju&s;t the thing matched to perfection!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lord help me! if I don't find my&s;elf in the dark
about every thing'&endq; cried Sir Hugh; &startq;who'd have
thought of you &s;cholars thinking &s;o much of beauty; I
&s;hould be glad to know what your cla&s;&s;ics &s;ay to that
point?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Faith, my good &s;ir, I never trouble my&s;elf to
a&s;k. From the time we begin our tours, we wipe
away all that &s;tuff as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible from our thoughts.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, pray, nephew, what harm could it do to
your tours?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="144">
&startq;We want room, &s;ir, room in the pericranium!
As &s;oon as we being to travel, we give up every thing
to ta&s;te. And then we want clear heads. Clear
heads, &s;ir, for pictures, &s;tatues, bu&s;ts, alto relievos,
ba&s;&s;o relievos, tablets, monuments, mau&s;oleums&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;If you go on at that rate, nephew,&endq; interrupted
Sir Hugh, holding his ears, &startq;you'll put my poor head
quite into a whirligig. And it's none of the deepe&s;t
already, Lord help me!&endq;</P>
<P>Lynmere now, without ceremony, made off; and
Mr. Dub&s;ter, left alone with the baronet, &s;aid they
might as well proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s. &startq;So pray, &s;ir, if I
may make bold, in the ca&s;e we come to a right un|der&s;tanding
about the young lady, what do you pro|po&s;e
to give her down?&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh, &s;taring, inquired what he meant:</P>
<P>&startq;Why, I mean, &s;ir, what &s;hall you give her at the
fir&s;t? I know &s;he's to have it all at your demi&s;e;
but that i'n't the bird in the hand&punc; Now, when once
I know that, I can make my offers, which &s;hall be
hand&s;ome or not, according. And that's but fair.
So how much can you part with, &s;ir?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not a Guinea!&endq; cried Sir Hugh, with &s;ome
emotion; &startq;I can't give her any thing! Mr. Edgar
knows that.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That's hard, indeed, &s;ir. What nothing for
a &s;etting out? And, pray, &s;ir, what may the &s;um
total be upon your demi&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not a penny!&endq; cried Sir$ Hugh, with &s;till more
agitation: &startq;Don't you know I've di&s;inherited her?&endq;.</P>
<P>&startq;Di&s;inherited her? why this is bad news enough!
And pray, &s;ir, what for?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing! She never offended me in thought, word,
nor deed,!</P>
<P>&startq;Well, that's odd enough. And when did you do
it, &s;ir?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The very week &s;he was nine years old, poor
thing! which I &s;hall never forget as long as I live,
being my wor&s;t action.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, this is particular enough! And young
'&s;quire Tyrold's never heard a word of it: which is
&s;omewhat of a wonder too.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="145">
&startq;Not heard of it? why the whole family know it!
I've &s;ettled every thing I was worth in the world
upon her younger &s;i&s;ter, that you &s;aw &s;itting by her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, if Tom Hicks did not as good as tell me
&s;o ever &s;o long ago, though the young '&s;quire &s;aid it
was all to the contrary: what for, I don't know;
unle&s;s to take me in. But he won't find that quite &s;o
ea&s;y, a&s;king his pardon. Matrimony's a good thing
enough, when it's to help a man forward: but a per|&s;on
mu&s;t be a fool indeed, to put him&s;elf out of his
way for nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>He then formally wi&s;hed the baronet a good day,
and ha&s;tened from the hou&s;e, puffed up with vain
glory, at his own &s;agacious precautions, which had
thus happily &s;aved him from being tricked into un|profitable
wedlock.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton now arrived, and as Camilla was
ready, though trembling, doubtful, apprehen&s;ive of the
&s;tep &s;he was taking, declined alighting. A general
meeting was to take place at the inn: and the baroner,
putting a twenty pound note into her hand, with the
mo&s;t $ender ble&s;&s;ings parted with his darling niece.
And then, &s;urpri&s;ed at not &s;eeing Edgar to breakfa&s;t,
&s;ent his butler to tell him the hi&s;tory of the excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lynmere was already &s;et off on hor&s;eback: and
the party, con&s;i&s;ting of Dr. Orkborne, Mi&s;s Margland,
Indiana, and Eugenia, followed two hours after, in
the coach of the baronet, which drove from the park as
the chai&s;e entered it with Mr. Tyrold and Lavinia,
to &s;upply their places.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Way to make friends.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Camilla appeared at the halldoor, a gen|tleman
de&s;cended from the carriage of Mrs. Berlin|ton,
with an air the mo&s;t melancholy, and eyes bent
to the earth, in the mournful bow with which he
offered her his hand: though, when he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted
her into the coach, he rai&s;ed them, and, turning round,
ca&s;t upon the man&s;ion a look of de&s;ponding fondne&s;s,
that immediately brought to her recollection young
Melmond, the Oxford &s;tudent, and the brother of her
new friend.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton received her with tenderne&s;s, folding
her to her brea&s;t, and declaring life to be now in&s;uppor|table
without her.</P>
<P>The affection of Camilla was nearly reciprocal, but
her plea&s;ure had no chance of equal participation;
nor was the &s;u&s;pen&s;ive &s;tate of her mind the only im|pediment;
oppo&s;ite to her in the carriage, and imme|diately
claiming her attention, was Mrs. Mittin.</P>
<P>The agitative events which had filled up the &s;hort
interval of her re&s;idence at Cleves, had &s;o completely
occupied every faculty, that, till the affair of the hor&s;e
involved her in new difficulties, her debts had entire|ly
flown her remembrance; and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes
which immediately &s;ucceeded to that forced recollec|tion,
made its duration as &s;hort as it was irk&s;ome; but
the &s;ight of Mrs. Mirtin brought it back with violence
to her memory; and fla&s;hed it, with &s;hame, upon her
con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The twenty pounds, however, ju&s;t given her by Sir
Hugh, occurred at the &s;ame moment to her thoughts;
and &s;he determined to repair her negligence, by appro|priating
it into parcels for the payment of all &s;he
owed, before &s;he &s;uffered &s;leep again to do&s;e her eyes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton informed her, that both her&s;elf and
<PB N="346" REF="147">
her brother had been &s;ummoned to Southampton to
meet Mrs Ecton, the aunt by whom &s;he had been
educated, who had ju&s;t arrived there from Wales,
upon &s;ome &s;ecret bu&s;ine&s;s, nece&s;&s;ary for her to hear,
but which could not be revealed by letters.</P>
<P>The journey, though in it&s;elf &s;hort and plea&s;ant,
proved to Camilla long and weari&s;ome; the beauties
of the pro&s;pect were acknowledged by her eye, but her
mind, dead to plea&s;ure, refu&s;ed to give them their
merited effect. To the charms of nature &s;he could
not be blind; her fervent imagination, and the le&s;&s;ons
of her youth, combined to do them ju&s;tice; but &s;he
thought not of them at this moment; hill, vale, or
plain, were unintere&s;ting, however beautiful; it was
Edgar &s;he looked for; Edgar, who thus coldly had
&s;uffered her to depart, but who &s;till, it was po&s;&s;ible,
might pur&s;ue; and hope, ever active, painted him,
as &s;he proceeded, in every di&s;tant object that caught
her eye, whether living or inanimate, brightening,
from time to time, the ro&s;es of her cheeks with the
felicity of a &s;peedy reconciliation; but upon every
near approach, the flattering error was detected, and
neither hill, vale, nor plain, could di&s;pel the di&s;ap|pointment.
A fine country, and diver&s;ified views, may
&s;often even the keene&s;t affliction of decided misfortune,
and tranquili&s;e the mo&s;t gloomy &s;adne&s;s into re&s;ignation
and compo&s;ure; but &s;u&s;pen&s;e rejects the gentle
palliative; 'tis an ab&s;orbent of the faculties that &s;uffers
them to &s;ee, hear, and feel only its own perplexity;
and the finer the fibres of the &s;en&s;ibility on which it
&s;eizes, the more exclu&s;ive is its depoti&s;m; doubt, in
a fervent mind, from the rapidity of its evolutions be|tween
fear in its utmo&s;t de&s;pondence, and hope in its
fulle&s;t rapture, is little &s;hort of torture.</P>
<P>They drove immediately to an elegant hou&s;e, &s;itu|ated
upon a &s;mall eminence, half a mile without the
town of Southampton, which had already been &s;ecu|red;
and Mrs. Berlinton, as &s;oon as &s;he had cho&s;er,
the plea&s;ante&s;t apartment it afforded for Camilla, and
&s;uffered Mrs. Mittin to choo&s;e the next plea&s;ant for
her&s;elf, went, accompanied by her brother, to the lod|ging
of Mrs. Ecton.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="148">
Left alone, Camilla &s;tationed her&s;elf down, at a win-believing
&s;he meant to look at the pro&s;pect; but her
eye, faithful to her heart, roved up and down the high
road, and took in only chai&s;es or hor&s;emen, till Mrs.
Mittin, with her cu&s;tomary familiarity, came into the
room. &startq;Well my dear mi&s;s,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;you're
welcome to Southampton, and welcome to Mrs. Ber|linton,
&s;he's a nice lady as ever I knew; I &s;uppo&s;e
you're &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee us &s;o great together? but I'll
tell you how it came about. You mu&s;t know, ju&s;t
as you was gone, I happened to be in the book &s;hop
when &s;he came in, and a&s;ked for a book; the Peruvan
Letters &s;he called it; and it was not at home, and
&s;he looked quite vexed, for &s;he &s;aid &s;he had looked
the catalogue up and down and &s;aw nothing
el&s;e &s;he'd a mind to; &s;o I thought it would be a
good opportunity to oblige her, and be a way to make
a prodigious genteel acquaintance be&s;ides; &s;o I took
down the name, and I found out the lady that had got
the book, and I made her a vi&s;it, and I told her it
was particular wanted by a lady that had a rea&s;on;
&s;o &s;he let me have it, and I took it to my pretty lady,
who was &s;o plea&s;ed, &s;he did not know how to thank
me: So this got me footing in the hou&s;e; and there
I heard, among&s;t her people, &s;he was coming to South|ampton,
and was to call for you, my dear mi&s;s; &s;o
when I found &s;he had not her coach full, I a&s;k'd her
to give me a ca&s;t; for I told her you'd be particular
glad to &s;ee me, as we'd &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle toge|ther,
that was a &s;ecret between only us two; &s;o &s;he
&s;aid &s;he would do any thing to give you plea&s;ure; &s;o
then I made free to a&s;k-her to give me a night's lod|ging&punc;
till I could find out &s;ome friend to be at; for I'd
a va&s;t mind to come to Southampton, as I could do
it &s;o rea&s;onable, for I like to go every where. And I
dare &s;ay, my dear mi&s;s, if you'll tell her 'twill oblige
you, &s;he'll make me the compliment to let me &s;tay all
the time, for I know nobody here; though I don't fear
making friends, go where I will. And you know,
my dear mi&s;s, you can do no le&s;s by me, con&s;idering
what I've done for you; for I've kept all the good
people quiet about your debts; and they &s;ay you may
<PB N="348" REF="149">
pay them when you will, as I told them you was &s;uch
a rich heire&s;s; which Mr Dub&s;ter let me into the
&s;ecret of, for he had had it from your brother.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now experienced the extreme&s;t repentance
and &s;hame, to find her&s;elf involved in any obligation
with a character &s;o forward, vulgar, and encroaching,
and to impo&s;e &s;uch a per&s;on, through the abu&s;e of her
name and influence, upon the time and patience of
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>The report &s;pread by Lionel &s;he immediately di&s;a|vowed,
and, producing her twenty pound bank note
begged Mrs. Mittin would have the goodne&s;s to get
it changed for her, and to di&s;charge her accounts
without delay.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed by this readine&s;s; and &s;truck by the view,
of the note, Mrs. Mittin imputed to mere re&s;erve the
denial of her expected wealth, but readily promi&s;ed to
get in the bills, and &s;ee her clear.</P>
<P>Camilla would now have been left alone; but Mrs
Mittin thought of nothing le&s;s than quitting her, and
&s;he knew not how to bid her depart. It was uncertain
when Mrs. Berlinton could return; to obviate, there|fore,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the fatigue of &s;uch conver&s;ation,
Camilla propo&s;ed walking</P>
<P>It was &s;till but two o'clock, and the weather was
delicious; every place that opened to any view, pre|&s;ented
&s;ome pro&s;pect that was alluring; Camilla, not|with&s;tanding
her anxiety, was caught, and at intervals,
at lea&s;t, forgot all within, from admiration of all
without.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin led immediately to the town, and Ca|milla
was &s;truck with its neatne&s;s, and &s;urpri&s;ed by
its populou&s;ne&s;s. Mrs. Mittin a&s;&s;ured her it was no|thing
to London, and only wi&s;hed &s;he could walk her
from Charing-cro&s;s to Temple bar, ju&s;t to &s;hew her
what it was to &s;ee a little of the world.</P>
<P>&startq;But now, my dear,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;the thing is to
find out what we've got to look at; &s;o don't let's go
on without knowing what we're about; however,
the&s;e &s;hops are all &s;o mon&s;trous &s;mart, 'twill be a
plea&s;ure to go into them, and a&s;k the good people
what there's to &s;ee in the town.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="150">
This pretext proved &s;o fertile to her of entertain|ment,
in the opportunity it afforded of taking a near
view of the various commodities expo&s;ed to &s;ale, that
while &s;he entered almo&s;t every &s;hop, with enquiries
of what was worth &s;eeing, &s;he attended to no an&s;wer
nor information, but having examined and admired
all the goods within fight or reach, walked off, to ob|tain,
by &s;imilar means, a &s;imilar privilege further on;
boa&s;ting to Camilla that, by this clever device they
might &s;ee all that was &s;marte&s;t, without the expence
of buying any thing.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible that this might &s;afely have been re|peated,
from one end of the town to the other, had
Mrs. Mittin been alone; and &s;he &s;eemed well di&s;po|&s;ed
to make the experiment; but Camilla, who ab&s;ent
and ab&s;orbed, accompanied without heeding her, was
of a figure and appearance not quite &s;o well adapted
for indulging with impunity &s;uch unbridled curio&s;ity.
The &s;hopkeepers, who according to their &s;everal ta&s;tes
or opinions, gave their directions to the churches, the
quays, the market-place, the antique gates, the
townhall, &amp;c. involuntarily looked at her as they an|&s;wered
the que&s;tioner, and not &s;atisfied with the &s;hort
view, followed to the door, to look again; this pre|&s;ently
produced an effect; that, for the whole length
of the High-&s;treet, was amply ridiculous; every one
perceiving that, what&s;oever had been his recommen|dation,
whether to the right, to the left, or &s;traight
forward, the two inquirers went no further than into
the next &s;hop, whence they regularly drew forth either
the ma&s;ter or the man to make another &s;tarer at their
&s;ingular proceeding.</P>
<P>Some &s;uppo&s;ed they were only &s;eeking to attract
notice; others thought they were deranged in mind;
and others, again, imagined they were &s;hoplifters, and
ha&s;tened back to their counters, to examine what was
mi$$ng of their goods.</P>
<P>Two men of the two la&s;t per&s;ua&s;ions communicated
to one another their opinions, each &s;u&s;taining his own
with a po&s;itivene&s;s that would have ended in a quar|rel,
had it not been accommodated by a wager. To
<PB N="350" REF="151">
&s;ettle this became now &s;o important, that bu&s;ine&s;s gave
way to &s;peculation, and the contending parties, accom|panied
by a young perfumer as arbitrator, leaving their
affairs in the hands of their wives, or their dome&s;tics,
i&s;&s;ued forth from their repo&s;itories, to pur&s;ue and watch
the curious travellers; laying bets by the way at al|mo&s;t
every &s;hop as they proceeded, till they reached
the quay, where the ladies made a full &s;tand, and their
followers opened a con&s;ulatation how be&s;t to decide
the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Firl, a &s;agacious old linen-draper, who con|cluded
them to be &s;hoplifters, declared he would keep
aloof, for he &s;hould detect them be&s;t when they lea&s;t
&s;u&s;pected they were ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Mr. Drim, a genteel and &s;imple haberda&s;her, who be|freved
their &s;en&s;es di&s;ordered, made a circuit to face and
examine them, frequently however, looking back to &s;ee
that no ab&s;conding trick was played him by his friends.
When he came up to them, the pen&s;ive and ab&s;orbed
look of Camilla &s;truck him as too particular to be
natural; and in Mrs. Mittin he immediately fancied
he perceived &s;omething wild, if not in&s;ane. In truth,
an opinion preconceived of her derangement might
ea&s;ily authori&s;e &s;trong &s;u&s;picions of confirmation, from
the contented volubility with which &s;he ince&s;&s;antly
ran on, without waiting for an&s;werers, or even li&s;teners;
and his ob&s;ervation had not taught him, that the
loquacious de&s;ire only to &s;peak. They exact time,
not attention.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, &s;oon ob&s;erving the curio&s;ity with which
he examined them, looked at him &s;o hard in return,
talking the whole time, in a quick low voice, to Camilla
upon his oddity, that, &s;truck with a direful panic, in the
per&s;ua&s;ion &s;he was marking him for &s;ome mi&s;chief, he
he turned &s;hort about to get back to his companions;
leaving Mrs. Mittin with preci&s;ely the &s;ame opinion
of him&s;elf which he had imbibed of her.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;this is one of the
mo&s;t miraculous-adventures I've met with yet; as &s;ure
as you're alive that man that &s;tares &s;o is not right in the
head! for el&s;e what &s;hould he run away for, all in &s;uch
<PB N="351" REF="152">
a hurry, after looking at us &s;o particular for nothing?
I'll a&s;&s;ure you, I think the be&s;t thing we can do, is to
get off as fa&s;t as we can, for fear of the wor&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>They then &s;pread their way from the quay; but, in
turning down the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age to get out of &s;ight, they
were led into one of the little rooms prepared for the
accommodation of bathers.</P>
<P>This &s;eemed &s;o &s;ecure, as well as plea&s;ant, that Ca|milla,
&s;oothed by the tranquillity with which &s;he could
contemplate the noble Southampton water and its fine
bank$, &s;at down at the window, and de&s;ired not to
walk any further.</P>
<P>The fright with which Mr. Drim had retreated,
gained no pro&s;elyte to his opinion; Mr. Girt, the
perfumer, a&s;&s;erted, &s;ignificantly, they were only idle
travellers, of light character; and Mr. Firl, when in
dodging them, he &s;aw they went into a bathing toom,
offered to double his wager that it was to make &s;ome
a&s;&s;ortment of their &s;poil.</P>
<P>This was accepted, and it was agreed that one
&s;hould &s;aunter in the adjoining pa&s;&s;ages to &s;ee which
way they turned upon coming out, while the two
others &s;hould patrole the beach, to watch their di&s;|appearance
from the windows.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, meanwhile, was as much amu&s;ed,
though with different objects, as Camilla. A large
mixt party of ladies and gentlemen, who had ordered
a ve&s;&s;el for &s;ailing down the water, which was not
yet ready, now made their appearance; and their
dre&s;s, their air of enjoyment, their outcries of im|patience,
the fri&s;ky gaiety of &s;ome, the noi&s;y merriment
of others, &s;eemed to Mrs. Mittin marks of &s;o much
grandeur and happine&s;s, that all her thoughts were at
work to devi&s;e &s;ome contrivance for becoming of their
acquaintance.</P>
<P>Camilla al&s;o &s;urveyed, but almo&s;t without &s;eeing
them; for the only image of her mind now unex|pectedly
met her view; Dr. Marchmont and Edgar,
ju&s;t arrived, had patrolled to the beach, where Edgar,
who&s;e eye, from his eagerne&s;s, appeared to be every
where in a moment, immediately perceived her; they
<PB N="352" REF="153">
both bowed, and Dr. Marchmont, amazed by the
air and figure of her companion, inquired if Mrs.
Berlinton had any particularly vulgar relation to whom
&s;he was likely to commit her fair gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had &s;een only her&s;elf, could not now
forbear another glance; but the a&s;pect of Mrs. Mittin,
without Mrs. Berlinton, or any other more dignified
or fitting protectre&s;s, was both unaccountable and
unplea&s;ant to him; he recollected having &s;een her at
Tunbridge, where the carele&s;s temper, and negligent
manners of Mrs. Arlbery, made all approaches ea&s;y,
that an&s;wered any purpo&s;e of amu&s;ement or ridicule;
but he could not conceive how Mrs. Berlinton, or
Camilla her&s;elf, could be joined by &s;uch a companion.</P>
<P>Mr. Firl, having remarked the&s;e two gentlemen's
bows, began to fear for his wager; yet thinking it
authori&s;ed him to &s;eek &s;ome information, approached
them, and taking off his hat, &s;aid: &startq;You &s;eem to be
noticing tho&s;e two ladies up&punc; there; pay, gentlemen,
if you've no objection, who may they be?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why do you a&s;k, Sir?&endq; cried Edgar, &s;ternly.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, we've a wager depending upon them, &s;ir,
and I believe there's no gentleman will refu&s;e to help
another about a wager.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A wager?&endq; repeated Edgar, wi&s;hing, but vainly,
to manife&s;t no curio&s;ity; &startq;what inducement could
you have to lay a wager about them?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, I believe, &s;ir, there's nobody's a better judge
than me what I've laid about; though I may be out,
to be &s;ure, if you know the ladies; but I've &s;een
&s;o much of their tricks, in my time, that they mu&s;t be
pretty &s;harp before they'll over-reach me&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What tricks? who mu&s;t be &s;harp?
who are you taking of?</P>
<P>&startq;Shoplifters, &s;ir.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Shoplifters! what do you mean?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No harm, &s;ir; I may be out, to be &s;ure, as I &s;ay;
and if &s;o, I a&s;k pardon; only, as we've laid the wager,
I think I may &s;peak before I pay.&endq;</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity of Edgar would have been con|verted
into ridicule, had he been le&s;s unea&s;y
<PB N="353" REF="154">
at &s;eeing with whom Camilla was thus a&s;&s;oci|ated;
Mrs. Mittin might certainly be a worthy wo|man,
and, if &s;o, mu&s;t merit every kindne&s;s that could
be &s;hewn her; but her air and manner &s;o &s;trongly di&s;|played
the low bred &s;ociety to which &s;he had been
accu&s;tomed, that he fore&s;aw nothing but improper
acquaintance, or demeaning adventures, that could
en&s;ue from &s;uch a connection at a public pl$ce.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont demanded what had given ri&s;e to
this &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Mr. Firl an&s;wered, that they had been into every
&s;hop in the town, routing over every body's b$&s;t good$,
yet not laying out a penny.</P>
<P>Nothing of this could Edgar comprehend, except
that Camilla had &s;uffered her&s;elf to be led about by
Mrs. Mittin, entirely at her plea&s;ure; but all further
inquiry was &s;topt, by the voluntary and pert junction
of Girt, the young perfumer, who, during this period,
had by no means been idle; for perceiving, in the
group wai$ing for a ve&s;&s;el, a certain cu&s;tomer b$ whom
he knew &s;uch a &s;ubject would be well received, he
contrived to excite his curio&s;ity to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions,
which could only be &s;atisfied by the hi&s;tory of the
wager, and his own opinion that both parties were out.</P>
<P>This drew all eyes to the bathing room; and new
bets &s;oon were circulated, con&s;i&s;ting of every de&s;crip|tion
of conjecture, or even po&s;&s;ibility, except that the
two objects in que&s;tion were innocent: and for that,
in a &s;et of fourteen, one only was found who defend|ed
Camilla, though her face &s;eemed the very index
of purity, which &s;till more &s;trongly was painted upon
it than beauty, or even than youth. Such is the pre|valent
di&s;po&s;ition to believe in general depravity, that
while tho&s;e who are deba&s;ed them&s;elves find a con&s;o|lation
in thinking others-equally worthle&s;s, tho&s;e even
who are of a better &s;ort, nouri&s;h a &s;ecret vanity in &s;up|po&s;ing
few as good as them&s;elves; and $ully, without
reflection, the fair candour of their minds, by aiding
that infiduous degeneracy, which robs the community
of all confidence in virtue.</P>
<P>The approach of the perfumer to Edgar had all the
hardine&s;s of vulgar elation, be&s;towed, at this moment.
<PB N="354" REF="155">
by the recent encouragement of having been permitted
to propagate his facetious opinions in a &s;ociety of gen|tlefolks;
for though to one only among&s;t them, a
young man of large fortune, by whom he was parti|cularly
patronifed, he had pre&s;umed verbally to ad|dre&s;s
him&s;elf, he had yet the plea&s;ure to hear his ac|count
repeated from one to another, till not a per&s;on
of the company e&s;caped hearing it.</P>
<P>&startq;My friend Firl's been telling you, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ir,&endq;
&s;aid he, to Edgar, &startq;of his fooli&s;h wager? but, take
my word for it&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Here Edgar, who again had irre&s;i&s;tibly looked up
at the room, &s;aw that three gentlemen had entered it;
alarmed le&s;t the&s;e &s;urmi&s;es &s;hould be productive of im|pertinence
to Camilla, he darted quick from the beach
to her immediate protection.</P>
<P>But the rapidity of his wi&s;hes were ill &s;econded by
the uncertainty of his foot&s;teps; and while, with eyes
eagerly wandering all around, he ha&s;tily pu&s;hed for|ward,
he was &s;topt by Mr. Drim, who told him to take
care how he went on, for, in one of tho&s;e bathing hou|&s;es,
to the be&s;t of his belief, there were two crazy
women, one melancholy, and one &s;tark wild, that had
ju&s;t, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, e&s;caped from their keepers.</P>
<P>&startq;How &s;hall I find my way, then, to another of the
bathing hou&s;es?&endq; cried Edgar.</P>
<P>Mr. Drim undertook to &s;hew him where he might
turn, but &s;aid he mu&s;t not lo&s;e &s;ight of the door, be|cau&s;e
he had a bottle of port depending upon it; his
neighbour, Mr. Firl, in&s;i&s;ting they were only &s;hop|lifters.</P>
<P>Edgar here &s;topt &s;hort and &s;tared.</P>
<P>Drim then a&s;&s;ured him it was what he could not be|lieve,
as nothing was mi&s;&s;ing; though Mr. Firl would
have it that it was days and days, &s;ometimes, before
people fou$d out what was gone; but he was &s;ure,
him&s;elf, they were touched in the head, by their going
about &s;o wild, a&s;king every body the &s;ame que&s;tions,
and minding nobody's an&s;wers.</P>
<P>Edgar, convinced now Camilla was here again
implicated, broke with di&s;gu&s;t from the man, and
ru&s;hed to the door he charged him to avoid.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Rage of Obliging.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA, from the in&s;tant &s;he had perceived Ed|gar,
had been in the utmo&s;t emotion, from doubt if his
journey were to &s;eek a reconciliation, or only to return
her letters, and take a la&s;ting farewel. Her fir&s;t feeling
at his &s;ight urged her to retire: but &s;omething of a
&s;ofter nature &s;peedily interfered, repre&s;enting, if now
he &s;hould join her, what &s;uffering might mutually be
&s;aved by an immediate conference. She kept, there|fore
her &s;eat, looking &s;teadily &s;traight down the wa|ter,
and denying her&s;elf one moment's glance at any
thing, or per&s;on, upon the beach: little imagining &s;he
ingro&s;&s;ed, her&s;elf, the attention of all who paraded
it. But, when the in&s;inuations of the flippant perfu|mer
had once made her looked at, her beauty, her ap|parently
unprotected &s;ituation, and the account of the
wager, &s;eemed to render her an object to be &s;tared at
without &s;cruple.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin &s;aw how much they were ob&s;erved, but
Camilla, unheeding her remarks, li&s;tened only to hear
if any foot&s;teps approached; but when, at la&s;t, &s;ome
&s;truck her ears, they were accompanied by an unknown
voice, &s;o loud and clamorou&s;ly jovial, that, di&s;turbed,
&s;he looked round&mdash;and &s;aw the door violently flung
open, and three per&s;ons, dre&s;&s;ed like gentlemen, force
their way into the &s;mall dwelling place.</P>
<P>Mr. Halder, the leader of this trium virate, was the
particular patron of Girt, the young perfumer; and,
though his &s;uperior in birth and riches, was &s;carcely
upon a par with him, from wilful neglect in educati|on;
and undoubtedly beneath him in decency and con|duct,
notwith&s;tanding young Girt piqued him&s;elf far
le&s;s upon &s;uch &s;entimental qualifications, than upon
<PB N="356" REF="157">
his &s;kill in co&s;$etics, and had le&s;s re&s;pect for unadui|terated
morals, than unaduiterated powder.</P>
<P>The &s;econd who entered, was, in every particular,
&s;till le&s;s defen&s;ible&punc; he was a peer of the rea$m; he
had a daughter married, and his age entitled him to be
the grandfather of young Halder. In point of fortune,
&s;peculati&s;ts deemed them equal; for though the e&s;tate
of Halder was as yet unincumbered with the mortga|ges
that hung upon that of Lord Valhur&s;t, they com|puted,
with great exactne&s;s, the term of its &s;uperiori|ty,
&s;ince already he had inli&s;ted in the jockey$meetings,
and belonged to the gaming clubs.</P>
<P>The third, a young man of a &s;erious, but plea&s;ing
demeanour, was rather an attendant than a partner in
this intru&s;ion. He was the only one of the whole party
to whom the countenance of Camilla had announced i$|nocence;
and when Halder, in&s;tigated by the a&s;&s;erti|ons
of the facetious Girt, propo&s;ed the pre&s;ent mea|&s;ure,
and Lord Valhur&s;t, caught by the youthful beau|ty
of the fair &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion&punc; acceded, this &s;ingle
champion &s;tood forth, and mode&s;tly, yet firmly, de|claring
his opinion they were mi&s;taken, accompanied
them with a view to protect her if he him&s;elf were
right.</P>
<P>Boi&s;terou&s;ly entering, Halder addre&s;&s;ed at once to
Camilla, &s;uch unceremonious prai&s;e of her beauty,
that, affrighted and offended, &s;he ha&s;t$ly &s;eized the arm
of Mrs. Mittin, and, in a voice of alarm, though with
an air of command that admitted no doubt of her &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s,
and no appeal from her re&s;olution, &s;aid,
&startq;Let us go home, Mrs. Mittin, immediately.&endq;</P>
<P>Simple as were the&s;e words, their manner had an
effect upon Halder to awe and di&s;tance him. Beauty,
in the garb of virtue, is rather formidable than attrac|tive
to tho&s;e who are natively unenlightened, as well
as habitually degenerate: though, over &s;uch as have
ever known better &s;entiments, it frequently retains its
primeval power, even in their darke&s;t decle$&s;ion of de|pravity.</P>
<P>But while Halder, repul&s;ed, &s;tood back, and the
young champion, with an air the mo&s;t re&s;pectful, made
<PB N="357" REF="158">
way for her to pa&s;s;&punc; Lord Valhur&s;t, &s;hutting the door,
planted him&s;elf again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Seeing terror now take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every feature of
her face, her determined protector called out: &startq;Make
way, my Lord, I beg!&endq; and offered her his hand. But
Camilla, equally frightened at them all, &s;hrunk appal|led
from his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and turned towards the win|dow,
with an intention of demanding help from Edgar,
whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;till on the beach; but the peer&punc;
&s;lowly moving from the door, &s;aid he was the la&s;t to
mean to di&s;concert the young lady, and only wi&s;hed
to &s;top her till he could call for his carriage, that he
might &s;ee her &s;afe wherever &s;he wi&s;hed to go.</P>
<P>Camilla had no doubt of the &s;incerity of this propo|&s;al,
but would accept no aid from a &s;tranger, even
though an old man, while &s;he hoped to obtain that
of Edgar. Edgar, however &s;he &s;aw not, and fear is,
generally precipitate: $he concluded him gone; conclu|ded
her&s;elf de&s;erted, and, from knowing neither, equally
fearing both the young men, inclined towards Lord Val|hur&s;t;
who, with delighted &s;urpri&s;e, was going to take
her under his care when Edgar ru&s;hed forward.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure that darted into her eyes announced
his welcome. Halder, from his reception, thought
the enigma of his own ill &s;ucce&s;s &s;olved; the other
youth, &s;uppo&s;ing him her brother, no longer &s;ought to
interfere; but Lord Valhur&s;t exhibited &s;igns of &s;uch
irrepre&s;&s;ible mortification, that inexperience it&s;elf could
not mi&s;take the di&s;honourable views of his offered &s;er|vices,
&s;ince, to &s;ee her in &s;afety, was &s;o evidently not
their purpo&s;e. Camilla, looking at him with the hor|ror
he &s;o ju&s;tly excited, gave her hand to Edgar, who
had in&s;tantly claimed it, and, without one word being
uttered by either, ha&s;tily walked away with him, nimbly
accompanied by Mrs. Mittin.</P>
<P>The young man, who&s;e own mind was &s;ufficiently
pure to make him give ea&s;y credit to the purity of a|nother,
was &s;hocked at his unde&s;erved implication in
&s;o gro&s;s an attack, and at his failure of manife&s;ting
the laudable motive which had made him one of the
triumvirate; and, looking after her with mingled ad|miration
<PB N="358" REF="159">
and concern, &startq;Indeed, gentlemen,&endq; he cri|ed,
&startq;You have been much to blame. You have
affronted a young lady who carries in the whole
of her appearance the marks of meriting re&s;pect.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ibility of Lord Valhur&s;t was not of &s;uffici|ent
magnitude to &s;eparate into two cour&s;es: the
little he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was alreadey occupied by his di&s;ap|pointment,
in lo&s;ing the beautiful prey he believed ju&s;t
falling into his hands, and he had no emotion, there|fore,
to be&s;tow upon his young reprover. But Hal|der,
who, to want of feeling, added want of &s;en&s;e,
roared out, with rude raillery, a gro&s;s, which he
thought witty, attack both of the defender and
the defended.</P>
<P>The young man, with the proud probity of un|hackneyed
&s;entiment, made a vindication of his un|corrupt
intentions; which produced but louder mirth,
and coar&s;er incredulity. The conte&s;t, however, was
wholly unequal; one had nerves of the mo&s;t irritable
delicacy; the other had never yet, by any &s;en&s;ation,
nor any accident, been admoni&s;hed that nerves made
any part of the human compo&s;ition: in proportion,
therefore, as one became more offended, the other
grew more callous, till the chivalry of indignant
honour, ca&s;ting prudence, &s;afety, and forbearance
away, dictated a ha&s;ty challenge, which was accept|ed
with a hor&s;e laugh of brutal &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;ne&s;s of dan|ger.
Courage is of another de&s;cription. It ri&s;ks life
with heroi&s;m; but it is only to pre&s;erve or pur&s;ue
&s;omething, without which the charm of life were di&s;|&s;olved:
it meets death with &s;teadine&s;s; but it prepares
for immortality with reverence and emotion.</P>
<P>Edgar and Camilla continued their walk in a &s;ilence
painful to both, but which neither knew how fir&s;t to
break; each wi&s;hed with earne&s;tne&s;s an opening to
communication and confidence but, mutually &s;hock|ed
by the recent adventure, Edgar waited the ab|&s;ence
of Mrs. Mittin, to point out the impropriety
<PB N="359" REF="160">
and in&s;ufficiency of &s;uch a guard; and Camilla, &s;till
agha&s;t with terror, had no power of any &s;ort to begin
a di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Their taciturnity, if not well &s;upplied, was, at
lea&s;t, well contra&s;ted by the volubility of Mrs. Mittin,
which, as in the bathing hou&s;e it had been ince&s;&s;ant,
in declaring, to the three intruders, that both &s;he and
the other young lady were per&s;ons of honour, was now
no le&s;s unremitting in boa&s;ting how well &s;he had
checked and kept them in order.</P>
<P>The horror of the attack &s;he had ju&s;t e&s;caped be|came
&s;oon but a &s;econdary &s;uffering to Camilla, though,
at the moment, it had impre&s;&s;ed her more terribly than
any actual event of her life, or any &s;cene her creative
imagination had ever painted; yet, however dreadful, it
was now pa&s;t; but who could tell the end of what re|mained?
the mute di&s;tance of Edgar, her uncertainty
of his intentions, her &s;u&s;picions of his wi&s;hed &s;ece&s;|&s;ion,
the &s;evere task &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary to perform
of giving him his liberty, with the angui&s;h of a total
inability to judge whether &s;uch a &s;tep would recall his
tenderne&s;s, or precipitate his retreat, were &s;ugge&s;tions
which quick &s;ucceeded, and, in a very &s;hort time,
wholly domineered over every other.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the hou&s;e, Edgar demanded
if he might hope for the honour of being pre&s;ented, as
a friend of the family, to Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>Reviving, though embarra&s;&s;ed, &s;he looked a&s;&s;ent,
and went forward to inquire if Mrs. Berlinton were
come home.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant an&s;wered no; but delivered her a let|ter
from that lady; &s;he took it with a look of di&s;tre&s;s
whether or not to invite Edgar to enter, which the&punc;
at this period, welcome officiou&s;ne&s;s of Mrs. Mittin
relieved, by &s;aying, &startq;Come, let us all come in, and
make the parlour a little comfortable again&s;t Mrs.
Berlington comes home; for, I dare &s;ay, there's no|thing
as it &s;hould be. The&s;e lodging-hou&s;es always
want a heap of things one never thinks of before,
hand.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="161">
They then all three entered, and Mrs. Mittin, who &s;aw
&s;he &s;aid, a thou&s;and ways by which &s;he might &s;erve
and oblige Mrs. Berlinton, by various &s;ugge&s;tions, and
even directions, which &s;he hazarded again&s;t her re|turn,
bu&s;ied her&s;elf to arrange the two parlours to her
&s;atisfaction; and then, went up &s;tairs, to &s;ettle, al&s;o,
all there; making abundant apologies for leaving
them, and a&s;&s;uring them &s;he would be back again as
&s;oon as &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could get all in order.</P>
<P>Her departure was a moment of extreme confu&s;ion
to Camilla, who con&s;idered it as an invitation to her
great &s;cheme of rejection, but who &s;tammered &s;ome|thing
upon every other &s;ubject, to keep that off.
She-looked at her letter, wondered what it could con|tain,
could not imagine why Mrs. Berlinton &s;hould
write when they mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon&punc; meet; and &s;pent in
conjectures upon its contents the time which
Edgar be&s;ought her to be&s;tow upon their peru|&s;al.</P>
<P>Nothing gives &s;o much &s;trength to an adver&s;a|ry
as the view of timidity in his opponent. Edgar
grew pre&s;ently compo&s;ed, and felt equal to his pur|po&s;ed
expo&s;tulation.</P>
<P>&startq;You decline reading your letter till I am gone?
&startq;I mu&s;t therefore, ha&s;ten away. Yet, before I go,
I earne&s;tly wi&s;h once more to take upon me the
office formerly allowed me, and to repre&s;ent, with
&s;imple &s;incerity, my apprehen&s;ions upon what I have
ob&s;erved this morning.&endq;</P>
<P>The beginning of this &s;peech had made Camilla
break the &s;eal of her letter; but its conclu&s;ion agita|ted
her too much for reading it.</P>
<P>&startq;Is this &s;ilence,&endq; &s;aid he, trying to &s;mile, &startq;to re|pre&s;s
me as arrogant,&mdash;or to di&s;regard me as imperti|nent?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Neither!&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, forcing her&s;elf to
look towards him with cheerfulne&s;s, it is merely&mdash;
&startq;attention.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are very good, and I will try to be brief,
that I may put your patience to no longer proof than
I can avoid. You know, already, all I can urge con|cerning
<PB N="361" REF="162">
Mrs. Berlinton; how little I wonder at the
promptne&s;s of your admiration; yet how greatly I
fear for the permanence of your e&s;teem. In putting
your&s;elf under her immediate and &s;ole protection, you
have &s;hewn me the complete di&s;&s;onance of our judg|ments
upon this &s;ubject; but I do not forget that,
though you had the goodne&s;s to hear me, you had
the right to decide for your&s;elf. Tru&s;t, indeed, even
again&s;t warning, is &s;o far more amiable than &s;u&s;pici|on,
that it mu&s;t always, even though it prove unfor|tunate,
call for prai&s;e rather than cen&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of Camilla was now converted into
&s;elf-reproach. What &s;he-thought coldne&s;s, &s;he had
re&s;ented, what appeared to be haughtine&s;s, &s;he had
re&s;i&s;ted; but truth in the form of gentlene&s;s, brought
her in&s;tantly to rea&s;on, and rea&s;on could only re&s;ume
its empire, to repre&s;ent as ra&s;h and imprudent an ex|pedition
&s;o repugnant, in its circum&s;tances, to the wi&s;h|es
and opinions of the per&s;on who&s;e approbation was
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to her happine&s;s. Edgar had pau&s;ed,
and her every impul&s;e led to a candid recognition of
what &s;he felt to be wrong; but her precarious &s;itua|tion
with him, the report of his intended flight by
Jacob, the letters &s;till detained of Sir Sedley Clarendel,
and no explanation demanded, by which &s;he could
gather if his plighted honour were not now his only
$ie with her, curbed her de&s;ign, depre&s;&s;ed her courage,
and, &s;ilently, &s;he let him proceed.</P>
<P>&startq;Upon this &s;ubject, therefore, I mu&s;t &s;ay no more,
except to hint a wi&s;h, that the apprehen&s;ions which
fir&s;t induced me to name it may, unbidden, occur as
timely heralds to exertion, &s;hould any untoward cir$cum&s;tances
point to danger, alarm, or impropriety.&endq;</P>
<P>The new, but &s;trong friend&s;hip of Camilla was
alarmed for its delicacy by the&s;e words. The diffidence
&s;he felt, from con&s;cious error, for her&s;elf, extended
not to Mrs. Berlinton, whom, &s;ince &s;he found guiltle&s;s,
&s;he believed to be blamele&s;s. She broke forth, there|fore,
into a warm eulogy, which her agitation rendered
eloquent, while her own mind and &s;pirits were re|lieved
<PB N="362" REF="163">
and revived, by this flight from her mortified
&s;elf, to the friend &s;he thought de&s;erving her mo&s;t fer|vent
ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Edgar li&s;tened attentively, and his eyes, though
they expre&s;&s;ed much of &s;erious concern, &s;hewed al&s;o
an irrepre&s;&s;ible admiration of an enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;o ardent
for a female friend of &s;o much beauty.</P>
<P>&startq;May &s;he always merit this generous warmth!&endq;
cried he; &startq;which mu&s;t have excited my be&s;t wi&s;hes
for her welfare, even if I had been in&s;en&s;ible to her
own claims upon every man of feeling. But I had
meant, at this time, to confine my ungrateful annota|tions
to another&mdash;to the per&s;on who had ju&s;t quitted
the room.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You do not mean to name her with Mrs. Berlin|ton?
to imagine it po&s;&s;ible I can have for her any &s;i|milar
regard? or any, indeed, at all, but &s;uch com|mon
goodwill as all &s;orts and cla&s;&s;es of people are en|titled
to, who are well meaning?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Here, at lea&s;t, then,&endq; &s;aid Edgar, with a &s;igh
half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, &startq;our opinions may be con&s;onant.
No; I de&s;igned no &s;uch di&s;graceful parallel for your
elegant favourite. My whole intention is to remon|&s;trate&mdash;
can you pardon &s;o plain a word?&mdash;again&s;t your
appearing in public with a per&s;on &s;o ill adapted to in|&s;ure
you the re&s;pect that is &s;o every way your due.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I had not the &s;malle&s;t idea, believe me of ap|pearing
in public. I merely walked out to &s;ee the
town, and to beguile, in a &s;troll, time, which in this
per&s;on's &s;ociety, hu$g heavy upon me at home, in the
ab&s;ence of Mrs. Berlinton.&endq;</P>
<P>The conci&s;e &s;implicity of this innocent account,
bani&s;hed, in a moment, all &s;everity of judgment; and
Edgar, expre&s;&s;ively thanking her, ro&s;e, and was ap|proaching,
her, though &s;carcely knowing with what
purpo&s;e, when Mrs. Mittin bur&s;t into the room, ex|claiming:
&startq;Well, my dear, you'll never gue&s;s how
many things I have done &s;ince I left you. In the
fir&s;t place, there was never a wa&s;h-ball; in the next
place, not a$ $napkin nor a towel was in its proper
place; then the $word$ things were forgot; and as to
<PB N="363" REF="164">
&s;poons, not one could I find. And now I've a mind
to go my&s;elf to a &s;hop I took good notice of, and
get her a little almond powder for her nice white
hands; which, I dare &s;ay, will plea&s;e her. I've
thought of a hundred things at lea&s;t. I dare &s;ay I
&s;hall quite win her heart. And I'm &s;ure of my money
again, if I lay out never &s;o much. And I don't know
what I would not do for &s;uch a good lady.&endq;</P>
<P>During this harangue, Camilla, a&s;hamed of her
want of re&s;olution, &s;ecretly vowed, that, if again left
alone with him, &s;he would not lo&s;e a moment in re|&s;toring
him his liberty, that with dignity &s;he might
once more receive, or with fortitude for ever re&s;ign it.
She thought her&s;elf, at this moment, capable of either;
but &s;he had only thought it, &s;ince his &s;oftened look
and an had made her believe &s;he had nothing to fear
from the alternative.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin &s;oon went, though her continued and
unmeaning chattery made the &s;hort term of her &s;tay
appear long.</P>
<P>Each eager upon their own plan, both then in|voluntarily
aro&s;e.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;poke fir&s;t. &startq;I have &s;omething,&endq; &s;he cri|ed,
&startq;to &s;ay,&endq; but her voice became &s;o hu&s;ky, the
inarticulate &s;ounds died away unheard, and blu&s;hing
at &s;o feeble an opening, &s;he &s;trove, under the au&s;pices
of a cough, to di&s;gui&s;e that &s;he had &s;poken at all, for
the purpo&s;e of beginning, in a more &s;triking manner,
again.</P>
<P>This &s;ucceeded with Edgar at this moment, for
he had heard her voice, not her words: he began,
therefore, him&s;elf. &startq;This good lady,&endq; he &s;aid,
&startq;&s;eems bit with the rage of obliging, though not, I
think, &s;o heroically, as much to injure her intere&s;t.
But &s;urely &s;he flatters her&s;elf with &s;omewhat too high
a recompence? The heart of Mrs. Berlinton is not,
I fancy, framed for &s;uch a conqueror. But how, at
the &s;ame time, is it po&s;&s;ible conver&s;ation &s;uch as this
&s;hould be heard under her roof? And how can it
have come to pa&s;s that &s;uch a per&s;on&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Talk of her,&endq; interrupted Camilla, recovering
<PB N="364" REF="165">
her breath, &startq;&s;ome other time. Let me now inquire
&mdash;have you burnt&mdash;I hope &s;o!&mdash;tho&s;e fooli&s;h letters
&mdash;I put into your hands?&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The countenance of Edgar was in&s;tantly overcloud|ed.
The mention of tho&s;e letters brought fre&s;h to his
heart the bittere&s;t, the mo&s;t excruciating and intol$|rable
pang it had ever experien$ed; it brought Camil|la
to his view no longer artle&s;s, pure, and &s;ingle-mind|ed,
but engaged to, or trifling with, one man, while
&s;eriou&s;ly accepting another. &startq;No, madam,&endq; he &s;o|lemnly
&s;aid, &startq;I have not pre&s;umed &s;o far. Their
an&s;wers are not likely to meet with &s;o violent a death,
and it &s;eemed to me that one part of the corre&s;pond|ence
&s;hould be pre&s;erved for the elucidation of the
other.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla felt &s;tung by this reply, and tremulou&s;ly an|&s;wered,
&startq;Give me them back, then, if you plea&s;e,
and I will take care to &s;ee them all demoli&s;hed toge|ther,
in the &s;ame flames. Meanwhile&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are you &s;ure,&endq; interrupted Edgar, &startq;&s;uch a con|flagration
will be permitted? Does the man live who
would have the philo&s;ophy&mdash;the in&s;en&s;ibility I mu&s;t
rather &s;tyle it&mdash;ever to re&s;ign, after once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing,
marks &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing of e&s;teem? O, Camilla! I,
at lea&s;t, could not be that man!&endq;</P>
<P>Cut to the &s;oul by this que&s;tion, which, though
&s;oftened by the la&s;t phra&s;$, &s;he deemed &s;everely cru|el,
&s;he ha&s;tily exclaimed: &startq;Philo&s;ophy I have no
right to &s;peak of&mdash;but as to in&s;en&s;ibility&mdash;who is the
man that ever more can &s;urpri&s;e me by its di&s;play?
Let me take, however, this opportunity&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>A footman opening the door, &s;aid, his lady had
&s;ent to beg an an&s;wer to her letter.</P>
<P>Camilla, in whom anger was momentary, but the
love of ju&s;tice permanent, rejoiced at an interruption
which prevented her from &s;peaking, with pique and
di&s;plea&s;ure, a &s;entence that mu&s;t lo&s;e all its purpo&s;e
if not uttered with mildne&s;s. She would write,
&s;he &s;aid immediately; and, bidding the man get her
pen and ink, went to the window to read her letter;
with a formal bow of apology to Edgar as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
him.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="166">
&startq;I have made you angry?&endq; cried he, when the
man was gone; &startq;and I hate my&s;elf to have cau&s;ed
you a moment's pain: But you mu&s;t feel for me, Ca|milla,
in the wound you have inflicted! you know not
the di&s;order of mind produced by a &s;udden, unlooked
for tran&s;ition from felicity to perplexity,&mdash;from &s;ereni|ty
to mi&s;ery!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla felt touched, yet continued reading, or
rather rapidly repeating to her&s;elf the words of her
letter, without comprehending, or even &s;eeking to
comprehend, the meaning of one &s;entence.</P>
<P>He found him&s;elf quite unequal to enduring her
di&s;plea&s;ure; his own, all his cautions, all Dr. March|mont's
advice, were forgotten; and tenderly following
her, &startq;Have I offended,&endq; he cried, &startq;pa&s;t forgivene&s;s?
Is Camilla immoveable? and is the journey from which
I fondly hoped to date the renewal of every hope, the
termination of every doubt, the period of all &s;uffering
and &s;orrow&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topt abruptly, from the entrance of the &s;ervant
with pen and ink, and the interruption was critical:
it called him to his &s;elf-command: he &s;tammered out
that he would not impede her writing; and, though
in palpable confu&s;ion, took his leave: yet, at the
&s;treet-door, he gave a ticket with his name, to the
&s;ervant who attended him, for Mrs. Berlington: and,
with his be&s;t re&s;pects, de&s;ired &s;he might be told he
&s;hould do him&s;elf the honour to endeavour to &s;ee her
in the evening.</P>
<P>The recollection of Edgar came too late to his aid
to an&s;wer its intended purpo&s;e. The tender avowal
which had e&s;caped him to Camilla, of the view
of his journey, had fir&s;t with a&s;toni&s;hment &s;truck her
ear, and next with quick enchantment vibrated to her
heart, which again it &s;peedily taught to beat with its
pri&s;tine vivacity; and joy, &s;pirit, and confidence ex|pelled
in a breath all gue&s;ts but them&s;elves.</P>
