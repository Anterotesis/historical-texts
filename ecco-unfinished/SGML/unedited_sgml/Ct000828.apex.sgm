<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT's pity our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pulpits were not fill'd up with <HI>Dr. Kennet</HI>'s, I mean, Sir, &s;uch as are of your heal|ing Temper, Men of moderate Principles, that have a Sen&s;e of the Wounds the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t</HI> has re|ceived, from the Divi&s;ions of her Members: Heats and Animo&s;ities are de&s;tructive to any Community; but in the Church Fatal; for it de&s;troys the very Nerves and Sinews of <HI>Religion;</HI> and when the Life and Power is once gone, there remains only a Name: It must needs be a me|lancholy Thought to a &s;erious <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> That the <HI>Church</HI> (of which he is a Member, and it may be a <HI>Pa&s;tor)</HI> has but only a Lifele&s;s Name; &s;eem to be Alive, and yet Dead.</P>
<P>Though there is none (now adays) can po&s;itively deter|mine in this Matter; yet we may &s;afely conclude, That tho&s;e that do all they can to rend and tear, to wound and de&s;troy the Spou&s;e of Christ, are Strangers to the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s.</HI> There are many among us, that are con|tented to eat their own Bread, and wear their own Appa|rel, if they &s;hall but hang upon, and hide them&s;elves un|der the Skirts of our <HI>E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church,</HI> that their Re|proach (of being of no Church at all) may be taken away.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
The Churh in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s</HI> had a mixt Multitude among them, who had the Relicks of an <HI>Idolatrous Wor|&s;hip,</HI> and had (doubtle&s;s) a great Hand in the Invention of the <HI>Golden-Calf,</HI> and the many and often Rebellions of that Church; for which, the Judgments of God did follow them &s;o clo&s;e, till he had utterly de&s;troyed them from the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>No doubt, but our <HI>Engli&s;h I&s;rael</HI> has cau&s;e to complain of &s;uch a mixt Multitude, that to this Day, are not fully drain'd from the Remains of <HI>Popery;</HI> I wi&s;h our fatal End may not be to Drink of the &s;ame <HI>Cup</HI> as they did; for &s;uffering them to hang upon the Skirts of their <HI>Pretended Mother,</HI> while they take the readie&s;t Cour&s;e, to undermine her Foundation, by wrangling Contentions and Jars, by Sow|ing the Seeds of Sedition, which is the proper Work of the <HI>De&s;troyer.</HI> And al&s;o the Author of the&s;e <HI>Remarks</HI> has the Confidence to &s;ay, That <HI>Church-men</HI> Condemn you, <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> De&s;pi&s;e you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet you may be Confident of ju&s;t the Contrary; and that God Him&s;elf has pronounc'd you Ble&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e a <HI>Peace-maker.</HI> I am not &s;o vain, as to think, That this Defence can any ways corroborate your well-compo&s;ed <HI>Sermon;</HI> but that the World may &s;ee, that Men of moderate Principles are not quite Extingui&s;h'd: Go on, Sir, and <HI>follow Peace with all Men,</HI> and the God of Peace will give you a full Reward. I am,</P>

<P>'TIS Unaccountable, and truly La|mentable, That we the Inhabi|tants of this <HI>Fair I&s;land</HI> (the Prime of the Univer&s;e all things con&s;ider'd) &s;hould yet be &s;o fatally Unfortunate, as to undervalue the Ble&s;&s;ings that Heaven has plentifully be&s;towed upon us; We who live in a delicate Climate, and in a Land that affords us all kind of Varieties as Nature can wi&s;h for: Who are Regulated by the be&s;t Con&s;tituted Government in the habitable World; and have a Queen who is fitly adap|ted, both by Her Inclination and Promi&s;e, to Govern us, according to our Con&s;titution; and above all, who are ble&s;&s;ed (in a pecu|liar and di&s;tingui&s;hing way and manner) with the Go&s;pel of Peace, <HI>which is able to make us Wi&s;e unto Salvation,</HI> &s;hould yet be &s;o aver&s;e to our own Good, as to de&s;pi&s;e all the&s;e Priviledges, and be ungrateful to the Almighty Him&s;elf, the Father and Giver of them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
Therefore, all tho&s;e that are the true Friends of our happy Con&s;titution, cannot but nece&s;&s;arily concur with me in this un|doubted A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz. That there is nothing can be more effectual towards the de&s;troying of our Con&s;titution, than the Heats and Animo|&s;ities which are fomented amongst us, by a cor|rupt Party of Men, who make it their Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s, to a&s;per&s;e and calumniate Men of all Ranks and Degrees, not excepting the Mini&s;terial-Function.</HI> If they do but en|deavour to compo&s;e our Differences by Words of Moderation, or &s;hew any Incli|nation to Peace (which our Go&s;pel teaches us) then the mo&s;t bitter Invectives, and the mo&s;t biting Sarca&s;ms, mu&s;t be the Pro|duct of Virulent Pens. One &s;hould think the Character of &s;ome Men, (e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are appointed to be our <HI>Teachers)</HI> &s;hould be a &s;ufficient Pre&s;ervative from the Indignities of the wor&s;t of Men.</P>
<P>Of this pernicious Temper is that &s;can|dalous Pamphlet, Entituled, <HI>Remarks on a</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<HI>Sermon,</HI> &amp;c. The Author of which has, with the utmo&s;t Malice, endeavour'd to ex|po&s;e and mi&s;repre&s;ent the Reverend Dr. <HI>Kennet,</HI> altho' known to be a Man of Learn|ing and &s;ingular Piety; as al&s;o in a Sphere beyond the Reach of Calumny and Di&s;dain, which may be one Rea&s;on why he takes no Notice of &s;uch an Incon&s;iderate Scribler; who, by his own Confe&s;&s;ion, has not &s;oberly and judiciou&s;ly perus'd his late Sermon, but in a heat of Pa&s;&s;ion and furious Choler, has wre&s;ted his Words quite contrary to his Intention; which Fatal Error, and want of Judgment, has been a means to oblige me to offer this Vindication of that Sermon to the World.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t thing that is worthy of No|tice in his Remarks is, the Di&s;gu&s;t that he takes at the Doctor's <HI>Title,</HI> as well as the <HI>Subject</HI> of his Sermon, endeavouring to In|&s;inuate to the World, <HI>That</HI> Civil War <HI>is a Word that palliates the Crime, rather than any ways agreeable to the Solemnities of the day:</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
How this can be an Affront to any I cannot imagine; For, as yet, I never heard that <HI>Word</HI> Objected again&s;t, even by the great|e&s;t Sticklers, on that Prince's behalf; and I dare &s;ay, the Doctor did not think, nor in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect, that any could Object a|gain&s;t it; For in my mind, it is every whit as proper as that which the Author recom|mends to us, <HI>viz. Rebellion:</HI> And &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould call it <HI>Rebellion</HI> (as the Doctor does in &s;everal places) I am &s;ure no Body can deny, but that it was a <HI>Civil VVar,</HI> and ought properly to be &s;o called, when Two contending Parties in the &s;ame Nation ri&s;e up in Arms, and endeavour the one to con|quer and de&s;troy the other: Is not this a <HI>Civil VVar?</HI> But however, the Doctor does not &s;tick to call it <HI>down-right Rebellion,</HI> and that Party that bore Arms again&s;t their Soveraign, <HI>Rebels:</HI> But all will not plea&s;e; yea, all along he extols the Name of that Excellent Prince to the highe&s;t Pinacle of Fame; and knows no other Epithet for
<PB N="5" REF="8">
the other Party, but <HI>Rebellious Subjects;</HI> &s;o that all he &s;ays about this, is nothing but Quibble; and it looks to me, as if he were afraid our Differences would be too &s;oon Healed; and he &s;eems mightily at a Lo&s;s, when he makes &s;o much to do about an <HI>In|&s;ignificant Name;</HI> and indeed, all the re&s;t is much the &s;ame; and how could it well be otherwi&s;e, whil&s;t he only took a tran&s;ient View of the <HI>Sermon,</HI> which is a very unju&s;t way of Proceedure; &s;o that by this we may (at lea&s;t) gue&s;s, That he was re&s;olv'd to Condemn it, before he had Read it; but if he had deliberately con&s;ider'd and weigh'd one part with another, he might ea&s;ily have &s;een the Doctor's De&s;ign, which was (if po&s;&s;ible) to &s;tench our bleeding Wounds, to heal our Breaches, and allay our Heats and Divi&s;ions, which &s;o much weaken the Fundamentals of our Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And I am per&s;uaded, if all the Mini&s;ters that are accu&s;tom'd to preach on this Day, had taken the &s;ame Cour&s;e, our Animo&s;ities
<PB N="6" REF="9">
and Heart-burnings had been (in a great mea&s;ure) very much allay'd, if not quite vani&s;h'd e're this; which would have been the only means to promote that Peace and Union among&s;t us, to which Her Maje&s;ty does &s;o affectionately invite us.</P>
<P>But, to proceed more clo&s;ely to a Vindi|cation of the Doctor's General A&s;&s;ertions; the Fir&s;t of which is, <HI>That a</HI> French <HI>Intere&s;t and Alliance was one of the leading Cau&s;es of that Day's Evil:</HI> Such a Truth that (till now) I thought no Body could deny; nei|ther do I think that any one can read the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times, and not readily acknowledge it: But that we may come to a right Under&s;tanding of the Matter, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to retro&s;pect into the lat|ter end of the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. and &s;ee what was tran&s;acted in his Reign, in Relation to this Marriage; and it appears, that there were then divers Laws again&s;t the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> &s;o called, and though they were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety
<PB N="7" REF="10">
of his Per&s;on, and the Peace and Pro&s;perity of his Kingdom; therefore it is the more &s;trange, that he him&s;elf &s;hould go about to break them, by that Marriage, notwith|&s;tanding all the Remon&s;trances of his Par|liament and Council, and the great Regret of his People, who yet had a fre&s;h Sen&s;e of the Calamities their Ance&s;tors had &s;uffer'd, under the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> being re&s;olv'd to have the Daughter of a King for his Son, and after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> King had for a long time trifled with him, he at la&s;t fatally turns his Eye to <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> a Daughter of <HI>France,</HI> (tho' the States General did recommend a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Lady at the &s;ame time) yet, as I &s;aid before, having &s;ettled his Looks on <HI>France,</HI> King <HI>Lewis,</HI> or rather Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who manag'd his Affairs, and the Pope, took all the Precaution that was po&s;|&s;ible, about an Affair that was of &s;o great Con&s;equence, to promote the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Reli|gion; hoping, as indeed it prov'd, that when
<PB N="8" REF="11">
once this Marriage was Con&s;ummated, the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks</HI> that the Queen was to bring over with her, would propagate the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Faith in this Nation; and that the De&s;cen|dants from that Marriage, who were to be Educated by Madam their Mother till they came to the full Age of Thirteen, &s;hould in time &s;it upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne; which we <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> felt to our Sorrow, in the Reign of the late King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>And in a &s;hort time, when this Unhappy Marriage was Compleated, the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> that belong'd to the Queen, did create a great deal of Trouble to the Inha|bitants of this Land, by their perpetual Motion, continually running from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e under the pretence of <HI>Conver&s;ion-work;</HI> openly boa&s;ting, that they had Con|verted many Thou&s;ands in the little time they had been here; of which the King re|ceived divers Complaints, as well from <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Bi&s;hops and Mini&s;ters, as from Ma&s;ters of Families: But upon all Matters
<PB N="9" REF="12">
that happen'd on that Subject, the Queen &s;tept into the Breach, to prevent any Mi&s;|chief that was likely to fall on them.</P>
<P>But the King being continually pre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e Clamours, re&s;olv'd to &s;end back tho&s;e <HI>Frenchmen</HI> whom the Q. had brought along with her, which was accordingly put in Execution. The King of <HI>France</HI> (being pu&s;ht on by the <HI>Queen</HI> Mother) took this in &s;uch great Di&s;dain, that he &s;ent an Amba&s;|&s;ador Extraordinary to the <HI>Queen,</HI> and to make his Complaints to the King, which that Mini&s;ter did &s;o effectually, that all the <HI>French</HI> return'd to their former Po&s;ts about the <HI>Queen,</HI> and began their old Trade, of perverting the People of <HI>England,</HI> to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things, with other Calamities which accidentally happen'd at that Time, was the Cau&s;e that the Commons in Parlia|ment a&s;&s;embled, pre&s;ented a large Remon|&s;trance to the King (as may be &s;een at large in <HI>Ruthw. Collect.</HI> Vol. I. Fol. 619,) where|in
<PB N="10" REF="13">
they told his Maje&s;ty, <HI>Of the general Fear that was in his People; of the &s;ecret Working and Combination to introduce an Innovation, and change of their Holy Religion; and that their Fears and Jealou&s;ies were not meerly Conjectural, but ari&s;ing out of &s;uch certain and vi&s;ible Effects, as might demon&s;trate a true and real Cau&s;e; and that notwith&s;tanding the good and whol&s;ome Laws, made to prevent the In|crea&s;e and Growth of</HI> Popery, <HI>yet that they were not put in Execution.</HI></P>
<P>Here they complain, <HI>That Letters of Stay of Legal Proceedings against them, had been procured from his Maje&s;ty; and Commi&s;&s;ions under the Great Seal granted and executed, for Compo&s;ition to be made with</HI> Popi&s;h <HI>Recu&s;ants; which they conceiv'd did amount to no le&s;s than a Toleration odious to GOD, full of Di&s;honour, and extream Di&s;profit to his Maje&s;ty; of ex|tream Scandal and Grie&s; to all his People, and of apparent Danger to the Pre&s;ent State of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
And further, <HI>They let his Maje&s;ty know, that another Ground of their Fears was the mi&s;erable Condition of</HI> Ireland, <HI>where without Controul, the</HI> Popi&s;h <HI>Religion was openly Pro|fe&s;s'd and Practic'd, in divers Parts thereof;</HI> Popi&s;h <HI>Juri&s;diction being there generally exer|ci&s;ed and avow'd; Mona&s;teries, Nunneries, and other Super&s;titious Hou&s;es, Erected, Re|edified and Repleni&s;h'd, with Men and Wo|men of &s;everal Orders; which of what ill Con|&s;equence it might prove, if not &s;ea&s;onably Re|pre&s;s'd, they left to his</HI> Maje&s;ty <HI>to judge.</HI></P>
<P>All which was &s;ufficient to create Fears and Jealou&s;ies of <HI>Popery:</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible, that what is above&s;aid &s;hould not create &s;uch an Effect upon <HI>Prote&s;tants?</HI> That <HI>Romi&s;h Prie&s;ts</HI> (under the Shelter of that <HI>Queen)</HI> &s;hould go from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, to pervert the Peo|ple, and carry their Children beyond Sea, to be Educated in the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Reign of that Sanguinary Woman <HI>Queen</HI> Mary, was not &s;o far di&s;tant, but that the Fire and Faggot of her Day did
<PB N="12" REF="15">
create in them a more than ordinary Ab|horrence of <HI>Popery,</HI> upon which their Fears may ju&s;tly be Grounded; and methinks this &s;hould allay the Heat of &s;ome Men's Pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t them.</P>
<P>To be fearle&s;s of <HI>Popery</HI> when there were &s;uch Cau&s;es, as vi&s;ibly appear'd now, would have argu'd a great deal of Luke-warmne&s;s and Indifferency, towards that Holy Reli|gion which they profe&s;s'd; and indeed, I had a better Opinion of the Nobles of this Land, for their Affection to the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion, &s;ince they &s;ent for the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> when they had any Fear of the change of it.</P>
<P>And let me tell you, it had been well if nothing had been tran&s;acted at that time, as the Doctor truly ob&s;erves, either by Ton|nage or Poundage, by Loans or Benevolen|ces, or any thing el&s;e, but what &s;hould be done by their own Con&s;ent in a Parliamen|tary way: The Laws of the Land are the People's Bulwarks; if they are once Invaded,
<PB N="13" REF="16">
it's impo&s;&s;ible, but that a free People &s;hould have Fears and Jealou&s;ies; and though the Judges declared it Legal yet that was not &s;ufficient to allay the ju&s;t Fears and Jealou|&s;ies of a free People.</P>
<P>Neither did it in the late King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign; and there was further Cau&s;e of Fears, as may be &s;een in the &s;ame Remon|&s;trance, in the&s;e Words: <HI>The Report of the &s;trange and dangerous Purpo&s;e, of bringing in</HI> German <HI>Hor&s;e and Riders, would have turn'd our Doubts into De&s;pair, had not your Maje&s;ty's Me&s;&s;age comforted us, with the A&s;|&s;urance of your Royal Word, that they were not intended for any Service in</HI> England, <HI>but for &s;ome other foreign Imployment; yet the &s;ight of the Privy-Seal, by which they were to be Le|vied, the great Sums of Money, which we found upon Examination to be paid for that Purpo&s;e, gave us just cau&s;e of Fear, that much about the &s;ame time, there was a Commi&s;&s;ion; under the Great Seal, granted unto the Lords, and others of the Privy-Council, to con&s;ider of other ways</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="17">
<HI>for rai&s;ing of Money; &s;o particularly by Im|po&s;itions, gave us just cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, that what|&s;oever was your Maje&s;ty's Gracious Intention, yet there wanted not tho&s;e, that under &s;ome Co|lourable Pretence, might &s;ecretly by this, as by other ways, contrive to change the Frame, both of Religion and Government. The&s;e Men could not be Ignorant, that the bringing in Stran|gers for Aid, have been Pernicious to most States, but to</HI> England <HI>Fatal. And we be|&s;eech your</HI> Maje&s;ty, <HI>to pardon the Vehemency of our Expre&s;&s;ion, if in the Loyal and Zealous Affections we bear to your</HI> Maje&s;ty, <HI>and your Service, We are bold to declare to your</HI> Ma|je&s;ty, <HI>and to the whole World, That we hold it far beneath the Heart of any free</HI> Engli&s;hman, <HI>to think, that this</HI> Victorious Nation <HI>&s;hould now &s;tand in need,</HI> of German Soldiers, <HI>to de|fend their now King and Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>I have tran&s;cibed &s;o much of that large Remon&s;trance of the Commons a&s;&s;embled in Parliament, to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. but three Years after that Marriage, only that
<PB N="15" REF="18">
we may &s;ee what Fears the People had, and judge of the Cau&s;es as we plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The great Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and heavy Calami|ties that came upon this good King, pro|ceeded from that Fatal Match, and the en|deared Affections he had to his Queen, was doubtle&s;s one Rea&s;on that hindred effectual Mea&s;ures to be taken, for the Relief of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in <HI>Rochel:</HI> It is he was Guaran|tee for the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> therefore he was under a &s;pecial Obligation to relieve them; and it &s;eems not that it was his Fault that they were not Relieved, but rather the Mini&s;ters that he Employ'd; for the &s;ent Fleet after Fleet to their Relief, but they all return'd <HI>re Infecta,</HI> not &s;o much as once attempting or endeavouring to give them Relief who were ready to peri&s;h for Hunger.</P>
<P>Therefore, I &s;ay, con&s;idering that the Queen was in the <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, notwith|&s;tanding her abode here; and while it was &s;o, how could it be expected, but &s;he would do all &s;he could to retard Succours to the
<PB N="16" REF="19">
<HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> that had taken up Arms there, for their Rights, Liberties and Religion; That was the Rea&s;on that the Fleets were &s;o &s;low in preparing, and that nothing was done when &s;ent.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when the terrible News was come from the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> to their Deputies at the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, that they were fain to feed upon Dogs, Cats, Rats, Tanned-hides, Parchments, Old-Shoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it forced them to make an open and pre&s;&s;ing Remon&s;trance to the King and his Council, wherein (after they had u&s;ed the mo&s;t Pathetick and Melt|ing Expre&s;&s;ions to ha&s;ten their Relief, and that his Maje&s;ty would di&s;cern who &s;erv'd him faithfully, and who not) may be found the&s;e Words:</P>
<P><HI>By the Glory of Your Scepter, under the Sanctuary of which we are come to put Our|&s;elves, and which it hath plea&s;ed You to tender Us for Our Security, by the magnificent Title of</HI> Defender of the Faith, <HI>which obliges You to Relieve tho&s;e that are Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for that</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="20">
<HI>very Rea&s;on: In &s;hort, by the Faith and Word of a King, which it hath plea&s;ed You to engage for us, Permit not, Sir, our Innocent Blood to Reflect upon Your Crown, to &s;tain it to Ages that &s;hall &s;ucced us, and at pre&s;ent to cry again&s;t Your</HI> Maje&s;ty, <HI>before GOD and Man.</HI></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this Remon&s;trance, and the third Fleet being i&s;&s;ued out to their Relief; yet there was nothing done to en|deavour to break the Digue, and get Pro|vi&s;ions into the City; but at la&s;t the Town was deliver'd up, and that in &s;ight of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, to the great Di&s;honour of the Nation: By this we may gather (as the Doctor truly &s;aid) That on this &s;ide the Water the <HI>French</HI> Services betray'd him, and on the other &s;ide, the <HI>French</HI> Policies were at work to de&s;troy him; and both brought in by that Fatal Marriage.</P>
<P>That a more than ordinary Loo&s;ene&s;s and Prophanene&s;s did over-&s;hadow this Land at that time (e&s;pecially upon the Chri&s;tian-Sabbath) is evident; and if Pro|phanene&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="21">
and Loo&s;ne&s;s in Morals, then Hypocri&s;y, and all other Evils, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily follow: It is not want of Charity to &s;ay (as the Doctor truly ob&s;erves) That the Principles of <HI>Popery</HI> are adapted to a Loo&s;|ne&s;s in Morals; and that the Members of that Church are &s;trict in nothing, but little outward Ob&s;ervations. And no que&s;tion, but it was under the Covert of <HI>Popery,</HI> that a Declaration concerning lawful Sports, to be u&s;ed on <HI>Sundays,</HI> was Publi&s;hed by Arch|bi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI>'s means, who, to Ju&s;tify him|&s;elf, procured a Warrant, without any Date at all, to be Signed by his Maje&s;ty; and this al&s;o was both a Cau&s;e and Scandal of that Evil Day which follow'd; and what ill Effects it had upon the Minds of the People, was then too Notorious.</P>
<P>Plays and Play-hou&s;es, e&s;pecially the horrid Prophanene&s;s that was u&s;ed in them, was a &s;ad Omen of the Calamites which follow'd &s;oon after.</P>

I mention this of purpo&s;e, that I might have an Opportunity to write again&s;t the Plays and Play-hou&s;es of our Day; and I wi&s;h that &s;ome dreadful Judgment from the Almighty is not ready to pour down upon us, for &s;uffering our Holy Religion to be Scandaliz'd and Redicul'd, and the Holy Name of GOD to be abominably Bla&s;|phem'd.</P>
<P>And upon this Account, we have cau&s;e to ble&s;s GOD, for what Her Maje&s;ty has done, in order to Regulate them; and I heartily pray to GOD, that He would in|&s;pire Her Maje&s;ty's Heart &s;o as utterly to depre&s;s them, that the very Name and Remembrance of them may be Buried in Eternal Oblivion. I am glad that I have an Opportunity to Embark my Pen in this Affair, but &s;orry that there is &s;o great an Occa&s;ion for it; and wi&s;h all hone&s;t Men that appear in Print, would have a fling at them; &s;eeng the Prince of Darkne&s;s him|&s;elf (with all the Wits of his dark <HI>Den)</HI>

cannot find out a more ready way to pro|mote his Kingdom than is u&s;ed in the Play|hou&s;es; for there Religion it &s;elf is &s;coffed at, and the Amba&s;&s;adors of it tantaliz'd; and the Name of GOD Prophan'd; and His amazing Providences, by which He can over-turn the Rocks and Mountains, and of a &s;udden make our Hou&s;es (which are for Shelter) to be our Graves, turn'd into Redicule and Sport: There the Devil's Kingdom is promoted in the highe&s;t De|gree, by many Oaths and Cur&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are u&s;ed, to in&s;till the pernicious Seeds of Debauchery into the Minds of Men: And we mu&s;t expect, as long as the&s;e Nur&s;eries of Sin are tolerated, that GOD will &s;till contend with us, and that by more a&s;toni&s;hing Providences, than yet we have either &s;een or felt.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude, with a Word of Advice to the Di&s;turbers of our Publick Peace: Time was, when the Di&s;&s;enters were the only Men that the Church was afraid of;
<PB N="21" REF="24" MS="Y">
but &s;ince the <HI>Revolution</HI> in Eighty Eight, there is another Generation ri&s;en among&s;t us that is more dangerous than the Di&s;&s;en|ters ever were, becau&s;e they pretend to be the mo&s;t Legitimate Sons of the Church; when in the mean time, they are her great|e&s;t Enemies: The&s;e are they that are again&s;t the Settlement of the Crown in the <HI>Prote&s;tant Line:</HI> That are for the Church, no farther than they can advance the Inte|re&s;t of their Beloved Prince at St. <HI>Germains:</HI> The&s;e are they that ca&s;t Bones of Conten|tion among us, if po&s;&s;ible, to divide us, that they might the &s;ooner attain their end.</P>
<P>But let me tell you, Gentlemen, and you may take it for an a&s;&s;ured Truth, He whom you expect will never come to inherit the Imperial Crown of <HI>England:</HI> No, no, The People of <HI>England</HI> (for the mo&s;t part) are &s;o in Love with <HI>Prote&s;tani&s;m,</HI> with their Lives Liberties and E&s;tates, and have &s;uch an ill Opinion of <HI>Popery, Arbitrary-Power,</HI> and <HI>Wooden Shoes;</HI> of the now exploded
<PB N="22" REF="25">
Doctrines of <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience,</HI> that they are re&s;olved to main|tain the <HI>Prote&s;tant Line,</HI> whatever it co&s;t them.</P>
<P>Therefore, I advi&s;e you not to di&s;turb our Tranquility; &s;ubmit your&s;elves to the <HI>Government,</HI> and don't let your Minds han|ker any longer after the Court at St. <HI>Ger|mains;</HI> for I tell you agen, all your Hopes will be Fru&s;trated: And if you will conti|nue to undermine our Con&s;titution, Know then, that you will work your own Ruin, for the <HI>Government</HI> will be &s;upported under our Gracious Queen <HI>ANNE:</HI> But as for you, you will only be matter of Scoff and Scorn to all &s;ucceeding Generations, and your Hou&s;es will be made de&s;olate for ever.</P>
<P>The <HI>Revolution</HI> in Eighty-Eight was the immediate Effect of the over-ruling Hand of GOD; his all-powerful Arm was mo&s;t vi&s;ibly &s;een in that Tran&s;action, above and beyond the Expectation of the Wi&s;e&s;t of
<PB N="23" REF="26">
Men, neither do I think, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> him&s;elf did &s;uppo&s;e it would fall as it did; No, It was GOD's immediate Hand, therefore it will &s;tand, and the Gates of Hell &s;hall never be able to over-turn it.</P>
<P>You, who refus'd to &s;wear to him, have had Peace and Quietne&s;s during his Reign, and none of you all &s;uffer'd in your Liber|ties and Properties, but tho&s;e that were im|mediately concern'd in Plotting again&s;t the Life of that Excellent Prince; yea, notwith|&s;tanding you brought that Di&s;tinction of a King, <HI>de facto,</HI> and <HI>de jure</HI> upon our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Stage, yet he bore it patiently, and like a wi&s;e and di&s;creet Prince, kept us in Peace during his Reign.</P>
<P>Now, &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Di&s;tinction had been rai&s;ed in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> II. and I'll a&s;&s;ure you, there was more Cau&s;e, would he have born it? You do not &s;up|po&s;e it; No, he would have made you felt the weight of his angry Arm.</P>

<HI>But King</HI> William <HI>took another Method; he cho&s;e rather to govern his People with the plea&s;ing Scepter of</HI> Peace <HI>and</HI> Love; <HI>&s;o that the har&s;h Note of,</HI> This is my Plea&s;ure, <HI>and</HI> I will be Obey'd, <HI>was never heard during his Reign; and &s;o it continues, under the benign Reign of our</HI> Prote&s;tant <HI>Queen: What then, Gentlemen, would you have?

<P><HI>It was credibly Reported, That you kept private Meetings in the late Reign, wherein you u&s;ed a</HI> Liturgy <HI>different from the E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Liturgy of the Church: You that are in your Con&s;ciences for a Liturgy, and yet not to u&s;e that which the Church has thought fit to E&s;tabli&s;h; there is none but will Condemn you; and indeed, your &s;eparate Meetings from the Church may properly be called</HI> Conventi|cles, <HI>from</HI> Convenire in Malum, <HI>for the ma|ny Plots and Con&s;piracies again&s;t good King</HI> William, <HI>was the Con&s;equent of tho&s;e Meetings,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="28">
and I wi&s;h that no &s;uch private Cabals are now kept up, again&s;t the Soveraignty of our good Prote&s;tant Queen.</P>
<P>'Tis, indeed, a very melancholy and pen&s;ive Thought, That when any Body appears from Pulpit or Pre&s;s, in favour of Mode|ration, and thereby endeavour to re&s;tore Peace to our Langui&s;h|ing I&s;land, he is pre&s;ently &s;tigmatiz'd (and that by you Gentle|men) for a Man of <HI>Whiggi&s;h</HI> Principles, and a Favourer of <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters;</HI> as if all Chri&s;tian Vertues were fled from the <HI>Church</HI> to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI> I wonder you are not a&s;ham'd to &s;candalize that <HI>Church</HI> which you pretend to be your Mother. The Apo|&s;tle &s;ays, That Meekne&s;s, Temperance, Love, Long-&s;uffering, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the Fruits of the Spirit; then (if what you &s;ay is true) all the choice Gifts of the Spirit, are departed from the Church, and gone to the Di&s;&s;enters: This is &s;uch a Di&s;paragement to our E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, that it is almo&s;t in&s;ufferable.</P>
<P>And, I pray, why &s;o angry with the Di&s;&s;enters? You &s;ay, Becau&s;e they Detruncated a good and pious King; we all confe&s;s they did &s;o; but mu&s;t your Anger and Malice continue for ever? That Generation is almo&s;t extinct, and can you &s;et no Bounds to your Malice, but mu&s;t continue it to their Po&s;terity, from Ge|neration to Generation.</P>
<P>One &s;hould think they had (at lea&s;t in part) atton'd for that, in the late Revolution, when our E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church was come almo&s;t to its Period; even then did the Di&s;&s;enters do whatever the Church could wi&s;h for its Support; and I do not que&s;tion, but the true Sons of the Church have (and will have) a grateful Sen&s;e thereof. The Church has had now full Fifteen Years Tryal of the Di&s;&s;enters, and what can they lay to their Charge, in all this time? None can &s;ay, but they have behaved them&s;elves quietly and peaceably in their re&s;pective Callings; not &s;o much as lifting up a Finger again&s;t the Government, either in Church or State, and continue &s;o to to do; and &s;o long as they have their Liberty of &s;erving GOD according to their Con&s;ciences, I dare &s;ay, they will never do the lea&s;t thing, that may tend to de|&s;troy the <HI>Act of Settlement;</HI> nay, they rejoyce in it, and I am per|&s;uaded, they will part with all that is dear to them, before they will part with the Prote&s;tant Line.</P>
<P>And why, I pray, &s;o angry with the moderate Churchmen? You &s;ay, becau&s;e they turn'd out a King of our own, and brought in a <HI>Foreigner,</HI> becau&s;e it is they that forced our Beloved King to

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>A Certain Per&s;on having writ a Letter to Dr. <HI>Kennet,</HI> on his la&s;t 31&s;t of <HI>January</HI> Sermon; which having Read, I cannot but admire at the extraordinary Gift of Raillery its Author is endow'd with: How|ever, in his heat of Pa&s;&s;ion we may ob&s;erve, That by way of Caution he re&s;erves to him&s;elf &s;o much Self-Intere&s;t and Pride, as to let it go Name|le&s;s into the World, with but a bare In&s;inuation, of being Writ <HI>By a Gentleman.</HI> 'Tis certain, whoever our Author is, he has taken the wrong Methods to di&s;cover his Gentility, to a Per&s;on who, not a&s;ham'd of owning him&s;elf, has &s;ub&s;cribed his Name to that Moderate Church-Sermon, which purges the Gall and Spleen of this unknown Gentleman. We may well enough &s;uppo&s;e him to be (and I have Rea&s;on enough to believe it) a Per&s;on, who lyes under the Misfortune of being a <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> in his Heart, and, if I &s;hould examine a little further, 'tis ten to one, if a certain Friend of that Mighty Judicious Papi&s;tical Author, <HI>Heraclitus Ridens,</HI> cannot produce a Certificate of our Author's Gentility from the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ea,</HI> or <HI>Queen's-Bench,&mdash;</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e him, what he's Ambitious of, and think him a Learned and Liberal One too; and &s;o come to examine the Particulars of his Letter.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, being a Stranger to the Doctor, he is mighty kind in making him a Pre&s;ent, by owning at the &s;ame time, that he's very in|different whether he accepts it or not. Says he, <HI>I had rather do Violenceo</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="30">
<HI>to my own Temper, than not Cen&s;ure &s;o per&s;idious an Author, &s;uitable to his D$|m$rits.</HI> By this we may ob&s;erve, the <HI>Gentleman</HI> is a Man of no better Principle than <HI>Temper,</HI> which he has done <HI>Violence</HI> to; and that tho&s;e Principles which put Men upon doing <HI>Violence</HI> to Rea&s;on, &s;pring either from the Doctrine of <HI>Infallibility,</HI> or a Loo&s;ne&s;s in Life and Morals; which too often runs a Head &s;o far, as to lay violent Hands upon Nature it &s;elf at la&s;t.</P>
<P>But, to make an end of our Gentleman the <HI>Shorte&s;t-way,</HI> he adds; <HI>The just</HI> Scandal <HI>all good</HI> Churchmen, <HI>and</HI> Engli&s;hmen <HI>too, as well as</HI> my Self, <HI>have taken at your Sermon,</HI> &amp;c. Now, I appeal to the Publick, and ask, Whether any moderate good Clergyman, or <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> has &s;o much as once appear'd in Print again&s;t the Doctor fairly, with his Name to the Book? I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Sermon has provok'd a great many Partizans of a <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;t, be&s;ides too many Hu&s;&s;ing, Swearing, and High-flying Enemies to the true <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion, in its exten&s;ive Acts of Charity, and the Rights and Priviledges of the People, to vilify and &s;candalize the Doctor, and &s;pue out their Invectives again&s;t him. For my part, I know no others but &s;uch Creatures as the&s;e, which, with him&s;elf, he &s;ays very unlearnedly, have ju&s;tly ca&s;t a <HI>Scandal</HI> upon him. A pretty Argument I take it again&s;t him&s;elf; wherein he in&s;en&s;ibly owns, and con|fe&s;&s;es Logically, That he, and &s;ome others, have <HI>Scandaliz'd the Doctor's Sermon:</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e &s;everal <HI>Churchmen</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> re&s;ented it, as he &s;ays, I would fain know of what Religion and Country he is. <HI>As well as my &s;elf,</HI> he adds, which Tacitly implies, That he is neither <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> nor a true <HI>Churchman;</HI> and that the <HI>All</HI> he means, mu&s;t be only tho&s;e of the &s;ame Tribe and Gang of High-flyers, like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After this, he runs on, and rails again&s;t the Doctor's Panegyrick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and exclaims again&s;t him, for calling the popular Commotions of that Time a <HI>Civil War,</HI> when, in the very Second Page of his Letter, he owns it as &s;uch him&s;elf; &s;ays he, <HI>I may, and do &s;incerely believe</HI> (the Reader is de&s;ired to ob&s;erve the Harmony of this Expre&s;&s;ion) <HI>and know, That the late</HI> Civil War <HI>was en horrid</HI> Rebellion. <HI>I may, and do believe,</HI> is &s;o bar|barou&s;ly put together, that it renders the whole Sentence Rediculous, and oppo&s;ite to Sen&s;e: But our Author is a Gentleman, and it &s;eems &s;o far different from others, that he's void of all the nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications requir'd in One.&mdash;</P>
<P>To proceed, He continues to exclaim again&s;t the Doctor, for making Additions to his Preached Sermon, and for leaving out &s;everal Expre&s;&s;i|ons in his Printed one, which he &s;poke in the Pulpit. If he would have us Believe him before the Doctor, who with a Reputation above Malice, is well enough known by mo&s;t People; he &s;hould have open'd him&s;elf freely to the World, that we might have been &s;atisfied on who&s;e Sleeve we were to pin our Faith: By this Ob&s;curity there is too much Ground to believe, our Author's Pen was Mercenary; and that Nece&s;&s;ity was at her the Product of this Pa&s;&s;ion, than Quality, or Zeal for the Cau&s;e;
<PB N="22" REF="31">
&s;o that whatever he &s;ays upon that Head, will meet with no Reception from true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants, who always love to Believe with their Eyes open.</P>
<P>Further, in effect, he calls the Doctor Villain, along with that Great Man <HI>MILTON,</HI> &amp;c. thereby proving plainly, that his Principles are of the &s;ame Size and Latitude of tho&s;e who drank a Health to <HI>Sorrel,</HI> re|flecting at the &s;ame time on a Dead Monarch; Language more becom|ing the Supporters of <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> and the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> than one who &s;tyles him&s;elf a Gentleman! I never heard a Gentleman, in all my Life, be&s;tow &s;uch an Epithet upon <HI>Milton;</HI> who, &s;etting a&s;ide Republican Principles, de&s;erves an Eternal Commemoration: 'Tis therefore rather an Honour for the Doctor to be ranked with &s;o great a Man, than a Di&s;paragement, as out Gentleman would In&s;inuate.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this Gentleman's Letter runs on with &s;o many vain Repe|titions and Scurrilous Impertinencies, that it is neither worth my while to Repeat, nor my Reader's to hear them. 'Tis enough to &s;ay, That if the Doctor had been any ways Guilty of Partiality in that Sermon, the World would have found him, el&s;e this, under another &s;ort of Cen&s;ure than this pretended Gentleman in Ma&s;querade, has ca&s;t upon him.</P>
<P>To conclude, and come to the clo&s;e of our Author's Letter, 'tis worth our while to ob&s;erve what he &s;ays there with a Spirit of Rancor and Ma|lice. 'Tis a &s;ign he is what <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> had better be freed from; and that his Principles of <HI>Revenge</HI> are carried on not only again&s;t the Doctor, but to the Reverend Bi&s;hops: Says he, <HI>&mdash;The common Re&s;ult is, e&s;pecially with them who know how your Intere&s;t lyes, that tho&s;e Reverend Prelates, who have hitherto e&s;pou&s;ed you, mu&s;t be behind the Curtain.</HI></P>
<P>Which very Words manife&s;t, that he is oppo&s;ite to the pre&s;ent Con|&s;titution of Government, which is now the be&s;t in the World, &amp; without its Continuation, <HI>England</HI> will be mi&s;erable. The &s;pite he owes our Bi|&s;hops, gives us a pro&s;pect of the Affection he has, for a Government of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power:</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed be God, our Bi&s;hops are Men of more moderate and charitable Principles and &s;uch who have &s;een not long &s;ince, what di&s;mal effects the contrary Opinions have had in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, he is not content to Reproach the Bi&s;hops, but concludes all with Threat|ning them thus: <HI>Thus</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>are they innocently brought in for your Guilt, and as like to &s;uffer &s;till more, if they take not this Occa&s;ion to &s;hew the utmost of their Re&s;entments:</HI> That is as much as to &s;ay, tho&s;e good Bi&s;hops who e&s;pou&s;e you now, when time comes that we &s;hall have a Red-hot per&s;ecuties Reign of our own, &s;hall have a Re&s;idence in the Tower, and perhaps find a <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> or <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Fate. Time may come, that we may have <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Ma&s;s-hou&s;es, Seminaries and Nunneries, in this Kingdom; and then look out for a <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s, or <HI>Corni&s;h</HI>'s Fate.</P>
<P>This, Reader, &s;eem $o be the Language of this Letter-Monger, who, with all the Enemies to Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, and pre&s;ent Liberty and Free|dom of Con&s;cience, make it their $Span$ to make us Slaves to <HI>France,</HI> and Ruin as all <HI>The Shortest Way,</HI> which God Almighty forbid <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
