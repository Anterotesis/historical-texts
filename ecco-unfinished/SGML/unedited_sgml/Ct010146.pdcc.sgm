<P>_I BELIEVE the Hint, which you or one of your Corre&s;pondents &s;ome Time ago gave us, <HI>That the neglecting the Guard of the Seas hath formerly been made an Ar|ticle of Impeachment,</HI> may have had &s;ome Effect, where you intended it &s;hould ope|rate.

How then does <HI>this Gentleman</HI> vindicate the Mea&s;ures, which have been lately taken <HI>here,</HI> on Account of the <HI>Spani&s;h Depredations?</HI> Why, he endeavours to per&s;uade us, that the <HI>Depre|dations,</HI> committed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are not near &s;o <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> as they have been <HI>repre&s;ented;</HI> that the Commanders of His Maje&s;ty's Squadrons, in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> had Orders to <HI>protect our Commerce,</HI> and make <HI>Repri&s;als;</HI> and that proper Steps were taken here for granting <HI>Letters of Marque.</HI></P>

You &s;ee, Sir, that his <HI>late Maje&s;ty,</HI> by his <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> above two Years ago, complained of <HI>Ho|&s;tilities</HI> committed again&s;t his Subjects; <HI>open Ho&s;tilities,</HI> that had been <HI>then a long Time,</HI> and were <HI>almo&s;t daily</HI> committed, in Viola|tion of all <HI>Treaties; Ho&s;tilities,</HI> that had been <HI>then openly</HI> complained <HI>of,</HI> but with|out <HI>Satisfaction</HI> or <HI>Redre&s;s;</HI> Ho&s;tilities, that would have <HI>&s;ufficiently ju&s;tified</HI> the <HI>mo&s;t vigorous Mea&s;ures</HI> for Redre&s;s.

<P>IT would be a Reflection on the Me|mory of his <HI>late Maje&s;ty,</HI> as well as inju|rious to the Character of Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> to produce any further Evidence by Way of Proof in the Ca&s;e.

I'll mention but one; the Author of the <HI>Enquiry.</HI> He tells us more than once, that the <HI>Protection of his Ma|je&s;ty's Trading Subjects from the Depreda|tions of the</HI> Spaniards <HI>was one End of &s;et|ting out the Squadrons under Admiral</HI> Ho|&s;ier, <HI>and Sir</HI> John Jennings.

go as far back as the <HI>Enquiry</HI> does: And if they expre&s;s them&s;elves on the Subject with equal <HI>Solemnity and Seriou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> it mu&s;t be owned that They have <HI>equal Truth</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> on their Side.</P>
<P>THIS Harmony and exact Con&s;i&s;tency between <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Foes,</HI> in an important Point, rendered the Ca&s;e extremely <HI>nice</HI> and <HI>perplexing.</HI> It was not &s;afe to admit that our Lo&s;&s;es had been <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> at any Time, <HI>&s;ince our refu&s;ing the &s;ole Mediation at</HI> Cambray, and the breaking up of the <HI>Congre&s;s;</HI> for <HI>that</HI> might have given Mr. <HI>D'Anvers</HI> Occa&s;ion for &s;ome <HI>malicious Triumph:</HI> Nor was it advi&s;eable to deny, that our Lo&s;&s;es had been very great <HI>&s;ince that Time;</HI> for <HI>that</HI> would have been giving the Lye to Mr. <HI>Stanhope</HI>'s <HI>Letter</HI> and <HI>Me|morial,</HI> and di&s;owning the <HI>Enquiry.</HI> So that, <HI>qu&acirc;cunque vi&acirc;,</HI> the Danger is great!

<P>WHEN I fir&s;t undertook the Employ|ment of a <HI>Political Writer,</HI> I had, I confe&s;s, the Curio&s;ity to read mo&s;t of the <HI>Pamphlets</HI> and <HI>Papers,</HI> which were pub|li&s;hed again&s;t me; in Order to rectify my <HI>own Mi&s;takes,</HI> as well as to remove tho&s;e Objections of my <HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> which I found to be invalid.

For this Rea&s;on, I make no Doubt that many of the&s;e <HI>profound Scribblers</HI> care&s;s them&s;elves with an Opinion that they have <HI>gall'd</HI> me in Writings, which I never read, or &s;aw, or heard of; unle&s;s, perhaps, in <HI>the publick Adverti&s;ements.</HI> This would certainly have been the Ca&s;e of a <HI>little, dirty Compo&s;ition of Fal&s;hood and Scurri|lity</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="25">
(intitled, <HI>One Word to the Craft&s;man Extraordinary</HI>) had I not found that &s;ome <HI>eminent Merchants,</HI> in <HI>this City,</HI> thought their whole Body (and e&s;pecially tho&s;e tra|ding to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI>) mo&s;t infamou&s;ly vilified in it, and &s;eemed to de&s;ire that &s;o vile an In&s;ult upon them, under all their heavy Lo&s;&s;es, might not pa&s;s without &s;ome Animadver&s;ion, at a Time, when they are applying to <HI>Parliament</HI> for <HI>Reparation.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS induc'd, upon <HI>this Account only,</HI> to give the Author of <HI>One Word</HI> a cur&s;ory Peru&s;ual; and, finding the Complaint ju&s;t, to be&s;tow a <HI>Word or two</HI> upon it, by way of Reply, in Vindication of our <HI>injur'd Merchants,</HI> without making any Remarks on his <HI>Billing&s;gate Reflections,</HI> and <HI>impo|tent Menaces.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>foregoing, excellent Letter</HI> (which I had the Honour to receive from an <HI>un|known Corre&s;pondent</HI>) is, I think, a full An&s;wer not only to the <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> but to this <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> which &s;truts forth as its <HI>Second,</HI> with Regard to the <HI>Spani&s;h De|predations, Letters of Repri&s;al,</HI> and the <HI>In&s;tructions of our Commanders in the</HI> We&s;t-Indies. But the <HI>Second</HI> hath gone beyond his <HI>Principal</HI> (to whom my <HI>Corre&s;pondent</HI> confines him&s;elf) in &s;everal Points; and as it commonly happens to <HI>had Advocates</HI> of
<PB N="25" REF="26">
a <HI>bad Cau&s;e,</HI> hath left it even much wor&s;e than he found it.</P>
<P>HIS chief De&s;ign is to prove that our <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Merchants in general, and tho&s;e of <HI>Jamaica</HI> in particular, are no better than a vile Combination of <HI>Smuglers, Pyrates</HI> and <HI>Thieves,</HI> who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>plunder</HI> the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and carry on an <HI>illi|cit Trade,</HI> contrary to <HI>Treaties;</HI> that the true Rea&s;on of their de&s;iring <HI>Letters of Marque</HI> is to &s;ecure this <HI>wicked Traffick,</HI> as it is called and not to protect their own <HI>lawful Trade,</HI> or make them&s;elves <HI>ju&s;t Re|prizals.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the Charge in expre&s;s Terms. I will now appeal to the World what Cla|mours would have been rai&s;ed again&s;t <HI>me,</HI> and what Puni&s;hment I &s;hould mo&s;t ju&s;tly have de&s;erved, had I pre&s;umed to treat &s;o <HI>large</HI> and <HI>valuable</HI> a Body of Men in this infamous Manner &mdash; I have been often charg|ed, without any Rea&s;on, by the <HI>Writers</HI> again&s;t me, and even by &s;ome <HI>other Per&s;ons,</HI> with <HI>giving Encouragement</HI> to the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> and <HI>furni&s;hing them with Rea&s;ons</HI> again&s;t coming to an Accommodation; but may not <HI>this Charge</HI> be ju&s;tly turn'd again&s;t the <HI>Writer</HI> before me; or is it po&s;&s;ible for him to clear him&s;elf from it? Is not the whole Drift of his <HI>Pamphlet</HI> to &s;hew, in
<PB N="26" REF="27">
the mo&s;t bare-fac'd Manner, that our <HI>un|fortunate Merchants</HI> are a Parcel of <HI>law|le&s;s Robbers</HI> and <HI>Buccaneers,</HI> who have no ju&s;t Preten&s;ion to <HI>that Reparation,</HI> which they de&s;ire for their many great and heavy Lo&s;&s;es? Is not this giving the Lye to the <HI>Enquiry</HI> and the frequent Remon&s;trances of our <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> which repre&s;ent the&s;e Cap|tures, in the &s;tronge&s;t Light, as <HI>unju&s;t Vio|lences, Ho&s;tilities</HI> and <HI>Depredations,</HI> and make them one of the chief Motives for &s;ending a <HI>Squadron,</HI> at &s;o va&s;t an Expence, into the <HI>We&s;t-Indies?</HI> Is not this giving <HI>Encouragement to our Enemies,</HI> and <HI>fur|ni&s;hing them with Rea&s;ons</HI> for <HI>refu&s;ing any</HI> Reparation?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scribler</HI> thinks that he hath clinched this Point of a <HI>Thieving, contra|band Trade,</HI> by quoting an Extract of a <HI>Letter</HI> from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> publi&s;hed in the <HI>Craft&s;man;</HI> in which my Corre&s;pondent &s;ends me Word, <HI>That the</HI> Guard&s;hips <HI>be|ing gone from thence with the</HI> Galleons, <HI>they have &s;ome Pro&s;pect of a flouri&s;hing Trade again; at lea&s;t for &s;ome Time;</HI> upon which, this <HI>worthy Gentleman</HI> begins to triumph, and cries out, <HI>What can be plain|er?

It hath long been a Complaint that the&s;e <HI>Guard Ships,</HI> under the Pretence of preventing <HI>clande&s;tine Trade,</HI> do really ob&s;truct our <HI>lawful Com|merce,</HI> as it hath been often remon&s;trated by our <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> though without Effect, to the Court of <HI>Spain;</HI> and what does <HI>my Friend</HI> &s;ay more, than that the&s;e <HI>the&s;e Ships</HI> being now gone, the Gentlemen of <HI>Jamai|ca</HI> hope to carry on their Trade again, for &s;ome Time, without <HI>Mole&s;tation?</HI></P>

<P>I AM told likewi&s;e, that &s;omething might be urged in Ju&s;tification of the <HI>private Trade to the Coa&s;t,</HI> which would be, at lea&s;t, &s;ufficient to &s;ecure it from the Imputation of <HI>Felony;</HI> but as that is not proper, I mu&s;t content my &s;elf with ob&s;erving, that <HI>this &s;candalous Writer</HI> ought to have been better informed of the POWER of the <HI>Governors of</HI> Jamaica, before he publi&s;hed &s;uch undi&s;tingui&s;hing Calumny on the Gentlemen of that <HI>I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Writer</HI> declines entering into any Detail of the <HI>Number</HI> or <HI>Value</HI> of the
<PB N="30" REF="31">
<HI>Spani&s;h Captures;</HI> which is, I think, very prudent in him, after he hath condemned them all to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as <HI>lawful Prizes,</HI> being taken, as he tells us, from a Ne&s;t of <HI>Pyrates</HI> and <HI>Plunderers.</HI> But as I find, that others of a different Opinion, are de|&s;irous to &s;ee a <HI>true Account</HI> of the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es, I de&s;ign to give my Readers a <HI>true Li&s;t</HI> of them, according to the be&s;t Informa|tion I &s;hall be able to obtain, without including any taken on what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call the <HI>Prohibited Trade.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is another Thing, which my <HI>pre&s;ent Adver&s;ary</HI> &s;eems to require; with which I am afraid I cannot oblige him; and that is, to deduct out of my <HI>Li&s;t</HI> all &s;uch <HI>Briti&s;h Merchant-men,</HI> as <HI>have been &s;nap|ped up by</HI> Spani&s;h <HI>Ships or Sloops not in</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion; <HI>for it mu&s;t be owned,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that &s;ome of them have been not</HI> Pri|vateers <HI>but</HI> Pyrates, <HI>and &s;o are not charge|able on the</HI> Spaniards, <HI>as a Nation, or as a Government.</HI> I am glad to hear that the <HI>Briti&s;h Merchants</HI> and our Fellow-Subjects of <HI>Jamaica</HI> are not the <HI>only Pyrates</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> but though <HI>Ships,</HI> taken with|out the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> are not <HI>chargeable on him;</HI> yet if it can be proved (as I am told it can) that many of the&s;e <HI>Captors</HI> have had Commi&s;&s;ions from the
<PB N="31" REF="32">
<HI>Spani&s;h Governors,</HI> who are them&s;elves often concerned in <HI>the&s;e Ships,</HI> I hope the un|happy Sufferers have &s;ome Right to <HI>Repri|&s;als;</HI> or, at lea&s;t, to <HI>Security</HI> from &s;uch Practices for the future; and if our <HI>Squa|dron</HI> had not been <HI>better engaged,</HI> or if <HI>Letters of Marque</HI> had been granted, I doubt not that the Seas would have been &s;oon cleared of <HI>tho&s;e Ravagers.</HI> I am very unwilling to believe, that this <HI>Forbearance</HI> on <HI>one Side,</HI> and the&s;e <HI>vigorous Ho&s;tilities,</HI> on the <HI>other,</HI> did proceed from any In|&s;tances made by <HI>fal&s;e Friends</HI> to the <HI>for|mer,</HI> or from the A&s;&s;urances which the <HI>lat|ter</HI> received from the <HI>&s;ame Per&s;ons,</HI> that they might continue their <HI>Depredations,</HI> without any Apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> or <HI>Repri&s;als.</HI> But one Thing I mu&s;t take the Liberty to ob&s;erve; which is, that though the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> accord|ing to <HI>this Author</HI>'s own Confe&s;&s;ion, are concerned in this &s;ame <HI>Smugling, Thieving, Pyratical Trade,</HI> as well as <HI>our Subjects,</HI> and con&s;equently are equally obnoxious to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> yet very few, if any, of the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch Merchant-men</HI> have had the Misfortune to be <HI>&s;napp'd up</HI> by the <HI>Spani&s;h Cruizers,</HI> whether <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioned</HI> or not, &s;ince the <HI>Rupture.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">THIS <HI>worthy Writer</HI> &s;eems to know very little of the <HI>Barlevento Fleet;</HI> which, he &s;ays, is a Fleet of <HI>&s;mall Men of War,</HI> kept on Purpo&s;e to <HI>coa&s;t along the Shore, and attack the Logwood Cutters</HI> and <HI>Buc|caneers;</HI> whereas I am informed, by &s;ome Gentlemen acquainted with <HI>Parts,</HI> that <HI>this Fleet</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of a Number of Ve&s;&s;els, kept only to carry <HI>Money</HI> to St. <HI>Domingo</HI> and <HI>other Settlements,</HI> to pay their <HI>Garri&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>BUT however this may be (which I cannot pretend ab&s;olutely to determine) he is very gro&s;ly mi&s;taken, when he &s;ays, that none but <HI>We&s;t-India Merchants de&s;ired Letters of Repri&s;al;</HI> for if the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> had thought fit to advi&s;e the granting of <HI>&s;uch Letters,</HI> he would have found, I be|lieve, that <HI>many others</HI> would have applied for them; but if the only De&s;ign of them was to protect <HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> who de&s;ired them, in Acts of <HI>Theft</HI> and <HI>Pyracy,</HI> I think they were very <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> and <HI>hone&s;tly refu&s;ed;</HI> though in this he contradicts his Ma&s;ter, the <HI>Ob&s;ervator,</HI> who allows, <HI>that the Mer|chants, in the Situation we were then in, with Regard to</HI> Spain, <HI>had a Right to de|mand them;</HI> which cannot, I think, be ju&s;t|ly &s;aid of <HI>Thieves</HI> and <HI>Pyrates.</HI></P>
<P>HE di&s;covers the &s;ame Ignorance, when he rea&s;ons that <HI>Letters of Repri&s;al</HI> were
<PB N="33" REF="34">
never granted but in Ca&s;es of <HI>open War,</HI> which he pre&s;ently after <HI>contradicts</HI> him&s;elf, by &s;aying, that they are <HI>very &s;eldom, if ever granted, till</HI> War <HI>is declared;</HI> nay, he tells us, that this did not proceed from the <HI>Merchants being refu&s;ed,</HI> but from their <HI>not finding their Account in them.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>Letters of Repri&s;al</HI> have been often granted in <HI>peaceable Times,</HI> and with very <HI>good Effect;</HI> of which I could produce &s;everal In&s;tances out of our own Hi&s;tory, and tho&s;e of other Nations; but the Thing is too well known to take any Pains to fal&s;ify the A&s;&s;ertions of &s;uch a <HI>Writer.</HI></P>
<P>IN another Place, he asks the&s;e wi&s;e Que&s;tions; <HI>Was ever &s;uch a Thing de&s;ired? Private Ships of War to protect Trade! Was it ever known that Merchants fitted out their</HI> own Convoys? and immediately <HI>an&s;wers him&s;elf,</HI> in the &s;ame <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent Manner,</HI> that <HI>they have very</HI> rarely <HI>been employed as Convoys, except on very ex|traordinary Occa&s;ions.</HI> Who ever &s;aid, or thought that they were employed on <HI>ordi|nary Occa&s;ions?</HI> and if they have been &s;ome Times made u&s;e of, however <HI>rarely</HI> upon <HI>extraordinary Occa&s;ions,</HI> why does he ask whether &s;uch a Thing <HI>was ever known?</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="35">
I will give him one In&s;tance, and that &s;hall be in the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> which hath been forced to Tax them&s;elves upwards of Six thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> to keep two Ve&s;&s;els crui&s;ing round the I&s;land, in or|der to prevent the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in peaceable Times, from &s;tealing their <HI>Negroes,</HI> and committing other Enormities on their E|&s;tates; as well as for convoying their <HI>un|di&s;puted Home Trade.</HI> &mdash; But &s;uch <HI>In|con&s;i&s;tencies</HI> and <HI>Contradictions</HI> are too com|mon in the Writers on <HI>this Side,</HI> to cau&s;e any A&s;toni&s;hment!</P>
<P>IT is very ob&s;ervable, that the Gentle|men of <HI>Jamaica</HI> have been repre&s;ented in the &s;ame <HI>infamous Light</HI> by &s;everal <HI>late Writers,</HI> as well as <HI>this;</HI> particularly by the <HI>South-Sea Company's Factor,</HI> and late <HI>Plenipotentiary at</HI> Soi&s;&s;ons. What they have done to de&s;erve &s;o much <HI>Calumny</HI> and <HI>Ill-Treatment</HI> I cannot &s;ay; but however <HI>neglected, de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> and <HI>in&s;ulted</HI> this <HI>I&s;land</HI> may be, I could almo&s;t venture to promi&s;e, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> would readily accept of it as an <HI>Equivalent</HI> for his pre&s;ent Claim and Preten&s;ions to <HI>Gibraltar</HI> it&s;elf; for I think I could prove, that if any Place can be of greater <HI>Importance</HI> to the <HI>Briti&s;h Commerce</HI> than <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> it is the I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and I am &s;ure I could demon|&s;trate
<PB N="35" REF="36">
that it is of ten Times the Con&s;equence to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>THE Advantages of <HI>this I&s;land</HI> to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> have been often &s;et forth; but as they &s;eem to be always indu&s;triou&s;ly forgot|ten, as &s;oon as mentioned, I will conclude with recapitulating a few of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT employs many Thou&s;ands of <HI>poor People</HI> and <HI>ruined Families,</HI> who cannot provide for them&s;elves, and are obliged by Misfortunes to for&s;ake their native Country.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT takes off the &s;everal <HI>Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in which almo&s;t the <HI>whole Produce</HI> of this I&s;land is ve&s;ted.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT does not only con&s;ume our <HI>Manu|factures</HI> it &s;elf, but vends va&s;t Quantities of them to its Neighbours, particularly of the <HI>Staple Commodities.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. IT furni&s;hes us with great Part of our <HI>Silver Bullion,</HI> which hath been &s;o &s;carce, ever &s;ince <HI>this I&s;land</HI> hath been in a <HI>declining Condition.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. IT pays va&s;t Duties to the Crown, not only for <HI>tho&s;e Commodities,</HI> which it produces it&s;elf, but for <HI>others,</HI> which it <HI>im|ports</HI> into <HI>Great Britain.</HI> &mdash; I am told, that
<PB N="36" REF="37">
<HI>Rum,</HI> for In&s;tance, pays <HI>Four Shillings Duty,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> for what is worth but <HI>Thirteen-pence Sterling</HI> upon the I&s;land.</P>
<P N="6">6. IT is of very great U&s;e to our <HI>Nor|thern Colonies,</HI> the greate&s;t Part of who&s;e Produce is vended in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the <HI>other Plantations;</HI> &s;o that the Inhabitants of <HI>tho&s;e Colonies</HI> are, in a great Mea&s;ure, &s;upported, and the <HI>Duties,</HI> which they pay to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> are chiefly owing to <HI>the&s;e Plantations.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. IT is &s;o conveniently &s;ituated by Na|ture, that no Place in the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-In|dies</HI> is &s;o commodious, in Ca&s;e of War, either to protect our <HI>own Trade,</HI> or to an|noy our <HI>Enemies,</HI> by lying in the middle of them. We have no other Place near to keep a Fleet of Ships in <HI>Harbour,</HI> or to <HI>refit</HI> and <HI>victual</HI> them upon Occa&s;ion. What could our late Squadron, at the <HI>Ba&s;timentos,</HI> have done without <HI>Jamaica?</HI> And we may judge, even from what <HI>they did,</HI> what <HI>might be done</HI> by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>this I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal other <HI>Advantages</HI> and <HI>Benefits,</HI> attending the happy Situation of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which it is not proper to enu|merate in this Place, or the&s;e <HI>&s;candalous Calumniators</HI> &s;hould be more particularly an&s;wered. &mdash; I am indeed almo&s;t a&s;hamed
<PB N="37" REF="38">
of having taken &s;o much Notice of them; and nothing but a Point of &s;uch a tender Nature as <HI>Trade,</HI> and the Cau&s;e of our <HI>&s;uf|fering in&s;ulted Merchants</HI> &s;hould have made me &s;ubmit to &s;o mean an Employ|ment.</P>
<P>THEIR <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> is now coming before the <HI>Parliament;</HI> and as I hope they will be able to prove them&s;elves an <HI>hone&s;t, indu&s;tri|ous</HI> and <HI>valuable Body of Men,</HI> who de&s;ire only the free Enjoyment of their <HI>own Pro|perty</HI> and <HI>Commerce,</HI> not any Protection for <HI>Pyracy</HI> and <HI>Rapine;</HI> &s;o we can make no Doubt that they will receive all the Re|paration for their <HI>pa&s;t Lo&s;&s;es,</HI> and all the Security for their <HI>future Trade,</HI> which the <HI>Legi&s;lature,</HI> in Conjunction with his <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI> (the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Protector</HI> of all his People) have it in their Power to give them.</P>
