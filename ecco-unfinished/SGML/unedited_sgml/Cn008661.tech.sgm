<P>THOUGH the mixed Drama of the la&s;t Age,
called <HI>Tragi-Comedy,</HI> has been generally con|demned
by the Critics, and perhaps not without Rea|&s;on;
yet it has been found to &s;ucceed on the Stage:
Both the Comic and Tragic Scenes have been applaud|ed
by the Audience, without any particular Excep|tions.
Nor has it been ob&s;erved, that the Effect of
either was le&s;s forcible, than it would have been, if
they had not &s;ucceeded each other in the Entertainment
of the &s;ame Night. The Tragic Part of this Play has
been always e&s;teemed extremely Natural and Intere&s;t|ing;
and it would probably, like &s;ome others, have
produc'd its full Effect, notwith&s;tanding the Interven|tion
of the Comic Scenes that are mixed with it: The
Editor therefore, would not have thought of removing
them, if they had not been exceptionable in them|&s;elves,
not only as indelicate, but as immoral: For this
Rea&s;on, he has &s;uffered &s;o much of the Characters of
the <HI>Porter</HI> and the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> to remain, as is not liable to
this Objection. He is, however, to account, not only
for what he has taken away, but for what he has added.
It will ea&s;ily be comprehended, that the leaving out
Something, made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that Some|thing
&s;hould be &s;upplied; and the Public will be the
more ea&s;ily reconciled to this Nece&s;&s;ity, when they are
acquainted that the Additions are very incon&s;iderable,
and that the Editor has done his utmo&s;t to render them
of a Piece with the re&s;t. Several Lines of the Original,
particularly, in the Part of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> are printed, though
they are omitted in the Repre&s;entation. Many Things
plea&s;e in the Reading, which may have little or no Ef|fect
upon the Stage. When the Pa&s;&s;ions are violent,
and the Speeches long, the Performers mu&s;t either
&s;pare their Powers, or &s;horten their Speeches. Mrs.
<HI>Cibber</HI> cho&s;e the latter; by which &s;he has been able to
exert that Force and Expre&s;&s;ion which has been &s;o
&s;trongly felt, and &s;o &s;incerely applauded.</P>

<L>That I can't tell: The Sex is very various:
There are no certain Mea&s;ures to be pre&s;crib'd, or fol|low'd,

<L>No, wilfully marries her: and which was
wor&s;e, after &s;he had &s;ettled all her Fortune upon a
Nunnery, which &s;he broke out of to run away with
him. They &s;ay they had the Church's Forgivene&s;s,
but I had rather it had been his Father's.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why in good Truth, the&s;e Nunneries, I &s;ee
no Good they do. I think the young Lady was in the
right, to run away from a Nunnery: And I think our

without a Portion.</L>
