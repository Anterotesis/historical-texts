<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;eemingly whim&s;ical Name in the Title Page of this Poem may with good Rea&s;on make the Reader curious to know, on what account We take it upon us: Which We intend to do with all the Brevity that's po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">The OLD THREE (call'd &s;o from their coming into the World together at a Birth) are the Sons of <HI>Gregory Pickle,</HI> Yeoman of <HI>Taun|ton</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et-Shire;</HI> and were born <HI>Oct. 14th. 1688.</HI> Our Mo|ther, who was the only Daughter of <HI>Abraham Muzzer,</HI> an eminent Bar|ber in tho&s;e Parts, dy'd in Child-bed of us. Our Father was &s;oon after unfortunately cru&s;hed to pieces in Har|ve&s;t-time, by the overturning of his own Waggon: and leaving us very Young, and without any Thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, We became a Burthen to the Pari&s;h. But after &s;ome Time, a worthy Neighbouring Gentleman; who &s;hall be namele&s;s, and whom We de&s;ire to accept of this &s;mall publick Acknowledgment for all his Favours,
<PB REF="4">
compa&s;&s;ionated our Condition, and very ho&s;pitably receiv'd us into his Family. When we were about Ten Years of Age, he &s;ent us all <HI>Three</HI> to an eminent School in <HI>London;</HI> where (in our own Opinion) we &s;oon made a great Proficiency in Cla&s;&s;ical Learning: and being puff'd up with Youthful Vanity, we re&s;olv'd to leave School, and &s;eek our Fortunes; which accordingly We did, <HI>Nov. 26, 1706.</HI> About this Time, after a long and warm Controver&s;y between our &s;elves, and one <HI>Aminadab Zeal,</HI> an eminent Teacher among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> we were forc'd to give up the Point, and accordingly chang'd our <HI>Habits. A|minadab</HI> was a Man of admirable good Sen&s;e, and &s;o well vers'd in all parts of Learning, that we began to &s;u&s;pect, He was not really, what He
<PB REF="5">
appear'd to be; and we were con|firm'd in it, by accidentally &s;urprizing him one Morning, fumbling over his <HI>Beads,</HI> and paying his Devotion to an <HI>old, ru&s;ty Ten-penny Nail.</HI> At our Entrance into the Room, He was in &s;ome Confu&s;ion; but after He had pretty well recover'd Him&s;elf, He plainly told us, That He was a <HI>Ro|mi&s;h Emi&s;&s;ary, Superiour</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> that him&s;elf and &s;ome others of that Order in the &s;ame <HI>Di&s;gui&s;e</HI> had lately made &s;everal <HI>Pro&s;elites;</HI> but enjoin'd us Secrecy, with a Pur&s;e of <HI>500 Guinea's.</HI> With this Money we made &s;everal Attempts to &s;ettle our &s;elves in the World; but meeting with frequent Di&s;appointments, We, at la&s;t, by the Advice of &s;ome of our Friends, furni&s;h'd our &s;elves with
<PB REF="6">
Three <HI>Hor&s;es,</HI> a pair of <HI>Baggs,</HI> a <HI>Portmanteau,</HI> and a <HI>Trumpet:</HI> Our <HI>Remedies</HI> and our <HI>Letters Patent</HI> were of our own Preparation. Being thus equipp'd, We &s;et out from <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and did incredible Service to all, who apply'd them&s;elves to Us: By this means We contracted a va&s;t Corre&s;pondence in all Parts of the Kingdom; which put us to &s;uch Expence, that having &s;quander'd a|way a great Part of what We had got by our Practice, We judg'd it our be&s;t Way to &s;ell our Hor&s;es, retire, and pa&s;s the Remainder of our Days in a private Life.</P>
<P>It woud be needle&s;s to give the Reader any farther Trouble at pre|&s;ent, de&s;igning in a &s;hort Time to print Propo&s;als for publi&s;hing by Sub|&s;cription
<PB REF="7">
a full and impartial Hi&s;tory of our whole Lives, and all our Ad|ventures, &s;ince our Father's Death, in two Volumes in Folio; Which is already in great Forwardne&s;s.</P>
