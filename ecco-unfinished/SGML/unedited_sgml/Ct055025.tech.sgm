<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THIS &s;mall Treati&s;e was
originally intended for a
private Paper of In&s;tru|ctions
to the</HI> GENTLEMAN, <HI>who&s;e
Name it bears, to direct Him how
to manage him&s;elf under the</HI> Gout.
<HI>It is, indeed, an Ab&s;tract of a
larger one, on the &s;ame Subject,
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
which has lain by me the&s;e &s;even
Years; which, yet, I have not
had Lei&s;ure or Humour to fini&s;h.
Several Copies of this having got
Abroad, and the pitiful Conde&s;|cendence
of Pyrating Book&s;ellers,
even to &s;uch Trifles as the&s;e,
have con&s;train'd me to let it come
out in Print, as it is, to pre|vent
its coming out from them.
The Gentlemen of the Profe&s;&s;ion
may ea&s;ily perceive, by the Gro&s;&s;|ne&s;s
of the Philo&s;ophy, and the
low Detail of the Pharmacy, it
was not de&s;ign'd for them. If
any &s;hall think fit to di&s;pute or
critici&s;e on the</HI> Doctrine <HI>here
laid down, they may do it &s;ecure|ly,
as if the</HI> Author <HI>were as much
dead, as the&s;e his Labours will
&s;hortly be: I hope I know the
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
Value of Time and Pains, and
the Vanity of all Human Specula|tions
better, than to employ them
in defending &s;uch Trifles. All I
undertake for them, is, That the
Facts may be depended upon for
their Truth. And the Method
and Medicines for their Efficacy,
towards the End, in the Circum|&s;tances
propos'd. If any Per&s;on
under them, &s;hall either amu&s;e him|&s;elf,
by reading this Paper; or
lighten his Pain, by following its
Directions, I &s;hall have obtain'd
all I propos'd by it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the Account of the</HI> Bath
Waters <HI>given here, it came natu|rally
in the way of my Subject; and
is &s;uch as the Ob&s;ervations I have
made &s;ugge&s;ted to me. I &s;carce
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
know, and have taken no Notice
of what others may have writ|ten
or ob&s;erv'd on the&s;e Waters;
nor, indeed, had it been po&s;&s;ible
for me, in my pre&s;ent Situation,
being without my Books, and con|fin'd
to Bounds, by the Nature of
my De&s;ign. I have often ob&s;erv'd,
with Admiration, the Wi&s;dom and
Goodne&s;s of Providence, in fur|ni&s;hing
&s;o wonderful an Antidote,
to almo&s;t all the</HI> Chronical <HI>Di&s;|tempers
of an</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Con&s;titu|tion
and Climate, which are chiefly
owing to Errors of Diet, or ra|ther,
as a Sacred Writer expre&s;|&s;es
it, To</HI> Idlene&s;s and Fulne&s;s of
Bread. <HI>The Rankne&s;s of the Soil;

<ITEM>_THE Introduction. <HI>Page</HI> 1. &sect;. 1.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the rea&s;on why, of two Per&s;ons in
all other Circum&s;tances the &s;ame, the
one has the <HI>Gout,</HI> the other is free from
it, is, That the <HI>&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els</HI> of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on
in their <HI>original Conformation</HI> are narrower and
more &s;tiff than tho&s;e of the other. <HI>p.</HI> 2. &sect;. 2.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of an acquir'd <HI>Gout</HI> in the fir&s;t
Per&s;on, or tho&s;e born of &s;ound Parents; is the
abundance of <HI>Tartarous, Urinous,</HI> or other <HI>Salts</HI>
introduc'd into the Blood by the Food. <HI>p.</HI> 3. &sect;. 3.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we learn the rea&s;on why, on the fir&s;t At|tacks
of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in otherwi&s;e healthy People,
the Humours generally fall on the Joints of the
Limbs. <HI>p.</HI> 4. &sect;. 4.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may likewi&s;e &s;ee the rea&s;on, why the fir&s;t
<HI>Fits</HI> enrage and remit once in twenty four Hours:
why the whole <HI>Fit</HI> la&s;ts fourteen Days; and
la&s;tly, why the <HI>Acce&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Remi&s;&s;ions</HI> of tho&s;e
broken with the <HI>Gout,</HI> happen only in fourteen
Days: And why the whole <HI>Duration</HI> in &s;uch
is made up of &s;everal &s;uch <HI>Acce&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Remi&s;|&s;ions. p.</HI> 5. &sect;. 5.</ITEM>
<PB REF="8">
<ITEM>Hence we may di&s;cover the rea&s;on why <HI>Gouty</HI> Per|&s;ons
are People of good natural 'Parts, large
Feeders, and long-liv'd. <HI>p.</HI> 6. &sect;. 6.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may conclude, that a <HI>Fit</HI> of the <HI>Gout</HI>
is an Effort of Nature to throw off this abun|dance
of Salts, through the more &s;tiff and nar|row
<HI>Strainers;</HI> or we may con&s;ider it as a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI>
of a putrid Fever, where the noxious Humour
is di&s;charg'd on &s;ome of the Mu&s;cles or Joints.
<HI>Ibid.</HI> &sect;. 7.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence we may di&s;cover the Vanity of all Preten|ders
to an <HI>univer&s;al</HI> and certain Remedy for the
<HI>Gout. p.</HI> 9. &sect;. 8.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hence there can be but two direct ways of treat|ing
the <HI>Gout;</HI> one by widening the Capacities
of the <HI>&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els;</HI> the other by le&s;&s;ening the
Quantity of the <HI>Salts. Ibid.</HI> &sect;. 9.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Difference between <HI>Hereditary</HI> and <HI>Acquir'd
Gouts. p.</HI> 10. &sect;. 10.</ITEM>

more &s;trict Management in an <HI>Hereditary</HI> than
in an <HI>Acquir'd Gout. p.</HI> 11. &sect;. 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Advantages of Labour and Exerci&s;e in the
<HI>Gout;</HI> to which however, two Conditions mu&s;t
be added: 1. That it be not too violent: 2. That
a moderate Diet be joined to it. <HI>Ibid.</HI> &sect;. 12.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Two ways of le&s;&s;ening the Quantity of <HI>Salts</HI> in the

<HEAD>SOME SHORT
OBSERVATIONS
Concerning the due
METHOD
Of Treating the
GOUT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I. _DE&s;igning this Paper for the
In&s;truction and Relief of my
particular Friend, I &s;hall on|ly
make &s;uch Ob&s;ervations,
as directly tend to that Purpo&s;e; Pa&s;&s;ing
by all <HI>Theories</HI> of the Di&s;temper, as
<PB N="2" REF="14">
far as is con&s;i&s;tent with giving the Rea|&s;on
of my Opinions. For after having
laid down two <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> (which will
be found the Principles of my Rea&s;on|ing
through this Di&s;cour&s;e) I proceed
to the Ob&s;ervations them&s;elves.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Prop.</HI> 1. Of two Men having all
other Circum&s;tances alike, as near as
may be; Of the &s;ame Parents; Born
Healthy; Of the &s;ame Stature, Com|plexion,
Diet, Air, Exerci&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It
&s;eems to me impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign a &s;olid
Rea&s;on, why the One &s;hou'd be afflicted
with the <HI>Gout,</HI> the Other be ab&s;olutely
free from it, but this, That the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Capillaries.</NOTE> &s;malle&s;t
Ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on mu&s;t be in
their natural<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Make.</NOTE> Conformation narrower
and more<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ten&s;e.</NOTE> &s;tiff, than tho&s;e of the Other,
who is free from the <HI>Gout,</HI> in re&s;pect of
their common Stature and Size. For
thereby the Crude and Gro&s;s Humours,
which are confin'd, or pa&s;s with Pain, in
the <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on, will ea&s;ily flee off by
<PB N="3" REF="15">
Per&s;piration, and the other Drains of
the Body, in the Per&s;on free from the
<HI>Gout.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Prop.</HI> 2. The Cau&s;e of an Ac|quir'd
<HI>Gout</HI> in the fir&s;t Per&s;on, or in
tho&s;e born of &s;ound Parents, &s;eems to
me, to be the Abundance of Tarta|rous,
Urinous, or other Salts, intro|duc'd
into the Blood by the Food. Salts
&s;eem neither to peri&s;h, nor to be be|gotten;
but to be con&s;tant and incor|ruptible
Parts of Animal and Vegetable
Bodies. The Delicacy and Flavour of
Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, is entirely owing to their
abounding with a fine, &s;oft, oyly, or uri|nous
Salt, as is evident in Veni&s;on and
Wild Fowl. Wines, of all kinds, have a
greater or le&s;&s;er Quantity of Tartar in
them: And other &s;trong Liquors abound
in their peculiar Salts, in Proportion
to their Strength. Spirits are nothing
but a great Quantity of Vegetable Salts
crowded together in a little Water and
Oyl. The&s;e Salts receiv'd in abun|dance,
but neither &s;ufficiently broke by
<PB N="4" REF="16">
the Dige&s;tive Powers, nor driven out
of the Habit by due Exerci&s;e; but by
their Plenty and Nearne&s;s, uniting in
greater Clu&s;ters, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily form
Ob&s;tructions, and give Pain, when, by
the Force of the Circulation, they are
thru&s;t through narrower and &s;tiffer
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Capillaries.</NOTE> &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. Nothing either re|ceiv'd
or bred within the Body, be&s;ides
the&s;e Salts, can account for this Dif|ference.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 1. Hence we may learn
the Rea&s;on why, on the fir&s;t Attacks of
the <HI>Gout,</HI> in otherwi&s;e healthy People,
the Humours generally fall on the Joints
of the Limbs: Becau&s;e, in the Joints, the
&s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els are more compre&s;s'd, by
the larger Heads or Protuberancy of the
Bones, and are thereby render'd narrow|er
and more readily ob&s;tructed. The&s;e
Ob&s;tructions fall on the Joints of the
Limbs; becau&s;e of the greater Length
of the&s;e &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, between the
Heart, the Origin of the Motion of all
<PB N="5" REF="17">
the Fluids, and the&s;e Joints; their other
Extremity: Whereby the Quickne&s;s of
the Circulation dimini&s;hing, Ob&s;truc|tions
are there more readily form'd.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Corroll.</HI> 2. Hence likewi&s;e we may
&s;ee the Rea&s;on, why the fir&s;t Fits, of
otherwi&s;e healthy Per&s;ons, Enrage and
Remit once in Four and twenty Hours.
The<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When it begins to enrage.</NOTE> Acce&s;s being at Sun-&s;et, and the
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When it begins
to be ea&s;ier.</NOTE> Remi&s;&s;ion about Day-break. Why
the whole Fit in &s;uch la&s;ts about Four|teen
Days. And la&s;tly, why the par|ticular
Acce&s;&s;es and Remi&s;&s;ions, of Per|&s;ons
advanc'd in Years, and broken
with the <HI>Gout,</HI> happen only once in
Fourteen Days. And why the whole
Duration of the Fit is made up of &s;eve|ral
&s;uch Acce&s;&s;es and Remi&s;&s;ions in equal

(which hinders Per&s;piration) at Sun-&s;et,
beyond what it is at Day-break, toge|ther

&s;eems to determine the Times.
The greater Degree of Sizine&s;s in the
Fluids, of People advanc'd in Years,
and broken with the <HI>Gout,</HI> lengthens
out the Duration of the&s;e Acce&s;&s;es

of Fourteen Days, &s;eems to ari&s;e

that of a Regular intermittent Fever.
The whole Duration of who&s;e Fits put
together, <HI>Sydenham</HI> has ob&s;erv'd alrea|dy,
to be equal to Fourteen Days. But
the particular Explication of all the&s;e
Things, wou'd require more Room than
can be allow'd them, in the Bounds I
have pre&s;crib'd to my &s;elf. My Friend,
if he plea&s;es, may con&s;ult <HI>Bellini</HI> on
this Head.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="21">
VI. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 3. Hence we may di&s;co|ver
the Rea&s;on of the common Ob&s;er|vation,
that Gouty Per&s;ons are People
of good Natural Parts, large Feeders,
and long-liv'd: Becau&s;e the Fibres of
the &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, being more &s;tiff
and &s;pringy than ordinary, the Circu|lation
is brisker, more full and free:
whereby the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>That is Eating, Dige&s;ting, and Evacuating,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Natural Functions are
more readily and regularly perform'd;
and therein the be&s;t Health and true&s;t
Sen&s;ations con&s;i&s;t: Strong Health re|quires
liberal Supplies; and both toge|ther
lengthen out Life.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 4. From the&s;e al&s;o, we
may di&s;cover what a Fit of the Gout is,
to wit, An Effort of Nature, to throw
off this Abundance of Salts, through
more &s;tiff and narrow<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Secretory Ducts.</NOTE> Strainers. Salts
of all Kinds are more or le&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cau&s;tick.</NOTE> Burning:
The Urinous mo&s;t of all, as is evident
from <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Flies, and that unextin|gui&s;hable
<PB N="8" REF="22">
Sub&s;tance, call'd the <HI>Pho&s;phe|ros,</HI>
&s;o readily and plentifully to be had
from Human Urine. (The Rea&s;on of
which may be from their pointed Figure,
piercing more readily, by its being be|&s;mear'd
with a light Oyl: Or from their
greater attractive Force; or from &s;ome
other Quality, not yet, or perhaps ne|ver
to be di&s;cover'd.) What is certain
is this, That Per&s;ons of a large Appe|tite,
as <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;ons generally are,
feeding plentifully of Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, and
drinking liberally of generous Wines,
or other &s;trong Liquors, and u&s;ing,
either too little, or too much Exerci&s;e,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily over&s;tock their Blood
with the&s;e fix'd and incorruptible Parts
of Animal and Vegetable Bodies; which
in their Nature being Hard and Burn|ing,
can't fail, fir&s;t, to rai&s;e a Tumult
and Fever; and then to give violent
Pain, as they are driven out of the Ha|bit,
through more &s;tiff and narrow &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els, by the Force of the Circulation:
So that a Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> may be con&s;i|der'd,
as a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of a putrid Fever,
<PB N="9" REF="23">
wherein the noxious Humour is thrown
upon &s;ome of the Mu&s;cles or Joints of
the Body.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 5. Hence we may di&s;|cover
the Vanity of the Pretenders, to
a certain and univer&s;al Remedy for the
<HI>Gout.</HI> For unle&s;s a Remedy could be
found, which at once cou'd change and
new-mould the &s;olid Parts of Human
Bodies; alter the Nature and Qualities
of Animal and Vegetable Bodies; and
de&s;troy Parts, that are in their own
Nature fix'd and permanent, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
it &s;hou'd be certain and univer|&s;al;
and how po&s;&s;ible &s;uch a Remedy is,
I leave every one to judge.</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 6. Hence it is evident,
there can be only two direct Ways of
Treating the <HI>Gout,</HI> with any Pro&s;pect
of Succe&s;s. The one is, by &s;tretching
and widening the Capacities of the &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els, and<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Slackning.</NOTE> relaxing their <HI>Fibres.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="24">
The other is, by le&s;&s;ening the Quanti|ty
of the Salts introduc'd into the Fluids
by the Food; the&s;e being the two An|tidotes
or Oppo&s;ites to the two funda|mental
Cau&s;es of acquir'd <HI>Gouts.</HI></P>
<P>X. Here it may be convenient to
take notice of the Difference between
hereditary and acquir'd <HI>Gouts.</HI> The
latter is produc'd in a Per&s;on, otherwi&s;e
&s;ound, from Ignorance or Negligence
of the exact Rules of living. For tho'
there be a natural Configuration of Parts,
that di&s;po&s;es one Man more than ano|ther
to the <HI>Gout;</HI> yet there might be a
Method of Diet order'd, which &s;hou'd
prevent it. The former is a<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stain</NOTE> Taint
(compounded perhaps of Scurvy, Stone
and Pox) tran&s;mitted to the Patient
with the Principles of Life, together
with a Di&s;po&s;ition in this Taint, to
unite it &s;elf to any Malignity, intro|duc'd
into the Habit, through Ex|ce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="25">
XI. <HI>Coroll.</HI> Hence we may ob&s;erve
the Nece&s;&s;ity of a much more &s;trict
and careful Management, in hereditary
<HI>Gouts,</HI> than what is nece&s;&s;ary in acquir'd
ones. In the fir&s;t, the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is
ingrain'd and tran&s;ub&s;tantiated into the
Solids, and other Principles of Life,
and impo&s;&s;ible to be rooted out by hu|man
Art and Indu&s;try: The mo&s;t that
can be done is, to le&s;&s;en and relieve the
Symptoms. Whereas in acquir'd <HI>Gouts,</HI>
the noxious Humour being more con|fin'd
to the Fluids, a proper Diet, due
Exerci&s;e, and a few well-cho&s;en Reme|dies,
may go a great way; if not to a
perfect Cure, yet to make Life tolera|bly
ea&s;y under them.</P>
<P>XII. Of all tho&s;e things that a <HI>Gouty</HI>
Per&s;on can &s;afely undertake for his
Health, wi&s;ely manag'd Exerci&s;e, &s;eems
that alone, which can be&s;t an&s;wer one
part of the fir&s;t Intention, <HI>viz.</HI> The
widening the Capacities of the &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els. Labour or Exerci&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ts the
<PB N="12" REF="26">
<HI>Gouty</HI> three different ways: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as it
increa&s;es the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Inte&s;tine Motion.</NOTE> Motion of the Parts of
the Fluids among them&s;elves; &s;o that
their Salts, by their<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Colli&s;ion.</NOTE> &s;triking one a|gain&s;t
another, are broken and made
le&s;s, that they may pa&s;s more readily
through the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. <HI>Secondly,</HI>
as it adds a new and <HI>foreign</HI> Force to
the Blood, and thereby promotes its
Circulation from the Heart through the
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els; driving &s;ome of the gro&s;|&s;er
Parts of the Fluids through them,
which in the ordinary Cour&s;e of the Cir|culation
wou'dn't pa&s;s &s;o freely; and
thereby opening their Ob&s;tructions and
enlarging their Capacities. <HI>Thirdly,</HI>
as it increa&s;es the natural Per&s;piration;
the Action of the Mu&s;cles in Labour
and Exerci&s;e, and the Spring of the So|lids
by their multiply'd Efforts, &s;queez|ing
the Strainers of all their Contents.
But to make Labour and Exerci&s;e as u&s;e|ful
as they may be, two Cautions mu&s;t
be added to them: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that they be
<PB N="13" REF="27">
not too violent, in re&s;pect of the Pa|tient.
For too violent Exerci&s;e will,
nece&s;&s;arily, either &s;pend the Spirits,
whereby the Dige&s;tions and Circulation
will be impair'd; and &s;o a regular <HI>Gout</HI>
be brought into an irregular one: Or
by &s;haking all the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts at once
upon the Extremities, a regular Fit will
be forc'd out; which, in le&s;s violent
Exerci&s;e, might have been &s;pent by Per|&s;piration.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> that Moderation
in eating and drinking be join'd to it;
For commonly <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;ons are large
Feeders; and Exerci&s;e emptying the
Stomach, the Guts and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els,
if the Appetite be &s;atisfy'd to its Crav|ing,
the Evil is rather increas'd than di|mini&s;h'd
thereby.</P>
<P>XIII. There be two direct Ways of
le&s;&s;ening the Quantity of the Salts, which
produce the <HI>Gout.</HI> The fir&s;t is, by a
total Ab&s;tinence from, or a great Ab|&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s
in Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h and &s;trong
Liquors, which introduce tho&s;e Salts
into human Fluids. But this Cour&s;e is
<PB N="14" REF="28">
never to be undertaken, but with great
Caution, and in the la&s;t Extremity: For
the&s;e two Rea&s;ons; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e an
entire Vegetable Diet weakens all the
dige&s;tive Powers, and all the Functions
of Life; impoveri&s;hes the whole Ma&s;s
of the Fluids; impairs the Strength,
and di&s;pirits the Man: And thereby ne|ce&s;&s;arily
begets the wor&s;t kind of Hy&s;te|rical
and Hypocondriacal Di&s;orders,
and all their black and di&s;mal Con&s;e|quences
(at lea&s;t till the Body has been
long accu&s;tom'd to it) which is a Di&s;|ea&s;e
far wor&s;e than the <HI>Gout</HI> it &s;elf: And
to which the <HI>Gout</HI> only brings the Pa|tient,
in its la&s;t and fatal Stages. <HI>Se|condly,</HI>
becau&s;e this Diet, once enter'd
upon, is never after to be chang'd, un|der
the Danger of certain Death, or
the mo&s;t violent enraging of all the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Symptoms. For a Vegetable
Diet, as has been ju&s;t now hinted, weak|ening
the Dige&s;tive Powers, and all the
Functions of Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Patient can
never after be brought to bear with a
free way of living, without the Hazard
<PB N="15" REF="29">
of certain Death, or a violent enraging
of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Symptoms; as is too plain
from many<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Life of the P. of <HI>Conde.</HI></NOTE> fatal In&s;tances. If any
Diet is ever to be try'd in the <HI>Gout,</HI> it
is to be order'd in <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s Method;
that is, by living on the white Foods;
eating Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h of the lighte&s;t Di|ge&s;tion,
and drinking generous, un|mix'd
Wines, both of them in &s;mall,
and con&s;tantly equal Quantities; in
Weight and Mea&s;ure; under the Crav|ing,
of the Appetite, and proportion'd
for the mere Support of Life.</P>
<P>XIV. The other direct way of ba|ni&s;hing
the Salts out of the Habit is by
Evacuations. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> otherwi&s;e a
mo&s;t accurate Ob&s;erver of Nature, and
a mo&s;t judicious Practitioner, has been
the Occa&s;ion, I think, of a great Mi|&s;take
in the Management of the <HI>Gout;</HI>
by forbidding almo&s;t all Evacuations,
either in the Fit, or in the Intervals,
for fear of weakening the Con&s;titution.
<PB N="16" REF="30">
There are two Sea&s;ons, to wit, Spring
and Fall, when the Periodical Fits of
regular <HI>Gouts</HI> commonly happen; which
I con&s;ider as Cardinal and Critical Di&s;|charges,
under general and mechanical
Influences, for purifying the Blood, and
di&s;charging the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts: In which
Nature is no more to be di&s;turb'd in its
Operations (I mean as to Purging, for
even then a gentle, &s;low, con&s;tant and
uniform Per&s;piration and Breathing
Sweat may be promoted, not only &s;afe|ly,
but with great Advantage) than in
the Monthly Purgations of the Sex. But
in light, flying Touches of the <HI>Gout,</HI>
out of the&s;e Sea&s;ons; and in the Inter|vals
of the Fits, gentle, warm, &s;to|machick
Purgers will be an excellent
Remedy to &s;end the&s;e a going, to le&s;&s;en
the Fits, and lengthen the Intervals.
A Per&s;on out of the Pain and Inflamma|tion
of the Fits, and in their Intervals
(except his natural Di&s;po&s;ition to breed
another Fit) is, to all Intentions of
Medicines, the &s;ame as a well Per&s;on.
And all Medicines levell'd again&s;t other
<PB N="17" REF="31">
Di&s;ea&s;es incident to human Bodies, may
be as &s;afely admini&s;ter'd to a <HI>Gouty</HI> (re|gard
being had to his particular Con&s;ti|tution)
as to any other Per&s;on. Where|fore,
the general and direct Methods
of relieving the <HI>Gout,</HI> are, In the Fits,
a gentle, uniform, continu'd Per&s;pira|tion
and Breathing Sweat. In the In|tervals,
Labour or Exerci&s;e, and gen|tle,
Stomachick Purgers.</P>
<P>XV. The Secondary or le&s;s direct
Methods of relieving the <HI>Gout,</HI> are prin|cipally
the&s;e two, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Dilution, by
proper Liquors. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Strengthners
of the In&s;truments of the Dige&s;tion.
Nothing is more likely to thin the
Blood; to di&s;&s;olve and break the Salts,
and keep them at a di&s;tance from run|ning
into Clu&s;ters, than proper Dilu|ters;
as we &s;ee in Fevers, Rheumati&s;ms,
and other inflammatory Di&s;tempers.
For this Rea&s;on, among others, it is,
that <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>German Spaw</HI> Waters,
and all other <HI>Mineral Chalybeat</HI> Waters;
<PB N="18" REF="32">
Dwarf-Elder Tea; Trifoil Tea; light,
quick, Green Tea; &s;mall &s;picy Bitters
on Water, and &s;uch like, drunk freely,
Blood warm, on an empty Stomach,
become &s;o u&s;eful in Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI>
Water is the univer&s;al Di&s;&s;olvent of Salts
of all &s;orts; and being repleni&s;h'd with
the &s;picy, bitter and active Parts of other
Bodies, it &s;trengthens the Stomach and
Bowels; breaks and di&s;&s;olves the Salts;
clean&s;es the in&s;ides of the Ve&s;&s;els from
the Foulne&s;s that con&s;tantly adheres
to them, and carries it out of the
Body, by increas'd Per&s;piration and
Urine.</P>
<P>XVI. Strengthners of the In&s;truments
of Dige&s;tion, are an excellent Remedy
in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> If the Di|ge&s;tions
be true and good; the Parts of
the <HI>Chyle</HI> be made &s;ufficiently &s;mall,
and the Circulation be full and com|pleat
(all which are the common Ef|fects
of Stomachick Medicines) the Salts
will be le&s;s; the Ob&s;tructions of the
<PB N="19" REF="33">
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els fewer, and the Impurities
of the Fluids will more ea&s;ily pa&s;s by
Per&s;piration, and the other Drains of
the Body; and &s;o the Fits of the <HI>Gout</HI>
become more ea&s;y, and le&s;s frequent.
Among all the Strengthners of the Di|ge&s;tions,
I wou'd recommend a &s;trong
Infu&s;ion of the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI>'s Bark, in gene|rous
Claret, as being the coole&s;t Bitter,
the mo&s;t powerful Strengthner of re|lax'd
<HI>Fibres</HI> in the In&s;truments of Di|ge&s;tion;
and the greate&s;t Antidote of
the urinous Salts, e&s;pecially if join'd
with <HI>Chalybeats,</HI> and &s;ome Qualifiers of
its mawki&s;h and nau&s;eous Ta&s;te. The
Bark has the &s;ame Effect on the Coats
and <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Ve&s;&s;els, that Oak Bark
has on raw Leather; and the &s;ame Ef|fects
on the Fluids to prevent their Co|agulation;
and to render them uniform,
that the <HI>Te&s;taceous</HI> Powders have on Vi|negar,
or as they have on Milk, to
prevent its Curdling: But more e&s;pe|cially,
as it produces &s;uch Wonders on
the Solids and Fluids in intermittent
<PB N="20" REF="34">
Fevers; to the State and Condition of
both which, the Solids and Fluids of
<HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;ons bear &s;o near a Re&s;em|blance,
as has been ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Coroll.</HI> 2.
Wherever the Bark is proper, I re|commend
the <HI>Glans Guercma,</HI> or A|corn,
as of the &s;ame Cla&s;s of Medi|cines,
and in &s;ome Ca&s;es of Relaxation
exceeding the other. It is cool and ea|&s;ily
dige&s;ted. But they do be&s;t united.
All bitter and &s;picy Medicines have more
or le&s;s of the &s;ame Quality; but heat
the Body more, and brace the <HI>Fibres</HI>
le&s;s.</P>
<P>XVII. <HI>Mercury,</HI> by its Weight, and
its con&s;tantly forming it &s;elf in little
Spheres (or perhaps from its greater
attractive Force) throughout all its po&s;|&s;ible
Divi&s;ions, &s;eems to offer faire&s;t,
of any internal Medicine, for breaking
the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts; for relaxing the <HI>Fibres;</HI>
and enlarging the Capacities of the &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els. And the Fact is, that by a
full and free Salivation. <HI>Gouty</HI> People
<PB N="21" REF="35">
have been freed from all its Symptoms
for &s;everal Years. But it is al&s;o Matter
of Fact, and Experience, that a full and
free Salivation does &s;o break, rend and
tear all the &s;malle&s;t, tendere&s;t and fine&s;t
Ve&s;&s;els and <HI>Fibres,</HI> that the Body be|comes
in a wor&s;e State, in re&s;pect of the
future Fits, than it would have been in
&s;everal Years time, under the common
Symptoms. For tho' a Salivation may
open all the Ob&s;tructions of the &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els; clean&s;e their in&s;ides from the
Foulne&s;s that cleaves to them; purify
the Blood, and break its &s;aline Impuri|ties;
yet by its great Weight, and the
exce&s;&s;ive Force it adds to the Blood,
rending and tearing the fine&s;t Ve&s;&s;els and
<HI>Fibres;</HI> when the <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on comes
to his former Diet, and the other Cir|cum&s;tances
of living; and the Fluids
become thereby loaded with their Salts,
they &s;tick more ob&s;tinately to the Joints,
than if the Parts had been &s;ubdu'd and
broken by regular Fits of the <HI>Gout.</HI> So
that a Salivation, tho' it bani&s;h the Fits
<PB N="22" REF="36">
for &s;ome time, yet when the Blood is
repleni&s;h'd again with <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, the
Habit is reduc'd to a wor&s;e Condition,
in re&s;pect of the future Fits, than if they
had never been interrupted: And, in|deed,
it is ob&s;ervable, that after a full,
or repeated Salivations, the Man is &s;el|dom
or ever the &s;ame, as to the Quick|ne&s;s
of Sen&s;ation; or the U&s;age of the
mo&s;t beautiful animal Faculties. But
there is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of hav|ing
recour&s;e to <HI>Mercurial</HI> Vomits and
Purges, when the <HI>Gout</HI> becomes fixt
to, and permanent in a Place, as al&s;o
when it is di&s;per&s;ed all over the Habit,
like a Rheumati&s;m. The&s;e active Me|dicines
mu&s;t fir&s;t render the Humours
fluid, which <HI>Gum Guajac</HI> with Dia|phoretick
<HI>Antimony</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in will af|terwards
carry off. I come now to
con&s;ider the <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on under two
different Circum&s;tances. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> under
a regular Fit. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> in the
Intervals.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="37">
XVIII. 1. On the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Attack of the
Fit, e&s;pecially while the Fever, that
u&s;hers it in, remains, Dilution is the
only Remedy. Fine, clear, old &s;mall
Beer, with a little old Mountain, or
<HI>Madera</HI> Wine; Water boil'd with a few
Spicy Seeds, mix'd with the&s;e Wines:
Water Gruel with &s;ome Wine, or Hart&s;|horn-Drink
with Cinnamon; and little
or no Fle&s;h Meat, will &s;ucceed be&s;t dur|ing
all the time of the Fever. After
the Fit is di&s;tinctly form'd, the milder
Cordial and Stomachick Medicines,
which promote a gentle Breathing Sweat
(I mean in the more compounded and
tedious Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> chiefly in Per|&s;ons

&s;uch a Method, and &s;uch Medicines, I

them down, will fini&s;h this Affair,
&s;trengthen the Bowels, and prevent the
Recoil of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour on them.
And here it may be taken Notice of,
that as the Fever, that u&s;hers in the
<HI>Gout,</HI> is, &s;o will the Fit be: If the Fe|ver
is &s;hort and &s;harp, the Fit will be
&s;o likewi&s;e, in regular <HI>Gouts:</HI> If it be
feeble, long and lingering, the Fit will
be &s;uch al&s;o. In the Management of
the foregoing Method and Medicines,
two Cautions are to be minded: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
That during the whole Fit, Liquors
may be more freely and &s;afely indulg'd,
than &s;olid Foods. For Repletion from
<PB N="25" REF="39">
&s;olid Foods, in a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> might
be of fatal Con&s;equence, by rendering
a regular Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> irregular:
Whereas Fluids will certainly pa&s;s, ei|ther
by Per&s;piration, Sweating, or U|rine.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> The Cordial Medicines
are always to be regulated, by their
Lightne&s;s on, and Agreeablene&s;s to the
Stomach of the Patient; (for whatever
makes him &s;ick, will more or le&s;s draw
in the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour on the Stomach)
and by their not rendering him more
hot and re&s;tle&s;s, than the <HI>Gout</HI> it &s;elf
wou'd naturally make him: For if they
produce an agreeable Sen&s;ation on the
Stomach, and do not inflame, they
will nece&s;&s;arily procure Coolne&s;s and
Quiet.</P>
<P>XIX. Here it may be con&s;ider'd,
whether <HI>Opiats</HI> may be &s;afely given in a
Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> to procure Re&s;t, and
alleviate Pain. In the general, it is
the &s;afe&s;t &s;ide, not to admini&s;ter any
kind of <HI>Opiats</HI> in the Fits; becau&s;e they
<PB N="26" REF="40">
con&s;tantly pall the Appetite, and leave
a Nau&s;eating, and perhaps a Reaching
on the Stomach, the readie&s;t way to
bring the <HI>Gout</HI> there. But in Extremi|ties,
when the Patient has been many
Days without Re&s;t, and the Pain be|comes
intolerable, all other Means fail|ing,
or equally dangerous, <HI>Opiats</HI> may
be &s;o qualify'd, and their mi&s;chievous
Effects &s;o bridl'd, by joining &s;picy, ner|vous
and Stomach Medicines to them,
that they may become an excellent Re|medy.
Thus liquid <HI>Laudanum,</HI> with
Tincture of <HI>Ca&s;tor,</HI> of Snakeweed, of
<HI>Diambra,</HI> of Saffron, <HI>Sal Volatile,</HI> Com|pound
Spirit of Lavender, Hy&s;terick
Water, and &s;ome agreeable Simple Wa|ter;
&s;ome of the&s;e mix'd in a due Pro|portion,
and proper Do&s;e, will not on|ly
procure Re&s;t, and ea&s;e Pain, but
an&s;wer all the other Intentions in the
Cure of a Fit of the <HI>Gout.</HI> Thus al&s;o,
<HI>London Laudanum,</HI> with old <HI>Venice</HI>
Treacle, or <HI>Mythridate,</HI> Serpentary
Root, and un&s;cented Species of <HI>Diam|bra,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="41">
made into a <HI>Bolus,</HI> with any agree|able
Syrup, and caution'd, as before,
will produce the &s;ame Effect.</P>
<P>XX. As &s;oon as the Pain is almo&s;t
gone, and the Swelling and Weakne&s;s
only remain, nothing will more quick|en
and fini&s;h the Cure, and &s;trengthen
the weaken'd Parts, than gentle, warm,
&s;tomachick and &s;picy Purgers, dos'd
and repeated according to the Strength
of the Patient; by carrying out of the
Habit, the more gro&s;s and unper&s;pira|ble
Remains of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour. This
premis'd, e&s;pecially after long and &s;e|vere
Fits, which have impair'd the
Strength, and wa&s;ted the Mu&s;cular Fle&s;h;
I &s;hould advi&s;e A&s;&s;e's Milk with Pearl,
half a Pint, or a Pint, in the Morn|ing
early, and five or &s;ix a Clock in
the Afternoon; to lengthen out the
Morning Sleep, to pulp up the exhau&s;t|ed
Mu&s;cles, to cool and refre&s;h the
parch'd <HI>Fibres,</HI> and keep the Body &s;o|luble;
which A&s;&s;e's Milk commonly
does. And to keep up the Appetite,
<PB N="28" REF="42">
which the Milk commonly palls, and
to prevent its too cooling Effects on the
Stomach, a light bitter made of Gen|tian,
Cinnamon, and Orange Peel on|ly,
the la&s;t double of the other two, in|fus'd
on Sherry or White-Wine, and
taken two Hours before Meals, may be
us'd mo&s;t conveniently. This Cour&s;e
might be continu'd for two or three
Weeks: After which I &s;hou'd order a
Cour&s;e of <HI>Bath</HI> or <HI>German Spaw</HI> Waters,
with Steel, riding, a light White-food
Diet, and generous Wines drunk tem|perately.</P>
<P>XXI. It is in the Intervals of the Fits
that any thing great or probable is to
be undertaken for the Relief or Cure of
the <HI>Gouty.</HI> The Methods, both gene|ral
and particular, I have touch'd upon.
I come now to recommend &s;ome &s;pe|cial
Medicines, which have been found
u&s;eful in this Ca&s;e. It is certain that
great Ab&s;tinence from Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and
Wines, would prevent the Fluids from
being overloaded with <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts. It
<PB N="29" REF="43">
is al&s;o certain, that if the Food be
carry'd out before it is dige&s;ted, it
will be pretty near the &s;ame thing, as
if the Quantity carry'd out, had not
been taken down. Now if a Medicine
can be found, that without weakening
the Stomach and Bowels, &s;hall carry
off the greater part of the Food, be|fore
it is quite rob'd of its Salts, it
can't fail to be of great U&s;e in the In|tervals
of the <HI>Gout.</HI> For this purpo&s;e,
I wou'd recommend fine Rhubarb, taken
regularly once, twice, or oftner a Week,
in &s;uch a Do&s;e, as to procure two or
three Motions: For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
Becau&s;e it is an excellent Stomach Bit|ter,
as is evident from its Ta&s;te, and
from the &s;harp Appetite it gives tho&s;e
that take it frequently. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Be|cau&s;e
it is one of the noble&s;t A&s;tringents
hitherto known, as is evident from its
Cure of Fluxes, and inte&s;tine <HI>Haemor|rhages;</HI>
and from the Tightne&s;s it leaves
on the Bowels. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Becau&s;e it re|quires
neither Diet, nor keeping warm,
nor any other particular Management;
<PB N="30" REF="44">
and yet taken frequently and regularly,
it will carry off any Proportion of the
Food one plea&s;es; and &s;o reduce the
Diet, as near as needs be, to <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s,
which, in Article XIII, has been &s;hewn
to be of &s;o excellent U&s;e in the <HI>Gout.</HI>
I knew a Noble Lord, of great Worth,
and much <HI>Gout,</HI> who, by taking from
the Hands of a Quack, a Dram of Rhu|barb,
ting'd with <HI>Cochineal</HI> to di&s;gui&s;e
it, every Morning for the Space of &s;ix
Weeks, liv'd in Health for four Years
after, without any Symptom of it.</P>
<P>XXII. It is worth here taking Notice,
that all the Preparations of this Medi|cine
&s;erve only to &s;poil it: And that it
is be&s;t taken in a &s;poonful of Soup, or
any other agreeable Liquor, immedi|ately
before Dinner, or chew'd in a
Morning fa&s;ting. But to tho&s;e to whom
its Mawki&s;hne&s;s is nau&s;eous, I wou'd
recommend this Form. <HI>Take</HI> Gentian
<HI>and</HI> Zedoary <HI>of each a Dram,</HI> Serpen|tary
<HI>Root, and un&s;cented Species of</HI>
Diambra, <HI>of each half a Dram;</HI> Co|chineal
<PB N="31" REF="45">
<HI>and</HI> Saffron <HI>of each a Scruple;</HI>
Orange Peel <HI>an Ounce; infu&s;e in a Quart
of Mountain, in a warm place twenty
four Hours, &s;train, and to the Liquor
add three Ounces of the be&s;t</HI> Rhubarb;
Salt of Wormwood <HI>a Dram and an half;
&s;et in a warm Sand heat twelve Hours;
and then &s;train a &s;econd time.</HI> Of this
four Spoonfuls every Night, or every
other Night, as occa&s;ion requir'd, I
have found an excellent Remedy in this
and other Chronical Ca&s;es. Where no
Preparations of Rhubarb will agree with
the Con&s;titution, as there are many
&s;uch, then <HI>Elixir Salutis,</HI> Tincture of
<HI>Hiera Picra;</HI> a Solution of <HI>Gum Guajac,</HI>
or the <HI>Scotch</HI> Pills, might take place;
but that all the Preparations of <HI>Aloes</HI> are
apt to throw out both <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Piles.</HI>
However in this matter there is great
Variety; out of which every one may
fit them&s;elves with what is mo&s;t agree|able
to their own Con&s;titution; which
if they u&s;e regularly and frequently,
they cannot fail to prevent violent
Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and perhaps mo&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="46">
other, both Acute and Chronical Di|&s;tempers.</P>
<P>XXIII. Next to Rhubarb, and all
Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd, even far be|fore
it, I would recommend <HI>Sulphur,</HI>
as one of the be&s;t Remedies in the In|tervals
of the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is but in little
U&s;e at pre&s;ent in Phy&s;ick, except in the
<HI>Itch,</HI> and the <HI>Piles;</HI> and yet in the
whole Extent of the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI>
I know not a more &s;afe and more active
Medicine. Its wonderful Efficacy, and
particular manner of Operating in the&s;e
common Ca&s;es, might, I think, have
encourag'd its Trial in other Chronical
Ca&s;es, e&s;pecially con&s;idering the Faci|lity
of its Working, and the little Trou|ble
it gives in taking it. Its principal
Qualities are the&s;e. 1. The Parts of
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> and tho&s;e of Light and Fire,
act mutually upon one another, more
powerfully than tho&s;e of other Bodies.
It is to their <HI>Sulphur</HI> that Bodies owe
reflecting and refracting Virtues; from
whence its Inflammability proceeds.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="47">
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Sir</HI> I&s;aac Newton'<HI>s Treati&s;e of Light and Co|lours,</HI>
1 <HI>Edit. in</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>towards the end.</HI></NOTE> The Particles of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies re|ceive
and retain tho&s;e of Light and Fire,
more &s;trongly than any other Bodies:
And the Rays of Light and Particles of
Fire, &s;eparate, move and turn the Parts
of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies into Fire and Flame.
2. The Parts of <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies are
very &s;mall, even &s;maller than tho&s;e of
Water it &s;elf, whereby it comes to pa&s;s
that they will enter tho&s;e &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els,
where Water it &s;elf (our be&s;t and mo&s;t
univer&s;al Diluent) can't come; this is
evident from hence, that Water will not
di&s;&s;olve <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and that no Moi&s;ture
will &s;tick to fat Sub&s;tances, or the Fea|thers
of Water Fowl: As al&s;o from its
Cure of all cutaneous Foulne&s;s; which
it cou'd never effectuate but by entering
all tho&s;e &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els. which &s;carce
any other Medicine can enter. And
<HI>la&s;tly,</HI> by its di&s;&s;olving the &s;izy Juices
of the &s;malle&s;t internal <HI>Glands,</HI> when
ob&s;tructed; particularly tho&s;e of the
<PB N="34" REF="48">
<HI>Lungs, Me&s;entery</HI> and <HI>Rectum;</HI> as in
the humorous <HI>A&s;thma, Scrophula</HI> and
<HI>Piles.</HI> 3. <HI>Sulphurous</HI> Bodies will readi|ly
unite with, and de&s;troy the Effects
of all <HI>Saline</HI> Particles, but e&s;pecially
tho&s;e of the acid kind. And in this
their great Energy &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t.
<HI>Sulphur</HI> yields the mo&s;t piercing, active,
and agreeable <HI>Acid</HI> in the World; &s;uch
as Spirit of <HI>Sulphur, Gas</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and
the like. 4. The fat and oily Parts of
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> like other fat and unctuous
Bodies, are the lighte&s;t, the mo&s;t co|herent,
and the mo&s;t &s;pringy of all Bo|dies.
The&s;e two la&s;t Qualities are mo&s;t
manife&s;t from the artificial <HI>Sulphur</HI> made
of Oyl of Turpentine and Spirit of <HI>Vi|triol</HI>
(the &s;tronge&s;t Glew, and the mo&s;t
penetrating Acid) duly dige&s;ted and
carefully manag'd, which in all re&s;pects
is the &s;ame with natural <HI>Sulphur.</HI> &startq;No
Body denies&endq; (&s;ays <HI>Tournfort</HI> in his
Voyage to the <HI>Levant,</HI> Pag. 122. Part I.
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Edit.) &startq;that <HI>Sulphur</HI> is only a
fat Sub&s;tance, fix'd by an acid Spirit:
<PB N="35" REF="49">
The <HI>Sulphur</HI> which is artificially
made, and the <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> of common
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> put this Truth out of all
Di&s;pute. For the Sea Water being
fat by the Oil of the Sea Fi&s;h conti|nually
corrupting there, and bitter
and &s;alti&s;h from its &s;aline Rocks,
produces in proper Ne&s;ts natural <HI>Sul|phur.</HI>&endq;
And Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> &s;ays, in
his la&s;t Edition of his Opticks, <HI>pag.</HI> 359.
&startq;By di&s;&s;olving Flower of Brim&s;tone
in Oil of Turpentine, and di&s;tilling
the Solution, it is found, that <HI>Sul|phur</HI>
is compos'd of an inflammable
thick Oil, or fat <HI>Bitumen,</HI> an acid
Salt, a very thick Earth, and a little
Metal: The three fir&s;t were found
not much unequal to one another;
the fourth in &s;o &s;mall a Quantity, as
&s;carce to be worth the con&s;idering.&endq;
Join all the&s;e Qualities together, and
you have one of the mo&s;t admirable Re|medies
in the World, for all Intentions
in the Cure of the <HI>Gout:</HI> By its agree|able
Ta&s;te and Lightne&s;s on the Sto|mach,
<PB N="36" REF="50">
(e&s;pecially when wa&s;h'd down
with any milky Vehicle) its Tenacity,
Ropine&s;s and Ela&s;ticity; the Smallne&s;s
of its Parts; their Efficacy in de&s;troy|ing
the Mi&s;chief of all &s;aline Particles,
with their natural Warmth, join'd to
the Activity of its acid Salt, (making it
a kind of natural Soap) it enters the
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, where no other Diluent,
hitherto known, can come; clean&s;es
their in&s;ides from the Foulne&s;s that &s;ticks
to them; imbibes and retains all the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, and carries them out of the
Body by Per&s;piration; &s;oftens, &s;mooths
and relaxes the parch'd and &s;tiffen'd <HI>Fi|bres;</HI>
and by leaving &s;ome of its oily
Parts on their Surfaces, &s;heaths and de|fends
them from the Points of the Salts
afterwards introduc'd. And the Fact
is, from repeated Trials I can recom|mend
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> as a mo&s;t powerful Re|medy
in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> For
I have known half a Dram of pow|der'd
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> or Flowers of Brim&s;tone,
taken regularly twice a Day in a Spoon|ful
<PB N="37" REF="51">
of Milk, prevent the Fit for many
Years; and le&s;&s;en both its Pain and Du|ration
when it happen'd: For it mov'd
the Body gently once or twice a Day.
I have in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion Te&s;timonies
under the Hands of &s;ome treated and
tended by my &s;elf; and of others of un|doubted
Credit, witne&s;&s;ing to the great
Succe&s;s of this Medicine in the Intervals
of the <HI>Gout.</HI> Nothing hitherto di&s;co|ver'd,
I believe, equals it ob&s;tinately
per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>XXIV. E&s;pecially if to the&s;e be ad|ded
plentiful Dilution by &s;ome Blood
warm Infu&s;ion of a &s;picy and diuretick
Plant in Water, &s;o as to provoke a
gentle Breathing Sweat, and pa&s;s free|ly
by Urine. Thus large Draughts of
Sage, Dwarf-Elder, Buckbean, or Green
Tea; but e&s;pecially of weak Whey made
on old Mountain, drunk Blood warm,
and on an empty Stomach, and join'd
to any of the now mention'd Medicines,
will be of great Advantage in the In|tervals
<PB N="38" REF="52">
of the <HI>Gout;</HI> by diluting and
breaking its Salts, and carrying them off
by Per&s;piration and Urine. And certain|ly
<HI>Ro&s;elli</HI>'s Drops, (perhaps the <HI>Tinctura
Metallorum</HI> &s;omehow alter'd) which were
&s;aid to work gently by Stool and Sweat,
in the Hands of a prudent and knowing
Phy&s;ician, had been an admirable Re|medy,
as an&s;wering both the Intentions
mention'd, in the Intervals of the Fits;
and even in the Fits them&s;elves, it had
not been without its U&s;e (always ex|cepting
the <HI>Vernal</HI> and <HI>Autumnal</HI> regu|lar
Fits) had he dealt with recent <HI>Gouts,</HI>
and firm Con&s;titutions only. That
which I wou'd particularly recommend
here, is, a weak Decoction of the
<HI>BARK</HI> of <HI>Sar&s;a</HI> Root (in the <HI>BARK</HI>
the Virtues of the Plants chiefly con|&s;i&s;t:
For being repleni&s;h'd with mo&s;t
part of, if not all the Juice-circulating
Ve&s;&s;els, it contains all its Salts and
mo&s;t active Parts; and being Spungy
and Tender, it is thereby more ea&s;ily
dige&s;ted: And where Roots are mo&s;t
<PB N="39" REF="53">
in U&s;e, the <HI>Bark</HI> of the Root is more
eminently u&s;eful, for the Rea&s;ons a&s;|&s;ign'd:
As al&s;o becau&s;e, towards the
End of the <HI>Autumn,</HI> when Roots are
gather'd, the Cold has already driven
the Juices into their <HI>Bark.</HI> And this
may be one Rea&s;on why the famous
Pox-Doctor &s;ucceeds in &s;ome Ca&s;es,
when mi&s;manag'd <HI>Mercurial</HI> Treat|ments
have fail'd: His Diet-Drink
chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of a Decoction of the
Bark of this Root: His Pill is <HI>Mercu|rial,</HI>
perhaps the <HI>Arcanum Corallinum,</HI>
or <HI>Panacaea,</HI> and the&s;e two per&s;i&s;ted in
for &s;o long a time, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
&s;weeten the tainted Juices, and expel
the entangl'd and gro&s;&s;er <HI>Mercurial</HI>
Parts, which clu&s;tering together, cou'd
not perform the Circulation, but were
retain'd within the Habit, by former
mi&s;manag'd Salivations, and thereby
render'd ineffectual to the Cure; e&s;pe|cially,
if to the&s;e be added, the low
and &s;tarving Diet he pre&s;cribes. For
I have heard of a famous Sea-Com|mander,
<PB N="40" REF="54">
who effectually cur'd the fir&s;t
Stages of <HI>Venereal</HI> Di&s;tempers by living
twenty Days on <HI>Water Gruel</HI> only, in
which a little <HI>Cream</HI> of <HI>Tartar</HI> had been
fir&s;t di&s;&s;olv'd; and higher Degrees of
the &s;ame by the like Diet continu'd twice
the Time;) with a little Milk, drunk
freely Blood warm every Morning,
which I have known wonderfully relieve
<HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;ons, when drunk all the Win|ter
between the <HI>Cardinal</HI> Fits. And
even Cow's Milk warm, taken for Break|fa&s;t
and Supper, has been of great Ser|vice
to tho&s;e <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;ons who drink
not much Wine; for tho&s;e who drink
Wine freely, have too hot and &s;our Sto|machs
to deal in Milk.</P>
<P>XXV. Even drinking freely of light,
clear Spring Water after full Meals, and
indulging in &s;trong Liquors, will be
found of great U&s;e in the Intervals of
the <HI>Gout.</HI> It is well known that warm
Water alone, drunk in a Morning fa&s;t|ing
freely, and at Meals, from its Heat,
<PB N="41" REF="55">
its Dilution, and clean&s;ing Qualities,
has been a &s;overeign Remedy in re&s;tor|ing
decay'd Appetites, and &s;trengthning
weak Dige&s;tions, when other more pom|pous
Medicines have fail'd. <HI>Lower</HI> ve|ry
ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that Per&s;ons that
have drunk beyond the Rules of Tem|perance,
may be much reliev'd from
the ill Effects of it, by expo&s;ing them|&s;elves
to the free Air, to cool the Blood,
and to force off the Liquors by Urine.
I'm of Opinion, were there neither Sin
nor Shame in it, as there are eminent|ly
both, a <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on ought to avoid
Intemperance, as he wou'd avoid the
Bite of a Snake or mad Dog. But &s;ince
&s;uch Accidents do happen, let the <HI>Gou|ty</HI>
Per&s;on, after the Exce&s;s either in
Meat or Drink, &s;will down as much fair
Water as his Stomach will bear, before
he go to Bed; whereby he'll reap the&s;e
Advantages: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Either the Contents
of the Stomach will be thrown upwards,
and he freed from a great part of the
Load. Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Both Meat and
<PB N="42" REF="56">
Drink will be much diluted; and the
Labour and Expence of Spirits in Di|ge&s;tion
much &s;av'd. And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Salts will thereby be di&s;&s;olv'd and
di&s;tanc'd from one another; and &s;o be
more readily carry'd off by the free
Per&s;piration, Sweating and Urine which
en&s;ue.</P>
<P>XXVI. But beyond all other
things, a well order'd Cour&s;e of
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters, with <HI>Chalybeats</HI> and warm
Bitters, and a frequent and regular
U&s;e of Stomach Purgers will be found
to &s;ucceed be&s;t in <HI>Gouty,</HI> as well as other
Chronical Ca&s;es. The Learn'd have
been divided, and much perplex'd a|bout
the Heat of <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. I have
always endeavour'd to account to my
&s;elf for it, from the common Experi|ment
of mixing filings of <HI>Steel,</HI> and
Powder of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> working them into
a Pa&s;te with Water, and putting them
into a Cellar, under a Cock, droping
Water &s;lowly and regularly; the Pa&s;te
<PB N="43" REF="57">
will ferment to &s;uch a degree, that the
Water running from it &s;hall be of the
&s;ame Heat and Virtue with the <HI>Bath</HI> Wa|ters;
tho' not &s;o plea&s;ant, nor &s;o well
fitted to human Bodies. This is a com|mon
Experiment, and the&s;e are the on|ly
natural Bodies known, which meet|ing
together will produce Heat in Wa|ter,
without artificial Fires. <HI>Tournfort,</HI>
in the Place before mention'd, &s;ays,
&startq;It's certain that filings of Iron &s;teep'd
in common Water will grow con&s;i|derably
warm, and much more &s;o in
Sea Water: And if you mingle there|with
&s;ome <HI>Sulphur</HI> powder'd, you'll
&s;ee this Mixture really burn.&endq; Sir
<HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> in his la&s;t Edition of his
Opticks, <HI>page</HI> 354, &s;ays, &startq;That e|ven
the gro&s;s Body of <HI>Sulphur</HI> pow|der'd,
and with an equal Weight
of Iron filings, and a little Wa|ter
made into a Pa&s;te, acts up|on
the Iron; and in five or &s;ix
Hours grows too hot to be touch'd,
and emits a Flame.&endq; That the Heat
<PB N="44" REF="58">
of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters is owing to a Prin|ciple
within them&s;elves, is evident, from
their retaining it longer than any other
Water, heated to the &s;ame Degree, will.
Wherefore there can be no Nece&s;&s;ity of
having recour&s;e to <HI>Vulcano</HI>'s or &s;ubter|raneous
Fires, to account for this Ap|pearance.
There are no burning Moun|tains
known in this our <HI>Northern</HI> Cli|mate;
and 'tis pretty hard to conceive,
how Fires &s;hou'd have burn'd &s;o long
under Ground without a Vent, or any
other remarkable Sign. The <HI>Sulphur</HI>
in the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters is evident to the
Sen&s;es, &s;wimming in large Clu&s;ters on
the Tops of the <HI>Baths</HI> mix'd with Earth,
and &s;ome vegetable Sub&s;tances, where|with
the Guides commonly gild Silver:
and is found an excellent Remedy in
<HI>Scurvies, Lepro&s;ies, Ringworms,</HI> and
other <HI>Foulne&s;&s;es</HI> of the Skin. The Steel
is manife&s;ted by the blewi&s;h Tincture
given to the Water from the Pump, by
an Infu&s;ion of Nut-gall. It is true, this
Tincture is neither &s;o deep, nor is it
to be had from the Water, in any &s;hort
<PB N="45" REF="59">
time after it comes hot from the Pump,
thereby to manife&s;t any great Quantity
of Steel in the Compo&s;ition, &s;uch as
can have the full Proportion to the Ex|periment
now mention'd. But, to &s;et
this in a clearer Light, let us put toge|ther
the&s;e Con&s;iderations. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That
upon Di&s;tillation of <HI>Bath</HI> Water, there
remains little in the Bottom of the Gla&s;s
but the common <HI>Calx</HI> or Sea Salt, that
is found in the Di&s;tillation of Spring
Water, if we except &s;ome Sand or Earth,
that is forc'd up by the Violence of the
Pump; wherefore the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters not
being impregnated with any Quantity
of a &s;aline Mixture, can retain nothing
in their own proper Sub&s;tance but the
lighte&s;t Parts of the Steel and <HI>Sulphur.
Secondly,</HI> That this Water is as fully
impregnated with <HI>Sulphur,</HI> as it can bear,
has been already &s;hewn: And that there
mu&s;t be a greater Proportion of Steel in
<HI>Bath</HI> Water than is manife&s;ted to the
Sen&s;es, or di&s;cover'd by any Experi|ment
hitherto made, is evident from
its healing Effects, which no known
<PB N="46" REF="60">
Medicine but Steel can bring about, or
account for: None but tho&s;e who have
&s;een it, can believe the wonderful Effi|cacy
it has, in mo&s;t Chronical Ca&s;es.
What, but Steel, in a few Weeks, can
make the Blood, from a white blewi&s;h
or tallow Hue, re&s;i&s;ting the Knife, like
Glew, &s;wimming in its <HI>Serum,</HI> like an
I&s;land amid&s;t the Ocean, look all of a
Piece, of a Scarlet Colour, and a due
Proportion between its nouri&s;hing and
its watery Parts. Nothing but Steel
can make a pale a&s;h-colour'd Counte|nance,
hollow and deep Eyes, no Ap|petite,
little Strength, and le&s;s Sleep;
eat, and drink, and &s;leep, look gay and
&s;leek, like the be&s;t Health. Thou&s;ands
of &s;uch In&s;tances may be &s;een every Sea|&s;on
at the&s;e healthful Springs. <HI>Third|ly,</HI>
The Effects of <HI>Sulphur</HI> in bridling
the &s;en&s;ible Appearances and Operations
of mo&s;t active Medicines, is very well
known. In&s;tances of which, in natu|ral
Bodies, are, <HI>Antimony</HI> and native
<HI>Cinnabar;</HI> in artificial ones, <HI>Aethiops</HI>
Mineral, and <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of <HI>Antimony:</HI> In
<PB N="47" REF="61">
all which the <HI>Mercury</HI> is &s;o bridl'd up
by the <HI>Sulphur,</HI> that none of their &s;en|&s;ible
Operations and Appearances are
felt, while they produce the mo&s;t won|derful
Changes on animal Bodies. I
cannot pa&s;s over <HI>Aethiops</HI> Mineral with|out
pre&s;&s;ing its more univer&s;al U&s;e than,
for ought I know, it has yet had in
common Practice. It is one of the mo&s;t
certain and univer&s;al Alteratives, if dos'd
&s;ufficiently and long enough per&s;i&s;ted
in, of all the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;atory.</HI> It radical|ly
extirpates the Itch, the Piles, &s;cor|butick
and &s;crophulous Ulcers; all cu|taneous
Foulne&s;&s;es; all Inflammations
and Fluxions of the Eyes; all internal
Ulcers, Rheumati&s;ms, white Swellings;
&s;harp Humours in the Stomach and Guts,
and almo&s;t all Di&s;tempers ari&s;ing from
&s;izy Juices. I &s;ay, it cures the&s;e, if Art
can do it; for &s;ome of the&s;e (like he|reditary
<HI>Gouts</HI>) are &s;o tran&s;ub&s;tantiated
into the Solids, that nothing but a new
Conformation of Parts can cure them.
It may be given almo&s;t to half an Ounce
a Day, e&s;pecially with inter&s;pers'd <HI>Mer|curial</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="62">
Purges, without Trouble, or any
&s;en&s;ible Operation, and continu'd for a
Twelve-month, if one plea&s;es. The
fine&s;t <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and fitte&s;t to make <HI>Aethi|ops</HI>
of, is common <HI>Sulphur</HI> pouder'd,
and boiled &s;even or eight times in Spring
Water, whereby it becomes as light on
the Stomach as prepared Peach, and as
effectual in the Ca&s;es mentioned, as
the celebrated <HI>Sulphur</HI> of <HI>Aix la Chap|pelle</HI>
Waters. But to return to the Bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>XXVII. The &s;um of all then is, &s;ince
the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters derive their Heat from
a Principle within them&s;elves; &s;ince no
natural Body, but <HI>Sulphur</HI> and Iron can
produce &s;uch a Degree of Heat, as is in
them; &s;ince nothing but Steel can pro|duce
tho&s;e wonderful Cures on human
Bodies, which <HI>Bath</HI> Waters do; &s;ince
<HI>Sulphur</HI> will lock up and bridle the &s;en|&s;ible
Appearances and Effects of the mo&s;t
active Bodies, and yet not de&s;troy their
healthful and medical Virtues; it is
plain, that <HI>Bath</HI> Waters mu&s;t owe their
<PB N="49" REF="63">
Heat to a Mixture of &s;teely and &s;ulphu|rous
Particles; and their healthful Ef|fects,
to a greater Proportion of Steel,
than is &s;en&s;ible, or ea&s;ily di&s;coverable by
any Experiment hitherto made, join'd
to a light <HI>Sulphur,</HI> who&s;e Virtues and
Efficacy in all Chronical Ca&s;es, we have
already &s;hewn. The Mountains which
&s;urround the Place, which every Body
now knows, to be but the Ne&s;ts of Mi|nerals,
and the Receptacles of the Wa|ters,
which feed the Springs, (which
Mountains are continu'd even to the Sea)
confirm this Opinion. The manner
I conceive thus: The Dews drilling and
droping through the Cranies of the
Mountains, fall upon a Bed of Iron Oar,
and are there as fully impregnated with
<HI>Chalybeat</HI> Particles as &s;uch Water can
bear; and gently owzing down upon a
Ne&s;t of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and there fermenting
to &s;uch a Degree, that requiring more
room, they bubble up at the Foot of the
Mountains, with their &s;ulphurous Spoils,
and furni&s;h out this healing and bal&s;a|mick
Fluid. All hot Waters &s;eem chief|ly
<PB N="50" REF="64">
to con&s;i&s;t of the&s;e two Principles; and
to differ only as the <HI>Sulphur</HI> or <HI>Steel</HI>
predominates in them. Where the <HI>Sul|phur</HI>
predominates, they are hotter, more
nau&s;eous, and more purgative. Of the
three hot <HI>European</HI> Waters of Note, the
<HI>Aix la Chapelle, Bourbon,</HI> and <HI>Bath;</HI>
the fir&s;t abounds more eminently in
<HI>Sulphur,</HI> which makes its Heat, Nau|&s;eou&s;ne&s;s
and Purgative Faculty &s;o great,
that few weak Stomachs can bear its
Heat and Nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s; and fewer weak
Con&s;titutions, the Violence of its Purg|ing.
The <HI>Bourbon</HI> are of a middle Nature,
between the <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI> and the <HI>Bath</HI>
Waters, and are le&s;s hot, nau&s;eous and
purgative than the <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> but
more than the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters. The <HI>Bath</HI>
partake le&s;s of the <HI>Sulphur</HI> and more of
the <HI>Steel</HI> than either of the&s;e two; and
are by far the mo&s;t plea&s;ant; of a milky
Ta&s;te, never purge, except they be
drunk either too fa&s;t, or in too great
Quantities, and always mend the Ap|petite,
and rai&s;e the Spirits. The weak|e&s;t
hot Waters are but of little U&s;e, ex|cept
<PB N="51" REF="65">
in the lowe&s;t Ca&s;es, and hectick
or con&s;umptive Con&s;titutions; but for
Medical U&s;es, the weaker hot Waters
may be made pretty near equal to the
&s;tronger by Evaporation, as to the &s;ul|phurous
Principle; as the &s;tronger may
be brought down to the weaker by Di|lution,
as I have experienc'd; tho' Na|ture
be always the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t per|fect
Operator. But neither the &s;ame
Proportion of <HI>Steel,</HI> nor <HI>Sulphur,</HI> nor
Heat, indifferently fit all Con&s;titutions.
Generally the Strength (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Quan|tity
of <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Sulphur</HI>) of the &s;ame
hot Waters is in proportion to their
Heat; and therefore to fit the &s;ame Wa|ters
to weaker Con&s;titutions, they need
only be drunk proportionably cooler.</P>
<P>XXVIII. The <HI>Bath</HI> Waters having
&s;uch an Origin, and &s;uch Qualities,
mu&s;t needs be an excellent Remedy in
the <HI>Gout,</HI> and other Chronical Ca&s;es,
for the&s;e Rea&s;ons; 1. Becau&s;e of their
Warmth, ju&s;t &s;uited to the Wants of
Nature, and a little above the Heat of
<PB N="52" REF="66">
human Bodies, &s;ufficient to introduce
a foreign Warmth and Motion to cold
and decay'd Bowels and Fluids; whereby
the natural Warmth and &s;low Circulati|on
is increas'd and enliven'd. 2. This,
with its agreeable Ta&s;te and milky Soft|ne&s;s,
makes it &s;it &s;o ea&s;ily on the Sto|mach,
and become &s;o excellent a Vehi|cle,
to wa&s;h into the Blood other pro|per
and &s;pecifick Medicines, without
that Nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s and Fret on the Spi|rits,
which all other hot Waters, hitherto
known; or that Chillyne&s;s and Damp,
which all cold Mineral Waters, give:
whereby they are render'd u&s;ele&s;s or
hurtful in &s;ome low and nervous Ca&s;es.
To the&s;e add, 3. Their <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Prin|ciple,
&s;o peculiarly lock'd up in <HI>Sul|phur,</HI>
that the Patient reaps all the Be|nefit
and healthful Effects of the be&s;t
Preparations of this Medicine (and what
are not two &s;uch powerful Medicines
combin'd able to effect?) without the
nau&s;eous Ta&s;te, and frequent Di&s;orders
upon the Stomach, that every other
way of giving <HI>Steel</HI> produces. 4. The
<PB N="53" REF="67">
<HI>Sulphur</HI> united with the <HI>Steel,</HI> makes it
a natural kind of Soap, for clean&s;ing
the in&s;ides of the Ve&s;&s;els from the Foul|ne&s;s
that cleaves to them; and for open|ing
the Ob&s;tructions of the &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els.
But 5. That which, together
with the others, makes it &s;pecifick in
the <HI>Gout,</HI> is, its relaxing Quality, where|by
it &s;oftens and &s;upples the rigid and
&s;tiff <HI>Fibres,</HI> &s;o as the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humours
may pa&s;s freely by Per&s;piration. Much
more might be &s;aid of this wonderful
Remedy provided by the Hand of Na|ture,
to relieve the Mi&s;eries of human
Life; but this the innumerable Crowds
of Cripples of all &s;orts, and tho&s;e other
Per&s;ons made mi&s;erable by Chronical
Di&s;tempers, &s;ent thence, every Year,
cur'd, or reliev'd, do witne&s;s, more
convincingly than either Philo&s;ophy or
Rhetorick can.</P>
<P>XXIX. I will here remove two Diffi|culties:
The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is, concerning Bath|ing
in the Intervals of the <HI>Gout.</HI> The
only Rea&s;on given for this Difficulty is,
<PB N="54" REF="68">
le&s;t the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour &s;hou'd be driven
inwards upon the Bowels. But this
&s;eems to me a mere groundle&s;s Jealou|&s;y:
For in regular <HI>Gouts,</HI> when the Fit
is over, it is to be &s;uppos'd, that the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Fluid or Matter is mo&s;tly or alto|gether
&s;pent, and the Fluids in a heal|thy
&s;ound Condition. And therefore
it might be as rea&s;onably doubted, if
in the Intervals of two putrid Fevers
(of which many have had more than
two in their Life-time) a Per&s;on might
&s;afely bath. There is no Que&s;tion, but
that a <HI>Gouty</HI> Per&s;on may both as &s;afely
bath, and take any Medicine, for any
incident Di&s;ea&s;e, as any other Per&s;on;
regard being had to his particular Con|&s;titution.
And 'tis Matter of Fact, that
tho&s;e who have been crippl'd by the fix|ing
of the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts upon the Joints, or
di&s;abl'd by the Tenderne&s;s of the Parts,
have been extremely reliev'd by a long
Cour&s;e of Drinking and Bathing in the&s;e
hot Waters, which by relaxing the <HI>Fi|bres,</HI>
di&s;&s;olving the &s;izy Humours, di|luting
the <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts, and making them
<PB N="55" REF="69">
pa&s;s by Per&s;piration, have re&s;tor'd them
to the U&s;e of their Limbs.</P>
<P>XXX. The other Difficulty is, how
the &s;ame hot Water &s;hou'd relax con|tracted
<HI>Fibres,</HI> as in the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Rheu|mati&s;m;</HI>
and yet contract and brace re|lax'd
<HI>Fibres,</HI> as in the Pal&s;y and wa&s;ted
Limbs. That the Matter of Fact is &s;o,
is pa&s;t all Doubt in the&s;e and many other
Ca&s;es of Contraction and Relaxation.
But to clear up this, we need only to
con&s;ider what Contraction and Relaxa|tion
are. Since all the Fluids of the
Body are contain'd in Ve&s;&s;els, Con|traction
can ari&s;e from nothing but
from the Blood and other Fluids (or
whatever is the Cau&s;e of Mu&s;cular Moti|on)
Their being retain'd and ob&s;tructed
by their Sizine&s;s; or from &s;ome external
Injury: in the Sub&s;tance of the Mu&s;cle
it &s;elf; whereby it becomes fuller and
firmer, and &s;o acts as upon its Office of
Contraction. Relaxation, upon the
other hand, is an Ob&s;truction of the
Nerves or Ve&s;&s;els of the Fluids, before
<PB N="56" REF="70">
they arrive at the Mu&s;cles; as is &s;een
in Pal&s;ies and the Nervous <HI>Atrophy</HI> of
the Limbs; &s;o that in both Ca&s;es, Ob|&s;tructions
are the Cau&s;e both of Con|traction
and Relaxation. Wherefore,
whatever Medicine can di&s;&s;olve the Si|zine&s;s
of the Fluids; open the Ob&s;tru|ctions
of the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els; make the
Per&s;piration full and free, and brace
the <HI>Fibres;</HI> will both contract Relaxa|tions,
and relax Contractions: And
that the&s;e are &s;ome of the Effects of
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters, has, I think, been made
&s;ufficiently appear.</P>
<P>XXXI. If it be enquir'd into, what
other Ca&s;es, be&s;ides the <HI>Gout, Bath</HI>
Waters may be u&s;eful in; the An&s;wer
will be obvious from the Account now
laid down; to wit, That they mu&s;t be
beneficial in all Ca&s;es, where <HI>Steel</HI> or
<HI>Sulphur</HI> is; that is, in almo&s;t all Chro|nical
Ca&s;es what&s;oever. In Acute and
Inflammatory Ca&s;es, in all Ca&s;es at|tended
with a &s;trong, quick Pul&s;e, no
<HI>Mineral</HI> Water, nor <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Medicine
<PB N="57" REF="71">
can be proper. But in all other Ca|&s;es
(excepting tho&s;e only attended
with a Bleeding or <HI>Haemorrhage</HI>) they
are not only &s;afe, but exceedingly be|neficial.
More particularly, their won|derful
Efficacy has been often experi|enc'd
in <HI>Cachexies, Scurvies;</HI> in the
<HI>Stone, Rheumati&s;m</HI> and <HI>Jaundice;</HI> in
<HI>Hypocondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;terical</HI> Affecti|ons;
in <HI>Vapours</HI> and <HI>Melancholy;</HI> in
<HI>Pal&s;ies, Epilep&s;ies,</HI> and other <HI>Cephalick</HI>
and <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers; in Di&s;orders
of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels;</HI> Ob&s;tru|ctions
of the <HI>Liver</HI> and <HI>Gall-bladder;</HI>
in <HI>green</HI> and <HI>breeding</HI> Sickne&s;&s;es; in
<HI>Barrenne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> after Child|birth;
in Ob&s;tructions of the <HI>Monthly</HI>
Purgations; and all other peculiar Di&s;|ea&s;es
of the <HI>Sex.</HI> And truly, if a Per|&s;on
afflicted with a low, broken or ten|der
Con&s;titution, &s;uffering under the
tedious Pains and Inquietudes of any of
the lingering Di&s;tempers now men|tion'd,
where the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> or Bowels are
yet &s;ound, wou'd know the fitte&s;t Place
<PB N="58" REF="72">
in <HI>Britain</HI> to &s;pend their Life-time with
the greate&s;t Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure; take all
the Advantages of the Place together,
the Agreeablene&s;s of the Waters to the
Stomach; the Certainty of their pro|curing
a good Appetite, when it fails;
and the no le&s;s certain Con&s;equence
thereupon, Freedom and Chearfulne&s;s
of Spirits; the regular way of living;
the Excellency of the Provi&s;ions; the
Warmne&s;s, Cleanne&s;s and Neatne&s;s of
the Hou&s;ing; the Conveniency of the
free, fre&s;h and open Air of the neigh|bouring
Downs for Exerci&s;e; the Ea&s;i|ne&s;s
of the Amu&s;ements; and the Ad|vantage
of what Conver&s;ation one de|&s;ires;
I &s;ay, taking all the&s;e Advanta|ges
together, I can affirm, from near
twenty Years Experience, without Su&s;|picion
of Flattery, or Fear of Contra|diction,
that <HI>Bath</HI> is the Place.</P>
<P>XXXII. Some wi&s;e and frugal Peo|ple
think the mere drinking of the&s;e
Waters, for &s;ome time, without taking
<PB N="59" REF="73">
any Medicine, either before or with
them, may be &s;ufficient to remove any
of the Chronical Ails they are good
for; but tho&s;e, if they are really ill,
in any other manner, except mere Lo&s;s
of Appetite, are generally convinc'd,
upon Trial, at their own Expence, that
they neither ought to begin a Cour&s;e of
the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, without a previous
clean&s;ing of the Stomach and Bowels,
le&s;t they wa&s;h into the Blood through
the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> by the perpetual Dilution
of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, tho&s;e Impurities,
which con&s;tantly cleave to them; nor
that they ought to expect a perfect Cure
of a long-breeding and lingering Di|&s;temper,
without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e
other Medicines which are reckon'd Spe|cifick
in the Ca&s;e; and to which the
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters are &s;o plea&s;ant and &s;o a&s;|&s;i&s;tent
a Vehicle. For it is but Pru|dence
to bring all the Forces one can
rai&s;e, again&s;t &s;o potent and &s;o formi|dable
an Enemy as a Chronical Di|&s;temper.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="74">
XXXIII. It is not po&s;&s;ible to lay down
a general Rule, about the Quantity of
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters, which it is convenient to
drink daily; that being to be varied ac|cording
to &s;ome Circum&s;tances of the
Patient, and the Nature of the Di&s;tem|per:
Strong, full and large Bodies bear
more Waters than tender, thin and
le&s;&s;er ones; the younger more than the
elder; tho&s;e of &s;trong and firm, than
tho&s;e of weak and relax'd <HI>Nerves;</HI> tho&s;e
who labour under the <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Rheu|mati&s;m,</HI>
than tho&s;e who are di&s;order'd
in the <HI>Alimentary</HI> Pa&s;&s;ages, or are &s;ub|ject
to <HI>Scorbutick</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI> Weakne&s;&s;es,
and the like. But in general, it were
to be wi&s;h'd, that <HI>People</HI> who come to
<HI>Bath</HI> for their Healths, drunk le&s;s daily
than they commonly do; and allow'd
more Time for a Chronical Di&s;temper.
I think it may be &s;afely advanc'd, That
any Quantity greater than an <HI>Engli&s;h
Quart,</HI> in a Morning, drunk in two
Hours Time, half a Pint every half
Hour, is more than what is rea&s;onable.
<PB N="61" REF="75">
For, drinking in this Proportion, all
the re&s;t of the Day; at Meals, <HI>to wit,</HI>
in the Afternoon, and going to Bed,
they mu&s;t take down no le&s;s than five
Pounds in about &s;ixteen Hours; <HI>viz.</HI>
two Pounds in the Morning, a Pint and
an half with Wine at Dinner, half a
Pound in the Afternoon, and as much
at Supper and at going to Bed. This
every Body mu&s;t &s;ee is fully &s;ufficient to
an&s;wer all the Intentions of drinking
<HI>Mineral</HI> Waters. A greater Quantity
than this will &s;erve only to di&s;tend and
<HI>relax</HI> the Alimentary Pa&s;&s;ages; to force
its way through the large&s;t, and mo&s;t
patent <HI>Tubes;</HI> and to propagate the Cir|culation
through the Branches and <HI>In|o&s;culations</HI>
of the larger Arteries and
Veins, where the lea&s;t Foulne&s;s and
fewe&s;t Ob&s;tructions can happen: So
that it will &s;carce ever reach the fine&s;t
Capillary Ve&s;&s;els, in which alone the
Danger lies. And the late <HI>Ingenious</HI>
and <HI>Learned Doctor James Keill</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Pag. 49. <HI>Tentam, Medico-Phy&s;ic. Jac. Keill.</HI></NOTE> has
<PB N="62" REF="76">
made it evident, that the mo&s;t expedi|tious
way of altering the whole Ma&s;s of
the Blood, by <HI>Mineral</HI> Waters, is,
by &s;mall and frequent Draughts. In
mo&s;t Ca&s;es a <HI>Pint</HI> in a Morning is &s;uf|ficient,
and in low Con&s;titutions and
Di&s;orders in the Alimentary Pa&s;&s;ages,
tending to Vomiting and Purging, <HI>half
a Pint</HI> is enough; and whatever Quan|tity
is to be drunk, 'tis always be&s;t to
take it in &s;mall Quantities, and at good
Di&s;tances, provided it come within the
Compa&s;s of the Morning. What is
drunk at Meals, tho' cold, yet being
fre&s;h, and not altogether drain'd of its
Principles and Virtues, contributes near
as much to the Cure, as that which is
taken in the Morning. The Afternoon
and Evening's Draughts are more <HI>arbi|trary,</HI>
and mu&s;t depend upon the Ob|&s;ervation
of the Patient, as he finds
them agreeable to his Stomach, and &s;it
ea&s;ily or not: Where too great Quan|tities
have not been &s;wallow'd down in
a Morning, they are very proper, pro|vided
they be in Proportion to the
<PB N="63" REF="77">
Morning's Quantity, and never taken
under four or five Hours after Dinner;
and that at Night, not under two or
three Hours after Supper; the&s;e times
being the mo&s;t proper to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Di|ge&s;tion,
and carry off the Remains of
the Food. But the Truth is, as no|thing
is more nece&s;&s;ary, in a Cour&s;e of
the&s;e Waters, than &s;etting out right at
fir&s;t; &s;o nothing requires more the Ex|perience
and Judgment of a Phy&s;ician,
than the accommodating the previous
Preparations, the Quantities to be drunk,
and the Medicines to be taken with them,
to the Di&s;temper and the Con&s;titution
of the Patient. For the&s;e once &s;ettl'd,
the re&s;t generally goes on &s;ucce&s;sfully.</P>
<P>XXXIV. I come now, in the la&s;t
place, to make a few Ob&s;ervations up|on
irregular <HI>Gouts.</HI> When the original
Con&s;titution is broken and impair'd;
the Parts &s;ubdu'd and full of <HI>Gouty</HI> Salts;
the Force of the Circulation, by Age
and frequent Fits, weaken'd, and con|tinu'd
only through the Ino&s;culations
<PB N="64" REF="78">
of the great Ve&s;&s;els; the Humour re|coils
inwardly upon the Bowels. And
this is call'd an irregular <HI>Gout.</HI> While
it is in any Joynt, or any <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Part,
it is &s;till e&s;teem'd regular, tho' the near|er
it comes to tho&s;e outward Parts, the
lea&s;t remote from the Heart and Bow|els,
the nearer it comes to an irregular
one, and &s;o con&s;equently to its la&s;t and
fatal Stages. To which it &s;eldom comes
unattended; for it generally brings the
<HI>Stone</HI> along with it: Of which it mayn't
be ami&s;s to make this one Ob&s;ervation,
to wit,</P>
<P>XXXIV. That the Chalk-Stones
voided from the Joynts of <HI>Gouty</HI> Per|&s;ons,
and the Gravel Stones found in
the Bladders of &s;uch as were afflicted
with this Di&s;temper (perhaps the Stones
found &s;ometimes in the Gall-Bladder,
but of this I can affirm nothing) are,
to all their e&s;&s;ential Qualities, the &s;ame.
They have both the &s;ame Colour, Ta&s;te
and Smell; they yield both the &s;ame
Principles, and produce the &s;ame Ap|pearances,
<PB N="65" REF="79">
when treated chymically.
They have both the &s;ame internal Tex|ture
of Parts, as far as can be known,
and even the &s;ame outward Shape, when
unbroken and unconfin'd by hard Sub|&s;tances;
and they generally happen to
one and the &s;ame Per&s;on: At lea&s;t it
&s;eldom comes to pa&s;s, that any one is
much troubl'd with the <HI>Gout,</HI> but he
has the <HI>Stone</HI> at la&s;t. And this &s;hews
that they are both owing to the &s;ame
Conformation of Parts, and other ge|neral
Cau&s;es. It is true, &s;ome have
&s;uffer'd violently by the <HI>Stone,</HI> who ne|ver
had the <HI>Gout;</HI> but this may be ow|ing
to a &s;pecial, hereditary Narrowne&s;s
and Stiffne&s;s of the Urinary Pa&s;&s;ages,
in re&s;pect of the other Ve&s;&s;els; and a
particular unhappy Texture of Parts, as
it happens to &s;ome other Organs in other
Per&s;ons: For fat People have &s;maller
Ve&s;&s;els in proportion to their Stature
than lean. But in the general, it is pret|ty
con&s;tant, that tho&s;e who &s;uffer long
under &s;evere Fits of the <HI>Gout,</HI> &s;eldom
e&s;cape the <HI>Stone.</HI> Dr. <HI>Cyprianus,</HI> the
<PB N="66" REF="80">
late ingenious Cutter for the <HI>Stone,</HI> had
ob&s;erv'd, that tho&s;e who only drunk
Malt Liquor were &s;eldom ever violent|ly
afflicted with that Di&s;temper: And
among many hundred he had cut, he
had never found one, who had only
drunk Ale or Beer. Whether this was
owing to the le&s;&s;er Quantity of Salts in
tho&s;e Liquors than in Wine, or to the
Slipperine&s;s they induce upon the Bow|els
and other Ve&s;&s;els, or to both, I will
not here take upon me to determine.
But I believe the Fact is, both in the
<HI>Stone</HI> and acquir'd <HI>Gouts,</HI> that tho&s;e who
only drink Malt Liquors, without Wine
or Spirits, are &s;eldom violently afflicted
with either. And for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons
it comes to pa&s;s, that the <HI>Gouts</HI> and
<HI>Gravel</HI> of the Sex, are &s;eldom &s;o &s;evere
as in Men; they generally drinking
le&s;s Wine, and feeding le&s;s of Fi&s;h and
Fle&s;h Meats. And that in the <HI>Gouts,</HI>
both of Men and Women, who drink
no Wine nor Spirits, any little proper
Medicine has entirely kept off the Pain,
and prevented the Fits. I know an
<PB N="67" REF="81">
antient Gentleman, formerly treated
pretty roughly by the <HI>Gout,</HI> who drink|ing
only Malt Liquors, has, for &s;eve|ral
Years, with certain Succe&s;s, entire|ly
kept off the Pains and Fits of the
<HI>Gout,</HI> by taking only every Morning,
regularly, a Pint of warm White Wine
Whey, to encourage Per&s;piration:
Which when he neglects to do, they
as certainly return. We may therefore
conclude, 1. That &s;ince the <HI>Gout</HI> and
<HI>Gravel</HI> Stones are, as to their e&s;&s;ential
Qualities, much the &s;ame; and &s;ince
'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible to account for the
breeding of the <HI>Stone,</HI> but from a par|ticular
Narrowne&s;s and Stiffne&s;s of the
Urinary Ve&s;&s;els, and an abundance of
&s;uch Salts in the Fluids; it is highly
probable, that the <HI>Gout</HI> mu&s;t proceed
from the &s;ame general Cau&s;es: And
this is &s;ome kind of Confirmation of
the two fir&s;t Propo&s;itions laid down in
the beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e. 2. The
&s;ame Method and Medicines that have
been deduc'd from the fir&s;t two Propo|&s;itions,
for relieving <HI>Gouty</HI> Pes&s;ons, in
<PB N="68" REF="82">
the Intervals of the Fits, will likewi&s;e
&s;erve for preventing the Encrea&s;e of the
<HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel;</HI> as we are certain they
do from the be&s;t Experience and Prac|tice
in this Ca&s;e. I will now go on
with my purpo&s;e, and con&s;ider an ir|regular
<HI>Gout,</HI> fix'd on the&s;e three great
In&s;truments of Human Life, the <HI>Head,</HI>
the <HI>Stomach,</HI> and <HI>Guts.</HI></P>
<P>XXXV. When the <HI>Gout</HI> has &s;eiz'd
on the Head, it is to be treated as any
other violent Head-ach, or as an In|flammation
on the Brain, or its Mem|branes;
by Bleeding at the Arm or <HI>Ju|gular;</HI>
Cupping on the Back; Bli&s;ter|ing
between the Shoulders, but e&s;peci|ally
on the Ancles, to give the <HI>Gouty</HI>
Humour a Vent downwards. In young
and &s;trong Con&s;titutions, <HI>Mercurial</HI> and
<HI>Antimonial</HI> Vomits will do Wonders,
tho' they are &s;eldom to be ventur'd up|on
in any Con&s;titution above Forty.
The Intention here to be had in View
(as in all other irregular <HI>Gouts</HI>) is to
expel the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour outwardly upon
<PB N="69" REF="83">
the Mu&s;cles or Joynts, and to fix it
there. Wherefore in order to carry it
to as great a Di&s;tance from the noble
Organs as may be, a free Pa&s;&s;age is to
be open'd to it on the Limbs, by bli|&s;tering
the Ancles and Wri&s;ts; and to
promote its Conveyance thither, gen|tle
Stomach Purgers are to be pour'd
down continually, two or three Spoon|fuls
every third Hour, till the Effect is
obtain'd. And for this end, I recom|mend
principally Tincture of <HI>Hiera Pi|cra</HI>
with compound Spirit of <HI>Lavender,</HI>
and a few Drops of Tincture of <HI>Snake|weed,</HI>
and Tincture of <HI>Diambra,</HI> as
being one of the mo&s;t powerful Expel|lents,
and an excellent Strengthner of
the Stomach and Bowels. Its common
Mi&s;chief is little to be minded here, for
the forcing Blood or the Piles will car|ry
the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour along with it;
and the&s;e Di&s;orders are but Trifles in
re&s;pect of an irregular <HI>Gout.</HI> This Me|thod
will either &s;pend the <HI>Gouty</HI> Hu|mour,
or turn it to a regular Fit. But
here Care is to be taken that the Me|dicines
<PB N="70" REF="84">
be not too hot, e&s;pecially in
young &s;anguine Complexions, le&s;t an
Inflammation on the Brain, or its Mem|branes
&s;hou'd turn to a Phrenzy or Fe|ver:
But there is le&s;s Danger of this,
becau&s;e the <HI>Gout</HI> in the Head &s;eldom
happens to the younger, except through
much and long Intemperance.</P>
<P>XXXVI. The <HI>Gout</HI> in the Stomach
is a common and le&s;s dangerous Ca&s;e;
for the <HI>Gout</HI> &s;eldom comes on and goes
off without touching there by the way.
In the &s;light Touches of it, any little
Stomach Purge will &s;et it a packing.
But it is more ob&s;tinate towards the De|cline
of Life; when it &s;ettles in a con|&s;tant
Pain, nau&s;eating and kecking in
the Stomach. Vomits are reckon'd
dangerous in the <HI>Gout,</HI> le&s;t they &s;hou'd
derive the Humour on the Stomach:
But there can be room for no &s;uch a
Su&s;picion here. Wherefore upon the
fir&s;t Seizure of the Stomach, a Vomit
is in&s;tantly to be admini&s;tred, and re|peated
according to the occa&s;ion of the
<PB N="71" REF="85">
Ca&s;e: After that <HI>Hiera Picra</HI> as is be|fore
caution'd and qualify'd, with a hot
<HI>Sinapi&s;m,</HI> or Bli&s;ter on the Ancles: And
la&s;t of all, the highe&s;t Cordials, and
mo&s;t generous Wines, may be freely
indulg'd, without fear of Inflammation.
Among the Cordials, I wou'd recom|mend
the <HI>Electuarium de Ovo,</HI> as con|taining
<HI>Camphir</HI> (the mo&s;t con&s;tant and
active <HI>Diaphoretic,</HI> and the mo&s;t u&s;eful
one for that purpo&s;e) and &s;ome other of
the riche&s;t Cordials. After all this Ma|nagement,
&s;hou'd the <HI>Gout</HI> &s;till conti|nue
in the Stomach, and become habi|tual
(which it &s;eldom does after &s;uch a
Method taken in time) nothing but a
long Cour&s;e of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters with
<HI>Steel,</HI> Bitters, and gentle Stomach Pur|gers,
a regular Diet, and proper Exer|ci&s;e,
can effectually cure it.</P>
<P>XXXVII. The <HI>Gout</HI> in the Guts, on
its fir&s;t Seizure, may be ea&s;ily treated,
as a bilious <HI>Cholic;</HI> only the <HI>Opiats,</HI>
commonly and ju&s;tly given in the <HI>Cho|lic,</HI>
are not here to be us'd, but in the
<PB N="72" REF="86">
la&s;t Extremity. But this Di&s;temper
ought to be treated altogether in the
manner pre&s;crib'd in the former Section,
about the <HI>Gout</HI> in the Stomach.</P>
<P>XXXVIII. There remains but one
Di&s;tinction more of the <HI>Gout,</HI> and one
which has not hitherto been much con|&s;ider'd:
For as the <HI>Cholic</HI> or <HI>A&s;thma</HI> is,
&s;o the <HI>Gout</HI> may be, divided into the
Humorous and <HI>Nervous;</HI> tho' this Di|&s;tinction
depends more upon the Com|plexion
of the Patient, than the ab|&s;tracted
Nature of the Di&s;temper. The
Humorous <HI>Gout</HI> happens only to People
of gro&s;&s;er Habits, more robu&s;t Con&s;ti|tutions,
and more &s;tiff and &s;pringy. <HI>Fi|bres,</HI>
and is the <HI>Gout</HI> which I have been
hitherto treating. All I can further
add to what has been &s;aid, is, that un|der
the Fit White Wines are more eli|gible
than Red; becau&s;e tho&s;e part
more readily with their Spirits, and are
le&s;s a&s;tringent than the&s;e. And for the
&s;ame Rea&s;on in the Intervals, the Red
is preferable to the White: Tho' nei|ther
<PB N="73" REF="87">
of them, in either Ca&s;e, be u&s;eful
or nece&s;&s;ary, but becau&s;e Cu&s;tom or
Habit, which it is not &s;afe to alter &s;ud|denly,
has made them &s;o. For in all
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, where little Fle&s;h
Meat, and no Wine is us'd; and in
<HI>Spain,</HI> where they u&s;e them very mo|derately;
and among the wild Moun|taineers
in the <HI>Northern</HI> Countries; and
the lower Rank of the People in every
Country, where they can procure nei|ther,
there is little or no <HI>Gout.</HI> Rub|bing
the Part affected with a &s;oft Hand,
or warm Napkin, as &s;trongly as the Pa|tient
can bear it, is the ready way to
make the Humour per&s;pire in the Fit.
And Cold Bathing, and rubbing with a
Fle&s;h Bru&s;h, Morning and Night, are
&s;ome of the mo&s;t certain outward Means,
to bring Strength and Nouri&s;hment in|to
it, in the Intervals.</P>
<P>XXXIX. Having mention'd Cold
Bathing, I am the more willing to &s;et
this &s;o &s;afe and univer&s;al a Mean, for
the Recovery of the weaken'd Parts,
<PB N="74" REF="88">
after a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in a clearer
light; becau&s;e a groundle&s;s Jealou&s;y of
the Danger of its throwing the <HI>Gout</HI>
inwardly, has made it univer&s;ally di&s;|us'd.
Nothing made a greater Noi&s;e
upon its fir&s;t Re&s;toration, and nothing
cou'd have &s;unk lower in its Reputation
&s;ince, than Cold Bathing: And it will
always happen &s;o in things fitted to the
vulgar Capacity, when they are uni|ver&s;ally
pre&s;crib'd, without Di&s;tinction
and without Choice. Tho&s;e who know
how greatly Foulne&s;s and Uncleanline&s;s
promote Epidemical, Pe&s;tilential and
Infectious Di&s;tempers, can only tell
what Cleanne&s;s contributes to Health.
The <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> People (who&s;e Lazine&s;s,
in other things, is owing to their Cli|mate)
have found Cold Bathing and
Ablution &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their Health,
that they have made it a part of their
Religion, as it is a Precept of a Reli|gion
of a nobler Extract, from whence
they borrow'd it. If the modern Do|ctrine
be true, as I really think it is,
that the &s;malle&s;t <HI>Fibres,</HI> or tho&s;e of the
<PB N="75" REF="89">
la&s;t Divi&s;ion, in animal Bodies, be not
open and pervious, but &s;olid; then it
may be affirm'd, that warm Water (I
mean pure Element, endu'd with no
Medical Principle) by the active Power
of its Heat, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily relax &s;uch
<HI>Fibres.</HI> And that cold Water from the
<HI>Nitre,</HI> which produces its Coldne&s;s,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contract them. The
Tumour of the <HI>Gout,</HI> like other inflam|matory
Swellings, is owing to an Ob|&s;truction,
or to the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humours flow|ing
fa&s;ter by the <HI>Arteries,</HI> than it can
be receiv'd by the Veins; the Smalle&s;t
or Capillary Ve&s;&s;els are thereby extend|ed
and &s;tretch'd, beyond their natural
Power of Re&s;titution; &s;o that when the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is &s;pent by Per&s;piration,
or driven into the Veins by the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
Stroaks of the Circulation; the Ob|&s;truction
remov'd; and the Pain entire|ly
gone off; the Ve&s;&s;els continue thus
widen'd and &s;tretch'd, beyond their
Power of Re&s;titution, for a long time
after. And this is the &s;ole Cau&s;e of the
long and tedious Weakne&s;s on the Part
<PB N="76" REF="90">
after the Fit is over; which wou'd yet
continue longer, did not the Coolne&s;s
and Pre&s;&s;ure of the Ambient Air, and
the now &s;ufferable Weight of the Cloath|ing,
give the fir&s;t Impul&s;es to the <HI>Fi|bres</HI>
towards their contracting them|&s;elves
again. Now nothing in Nature
can &s;o readily or &s;o certainly bring this
about, as Bathing in cold Water: For
the <HI>Nitre</HI> in the Water, which is the
Cau&s;e of its Coolne&s;s; and al&s;o the uni|form
equal Pre&s;&s;ure upon the Part,
which ari&s;es from its Gravity and Flui|dity,
concur to communicate to the
<HI>Fibres</HI> a &s;trong and la&s;ting Impul&s;e to|wards
re&s;toring them&s;elves to their na|tural
State of Contraction. And the
<HI>Gouty</HI> Humour now being &s;pent, and
the Ob&s;truction entirely remov'd, as is
&s;uppos'd, how can any &s;uch Humour
be tran&s;lated upon another part, by
cold Bathing, more than if the Per&s;on
had never had the <HI>Gout?</HI> Now to make
this Remedy &s;till more effectual, after
a previous Cour&s;e of cold Bathing, cold
Pumping on the part, by the Force
<PB N="77" REF="91">
of a Pump, or the Fall of Water from
a Height, may be conveniently us'd:
The wonderful Efficacy of which is no
le&s;s certain here, than it is in White
Swellings on the Joints, where, I think,
it is a never failing Remedy. I am ve|ry
well inform'd of the Ca&s;e of a very
con&s;iderable Per&s;on, who, for many
Years before, being tormented with
con&s;tant and uninterrupted Pains of the
<HI>Gout,</HI> Summer and Winter, by daily
Bathing in a Tub of cold Water, has,
for the&s;e &s;everal Years by-pa&s;t, brought
them to regular and periodical Fits, at
the Cardinal and Critical Sea&s;ons only;
and of no longer Duration than u&s;ual.
I know al&s;o an ingenious Phy&s;ician,
who, after a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> goes dai|ly
into the cold Bath, till the part has
recover'd its natural Strength, which
con&s;tantly happens in much le&s;s time
than it wou'd do otherwi&s;e. And many
others, who are con&s;iderably &s;trength|en'd,
and pre&s;erv'd from catching Cold,
by cold Bathing in the Intervals of the
<HI>Gout;</HI> tho' this Practice is very cauti|ou&s;ly
<PB N="78" REF="92">
to be gone about by the old and
weak.</P>
<P>XL. The <HI>Nervous</HI> or Flying <HI>Gout</HI>
(both which I take to be the &s;ame, and
to differ from the Windy <HI>Gout,</HI> which
is nothing but a <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> or <HI>Hy|&s;terical</HI>
Symptom) is owing to the Weak|ne&s;s,
Softne&s;s, or Relaxation of the
<HI>Nerves</HI> of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who labour un|der
it. All the Solids of the Body are
made up of &s;mall Threads or Filaments
of different Natures and Textures. They
are divided into the <HI>Fle&s;hy,</HI> the <HI>Ner|vous,</HI>
the <HI>Membranous,</HI> and the <HI>Bony;</HI>
and make up the &s;olid Sub&s;tance of the
whole Animal Body: But all of them
agree in a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree of
Springine&s;s or Ela&s;ticity. And it is ob|&s;ervable,
that &s;ome of the mo&s;t perfect
&s;pringy Bodies, are made of animal and
vegetable Sub&s;tances; &s;uch as Ivory,
Ebony and Whalebone. Wherein the
general Nature of Ela&s;ticity con&s;i&s;ts, or
what is the particular Cau&s;e of the emi|nent
Springine&s;s of animal <HI>Fibres,</HI> is as
<PB N="79" REF="93">
hard to explain as conceive; which
notwith&s;tanding, is the noble&s;t In&s;tru|ment
of all the Actions and Functions
of an animated Body. All the At|tempts
hitherto made to di&s;cover the
particular Nature of a <HI>Contractile</HI> and
<HI>Di&s;tractile</HI> Animal <HI>Fibre,</HI> to me &s;eem in|&s;ufficient
and conjectural. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI>
has di&s;cover'd, by his Gla&s;&s;es, that the
&s;malle&s;t <HI>Fibre</HI> of an <HI>Elephant</HI> is not big|ger
than that of the &s;malle&s;t <HI>In&s;ect:</HI>
And if the modern Sy&s;tem of Genera|tion
be ju&s;t, to wit, That an Animal
or Plant comes from another le&s;&s;er one;
then Growth is nothing, but the un|folding
the original <HI>Membranes</HI> and <HI>Fi|bres:</HI>
And the Length of every <HI>Fibre</HI> is
the &s;ame in the younge&s;t, as in the full
grown Animal or Plant. So Growth
and Motion both, that is, the whole
Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Animal Life, is owing
to the Springine&s;s of the&s;e <HI>Fibres.</HI> The
be&s;t Re&s;emblance I can make of them,
is that of a long Hair, or &s;mall twi&s;ted.
Gut, which, when &s;tretch'd to any
length beyond its natural State, will
<PB N="80" REF="94">
re&s;tore it &s;elf again to its former Di|men&s;ions.
And in this Contraction
and Re&s;titution of an Animal <HI>Fibre,</HI>
the greate&s;t My&s;teries of the whole Stru|cture
con&s;i&s;t. As there are &s;ome Peo|ple
who have hard, gro&s;s, &s;tiff Hair,
with a &s;trong Spring; &s;o there are o|thers,
who have &s;oft, fine, weak Hair,
with a feeble Spring: And generally
&s;peaking, as the Hair is, &s;o the Threads,
Filaments and <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Body are.
Tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>Fibres</HI> are &s;oft, fine, weak
and of a feeble Spring, are generally
&s;aid to be of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> and liable to
<HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers. And here we may
ob&s;erve the Difference between more
ten&s;e and &s;tiffer <HI>Fibres,</HI> and more &s;prin|gy
and ela&s;tick ones. All the <HI>Fibres</HI>
of the Body are in a State of <HI>Di&s;ten&s;ion,</HI>
as is evident from the gaping Lips of
Wounds. Two Per&s;ons may have <HI>Fi|bres</HI>
of the &s;ame Degree of Springine&s;s
and Ela&s;ticity; and yet in their natural
State, and original Formation, the <HI>Fi|bres</HI>
of the one may be more &s;tretch'd,
bent and di&s;tracted, and con&s;equently
<PB N="81" REF="95">
more &s;tiff and ten&s;e than tho&s;e of the
other; whereby the more &s;tiff or ten&s;e
<HI>Fibres</HI> making a greater Re&s;i&s;tance, and
being with more Difficulty &s;tretch'd and
widen'd, will give more Pain, when a
gro&s;s Fluid pa&s;&s;es thro' them, than le&s;s
&s;tiff or ten&s;e <HI>Fibres</HI> will. Which gives an
Account why of two Per&s;ons, both of
them of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> the one &s;hou'd
have the <HI>Gout,</HI> the other be free from
it. Per&s;ons of weak <HI>Nerves</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
have le&s;s Strength, a weaker Pul&s;e
and Dige&s;tion; a &s;lower and more im|perfect
Circulation of the Fluids, and
a le&s;s free and perfect Per&s;piration; and
if they happen to indulge in &s;trong
Meats and generous Wines, they mu&s;t
become &s;ubject to <HI>Hy&s;teric, Hypochon|driac</HI>
and <HI>Cephalic</HI> Di&s;orders. But if, toge|ther
with weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> a greater De|gree
of Ten&s;ity or Stiffne&s;s be join'd,
under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, they
will be liable to <HI>Gouty,</HI> together with
the foremention'd Di&s;orders. But by
rea&s;on of the Natural Weakne&s;s and
le&s;s Original Springine&s;s of their <HI>Ner|vous
<PB N="82" REF="96">
Fibres,</HI> the Fits of the&s;e <HI>Gouts</HI> will
be le&s;s painful and more con&s;tant.</P>
<P>XLI. <HI>Coroll.</HI> From this Account of
the <HI>Nervous Gout</HI> and other <HI>Nervous</HI> Di|&s;tempers,
'tis plain, all Evacuations (ex|cept
the mo&s;t gentle) mu&s;t be prejudi|cial
in them. Gentle Vomits, as they
clean&s;e the Stomach and Bowels, and
principally as they free the <HI>Nerves</HI> from
all extraneous Bodies, and increa&s;e the
Per&s;piration, by the violent Convul&s;ions
and Contractions of the internal Mu&s;|cles
and Membranes; Bli&s;ters, as they
open the Ob&s;tructions of the &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els,
by their external, and thin the
&s;izy Juices by their internal Efficacy; I
&s;ay, both the&s;e Evacuations, may not
only &s;afely, but with great Advantage,
be us'd in <HI>Nervous</HI> Ca&s;es. But all vio|lent
Purges and exce&s;&s;ive Bleedings, are
religiou&s;ly to be ab&s;tain'd from, as en|crea&s;ing
the original Weakne&s;s. Pur|ges
in People of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> in Chro|nical
Ca&s;es, carry off a great part of
the Nouri&s;hment of almo&s;t three Days.
<PB N="83" REF="97">
Vomits, on the contrary, carry off
only tho&s;e Crudities, that &s;end up to
the Head and <HI>Nervous</HI> Sy&s;tem, the noxi|ous
Fumes and Vapours that cau&s;e their
Mi&s;ery. Purges relax and weaken the
<HI>Fibres</HI> of a natural and nece&s;&s;ary Fun|ction,
to wit, tho&s;e of Dige&s;tion:
Whereas Vomits can but weaken the
Action of <HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres,</HI> le&s;s us'd,
&s;trong in them&s;elves, and not &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary
to Concoction; as is evident from
<HI>Mon&s;ieur Chirac</HI>'s Experiment about Vo|miting.
Purges carry off little, but
what wou'd otherwi&s;e pa&s;s off, in time,
by the natural Cour&s;e of the <HI>Peri&s;taltic</HI>
Motion; and generally leave behind
them what wants the inverted Mo|tion,
as they found it. Whereas Vo|mits
pump up tho&s;e Crudities, that
Nature it &s;elf wou'd (gladly, &s;o to
&s;peak) throw up, by the &s;ame Or|gans,
the &s;ame way Nature tends.
<HI>La&s;tly,</HI> &s;our and acid Humours, lodg'd
in the Stomach and Guts, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
weaken both, more than either
gentle Vomits, or Purges po&s;&s;ibly can;
<PB N="84" REF="98">
with this Difference tho', that a very
gentle, natural, or artificial Purging,
continu'd for any long time, in Per&s;ons
of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> &s;hall both weaken the
Per&s;on, and wa&s;te the <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Fle&s;h.
Whereas you &s;hall find, after &s;everal
Months daily Vomiting, in a Sea Voy|age,
a Day or two's Refre&s;hment a&s;hoar,
re&s;tores the Per&s;on to a greater Degree
of Alacrity and Strength than before:
Whence it comes to pa&s;s, that Per&s;ons
of weak <HI>Nerves</HI> are &s;o much reliev'd and
rais'd by Vomits; and, on the contrary,
&s;o much &s;unk and depre&s;s'd by rough
and &s;trong Purges in Chronical Ca&s;es.
What farther is to be expected in &s;uch
Ca&s;es, is to be done by a regular and
&s;trict Diet, fitted to the mere Nece&s;&s;ities
of Nature. Strengthners of the Di|ge&s;tive
Faculties, (and here the <HI>Bark</HI>
and <HI>Steel</HI> claim the fir&s;t place, as being
the mo&s;t certain Strengthners of weak
<HI>Nerves</HI>) gentle and con&s;tant Exerci&s;e,
as encouraging the Per&s;piration: <HI>Aro|matic</HI>
and Spicy Bitters, Volatile and
attenuating Medicines, and whatever
<PB N="85" REF="99">
may be thought fit to nouri&s;h, comfort
and &s;upport the Animal Functions.</P>
<P>XLII. Having had frequent occa&s;ion
to mention the <HI>Bark,</HI> as being ab&s;olute|ly
nece&s;&s;ary to the Subject I treat; it
may not be ami&s;s to remove one Obje|ction
again&s;t it; and the only one I
have ever heard or read made with any
Shew of Rea&s;on. I have taken as much
of it my &s;elf, and as often, and have
pre&s;crib'd it as freely as any of my Age,
I believe; and never ob&s;erv'd it, either
in my &s;elf or others, do any Hurt, ex|cept
when it has been injudiciou&s;ly and
improperly pre&s;crib'd, and that in con|tinu'd
acute Ca&s;es only. The Objecti|on
is, that it often leaves behind it a
bad Habit, a <HI>Scorbutic, Cachectic,</HI> or
<HI>Hectic</HI> Con&s;titution; bad <HI>Lungs, Li|ver,</HI>
or <HI>Stomach;</HI> or &s;ome of the great
<HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> &s;poil'd or corrupted. But the
Mi&s;take in this Objection lies here, to
wit, that few Con&s;titutions break, and
&s;eldom any of the&s;e great Organs be|come
vitiated; but they begin with an
<PB N="86" REF="100">
intermittent or periodical <HI>Fever.</HI> And
the&s;e I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd to be
of that kind, and approaching that Sea|&s;on,
which <HI>Sydenham</HI> mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly
di&s;tingui&s;hes from <HI>Vernal</HI> ones, and calls
<HI>Autumnal Agues;</HI> and are indeed &s;ympto|matical
only, ari&s;ing from beginning
Ob&s;tructions in the whole Habit, or in
the&s;e greater <HI>Vi&s;cera:</HI> where all Nature
is at work, and the whole Organs la|bour
and &s;truggle to thin the &s;izy Flu|ids,
and to open the ob&s;tructed Bowels;
but not being able to bring about this
End, Nature &s;uccumbs after every Fe|veri&s;h
Fit, thus excited, into a wor&s;e
State. And even here too, the <HI>Bark</HI>
does all its proper Office, in quenching,
to wit, the violent <HI>Paroxy&s;ms</HI> of the <HI>Fe|ver,</HI>
which only can endanger the Life
of the Patient: and allows time for other
Medicines to act. But when the Ha|bit
is already broken, and the great
<HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> already un&s;ound; it cannot be
blamed that it do's not re&s;tore the&s;e; no|thing
like that being expected from it,
or a&s;cribed to it. When the <HI>Bark</HI> has
<PB N="87" REF="101">
extingui&s;h'd the Feveri&s;h Fits, which
threaten Death to the Patient, a Re|prieve
is obtain'd: in which, by deob&s;tru|ent
and attenuating Medicines, Health
and Life may be &s;ecur'd. In relax'd
<HI>Nerves</HI> of the <HI>Primae viae;</HI> in almo&s;t all
&s;orts of <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Cephalic</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es
depending on the&s;e; in all <HI>Gouty</HI> Di&s;or|ders
in the <HI>Alimentary</HI> Pa&s;&s;ages; in all
<HI>Nervous Gouts;</HI> in all Intermittent and
<HI>Periodical</HI> Di&s;tempers, or Pains what|&s;oever:
'tis preferable to any thing hi|therto
us'd; only in very cold Sto|machs
and Con&s;titutions, I have found a
Decoction of the <HI>Indian Bark,</HI> by &s;ome
call'd <HI>Elatherium,</HI> to be yet more effe|ctual
and &s;trengthning; as it will al&s;o
more readily remove the Periodical
Di&s;orders of &s;uch. But the <HI>Peruvian
Bark</HI> I never found did any Hurt, but
in acute continu'd Ca&s;es; where it runs
into violent Purgings: And in the
<HI>Monthly Purgations</HI> of the Sex, which
&s;ometimes it will ob&s;truct; and there|fore
it ought not to be given without
<PB N="88" REF="102">
<HI>Steel;</HI> which ought al&s;o to be added,
when it is given in Chronical Ca&s;es.
It were to be wi&s;h'd only, in the&s;e Ca&s;es
it gave the &s;ame Relief the &s;econd and
&s;ucceeding times it does the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>XLIII. I have formerly ob&s;erv'd, that
when the <HI>Gout</HI> becomes di&s;pers'd over
the whole Habit, or fix'd and &s;ettl'd on
a particular Joint, <HI>Mercurial</HI> Vomits
and Purges were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
di&s;lodge it. But there is one Species of
the <HI>Gout</HI> which mi&s;erably torments its
Subjects, and yet yields not to that,
or very rarely to any of the Methods
in u&s;e; I mean the <HI>Gout</HI> on the Hip|Joint,
when fix'd and con&s;tant, com|monly
call'd the <HI>Sciatica;</HI> and yet treat|ed
after the manner I'm to explain,
never fails of a perfect Cure. The
Foundation of the Method I had from
the late <HI>mo&s;t Learn'd and Eminent Phy&s;i|cian
Doctor Archibald Pitcairn;</HI> he hav|ing
communicated it to me under no
Re&s;triction of Secrecy, I think my &s;elf
<PB N="89" REF="103">
oblig'd to publi&s;h it to the World, for
the Benefit of the afflicted. I have us'd
it with great Succe&s;s the&s;e &s;everal Years,
and I think have improv'd it in &s;everal
Particulars of the Management; and &s;o
never fail of a perfect Cure, if the Di|&s;temper
is a genuine <HI>Sciatica,</HI> tho' of
many Years &s;tanding; and after having
baffled all other Attempts. It con&s;i&s;ts
in taking from one, two, three Drams,
to half an Ounce (according to the
Strength of the Patient's Stomach) of
the Aetherial Oyl of <HI>Turpentine</HI> (that
which comes off between the Spirit and
Oyl, in drawing off the common Oyl
of <HI>Turpentine</HI>) in triple the Quantity of
Virgin Honey in a Morning fa&s;ting,
for four, five, &s;ix, or eight Days at far|the&s;t,
intermitting a Day now and then,
as the Patient's Occa&s;ions require, or
his Stomach &s;uffers by it: In drinking,
after it is down, large Draughts of Sack|Whey,
to &s;ettle it on the Stomach, and
carry it into the Blood: And la&s;tly, in
taking a proper Do&s;e of <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Pills
<PB N="90" REF="104">
every Night, that Day the Medicine is
&s;wallow'd. This Cour&s;e never fails to
remove the Violence of the Pain, and
to leave only a Weakne&s;s on the Part.
To remove the gro&s;&s;er Remains, and
&s;trengthen the weaken'd Part, I order
a Dram to two Drams of Flower of
Brim&s;tone, for &s;ome time, twice a
Day, in a Tea Cup full of Milk. If
through great Intemperance, or a vi|olent
Cold, the Patient relap&s;es, I
order the Repetition of the former
Medicines for a Day or two, which
commonly &s;ets it a packing. And la&s;t|ly,
to &s;trengthen the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI> and
enliven the Spirits, I advi&s;e <HI>Bath</HI> or
<HI>Spaa</HI> Waters with <HI>Steel,</HI> and Bitters
with <HI>Volatiles;</HI> and perhaps pumping
on the Part affected, which never fails
to perfect the Cure in a genuine <HI>Scia|tic.</HI>
And I hope it may be of &s;ome
u&s;e, to have a Method of Cure for this
Di&s;temper, &s;o plainly laid down, &s;o
effectual in it &s;elf, &s;o ea&s;y to the Pa|tient,
and &s;o re&s;torative of his Con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="91" REF="105">
in general, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e
Tortures and the nau&s;eous Load of Me|dicines
the afflicted are forc'd to go
through in common Practice. The
great Efficacy of this Cour&s;e con&s;i&s;ts
in the <HI>Aetherial Oyl:</HI> It has been com|mon
to pre&s;cribe a few Drops of the
Oyl of <HI>Turpentine</HI> in cold <HI>Rheumati&s;ms</HI>
and fix'd Pains on the Joints: But this
&s;eldom proves effectual in the <HI>Sciati|ca:</HI>
Whereas this <HI>Aetherial Oyl,</HI> hav|ing
all the Penetration of the <HI>Spirit,</HI>
together with the Softne&s;s and Deter|gency
of the fine&s;t <HI>Bal&s;am,</HI> but chief|ly
being of &s;uch Lightne&s;s, that any
Quantity of it may be given, that can
&s;tay on the Stomach, or be kept down
by frequent Draughts of any &s;oft Li|quor,
e&s;pecially Sack-Whey: which by
its Milkine&s;s uniting readily with the
<HI>AEtherial Oyl;</HI> Penetrates into the
lea&s;t and fine&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, and the mo&s;t
&s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy;</HI>
opens their Ob&s;tructions; di&s;&s;olves the
glutinous Gellies in the Joints; clean|&s;es
<PB N="92" REF="106">
the in&s;ides of the <HI>Tubes,</HI> and makes
all pa&s;s by Per&s;piration. The Rule
whereby to accommodate the Do&s;e
to the Patient, is to order it &s;o, that
it mayn't be &s;o much as to recoil up|wards;
to prevent which, a large
Quantity of Sack-Whey is order'd:
And it &s;eldom moves above once down|wards;
but le&s;t it &s;hou'd go farther,
in the &s;ub&s;equent Do&s;es, the Pills take
place.</P>
<P>XLIV. As to <HI>Topicks</HI> or outward Ap|plications,
to ea&s;e or relieve the Part
affected in a Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> they are
dangerous, unle&s;s di&s;creetly manag'd.
In the frequently mention'd <HI>Cardinal</HI>
Fits of <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Autumn,</HI> when,
through Ignorance or Neglect of the
Methods hitherto laid down, they &s;hall
happen <HI>Regular;</HI> I would by no means
encourage any &s;uch outward Applica|tion
of what kind &s;oever hitherto di&s;|cover'd,
except in the very la&s;t Extre|mities
of Pain. In the <HI>Regular Gouts</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="107">
at tho&s;e Sea&s;ons, the&s;e Fits are not to
be tamper'd with in any manner, but
in the way formerly directed. For the
Habit being loaded with the <HI>Gouty</HI> Hu|mour
and Salts, mu&s;t be allow'd a time
to di&s;charge it &s;elf, and drive them out of
the Body; otherwi&s;e Life mu&s;t be en|danger'd
by a <HI>putrid</HI> or <HI>malignant Fever:</HI>
And the&s;e being the Sea&s;ons when the
Humours naturally undergo &s;ome Al|terations;
if the <HI>Gout</HI> be thrown upon
the extreme Parts, Nature mu&s;t not
be di&s;turb'd in her Operations: But
whatever is to be done, is to be direct|ed
to encourage and fortify her in her
own way; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to expel
the la&s;t Breathings of this Humour up|on
the Parts mo&s;t remote from the
Head and Heart, the two Sources of
the Motion of all the Fluids: (which has
been the Intention of all the Methods
and Medicines pre&s;crib'd in this Trea|ti&s;e:)
For thus the Blood will be puri|fy'd;
the Spirits reliev'd from their Op|pre&s;&s;ion;
the Joints render'd pliable,
<PB N="94" REF="108">
and all the natural Functions &s;et at liber|ty.
When the&s;e Fits are over, any thing
that is ju&s;t and probable, and attend|ed
with no Danger, for le&s;&s;ening the
future Fits, and lengthening their In|tervals,
may be try'd. But in the Fits
falling out of the&s;e Sea&s;ons; in the te|dious
and lingering Fits of tho&s;e bro|ken
with Age, and Habitual <HI>Gouts;</HI> a
well cho&s;en outward Application may
be &s;afely and &s;ucce&s;sfully us'd; e&s;peci|ally,
if at the &s;ame time gentle Sto|machic
Purges be admini&s;tred; or a
Bli&s;ter on the Ancles or Wri&s;ts be o|pen'd,
to let out what may be repell'd
by the <HI>Topick;</HI> and thereby to &s;ecure
the noble Organs. For let Pretenders
brag what they will, I know of no out|ward
Application, hitherto di&s;cover'd,
but what by its Sluggi&s;hne&s;s &s;tops the
natural Per&s;piration: Or by its Activity
counter-acts the Direction of the Cir|culation;
and con&s;equently repels the
Humour in &s;ome degree or other. But
by thus opening a Way for the Hu|mours
<PB N="95" REF="109">
to pa&s;s el&s;ewhere, the Part af|fected
may be much reliev'd by proper
Applications. <HI>Fuller</HI> and <HI>Bates</HI> give the
Forms of &s;ome; and Doctor <HI>Pitcairn</HI>
was exceeding fond of, and held as a
great Secret, that which him&s;elf has
publi&s;h'd in the la&s;t Edition of his Trea|ti&s;es,
which is made of two Ounces of
white <HI>Ar&s;enick,</HI> and &s;ix Ounces of <HI>Live-Lime
Stone,</HI> put into four Quarts of
boiling Water, &s;et in a warm place
twenty four Hours: Stoups of this ap|ply'd
warm to the Part, he had found
effectual and &s;afe. That which I wou'd
rather recommend is Stoups of a De|coction
of <HI>Butterburr, Ground-Pine</HI> or
<HI>Camomel</HI> Flowers, or any <HI>Aromatic</HI> bit|ter
Plant in Milk; or a <HI>Pultis</HI> of the
Head of a Sack-Whey Po&s;&s;et, or any
&s;uch &s;oft and active Application, to
moi&s;ten, &s;often, relax and open at fir&s;t;
and towards the Decline of the Fit a
<HI>Mithridate</HI> or <HI>Venice Treacle</HI> Plai&s;ter;
the <HI>Empla&s;trum Stomachicum Magi&s;trale,</HI>
or the like, to &s;trengthen, warm and
<PB N="96" REF="110">
comfort; e&s;pecially if with the&s;e la&s;t a
&s;tomachic warm Purge be join'd. As
to <HI>Symptomatic Gouts,</HI> there can be no
place for them, in the Doctrine hi|therto
laid down. For on the Suppo|&s;ition,
that the <HI>Gout</HI> is owing to a par|ticular
Texture and Conformation of
Parts; where that Texture and Con|formation
of Parts is, and the Mate|rials
for forming the <HI>Gouty</HI> Humour is
&s;upply'd, there the <HI>Gout</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
be, without the Concurrence of
any other Di&s;temper: And where the&s;e
are not, there it cannot be, let the
Per&s;on be &s;ubjected to what other Di|&s;temper
&s;oever. And if a Per&s;on be
&s;ubjected to two Di&s;tempers, in the
Cure of the one, due regard is to be
had to the Cure of the other. What
has been &s;aid is all I intend at pre&s;ent
on this Subject.</P>
<P>XLV. For a concluding Ob&s;erva|tion,
we &s;hall take notice, as it is on|ly
the <HI>Rich,</HI> the <HI>Lazy,</HI> the <HI>Voluptuous,</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="111">
who &s;uffer mo&s;t by the <HI>Gout:</HI> (I mean
<HI>Acquir'd Gouts,</HI> and tho&s;e hereditary
ones enrag'd by <HI>Luxury</HI>) &s;o tho&s;e on|ly,
who have &s;pent their Life-time
under its Tortures be&s;t can tell, what
a&s;toni&s;hing Mi&s;eries <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI>
