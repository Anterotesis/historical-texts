<HEAD>THE Trade of <HI>BRITAIN</HI> &s;tated; BEING The Sub&s;tance of two Papers publi&s;hed in <HI>London</HI> On Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Importation of Wine and Brundy</HI> FROM North-Britain.</HEAD>
<P>I Know it is expected, I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething to the Sub&s;tance of this Que|&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Union cannot be broken&mdash;. And what do you mean by that now, <HI>&s;ays one,</HI> if the Parliament had pa&s;s'd the Draw-back Bill, had not the <HI>Union</HI> been broken? Did it not &s;trike at the Life and Soul of the Treaty, and directly infringe the fourth Article about a free Intercour&s;e of Trade?</P>
<P>This is an en&s;naring Que&s;tion, and I know very well the de&s;ign of the En|quirers, if po&s;&s;ible, to draw us into the Scandal of pleading for the Encroach|ments &s;ome Men wi&s;h to be made upon the Union, after it has &s;o long been $leading for the Benefits of the Union.</P>
<P><HI>Well Gentlemen,</HI> however, I will &s;peak my Mind frankly.</P>
<P>I have laid it down as a general The&s;is, that no Act of Parliament, however $ontrave$ning the Treaty, or incon&s;i&s;tent with it, could have broke the Uni|$n&mdash;I have but one Explanation, to add to that Head, <HI>viz.</HI> To lay down $hat I mean, <HI>by breaking</HI> the Union, and I'll be &s;hort enough in that; By break|$g, I mean di&s;&s;olving it, breaking it up, di&s;ingaging the Nations from the Ob|gations of it, and making it lawful for them to return to their re&s;pective for|mer
<PB N="2" REF="2">
Con&s;titutions; and tho' this &s;eems not immediatly to be meant in the pre&s;ent Clamours, yet I begin there, becau&s;e I know perhaps more of the Drift and De|&s;ign of &s;ome People in the&s;e things, than is known every where, and hear more than every Body hears, of what U&s;e is made of the&s;e things in the Argument, by the Enemies of the <HI>Union.</HI></P>
<P>I think it proper therefore to anticipat the wicked De&s;ign, by making it evi|dent, that the Treaty is e&s;tabli&s;hed on too &s;ure a Foundation for any Power yet formed on Earth to di&s;&s;ol ve or de&s;troy; and as this is very nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et right the Judgments of a great many, who are amus'd at the Clamours and Argu|ments of tho&s;e that are every moment rai&s;ing &s;cruples; &s;o tho&s;e who are better inform'd, ought to bear with what in&s;tructs others, tho it be u&s;ele&s;s to them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>But what is to be &s;aid to the Draw-back Bill?</P>
<P>In general I mu&s;t &s;ay, 'tis very hard, for <HI>Engli&s;h Britain,</HI> that it &s;hould not pa&s;s, and it would have been very hard for <HI>Scots Britain,</HI> if it had, I mean with|out Amendments; and I heartily wi&s;h &s;ome <HI>medium</HI> had been found out.</P>
<P>I have already explain'd my &s;elf as to the Wine and Brandy, that I think, the Clamour rais'd by the Merchants, has had a great deal of Management in it&mdash;And that very Clamour has really been more Damage to Trade, than the Subject could give Rea&s;on for; my Meaning is this, That had all the Wine and Brandy imported upon this Occa&s;ion into <HI>Scotland,</HI> been &s;ent directly into <HI>England,</HI> without Noi&s;e and Di&s;traction, it had not been &s;ufficient to have made any fall of Prices, or &s;top of Trade, and con&s;equently the Evil might have been born with; but 'tis the Clamour, the Noi&s;e, and the Artifice made u&s;e of with|out doors, has done the Damage to Trade&punc; and the Union is no way concern'd in that.</P>
<P>But after all, I do not &s;ay, it was no injury to <HI>England,</HI> GOD forbid I &s;hould $ither be &s;o partial, or &s;o unju&s;t, and I'll &s;tate the ju&s;t Di&s;tinction as &s;hort as I can.</P>
<P>I always &s;aid, it was a hard&s;hip upon <HI>England,</HI> both upon the QUEEN as to her Revenue, and upon the fair trading Merchant, and in that it was which I applauded, and ju&s;tly too, the Honour and Genero&s;ity of the QUEEN and Hou&s;e of Lords in rejecting the Bill; rather choo&s;ing to bear the Inconvenience, than make our <HI>Northern</HI> Brethren unea&s;ie.</P>
<P>But this did no way argue, that it was no Damage to <HI>England,</HI> no nor that it was not a very grievous Burthen, and when I &s;ay, <HI>bear it,</HI> as I would &s;till &s;ay if I were to proceed to particulars, I think it does not at all argue but they were in the right, who endeavour'd to find out a <HI>medium,</HI> that is, redre&s;s the Mi&s;chief and yet not wound the Union&mdash;Whether the <HI>medium</HI> propos'd was &s;uffici|ent or no, is none of my bu&s;ine&s;s to determine.</P>
<P>Had the Hou&s;e of Commons pa&s;s'd an Act univer&s;ally to &s;top the Importation from <HI>S$$land,</HI> without di&s;tinction or Re&s;erve, for the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I can
<PB N="3" REF="3">
not help &s;aying it had been in my Opinion a Contravention of the fourth Article, of the Union, <HI>Tho far from di&s;solving it as before;</HI> and 'tis a doubt with me, whe|ther it had been a legal Act, whether it could have pa&s;s'd, or had it been pa&s;s'd could have been obligatory to <HI>Britain;</HI> but that I leave undetermined.</P>
<P>But that <HI>England</HI> had a great deal of Rea&s;on, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible, and with Safety to the Union it could be done,</HI> to prevent the intolerable Frauds practis'd upon her, un|der the &s;helter of the Union, I can by no means doubt; and I think 'tis very nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the particulars of tho&s;e Frauds, that all the world may determine, whether there is rea&s;on for this Matter or not, and the Right di&s;tin|gui&s;hing on this Head will &s;horten out Di&s;pute, and bring us to &s;ome better Un|der&s;tanding among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I believe, no Man in the pro&s;pect of of the Treaty ever expcted or de&s;ir'd, that taking Advantage of a ca&s;ual Interval between the End of one Con&s;titution and the Beginning of another, <HI>Strangers, for &s;uch the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>were as well as the</HI> Dutch <HI>in the Ca&s;e before us,</HI> &s;hould come in with their Stocks, <HI>and with their Tricks too,</HI> to evade the Law, defraud the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, and invade the Cour&s;e of Trade.</P>
<P>I'll do <HI>Scotland</HI> that Ju&s;tice, they had no View of it, nor took any Steps to|wards it, nor do they now approve of it, or in general are Gainers by it.</P>
<P>That the Advance upon their own Goods might be in their View, is no Cheque to our Argument; it was to be expected it was their due, and it would never have been di&s;puted them, and it was both fore&s;een, and not di&s;puted: But that the whole Chain of Mi&s;chiefs which have follow'd, &s;hould be practi&s;ed, and the cheats of Trade &s;heltred under the Wings of the Treaty, I a&s;&s;ure you Gentlemen, as it was never fore&s;een, &s;o it was not intended by the <HI>Scots,</HI> nor are they at all pleas'd with the Attempt to make them the Tools of &s;o notorious a Fraud, or at all acce&s;&s;ary to it, or will be at all concern'd at any lawful Re&s;traint to be put upon it.</P>
<P>The Out-cry therefore, which is politickly rais'd, that the Stop of <HI>French</HI> Wines, Brandys, &amp;c. from <HI>Scotland</HI> will encroach upon the Union, is as poli|tickly carry'd on, 'tis thrown upon the <HI>Scots</HI> without any ground, and they will at any time make it appear they are clear of it; for give them but the free Liberty of their own Propertie, and the uninterrupted Intercour&s;e of Trade accor|ding to the 4<HI>th</HI> Article, I dare &s;ay upon all Occa&s;ions, they will renounce the having any hand in the &s;heltring the Frauds and clande&s;tine Trade of other Peo|ple, and al&s;o clear them&s;elves of having any hand in them.</P>
<P>Nor do I &s;peak this by &s;ugge&s;tion barely, but as I am daily conver&s;ant with the People I am &s;peaking of, and have it directly from their own Mouths; I hear them every day dete&s;ting the Frauds put upon the Government, under the Shadow and Protection of the Union, they are every day prote&s;ting they are clear, &s;o much as of any De&s;ign to have the Treaty &s;o improved, to the Damage of the publick, and the Lo&s;s of the fair Traders; and they think them&s;elves in+jur'd,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
(1.) in being &s;landred, with being the Contrivers and Abettors of &s;uch unfair, unju&s;t and di&s;hone&s;t a U&s;e, as is made of that Advantage by others, the Blame of which by common Fame &s;eems to lie at their Door, whereas generally &s;peaking they have no hand in it. (2.) They are injur'd in having the general Trade of <HI>Britain,</HI> of which they are now Sharers, and for which they are equally concern'd, injur'd by clande&s;tine unfair Trading. (3.) To have the End and Original De&s;ign of the free Intercour&s;e of Trade capitulated for in the Union, and mention'd in the 4<HI>th.</HI> Article of the Treaty, debauch'd from its true Original, <HI>viz.</HI> The Encouragement of <HI>Scots</HI> Men in improving, encrea&s;ing and advancing Commerce, and their Nation by it, into a Cover and Shelter for &s;ome of the wor&s;t Frauds that can be committed in Trade.</P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore I am clear in this; give the Subjects of <HI>North-Britain</HI> a free Communication, a free Intercour&s;e of Trade to the Ports, &amp;c. of <HI>South-Britain;</HI> and in this particular of the new import of <HI>French</HI> Goods, declare all their Goods, <HI>truly and bona fide,</HI> their own, and that have paid legal Cu&s;toms, free to be imported, and whatever legal Re&s;traints are put upon others, the <HI>Scots</HI> will immediatly declare them&s;elves unconcern'd, and very well plea&s;ed, &s;inee they never de&s;ign'd the Union to be a &s;helter to Fraud, under the colour of their Advantage.</P>
<P>I think I am oblig'd to clear <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Scotti&s;h Britain</HI> from acting in, or de|fending the Frauds which we complain of, and <HI>I</HI> think nothing can more rea|dily do it, than by &s;howing, which in all my Acquaintance among them is ge|neral, that they di&s;own any hand in it, and re&s;erving a Liberty of their own Properties, will be very well pleas'd to &s;ee <HI>England</HI> have ju&s;tice in the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> acknowledge, that this Paper in&s;i&s;ting &s;o much upon Frauds and Cheats put upon the QUEEN and the Government, and upon Trade in general in the <HI>South,</HI> by virtue of this Importation, it &s;eems natural to examine what they are; and how far <HI>I</HI> can call them Frauds, and my Rea&s;ons why <HI>I</HI> would have them &s;up|pre&s;s'd now, when <HI>I</HI> le&s;&s;en'd them, and cry'd out to have them born with before.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> &s;hall not fail to &s;top this Gap of Clamour, and by as near as <HI>I</HI> can, making proper Di&s;tinctions here, &s;eparate the clean and unclean; and &s;ee how far on one hand the <HI>North</HI> &s;hould not be re&s;train'd, or on the other the <HI>South</HI> be impos'd u|pon; and <HI>I</HI> make no Que&s;tion to reconcile all the&s;e things together, and if <HI>I</HI> do, it will not appear &s;o &s;trange a thing as &s;ome would have it be thought; that Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould mention it in Her Speech to the Parliament, that the QUEEN &s;hould recommend it to them to prevent the Inconveniences of it, or that the Par|liament &s;hould bring in a Bill to prevent them.</P>
<P>Upon the declaring the Union, and that it &s;hould take Effect the 1 <HI>&s;t</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> it was pre&s;ently vi&s;ible to all the World, that the <HI>Scots</HI> being to enjoy a free In|tercour&s;e of Trade, with the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> all Goods imported into <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the &s;aid 1 <HI>&s;t</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> and paying the lawful Cu&s;toms or Exci&s;es demand|ed there, fairly entred and di&s;charged, &s;hould from thenceforth, without any
<PB N="5" REF="5">
other Demand, Hindrance or Mole&s;tation, be freely admitted into all the Port of <HI>England;</HI> and of this I have given an Hi&s;torical Narration already.</P>
<P>'Tis without all Di&s;pute, that the true Intent and Meaning, and the onl true Intent and Meaning of this Article was, that the Subjects or Natives e the <HI>North</HI> Part of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;hould have a free Admi&s;&s;ion into all the Parts of th <HI>South,</HI> without any Payment, Taxation or Impo&s;ition, other than what the Paid them&s;elves: Or, to put this into directer Terms&mdash;That the Trade of <HI>North Britain</HI> &s;hould be entirely free in all Re&s;pects, as that of the <HI>South</HI>&mdash;And the Word <HI>free Intercour&s;e</HI> implies the very th ng I am upon.</P>
<P>Now I mu&s;t confe&s;s, tho' I have been pre&s;&s;ing <HI>England</HI> to bear the Inconveni|ences, yet I dare not &s;ay, that becau&s;e the literal Sence of this Article does give the <HI>South</HI> Part a Di&s;advantage, that therefore the Intent of the Law, and the true De&s;ign of the Legi&s;lators on both &s;ides, &s;hall not at all be regarded&mdash;In the Cour&s;e of our Law, we have a common Di&s;tinction of Right; there is a legal Right, and an equitable Right; common Law decides the fir&s;t, Chancery, <HI>which in Engli&s;h Acceptation is Con&s;cience,</HI> decides the la&s;t; where the Letter of the Law will in &s;trictne&s;s of its Ob&s;ervation out-&s;tretch the Intent of the Law, Con|&s;cience governs, and is a Regulation put upon legal Severity; this is that Se|verity, which is the Foundation of a known Maxim, <HI>Summum Jus Jumma in|juria,</HI> and in the Cour&s;e of Subordination, this Court of Con&s;cience is always &s;uperiour, and the equitable Right &s;hall at all times over-rule the legal.</P>
<P>I apply the Ca&s;e thus&mdash;'Tis true by the Letter of the Law, the <HI>Scots</HI> are to en|joy a full and free Intercour&s;e of Trade, that and literal Expre&s;&s;ion of a free &amp; full Intercour&s;e of Trade, between the Kingdoms, may, <HI>and I believe does,</HI> litterally in|clude, that all Goods legally imported into either, &s;hall be freely admitted into the other, let the Importers be who they will.</P>
<P>But now, Gentlemen, &s;hall the QUEEN have no Equity? &s;hall the Govern|ment have no Redre&s;s again&s;t Injury, where the Letter &amp; the Intention of the Law &s;eems to be &s;trained one again&s;t another? Shall there be no Court of Con|&s;cience erected between the Nations, in a thing that 'ts evident one &s;ide is in|jur'd in, and the other do not defend?&mdash;Shall the Union be &s;tretch't by de|&s;igning Knaves, and &s;hall hone&s;t Men be bound to protect them in it? This is a very hard Ca&s;e, and I think with Submi&s;&s;ion, leaves very great Rea&s;on for the Debate to have been brought into Parliament; <HI>of which heceafter.</HI></P>
<P>But I come to the Frauds.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Importation of Wine and Brandy, and other Goods, prohibited, or on which high Duties are payable in <HI>England</HI> by Per&s;ons not at all Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or concern'd before with the <HI>Scots</HI> Trade, and only with De&s;ign to tran&s;|port tho&s;e Goods into <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o defraud the Government there of tho&s;e high Duties, and put Money into their own Pockets. This is one of the Frauds.</P>
<P>Will any Man &s;ay, that this had its Foundation in the Intent and Meaning
<PB N="6" REF="6">
of the Law, and that it was &s;o de&s;ign'd on either the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Scots</HI> Side; that it was de&s;igned by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould thus be injur'd by; her own Subjects, under the Colour and Cover of the <HI>Scots</HI> free Intercour&s;e that it was de&s;ign'd by <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the Foreigners &s;hould, by the Advantage of the 4<HI>th Article,</HI> come and bring foreign Goods into <HI>Scotland,</HI> on purpo&s;e to cheat the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government of the Cu&s;toms?</P>
<P>If then this was not in the Intent and Meaning of the Union, where is the Fracture of the Treaty? If the <HI>Scots</HI> Freedom and Intercour&s;e of Trade being pre&s;erv'd, Laws were made in <HI>England</HI> to re&s;train and prevent tho&s;e Frauds of other People, who taking Advantage of the <HI>Letter of the Treaty,</HI> impo&s;ed upon both Kingdoms, contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of the Union in ge|neral.</P>
<P>This Way of Arguing is, I think, &s;o ju&s;t a Vindication of the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of Her Maje&s;ty's Speech to the Parliament&mdash;Moving them to con&s;ider <HI>how in the be&s;t Manner po&s;&s;ible to prevent the Inconveniences ari&s;ing to the Trade of</HI> England <HI>by the Interval between that Time and the</HI> 1&s;t <HI>of</HI> May; and of all the H. of commons did afterward, that I think, I need &s;ay no more at all to it.</P>
<P>Nor does this at all enter into the different Sentiments of either Hou&s;e, or do I le&s;&s;en the Ju&s;tice of one Hou&s;e, by applauding the Genero&s;ity of the other, and therefore &s;tating this Matter right, reconciles it all.</P>
<P>The QUEEN, moved by the Complaints of the Merchants, allarm'd at the Rumour, <HI>however politickly rais'd,</HI> of the va&s;t Importations into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the horrid Practices about Draw-backs, gives the Hou&s;es a Rece&s;s, and calls them together again to &s;ee, if po&s;&s;ible, the evil might have a Remedy; <HI>That is, to &s;ee if it might have a</HI> LEGAL REMEDY, not to prompt the Hou&s;es to make In|fractions into the Union, 'ts very Plain, that could not be the De&s;ign.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> H. <HI>of</HI> C&mdash;<HI>s fir&s;t vote the Grievance;</HI> That it is ruinous to the fair Trader, prejudicial to the <HI>QUEEN's</HI> Revenue, and de&s;tructive to the Trade of the Kingdom, <HI>or to that purpo&s;e; for at this Di&s;tance I have not the Votes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To remedy it,</HI> and yet pre&s;erve the Union too, they ob&s;erve, the true Intent and Meaning of the 4<HI>th</HI> Article was to give a free Intercour&s;e of Trade to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and accordingly they add a &s;aving Clau&s;e for the <HI>Scots,</HI> and then <HI>Enact</HI> again&s;t the other.&mdash;Here was no Manner of Inju&s;tice de&s;ign'd, but the equi|table Part of the Law con&s;idered, and a Di&s;tinction made between the Letter of the Law, and the true Intent and Meaning of it.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Lords, and therein I include al&s;o the QUEEN, tho' it did not per&s;onally and parliamentarily come before Her Maje&s;ty, taking this Method into their Con&s;ideration&mdash;They <HI>fir&s;t</HI> own the Equity and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Thing, and &s;end for the Judges to be farther &s;atisfied, if it might corre&s;pond with, or receive no Inconvenience from the Union; the Judges declining their Opinion, and the Matter &s;eeming doubtful, the Lords, in meer Genero&s;ity and Tenderne&s;s to the <HI>Scots,</HI> throw it out, choo&s;ing to leave <HI>England</HI> to &s;truggle as
<PB N="7" REF="7">
well as &s;he could with the Damage &s;u&s;tain d, than give the <HI>Scots</HI> the lea&s;t Shad|ow of Di&s;tru&s;t, that in doubful Ca&s;es it &s;hould be given again&s;t them, or that to &s;ave our &s;elves, we &s;hould venture to cla&s;h with the Treaty; and this I have been large upon already.</P>
<P>But pray take this with you, Gentlemen, that the Lords did by no means in this Proceding grant, that the&s;e Things were ju&s;t, that it was no In|jury to <HI>England,</HI> no Fraud, no u&s;ing the Union to an End it was on neither &s;ide de&s;ign'd for; they highly approv'd of this, that it was every thing the <HI>Com|mons</HI> had Voted it to be, and that if it could <HI>with &s;afety to the Union,</HI> it ought to be prevented, only they would not tread on the Brink of the Treaty, nor do the lea&s;t Thing, <HI>tho' just and in its Nature rea&s;onable,</HI> that &s;hould give any Jea|lou&s;ie to the <HI>Scots</HI> of their being di&s;regarded, or the Treaty being invaded.</P>
<P>Thus far I think, the Proceedings on both &s;ides have been ju&s;t, and I do not hear, I eonfe&s;s, &s;o much Clamour at the Proceedings of the H. of <HI>C.&mdash;s</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI> as I do from the <HI>South,</HI> which I take to proceed from this; that the Per&s;ons, who have committed the Frauds, live in the <HI>South,</HI> and 'tis natural to hear the Noi&s;e from that Part which feels the Smart.</P>
<P>If there has been any Complaint in the <HI>North,</HI> it proceeds from their Fears, and tho&s;e Fears are put into their Heads too, by fal&s;e Reports, and malicious Spreaders of Forgeries &amp; Sugge&s;tions; that their Intercour&s;e of Trade, <HI>literally theirs,</HI> &s;hall be &s;top't by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>&mdash;Pray, <HI>Gentlemen, mark it,</HI> I &s;ay again, the <HI>Scott</HI> make no Complaint of your taking all ju&s;t Methods to re&s;train the Frauds in Trade above-mentioned, they freely leave it to you, to do as your own Law will direct; they are not concerned what Tricks your Lawyers find out to pre|vent the foreign Importations,&mdash;but 'tis &s;topping their own Trade, their im|mediate free Intercour&s;e, and preventing the Import of the true and fair Effects of their own Property in Trade, <HI>which they are allarm'd at,</HI> and which the bu&s;ie and projectihg Enemies of the publiek Peace per&s;wade them you will do; this is their Grievance, and this the Ca&s;e in hand as to them.&mdash;For your own People, if the Law will pinch them, they &s;ay, <HI>do it with all their Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>I am now &s;peaking the Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing, not my own private Opinion, I &s;hall give you that after, as I have frankly done before, nor will I debate here the Authority, the very <HI>Letter of the Treaty</HI> ought to obtain, or whether it were not to be wi&s;h'd, the Grievance was not &s;o great, but it might be born with; that all Murmur and Complaint, however ill grounded, &s;hould be taken away on either &s;ide: But I confe&s;s the Di&s;ea&s;e is a great one, and the Cure very needful, and the Endeavours to cure it legally are &s;o much the more ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>And yet I am &s;till as I was ever of Opinion, the Grievance in the particular Article of Wine and Brandy is, as I &s;aid before, a meer Trifle compared to the Clamour has been rais'd upon it; and were there no other Grievance in it, were the Cu&s;toms of tho&s;e two Articles, all that is to be complain'd of, I
<PB N="8" REF="8" MS="Y">
&s;hould &s;till &s;ay, BEAR IT, to remove all the Noi&s;e and Clamour, that the E|nemies of the Union make about it.</P>
<P>If I am inform'd right, and I believe I am, di&s;counting the ordinary Expence of Wine and Brandy here in the <HI>North,</HI> where I a&s;&s;ure you, Gentlemen, the good People drink very heartily; and where the Nobility and Gentry have laid in great Stores of Clarret, &s;ome a Tun, &s;ome two, &s;ome three Tun of Clar|ret, and a Proportion of Brandy; di&s;counting this and the common Draft, I am clear in it, and have &s;een &s;ome of very good Judgment here concur with my Opinion, there cannot be 800 Tun of Wine &s;pared there to go for <HI>England;</HI> and a great Deal of that is a &s;mall thin Sort of Wine, which will not &s;uit the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Market, or bear a Price encouraging the Export; By the &s;ame Calcu|lation, I allow, about 1200 Tun of Brandy may be &s;ent into <HI>England;</HI> now if the whole of both Sorts, that is brought in, and that can be &s;pared, &s;hould be admitted into <HI>England,</HI> let it belong to whom it will, I am per&s;waded, it would not be worth the Clamour rais'd about it,</P>
<P>But the Grievance is not all here, <HI>I</HI> &s;hall enter into the other part of it in my next, and &s;o clo&s;e this Matter.</P>
