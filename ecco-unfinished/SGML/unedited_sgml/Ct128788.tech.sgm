<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE long ago thought that the
fir&s;t principles and rules of the
method of Fluxions &s;tood in need of
a more full and di&s;tinct explana|tion
and proof, than what they
had received either from their fir&s;t
incomparable author, or any of his followers; and
therefore was not at all di&s;plea&s;ed to find the me|thod
it&s;elf oppo&s;ed with &s;o much warmth by the
ingenious author of the <HI>Analy&s;t;</HI> and had it been
his only de&s;ign to bring this point to a fair i&s;&s;ue, whether a demon&s;tration by the method of Fluxions
be truly &s;cientific or not, I &s;hould have heartily
applauded his conduct, and have thought he de&s;er|ved
the thanks even of the Mathematicians them|&s;elves.
But the invidious light in which he has
put this debate, by repre&s;enting it as of con&s;equence
to the intere&s;ts of religion, is, I think, truly unju&s;ti|fiable,
as well as highly imprudent. Among all
wi&s;e and fair inquirers, 'tis beyond all contradi|ction
plain, that religion can be no ways affected
by the truth or fal&s;hood of the doctrine of <HI>Fluxions.</HI>
And tho' prejudiced minds may be variou&s;ly affected
by it, yet it is not ea&s;y to be conceived what advan|tage
this debate is likely to give to the cau&s;e of
religion and virtue in general even among them.
Whereas it is ea&s;y to gue&s;s of what di&s;&s;ervice our author's repre&s;entation of a controver&s;y in which
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
religion has no manner of concern, may be towards
rai&s;ing and inflaming the pa&s;&s;ions of weak men on
both &s;ides of the que&s;tion: And I wi&s;h he had been
plea&s;ed coolly to con&s;ider beforehand of what con&s;e|quence
the re&s;ult of this di&s;pute is likely to be to the
cau&s;e of religion, among tho&s;e for who&s;e conviction
his <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> is chiefly de&s;igned. If he &s;hould not be
able to make out his point, will not the blind fol|lowers
of the Infidel Mathematicians be more con|firmed
in their errors than they were before? Will
they not be more prejudiced again&s;t religion, and
e&s;tabli&s;hed in their e&s;teem and veneration of their
ma&s;ters by a weak and fruitle&s;s attempt to depre&s;s
their characters; and by finding that a zeal for it
has occa&s;ioned &s;o &s;trong an attempt to wound the
reputation of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> Newton as a cautious and
fair rea&s;oner? And on the other hand, if our au|thor
&s;hould carry his point, and his proofs &s;hould be
allowed, that the doctrine of Fluxions is an incom|prehen&s;ible
my&s;tery, and that the mo&s;t accurate
Mathematicians have, one after another, impo&s;ed
upon them&s;elves in the mo&s;t egregious manner, by
fal&s;e and inconclu&s;ive rea&s;onings, what con&s;equences
can we &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch per&s;ons will draw from
the&s;e premi&s;es? Our Author indeed would have
them only from hence make this one conclu&s;ion, That
their ma&s;ters, the Mathematicians, are not to be
depended upon when they &s;peak again&s;t religion.
But I believe it can't in rea&s;on be expected that
they &s;hould &s;top here.</P>
<P>If &s;uch men as Dr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> Dr. <HI>Clarke,</HI> &amp;c.
and the incomparable Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> were
capable of imagining that they &s;aw with the greate&s;t
clearne&s;s and per&s;picuity, where they had, nothing
but ab&s;olute and incomprehen&s;ible darkne&s;s before
them, what conclu&s;ion will per&s;ons, u&s;ed to take
their opinions from authority, be likely to make
<PB N="v" REF="4">
from the&s;e premi&s;es, but that all pretences to know|ledge
in religion, and every thing e&s;fe, are only
confidence and pre&s;umption?</P>
<P>If they are taught that it is incon&s;i&s;tent for a
per&s;on to reject the my&s;teries of religion, and yet be|lieve
the my&s;tery of Fluxions, will they not know
how to draw the oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion them&s;elves, that
it is incon&s;i&s;tent to reject the doctrine of Fluxions
becau&s;e my&s;terious, and yet receive the my&s;teries of
religion? And<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Defence of Freethinking, <HI>p,</HI> 62.</NOTE> when they are taught to think that
a per&s;on may be <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> &s;aid to have faith, becau&s;e
they give into what they can neither demon&s;trate
nor <HI>conceive;</HI> if this give them a mean opinion of
the Mathematicians, 'tis odds if it don't give them
a mean opinion of faith it&s;elf. I am &s;ure 'tis a very
&s;trange account of that which may ju&s;tly be called
faith: For without clear notions no man can be|lieve
any more than demon&s;trate.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the&s;e things, I can't help thinking
it was highly wrong to bring religion at all into
this controver&s;y, which may inflame the di&s;pute,
but can hardly do any real &s;ervice: Of which, to
me, it is a very &s;trong pre&s;umption, that every
thing urged by the author of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> again&s;t
Infidels in general, would have &s;ounded full as well
in the mouth of a Papi&s;t, if urged again&s;t tho&s;e
Mathematicians that don't believe the doctrine of
Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, as it would have been peculi|arly
in character for &s;uch a one to have made his
chief attack upon a great enemy of all &s;uper&s;tition
and tyranny, and an hearty friend to the rea&s;ona|ble
religion of Chri&s;tians and Prote&s;tants. But
enough of this. I &s;hall now con&s;ider my &s;ubject as
&s;tript of all relation it has to religion, and merely
as a matter of human &s;cience, and endeavour to
&s;hew that the method of Fluxions is founded upon
clear and &s;ub&s;tantial principles.</P>

<HEAD>SECT I.</HEAD>
<P>_IT cannot be doubted but that
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> well under|&s;tood
the doctrine of which he was the
original inventor; and
his proofs of it are very far
from being fallacious and de|ceitful,
or their force hard to be
under&s;tood by tho&s;e that are u&s;ed to the&s;e kinds
of &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>BUT it is al&s;o very plain, that the que&s;tion,
which is the main di&s;pute between our author
and his adver&s;aries, whether Mathematicians
take the notion and certainty of the method of
Fluxions implicitly from him or not, does not
depend upon our being able to defend the exact
accuracy of the demonstrations he has made u&s;e
of, and the propriety of every phra&s;e by which
he has explained his notions upon this head.
He always &s;eems to have &s;tudied conci&s;ene&s;s of
expre&s;&s;ion, and to depend on the good &s;en&s;e
and judgment of his reader. And on this ac|count
&s;ome of his demon&s;trations are not the
mo&s;t full and compleat that might be given,
and mu&s;t remain ob&s;cure to tho&s;e who have no
genius for the mathematical &s;cience, and can't
find out tho&s;e &s;teps in a demon&s;tration, which a
writer often omits in confidence of the &s;agacity
of his reader. In my opinion this is in &s;ome
mea&s;ure the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to his proofs of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
the fir&s;t principles of Fluxions, and therefore I
don't wonder per&s;ons differ in their &s;entiments
about them. But it is truly provoking to find
that the greate&s;t genius that ever appeared in
the philo&s;ophical world, and one whom the
lovers of knowledge mu&s;t always think of with
re&s;pect and gratitude, &s;hould be repre&s;ented
contrary to his known character, as craftily
impo&s;ing on the world, in confidence of his
own authority, and the ob&s;curity of his &s;ubject.
And therefore I would hope that the author of
the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> did not de&s;ign that &s;evere reflection
his words &s;eem to carry with them, when he
&s;ays, &startq;Such rea&s;oning as this, nothing but the
ob&s;curity of the &s;ubject could have <HI>encoura|ged</HI>
or <HI>induced</HI> the great author of the fluxio|nary
method <HI>to have put upon</HI> his followers;
and nothing but an <HI>implicit</HI> deference to his
authority could have moved them to admit. &endq;
To &s;u&s;pect Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> of the mean de&s;ign
of &s;eeking reputation among the ignorant, by
venting unintelligible notions, and defending
them by artful and cunning &s;ophi&s;try, is what
I think no man is capable of doing. And there|fore
if the author of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> does not think
fit, for his own reputation, to revoke or ex|plain
the &s;entence ju&s;t mentioned, it needs not a
particular confutation. Nor do I propo&s;e parti|cularly
to follow him in all the objections he has
made again&s;t Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s notions and demon&s;tra|tions,
being of opinion that the be&s;t way of an|&s;wering
him is to a&s;&s;i&s;t per&s;ons in under&s;tand|ing
the &s;ubject it&s;elf; for if any one can do this,
he will ea&s;ily &s;ee there is little weight in what he
has &s;aid again&s;t it. However, as I go along, I
&s;hall endeavour to obviate any thing that I
think may create a difficulty; but my main
<PB N="9" REF="8">
view is to &s;ettle the fir&s;t principles on which
the doctrine of Fluxions depends, and then to
&s;hew that, by ju&s;t rea&s;oning from them, the
rules for finding the Fluxions of equations, as
delivered by Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> do truly follow.</P>
<P>THE notion of Fluxions was originally
gained by the ob&s;ervation of quantities being
de&s;cribed by a continual motion; and the me|thod
of Fluxions was de&s;igned to do the&s;e two
things. I&s;t, From the magnitude of a quantity
continually changing being given, to find out
the rate or velocity according to which the
quantity it&s;elf continually increa&s;es or decrea&s;es.
And, <HI>2dly,</HI> From this latter continually given,
to find the former.</P>
<P>WHERE you &s;ee the main thing taken for
granted is this</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>POSTULATE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Quantities may be &s;uppo&s;ed as continually changing,
&s;o as every di&s;tinct in&s;tant of time to be different
from what they were before.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ILLUSTRATION.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH quantities are the following, Time from
a given hour, the di&s;tance of a body from a
plane to or from which it moves, the amount
of money lent out at intere&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> However,
it is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Mathematician to
di&s;pute whether quantities do in fact ever vary
in the manner that is &s;uppo&s;ed, but only whe|ther
the notion of their &s;o doing be intelligible;
which being allowed, he has a right to take it
for granted, and then to &s;ee what deductions he
can make from that &s;uppo&s;ition. It is not the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
bu&s;ine&s;s of a Mathematician to &s;how that a &s;trait
line or circle can be drawn, but he tells you
what he means by the&s;e; and if you under&s;tand
him, you may proceed farther with him; and
it wou'd not be to the purpo&s;e to object that
there is no &s;uch thing in nature as a true &s;trait
line or perfect circle, for this is none of his con|cern:
he is not inquiring how things are in mat|ter
of fact, but &s;uppo&s;ing things to be in a cer|tain
way, what are the con&s;equences to be de|duced
from them; and all that is to be demand|ed
of him is, that his &s;uppo&s;itions are intelligi|ble,
and his inferences ju&s;t from the &s;uppo&s;itions
he makes. In the ca&s;e before us, Whether
quantities in fact do ever vary in the manner
before explained, or not, is nothing to the pur|po&s;e,
but whether the notion of their &s;o doing
be intelligible; and that it is &s;o is plain, be|cau&s;e
tho' this &s;hould not be fact in any ca&s;e,
yet in a great many it &s;eems to us &s;o to be
When a &s;tone falls to the ground, the line it
de&s;cribes &s;eems continually to increa&s;e; nor can
I avoid the &s;ame &s;entiment when I de&s;cribe a
circle or any other line upon a paper. And it
may as well be pretended that the letters I now
write con&s;i&s;t of a number of di&s;tinct and &s;eparate
dots, and no continued lines, as that each of
them does not &s;eem to be formed by a continued
motion. Now if I really think I &s;ee quantities
formed by a continued motion, it is plain that
this &s;ort of increa&s;e is not unintelligible, and
therefore may be &s;uppo&s;ed by the Mathemati|cian.
The reader perhaps may here think that
I intend to obviate an objection that even the
author of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> him&s;elf would never make;
but I mu&s;t own my &s;u&s;picion of the contrary,
becau&s;e I think he can't allow of &s;uch &s;ort of
<PB N="11" REF="10">
increa&s;e, without giving up his cau&s;e, and al|lowing
me a right to make this farther</P>

<P>FOR if quantities may increa&s;e or decrea&s;e &s;o
as to be different every di&s;tinct in&s;tant of time

they mu&s;t change at a certain rate either fixed or
variable, it being impo&s;&s;ible that a man &s;hou'd
conceive of a quantity continually changing,
without knowing that it mu&s;t either alter at the
&s;ame rate always, or el&s;e &s;ometimes fa&s;ter, and
at other times &s;lower; <HI>i. e.</HI> he can't do this without
knowing what Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> means when he
defines the Fluxion of a quantity to be the velo|city
or &s;wiftne&s;s with which the quantity changes
its magnitude: And the Fluxion of a quantity
cannot be an unintelligible notion, when it ne|ce&s;&s;arily
ari&s;es from a plain and ea&s;y &s;uppo&s;ition.
Nay, I am very well &s;atisfied that our author
him&s;elf mu&s;t have a notion both of a fir&s;t and
&s;econd Fluxion. if he at all under&s;tands him&s;elf,
when he &s;uppo&s;es <HI>a line de&s;cribed by the motion of
a point continually accelerated.</HI> At lea&s;t I am &s;ure

the quantity generated, or the change made by
the uniform or permanent Fluxion to the quan|tity
generated, or the change made by the con|tinually

<PB N="18" REF="17">
the ratio of the Fluxion of the former is to
the Fluxion of the latter at the beginning of the
time, and greater than the ratio which the Flu|xions
are in to one another at the end of the
time.</P>
<P><HI>Axiom</HI> 5. BUT if, other things being &s;uppo|&s;ed
the &s;ame, the latter Fluxion continually
decrea&s;e, the ratio of the quantity generated, or
the change made by the uniform or permanent
Fluxion to the quantity generated, or the change
made by the continually decrea&s;ing Fluxion,
will be always greater than the ratio of the Flu|xion
of the former is to the Fluxion of the lat|ter
at the beginning of the time, and le&s;s than
the ratio of the Fluxion of the former to the
Fluxion of the latter at the end of the time.
Both the&s;e axioms are plain con&s;equences from
this obvious truth, that if any thing increa&s;e
with an accelerated velocity or &s;wiftne&s;s, the
increa&s;e made in a given time will be greater than
if it had all along increa&s;ed with the &s;ame &s;wift|ne&s;s
it did at the beginning, and le&s;s than if
it had all along increa&s;ed with the &s;wiftne&s;s it
did at the end of it; and that the contrary will
happen if the velocity be continually retarded.
And the reader will plea&s;e to take notice, that
as the foregoing axioms are the &s;ole principles
on which the doctrine of Fluxions is built, &s;o
they were generally allowed, before this doctrine
was ever thought of, in relation to the velocities
of moving bodies, and the &s;paces de&s;cribed
by their motion. The only thing new in this
ca&s;e is, that the idea of velocity is render'd
more general, and, in order to prevent ambi|guity,
the word Fluxion has been &s;ub&s;tituted in
the room of it: but &s;till the &s;ame general notion
is pre&s;erved; for as velocity, at lea&s;t in its more
<PB N="19" REF="18">
u&s;ual &s;en&s;e, &s;ignifies the degree of quickne&s;s with which
a body changes its &s;ituation in re&s;pect of &s;pace, &s;o the
Fluxion of a quantity &s;ignifies the degree of quickne&s;s
with which the quantity changes its magnitude. Why
then is the notion of a Fluxion harder to be under&s;tood
than that of a velocity? Why may not we make u&s;e of
the &s;ame axioms in relation to one, which all the world
allows in relation to the other? Surely &s;ome rea&s;on
ought to be a&s;&s;igned of the difference between the two
ca&s;es; or it is not fair to make tho&s;e things peculiar
objections again&s;t the notion of Fluxions, which equal|ly
affect the notion of velocities. And I am apt to
think that the reader is mi&s;taken, if he imagines that
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> is peculiarly attacked in the objections
of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> on this head, and not the common &s;en&s;e
of mankind both before and &s;ince his time. And what
good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why the common notions
of all mankind are repre&s;ented as the peculiar blunders
of Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and his followers, it is not ea&s;y to determine.
As to the &s;econd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Fluxions, there may, I allow,
&s;eem to be &s;ome peculiar difficulty in them to per&s;ons
that are not u&s;ed to the&s;e &s;ubjects; but it &s;eems to me
great weakne&s;s to imagine that there can be any pecu|liar
objections again&s;t them, becau&s;e tho' the farther
we go in the orders of Fluxions, our ideas become
more and more complex, yet no new &s;imple ideas are
admitted. And when our author a&s;&s;erts, that in order
to conceive of a &s;econd Fluxion, we mu&s;t conceive of
the velocity of a velocity, and that this is non&s;en&s;e; he
plainly appeals to the &s;ound and not the &s;en&s;e of words.
When velocity is con&s;idered only as an affection of mo|tion,
the velocity of a velocity is non&s;en&s;e. But then
this is not the notion of a &s;econd Fluxion; and if by
inlarging the idea of velocity, you make it &s;ynonymous
to the word <HI>Fluxion,</HI> then the velocity
of a velocity, however oddly it may &s;ound, is nothing but plain com|mon
&s;en&s;e. For the degree of quickne&s;s with which any
quantity increa&s;es, may vary to greater or le&s;s with any
<PB N="20" REF="19">
degree of quickne&s;s imaginable; and this la&s;t is called
the &s;econd Fluxion of the quantity. Now if the author
of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> can &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of this notion, he
is welcome &s;o to do; but let him not fir&s;t dre&s;s it up in
an ambiguous phra&s;e, and then think to confute it by
laughing at his own way of under&s;tanding that phra&s;e.</P>

But I would here ob&s;erve, that whatever fal&s;e

con&s;idered as velocities, it does not at all
affect the general method; as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>

Fluxions we may make u&s;e of any other finite
quantities found out from the la&s;t ratio of the
&s;ynchronal increments or decrements of Flowing
Quantities; and therefore the Author of the <HI>Ana|ly&s;t</HI>
hardly acted the part of a fair adver&s;ary, in
making &s;uch a pother about the notion of Flu|xions
as incomprehen&s;ible, &s;ince if he had not
been able to under&s;tand them, he might have
made u&s;e of any other quantities he did under|&s;tand
in their &s;tead. I don't &s;ay this as if I
thought there were any difficulty in the notion
of Fluxions thus con&s;idered; I am on the con|trary
very po&s;itive that no man can make any
objection again&s;t a velocity of increa&s;e or de|crea&s;e
in general, that will not as &s;trongly lie
again&s;t a velocity of motion. If quantities may
increa&s;e fa&s;ter or flower, as well as bodies move
fa&s;ter or flower, there is no greater impropriety
in &s;aying that one quantity increa&s;es with a
greater velocity than another, than in &s;aying
that one body moves with a greater velocity
than another. But tho' I think there is no dif|faculty
in the notion of Fluxions con&s;ider'd as
velocities, yet in order to under&s;tand equations
where Fluxions of different orders are jumbled
together, it would be convenient to repre&s;ent all
Fluxions not as before, but as quantities of the
&s;ame kind with their Fluents; and therefore I
&s;hould chu&s;e to do it, were I to write a treati&s;e
on this &s;ubject: And this may be done in the
following manner. Take <HI>Defin.</HI> 1, and <HI>Axiom</HI> 2
for the two fir&s;t definitions: Define al&s;o ulti|mate
<PB N="35" REF="34">
ratio as before, and then proceed thus:
<HI>Defin,</HI> 4. The Fluxion of an uniformly flowing
quantity is the change made in it in a certain
given time. <HI>Defin.</HI> 5. The Fluxion of a quan|tity
any how flowing at any given in&s;tant, is a
quantity found out by taking it to the Fluxion
of an uniformly flowing quantity in the ultimate
proportion of tho&s;e &s;ynchronal changes which
then vani&s;h. And con&s;idering Fluxions in this
light, all the u&s;es might be made of them as
are done under the foregoing notion. But I go
on to what the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> gives me more occa&s;ion
to take notice of. I might have proved from
what went before, that the Fluxion of <HI>x</HI> is to
that of <HI>x</HI>^n, as I to <HI>nx</HI>^n^-^1 But for the fake of
ju&s;tifying Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> I &s;hall now take his
method.</P>
<P>LET <HI>x</HI> increa&s;e uniformly, and 'tis propo&s;ed
to find the Fluxion of <HI>x</HI>^n.</P>
<P>WHILST <HI>x</HI> by flowing becomes <GAP DESC="MATH">

no more nor le&s;s than this does Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> mean

<P>FOR tho', &s;trictly &s;peaking, it &s;hould be al|lowed
that there is no la&s;t proportion of vani&s;h|ing
quantities, yet on this account no fair and
candid reader wou'd find fault with Sir <HI>I&s;aac
Newton,</HI> for he has &s;o plainly de&s;cribed the pro|portion
he calls by this name, as &s;ufficiently to

that the amount of all objections again&s;t the ju|&s;tice
of his method in finding out the la&s;t propor|tion
of vani&s;hing quantities, can ari&s;e to little
more than this, that he has no right to call the
proportion he finds out according to this method
by that name, which &s;ure mu&s;t be egregious
trifling. However, as on this head our author
&s;eems to talk with more than u&s;ual confidence
of the advantage he has over his opponents, and
<PB N="37" REF="36">
gives us what he &s;ays is the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Analy&s;t,</HI> p. 21.</NOTE> amount of S^r <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s
rea&s;oning in a truly ridiculous light, it will be
proper to &s;ee on whom the laugh ought to fall,
for I am &s;ure &s;omebody mu&s;t here appear
&s;trangely ridiculous. His arguings and illu&s;tra|tions
founded on<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 20.</NOTE> the <HI>Lemma</HI> he propo&s;es as
&s;elf-evident, I think I have no occa&s;ion to med|dle
with, becau&s;e I readily allow whatever con|&s;equence
he is plea&s;ed to draw from it, if it app|ears
that Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> in order to find the la&s;t
ratio's propo&s;ed, was obliged to make two in|con&s;i&s;tent
&s;uppo&s;itions. To confute which no|thing
more need be &s;aid than barely to relate
the &s;uppo&s;itions he did make.</P>
<P>1. THEN he &s;uppo&s;es that <HI>x</HI> by increa&s;ing be|comes
<GAP DESC="MATH">, and from hence he deduces the
relation of the increments of <HI>x</HI> and x^n.</P>
<P>2. AGAIN; in order to find the la&s;t ratio of
the increments vani&s;hing, he<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That what is here made the &s;econd &s;uppo&s;ition, is truly the meaning of <HI>Evane&s;cant jam augmenta illa</HI> in Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> is very plain from the manner in which he &s;uppo&s;es quantities to vani&s;h throughout the <HI>Introduction to the Quadratures.</HI></NOTE> &s;uppo&s;es 0 to de|crea&s;e
till it vani&s;hes, or becomes equal to no|thing.
Be&s;ides the&s;e he makes no other &s;uppo|&s;itions,
and the&s;e are evidently no more incon|&s;i&s;tent
and contradictory, than to &s;uppo&s;e a man
&s;hould fir&s;t go up &s;tairs, and then come down
again. To &s;uppo&s;e the increments to be &s;ome|thing
and nothing at the &s;ame time, is contra|dictory;
but to &s;uppo&s;e them fir&s;t to exi&s;t, and
then to vani&s;h, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent; nor will
the con&s;equences drawn from the &s;uppo&s;ition of
their prior exi&s;tence, if ju&s;t, be any ways affected
by the &s;uppo&s;ition of their &s;ub&s;equent vani&s;hing,
becau&s;e the truth of the latter &s;uppo&s;ition no
<PB N="38" REF="37">
ways contradicts the truth of the former. To
make this more plain, con&s;ider what is made
out from each &s;uppo&s;ition: from the fir&s;t that
<HI>x</HI> has increa&s;ed by 0, this con&s;equence is drawn,
that the proportion between the increments of
<HI>x</HI> and <HI>x</HI>^n, <HI>&s;o long as they exi&s;t,</HI> may be expre&s;&s;ed
by that of 1 to <GAP DESC="MATH">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if 0
always expre&s;s the increment of <HI>x.</HI> And this
con&s;equence is no ways affected by &s;uppo&s;ing
0 continually to decrea&s;e, and at length to vani&s;h.
But from this la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition we may gather,
that the le&s;&s;er 0 is, &s;o much the nearer the ratio
of 1 to <HI>nx^n^-^1</HI> comes to the ratio of the incre|ments;
and that by a continual diminution of
0, it may come as near to it as you plea&s;e, but
can never equal it before 0 quite vani&s;hes; and
therefore this ratio, and no other what&s;oever,
agrees to the de&s;cription which Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> has gi|ven
of the ultimate ratio of the vani&s;hing incre|ments.
His conclu&s;ion therefore comes out
without the &s;uppo&s;ition of any thing incon&s;i&s;tent.
And our Author, by his way of objecting, &s;eems
to make no di&s;tinction between two oppo&s;ite
things being; done at the &s;ame time, and their
being done at different ones; between a line's
being drawn, and then rubbed out; and lines
&s;uppo&s;ed to be drawn, and not drawn at all;
as will appear &s;till farther by con&s;idering his
objection again&s;t the way of finding out the
ordinate of a curve from the area and ab&s;ci&s;&s;e
being perpetually given (which is a problem
analogous to that of finding the Fluxion from
the Fluent perpetually given, and) which I
&s;hall now repre&s;ent &s;omewhat more di&s;tinctly
than he has done, and then con&s;ider his obje|ction
again&s;t it.</P>

<P>LET the area <HI>A B C = A,</HI> the

conclude that when <HI>x = b,</HI> &s;ince then <HI>z = k,</HI> that

the equation <HI>yq = x^2 + b^2</HI> mu&s;t degenerate
into this, <GAP DESC="MATH"> which gives me the relation
of the ordinate and ab&s;ciffe. W. W. F.</P>
<P>Now in this way of rea&s;oning, &s;ays, our Au|thor,
there is a direct fallacy; becau&s;e, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> we
are obliged to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>b</HI> and <HI>x</HI> are unequal,
without which we could not proceed one &s;tep;
and, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that they
are equal, which is a manife&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency.
But cannot &s;o accurate a rea&s;oner as our Author di&s;tingui&s;h between different; times? To &s;uppo&s;e
<GAP DESC="MATH"> and <HI>b</HI> equal and unequal at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="40" REF="39">
would have been an incon&s;i&s;tency, but to &s;up|po&s;e
them fir&s;t unequal, and afterwards to be|come
equal, has not the &s;hadow of difficulty in
it. And there is nothing wonderful in it, that
from the &s;uppo&s;ition of both the&s;e things hap|pening
one after another, I can deduce a con|clu&s;ion
which would not follow from either &s;up|po&s;ition
&s;ingly taken; and that the conclu&s;ion
I have drawn is ju&s;t, will appear to any one
that con&s;iders what is di&s;tinctly made out in each
&s;tep of the demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>BY taking <HI>x</HI> different from <HI>b,</HI> I find this
equation, <HI>yq = x^2 + xb + b^2,</HI> and ob&s;erve it
holds true of whatever magnitude <HI>x</HI> be taken;
the meaning of which may be thus expre&s;&s;ed in
words at length: There always is a line greater
than one and le&s;s than the other of the two
quantities <HI>k</HI> and <HI>z,</HI> &s;o long as they remain different
which multiplied by <HI>q</HI> is always grea|ter
than one, and le&s;s than the other of the two
quantities <HI>3 x^2</HI> and <HI>3 b^2.</HI> Now this propo&s;ition
is always true whatever becomes of <HI>x</HI> afterwards,
and from it I infer that at the time when <HI>x = b,</HI>
and <HI>k = z, kq</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o be equal to <HI>3 b^2.</HI> The
force of which inference depends upon this plain
axiom, That if &s;o long as two quantities remain
different, a third be always greater than one
and le&s;s than the other of them, as &s;oon as by a
continued increa&s;e or decrea&s;e any two of the&s;e
quantities become equal, all three of them mu&s;t
be equal. The truth of which, were there any
manner of occa&s;ion for it, might ea&s;ily be made
out by reducing the contrary po&s;ition to an ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>IN what has been &s;aid, I have de&s;ignedly ta|ken
notice only of tho&s;e objections of the inge|nious
author of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> which relate to the
<PB N="41" REF="40">
doctrine of Fluxions; as for the differential
method of <HI>Leibnitz,</HI> I do not undertake its de|fence,
becau&s;e I think the notion of Fluxions
con&s;idered as velocities, or rather as finite quan|tities
of the &s;ame kind with their Fluents, as
before de&s;cribed, is much more ea&s;ily conceiva|ble,
and frees from difficulty. Nay, I mu&s;t
confe&s;s there &s;eems to me to be &s;ome objection
again&s;t con&s;idering quantities as generated from
moments. What moments, what the <HI>principia
jamjam na&s;centia finitarum qutantitatum,</HI> are in
them&s;elves, I own, I don't under&s;tand; I can't,
I am &s;ure, ea&s;ily conceive what a quantity is
before it comes to be of &s;ome bigne&s;s or other;
and therefore moments con&s;idered as parts of
the quantities who&s;e moments they are, or as
really fixed and determinate quantities of any
kind, are beyond my comprehen&s;ion, nor do I
indeed think that Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> him&s;elf did
thus con&s;ider them. But when he &s;ays, for in|&s;tance,
that the moment of <HI>A^2</HI> is equal to the
moment of <HI>A</HI> into twice <HI>A,</HI> his meaning is
only this, that if the increment of <HI>A</HI> be con|tinually
dimini&s;hed, the proportion between
that into <HI>A,</HI> and the corre&s;pondent increment
of <HI>A^2</HI> will approach towards, and at length
come nearer to, a ratio of equality than by any
a&s;&s;ignable difference. And thus under&s;tanding
him, the proportion of moments is a phra&s;e ea|&s;ily
intelligible, and his meaning very evident
in every &s;entence where he u&s;es it, altho', with
me, you can't imagine what a moment in it&s;elf
is. 'Tis true indeed, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, it
may not be agreeable to the exact accuracy of
language, to &s;peak of moments as if they were
real intelligible quantities; but I am &s;ure this is
<PB N="42" REF="41">
all that can ju&s;tly be objected again&s;t it, and
that there is no fal&s;e logic or metaphy&s;ics in it.
Whether I have here &s;poke the &s;en&s;e of S^r <HI>I&s;aac</HI>
him&s;elf, or not, I won't be po&s;itive, and mu&s;t
leave it to the judgment of the reader conver&s;ant
in his works; but I think he has given us inti|mation
&s;ufficiently plain, that we may at lea&s;t
thus interpret him if we plea&s;e, he being not at
all &s;olicitous under what notion we con&s;ider mo|ments,
whil&s;t we take their proportions in that
manner he directs us.</P>
<P>OUR Author may perhaps think him&s;elf
not fairly u&s;ed, that there has been no more
notice taken of &s;econd and third <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Flu|xions
in this treati&s;e, but it is to no purpo&s;e
to defend the&s;e before the objections again&s;t
the fir&s;t are given up; and if the fir&s;t are well
under&s;tood, there is no manner of difficulty in
the other, except what ari&s;es from this con&s;ide|ration,
that our ideas become &s;omewhat more
complex as we go on to the higher orders of
Fluxions. However I &s;hall mention one thing
for the &s;ake of young beginners in this &s;cience.
Suppo&s;e <HI>y^2 = x,</HI> and <HI>y</HI> flows uniformly, then,
according to the method of Fluxions, 2<HI>y&cmbdot;</HI> = x,
and 2y^2 = x$, it may be inquired what is the
meaning of tills equation taking Fluxion in the
notion of velocity, &s;ince upon that &s;uppo&s;ition
fir&s;t and &s;econd Fluxions are quantities of differ|rent
kinds, and therefore have no proportion to
one another? To this I an&s;wer, that the only
meaning of the equation is, that if you take the
<PB N="43" REF="42">
value of 2y&cmbdot;^2 and $xU at two different times, the
2y^2 are in the &s;ame proportion to one another
that the $xU's are. And in like manner are equa|tions
always to be under&s;tood which involve
quantities of different &s;orts; they don't expre&s;s
the proportion of heterogeneous quantities to
one another, but of different values of homoge|neous
quantities among them&s;elves. And from
hence our Author may, if he plea&s;es, receive
an an&s;wer to the latter part of his thirty-fir&s;t
query, an odd query, &s;urely, to be made by
one that pretends to an&s;wer Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton:</HI>
But &s;everal of this kind are to be met with,
which &s;hew greater prejudice again&s;t the Ma|thematicians,
than knowledge of the principles
which they maintain. And I can't help ob&s;er|ving,
that tho' our Author profe&s;&s;es the utmo&s;t
caution as to what he admits as true, and a con|cern
for the utmo&s;t accuracy in rea&s;oning, yet
neither the one nor the other appears when he
is making his objections again&s;t the Mathema|ticians.
Of this I &s;hould not have taken any
notice, if his de&s;ign had only been to correct
&s;ome mi&s;taken notions among the Mathemati|cians;
but as his intention is evidently to run
down their method of rea&s;oning, and to repre|&s;ent
them as Bigots and Enthu&s;ia&s;ts in their own
&s;cience, it is but a piece of ju&s;tice to them to
&s;hew that their adver&s;ary is as inaccurate in his
rea&s;onings, and as incautious in his a&s;&s;ertions,
and in forming his accu&s;ations, as any of them
can be. Of this the reader may have already
ob&s;erved &s;ome in&s;tances, and I &s;hall beg his pa|tience
whil&s;t I mention one or two more.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43">
1. HE urges again&s;t the Mathematicians
with great inju&s;tice, I think, that they imagine
there may be a proportion between nothings,
and yet he him&s;elf argues from this principle,
<HI>Anal.</HI> p. 18. &startq;Points are undoubtedly equal, as
having no more magnitude one than another,
a limit or point, as &s;uch, having no magni|tude.&endq;</P>
<P>2. EVERY reader of the <HI>Analy&s;t</HI> will ob&s;erve
what &s;tre&s;s he lays on this maxim, Inaccurate
premi&s;es cannot infer an accurate conclu&s;ion; as
if nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary than the belief of
this principle to con&s;ute his adver&s;aries; whereas
the inference he would draw from thence, that
we therefore cannot, in any ca&s;e, know the
conclu&s;ion to be right, if we have argued from
the &s;uppo&s;ition of the truth of what we know to
be fal&s;e, or don't know to be true, is what no
rules of logic will ju&s;tify: becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible
for me, by virtue of fal&s;e or inaccurate premi&s;es,
to gain a conclu&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time to
know that the error in the premi&s;es will not
cau&s;e any error in the conclu&s;ion. Thus in
Algebra the &s;uppo&s;ition of a negative quantity,
or a quantity le&s;s than nothing, is an ab&s;urdity,
but yet this is no hindrance to the evidence of
tho&s;e conclu&s;ions that according to the rules of
art are derived from it. And again, to bring
an in&s;tance more to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I'll al|low
that the &s;uppo&s;ition of an infinite&s;imal is
ab&s;urd, and al&s;o that the &s;uppo&s;ition that an in|finite&s;imal
added to a finite quantity does not
increa&s;e its magnitude is ab&s;urd, when an infi|nite&s;imal
is con&s;ider'd as a fix'd determinate
<PB N="45" REF="44">
quantity; and yet, I &s;ay, in deducing the value
of the &s;ubtangent of a Parabola from the&s;e &s;up|po&s;itions,
I may be &s;ure that I make a right
conclu&s;ion; becau&s;e tho&s;e quantities which I
&s;uppo&s;e to be infinitely &s;mall, if they are not &s;o
will be very &s;mall, and tho&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e to be
equal will be very nearly &s;o, and therefore the
error in the conclu&s;ion can be but very &s;mall;
<HI>i. e.</HI> the &s;ubtangent will be equal to twice the
ab&s;ci&s;&s;e very nearly. But I am certain that this
cannot po&s;&s;ibly be demon&s;trated concerning any
finite and determinate quantities, unle&s;s they are
truly and exactly equal, if you don't fix upon
&s;ome determined proportion or difference as the
&s;tandard of what is nearly equal, but leave every
per&s;on at liberty to chu&s;e what he will. And
from this principle I would ob&s;erve, that the
conclu&s;ions found by <HI>Leibnitz</HI>'s method of differ|rences
may be proved to be true, notwith&s;tand|ing
the error or inaccuracy of his principles:
for &s;uppo&s;ing in his method that the mark of
equality = does not &s;ignify truly but nearly equal
in the &s;en&s;e before given, and then correct your
conclu&s;ion by the forementioned axiom, and
you may be &s;ure it is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>3. HE repre&s;ents the Mathematicians as
founding their rea&s;onings on maxims &s;hocking
to good &s;en&s;e, as particularly when they take it
for granted that a finite quantity divided by no|thing
is infinite, <HI>Query</HI> 16. I &s;uppo&s;e our Au|thor
will not pretend to &s;ay here that he de&s;igned
only to a&s;k a civil and innocent que&s;tion,
but to charge the Mathematicians with proceed|ing
on &s;uch ab&s;urd maxims as this; and if &s;o,
it is an ha&s;ty and ill-grounded charge; 'tis a
<PB N="46" REF="45">
charge, I think, he him&s;elf can hardly imagine
to be true. Does our Author take all Mathe|maticians
to be fools; or did ever any fool
imagine that a rea&s;onable an&s;wer could be given
to this que&s;tion, How many nothings will fill a
quart; and that the proper an&s;wer is, An infi|nite
number? Yet this is only to &s;ay that a
quart divided by nothing is infinite. 'Tis al|lowed
that this is a rule in Algebra, <HI>that finite
divided by nothing is infinite:</HI> but the meaning
of it is only this, that if I inquire how big any
quantity mu&s;t be taken in order to an&s;wer any
purpo&s;e, and the an&s;wer come out according to
the rules of Algebra 1/0 or 2/0 <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this is a &s;ign
that no finite quantity is large enough. And
is there any thing &s;hocking in this to the &s;en&s;e
of any man, from the porter to the philo&s;o|pher?
The &s;ame kind of an&s;wer ought to be
given in relation to other maxims of Algebra,
which appear &s;trange to tho&s;e unaccu&s;tomed to
the phra&s;es, and really are in them&s;elves &s;en&s;e|le&s;s
expre&s;&s;ions, as that the &s;um or product of
two impo&s;&s;ible quantities may be po&s;&s;ible. Nay
this may be &s;aid of the terms multiply and di|vide,
add and &s;ubtract, as u&s;ed in Algebra. An
Algebrai&s;t never &s;cruples to &s;ubtract a greater
quantity from a le&s;s; but if he really de&s;igns to
do this, he may try till his heart akes before he
will be able to accompli&s;h it, or to know what
he is about. All the&s;e phra&s;es are therefore to
be con&s;idered merely as terms of art to help the
memory in an algebraic proce&s;s, or &s;igns of
rules, which from other principles we mu&s;t
know to be ju&s;t, and not from any idea we
have of the things, which, according to the
<PB N="47" REF="46">
common u&s;e of the words, an ignorant man
may fancy they are intended to expre&s;s. 'Tis
pity, indeed, the&s;e things have not been more
particularly explained by the writers of Alge|bra,
the want of which may well make it ab|&s;tru&s;e
and confounding to beginners. Yet for a
per&s;on to make the&s;e objections again&s;t the art
or tho&s;e that under&s;tand it, is as if I &s;hould im|pute
it to the Logicians as a fault in theirs, that
they u&s;e the horrid terms <HI>Barbara, Celarent,</HI> &amp;c.
Nor do I think the u&s;e of the&s;e ab&s;urd expre&s;|&s;ions
peculiar to Algebra, but they are fre|quently
u&s;ed where, thro' their being familiar,
and the de&s;ign of them ea&s;ily intelligible, they
are not thought to have any odd found. Thus
it is a maxim in Arithmetic that 2 &times; 0 = 5 &times; 0,
or in general any number multiplied by 0 is
= 0. Now I &s;ay that if by this any thing
el&s;e be under&s;tood than that this is a good rule
to go by in managing figures in Arithmetic, I
will &s;o far venture the laugh of the Public as to
declare I don't under&s;tand it. He that can
take two nothings and find their &s;um, and then
five nothings and find their &s;um equal to the
former, &s;eems to me to be in a fair way to be
able to divide by nothing, and find the quo|tient;
and, with a little more pains, may
prove that two is equal to five. To multiply
by nothing, is as ab&s;urd as to divide by no|thing;
and to &s;uppo&s;e we can do either, is to
imagine nothing to be a real quantity or num|ber:
for <HI>nihili nulloe &s;unt affectiones.</HI> Here I
&s;uppo&s;e our Author agrees with me from his
40th <HI>Query;</HI> but no one will &s;ay that for this
rea&s;on we ought to reject the maxim con&s;idered
<PB N="48" REF="47">
as a rule of Arithmetic, that the product of
any number by 0 is = 0.</P>
<P>4thly, <HI>Query</HI> 50. HE repre&s;ents the di&s;|putes
and controver&s;ies among Mathematicians
as di&s;paraging the evidence of their methods:
and, <HI>Query</HI> 51. he repre&s;ents Logics and Me|taphy&s;ics
as proper to open their eyes, and
extricate them out of their difficulties. Now
were ever two things thus put together? If
the di&s;putes of the profe&s;&s;ors of any &s;cience
di&s;parage the &s;cience it&s;elf, Logics and Meta|phy&s;ics
are much more di&s;paraged than Mathe|matics;
why therefore, if I am half blind, mu&s;t
I take for my guide one that can't &s;ee at all?
And to &s;ay the truth, it can hardly be look'd
upon as fair to repre&s;ent Mathematics as di&s;pa|raged
by the di&s;putes of its profe&s;&s;ors, which
in&s;inuates that in this way it is peculiarly di&s;|paraged,
whereas the quite contrary is true,
there being fewer di&s;putes among Mathema|ticians,
as &s;uch, than any other per&s;ons what|&s;oever.
The di&s;putes of Mathematicians about
metaphy&s;ical and philo&s;ophical principles have
nothing to do here; and take away the&s;e,
hardly any remain.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, His frequent in&s;inuations that Ma|thematicians
don't care to be tried by the rules
of good logic, and require indulgence for in|correct
and fal&s;e rea&s;onings, and think that the
truth of the premi&s;es are proved without more
ado by the truth of the conclu&s;ion, are en|tirely
groundle&s;s. They, as well as all other
mortals, de&s;ire indulgence for inaccurate ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
but none for fal&s;e rea&s;oning; and for
<PB N="49" REF="48">
following the exacte&s;t rules of logic, they
pride them&s;elves in being the mo&s;t perfect
patterns.</P>
<P>To make a thing plain as a propo&s;ition in
<HI>Euclid,</HI> is to give it the la&s;t degree of evidence.
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Query 43.</NOTE> Nor is it any objection to the ju&s;tne&s;s of their
rea&s;oning, that an algebraical note is &s;ome|times
to be interpreted, at the end of the pro|ce&s;s,
in a &s;en&s;e which cou'd not have been
&s;ub&s;tituted in the beginning of it; &s;ince if
quantities them&s;elves are con&s;idered as conti|nually
changing, the &s;en&s;e of the mark which
repre&s;ents or expre&s;&s;es them mu&s;t, in order to
its doing &s;o, continually change along with
them. And they never imagine that any par|ticular
&s;uppo&s;ition can come under a general
ca&s;e which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the rea&s;oning
thereof, or any ju&s;t rea&s;oning what&s;oever:
tho' they have many times good rea&s;on to
conclude that particular ca&s;es in a general theo|rem
are true, tho' they could not be proved
in the &s;ame manner with the theorem it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To conclude; as I would not be thought,
by any thing I have &s;aid, to be an enemy
to true Logic and &s;ound Metaphy&s;ics; and on
the contrary think the mo&s;t general u&s;e of
the Mathematics is to inure us to a ju&s;t way
of thinking and arguing; it is a proper in|quiry,
I imagine, for tho&s;e who have the
direction of the education of youth, in what
manner mathematical &s;tudies may be &s;o pur|&s;ued
as mo&s;t &s;urely to an&s;wer this end: upon
which head the hints our Author gives, <HI>Queries</HI>
15, 38, 56, 57, de&s;erve to be con&s;ider'd: for
<PB N="50" REF="49">
&s;o far as Mathematics do not tend to make men
more &s;ober and rational thinkers, wi&s;er and
better men, they are only to be con&s;idered as an
amu&s;ement, which ought not to take us off
from &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
