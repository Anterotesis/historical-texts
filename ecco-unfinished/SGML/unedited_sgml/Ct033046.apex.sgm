<P>SIR,</P>
<P>_IT is not my Purpo&s;e, in this Addre&s;s, to run into the common Tract of Dedicators, and attempt a Panegyric which would prove <HI>ungrateful</HI> to You, too <HI>arduous</HI> for Me, and <HI>&s;uperfluous</HI> with Regard to the World. To You it would prove <HI>ungrateful,</HI> &s;ince there is a certain generous

Delicacy in Men of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Merit, di&s;po&s;ing Them to avoid tho&s;e Prai&s;es They &s;o power|fully attract. And when I con&s;ider that a <HI>Character,</HI> in which the VER|TUES, the GRACES, and the MUSES join their Influence, as much exceeds the Expre&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t elegant and judicious Pen, as the fini&s;h'd <HI>Beauty</HI> does the Repre&s;entation of the Pencil, I have the be&s;t Rea&s;ons for declining &s;uch an <HI>arduous</HI> Undertaking. As, indeed, it would be <HI>&s;uperfluous</HI> in it &s;elf; for what Reader need to be told of tho&s;e great Abilities in the Manage|ment of public Affairs, and tho&s;e amia|ble Accompli&s;hments in private Life, which You &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;s. The general Voice is loud in the Prai&s;e of &s;o many Vertues, tho' Po&s;terity alone will do Them Ju&s;tice. But may You, SIR, live long to illu&s;trate your own Fame by your own Actions, and by

them be tran&s;mitted to future Times as the BRITISH MAECENAS!</P>
<P>YOUR Example has recommend|ed POETRY, with the greate&s;t Grace, to the Admiration of Tho&s;e, who are engag'd in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t active Scenes of Life: and this, tho' con|fe&s;&s;edly the lea&s;t con&s;iderable of tho&s;e exalted Qualities that dignify your Cha|racter, mu&s;t be particularly plea&s;ing to <HI>One,</HI> who&s;e only Hope of being in|troduced to your Regard is thro' the Recommendation of an ART in which You are a Ma&s;ter.&mdash;But I forget what I have been declaring above, and mu&s;t therefore turn my Eyes to the following Sheets. I am not ignorant that, when offered to your Peru&s;al, they are put into the Hands of one of the fine&s;t, and con&s;equently the mo&s;t indulgent Judges of the Age: but as there is no Mediocrity in POETRY,

&s;o there &s;hould be no Limits to its Ambition.&mdash;I venture directly on the Tryal of my Fame.&mdash;If what I here pre&s;ent You has any Merit to gain your Approbation, I am not a|fraid of its Succe&s;s; and if it fails of your Notice, I give it up to its ju&s;t Fate. This Advantage at lea&s;t I &s;e|cure to my&s;elf, an Occa&s;ion of thus publickly declaring that I am, with the profounde&s;t Veneration,</P>
