<P>_WHEN the Prior had made an end of
reading the Story, he ca&s;t his Eyes
on <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> and found his &s;hut,
and that he did not &s;tir; and there|upon
approaching to him, and crying
out aloud, &startq;My Friend, are you in
this World, or the other?&endq; he look'd &s;tedfa&s;tly
upon him, and told him afterwards, that he was
<PB N="2" REF="3">
&s;o charm'd with the White Cat, that he thought
he was at the Wedding, or picking up &s;ome of the
Emerald or Diamond Buckles. &startq;Then you love
the&s;e &s;ort of Fictions?&endq; <HI>reply'd the Prior.</HI> &startq;They
are no Fictions, <HI>added</HI> Dandinardiere; all this once
happen'd, and may do again, tho they are now
indeed out of fa&s;hion: Oh! had I lived in
tho&s;e days, I &s;hould have made my&s;elf a con|&s;iderable
Fortune.&endq; &startq;You had, without di&s;pute,
<HI>continued the Prior,</HI> marry'd a Fairy.&endq; &startq;I know not
that, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, they &s;eem to me too
ugly, and if I marry, I mu&s;t plea&s;e my Fancy.&endq;
&startq;That is to &s;ay, <HI>interrupted the Prior,</HI> you would have
a Lady of Worth, beautiful, virtuous, and witty,
but would not &s;tand for Fortune, being per&s;uaded
that it is hard to meet with all at once: Well, I
love you the better for this, I &s;hall &s;peak in your
prai&s;e for the future.&endq; &startq;You don't take me right,
<HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, I would have the Per&s;on I
marry endow'd with all the Qualifications of Bo|dy
and Mind, and rich be&s;ides; and at that time
when there were Fairies, I &s;hould have found out
the way to have got a Queen, nothing could be
more ea&s;y, &s;ince it might be done by three
words of <HI>Brelu, Breloc,</HI> by a Wand, or any thing;
whereas now if a Man be poor, and would be
rich, he mu&s;t work like an Hor&s;e, and perhaps
to no purpo&s;e:&endq;
<Q>O Tempora! O Mores!</Q>
&startq;Mr. Prior, <HI>continued he,</HI> what &s;ay you, this Latin
is not ami&s;s. &startq;Oh! <HI>an&s;wer'd the Prior,</HI> I admire
you as much, as you do the White Cat; your
Conver&s;ation is &s;o good, one is always in&s;tructed
by it.&endq; This little Mortal was &s;o overjoy'd at this
Commendation, that he re&s;olved, in order to gain
immortal Honour, to make a Story in his turn;
and to that end de&s;ired of the Prior that <HI>Alain</HI>
might be acquainted with the Accident that had
<PB N="3" REF="4">
befel him, that he might come to him. Afterwards
thanking him for the favour he had done him, in
reading &s;o long by him, he pretended to be &s;leepy,
that he might have the more liberty to mu&s;e and
think. And indeed he thought, but it was more of
<HI>Virginia</HI> than the Fairies: &startq;What a Sublimity of
Wit has &s;he, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> for one that has been
brought up and educated by the Sea-&s;ide, who
ought to have no more Genius than a Sole or an
Oy&s;ter-&s;hell, to write as well as the mo&s;t cele|brated
Authors? I have good Judgment, and
when I approve any thing, it mu&s;t be excellent:
I like the White Cat, which is excellent, and I
will maintain it again&s;t all Mankind. My Valet
<HI>Alain,</HI> whom I have armed cap-a-pee, &s;hall enter
the Li&s;ts, and fight for me.&endq; After this manner
he went on, and made as much noi&s;e as twenty
People. As &s;oon as Mr. <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> was acquainted
with it, &s;u&s;picious le&s;t his Fall &s;hould have turn'd
his Brain, he came to hear his Extravagances,
which gave him no &s;mall cau&s;e of Amazement.
When <HI>Alain</HI> came, he would not &s;uffer him to go
into his Ma&s;ter's Chamber, for fear of his making
him talk the more, and di&s;turbing him, but bid
him come again the next day. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was &s;o
de&s;irous of making a Story, that he could not &s;leep
all night, and was heartily grieved for want of his
Secretary to write it down; but before day he a|waken'd
the whole Hou&s;e to &s;end a Me&s;&s;enger for
<HI>Alain,</HI> which made the Baron, &s;eeing him &s;o impa|tient,
di&s;patch one pre&s;ently for that faithful Do|me&s;tick.
As &s;oon as ever he &s;aw him, he bounced
up an end in bed, and holding out his Arms, cry'd,
&startq;Come, <HI>Alain,</HI> come my Friend, I have the mo&s;t
&s;urprizing things in the World to tell you.&endq; &startq;Give
me leave, Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain, <HI>who&s;e Heart relented to &s;ee
his Ma&s;ter's Head &s;o bound up,</HI> to ask you how you
do, for that is the greate&s;t Concern to me.&endq; &startq;I
&s;hould be better, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere; but alas!
my greate&s;t Illne&s;s lies not in my Head: I am in
<PB N="4" REF="5">
love, <HI>Alain; Cupid</HI> never let fly a &s;urer Dart.&endq; To
this <HI>Alain</HI> made no Reply; for he knew as little of
<HI>Cupid</HI> as of the Alcoran, and was afraid he might
be guilty of &s;ome Blunder. &startq;What have you not
one word to &s;ay?&endq; <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere. &startq;No, Sir,
<HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Alain, I am at pre&s;ent all Ears.&endq; &startq;Then
hear what has happen'd to me, <HI>&s;aid he;</HI> I have en|gaged
my Liberty to a young Prince&s;s.&endq; &startq;For
how much?&endq; <HI>interrupted</HI> Alain. &startq;Do you think,
Blockhead, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, it was for a Ha|bit,
or &s;ome Jewels?&endq; &startq;I know not what to think,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the Valet,</HI> you &s;peak to me of things I am
an entire Stranger to; for example, where could
you find a Prince&s;s in this Country, unle&s;s one
that had been &s;hipwreck'd, and ca&s;t on the &s;hore?&endq;
&startq;Indeed you argue very well, <HI>reply'd the Ma&s;ter,</HI>
there are not many Prince&s;&s;es hereabouts; but
&s;he whom I adore de&s;erves to be one, and in my
eyes is the &s;ame as if &s;he was one. She is call'd
<HI>Virginia,</HI> which is an old <HI>Roman</HI> Name, for the
Love of which alone &s;he &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s my Heart.&endq;
<HI>Alain</HI> open'd his Eyes and Mouth, and &s;tared like a
&s;tuck Pig, amazed at his Ma&s;ter's Learning; but all
the time kept a re&s;pectful Silence, which gave him
time to proceed: but reflecting at la&s;t, that this
did not further on the Story he was re&s;olved to
write, he order'd <HI>Alain</HI> to go home that minute,
and put all his Books in a Cart or two, and bring
them to him. &startq;What, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he, &s;omewhat melancholy,</HI>
do you de&s;ign to live here?&endq; &startq;No, my Friend, <HI>re|plied
our &s;ick Man,</HI> I &s;hall only &s;tay till my Wounds
are well; but I have a great Work to go thro
with, and &s;hall be obliged to look into &s;ome of
the be&s;t Authors: run pre&s;ently, and return with
&s;peed.&endq; But as <HI>Alain</HI> was going in all ha&s;te, he
met the Baron, Vi&s;count, and Prior, who were
forced to call to him &s;everal times, before they
could get him to come back. &startq;Tell me, <HI>Alain, &s;aid
the Baron,</HI> where your Ma&s;ter has &s;ent you, for
that Air of Bu&s;ine&s;s I read in your Countenance,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
makes me &s;omewhat curious.&endq; &startq;I am going, Sir,
<HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Alain, for all his Books, and his Learn|ing;
he is going to write one of the fine&s;t things
in the World, and will, I believe, &s;tand in need
of your A&s;&s;i&s;tance.&endq; &startq;I am per&s;uaded of that, <HI>replied
the Baron;</HI> but &s;tay here, he has Books enough
already to employ him&s;elf agreeably.&endq; &startq;Oh! I
dare not di&s;obey him for all the World, he mu&s;t
have four times as many as any other Per&s;on, and
when he is angry, he beats me; I am &s;ure I ex|perienced
it enough, &s;ince he has had this Quar|rel
upon his hands.&endq; &startq;I give you my word, <HI>&s;aid
the Vi&s;count, &s;topping him,</HI> you &s;hall not &s;tir till you
tell us what he beat you for.&endq; This was too good
an opportunity for <HI>Alain,</HI> who loved prattling, to
neglect it; he told them how he dre&s;s'd him up in
Armour, that he might pa&s;s for him&s;elf, and all
he &s;aid to encourage him to fight like a Hero.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen look'd at one another, amazed
at the Extravagancies of the Ma&s;ter, and the Sim|plicity
of the Man, and would have hinder'd him,
but in vain, from going to his Ma&s;ter's Study; but
he told them he mu&s;t go, tho it was to throw all
the Books into the Sea: and go he would. &startq;Well,
<HI>&s;aid the Baron</HI> de St. Thomas <HI>to his two Friends,</HI> do
you advi&s;e me &s;eriou&s;ly to think of <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
for one of my Daughters? By their Whims and
Notions, they &s;eem as if they were made for one
another; yet a Family mu&s;t be but poorly mana|ged
by &s;uch Heads.&endq; &startq;Don't be out of conceit
with him, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Vi&s;count,</HI> he is rich, tho a
little <HI>Quixoti&s;h,</HI> but he wants Courage, for you
&s;ee at the very Name of <HI>Villeville</HI> he trembles;
the&s;e Extravagancies will &s;oon leave him: for 'tis
hard for one, that is always afraid, to keep up
the&s;e bravadoing Airs.&endq; &startq;Add to this, <HI>&s;aid the
Prior,</HI> that you may engage him to live with you,
and that you may redre&s;s all their Faults.&endq; &startq;I
am more afraid, <HI>&s;aid the Baron, &s;miling,</HI> they will
&s;ooner crack my Brains, than any Remon&s;trances
<PB N="6" REF="7">
of mine will have any effect on theirs. There's
my Wife, and her two Daughters, have each a
&s;ingular Genius, and to add <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> to them,
will render the Extravagance yet greater.&endq; &startq;No
matter for that, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI> there's a good Foun|dation
of ready Money; I will never forgive you,
if you let him e&s;cape: but now I think on it,
I will go and &s;ee him, and know what he intends
to write.&endq;</P>
<P>Away he went directly to his Chamber, and af|ter
having ask'd him what News, told him, that as
he was his Reader the day before, he was now
come to offer his Service to be his Secretary. &startq;You
cannot, Sir, do me a greater plea&s;ure, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dan|dinardiere,
<HI>holding out his Arms;</HI> for tho I have
<HI>Alain,</HI> yet his Writing is &s;o horrible, that we
&s;hould want a third Per&s;on to decypher his
Scrawl: be&s;ides, he has &s;o little Wit, that all the
fine and good things I &s;ay, are lo&s;t, becau&s;e he
does not under&s;tand them.&endq; &startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI>
I &s;hall be proud to be your Secretary, at lea&s;t
while you are indi&s;po&s;ed.&endq; &startq;O! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dan|dinardiere,
I am your humble Servant and Slave
for ever.&endq; &startq;It is enough for me, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI>
that you are my Friend; but let me know your
De&s;ign, whether you will treat on your Subject
in Pro&s;e or Ver&s;e.&endq; &startq;It is equal to me which, <HI>re|ply'd
our Citizen,</HI> provided I make but a Story, to
convince <HI>Virginia</HI> that I fall not &s;hort of her in
Wit; but what vexes me mo&s;t, is, I never &s;aw
any Fairies, and know not where they live.&endq; &startq;Do
not puzzle your&s;elf about that, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI> I can
a&s;&s;i&s;t you; and that you may not rack your
Brains, here's one in my Pocket I have ju&s;t fi|ni&s;h'd,
which has never yet been &s;een by any
one.&endq; &startq;O! Sir, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, if you will
&s;ell it me, and &s;wear never to brag of it, I will
give you, with all my heart, four Pieces for it.&endq;
&startq;That's too little, <HI>reply'd the Prior,</HI> it had better co&s;t
you nothing.&endq; At the &s;ame time he &s;hew'd a great
<PB N="7" REF="8">
Bundle of Paper, which <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was &s;o charm|ed
with, that he was for getting out of bed to
throw him&s;elf at his feet; but what plea&s;ed him
mo&s;t, was, it co&s;t him nothing. Now this Story
the Prior had &s;tole out of the young Madam <HI>de St.
Thomas's</HI> Chamber, which they did not &s;o &s;oon per|ceive,
becau&s;e as they writ very much, &s;everal of
their Papers lay loo&s;e about: but this he did not
think fit to let <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> know, that he might
not lo&s;e the Merit of his Genero&s;ity, and fancy'd
it would be plea&s;ant to hear the Di&s;pute that would
ari&s;e between the true Author and the Plagiary;
and &s;eeing him impatient to hear it, began as
follows.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Story of Fortunio, the Fortunate
Knight.</HEAD>
<P>THERE once reign'd a powerful King, who
was a Prince of great Clemency, and very
well beloved by his Subjects: but being engaged
in a War with an Emperor, who&s;e Name was <HI>Ma|tapa,</HI>
a neighbouring and potent Prince; after &s;eve|ral
Battels, the Emperor at la&s;t gain'd an entire
and &s;ignal Victory. The King had mo&s;t of his Of|ficers
and Soldiers kill'd, or taken Pri&s;oners, and
the Emperor &s;oon after be&s;ieged his Capital Town,
and took it; by which means he became Ma&s;ter of
all the Trea&s;ures. The King had much ado to
e&s;cape him&s;elf, with the Queen-Dowager his Si&s;ter,
who was young, beautiful, and witty, but withal
proud, ha&s;ty, and difficult of Acce&s;s. The Empe|ror
tran&s;ported all the Jewels and rich Furniture
to his own Palace, and took a great number of
young Dam&s;els, Hor&s;es, and whatever might be
<PB N="8" REF="9">
u&s;eful and agreeable to him; and when he had de|populated
the greate&s;t part of the Kingdom, re|turned
in Triumph home, where he was received
by the Empre&s;s, and the Prince&s;s his Daughter,
with all the Joy imaginable; while the dethroned
King endured, with the utmo&s;t impatience, his
Misfortunes. He a&s;&s;embled what Troops he had
left, form'd a &s;mall Army, and to augment it as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, publi&s;hed an Ordonnance, requiring
all Gentlemen, who were his Subjects, either to
come and &s;erve him in thier own proper Per&s;ons,
or to &s;end one of their Sons well mounted and
armed.</P>
<P>There lived on the Frontiers an old Lord, who
had &s;een full four&s;core Years, and was a Man of
extraordinary Parts; but had partaken &s;o much of
the Frowns of Fortune, that he was very much re|duced,
and had bore all his Ill-fortune with
more patience, had not three beautiful Daughters
&s;hared it with him. But as they were Women of
good Sen&s;e, they never murmur'd at their Misfor|tunes,
but rather, when they &s;poke, comforted
their Father, than added to his Afflictions. In this
manner they lived with him in an old Country-Hou&s;e,
free from Ambition, when this Ordonnance
reach'd the old Gentleman's Ears; who call'd his
Daughters, and with a Countenance that di&s;cover'd
the Grief of his Mind, &s;aid to them, &startq;What &s;hall
we do? The King has order'd all Per&s;ons of Di|&s;tinction
in his Dominions to &s;erve him again&s;t the
Emperor, or pay &s;uch a Fine, which I am not
able to do; and the&s;e Extremities will either co&s;t
me my Life, or be our Ruin.&endq; His three Daugh|ters
were as much concern'd as him&s;elf at this
News, but yet de&s;ired him not to be di&s;hearten'd,
&s;ince they were per&s;uaded &s;ome Remedy might be
found out. The next day, the elde&s;t went to her
Father, as he was walking melancholily in his lit|tle
Orchard, and &s;aid to him, &startq;I come, my Lord,
to intreat you to let me go to the Army; I am of
<PB N="9" REF="10">
an advantageous height enough, and robu&s;t; I
will dre&s;s my&s;elf in Mens Clothes, and pa&s;s for
your Son: if I do not heroick Actions, I &s;hall
however &s;ave you a Journey, or the Tax, which
is a great deal in our Circum&s;tances.&endq; The
Count embraced her tenderly, and at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed
&s;o extraordinary a De&s;ign; but &s;he repre&s;ented to
him, with great Firmne&s;s of Mind, that there was
no other Expedient, and thereby got his con&s;ent.
Her Father provided Clothes and Arms for her,
and gave her the be&s;t of four Hor&s;es, which he
kept to go to Plow and Cart; and after the mo&s;t
tender Farewell on both &s;ides, &s;he &s;et out on her
Journey. After &s;ome days travel, as &s;he pa&s;s'd by
a large Meadow, be&s;et with a quick-&s;et Hedge, &s;he
&s;aw a Shepherde&s;s very much grieved, who was en|deavouring
to pull a Sheep out of a Ditch: &startq;What
are you doing there, Shepherde&s;s?&endq; <HI>&s;aid &s;he.</HI> &startq;A|las!
<HI>reply'd the Shepherde&s;s,</HI> I am &s;triving to &s;ave a
Sheep that is almo&s;t drowned, and am &s;o weak,
that I cannot draw him out.&endq; &startq;I pity you,&endq; <HI>&s;aid
&s;he;</HI> and, without offering her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, rid away.
Whereupon the Shepherde&s;s cry'd out, &startq;Good-by,
di&s;gui&s;ed Fair.&endq; Which put our Heroine into an
inexpre&s;&s;ible Surprize. &startq;How is it po&s;&s;ible, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he to her&s;elf,</HI> that I &s;hould be known? This old
Shepherde&s;s has but ju&s;t &s;et her Eyes on me, and
has di&s;cover'd what I am; what &s;hall I do? I
&s;hall be known to all the world, and how a&s;ham'd
and vex'd &s;hall I be, if the King &s;hould find me
out? He will think my Father a Coward, that
dur&s;t not expo&s;e him&s;elf to Danger.&endq; At la&s;t &s;he
concluded to go home again.</P>
<P>The Count and his Daughters were talking of
her, and reckoning how long &s;he had been gone,
when they &s;aw her come in, who told them her
Adventure The good old Count &s;aid it was no|thing
but what he fore&s;aw; that if &s;he would have
taken his Advice, &s;he had not gone, becau&s;e he
thought it impo&s;&s;ible but &s;he mu&s;t be di&s;covered.
<PB N="10" REF="11">
This little Family was embara&s;s'd again, when the
&s;econd Daughter &s;aid to her Father, &startq;I am not
&s;urprized that my Si&s;ter &s;hould be di&s;cover'd,
&s;ince &s;he never was on hor&s;eback before; but for
my part, if you will let me go in her &s;tead, I
dare promi&s;e, you &s;hall not need to repent it.&endq;
It was in vain for the old Count to refu&s;e her; he
was forced to con&s;ent, and &s;he took other Clothes
and Arms and another Hor&s;e; and when &s;he was
thus equip'd, embraced her Father and Si&s;ters, and
re&s;olved to &s;erve the King: but as &s;he pa&s;s'd by
the &s;ame Meadow, &s;he &s;aw the &s;ame Shepherde&s;s
drawing a Sheep out of a deep Ditch, who cry'd
out, &startq;Unfortunate Wretch that I am, to lo&s;e half
my Flock after this manner; if any body would
help me, I might &s;ave this poor Creature.&endq; &startq;What,
Shepherde&s;s, <HI>cry'd out this &s;econd Daughter,</HI> do you
take no better care of your Sheep, than to let
them fall into the Water?&endq; Then &s;pur'd on her
Hor&s;e, and rid away. &startq;Farewell, di&s;gui&s;ed Fair,
<HI>cry'd the old Woman to her.</HI>&endq; Which Words were
no &s;mall Affliction to our <HI>Amazon.</HI> &startq;How unfor|tunate,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> is it to be thus known; I have
no better luck than my Si&s;ter: it will be ridicu|lous
for me to go to the Army with &s;uch an effe|minate
Air.&endq; Thereupon &s;he return'd home very
much vex'd at her bad Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The old Count receiv'd her with a great deal of
Tenderne&s;s, and commended her Prudence, but
could not help being chagrin'd at the expence he
had been at of two Suits of Clothes and other
things, tho' he conceal'd it as much as po&s;&s;ible from
his Daughters. At la&s;t the younge&s;t Daughter de|$$$ed
him, with the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances, to give
her leave, as he had done both her Si&s;ters. &startq;Per|haps,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> you may think it pre&s;umption in
me to think to &s;ucceed better than they, yet
I de&s;ire I may try; I am &s;omewhat taller than
they: you know I have been u&s;ed to hunting,
which Exerci&s;e bears &s;ome Parallel with War;
<PB N="11" REF="12">
and my great De&s;ire to comfort you in your Mis|fortunes,
will in&s;pire me with an extraordinary
Courage.&endq; As the Count loved this Daughter
better than the other two, becau&s;e &s;he always took
mo&s;t care of him, read to divert him, and kill'd
Game for him; he u&s;ed all the Arguments he was
ma&s;ter of, to di&s;&s;uade her from her de&s;ign. &startq;If you
leave me, my dear Child, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> your Ab&s;ence
will be my Death; for &s;hould Fortune favour you
in your Undertaking, and you &s;hould return
crown'd with Laurels, I &s;hall not have the plea|&s;ure
of &s;eeing it, &s;ince I am in &s;o advanced an
Age.&endq; &startq;No, Father, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> don't think the time
long, the War mu&s;t &s;oon be at an end; and if I
find out any other way to fulfil the King's Or|ders,
I won't neglect it: for I can a&s;&s;ure you, if
my ab&s;ence is a trouble to you, it is no le&s;s to
me.&endq; By the&s;e words &s;he at la&s;t per&s;uaded him
into a Con&s;ent, and after that made up a plain Suit
of Clothes, for her Si&s;ters had exhau&s;ted the old
Count's Trea&s;ures too much for her to have any
better; and was forc'd to take up with one of the
wor&s;t Hor&s;es, becau&s;e the others were lamed; but
all this could not di&s;courage her: She embraced
her Father, ask'd his Ble&s;&s;ing, and after &s;hedding
&s;ome Tears with him and her Si&s;ters, &s;et forwards
on her Journey.</P>
<P>As &s;he went by the &s;ame Meadow, &s;he &s;aw the
old Shepherde&s;s endeavouring to pull the Sheep
out of the Ditch. &startq;What are you doing there,
Shepherde&s;s?&endq; <HI>&s;aid &s;he.</HI> &startq;I have been doing, Sir,
<HI>reply'd the old Woman,</HI> till I can do no longer; I
have been ever &s;ince break of d$y &s;triving to get
this Sheep out, and all to no purpo&s;e; and I am
&s;o weary I can $span$: there's never a day
pa&s;&s;es over my he$$, but &s;ome Misfortune attends
me, and nobody will help me.&endq; &startq;Indeed I pity
you, <HI>&s;aid our you$$ Warrior;</HI> and to &s;hew it the
more, will a&s;&s;i&s;t you.&endq; Thereupon alighting from
her Hor&s;e, and jumping over the Hedge, &s;he went into
<PB N="12" REF="13">
the Ditch, where &s;he work'd till &s;he got this fa|vourite
Sheep out. &startq;Don't cry, Shepherde&s;s, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he,</HI> here's your Sheep; and con&s;idering the time
he has lain in the Water, he is very brisk.&endq; &startq;You
&s;hall not find me ungrateful, charming Maid, <HI>&s;aid
the Shepherde&s;s;</HI> I know where you are going and
all your De&s;igns: your Si&s;ters pa&s;s'd by this Mea|dow,
I knew them and their Thoughts; but they
were &s;o hard-hearted and unkind, that I found
the means to prevent their Journey; but for your
part you &s;hall find it otherwi&s;e. I am a Fairy,
and have a great Inclination to reward tho&s;e that
are de&s;erving. That Hor&s;e you ride is but a poor
&s;orry one, I will give you a better.&endq; Thereupon
&s;triking the ground with her Crook, our Warrior
heard a whinnying behind a Holt of Trees, and
pre&s;ently &s;aw a beautiful Hor&s;e galloping about the
Meadow. The Fairy call'd this Cour&s;er to her,
and touching him with her Crook, &s;aid, Faithful
<HI>Comrade,</HI> be accoutred finer than the be&s;t Hor&s;e
of the Emperor <HI>Matapa;</HI> and immediately <HI>Com|rade</HI>
had on a Saddle and Hou&s;ing of green Velvet,
embroider'd with Diamonds, a Bridle &s;trung with
Pearls, with the B$&s;&s;es and Bit of Gold.</P>
<P>&startq;What you &s;ee, <HI>&s;aid the Fairy,</HI> is the lea&s;t thing
you ought to admire this Hor&s;e for; he has a
great many rare Qualities which I will inform
you of. Fir&s;t, he eats but once in eight days;
and then he knows what's pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to
come: for I have had him a long time, and
brought him up to my hand. When you want to
be inform'd of any thing, or are at a lo&s;s for
Advice, you mu&s;t addre&s;s your&s;elf to him, and
mu&s;t look on him more like your Friend than
Hor&s;e. Be&s;ides, I don't like your Habit, I'll give
you one &s;hall plea&s;e you better.&endq; Then &s;triking
on the ground with her Crook, there aro&s;e up a
turkey-leather Trunk adorn'd with Nails of Gold;
the Fairy look'd in the Gra&s;s for the Key which
open'd it: it was lined with Spani&s;h-leather em|broider'd,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
and contain'd a dozen compleat Suits of
Clothes, with dozens of all Appurtenances, as
Swords, Linen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Clothes were &s;o rich
with Imbroidery and Diamonds, that our <HI>Amazon</HI>
could hardly lift them. The Fairy bid her chu&s;e
which &s;he liked be&s;t, and told her the re&s;t &s;hould
follow her wherever &s;he went, and that &s;he needed
but to &s;tamp with her Foot, and call for the Tur|key-leather
Trunk, and it &s;hould come to her full
of Money and Jewels, or full of fine Linen and
Laces, which &s;he call'd for, either into her Cham|ber,
or in the Field. &startq;But, <HI>&s;aid the Fairy,</HI> you mu&s;t
make choice of &s;ome Name agreeable to your
Profe&s;&s;ion; and I think you may call your&s;elf
<HI>Fortunio:</HI> be&s;ides, I think it not improper you
&s;hould know me in my own Per&s;on.&endq; At that
very moment &s;he ca&s;t off her old Skin, and appear'd
&s;o beautiful that &s;he dazzled the Eyes of our young
Heroine. Her Habit was blue Velvet lin'd with
Ermine, her Hair was platted with Pearls, and
on her Head &s;tood a &s;tately Crown. Our young
Warrior was &s;o tran&s;ported with admiration, &s;he
ca&s;t her&s;elf at her feet, &s;o great was her Acknow|ledgment.
The Fairy rai&s;ed her up, and embraced
her tenderly, and bid her take an Habit of gold
and green Brocade, which &s;he accordingly obey'd,
and mounting her Hor&s;e, continued on her Jour|ney,
&s;o penetrated with the extraordinary Fortune
&s;he had met with, that &s;he could think on nothing
el&s;e. She examined with her&s;elf by what Good|fortune
&s;he had gain'd the Good-will of &s;o power|ful
a Fairy; for &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, &startq;She could
with one &s;troke of her Wand have drawn out,
without my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a whole Flock from the
Center of the Earth. It was fortunate for me I
was &s;o ready to oblige her; &s;he knew the Senti|ments
of my Heart, and approved of them. If
my Father &s;aw me now &s;o rich, and in all this
Magnificence, how overjoy'd would he be, and
<PB N="14" REF="15">
how well plea&s;ed &s;hould I be to have my Family
Partakers with me!&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;he made an end of the&s;e Reflections, &s;he ar|rived
at a great City, and drew on her the Eyes
of all the People, who follow'd and crouded about
her, &s;aying, they never &s;aw &s;o fine and hand&s;ome
a Knight, and &s;o graceful an Hor&s;e before. She
had all manner of Re&s;pect paid to her, which &s;he
return'd with all imaginable Civility. As &s;oon as
&s;he came to an Inn, the Governour, who had &s;een
her as he was walking out, and admir'd her, &s;ent
a Gentleman to de&s;ire her to accept of an Apart|ment
in his Ca&s;tle. <HI>Fortunio,</HI> for &s;o we mu&s;t
call her, an&s;wer'd, that as he had not the honour
to be known to him&punc; he wou'd not take that free|dom,
but would come and pay his Re&s;pects to
him; but withal de&s;ired he would let him have a
tru&s;ty Servant to &s;end to his Father: which the
Governour did in&s;tantly, and our Knight de&s;ired
him to come again at night, becau&s;e his Di&s;patches
were not ready. He &s;hut him&s;elf up fa&s;t in his
Chamber, then &s;tamping with his foot, and calling
for the Turkey-leather Trunk full of Diamonds and
Pi&s;toles, it appear'd that moment; but then he was
at a lo&s;s for the Key, and knew not where to find
it, and thought with him&s;elf it would be a thou|&s;and
pities to break open a Trunk &s;o curiou&s;ly
wrought, and to have &s;o much Riches expo&s;ed to
the Indi&s;cretion or Knavery of a Lock-&s;mith, that
might talk publickly of them, and by that means
inform all Robbers of it. &startq;What u&s;e are the&s;e Fa|vours
of, <HI>the Fairy cry'd,</HI> &s;ince I can neither enjoy
them my&s;elf, nor let my Father receive any bene|fit
from them?&endq; Then mu&s;ing and walking about,
he remembred he &s;hould con&s;ult his Hor&s;e; away
he goes to the Stable, and whi&s;per'd &s;oftly to him,
&startq;Pray <HI>Comrade</HI> tell me where I &s;hall find the Key
of the Turkey-leather Trunk.&endq; &startq;In my Ear,&endq; <HI>an|&s;wered
he.</HI> The Knight look'd in his Ear, and &s;aw
a green Ribbon, by which he pulled out the Key,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
He open'd the Trunk, and fill'd three little Che&s;ts
full of Diamonds and Pi&s;tols, one for his Father,
and two for his Si&s;ters, and &s;ent the Governour's
Man with them, de&s;iring him not to &s;top night nor
day, till he arriv'd at the old Count's. When the
Me&s;&s;enger told him he came from his Son the
Knight, and brought him a very heavy Che&s;t, he
was very much &s;urprized at what it could contain,
for he knew he had &s;o little Money when he &s;et
out, that he could not buy any thing, nor pay the
Per&s;on for bringing his Pre&s;ent. Fir&s;t he open'd
his Letter, and when he &s;aw what his dear Daugh|ter
had &s;ent him, he was ready to die for Joy; the
&s;ight of the Jewels and Gold made good her words:
but what was mo&s;t extraordinary, when the two
Si&s;ters came to open their Che&s;ts, there were
nought but cut Gla&s;s and fal&s;e Pi&s;toles; &s;o unwil|ling
was the Fairy that they &s;hould receive any
Favours from her: in&s;omuch, that they thought
their Si&s;ter mock'd them, and thereupon conceiv'd
an inexpre&s;&s;ible Hatred again&s;t her. The Count
&s;eeing them &s;o angry, gave them a great many of
the Jewels; but as &s;oon as ever they touch'd them,
they changed like the re&s;t, by which they knew
&s;ome unknown Power acted again&s;t them, and
begg'd of their Father to keep them to him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> never &s;tay'd for the Return of the Me&s;&s;en|ger,
&s;o &s;hort was the time limited to obey the
King's Edict in; but went and took his leave of
the Governour. The whole City was a&s;&s;embled
together to &s;ee him: his Per&s;on and all his Actions
had &s;omewhat &s;o engaging in them, that they could
not but love and admire him. He never &s;poke, but
they expre&s;s'd a plea&s;ure at every word; and the
Croud was &s;o great, that he who had been u&s;ed
all his Life-time to the Country, knew not what
it was owing to. After all Civilities paid and re|ceiv'd,
he &s;et forward on his Journey, and was
entertain'd mo&s;t agreeably by his Hor&s;e, who told
him of a great many remarkable things both in old
<PB N="16" REF="17">
and modern Hi&s;tories, till they arrived at a va&s;t
Fore&s;t; when <HI>Comrade</HI> &s;aid to the Knight, &startq;Ma&s;ter,
there lives here a Man who may be of great u&s;e
to us: he is a Wood-Man, and one who is gift|ed.&endq;
&startq;What do you mean by that, <HI>interrupted the
Knight.</HI>&endq; &startq;One, <HI>&s;aid the Hor&s;e,</HI> who is endow'd by
Fairies with &s;ome rare Qualities; therefore we
mu&s;t engage him to come along with us.&endq; At
that in&s;tant they came to the Place where the
Wood-Man was at work. The young Knight ap|proach'd
him with a &s;weet and plea&s;ant Air, and
ask'd him &s;everal Que&s;tions about the place where
they were; whether there were any wild Bea&s;ts
in the Fore&s;t, and if People were allowed to hunt
them; to which the Wood-Man return'd him very
&s;uitable An&s;wers. Then he ask'd him who help'd
him to fell &s;o many Trees; he an&s;wer'd, he had
fell'd them all him&s;elf, and that it was the work
only of &s;ome few hours, and that he mu&s;t fell a
few more to make a little Burden. &startq;What, <HI>&s;aid
the Knight,</HI> do you pretend to carry all this Wood
to-day.&endq; &startq;O Sir, <HI>&s;aid Strong-back, which was his
Name,</HI> I am extraordinary &s;trong.&endq; Then &s;aid
<HI>Fortunio,</HI> &startq;Your gain mu&s;t be great.&endq; &startq;Very little,
<HI>reply'd the Wood-Man,</HI> we are very poor in this
place; and every one does his own Work.&endq; &startq;Since
it is &s;o, <HI>added the Knight,</HI> come along with me,
and you &s;hall want nothing; and when you have
a mind to go home again, I will give you Money
to defray your Expences.&endq; Which Propo&s;al he
approved of, and left his Wedges and other
Tools, and follow'd his new Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>When he had cro&s;s'd the Fore&s;t, he &s;aw a Man
in the Plain, holding in his Hand Ribbons with
which he tied his Legs, leaving, one would think
or imagine, &s;carce liberty enough to walk. <HI>Com|rade</HI>
&s;topt, and &s;aid to his Ma&s;ter, &startq;This is another
gifted Man, you will have occa&s;ion for him,
therefore take him along with you.&endq; At that
the fortunate Knight advanced towards him with
<PB N="17" REF="18">
his natural Gracefulne&s;s, and ask'd him why he tied
his Legs &s;o; &startq;Oh, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> I am preparing for a
Hunt.&endq; &startq;How, <HI>&s;aid the Knight &s;miling,</HI> do you pre|tend
to run be&s;t when you are &s;o fetter'd?&endq; &startq;No,
Sir, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> I don't pretend to run &s;o fa&s;t; but
that is not my Intention, there are neither Stags
nor Hares, but what I out-run when my Legs
are at liberty; &s;o that by always out-going them
they e&s;cape, and I &s;eldom catch them.&endq; &startq;You
&s;eem to me a very extraordinary Man, <HI>&s;aid the
Knight,</HI> what's your Name?&endq; &startq;<HI>Lightfoot, replied he,</HI>
and I am very well known in all this Country.&endq;
&startq;If you would &s;ee another, <HI>added our Hero,</HI> I &s;hould
be glad you would go with me; I will u&s;e you
very kindly.&endq; Which Offer, <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> as he lived
but indifferently, accepted of with Thanks, and
follow'd the fortunate Knight.</P>
<P>The next day he met with a Man by a Mar&s;h
&s;ide, binding his Eyes. The Hor&s;e &s;aid to his
Ma&s;ter, &startq;I would advi&s;e you, Sir, to take this
Man into your Service.&endq; <HI>Fortunio</HI> asked him what
made him bind his Eyes; to which he an&s;wer'd,
that he &s;aw too clear; that he could &s;ee Game
above four Leagues; and that he never &s;hot but he
kill$d always more than he de&s;ir'd; that he was
forced to bind his Eyes, le&s;t he &s;hould de&s;troy all
the Partridge, Phea&s;ants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Country. &startq;You
are a notable Man, <HI>reply'd</HI> Fortunio, what's your
Name? &startq;They call me the <HI>Mark&s;man, &s;aid he,</HI>
and I would not leave off that Employ for any
thing in the World.&endq; &startq;However, <HI>&s;aid the Knight,</HI> I
have a great De&s;ire to propo&s;e to you to travel
along with me; it &s;hall not hinder you from ex|erci&s;ing
your Talent.&endq; The <HI>Mark&s;man</HI> rai&s;ed &s;ome
Objections, and the Knight found it harder to get
his Con&s;ent than any of the re&s;t; for the&s;e &s;ort of
People are generally great Lovers of Liberty: how|ever
he brought it about, and they all left the
Mar&s;h together.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">
After &s;ome days Journey they came by a long
Meadow, where he &s;aw a Man laid all on one &s;ide

<P>The Knight pur&s;uing his Travels, &s;aw by a great

that he repre&s;ented the Picture of <HI>Aeolus:</HI> he was
&s;tanding with his Face towards a high Hill about
two Leagues off, on which there &s;tood fifty or &s;ixty
Windmills. The Hor&s;e &s;aid to his Ma&s;ter, &startq;There
is another of our gifted Men; do what you can
to take him along with you.&endq; <HI>Fortunio,</HI> who was
as engaging in his Per&s;on as Speech, acco&s;ted him,

blowing a little, Sir, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> to &s;et tho&s;e
Mills at work.&endq; &startq;You &s;eem too far off, <HI>&s;aid the

overturn the Mills, and perhaps the Hill it&s;elf;
&s;o that by this means I often do a great deal of
mi&s;chief again&s;t my will. I'll tell you Sir, I
was once in love, and very ill u&s;ed by my Mi&s;tre&s;s,
and as I &s;igh'd in the Woods, my Sighs tore up
Trees by their Roots, and made &s;uch a havock,

nor repent your chu&s;ing me for your Ma&s;ter.&endq;
<HI>Comrade,</HI> who&s;e Sen&s;e and Fore&s;ight were of great
&s;ervice to our Knight, told him, it would be pro|per
that he forbid his Attendants from boa&s;ting of
their extraordinary Gifts; which he fail'd not to
do, and each of them &s;wore they would punctually
obey his Commands. Soon after the Knight, who&s;e
Beauty and good Mien far exceeded the Richne&s;s
of his Habit, enter'd the Capital City, mounted on
his excellent Hor&s;e, and follow'd by his &s;even Atten|dants,
for whom he provided rich Liveries, laced
with Gold, and good Hor&s;es; and going to the be&s;t
Inn, &s;tay'd there till the day appointed for the
Review: all which time he was the Subject of the
Di&s;cour&s;e of the whole City, in&s;omuch that the
King hearing of him, had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee
him.</P>
<P>The Troops a&s;&s;embled on a large Plain, the
King, and his Si&s;ter the Queen-Dowager, came to
review them. She abated in no wi&s;e her Pomp
and State, notwith&s;tanding the Troubles of the
Kingdom; but dazled <HI>Fortunio</HI>'s Eyes with the
Riches with which &s;he was adorn'd: who&s;e Beauty
had the &s;ame effect upon that noble Train, as her
Magnificence had on him. Every body enquired
who that hand&s;ome young Knight was; and the
King him&s;elf, as he pa&s;s'd by, made a &s;ign for him
to come to him. <HI>Fortunio</HI> alighted from off his
Hor&s;e, to make the King a low Bow, but at the
<PB N="21" REF="22">
&s;ame time could not forbear blu&s;hing, &s;eeing him
look &s;o earne&s;tly at him, which gave a great Lu|&s;tre
to his Complexion. &startq;I &s;hould be glad, <HI>&s;aid the
King,</HI> to know who you are, and your Name.&endq;
&startq;Sir, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> I am call'd <HI>Fortunio,</HI> tho I have
no rea&s;on to bear that Name, &s;ince my Father is
an old Count, that lives on the Frontiers; who,
tho he is a Man of Birth, has no E&s;tate.&endq; &startq;Tho
Fortune may have proved unkind hitherto, <HI>an|&s;wer'd
the King,</HI> &s;he has made an amends, by bring|ing
you hither; I have a particular Affection for
you, and remember that your Father did mine
&s;ome &s;ignal Services, which I will recompence in
you.&endq; &startq;It is ju&s;t you &s;hould, <HI>&s;aid the Queen-Dowager,
who had not yet open'd her Lips:</HI> and as I am older
than you, Brother, I remember more particularly
than you do, what great things the old Count
perform'd in the Service of his Country; there|fore
I de&s;ire I may have the Care of the Prefer|ment
of this young Knight.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio,</HI> overjoy'd at this Reception, could not
thank the King and Queen enough; and dur&s;t
not enlarge too much on the Sentiments of
his Acknowledgment, thinking it more re&s;pectful
to hold his tongue, than to &s;peak too much, tho
what he did &s;ay was &s;o proper and well adapted,
that every one commended him. Afterwards he
mounted his Hor&s;e again, and mix'd among the
Lords and Gentlemen who attended on the King;
when the Queen calling him often to ask him Que|&s;tions,
and turning her&s;elf towards <HI>Florida,</HI> who was
her Confidant, &s;aid to her &s;oftly, &startq;What do you
think of this young Spark? can there be a more
noble Air, and more regular Features? I mu&s;t
confe&s;s, I never in my life &s;aw any thing more
lovely.&endq; <HI>Florida</HI>'s Sentiments differ'd not from her
Mi&s;tre&s;'s, &s;he prai&s;ed him even to Exaggeration.
Our Knight could not forbear ca&s;ting his Eyes often
on the King, who was not only a hand&s;ome Prince,
but in all his Ways was engaging; and our Female
<PB N="22" REF="23">
Warriour, tho &s;he had changed her Habit, had not
renounced her Sex, but was &s;en&s;ible of his Merit.
The King told <HI>Fortunio</HI> after the Review, that he
was afraid the War would be very bloody, there|fore
he was re&s;olved always to keep him nigh his
own Per&s;on. The Queen-Dowager, who was then
by, &s;aid, &s;he was ju&s;t thinking that he ought not
to be expo&s;ed to the Dangers of a long Campaign,
and that as the Place of Steward of her Hou&s;hold
was vacant, &s;he would give it to him. &startq;No, <HI>&s;aid
the King,</HI> I will make him Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e to
my&s;elf.&endq; Thus they di&s;puted who &s;hould prefer
<HI>Fortunio;</HI> when the Queen, fearing le&s;t &s;he &s;hould
too much betray the &s;ecret Emotions of her Heart,
yielded to the King.</P>
<P>There was never a day but <HI>Fortunio</HI> call'd for his
Turky-leather Trunk, and took a new Dre&s;s; by
which means he appear'd more magnificent than
all the Princes at the Court: in&s;omuch that the
Queen ask'd him often how his Father could af|ford
to be at &s;o va&s;t an Expence. Sometimes &s;he
banter'd him, and &s;aid, &startq;Come, confe&s;s truly you
have a Mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;upports you in all this Fi|nery.&endq;
Upon which <HI>Fortunio</HI> would blu&s;h, and ex|cu&s;e
him&s;elf the be&s;t he could. He acquitted him|&s;elf
admirably well in his Po&s;t, and his Heart,
which was &s;en&s;ible of a Tenderne&s;s for the King,
attach'd him more to his Per&s;on than he wi&s;h'd to
be: &startq;What is my Fate, <HI>&s;aid our Knight,</HI> I love a
great and powerful King, without any hopes of
the like Return, or that he &s;hould have any re|gard
for the Pains I endure.&endq; The King loaded
him with his Favours, he thought nothing well
done, but what was done by the hand&s;ome Knight,
and the Queen, deceiv'd by his Habit, thought &s;e|riou&s;ly
of marrying him; but the Inequality of
their Birth was the only ob&s;tacle that &s;tood in her
way. Neither was &s;he the only Per&s;on that was
taken with the beautiful <HI>Fortunio,</HI> all the fine La|dies
of the Court &s;igh'd for him. He was conti|nually
<PB N="23" REF="24">
pe&s;ter'd with tender Letters, Appointments
for Rendevouz's, Pre&s;ents, and a thou&s;and other
Gallantries; which he an&s;wer'd with all imagina|ble
Indifference, which made them &s;u&s;pect he had
left a Mi&s;tre&s;s behind him in his own Country.
At all Tournaments he won the Prize, and in
Hunting, or any other Sport, kill'd more Game
than all the Company be&s;ides, and danced at all
Balls more gracefully than all the Courtiers; in
&s;hort, he charmed all who &s;aw and heard him.</P>
<P>The Queen, that &s;he might not be obliged to
declare her Sentiments to him her&s;elf, charged <HI>Flo|rida</HI>
to let him under&s;tand, that &s;uch Marks of
Bounty from a young Queen ought not to be &s;o
carele&s;ly receiv'd. <HI>Florida,</HI> who had not been able
to avoid the Fate of mo&s;t that had &s;een this Knight,
was very much embara&s;s'd with this Commi&s;&s;ion,
he appear'd too lovely in her Eyes, for her to think
of preferring her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Intere&s;t before her own;
in&s;omuch that whenever the Queen gave her an
opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing with him, in&s;tead of
&s;peaking of the Beauty and great Qualifications of
that Prince&s;s, &s;he told him how ill-humour'd &s;he
was, how much her Women endured with her,
how unju&s;t &s;he was, and the ill u&s;e &s;he made of
the great Power &s;he had u&s;urped; and at la&s;t com|paring
Sentiments, &s;aid, &startq;Tho I was not born to
be a Queen, I ought to have been one, &s;ince I
have a great and generous Soul, that induces me
to do good to every body. Oh! <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> was
I in that high Station, how happy would I make
the charming <HI>Fortunio!</HI> He &s;hould love me out of
Gratitude, if he could not love me thro Inclina|tion.&endq;</P>
<P>The young Knight was entirely at a lo&s;s, and
knew not what An&s;wer to make, but ever after
carefully avoided having any private Di&s;cour&s;e with
her; while the impatient Queen never fail'd to ask
<HI>Florida</HI> how far &s;he had wrought on <HI>Fortunio,</HI> who
&s;aid to her, &startq;He is, Madam, &s;o timorous, that he
<PB N="24" REF="25">
will not believe any thing that I tell him favoura|bly
from you, or pretends not to believe it, be|cau&s;e
he is engaged in &s;ome other Pa&s;&s;ion.&endq; &startq;I
believe &s;o too, <HI>&s;aid the alarm'd Queen;</HI> but is it po&s;|&s;ible
his Love &s;hould hold out again&s;t his Ambi|tion?&endq;
&startq;And can you, Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Florida,
bear the thoughts of owing his Heart to your
Crown? Ought a Prince&s;s &s;o young and beauti|ful
as you are, to have recour&s;e to a Diadem?&endq;
&startq;Yes, to every thing, <HI>cry'd the Queen,</HI> when it is to
&s;ubdue a rebellious Heart.&endq; By this <HI>Florida</HI> knew
very well, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to cure her Mi|&s;tre&s;s
of her Pa&s;&s;ion. The Queen waited every
day for &s;ome happy effect from the Cares of her
Confidant; but the &s;mall Progre&s;s &s;he made on
<HI>Fortunio</HI> obliged her to find out other ways to di&s;|cour&s;e
with him. As &s;he knew that he went early
every morning into a little Wood, into which the
Windows of her Apartment look'd; &s;he aro&s;e with
the Morning, and looking out, &s;he perceiv'd him
walking in a carele&s;s melancholy Air; and calling
<HI>Florida,</HI> &s;aid to her, &startq;What you told me appears
but too true; <HI>Fortunio,</HI> without di&s;pute, is in love
with &s;ome Lady, either in this Court, or in his
own Country: ob&s;erve but the Sadne&s;s which
hangs on his Face.&endq; &startq;I have taken notice of it
in all the Conver&s;ation I have had with him, <HI>re|ply'd</HI>
Florida; therefore, Madam, it would be well
if you could forget him.&endq; &startq;It is now too late,
<HI>cry'd the Queen, fetching a deep Sigh;</HI> but if he goes
into that green Arbour, we will go to him.&endq; <HI>Flo|rida</HI>
dur&s;t in no wi&s;e offer to oppo&s;e the Queen,
tho &s;he had a great de&s;ire to it; for &s;he was cru|elly
afraid &s;he &s;hould be loved by <HI>Fortunio,</HI> knowing
a Rival of her Rank to be always dangerous. When
the Queen came within &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance of the
Arbour, &s;he heard the Knight, who&s;e Voice was
very agreeable, &s;ing the&s;e words:
<Q><PB N="25" REF="26">
<L>In vain, &s;oft Ea&s;e, the Love-to&s;s'd Heart pur&s;ues,</L>
<L>Even in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the long-&s;ought Joy,</L>
<L>We rob the bounteous God of half his Dues,</L>
<L>And <HI>future</HI> Fears the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Bli&s;s de&s;troy.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> made the&s;e Lines, with relation to the
Sentiment wherewith the young King had in&s;pired
her, the Favours &s;he had received from that Prince,
and the Apprehen&s;ions &s;he was under, le&s;t &s;he
&s;hould be known, and be forced to leave a Court,
which &s;he cho&s;e to live in &s;ooner than any other
Place in the World. The Queen, who &s;topped to
hear her, was in a cruel Unea&s;ine&s;s: &startq;What am I
going to attempt? <HI>&s;aid &s;he &s;oftly to</HI> Florida: this
young Ungrate de&s;pi&s;es the honour of plea&s;ing me&punc;
thinks him&s;elf happy, &s;eems content with his
Conque&s;t, and &s;acrifices me to another.&endq; &startq;He is
now at that Age, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Florida, when Rea&s;on
has not fully e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf; if I dur&s;t give
your Maje&s;ty Advice, it &s;hould be to forget him,
&s;ince he knows not how to value his good For|tune.&endq;
The Queen, who would have been better
plea&s;ed that her Confidant had &s;poke after another
manner, ca&s;t an angry Eye upon her, and advan|cing
forwards, went directly into the Arbour where
the Knight was; and pretended to be &s;urprized to
find him there, and to be vexed he &s;hould &s;ee her
in a Di&s;habille, tho' at the &s;ame time &s;he had
neglected nothing that was rich and gallant. As
&s;oon as he &s;aw her, he was for retiring, out of Re|&s;pect;
but &s;he bid him &s;tay, that &s;he might lean on
him back again. &startq;I was this morning, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI>
agreeably awakened by the Warblings of the Birds,
and the Fre&s;hne&s;s of the Air invited me to come
nigher to them. Alas! how happy are they! they
know nought but Plea&s;ures, they know no Trou|bles.&endq;
&startq;I am of opinion, Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Fortu|nio,
that they are not ab&s;olutely exempt from
Troubles and Di&s;quiets, they are always in danger
<PB N="26" REF="27">
of the murdering Shot and Snares of Sport&s;men,
be&s;ides that of the Birds of Prey, which make a
cruel War upon them; and then again, when a
hard and &s;evere Winter congeals the Earth, and
covers it with Snow, they die for want of Food,
and are every year put to the trouble of &s;eeking out
a new Mi&s;tre&s;s.&endq; &startq;Do you think it then a trouble?
<HI>&s;aid the Queen &s;miling?</HI> There are Men who do it
every month.&endq; &startq;What, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> you &s;eem
&s;urprized, and as if your Heart was not of this
&s;tamp, and that you have not hitherto been given
to change.&endq; &startq;I cannot yet tell, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
what I may be capable of, &s;ince I was never &s;en|&s;ible
of Love; but I dare believe, if I &s;hould be,
my Pa&s;&s;ion would be la&s;ting. &startq;You have never
been in love! <HI>cry'd the Queen, looking &s;o earne&s;tly at
him, that the poor Knight blu&s;hed;</HI> you have not been
in love? O <HI>Fortunio!</HI> how can you tell a Queen &s;o,
who reads in your Face and Eyes the Pa&s;&s;ion that
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es your Heart, and which your own words,
which you &s;ung to a new-fa&s;hioned Tune, have in|formed
me of. Indeed, Madam, <HI>an&s;wered the
Knight,</HI> the Lines were mine, but I made them
without any particular De&s;ign; for my Companions
and Acquaintance engage me to make drinking
Catches, tho I drink nought but Water, and ten|der
and pa&s;&s;ionate Songs: &s;o that I &s;ing both Love
and <HI>Bac$hus,</HI> tho' I am neihter a Lover nor a
Drinker.&endq;</P>
<P>The Queen li&s;tened to him with that Concern,
that &s;he could hardly contain her&s;elf. What he
&s;aid, rekindled in her Heart the Hope <HI>Florida</HI> woud
have bani&s;hed: &startq;If I could think you &s;incere, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he,</HI> I &s;hould have rea&s;on to be &s;urprized, that
you have not yet found in this Court a Lady a|miable
enough for to fix your Choice.&endq; &startq;Madam,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Fortunio, I have &s;o much to do in the Of|fice
I am in, I have no time to throw away in
&s;ighing.&endq; &startq;Then you love nothing? <HI>added &s;he with
eagerne&s;s.</HI>&endq; &startq;No, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I have not a
<PB N="27" REF="28">
Heart of &s;o gallant a Character, I am a kind of
Mi&s;anthropos, that loves my Liberty, and would
not lo&s;e it for all the World.&endq; The Queen &s;at
her&s;elf down, and fixing her Eyes mo&s;t obligingly
on him, reply'd, &startq;There are &s;ome Chains &s;o ea&s;y
and glorious to bear, that if Fortune has de&s;tined
any &s;uch for you, I would advi&s;e you to renounce
your Liberty.&endq; In all this Di&s;cour&s;e her Eyes ex|plained
her Thoughts but too intelligibly for our
Knight, who&s;e Su&s;picions were too great before not
to be confirmed in them; and fearing le&s;t the Con|ver&s;ation
&s;hould go too far, he pulled out his
Watch, and &s;etting the Hand forward, &s;aid, &startq;I beg
of your Maje&s;ty to give me leave to go to the Pa|lace,
it is the King's time of ri&s;ing, and he or|dered
me to be at his Levee.&endq; &startq;Go, indifferent
Youth, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, fetching a deep Sigh,</HI> you are in the
right to pay Court to my Brother; but remem|ber
it would not be ami&s;s to let me have &s;ome
&s;hare of your Devoirs.&endq; The Queen followed him
with her Eyes, then lowering them, and reflecting
on what had pa&s;&s;ed, blu&s;hed with Shame and Rage;
and what troubled her mo&s;t, was, <HI>Florida</HI>'s being a
Witne&s;s, and the joyful Air that appeared all over
her Countenance, which was as much as to &s;ay,
&s;he had better have taken her Advice than &s;poke to
<HI>Fortunio.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Florida</HI> acted her part very well with the Queen,
and comforted her the be&s;t &s;he could, giving her &s;ome
flattering hopes, of which at that time &s;he &s;tood in
great need? &startq;<HI>Fortunio,</HI> Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> thinks
him&s;elf &s;o much beneath you, that perhaps he
did not under&s;tand what you mean, and I think
he has a&s;&s;ured you he loves no Per&s;on.&endq; As it is
natural for us to flatter our&s;elves, the Queen, reco|vered
&s;omewhat out of her fears, not dreaming in the
lea&s;t that the malicious <HI>Florida</HI> was engaging her to
declare her&s;elf more plainly, that he might offend
her the more by the Indifference of his An&s;wers.
The Knight, for his part, was in the utmo&s;t Con|fu&s;ion,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
the Situation he was in &s;eemed cruel, and
he would have made no difficulty to have left the
Court, had not the fatal Stroke, wherewith the lit|tle
God had wounded his Heart, detained him in
&s;pite of him&s;elf. He never came near the Queen
but on Drawing-Room Nights, and when with the
King; and as &s;oon as &s;he perceived this new Change
in his Behaviour, &s;he gave him often the mo&s;t fa|vourable
Opportunities to make his Court to her,
which he as often neglected; when one day, as
&s;he was going down &s;ome &s;teps into the Garden,
&s;he &s;aw him cro&s;&s;ing a large Alley, and making to|wards
the Wood: upon which calling to him, he,
le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed, came to her, and pre|tended
that he did not &s;ee her. &startq;You remember,
Knight, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> the Conver&s;ation we had &s;ome
time &s;ince in the Green Arbour.&endq; &startq;I am not, Ma|dam,
<HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> capable of forgetting that Ho|nour.&endq;
&startq;Then without doubt, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> the Que&s;|tions
I put to you were not very plea&s;ing; for
&s;ince that day, you would not let it be in my
power to ask you any more.&endq; &startq;As Chance alone,
<HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> procured me that Favour, I thought
it would be too great Boldne&s;s to pretend to any
other.&endq; &startq;Say rather, ungrateful Man, <HI>continu'd &s;he
blu&s;hing,</HI> you have avoided my Pre&s;ence. You
know my Sentiments but too well.&endq; <HI>Fortunio</HI> thro
Mode&s;ty and Confu&s;ion lower'd his Eyes, and as
he did not make a quick Reply, &startq;You are very much
confounded, <HI>&s;aid &s;he;</HI> go, &s;eek not for an An&s;wer,
I under&s;tand you better than I would.&endq; She had
perhaps &s;aid a great deal more, but that &s;he per|ceived
the King coming that way; whereupon &s;he
made towards him, and &s;eeing him pen&s;ive and me|lancholy,
conjured him to tell her the Rea&s;on.
&startq;You know, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> that I have received Ad|vice
this Month of a Dragon of a prodigious &s;ize,
that ravages the whole Country. I thought he
might be killed, and to that end gave nece&s;&s;ary
Orders; but all that has been tried has proved in
<PB N="29" REF="30">
vain. He devours my Subjects and their Flocks,
and all that comes nigh him; he poi&s;ons all the
Rivers and Lakes he drinks at, and wherever he
lies, withers all the Gra&s;s and Herbs about him.&endq;</P>
<P>While the King was making this Complaint, the
inraged Queen was thinking how &s;he might &s;a|crifice
the Knight to her Re&s;entment, &startq;I am not
unacquainted with the ill News you have received;
<HI>Fortunio,</HI> whom you &s;aw with me, informed me
thereof: but, Brother, you will be &s;urprized at
what I have to tell you; he has begged of me,
with the greate&s;t Importunity, to ask you leave
to let him go to fight this terrible Dragon, in|deed
he has a wonderful Addre&s;s, and handles
his Arms &s;o well, that I am not &s;o much amazed
at his pre&s;uming &s;o much of him&s;elf; be&s;ides, he
has told me he has a Secret, by which he can
lay the mo&s;t wakeful Dragons a&s;leep: but that
mu&s;t not be mentioned, becau&s;e it &s;hews not &s;o
much Courage in the Action.&endq; &startq;Be it how it will,
<HI>reply'd the King,</HI> it will be glorious for him, and of
great &s;ervice to us, if he &s;hould &s;ucceed; but I am
afraid this proceeds from an indi&s;creet Zeal, and
that it &s;hould co&s;t him his Life.&endq; &startq;No, Brother,
<HI>added the Queen,</HI> fear not, he has told me very
&s;urprizing things on this Subject. You know he
is naturally very &s;incere, and be&s;ides what Ho|nour
can he hope to gain by throwing away his
Life ra&s;hly? In &s;hort, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> I have pro|mi&s;ed
to obtain for him what he &s;o earne&s;tly de|&s;ires,
and if you refu&s;e him, you will break his
Heart.&endq; &startq;I con&s;ent, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> yet I mu&s;t own,
not very freely: however, let us call him.&endq; And
thereupon making a &s;ign for him to come to him,
&s;aid to him in an obliging manner, &startq;I under&s;tand
by the Queen, you have a great de&s;ire to fight
the Dragon, that preys &s;o much on our Country;
which is &s;o bold a Re&s;olution, that I can &s;carce|ly
believe you know the Danger you run.&endq; &startq;I
have repre&s;ented that already to him, <HI>an&s;wer'd
<PB N="30" REF="31">
the Queen,</HI> but his Zeal for your Service, and his
De&s;ire to &s;ignalize him&s;elf, are &s;o great, that no|thing
can di&s;&s;uade him from it; and therefore I
fore&s;ee &s;ome happy Succe&s;s will attend him.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> was very much &s;urprized to hear the
King and Queen talk after this manner, and had
too much Sen&s;e not to penetrate into the ill De|&s;igns
of that Prince&s;s; but his Sweetne&s;s of Tem|per
would not &s;uffer him to explain him&s;elf: &s;o
without returning any An&s;wer, he let her talk on,
while he made low Bows, which the King took
for &s;o many new Intreaties to grant what he &s;o much
de&s;ired. &startq;Go, <HI>&s;aid the King &s;ighing,</HI> go where Honour
calls; I know you do every thing &s;o well, and
have particularly &s;o much Courage and Conduct,
that this Mon&s;ter will not be able to e&s;cape your
Arms.&endq; &startq;Sir, <HI>an&s;wered the Knight,</HI> however For|tune
decides the Fight, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied, &s;ince
I &s;hall either deliver you from a terrible Scourge,
or die in your Service: but honour me with one
favour, which will be infinitely dear to me.&endq;
&startq;Ask what you would have, <HI>&s;aid the King.</HI>&endq; &startq;Then
let me be &s;o bold, <HI>continued he,</HI> as to beg your Pic|ture.&endq;
The King was mightily plea&s;ed, that he
&s;hould think of his Picture at a time when his
Thoughts might have been employed on &s;o many
other important things, and the Queen was cha|grined
anew, that he had not made the &s;ame Re|que&s;t
to her. The King returned to his Palace,
and the Queen to hers, and <HI>Fortunio,</HI> who was not
a little embara&s;&s;ed on his Word which he had gi|ven,
went to his Hor&s;e: &startq;Comrade, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I have
&s;trange News to tell you.&endq; &startq;I know it, Sir, al|ready,
<HI>reply'd the Hor&s;e.</HI>&endq; &startq;What &s;hall we then do?
<HI>added</HI> Fortunio.&endq; &startq;We mu&s;t go as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the Hor&s;e;</HI> get the King's Commi&s;&s;ion,
whereby he orders you to fight the Dragon, and
afterwards we will do our Duty.&endq; The&s;e words
were very comfortable to our young Knight, who
failed not to wait on the King early the next Morn|ing
<PB N="31" REF="32">
in a campaigning Habit, as hand&s;ome and gal|lant
as any of his others.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the King &s;aw him, he cry'd out, &startq;What
are you ready to go?&endq; &startq;Yes, Sir, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> one
cannot make too much ha&s;te to execute your
Commands, therefore I am come to take my leave
of you.&endq; The King could not but relent, &s;eeing
&s;o young, &s;o beautiful, and &s;o accompli&s;hed a
Knight, then going to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the grea|te&s;t
Danger Man could ever undergo; he embraced
him, and gave him his Picture &s;et in Diamonds,
which <HI>Fortunio</HI> received with extraordinary Joy;
for the King's great Qualities had &s;uch an effect
upon him, that he could not think any &s;o lovely as
him; and if he had any Reluctancy to go, it pro|ceeded
more from being deprived of his Pre&s;ence,
than his Fear of being devoured by the Dragon.
The King would have a general Order included in
<HI>Fortunio</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion, for all his Subjects to aid and
a&s;&s;i&s;t him, whenever he &s;hould &s;tand in need. Af|terwards
he took his leave of the King, and that
nothing might be remarked in his Behaviour, went
al&s;o to the Queen, who was &s;at at her Toilet, &s;ur|rounded
by a great number of Ladies. She changed
Colour as &s;oon as ever &s;he &s;aw him, &s;o much had
&s;he to reproach her&s;elf withal; he &s;aluted her re|&s;pectfully,
and asked her, if &s;he would honour
him with her Commands, &s;ince he was ju&s;t then
going. The&s;e la&s;t words put her into the ut|mo&s;t
Con&s;ternation, while <HI>Florida,</HI> who knew not
what the Queen had plotted again&s;t the Knight,
remained like one Thunder-&s;truck, and would wil|lingly
have had &s;ome private Di&s;cour&s;e with him,
but that he avoided it as much as po&s;&s;ible: &startq;I be|&s;eech
Heaven, <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> that you may con|quer,
and return in Triumph.&endq; &startq;Madam, <HI>reply'd
the Knight,</HI> your Maje&s;ty honours me too much,
and, I am &s;en&s;ible, knows very well the Danger
to which I &s;hall be expo&s;ed; yet I have a great
deal of Confidence, and perhaps am the only Per|&s;on
<PB N="32" REF="33">
that entertains any hopes on this occa&s;ion.&endq;
The Queen under&s;tood very well what he meant,
and, without di&s;pute, had returned him &s;ome An|&s;wer
to this Reproach, had there not been &s;o many
Witne&s;&s;es pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Knight afterwards went away, and ordered
his &s;even notable Dome&s;ticks to take hor&s;e, and fol|low
him, becau&s;e the time was then come to make
proof of what they could do. They all expre&s;&s;ed
their Joy to &s;erve him, and got every thing done in
le&s;s than an hour's time, and went along with him,
a&s;&s;uring him, that they would neglect nothing they
could do to &s;erve him; and when they were out in
the Country, &s;hewed their Addre&s;s. <HI>Trinquet</HI> drank
up the Lakes and Ponds, and catched delicate Fi&s;h
for his Ma&s;ter's Dinner; <HI>Lightfoot</HI> hunted down Veni|&s;on,
and catched Hares by the Ears; and for the
good <HI>Mark&s;man,</HI> he neither gave Partridge nor
Phea&s;ant any Quarter; and whatever Game they
killed, <HI>Strongback</HI> carried it. By this means <HI>Fortunio</HI>
had no occa&s;ion to draw his Pur&s;e-&s;trings all his
Journey, and might have had very good Diver&s;ion,
if his Thoughts had been le&s;s employed on tho&s;e he
left behind him. The King's Merit was always in
his mind, and the Queen's Malice appeared &s;o great,
that he could not but dete&s;t her. Thus he travelled
all the way very thoughtful, till he was rouzed
from his Mu&s;ings by the Shrieks of poor Pea&s;ants half
devoured by the Dragon; &s;ome, that had e&s;caped,
he &s;aw flying as fa&s;t as they could, who would not
&s;top nor &s;tay, which obliged him to ride after them
to get intelligence. After he had talked with them,
and learnt that the Dragon was not far off, he ask'd
them how they &s;ecured them&s;elves from him. To
which they an&s;wered, &startq;That as Water was very &s;carce
in that Country, and that they had none but what
they pre&s;erved when it rained in Ponds; at which
the Dragon, when he went his Rounds, came to
drink, making a terrible Noi&s;e and Roaring,
which might be heard a League off; that then
<PB N="33" REF="34">
every body hid them&s;elves, and &s;hut their Doors
and Windows.</P>
<P>The Knight went into an Inn, not &s;o much to
re&s;t him&s;elf, as to advi&s;e with his Hor&s;e: When
every one was retired, and gone to re&s;t, he went
into the Stable, and &s;aid, &startq;<HI>Comrade,</HI> how &s;hall we
conquer this Dragon?&endq; To which the Hor&s;e re|ply'd,
&startq;Sir, I will dream to-night, and give you an
account in the morning.&endq; Accordingly next
morning, when he came again, he &s;aid, &startq;Let <HI>Fine-Ear</HI>
li&s;ten whether the Dragon is nigh at hand, or
not.&endq; <HI>Fine-Ear</HI> laid him&s;elf on the Ground, and
heard the Dragon about &s;even Leagues off. When
the Hor&s;e was informed of this, he &s;aid to <HI>Fortunio,</HI>
&startq;Bid <HI>Trirquet</HI> go and drink up all the Water out of
a large Pond, and <HI>Strongback</HI> carry Wine enough
to fill it; then let there be dry'd Rai&s;ins, pep|pered
and &s;alted Meats &s;et by it: afterwards or|der
all the Inhabitants to keep their Hou&s;es, and
likewi&s;e do you and your Attendants the &s;ame;
the Dragon will not fail to go eat and drink, he
will like the Wine, and you will &s;ee what will
happen.&endq; No &s;ooner had the Hor&s;e thus appointed
what was to be done, but every one did what he was
ordered: The Knight went to a Hou&s;e, from
whence he might &s;ee the Pond; and was no &s;ooner
within the doors, but the Dragon came and drank
a little: afterwards he eat &s;ome of that Repa&s;t pre|pared
for him, and then drank &s;o much, that he
was quite drunk, in&s;omuch that he could not &s;tir.
He was laid on one &s;ide, with his Head hanging
down, and his Eyes &s;hut. When <HI>Fortunio</HI> &s;aw him
in this Condition, he thought proper to lo&s;e no
time, but went out with his Sword in his hand,
and attacked him. The Dragon, finding him&s;elf
wounded on all &s;ides, would have got up, and fell
upon the Knight; but had not &s;trength, he had lo&s;t
&s;o much Blood. The Knight, overjoyed that he
had reduced him to this extremity, called his At|tendants
to bind this Mon&s;ter, that the King might
<PB N="34" REF="35">
have the Honour and Plea&s;ure of putting an end to
his $ife, and that being &s;o bound, he might be car|ried
without danger to the capital City.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> marched at the head of his little Troop,
and when he was within &s;ome few hours march of
the Palace, he &s;ent <HI>Lightfoot</HI> to acquaint the King
with the good News of his Succe&s;s; which &s;eemed
almo&s;t incredible, till the Mon&s;ter appeared bound
fa&s;t upon a Machine fit for that purpo&s;e. The King
went to <HI>Fortunio,</HI> embraced him, and &s;aid, &startq;The
Gods have re&s;erved this Victory for you, I am not
&s;en&s;ible of half &s;o much Joy to &s;ee this Mon&s;ter in
this Condition, as to &s;ee my dear Knight again.&endq;
&startq;Sir, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> your Maje&s;ty your&s;elf may give the
la&s;t Blow, I brought him hither on purpo&s;e that
he might receive it at your hand.&endq; At that the
King drew his Sword, and killed this his mo&s;t cruel
Enemy, while all the People gave Shouts and Ac|clamations
of Joy at &s;o little expected Succe&s;s.
<HI>Florida,</HI> who, during his Ab&s;ence, had not enjoyed
many quiet hours, was not long before &s;he was in|formed
of her charming Knight's return, and ran
to tell the Queen; who was &s;o much &s;urprized and
confounded thro Love and Hatred, that &s;he could
return no An&s;wer to what her Favourite told her,
but reproached her&s;elf a thou&s;and times for the ill
turn &s;he had plaid him; but then again would have
been better plea&s;ed to have heard of his Death, than
to &s;ee him &s;o indifferent: in&s;omuch that &s;he knew
not whether &s;he &s;hould be vexed or plea&s;ed at his
Return to Court, where his Pre&s;ence might di&s;turb
her Repo&s;e. The King, impatient, to tell her the
happy Succe&s;s of &s;o extraordinary an Adventure,
went into her Chamber, leaning on the Knight,
&startq;Here is the Man, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that has vanqui&s;hed the
Dragon, and has done me the greate&s;t Service I
could de&s;ire from the mo&s;t faithful Subject. 'Twas
to you, Madam, that he fir&s;t &s;poke of his De&s;ire
to fight that Mon&s;ter, and I hope you will re|&s;pect
him for the Danger to which he expo&s;ed him|&s;elf.&endq;
<PB N="35" REF="36">
The Queen, compo&s;ing her Countenance,
honoured <HI>Fortunio</HI> with a gracious Reception, and a
thou&s;and Prai&s;es, found him much more lovely
than when he went away, and gave him to under|&s;tand
how much her Heart was wounded, by look|ing
&s;o earne&s;tly at him.</P>
<P>But not &s;atisfied with explaining her Sentiments
by her Eyes, one day, as &s;he was an hunting with
the King, &s;he pretended to be out of order, that
&s;he could not follow the Dogs; and turning her&s;elf
towards the young Knight, who was ju&s;t by her,
&s;aid to him, &startq;You will do me a plea&s;ure to &s;tay
with me, for I have a mind to a-lit, and re&s;t
my&s;elf a little.&endq; Then bidding tho&s;e who attended
on her go forwards, &s;he and <HI>Florida</HI> alit, and &s;at
down by a Brook-&s;ide, where &s;he remained &s;ome
time in a profound Silence, thinking on what &s;he
&s;hould &s;ay. Afterwards lifting up her Eyes, and
fixing them on the Knight, &s;he &s;aid, &startq;As good In|tentions
do not always &s;hew them&s;elves, I am
afraid you have not penetrated into the Motives
that engaged me to pre&s;s the King to &s;end you to
fight the Dragon. I was a&s;&s;ured by a Foreknow|ledge,
that never deceives me, that you would be|have
your&s;elf with Bravery, of which your Ene|mies
&s;poke very indifferently, becau&s;e you went
not to the Army, that you lay under a nece&s;&s;ity
of performing &s;ome &s;uch illu&s;trious Action as this
to &s;top their mouths. I &s;hould have acquainted
you, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> with what they &s;aid on this
Subject, or ought to have done it, but that I was
per&s;uaded your Re&s;entment would be attended
with &s;ome fatal Con&s;equences, and that it would
be better to &s;ilence your Enemies by your Intre|pidity
in Danger, than by an Authority that
would &s;hew more of the Favourite than the Sol|dier.&endq;
&startq;The Di&s;tance between us is &s;o great, Ma|dam,
<HI>reply'd he mode&s;tly,</HI> that I am not worthy of
this Explanation, nor the care you took to ha|zard
my Life for the &s;ake of my Honour. Hea|ven
<PB N="36" REF="37">
has protected me more than my Enemies
$word$ for, and I &s;hall e&s;teem my&s;elf always hap|py
to venture for the King, and your Service, a
Life which is more indifferent to me than &s;ome
People imagine.&endq;</P>
<P>This re&s;pectful Reproach embara&s;&s;ed the Queen,
who under&s;tood very well what he meant; but &s;he
thought him too amiable to exa&s;perate him by too
&s;evere a Reply. On the contrary, &s;he pretended
to be of his opinion, and told him again, how glo|riou&s;ly
he had &s;lain the Dragon. <HI>Fortunio</HI> had been
&s;o cautious, as to let no Per&s;on know that it was
owing to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Retinue, but boa&s;ted
of his meeting that terrible Enemy barefaced, and
that the Victory was gained entirely by his Cou|rage.
In the mean time the Queen, who thought
not much on what he was telling her, interrupted
him, to ask him, if he was &s;atisfied how much &s;he
was intere&s;ted in his Safety; and that Conver&s;a|tion
had been carried further, but he &s;aid, &startq;Ma|dam,
the King is coming this way, I hear the
Horn, and will not your Maje&s;ty be plea&s;ed
to mount again?&endq; &startq;No, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, with an Air of
Rage,</HI> it is enough that you go.&endq; &startq;The King, Ma|dam,
<HI>reply'd he,</HI> will blame me for leaving you a|lone,
in a place expo&s;ed to &s;o many Dangers.&endq;
&startq;I di&s;pen&s;e with this your Care, <HI>added &s;he, in a
haughty Tone;</HI> go, your Pre&s;ence is trouble&s;ome.&endq;
At that the Knight made a low Bow, mounted his
Hor&s;e, and rid out of &s;ight, very much concerned at
the Con&s;equences that might attend this new Re|&s;entment.
Upon this he con&s;ulted his Hor&s;e: &startq;Tell
me, <HI>Comrade, &s;aid he,</HI> whether this love-&s;ick pa&s;|&s;ionate
Queen will find out another Mon&s;ter for
me?&endq; &startq;No other be&s;ides her&s;elf, <HI>reply'd the Hor&s;e,</HI>
but &s;he is &s;till more dangerous than the Dragon
you have killed, and will exerci&s;e both your Pa|tience
and Virtue &s;ufficiently.&endq; &startq;Will &s;he make me
lo&s;e the King's Favour, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> for that's all I am
afraid of.&endq; &startq;I cannot tell you what will happen
<PB N="37" REF="38">
in relation to that, <HI>&s;aid Comrade,</HI> it is enough that
I am always upon the Watch.&endq; There was no
more &s;aid then, becau&s;e the King appeared, and
<HI>Fortunio</HI> went to him, and told him the Queen was
indi&s;po&s;ed, and had ordered him to &s;tay with her.
&startq;I think, <HI>&s;aid the King &s;miling,</HI> you are very much
in her favour, and declare your Mind more pre|ferably
to her than me; I have not yet forgot your
Reque&s;t, to procure you leave to fight the Dra|gon.&endq;
&startq;Sir, <HI>an&s;wered the Knight,</HI> I dare not pre|tend
to clear my&s;elf from what you alledge a|gain&s;t
me: but I can a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, I look
upon your Favour and the Queen's with a great
deal of difference; and was a Subject allowed to
make his Sovereign his Con&s;idant, I &s;hould do my|&s;elf
an infinite Plea&s;ure to declare to you the Sen|timents
of my Heart.&endq; Here the King interrupted
him, to know where he had left the Queen, who
all the time of their Di&s;cour&s;e was complaining to
<HI>Florida</HI> of <HI>Fortunio</HI>'s Indifference. &startq;The &s;ight of him,
<HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> is hateful to me, either he or I mu&s;t
leave the Court, for I cannot bear that &s;uch an
ungrateful Wretch &s;hould &s;hew me &s;o much Di&s;|dain:
What Man would not think him&s;elf happy
to plea&s;e &s;o powerful a Queen? He is the only
Per&s;on whom the Gods have re&s;erved to di&s;turb the
Repo&s;e of my Life.&endq; <HI>Florida</HI> was in no wi&s;e di&s;|plea&s;ed
to &s;ee her Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;o chagrined, but in|&s;tead
of appea&s;ing her, rather aggravated, by re|calling
to her remembrance a thou&s;and Circum|&s;tances,
which &s;he perhaps would not have taken
notice of: which increa&s;ed her Rage, and made her
think on a new Project to ruin the poor Knight.</P>
<P>When the King came to her, he expre&s;s'd his
Concern for her Health; to which &s;he &s;aid, &startq;I
mu&s;t own I was very ill, but one cannot be long
&s;o, when <HI>Fortunio</HI>'s by, he is &s;o merry, and his
Je&s;ts are &s;o diverting: But you mu&s;t know, <HI>conti|nued
&s;he,</HI> he has de&s;ired me to ask another Favour
of your Maje&s;ty. He in&s;i&s;ts with the utmo&s;t con|fidence,
<PB N="38" REF="39">
that he &s;hall &s;ucceed in one of the mo&s;t
ra&s;h Enterprizes imaginable.&endq; &startq;What, <HI>cry'd the
King,</HI> would he fight with &s;ome new Dragon?&endq;
&startq;With a great many at once, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> and makes
as if he was &s;ure to conquer. I will tell you;
in &s;hort, he boa&s;ts to make the Emperor re&s;tore
to us all our Trea&s;ures, and to do it without an
Army.&endq; &startq;What a pity is this, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> that
this poor Boy &s;hould be guilty of &s;o much Extra|vagance?&endq;
&startq;His Victory over the Dragon, <HI>added
the Queen,</HI> has puffed him up; and what do you
hazard, in giving him leave to expo&s;e him&s;elf a|gain
for your &s;ervice?&endq; &startq;I hazard his Life, which
is dear to me, <HI>reply'd the King;</HI> I &s;hould be very
&s;orry to be the occa&s;ion of his Death.&endq; To this
the Queen an&s;wer'd. That his De&s;ire was &s;o great,
that if he was refu&s;ed, he would langui&s;h and die
away. The King upon this look'd melancholy, and
&s;aid, &startq;I cannot imagine who it is that fills his Head
with the&s;e Chimeras; it is unknown what I en|cure
to &s;ee him in this condition.&endq; &startq;Why the
matter is, <HI>reply'd the Queen,</HI> he has fought a Dra|gon,
and been victorious, perhaps he may &s;ucceed
as well in this; I have often a very ju&s;t Fore&s;ight,
and my Mind now tells me, that this Undertaking
will not be unfortunate: therefore, Brother, op|po&s;e
not his Zeal.&endq; &startq;Let him be call'd then, <HI>&s;aid
the King,</HI> and his Dangers be repre&s;ented to him.&endq;
&startq;That's the way to make him de&s;pair, <HI>reply'd the
Queen;</HI> he will believe you to be again&s;t his go|ing,
and I can a&s;&s;ure you he is not to be de|tain'd
by any Con&s;ideration that regards him&s;elf:
for I &s;aid all that can be thought on that Subject.&endq;
&startq;Well, <HI>cry'd the King,</HI> I con&s;ent.&endq; Upon this, the
Queen was overjoy'd, and call'd <HI>Fortunio</HI> in; &startq;Go,
Knight, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> and thank the King; he has
granted the leave, you &s;o much de&s;ired, to go to
the Emperor <HI>Matapa,</HI> and make him, by fair means
or force, re&s;tore our Trea&s;ures: Make the &s;ame
di&s;patch, as when you went to fight the Dra|gon.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">
<HI>Fortunio</HI> at fir&s;t was &s;urprized, but was &s;oon &s;en|&s;ible
that this proceeded from the Queen's Rage;
however, he felt a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure, in being able
to lay down his Life for a Prince that was &s;o dear
to him: and without excu&s;ing him&s;elf from &s;uch an
extraordinary Commi&s;&s;ion, kneel'd on one Knee,
and ki&s;s'd the King's Hand, who&s;e Heart at that in|&s;tant
relented. The Queen felt an inward Shame,
to &s;ee with what re&s;pect he behaved him&s;elf, tho
&s;ent to meet a certain Death. &startq;Would to Heaven,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,</HI> he had any regard for me; how
noble is it, not to contradict what I have ad|vanced,
but rather to bear the ill turn I have
done him, than complain!&endq; The King &s;aid little
to the Knight, but mounted his Hor&s;e again; and
the Queen, pretending all that time to be ill, went
into her Chai&s;e. <HI>Fortunio</HI> accompany'd them to the

the Knight,</HI> that this Emperor is the mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionate
of all Men, and that if I propo&s;e, that he
re&s;tore what he has taken from the King my Ma|&s;ter,
he will return me no other An&s;wer, than order
a Stone to be tied about my Neck, and that I be
thrown into a River.&endq; &startq;I am not uninform'd of
his Violence, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Comrade: but that does not
hinder you from taking your People along with
you, and if we peri&s;h, it &s;hall be one and all;
but I hope for better Succe&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>The Knight return'd home &s;omewhat comforted,
where he gave the nece&s;&s;ary Orders, and after|wards
went to receive his Credentials. &startq;Tell the
Emperor, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> that I remand back all
my Subjects he has in Slavery, all my Soldiers
<PB N="40" REF="41">
that are Pri&s;oners, all my Hor&s;es, and other Goods
and Trea&s;ure.&endq; &startq;What mu&s;t I offer him for all
this? <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fortunio.&endq; &startq;Nothing, <HI>an&s;wer'd the King,</HI>
but my Friend&s;hip.&endq; The young Amba&s;&s;ador had
no occa&s;ion for a great Memory to keep the&s;e
In&s;tructions in his mind: he went without &s;eeing
the Queen, at which &s;he was very angry; but
he had no rea&s;on to regard that, for what could
&s;he do more in the height of her Rage, than what
&s;he had accompli&s;h'd in the greate&s;t Tran&s;ports of
Friend&s;hip? And a Tenderne&s;s of this kind was to
him the mo&s;t formidable thing in the World. Nay,
her Confidant, who knew the whole Secret, was
enraged again&s;t her Mi&s;tre&s;s, for &s;triving to &s;acri|fice
the Flower of all Knighthood. <HI>Fortunio</HI> took
whatever was nece&s;&s;ary for his Journey out of his
Turkey-leather Trunk, and was not content to
clothe him&s;elf magnificently, but his &s;even Servants
al&s;o; and as they had all excellent Hor&s;es, and <HI>Com|rade</HI>
&s;eem'd rather to fly than run, they arrived
&s;oon at the Emperor's Capital, which was no ways
inferior to any City of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> was very much &s;urprized to &s;ee a Town
of &s;uch a large Extent. He demanded an Audience
of the Emperor, and had it granted; but when he
declared the Subject of his Emba&s;&s;y, tho it was
with a Grace that gave force to his Arguments,
the Emperor could not help &s;miling. &startq;Were you
at the Head of five hundred thou&s;and Men, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> one might hearken to you; whereas, I am
told, you have only &s;even.&endq; &startq;I never undertook,
Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fortunio, to compel you by force of
Arms, but only by my Remon&s;trances.&endq; &startq;Whatever
tho&s;e be, <HI>added the Emperor,</HI> you &s;hall never bring
them to bear, unle&s;s you will do a thing that is
ju&s;t now come into my head; that is, to find a
Man that can eat for his Breakfa&s;t as much hot
Bread as &s;erves this City for a whole Day.&endq; The
Knight at this Propo&s;ition &s;eem'd overjoy'd, and
as he &s;poke not pre&s;ently, the Emperor bur&s;t out
<PB N="41" REF="42">
into a Laughter. &startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fortunio, I accept of
your Propo&s;ition, and will bring to-morrow a
Man, who &s;hall not only eat all the new Bread,
but al&s;o the &s;tale; order it to be brought out, and
you &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him lick up
the very Crumbs.&endq; The Emperor &s;aid he con|&s;ented,
and all the Di&s;cour&s;e of that Day run up|on
the Folly of this Amba&s;&s;ador, whom <HI>Matapa</HI>
&s;wore he would put to death, if he was not as good
as his word. When he returned back to the Hou&s;e
where Amba&s;&s;adors were lodged, he called <HI>Grugeon,</HI>
and told what had pa&s;s'd between him and the Em|peror.
&startq;Never be unea&s;y, Ma&s;ter, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Grugeon,
I will eat till they &s;hall be tired fir&s;t.&endq; However,
notwith&s;tanding this A&s;&s;urance of <HI>Grugeon</HI>'s, <HI>Fortunio</HI>
could not help being under &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions,
but forbid him from eating any Supper, that he
might eat his Breakfa&s;t the better.</P>
<P>A Balcony was rai&s;ed on purpo&s;e for the Empe|ror,
and his Con&s;ort, and Daughter, to &s;ee this
&s;ight. <HI>Fortunio</HI> came with his little Train, and when
he &s;aw &s;ix great Mountains of Bread, he turned pale,
which had a quite contrary effect upon <HI>Grugeon,</HI> he
being plea&s;ed therewith. The Emperor laugh'd and
je&s;ted with all his Court at the Knight and his Re|tinue's
extravagant Undertaking, while <HI>Grugeon</HI> was
impatient for the Signal; at la&s;t it was made by
the Soundings of Trumpets and Beat of Drum, and
<HI>Grugeon</HI> fell upon one of the Heaps, and devoured
it in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, and after that
all the re&s;t. Never was greater A&s;toni&s;hment, eve|ry
body thought it was a piece of Witchcraft, or
that their Eyes deceived them, which made them
go to the Place where the Bread was piled up to
be &s;atisfied. <HI>Fortunio,</HI> who was infinitely well plea|&s;ed
with this good Succe&s;s, went to the Emperor,
and ask'd him if he would be plea&s;ed to be as good
as his word; to which the Emperor, inraged to
be thus over-reach'd, reply'd, that it was too much
to eat without drinking, therefore he, or &s;ome of
<PB N="42" REF="43">
his Train, mu&s;t drink all the Water in the Aqua|ducts
and Fountains that were in that City, and
all the Wine in its Cellars. &startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fortunio,
you would put it out of my power to obey your
Commands; however, I will try, if I may flatter
my&s;elf that you will re&s;tore to my Ma&s;ter what
I have demanded.&endq; &startq;It &s;hall be done, <HI>&s;aid the
Emperor,</HI> if you &s;ucceed in your Undertaking.&endq;
The Knight ask'd the Emperor, if he him&s;elf
would be pre&s;ent; he an&s;wer'd, Yes he would, be|cau&s;e
&s;o rare an Action de&s;erved his Curio&s;ity: and
getting that in&s;tant into his Chariot, carried him to
a Fountain of &s;even marble Lions, which vomited
up as much Water as form'd a large River. <HI>Trin|quet</HI>
made up to the Ba&s;in, and without &s;o much as
ever fetching his Breath, drank it up, and left the
Fi&s;hes in the Mud and Sand. In like manner he
did by all the Aquaducts and Ponds belonging to
the City. After this Experiment, the Emperor ne|ver
doubted but he would drink the Wine as well
as the Water; &s;o that he, as well as the Owners,
had no inclination to try him: but <HI>Trinquet</HI> com|plain'd
highly of that Inju&s;tice, alledging that he
had as much Right to the Wine as the Water; in|&s;omuch
that the Emperor, that he might not be
thought altogether covetous, con&s;ented to his De|&s;ires.
After that <HI>Fortunio,</HI> taking his opportunity,
put him in mind of his Promi&s;e; which, he being
unwilling to perform, put him out of humour. He
call'd his Council, and told them how much he
was concern'd, that he had promi&s;ed this young
Amba&s;&s;ador to return what he had taken from his
Ma&s;ter; but withal, he thought the Conditions he
agreed on were impracticable: therefore he a&s;&s;em|bled
them, to know how he might avoid what was
&s;o much again&s;t his Intere&s;t and Inclination. The
Prince&s;s his Daughter, who was a very beautiful
Prince&s;s, having heard how much he was embara&s;|&s;ed,
came to him, and &s;aid, &startq;Sir, as you know that
none that ever ran with me, could ever boa&s;t of
<PB N="43" REF="44">
the Victory, if you think fit, I will contend with
him, and if he reaches fir&s;t the Goal, you pro|mi&s;e
not to elude the Word you have given.&endq;</P>
<P>The Emperor embraced his Daughter, approved
of her Propo&s;al, and the next day, when <HI>Fortunio</HI>
came to an Audience, &s;aid to him, &startq;I have one
thing more to inform you of, which is, that if
you, or any of your Attendants, will run again&s;t
the Prince&s;s, I &s;wear by all the Elements, that
if you or he gain the Race, I will give your Ma|&s;ter
all manner of &s;atisfaction.&endq; <HI>Fortunio</HI> accepted
the Challenge, and <HI>Matapa</HI> appointed the time to
be within two hours, and accordingly &s;ent to his
Daughter, to bid her prepare her&s;elf again&s;t that
time for this Exerci&s;e, which was what &s;he had
been u&s;ed to from her Cradle. She appear'd at the
time in a long Walk of Orange-Trees, above three
Miles long, which was &s;o carefully rolled and ma|naged,
that there was not a Stone as big as a Pea
to be &s;een. She was dre&s;s'd in a light Gown of
Ro&s;e-colour'd Taffety, embroider'd in the Seams
with Gold and Silver; her Hair, which was very
fine, was tied behind her with a Ribbon, and fell
carele&s;ly on her Shoulders; her Shoes were made
like Pumps, without Heels; &s;he had on a Girdle
of Jewels, to &s;hew her Shape, which was delicate:
in &s;hort, &s;he thus appear'd like another <HI>Atalanta.</HI>
Soon after <HI>Fortunio</HI> follow'd, attended by <HI>Lightfoot</HI>
and his other Dome&s;ticks. The Emperor, and the
whole Court, were pre&s;ent, and &s;eated along the
Walk, when the Amba&s;&s;ador propo&s;ed <HI>Lightfoot</HI> to
have the honour to run with the Prince&s;s. He was
furni&s;h'd out of the miraculous Trunk, with a fine,
white, <HI>Holland</HI> Habit, adorn'd with <HI>Flanders</HI> Lace,
Silk Stockings of a Fire-colour, with a white Plume
of Feathers in his Cap. In this Dre&s;s he appear'd
to have a good Mien, and the Prince&s;s made no
exceptions again&s;t him; but before &s;he &s;et out, &s;he
had Liquor brought, to make her more &s;wift and
&s;trong. Our Racer demanded the &s;ame; the Prin|ce&s;s
<PB N="44" REF="45">
&s;aid, it was too ju&s;t a Reque&s;t to be refu&s;ed,
and ordered that he might have &s;ome: but as he
was not u&s;ed to that Water, which was very &s;trong,
it got into his Head, and he lay down by an O|range-Tree,
and fell fa&s;t a&s;leep. In the mean time
the Signal was given, and was repeated three times:
the Prince&s;s waited &s;ome time, that <HI>Lightfoot</HI> might
awake, and come to him&s;elf; but thinking it mat|ter
of great con&s;equence to free her Father from
his Promi&s;e, &s;he &s;et out with a charming Grace,
and wonderful Swiftne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunio</HI> was at the other end of the Walls, and
knew nothing of what had happen'd, when he &s;aw
the Prince&s;s running by her&s;elf, and within half a
Mile of the Goal. &startq;O ye Powers! <HI>cry'd he, &s;peaking
to his Hor&s;e,</HI> we are undone, I &s;ee nothing of <HI>Light|foot.</HI>&endq;
&startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Comrade, let <HI>Fine-Ear</HI> li&s;ten, he
perhaps may inform you whereabouts he is.&endq;
Thereupon <HI>Fine-Ear</HI> laid him&s;elf down, and tho he
was three Miles off, heard him &s;nore; whereupon
he told them, he had no thoughts of coming, for
that he was in as &s;ound a Sleep as if he was in his
Bed. &startq;Alas! <HI>cry'd</HI> Fortunio <HI>again,</HI> what &s;hall we
do?&endq; &startq;O! <HI>&s;aid</HI> Comrade, let the good <HI>Mark&s;man</HI>
let fly an Arrow into the tip of his Ear, to awake
him.&endq; At that he took his Bow immediately, and
hit him &s;o nicely, that the Arrow went quite thro
his Ear; the Pain and Angui&s;h of which awaken'd
him, and when he open'd his Eyes, he &s;aw the
Prince&s;s almo&s;t at the Goal, and heard great Shou|tings
and Acclamations of Joy. At fir&s;t he was &s;ur|prized,
but he &s;oon recover'd what he had lo&s;t by
&s;leeping; he &s;eem'd as if he was carried by the
Wind, and in &s;hort arrived fir&s;t at the Goal, with
the Arrow in his Ear, for he had not time to pull
it out. The Emperor was &s;o much amazed at the
extraordinary things that had happen'd &s;ince the
Arrival of the Amba&s;&s;ador, that he believed the
Gods intere&s;ted them&s;elves in his behalf, and that
he could no longer defer the Performance of his
<PB N="45" REF="46">
Promi&s;e. He order'd the Amba&s;&s;ador to come
to him, and &s;aid, &startq;I con&s;ent that you take a|long
with you as much of your Ma&s;ter's Trea|&s;ures
as one Man can carry; for I will never part
with any more.&endq; The Amba&s;&s;ador made a low
Bow, and thank'd his Maje&s;ty, and de&s;ir'd him to
give Orders that they might be deliver'd to him.
<HI>Matapa</HI> accordingly &s;poke to his Trea&s;urer, and af|terwards
went to his Palace of Retreat, within
&s;ome few Miles of the City. <HI>Fortunio</HI> and his At|tendants
went immediately, and demanded Entrance
to the Place where all the Trea&s;ure was kept. <HI>Strong|back</HI>
pre&s;ented him&s;elf, and by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance the
Amba&s;&s;ador carried off mo&s;t of the Furniture that
was in the Emperor's Palace; as five hundred gi|gantick
Statues of Gold, Coaches and Chariots, and
all manner of Conveniencies: and with the&s;e <HI>Strong|back</HI>
walked as nimbly, as if he had not above a
Pound Weight on his Back.</P>
<P>When the Mini&s;ters of State &s;aw the Palace thus
gutted, they made all the ha&s;te imaginable to ac|quaint
the Emperor; who&s;e Amazement was not
to be expre&s;&s;ed, when they told him that one Man
carried all: he cry'd out, he would not allow it,
and immediately order'd his Guards to mount, and
pur&s;ue tho&s;e Robbers of his Trea&s;ure. And though
<HI>Fortunio</HI> was then above ten Miles off, <HI>Fine-Ear</HI> told
him, that he heard a great Body of Hor&s;e coming
after them with full &s;peed: And the good <HI>Mark&s;|man,</HI>
who&s;e Sight was excellent, &s;aw them, ju&s;t as
they them&s;elves came to a River-&s;ide. <HI>Fortunio</HI> &s;aid
to <HI>Trinquet,</HI> &startq;As we have no Boats, you mu&s;t drink
up this Water, that we may pa&s;s it.&endq; Which <HI>Trin|quet</HI>
readily perform'd; and <HI>Fortunio</HI> was for making
all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to get away, when his Hor&s;e bid
him not be unea&s;y, but let the Enemy approach.
Soon after, they appear'd on the Banks of the Ri|ver,
and knowing where the Fi&s;hermens Boats lay,
embark'd immediately. When the <HI>Bo$&s;terer</HI> began
to &s;well his Cheeks, and with a &s;udden Bla&s;t over|&s;et
<PB N="46" REF="47">
the Boats, &s;o that not one of that Detachment
e&s;caped. This happy Succe&s;s puffed them up with
&s;o great Expectation, that every one began to think
of the Recompence he de&s;erv'd, and were for making
them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all the Riches they were car|rying
with them; whereupon, a great Di&s;pute aro&s;e
among them: <HI>Lightfoot</HI> &s;aid, they had got nothing
if he had not won the Race. &startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fine-Ear,
if I had not heard you &s;nore, where had we been
then?&endq; &startq;And who would have awaken'd you, if
I had not, <HI>added the</HI> Mark&s;man? &startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid</HI>
Strongback, I cannot but admire at you for your
Di&s;putes, &s;ure none dare pretend to lay &s;o good a
Claim as my&s;elf, &s;ince I carried all, and, without
my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, you would not have been able to
have partaken of them.&endq; &startq;Say rather without
mine, <HI>interrupted</HI> Trinquet, &s;ince you were in a
bad pligh$, if I had not drank your Way.&endq; &startq;Nay,
and you were equally in the &s;ame danger, <HI>&s;aid the</HI>
Boy&s;terer, had I not over&s;et the Boats.&endq; &startq;Hither|to,
<HI>interrupted</HI> Grugeon, I have held my peace,
but I cannot forbear repre&s;enting to you, that I
open'd the Scene to all the&s;e Events; for if I had
left one Cru&s;t of Bread, all had been loft.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Friends, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fortunio, <HI>with an Air of Command,</HI>
you have all done wonders, but we ought to
leave it to the King to recompence our Services;
for I &s;hould be &s;orry to be rewarded by any other
be&s;ides him. Let us all tru&s;t to his Genero&s;ity,
he &s;ent us to fetch his Riches, and not to rob him
of them; which Thought is &s;o &s;hameful, that, in
my opinion, it ought to be &s;mother'd: for my
own part, I will do &s;o well by you, that you
&s;hall have no rea&s;on to repine, &s;hould it be po&s;|&s;ible
for the King to neglect you.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;even gifted Men, penetrated with this Re|mon&s;tance
of their Ma&s;ter, threw them&s;elves at his
Feet, and promi&s;ed that his Will &s;hould be theirs.
After all this, the lovely <HI>Fortunio</HI> found him&s;elf, as he
drew nigh to the City, agitated with a thou&s;and
<PB N="47" REF="48">
different Troubles; the Joy that he had done the
King &s;uch con&s;iderable Services, for whom he had
&s;o great an Attachment, and the hope to &s;ee him
again, and be favourably receiv'd by him, flatter'd
him mo&s;t agreeably. On the other hand, the fear
of enraging the Queen, and being per&s;ecuted again
by her and <HI>Florida,</HI> put him into a heavy Concern.
In &s;hort, he arrived at the Town, where the Peo|ple,
overjoy'd to &s;ee &s;o much Riches and Trea&s;ure,
follow'd him to the Palace with great Acclamations
of Joy. The King, who could &s;carcely believe &s;uch
extraordinary News, ran to acquaint the Queen with
it, who was fir&s;t &s;truck on a heap, but recovering
her&s;elf afterwards, &s;aid, &startq;The Gods protect him,
therefore I am not &s;urprized he &s;hould &s;ucceed
in what he undertakes.&endq; And ju&s;t as &s;he made an
end of the&s;e Words, &s;he &s;aw him enter the room.
He inform'd their Maje&s;ties of what he had done,
and added, that the Trea&s;ures were left in the
Park, no other place being large enough to hold
them: and we mu&s;t ea&s;ily believe the King expre&s;|&s;ed
a great Friend&s;hip for &s;o loving and faithful a
Subject.</P>
<P>The Knight's Pre&s;ence, and the Advantages of
his Good-fortune, open'd again and dilated tho&s;e
Wounds in the Queen's Heart which were hardly
clo&s;ed up; &s;he thought him more charming than
ever, and as &s;oon as &s;he was at liberty to talk with
<HI>Florida,</HI> &s;he renew'd her Complaints. &startq;You know,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> what I have done to ruin him, which I
thought was the only means to forget him, yet
his unparallel'd Good-fortune brings him &s;afe
home again: and whatever rea&s;ons I have to de|&s;pi&s;e
a Man &s;o much inferior to me, and who has
repaid my Sentiments with the blacke&s;t Ingrati|tude;
I cannot forbear loving him, and am re&s;ol|ved
to marry him privately.&endq; &startq;Marry him, Ma|dam!
<HI>cry'd</HI> Florida, it is impo&s;&s;ible; certainly my
Ears failme.&endq; &startq;No, <HI>reply'd the Queen,</HI> you know
my Intention, and mu&s;t &s;econd me in it. I charge
<PB N="48" REF="49">
you to bring <HI>Fortunio</HI> this night into my Clo&s;et; I
will my&s;elf declare to him the love I have for
him.&endq; <HI>Florida</HI> in de&s;pair to be made the In&s;trument
of her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Marriage with her Lover, forgot
nothing &s;he could &s;ay to di&s;&s;uade the Queen from
&s;eeing him. She repre&s;ented that the King would
be angry &s;hould it be found out, and perhaps might
put the Knight to death, or at lea&s;t would condemn
him to perpetual Impri&s;onment, where &s;he would
never have the &s;ight of him again: but all her
Eloquence was in vain; &s;he &s;aw the Queen began
to be in a Pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore was obliged to
obey her. She found <HI>Fortunio</HI> in the Gallery of the
Palace, ranging in order the golden Statues he
brought from the Emperor <HI>Matapa.</HI> She went to
him, and told him her Me&s;&s;age from the Queen,
which made him tremble, and cau&s;ed <HI>Florida</HI> no
&s;mall Trouble. &startq;O Heavens! <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> how much I
pity you; why could not that Prince&s;s's Heart
e&s;cape you? Alas! I know one not half &s;o dange|rous,
that dares not explain it&s;elf.&endq; The Knight
would not engage in a new Declaration; too much
was he chagrin'd already, but left her, and as he
had no de&s;ire to plea&s;e the Queen, dre&s;s'd him&s;elf
but indifferently, that &s;he might not think he &s;trove
to &s;et him&s;elf off; but if he could throw off his
Jewels and Imbroideries, he could not do the &s;ame
by his natural Charms. The Queen, for her part,
did what &s;he could to heighten the Lu&s;tre of hers
by an extraordinary fine Dre&s;s, and ob&s;erv'd with
plea&s;ure that <HI>Fortunio</HI> &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd. &startq;Appearances,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> are &s;ometimes &s;o deceitful, that I was
willing to ju&s;tify my&s;elf concerning what you
have thought without doubt of my Conduct, when
I engaged the King to &s;end you to the Emperor,
it &s;eem'd in all appearance as if I de&s;ign'd to &s;a|crifice
you; but depend upon it, good Knight, I
knew what would happen, and had no other
Views than your immortal Honour.&endq; &startq;Madam,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you are too much above me to need any
<PB N="49" REF="50">
Explanation; I enter not into the Motives that
ingaged you; it is enough for me that I obey'd
the King my Sovereign.&endq; &startq;You &s;hew too much
Indifference, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> for the declaration I make
you of my Sentiments; but tis time I convince you
of my Bounty. Come, <HI>Fortunio,</HI> receive my Hand as
the Pledge of my Faith.&endq;</P>
<P>The poor Knight, quite Thunder-&s;truck, was
twenty times going to acquaint the Queen with
his Sex, and dur&s;t not; but an&s;wering tho&s;e To|kens
of Friend&s;hip with great Coldne&s;s, u&s;ed a
great many Arguments upon the King's Anger,
when he &s;hould know a Subject dur&s;t be &s;o bold as
to contract, in his Court, &s;o important a Marriage
without his Con&s;ent. After the Queen had
endeavour'd, tho in vain, to remove the Ob&s;tacles
which he &s;eem'd to fear, &s;he all on a &s;udden a&s;&s;u|med
the Countenance and Voice of a Fairy, loaded
him with Menaces and Wrongs, and fought and
&s;cratch'd him; after that, turning her Rage upon
her&s;elf, &s;he tore off her Hair, claw'd her Face and
Neck till &s;he was all in Gore-blood; rent her Veil
and Head-dre&s;s all in pieces, and then call'd in her
Guards, ordering them to carry the Wretch, as &s;he
call'd him, to &s;ome Dungeon, and in the mean time
ran her&s;elf to the King to demand Ju&s;tice again&s;t
that young Mon&s;ter: telling him that he had had
a long time the boldne&s;s to declare his Pa&s;&s;ion, and
that in hopes that Ab&s;ence and her Severities might
have cured him, &s;he had let no opportunity &s;lip, as
he might well ob&s;erve, to have him removed out
of the way; but that he was one that nothing could
change: that he him&s;elf was a witne&s;s to what Ex|tremities
his Pa&s;&s;ion had brought him; that &s;he
would have him pro&s;ecuted with all rigour; and
that if he refu&s;ed her that Ju&s;tice, &s;he &s;hould be
obliged to &s;tand upon her own Guard for the future.</P>
<P>The manner in which &s;he &s;poke, amazed the King;
he knew her to be a Woman of a mo&s;t violent Tem|per,
and that withal &s;he had a great Power, and
<PB N="50" REF="51">
could rai&s;e great Di&s;tractions in the Kingdom. <HI>For|tunio</HI>'s
Boldne&s;s de&s;erved an exemplary Puni&s;hment;
what was pa&s;s'd was publickly known to the whole
World, and it was his duty to revenge his Si&s;ter's
Affront: but alas! on whom was his Fury to light?
On a Knight who had expo&s;ed his Life to the grea|te&s;t
Dangers, to whom he owed his Quiet and all
his Trea&s;ures, and one be&s;ides for whom he had a
particular value and love. He would have almo&s;t
lo&s;t his own Life to &s;ave this dear Favourite. He
repre&s;ented to the Queen the Services he had done
both him and the State, his Youth, and whatever
might induce her to forgive him; but &s;he would
give no ear to what he &s;aid, but demanded his Life.
The King &s;eeing he could not po&s;&s;ibly avoid his be|ing
try'd, appointed Judges that he thought to be
the mo&s;t mild and &s;u&s;ceptible of Tenderne&s;s, who
might put the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction upon the
Letter of the Law: but he was mi&s;taken in his
conjectures; the Judges were for e&s;tabli&s;hing their
Reputation at this poor unhappy Knight's expence;
and as it was an A$$air that would make a great
noi&s;e in the World, they arm'd them&s;elves with the
utmo&s;t rigour, and condemned <HI>Fortunio</HI> without hear|ing
him plead for him&s;elf. His Sentence was to re|ceive
three Stabs in the Heart, as the principal
part concern'd.</P>
<P>The King dreaded this Sentence as much as if it
was to have been pronounced again&s;t him&s;elf; he
bani&s;h'd all the Judges, but could not &s;ave his belo|ved
<HI>Fortunio,</HI> while the Queen triumph'd in the
Puni&s;hment he was to &s;uffer. The King made u&s;e
of fre&s;h Arguments, which only exa&s;perated her
the more. To be &s;hort, the day appointed for this
horrid Execution came: the Knight was brought
out of the Pri&s;on where he had been kept from the
Speech of all Per&s;ons, not knowing the Crime he
was accu&s;ed of, but imagining that it was &s;ome
new Per&s;ecution, which his Indifference for the
Queen had brought upon him; yet what troubled
<PB N="51" REF="52">
him the mo&s;t was, he thought the King &s;econded
that Prince&s;s in what &s;he did. In the mean time
<HI>Florida,</HI> incon&s;olable for the condition to which her
Lover was reduced, took a re&s;olution of the utmo&s;t
Violence, which was to poi&s;on both the Queen and
her&s;elf if <HI>Fortunio</HI> was to &s;uffer death &s;o unju&s;tly.
As &s;oon as &s;he knew the Sentence, De&s;pair po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
her Soul, and &s;he thought of nothing but the exe|cution
of her de&s;igns; but it happen'd that the Poi|&s;on
was not prepared &s;o &s;trong as &s;he intended it&punc;
in&s;omuch, that tho &s;he had given it the Queen,
&s;he felt not pre&s;ently the effects of it, but had the
lovely Knight brought to the great Space before the
Palace, that &s;he might have the &s;atisfaction of &s;ee|ing
him die. When the Executioners had taken
him out of the Dungeon where he lay, and brought
him like a tender Lamb going to the &s;laughter;
the fir&s;t Object that his eyes beheld when he came
upon the Scaffold, was the Queen, who thought &s;he
could not be too nigh, being de&s;irous to have his
Blood &s;purt on her. But, alas! the poor King &s;hut
him&s;elf up in his Clo&s;et, that he might with more
freedom bewail the Fate of his dear Favourite.</P>
<P>But when they had bound <HI>Fortunio,</HI> and came to
open his Brea&s;t; how great was the &s;urprize of
that numerous A&s;&s;embly, when they &s;aw the white
Brea&s;ts of a lovely Maid, and knew that &s;he was
an innocent Dam&s;el unju&s;tly accu&s;ed! The Queen
was in &s;o great a confu&s;ion, that the Poi&s;on began
to work, and threw her into &s;trong Convul&s;ions,
out of which &s;he never recovered but to expre&s;s
her bitter regret. In the mean time the People,
who loved <HI>Fortunio,</HI> &s;et her at liberty; and the News
was pre&s;ently carried to the King, who had aban|don'd
him&s;elf to Melancholy. At that in&s;tant
Joy took place; he ran to the Palace, and was
charm'd to &s;ee the new Metamorpho&s;is of his dear
<HI>Fortunio:</HI> however, the la&s;t Sighs and Groans of the
Queen &s;u&s;pended in &s;ome mea&s;ure his Tran&s;ports;
but when he came to reflect upon her Malice, he
<PB N="52" REF="53">
was not &s;o &s;orry. He re&s;olved to marry this his
young Heroine, to repay with a Crown his great
Obligations to her; and declared his Intentions to
her, which we may ea&s;ily believe compleated the
height of her De&s;ires, which were &s;o much to be a
Queen, as to enjoy the Per&s;on of a Prince for
whom &s;he had always entertain'd a mo&s;t tender
Affection. The day of celebrating the Marriage
was fixed; our young Knight laid a&s;ide her Man's
Habit, and a&s;&s;um'd that of her own Sex, in which
&s;he appear'd a thou&s;and times more beautiful. She
con&s;ulted her Hor&s;e what Adventures &s;hould hap|pen
to her for the future; but as he could promi&s;e
none more agreeable, &s;he in gratitude for the
great Services he had done her, built him a Stable
paved with Ebony and Ivory, and in&s;tead of being
litter'd with Straw, he lay always on Mats of Sat|tin:
and for her &s;even Attendants, they were all
rewarded according to their Services.</P>
<P>After all this was done, News was brought to
our young Queen that <HI>Comrade</HI> was not to be found,
which was no le&s;s trouble to the King who adored
her, than to her&s;elf: &s;he made enquiry for three
days all to no purpo&s;e; and on the fourth &s;he aro&s;e
with the Morning, and went into the Garden, which
&s;he cro&s;t, and &s;o into a thick Wood, and thence
into a large Meadow, calling out, &startq;<HI>Comrade,</HI> my
dear <HI>Comrade</HI> were art thou? What do you for&s;ake
me! I have occa&s;ion for thy Advice.&endq; And as &s;he
was talking after this manner, &s;he &s;aw all on a &s;ud|den
another Sun ari&s;ing in the We&s;t, which made
her &s;tand to admire that Prodigy; but her Amaze|ment
&s;till increa&s;ed to &s;ee it approach her nigher,
and e&s;pecially when &s;he knew her Hor&s;e again co|ver'd
with Jewels, and prancing before a Chario$
of Pearls and Topazzes, drawn by four and twenty
Sheep that were cover'd with gold Fringe in&s;tead
of Wool: their Harne&s;s was crim&s;on Sattin buckled
on with Emeralds, their Horns were adorn'd with
Carbuncles. The new Queen knew the Fairy her
<PB N="53" REF="54">
Protectre&s;s in the Chariot, and her Father and two
Si&s;ters, who cry'd out, clapping their hands, and
making Profe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip, that they were
come to her Wedding. Their Si&s;ter, for her part,
thought &s;he &s;hould have expired with Joy at &s;eeing
them again; &s;he neither knew what &s;he &s;aid or
did: but at la&s;t recovering her&s;elf, &s;he got into the
Chariot, and return'd with this pompous Equipage
to the Palace; where every thing was prepar'd
for celebrating the mo&s;t magnificent Fea&s;t that ever
was made in that Kingdom Thus the enamour'd
King united him&s;elf to his fair Deliverer, and af|forded
us this charming Adventure, which has been
handed down from one Age to another.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of the New
Gentleman-Citizen.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DAndinardiere</HI> having li&s;tned with great Atten|tion
to the Story of <HI>Fortunio,</HI> and as he was ve|ry
&s;u&s;ceptible of Impre&s;&s;ions, the Prior ob&s;erving
that he cry'd heartily, &s;aid, &startq;What is the matter
with you? you &s;eem very much concern'd.&endq; &startq;Alas!
<HI>reply'd he,</HI> who can be otherwi&s;e? &s;ure his Heart
mu&s;t be harder than the Flints that hurt my Head:
who can re&s;i&s;t &s;o ju&s;t a Cau&s;e of Affliction?&endq; &startq;Had
that young female Warriour clo&s;ed the Scene
with her Death, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Prior,</HI> it would have
excited my Sorrow, but you grieve un&s;ea&s;onably.&endq;
&startq;Indeed, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, <HI>wiping his Eyes,</HI> her
Marriage makes her too happy for us not to &s;hare
in her Joy; therefore let us be merry, for I have
&s;ome rea&s;on to be &s;o, &s;ince the generous Pre&s;ent
you have made me of this admirable Story: the
Obligation is &s;o great, that I &s;hall always be ready
<PB N="54" REF="55">
to &s;acrifice my Life for you.&endq; &startq;O, you are too
full of Acknowledgment, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Prior,</HI> I de|&s;ire
no greater Recompence, than the Plea&s;ure
of &s;eeing you &s;hine among the mo&s;t ingenious In|ventors
of Stories, like the Sun at noon-day:
I will go and tell the charming <HI>Virginia</HI> and
<HI>Marthonida</HI> how much you excel them in this kind
of Writing, and that if they will come and &s;ee
you in your Chamber in the afternoon, you
will convince them thereof.&endq; &startq;Oh! you ravi&s;h
me, <HI>&s;aid he, cla&s;ping him in his Arms,</HI> I am per|&s;uaded
that this Work will immortalize me; I can|not
but think of the &s;ecret Rage of tho&s;e two Fair|ones,
when they come to know that I have a
thou&s;and times more Wit than them&s;elves.&endq; &startq;They
mu&s;t bear it with Patience, <HI>added the Prior;</HI> but
adieu, I have read enough to get me a Stomach
to my Breakfa&s;t.&endq; &startq;And I have heard &s;o much,
<HI>reply'd the Cit,</HI> that my Head &s;tands in need of a lit|tle
Repo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prior went and told the two young Ladies,
that <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> had fini&s;h'd an excellent Work,
and invited them to come and hear it. &startq;Indeed,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Marthonida, he has &s;o much Wit in his Face,
that at fir&s;t &s;ight one may be a&s;&s;ur'd he is capable
of doing whatever he plea&s;es.&endq; &startq;'Tis a great and
&s;ingular Happine&s;s, <HI>added</HI> Virginia, for a Man like
him, who has acted &s;o long in Blood and Slaughter,
who has been in the greate&s;t Battels, fought in his
time in <HI>Europe,</HI> to pre&s;erve as much Delicacy as
the learned and &s;tudious Gentlemen, that hardly
ever &s;tir out of their Clo&s;ets.&endq; The Prior had
much ado to forbear laughing, to hear that they
took <HI>Dandi$ard$ere</HI> for a Soldier, and one who was
both fear'd and admir'd in the Army, and would
not by any means undeceive them, being very de&s;i|rous
to conclude a Match between him and one of
tho&s;e young Girls. When he left them, away he
hurried to the Vi&s;count <HI>de Berginville,</HI> to tell him,
that before Night, Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> and the
<PB N="55" REF="56">
Cit would be at daggers-drawing about the Story
of <HI>Fortunio.</HI> &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible, <HI>cry'd the Vi&s;count,</HI> that
you &s;hould go to &s;et them at variance, ju&s;t at the
very time we are thinking &s;eriou&s;ly of uniting
them for ever.&endq; &startq;I own I am in the wrong, <HI>&s;aid
the Prior,</HI> but I thought it would be &s;o plea&s;ant,
to hear them on both &s;ides affirm, that they
compo&s;ed that Work, quarrel about it, and pro|duce
their Witne&s;&s;es, that I was not Ma&s;ter e|nough
over my&s;elf to forbear.&endq; &startq;I believe, <HI>re|ply'd
the other,</HI> it would create &s;uch an Aver&s;ion,
in&s;tead of Tenderne&s;s, that they would bear it
with them to their Graves.&endq; &startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI>
what &s;hall we do? he has the Story under his Pil|low,
and one may as well take away his Life as
it.&endq; I have thought on a Way how to get it,
&startq;<HI>reply'd the Vi&s;count;</HI> and that is, for you to keep
him in di&s;cour&s;e while I &s;teel it.&endq; &startq;That is the
way to make him hang him&s;elf, <HI>cry'd the Prior,</HI> for
he builds on nothing more than the Plea&s;ure or
per&s;uading his Mi&s;tre&s;s he has Wit: What a vexa|tion
will he be in, to have invited &s;o much Com|pany
to hear it, and to find nothing to &s;ay to
them? The only Remedy then that I know of,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the Vi&s;count,</HI> is for me to &s;end home to
my Wife for one which an Acquaintance &s;ent
her; for in &s;hort, he has not lent &s;o great atten|tion
to the Subject, but he may be deceiv'd, &s;ince
it treats of Fairies.&endq; &startq;I give my con&s;ent, <HI>&s;aid the
Prior,</HI> provided you manage the matter right, o|therwi&s;e
you are a dead Man.&endq; Hereupon the
Vi&s;count &s;ent away his Servant, who, as it was no
great way off, return'd &s;oon enough for his Ma&s;ter to
make the projected Exchange.</P>
<P>The Prior, full of Impatience, ran into the young
Ladies Chamber, and &s;aid to them, &startq;I always
took Mr. <HI>de la Dandinardiere</HI> to be as brave as <HI>Alexander</HI>
and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> but did not know that he was an uni|ver&s;al
Wit before: He has ju&s;t now fini&s;h'd a
Story that will go nigh to enrage all that have any
<PB N="56" REF="57">
Genius that way: and if he makes &s;o good a Be|ginning,
no body knows what he may arrive to.&endq;
And while he &s;aid the&s;e Words, he roll'd his Eyes,
and made a thou&s;and Grimaces. <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Mar|thonida</HI>
ob&s;erv'd a &s;trict Silence, which was owing
to their A&s;toni&s;hment at the News; and the Prior
re&s;uming the Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid, Yes, twenty times to|gether,
in an&s;wer to their Thoughts, Yes he will
excel yet more and more; yes, yes, he is a Prodigy
and Miracle of Nature. <HI>Virginia</HI> was &s;o taken with
what the Prior &s;aid, that &s;he cry'd out, &startq;Ah! Sir,
you prai&s;e &s;o well, that I look upon you to be the
greate&s;t Panegyri&s;t of all Men: I would &s;ay &s;ome|thing
my&s;elf of Mr. <HI>Dandinardiere.</HI>&endq; &startq;But Si&s;ter,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Marthonida, <HI>interrupting her</HI> let us rather have
the plea&s;ure of hearing this admirable Work as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.&endq; At that the Prior told them, he
would go in their Names, and make that Reque&s;t,
and &s;o took his leave. As &s;oon as he was gone, they
plea&s;ed them&s;elves with talking of the Satisfaction
they &s;hould have, but forgot not to dre&s;s them&s;elves
better than ordinary: To this end they each put
on a riding Habit they had newly made up of green
Mohair a Hat of black Velvet, which, through
U&s;e was turn'd of a ru&s;&s;et Colour, &s;et full of Pea|cocks
Feathers, with Scarfs of old tin&s;el Lace,
which hung down from their Shoulders like Ban|deleers;
at the end of which they had ty'd a
Horn, though they could not blow it: and, in
&s;hort, made a great &s;how of Magnificence in a
Country Village.</P>
<P>I know not what fanta&s;tical Planet ruled that
day, in re&s;pect of the Dre&s;s of the&s;e Heroines and
our Hero; who, in the hopes of &s;eeing them, was
con&s;ulting with him&s;elf what would &s;et him off the
be&s;t he could: for to appear before them with his
Head bound up, he could not bear the Thoughts of
it; and to pull off his Bandages, was ten times
wor&s;e. At la&s;t he re&s;olv$d to wrap his Wai&s;tcoat,
which was yellow, about his Head; and according|ly,
<PB N="57" REF="58">
made thereof a kind of Turban with the Sleeves
hanging down on each &s;ide: to this he added a
Gorget of Steel half eaten up with Ru&s;t, a Pair of
Gauntlets drawn on his Hands, and an Heap of
Cu&s;hions to &s;upport him. To &s;ee him in this ridi|culous
Dre&s;s, a Man mu&s;t be more au&s;tere than the
greate&s;t Cynick to forbear laughing. But all this
had the contrary effect on <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Marthonida,</HI>
&s;ince it made them admire him the more. As &s;oon
as Dinner was over, and the Cloth taken away, the
Prior engag'd Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> to go to &s;ee the
illu&s;trious wounded Cit, who had promis'd them
the reading of a Story. The Thoughts of hearing
a Work of Wit, flatter'd her &s;o agreeably, that &s;he
ro&s;e up pre&s;ently, and with a grave and &s;olemn Air
went into the dying Man's Chamber, follow'd by
her two Daughters, partly dre&s;s'd like <HI>Amazons,</HI>
and partly like Country Girls; yet notwith&s;tanding
this Fanta&s;ticalne&s;s, the Gentlemen were &s;o well
bred, as to give them their hands. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
was &s;o tran&s;ported with Joy to &s;ee them, that he
knew not what to do and was twenty times going
to jump out of his Bed to make &s;ome Bows and
Scrapes, as an Acknowledgement of the Favour they
did him. After every body was &s;eated, he &s;aid to
them in a formal Speech, &startq;I beg pardon, Ladies,
for pre&s;uming to invite you hither, &s;ince you per|haps
may expect to hear the Song of a Nightin|gale;
and I can a&s;&s;ure you, you will find it but
a Screech-Owl's.&endq; &startq;We are under no Apprehen|&s;ions
of being Screech-owl'd, <HI>reply'd Madam</HI> de St
Thomas, <HI>who pretended to a great Choice and Variety of
Words,</HI> &s;ince we know you to have too great a
&s;hare of the Nightingale's Warblings.&endq; &startq;I have as
great an Inclination to commend you as my Mo|ther,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Virginia, and can do it perhaps in Terms
no le&s;s har&s;h to the Ears? but the great De&s;ire
I have to hear your Story, impo&s;es a Silence on
me.&endq; &startq;Ah! Madam, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, you will,
<PB N="58" REF="59">
if I dont take care, undo me with Prai&s;es, which
proceeding from tho&s;e ruby Lips, almo&s;t &s;tifle me.&endq;
&startq;Don't hear them then, <HI>added</HI> Marthonida; a Merit
&s;o &s;hining as yours, is always expos'd to rude A&s;|&s;aults.&endq;
&startq;Charming Ladies, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> you heap
&s;o many Favours upon me, that my Silence is the
only means left me of Acknowledgment: How|ever,
Mon&s;ieur the Prior <HI>de Richecour</HI> &s;hall read
my Work, which I compo&s;ed in what you may
call po&s;t-ha&s;te; which makes me cur&s;edly a&s;hamed.&endq;
&startq;I have, <HI>&s;aid Madam</HI> de St. Thomas, <HI>interrupting him,</HI>
been admiring for above this Hour, the noble and
ea&s;y Expre&s;&s;ions you make u&s;e of, and mu&s;t own,
that you Courtiers have &s;omething in you that
&s;urpa&s;&s;es the re&s;t of Mankind.&endq; &startq;O Madam, <HI>re|ply'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, there are &s;ome Courts&mdash;but
that I was brought up in, is &s;o nice and deli|care,
that they will not there allow of the
lea&s;t Ob&s;cenity: All Barbarians are there ba|ni&s;h'd;
no Man but a Puri&s;t can live there.&endq; The
Mother and the two Daughters could have heard the
&s;ick Man a whole day, without ever interrupting him,
&s;o much were they taken with the great Words he
u&s;ed; when all on a &s;udden, they were di&s;turbed by a
great Noi&s;e made in the Yard, and upon looking
out of the Window, &s;aw <HI>Alain</HI> with a Cart and
three A&s;&s;es loaded with his Ma&s;ter's Study, and he
fighting with the Carter, whom he accu&s;ed of &s;teal|ing
a Mu&s;ick-Book; which piece of Inju&s;tice of the
Major-$omo's had &s;o inraged the Country I ellow,
that to Fifty-Cuffs they went, and <HI>Alain</HI> got well
lugg'd by the Hair and Ears, and thre&s;h'd for his
pains.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> at this News jumps out of Bed,
wrapt in one of the Sheets, and in that Equipage
ran to the Window, overjoy'd to &s;ee his faithful
<HI>Alain</HI> a Man of &s;o much Prowe&s;s; bu$ reflecting
pre&s;ently on the Irregularity of his Di&s;habille, he
addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the Ladies to make an Excu&s;e:
&startq;I own, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my Courage is &s;o trouble&s;ome to
<PB N="59" REF="60">
me, and overpowers me &s;o much, that I cannot
hear the lea&s;t Noi&s;e of fighting without being
moved: I have fought a hundred times, purely out
of the plea&s;ure I take in hearing the Swords
cla&s;h.&endq; Thus he kept talking, with the Sheet
half on and half off, his Turban awry, and on his
bare Feet; for being &s;een in which Po&s;ture, he was
in no great pain: when Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> de|&s;ired
him to get into Bed again, and &s;ent to part
<HI>Alain,</HI> who had already began to think of an ho|nourable
Retreat, having receiv'd &s;ix Blows for e|very
one he ga$e, and who indeed loved his own
Skin better than all his Ma&s;ter's Books; &startq;Keep the
Book, <HI>&s;aid he to his Antagon$&s;t,</HI> and let me alone.&endq;
&startq;No, <HI>reply'd the other,</HI> you have robb'd me of my
Honour; re&s;tore it me, or you are a dead Man.&endq;
Ju&s;t as he had &s;poke the&s;e Words, the Succours
Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI> &s;ent, came and deliver'd <HI>Alain</HI>
out of the inraged Carter's hands. But the Di&s;pute
began again with more Heat when he was to be
paid; for <HI>Alain</HI> was for abating him Tenpence, as
a Recompence for his bloody No&s;e and &s;well'd Eyes,
However, at la&s;t all was pacify'd, and the Cart and
A&s;&s;es went away, and the Books were left &s;pread
upon the Gra&s;s; where they were mo&s;t terribly
wet, by a &s;udden Shower that fell, before they
could be got into the Hou&s;e. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s Vexa|tion
made all tho&s;e who knew how ignorant he
was, laugh heartily. &startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my <HI>Greek</HI> Books,
tho&s;e dear Delights, when alone: Alas! my <HI>He|brew</HI>
Books, which I have began to tran&s;late
with &s;o much pains. Alas! my <HI>Latin</HI> Poets and
my Algebra. Alas! had you peri&s;h'd in the Sea,
or in the mid&s;t of a Town on fire, or by Lightning,
I &s;hould not have been &s;o much concern'd; but
to be de&s;troy'd by an ugly Shower of Rain in
the mid&s;t of a Yard, makes me incon&s;olable.&endq;
<HI>Virginia</HI> touch'd with the ju&s;t Grief of the learned
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> conjur'd him to forbear making
tho&s;e &s;ad Complaints, unle&s;s he &s;o$ght her Death;
<PB N="60" REF="61">
promi&s;ing withal, that all the Family &s;hould be
employ'd to dry them, and flattering him that
there would be enough to entertain him agreeably.
<HI>Marthonida</HI> added fre&s;h Arguments to tho&s;e of her
Si&s;ter; &s;o that he thought he &s;hould be very much
in the wrong, if he was not comforted, &s;ince the
mo&s;t amiable Per&s;ons in the World concern'd them|&s;elves
therein. Then the Prior demanding Audience
of the Company, began to read the following
Story.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Story of the Pidgeon and the Dove.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was formerly a King and Queen, who
lived in that &s;trict Union and Love, that they
were an Example to all the Families in their own
Kingdom, which was the Kingdom of <HI>De&s;arts;</HI> where
the Subjects lived together in that Harmony, that they
were the Surprize of their Neighbours. The Queen
had had &s;everal Children, but could rear up but one;
which was a Daughter of &s;uch incomparable Beauty,
that if any thing could comfort her for the lo&s;s of her
other Children, it was the Charms that appear'd in
this. The King and Queen educated her as their
only Hope; but the Felicity of this &s;mall Family
la&s;ted not long. The King being one day an hunt|ing
upon a fiery &s;tarting Hor&s;e, and &s;ome People
being a &s;hooting, the Hor&s;e was &s;o frighted at the
$ire and Noi&s;e of a Gun, that he ran away with
the King, and fell with him down a great Preci|pice&punc;
where he died immediately. This di&s;mal
News reduced the Queen to the utmo&s;t extremity;
&s;he was too &s;en&s;ible of Grief to moderate or re&s;i&s;t
it, and thought of nothing but &s;ettling her Affairs,
that &s;he might die with &s;ome &s;ort of Quiet; and
having a Friend, who was called, <HI>The Sovereig$
<PB N="61" REF="62">
Fairy,</HI> becau&s;e of her Authority over all Kingdoms,
and her great Power, &s;he writ a Letter to herwith
a dying hand, de&s;iring her to come, that &s;he might
expire in her Arms, and to make ha&s;te if &s;he would
find her alive, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;omething of con&s;e|quence
to &s;ay to her.</P>
<P>Though the Fairy had at that time matters of
great Concern upon her hands, &s;he left them all
unfini&s;hed, and mounting upon her fiery Camel, that
went &s;wifter than the Sun, came to the Queen,
who waited for her with the utmo&s;t impatience:
Fir&s;t, &s;he acquainted her with &s;everal things rela|ting
to the Government of the Kingdom, de&s;iring
her to accept of it, and withal to take care of the
little Prince&s;s <HI>Con&s;tantia.</HI> And then &s;aid, &startq;If any
thing can make me ea&s;y, in leaving an Orphan of
&s;o tender an Age behind me, 'tis the Hope you
give me of the &s;ame Marks of Friend&s;hip towards
her, as you have always &s;hewn me, and that &s;he
will find in you a Mother, that can make her
happier, and render her more perfect; and that
you will make choice of an Husband &s;o amiable,
that &s;he may never love any other.&endq; &startq;Great
Queen, <HI>&s;aid the Fairy,</HI> you de&s;ire all that can be
wi&s;h'd for, and I will forget nothing to &s;erve
your Daughter; but I have ca&s;t her Nativity, and
it &s;eems Fate is angry with Nature for having
exhau&s;ted all her Trea&s;ures in her Birth, and up|on
that account is re&s;olved to make her &s;uffer:
and your Maje&s;ty mu&s;t know, that it &s;ometimes
pronounces &s;ome Sentences that are not to be
avoided.&endq; &startq;However, <HI>reply'd the Queen,</HI> &s;often her
Misfortunes, and neglect nothing to prevent them;
by attention we often may prevent great Evils.&endq;
The Sovereign Fairy promi&s;ed what &s;he de&s;ired,
and the Queen having embraced her dear <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>
with all the Tenderne&s;s of a loving Mother, died
in great Tranquillity.</P>
<P>The Fairy, who read with great ea&s;e whatever
was foretold by the Stars, &s;aw plainly, that the
<PB N="62" REF="63">
Prince&s;s was threaten'd with the fatal Love of a
Giant, who&s;e Dominions lay nigh to the Kingdom
of <HI>De&s;arts;</HI> therefore &s;he thought the be&s;t way to
avoid him, was to remove her Charge to a part the
farthe&s;t off from that Giant, where they might
be in no likelihood of his di&s;turbing their Repo&s;e.
Whereupon, as &s;oon as &s;he had made choice of
&s;ome Mini&s;ters &s;he dur&s;t confide in, to govern in her
Ab&s;ence, and had enacted &s;ome Laws as judiciou&s;ly
contrived for the Benefit of the Subject, as any
that were made by the Sages of <HI>Grecce,</HI> &s;he went
one night into <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>'s Chamber, and, without
waking her, took her in her Arms, and carried her
on her fiery Camel into a fertile Country, where &s;he
might live free from Ambition and Trouble; it being
a true Repre&s;entation of the Valley of <HI>Temp,</HI> where
Shepherds and Shepherde&s;&s;es lived in little Huts of
their own building. The Fairy knowing, that if
the Prince&s;s lived to &s;ixteen years of Age, with|out
&s;eeing the Giant, that &s;he might return in tri|umph
back to her own Dominions, took all the
care imaginable to conceal her from the eyes of all
the World; and that &s;he might not appear &s;o beauti|ful,
dre&s;&s;ed her like a Shepherde&s;s: with her Coifs,
and Hat hanging over her Eyes; but that charming
Prince&s;s, like the Sun breaking out from a dark
Cloud, could not be &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, but that &s;ome of
her Charms mu&s;t appear; and notwith&s;tanding all
the Fairy's Care, <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> was every where men|tioned
as the chief Work of the Gods, and the
Ravi&s;her of all Hearts. Be&s;ides, her Beauty was not
the only thing for which &s;he was admired; the
Fairy had endowed her with a delicate Voice, and
the Knowledge of all In&s;truments, that &s;he might
be &s;aid even to excel <HI>Apoll$</HI> and the Mu&s;es. In this
Solitude &s;he lived without the lea&s;t repining, for
the Fairy had acquainted her with the Rea&s;ons of
bringing her up in &s;o ob&s;cure a manner; which, as
&s;he had a great &s;hare of Wit and good Sen&s;e, &s;he
reli&s;hed extraordinary well: In &s;hort, &s;he was the
<PB N="63" REF="64">
Admiration of the Fairy for her Docility and Apt|ne&s;s
of Apprehen&s;ion. But as her Pre&s;ence, at that
time, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the Kingdom of
<HI>De&s;arts,</HI> &s;ince the Mini&s;ters &s;he had appointed acted
not according to their In&s;tructions, &s;he was obliged
to leave <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> enjoining her not to &s;tir out till
&s;he returned.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s had a Favourite Ram, that &s;he had
bred up from a Lamb, and which &s;he called <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI>
with which &s;he u&s;ed to divert her&s;elf, dre&s;&s;ing
it up with Garlands of Flowers, and Bunches
of Ribbons. It knew her Voice, and would do
whatever &s;he bid it, and u&s;ed to skip about her
Chamber, and play with her for hours together.
Wherever &s;he went, it would go along with her,
would eat nought but what &s;he gave it, and would
&s;ooner peri&s;h with Thir&s;t than drink out of any
thing but the Palms of her Hands; it would &s;hut a
Door, beat Time when the Prince&s;s &s;ung, and bleat
by way of Cadence: In &s;hort, <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> was amiable,
and was loved by <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> who was continually
talking and making much of him. Notwith&s;tand|ing
all this, <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> was more taken with an Ewe of
the Flock than his Prince&s;s, and a poor &s;orry Ewe
was more in <HI>Ru&s;on</HI>'s Eyes than the Queen of Love.
<HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> often reproached him with his Wanton|ne&s;s:
&startq;Little Libertine, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> cannot you &s;tay
with me? thou art &s;o dear to me, that for thee a|lone
I neglect my whole Flock, and yet thou wilt
not for&s;ake that &s;cabby Ewe to plea&s;e me.&endq; After
that, &s;he tied him to the Wall with a Chain of
Flowers, whereat he &s;eemed very much vexed, and
kept pulling and tearing till he broke it. &startq;Alas,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Con&s;tantia <HI>in a Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> the Fairy has often
told me, that Men are as wilful as thee, that they
cannot endure the lea&s;t Confinement, and that they
are the mo&s;t refractory Creatures under the Hea|vens;
therefore &s;ince thou wilt be like them,
naughty <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI> go to thy na&s;ty Ewe, and if the
Wolf &s;hould catch thee, thou mu&s;t take it for thy
<PB N="64" REF="65">
pains, &s;ince it will not be perhaps in my power to
&s;ave thee.&endq;</P>
<P>The amorous Sheep, on whom <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>'s Advice
could not prevail, being one day with his dear
Ewe, nigh the little Hou&s;e where the Prince&s;s was
&s;et working all alone, &s;he heard him bleat out &s;o
loud and pitifully, that &s;he no longer di&s;puted but
&s;ome ill Accident had befel him; and being very
much concerned for him, ran to the door, from
whence &s;he &s;aw her poor <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> carried away by a
Wolf: and not thinking of the Charge the Fairy
had given her, ran after, crying out a Wolf, a
Wolf; and &s;till pur&s;ued him, &s;ometimes throwing
her Crook, and &s;ometimes Stones at him, but all
could not make him quit his Prey: when, alas!
pa&s;&s;ing by a Wood, there came out a terrible
Giant. The Prince&s;s, at the &s;ight of this frightful
<HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> lifted up her Eyes to Heaven to beg
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and almo&s;t wi&s;h'd the Earth would open
and &s;wallow her, but all in vain; &s;he de&s;erved
to be puni&s;h'd for not believing and ob&s;erving what
the &s;overeign Fairy told her. The Giant &s;pread
wide his Arms to hinder her pa&s;&s;ing by; and tho
he was both &s;avage and furious, neverthele&s;s he
was &s;en&s;ible of her Charms. &startq;What Godde&s;s art
thou? <HI>&s;aid he in a Voice loud as Thunder,</HI> think not
to deceive me, for thou art not mortal; therefore
tell me thy Name, or whether thou be the Wife
or Daughter of <HI>Jove?</HI> I have a long time &s;ought
after a Godde&s;s to marry her, and now happily
met with one.&endq; At the&s;e words the Prince&s;s re|main'd
mute, and he finding that &s;he returned no
an&s;wer to his Gallantries, &s;aid, &startq;For a Divinity
thou ha&s;t the lea&s;t Wit I ever met with, there|fore
I &s;hall put thee in my Bag.&endq; And without any
more ado open'd a great Sack and put her in.
The fir&s;t thing &s;he perceiv'd was the Wolf and the
Ram, which the Giant had taken as he was hunt|ing.
&startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s to the Sheep, ki&s;&s;ing it,</HI>
thou mu&s;t die with me, my dear <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI> but that's
<PB N="65" REF="66">
but a &s;mall Comfort; would it not have been
much better for us to have &s;taid at home?&endq; This
melancholy Reflection made her cry mo&s;t bitter|ly;
&s;he &s;igh'd and &s;obb'd, <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> bleated, and the
Wolf howl'd, which awaken'd a Dog, a Cock, a
Parrot, and a Cat, that were fa&s;t a&s;leep, and they
all together made &s;uch a noi&s;e, that the Giant tired
therewith, thought once to kill them: but at la&s;t
contented him&s;elf with only tying them up in the
Sack, and hanging it upon a Tree while he went
to fight a Duel with another Giant.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s never di&s;puted but that &s;he was a
great way from home, tho &s;he had not been long
in the Sack, for the Giant's moderate rate of walk|ing
was fa&s;ter than the &s;wifte&s;t Hor&s;e could gallop;
however &s;he took out her Sci&s;&s;ars, and ripp'd up, the
Sack, and let out her <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI> the Cock, the Cat,
and Parrot; and after them got out her&s;elf, leaving
the Wolf behind. The Night was very dark,
and the Prince&s;s a Stranger to the place where &s;he
was, and knew not which way to go, being in the
mid&s;t of a large Fore&s;t, and not a Star appear'd
in the Heavens that might afford her the lea&s;t light,
and &s;he always in fear of meeting the Giant: not|with&s;tanding
all this, &s;he went forwards, and had fell
a thou&s;and times, but that the Animals &s;he had &s;et at
liberty, out of gratitude &s;tay'd with her, and were
very &s;erviceable to her in her Journey. The Cat's
glaring Eyes &s;erved for a Flambeau, the Dog as a
Sentinel to give notice by his barking, the Cock
by his crowing to frighten the Lions, and the Par|$ot
by his talking &s;ecured her again&s;t Thieves, by
making them believe there were twenty People;
and the Ram by going ju&s;t before, pick'd out her
way that &s;he might not &s;tumble. <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> kept
walking on, at a venture, recommending her&s;elf
to the protection of her good Friend the Fairy, tho
at the &s;ame time &s;he reproach'd her&s;elf for not
having followed her Orders. Sometimes &s;he fea|red
&s;he was for&s;aken, and wi&s;h'd that her Good|fortune
<PB N="66" REF="67">
fortune would conduct her to the Hou&s;e where
&s;he had been brought up &s;o privately; but as
&s;he was intirely ignorant of the way, &s;he dur&s;t
not flatter her&s;elf with &s;o great an Happine&s;s.
At Day-break &s;he found her&s;elf by the &s;ide of a
River, that water'd a mo&s;t agreeable Meadow, and
looking about, &s;aw neither Dog, Cat, Cock, or
Parrot, but only <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI> that kept her company:
&startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> where am I? I am a perfect Stran|ger
to this &s;weet Abode; what will become of
me? Who will take care of me? How much
ha&s;t thou co&s;t me, my dear Favourite? <HI>&s;aid &s;he to</HI>
Ru&s;on: Had I not run after thee, I had been &s;till
with the <HI>Sovereign-Fairy,</HI> and had been in no fear
of the Giant, or any unlucky Adventure.&endq; <HI>Ru&s;on</HI>
trembling, &s;eem'd to acknowledge his Fault; and
in &s;hort, the Prince&s;s fatigued and weary, left off
chiding, and &s;at her&s;elf down on the Banks, where
the Shade of &s;ome Trees &s;ecuring her from the
Heat of the Sun, invited her to lie down to take
a &s;hort Sleep, while <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI> who &s;erved for her
Guard, walked around her. She had not been long
in a &s;ound Sleep, before <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> bleated &s;o loud, that
he awaken'd her; but then how great was her
A&s;toni&s;hment, to ob&s;erve at twenty Paces off a
young Man behind &s;ome Bu&s;hes; the Beauty of his
Shape and Face, the Noblene&s;s of his Air, and the
Magnificence of his Dre&s;s, equally &s;urprized the
Prince&s;s, that &s;he &s;tarted up all on a &s;udden, with
a Re&s;olution to be gone: but what &s;ecret Charm
detain'd her, I know not. She look'd upon the
Stranger with as much Concern, as if he had been
the Giant; but her Apprehen&s;ions proceeded from
different Cau&s;es: their Looks and Actions di&s;co|ver'd
too well the Sentiments they entertain'd of
each other, and they perhaps might have remain'd
&s;o &s;ome time before they had &s;poke, had not the
Prince heard the Sounding of the Horn, and the
Dogs approaching them. Perceiving &s;he was &s;ur|prized,
at la&s;t he &s;aid, &startq;Fear nothing, fair Shep|herde&s;s,
<PB N="67" REF="68">
you are &s;afe here, would to Heaven all
that &s;ee you were &s;o too.&endq; &startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I am a
poor Orphan, who&s;e only Employ is being a Shep|herde&s;s,
therefore I implore your Protection; pro|cure
me but a Flock, none &s;hall exceed me in
Care.&endq; &startq;Happy mu&s;t the Sheep be, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that
you lead! But in &s;hort, lovely Shepherde&s;s, if
you de&s;ire it, I'll &s;peak to the Queen my Mother,
and &s;hall take a plea&s;ure from this day to offer
you my Services.&endq; &startq;Alas! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Con&s;tantia,
I ask pardon for the liberty I have taken; I
&s;hould not have been &s;o bold, had I known your
Rank.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prince heard her with the utmo&s;t A&s;toni&s;h|ment,
to find her Wit and Politene&s;s an&s;werable to
the Excellence of her Beauty, all which was no
ways agreeable with the Plainne&s;s of her Dre&s;s;
and thereupon endeavour'd to di&s;&s;uade her from
being a Shepherde&s;s. &startq;Con&s;ider, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you will
be expo&s;ed in Woods and Fields to many Dangers,
where you have no other Company but your
harmle&s;s Sheep; be&s;ides, the Delicacies I have
ob&s;erved in you will not admit of that Solitude
you &s;eem to de&s;ire. Who can be &s;o ignorant as
to think, that when the Fame of your Charms is
&s;pread abroad, you can avoid thou&s;ands of impor|tunate
Lovers? I my&s;elf, <HI>Adorable Shepherde&s;s,</HI> will
quit the Court to follow you; and why may not
others do the like?&endq; &startq;Forbear, Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> to
flatter me with Prai&s;es, of which I am no ways
de&s;erving; I was born in a Cottage, and have al|ways
led a Country Life, and hope you will per|mit
me to look after the Queen's Flock, if &s;he
vouch&s;afe me that Charge, in all Tranquillity:
But yet I have one Favour more to reque&s;t, and
that is, that I may be put under &s;ome more ex|perienced
Shepherde&s;s, whom I &s;hall endeavour
never to di&s;plea&s;e.&endq; The Prince could not return
any An&s;wer to the&s;e Words, becau&s;e his Attendants
appear'd on a Hill at &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance, but &s;aid
<PB N="68" REF="69">
to her in great ha&s;te, &startq;I mu&s;t leave you, charming
Fair; I cannot bear the thoughts that &s;o many
&s;hould partake of the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing you:
go to the end of this Meadow, there is a Hou&s;e
where you will be entertain'd, if you tell them
I &s;ent you.&endq; Hereupon <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> who was loth
to be expo&s;ed to &s;o much Company, ran to the
Place where <HI>Con&s;tantio</HI> (which was the Prince's
Name) directed her, follow'd all the while by that
Prince's Eyes, who ferch'd many tender Sighs;
then remounting his Hor&s;e, he made towards his
Company, and with them return'd to Court, with|out
pur&s;uing their Sport any longer.</P>
<P>When he came to &s;ee the Queen, he found her
very much enraged again&s;t an old Shepherde&s;s, who
had given up a very bad account of her Lambs;
whereupon &s;he had order'd her never to &s;ee her
more. <HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> favour'd with this opportunity,
told her he had met with a young Dam&s;el that
&s;eem'd careful, and who was very de&s;irous to &s;erve
her. The Queen approved of what her Son told her,
and accepted of the Shepherde&s;s without &s;eeing
her, bidding the Prince give Orders for her to be
conducted to tho&s;e Pa&s;tures that belonged to the
Crown. He was overjoy'd that &s;he was di&s;pen&s;ed
with from coming to Court, for the Violence of his
Pa&s;&s;ion had created a Jealou&s;y of being rival'd, tho
there were none that could di&s;pute with him either
in Rank or Merit; but indeed he was not &s;o ap|prehen&s;ive
of the great Lords, as of more inferior
Per&s;ons, believing &s;he might have more Inclination
for a plain Shepherd, than for a Prince &s;o nigh to
the Throne. Hard it is to relate the many Reflec|tions
with which this was follow'd, how he re|proach'd
his Heart, that had never loved before,
nor thought any Per&s;on worthy of it, for &s;ubmit|ting
to a young Dam&s;el of an ob&s;cure Birth; and
&s;ince that he could not own his Pa&s;&s;ion without a
Blu&s;h, he re&s;olved to combat it, and per&s;uaded him|&s;elf
that Ab&s;ence was the only Remedy, particular|ly
<PB N="69" REF="70">
in a new-born Love. He avoided the &s;ight of
his Shepherde&s;s as much as po&s;&s;ible, and followed
his Diver&s;ion of Hunting and other Sports; and
whenever he &s;aw any Sheep, turn'd his Head a|way,
as if they were &s;o many Vipers, in&s;omuch
that in a little time he was in&s;en&s;ible of the Wound

of the Dog-days, fatigued with &s;evere Hunting,
and being alone by the River's &s;ide, he retired un|der
&s;ome Willows and O&s;iers, that by the uniting

His Curio&s;ity, at the hearing of his Name men|tion'd,
prevailing over the Plea&s;ure of li&s;tening to
the fine Singing, he ro&s;e up, and went to a little
Eminence, &s;urrounded with Trees, to look about,
he was no &s;ooner at the top, but perceived the fair
<HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> at the foot thereof, &s;itting by the &s;ide of
a Brook, the precipitant Fall whereof &s;eem'd, by
the agreeable Noi&s;e it made, to agree with her
Voice. Her faithful Sheep lay on the Gra&s;s by her
&s;ide, while &s;he frequently patted him with her
Crook, and he, in acknowledgment, looking her
in the face, ki&s;&s;ed her hand. &startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid the Prince
to him&s;elf,</HI> how happy would&s;t thou be, if thou
knew&s;t but the Value of tho&s;e Care&s;&s;es? This Shep|herde&s;s
is now more beautiful than the fir&s;t time
I &s;aw her! O Love! what is it thou require&s;t of
me! Ought I to love, or am I rather able to re|&s;i&s;t?
I have carefully avoided her, being too &s;en|&s;ible
of the Danger of &s;eeing her; witne&s;s, ye
Gods, the Impre&s;&s;ions tho&s;e fir&s;t Moments made
on me. My Rea&s;on I employ'd to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
I flew from the lovely Object; but alas! have
found it again: and too &s;ure, the <HI>Con&s;tantio</HI> &s;he
&s;poke of, is &s;ome happy Shepherd.&endq;</P>
<P>While he was arguing with him&s;elf after this
manner, the Shepherde&s;s aro&s;e to gather up her
Flock, to drive them to another part of the Mead,
where &s;he had left her Companions. The Prince,
fearing to lo&s;e this opportunity of &s;peaking to her,
made all imaginable ha&s;te to get to her: &startq;Charm|ing
Shepherde&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> give me leave to ask you,

blu&s;h'd, and her Complexion was animated with
the mo&s;t lively Colours: &startq;Sir, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> I &s;hould
have taken care to have return'd you my mo&s;t
humble Acknowledgments, if they had been con|venient
from &s;o poor a Girl as me to &s;o great a

for you to &s;hew it.&endq; &startq;Alas! Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, &s;omewhat

you &s;ung?&endq; &startq;As they are none of my making,

and thereupon &s;aid, &startq;Why, <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> do you con|ceal
your Thoughts, &s;ince your Countenance be|trays
too much the Secrets of your Heart? You
are in love.&endq; Here he left off, to ob&s;erve her with
more Attention: to which &s;he reply'd, &startq;Sir, what|ever
things may concern me, cannot be worth a
great Prince's being inform'd of; be&s;ides, I am
&s;o much u&s;ed to &s;ilence with my Sheep, that I

<P>As Jealou&s;y oftentimes helps to renew the Flames

force as never to be extingui&s;h'd; he di&s;cover'd a
thou&s;and new Charms in her Per&s;on, which he ne|ver
had ob&s;erved before; her manner of leaving
him, confirmed his Su&s;picion of her being in love
with &s;ome Shepherd: A profound Melancholy hung
over his Soul, he dur&s;t not follow her, tho de&s;irous
of more Di&s;cour&s;e with her; but laid him&s;elf down
on the &s;ame place &s;he ro&s;e from, and after recol|lecting
the words &s;he had &s;ung, writ them down
in his Pocket-Book, and examin'd them with great
Attention. &startq;'Tis but lately, <HI>&s;aid he to him&s;elf,</HI> that
&s;he has &s;een this <HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> with whom &s;he is
&s;o much enamour'd; how came I to bear the &s;ame
Name, and not al&s;o to enjoy the &s;ame Good-for|tune?
Alas! how coldly &s;he look'd at me? She
&s;hew'd more Indifference than when fir&s;t I &s;aw
her; her greate&s;t care has been to find out a Pre|text
to get away from me.&endq; With the&s;e torment|ing

Thoughts he rack'd his afflicted Soul, unable
to comprehend that a &s;imple Shepherde&s;s &s;hould
not have the lea&s;t Inclination to a great Prince.
When he return'd to the Palace, he &s;ent for a
young Lad, with whom he u&s;ed to divert him&s;elf
&s;ometimes, who was both of Birth and Fa&s;hion,
and one of the Prince's Attendants; he order'd him
to dre&s;s him&s;elf like a Shepherd, to feed a Flock
of Sheep in the Queen's Meadows, and to ob&s;erve
<HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> without being in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected by
her. <HI>Mirtain,</HI> (which was his Name) too de&s;irous
to plea&s;e his Ma&s;ter to neglect any opportunity,
promi&s;ed to acquit him&s;elf the be&s;t he could, and
prepared him&s;elf again&s;t the next Morning; when
he was admitted, by &s;hewing an Order from the
Prince, and &s;aying he was his Shepherd. He was
gallant, and found it no difficult matter to render
him&s;elf plea&s;ing to the Shepherde&s;&s;es; but for <HI>Con|&s;tantia,</HI>
he di&s;cover'd in her an Air of Pride above
what &s;he &s;eem'd to be, which made him think the
Country-Life &s;he led could not be agreeable to &s;o
much Wit, Beauty, and Merit: he followed her,
but all in vain, and found her always alone at the
bottom of the Wood, &s;inging an Air which &s;he
&s;eem'd very much to delight in. He could meet
with no Shepherds that dur&s;t undertake to make
any Addre&s;s, &s;o difficult it appear'd to plea&s;e her;
however, <HI>Mirtain</HI> attempted it, was always near
her, offering her &s;ome little Services, but found
by Experience, that &s;he would not enter into any
Engagement.</P>
<P>Every night he gave the Prince an account of
the Situation of Affairs, all which contributed to
his de&s;pair. &startq;Deceive not your&s;elf, my Lord, <HI>&s;aid

in love, but then it is with one in her own
Country.&endq; &startq;If &s;o, <HI>reply'd the Prince,</HI> why &s;hould
&s;he not return home?&endq; &startq;How do we know, <HI>ad|ded</HI>
Mirtain, but &s;he may have &s;ome Rea&s;ons that

her Lover.&endq; &startq;Alas! <HI>cry'd the Prince,</HI> the

<HI>Mirtain</HI> failed not to get an opportunity of Di&s;cour&s;e

you are ambitious, you think none but Kings
and Princes are happy? Be convinced of this Mi|&s;take:
I belong to the Prince <HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> and not|with&s;tanding
the Inequality of our Stations, am
&s;ometimes nigh his Per&s;on, and can ob&s;erve and

<P><PB N="74" REF="75">
Thus &s;he left <HI>Mirtain,</HI> tho no ways in&s;en&s;ible of
the Merit of his Prince; for from the fir&s;t time &s;he
&s;aw him, &s;he had never been able to blot him out
of her Thoughts: and without this &s;ecret Charm,
which detain'd her again&s;t her own de&s;ire, it is cer|tain
&s;he would have endeavour'd to find out the
<HI>Sovereign Fairy.</HI> Be&s;ides, it may be expected, that
that knowing Per&s;on, who could not be ignorant of
all that pa&s;s'd, &s;hould come to look after her; but
that lay not in her power, for after the Giant
had found the Prince&s;s, &s;he was forced to &s;ubmit
to Fortune for a certain time, in&s;omuch that the
Fairy was contented to come and &s;ee her in a Sun|beam,
again&s;t which <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> could not look &s;ted|fa&s;tly
enough to di&s;cern her.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> perceived with Rage, that the Prince
had neglected her, and that this &s;econd View was
entirely owing to Chance, that conducted him to
the Place where &s;he was &s;at &s;inging; &s;he was vex'd
with her&s;elf for the Sentiments &s;he entertain'd of
him, and if it is po&s;&s;ible to love and hate at the
&s;ame time, I may &s;ay &s;he hated, becau&s;e &s;he loved
too much. <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> was the only Witne&s;s of the Tears
&s;he &s;hed &s;ecretly, &s;ometimes &s;he would confe&s;s her
Grief to him, as if he was capable of Under&s;tand|ing;
and whenever he skip'd and play'd among the
other Sheep, &s;he would cry out, &startq;Take care, <HI>Ru|&s;on,</HI>
left Love inflame thee, which, without a Re|turn,
is the greate&s;t of all Misfortunes.&endq; The&s;e
Reflections were follow'd by a thou&s;and Reproaches
&s;he made her&s;elf, for the Love &s;he bore to a Prince
that appear'd &s;o indifferent, whom &s;he was &s;triving
to forget; when &s;he found him retired to that agree|able
Shade, to think with more freedom on the
Shepherde&s;s from whom he flew. There, &s;urprized
with Sleep, he lay upon the Gra&s;s, when &s;he came
and &s;aw him; her Pa&s;&s;ion increa&s;ed, and &s;he
could not forbear making tho&s;e words true, which
were the Cau&s;e of the Prince's Di&s;quiet. But then,
what were her Torments, when <HI>Mirtain</HI> told her,
<PB N="75" REF="76">
<HI>Con&s;tantio</HI> was in love? Whatever Re&s;traint &s;he put
upon her&s;elf, &s;he could not help changing her Coun|tenance;
at which <HI>Mirtain,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was
to ob&s;erve all her Actions, was not a little over|joy'd,
and ran to acquaint his Ma&s;ter. The Prince,
who was not at that time &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to flat|ter
him&s;elf as his Confidant, fancied he &s;aw no|thing
but Indifference in all the Proceedings of that
Shepherde&s;s, and accu&s;ed the happy and beloved
<HI>Con&s;tantia.</HI> The next Morning he went to find her
out; &s;he no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but &s;he fled from
him, as if he had been a Lion or a Tyger, think|ing
Flight the only Remedy that was left her: for
&s;ince her Conver&s;ation with <HI>Mirtain,</HI> &s;he thought
&s;he ought not to neglect the recovering of her
Heart again, and that the only means to &s;ucceed
therein, was to avoid him. But what became of
<HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> when his Shepherde&s;s left him &s;o &s;ud|denly?
&startq;You &s;ee, <HI>&s;aid he to</HI> Mirtain, <HI>who &s;tood by
him,</HI> the happy Effects of what you have done;
<HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> hates me, I dare not follow her, to know
her Sentiments.&endq; &startq;Alas! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Mirtain, you
&s;hew too much Re&s;pect to a Country-Girl; if you
think fit, I will go and order her to come to you.&endq;
&startq;Ah! <HI>Mirtain, cry'd the Prince,</HI> thou art a Confidant,
not a Lover; my Thoughts are entirely bent up|on
plea&s;ing that lovely Dam&s;el, I have di&s;cover'd
a Politene&s;s in her, that I am &s;ure tho&s;e rough
ways of yours mu&s;t be di&s;agreeable to, and chu&s;e
rather to endure my Pains, than di&s;plea&s;e her.&endq;
As he made an end of the&s;e words, he went away
&s;eized with a Melancholy deep enough to move the
Pity of an Heart le&s;s intere&s;ted than <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>'s.
As &s;oon as he was gone, &s;he return'd, to have the
&s;atisfaction of &s;itting on the &s;ame &s;pot of Ground
he had &s;tood on. &startq;It was here, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that he
&s;topt, it was from hence that he look'd at me;
but alas! in all the&s;e Places he has &s;hewn but too
much Indifference for me, and comes only to en|joy
the more freedom of his Thoughts on his
<PB N="76" REF="77">
beloved Mi&s;tre&s;s: But what rea&s;on have I to com|plain?
How is it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould engage him|&s;elf
to a Girl that he thinks &s;o much beneath
him?&endq; Sometimes &s;he was for informing him of
her Adventures, but the <HI>Sovereign Fairy</HI> had forbid
her &s;o ab&s;olutely never to &s;peak of them, that her
Obedience prevailed, and &s;he re&s;olved to keep them
&s;ecret.</P>
<P>Some days after the Prince came again, and &s;he
avoided him as much as before; upon which he
was very much grieved, and ordered <HI>Mirtain</HI> to go
and load her with Reproaches from him, which &s;he
pretended &s;he did not under&s;tand, but at la&s;t con|&s;ented
to &s;ee his Ma&s;ter: which words were no
&s;ooner out of her mouth, but <HI>Mirtain</HI> ran to ac|quaint
the Prince, who long'd with impatience for
the Approach of the next Morn. It no &s;ooner
appear'd, but he went to find his lovely Shepher|de&s;s;
&s;he &s;eem'd, at the fir&s;t &s;ight of him, &s;peech|le&s;s
and confu&s;ed, and much more &s;o when he de|clared
his Pa&s;&s;ion: and notwith&s;tanding her De&s;ire
of believing him, &s;he was afraid of being deceived,
thinking that he, looking upon her no otherwi&s;e
than as &s;he appear'd to be, might only divert and
plea&s;e him&s;elf, by making a Declaration no ways
&s;uitable to a poor Shepherde&s;s. Inraged at this
Thought, &s;he became more proud, and received all
the A&s;&s;urances of his Pa&s;&s;ion with a Coldne&s;s that
confirmed all his Su&s;picions. Upon which he &s;aid,
&startq;I &s;ee you are engaged, &s;ome happy Swain has
known how to charm you; but bear me witne&s;s,
Heaven! if I find him out, he &s;hall feel the Ef|fects
of all my Rage.&endq; &startq;Sir, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> I ask no
favour for any one, and if you knew but the Sen|timents
of my Heart, you would find them diffe|rent
from what you think them to be.&endq; At the&s;e
words the Prince conceiv'd &s;ome hopes, but tho&s;e
were &s;oon de&s;troy'd by the Conver&s;ation they had
afterwards; for &s;he prote&s;ted her Indifference was
not to be overcome, and that &s;he was very &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="77" REF="78">
&s;he could never love. The&s;e words again ca&s;t him
into an inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief, which he con&s;train'd
as much as po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he might not perceive it.
In &s;hort, whether thro the Violence he did him&s;elf,
or the Exce&s;s of his Pa&s;&s;ion, which was become
&s;tronger by the more Difficulties that oppo&s;ed it,
he fell &s;o dangerou&s;ly ill, that the Phy&s;icians, not
knowing the Cau&s;e, de&s;pair'd of his Recovery. <HI>Mir|tain,</HI>
who was by his Ma&s;ter order'd to attend on,
and follow <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> told her the di&s;mal News,
which &s;he heard with a Trouble and Concern not
to be conceiv'd. He ask'd her if &s;he knew of no
Remedy for a Fever, and violent Pains of the Head
and Heart; to which &s;he reply'd, &s;he knew of one,
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome Simples that &s;he could gather,
but that it depended mo&s;t on the manner of the
Application. &startq;Will not you go to the Palace, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> to admini&s;ter it!&endq; &startq;No, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing,</HI> I

he,</HI> can you neglect any thing to do us &s;ervice on
this pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ion? I always indeed thought
you cruel and hard-hearted, but now find you a
thou&s;and times more &s;o than I imagin'd.&endq; The&s;e Re|proaches
of <HI>Mirtain</HI>'s created a Plea&s;ure in <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI>
who was overjoy'd that he pre&s;s'd her to &s;ee the
Prince; for the obtaining of which Satisfaction a|lone,
&s;he boa&s;ted of a Remedy to ea&s;e his Pains.</P>
<P><HI>Mirtain</HI> went and inform'd the Prince of all that
the Shepherde&s;s &s;aid to him, and with what Ardour
&s;he wi&s;h'd for his Health. &startq;Ah! <HI>Mirtain, &s;aid</HI> Con|&s;tantio,
you intend to flatter me; but I forgive
you, and would willingly (dur&s;t I be deceived)
think that beautiful Maid has &s;ome Friend&s;hip for

Queen, who had never &s;een this Shepherde&s;s, &s;aid,

his Mother, to de&s;ire her from him, to let that fair

<HI>continued he,</HI> is this for her Pains! The

acquitted him&s;elf of his Commi&s;&s;ion to the
Queen; but as &s;he was naturally ha&s;ty, &s;he flew
into a Pa&s;&s;ion at the ficklene&s;s of his Re&s;olutions.
&startq;I have already &s;ent for her, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> if &s;he cures
my Son I &s;hall give her a Reward; if not, I know
what I have to do: go and endeavour to divert
him, for his Melancholy grieves me.&endq; <HI>Mirtain</HI>
obey'd, but acquainted not his Ma&s;ter with the re|ception
he met with, le&s;t his Fears for his Shep|herde$s
might do him a prejudice. The Pa&s;tures
belonging to the Crown being nigh the Town, it
was not long before &s;he came; be&s;ides, tho&s;e who
are guided by Love, are &s;eldom &s;low. The Queen
did not think fit to &s;ee her, contenting her&s;elf with
bidding her take care what &s;he did, and a&s;&s;uring
her, if &s;he did not cure the Prince, &s;he &s;hould be
put into a Sack, and thrown into the River. At
this Menace the beautiful Prince&s;s turn'd pale, and
her Blood ran chill in her Veins. &startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid &s;he
to her&s;elf,</HI> I de&s;erve this Puni&s;hment for the Lye I
have told, when I boa&s;ted of my Skill; and I
fear my de&s;ire of &s;eeing <HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> will not be a
&s;ufficient Rea&s;on for the Gods to protect me.&endq;
<PB N="79" REF="80">
Then hanging down her Head, the Tears ran trick|ling
from her fair Eyes. Tho&s;e that were by, ad|mired
her &s;o much, that they took her to be more
like an Angel than a Mortal, and &s;aid, Fear no|thing,
lovely Shepherde&s;s, your Eyes carry in them
Life and Death; one Glance from them is able to
recover our young Prince: go into his Chamber, dry
up your Tears, and apply your Remedy without Fear.</P>
<P>This manner of &s;peaking, together with her ex|treme
de&s;ire to &s;ee the Prince, in&s;pir'd her with
&s;ome Confidence. She begg'd leave to go into the
Garden to gather what was nece&s;&s;ary for the Cure,
where &s;he took &s;ome Myrtle, Trefoil, and other
Herbs and Flowers dedicated to <HI>Cupid</HI> and his Mo|ther;
the Feathers of a Dove, &s;ome Drops of a
Pidgeon's Blood, and call'd upon all the Deities and
Fairies for their Aid: and then trembling more than
a Turtle when &s;he &s;ees a Kite hovering o'er her
head, bid them conduct her to the Prince's Cham|ber.
When &s;he came there, &s;he found him in
Bed, his Face pale as Death, and his Eyes lan|gui&s;hing;
but as &s;oon as he &s;aw her, &s;ome &s;treams
of colour flow'd up into his Cheeks, which &s;he
ob&s;erved with great joy. &startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I have
often offer'd up my Prayers to Heaven for the
Recovery of your Health, and my Zeal engaged
me to tell one of your Shepherds that I knew
of a Remedy, which I would willingly make u&s;e
of to ea&s;e you; but the Queen has told me, that
if Heaven &s;hould abandon me in this Undertaking,
&s;he will put me to death. Judge, Sir, of my Fears,
and be per&s;uaded that I am more intere&s;ted in the
pre&s;ervation of your Health than my own Life.&endq;
&startq;Fear nothing, charming Shepherde&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the
favourable Vows you made for my Life, will ren|der
it &s;o dear to me, that all my endeavours &s;hall
be to pre&s;erve it. Alas! how can my days be
more happy, when I remember what I heard you
&s;ing of <HI>Con&s;tantio?</HI> Tho&s;e fatal Words, and your
Rigour, have reduced; me to the Condition you
<PB N="80" REF="81">
&s;ee me in; but, fair Shepherde&s;s, you bid me live,
and I will live for you.&endq; It was with difficulty
that <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> concealed the plea&s;ure &s;o obliging a
Declaration created in her Soul; and fearing le&s;t
&s;ome Per&s;on might hear what the Prince &s;aid to
her, &s;he ask'd him, if he would give her leave to
put on a Bandage and Bracelets of the Herbs &s;he
had gather'd; at which he held out his Arm in a
tender manner, and &s;he tied on one of the Brace|lets
pre&s;ently, having fir&s;t perform'd &s;ome little
Ceremonies to amu&s;e the Prince's Court. The
Prince cry'd out a few moments after, that he was
better; and the Phy&s;icians being call'd in, were
&s;urprized at the Excellence of a Medicine, the Ef|fects
of which were &s;o quick: but when they &s;aw
the Shepherde&s;s that apply'd it, their Amazement
$ani&s;h'd; and they &s;aid to one another, that there
was more virtue in one Look from her, than all
their Medicines together. The Shepherde&s;s was
&s;o little affected with the Prai&s;es they be&s;tow'd on
her, that tho&s;e that knew her not, took that for
Stupidity which proceeded from a different Cau&s;e;
for &s;he placed her&s;elf behind one of the Bed-Cur|tains,
hiding her&s;elf from every one but her &s;ick
Patient, who&s;e Head and Pul&s;e &s;he often &s;toop'd to
feel; and in tho&s;e little opportunities they &s;aid
thou&s;ands of tender things to each other. &startq;I hope,
Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him,</HI> the Sack the Queen provided
for to drown me in, will be put to a better u&s;e,
&s;ince your Health, which is &s;o precious to me, is
in a fair way of being re&s;tored.&endq; &startq;It depends en|tirely
on you, lovely <HI>Con&s;tantia, replied he;</HI> a little
Share in your Heart will compleat both my Health
and Happine&s;s.&endq; She ro&s;e &s;oon after and went to
the Queen's Apartment, who, when &s;he was told
the Prince was coming, would not believe it, but
was very much &s;urprized to meet him at her Cham|ber-Door.
&startq;What! Is it you, my dear Child? <HI>cry'd
&s;he:</HI> To whom am I obliged for this?&endq; &startq;To your
own Bounty, Madam, <HI>replied he,</HI> in &s;ending me
<PB N="81" REF="82">
the mo&s;t abl Per&s;on in the World; whom I de|&s;ire
you to recompence according to the Benefit I
have received from her.&endq; &startq;Never mind that, <HI>&s;aid
the Queen in a carele&s;s manner,</HI> &s;he is a poor Shep|herde&s;s
who will think her&s;elf happy to keep my
Sheep, trouble not your&s;elf about that.&endq; The King
coming in ju&s;t upon this, and being told the good
News of the Prince's Recovery, and his being with
the Queen; as he was making towards that Apart|ment,
<HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> was the fir&s;t Object that &s;truck his
Eyes: her Beauty, like the Sun &s;hining among the
le&s;&s;er Lights, dazzled him &s;o much, that he was
&s;ome time before he could ask tho&s;e about him
what &s;he was, and how long Godde&s;&s;es had inhabi|ted
his Palace; at la&s;t recovering him&s;elf, he went
towards her, and knowing her to be the Inchan|tre&s;s
that had cured his Son, imbraced her, and
told her in a gallant manner, that if he &s;hould be
ill, he would beg of her to cure him too, and then
bid her follow him. The Amazement of the Queen,
who had never &s;een her before, is not to be expre&s;|&s;ed;
&s;he gave a great Shriek, and fell into a Fit,
looking all the time with an enraged Eye on the
Shepherde&s;s. <HI>Con&s;tantio</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> were both
frighted; the King knew not what to attribute it
to, and the whole Court were in the utmo&s;t 'Con|&s;ternation:
when at la&s;t the Queen came to her&s;elf
again, the King ask'd often what was the Cau&s;e,
but &s;he di&s;&s;embling her Unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;aid it was on|ly
the Vapours: at which the Prince, who knew
better, was very much concerned. She bid the
Shepherde&s;s, with &s;ome &s;eeming &s;ort of Kindne&s;s,
to &s;tay; telling her that &s;he de&s;ign'd her to look af|ter
the Flowers in her Parterre, which Employ the
Prince&s;s was very much plea&s;ed with, to think &s;he
might have an opportunity of &s;eeing <HI>Con&s;tantio</HI> every
day.</P>
<P>Some time after, the King obliged the Queen to
go with him into his Clo&s;et, where he ask'd her
tenderly what vex'd her. &startq;Alas! <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> I dreamt
<PB N="82" REF="83">
that my Son was married to a young Shepherd|de&s;s;
and tho I never &s;aw this young Girl in my
life before, yet I had &s;o &s;trong an Idea of her
Per&s;on in my Dream, that I knew her again as
&s;oon as I fix'd my Eyes on her, and &s;hall be very
much deceiv'd if this &s;orry Country Girl does not
give me great cau&s;e to be afflicted.&endq; &startq;You give too
much way, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> to &s;uch Fancies; I would
advi&s;e you not to act upon &s;uch Principles: &s;end
this Shepherde&s;s back to her Flock, and don't
grieve your&s;elf with &s;uch a ridiculous Conceit.&endq;
This Advice of the King's was no ways acceptable
to the Queen, who, in&s;tead of following it, apply'd
her&s;elf to penetrate into her Son's Sentiments of
<HI>Con&s;tantia.</HI> The Prince took all opportunities that
offer'd, to &s;ee her; and as it was her bu&s;ine&s;s to
look after the Flowers, he fancied that every time
&s;he touch'd them they appear'd more beautiful.
<HI>Ru&s;on</HI> was &s;till her Companion; to him, tho he could
not an&s;wer her, &s;he would be often talking of the
Prince: and whenever he approach'd towards her,
&s;he was &s;o embara&s;s'd, that her Eyes plainly di&s;|cover'd
the Secrets of her Soul; that which, the
overjoy'd Prince would &s;ay all the tender things a
violent Pa&s;&s;ion could in&s;pire. The Queen, on the
Credit of her Dream, and much more on the ac|count
of <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>'s incomparable Beauty, could
not &s;leep in quiet, but ro&s;e before day, and hid
her&s;elf, &s;ometimes behind the Pali&s;adoes, and at
the bottom of a Grotto, to hear her Son's Di&s;cour&s;e
with that fair Maid; but as they were both &s;o
wi&s;e as to talk low, &s;he could gather nothing to
&s;upport her Su&s;picions, which made her the more
unea&s;y. She look'd on the Prince with the utmo&s;t
Di&s;dain, and was in continual Fears night and day,
le&s;t that Shepherde&s;s &s;hould a&s;cend the Throne.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tantio</HI> had as &s;trict a guard upon him&s;elf as
was po&s;&s;ible; but neverthele&s;s every body almo&s;t
perceived his Love of <HI>Con&s;tantia:</HI> for whenever he
prai&s;ed her, through his wonted Cu&s;tom of admiring
<PB N="83" REF="84">
her, or found fault with her, he did both like an
intere&s;ted Per&s;on: and for <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> &s;he al&s;o could
not forbear &s;peaking of the Prince to her Compa|nions;
and as &s;he often &s;ung tho&s;e words &s;he made
for him, the Queen who heard her, was no le&s;s
&s;urprized at her captivating Voice, than at the
Subject of her Poetry. &startq;What have I done, ju&s;t
Heaven, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> to be puni&s;h'd in the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible
manner? Alas! I de&s;ign'd my Son for my
Neice, and to my mortal grief, &s;ee him engaged
to a Wretch, who may, perhaps, make him guilty
of Di&s;obedience.&endq;</P>
<P>While &s;he was afflicting her&s;elf after this manner,
and ruminating upon a thou&s;and furious Projects to
puni&s;h <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> for being &s;o beautiful and charm|ing,
Love made a farther Progre&s;s in the Hearts of
the two young Lovers. <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> convinc'd of the
Sincerity of the Prince, could no longer conceal her
Birth and Sentiments from him. A Confe&s;&s;ion &s;o
tender, and &s;o particular a Confidence, ravi&s;h'd him
&s;o much with Joy, that if they had been in any
other Place be&s;ides the Queen's Garden, he would
have ca&s;t him&s;elf at her Feet to thank her. His Pa&s;|&s;ion
was no longer to be re&s;i&s;ted; he loved <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>
when a Shepherde&s;s, and we may ea&s;ily believe
adored her, when he knew her Rank: And if a
Prince&s;s's wandring through the World, &s;ometimes
as a Shepherde&s;s, and &s;ometimes a Gardener, might
&s;eem extraordinary, at that time tho&s;e things were
very common; and the Prince&s;s's Air and Manner
of Addre&s;s were convincing Proofs of the Sincerity
of her Words.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> moved by Love and E&s;teem, &s;wore an
eternal Fidelity to the Prince&s;s, as &s;he did al&s;o to
him, promi&s;ing to marry as &s;oon as they &s;hould ob|tain
the Con&s;ent of tho&s;e whom Duty requir'd them
to demand it of. The Queen perceiv'd the Strength
of this growing Pa&s;&s;ion, and was more &s;en&s;ible of
it, when one day her Confidant, who de&s;ired no|thing
more than to find &s;omething to gain her Fa|vour
<PB N="84" REF="85">
by, came to tell her, that <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> &s;ent <HI>Ru&s;on</HI>
every Morning into the Prince's Apartment, and
that that Sheep carried two Baskets full of Flow|ers,
and that <HI>Mirtain</HI> led him. The Queen, at this
News, lo&s;t all patience; and as &s;he knew which
way poor <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> was to pa&s;s, waited for him; and,
notwith&s;tanding <HI>Mirtain</HI>'s Prayers and Intreaties,
carried him into her Chamber: where &s;he tore the
Baskets and Flowers in pieces, and found in a large
Lilly a piece of Paper curiou&s;ly wrapt up by <HI>Con|&s;tantia,</HI>
wherein &s;he reproach'd the Prince with the
Dangers he expos'd him&s;elf to in Hunting. The
Lines were thus:</P>
<LG>
<L>In the mid&s;t of all my Joy,</L>
<L>Chilling Fears croud in apace.</L>
<L>Anxious Cares my Brea&s;t invade,</L>
<L>While you pur&s;ue the Cha&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell me, ye Powers, wherein con&s;i&s;t</L>
<L>The&s;e Charms, that thus ingage;</L>
<L>Charms that can my Prince invite,</L>
<L>And tempt his Godlike Rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Turn! Oh! turn your cconquering Arms,</L>
<L>Again&s;t more yielding Hearts;</L>
<L>Wolves and Bears fly from your Spears,</L>
<L>The Fair embrace your Darts.</L>
</LG>
<P>While the Queen was venting her Rage again&s;t
the Shepherde&s;s, <HI>Mirtain</HI> went to give his Ma&s;ter an
account of what had happen'd. The Prince, unea&s;y
thereat, ran into his Mother's Chamber; who at
that time was gone to the King's, to tell him. &startq;Be|hold,
Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> the noble Inclinations of your
Son! he is in love with the Shepherde&s;s that pre|tended
to $ure him. Alas! <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> &s;he knew
how too well, 'twas Love in&s;tructed her: &s;he has
re&s;tored him his Health, to make him more mi&s;e|rable;
and if we don't prevent the Misfortune
<PB N="85" REF="86">
with which we are threatned, my Dream will
prove but too true.&endq; &startq;You are naturally too
&s;evere, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> and would have your Son
think of no other Per&s;on but the Prince&s;s you de|&s;ign
to marry him to; you mu&s;t indulge his Years.&endq;
&startq;I cannot bear, <HI>cry'd the Queen,</HI> your taking his
part, you can never find fault with him; all that
I ask of you, is, to con&s;ent that I &s;end him away
from Court for &s;ome time; Ab&s;ence may have
more effect than all my Arguments.&endq; The King,
who was a Man that loved a quiet Life, agreed to
what his Queen de&s;ired; and &s;he return'd back to
her own Apartment, where &s;he found the Prince
waiting for her with the utmo&s;t Impatience.
&startq;Child, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him, before he could &s;peak to her,</HI> the
King has been &s;hewing me a Letter from the King
my Brother, wherein, he begs of him to &s;end
you to his Court, that you may contract a Friend|&s;hip
with the Prince&s;s, his Daughter, whom we
have a de&s;ign you &s;hall marry; it being proper
you &s;hould judge of each other's Merit, and en|gage
your Affections.&endq; &startq;Madam, <HI>reply'd the Prince,</HI>
I a&s;k nothing &s;o particular in my favour; neither
is it cu&s;tomary for Princes to go on &s;uch Occa|&s;ions,
and to con&s;ult their Hearts before Rea&s;ons
of State: My Obedience &s;hall be the &s;ame, whe|ther
the Per&s;on be beautiful or deformed,
witty or otherwi&s;e.&endq; &startq;I under&s;tand you, Repro|bate,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he in a Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> you love a ba&s;e Shep|herde&s;s,
and are afraid of leaving her; but you
&s;hall, or &s;ee her die before your face: but if you
are ready to go, and will endeavour to forget her, I'll
keep her here, and love her as much as now I hate.&endq;
The Prince, who turn'd as pale as Death, rea&s;on'd
with him&s;elf what to do in this Urgency, he knew
his Mother to be a mo&s;t cruel and revengful Prin|ce&s;s,
and fear'd le&s;t his Oppo&s;ition might exa&s;pe|rate
her &s;o much, that his dear Mi&s;tre&s;s would feel the
Effects of her Re&s;entment: In &s;hort, being clo&s;e|ly
pre&s;s'd, he con&s;ented at la&s;t, like one who con|&s;ents
<PB N="86" REF="87">
to drink a Gla&s;s of Poi&s;on; and no &s;ooner
had given his Word, but he left his Mother, and
return'd to his own Apartment, with a Heart &s;o
oppre&s;s'd, that he thought he &s;hould die. He told
the faithful <HI>Mirtain</HI> his Affliction, and impatient to
let his <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> know the Cau&s;e of it, went to the
Grott, where &s;he u&s;ed generally to retire from the
Heats of the Sun, to comb her delicate Locks, and
adju&s;t her&s;elf. There he found her &s;at on the
Gra&s;s by a Brook-&s;ide, which fell from the height
of a Rock, with her Feet in the Water; the a|greeable
Murmurs of which, together with the
Fatigue of her Work, having invited her in&s;en|&s;ibly
to ta&s;te the Sweets of a gentle Sleep. Her
Eyes, though clo&s;ed, pre&s;erved a thou&s;and Beau|ties;
her long black Eye-la&s;hes &s;et off the White|ne&s;s
of her Skin; the Loves and Graces &s;eem'd to
&s;urround her, and Mode&s;ty and Sweetne&s;s to augment
her Charms. The amorous Prince remembred,
that the fir&s;t time he beheld her, he &s;aw her thus
a&s;leep; but &s;ince then, his Sentiments of her were
become &s;o tender, that he would willingly have
&s;urrendred up half his Life, to enjoy the other half
with her: He gazed upon her &s;ome time, with a
Plea&s;ure that &s;u&s;pended his Grief; then running
over all her Beauties, di&s;covered her Foot as white
as Snow, which he could not forbear admiring,
and approaching nigher, fell on his Knees, and
took her by the hand: upon which &s;he waked,
&s;eeming vex'd that he &s;hould &s;ee her bare Foot, and
hid it with a Blu&s;h upon her Cheecks, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing
the Ro&s;e opening to the Morning Sun. But alas!
of what continuance was it? She ob&s;erv'd a deep
Melancholy in the Prince's Face, and &s;aid to him
frighted; &startq;What is the matter with you, Sir, I
know by your Eyes you are troubled.&endq; &startq;Ah!
Who can be otherwi&s;e, my dear Prince&s;s? <HI>&s;aid he,
&s;hedding &s;ome Tears:</HI> we mu&s;t part, I mu&s;t go and
leave you expo&s;ed to my Mother's Rage; &s;he
<PB N="87" REF="88">
knows the Love I bear you; the Billet you &s;ent
me fell into her hands, and &s;he, in&s;en&s;ible to my
Grief, is &s;ending me to the King her Brother.&endq;
&startq;What's this you tell me, Prince! <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> you
are going to leave me, as the Means nece&s;&s;ary to
pre&s;erve my Life! How could you imagine &s;uch
Means? Let me die rather before your Eyes,
than live without you.&endq;</P>
<P>So tender a Di&s;cour&s;e could not fail of being ac|companied
and interrupted by Sighs and Tears:
The two young Lovers never knew nor fore&s;aw
the Cruelties of Ab&s;ence before; they &s;wore a
thou&s;and times never to change, and the Prince
promi&s;ed a quick Return, a&s;&s;uring her, that he
would affront both his Uncle and his Daughter, &s;o
as to make them lay a&s;ide all thoughts of an Al|liance:
&startq;I will &s;trive, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to di&s;plea&s;e the
Prince&s;s, and am &s;ure I &s;hall &s;ucceed.&endq; &startq;Then
you mu&s;t not &s;hew your&s;elf, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Con&s;tantia, for
if you do, you will plea&s;e in &s;pight of your&s;elf,&endq;
Then they cry'd again bitterly, looking at each o|ther
with a piercing Grief, and making &s;uch re|ciprocal
Promi&s;es, that if they had any Comfort, it
was in the A&s;&s;urance of their Love and Fidelity.
In this melting Conver&s;ation the time ran away &s;o
fa&s;t, that it was dark night before they thought of
parting. When the Queen, having a mind to &s;et|tle
the Prince's Equipage with him, &s;ent to <HI>Mirtain,</HI>
to acquaint his Ma&s;ter with it, whom he found at
his Mi&s;tre&s;s's feet, holding one of her Hands be|tween
his. As &s;oon as they &s;aw him, they
were both &s;o &s;truck, that they could not &s;peak:
However, he delivered the Queen's Me&s;&s;age to the
Prince, who dur&s;t not di&s;obey her Commands, but
took his leave of his Prince&s;s. The Queen, when
&s;he &s;aw him, found him &s;o melancholy, and &s;o
much altered, that, gue&s;&s;ing at the Cau&s;e of it, &s;he
would not &s;peak. Neverthele&s;s, every thing was
prepared with the &s;ame diligence, while he was
altogether taken up with his Pa&s;&s;ion. He made
<PB N="88" REF="89">
<HI>Mirtain</HI> &s;tay at Court, to &s;end him news of the
Prince&s;s, with whom he left a great many rich
Jewels, to &s;erve in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. The De&s;pair
of our Lovers is not to be expre&s;&s;ed, when the
Prince went: And if any thing mitigated it, it was
the Hopes of &s;eeing each other &s;oon again. 'Twas
then <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the Greatne&s;s of
her Misfortune, of being the Daughter of a rich
and powerful King, and in the hands of a cruel
Queen, who had &s;ent away her Son, for fear of her,
who was no ways his inferiour.</P>
<P>The Queen now overjoy'd that her Son was
gone, applied her&s;elf to the intercepting all his
Letters, &s;ucceeded therein, and knew <HI>Mirtain</HI> to
be his Confidant, whom, thereupon, &s;he ordered
under a fal&s;e Pretext to be arre&s;ted and &s;ent to a
di&s;mal Pri&s;on. The Prince, when he heard of it,
was very much inraged, and writ Letters to the
King and Queen to demand his Favourite's Liber|ty;
but all his In&s;tances had no effect. But this
was not all; for one Morning, when the Prince&s;s
ro&s;e to gather &s;ome Flowers, according to cu&s;tom,
for the Queen's Toilet, &s;he &s;aw the faithful <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI>
who went before her, come trembling to her, and
advancing forwards to &s;ee what was the Cau&s;e,
heard a hi&s;&s;ing of Snakes, and was &s;urrounded by
Toads, Vipers, Scorpions, A&s;picks, and Adders,
which made many vain Leaps at her, and always
fell down again upon the &s;ame Spot of Ground:
Notwith&s;tanding the fright &s;he was in, &s;he could
not but take notice of this Prodigy, and could at|tribute
it to nothing but a Ring given by her Lover.
Which way &s;oever &s;he turn'd, tho&s;e venomous
Animals fled before her; the Alleys, and all the
Flower-beds were full of them: in&s;omuch, that
the beautiful <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> knew not what would be|come
of her; and &s;aw the Queen at her Window
laughing, and from thence judged, it was in vain
to flatter her&s;elf with any Expectation of A&s;&s;i&s;tance
from her Orders. &startq;I know I mu&s;t die, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="89" REF="90">
courageou&s;ly,</HI> the&s;e Mon&s;ters came not here of them|&s;elves,
but have been brought by the Queen's
Command, who is come her&s;elf to be a Specta|tor
of the deplorable end of my Life, which has
hitherto been &s;o unhappy, that I have no rea&s;on to
be fond of it; but if I do in &s;ome mea&s;ure regret
the lo&s;s of it, the ju&s;t Gods can witne&s;s on what
account it is.&endq; After this &s;he advanced boldly for|wards;
the Snakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made off from her as fa&s;t
as &s;he made towards them; and &s;o &s;he got out of
the Garden, at which &s;he was as much amazed as
the Queen, who had been a long time providing
the&s;e dangerous Creatures to de&s;troy her, thinking
that her Son would believe her death accidental, and
&s;he by this means &s;hould skreen her&s;elf from his
Reproaches: but this Project failing, &s;he had re|cour&s;e
to this other.</P>
<P>There lived at the farther &s;ide of a large Fore&s;t
a Fairy, who&s;e Abode was render'd inacce&s;&s;ible by
Elephants that devoured all Travellers; with this
Fairy the Queen had agreed, that if any Per&s;on
&s;hould come from her unhurt, to &s;end them back
again with &s;ome that would be &s;ure to kill them.
Her other Plot mi&s;carrying, &s;he &s;ent for <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI>
and order'd her to go thither with a Me&s;&s;age &s;he
gave her. The Prince&s;s, who knew the Queen
would be ab&s;olutely obey'd, prepar'd to &s;et out for
the dangerous Journey &s;he was to undertake; and
reflecting on the Dangers &s;he had heard her Com|panions
tell of, &s;he remembred that an old Shep|herde&s;s
had &s;aid, that tho&s;e Elephants were very
gentle when they &s;aw either a Sheep or a Lamb;
and that when the Fairy &s;ent the burning Girdle to
the Queen, for fear le&s;t the Queen &s;hould make
her put it on, &s;he had fa&s;ten'd it upon &s;everal Trees
which it fired, till it had lo&s;t all its force; but
little thought, when &s;he heard this Story, that it
might one day be &s;erviceable to her. In &s;hort, &s;he
took <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI> and &s;et forwards on her Journey; and
the Queen, who was mighty well plea&s;ed thereat,
<PB N="90" REF="91">
could not forbear telling the King, that they &s;hould
never &s;ee the hated Object of their Son's Affections
any more, &s;ince &s;he had &s;ent her to the Fore&s;t,
whence &s;he could never return: upon which the
King told her &s;he was too revengeful, and that he
could not but have &s;ome Regret for the death of
&s;o beautiful a Creature.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> arrived at the Fore&s;t,
and was pre&s;ently &s;urrounded by the Elephants; but
tho&s;e dreadful Creatures no &s;ooner &s;aw <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI> but
they care&s;s'd him with their Trunks as gently as
the fine&s;t Lady could with her fair Hand: and then
the Prince&s;s, fearing le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eparate their In|tere&s;ts,
took <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> in her Arms, and which way &s;o|ever
&s;he turn'd, always pre&s;ented him; and by that
means reach'd the Fairy's Abode, the Rudene&s;s and
De&s;olation of which frighten'd her, as much as the
old Woman her&s;elf, who in all re&s;pects an&s;wer'd
her dwelling-place. &startq;What is it you want, fair
Maid? <HI>&s;aid &s;he.</HI>&endq; To which the Prince&s;s reply'd,
That the Queen pre&s;ented her Duty and Service
to her, and de&s;ired her to &s;end the Girdle of
<HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI>&endq; &startq;She &s;hall not be denied, <HI>&s;aid the old
Fairy,</HI> I know it is for you.&endq; And then putting her
Hand into a long Pocket &s;he wore by her Side,
pull'd out a Girdle of blue Velvet, and gave it her,
&s;aying, &startq;This Girdle will make you mo&s;t exqui|&s;itely
beautiful, provided you wear it as &s;oon as
you are in the Fore&s;t.&endq; <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> made a Courte&s;y,
and thank'd her; and then took up <HI>Ru&s;on,</HI> who
was as u&s;eful as before: however, &s;he did not for|get
to put the Girdle of <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> about a Tree,
which immediately was all in flames; and after
that, &s;he girt it about &s;everal, till all its virtue was
&s;pent; and at la&s;t came back to Court very much
tired. The Queen was &s;o &s;urprized when &s;he &s;aw
her, that &s;he could not &s;peak for a long time; and
when &s;he recovered her&s;elf, told her &s;he was a
fal&s;e &s;aucy Baggage, for that &s;he had not been with
the Fairy. <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> affirmed &s;he had, and that &s;he
<PB N="91" REF="92">
had brought the Girdle of <HI>Friend&s;hip:</HI> upon which
the Queen ask'd her if &s;he had put it on; and the
other reply'd, it was too rich for a poor Shep|herde&s;s
to wear. &startq;No, no, <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> I give
it you for your pains, be&s;ure to gird it about
your Wai&s;t; but tell me what you met with in
your Travels.&endq; Hereupon <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> told her how
&s;he had met with Elephants &s;o &s;en&s;ible and tame,
that &s;he could not but admire them; that the Fo|re&s;t
&s;eem'd like their Kingdom, wherein &s;ome paid
great Re&s;pect to others: and the Queen, tho vex'd
at this relation, yet di&s;gui&s;ed her Rage, hoping the
Girdle would compleat her De&s;ires.</P>
<P><HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> retired to her Chamber, where &s;he be|wailed
the ab&s;ence of her dear Prince, to whom
&s;he dur&s;t not write, becau&s;e the Queen had Spies
abroad that intercepted all Letters and Me&s;&s;engers.
&startq;Alas! <HI>Con&s;tantio, &s;aid &s;he,</HI> you will &s;hortly hear
di&s;mal News of me; you &s;hould not have gone,
and left me expo&s;ed to your Mother's Violences:
you would have defended me, or receiv'd my la&s;t
Sighs; whereas I am now in the power of her
Tyranny, and have none to comfort me.&endq; The
next Morning &s;he went with the Girdle about her
Wai&s;t, to work in the Garden as u&s;ual; where &s;he
found the &s;ame venomous Creatures again, which
her Ring &s;ecured her from. And when the Queen
perceiv'd her gathering Flowers, and well; &s;he
bur&s;t out into an extravagancy of Pa&s;&s;ion. &startq;What
Power, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> interpo&s;es in this Shepherde&s;s's
behalf? By her Beauty &s;he has bewitch'd my
Son, and by her Simples re&s;tored him his Health,
and can walk unhurt in the mid&s;t of Adders and
A&s;picks. The Elephants were tame and gentle
at the &s;ight of her; and the Girdle that &s;hould
burn and con&s;ume her, &s;erves only to adorn her:
therefore I mu&s;t u&s;e &s;ome other means.&endq; There|upon
&s;he &s;ent the Captain of her Guards, in whom
&s;he could confide, to the Port, to &s;ee if there
were any Ve&s;&s;els ready to &s;ail for a long Voyage;
<PB N="92" REF="93">
and he return'd, and told her there was one which
was de&s;ign'd to &s;ail the beginning of the Night.
This News was very agreeable to the Queen, who
immediately &s;ent for the Ma&s;ter to come and buy a
beautiful Slave; who when he came to the Palace,
and &s;aw <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> (who knew nothing of what was
in agitation) in the Garden, was &s;o &s;urprized with
the Charms of this incomparable Maid, that the
Queen, who was very covetous, took the advan|tage
of it, and &s;old her at a con&s;iderable Price. It
happen'd that Night that <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> retired very ear|ly
to her Chamber, to amu&s;e and indulge her
Thoughts on <HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> and to an&s;wer a Letter of
his which &s;he had by &s;ome Stratagem receiv'd; the
which &s;he was reading when the Queen enter'd
her Room, follow'd by the Captain of her Guards,
and two Mutes, who &s;topt her Mouth with a Hand|kerchief,
and carried her away. <HI>Ru&s;on</HI> would have
follow'd his dear Mi&s;tre&s;s, but the Queen catch'd
hold of him, and prevented him; fearing le&s;t his
Bleatings might di&s;cover what &s;he had a mind &s;hould
be done privately. And thus <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> having none
to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, was tran&s;ported aboard the Ve&s;&s;el,
which hoi&s;ted Sail immediately after.</P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t leave her to the mercy of the Sea,
her new Ma&s;ter, and to cruel Fortune; for the
Sovereign Fairy could not prevail with Fate in her
favour: and all &s;he could do, was to follow her un|&s;een
in a dark Cloud. In the mean time the Prince
<HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> wholly taken up with his Pa&s;&s;ion, paid no
regard to the Prince&s;s that was de&s;ign'd him; and
tho he was naturally the mo&s;t polite Prince in the
World, was guilty of &s;everal rude and unmannerly
Actions, which &s;he often complain'd of to her Fa|ther,
who reprov'd his Nephew for it, and &s;o the
March went rather off than came on. At this very
nick of time the Queen thought fit to write to the
Prince, to let him know that <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> was at the
point of death; which News created &s;o much Grief
in the Prince, that without ob&s;erving any Ceremo|nies
<PB N="93" REF="94">
of taking his leave, he &s;et out with all &s;peed
to come and &s;ee her; but notwith&s;tanding all his
ha&s;te, came too late: for the Queen fore&s;eeing that
he would return as &s;oon as he receiv'd her Letter,
had for &s;everal Days before cau&s;ed a Report to be
given out that <HI>Con&s;tan$$a</HI> was very ill, and &s;ome time
after another that &s;he was dead; and to confirm it,
buried a Figure of Wax: and to convince the Prince
the more of the Truth of it, relea&s;ed <HI>Mirtain</HI> out
of Pri&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Funeral of this charming
Maid, who was regretted by all the Court, and for
the lo&s;s of whom, the Queen, on her Son's account,
&s;eem'd to be under &s;ome concern.</P>
<P>The Prince arrived &s;oon after in all the Fears
and Unea&s;ine&s;s imaginable; and when he enter'd
fir&s;t the City, impatient to know how his dear
<HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> did, happening to ask &s;ome People who
knew him not, and being told &s;he was dead, he
fell off from his Hor&s;e &s;en&s;ele&s;s and &s;peechle&s;s, and
being known by the Crowd which gather'd about
him to be the Prince, he was carried for dead to
the Palace. The King was &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with
the mi&s;erable condition of his Son; but the Queen,
who was prepared before-hand, believed that Time
and the Lo&s;s of his mo&s;t tender Hopes might cure
him: but he was too deeply affected to admit of
any Comfort. His Grief, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing,
increa&s;ed every moment, and he kept his Room &s;e|veral
days, without &s;eeing or hardly &s;peaking to
any one; when one day oppre&s;s'd with his Sorrow,
he went into the Queen's Apartment with Tears
in his Eyes, his Face as meagre and pale as Death,
and told her &s;he had been the cau&s;e of his beloved
<HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>'s death, and that &s;he would &s;hortly be
puni&s;hed for the &s;ame, &s;ince he was re&s;olved to
die al&s;o, and would go to the Place where &s;he was
buried. The Queen unable to di&s;&s;uade him from it,
re&s;olved to go with him her&s;elf to a Wood planted
with Cypre&s;s, where &s;he had rai&s;ed a Tomb over
her. When the Prince came there, he &s;aid all the
<PB N="94" REF="95">
tender and compa&s;&s;ionate things any Man could
invent, which made the Queen, notwith&s;tanding
her natural Hardne&s;s of Heart, melt into Tears.
<HI>Mirtain</HI> took on as much as his Ma&s;ter, and all that
heard him &s;hared in his Affliction. At la&s;t, all on a
&s;udden, inraged with the di&s;appointment of his Pa&s;|&s;ion,
he drew his Sword, and approaching the
marble Monument, had kill'd him&s;elf, if the Queen
and <HI>Mirtain</HI> had not held his Arm. &startq;No, <HI>cry'd he,</HI>
nothing &s;hall prevent my dying and being with
my dear Prince&s;s.&endq; The Name of Prince&s;s &s;urpri|zed
the Queen, and had made her fancy he raved,
had he not &s;poke rationally in other things. She
asked him why he called <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> a Prince&s;s; to
which he an&s;wer'd, becau&s;e &s;he was one, and So|vereign
of the Kingdom of <HI>De&s;erts.</HI> &startq;Well Child,
<HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> is of birth &s;uitable
to yours, comfort your&s;elf, &s;he is not dead; for
now I mu&s;t own to you, to mitigate your Grief,
I have &s;old her to a Merchant for a Slave.&endq; &startq;Ah!
<HI>cry'd the Prince,</HI> what you tell me is only to &s;u&s;|pend
my de&s;ign of dying; but my Re&s;olution is
fix'd, nothing &s;hall hinder it.&endq; Then &s;aid the
Queen, &startq;Your own Eyes mu&s;t convince you of
the truth of my Words.&endq; And thereupon &s;he or|der'd
the Figure of Wax to be dug up. The Prince,
as &s;oon as he &s;aw it, believed it to be the Body of
his lovely Prince&s;s, and fainted away; they endea|vour'd
to bring him to him&s;elf again, but all in
vain: The Queen a&s;&s;ured him &s;he was not dead;
but after the Trick &s;he had play'd her, he could
not believe her, till <HI>Mirtain,</HI> whom he knew lov'd
him, and who was not capable of telling him a
Lye, confirm'd it.</P>
<P>From that moment the Prince found &s;ome Ea&s;e,
becau&s;e of all Misfortunes Death is the mo&s;t terri|ble;
and he might yet flatter him&s;elf with the
hopes of &s;eeing her again: but then he knew not
where to &s;eek her, nor who the Merchant was,
who never made the lea&s;t mention whither he was
<PB N="95" REF="96">
bound. All the&s;e were great Difficulties, but what
are tho&s;e, true Love will not &s;urmount? The
Prince cho&s;e peri&s;hing, in pur&s;uing the Ravi&s;hers,
a thou&s;and times, before living without her, and
reproach'd the Queen as often for her Cruelty;
telling her &s;he might repent of what &s;he had done,
&s;ince he was re&s;olved to go, and never come back
again. The afflicted Mother ca&s;t her Arms about
her Son's Neck, wet his Face with her Tears, and
conjur'd him, by the Regard he had to his Father's
and Mother's Years, and the Love and Friend&s;hip
he bore them, not to leave them; telling him, that
if he deprived them of the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing
him, it would be the cau&s;e of their Deaths; that
he was their only Hope, and that when he was
gone, their Neighbours and Enemies would &s;eize
upon the Kingdom. All which the Prince li&s;ten'd
to with a Coldne&s;s and Re&s;pect, having the ill U|&s;age
&s;he had given <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> always in his Thoughts,
and without her he de&s;pi&s;ed all the Crowns in the
World; in&s;omuch that he per&s;i&s;ted, with a &s;urpri|zing
Firmne&s;s, in the Re&s;olution of going the next
day. The King endeavour'd to per&s;uade him to
&s;tay, but all in vain, for nothing could prevail with
him; the night he &s;pent in leaving Orders with
<HI>Mirtain,</HI> giving him the Charge of the faithful <HI>Ru|&s;on,</HI>
and a great many rich Jewels, telling him, that
he &s;hould hear from him, provided he was &s;ecret,
being willing to create the Queen as much Unea|&s;ine&s;s
as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Before day, the impatient <HI>Con&s;tantio</HI> took hor&s;e,
yielding him&s;elf up entirely to Fortune, de&s;iring her
only to be &s;o favourable as to direct him where he
might find his dear Mi&s;tre&s;s again. Whither to go, he
knew not; but as &s;he was carried on board a Ve&s;|&s;el,
he thought it would be the be&s;t way to find
her, to embark on board one too: to this end he
made towards the mo&s;t noted Port, and being there
unaccompanied and unknown, inform'd him&s;elf of
the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts, and of all the Coa&s;ts, Ports,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
and Havens they could put in at, and then went
on board a Ve&s;&s;el, in hopes that a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o vio|lent
and pure as his would not always be un&s;uc|ce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Whenever they came nigh any Land, he always
put out a Sloop, and row'd along by the Shore,
calling upon <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> venting his Sighs and Com|plaints
to the pityle&s;s Winds to convey them to the
Shore; and then return'd back to the Ship over|whelm'd
with Grief, and his Eyes bathed in Tears.
One night, that they came to an Anchor behind a
large Rock, he went on the &s;hore as u&s;ual; but as
they knew not the Country, and the Night was
very dark, tho&s;e that were along with him would
not venture any farther for fear of Danger. The
Prince, who valued not his Life to find out the
Object of his Wi&s;hes, kept going forwards, often
falling and getting up again, till at la&s;t he di&s;co|ver'd
a great Light, that &s;eem'd to come from &s;ome
large Fire; and approaching nigher towards it,
heard a great noi&s;e of Hammers, that gave terri|ble
Strokes: far from being afraid, he made all
po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te forwards, till he came to a great
open Forge, in the Furnace of which was &s;o great
a Fire, that it look'd as bright as the Sun; here
thirty <HI>Cy$l$ps</HI> were at work, making Arms. <HI>Con&s;tan|tio</HI>
went up to them, and &s;aid, &startq;If you are capable
of entertaining any Pity in the mid&s;t of Fire and
Steel, tell me if you have &s;een the beautiful <HI>Con|&s;tantia</HI>
land here, and I will give you whatever
you &s;hall demand.&endq; He had no &s;ooner &s;aid thus,
but the Noi&s;e, that cea&s;ed at his fir&s;t Arrival, was
renew'd with much more Violence: &startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
the <HI>barbarous Wretches</HI> are no ways touch'd with
my Grief; what can I expect from them?&endq; And
ju&s;t as he was about to leave them, he heard a
&s;oft Symphony that ravi&s;hed his Sen&s;es; and look|ing
towards the Furnace, &s;aw the mo&s;t beautiful
Child Fancy could ever repre&s;ent, brighter than
the Fire he came out of. When he con&s;ider'd his
<PB N="97" REF="98">
Charms, the Bandage over his Eyes, his Bow and
Quiver by his Side, he no longer doubted but that
it was <HI>Cupid;</HI> who cry'd out to him, &startq;Stay, <HI>Con|&s;tantio,</HI>
you burn with too pure a Flame for me
to refu&s;e my A&s;&s;i&s;tance: I am called <HI>V$rtuous-Love;</HI>
'twas I that wounded you with <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> and de|fended
her again&s;t the Giant that per&s;ecuted her.
The <HI>Sovereign Fairy</HI> is my intimate Friend, we
have engaged to protect her; but I mu&s;t make a
tryal of your Pa&s;&s;ion, before I di&s;cover where &s;he
is.&endq; &startq;Command, <HI>Love,</HI> command what you think
fit, <HI>cry'd the Prince,</HI> I will not di&s;obey thee.&endq; &startq;Then
throw your&s;elf into this Fire, <HI>reply'd the Child;</HI> but
remember, if you love not faithfully, you are
lo&s;t.&endq; &startq;I have no rea&s;on to fear that,&endq; <HI>&s;aid</HI> Con|&s;tantio;
and immediately threw him&s;elf into the
Furnace, where he lo&s;t all Sen&s;e pre&s;ently: He
&s;lept thirty Hours, and when he awaked, found
him&s;elf changed into a mo&s;t beautiful Pidgeon, and
in&s;tead of being in the terrible Furnace, on a Ne&s;t
of Ro&s;es, Je&s;&s;amines, and Honey-&s;uckles. Never
was any Surprize greater than his, to &s;ee his rough
Feet, his Skin &s;tuck full of Feathers of various Co|lours,
and his Eyes, as he beheld them in a Brook,
as red as Fire; he attempted &s;everal times to utter
his Complaints, but found he had lo&s;t the U&s;e of
his Speech, tho he had recover'd his Sen&s;es. He
look'd upon this Metamorpho&s;is as the compleate&s;t
of all Misfortunes: &startq;Ah! perfidious <HI>Love, thought
he to him&s;elf,</HI> is this the Recompence thou give&s;t
the mo&s;t perfect of all Lovers? The Fal&s;e, the
Fickle, and For&s;worn, are favour'd by thee, while
thou tormente&s;t the True and Faithful. What can
I promi&s;e my&s;elf from &s;o extraordinary a Figure
as mine, a poor Pidgeon? Could I &s;peak, I would
fly high and low, and &s;earch after my Mi&s;tre&s;s
thro all different Climates, and inform my&s;elf of
every one I met; but I am debarred the Liberty
of pronouncing her Name, and the only Remedy
<PB N="98" REF="99">
left me, is to throw my&s;elf off &s;ome Precipice,
and willingly embrace my Death.&endq;</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with this fatal Re&s;olution, he flew to
the top of a high Mountain, and from thence ca&s;t
him&s;elf down, but forgot, having not been long a
Pidgeon, that his Wings and Feathers would keep
him up: thereupon he re&s;olved to unplume him&s;elf,
and accordingly put this De&s;ign in execution. As
&s;oon as he had quite &s;tript him&s;elf, he walked up
to the top of a high Rock, to attempt his De&s;truc|tion
once more, where he was &s;urprized by two
young Dam&s;els, that came &s;uddenly upon him;
who, as &s;oon as they &s;aw him, &s;aid one to another,
&startq;Where has this poor Pidgeon been? He has e&s;ca|ped
the Claws of &s;ome Bird of Prey, or &s;ome
Wea&s;el.&endq; &startq;It is no matter where he has been,
<HI>&s;aid the younger,</HI> but I know where he &s;hall go;
he &s;hall go and bear five others, I have at home,
company, with which I intend to make a Pye for
the <HI>Sovereign Fairy.</HI>&endq; The Prince Pidgeon hearing
her &s;peak thus, in&s;tead of going from her, made
towards her, in hopes of being &s;peedily kill'd by
her: but that proved his Safety, for the young Maids
found him &s;o tame and familiar, that they re&s;olved to
bring him up, and keep him alive; to which end
the elder put him in her Work-Basket &s;he had in
her hand, and &s;o they pur&s;ued their Walk.</P>
<P>Some days after, one of the&s;e Dam&s;els &s;aid to
the other, &startq;Methinks our Mi&s;tre&s;s has a great deal
of bu&s;ine&s;s upon her hands, &s;ince &s;he is never
from off her fiery Camel, but goes night and day
from one Pole to the other.&endq; &startq;If you can be di&s;|creet,
<HI>reply'd the other,</HI> I'll tell you a Secret &s;he
has entru&s;ted me with; the Prince&s;s <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> of
whom &s;he is &s;o very fond, is per&s;ecuted by a Gi|ant
that would marry her, and has put her in a
Tower: and &s;he is doing &s;ome &s;urprizing things
to prevent this Marriage.&endq; The Prince li&s;ten'd to
this Conver&s;ation, and thought till then nothing
could add to his Troubles; but found, to his grief,
<PB N="99" REF="100">
he was much deceived; for we may judge by his
Pa&s;&s;ion, and by the unhappy Circum&s;tances he lay
under, of being a Pidgeon, at a time when the
Prince&s;s &s;tood in mo&s;t need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that
his Angui&s;h of Soul was great; his Imagination al|ways
ready to torment him, repre&s;ented to him,
that <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> was &s;ecured in a di&s;mal Tower, and
there expo&s;ed to the Importunities and Violences
of a barbarous Giant: And was always in appre|hen&s;ion,
le&s;t &s;he, thro Fears, might con&s;ent to mar|ry
him; and then again, le&s;t by refu&s;ing &s;he &s;hould
hazard her Life, thro the Rage of an un&s;ucce&s;sful
Lover. One day the young Maid, that carried him
in her Basket, having been abroad, and returning
back with her Companion to their Mi&s;tre&s;s the
Fairy's Palace, found her walking in a &s;hady Walk
of the Garden, went and ca&s;t her&s;elf at her feet,
and told her, that &s;he had found a Pidgeon that
was &s;o tame and familiar, that her Companion and
&s;he de&s;ign'd to keep it in their Chamber; that if
&s;he liked it, 'twas at her &s;ervice, it being very
diverting. The Fairy took the Basket, open'd it,
and &s;eeing the Pidgeon at the bottom, and knowing
who it was, (for that Metamorpho&s;is was owing to
her) fell into a &s;erious and deep Reflection, mora|lizing
on the Vici&s;&s;itudes and Changes of this Life,
and above all on tho&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tantio</HI>'s. She care&s;s'd
the Pidgeon, and he, for his part, neglected no
little Artifice to gain her Attention, that &s;he might
give him &s;ome Comfort in this melancholy Adven|ture.
The Fairy carried him into her Clo&s;et, and
there &s;aid to him, &startq;Prince, the mi&s;erable Condi|tion
you are at this pre&s;ent in, makes me, that I
cannot forbear owning and loving you for my be|loved
<HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>'s &s;ake, who, I can a&s;&s;ure you, is
no le&s;s indifferent than your&s;elf; blame nobody
but me for this Metamorpho&s;is, I did it to try
your Pa&s;&s;ion, which is both pure and la&s;ting,
and will tend to your own Honour.&endq; The Pid|egon
bow'd his Head three times in acknowledg|ment,
<PB N="100" REF="101">
and li&s;ten'd attentively to what the Fairy told
him.</P>
<P>&startq;The Queen, your Mother, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> had no
&s;ooner receiv'd the Money for the Prince&s;s, but
&s;he &s;ent her aboard with all imaginable Vio|lence;
and the Ship &s;et &s;ail for the <HI>Indies,</HI> where
they were &s;ure to make a con&s;iderable Advantage
of the precious Jewel they carried with them.
Her Tears and Intreaties worked not the lea&s;t ef|fect
upon them; &s;he &s;aid, but all to no purpo&s;e,
that the Prince <HI>Cor&s;tantio</HI> would purcha&s;e her of
them again, if all he had in the World would do
it: The more &s;he urg'd all the&s;e Arguments, the
more ha&s;te they made to get off, for fear le&s;t the
Prince, hearing of what was done, might come
and &s;natch away their Prey from them. In &s;hort,
after having been &s;ome Months at Sea, a great
Storm aro&s;e; and the Prince&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ed with
Grief, and fatigued with the Sea, was at the point
of Death; when they, to pre&s;erve her, put into
the fir&s;t Port they could make: But as they
were di&s;embarking, a great Giant, follow'd by &s;e|veral
others, came down upon them, and would
&s;ee what they had in their Ve&s;&s;el; where the fir&s;t
Object he fixed his Eyes on, was the young Prin|ce&s;s;
and knowing her again, as well as &s;he knew
him, cry'd out, Ah! little Runaway, the ju&s;t and
merciful Gods have put thee in my power again:
Do not you remember how I found you, and you
cut my Sack? but I &s;hall be very much mi&s;taken,
if you &s;erve me &s;o any more. And without any
more words, took her away in his Arms from the
whole Ship's Crew, and carried her to his great
Tower, which is &s;ituated upon a high Moun|tain,
and built by Enchanters, who neglected no|thing
to make it fine and curious. Doors there
are none, and no entring into it, but by the Win|dows,
which are very high; the Walls are built
with Diamonds, which make it look as bright, as
the Sun at noon-day: In &s;hort, it is as noble as Art
<PB N="101" REF="102">
and Nature can make it. When the Giant had
the charming <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he told
her he would marry her, and make her the
happie&s;t Woman in the World, that &s;he &s;hould
be Mi&s;tre&s;s of all his Trea&s;ures, that he would
love her, and doubted not but that &s;he was o|verjoy'd
that her Good-fortune brought her to
him. She, by her Tears and Complaints, has
let him know the Exce&s;s of her De&s;pair; but, as
I manage privately again&s;t Fate, which hath &s;wore
the Ruin of <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> I have in&s;pired the Giant
with &s;uch Sentiments of Mildne&s;s as he never was
Ma&s;ter of before: In&s;omuch, that in&s;tead of being
enraged again&s;t the Prince&s;s, he has told her he
will give her a Year's time to con&s;ider on it; and
if &s;he does not then come to a Re&s;olution, he'll
marry her again&s;t her Will, and then kill her.
After this di&s;mal Declaration, he brought &s;everal
young Dam&s;els to bear her company, and divert
her, and &s;et a Guard of Giants round the Tow|er,
to hinder any Per&s;on from coming to her.
In &s;hort, the poor Prince&s;s &s;eeing no likelihood of
any Succours, and the Year being expired all but
one day, de&s;igns to throw her&s;elf from off the
top of the Tower. This, Prince, is what &s;he is
reduced to, and the only Remedy I know of, is, for
you to fly to her with a little Ring, which, as &s;oon
as &s;he &s;hall put it on her Finger, will change
her into a Dove, and &s;o you may &s;ave your&s;elves
together.&endq; The Pidgeon was in the utmo&s;t im|patience
to be gone, but wanted the Ring; he
pulled the Fairy by the Apron and Handkerchief,
to make her under&s;tand what he meant; which &s;he
knowing full well, &s;aid, &startq;Fly, charming Pidgeon,
<HI>giving him the R$ng,</HI> take care you lo&s;e it not, and
it will guide you to <HI>Con&s;tantia.</HI>&endq; But as the Prince
Pidgeon, as I &s;aid before, had no Feathers, the
Fairy rubbed him with a wonderful E&s;&s;ence, that
made the mo&s;t beautiful Feathers grow immediately;
in&s;omuch that he excelled <HI>Venus</HI>'s Doves. Over|joy'd
<PB N="102" REF="103">
to &s;ee him&s;elf replumed again, and taking the
Ring, he arriv'd by break of day at the Tower:
and as there was a &s;pacious Garden on the top of
the Tower, full of Orange-Trees loaded with
Fruit; the Prince, had he not more important Af|fairs
on his hands, could have &s;pent &s;ome time in
admiring it.</P>
<P>He perched upon an Orange-Tree with the Ring
in his Mouth, and in extreme Angui&s;h of Mind;
when the Prince&s;s came into the Garden in a long
white Robe, and her Face cover'd with a black
Veil embroidered with Gold, that hung all upon
her Shoulders; the amorons Pidgeon could not have
been certain that it was her, but by the Noblene&s;s
of her Shape, and her maje&s;tick Air, which too
plainly di&s;cover'd who &s;he was. But when &s;he
came and &s;at under the Orange-Tree, and lifted up
her Veil, he remain'd &s;ometime dazzled. &startq;My &s;ad
Regret, and melanchoy Thoughts, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> are
now u&s;ele&s;s, my afflicted Heart has lived a whole
Year betwixt Hope and Fear, but now the fatal
time is come: this Day, &s;ome few Hours hence,
I mu&s;t die or marry the Giant. Alas! is it po&s;&s;ible
that the Sovereign Fairy, and the Prince <HI>Con&s;tan|tie,</HI>
&s;hould thus abandon me? What have I done?
But what need all the&s;e Reflections? I had bet|ter
execute my noble De&s;ign.&endq; Hereupon &s;he
ro&s;e up with boldne&s;s to throw her&s;elf off; but as
the lea&s;t noi&s;e frighted her, and hearing the Pidgeon
&s;tir in the Trees, &s;he lifted up her Eyes to &s;ee
what it was; when he taking that Opportunity,
flew upon her Shoulder, and put the Ring in her
Brea&s;t. The Prince&s;s was &s;urprized at the Care&s;&s;es
of the Bird, but much more at the Pre&s;ent he made
her; and looking at it &s;ome ti$$, ob&s;erved my&s;te|rious
Characters. When the $word$ came into the
Garden, unheard by her; for &s;ome of the Women
that waited on her, had inform'd that dreadful
Lover of the Prince&s;s's De&s;pair and that &s;he was
determin'd to kill her&s;elf, rather than marry him:
<PB N="103" REF="104">
and knowing that &s;he went early that Morning
upon the top of the Tower, he dreaded &s;ome di&s;|mal
Cata&s;trophe; and his Heart, which never,
till then, had been capable of any thing but
Barbarities, was &s;o engaged by the Charms of
that lovely Maid, that he loved her with a Ten|derne&s;s.
But, Oh Heavens! What a Condition was
&s;he in, when &s;he &s;aw him? She was afraid he
would prevent the Means &s;he &s;ought of Death;
and the poor Pidgeon was not a little terrified at
this formidable <HI>Colo&s;&s;us.</HI> However, the Prince&s;s, in
the Trouble and Confu&s;ion of her Soul, &s;lipt the
Ring on her Finger, and was immediately changed
into a Dove, and flew away with her faithful
Pidgeon.</P>
<P>Never was Surprize equal to that of the Giant's,
who, after having &s;een his Mi&s;tre&s;s metamorpho&s;ed
into a Dove, and traver&s;ing the open Air, remain'd
&s;ome time motionle&s;s; then he made mo&s;t dreadful
Outcrys and Howlings, that &s;haked the neighbour|ing
Mountains, and with them ended his Life.
The charming Prince&s;s flew after her Guide, and
when they had taken a long flight, they lit in a
thick &s;hady Wood, render'd very agreeable by the
Gra&s;s and Flowers that grew therein. <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>
knew not that the Pidgeon was her beloved Prince,
and he was grieved that he could not &s;peak, to tell
her; when &s;uddenly, he felt an invi&s;ible Hand un|loo&s;e
his Tongue, and &s;aid to the Prince&s;s; &startq;Charm|ing
Dove, your Heart has not yet inform'd you,
that you are with a Pidgeon that burns always
with the Flames your bright Eyes fir&s;t kindled.&endq;
&startq;My Heart, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> has ever wi&s;hed for this
Happine&s;s, but never dur&s;t flatter it&s;elf: Alas!
who could imagine it? I was at the very Brink
of De&s;truction, and you came and &s;natch'd me out
of the Arms of Death, or from a Mon&s;ter much
more terrible.&endq; The Prince, overjoy'd to hear
the&s;e Words of his Dove, and to find her as tender
as his De&s;ires could wi&s;h, &s;aid whatever the mo&s;t
<PB N="104" REF="105">
delicate and lively Pa&s;&s;ion could in&s;pire; and told
her all that had happen'd &s;ince the &s;ad Moment of
their Separation, particularly the &s;urprizing Adven|ture
of the Forge, and how he came to the Fairy's
Palace. She was overjoy'd to find that her be&s;t
Friend had all along intere&s;ted her&s;elf in her be|half;
and thereupon &s;aid to <HI>Con&s;tantio,</HI> &startq;Let us go,
my dear Prince, and thank her for all the&s;e Fa|vours,
perhaps &s;he may re&s;tore us to our former
Shapes, and then we will return back to your
Kingdom or mine.&endq; &startq;If you love me with an e|qual
Flame, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> I have one Propo&s;al to
make, wherein Love is only concern'd: but, love|ly
Prince&s;s, you will &s;ay I am extravagant.&endq; &startq;Va|lue
not the Reputation of your Thoughts be|fore
the Ea&s;e of your Heart, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> &s;peak
without re&s;erve; I &s;hall always take a plea&s;ure
to hear you.&endq; &startq;Then I would advi&s;e, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> not
to change our Forms; we may burn, you a Dove,
and I a Pidgeon, with a Pa&s;&s;ion as ardent as <HI>Con|&s;tanti$</HI>
and <HI>Con&s;tantia;</HI> and I am per&s;uaded, that be|ing
free from the Cares of crown'd Heads, we
may live only for each other in this delightful Soli|tude.&endq;
&startq;Ah! <HI>cry'd the Dove,</HI> How delicate and
great is this De&s;ign! For though I am young, I
have undergone &s;o many Misfortunes, &s;ince For|tune,
jealous of my innocent Beauty, has per&s;e|cuted
me &s;o ob&s;tinately, that I &s;hall be overjoy'd
to for&s;ake every thing to live with you. I con|&s;ent,
my dear Prince, let us pitch upon an agree|able
Country, and under this Metamorpho&s;is &s;pend
our days, innocent and free from Ambition, and
all De&s;ires, but tho&s;e of a virtuous Love.&endq; At that
in&s;tant <HI>Cupid</HI> de&s;cending from Heaven, cry'd out, &startq;I
am your Guide, a De&s;ign &s;o full of Tenderne&s;s
de&s;erves my Protection.&endq; &startq;And mine too, <HI>&s;aid the
Sov$reign Fairy,</HI> who appear'd all on a &s;udden; I
come to partake in your Joy.&endq; The Pidgeon and
Dove were as much plea&s;ed as &s;urprized, and put
them&s;elves under the Care of the Fairy. <HI>Cupid</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="106">
invited them to <HI>Paphos,</HI> where he told them his
Mother was wor&s;hipped, and Doves admired; but
<HI>Con&s;tantia</HI> told them, they de&s;ired to have no com|merce
with Men but were happy they could enjoy
a plea&s;ant Solitude.</P>
<P>The Fairy &s;truck the Earth with her Wand, and
<HI>Love</HI> touch'd it with his golden Quiver, and $$$$|&s;ently
the Wood appear'd, adorn'd with Meadows,
Fountains, and Fruit-Trees: &startq;Stay here, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Love,
and &s;wear a la&s;ting Fidelity to each other, in the
Pre&s;ence of this wonderful Fairy.&endq; Which they
both did. After that, the Fairy promi&s;ed, if they
would leave that Metamorpho&s;is, &s;he never would
for&s;ake them, but would re&s;tore them to their for|mer
Shapes. They thank'd her, and a&s;&s;ured her,
it was not in the lea&s;t their De&s;ires, &s;ince they had
made too much trial of the Misfortunes attend|ing
human Life. The Fairy apppoved of their de|&s;pi&s;ing
the Greatne&s;s of the World; and then <HI>Cupid</HI>
and &s;he retired to their Man&s;ions, leaving the
Pidgeon and Dove as Examples of a tender and &s;in|cere

been repre&s;ented as true Emblems of Love and

you is &s;o true, that I have not yet had time to

occa&s;ion, it was for you, and in recompence you
quarrel with me. Well, well, I'll&mdash;&endq; &startq;Hold your
tongue, impudent Prater, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere <HI>as
red as Scarlet,</HI> if the&s;e Ladies were not here I'd

to wait for the Blows of your Care; for by your

<PB N="108" REF="109">
and I now prote&s;t that I will throw off your Li|very,

me alone.&endq; <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> lo&s;t all Patience to &s;ee
<HI>Alain</HI> take the advantage of the ill State his Wound
had reduc'd him to, (tho he had not yet found him|&s;elf
very ill) to make him&s;elf &s;o familiar, that he
flew into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion; and to gain the E&s;teem
of Madam <HI>St. Thomas</HI> and her Daughters, and make
amends for the Impertinence of his Valet, he com|mitted
a greater Crime, by jumping out of Bed, and
running after him. <HI>Alain</HI> knew too well the dan|ger
he was expo&s;ed to, and being u&s;ed to dodge
about the Room to e&s;cape his Ma&s;ter's Rage, he
bethought him&s;elf of this Expedient. When <HI>Dandi|nardiere</HI>
came to him, he &s;tood &s;tock-&s;till, at which
the other was not a little glad, who lifting up his
Fi&s;t to give him a good Knock on the Pate, the
other duck'd and threw him on his No&s;e with &s;uch
violence, that his Turban, Gorger, and Gantlets,
which were all he had on but his Shirt, flew about
the Room. <HI>Alain</HI> never &s;tay'd to &s;tand the &s;econd
&s;hock, but got away while his Ma&s;ter was getting
up; and had not this Scene been &s;o nigh the Door,
Madam <HI>St. Thomas</HI> and her Daughters had run away
too, but could not unle&s;s they would have &s;tep'd over
him: &s;o in the confu&s;ion they went and look'd out
of the Window.</P>
<P>When our furious Hero had got to bed again,
the Vi&s;count de&s;ired them to go to his Bed-&s;ide to
comfort him after this Misfortune; which the Ba|rone&s;s
did not approve of, &s;aying, &startq;What, Mon&s;ieur
<HI>B$rginville,</HI> do you think I can &s;ubmit to &s;uch a
thing, after a Per&s;on has been failing in the Re|&s;pect
due to me? I would have you to know, that
all the Women of my Family have always been
very &s;trict in this point, and I'll be burnt before
I will ever derogate from them.&endq; Hereupon &s;he
began to grow very warm, and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who
heard her with all the Perplexity and Unea&s;ine&s;s
imaginable, begg'd of the Prior to make all proper
<PB N="109" REF="110">
Excu&s;es for his Indi&s;creetne&s;s&punc; who, with the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance
of the two young Ladies, acquitted him&s;elf
&s;o well, that the Barone&s;s forgave him, on condi|tion
he did the &s;ame by <HI>Alain.</HI> This la&s;t Article in
this Treaty of Peace, was as hard to be agreed to
as the other, for the Cit's Heart was very much &s;et
again&s;t his Valet; and the Fall he gave him was
very hard of dige&s;tion: but he lov'd <HI>Virginia</HI> &s;o well,
that to &s;ee her by his Bed-&s;ide again, he promi&s;ed
her Mother his pardon. As for <HI>Alain,</HI> he was trou|bled
with Qualms of Con&s;cience, and went and
hid him&s;elf under &s;ome Tru&s;&s;es of Hay in the Sta|ble,
where he was ju&s;t almo&s;t &s;tifled when a brother
Valet came to tell him the good News of the Re|conciliation,
and that he was wanted. He he&s;ita|ted
&s;ome time what to do, and at la&s;t &s;ent for the
Baron <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> to advi&s;e him whether he &s;hould
go, or in &s;hort run away; and being a&s;&s;ured he
might venture, he went to the Bed's-feet in &s;uch a
&s;uppliant Po&s;ture, as made all the Company laugh
heartily. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> who pretended to do every
thing with a <HI>Bon-Grace,</HI> made a Compliment to Ma|dam
<HI>St. Thomas,</HI> and told her &s;he might always

have one that is young, beautiful, rich, and of
Quality: but above all, &s;he mu&s;t be a Woman of
&s;o much Wit, as to be the admiration of this Age

&s;peak of, <HI>&s;aid he, a little chagrin'd,</HI> &s;avours too much

body con&s;ented, <HI>Virginia</HI> pull'd a Roll of Paper out
of her Pocket, and the Prior read the following
Story.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Story of the Prince&s;s Fair-Star and
Prince Chery.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was a Prince&s;s, who having under|gone
&s;everal great Misfortunes, had nothing
left of all her pa&s;t Grandeur, but two rich Suits of
Clothes; the one of Velvet embroider'd with Pearls,
and the other of Cloth of Gold cover'd over with
Diamonds, which &s;he kept as long as &s;he could;
but the extreme Nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was reduced to,
obliged her often to &s;ell a Pearl or Diamond pri|vately,
to &s;upport her Equipage. She was a Wi|dow,
and had three Daughters, all very hand&s;ome:
<PB N="113" REF="114">
&s;he thought if &s;he brought them up in the Gran|deur
and State &s;uitable to their Rank, they would
become afterwards more &s;en&s;ible of their Misfor|tunes.
Thereupon &s;he determin'd to &s;ell that little
&s;he had left, and go and &s;ettle in &s;ome Country
where they might live cheap; but by the way,
going over a large Fore&s;t, &s;he was robb'd of almo&s;t
all &s;he had. This poor Prince&s;s, after this la&s;t
Misfortune, which was greater than all that had
befell her before, knew &s;he mu&s;t now either earn
her Bread or &s;tarve: and as &s;he all her Life-time
had taken great delight in Cookery, and having a
&s;mall Kitchen furni&s;h'd with golden Plate, which
&s;he u&s;ed to divert her&s;elf in: that which &s;he u&s;ed
to do before for her plea&s;ure, &s;he was now forc'd
to undertake for her livelihood. She took a pretty
little Hou&s;e nigh a great City, and made the be&s;t
Frica&s;&s;ees and Ragouts imaginable; in&s;omuch that
&s;he had a con&s;iderable Trade, and acquir'd great
Fame of being an excellent Cook. In the mean
time her three Daughters grew up, and their Beau|ty,
without doubt, had reach'd the Ears of the
Court, had not their Mother kept them up in their
Chamber. When one day there came a little old
Woman, who &s;eem'd to be very much tired, and
leaning on a Stick, her Body very feeble, and her
Skin all wrinkled and &s;hrivell'd; &startq;I am come,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> to make one good Meal before I leave
this World, that I may brag I have had one;
therefore, <HI>&s;aid &s;he again to the Prince&s;s, drawing her|&s;elf
a Chair to the Fire-&s;ide,</HI> get me &s;omething nice,
and make ha&s;te.&endq; As &s;he had at that time her
Hands fully employ'd, and could not do all her&s;elf,
&s;he call'd her three Daughters down, who&s;e Names,
(in relation to the Colours of their Hair, which was
red, brown, and fair) were <HI>Rou&s;etta, Brunetta,</HI> and
<HI>Blondina;</HI> who were dre&s;s'd like Country Girls in
Bodice and Petticoats, all of different Colours; but
the younge&s;t was the hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t-natured.
The Prince&s;s their Mother order'd one to go take
<PB N="114" REF="115">
&s;ome Pidgeons, another to kill &s;ome Pullets, and
the third to make &s;ome Pa&s;te. In &s;hort, two or
three Cour&s;es were pre&s;ently &s;erved up, and &s;et
before the old Woman, with clean Linen, good
Wine, and every thing in nice Order, which made
her eat and drink with an extraordinary Appetite.
When &s;he had done, &s;he got up, and &s;aid to the
Prince&s;s; &startq;Hone&s;t Friend, had I any Money I would
pay you; but I have been poor the&s;e many Years,
and wanted &s;o kind an Entertainment as you have
given me; all that I can do, is to wi&s;h you bet|ter
Cu&s;tomers than I have been.&endq; The Prince&s;s
&s;miled, and reply'd, &startq;Well, Mother, don't trouble
your&s;elf, I am always well rewarded if I can but
plea&s;e.&endq; And &s;aid <HI>Blondina,</HI> &startq;We are glad it was
in our powers to &s;erve you; if you will &s;up here
too, you &s;hall be welcome.&endq; &startq;Oh! <HI>cry'd the old
Woman,</HI> how happy are they who have &s;uch ge|nerous
Souls! But don't you think of receiving
&s;ome Recompence? Well, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> a&s;&s;ure
your&s;elves, that the fir&s;t Wi&s;h you make without
thinking of me, &s;hall be compleated.&endq; Then &s;he
went away, leaving them &s;ome Rea&s;ons to believe
her to be a Fairy.</P>
<P>This Adventure &s;urprized them; they had never
&s;een a Fairy before, and were frighten'd: in&s;omuch
that for five or &s;ix Months after, they could not
forbear talking of her; and whenever they wi&s;h'd
for any thing, &s;he was always pre&s;ent in their
Thoughts, &s;o that they came to nothing, which
made them very angry with the Fairy. When one
day the King going a hunting, re&s;olved to call
at their Hou&s;e to &s;ee if the Prince&s;s was as notable
a Cook as &s;he was repre&s;ented to him. The three
Si&s;ters were in the Garden gathering Strawberries
when he pa&s;s'd by. &startq;Ah! <HI>&s;aid</HI> Rou&s;etta, was I &s;o
happy as to marry the Admiral, I boa&s;t that I
could &s;pin Thread enough to make Sails for his
whole Navy.&endq; &startq;And I, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Brunetta, was my
Fortune &s;o good that I &s;hould marry the King's
<PB N="115" REF="116">
Brother, I could work Lace enough with my
Needle to hang his Palace.&endq; &startq;And I, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Blon|dina,
would the King have me, boa&s;t at the end
of nine Months to bring him forth two fine Boys
and a Girl, with Stars in their Foreheads, and a
Chain of Gold about their Necks; from who&s;e
Hair, hanging in curious Rings, &s;hould drop va|luable
Jewels.&endq; One of the King's Favourites o|verhearing
their Di&s;cour&s;e, went and inform'd the
King thereof, who order'd them to come to him.
When they enter'd the Room where the King was,
which they did with all Re&s;pect and Mode&s;ty, he
asked them, whether what he had been told of
their Di&s;cour&s;e about Husbands was true or not?
At which they blu&s;h'd, and hung down their Heads;
but upon his pre&s;&s;ing them farther, they own'd
it was. &startq;Certainly, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I know not what Power
influences me, but I will not &s;tir from hence, till
I have married the fair <HI>Blondina.</HI>&endq; &startq;Then, Sir,
<HI>&s;aid his Brother,</HI> you will give me leave to marry
the lovely <HI>Brunetta.</HI>&endq; &startq;And I live not without
hopes, <HI>&s;aid the Admiral,</HI> but your Maje&s;ty will con|&s;ent
to my Happine&s;s, in e&s;pou&s;ing <HI>Rou&s;etta,</HI> with
whom I am charmed.&endq; The King, plea&s;ed that
two of the greate&s;t Per&s;ons in his Dominions &s;hould
follow his Example, approved their Choice, and
asked the Mother's Con&s;ent; who an&s;wer'd, it was
too great an Honour and Happine&s;s for her to re|fu&s;e:
and then the King, Prince, and Admiral,
ki&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t when the King was going to dinner, a Ta|ble
came down the Chimney, whereon was &s;even
golden Di&s;hes of all manner of Rarities, which the
King eat heartily of; the Beaufet was ranged full
of gold Plate, and a fine Symphony plaid all the
time, which made the King imagine it to be a
piece of Witchcraft: when the Prince&s;s, gue&s;&s;ing
that it was owing to a Fairy, a&s;&s;ured him it was
not, and ble&s;&s;ed the hour &s;he entertained the little
old Woman. After the Repa&s;t was over, which
<PB N="116" REF="117">
was &s;o long, that Night &s;urprized them all at Ta|ble;
at which his Maje&s;ty was &s;omewhat a&s;hamed,
for it &s;eem'd as if <HI>Bacchus</HI> ruled at this Wedding
more than <HI>$$pid:</HI> the King pulled a Ring off his
Finger, and put it on <HI>Blondina</HI>'s; and the Prince
and Admiral did the &s;ame: after which all the
King's Retinue &s;aluted, as became them, both the
Queen and Prince&s;s; but for <HI>Rou&s;etta,</HI> &s;he had not
&s;o much Re&s;pect &s;hewn her, for tho &s;he was the
elder Si&s;ter, &s;he was the wor&s;t married. The King
&s;ent a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber to inform the
Queen his Mother of what had happen'd, and to
&s;end Coaches to fetch the Queen <HI>Blondina</HI> and her
two Si&s;ters. When the Queen-Mother, who was
the mo&s;t cruel of all Women, knew that the King
and Prince were married &s;o &s;uddenly, and be&s;ides,
to two Girls of ob&s;cure Birth, &s;he flew into &s;uch a
Pa&s;&s;ion, as frighten'd the whole Court. Then ask|ing
the Gentleman the Rea&s;ons that induced the
King to &s;uch a ba&s;e Marriage, and being told, the
Hopes of having two Boys and a Girl with Stars
on their Foreheads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;he laugh'd di&s;dainfully at
her Son's Credulity, and &s;aid all the mo&s;t invete|rate
things her Rage could invent. When the
Coaches came, the King invited his Mother-in-law
to go along with them; a&s;&s;uring her, that &s;he
&s;hould be look'd upon with all manner of Di&s;tinc|tion.
But &s;he, comparing a Court to the Rolling
of the Waves in a rough Sea, told him &s;he had had
too much Experience of the World, to for&s;ake a
quiet Life. &startq;Why, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> you don't in|tend
to follow your Bu&s;ine&s;s?&endq; &startq;No,&endq; <HI>reply'd &s;he.</HI>
&startq;Then, <HI>added he,</HI> give me leave to appoint you an
Equipage and Attendants.&endq; &startq;I thank you, Sir,
<HI>an&s;wer'd &s;he;</HI> when I am alone, I have none to di|&s;turb
my Repo&s;e, and had I a large Family of Do|me&s;ticks,
there would not fail of &s;ome to incom|mode
me.&endq; The King admired the Sen&s;e and Di&s;|cretion
of a Woman, who both thought and &s;poke
like a Philo&s;opher. But while he was pre&s;&s;ing his
<PB N="117" REF="118">
Mother-in law to go along with him, <HI>Rou&s;etta</HI> went
and hid all the Ve&s;&s;els of Gold that were in the
Beaufet, in the bottom of the Chariot; all which
the Fairy turned into earthen Ware, when &s;he ar|rived
at Court, and came to put them into her
Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>The King and Queen embraced the prudent
Prince&s;s with all Tenderne&s;s, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he
might command whatever lay in their power; and
leaving this rural Abode, came to Town, preceded
by Trumpets, Hautboys, and Kettle-drums. The
Creatures of the Queen-Mother advi&s;ed her todi&s;|gui&s;e
her Re&s;entment, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould anger the
King, and that might produce fatal Con&s;equences;
&s;he approved thereof, con&s;trained her&s;elf, and &s;hew|ed
a great Friend&s;hip for the&s;e her two Daughters-in-law,
making them Pre&s;ents of Jewels, and com|plimenting
them. The fair Queen, and the Prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Brunetta,</HI> were united by a &s;trict Friend&s;hip;
but <HI>Rou&s;etta</HI> hated them mortally for their Good-fortune.
&startq;What, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,</HI> mu&s;t I, who am
the elder, and think my&s;elf a thou&s;and times
hand&s;omer than either of them; mu&s;t I be only
the Wife of an Admiral, who perhaps loves me
not &s;o well as he ought! And &s;hall they be, one a
Queen, and the other a Prince&s;s, and be adored
by their Husbands! Ye Gods, it is intolerable!&endq;
And this Envy to her Si&s;ters made her enter into
the Queen-Mother's Mea&s;ures; for every body
knew, that the Tenderne&s;s &s;he &s;hewed her Daugh|ters-in-law
was all Di&s;&s;imulation, and that &s;he only
wanted an opportunity of doing them all imagina|ble
mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The Queen and Prince&s;s both proved with Child,
and by Ill-fortune a War happen'd, which obliged
the King to put him&s;elf at the Head of his Troops.
The young Queen and the Prince&s;s, finding that
they mu&s;t be left in the power of the Queen-Mo|ther,
de&s;ired they might return home to their own
Mother, which would be &s;ome Comfort to them
<PB N="118" REF="119">
for the lo&s;s of their dear Spou&s;es: but the King
could not be brought to con&s;ent to it; he conjured
his beloved <HI>Blondina</HI> to &s;tay at her Palace, and a&s;|&s;ured
her his Mother &s;hould u&s;e her well. Ac|cordingly
he de&s;ired her, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing man|ner,
to love and take care of her Daughter-in-law,
telling her, that therein &s;he would oblige him
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly; and that he hoped for mo&s;t beauti|ful
Children, and &s;hould long, with the utmo&s;t ex|pectation,
to hear the News. This wicked Queen,
overjoy'd that her Son &s;hould entru&s;t her with his
Wife, promi&s;ed him every thing he de&s;ired, and
a&s;&s;ured him he might be ea&s;y upon that &s;core. The
King, thro his De&s;ire of a quick Return, hazarded
his Troops in all Rencounters; and his Happine&s;s
was, that by his Ra&s;hne&s;s he &s;ucceeded: but before
he could fini&s;h the Campaign, the Queen was
brought to bed, as was al&s;o the Prince&s;s her Si&s;ter,
on the &s;ame day, of a lovely Boy; but &s;he died in
the Birth. <HI>Rou&s;etta</HI>'s Thoughts were wholly em|ploy'd
how &s;he might injure the Queen, and when
&s;he &s;aw &s;uch charming Children, and that &s;he her|&s;elf
had none, her Rage increa&s;ed, and &s;he re&s;olved
to &s;peak &s;oon to the Queen-Mother, for there was
no time to lo&s;e. &startq;Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I am &s;o deeply
touch'd with the Honour your Maje&s;ty has done
me, by letting me &s;hare &s;ome part of your E|&s;teem,
that I willingly would do any thing, tho
again&s;t the Intere&s;t of my own Family, to obey
you. I am not ignorant of the great Di&s;plea&s;ures
you have conceived at the ba&s;e Marriages of the
King and Prince; and here are four Children
born to perpetuate the Crime: our Mother is but
a poor Country Woman, who had &s;carcely a Bit
of Bread to put in her Mouth, when &s;he betook
her to be a Cook. Take my Advice, Madam,
let us make a Frica&s;&s;ee of the&s;e Brats, and put
them out of the World, before they make you
blu&s;h.&endq; &startq;Ah! how much I love thee, my dear
<HI>Rou&s;etta, &s;aid the Queen,</HI> for being &s;o equitable,
<PB N="119" REF="120">
and partaking with me in my ju&s;t Grief? I had
already determined to execute what you now pro|po&s;e;
but then, the manner how perplexes me.&endq;
&startq;Never let that trouble you, <HI>reply'd</HI> Rou&s;etta; I
have a little Bitch that has ju&s;t puppied two little
Dogs and a Bitch, with Stars on their Foreheads,
and Rings about their Necks: we mu&s;t make the
Queen believe that &s;he has been deliver'd of the&s;e
Creatures, and make away with her three Chil|dren,
and that of the Prince&s;s decea&s;ed.&endq; This
Project was approved by the inhuman Queen, who
order'd <HI>Feinti&s;a,</HI> one of her Maids of Honour, to
fetch the Whelps, and dre&s;s them in as fine Linen
and Laces as the Queen's Children &s;hould be, and
put them into the Cradles; then &s;he, follow'd by
<HI>Rou&s;etta,</HI> went and paid the Queen a Vi&s;it: &startq;I am
come to wi&s;h you joy, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> of the Heirs you
have brought forth to my Son; methinks (holding
up the Whelps) their Heads will become a Crown:
now I am not amazed at the Promi&s;e you made
my Son, of bringing two Sons and a Daughter,
with Stars on their Foreheads, and Collars of
Gold about their Necks. Here take them, and
nur&s;e them your&s;elf, for no Women, that I know
of, will ever give their Brea&s;ts to them to &s;uck.&endq;</P>
<P>The poor Queen, &s;urprized at the Relation of
this Misfortune, had like to have died away with
Grief; and when &s;he perceived it was true, &s;eeing
the whole Litter lie yelping upon her Bed, cry'd
mo&s;t bitterly: then cla&s;ping her Hands, &s;aid, &startq;A|las!
Madam, add no Reproaches to my Affliction,
which of it&s;elf is already too great: Had the
Gods permitted me to die, rather than be the
Mother of &s;uch Mon&s;ters, I &s;hould have thought
my&s;elf too happy. Alas! what will become of
me, the King will hate me as much as he loved
me before!&endq; Here her Sighs and Sobbings inter|rupted
her, and her Speech failed her; when the
Queen-Mother, continuing her Reflections, had the
plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing away three Hours by her Bed|&s;ide,
<PB N="120" REF="121">
and then went away. Her Si&s;ter, who pre|tended
to partake of her Grief, told her &s;he was
not the fir&s;t that had had &s;uch Misfortunes; that
&s;he plainly &s;aw it was a trick of the old Fairy's,
who had promi&s;ed &s;uch Wonders; and that as it
might be dangerous for her to &s;ee the King, &s;he
advi&s;ed her to go home to her Mother with her
three Whelps. The Queen return'd no An&s;wer,
but by Tears, which might make the mo&s;t harden'd
Heart relent, to think &s;he mu&s;t be forced to &s;uckle
na&s;ty Whelps, and believe her&s;elf the Mother of
them. The old Queen ordered <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> to take the
four Children and &s;trangle them, and after that bu|ry
them carefully, that &s;he might not be di&s;co|ver'd:
But ju&s;t as &s;he was going to execute that
fatal Commi&s;&s;ion, and had the Cord about their
Necks, &s;he look'd &s;ome time earne&s;tly upon them,
and &s;eeing the Stars in their Foreheads, which &s;he
thinking might portend &s;omething extraordinary,
&s;he dur&s;t not lay criminal hands upon them, but
put them in their Cradle aboard a little Boat, and
with &s;ome Jewels committed them to the Mercy
of the Seas. The Boat was &s;oon forced from the
Shore by the Wind, which at that time was very
boi&s;terous, and was got pre&s;ently out of &s;ight; the
Waves &s;welled as high as Mountains, the Sun was
darken'd by thick Clouds, and the Air was rent by
violent Claps of Thunder, attended with great
Lightnings: in&s;omuch that <HI>Fe$nti&s;a</HI> doubted not in
the lea&s;t but that the Boat was ca&s;t away, and
the&s;e Infants peri&s;h'd; at which &s;he conceived no
&s;mall Joy, &s;he having had all along a Dread,
le&s;t &s;omething &s;hould happen in their favour.</P>
<P>The King, who&s;e Thoughts were always on his
dear Spou&s;e, and the Condition he left her in, ha|ving
concluded a Truce for &s;ome time, returned
with all &s;peed home, and arrived about twelve
Hours after her Delivery. The Queen-Mother met
him, and with a compo&s;ed Air, full of Grief, held
him a long time in her Arms, wetting his Face
<PB N="121" REF="122">
with her Tears, and &s;eeming as if her Sorrow pre|vented
her Speech. The King, all trembling, dur&s;t
not ask her what had happen'd, for he doubted
not but it was &s;ome very great Misfortune. But
at la&s;t, &s;he making as if &s;he u&s;ed &s;ome great Effort
$on her&s;elf, told him that his Queen was brought
to bed of three Whelps, which <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> immediate|ly
pre&s;ented to him; and <HI>Rou&s;etta,</HI> falling on her
Knees, begged of him not to put her Si&s;ter to
death, but to &s;end her back to her Mother; which,
&s;he &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould take as a great favour. The
King was &s;o &s;truck and confounded, that he could
hardly breathe, and looking on the Whelps, and
ob&s;erving, with Surprize, the Star on their Fore|heads,
and the white Ring about their Necks, he
fell into a Swoon, and rolling a thou&s;and things in
his Imagination, could not re&s;olve on any, till the
Queen-Mother pre&s;s'd him &s;o much, that he pro|nounced
his innocent Queen's Bani&s;hment: who
was that minute put into a Litter with her Whelps,
and &s;ent to her Mother's, where &s;he arrived almo&s;t
for dead.</P>
<P>But Heaven looked with a more favourable eye
on the Boat the three Princes and the Prince&s;s
were in; for the Fairy, who protected them, rain'd
Milk into their Mouths, and pre&s;erved them in this
&s;udden and terrible Storm: they floated &s;even
Nights and Days, and were met out at main Sea
by a Cor&s;air, the Captain of which, &s;eeing the
Stars on their Foreheads, tho at a great di&s;tance,
thought the Boat was full of Jewels, which he
found to be true in the end. But what touched
him mo&s;t, was the Beauty of the&s;e four charming
Children, the de&s;ire of pre&s;erving which, made him
turn back again, to give them to his Wife, who
never had any, and was very de&s;irous of them.
She, for her part, was frighten'd to &s;ee him return
&s;o &s;oon, he u&s;ing to &s;tay out a long time, but was
overjoy'd when he put &s;o valuable a Trea&s;ure into
her hands. They both wonder'd at the Star, the
<PB N="122" REF="123">
Chain of Gold, which could not be taken from o$$
their Neck and their fine Hair; but what increa|&s;ed
it the more, was, when the good Woman came
to comb them, there fell out Diamonds, Rubies,
Emeralds, and Pearls, of &s;everal Sizes, &s;ome where|of
were very large and beautiful. The Husband
&s;eeing this, told his Wife he was weary of the
Seas, and that if tho&s;e Children continued to be|&s;tow
&s;uch Trea&s;ures, he would go no more, but
might &s;tay at home, and live as well as the greate&s;t
Captains they had; at which Re&s;olution of her
Husband, the Wife, who&s;e Name was <HI>Cor&s;ina,</HI> was
overjoy'd, and grew every day fonder of the&s;e
Children. The Prince&s;s &s;he call'd <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> the
elder Brother <HI>Bright-Sun,</HI> the &s;econd Son <HI>Felix,</HI> and
the Prince&s;s's Son <HI>Chery,</HI> who was much more beau|tiful
than the others, for all he had neither a Star
nor Chain, and was be&s;t beloved by <HI>Cor&s;ina.</HI> She,
as &s;he could not bring them all up her&s;elf without
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Nur&s;e, de&s;ired her Husband, who
was a great Lover of Hunting, to take &s;ome young
Fawns; which he, as they lived nigh a large Fo|re&s;t,
did accordingly. <HI>Cor&s;ina,</HI> when &s;he had them,
expo&s;ed them to Windward, and the Hinds &s;mel|ling
them, came pre&s;ently to &s;uckle them; when
<HI>Cor&s;ina,</HI> in their &s;tead, put the Children, with
whom their Milk agreed very well. Thus twice
every day there came four of them together, to
&s;uckle the Princes and the Prince&s;s. In this man|ner
were they brought up in their Infancy; the
Cor&s;air and his Wife loved them &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately,
that they were all their Care. He was a Man who
had been well educated, and being a Cor&s;air was
more owing to his Ill-fortune, than any Inclina|tion:
He married <HI>Cor&s;ina</HI> from the Service of a
Prince&s;s, where her Genius and Manners had been
happily cultivated; &s;he knew how to live, and tho
it was in a kind of De&s;art they then inhabited,
where they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon what they got by rob|bing
on the Seas, yet &s;he had not forgot the Ways
<PB N="123" REF="124">
and Manners of the World: They were glad they
were no longer obliged to be expo&s;ed to all the
Dangers of the Seas, but were rich enough with|out;
for every three days &s;he comb'd out of the
Prince&s;s's and her two Brothers Hair, a great ma|ny
con&s;iderable Jewels, which <HI>Cor&s;ina</HI> &s;old at the
nighe&s;t Town, and bought them therewith all man|ner
of Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t Years of their Infancy, the Cor|&s;air
apply'd him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to cultivate the na|tural
Parts, with which Heaven had &s;o largely en|dow'd
them. And he made no doubt, but that
&s;ome great My&s;teries were concealed in their Birth,
and his finding them as he did; therefore he re|&s;olved
to make the Gods an Acknowledgment for
this Pre&s;ent, by his extraordinary Care of their
Education: in&s;omuch that after having enlarged
his Hou&s;e, he hired Ma&s;ters to in&s;truct them in all
manner of Learning and Qualifications, who were
&s;urprized at the great Genius's of their Pupils. The
Cor&s;air and his Wife never divulged this Adven|ture;
but the Children pa&s;s'd for their own, tho
in all their Actions they plainly &s;hew'd they were
of more illu&s;trious Blood. There was a &s;trict U|nity
among them, and a natural Politene&s;s; but
the Prince <HI>Chery</HI>'s Sentiments for the Prince&s;s <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
were more pa&s;&s;ionate than the other two: for
when &s;he de&s;ired any thing, he was ever mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t
to obtain it, and was never from her. When
&s;he went a hunting, he would go too; but if &s;he
&s;tay'd at home, he never failed of an Excu&s;e: and
<HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and <HI>Felix,</HI> her own Brothers, always
&s;poke to her with le&s;s Re&s;pect; all which pa&s;s'd not
unob&s;erved by her. As they grew up, their mutual
Tenderne&s;s increa&s;ed, and they lived with all ima|ginable
Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction. &startq;Dear Brother,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Fair-Star <HI>to him one day,</HI> if my Wi&s;hes could
make you happy, you &s;hould be one of the greate&s;t
Monarchs upon Earth.&endq; &startq;Alas! Si&s;ter, <HI>reply'd he,</HI>
envy me not the Ble&s;&s;ing I enjoy, in being nigh
<PB N="124" REF="125">
you; one moment of which time I prefer to all
the Grandeur you can wi&s;h me.&endq; If &s;he &s;aid the
&s;ame things to her other two Brothers, they only
thanked her in a carele&s;s manner, and &s;aid no
more.</P>
<P>When &s;he was alone, &s;he examined into the Dif|ferences
of Love, and found her Heart to be &s;ome|what
di&s;po&s;ed like theirs; for tho <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and
<HI>Felix</HI> were both dear to her, &s;he could not wi&s;h to
live with them all her Life: but for <HI>Chery,</HI> &s;he was
all in Tears at the lea&s;t thought of his Father's
&s;ending him to Sea, or into the Army. 'Twas th$$
Love, di&s;gui&s;ed under the &s;pecious Name of an ex|cellent
Nature, grafted it&s;elf into the&s;e young
Hearts. But at fourteen Years of Age, <HI>Fair-Star</HI> be|gan
to reproach her&s;elf with not loving her Bro|thers
all alike, but imagined the Rea&s;on proceeded
from the Cares and Care&s;&s;es of <HI>Chery,</HI> whom &s;he
forbid from endeavouring to endear him&s;elf any
more; telling him, that he had found out the way
but too agreeably, and had made too great a diffe|rence
between them. He, overjoy'd to hear her
&s;peak in this manner, in&s;tead of abating his Pa&s;|&s;ion,
rather permitted it to increa&s;e, and every
day evidenced &s;ome new piece of Gallantry. They
knew not yet how far their Tenderne&s;s might pro|ceed,
and indeed not the nature of it; till one day,
&s;ome new Books being brought to <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> the
fir&s;t &s;he laid her hand on, was a Story of two young
Lovers, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion began when they thought
them&s;elves Brother and Si&s;ter; but being known by
their Parents, were married together after a great
many difficulties: And as <HI>Chery</HI> read with great
Ju&s;tne&s;s and a fine Accent, &s;he de&s;ired him to read
it to her, while &s;he made an end of a piece of
Lace, which &s;he intended to fini&s;h.</P>
<P>It was with no &s;mall Concern that he read this
Adventure, e&s;pecially when he &s;aw &s;o naked a
De&s;cription of his own Sentiments; and <HI>Fair-Star</HI>
was no le&s;s &s;urprized, for it &s;eem'd as if the Author
<PB N="125" REF="126">
$ad known all that pa&s;s'd in her Soul: The more
<HI>Chery</HI> read, the more he was affected; and &s;he, tho
$he endeavour'd all &s;he could, was not able to hin|der
the Tears from gu&s;hing out from her Eyes,
<HI>Chery,</HI> on his part, made u&s;ele&s;s Endeavours to con|ceal
his Trouble; he fir&s;t turn'd pale, and then red,
and faulter'd in his Speech: and thus were they
both in great Agonies. Ah! Si&s;ter, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> (look|ing
&startq;melancholy at her, and letting the Book fall
out of his hands) how happy was <HI>Hippolito,</HI> that he
was not Brother to <HI>Julia?</HI>&endq; &startq;We &s;hall not have
the like Satisfaction, <HI>an&s;wer'd &s;he,</HI> tho we de&s;erve
it as much.&endq; The words were no &s;ooner out of
her Mouth, but &s;he knew &s;he had &s;aid too much,
and became confu&s;ed; which was the only thing,
if any there was, that could comfort the Prince.
From that time they both fell into a deep Melan|choly,
without explaining them&s;elves any farther,
tho both penetrated into what pa&s;s'd in each o|ther's
Soul; and both &s;trove to conceal a Secret
from the World, which they would have been glad
to have been ignorant of them&s;elves. But as it is
natural for us to flatter our&s;elves, the Prince&s;s
plea&s;ed her&s;elf, that <HI>Chery</HI> had not the Star, nor
Chain of Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>One day the three Princes being gone a hunting
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> went up into a little dark Clo&s;et, which
&s;he loved to &s;it and think in, the which was &s;epa|rated
only by a thin Partition from <HI>Cor&s;ina</HI>'s Cham|ber;
where &s;he heard her (thinking &s;he was gone
a walking) &s;ay to the Cor&s;air, &startq;It is now time to
think of marrying <HI>Fair-Star;</HI> if we knew who &s;he
was, we &s;hould endeavour to marry her &s;uitable
to her Rank: or if we could believe that the&s;e,
who pa&s;s for her Brothers, were not &s;o, we might
be&s;tow her on one of them; for where can we find
one more de&s;erving of her?&endq; &startq;When I found them,
<HI>&s;aid the Cor&s;air,</HI> I &s;aw nothing that could inform
me of their Birth, but knew by the Jewels that
were fa&s;ten'd to their Cradles, that they were no
<PB N="126" REF="127">
mean Per&s;ons; and what is more &s;ingular, you
know they &s;eem'd all of an Age, and four are
too many for one Birth.&endq; &startq;I &s;u&s;pected &s;o, <HI>&s;aid</HI>
Cor&s;ina, that <HI>Chery</HI> is not their Brother, for he
has neither a Star nor Collar.&endq; &startq;That's true, <HI>re|ply'd
the Husband,</HI> but Jewels fall out of his Hair
as well as the others; yet after all the Riches
we have ama&s;&s;ed together by them, I could wi&s;h
to know who&s;e they are.&endq; &startq;That we mu&s;t leave
to the Gods, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Cor&s;ina, who gave them us, and
when they &s;hall think fit, will let us know.&endq;
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> li&s;ten'd attentively to their Di&s;cour&s;e, and
could not expre&s;s her Joy, that &s;he might hope &s;he
was born of illu&s;trious Parents, tho &s;he had never
failed any ways in re&s;pect to tho&s;e &s;he thought to
be hers; and yet was not over well plea&s;ed at her
being a Cor&s;air's. But what flatter'd her Imagina|tion
mo&s;t, was to think that <HI>Chery</HI> was not her Bro|ther;
which Thought made her impatient to &s;ee
him, to tell him of this extraordinary Adventure.
Hereupon &s;he went and took hor&s;e, and followed
them by the Sound of the Horn. <HI>Chery,</HI> as &s;oon as
he &s;aw her, came to meet her before the other
two. &startq;How agreeable a Surprize is this, <HI>Fair-Star,
&s;aid he,</HI> to &s;ee you a hunting, who are never to be
drawn away from your Mu&s;ick and other Amu&s;e|ments?&endq;
&startq;I have &s;o many things to tell you, <HI>re|ply'd
&s;he,</HI> that I came to &s;eek you, to talk in pri|vate
with you.&endq; &startq;Alas! Si&s;ter, <HI>&s;aid he &s;ighing,</HI> what
is it you would have with me to-day, for it is a
long time &s;ince you have taken any notice of me?&endq;
At that &s;he blu&s;h'd, and ca&s;t down her Eyes, and
remain'd &s;ome time thoughtful, without ever re|turning
any An&s;wer. At la&s;t, when her two Bro|thers
came to them, &s;he, like one awaken'd out of
a Lethargy, jump'd from off her Hor&s;e, and went,
follow'd by them, to a little Hillock, &s;urrounded
with &s;hady Trees; where &s;he &s;aid to them, &startq;Sit
down here, and I will tell you what I have
heard.&endq; And accordingly &s;he told them word for
<PB N="127" REF="128">
word the Cor&s;air's and his Wife's Di&s;cour&s;e, and
how that they were not their Children. Nothing
can be &s;aid to expre&s;s the Surprize of the three
Princes; they debated among them&s;elves what they
had be&s;t to do: one was for going without &s;aying
any thing, another was not for going at all, and
the third was for going and acquainting them with
it. The fir&s;t maintain'd his was the &s;ure&s;t way,
becau&s;e the advantage they made of them would
induce them to keep them; the &s;econd &s;aid, it was
not proper to leave them, unle&s;s they had &s;ome|where
to go, where they might be well received,
for that he could not bear the thoughts of being
called Wanderers; the third alledged the Ingrati|tude
of leaving them without their Con&s;ents; that
it was Folly to &s;tay any longer with them in a
de&s;art part of the World, where they could never
learn who they were, and that therefore the only
way was to tell them of their De&s;ign, and get
their Con&s;ents. This Opinion at la&s;t prevailing,
they all took hor&s;e again, and returned home to
the Cor&s;air.</P>
<P><HI>Chery</HI>'s Heart was flatter'd with all that Hope can
offer mo&s;t agreeable to comfort an afflicted Lover;
his Love made him gue&s;s at what was to come:
he no longer looked upon him&s;elf as Brother to
<HI>Fair-Star,</HI> and his con&s;trained Pa&s;&s;ion taking wing a
little, permitted a thou&s;and Ideas that charmed
him. They addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to the Cor&s;air
and his Wife with a vi&s;ible Joy, and yet Unea&s;ine&s;s
in their Faces: &startq;We come not, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Bright-Sun,
to deny the Friend&s;hip, Gratitude, and Re&s;pect
we owe you, tho we are inform'd how you found
us on the Sea, and that you are not our Father
and Mother. The Piety with which you &s;aved
us, the noble Education you have given us, and
the Care and Bounty you have &s;hewn, are &s;uch
indi&s;pen&s;able Ties, that nothing in this World
can free us from. We are come now to renew
our &s;incere Thanks, and to beg of you to relate
<PB N="128" REF="129">
to us &s;o rare an Event, and to advi&s;e us, that
guided by your wi&s;e Coun&s;els, we may have no|thing
to reproach our&s;elves withal.&endq; The Cor&s;air
and his Wife were very much &s;urprized, that a
thing, which they had concealed with &s;o much Care,
&s;hould be di&s;cover'd. &startq;You are too well inform'd,
<HI>&s;aid they,</HI> and we can no longer hide from you,
that you are not our Children, and that Fortune
alone put you into our hands. We have no know|ledge
of your Birth, but by the Jewels that were
found in your Cradles, gue&s;s your Parents to be
People of Quality, or very rich. What can we
advi&s;e you more? If you con&s;ult the Friend&s;hip
we have for you, you will, without doubt, &s;tay
here with us, and comfort us in our old Age by
your Pre&s;ence. If you don't like this Hou&s;e or
Abode, we will remove where you &s;hall think
fit, provided it be not to Court, which a long
Experience has made us di&s;reli&s;h; and will make
you too, if you knew but the continual Trouble
and Care, the Di&s;gui&s;es and Di&s;&s;imulations, the
Envy and Strife, the fal&s;e Happine&s;s, and all the
Mi&s;chiefs attending there: I could tell you more,
but that you may think my Coun&s;els too much
intere&s;ted; which they really are, my dear Chil|dren:
we only de&s;ire to detain you in this peace|able
Retreat; yet you are your own Ma&s;ters, to
go when you will. Con&s;ider, now you are in
the Haven, and are going to &s;ail in a boi&s;te|rous
Sea; the Trouble exceeds the Plea&s;ure: the
Cour&s;e of Man's Life is limited, and oftentimes
is cut &s;hort by one half; the Grandeurs of this
World are like fal&s;e Stones; the mo&s;t &s;olid Hap|pine&s;s
is to know how to &s;et Bounds to our De|&s;ires,
to be wi&s;e, and live in a perfect Tranquil|lity.&endq;</P>
<P>The <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> had not made an end of the&s;e his
Remon&s;trances &s;o &s;oon, but that he was interrupted
by Prince <HI>Felix:</HI> &startq;We have too great a de&s;ire, dear
Father, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to make &s;ome Di&s;coveries of our
<PB N="129" REF="130">
Births, to live buried here in a De&s;art; the
Morals you have laid down are excellent, and I
wi&s;h we were able to follow them: but I know
not what Fatality guides us; let us fulfil our De|&s;tiny,
we will come and &s;ee you again, and give
you an account of our Adventures.&endq; At the&s;e
Words the <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> and his Wife bur&s;t out in Tears;
the Princes very much relented, and particularly <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
who was of a &s;weet Di&s;po&s;ition, and would
never have thought of going away, had &s;he but
<HI>Chery</HI> to &s;tay with her. After this Re&s;olution, their
Thoughts were wholly bent upon their Equipage
and their Embarkation; for they hoped, when at
Sea, to get &s;ome light of what they wanted to
know. They put four Hor&s;es aboard; and after
having combed their Heads to give <HI>Cor&s;ina</HI> as many
Jewels as po&s;&s;ibly they could, they de&s;ired her in
exchange to give them the Chains and Diamonds
that &s;he found in their Cradle: who went imme|diately
and fetch'd them out of her Clo&s;et, where
&s;he kept them &s;afe, and tied them all upon <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
whom &s;he embraced with all motherly Affection,
wetting her Face with her Tears.</P>
<P>Never was any Separation more melancholy; the
Cor&s;air and his Wife were ready to die with Grief:
but their Sorrows proceeded not from Intere&s;t;
they had already ama&s;s'd too much Riches to de&s;ire
any more. In &s;hort <HI>Bright-Sun, Felix, Chery,</HI> and
<HI>Fair-Star,</HI> went aboard a Ve&s;&s;el which the Cor&s;air
had fitted out with all Magnificence, and fine
Paintings, of the Stories of <HI>Cl$o$atra</HI> and <HI>Mark An|thony,</HI>
and all the Attendants of <HI>Venus.</HI> The Cour&s;e
they &s;teer'd was to the &s;ame Degrees of Latitude
where the Cor&s;air found them, and prepared a
great Sacrifice for the Gods and Fairies to obtain
their Protection, and guide them to the place of
their Birth. They took a Turtle-Dove, and were
going to &s;acrifice it, but that the compa&s;&s;ionate
Prince&s;s thought it &s;o beautiful, that &s;he &s;aved its
Life, and let it fly, &s;aying, &startq;Go thou pretty Bird
<PB N="130" REF="131">
of <HI>Venus,</HI> if I &s;hould ever want thy a&s;&s;i&s;tance, re|member
what I have done for thee.&endq; Away went
the Bird, and when the Sacrifice was over, there
was heard &s;uch a charming Concert of Mu&s;ick, that
all Nature &s;eem'd to keep a profound &s;ilence to
li&s;ten to it; the Seas were calm, and the Winds
only breath'd gentle Zephirs, which only di&s;order'd
the Prince&s;s's Veil and Hair: and a Syren aro&s;e
out of the Water, and &s;ung, while the Prince&s;s and
her Brothers admired her. After &s;ome Airs, &s;he
turn'd her&s;elf towards them, and &s;aid, <HI>Be not unea&s;y;
let your Ve&s;&s;el drive, before the Wind; and where it &s;tops,
there di&s;embark; and let tho&s;e who love, love &s;till on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fair-Star</HI> and <HI>Chery</HI> were &s;en&s;ible of an extraordi|nary
Joy at the&s;e Words of the Syren's; never di&s;|puting
but that they related to them; and by Signs
gave each other to under&s;tand as much, without
<HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and <HI>Felix</HI> perceiving them in the lea&s;t.
The Ship &s;ailed at the plea&s;ure of the Winds and
Sea; they had nothing extraordinary happen'd in
their Voyage, and the Weather was all the time very
fine, and the Sea calm. They were full three
Months out at Sea, during which time the amorous
Prince had a great deal of Conver&s;ation with his
beloved Prince&s;s, and one day, among others, &s;aid
to her; &startq;How flattering are my Hopes, charming
<HI>Fair-Star!</HI> I am no longer your Brother: this
Heart, which again acknowledges your Power,
and ever &s;hall, was never form'd to be guilty of
&s;uch a Crime; for a Crime it would be to love
you as I do, if you was my Si&s;ter: but the cha|ritable
Syren has confirm'd what I always &s;u&s;|pected.&endq;
&startq;Ah! Brother, <HI>replied &s;he,</HI> tru&s;t not &s;o
much to a thing which is yet &s;o dark that we
cannot penetrate into it. What will become of
us, if we &s;hould irritate the Gods again&s;t us, by
Sentiments that may not be plea&s;ing to them?
The Syren has explain'd her&s;elf &s;o little, that we
mu&s;t be very fond of gue&s;&s;ing at Riddles, to apply
what &s;he &s;aid to our&s;elves.&endq; &startq;Ah, cruel Maid,
<PB N="131" REF="132">
<HI>&s;aid the afflicted Prince,</HI> your Refu&s;al proceeds more
from Aver&s;ion to me, than Re&s;pect to the Gods.&endq;
<HI>$air-Star</HI> made no Reply, but rai&s;ing her Eyes up
$word$ Heaven, fetch'd a deep Sigh, which he explain'd
$word$ his favour.</P>
<P>The Days were then very long and hot; towards
$he Evening the Prince&s;s and her Brothers went
upon the Deck, to &s;ee the Sun repo&s;e him&s;elf in
$he Brea&s;t of his beloved <HI>Thetis;</HI> and taking their
In&s;truments, began a very agreeable Concert. In
the mean time, a fre&s;h Gale of Wind ari&s;ing, they
&s;oon doubled a Point, which conceal'd from their
Eyes a beautiful City, the Pro&s;pect of which ama|zed
and plea&s;ed our lovely Youths &s;o much, that
they wi&s;h'd their Ve&s;&s;el might enter the Port; but
doubted le&s;t there &s;hould not be room, there be|ing
&s;o many in before them, that the Ma&s;ts look'd
like a floating Fore&s;t. Their De&s;ires were accom|pli&s;h'd;
the Shores were pre&s;ently crouded to &s;ee
the Magnificence of the Ship, which was no ways
inferior for beauty to that &s;ent by the <HI>Argonauts</HI> to
fetch the golden Fleece. All that &s;aw the Stars on
the Princes, were fill'd with Admiration; and &s;ome
ran to inform the King of it; who as he could not
believe it, and as the large great Terra&s;s belonging
to his Palace look'd to the Sea, he came pre&s;ently
and &s;aw the Princes <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and <HI>Chery,</HI> taking the
Prince&s;s in their Arms, and carrying her a&s;hore;
and after that un&s;hipping their Hor&s;es, the Richne&s;s
of who&s;e Accoutrements were an&s;werable to the
re&s;t. That <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> was mounted on, was as black
as Jet; <HI>Felix</HI>'s was grey, <HI>Chery</HI>'s as white as Milk,
and the Prince&s;s's an <HI>I&s;abella;</HI> which four Hor&s;es
carried them&s;elves &s;o hand&s;omely, and curvetted &s;o
fine, that the King very much admired them.</P>
<P>The Princes hearing the People &s;ay, there's the
King, there's the King, lifting up their Eyes, be|held
in him an Air of &s;o much Maje&s;ty, that they
no longer di&s;puted but it was true; and pa&s;&s;ing by
him, made him each a low Bow, fixing their Eyes
<PB N="132" REF="133">
on him all the time; while he looking no le&s;s ear|ne&s;tly
upon them, was charm'd with the incompa|rable
Beauty of the Prince&s;s, and the good Mein
of the three Princes. He &s;ent the fir&s;t Gentleman
of his Bed-chamber to offer them his Protection and
whatever they &s;hould want, they being perfect
Strangers. They accepted of the Honour the King
did them, with a great deal of Re&s;pect and Acknow|ledgment,
and told him that they only wanted an
Hou&s;e where they might live private, and that
they &s;hould be glad if it could be two or three
Miles from the City, becau&s;e they took great de|light
in walking. He accordingly did as they
de&s;ired, and lodged them and their Train commo|diou&s;ly.
The King, who&s;e Thoughts were full of
what he had &s;een, went immediately into the
Queen Mother's Apartment, and told her what he
had been &s;eeing, and how much he admired the
Youths and the young Lady. At this News &s;he
&s;tood as it were thunder-&s;truck: but recovering her|&s;elf,
ask'd in a carele&s;s manner, of what Age they
might be, and he an&s;wering about fifteen or &s;ix|teen;
her Unea&s;ine&s;s increa&s;ed, and &s;he apprehend|ed
with fear that <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> had betray'd her: while
the King walked about the Room in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion
and Concern, often &s;aying, &startq;How happy mu&s;t that
Father be, who is ble&s;t with &s;uch an Off-&s;pring!
and how mi&s;erable am I to be a King and Father
to three Whelps, and have no Heirs to my Crown.&endq;</P>
<P>The old Queen heard the&s;e Words with a dead|ly
Dread; the Stars, and the nearne&s;s of their Age
with the Princes and their Si&s;ter, gave her great
Su&s;picions that <HI>Feinti&s;a,</HI> in&s;tead of making away
with the King's Children, had pre&s;erved them: but
as &s;he was a Woman that had a great command
over her&s;elf, &s;he di&s;cover'd not in the lea&s;t what
agitated her Soul; and would not &s;end that day to
inform her&s;elf of what &s;he de&s;ired &s;o much to know;
but the next day &s;ent her Secretary under pretext
of giving &s;ome Orders for their Entertainment, to
<PB N="133" REF="134">
examine and enquire into what was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to
her Repo&s;e. The Secretary went early the next
Morning, and arrived ju&s;t as the Prince&s;s was &s;et
down to her Toilet, and was combing her Hair,
which hung down in fine Rings below her Wai&s;t,
which was hung round with Baskets to catch the
Jewels &s;he comb'd out; her Star &s;hined &s;o bright
that it dazzled him, and the Chain of Gold about her
Neck, &s;eem'd no le&s;s extraordinary than the Dia|monds,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> rolling down from the top of her Head.
The Secretary could hardly believe his eyes; when
the Prince&s;s making choice of a large Pearl, &s;uch as
the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> e&s;teem &s;o much by the Name of
<HI>Peregrina,</HI> or the Pi$grim, as it came from a Tra|veller,
&s;he de&s;ired him to accept of it, that there|by
he might remember her. He, confounded by &s;o
much Liberality, took his leave of her, and went
to pay his re&s;pects to the three Princes, with whom
he &s;tay'd &s;ome time to inform him&s;elf of what his
Mi&s;tre&s;s de&s;ired &s;o much to know; and after that
return'd back to the Queen, with an account that
confirm'd what &s;he &s;o much fear'd. He told her
<HI>Chery</HI> had no Star, but that Diamonds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fell out
of his Hair; and that in his opinion he was the
hand&s;ome&s;t: that they were come a great way off;
and that their Father and Mother had prefix'd a
time for them to fini&s;h their Travels in.</P>
<P>This Article put the Queen a little to a &s;tand,
and &s;he imagined &s;ometimes that they were not the
King's Children. Thus &s;he waver'd between hope
and fear; when the King hunting one day by their
Hou&s;e, the Gentleman of his Bed-chamber told him
as they pa&s;t by, that it was there the Prince&s;s and
$er Brothers lived. &startq;The Queen has advi&s;ed me,
<HI>reply'd the King,</HI> not to &s;ee them, fearing le&s;t they
may have come from &s;ome Place where the Plague
rages, and may bring &s;ome Infection with them.&endq;
&startq;Indeed, <HI>reply'd the G$ntleman,</HI> it is very dangerous;
but I believe there's more to be fear'd from the
Eyes of this young Stranger, than any Infection
<PB N="134" REF="135">
of the Air.&endq; &startq;I am of your opinion,&endq; &s;aid the
King, and &s;purring his Hor&s;e, went forward; when
pre&s;ently hearing a Sound of In&s;truments, he &s;topt
at the Hall Windows, which were open; and after
having admired the Sweetne&s;s of this Symphony,
went on. The noi&s;e the Hor&s;es made, engag'd the
Princes to look out; who, when they &s;aw the
King, &s;aluted him very re&s;pectfully, and made all
ha&s;te to come out; and acco&s;ting him with a gay
Countenance and much Submi&s;&s;ion, they embraced
his Knees, and the Prince&s;s ki&s;s'd his Hand. The
King care&s;s'd them with a plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction, and
found his Heart &s;o touch'd, that he could not gue&s;s
at the cau&s;e. He bid them not fail of coming to
Court, telling them he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee
them there, and that he would pre&s;ent them to his
Mother. They thank'd him for the Honour he did
them, and a&s;&s;ured him, that as &s;oon as their Clothes
and Equipage were got ready, they would make
appearance there. After this the King left them
to pur&s;ue his Game, and &s;ent them one half of what
he kill'd, and carried the other with him to the
Queen his Mother; who &s;aid to him, &startq;How comes
this about? you u&s;ed to kill three times as much as
this.&endq; &startq;Indeed, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> I have regaled the
beautiful Strangers with &s;ome; and I have &s;o &s;trong
a Fancy for them, that were you not &s;o much
afraid of &s;ome Contagion, I would lodge them in
the Palace.&endq;</P>
<P>The old Queen very much vex'd, accu&s;ed him of
want of Re&s;pect to her, and reproach'd him for
expo&s;ing him&s;elf &s;o ra&s;hly; and when he was gone,
&s;ent for <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> into her Clo&s;et, and catching hold
of her Hair with one Hand, and clapping a Poy|nard
to her Throat with the other, &s;aid, &startq;I know
not, ba&s;e Wretch, what Remains of Kindne&s;s

thou ha&s;t betray'd me, and ha&s;t not kill'd
the four Children I put in thy hands for that pur|po&s;e:

thee,&endq; <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> half dead with Fear, ca&s;t her&s;elf

becau&s;e there aro&s;e ju&s;t then &s;uch a terrible Tem|pe&s;t,
that in all probability they mu&s;t be ca&s;t away,
adding, that if &s;he would but give her time, &s;he
would find out a way to de&s;troy them one after
another, without the lea&s;t Su&s;picion. The Queen,
whom nothing but the Promi&s;e of their Death could
appea&s;e, bid her to lo&s;e no time; and indeed <HI>Fein|ti&s;a,</HI>
who &s;aw her. Life in great danger, neglected
nothing that lay in her power: &s;he watched the

and carrying a Guittar under her Arm, went and
&s;at over again&s;t the Prince&s;s's Window, and &s;ung

<HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> had given, that &s;he &s;eem'd unea&s;y; and
<HI>Chery,</HI> who&s;e whole Study was to ob&s;erve her Humour
and Motions, was not long before he ob&s;erv'd it.
&startq;What is the matter, my dear <HI>Star, &s;aid he,</HI> perhaps
you like not the Country where we are; if &s;o,
we will go away immediately; perhaps you are
not plea&s;ed with our Equipage, it is not fine e|nough:
&s;peak, and tell me, that I may have the
plea&s;ure of obeying you fir&s;t.&endq; &startq;The Confidence
which you give me, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> to tell you what
pa&s;&s;es in my Mind, engages me to declare to you,
that I cannot live without the Dancing-Water
which is in the burning Fore&s;t; had I that, I need
not fear any thing from the Power of Time.&endq;
&startq;Trouble not your&s;elf, my lovely <HI>Star, added he,</HI>
I will go and fetch it you, or let you know by
my Death, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to have it.&endq; &startq;No,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I would rather renounce all the Advan|tages
of Beauty, and be horridly frightful than
hazard a Life &s;o dear. I conjure you never to
think more of this Water; and, if I have any
power over you, I forbid you.&endq; The Prince &s;eem'd
to obey, but as &s;oon as he &s;aw her engaged and
bu&s;y, he mounted his white Hor&s;e, and furni&s;h'd
his Pockets plentifully with Money; and for Jew|els
his Head &s;upply'd him &s;ufficiently: He took no
Attendants with him, that he might be more at his
his own liberty; and that if any dangerous Adven|ture
pre&s;ented, he might not be troubled with the
Remon&s;trances of an over-zealous and timorous Ser|vant.</P>
<P>When Supper-time came, and the Prince&s;s &s;aw
not her Brother <HI>Chery,</HI> &s;he was &s;o much troubled,
<PB N="138" REF="139">
that &s;he could neither eat nor drink, but ordered
the Servants to &s;earch every where for him. The
other two Princes, who knew nothing of the Dan|cing-Water,
told her &s;he was too unea&s;y, and that
he could not be far off; that &s;he knew he loved Re|tirement
&s;ometimes, to indulge his Thoughts, and
that without doubt, he was amu&s;ing him&s;elf in a
little Wood that was hard by. This made her ea&s;y,
for &s;ome time, but then again &s;he lo&s;t all Pa|tience,
and told her Brothers, crying, that &s;he was
the Cau&s;e of his Ab&s;ence, by expre&s;&s;ing a De&s;ire to
have &s;ome of the Dancing-Water in the burning
Fore&s;t, and that without doubt he was gone thither.
At this news, they re&s;olv'd to &s;end after him, and
&s;he charged the Me&s;&s;engers to tell him, that &s;he
conjured him to come back. In the mean time,
<HI>Feinti&s;a,</HI> who was not without her Spies, to know
the Effect of her Advice, when &s;he learnt that <HI>Chery</HI>
was gone, was overjoy'd; not doubting in the lea&s;t,
but he would make more ha&s;te than tho&s;e that fol|low'd
him, and that &s;ome Mi&s;chief would befall
him. Big with the&s;e Hopes, &s;he ran to the Queen-Mother,
to give her an account of all that had pa&s;t;
telling her, that &s;he no longer di&s;puted, but that
they were the three Princes and their Si&s;ter, &s;ince
they had Stars on their Foreheads, and golden
Chains about their Necks, and that &s;he had &s;een
the Prince&s;s dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Diamonds &s;he put
into her Cradle, though they were nothing nigh
&s;o valuable as &s;ome that dropped out of her Hair:
In&s;omuch, that &s;he was a&s;&s;ured of their being re|turn'd,
notwith&s;tanding the care &s;he thought &s;he
had taken to prevent it. &startq;But, Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI>
as the only Means left me to repair this Fault
of mine, is to rid you of them, give me but time,
and I will effectually do it: There's one of the
Princes gone already to fetch the Dancing-Water,
who, undoubtedly, will peri&s;h in the Attempt;
and I &s;hall form Schemes enough for the re&s;t.&endq;
&startq;We &s;hall &s;ee, <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> whether the Succe&s;s
<PB N="139" REF="140">
an&s;wers your Expectation, which is the only
thing that &s;hall skreen you from my ju&s;t Rage.&endq;
Upon this, <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> retir'd, not a little alarm'd, de|vi&s;ing
with her&s;elf how to pro&s;ecute her Under|takings.</P>
<P>The Contrivance of the Prince <HI>Chery</HI>'s De&s;truction
was one of the mo&s;t certain, for the Dancing-Water
was not ea&s;ily to be got; the Reports of the Misfor|tunes
that attended all tho&s;e who had gone for it, had
made the Way known almo&s;t to every body. The
Prince never &s;pared his white Nag, who went at
an incredible Swiftne&s;s, &s;o willing was he to re|turn
&s;oon to <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> to give her all the Sati&s;|faction
&s;he could promi&s;e her&s;elf from his Journey.
He was eight Days and Nights without taking any
Repo&s;e, but what he got under a Tree in a Wood
or Fore&s;t, while his Hor&s;e was grazing; and lived
on, what Fruits he found on the Trees. The ninth
Day, he found him&s;elf very much incommoded by
the exce&s;&s;ive Heat of the Air, and not knowing
what Cau&s;e to attribute it to, &s;ince he was certain
it was not the Sun, when he gain'd the top of
a Hill, he perceiv'd the burning Fore&s;t; where
the Trees were always in Flames, without ever
con&s;uming; which ca&s;t &s;uch a Heat, that all the
Country about was a dry De&s;art. In this Fore&s;t,
the Prince heard the Hi&s;&s;ings of Adders, and the
Roarings of Lions, which very much amazed him;
who could not believe that any thing but a Sala|mander
could live in a kind of Furnace. After
having con&s;idered on &s;o dreadful a thing, and
thought on what was to be done, he gave him&s;elf
up for lo&s;t; when going nigher to this great Fire,
and being ready to die with Thir&s;t, finding a Foun|tain,
he alit from off his Hor&s;e, and &s;tooping to take
up &s;ome Water in a golden Ve&s;&s;el he brought with
him, to carry that the Prince&s;s de&s;ired in, he per|ceiv'd
a Turtle drowning, and taking pity on it,
&s;aved it; and after having held it &s;ome time by the
Heels, and wiped its wet Feathers, put it in his
<PB N="140" REF="141">
Bo&s;om, where the poor Turtle recovered. &startq;Prince
<HI>Chery, &s;aid it, in a &s;oft tender Voice,</HI> you never could
have obliged any Creature more full of Acknow|ledgment
than my&s;elf: This is not the fir&s;t time I
have receiv'd mo&s;t &s;ignal Favours from your Fami|ly;
I am glad that now I can, in return, be &s;er|viceable
to you. Think not that I am ignorant of
the Cau&s;e of this your Journey, which you have
too ra&s;hly undertaken, &s;ince it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
to tell how many have peri&s;hed here. The Dan|cing-Water
is the eighth Wonder of the World;
it beautifies Ladies, makes them young again, and
enriches them; but if I am not your Guide, you
can never get to it: The Source of the Water falls
with &s;o great an Impetuo&s;ity into a deep Aby&s;s:
In the Road is a Blockade of Trees, laid &s;o clo&s;e,
and &s;o entangled by their Branches and Briars,
that I &s;ee no Way but to go under Ground. Re&s;t
your&s;elf here, and be not unea&s;y, I will go and
take proper Mea&s;ures about it.&endq;</P>
<P>Then the Turtle left him, flying backwards and
forwards, and taking &s;everal Flights about; and to|wards
the Clo&s;e of the Day, came and told the
Prince all was ready: Who took the loving Bird in
his Hand, ki&s;&s;ing it, care&s;s'd it, and thank'd it;
and after that, followed it upon his white Hor&s;e.
They had not gone many hundred Yards, before
the Prince &s;eeing a great number of Foxes, Badgers,
Moles, and other Creatures that burrough, and
wondring how they came to be &s;o a&s;&s;embled toge|ther,
the Turtle told him it was by her means, and
that they came to work for his Service. <HI>Chery,</HI>
when he came to the Mouth of the Vault, pull'd
the Bridle off his Hor&s;e's Head, and ty'd it to the
Saddle, and turn'd him loo&s;e; and then follow'd
the Turtle, who conducted him to the Fountain,
the falling of who&s;e Water made &s;uch a noi&s;e, as
would have deafen'd him, had not the Turtle given
him two of her white Feathers. He was &s;trangely
&s;urprized to &s;ee the Water dance with &s;o much
<PB N="141" REF="142">
Ju&s;tne&s;s to the Warblings of &s;ome Birds, who fly|ing
in the Air, formed a Band of Mu&s;ick. He
fill'd his Ve&s;&s;el of Gold, and pull'd two hearty
Draughts, which made him a thou&s;and times more
beautiful than he was before; and refre&s;h'd him
&s;o much, that he was able to bear the Heat of the
Fore&s;t. He return'd the &s;ame Way he came, and
finding his Hor&s;e again at the Cavern's Mouth,
mounted him again, and taking the Dove in his
Hand, &s;aid, &startq;Loving Turtle, I know not by what
Prodigy you have &s;o much Power here, what
you have done for me demands all my Gratitude;
and as Liberty is the greate&s;t of all Ble&s;&s;ings, I
give you yours, to &s;hew &s;ome token of my Good|will.&endq;
As he &s;aid the&s;e Words, he let her go:
She flew away with as &s;ullen an Air, as if he had
kept her again&s;t her Will. Upon which he &s;aid
to him&s;elf, &startq;How fickle art thou! thou ha&s;t more
of a Man than a Turtle in thee; the one is in|con&s;tant,
the other not.&endq; To this the Turtle,
mounted high in the Air, &s;aid, &startq;And do you
know who I am?&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Chery,</HI> amazed that the Turtle &s;hould an&s;wer
thus to his Thoughts, &s;u&s;pected her to be &s;omething
very extraordinary, and was &s;orry he had let her
fly, &s;aying to him&s;elf, that &s;he might be very u&s;e|ful
to him, and he might have learnt of her &s;everal
things, that might have contributed very much to
his Repo&s;e. But then again, he con&s;idered with
him&s;elf, that he ought never to regret a good
Action, and that he was indebted to her, when he
thought on the Difficulties &s;he had &s;mooth'd out
for him, to get the Dancing-Water. His golden
Ve&s;&s;el or Bottle, in which he put it, was &s;o clo&s;e
&s;topt up, he could not &s;pill one Drop, nor the Spi|rit
of the Water evaporate; &s;o that all the way, he
entertain'd him&s;elf with the Thoughts, how agree|ably
he &s;hould plea&s;e his <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> and the Joy &s;he
would re&s;ent, to &s;ee the Water and him again:
when pre&s;ently he &s;py'd &s;everal Men on hor&s;e-back,
<PB N="142" REF="143">
galloping at full &s;peed, who no &s;ooner perceiv'd
him, but they gave a Hollow, and pointed to him.
Though his intrepid Soul was &s;o void of Fear, as
not to be alarm'd at any Danger, yet was he vex'd
to think he &s;hould be &s;topt; he &s;purred on his
Hor&s;e, and made boldly towards them: But how
agreeable was his Surprize, to find them to be his
Dome&s;ticks, with a Letter from the Prince&s;s,
charging him not to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the Dangers
of the burning Fore&s;t! He ki&s;&s;ed the Writing, &s;igh'd
&s;everal times, and made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to ea&s;e her
other Fears.</P>
<P>When he came home, he found her &s;itting under
&s;ome Trees, abandon'd to her Grief; but when &s;he
&s;aw him at her feet, &s;he knew now what Reception
to give him; &s;he could both chide him, for going
contrary to her Orders, and thank'd him for his
Pre&s;ent: at la&s;t, her Tenderne&s;s prevailing, &s;he
embraced her dear Brother, and receiv'd him with
all po&s;&s;ible Demon&s;trations of Joy. The re&s;tle&s;s
<HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> knew by her Spies, that <HI>Chery</HI> was return$d,
and more beautiful than when he went, and that
the Prince&s;s, by wa&s;hing her Face with the Dancing-Water,
was become exce&s;&s;ive beautiful, that no bo|dy
could behold her without Admiration. She
was very much amazed and vex'd, for &s;he made
account that the Prince would peri&s;h in the At|tempt:
But recollecting, this was no time to de|&s;pond,
but &s;eeking an Opportunity, when the Prin|ce&s;s
went to the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> unaccompanied,
&s;he acco&s;ted her with an Air of Friend&s;hip, and
&s;aid, &startq;I congratulate you, Madam, on the happy
Succe&s;s of my Advice, your Looks di&s;cover too
plainly that you have u&s;ed the Dancing-Water:
but, if I dur&s;t advi&s;e you once more, you &s;hould
think of getting the Singing-Apple, which is as
great an Imbeli&s;hment to the Wit: would you
per&s;uade, it is but &s;melling; would you appear
in publick, make Ver&s;es, write Pro&s;e, make Peo|ple
to laugh or cry, it has all the&s;e Virtues; and
<PB N="143" REF="144">
be&s;ides, &s;igns &s;o fine, that it ravi&s;hes all that hear
it.&endq; &startq;I will have none of it, <HI>cry'd the Prince&s;s,</HI>
my Brother had like to have lo&s;t his Life, in
fetching the Dancing-Water, your Coun&s;el is too
dangerous.&endq; What! Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Feinti&s;a,
would you not be the mo&s;t learned and witty La|dy
in the World? Sure you don't think &s;o.&endq;
&startq;Alas! What would have become of me, if my
Brother had been brought back dead, or dying?&endq;
&startq;Then let him go no more, <HI>&s;aid the old Woman,</HI> let
the other two oblige you in their turns; this
Enterprize is not &s;o dangerous.&endq; &startq;No matter
for that, <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s,</HI> I will not expo&s;e them
to it.&endq; &startq;How much I pity you, <HI>reply'd</HI> Feinti&s;a,
to let &s;o advantageous an Opportunity &s;lip you,
but con&s;ider upon it: Farewel, Madam.&endq; And
then left her, very much un&s;atisfied with the Suc|ce&s;s
of her Harangue. <HI>Fair-Star</HI> &s;tay'd at the feet
of <HI>Diana</HI>'s Statue, irre&s;olute what to do: She loved
her Brothers, but &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired the Signing-Apple,
that &s;he &s;igh'd and fell a crying. <HI>Bright-Sun</HI>
coming into the Temple, and &s;eeing the Prin|ce&s;s's
Face covered with her Veil, becau&s;e &s;he was
a&s;hamed to be &s;een blear-ey'd; but he gue&s;&s;ing
&s;he was in Tears, and going up to her, conjured
her in&s;tantly to tell him why &s;he cry'd: But &s;he
refu&s;ed, telling him &s;he could not for &s;hame: and
the more &s;he deny'd, the more earne&s;t he was to
know. At la&s;t &s;he &s;aid, that the &s;ame old Woman
that advis'd her to &s;end for the Dancing-Water had
been telling her of the Singing-Apple, which was
more wonderful; becau&s;e it created as much Wit
as to make the Per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it a perfect Pro|digy,
and that &s;he would almo&s;t give her Life for
&s;uch an Apple, but that &s;he fear'd there was too
much Danger in going for it. &startq;You need not be
afraid of me, <HI>reply'd the Brother,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you, for
I am not &s;o fond as that comes to: What have you
not Wit enough already? Come, come, don't
vex your&s;elf about &s;uch a fooli&s;h Story.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> follow'd him from thence home, not a
little melancholy at the manner of his receiving
the Confidence &s;he repo&s;ed in him, and the Impo&s;|&s;ibility
of her having the Singing-Apple. When
Supper was &s;et upon the Table, &s;he could not eat;
<HI>Chery,</HI> the lovely <HI>Chery,</HI> ob&s;erved it, and helped her
to the nice&s;t Bits, pre&s;&s;ing her to ta&s;te thereof: but
all he could &s;ay proved u&s;ele&s;s, the Tears came in
her Eyes, and &s;he ro&s;e from the Table. O Hea|vens!
how unea&s;y was <HI>Chery,</HI> ignorant of what was
the Cau&s;e? when <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> told him, in a &s;ort of
Railery, di&s;obliging enough to his Si&s;ter, who was
&s;o much piqued thereat, that &s;he retired to her
Chamber, and would &s;ee nobody all that night.</P>
<P>When <HI>Bright-Sun</HI> and <HI>Felix</HI> were in bed, <HI>Chery</HI>
mounted his white Nag again, and without &s;aying
any thing to any one, &s;et out on his Journey for
the Singing-Apple, tho he knew not one foot of the
way, leaving a Letter behind him, to be given to
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> the next morning; who, when &s;he receiv'd
it, felt all the Di&s;quiet and Torments conceivable
upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. She ran into her Brothers
Chamber, to let them partake &s;omewhat of her
Grief; who pre&s;ently &s;ent after him again, to ob|lige
him to return, without attempting an Adven|ture
wherein there was &s;o much hazard. All this
time the King, who never had the&s;e four Strangers
out of his Thoughts, as often as he went a hunting,
call'd upon them, and reproach'd them for not
coming to his Court. They excu&s;ed them&s;elves,
fir&s;t, that they had not compleated their Equipage;
and then, that their Brother was ab&s;ent: a&s;&s;uring
him, that upon his Return, they, after the leave
he gave them, would pay their mo&s;t humble Re|&s;pects
to him.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Chery,</HI> who was too much urged on
by his Pa&s;&s;ion, not to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, &s;ome
time after Day-break, found a hand&s;ome young Man
&s;at under a &s;hady Tree, reading a Book he held
in his hand; to whom he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf in a
<PB N="145" REF="146">
civil manner, and &s;aid, &startq;Give me leave to inter|rupt
you, to ask if you know where I may find
the Singing-Apple.&endq; The young Man looking up
and &s;miling, ask'd him if he intended to obtain it.
&startq;Yes, <HI>reply'd the Prince,</HI> if it is po&s;&s;ible, I will.&endq;
&startq;Ah! Sir, <HI>added the Stranger,</HI> you know not all the
Dangers; here is a Book that &s;peaks of them, and
the very reading of it is enough to make one
tremble.&endq; &startq;No matter for that, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Chery, the
Danger is not capable of di&s;maying me; tell me
only where I may find it.&endq; &startq;This Book, <HI>continued
the Man,</HI> &s;ays in the De&s;arts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> that we
may hear it &s;ing eight Leagues off; and that the
Dragon, which guards it, has already devoured
above five hundred thou&s;and People.&endq; &startq;I &s;hall
make one more,&endq; <HI>&s;aid the Prince &s;miling:</HI> And then
taking his leave, &s;et forwards for the De&s;arts of
<HI>Lybia.</HI> After &s;everal days Journey, he li&s;ten'd if he
could hear the Apple, afflicting him&s;elf with the
length of the way; when perceiv$$$ in the Road
a Turtle almo&s;t dead, and &s;eeing no one nigh that
could have wounded it, he believed that it might
belong to <HI>Venus;</HI> and that having e&s;caped her Court,
the little Archer, to try his Bow and Arrows, had
let fly at her: and taking pity on it, lit off his
Hor&s;e, took it up, and wiping its bloody Feathers,
took out of his Pocket a little golden Box, of an
admirable Ointment, and no &s;ooner apply'd it to
the Wound of the poor Turtle, but it opened its
Eyes, rai&s;ed up its Head, &s;tretched out its Wings,
and then looking at the Prince, &s;aid, &startq;Good-mor|row,
<HI>Chery,</HI> you are de&s;tined to &s;ave my Life, and
I may perhaps do you no le&s;s &s;ignal Services.
You are come for the Singing-Apple, the Enter|prize
is difficult, and worthy of you; for it is
guarded by a terrible &s;caled Dragon, with three
Heads and twelve Feet.&endq; &startq;Ah! my dear Turtle,
<HI>&s;aid the Prince,</HI> how overjoy'd am I to &s;ee you a|gain,
and at a time when your A&s;&s;i&s;tance is &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary. Don't deny it me, my pretty Creature,
<PB N="146" REF="147">
for I &s;hould die with Grief, if I &s;hould return
without the Singing-Apple; and &s;ince that I got
the Dancing-Water by thy means, I hope you will
find out &s;ome Expedient, whereby I may &s;ucceed
as well in this Undertaking.&endq; &startq;Follow me, <HI>an|&s;wer'd
the Turtle,</HI> and I hope all will be well.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prince let her go, and after following her
all the day, arrived at a great Mountain of Sand,
into which the Turtle told him he mu&s;t dig;
which he accordingly did, &s;ometimes with his
Hand, and &s;ometimes with his Sword. After &s;ome
hours hard working, he found a Headpiece, Brea&s;t|plate,
and, in &s;hort, a compleat Suit of Armour for
Man and Hor&s;e, all of Gla&s;s. &startq;Arm your&s;elf, <HI>&s;aid the
Turtle,</HI> and fear not the Dragon; for when he &s;hall
&s;ee him&s;elf in all the&s;e Gla&s;&s;es, he will be &s;o fright|ned,
thinking his own Re&s;emblance, in &s;o many
Mirrors, to be as many &s;uch Mon&s;ters as him&s;elf,
that he will run away.&endq; <HI>Chery</HI> approving this
Contrivance, armed him&s;elf, and taking the Turtle
in his hand, they travelled all that night, and at
Day-break heard a mo&s;t ravi&s;hing Melody; and the
Prince asking what it was, the Turtle told him,
&s;he was per&s;uaded that nothing but the Singing-Ap|ple
could be &s;o agreeable, for that it perform'd all
Parts in Mu&s;ick, and &s;eem'd as if all manner of
In&s;truments were plaid upon, which made them
&s;till keep advancing towards it. The Prince wi&s;h'd
to him&s;elf, it might &s;ing &s;omething that might
be adapted to the Situation of his Heart; and at
that very in&s;tant heard the&s;e words:
<Q><L>'Tis Love can conquer the mo&s;t Rebel Heart,</L>
<L>Be amorous &s;till, and from her never part;</L>
<L>And &s;ince you follow Beauty's Cruelty,</L>
<L>Love on, pur&s;ue, and you will happy be.</L></Q></P>
<P>&startq;Ah! <HI>cry'd he, in an&s;wer to the&s;e Ver&s;es,</HI> how charm|ing
is this Prediction! I may hope then to be
more happy.&endq; To which the Turtle made no Re|ply,

for &s;he never &s;poke any thing but what was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The farther they advanced,
the more charming the Mu&s;ick &s;eem'd; and what|ever
Dread the Prince might be in, he was &s;ome|times
&s;o ravi&s;h'd, that he &s;topt, almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of
any thing el&s;e: but the &s;ight of the Dragon, who
appear'd &s;uddenly, &s;oon recover'd him out of this
kind of Lethargy. He had &s;melt the Prince a great
way off, and expected to devour him, as he had
done by all the re&s;t. He came jumping along, co|vering
the Ground as he came with a poi&s;onous
Froth. Out of his infernal Throat there i&s;&s;ued
Fire and little Dragons, which he u&s;ed in&s;tead of
Darts, to throw into the Eyes and Ears of all the
Knights-Errant that came to fetch away the Sing|ing-Apple.
But when he &s;aw his own terrible Fi|gure,
multiplied a thou&s;and times, in the Prince's
Gla&s;s Armour, he &s;topt; and looking hard upon
him, bearing &s;o many no le&s;s horrid Mon&s;ters than
him&s;elf about him, was frighten'd, and run away.
<HI>Chery</HI> perceiving the happy Succe&s;s of his Armour,
pur&s;ued him to the Mouth of a deep Cavern, which
he clo&s;ed up, to prevent his returning again. After
that, &s;earching about, he di&s;cover'd, with Admira|tion,
the beautiful Tree, which was all Amber, ex|cept
the Apples, which were Topazes; but that
which he &s;ought after with &s;o much pains, and
great danger, was a Ruby crown'd with a Diamond.
The Prince, tran&s;ported with the Joy of having it
in his power to be&s;tow &s;o great a Trea&s;ure on his
beloved <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> made ha&s;te to break off the
Bough; and proud of his Good-fortune, mounted
his Hor&s;e again, but &s;aw no more of the Turtle,
who, when there was no farther need of her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
was flown away. In &s;hort, the Prince returned
to his Prince&s;s with his Prize, who had never en|joy'd
one moment's Repo&s;e &s;ince his Ab&s;ence; &s;he
continually reproached her&s;elf for her Ambition
of Wit, dreading <HI>Chery</HI>'s Death far more than her
own: &startq;Ah unhappy Wretch that I am (<HI>would &s;he of|ten
<PB N="148" REF="149">
cry, fetching deep and heavy Sighs</HI>) why was I &s;o
vain-glorious? Why could not I be content to
&s;peak, and do things well enough not to be im|pertinent?
Well, I am puni&s;hed for my Pride,
if I lo&s;e him I &s;o dearly loved. Alas! Perhaps
the Gods, di&s;plea&s;ed with the irre&s;i&s;tle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ion I
have for <HI>Chery,</HI> will deprive me of him by &s;ome
tragical end.&endq; No afflicting tormenting Thought
e&s;caped her Imagination, when, in the middle of
the Night, &s;he heard &s;uch ravi&s;hing Mu&s;ick, that
&s;he could not lie in Bed, but got up, and went
to the Window to hear it more plainly, not know|ing
what to think of it: Sometimes &s;he believed it
to be <HI>Apollo</HI> and the Mu&s;es, &s;ometimes <HI>Venus,</HI> the
<HI>Graces,</HI> and <HI>Loves;</HI> and all the time the Symphony
&s;eemed to come nigher. At la&s;t, it being Moon|light,
&s;he di&s;covered the Prince; upon which &s;he
retired, &s;eeing a Gentleman, and not knowing
who it might be: when he &s;topt under her Win|dow,
and the <HI>Apple</HI> &s;ung an Air, the beginning of
which words were, or &s;omething like it, <HI>Awake,
you &s;leeping Fair.</HI></P>
<P>At this the curious Prince&s;s pre&s;ently looked out,
and knowing her Brother again, was ready to jump
out of the Window to him. She talked &s;o loud,
that the whole Family was pre&s;ently alarmed, and
came and opened the Doors; which <HI>Chery</HI> entered
with all imaginable ha&s;te, holding in his hand a
Branch of Amber, with the wonderful Fruit upon
it: and as he had &s;melt on it often, his Wit was
&s;o much increa&s;ed, that nothing was comparable
to it. <HI>Fair-Star</HI> ran to meet him with great preci|pitation,
crying with Joy, and &s;aying, &startq;Do you
believe I thank you, dear Brother? No, there's
nothing that I do not buy too dear, when I ex|po&s;e
you to fetch it.&endq; &startq;And there are no Dan|gers
I would not hazard, <HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> to give
you the lea&s;t Satisfaction. Accept, <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> of
this Fruit, none de&s;erves it &s;o much as you.&endq;
<HI>Bright-Sun,</HI> and his Brother, came ju&s;t then, and
<PB N="149" REF="150">
interrupted their Conver&s;ation, and were glad to
&s;ee their Brother again, who gave them an Ac|count
of his Journey, which la&s;ted till Morning.</P>
<P>The wicked <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> having left the Queen, af|ter
having acquainted her with her Projects, was
ju&s;t retired home, and got to Bed, but could not
&s;leep, thro her Unea&s;ine&s;s, one Wink. When &s;he
heard the &s;weet &s;inging of the <HI>Apple,</HI> and not
doubting but that he had obtained it, &s;he cried and
bewailed her Condition, &s;cratching her Face, and
tearing off her Hair. Her Grief was extremely
great; for in&s;tead of doing the Princes the mi&s;|chief
&s;he projected, &s;he did them all the Service
imaginable. As &s;oon as it was day, &s;he was too
well informed of the Prince's Return, and upon
that hurried away to the Queen-Mother: &startq;Well,
<HI>Feinti&s;a, &s;aid that Prince&s;s,</HI> do you bring me any
good News, are they de&s;troyed?&endq; &startq;No, Madam,
<HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> ca&s;ting her&s;elf at her feet: but let not
your Maje&s;ty be impatient; I have a thou&s;and
ways yet left.&endq; &startq;Ah Wretch! <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> thou
intende&s;t to betray me, and therefore &s;pare them?&endq;
<HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> prote&s;ted to the contrary, and when &s;he
had appea&s;ed her, returned home, to think of what
was to be done next. She let &s;ome days pa&s;s
without undertaking any thing: when being in|formed
by her Scouts, that the Prince&s;s was walk|ing
in the Fore&s;t alone, expecting her Brothers, &s;he
went thither; and addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to her, &s;aid,
&startq;Charming <HI>Star,</HI> I have been informed that you
have got the Singing-Apple, and was overjoyed to
hear of it; for I have &s;o great an Inclination
for you, that I am intere&s;ted in whatever tends
to your advantage. And, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> I can|not
forbear advi&s;ing you to one thing more.&endq; &startq;Ah,
<HI>cry'd the Prince&s;s, getting from her,</HI> keep your Ad|vice
to your&s;elf, for tho the Benefits I receive be
great, yet they make not amends for the Trouble
and Unea&s;ine&s;s they have cau&s;ed me.&endq; &startq;Unea&s;ine&s;s
is not &s;o great an Evil (<HI>an&s;wer'd &s;he with a Smile</HI>)
<PB N="150" REF="151">
there is a Sweetne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s &s;ometimes in
it.&endq; &startq;Forbear, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fair-Star, I tremble when I think
on it.&endq; &startq;Indeed, <HI>&s;aid the old Woman,</HI> you are very
much to be pitied, to be the mo&s;t beautiful and
wittie&s;t Lady in the World.&endq; &startq;I de&s;ire once
more, <HI>reply'd the Prince&s;s,</HI> to be excu&s;ed, I know
too well the Condition the Ab&s;ence of my Bro|ther
reduced me too.&endq; &startq;You mu&s;t notwith&s;tand|ing
be told, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Feinti&s;a, that you want the
little <HI>Green-Bird,</HI> that tells every thing, by which
you will be informed of your Birth, and your
good and ill Fortune, there's no particular thing
he does not di&s;cover; and when the World &s;hall
&s;ay, that <HI>Fair-Star</HI> has the Dancing-Water and the
Singing-Apple, and wants the little Green-Bird,
they had as good &s;ay nothing.&endq;</P>
<P>After having, in this manner, utter'd what &s;he
intended, &s;he retired, leaving the Prince&s;s melan|choly
and thoughtful, and &s;ighing, as if there was
&s;omething &s;he de&s;ired: &startq;This Woman is in the
right, <HI>&s;aid &s;he;</HI> what am I the better for the
Dancing-Water and Singing-Apple, if I know not
who I am, who are my Parents, and by what
Farality my Brothers and I were expo&s;ed to the
Fury of the Waves? There mu&s;t be &s;omething
extraordinary in our Births, that we &s;hould be
abandon'd in the manner we were, and receive
&s;o evident a Protection from Heaven. How great
a plea&s;ure would it be to me to know my Father
and Mother, to love them if they be alive, and
to honour their Memory if dead.&endq; Thereupon
Tears trickled down her Cheeks, clear as Drops of
Morning-Dew, di&s;tilling upon Lillies and Ro&s;es.
<HI>Chery,</HI> who was always more impatient to &s;ee her
again than the other two, made the mo&s;t ha&s;te, af|ter
the Sport was over, to return home: that day
he was a-foot, his Bow hung negligently by his
&s;ide, &s;ome Arrows he held in his hand, and his
Hair was tied with a Ribband behind him; and in
this warlike Dre&s;s he looked charmingly plea&s;ing.
<PB N="151" REF="152">
When the Prince&s;s &s;aw him, &s;he retired to a dark
&s;hady Walk, that he might not perceive tho&s;e Cha|racters
of Grief in her Face: but nothing can
e&s;cape a Lover's Eye; for the Prince looking upon
her, &s;oon knew &s;omething was the matter. Where|upon
he was di&s;turbed, and de&s;ired her to tell him
what it was; but &s;he refu&s;ing with Ob&s;tinacy, he
turn'd one of his Arrows again&s;t his Brea&s;t, and &s;aid,
&startq;Since you love me not, <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> I have nought
to do but die.&endq; By this means he (as I may &s;ay)
extorted the Secret from her; but on the&s;e Condi|tions,
that he &s;hould not with the hazard of his
Life &s;eck to &s;atisfy her De&s;ires: all which he pro|mi&s;ed.
But as &s;oon as &s;he was retired to her Cham|ber,
and her Brothers to theirs, he went into the
Stable again, and mounting his Hor&s;e, &s;et out with|out
&s;aying a word to any one. When it was known
the next Morning, the whole Family was in the
utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation. The King, who could not
forget, &s;ent to invite them again, and they return'd
the &s;ame Excu&s;e again of their Brother's being
ab&s;ent, and that they could have no Plea&s;ure and
Satisfaction without him; but that upon his return
they would not fail to pay their Devoirs. The Prin|ce&s;s
was incon&s;olable; the Water and Apple could
not charm her, nothing was agreeable without
<HI>Chery.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince wander'd up and down, asking all he
met where he might find the little Green-Bird; but
no body could tell him, till he lit on an old Man,
who taking him home with him, took the pains
to look over his Books and a Globe, which he
had made the Study of his Life; and then told
him it was in a frozen Climate, on the point of a
frightful Rock, &s;hewing him all the Roads to it.
The Prince, by way of return, pre&s;ented him with
a Pur&s;e of Jewels he had comb'd out of his Hair;
and taking leave of him, pur&s;ued his Journey. To
be &s;hort, one Morning by Sun-Ri&s;e, he perceiv'd
the Rock, which was very high and craggy, and
<PB N="152" REF="153">
on the top of it the Bird talking like an Oracle,
telling mo&s;t &s;trange things. He thought he might
catch it with little trouble, &s;ince it appear'd to be
very tame, hopping from one place to another.
He lit off of his Hor&s;e, and climb'd up without
making any noi&s;e, promi&s;ing him&s;elf and <HI>Fair-Star</HI>
the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure; when, all on a &s;udden,
the Rock open'd, and he fell, as motionle&s;s as any
Statue, into a large Hall; &s;o that he could neither
bemoan nor complain of his deplorable Adventure.
There he found three hundred Knights, who ha|ving
made the &s;ame Attempt as him&s;elf, were in
the &s;ame Condition, being only able to look at one
another.</P>
<P>The time of his Ab&s;ence &s;eem'd &s;o long to <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
that &s;he fell extraordinary ill; and the Phy&s;i|cians
pronounced her to be devour'd by deep Me|lancholy.
Her Brothers, who loved her tenderly,
would often tel$ her the cau&s;e of her Illne&s;s; upon
which &s;he confe&s;s'd, that &s;he reproach'd her&s;elf
Night and Day for <HI>Chery</HI>'s Departure; and that &s;he
was &s;ure &s;he &s;hould die if &s;he heard no News of
him. <HI>Bright-Sun,</HI> moved by her Tears, re&s;olved to
go and &s;eek his Brother; and accordingly, knowing
where the Bird was, &s;et out, approach'd it with
the &s;ame hopes, was &s;wallowed up by the Rock,
and fell into the great Hall, where the fir&s;t Ob|ject
he fix'd his eyes on was <HI>Chery;</HI> but could
not &s;peak to him. In the mean time <HI>Fair-Star</HI> grew
better, hoping every Minute to &s;ee her two Bro|thers
return; but being deceived therein, her Grief
renew'd, and &s;he complain'd ince&s;&s;antly, accu&s;ing
her&s;elf for the Di&s;a&s;ters that befel her Brothers:
when Prince <HI>Felix,</HI> having no le&s;s Compa&s;&s;ion on
her, and Concern for his Brothers, re&s;olved to go
and find them; and acquainted her therewith.
She at fir&s;t &s;eem'd to oppo&s;e it; but he reply'd, that
it was ju&s;t that he &s;hould expo&s;e him&s;elf for tho&s;e
who were &s;o dear to him; and then &s;et out, after
<PB N="153" REF="154">
taking his leave of the Prince&s;s, whom he left a
Prey to the mo&s;t piercing Grief.</P>
<P>When <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> knew that the third Prince was
gone, her Joy had no end, but away &s;he ran to
the Queen, and promi&s;ed her with more a&s;&s;urance
than ever, to de&s;troy this unfortunate Family. <HI>F$|lix</HI>
fared the &s;ame with <HI>Chery</HI> and <HI>Bright-Sun;</HI> he
found the Rock, &s;aw the Bird, and fell in the Hall,
where he knew the Princes he &s;ought, and &s;aw
them ranged in Niches. They never &s;lept, nor eat,
but remain'd in that &s;ad condition, having only
their Thoughts at liberty. <HI>Fair-Star</HI> &s;eeing none of
her Brothers return, was incon&s;olable, and reproach|ed
her&s;elf for &s;taying &s;o long after them; and with|out
any longer he&s;itation order'd their Servants
to &s;tay &s;ix Months; and if neither &s;he nor her
Brothers return'd in that time, to go and acquaint
the Cor&s;air and his Wife with their Deaths. Then
dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf in Men's Clothes, as mo&s;t fitting to
&s;ecure her from all In&s;ults in her Journey, <HI>F$inti&s;a</HI>
had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee her go upon her I&s;abella
Hor&s;e; and immediately after ran full of Joy to the
Palace to regale the Queen with the News. She
only arm'd her&s;elf with an Head-piece, the Vi&s;or
of which &s;he never lifted up, becau&s;e her Beauty
was &s;o perfect, &s;he would not otherwi&s;e have pa&s;t
for a Man. She &s;uffer'd very much by the Rigour
of the Weather; for that Country where the Green-Bird
lived, in no Sea&s;on ever received the happy
Influence of the Sun: but Cold, nor nothing could
di&s;may her. In her way &s;he &s;aw a Turtle no le&s;s
white nor cold than the Snow it lay upon, which,
notwith&s;tanding her Impatience of arriving at the
Rock, &s;he could not &s;ee peri&s;h; but lighting off
her Hor&s;e, took it up, warmed it with her Breath,
and put it into her Bo&s;om, where it never &s;tirr'd.
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> thinking it dead, pulled it out, and look|ing
&s;orrowfully upon it, &s;aid, &startq;What &s;hall I do,
lovely Turtle, to &s;ave thy Life?&endq; To which the
little Creature made an&s;wer, &startq;One &s;weet Ki&s;s, <HI>Fair-Star,</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="155">
from your Mouth, will fini&s;h what you
have &s;o charitably begun.&endq; &startq;Not only one, <HI>&s;aid
the Prince&s;s,</HI> but a thou&s;and if need be:&endq; and fell a
ki&s;&s;ing it. Upon which the Dove reviving, reply'd,
&startq;I know you, notwith&s;tanding your Di&s;gui&s;e, and
mu&s;t tell you, that you undertake a thing which
will be impo&s;&s;ible for you to effect without my
A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but do as I advi&s;e you. When you
come to the Rock, in&s;tead of attempting to climb
it, &s;tay at the bottom, and &s;ing the mo&s;t melodi|ous
Song you can think of; the Green-Bird will
hear you, and ob&s;erve from whence the Voice
comes; then you mu&s;t pretend to be a&s;leep, and
I will &s;tay by you: when he &s;ees me, he'll come
from the Rock to peck me, and then you mu&s;t
take your advantage and catch him.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s, overjoy'd at this Hope, arrived &s;oon
at the Rock, where &s;he found her Brothers Hor&s;es
grazing, which &s;ight renew'd all her Grief, and
&s;he &s;at down and cry'd bitterly; but the little
Green-Bird &s;aid &s;uch fine and comfortable things to
tho&s;e that were afflicted, that &s;he dried up her
Tears, and &s;ung &s;o loud and charming, that the
Princes in the Hall had the plea&s;ure of hearing her,
which was the fir&s;t Moment they began to hope.
The little Green-Bird heard her al&s;o, and look'd
to &s;ee from whence the Voice came, and percei|ving
the Prince&s;s, who had pulled off her Cask, that
&s;he might lie down to &s;leep with more ea&s;e, as al&s;o
the Turtle hopping by her; he came down to peck
her, but had not pull'd off three Feathers before he
was taken him&s;elf. &startq;Ah! <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> what would you
have with me? What have I done to engage you
to come &s;o far to make me mi&s;erable? Give me
my liberty, I conjure you, and I will do what|ever
you de&s;ire in exchange.&endq; &startq;Re&s;tore me my
Brothers, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Fair-Star, whom by their Hor|&s;es
feeding here, I know thou detaine&s;t &s;ome|where
hereabouts.&endq; &startq;I have a red Feather, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> under my left Wing, pull it out, and touch
<PB N="155" REF="156">
the Rock with it.&endq; The Prince&s;s made ha&s;te to
do what he had bid her, but at the &s;ame time &s;aw
&s;uch Fla&s;hes of Lightning, and heard &s;uch Claps of
Thunder, together with the roaring of the Wind,
that &s;he was very much frighten'd; but notwith|&s;tanding
held the Green-Bird fa&s;t, that he might not
e&s;cape her: then touch'd the Rock again a &s;econd
and third time, at which la&s;t it &s;plit from the Top
to the Bottom, and &s;he with an Air of Victory en|ter'd
the Hall, where the three were with a great
many others. She ran to <HI>Chery,</HI> who knew her not
in that Dre&s;s, and in a Helmet; for then the En|chantment
was not de&s;troy'd, in&s;omuch that he
could neither &s;peak nor &s;tir. The Prince&s;s &s;eeing
that, asked the Bird more Que&s;tions, to which he
made an&s;wer, that &s;he mu&s;t rub the Eyes of all
tho&s;e &s;he would free from the Enchantment, with
the &s;ame red Feather; which good Office &s;he did
to &s;everal Kings and Princes, as well as her three
Brothers: who, in return for &s;o great a Benefit, fell
down on their Knees, and call'd her the Deliverer
of Kings.</P>
<P><HI>Fair-Star</HI> then perceiving that her Brothers, de|ceived
by her Dre&s;s, did not know her, pull'd off
her Helmet, and holding out her Arms, embraced
them a thou&s;and times, if po&s;&s;ible, and afterwards
ask'd the other Princes civilly who they were;
every one told his own particular Adventure, and
offer'd to accompany her wherever &s;he went: to
which &s;he an&s;wer'd, That tho the Laws of Knight|hood
might give her &s;ome Right over their Liber|ty,
&s;he waved it, leaving them to pur&s;ue their own
Plea&s;ures; and then retired with her Brothers, that
they might give each other a particular account of
what had befel them &s;ince their Separation. The
little Green-Bird often interrupted them, to de&s;ire
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> to give him his Liberty; upon which &s;he
look'd for the Dove to ask her opinion: but not
finding her, told the Bird he had co&s;t her too much
Trouble and Unea&s;ine&s;s to enjoy &s;o little of her
<PB N="159" REF="157">
Conque&s;t. Thereupon they all four mounted their
own Hor&s;es, leaving the other Kings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to go
a-foot, their Equipage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being all lo&s;t and dead,
during the many Years of their Enchantment.</P>
<P>The Queen-Mother, ea&s;ed of all the Di&s;quiet
with which the Return of the Princes and Prince&s;s
had burden'd her, renewed her In&s;tances to the
King to marry again; and importun'd him &s;o much,
that he made choice of a Prince&s;s, one of his Rela|tions.
But as he mu&s;t fir&s;t di&s;annul his Marriage
with the Queen <HI>Blondina,</HI> who had lived all that
time at her Mother's with the three Whelps; the
old Queen &s;ent a Coach for her and them. She
came according to her Commands, and was dre&s;s'd
in black, with a long Veil that reach'd down to her
Feet; in which Apparel &s;he appear'd as beautiful as
the Morning-Star: tho &s;he was become lean and
pale by not &s;leeping nor eating but ju&s;t to &s;u&s;tain
Nature, and out of Complai&s;ance to her Mother,
who was pitied by all. The King relented &s;o much,
that he dur&s;t not ca&s;t his eyes on her; for he con|&s;ented
to this &s;econd Match purely out of the hopes
of Heirs. The Marriage-Day being appointed, the
old Queen, urged thereto by <HI>Rou&s;etta,</HI> who always
hated her unfortunate Si&s;ter, would have the Queen
<HI>Blondina</HI> appear at the Fea&s;t, which was to be very
magnificent: and the King to &s;hew his Grandeur
to Strangers, &s;ent the fir&s;t Gentleman of his Bed-Chamber
to the Princes and their Si&s;ter, to invite
them to it.</P>
<P>The Gentleman went accordingly, and knowing
the extreme De&s;ire the King had to &s;ee them, find|ing
them not at home, left one of his Attendants
to wait for them, and to bring them without any
delay. The Night before this Banquet, <HI>Fair-Star</HI>
and the three Princes arrived, to whom the Per&s;on
that was left deliver'd his Me&s;&s;age, telling them
withal the Hi&s;tory of the King's Life; how that he
had married a young beautiful Dam&s;el, who had
the Misfortune to be deliver'd of three Whelps;
<PB N="157" REF="158">
and that upon that account he had put her away,
tho he loved her tenderly: that he had lived fifteen
Years before he would hearken to any Propo&s;als of
Marriage; but being pre&s;s'd thereto by the Queen-Mother
and his Mini&s;ters of State, he had deter|mined
to e&s;pou&s;e a young Prince&s;s of his Court, to
who&s;e Nuptials they were invited.</P>
<P><HI>Fair-Star</HI> dre&s;s'd her&s;elf in a Ro&s;e-colour'd Velvet,
bedeck'd on the Robings with Diamonds&punc; her Hair
hanging on her Shoulders in fine Curls, but tied
together with a Bunch of Ribbons, by which means
the Gold-Chain on her Neck appear'd more vi&s;ible;
the Star on her Forehead &s;hined with all imagina|ble
Lu&s;tre; and in &s;hort, &s;he &s;eem'd too beautiful
for a Mortal. Her Brothers came not far &s;hort of
her; and Prince <HI>Chery</HI> had &s;omething that di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
him mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly. They went all
four into an Ivory and Ebony Chariot, drawn by
twelve white Hor&s;es, their Equipage every way
&s;uitable. The King, overjoy'd to &s;ee them, recei|ved
them at the Stair-head; the Apple &s;ung won|derfully
fine, the Water danced, and the Green-Bird
talk'd like an Oracle. They all fell on their
Knees, till the King rai&s;ed them up with his Hand,
which they ki&s;s'd with all Re&s;pect and Affection.
After that he embraced them, and &s;aid, &startq;I am
obliged to you, lovely Strangers, for your Com|pany
to-day; your Pre&s;ence gives me a &s;en&s;ible
Plea&s;ure.&endq; Then he led them into a large Hall,
where there were &s;everal Tables &s;et out with all
manner of Rarities and Dainties, and Mu&s;ick play|ing
all the time. Soon after came the Queen-Mo|ther
with her new Daughter-in-law that was to be,
accompanied by <HI>Rou&s;etta,</HI> and a great number of
Ladies, and with them the poor Queen led by a
Bra&s;s-Chain about her Neck, to which the three
Dogs were fa&s;ten'd; who, together with them, was
carried to a great Bowl of Bones and Offal-Meat,
that was &s;et out by the old Queen's Command in
one part of the Hall.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">
When <HI>Fair-Star</HI> and the Princes &s;aw this unhap|py
Prince&s;s, Tears came in their Eyes; either be|cau&s;e
they were &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the Vici&s;&s;i|tudes
and Changes of this World, or by In&s;tinct of
Nature. But how outrageous were the old Queen's
Thoughts at &s;o unexpected a Return, &s;o contrary to
her De&s;igns? She ca&s;t &s;o furious a Look at <HI>Fein|ti&s;a,</HI>
that &s;he wi&s;h'd the Earth would open, and
&s;wallow her up; &s;o much did &s;he dread her. The
King pre&s;ented the Prince&s;s and her Brothers to
his Mother, &s;aying the mo&s;t obliging things of them;
and &s;he, notwith&s;tanding her inward Hatred and
Concern, receiv'd them with a favourable Compli|ment,
and a Smile; for at that time Di&s;&s;imulation
was as much in vogue as now. No Mirth was
wanting during the Fea&s;t, tho the King was not
very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee his Wife eat with Dogs, as
the meane&s;t of all Creatures; but having re&s;olved
to &s;hew all manner of Complai&s;ance to his Mother,
&s;he order'd every thing as &s;he thought fit.</P>
<P>When the Repa&s;t was over, the King addre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf to <HI>Fair-Star,</HI> &s;aid, &startq;I hear you are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
of three incomparable Things, I wi&s;h you joy of
them, and de&s;ire you to tell me how you got
them.&endq; &startq;Sir, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> I &s;hall obey you with
plea&s;ure. I was told that the Dancing-Water
would make me hand&s;ome, and the Singing-Apple
in&s;pire tho&s;e who had it with Wit; which were
the two Rea&s;ons made me de&s;irous of them. For
the little Green-Bird, who tells every thing, our
ignorance of our fatal Births made me cove$ him,
&s;ince we were Children aba$don'd by our Parents.&endq;
&startq;To judge of your Birth by your Per&s;ons, <HI>reply'd
the King,</HI> it mu&s;t be illu&s;trious; but tell me &s;in|cerely
who you are.&endq; &startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> my Brothers
and &s;elf deferr'd that Enquiry till our Return,
and then we receiv'd the Honour of an Invitation
to your Wedding, and have brought the&s;e Rari|ties
to divert you.&endq; &startq;I am very glad of it, <HI>&s;aid the
King,</HI> therefore let us not defer &s;o agreeable an
<PB N="159" REF="160">
Entertainment.&endq; &startq;What, <HI>&s;aid the Queen-Mother, in
a Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> can you amu&s;e your&s;elf no better than
with &s;uch idle Stories, and &s;uch &s;illy Chits and
their Rarities; I am &s;orry your Credulity &s;hould
be &s;o much abu&s;ed, and that they &s;hould have
the Honour to &s;it at my Table.&endq; <HI>Fair-Star</HI> and her
Brothers knew not how to behave them&s;elves at
this di&s;obliging Expre&s;&s;ion, but were confu&s;ed and
vex'd to be affronted before &s;o much Company:
but the King telling his Mother that this Proceed|ing
of hers very much di&s;plea&s;ed him, de&s;ir'd them
to take no notice of it, and held out his Hand as a
Sign of his Friend&s;hip. <HI>Fair-Star</HI> call'd for a Gla&s;s-Ba&s;on,
and pouring the Dancing-Water into it;
which, by its skipping and jumping, &s;ometimes
forming Waves like a rolling Sea, and &s;ometimes
changing its Colour, fill'd all the Company with
Admiration, by its forcing the Ba&s;on along the
Table to the King, ca&s;t out &s;ome Drops into the
fir&s;t Gentleman of the King's Bed-Chamber's Face;
who being a Man of good Mein, but of a di&s;agree|able
Face, (tho' a Man of Merit) having but one
Eye, the Water made him very beautiful, and re|&s;tored
his Eye again. The King, who&s;e Favourite
he was, &s;eem'd as much plea&s;ed with this Adven|ture,
as the Queen-Mother was vex'd to hear the
Applau&s;es of the whole Company. After that <HI>Fair-Star</HI>
produced the Ruby Apple upon its Branch of
Amber, which began as melodious a Concert, as if
there had been a hundred Mu&s;icians; which ra|vi&s;hed
the Sen&s;es of the King and whole Court,
who&s;e Admiration increa&s;ed when &s;he &s;hew'd the
little Green-Bird in a golden Cage, out of which &s;he
took him gently, and &s;et him upon the Apple, which
out of Re&s;pect left off &s;inging, to give him time to
&s;peak: his Feathers were &s;o bright, that when the
Eyes were &s;hut, they gli&s;ten'd, and were of all man|ner
of Shades of Green He addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the
King, and ask'd him what he plea&s;ed to know.
&startq;We want to be inform'd, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> who
<PB N="160" REF="161">
this Lady and three Gentlemen are.&endq; &startq;O King,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the Bird, with a plain and intelligible Voice,</HI>
&s;he is thy own Daughter, and two of the&s;e Prin|ces
are thy Sons; the third, who&s;e Name is <HI>Chery,</HI>
is thy Nephew.&endq; Thereupon, with an unparal|lell'd
Eloquence, he told the whole Story, without
omitting the ea&s;t Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The King melted into Tears, and the afflicted
Queen leaving her Dogs, came &s;oftly forwards, cry|ing
for Joy; for &s;he no longer di&s;puted the Truth
of the Story, when &s;he &s;aw all the Tokens. The
three Princes ro&s;e up at the end thereof, ca&s;t them|&s;elves
at the King's feet, embraced his Knees, and
ki&s;&s;ed his $and: He, with open Arms, clapt them
to his Heart; and, at that time, there was nothing
heard, but Sighs and Cries of Joy. When at la&s;t,
the King &s;eeing his Queen &s;tanding fearful by the
Wall-&s;ide in an humble Po&s;ture, ran to her, and
embraced her a thou&s;and times: then took her by
the hand, and made her &s;it down by him; but not
before her Children and &s;he had embraced as
often. Never was Sight more tender and moving
they were all in Tears, lifting up their Hands and
Eyes to Heaven to return thanks. The King made
the Prince&s;s he was to marry a Compliment, and
withal, a Pre&s;ent of Jewels. But for the Queen-Mother,
<HI>Rou&s;etta,</HI> and <HI>Feinti&s;a,</HI> they could expect
nothing but the utmo&s;t Re&s;entment. The Thunder
of his Anger began to grumble, when the generous
Queen, her Children, and <HI>Chery,</HI> conjured him not
to put him&s;elf into a Pa&s;&s;ion, but to pa&s;s a more
exemplary than &s;evere Sentence. The Queen-Mo|ther
he made a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner for Life in a &s;trong
Ca&s;tle, and <HI>Rou&s;etta</HI> and <HI>Feinti&s;a</HI> were ca&s;t into a
deep na&s;ty Dungeon, there to remain all their days
with the three Dogs.</P>
<P>After the&s;e three wicked Per&s;ons were carried
away, the Mu&s;ick began to play, and all Joy and
Mirth went forward; but none came up to that of
<HI>Chery</HI>'s and <HI>Fair-Star</HI>'s, who were as happy at they
<PB N="161" REF="162">
wi&s;h'd to be; for the King, &s;en&s;ible of his Nephew's
Merit, compleated the Happine&s;s of that Day, by
marrying him to his Daughter. The Prince, tran&s;|ported
with Joy, ca&s;t him&s;elf at his feet; and
<HI>Fair-Star</HI> di&s;cover'd no le&s;s Satisfaction. But, not
to forget the old Prince&s;s, who had in a kind of
Solitude &s;pent &s;o many Years, but to let her par|take
of the Joy, the &s;ame Fairy that had been &s;o
entertain'd by her, at the &s;ame moment, went and
told her all that happen'd at Court, and asked her
to go with her thither. The grateful Prince&s;s
went with her in her Chariot of blue and gold,
preceded by all manner of warlike In&s;truments,
and follow'd by five hundred Body-Guards, richly
cloth'd; and by the way, the Fairy told her the
Hi&s;tory of her Grand-Children, how &s;he had never
for&s;aken them, but had protected them under the
Shape of a Syren and a Turtle, and all upon the
account of the charitable Reception &s;he gave her.
The good Prince&s;s was every moment for ki&s;&s;ing
her Hand, to &s;hew her Acknowledgment, and
could not think of Expre&s;&s;ions to declare her Joy.
When they arriv'd at Court, the King receiv'd
them with a thou&s;and Te&s;timonies of Friend&s;hip.
The Queen <HI>Blondina,</HI> and her Children, were glad
to &s;ee the Prince&s;s, and earne&s;t to expre&s;s the
Gratitude and Obligations to that illu&s;trious Lady,
whom the old Prince&s;s told them was the kind
Turtle that guided them; who, to compleat the
King's Satisfaction, told him, that his Mother-in-law,
whom he always took for a poor Country
Woman, was a Sovereign Prince&s;s: which was the
only thing perhaps wanting to that Monarch's
Happine&s;s. And to conclude, the Cor&s;air and his
Wife were &s;ent for, that they might receive a no|ble
Recompence, for the extraordinary Education
they be&s;tow'd on them.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of the New
Gentleman-Citizen.</HEAD>
<P>THE Story of the Prince&s;s <HI>Fair-Star</HI> filled <HI>Dan|dinardiere</HI>
with &s;o much Admiration, that,
with his good-will, he would have &s;pent the
whole Evening in commending it; and in the Ex|ce&s;s
of his Raptures, taking <HI>Virginia</HI> by the Hand,
pulled her &s;o rudely to him, that, not being pre|pared,
&s;he fell upon the Vi&s;count, and he upon
the Ground. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> &s;eem'd amazed at this
Di&s;order; he accus'd his Stars a thou&s;and times,
in the mo&s;t lofty Expre&s;&s;ions, for per&s;ecuting him
in this manner, telling the Company, that he ne|ver
thought of &s;ucceeding &s;o ill in a piece of Gal|lantry,
into which his Admiration had engag'd him.
&startq;It is a very odd way of plea&s;ing, <HI>&s;aid the young
H$roine,</HI> to pull one &s;o rudely by the Arm, to lame
me for &s;ome days.&endq; &startq;Neither have I, Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Dandinardiere, &s;aid the Vi&s;count,</HI> been much better
u&s;ed; and what vexes me mo&s;t, is, that in my
fall, my Peruke fell off; and as I give my&s;elf,
as much as I am able, all the Airs of a young
Man, I am very much at a nonplus to ju&s;tify my
grey Hairs, before the&s;e Ladies.&endq; &startq;I &s;ee by Mon|&s;ieur

I have the Sentiments of an <HI>Alexander,</HI> and meet
with the Rigour of an <HI>Alexandretta, &s;aid he,</HI> (with
an abundance of Joy, thinking he had made u&s;e of a
mo&s;t delicate and uncommon Expre&s;&s;ion, and won|dred
that no body applauded it, looking upon the
Company with &s;uch an Air of Merit, that the Gen|tlemen
could &s;carce contain from laughing.) When
<HI>Mari$onida,</HI> who was always mo&s;t liberal of her
Prai&s;es, forbore &s;ome time, but at la&s;t cry'd out,
upon the Finene&s;s of the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Alexan|dretta,</HI>
and on the Beauties it included; which
were hid from, and unknown to the Vulgar. Then
<HI>Virginia</HI> taking upon her the Di&s;cour&s;e, told him
he had a &s;uperiour Wit, and was capable of po|li&s;hing
the whole World, of bani&s;hing all Ob|&s;curities,
and to give the la&s;t Perfection to Lan|guage;

Extravagances: for the&s;e Ladies had an inexhau&s;tible

<P><HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> charm'd and confounded together,
clapped his armed Hands together, and was for an|&s;wering
all together; in&s;omuch, that he knew not

and crow'd like a young Child, or drunken

Cabbage into the Pot; and I think I may u&s;e

<P>By this time, Supper came up, and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI>

&startq;Alas! Sir, <HI>reply'd</HI> Alain, you beat me almo&s;t every

I am &s;ure is the more honourable Profe&s;&s;ion,

<P>While he was loading, in a low Voice, the pru|dent

kept knocking at the Door, which made the inra|ged
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who could not bear the thoughts

finding neither Shoes nor Slippers, and fearing to

laughing, who fail'd not to ply well the Tongs,
the whole Family was alarm'd. The Vi&s;count and

He could &s;ay no more, for ju&s;t then <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
pinch'd &s;o hard, that he turn'd pale and &s;peechle&s;s.
<PB N="167" REF="168">
The Vi&s;count and Prior could not forbear laughing
at this new manner of fighting; but as it was then
time to pacify the inraged Spirits of both &s;ides,
they de&s;ired <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> to make a Truce, let go
the Tongs, and open the Door. For Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> as
&s;oon as he found him&s;elf at liberty, he ran away,
prote&s;ting again&s;t &s;o bad a Pay-ma&s;ter, and re&s;olving
to &s;ue him all his Life.</P>
<P>The Cit, who never had the plea&s;ure of making
his Enemy quit the Field before, grew &s;o proud
upon it, that without reflecting on the Irregularity
of his Dre&s;s, which was only a Shirt and Boots, he
&s;trutted about the Room with the Tongs on his
&s;houlder, like another <HI>Hercules</HI> with his Club. &startq;You
are in a very great Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>&s;aid the Prior;</HI> are not
you afraid it &s;hould make you wor&s;e?&endq; &startq;I fear
nothing, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> not Death it&s;elf in its mo&s;t
terrible Shapes.&endq; &startq;This pa&s;t Action of yours, <HI>&s;aid
the Vi&s;count with a &s;erious Face,</HI> &s;hews your Intrepi|dity;
but for all that, I think you ought to pay
this poor Fellow, who has nothing to live on but
his Bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq; &startq;He is a Rogue, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere,
who ought to pay me for the Mi&s;chief he has
done? I &s;hould have been well without him; the
Villain would have cut my Skin like a piece of
Paper.&endq; &startq;A little Genero&s;ity, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI> will
make things ea&s;y; he is ignorant as well as a
great many others, but that is not his fault per|haps:
but I would advi&s;e you as a Friend, not to
be &s;o ob&s;tinate as to refu&s;e him &s;ome Pi&s;toles.&endq;
&startq;Now you are upon your banter, Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Prior,
&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, I came not directly from <HI>Pa|ris</HI>
to be made a Fool of in the Country: this is
not the fir&s;t difference I have had in my life, and
I have always come off with flying Colours.&endq; &startq;In|deed
I believe it, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain, <HI>braving it al&s;o,</HI> my
Ma&s;ter's a dreadful Man; and I as his Servant
partake &s;omewhat of his Nature.&endq; &startq;Hone&s;t Friend
<HI>Alain, &s;aid the Vi&s;count,</HI> don't be &s;o imprudent; for
what will be the con&s;equence of a Proce&s;s where|in
<PB N="168" REF="169">
in your Name &s;hall be put down?&endq; &startq;Why, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> I &s;aw nothing; it was all done through the
Hole of the Door; nay, I did not &s;o much as
reach my Ma&s;ter the Tongs: Well, let him bring
his Proce&s;s, and &s;ee if I cannot defend it; I have
an Uncle a Lawyer, and may get Law as cheap
as he.&endq; &startq;Courage, my Boy, <HI>&s;aid the Vi&s;count laugh|ing,</HI>
here's the <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Bartholus</HI> of our time
united again&s;t Mr. <HI>Robert:</HI> for my part I am a
lover of Peace; I'll go and dre&s;s my&s;elf to fetch
the Olive-Branch.&endq; &startq;And I, <HI>&s;aid the Cit,</HI> will get to
bed again, for this Knave has di&s;turbed me too
&s;oon.&endq; And then they all parted.</P>
<P>Never was Joy greater than <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s, to
think of the Exploit he had perform'd; he talk'd a
long time to his Man about it, telling him, that
when he ever undertook to cha&s;ti&s;e any one, he
did it to &s;ome purpo&s;e. Upon which, <HI>Alain,</HI> who
had never before &s;een him do any thing more than
him&s;elf, began to look upon him with more Re|&s;pect.
&startq;I mu&s;t own, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you have made
amends for the Dread you have always had of
<HI>Villeville,</HI> and I doubt not but you will now fight
him.&endq; &startq;O, that's an old Quarrel, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinar|diere,
that you do well to remind me of; I am
per&s;uaded that Spark has thought better on it,
than to be &s;o void of Sen&s;e as to mea&s;ure Swords
with me.&endq; &startq;But at a venture, Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain,
would you if he would?&endq; &startq;I know not, <HI>&s;aid</HI>
Dandinardiere, <HI>&s;haking his Head two or three times,</HI> it
is not that I want Courage, for I have enough of
that: but when I think of the Adventure that
befel me by the Sea-&s;ide, and of that Demon &s;o
like a Man, as never were two Drops of Water
more like one another, and who brought me that
villainous Challenge, which has made me fret
ever &s;ince; I mu&s;t &s;incerely confe&s;s, <HI>Alain,</HI> that
I had rather you &s;hould fight him than my&s;elf.&endq;
&startq;But I am not &s;uch a Fool, <HI>reply'd</HI> Alain: What!
you would deliver me into the Lion's Mouth that
<PB N="169" REF="170">
this Devil, if he is one, &s;hould carry me ready
dre&s;t, and in my Shoes and Stockings, into the
other World. Indeed, Sir, though I have not &s;o
much Money as your&s;elf, my Life's as &s;weet to
me as yours; for it is not Money altogether that
can make us happy; we mu&s;t have Health, or
one had as good be dead: Now if I fight with
this Magician, and he &s;hould put out my Eyes,
cut my Wind-pipe, or run me through the Heart,
do you believe in your con&s;cience that I &s;hould
be very well after it?&endq; &startq;How do you know,
Coward, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere <HI>in a Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> that
<HI>Villeville</HI> would &s;erve you &s;o?&endq; &startq;O, it is very ea&s;y
to be believ'd, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain, for Devils have more
Power than Fairies; and if you remember the
Story that was told ye&s;terday, they could make
Apples &s;ing like Nightingales, Birds to talk as well
as Doctors, and Water to dance as well as the
be&s;t Ma&s;ters. After all this, have not I rea&s;on to
be afraid?&endq; &startq;You are a &s;trange Fellow, <HI>&s;aid his
Ma&s;ter,</HI> to torment your&s;elf and me as you do;
for there's now no talk of <HI>Villeville:</HI> therefore let
me ta&s;te the plea&s;ure of my Victory, and go to
&s;leep, thou Di&s;turber of my Repo&s;e.&endq; <HI>Alain</HI> drew
the Curtains, wi&s;h'd his Ma&s;ter a good Nap, and
afterwards went to the Window which look'd into
the great Road, where he pa&s;s'd away an Hour in
killing the Flies, he being their declared Enemy;
when <HI>V$lleville</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by, and looking up acciden|tally,
&s;aw him; and knowing that his very Name
&s;truck a terrour both into <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> and his
Man, and thinking this Adventure might be plea|&s;ant
enough, held up a Pi&s;tol to him, as if he would
kill him. &startq;Ah! <HI>cry'd</HI> Alain <HI>holding up his Hands,</HI> be
plea&s;ed not to mi&s;take me; remember the Strokes
you gave me &s;ome time &s;ince, which I &s;wear I
have never bore you any Malice for.&endq; <HI>Villeville</HI>
returning no an&s;wer, but remaining in the &s;ame
po&s;ture, and <HI>Alain</HI>'s Fears increa&s;ing the more, he
&s;aid, &startq;I &s;ee you have a mind to kill &s;ome-body,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
&s;tay a moment, I would rather it &s;hould be my
Ma&s;ter than my&s;elf; I'll go and awake him, tho
I know he will be very &s;orry.&endq; Hereupon he ran,
and pull'd <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> by the Arm; &startq;Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
be plea&s;ed to ri&s;e, here's one at the Window that
wants to &s;ee you.&endq; At which he getting up, and
putting on his Night-Gown and Boots, went to the
Window; but O Heavens! what a &s;ight was there,
<HI>Villeville</HI> with a Pi&s;tol in his hand! He never &s;taid,
like his Man, to make a fine Compliment, but ran
directly under the Bed, which nothing but his Fear
could have made him &s;ucceed in, for the Bed was very
low; but a Pi&s;tol ready cock'd was a terrible thing,
He had not lain there long, but he found it very
heavy, and thought nothing could be more dange|rous
than the Condition he was in, and therefore
at all hazards re&s;olved to get back again; but all
his Endeavours were in vain, the Bed was &s;o low,
that he was cru&s;h'd under it: he cry'd out, &startq;<HI>Alain,</HI>
help me, or I &s;hall die.&endq; But that faithful Ser|vant
never heard him, having hid him&s;elf be|hind
a Cupboard, which he u&s;ed to lie in;
and having rai&s;ed it up, held it with both his
hands, as the only thing in the World to &s;ecure
him.</P>
<P><HI>V$lleville</HI> &s;eeing neither Ma&s;ter nor Man appear,
fired twice, which put <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> into &s;uch a
Fright, that he could not &s;peak a long time after|wards.
<HI>Alain</HI> threw down the Cupboard, which
he had taken &s;o much pains to hold up, and falling
with his Head foremo&s;t, but not very hard, becau&s;e
it was upon the Bed, tumbled to the other end of
the Room. Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>de St. Thomas, Berg$nville,</HI> and
the Prior were in the Hall, which was under <HI>Dan|dinardiere</HI>'s
Room, con&s;ulting about him; and it
would be hard if the great noi&s;e that was made
&s;hould have e&s;caped their Ears. They thought it
was either Thunder, or that Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> return'd,
to take revenge for being &s;o rudely pinch'd; and
made ha&s;te to be Spectators of &s;ome new S$ene.
<PB N="171" REF="172">
When they enter'd the Room, they found <HI>Alain</HI>
&s;tretch'd out at length upon the ground, and going
to his Ma&s;ter's Bed, heard a plaintive Sound, but
could not imagine from whence it came. They
ask'd <HI>Alain</HI> &s;everal times where he was, but he put|ting
his Finger to his Mouth, to denote Silence,
pointed to the Window, which they looked out at,
not knowing whether he was &s;o great a Fool as to
break his Neck. In &s;hort, they could not under|&s;tand
<HI>Alain</HI> by his my&s;terious Signs: &s;till the &s;ame
melancholy Accents continued, and our Hero &s;uf|fer'd
all the time; when the Baron looking under
the Bed, to his no &s;mall Amazement, &s;aw his
Legs. <HI>Alain</HI> taking heart at their Pre&s;ence, came
to help them, and catching hold of one of the
Boots, into which his Ma&s;ter's Leg was not &s;o hard
wedged, as his Body was under the Bed, and pul|ling
with all his &s;trength, it &s;lipt off, and he fell
backward on his Breech. &startq;Very well, very well,
<HI>&s;aid he in a plea&s;ant manner, tho u$heard by the G$n|tlemen,
who were too bu&s;y with his Ma&s;ter,</HI> the Fairies
have endow'd me with a Fit of tumbling to-day;
but to remedy it, I will ri&s;e no more.&endq; Fir&s;t,
they pull'd by one Leg, and &s;ometimes by both,
to get him out of this Trap; but as all this time
his Shoulders and Back had but a bad time on't,
they bethought them&s;elves of throwing off the Bed
and Bed-clothes, to give the more liberty, and by
that means got him out, with his Face and No&s;e
&s;cratch'd, and as red as Scarlet, and $aid him upon
the Bed, ordering his Valet to go for &s;ome Wine,
and <HI>Hungary</HI>-Water, to rub his Tempies. &startq;I de&s;ire
you, Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain <HI>to the Vi&s;$$$a,</HI> to take the pains
to go your&s;elf; for, to hide nothing from you,
that terrible Mon&s;ter, <HI>V$llev$l$e,</HI> is &s;omewhere a|bout
the Hou&s;e, and I dread the &s;ight of him more
than Thunder.&endq; &startq;Hold your tongue, you fooli&s;h
Babbler, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere; who told you that
<HI>Villeville</HI> came and fired two Pi&s;tols at my Win|dow,
and frighten'd me!&endq; &startq;I never &s;aid a word
<PB N="172" REF="173">
of it, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Alain; but now you have di&s;cover'd
all.&endq; &startq;Don't believe him, <HI>&s;aid our Cit,</HI> I &s;hould
not be afraid of <HI>H$rcules,</HI> and much le&s;s of him;
but my Ra&s;eal of a Valet has &s;ometimes &s;uch
&s;trong Vi&s;ions, that he believes them to be true.
But to let you know how I came to be where
you found me, I dreamt that I, getting out of
bed to fight, and having put my Enemy to flight,
he run under it, and in the height of my Rage,
and heat of Pa&s;&s;ion, I pur&s;ued him; but when I
was there, I awaked, vexed at my&s;elf, but not
much &s;urprized, being u&s;ed to &s;uch like Fancies
in my Sleep: for the Court has known for the&s;e
many Years, that I have gone often a &s;wimming
in my Sleep.&endq;</P>
<P>While he was talking after this manner, <HI>Alain</HI>
made &s;igns to the contrary; but Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Th$|mas,</HI>
who &s;trove to oblige him, reply'd, that what
he &s;aid was all true; becau&s;e he knew <HI>Villeville</HI> to
be &s;omewhat di&s;order'd in his Brain: for that if he
was well, he would not be &s;o much an Enemy to
him&s;elf, to &s;eek to lo&s;e his Life with a Man more
dangerous than either <HI>Mars</HI> or <HI>Hercules.</HI> The Vi&s;|count
and Prior &s;aid &s;omething to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e,
which made <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> thinking that they
believed him, re&s;ume his former Good-humour, and
di&s;po&s;e him&s;elf to advance &s;ome more Lyes; but
tho&s;e Gentlemen thought fit to leave him, to drink
his <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine, and u&s;e his <HI>Hungary</HI>-Water.</P>
<P>When they were at liberty to talk among them|&s;elves,
the Baron <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to
the Vi&s;count, &s;aid, &startq;I think you almo&s;t as mad as
the Cit him&s;elf, to propo&s;e him for my Son-in-law.&endq;
&startq;You may &s;ay what you plea&s;e, <HI>an&s;wer'd he.</HI> but I
maintain my Vi&s;ion is not ridiculous; and if there's
any thing embara&s;&s;ing, it is not the Opportunities,
for we all know there are enough, but how to
make this covetous Wretch marry a Lady of Qua|lity
for her fine Eyes.&endq; &startq;Did you ob&s;erve ye|&s;terday,
<HI>interrupted the Prior,</HI> his Preten&s;ions to a

Fortune? If we are not very &s;ly and cunning,
this Match will be knock'd on the head.&endq; &startq;It is

be very &s;orry.&endq; &startq;I can a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>continued the
Vi&s;count,</HI> he is very rich, and with his bragging
Impertinencies, which all tend to the Pre&s;erva|tion
of him&s;elf, he is not to be bit out of his Mo|ney:
it was I that &s;et Mr. <HI>Robert</HI> upon him.&endq; &startq;I

Thomas, but I m$&s;t leave the Management of this
Affair to you.&endq; Some Per&s;ons coming in upon
them, broke off this Conver&s;ation; and the Prior
being inform'd that <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> could not &s;leep,
went to bear him company.</P>
<P>When he came to his Chamber-door, he &s;topt,
becau&s;e he heard him talking with <HI>Alain.</HI> &startq;What,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> do you think I can forgive &s;uch an Af|front?&endq;
&startq;How &s;hould I know it would di&s;oblige

Truth of what I &s;aw; any one, as well as I,
would have &s;aid the &s;ame: I &s;aw you under the
Bed, and know you had good rea&s;on to be there.&endq;
&startq;You knew! <HI>reply'd his Ma&s;ter,</HI> who could tell you?&endq;
&startq;My own Heart, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain, which is Fle&s;h and
Bone as well as yours, which was ready to die
away for fear; for had it not been for the Cup|board,
which I crept behind, certainly I had not
been alive this moment.&endq; &startq;I think you very bold,
<HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere, to judge of my Sentiments
by your own; Heroes never mea&s;ure by the Bu&s;hel
of &s;uch a Ra&s;cal as thou art: if I did run under
the Bed, it was becau&s;e I would not receive the
Shot of a Traitor, who dur&s;t not attack me, but
at a di&s;tance.&endq; &startq;You have forgot then, <HI>reply'd</HI> A|lain,

Cannon; for I know not which it was.&endq; &startq;Hold thy

to be more brave than my Ma&s;ter? Had you
hired me to fight, I would not have promi&s;ed
without performing, and you &s;hould have had no
rea&s;on to complain; but there was not a word

more for you, I will give you a good Heart.&endq;
'Then blowing into his Ears, &s;aid, &startq;There's a Pro|vi&s;ion

Alain. &startq;Yes, I'll warrant it,&endq; <HI>&s;aid the Ma&s;ter.</HI>
&startq;Then, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I thank you; but if you would
plea&s;e to blow me a hundred Crowns, I &s;hould

will make me more courageous.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prior finding that this Conver&s;ation would
not &s;oon have an end, after having laughed heartily
to him&s;elf, went into the Room. &startq;I believed you

The Cit &s;eem'd no ways to reli&s;h this: &startq;Ha, ha!
<HI>&s;aid he, after &s;ome time thinking,</HI> one ought to have
&s;omething be&s;ides, to enter into a Contract of

&s;ome of them, <HI>&s;aid the Prior;</HI> you believe, with|out

but I declare there's more Contrivance and Art
in them, tho I &s;ee &s;everal every day that have
nothing agreeable in them.&endq; &startq;That's as much as
to &s;ay, <HI>reply'd</HI> Dandinardiere, that mine will be

<PB N="176" REF="177">
him, &startq;The pains they require almo&s;t di&s;mays me,
and my Genius tends not much to Writings of
this kind; therefore &s;hall I be &s;o happy as to
have the honour of another Story from you, that
I may let <HI>Virginia</HI> know I have as good a Talent
this way as &s;he her&s;elf.&endq; &startq;That's as much as to
&s;ay, <HI>reply'd the Prior,</HI> you would give her a <HI>Rowland</HI>
for her <HI>Oliver,</HI> and have as much Preten&s;ion to
the Empire of the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI>&endq; &startq;My Ambition's
no le&s;s, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Dandinardiere, therefore be my
Friend this time, I conjure you.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prior having promi&s;ed him what he de&s;ired,
took his leave of him, and going into the Hall,
found there two Ladies of his Acquaintance, who
coming to pay Madam <HI>St. Thomas</HI> a Vi&s;it, their
Coach broke down with them, and obliged them
to walk a great way on foot, broiling in the Sun.
The&s;e Ladies call'd Cou&s;ins, tho they were not at
all related: the one was a Widow, and a great
Coquet; and the other had lately married an old
Gentleman, who had ama&s;&s;ed together great Riches,
and who might brag he had married a Woman that
knew how to &s;pend as fa&s;t. The older of the two,
who was Madam <HI>R$uet,</HI> was the Widow of a very
hone&s;t Gentleman; but &s;he was a Woman that
loved Play and Junketings, was very expen&s;ive in
Clothes, and painted extravagantly: all which con|&s;umed
a great part of his E&s;tate. That day the
Sun had melted it half off, and &s;he was looking
in the Gla&s;s to lay on White where it wanted, and
rub off the Red that had run down, when the Prior
came in, which vexed her not a little, for he was
the fir&s;t who made his Appearance. Mon&s;ieur <HI>St.
Thomas</HI> being abroad among his Workmen, and
Madam adju&s;ting her&s;elf, when Madam <HI>de Lure,</HI>
who was the new-married Lady, &s;eeing her &s;o bu&s;y,
to give her the more liberty to form her Com|plexion,
took the Prior on one &s;ide, telling him,
that while her Cou&s;in was &s;etting her Head-dre&s;s,
&s;he would &s;how him a Story, with which he would
<PB N="177" REF="178">
certainly be in love. To which he reply'd, that
if it was long, they &s;hould not be able to make an
end of it before dinner. &startq;O! <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I intend
only to read the Name of it to you, and I am &s;ure
you will be de&s;irous to hear it: it is the Story
of the Prince&s;s <HI>Carpillona:</HI> What &s;ay you to it?&endq;
&startq;I am &s;o much a Stranger, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> to the&s;e &s;ort
of Works, that I cannot judge of them by their
Titles.&endq; Upon which, &s;he banter'd him, till
ca&s;ting her Eyes upon her Cou&s;in <HI>Rouet,</HI> and &s;ee|ing
&s;he had done, &s;he took no farther notice of t$e
Story. By this time, the Baron was inform'd of
their Arrival; who came pre&s;ently to them, ac|companied
by the Vi&s;count <HI>Berginville:</HI> and not
knowing how to divert them till dinner-time, af|ter
having &s;aluted them, and been inform'd by
them of the Accident that befell them, he pro|pos'd
walking in a little Wood, where there were
&s;o ne pretty Fi&s;hponds, &s;haded by the Trees, un|der
which were rai&s;ed plea&s;ant Banks, enamell'd
with Flowers and Camomile; which was cooler,
and more refre&s;hing than the Hall. As &s;oon as
they were &s;at down, the Prior knowing Dinner
would be &s;omewhat late, to amu&s;e them till then,
begg'd the Favour of Madam <HI>de Lure,</HI> to regale
the Company with her Story: which &s;he pulling
out of her Pocket, de&s;ired him to read.</P>

<HEAD>The Story of the Prince&s;s Carpillona.</HEAD>
<P>THERE lived &s;ome Ages ago, an old King,
who, to make amends for a long Widow|hood,
marry'd a young beautiful Prince&s;s, with
whom he was very much in love. By his fir&s;t
Wife he had one Son, who was both crooked and
&s;quint-ey'd, and who was very much di&s;plea&s;ed at
<PB N="178" REF="179">
his Father's marrying a &s;econd time. &startq;My being
my Father's only Son, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> makes me both
loved and feared; but if the young Queen has
Children, my Father, who can di&s;po&s;e of his
Crown as he plea&s;es, will not con&s;ider that I
am his elde&s;t Son, but will di&s;inherit me for
them.&endq; He was not only ambitious and malicious,
but a great Di&s;&s;embler; in&s;omuch, that he &s;hewed
not the lea&s;t Unea&s;ine&s;s, but went privately to
con&s;ult a Fairy, who pa&s;&s;ed then for one of the
mo&s;t able. The Fairy told him he was come too late,
that the Queen was with Child of a Son, to which
&s;he would do no harm; but if he died, or any ill
Accident befell him, &s;he promi&s;ed the Queen
&s;hould have no more: Which comforted the Prince
a little, who, conjuring the Fairy not to forget
him, return'd home, re&s;olving with him&s;elf, to make
away with his little Brother.</P>
<P>At nine Months end, the Queen was delivered
of a lovely Boy, in whom there was &s;omething
very remarkable, he having an Arrow imprinted on
his Arm. The Queen was &s;o fond of her Child,
that &s;he would nur&s;e it her&s;elf, which was no way
plea&s;ing to the crooked Prince, the Mother's Care
being always beyond any Nur&s;e's, and it being
not &s;o ea&s;y for him to accompli&s;h his De&s;igns. Ne|verthele&s;s,
he re&s;olv'd to make an Attempt. He
&s;hew'd a great Value and Re&s;pect for the Queen,
and a Tenderne&s;s towards the Infant, of which
the King was very fond: &startq;I could not have
thought, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my Son &s;o good-natur'd; he &s;hall
lo&s;e nothing by it: for if he continues to be &s;o,
I'll leave half my Kingdom to him.&endq; The&s;e Pro|mi&s;es
were not enough for the Prince, he was re|&s;olv'd
to have all or none; and to that end, one
Night pre&s;ented &s;ome Comfits made up with Opium,
to the Queen, who &s;oon after fell into a &s;ound
Sleep; and then the Prince, who had hid him&s;elf
behind the Hangings, took the Child away &s;oftly,
and put in its &s;tead, a Cat wrapt up in Swaddling-Clothes.
<PB N="179" REF="180">
The Cat cry'd, and waken'd the Queen;
who being drow&s;y, and thinking it her little Pop|pet,
gave it her Brea&s;t; which the Cat bit: where|upon
looking, and &s;eeing the Cat's Head, &s;he
&s;hriek'd out. Her Grief was &s;o lively, that &s;he
thought &s;he &s;hould have died away that mo|ment.
The Noi&s;e and Skreamings of the Women
alarm'd the whole Court. The King put on his
Nightgown, and ran into her Apartment; where
the fir&s;t thing he beheld, was the Cat in the
Swaddling-Clothes, thrown on the ground, and
mewing. The King was very much &s;urprized, and
asked what that meant; they told him, the young
Prince was not to be found, and that the Queen
was hurt. Thereupon, he went immediatly into
her Chamber; where he found her in Affliction,
not to be expre&s;&s;ed: the which, that he might not
augment by his own Sorrow, he con&s;train'd him|&s;elf,
to comfort that poor Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the crook'd-back Prince had
given his little Brother to one of his Creatures,
bidding him carry him to &s;ome di&s;tant Fore&s;t, and
expo&s;e him naked to the wild Bea&s;ts, that he
might be heard no more of, promi&s;ing to reward
him well, and then return'd to his own Apartment;
from whence he ran into the Queen's, rubbing his
Eyes, as if he was a&s;leep: where, when he was
inform'd of what had happen'd, he &s;tampt and
roar'd like a mad Man, and, out of his natural
$i$rcene&s;s, twi&s;ted the Ca$'s Head off; and in this
manner, di&s;gui&s;ed the Crime he was &s;o deeply
g$ilty of, &s;hedding many Tears. The King and
Queen, who thought too well of him, &s;ent him
to all the Fairies, to learn what was become of
their Child; and he, to put a &s;top to any further
Enquiries, return'd with &s;everal different and in|tr$$ate
An&s;wers; which all &s;eem'd to a&s;&s;ure them,
that the Child was not dead, but was, for to me
Rea&s;ons not to be known, only taken away for a
time, and that all their &s;earching any more after
<PB N="180" REF="181">
him would be to no purpo&s;e. This he thought
would make them ea&s;y, and indeed it had its ef|fect;
for the King and Queen both flattered them|&s;elves
with the Hopes of &s;eeing their Son again.
Notwith&s;tanding, the Queen's Brea&s;t gangreen'd, and
&s;he died: Upon which, the King became &s;o afflict|ed
and &s;orowful, that he &s;aw no Light for a Twelve-month,
living only in expectation of hearing &s;ome
news of his lo&s;t Child.</P>
<P>The Man whom the Prince delivered him to,
travelled all night with him, without making the
lea&s;t halt; and in the morning, when he open'd
the Basket, in which he carried him, this pret|ty
Infant &s;miled, as he was u&s;ed to do at his Mo|ther.
&startq;O! poor Prince, <HI>&s;aid the Man,</HI> how un|happy
is thy Fate, to &s;erve, alas! for Food to
&s;ome hungry Lion? Why did the Prince, thy
Brother, make choice of me, to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to
thy De&s;truction?&endq; Then he &s;hut the Basket a|gain,
that he might not behold an Object &s;o wor|thy
his Pity; but upon the Child's crying, who
had not had the Brea&s;t all night, to quiet it, he
gathered &s;ome Figs, and put into its Mouth, and
&s;o carried it all that day: and the Night following,
arriv'd at a va&s;t Fore&s;t, which he would not enter
then, for fear of being devour'd him&s;elf, but &s;tay'd
till the Morning; when advancing in the Fore&s;t,
which was &s;o large, he could &s;ee no end, he per|ceiv'd
a place where the Trees &s;tood very thick,
and a Rock in the mid&s;t of them, that branched
out into &s;everal Points. &startq;This Place, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> mu&s;t
certainly be a Retreat to the wild Bea&s;ts; here
I mu&s;t leave the Child, &s;ince it is not in my
power to &s;ave it.&endq; Then approaching towards the
Rock, he &s;aw a large Eagle flying about, as if &s;he
had young ones; and looking farther, found her
Ne&s;t in the bottom of a kind of Grotto: thereupon,
undre&s;&s;ing the Child, he laid it in the mid&s;t of
three young Eagles in the Ne&s;t, which was well &s;hel|ter'd
from the Weather, and difficult and hazar|dous
<PB N="181" REF="182">
to get to, by rea&s;on of the Briars it was &s;ur|rounded
by, and its being &s;o nigh a Precipice.
Then leaving this young Prince, and &s;eeing the
Eagle fly to her Ne&s;t, he, &s;ighing, &s;aid, &startq;Alas!
poor Infant, thy Fate is accompli&s;h'd, thou &s;erve&s;t
that Bird of Prey to feed her Young with.&endq; And
afterwards return'd to his Ma&s;ter, and a&s;&s;ured him
his Brother was no more. For which News, the
barbarous Prince embraced his faithful Agent, and
pre&s;ented him with a fine Diamond Ring, a&s;&s;uring
him, he &s;hould be Captain of his Guards, when he
was King.</P>
<P>But to return to the Eagle: When &s;he came to
her Ne&s;t, &s;he was &s;omewhat &s;urprized to find this
new Gue&s;t there; however, &s;he exerci&s;ed the
Rights of Ho&s;pitality, more than &s;ome People would
do: &s;he put him next her Ne&s;tling, cover'd him
with her Wings, took care of him, and whatever
engaged her in his favour, went and provided the
mo&s;t nouri&s;hing Fruits, which &s;he &s;queez'd with
her Bill into his Mouth: and, in &s;hort, made him
an excellent Nur&s;e. When the young Eagles were
fledg'd, they left their Ne&s;t &s;olely to the Prince, who
neverthele&s;s was not abandon'd by the old one,
which fed him &s;till with the choice&s;t Fruits; and,
by &s;ome fore-&s;ight, fearing, le&s;t he getting out,
&s;hould fall down the Precipice, remov'd him to a|nother
Place, which was upon an high Rock,
where he was mo&s;t &s;ecure. Love, who is always
painted mo&s;t beautiful, was not more perfect than
this young Prince; the Heats of the Sun could
not prejudice his Complexion, which exceeded the
Lillies and Ro&s;es; his Features were more regular
than the be&s;t Painters could imagine, his Hair
reach'd down to his Shoulders, his Mein was Ma|je&s;tick:
in &s;hort, nothing could be more noble.
But the Eagle having young-ones again, &s;he made
&s;uch havock among all the neighbouring Flocks,
that the Shepherds, lo&s;ing every now and then a
Lamb, re&s;olv'd to di&s;cover her Ne&s;t: And to that
<PB N="182" REF="183">
end, agreed to watch her; which they did for
a long time: when one day, they ob&s;erved, &s;he
lit upon this Rock, which the mo&s;t hardy of them
re&s;olv'd to climb; though the Attempt was very
dangerous. yet it an&s;wer'd their Expectation.
They di&s;covered the Ne&s;t, and found in it, two
young Eagles, and this young Prince; who was
about four Years old. Their Amazement at the
&s;ight of him is inexpre&s;&s;ible; and they could not
tell what to imagine at &s;uch an extraordinary
thing. However, they tore the Ne&s;t in pieces, and
carried away the young Prince and the two Eagles.
The Eagle hearing their Cries, ca$$e furiou&s;ly to|wards
them, and had made the&s;e Ravi&s;hers feel
the Effects of her Re&s;entment, had not one of the
Shepherds kill'd her with an Arrow he let fly at
her. The young Prince &s;eeing his Nur&s;e fall,
cry'd and wept bitterly: And the Shepherds, o|verjoy'd
with what they had done, return'd to
their Hamlet; where they were to perform, the
next day, a cruel Ceremony: the Cau&s;e of which,
was as follows.</P>
<P>This Country had &s;erved a long time for a Retreat
of the <HI>Ogr$</HI> (who were a larger &s;ort of Men, and
great Eaters of human Fle&s;h) and not liking &s;uch
dangerous Neighbours, had endeavour'd, but
with ill Succe&s;s, to drive them away. The <HI>Ogri,</HI>
inraged at the Hatred they bore them, redoubled
their Cruel$$es, and devour'd all that came to their
hands. When one day as the Shepherds were a&s;|&s;embled
together, to deliberate on what they &s;hould
do; there appear'd in the mid&s;t of them a Man of
a prodigious &s;ize, the lower part of who&s;e Body
was like a Goat, cover'd with a blue Shag; on his
Shoulder he carried a great Club, and on his Left-Arm
a Buckler. &startq;Shepherds, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I am the blue
Centaur; if you will give me every three years
a Child, I promi&s;e to bring an hundred of my
Brothers, and drive the <HI>Ogri</HI> away.&endq; The Shep|herds
made &s;ome difficulty to engage them&s;elves in
<PB N="183" REF="184">
&s;o cruel an Agreement; till the elder of them
&s;aid, &startq;What, my Friends, is it not better for us to
give one to pre&s;erve &s;o many, &s;ince the <HI>Ogri</HI> nei|ther
&s;pare Men, Women, nor Children; therefore
let us not refu&s;e the Centaur's Offer.&endq; They all
by this Argument con&s;ented, and &s;wore the Cen|taur
&s;hould have a Child every third Year. After
that he went away, and return'd, as he promi&s;ed,
with his Brothers, who were all as mon&s;trous as
him&s;elf. The <HI>Ogri</HI> were no le&s;s brave than cruel;
they fought &s;everal Battles with great Ob&s;tinacy,
wherein the Centaurs were always victorious, who
forced them at la&s;t to fly. The blue Centaur de|manded
his Recompence, which every one allow'd
to be ju&s;t; but when they came to deliver up the
promi&s;ed Infant, there was no Family could think
of parting with one of theirs, and the Mothers hid
all their Children. The Centaur, who could not
bear to be je&s;ted with, after having waited twice
four and twenty hours, told the Shepherds, that
he expected as many Children as they made him
wait Days; in&s;omuch, that their Delays co&s;t them
&s;ix Boys, and as many Girls: but &s;ince that time
they have regulated this Affair, and every third
Year make a &s;olemn Fe&s;tival, to deliver their pro|mi&s;ed
Infant to the Centaur.</P>
<P>It happen'd that the day whereon the Prince was
found, was the day before this Tribute was to be
paid; and tho there was a Child provided, it mu&s;t
ea&s;ily be thought that the Shepherds would deliver
this Prince in its &s;tead. The Mother of the other,
freed by this means from all the Horrors &s;he mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily lie under in apprehen&s;ions of the death
of her Child, was tran&s;ported with Joy. And as
&s;he was obliged to dre&s;s him, &s;he comb'd his fine
Locks, put him on a Garland of white and red
Ro&s;es, wrapt him up in a fine white Cloth, which
&s;he girt about him with Flowers. Thus adju&s;ted,
he walked at the head of a great many Children
that were to attend him; but I may &s;ay, it was
<PB N="184" REF="185">
with an Air of &s;o much Grandeur and State, as
&s;eem'd, as if all the Shepherds made this Proce&s;&s;ion
only to divert him, &s;o little was his Dread; which
drew Tears from many, who &s;aid, it was pity that
beautiful Child &s;hould go to be devour'd, and wi&s;h|ed
it was in their power to &s;ave him: but that
was impo&s;&s;ible. The Centaur was u&s;ed to appear
on the top of a Rock, with his Club in one hand,
and his Buckler in the other, and with a terrible
voice to cry out to the Shepherds, &startq;Leave me my
Prey, and retire.&endq; This time, as &s;oon as he per|ceiv'd
the Child, he roar'd our in a dreadful voice,
&startq;'This will be the be&s;t Meal I have ever made in
my Life; this Boy will be a delicious Mor&s;el.&endq;
Which made the Shepherds and Shepherde&s;&s;es weep,
and &s;ay, &startq;How unhappy is this Child to have e&s;ca|ped
(which was a Prodigy) the Eagle's Talons,
to be Food for this cruel Mon&s;ter!&endq; And among
the re&s;t an old Shepherd. taking him in his Arms,
ki&s;s'd him often, and &s;aid, &startq;Tho I know thee not,
dear Babe, I am &s;en&s;ible I have &s;een too much
of thee for my repo&s;e. Why mu&s;t I be a&s;&s;i&s;ting at
thy Funeral? And why was Fortune &s;o cruel to
pre&s;erve thee for this horrible End?&endq; While he
was moi&s;tening this Prince's ro&s;y Cheeks with
his Tears, this innocent Babe put his Hands into
his grey Hairs, and &s;miling upon him, in&s;pired him
with more pity, that he &s;eem'd loth to advance.
Whereupon the hungry Giant cry'd out, &startq;Make
ha&s;te; if you make me come down, I &s;hall devour
an hundred of you.&endq; And indeed was &s;o impa|tient,
that he ro&s;e up, and made a flouri&s;h with his
Club; when, all on a &s;udden, there appear'd in
the Air a great Globe of Fire, incircled with a blue
Cloud. Every body was attentive to &s;uch an ex|traordinary
&s;ight; the Globe and Cloud approach'd
them by degrees, and when nigh the Earth open'd,
and there came out a Chariot of Diamonds, drawn
by &s;ix Swans, in which &s;at a beautiful Lady dre&s;s'd
like an <HI>Amazon,</HI> with an Helmet on her Head of
<PB N="185" REF="186">
pure Gold, on which was a Plume of white Fea|thers;
and her Vi&s;or, which was rai&s;ed up, di&s;co|ver'd
Eyes as bright as the Sun; her Body was
arm'd with a rich Cuira&s;s, and in her Hand &s;he
held a Spear of Fire. &startq;What, Shepherds, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI>
are you &s;o inhuman to give this lovely Babe to
that cruel Centaur? It is now time to free you
from your Promi&s;e; Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on both op|po&s;e
&s;uch barbarous Cu&s;toms: fear not the return
of the <HI>Ogri;</HI> I will &s;ecure you; I am the Fairy <HI>Ama|zona,</HI>
and from this moment will take you under
my Protection.&endq; &startq;Ah! Madam, <HI>cry'd the Shepherds
and Shepherde&s;&s;es, holding up their Hands,</HI> this is the
greate&s;t Happine&s;s that can befall us.&endq; And were
&s;aying a great deal more, when the furious Centaur
defy'd her to the Combat, in which he was burnt
to death by the fire of her Spear, and fell with as
much noi&s;e as if a Mountain had been overturn'd;
that the Shepherds frighten'd therewith, hid them|&s;elves
in Caves that were under the Rocks, from
whence they could &s;ee all that pa&s;t.</P>
<P>It was thither the wi&s;e Shepherd fled with the
little Prince in his Arms, as much concern'd for
the Child as him&s;elf and Family. After the death
of the Centaur, the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> took a Trumpet,
and &s;ounded &s;o melodiou&s;ly with it, that the &s;ick
Per&s;ons who heard it, recover'd their former Health;
and tho&s;e who were well, conceived a &s;ecret Joy
which they could not expre&s;s. At la&s;t, when all
the Shepherds and Shepherde&s;&s;es were a&s;&s;embled
together at the &s;ound of the harmonious Trumpet,
the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> advanced towards them in her
Diamond Chariot, rolling within three yards of the
ground, on a Cloud as clear as Chry&s;tal. The old
Shepherd, who&s;e Name was <HI>Sublimus,</HI> appear'd with
the little Prince clinging about his Neck: &startq;Come
forwards, <HI>Sublimus, &s;aid the Fairy,</HI> fear nothing;
Peace &s;hall reign here for the future, and you
&s;hall enjoy the Repo&s;e you have &s;ought &s;o much
after; but give me that Child who&s;e Adventures
<PB N="186" REF="187">
are &s;o extraordinary.&endq; The old Man, after making
a low bow, held out his Arms, and put the Prince
in hers; who, when &s;he had him, care&s;s'd and em|braced
him a thou&s;and times, &s;etting him on her
Knees, and talking to him: who, tho he under|&s;tood
no Language, yet by Accents and Sighs he
could expre&s;s Joy and Grief; for he had never
heard any Per&s;on &s;peak before. He was &s;o dazled
with the Fairy's bright Arms, that getting upon his
Knees to examine it from the Head-piece down|wards,
and to touch it; the Fairy &s;miled and &s;aid,
tho he could not under&s;tand her, &startq;When, my Boy,
you are fit to wear &s;uch Armour, you &s;hall not
want.&endq; And then returning him back to the
Shepherd, after having ki&s;s'd him tenderly, &startq;Wi&s;e
old Man, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> you are no Stranger to me,
vouch&s;afe to take care of this Child; learn him
to de&s;pi&s;e the Grandeur of the World, and be
above the Strokes of adver&s;e Fortune, tho he
may be born to a &s;plendid one: but I hold it bet|ter
to be wi&s;e than powerful. The Happine&s;s of
Men ought not to con&s;i&s;t in outward Greatne&s;s,
but in Wi&s;dom, and the greate&s;t is to know our|&s;elves,
to limit our De&s;ires, to be as well conten|ted
with a moderate Competency, as with the
greate&s;t Riches; to &s;earch after the E&s;t$em of
People of Merit, to de&s;pi&s;e none, and be always
ready to quit this mi&s;erable Life without regret.
But what am I thinking of, venerable Shepherd?
I am telling you things which you know as well
as my&s;elf; but then I mention them not &s;o much
for your&s;elf, as for the other Shepherds. Fare|well,
Shepherds, call me when you want me;
this &s;ame Spear, and this &s;ame Hand, which put
an end to the Life of the blue Centaur, &s;hall
always be ready to protect you.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Sublimus,</HI> and tho&s;e who were with him, were
&s;o confounded, and at the &s;ame time overjoy'd, that
they could return no an&s;wer to the obliging Words
of the Fairy; but pro&s;trated them&s;elves before her,
<PB N="187" REF="188">
while the Globe of Fire, ri&s;ing by degrees, a&s;cen|ded
to the middle Region of the Air, and was &s;een
no more. The fearful Shepherds at fir&s;t dur&s;t not
approach the Centaur, tho dead; till reflecting bet|ter
on it, they at la&s;t re&s;olved to rai&s;e a funeral
Pile to reduce him to A&s;hes, le&s;t his Brothers
might be inform'd of what had happen'd, and &s;hould
come to revenge his death.</P>
<P><HI>Sublimus</HI> carried the little Prince to his Hut; his
Wife being &s;ick, his two Daughters had not been
able to leave her to attend the Ceremony. &startq;Here,
Shepherde&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> here's a Child beloved by
the Gods, and protected by the Fairy <HI>Amazona;</HI>
we mu&s;t look upon him, for the time to come, as
our own, and give him an Education that may
make him happy.&endq; 'The Wife was plea&s;ed with
the Pre&s;ent, and taking the Prince upon the Bed,
&s;aid. &startq;I will bring him up, and cheri&s;h him in his
Infancy, but mu&s;t leave the part of his Education
to your&s;elf.&endq; The Shepherd told her that was all
he de&s;ired, and &s;o left him with her. The two
Daughters ran pre&s;ently to &s;ee their new Brother,
were charm'd with his incomparable Beauty, and
the Graces that adorn'd his little Body; and from
that moment began to learn him to talk. Never
was Wit more exten&s;ive and lively; he compre|hended
every thing with an Ea&s;e that amazed all
the Shepherds, and in a &s;hort time was fit to take
Le&s;&s;ons of the old Shepherd him&s;e$f, who was ca|pable
of giving him whatever was excellent. He
had been King of a flouri&s;hing Nation, but by the
Intrigues of his Mini&s;ters with an U&s;urper, his
Neighbour and Enemy, had been &s;urprized with
all his Family, and made a Pri&s;oner in a &s;trong
Fortre&s;s, there to end his days in Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>So &s;udden and unexpected a Change was not able
to &s;hock the Virtue of the King and Queen in the
lea&s;t; they bore all the Outrages of the Tyrant
with an unparallell'd Con&s;tancy and Firmne&s;s of
Mind. The Queen, who was big with Child when
<PB N="188" REF="189">
the&s;e Misfortunes came upon them, was brought to
bed of a Daughter, which &s;he was obliged to nur&s;e
her&s;elf, as well as take care of her two others,
who partook as much of their Troubles as their
Age would admit. The King after three Years
Confinement, gain'd one of his Guards, who pro|mi&s;ed
to bring him a Boat under the Window of
the Room he was impri&s;on'd in, to cro&s;s the Lake,
which this Fortre&s;s &s;tood in the mid&s;t of; and pro|vided
him Files to cut the Iron-Bars with, and
Cords to let them&s;elves down by. They made
choice of a dark Night, and did all without any
noi&s;e; and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this Soldier, &s;lid
down by the Rope The King went fir&s;t, then the
two Children, after them the Queen, and after her
the little Babe in a Basket: but alas! the Knot
whereby it was fa&s;ten'd &s;lipping, they heard her
fall in the Lake: the Queen, had &s;he not &s;woon'd,
would certainly have alarm'd the Gari&s;on with
her Cries and Complaints. The King, grieved at
this Accident, and &s;ought for her as much as the
darkne&s;s of the Night would let him, and found
the Basket, but none of the Prince&s;s; &s;o that
giving her up for lo&s;t, he row'd away as fa&s;t as he
was able, with the re&s;t of his Family: and when
they came to the other &s;ide, found Hor&s;es, which
were provided by the &s;ame Soldier, and laid ready
for them to go where they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>During their Confinement, the King and Queen
had time to moralize and reflect, that the greate&s;t
Ble&s;&s;ings this Life affords were but &s;mall, when
ju&s;tly weigh'd; which, together with the new Mi&s;|fortune
of lo&s;ing their little Daughter, made them re|&s;olve
not to retire to any neighbouring Prince or
Ally, to whom they might be chargeable, but to &s;ettle
in &s;ome fertile and plea&s;ant Plain; there to change
the Scepter for a Shepherd's Crook, and buy a
Flock of Sheep. And having pitch'd on this Coun|try,
they built a pretty Cottage, which was &s;hel|ter'd
from the Weather by the Mountains that
<PB N="189" REF="190">
were behind it, and render'd plea&s;ant by a pretty
Brook that ran before it. Here they enjoy'd more
Tranquillity than upon their Throne. There
were none that envy'd their Poverty; they feared
no Traitors nor Flatterers, and pa&s;&s;ed their Days
free fromTrouble. The King would often &s;ay,
&startq;Ah! how happy might Men be, could they
cure them&s;elves of Ambition? I have been a
King, but now prefer my Cottage before the
Palace, wherein I once reign'd.&endq; Under this
great Philo&s;opher this young Prince, ignorant of
his Ma&s;ter's Rank, received his Education, while
the Ma&s;ter was not better informed of his Pupil's;
but his Di&s;po&s;itions were &s;o noble, that he could
not believe him of mean Birth. He ob&s;erved with
plea&s;ure, that he always put him&s;elf at the head
of his Companions, and, with an Air of Superiority,
drew Re&s;pect from them; he was continually form|ing
Armies, building Forts, and attacking them,
and whenever his Father (as we mu&s;t call him)
took him along with him a hunting, would face
the greate&s;t Dangers. All the&s;e things per&s;uaded
him, that he was born to command; but till he
arrives at fifteen Years of Age, let us leave him to
his Studies, and return to his Father's Court.</P>
<P>The crook-back'd Prince, &s;eeing that his Father
grew very old, &s;hewed little regard to him, and
grew &s;o impatient to wear his Crown, that to di|vert
him&s;elf, and not to lie idle, he asked the King
for an Army, to go and conquer a neighbouring
Kingdom, who&s;e Factions invited him. The King
con&s;ented, on condition that he would &s;ign an In|&s;trument
to all the Lords of the Kingdom, &s;ignify|ing,
that if ever the young Prince return'd, and
that they were well a&s;&s;ured it was him, by the
Arrow on his Arm, to re&s;ign the Crown to him.
The Prince &s;eem'd very ready, being a&s;&s;ured of
his Brother's Death, and thinking he hazarded no|thing,
but at the &s;ame time valued him&s;elf very
much upon this piece of Compliance. When this
<PB N="190" REF="191">
was done, and regi&s;ter'd in the proper Courts, and
the In&s;trument it&s;elf laid up in the Trea&s;ury, the
King rai&s;ed a gallant Army, which the Prince, af|ter
taking his leave of him, put him&s;elf at the head
of; and after &s;everal Battles, kill'd the King his
Enemy, with his own hand, took the Capital Ci|ty,
and having left a Gari&s;on and Governour in it,
return'd home to his Father, to whom he pre&s;ented
a young Prince&s;s, call'd <HI>Carpillona,</HI> whom he had
taken captive. She was as beautiful as Nature
could form, or Imagination repre&s;ent. The King,
at the fir&s;t &s;ight of her, was charm'd, and the
crooked Prince, who had beheld her often, was &s;o
much in love with her, that he could not re&s;t:
She hated him as much as he loved her; for as he
always u&s;ed her as his Slave, her Heart was &s;o &s;et
again&s;t him, and his Manner of Addre&s;s, that &s;he
did what &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could to avoid him.</P>
<P>The King appointed her an Apartment in the
Palace, and Women to wait on her, and was very
&s;en&s;ible of the Misfortunes of &s;o young and beau|tiful
a Prince&s;s. And when the crooked Prince
ask'd his Con&s;ent to marry her, he reply'd, he con|&s;ented,
provided &s;he had no Reluctancy; but that
he thought, when he was nigh her, &s;he &s;eemed
melancholy: &startq;'Tis becau&s;e &s;he loves me, <HI>an&s;wer'd
the Prince,</HI> and dares not di&s;cover it, and the Con|&s;traint
&s;he puts upon her&s;elf occa&s;ions it; but as
&s;oon as &s;he &s;hall be my Wife, you &s;hall &s;ee &s;he
will be plea&s;ed.&endq; &startq;I would believe &s;o, <HI>&s;aid the
King;</HI> but don't you flatter your&s;elf a little too
much?&endq; The Prince, angry at the&s;e his Father's
Doubts, went and told the Prince&s;s, that &s;he was
the Cau&s;e that the King &s;hew'd a more than u&s;ual
Severity in his Behaviour towards him; upon
which he &s;u&s;pected he might love her, and there|fore
de&s;ired her to tell him &s;incerely, which of
them &s;he approved be&s;t of, a&s;&s;uring her, that pro|vided
&s;he reign'd, he &s;hould be content. This he
&s;aid only to know her Sentiments, and not with
<PB N="191" REF="192">
any intent of changing his. The young <HI>Carpillona,</HI>
who was not &s;o experienced, as to know that mo&s;t
Lovers are Di&s;&s;emblers, gave into the Deceit, and
&s;aid; &startq;I mu&s;t own, Sir, that was I my own Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
I would neither make choice of the King,
nor your&s;elf: but &s;ince my bad Fortune impo&s;es
this hard Nece&s;&s;ity upon me, I mu&s;t tell you, the
King.&endq; &startq;And why?&endq; <HI>an&s;wer'd he, with &s;ome violence.</HI>
&startq;Becau&s;e, <HI>added &s;he,</HI> he is more mild than you,
reigns at this time, and will not live &s;o long.&endq;
&startq;Ha, ha! <HI>cry'd he,</HI> you would be left Queen-Dowa|ger
in a &s;hort time, but &s;atisfy your&s;elf you &s;hall
not: The King has no thoughts of you, 'tis only
I that do you that honour, which is much more
than you de&s;erve, for your Ingratitude is im|men&s;e;
but were it a thou&s;and times more than
it is, you &s;hould be my Wife.&endq; The Prince&s;s <HI>Car|pillona</HI>
conceived, but &s;omewhat too late, that it
was dangerous to &s;peak one's Thoughts; and to
make amends for what &s;he had &s;o unwarily &s;aid,
reply'd again, &startq;I only u&s;ed this Stratagem to try
your Sentiments, and I am very glad that you
love me &s;o well, to with&s;tand my affected Seve|rities.
I e&s;teem you already; endeavour, Sir, to
make me love you.&endq; The Prince bowed, and be|lieved
what &s;he &s;aid to be Truth; Men being ge|nerally
great Fools when in love, and too apt to
flatter them&s;elves. <HI>Carpillona,</HI> by this means, made
him as mild as a Lamb, and he went away &s;miling,
and &s;queezed her Hand &s;o hard, &s;he thought he
had broke it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, &s;he ran into the King's
Apartment, and ca&s;ting her&s;elf at his feet, &s;aid,
&startq;Secure me, Sir, from the greate&s;t of all Misfor|tunes:
The Prince would marry me, and I mu&s;t
confe&s;s he is odious to me; be not &s;o unju&s;t as
him. My Rank, my Youth, and the Misfortunes
of my Family, de&s;erve the Pity of &s;o great a
King.&endq; &startq;Fair Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> I am not
&s;urprized that my Son loves you, none that be|hold
<PB N="192" REF="193">
you can avoid it; but I &s;hall not forgive
him the want of Re&s;pect he owes you.&endq; &startq;Ah!
Sir, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> he looks upon me as his Pri&s;oner,
and treats me like a Slave.&endq; &startq;'Twas with my Ar|my,
<HI>an&s;wer'd the King,</HI> that he has vanqui&s;hed the
King your Father, and if you are a Captive, you
are mine, and I give you your Liberty; and am
happy, that my advanced Age and grey Hairs &s;e|cure
me from being your Slave.&endq; The grateful
Prince&s;s returned the King a thou&s;and Thanks, and
retired with her Women.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Prince, having been in|form'd
of what pa&s;s'd, re&s;ented it very much; but
his Rage was work'd up to the highe&s;t pitch, when
the King forbid him to think any more of the
Prince&s;s: telling him, that after all the Services
he had offer'd her, &s;he could not love him. &startq;What,
<HI>an&s;wer'd he,</HI> &s;hall I labour all my days to no pur|po&s;e?
I love not to lo&s;e my time after &s;uch a
manner.&endq; &startq;I am &s;orry you &s;hould, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI>
but it mu&s;t not be.&endq; &startq;We &s;hall &s;ee that, <HI>&s;aid the
Prince, in an in&s;olent manner, and going out of the
Room;</HI> do you think to take my Pri&s;oner from me?
I'll lo&s;e my Life fir&s;t.&endq; &startq;She you call your Pri|&s;oner,
<HI>&s;aid the enraged King,</HI> was mine, and now is
free; I have made her Mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf, and
not to depend on your Caprice.&endq; So &s;mart a Con|ver&s;ation
had gone further, had not the Prince re|tired,
who from that moment conceived a De&s;ire
of taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown and Prince&s;s.
He had gained the Hearts of the Soldiers, and ill-de&s;igning
People were a&s;&s;i&s;ting to his Ambition,
that the King at la&s;t was inform'd of his Intentions
of dethroning him; and knowing him to have the
Army on his &s;ide, was forced to take the milde&s;t
mea&s;ures. He &s;ent for the Prince, and &s;aid to him,
&startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be &s;o ungrateful, as
to take from me my Crown, to &s;et it upon your
own Head, &s;ince you &s;ee I am &s;o nigh my End?
Have I not had Misfortunes enough already, by
<PB N="193" REF="194">
lo&s;ing a Wife and Son? Indeed I have oppo&s;ed
your De&s;igns upon the Prince&s;s <HI>Carpillona,</HI> but as
much for your &s;ake as hers; for how can you be
happy with a Per&s;on that does not love you? But
&s;ince you will run the ri&s;que of it, I con&s;ent you
&s;hall marry her; but let me have &s;ome time to
talk to her, to prepare her for it.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prince, who wi&s;h'd more for the Prince&s;s
than the Kingdom, (for he had that which he late|ly
conquer'd) told the King, That he was not &s;o
de&s;irous of reigning as he believed, &s;ince he had
&s;ign'd an Act, whereby he di&s;inherited him&s;elf, in
ca&s;e his Brother return'd, and &s;hould re&s;t &s;atisfy'd,
provided he might marry <HI>Carpillona.</HI> The King em|braced
him, and went to the Prince&s;s, who was
always with her Governe&s;s, in cruel Alarms; whom
&s;he had then carried into her Clo&s;et, and crying
bitterly, &s;aid, &startq;Should it be po&s;&s;ible, that after all
the Promi&s;es the King has made me, he &s;hould
be &s;o cruel as to &s;acrifice me to his Crook-back'd
Son, the Day of my Nuptials would be the la&s;t
I &s;hall breathe; &s;ince I am more di&s;plea&s;ed with
the ill Qualities of his Heart, than the Deformity
of his Body.&endq; &startq;Alas! my dear Prince&s;s, <HI>reply'd the
Governe&s;s,</HI> you know not undoubtedly, that the
Daughters of the greate&s;t Kings are always made
Victims to the State; they never con&s;ult their
Inclination, nor whether the Prince that is to
e&s;pou&s;e them be hand&s;ome or deform'd.&endq; And ju&s;t
as <HI>Carpillona</HI> was about to reply, &s;he was told that
the King waited for her in her Chamber. As &s;oon
as &s;he &s;et her Eyes on him, &s;he knew what he
came about, having a great Penetration; and cry'd
out, &startq;Alas! what have you to tell me?&endq; &startq;Fair
Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> look not on your Marriage with
my Son as a Misfortune, but con&s;ent willingly:
the Violence that he commits, in regard to your
Sentiments for him, &s;hews but the Ardour of his
own: and if he loved you not, he might find more
Prince&s;&s;es, who would be glad to partake with
<PB N="194" REF="195">
him a Crown, which he is already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of, be&s;ides that which he will have after my
Death. Your Di&s;dain and Contempt have not
been able to di&s;may him, and you ought to be|lieve
that he will forget nothing to plea&s;e you.&endq;
&startq;I flatter'd my&s;elf, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> to have found a Pro|tector
in you, but my Hopes are deceived: you
abandon me, but the ju&s;t Gods will not.&endq; &startq;If you
knew but all I have done, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> to prevent
this Marriage, you would be convinced of my
Friend&s;hip.&endq; &startq;Alas! Heaven ble&s;&s;ed me with a
Son, who was nur&s;ed by his own Mother; but he
was &s;tole away one night, and a Cat put in his
place, which bit the Queen &s;o cruelly, that &s;he
died of it. If that lovely Child had not been ta|ken
from me, he would have been now a Com|fort
to me in my old Age; my Subjects would
have feared him, and I might have offer'd you my
Crown with him. This Son would not then have
carried things &s;o high as now, but would have
thought him&s;elf happy to live at Court.&endq; &startq;I am
then the Cau&s;e of what has befel you, <HI>an&s;wer'd
&s;he;</HI> &s;ince he would have been &s;o &s;erviceable to
me, look upon me as the guilty Wretch, and
think of puni&s;hing me, rather than marrying me.&endq;
&startq;You was not then capable, fair Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
of doing good or harm; I accu&s;e you not of my
Misfortunes, but if you would not augment them,
prepare your&s;elf to receive my Son: for he is too
powerful here, and may act &s;ome tragick Scene.&endq;
The King &s;eeing &s;he return'd no other An&s;wer,
but was all in Tears, left her; and knowing the
Prince would be impatient, went and told him
that the Prince&s;s had given her Con&s;ent, and bid
him make every thing ready again&s;t the Solemniza|tion
of the Marriage. The Prince, tran&s;ported
with Joy, thank'd the King, and immediately &s;ent
for Jewellers, and all &s;orts of Trade&s;men, and be|&s;poke
all the fine&s;t things imaginable; and then
&s;ent &s;everal rich Pre&s;ents of Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
<PB N="195" REF="196">
&s;he received with all the Appearance of Joy. Af|terwards
he paid her a Vi&s;it him&s;elf, and among
other things, &s;aid, &startq;Was you not very much in the
wrong, Madam, to refu&s;e the Honour I would
do you, &s;ince I am not di&s;agreeable in my Per|&s;on,
and the World &s;ay I have Wit; be&s;ides, you
&s;hall have the fine&s;t Diamonds, and wear the rich|e&s;t
Clothes of any Queen in the World.&endq; The
Prince&s;s an&s;wer'd coldly, That the Misfortunes of
her Family would not permit her to dre&s;s like o|ther
Prince&s;&s;es, and de&s;ired him not to make &s;o
great Pre&s;ents. &startq;You are in the right, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> not
to dre&s;s your&s;elf, if I don't give you leave; but
you mu&s;t think of plea&s;ing me: every thing will
be ready for our Marriage within four days; di|vert
your&s;elf till then, and command here, &s;ince
you are ab&s;olute Mi&s;tre&s;s.&endq; And after that left
her.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he gone, but &s;he &s;hut her&s;elf up
with her Governe&s;s, and told her, &s;he might chu&s;e
whether &s;he would find her the means of e&s;caping,
or tho&s;e of killing her&s;elf on the Wedding-Day.
After the Governe&s;s had repre&s;ented to her the
Impo&s;&s;ibility of getting away, and the Weak|ne&s;s
&s;he &s;hew'd, by killing her&s;elf, to avoid the
Misfortunes of this Life; &s;he $n$eavour'd to per|&s;uade
her, that Virtue might contribute to her
Tranquillity, and that without having an intire
Love for the Prince, &s;he might e&s;teem him enough,
to live happy with him. <HI>Carpillona</HI> could not yield
to any of the&s;e Remon&s;trances; but told her, that
till then &s;he made account &s;he had &s;ome value for
her, but that now &s;he was &s;en&s;ible how much it
was; and that if all the World &s;hould fail her, &s;he
would not be failing to her&s;elf; and that dangerous
Di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t have dangerous Remedies. After this
&s;he open'd the Window, and looking &s;ome time
out of it, her Governe&s;s, who fear'd &s;he de&s;ign'd
to throw her&s;elf out, fell on her Knees, and look|ing
tenderly at her, &s;aid, &startq;Alas! Madam, what
<PB N="196" REF="197">
would you have me do? I will obey you, tho
it &s;hould co&s;t me my Life.&endq; The Prince&s;s em|braced
her, and de&s;ired her to buy her a Shep|herd's
Dre&s;s, and a Cow, and not amu&s;e her&s;elf
with per&s;uading her from her De&s;ign, &s;ince it would
be to no purpo&s;e, and only lo&s;ing time; and not
only that, but to dre&s;s up a Figure, and lay it in
her Bed, and &s;ay &s;he was ill. &startq;You know, Madam,
<HI>&s;aid the poor Governe&s;s,</HI> the Dangers to which I ex|po&s;e
my&s;elf; the Prince, without doubt, will
know that I a&s;&s;i&s;ted you, he will make u&s;e of a
thou&s;and Torments to make me confe&s;s: and then
judge if my Love is not great.&endq; The Prince&s;s,
very much confounded, made an&s;wer, That &s;he
&s;hould go away her&s;elf two days after, and that it
would be ea&s;y to impo&s;e upon the World for that
&s;hort time. In &s;hort, they contrived &s;o well, that
<HI>Carpillo$a</HI> had that night both a Shepherde&s;s's Habit
and a Cow, and appear'd as beautiful as the Queen
of Love, when &s;he appear'd with <HI>Juno</HI> and <HI>Pallas,</HI>
in that Habit, to <HI>Paris</HI> on Mount <HI>Ida.</HI> She &s;et out
by Moon-light, &s;ometimes leading her Cow, and
&s;ometimes getting on her back; and if the lea&s;t
Breath of Air but gently agitated the Leaves of the
Trees, a Bird flew off her Ne&s;t, or any thing &s;tir|red,
&s;he feared it might be Wolves or Thieves.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he travelled all the night, and would have
done the next day, but that her Cow &s;topped to
graze in a plea&s;ant Mead; where the Prince&s;s, fa|tigued
with the Weight of her Clothes and Shoes,
&s;at her&s;elf down on the Gra&s;s by a purling Stream,
and tied up her Hair, which had got out from un|der
her Cap, and fell in flowing Rings on her
Shoulders. She looked about, to &s;ee if &s;he might
not be ob&s;erved; but for all her Precaution, &s;he
was &s;urprized by a Lady all in Armour, who, ta|king
off her Head-piece, which was Gold, adorn'd
with Diamonds, &s;aid, &startq;Shepherde&s;s, I am very dry
and weary, will you give me &s;ome Milk to quench
my Thir&s;t?&endq; &startq;With all my heart, Madam, <HI>&s;aid</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="198">
Carpillona, if I had any thing to put it in.&endq; &startq;I
have here a <HI>China</HI> Di&s;h, <HI>&s;aid the armed Lady,</HI> take
that.&endq; But the poor Prince&s;s not knowing how to
&s;troke the Teat; &startq;What, <HI>&s;aid the Lady,</HI> is your
Cow dry, or do not you know how to milk her?&endq;
Hereupon the Prince&s;s, a&s;hamed to appear &s;o aw|$ard
before &s;uch an extraordinary Per&s;on, fell a
crying, and reply'd; &startq;I mu&s;t own, Madam, for
the &s;mall time I have been a Shepherde&s;s, it has
been my bu&s;ine&s;s to feed my Cow; my Mother
does all the re&s;t.&endq; &startq;Then you have a Mother,
<HI>continued the Lady;</HI> and pray what does &s;he do?&endq;
&startq;She is a Farmer,&endq; <HI>&s;aid</HI> Carpillona. &startq;What, hard
by?&endq; <HI>&s;aid the Lady again.</HI> &startq;Yes,&endq; <HI>reply'd the Prince&s;s.</HI>
&startq;Really, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I have a great affection for her
upon your account, and will go to &s;ee her; lead
me to her.&endq; <HI>Carp$llona</HI> was at a &s;tand what An&s;wer
to make; &s;he was unu&s;ed to lye, and knew not
that &s;he talked to a Fairy. She looked down, her
Colour came into her Face, and at la&s;t &s;he &s;aid,
&startq;When once I come abroad, I never return till
Night; therefore I de&s;ire you, Madam, not to
make my Mother angry with me.&endq; &startq;Ah! Prin|ce&s;s,
Prince&s;s, <HI>&s;aid the Fairy,</HI> you cannot &s;upport
a Lye, nor act the Per&s;on you pretend to be,
without my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Here take this No&s;egay of
Gilliflowers, and be a&s;&s;ured that while you have
it, the crook-back'd Prince, from whom you fly,
will never know you; and remember, when
you come to the great Fore&s;t, to inform your&s;elf
of them whereabout the Shepherd <HI>$word$</HI> had
his Abode. Tell him that you $word$ from the
Fairy <HI>Amazona,</HI> who de&s;ired him to receive you
as his Daughter. Farewel, <HI>Carpillona,</HI> I ha$e been
your Friend a long time.&endq; &startq;Alas! Madam, <HI>cry'd
the Prince&s;s,</HI> do you love me, and can you abandon
me, when I &s;tand &s;o much in need of your a&s;|&s;i&s;tance?&endq;
&startq;The No&s;egay will not fail you, <HI>reply'd
&s;he;</HI> my time is precious, and I mu&s;t leave you
<PB N="198" REF="199">
to compleat your De&s;tiny.&endq; And as &s;he utter'd
the&s;e Words, di&s;appear'd.</P>
<P><HI>Carpillona</HI> was ready to die with Fear, but re|covering
her&s;elf, continued her Way, though igno|rant
of the Road that led to the great Fore&s;t;
thinking to her&s;elf, that this able Fairy would con|duct
her thither, and always kept the No&s;egay
in her Hand, whether &s;he &s;tood &s;till or walk'd:
But at la&s;t, her Feet were &s;o chafed and &s;ore,
that &s;he was forced to lie down under the Shade
of &s;ome Trees; where &s;he reflected often, and
with no &s;mall Unea&s;ine&s;s, on her poor Governe&s;s,
of who&s;e Zeal and Fidelity there are but few Ex|amples.
She dre&s;s'd up a Figure, as the Prince&s;s
had order'd her, went always very &s;oftly into her
Room, as &s;he &s;aid, for fear of di&s;turbing her, and
&s;colded at the lea&s;t noi&s;e that was ever made. The
King, when he was told of the Prince&s;s's being
&s;ick, was not at all &s;urprized, attributing it to
her Grief, and the Violence offer'd: But as &s;oon as
the Prince was inform'd of this ill News, his Cha|grin
was inconceivable; he would &s;ee her, but the
Governe&s;s, with much ado, prevented him. Then
$e ask'd that his Phy&s;ician might; but &s;he told
him, it would be the means to kill her, for &s;he
hated all Phy&s;icians and their Remedies: but with|al,
bid him not be frighten'd, telling him, it was
only a Dizzine&s;s of her Head, and that &s;he would
be well, after three or four days re&s;t: By which
means, &s;he put a &s;top to any farther Importunities.
When one Night, when &s;he was preparing for her
Flight, &s;he heard him knock at the door, as if he
would break it down; and what induced him to
this Violence, was an Information he had had of
the matter from the other Women; who per|ceiving
the Deceit, and fearing &s;ome Puni&s;hment
might fall to their &s;hare, went and told him pre|&s;ently.
The Exce&s;s of his Rage cannot be ex|pre&s;s'd:
He ran to the King, thinking he was not
ignorant of it, but found by the Surprize he read
<PB N="399" REF="200">
in his Face, him&s;elf to be mi&s;taken As &s;oon as he
&s;aw the poor Governe&s;s, he &s;aid to her, catching
hold of her Hair; &startq;Give me my <HI>Carpillona,</HI> or I'll
tear out they Heart.&endq; She made no Reply, but
with Tears; and pro&s;trating her&s;elf at his Knees,
conjured him, but all in vain, to hear her. He
ca&s;t her into a deep Dungeon, and had put her to
death a thou&s;and times, had not the King, who
was as good as his Son was wicked, obliged him to
let her live in that frightful Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>This amorous and violent Prince, ordered, that
the Prince&s;s &s;hould be pur&s;ued both by Sea and
Land; and to that end, left the Court him&s;elf, and
ran about like a mad Man. When one day, as
<HI>Carpillona</HI> was &s;at with her Cow under a large
Ro$k, and the Weather being very tempe&s;tuous,
&s;he remain'd trembling at the Thunder and Light|ning,
when the crook-back'd Prince came thi|ther
with his Attendants for &s;helter. But, alas!
when &s;he &s;aw him &s;o nigh her, &s;he was more
frighten'd, than at the Thunder and Lightning:
She held her No&s;egay of Gilliflowers fa&s;t with
both her Hands; and remembring the Fairy, &s;aid,
&startq;Abandon me not, charming <HI>Amazona.</HI>&endq; The Prince
ca&s;ting his Eyes upon her, &s;aid, &startq;What can you
be afraid of, poor decrepid old Wretch? Where
would be the hurt if the Thunder &s;hould kill
thee, &s;ince thou ha&s;t one Foot in the Grave al|ready?&endq;
The young Prince&s;s was not le&s;s over|joy'd
than amazed, to hear him call her old:
&startq;Without doubt, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,</HI> my No&s;egay
works this Wonder.&endq; And that &s;he might have no
farther Conver&s;ation with him, &s;he pretended to
be deaf. The Prince, finding &s;he could not hear,
&s;aid to his Confidant, who was never from him;
&startq;Now, if my Heart was a little more gay, I could
&s;et this old Creature upon the top of the Rock,
and have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her roll down
and break her Neck.&endq; &startq;But, Sir, <HI>reply'd this wic|ked
Favourite,</HI> to divert you, I'll carry her up by
<PB N="200" REF="201">
&startq;force, and you &s;hall &s;ee her Body bound like a
Ball.&endq; &startq;We have not now time, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we mu&s;t
continue our Search after this Ungrate, who
di&s;turbs the Repo&s;e of my Life.&endq;</P>
<P>As he made an end of the&s;e Words, he clapt
Spurs to his Hor&s;e, and rid off. It is ea&s;y to judge
of the Joy of the Prince&s;s; who did not forget to
thank the Fairy <HI>Amazona,</HI> who&s;e Power &s;he was
then &s;en&s;ible of. She pur&s;ued her Journey, and
arrived at the Plain whereon the Shepherds of that
Country built their Huts: which were all very
pretty, each having a Garden and a Spring. The
Valley of <HI>Tempe</HI> could not be more agreeable. The
Shepherde&s;&s;es were for the mo&s;t part beautiful,
and the Shepherds neglected nothing to plea&s;e them.
On all the Trees, Cyphers and Love-Ver&s;es were
ingraved. As &s;oon as <HI>Carpillona</HI> appear'd among
them, they left their Flocks; and, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with
her Beauty and maje&s;tick Air, advanc'd towards
her; but what &s;urprized them mo&s;t, was the Mean|ne&s;s
of her Habit: For though they lived an inno|cent
and ru&s;tick Life, yet they pretended very
much to a neat Adju&s;tment of their Apparel. The
Princes de&s;ired them to &s;hew her the Shepherd
<HI>Sublimus</HI>'s Cottage; which they did pre&s;ently: and
there &s;he found the good old Man &s;at in the Valley
with his Wife and Daughters, a little Brook run|ning
by them, which charm'd with its gentle Mur|murs;
he had &s;ome Reeds in his Hands, with
which he was making a little Basket to gather Fruit
in; and his Wife was &s;pinning, while his Daugh|ters
were angling in the Brook.</P>
<P>When <HI>Carpillona</HI> fir&s;t acco&s;ted them, &s;he was fen|&s;ible
of &s;o much Re&s;pect and Tenderne&s;s, that &s;he
was her&s;elf &s;urprized; and when they &s;aw her,
they were no le&s;s affected. &startq;I am, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, &s;a|luting
them in an humble manner,</HI> a poor Shepher|de&s;s,
and come from the Fairy <HI>Amazona,</HI> to offer
you my Service, and hope, that upon her ac|count
you will receive me.&endq; &startq;Child, <HI>&s;aid the
<PB N="201" REF="202">
King, getting up, and returning her Salute in as civil a
manner;</HI> that great Fairy has rea&s;on to believe
that we have a perfect Honour for her; but you
are welcome, if you had no other Recommenda|tion
but your own Per&s;on.&endq; &startq;Come hither, pret|ty
Maid, <HI>&s;aid the Queen, holding out her Hand,</HI> come
and let me ki&s;s you: I conceive a great Kindne&s;s
for you, and could wi&s;h you would look upon
me as your own Mother, and my Children as
your Si&s;ters.&endq; &startq;Alas! my good Mother, <HI>&s;aid the
Prince&s;s,</HI> I de&s;erve not that Honour, it is enough
for me to be your Shepherde&s;s, and tend your
Flock.&endq; &startq;No, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> we are are all e|qual
here, you come with too good a Recom|mendation
for us to make any difference between
you and our Children; &s;it down by us, and let
your Cow feed with our Sheep.&endq; She made &s;ome
difficulty, per&s;i&s;ting in what &s;he told them at fir&s;t,
that &s;he was come only to be their Servant; but
would have been very much embara&s;s'd if they had
taken her at her word: for indeed, by her Looks,
&s;he &s;eem'd to be made more to command than to
obey; and it might be thought, that &s;o great a
Fairy would not protect an ordinary Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The King and Queen look'd upon her with an
Amazement mix'd with Admiration, which they
could not comprehend: They ask'd her if &s;he came
a great way? &s;he &s;aid, yes; and then, if &s;he had a
Father and Mother? to which &s;he &s;aid, no: and
an&s;wer'd all their other Que&s;tions with Mono|&s;yllables,
as much as her Re&s;pect would allow her
to do. &startq;What is your Name, <HI>&s;aid the Queen?&endq;
&startq;Carpillona, reply'd &s;he.</HI>&endq; &startq;The Name, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI>
is very odd; and, unle&s;s &s;ome Adventure gives
room for it, it is very rare.&endq; She made no an|&s;wer,
but took up one of the Queen's Spindles, to
wind off the Thred: But when &s;he drew off her
Gloves, the King and Queen, who ca&s;t their Eyes
upon her Hands, thought them to be Snow, form'd
in that Shape; and, to penetrate farther into her&punc;
<PB N="202" REF="203">
Condition, &s;aid; &startq;<HI>Carpillona</HI> your Clothes are too
hot for the Climate we live in, and your Shoes
too heavy and clum&s;y for &s;o young a Dam&s;el;
you mu&s;t be dre&s;s'd after our manner.&endq; &startq;My
Clothes, Mother, <HI>an&s;wer'd &s;he,</HI> are &s;uch as they
wear in my Country; but I'll put on what you
plea&s;e to order me.&endq; They admir'd her Obedi|ence,
and above all, the Air of Mode&s;ty that ap|pear'd
in her Eyes and all her Actions; but, it be|ing
Supper-time, they got up, and went all into
the Hou&s;e, where they intended to dre&s;s the Fi&s;h
that the two Prince&s;s's had caught, and &s;ome fre&s;h
Eggs, and to make the re&s;t up with Milk and
Fruit. &startq;I am &s;urprized, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> that my Son
is not yet come home; his Eagerne&s;s after Sport
carries him too far; and I am always in fear, le&s;t
&s;ome Accident &s;hould befall him.&endq; &startq;My Fears
are no le&s;s than yours, <HI>&s;aid the Queen;</HI> but, if you
plea&s;e, we will not &s;up till he comes.&endq; No, <HI>&s;aid
the King,</HI> let him mind his time better; on the
contrary, I de&s;ire you, when he comes, not to &s;peak
to him, but that every one give him a cold Recep|tion.&endq;
&startq;You know his Good-nature, <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI>
and he will be &s;o much troubled, that he will
fall &s;ick.&endq; &startq;I can't help that, <HI>reply'd the King,</HI> he
mu&s;t be corrected.&endq; After this Di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;at
to Supper; but before they had quite done, the
young Prince came in, with a wild Roe on his
Shoulders, his Hair all wet with Sweat, and
his Face cover'd with Du&s;t; he leant on a little
Lance he generally carried along with him; his
$ow hung on one &s;ide, and his Quiver of Arrows
on the other. In this Condition, there appear'd
&s;omething &s;o noble and lofty in his Countenance
and Mien, that none could look upon him without
Attention and Re&s;pect: &startq;Mother, <HI>&s;aid he, addre&s;|&s;ing
him&s;elf to the Queen,</HI> my De&s;ire to bring you
this Roe, has made me run all day over the Moun|tains
and Plains.&endq; &startq;Son, <HI>&s;aid the King gravely,</HI>
you endeavour more to make us unea&s;y, than to
<PB N="203" REF="204">
plea&s;e us; you know how much I have &s;aid to
you, on your violent De&s;ire of Sport: but you
are re&s;olv'd to take no notice of it.&endq; The Prince
blu&s;h'd, and what vex'd him mo&s;t, was, to &s;ee a
Per&s;on there, who did not belong to the Family.
He reply'd, that another time he would come &s;oon|er;
or, that if he did not approve of it, he would not
go at all. &startq;That's enough, <HI>&s;aid the Queen, who lo|ved
him tenderly;</HI> I thank you, Child, for your
Pre&s;ent: Come and &s;it by me, and eat your Sup|per,
for to be &s;ure, you mu&s;t be hungry.&endq; The
Prince was &s;omewhat di&s;order'd at the &s;erious
Air the King &s;poke to him in, and dur&s;t not
look up; for though he was intrepid in all Dan|gers,
he was of a docible Temper, and &s;tood
in great awe, where his Duty required it of
him. But at la&s;t, he recover'd out of his Con|fu&s;ion,
&s;at down by the Queen, and ca&s;t his Eyes
on <HI>Carpillona,</HI> who had not &s;tay'd &s;o long to look at
him: but as &s;oon as their Eyes met, their Hearts
were &s;o agitated, that they knew not what to at|tribute
this Di&s;order to. The Prince&s;s blu&s;h'd, and
the Prince kept his Eyes &s;tedfa&s;t upon her; till at
la&s;t, &s;he rai&s;ing her's again with a plea&s;ing Soft|ne&s;s,
they continued looking at each other with a
mutual Surprize, thinking nothing could equal what
they beheld. &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible, <HI>&s;aid the Prince&s;s to her|&s;elf,</HI>
that, of &s;o many Per&s;ons I have &s;een at Court,
&startq;none &s;hould come nigh to this young Shepherd?&endq;
&startq;How comes it, <HI>thought he to him&s;elf,</HI> that this ad|mirable
Maid &s;hould be but a poor Shepherde&s;s!
Ah! that I was but a King, to place her on a
Throne, and to make her as much the Mi&s;tre&s;s
of my Empire as &s;he is of my Heart.&endq; In mu&s;ing
after this manner, he eat nothing. The Queen,
who thought it owing to the ill Reception he met
with, tired her&s;elf with inviting and care&s;&s;ing him,
and brought out the fine&s;t Fruits &s;he had. He de|&s;ired
<HI>Carpillona</HI> to ta&s;te of them. She thank'd him,
and told him, without thinking on the Hand that
<PB N="204" REF="205">
gave them, that &s;he had done nothing but eat, and
cared for no more. Upon which, he left them
coldly upon the Table. The Queen took not the
lea&s;t notice of all this; but the elde&s;t Prince&s;s, who
had no &s;mall e&s;teem for him, and who perhaps
might have loved him very well, but for the Dif|ference
&s;he thought between them, ob&s;erved all
that pa&s;t with &s;ome Jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>After Supper, the King and Queen retired, and
the Prince&s;&s;es, according to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom,
did whatever was to be done in the Hou&s;e: One
milk'd the Cows, the other pre&s;s'd the Chee&s;e,
<HI>&amp;c. Carpillona</HI> bu&s;ied her&s;elf after their Example
to work; but &s;he was &s;o little us'd to it, that &s;he
did nothing to the purpo&s;e: in&s;omuch, that the
two Prince&s;&s;es call'd her the pretty unhandy Maid.
The amorous Prince help'd her in every thing; he
went to the Spring with her, carried her Pail,
drew the Water, and brought it back on his &s;houl|ders,
and would not &s;uffer her to carry any thing.
&startq;What do you mean, Shepherd, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him;</HI>
mu&s;t I act the fine Lady? I that have been u&s;ed
all my Life to work? Am I to live here in Idle|ne&s;s?&endq;
&startq;You &s;hall do what you plea&s;e, lovely
Shepherde&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> but deny me not the plea|&s;ure
of accepting my &s;mall A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the&s;e Oc|ca&s;ions.&endq;
Afterwards, they both return'd, though
&s;ooner than he de&s;ired; for though he dur&s;t not
yet hardly &s;peak to her, neverthele&s;s, he was o|verjoy'd
to be with her. They both pa&s;s'd the
Night in an Unea&s;ine&s;s which neither of them,
through their little Experience, could gue&s;s the
Cau&s;e of. The Prince waited impatiently for day,
to &s;ee the Shepherde&s;s again; and &s;he was in as
much dread. The new Trouble the Sight of him
put her into, &s;omewhat diverted her other Di&s;|plea&s;ures;
and &s;he thought &s;o much of him, that
&s;he almo&s;t forgot the crook-back'd Prince. &startq;Why,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> has blind Fortune be&s;tow'd &s;o many Gra|ces,
&s;uch a Mein, and &s;uch Charms on a young
<PB N="205" REF="206">
Shepherd, who is de&s;tin'd only to feed his Flock;
and &s;o much Malice and Deformity on a Prince
appointed to rule a flouri&s;hing Nation?&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Carpillona</HI> never had the Curio&s;ity to view her&s;elf,
&s;ince her Metamorpho&s;is from a Prince&s;s into a
Shepherde&s;s; but then a certain De&s;ire of plea&s;ing,
made her &s;eek after a Gla&s;s. She was not long
before &s;he found that of the Prince&s;s; but when
&s;he &s;aw her&s;elf, &s;he was quite confounded. &startq;What
a Figure's here, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> what am I like? It is
impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould endure to be buried long
in this coar&s;e Stuff.&endq; Then &s;he wa&s;h'd her Face
and Hands, and went to the Queen, and fal|ling
on her Knees, pre&s;ented her with a fine Dia|mond
Ring, which was part of the Jewels &s;he
brought along with her. &startq;Mother, I found this
Ring &s;ome time &s;ince, but know not the value of
it, but believe it may be worth &s;ome Money; I beg
you would accept of it, as a proof of my Acknow|ledgment
for your Charity towards me; and like|wi&s;e
I de&s;ire you to buy me a Habit, and Linen,
that I may appear like the other Shepherde&s;&s;es
of this Country.&endq; The Queen was very much
&s;urprized to &s;ee &s;o noble a Ring, and told her that
&s;he would not take it, but would keep it for her,
and that &s;he would &s;end to a little Town that was
hard by, for a nice Country Habit, Shoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> com|pleat.</P>
<P>When <HI>Carpillona</HI> was thus dre&s;s'd, &s;he appear'd
more charming than <HI>Aurora.</HI> The Prince neglected
nothing on his part, but adorn'd his Hat, Scrip, and
Crook with Flowers, and carried her a No&s;e-gay,
which he pre&s;ented with all the fear of a Lover,
and which &s;he receiv'd with &s;ome Con&s;ternation,
the &s;he wanted no Pre&s;ence of Mind nor Wit.
When &s;he was with him, &s;he hardly ever &s;poke
but was always very thoughtful, as was he him&s;elf.
When he went a hunting, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing his
Game, whenever he found a place proper to enter|tain
him&s;elf with the thoughts of his beloved. <HI>Car|pillona,</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="207">
he would &s;top all on a &s;udden, and in that
&s;olitary Retirement make Ver&s;es and Songs on his
Shepherde&s;s; often talking to the Rocks, Woods,
and Birds: and in &s;hort, he lo&s;t all that Gaiety of
Temper which made him &s;eek after the Company
of the young Shepherds. But as it is hard to love,
and not fear what we love; he dreaded &s;o much
the making his Shepherde&s;s angry by declaring him|&s;elf,
that he dur&s;t &s;carce ever &s;peak to her: and
tho &s;he ob&s;erved very well, that he preferred her
before all others, and that Preference ought to
a&s;&s;ure her of his Sentiments; yet &s;he could not but
be in &s;ome pain for his Silence. Sometimes &s;he
would be overjoy'd, and would &s;ay to her&s;elf, &startq;If
he really does love me, how &s;hall I receive the
declaration of his Pa&s;&s;ion? If I &s;hould be angry, I
perhaps, &s;hall be the cau&s;e of his Death; and if I
be not, I &s;hall die my&s;elf with Shame and Grief.
What, &s;hall I, who am born a Prince&s;s, hearken
to a poor Shepherd? Ah! too ba&s;e Weakne&s;s, I
&s;hall never con&s;ent. My Heart ought not to
change with my Apparel; I have but too much
to reproach my&s;elf with, &s;ince I have been here.&endq;
As the Prince had a thou&s;and natural Charms in
his Voice, and perhaps had he not &s;ung &s;o well, the
Prince&s;s prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd in his favour, would have
liked to hear him; &s;he would often engage him
to &s;ing: and the Songs he made choice of, had al|ways
&s;omething &s;o tender and engaging in them,
that &s;he could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing a plea&s;ure,
which in&s;pired him with the more Boldne&s;s; and
one day he went to the River-&s;ide, to a place &s;ha|ded
by O&s;iers and Willows, and whither he knew
that <HI>Carpillona</HI> led her Flock every day; and with a
Nail writ on the Bark of one of the Trees the&s;e
Lines:

<P>The Prince&s;s &s;urprized him ju&s;t as he had made
an end; he affected to &s;eem confounded, and after
&s;ome Moments of Silence, &s;aid to her, &startq;You &s;ee an
unhappy Shepherd, who complains to the mo&s;t
in&s;en&s;ible things, when he ought to complain to
none but you.&endq; She made no an&s;wer, but ca&s;ting
down her eyes, gave him the opportunity he wan|ted
to declare his Sentiments. While he was &s;peak|ing,
her Thoughts were wholly taken up how &s;he
ought to take what &s;he heard from a Mouth that
was not indifferent to her; but her Inclination en|gaged
her to excu&s;e him. &startq;He is ignorant, <HI>&s;aid &s;he
to her&s;elf,</HI> of my Birth; therefore his Temerity is
pardonable: he loves me, and thinks me his Equal;
but &s;hould he know my Rank, will not the Gods
them&s;elves, who are &s;o much above us, will not
they accept of the Hearts of Mortals? Are they
angry becau&s;e they are loved? Well, Shepherd,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he, turning her&s;elf towards him,</HI> I pity you; and
that is all I can do for you: I will not love; I
have Misfortunes enough already. Alas! what
would be my Condition, if, to augment my Ca|lamities,
my days &s;hould be burden'd with an
Engagement?&endq; &startq;Ah! Shepherde&s;s, <HI>cry'd he,</HI> &s;ay ra|ther,
that if you have any Troubles, nothing is
more capable to &s;weeten them. I will partake
of all of them; my Study &s;hall be to plea&s;e you;
you may repo&s;e on me the care of your Flock.&endq;
&startq;I wi&s;h to Heaven&punc; <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that I had no other
rea&s;on to be unea&s;y.&endq; &startq;What others can you
have, <HI>&s;aid he, with an eager Concern,</HI> being &s;o beau|tiful,
&s;o young, &s;o free from Ambition, and &s;o
little ver&s;ed with the vain Grandeurs of a Court?
But without doubt, you love here &s;ome happy
<PB N="208" REF="209">
Rival, which renders you inexorable towards me&punc;&endq;
pronouncing the&s;e la&s;t Words, he chang'd Counte|nance,
became melancholy, and was cruelly tor|mented
with this Thought. &startq;I will there agree
with you, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> you have a Rival; but then
he is one hated and abhorr'd: you had never
&s;een me, but that the Nece&s;&s;ity of avoiding his
pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances obliged me to fly from him.&endq;
&startq;Perhaps, Shepherde&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> you will fly from
me too; for if you hated him only becau&s;e he
loved you, I am &s;ure, I am to be hated the mo&s;t
of all Men.&endq; &startq;Whether it be, <HI>replyed &s;he,</HI> that I
don't believe him, or that I look more favourably
upon you, I am &s;en&s;ible I &s;hall not fly from you
as I have done from him.&endq; The Shepherd was
tran&s;ported with Joy at the&s;e obliging Words, and
from that day neglected no Opportunity to plea&s;e
the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Every day he gather'd the fine&s;t Flowers to make
Garlands for her, and adorn'd her Crook with Rib|bands.
He never would &s;uffer her to be expo&s;ed to
the Sun; but whenever &s;he came along the River|&s;ide
with her Flock, he would cut down Branches
of Trees, and form an Arbour wherever there was
a plea&s;ant Situation. All the Trees thereabouts
bore her Cyphers, and Ver&s;es in prai&s;e of her
Beauty. The young Prince&s;s &s;aw all the&s;e Te&s;ti|monies
of the Shepherd's Pa&s;&s;ion; &s;he loved &s;e|cretly,
but dur&s;t never examine her Heart, for fear
of finding there Sentiments too tender. The young
Shepherd's Love for his Shepherde&s;s, could not
long be kept &s;ecret, but was di&s;cover'd, as well as
applauded, by every one; for who could find fault
where all was Love? All who &s;aw them, &s;aid, they
were born for each other, that they were both
perfect Beauties, that it was the Work of the Gods,
that Fortune made their Country &s;o happy, and
that they mu&s;t neglect nothing to detain them.
<HI>Carpillona</HI> felt a &s;ecret Joy to hear the publick Prai|&s;es
in favour of a Swain &s;he thought &s;o amiable;
<PB N="209" REF="210">
but then thinking of the difference that was be|tween
them, &s;he was &s;omewhat chagrin'd, but pur|po&s;ed
not to di&s;cover who &s;he was, that &s;he might
indulge her Heart the more. The King and Queen,
who were extremely fond of them both, were no
ways di&s;plea&s;ed at this growing Pa&s;&s;ion; they look|ed
on the Prince as their own Son, and were no
le&s;s taken with the Perfections of the Shepherde&s;s.
Was &s;he not &s;ent by <HI>Amazona,</HI> &s;aid they, who fought
the Centaur? Without doubt, that wi&s;e Fairy has
de&s;tin'd them for each other; therefore we mu&s;t
wait her Orders.</P>
<P>Things were in this condition; the Prince com|plain'd
always of <HI>Carpillona</HI>'s Indifference, becau&s;e
&s;he carefully conceal'd her Sentiments from him;
when being one day out a hunting, he could not
avoid a furious Bear that came &s;uddenly out of the
Hollow of a Rock, and had devour'd him, had not
his Courage been &s;econded by his Activity. After
having &s;truggled a long time upon the top of the
Mountain, they both at la&s;t rolled down together.
<HI>Carpillona</HI> at that very time was &s;topt with her Com|panions
in that place, yet could not &s;ee what pa&s;s'd
on the top of the Hill. But what a Condition were
they all in, when they &s;aw a Man and a Bear
tumbling down together? The Prince&s;s &s;oon knew
her Shepherd, and &s;ent out Crys of Fear and Grief;
all the Shepherde&s;&s;es ran away: but Love redoub|ling
the Prince&s;s's Courage, &s;he was &s;o bold as to
run the Iron of her Crook down into the terrible
Mon&s;ter's Throat; and to give her Lover &s;ome
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who when he &s;aw her, for fear &s;he might
partake of his danger, rai&s;ed his Courage to &s;uch an
height, that he no longer thought of pre&s;erving his
own Life, but only to &s;ecure hers; and indeed
kill'd his Enemy ju&s;t at her feet: at the &s;ame time
he fell down half dead with the lo&s;s of Blood from
two Wounds he receiv'd.</P>
<P>How cruel a &s;ight was it for her to &s;ee his Clothes
all dyed with Blood! She could not &s;peak; her
<PB N="210" REF="211">
Face was drowned in Tears; &s;he laid his Head in
her Lap, and all on a &s;udden breaking Silence, &s;aid,
&startq;Shepherd, if you die, I'll die with you: In vain
have I conceal'd my &s;ecret Thoughts; know then
now, that my Life is attach'd to yours.&endq; &startq;What
can I wi&s;h for more, fair Shepherde&s;s? <HI>cry'd he in
a faint Voice:</HI> whatever befals me, my Fate now
will always be happy.&endq;</P>
<P>By this time the Shepherde&s;&s;es who fled, return|ed
with &s;everal Shepherds, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Prince
and the Prince&s;s, who by that time was in as bad
a condition: but while they were cutting down
the Branches of Trees to make a &s;ort of Litter for
them, the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> appear'd among them.
&startq;Be not concern'd, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> let me touch the young
Shepherd.&endq; Then taking him by the hand, and
putting her golden Cask upon his Head, &s;he &s;aid,
&startq;Dear Shepherd, I forbid thee from being &s;ick.&endq;
Hereupon he &s;oon got up, and the Vi&s;or of the
Cask being up, there appear'd a martial Air in his
Face; and his Eyes, which were bright and lively,
an&s;wer'd the hopes which the Fairy conceiv'd. He
was amazed at the Manner of his Cure, and the
Maje&s;ty that appear'd throughout her whole Per|&s;on;
and tran&s;ported with Admiration, Joy, and
Acknowledgment, ca&s;t him&s;elf at her feet: &startq;Great
Queen, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I was dangerou&s;ly wounded; one
Glance from your Eyes, and one Word from your
Mouth, has cured me. But, alas! I have a Wound
in my Heart that I will not be cured of; vouch&s;afe
only to a&s;&s;uage the Pain, and mend my Fortune,
&s;ince I cannot partake it, &s;uch as it is, with this
fair Shepherde&s;s.&endq; The Prince&s;s blu&s;h'd to hear
him &s;peak after this manner; &s;he knew that the
Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> was not ignorant who &s;he was, and
fear'd le&s;t &s;he &s;hould blame her for giving hopes to
a Lover &s;o much below her; in&s;omuch that &s;he
dur&s;t not look up: but the Sighs that e&s;caped her
Brea&s;t, rai&s;ed &s;ome pity in that of the Fairy's. &startq;<HI>Car|pillona,
&s;aid &s;he,</HI> this Shepherd is not unworthy
<PB N="211" REF="212">
your E&s;teem; and you, Shepherd, who de&s;ire
&s;o much the Change of your Condition, a&s;&s;ure
your&s;elf of a mo&s;t illu&s;trious Fate.&endq; And then
&s;he di&s;appear'd. The Shepherds and Shepherde&s;&s;es
conducted them back in Triumph to their Hamlet,
placing the two Lovers in the mid&s;t of them, and
crowned them with Flowers as a Token of the
Victory they had gain'd over the terrible Bear,
which they brought after them, &s;inging Ver&s;es on
the Tenderne&s;s of <HI>Carpillona</HI> to the Prince.</P>
<P>When they came to the Shepherd <HI>Sublimus,</HI> they
told him all that had happen'd; with what Courage
the Shepherd had defended him&s;elf again&s;t the Bear,
and with what Genero&s;ity the Shepherde&s;s had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him; and in &s;hort, what the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI>
had done. The King, overjoy'd at this relation,
ran to acquaint the Queen of it. &startq;Without doubt,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> this Boy and Girl are above the Vulgar;
their eminent Perfections, their Beauty, and the
Care of the Fairy <HI>Amazona,</HI> &s;hews &s;omething
extraordinary.&endq; This di&s;cour&s;e put the Queen in
mind of the Diamond-Ring <HI>Carpillona</HI> had given her.
&startq;I have always forgot, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> to &s;hew you a
Ring which this young Shepherde&s;s put into my
hands with an uncommon Air of Grandeur, de&s;i|ring
me to accept of it, and to furni&s;h her for it
with &s;uch Clothes as they wear in this Country.&endq;
&startq;Is the Stone fine? <HI>replyed the King.</HI>&endq; &startq;I never look'd
much at it, <HI>&s;aid the Queen,</HI> but here it is;&endq; and
pre&s;ented it to him. No &s;ooner had he fix'd his
eyes on it, but he cry'd out, &startq;Ye Gods! what is
this I behold?&endq; &startq;What do you not know a Pre|&s;ent
which I received from your hands?&endq; At the
&s;ame time he touch'd a little Spring, the Diamond
flew up, and the Queen &s;aw her own Picture
which &s;he had drawn to give the King; and which
&s;he had tied about her little Daughter's Neck for
her to play with, when &s;he nur&s;ed her in the
Tower. &startq;Alas! my Dear, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> what &s;trange
Adventure is this! it renews all my Griefs&punc; but
<PB N="212" REF="213">
let us talk to the Shepherde&s;s, and endeavour to
learn more.&endq; Upon this &s;he call'd <HI>Carpillona,</HI> and
&s;aid, &startq;I have waited till now, Child, for a Con|fe&s;&s;ion
from you; which would have given much
more plea&s;ure, had it come from you without
being pre&s;s'd to it: but &s;ince you &s;till continue to
conceal from us who you are, it is proper that
we inform you that we know, and that the Ring
you gave me has di&s;cover'd this Riddle.&endq; &startq;Alas!
Mother, <HI>reply'd the Prince&s;s, falling on her Knees by
her,</HI> it was not for want of Confidence that I con|ceal'd
my Rank from you, but that I thought it
might be a trouble to you to &s;ee a Prince&s;s redu|ced
to my Condition.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My Father was King of the <HI>Peaceable I&s;lands;</HI> but
his Reign being di&s;turbed by an U&s;urper, he, and
my Mother, were both confined in a &s;trong Tow|er.
After three Years Impri&s;onment, they found
the means, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of their Guard,
and the favour of the Night, to e&s;cape. They let
me down in a Basket; but the Cord breaking,
I fell into the Lake which &s;urrounded the Ca&s;tle,
where I was taken up by &s;ome Fi&s;hermen, who
ju&s;t then were drawing in their Nets, which they
had thrown out for &s;ome Carp, which the Moat
was well &s;tored with. But alas! how were the
Fi&s;hermen deceived in their Hopes! for by my
weight they were in expectation of a good
Draught. When they fir&s;t &s;aw me, they thought
of throwing me in again; but at la&s;t they re&s;ol|ved
to leave me in the Net, and carry me to the
Tyrant; who, being informed of the flight of my
Family, knew me to be an unhappy de&s;titute
Prince&s;s. His Wife, who had no Children, pity|ing,
and having &s;ome Inclination for me, took
me, and brought me up under the Name of <HI>Car|pillona,</HI>
perhaps with a de&s;ign that I might have
no notion of my Birth; but my Heart has always
told me who I am: and it is &s;ometimes a Misfor|tune
to have Sentiments &s;o little conformable to
<PB N="213" REF="214">
one's Fortune. But as the greate&s;t Pro&s;perity is
not to be depended on; a neighbouring Prince,
who was crooked, and went by the Name of the
<HI>Humpback's Prince,</HI> coming at the head of a gal|lant
Army, deprived the U&s;urper of my Father's
Crown of his ill-gotten Power. This Change
of the Tyrant's Fortune render'd mine &s;till wor&s;e;
the Conqueror took me with him as the greate&s;t
Ornament of his Triumph, and determined to
marry me, whether I con&s;ented or not. In this
Extremity I betook my&s;elf to flight, dre&s;s'd like a
Shepherde&s;s, and leading a Cow; and was met by the
Prince, who undoubtedly had known me again, if
the Fairy <HI>Amazona</HI> had not generou&s;ly given me a
No&s;e-gay of Gilliflowers to &s;ecure me from my
Enemies. Neither, my good Mother, <HI>continued the
Prince&s;s,</HI> did &s;he do a le&s;s charitable Action in re|commending
me to you; and if I declared not my
Rank &s;ooner, it was not through di&s;tru&s;t, but
only to &s;pare your Grief. Not, <HI>pur&s;ued &s;he,</HI> that
I complain, for I never knew any Tranquillity
till the day I was received by you; and I mu&s;t
own, that a Country-Life is &s;o &s;weet and innocent,
that I prefer it before that of a Court.&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke with great earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;he ob&s;erv'd
not that the Queen melted into Tears, and that the
King's Eyes water'd; but &s;he had no &s;ooner done,
than they both &s;trove to cla&s;p her in their Arms,
where they held her a long time without being
able to pronounce one Word. She melted, and
cry'd after their example; and it is hard to expre&s;s
the agreeable Trouble the&s;e three illu&s;trious Per|&s;ons
were in. At la&s;t, the Queen, making an Effort
upon her&s;elf, &s;aid, &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible, my dear Child,
that after all my Sorrow for thy fatal lo&s;s, Heaven
&s;hould re&s;tore thee to thy Mother, to comfort her
in her Misfortunes. Behold, my Child, the Brea&s;t
that &s;uckled thee in thy tender Youth! Behold
the King thy Father, the Author of thy Days!
With what Tran&s;ports &s;hall we &s;olemnize the
<PB N="214" REF="215">
Return of a Child which Heaven in its Anger
deprived us of?&endq; &startq;and I, illu&s;trious Mother and
Queen, <HI>cry'd the Prince&s;s,</HI> (ca&s;ting her&s;elf at her
Feet) by what Expre&s;&s;ions and Actions &s;hall I
make you both under&s;tand the Love and Re&s;pect
I owe you, &s;ince I find you the dear Sanctuary
to my Misfortunes, when I dur&s;t not flatter my|&s;elf
with ever &s;eeing you again?&endq; Then they all
renew'd their Care&s;&s;es, and thus &s;ome Hours glided
away. <HI>Carpillona</HI> after this retired, having fir&s;t been
forbid by her Father and Mother to &s;peak of what
had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s, in regard to indifferent Per&s;ons,
ob&s;erved their Commands punctually, but could not
keep the Secret from her young Shepherd; &s;o hard
a thing it is to conceal any thing from a Per&s;on
we love. She reproached her&s;elf a thou&s;and times
for not having di&s;cover'd her Birth to him. &startq;How
great would his Obligation have been, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI>
if he had known, that being born to a Throne,
I &s;hould &s;toop &s;o low as to him: But alas! what
difference does Love make between a Scepter and
a Crook? Can this chimerical Grandeur, which
we boa&s;t &s;o much of, can it &s;atisfy our Souls?
No, Virtue alone has there a Right; it &s;ets us
above a Crown, and can free us from it: The
Shepherd that loves me, is wi&s;e, witty, and amia|ble;
what can a Prince be more?&endq; As &s;he aban|don'd
her&s;elf to the&s;e Reflections, &s;he &s;aw him at
her feet, he having follow'd her to the River-&s;ide;
and was pre&s;ented by him with a Garland of Flow|ers,
the Variety of which was charming. &startq;From
whence come you, fair Shepherde&s;s, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I
have been &s;eeking you &s;ome hours, and have
waited &s;ome others with impatience?&endq; &startq;Shepherd,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I have been taken up with a very &s;ur|prizing
Adventure, and reproach my&s;elf for being
&s;o long &s;ilent; but remember, that this Mark of
my Confidence requires an eternal Secrecy. I
am a Prince&s;s, my Father was a King, whom I
<PB N="215" REF="216">
find in the Per&s;on of the Shepherd <HI>Sublimus.</HI>&endq; The
Prince was &s;o confounded and &s;urprized at this
News, that he had not power to interrupt her, tho
&s;he related the Hi&s;tory of her Life with all ima|ginable
Bounty: So great were his Fears, le&s;t this
wi&s;e Shepherd, &s;ince he was a King, &s;hould refu&s;e
him his Daughter; or that &s;he, reflecting on the
Difference between a great Prince&s;s and him&s;elf,
&s;hould fall off &s;ome day from tho&s;e Te&s;timonies of
Kindne&s;s &s;he had given him. &startq;Ah! Madam, <HI>&s;aid
the melancholy Prince,</HI> I am a lo&s;t Man, I mu&s;t re|nounce
this Life: You are born to a Crown, and
have found your Father and Mother. For my
part, I am an unhappy Wretch, that knows nei|ther
his Country or Relations; an Eagle was my
Nur&s;e, and her Ne&s;t my Cradle: if you have had
&s;ome favourable regard to me, it will be return'd
you.&endq; The Prince&s;s mu&s;ed a moment or two, and
without returning any An&s;wer to what he &s;aid,
took her Bodkin out of her Hair, and writ on the
Bark of a Tree:
<Q>Equal Pa&s;&s;ion can your Heart return?</Q></P>
<P>The Prince writ immediately this Ver&s;e:
<Q>A thou&s;and times more ardently I burn.</Q></P>
<P>The Prince&s;s writ under it:
<Q><L>Thank Fortune for this lucky Main,</L>
<L>To love, and to be lov'd again.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Prince, tran&s;ported with Joy, ca&s;t him&s;elf
at her feet, and taking one of her hands, &s;aid,
&startq;Adorable Prince&s;s, you flatter my afflicted Heart,

<PB N="216" REF="217">
without doubt, had been longer, had they
had more time; but they were then obliged to ga|ther
up their Flocks, and return home.</P>
<P>All this time the King and Queen conferred to|gether
upon <HI>Carpillona</HI>'s Behaviour towards the young
Shepherd. While &s;he was unknown to them, they
approved of tho&s;e growing Flames, that kindled in
their Souls; the perfect Beauty wherewith Heaven
had endow'd them, the Wit and Graces which ac|companied
all their Actions, made them de&s;ire an
everla&s;ting Union: But when they looked upon her
with a different eye, as their own Daughter, and
on the Shepherd as an unfortunate Babe, expo&s;ed
to the Fury of the wild Bea&s;ts; they re&s;olved to
tell <HI>Carpillona,</HI> that &s;he &s;hould not entertain him
any more with flattering Hopes, but &s;hould declare
to him, that &s;he would not &s;ettle in that Country.
After this Determination of theirs, the Queen cal|led
her in, and with a great deal of Tenderne&s;s
told her all that had pa&s;s'd: but what words were
capable to calm &s;o violent a Di&s;order? The young
Prince&s;s &s;trove in vain to con&s;train her&s;elf, her Face
was &s;ometimes as red as Scarlet, and another while
as pale as Death; and the langui&s;hing of her Eyes
di&s;cover'd but too much the State &s;he was in. Ah!
how did &s;he then repent her Confe&s;&s;ion? Never|thele&s;s,
&s;he a&s;&s;ured her Mother with great Submi&s;|&s;ion,
that &s;he would obey her Commands; and
then retiring, had much to do to get to her Bed,
where bur&s;ting into Tears, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the Night in
uttering her Complaints and Regrets.</P>
<P>The next Morning &s;he aro&s;e, to lead her Flock
to feed; but in&s;tead of going towards the River,
went directly to a Wood, where lying down upon
the Gra&s;s, and leaning upon her Elbow, &s;he fell
into a deep mu&s;ing: The Prince, who could not
be quiet, where &s;he was not pre&s;ent, &s;ought all a|bout
for her, and finding her, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to
her &s;ight; who no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but &s;he &s;hriek'd
out, as if &s;he had been &s;urprized, and ri&s;ing with
<PB N="217" REF="218">
precipitation, left him without looking once at
him. He &s;tood &s;ome time like one Thunder-&s;truck
at &s;o unu&s;ual a Behaviour; but recovering him&s;elf,
follow'd her, and &s;topping her, &s;aid, &startq;What, Shep|herde&s;s,
would you, in giving me Death, deprive
your&s;elf of the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me expire
before your Eyes? You have changed in re|gard
to your Shepherd, and no longer remember
what you promi&s;ed but ye&s;terday.&endq; &startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid
&s;h$, ca&s;ting her Eyes melancholily upon him,</HI> what Crime
do you accu&s;e me of? I am mi&s;erable, and tied
down by Commands, which I cannot evade: Pity
me, and leave me wherever you &s;ee me.&endq; &startq;Mu&s;t
I, <HI>cry'd he, folding his Arms in an Air of De&s;pair,</HI> mu&s;t
I fly you, Divine Prince&s;s? and can &s;o cruel an
Order, and &s;o little de&s;erved, be pronounced by
you your&s;elf? What would you have become of
me? And can that flattering Hope, to which you
was &s;o willing that I &s;hould abandon my&s;elf, ex|tingui&s;h,
and I live?&endq; At the&s;e words <HI>Carpillona,</HI>
who&s;e Grief was not le&s;s violent than her Lover's,
fell &s;peechle&s;s, and void of Life, at his feet; at
which &s;ight he was agitated with a thou&s;and diffe|rent
Thoughts, but the Condition his beloved Mi|&s;tre&s;s
was in, told him, that her Heart had no part
in the Orders &s;he then gave him, which dimini&s;h'd
in &s;ome mea&s;ure his Sorrows: However, he lo&s;t
not a moment to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; a Spring, which ran
&s;oftly along the Gra&s;s, afforded him Water to throw
in her Face, and &s;ome <HI>Cupids,</HI> who were hid behind
a Bu&s;h, have told their Comrades &s;ince, that he
was &s;o bold as to &s;teal a Ki&s;s. Whether it be true
or not, the charming Shepherde&s;s pre&s;ently open'd
her Eyes, and pu&s;hing her lovely Shepherd from
her, &s;aid, &startq;Fly and be gone, how angry will my
Mother be, if &s;he &s;hould come?&endq; &startq;What, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
mu&s;t I leave you then, to be devoured by Wolves
and Bears; or during a long Swoon, to be &s;tung
in this &s;olitary Place by &s;ome Serpent or A&s;pick.&endq;
<PB N="218" REF="219">
&startq;Yes, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> we mu&s;t hazard all, rather than di&s;|plea&s;e
the Queen.&endq;</P>
<P>During this Conver&s;ation, in which their tender
Looks had no &s;mall &s;hare; the Fairy, their Pro|rectrix,
appear'd in the King's Chamber, arm'd as
before, and addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the Queen, &s;aid,
&startq;You are no ways grateful, Madam, for the Pre|&s;ent
I made you of your Daughter, who would
have been drowned in the Net but for me, &s;ince
you are upon the point of killing with Grief the
young Shepherd (with whom I tru&s;ted you:)
Think not of the Difference that may be between
him and <HI>Carpillona,</HI> it is time to unite them; think,
illu&s;trious <HI>Sublimus, &s;aid &s;he to the King,</HI> of their
Marriage, I wi&s;h it, and you will have no rea&s;on
to repent it.&endq; After the&s;e words, without waiting
for an An&s;wer, &s;he left them nothing remaining to
their View, but long Rays of Light, like tho&s;e of
the Sun.</P>
<P>The King and Queen were equally &s;urprized,
and both felt a &s;ecret Joy, that the Fairy's Com|mands
were &s;o po&s;itive. &startq;It is no longer to be
doubted, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> but that this unknown
Shepherd is of a Birth agreeable to <HI>Carpillona,</HI>
&s;ince their Protectrix has too much Ju&s;tice to u|nite
two Per&s;ons of unequal Rank. 'Twas &s;he
that &s;aved our Child in the Lake, where &s;he mu&s;t
inevitably have peri&s;h'd. How have we de&s;erved
her Protection?&endq; &startq;I have often heard &s;ay, <HI>reply'd
the Queen,</HI> that there are good and ill Fairies, and
that they have a Friend&s;hip or an Aver&s;ion to Fa|milies,
according to their Genius, and certainly
<HI>Amazona</HI> is favourable to us.&endq; As they were talk|ing
in this manner, the Prince&s;s came in, a droop|ing
langui&s;hing Air appearing in her Face. The
Prince, who dur&s;t not follow her, but at a di&s;tance,
came &s;ome time after; but &s;o great Melancholy
hung upon him, that it was &s;ufficient to look at
him, to know all that pa&s;s'd in his Soul: and du|ring
Dinner-time the&s;e two poor Lovers, who u&s;ed
<PB N="219" REF="220">
to make all the Mirth, open'd not their Mouths,
nor dur&s;t they &s;o much as look at one another.
When the Cloth was taken away, the King went
into his little Garden, and bid the Shepherd follow
him. At this Order he turn'd pale, an extraordi|nary
&s;hivering glided thro his Veins, and <HI>Carpillona</HI>
was afraid her Father was going to &s;end him away;
&s;o dreadful were both their Apprehen&s;ions. <HI>Sub|limus</HI>
went into a green Arbour, where &s;itting
down, and looking upon the Prince, he &s;aid, &startq;Son,
you know with what Love I have brought you
up; I have always regarded you as a Pre&s;ent made
me by the Gods, to &s;upport and comfort me in
my old Age: but a greater Proof of my Friend|&s;hip
to you, is the Choice I make of you for my
Daughter <HI>Carpillona,</HI> the Lo&s;s of whom you have
heard me &s;o often deplore; but that &s;ame Provi|dence
that re&s;tored her to me, has ordained her
for you.&endq; &startq;Ah! Father, <HI>cry'd the Prince, ca&s;ting him|&s;elf
at his feet,</HI> dare I flatter my&s;elf with what I
hear? Am I &s;o happy as to be your Choice, or
is this only to know my Sentiments for that beau|tiful
Shepherde&s;s?&endq; &startq;No, my dear Son, <HI>&s;aid the
King,</HI> float no longer thus between Hope and Fear;
I am re&s;olved to celebrate your Nuptials within a
few days.&endq; &startq;You heap too many Obligations up|on
me, <HI>reply'd the Prince, embracing his Knees;</HI> and
if I do not &s;ufficiently explain my Acknowledg|ments,
it proceeds from the Exce&s;s of Joy.&endq; The
King made him ri&s;e, profe&s;s'd great Value and
Friend&s;hip for him; and tho he did not acquaint
him with the Greatne&s;s of his Rank, he &s;aid enough
to let him know, that his Birth was much above
his pre&s;ent Condition.</P>
<P><HI>Carpillona</HI> could not be ea&s;y, but mu&s;t follow them
into the Garden, where &s;he ob&s;erved all that pa&s;s'd
from behind &s;ome Trees; and &s;eeing her Lover at
her Father's feet, &s;he believed he might be intreat|ing
him not to condemn him to a cruel Bani&s;hment;
and de&s;iring to know no more, fled into the For|re&s;t,
<PB N="220" REF="221">
running like a Fawn before the Dogs, fearing
neither the Fiercene&s;s of the wild Bea&s;ts, nor the
Thorns or Briars, which tore her on all &s;ides. The
Echoes repeated her Complaints, and &s;he$&s;eem'd to
&s;eek nothing but Death; in the mean time her
Shepherd, impatient to tell her the joyful News,
made all imaginable ha&s;te to follow her, and find
her out. &startq;Where are you, my Shepherde&s;s, <HI>cry'd
he,</HI> where are you, my lovely <HI>Carpillona;</HI> if you
hear me, fly me not, we &s;hall both be happy.&endq;
In pronouncing the&s;e words, he perceived her, &s;ur|rounded
in the bottom of a Vale by &s;everal Hunt|ers,
who were endeavouring to put her behind a
little hump-back'd Man: at this sight, and the Cries
of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, who wanted a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he flew like
an Arrow out of a Bow, and having no other Arms
but his Sling, he let fly a Stone, which hit the
crooked Prince full on his Forehead, and knock'd
him off his Hor&s;e, who brought the Prince&s;s down
with him. By that time the Prince came to them
him&s;elf, and endeavour'd to defend his dear Shep|herde&s;s
again&s;t tho&s;e Ravi&s;hers; but all his Re&s;i&s;t|ance
was to no purpo&s;e, they took him as well as
her, and had &s;acrificed him to their Rage, had not
the crook-back'd Prince made a &s;ign to them to
&s;ave him, that he might put him to the mo&s;t cruel
Torments: So that they then only contented them|&s;elves
with binding him and the Prince&s;s, and in
&s;uch a manner, that they could talk to one another;
and after having made a &s;ort of a Litter to carry
their wounded Prince in, went away, without be|ing
&s;een by any of the Shepherds, who might have
given <HI>Sublimus</HI> an account of the Misfortune of
the&s;e young Lovers. Notwith&s;tanding, we may ea|&s;ily
imagine his and the Queen's Concern, when
Night came, and they &s;aw them not; who, with
all the Shepherds of that Neighbourhood, &s;ought
&s;everal days for them.</P>
<P>Now before I proceed any further, it will not
be ami&s;s to &s;ay, that the crooked Prince had not
<PB N="221" REF="222">
forgot <HI>Carpillona,</HI> and that when he was not em|ploy'd
with the Affairs of State, or acting &s;ome
horrid Murder, he u&s;ed to go a Hunting, and &s;tay
out for &s;even or eight days. It was at one of the&s;e
long Huntings that he &s;aw the Prince&s;s cro&s;s a
Path; and the Liveline&s;s of her Grief made her
give &s;o little attention to what might befal her,
that &s;he took not the No&s;egay of Gilliflowers
with her: &s;o that he knew her as &s;oon as he &s;aw
her.</P>
<P>But to return to the Shepherd and Shepherde&s;s:
The Shepherd cry'd out, &startq;Alas! this is the greate&s;t
of all Misfortunes; we were ju&s;t upon the point
of being united together.&endq; And then he told her
all that pa&s;s'd between <HI>Sublimus</HI> and him. It is no
hard matter to comprehend the Regret of <HI>Carpillona,</HI>
who bur&s;ting forth afre&s;h into Tears, &s;aid, &startq;I &s;hall
co&s;t you your Life, I lead you, for whom I
would &s;pill the la&s;t Drop of my Blood to a hor|rid
Puni&s;hment: I am the Cau&s;e of this Misfor|tune,
and, thro my own Imprudence, have fallen
into the inhuman hands of my mo&s;t cruel Per&s;e|cutor.&endq;</P>
<P>With this kind of Di&s;cour&s;e they entertain'd one
another till they arrived at the Capital City, where
the good old King, the Father of this wicked and
crooked Prince, was inform'd that his Son was
brought in a Litter, having received, by a Stone
out of a Sling, a Wound from a young Shepherd,
in defence of a Shepherde&s;s, and was in great dan|ger.
At this News the King was very much con|cern'd,
and order'd the Shepherd to be put into a
Dungeon; and the like Fate the Prince&s;s <HI>Carpillona</HI>
underwent, by a private Order of the Prince, who
re&s;olved to make her con&s;ent to marry him, or to
put her to the &s;evere&s;t Torments: But it &s;eemed
that the&s;e two Lovers were only parted by a &s;light
Partition, the Boards of which being not joined
clo&s;e, they had the Satisfaction of &s;eeing each other
when the Sun &s;hone in at Noon, and the Remainder
<PB N="222" REF="223">
of their time had the more liberty to entertain
their Sorrows. They &s;aid all the tender and pa&s;|&s;ionate
things Hearts &s;o deeply touch'd could in|vent,
and expre&s;s'd them&s;elves in &s;uch moving
Terms, that they often di&s;&s;olved into Tears. The
Creatures of the Prince came every day to the
Prince&s;s, to threaten her with a &s;peedy Death, if
&s;he did not accept the Honour he did her. She re|ceived
all their Propo&s;als with a Firmne&s;s of Mind,
and an Air of Di&s;dain, in&s;omuch that they began to
de&s;pair of their Undertaking. &startq;Fear nothing, my
dear Shepherd, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> the Dread of the mo&s;t
cruel Torments cannot make me unfaithful; we
will die together, if we cannot live &s;o.&endq; &startq;Fair
Prince&s;s, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> do you think to comfort me?
Alas! would it not be more ea&s;y to me to &s;ee you
in the Arms of this Mon&s;ter, than in the Hands
of an Executioner?&endq; In &s;hort, the&s;e Sentiments of
his were not reli&s;h'd by her; &s;he accu&s;ed him of
Weakne&s;s, and a&s;&s;ured him &s;he would &s;hew him an
Example, and die with Courage.</P>
<P>The Prince's Wound growing better, his Love,
enraged with the continual Denials of the Prince&s;s,
made him re&s;olve to &s;acrifice her, with the young
Shepherd, to his Rage; and to that end appointed
a Day for this di&s;mal Tragedy, and de&s;ired the
King, and all the Lords of the Kingdom, to be
pre&s;ent: and for him&s;elf, he came in an open Lit|ter,
to glut his Eyes with this horrid Sight. The
King, not knowing the Prince&s;s <HI>Carpillona</HI> was a
Pri&s;oner, when he &s;aw her bound with her Go|verne&s;s,
who was condemn'd to &s;uffer the &s;ame
Fate as her&s;elf and Shepherd, who appeared as
bright as the Sun; he ordered them to be brought
to him upon the Terra&s;s, where he was with his
Court, and not waiting for the Prince&s;s's making
her Complaint for the ill and ba&s;e U&s;age &s;he had
had, cut the Cords wherewith &s;he was bound, and
afterwards looking upon the Shepherd, found his
Bowels earn with Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion:
<PB N="223" REF="224">
&startq;Ra&s;h Youth, <HI>&s;aid he, &s;peaking to him with all the
Har&s;hne&s;s he was ma&s;ter of,</HI> what could in&s;pire thee
with &s;o much Boldne&s;s, as to attack &s;o great a
Prince, and to reduce him almo&s;t to Death?&endq; The
Shepherd &s;hewing an awful Re&s;pect, and a Confi|dence
unknown to him before, reply'd, and &s;aid
with a wonderful Intrepidity, &startq;Great Monarch,
the Danger which I &s;aw that fair Prince&s;s in,
was the occa&s;ion of this ra&s;h Action; I knew not
your Son, and much le&s;s in an Attempt &s;o vio|lent,
and &s;o much below a Prince.&endq; As he &s;poke,
he invigorated his Di&s;cour&s;e, by rai&s;ing his Voice
and his Ge&s;ture, wherein his Arm lay bare, and
the Arrow, wherewith he was marked, appeared
too vi&s;ible, not to be perceived by the King; who
cry'd out, &startq;O Heavens! am I deceived? or have I
found my Son again, whom I had lo&s;t?&endq; &startq;No,
Great King, <HI>&s;aid the Fairy</HI> Amazona, <HI>mounted in the
Air upon a &s;tately Hor&s;e,</HI> you are not deceived; be|hold
thy Son, whom I pre&s;erved in an Eagle's
Ne&s;t, where he was carried by the Order of his
barbarous Brother, for the Lo&s;s of whom he mu&s;t
be thy Comfort.&endq; And as &s;he made an end of
the&s;e words, flew at the guilty Prince, and with
her Lance pierced his Heart, which reduced him
pre&s;ently to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>After this the Fairy went to the Terra&s;s, and
pre&s;ented the Prince, no longer now a Shepherd,
with a Suit of Armour, &s;aying to him, &startq;The&s;e
I promi&s;ed thee, and with the&s;e thou &s;halt be
invulnerable, and the greate&s;t Warriour in the
World.&endq; Hereupon there were heard in the Air
the Soundings of Trumpets, and all manner of war|like
In&s;truments, which were follow'd with a &s;oft
and melodious Symphony to Words in the prai&s;e of
the Prince and Prince&s;s. The Fairy alighted from
off her Hor&s;e, placed her&s;elf by the King, and de|&s;ired
him to give Orders for &s;olemnizing the Mar|riage;
and then commanded a Genius, that appear'd
at her Call, to go and fetch the illu&s;trious and
<PB N="224" REF="225">
royal Shepherd and his Family; which immediately
went, and return'd with them. What a Satisfaction
was this, after &s;uch long Troubles! The Palace
was fill'd with Cries of Joy, and none was ever
equal to that of the&s;e two Kings and their Chil|dren.
The Nuptials were celebrated with great
Magnificence; after which the kind Fairy took her
leave, and di&s;appear'd. The King <HI>Sublimus</HI> return'd
to his own Dominions, <HI>Carpillona</HI> lived with her
dear Spou&s;e in all imaginable Plea&s;ure, and the
old King, overjoy'd to &s;ee a Son &s;o worthy of his
Love, grew young again with the Satisfaction he
enjoy'd, and lengthen'd out his days &s;ome time
longer.</P>

<HEAD>The Continuation of the Story of the New
Gentleman-Citizen.</HEAD>
<P>THE Story of the Prince&s;s <HI>Carpillona</HI> was too
well liked and approved of by all the Com|pany,
for them to be impatient for their Dinner;
and ju&s;t as it was made an end of, Madam <HI>de St.
Thomas</HI> appear'd at the end of the Walk, ru&s;ling in
her &s;tiff Silks. And as &s;he always loved to be
&s;omewhat &s;ingular, and having &s;een on Skreens and
Fans, Blacks carrying Umbrelloes, &s;he bethought
her&s;elf of providing one; and to that end made
choice of a Farmer's little Boy, who had very much
the Features, and rubbed his Face and Hands over
with Soot and Ink; but when the Soot came upon
his Lips, the Bitterne&s;s was &s;o great, that he would
not &s;uffer both to be black'd, but only the under
one. The Barone&s;s then made another Exception
again&s;t the length of his Hair, but the Farmer's
Wife would not let it be cut off; but in &s;hort, af|ter
<PB N="225" REF="226">
&s;everal Threats, my Lady was forced to &s;ub|mit,
and this new-moulded Black carried her Um|brello.</P>
<P>The Baron knew nothing of all this, but when
&s;he made her Appearance, they all, except her Hu&s;|band,
bur&s;t out into Laughter; for the Black, with
his red Lip and long Hair, was no le&s;s &s;ingular in
his kind, than &s;he was in hers. The&s;e <HI>Paris</HI> Dames,
who affected as much Freedom and Coquetry, as
&s;he Preci&s;ene&s;s and Formality, ro&s;e up immediate|ly,
and running with open Arms, and embracing her
till they had like to have &s;tifled her, &s;aid, &startq;Good-morrow,
dear Madam, how glad are we to &s;ee
you! You have heard of the Accident that befel
our Coach, which underwent the &s;ame Fate as
<HI>Phaeton</HI>'s Chariot.&endq; &startq;You mean, Ladies, <HI>an&s;wer'd
Madam</HI> St. Thomas, <HI>with an Air of Contempt and In|&s;truction,
Apollo</HI>'s, who was &s;o imprudent as to lend

Chariot, but that which <HI>Apollo</HI> lent him.&endq; &startq;O Ma|dam,
<HI>&s;aid the Widow,</HI> you are Mi&s;tre&s;s of an Ex|actne&s;s,
of which I am not &s;o mindful.&endq; &startq;Yes,
<HI>reply'd the Barone&s;s,</HI> we want no more that here in
the Country, than they who live in Town.&endq; &startq;And
why &s;o much good Sen&s;e?&endq; <HI>an&s;wer'd Madam</HI> de
&startq;Lure.&endq; &startq;I pretend to as much, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Ba|rone&s;s,</HI>
and know as well when I read it, and
&s;peak it.&endq;</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI> knowing his Wife to be
very nice upon the point of Ceremony, never di&s;|puted
but that &s;he was chagrin'd, that a Citizen
richly dre&s;s'd, as Madam <HI>Rouet</HI> was, &s;hould u&s;e &s;o
much freedom as to &s;ay my Dear at the fir&s;t word;
and fearing a Rupture, pre&s;ented his Hand to the
new-married Lady, and obliged the Vi&s;count to do
the &s;ame by the Widow. The Prior, after their
example, offer'd to help the Barone&s;s forward, who,
di&s;plea&s;ed with that Expre&s;&s;ion, and being out of
humour before, &s;aid, with Fire in her Eyes, &startq;What,
am I &s;o weak or old, as to &s;tand in need of a

Support, or is this a de&s;ign'd Affront?&endq; To which
he, knowing &s;he wanted an Excu&s;e to fall out with
&s;omebody, made no Reply. However, &s;he &s;till
grumbled to her&s;elf, and &s;eeing that the&s;e Ladies
looked upon her Black with great Surprize, and
had &s;omething to do to con&s;train their Laughter
again; &s;he &s;aid. &startq;Ladies, you &s;eem amazed at
&s;omething that belongs to me; pray what is it?&endq;
&startq;Upon my word, <HI>&s;aid Madam</HI> de Rouet, I never in
my life &s;aw &s;uch a Black as this at <HI>Paris.</HI>&endq; &startq;O

can be right but what comes from thence.&endq;
&startq;But, <HI>&s;aid Madam</HI> de Lure, you will allow this
Boy's Paint to be extraordinary.&endq; &startq;Indeed,
<HI>reply'd the Barone&s;s, laughing in her turn,</HI> &s;ome daub
with White, and &s;ome with Black.&endq; Madam <HI>de
Rouet,</HI> applying this piece of Plea&s;antry to her&s;elf,
return'd it again with Intere&s;t; which put the Ba|ron,
who was a Man of good Manners, into &s;ome
pain, that this fir&s;t Vi&s;it &s;hould be attended with
&s;uch piquant Reflections: he therefore endeavour'd
to repair all by his Prai&s;es, which being given <HI>$
propos,</HI> created a more &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure in the&s;e La|dies,
than his Wife's ill Temper had given them
Chagrin; who made an Excu&s;e, after Dinner, to go
into her Chamber for &s;omething &s;he had forgot.
But as they talked on various Subjects, at la&s;t the
Di&s;cour&s;e happening to fall on <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> the
Prior told very agreeably all his Quarrels with his
Neighbour and Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> and his great Inclina|tions
to <HI>D$n-Quixot$&s;m;</HI> and we may be &s;ure <HI>Alain</HI>'s
$o$leries were not forgot.</P>
<P>The Stories that were told of him, rai&s;ed in
the&s;e Ladies a great De&s;ire to &s;ee him: which the
Baron told them might ea&s;ily be done, if they
would give them&s;elves the trouble to go up into
his Chamber. &startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI> I'll go and
tell him of the Vi&s;it you intend him, that he may
be prepared, and arm him&s;elf.&endq; &startq;What, Sir, <HI>re|ply'd
the Widow,</HI> mu&s;t he arm to receive us? Sure
<PB N="227" REF="228">
he will not fight with Women.&endq; &startq;No, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI>
he is far from doing that, for he is as courteous
as any Knight-Errant.&endq; Then he left them, to
tell <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> what charming Ladies there were,
and charged him, above all things, not to find
fault with their Dialect, &s;ince they came from <HI>Pa|ris;</HI>
where four and twenty hours Re&s;idence was
&s;ufficient to &s;upply them with Wit all the re&s;t of
their Lives, and that they could not have a more
competent Judge than him&s;elf, who having been
born there, mu&s;t have &s;ucked in with his Nur&s;e's
Milk, Wit and Politene&s;s, and the Loves and Gra|ces.
&startq;I don't know whether you may believe it,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, but nothing is more true;
for, in my opinion, I have &s;uch Thoughts, as no
other Per&s;on bath like me: I have Sentiments &s;o
delicate, that they plainly make it appear, they
proceed from a delicate Soul; and Delicacy de|fines
both the outward and inward Man.&endq; &startq;I
under&s;tand you, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI> you de&s;ire, &s;ince
the&s;e Ladies are of <HI>Paris,</HI> pa&s;&s;ionately to &s;ee them;
and I'll go and acquaint them &s;o.&endq; &startq;Hold, hold,
Sir, <HI>cry'd the Cit,</HI> I am in Bed, all undre&s;s'd, and
feel a noble Shame; you know I &s;pend all my
time upon my Studies, and reflecting upon my
Misfortunes: but give me leave to turn my Shirt,
or lend me one of yours.&endq; &startq;I believe, <HI>&s;aid the
Prior, maliciou&s;ly,</HI> you had better arm your&s;elf,
which may impo&s;e on them; for every Man
arm'd in Bed, may bo$&s;t of plea&s;ing the Ladies;
for the Sex, though timorous them&s;elves, e&s;teem
Courage, and love Heroes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Quick, quick, <HI>Alain,</HI> my Armour, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dan|dinardiere,
my Turban, and my Brea&s;t-Plate.&endq;
&startq;What, Sir, <HI>reply'd the Valet,</HI> have you a mind to
lame your&s;elf? that na&s;ty hard Bed&s;tead of yours,
has almo&s;t flea'd you already; and when you have
tho&s;e Bodice on, you will be&endq;&mdash;&startq;Wretch,
<HI>cry'd his Ma&s;t$r,</HI> thou will never be fit to gaher
any thing but Thi&s;tles in the Field of <HI>Mars,</HI> &s;ince
<PB N="228" REF="229">
thou call'&s;t tho&s;e military Arms, which are to a|dorn
me like a <HI>Roman</HI> Dictator, Bodice: how can&s;t
thou &s;peak in &s;o low a Style?&endq; &startq;I be&s;eech you,
Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI> not &s;o much of your lofty Ex|pre&s;&s;ions;
the Ladies wait.&endq; &startq;Alas! Sir, <HI>an|&s;wer'd</HI>
Dandinardiere; what Ears have you, that
nothing can offend them? For my part, my
Valet's Ab&s;urdities &s;tun me as much as an Ala|rum
Bell; I cannot bear a wry Word: And, was
I to merit a Kingdom to hear Words ill-apply'd,
and all manner of Barbari&s;ms, I &s;hould renounce
it.&endq; &startq;O! Sir, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI> the Languages are
infinitely obliged to you; and I hope you will
meet with no Ingratitude: for in &s;hort, I un|der&s;tand,
(but I'd have you be &s;ecret) that the
Learned intend to write your Life.&endq; &startq;O! Sir,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, <HI>tran&s;ported with the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible
Plea&s;ure Man could be capable of,</HI> I cannot doubt,
but what you &s;ay is truth, &s;ince I have always
received tho&s;e Gentlemen hand&s;omely at my Table.
It is certain, that <HI>Homer, Herod$$us, Plutarch, Sene|ca,
Voiture, Corneille,</HI> and even <HI>Harlequin</HI> him&s;elf,
have dined above thirty time$ with me, and have
made me ready to die with laughter; be&s;ides, I
took their coming without Ceremony, as a par|ticular
Favour; and always left orders with my
Steward, when I was either with the Army, or
at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> to keep the &s;ame Table: But is it
po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould remember &s;o &s;light a
mark of my Friend&s;hip? Well, I think I am well
rewarded: and indeed, I could not have thought
they would have remembred a Country Philo&s;o|pher,
like me.&endq; &startq;The Rea&s;on is, <HI>reply'd the Prior,
ready to bur&s;t $is &s;ides,</HI> becau&s;e you are a Phi|lo&s;opher;
I am glad to hear, you keep company of
&s;uch Merit, <HI>Cato</HI> is very plea&s;ant and merry.&endq; &startq;I
don't very well know <HI>Cato, reply'd the learned Cit,</HI>
I think he came not &s;o often as the re&s;t.&endq; &startq;Ah!
but, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI> he is one of your Friends; and
it is re&s;olved by them, to write of whatever has
pa&s;s'd, that's memorable, in your Life: but there
<PB N="229" REF="230">
is one thing they boggle at, and that is, you are
too covetous.&endq; &startq;As times go now, <HI>reply'd the other,
&s;omewhat chagrin'd,</HI> it is no fault; for if I &s;hould
throw away all I have, I might hang my&s;elf af|terwards.
Believe me, Sir, Heroes neither &s;ow
nor &s;pin; they know not that happy Arithmetick
of making four of two, therefore they ought to
keep what they have.&endq; &startq;Prudence, <HI>&s;aid the Prior,</HI>
mu&s;t be commended by all the World, and your
Hi&s;torians will be &s;ure not to forget yours; but
when they come to &s;peak of your Marriage, how
would you have them to mention it? Shall they
&s;ay, you was de&s;perately in love with a Lady of
great Quality and Worth; but that, becau&s;e &s;he
had not a great Fortune, you would not have her?
That will &s;ound but very ba&s;e.&endq; &startq;Ha! ha! <HI>&s;aid</HI>
Dandinardiere; Who de&s;ired them to write my
Hi&s;tory? Had I been fond of Prai&s;es, do you
think I &s;hould have left <HI>Paris,</HI> where they &s;o
much abound, to bury my&s;elf here in the Coun|try,
where they value them&s;elves, upon &s;aying
the harde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;hocking things to one's face?
and though &s;ometimes I don't an&s;wer that Cha|racter,
yet I can return An&s;wers with as much
Violence as other People; but I avoid Quarrels.&endq;
&startq;I under&s;tand you, Mr. <HI>Dandinardiere, &s;aid the Prior;</HI>
this Freedom of mine is no way plea&s;ing to you:
but it is owing to my Re&s;pect for you, I would
wi&s;h you a compleat Gentleman; which you ne|ver
can be, with that Foundation of Covetou&s;ne&s;s,
which&endq;&mdash;Here <HI>Dandinardi$$$,</HI> vex'd to the
Soul, interrupted him, and told him, that he had
forgot the Ladies, who &s;ent him, and de&s;ired him
to conduct them to him, that their Di&s;cour&s;e might
be more plea&s;ant and $iverting.</P>
<P>The Prior ran immediately to them, who waited
with impatience; and told them, with a &s;erious face,
great part of their Conver&s;ation, but dur&s;t not
make too great a Je&s;t of the Cit before Madam <HI>de
St. Thomas,</HI> who would have taken his part, back and
<PB N="230" REF="231">
edge. The Vi&s;iters went pre&s;ently to <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s
Chamber, who made &s;o ridiculous a figure, that
the grave&s;t Per&s;on would have found it an hard
task, to have pre&s;erved a &s;erious Countenance:
His No&s;e and Cheeks were cruelly &s;cratch'd, and
withal, &s;o red and bloated, that he look'd like a
Trumpeter after a long Bla&s;t: be&s;ides, his Turban
was no le&s;s to be admired than his Armour. As
Madam <HI>de Rouet</HI> was the fir&s;t that enter'd the
Room&punc; &s;he made him a very low Courte&s;y; but
when &s;he ca&s;t her Eyes upon him, &s;he was &s;ur|prized
to f$nd him to be her Cou&s;in <HI>Cr$&s;t$flet,</HI> a
Trade&s;man in <HI>St. Dennis-&s;treet.</HI> They both &s;eem'd
to e$pre&s;s a great Joy, and embracing each other,
whi&s;per'd &s;ilence: for the Cou&s;in <HI>Rouet</HI> was as much
afraid of being known, as Cou&s;in <HI>Cri&s;toflet.</HI> But as
&s;he had been inform'd of his Maggots a long time,
and had heard that, in &s;pite of all his Friends could
&s;ay to him, he was re&s;olv'd, after Fortune had ca&s;t
an au&s;picious $ook on him, to &s;et up for a fine Gen|tleman,
and being her&s;elf no le&s;s guilty of the &s;ame
Folly, &s;he was the more inclined to excu&s;e him.
They both talk'd of nothing but their Ance&s;tors,
how one's Great-Uncle was a Duke, the other's a
Marqui&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was as much matter of fact,
as <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s entertaining the &s;even Sages of
<HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>All the Company was very much &s;urprized, to
&s;ee <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> and the Widow &s;o great: The
Baron was vex'd at what he told her, fearing it
might be &s;ome Ob&s;tacle to the Marriage; for tho
he &s;eem'd to be very indifferent, yet in the main
he was very de&s;irous it might be: He expre&s;s'd a
great Joy to &s;ee them at a time when he &s;o little
expected them. &startq;Indeed, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, when
I left the Court, I took care to conceal my Re|treat
from my deare&s;t Friends, who I knew would
be concern'd for my Ab&s;ence; and I mu&s;t needs
&s;ay, I was grieved my&s;elf.&endq; &startq;You cannot ima|gine,
<HI>&s;aid the Widow,</HI> how much it was regretted;
<PB N="231" REF="232">
I know &s;ome of the fine&s;t Ladies of the Court,
who wore the re&s;t of the Year no Ribbands, La|ces,
or coloured Clothes.&endq; &startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinar|diere,
<HI>fetching a deep Sigh;</HI> poor Ladies! it grieves
my Heart.&endq; &startq;There appear'd as much mourning
in their Faces, <HI>continu'd &s;he,</HI> as if it had been for
an Husband.&endq; &startq;Ha! ha! ha! <HI>cry'd the C$t,</HI> what
is this you tell me? Well, I am in pain for that
fair young Dutche&s;s; I &s;hould be incon&s;olable, if
I have di&s;turbed her Repo&s;e: For hitherto, <HI>con|ti$u$d
$word$,</HI> you mu&s;t own, Madam, we have mana|ged
matters &s;o well, that the World has not
been able to penetrate into the Secrets of our
Hearts.&endq; Madam <HI>d$ St. Thom$s</HI> li&s;ten'd &s;ome time
to their Conver$a$ion, but at la&s;t grew impatient,
and approaching the Vi&s;count, &s;aid &s;oftly to him;
&startq;What a Son-in-law is th$s you would per&s;uade us
to? Don't you find that he has five hundred In|trigues
on his hands; it will be an hard matter
to fix him?&endq; &startq;Don't be di&s;gu&s;ted, Madam, <HI>re|ply'd
he,</HI> an Air of Gallantry is agreeable to Cour|tiers;
don't think that they love, more than o|ther
People; their Affections are the harde&s;t to
&s;ettle: they know all the fine Turns of Gallan|try;
&s;igh and per&s;uade, and yet do not love
one whit the better.&endq; &startq;So much the wor&s;e, <HI>&s;aid
the Barone&s;s,</HI> he will deceive us.&endq; &startq;No, Madam,
<HI>continued the Vi&s;count,</HI> he is bred in a Court of more
Sincerity.&endq; &startq;What, <HI>Paris? &s;aid &s;he.</HI>&endq; Here the
Vi&s;count was puzzled, what Court he &s;hould call
<HI>St. Dennis-&s;treet;</HI> when he was freed from the Per|plexity
he was in, by the Arrival of the two young La|dies,
who had been ask'd after, by the&s;e Vi&s;iters,
but could not get them&s;elves dre&s;s'd ready by
dinner-time. They were, without di&s;pute, beauti|ful;
and, if they had not affected fanta&s;tical and ro|mantick
Airs, were very amiable. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> &s;ee|ing
them, made a &s;ign to his Cou&s;in <HI>Rouet,</HI> that
<HI>Virginia</HI> had made a cruel Rent in his Heart; which
engaged her to look more favourable on her, than
<PB N="232" REF="233">
<HI>Marthonida;</HI> who would not have been very well
pleas'd, if Madam <HI>Lure</HI> had not pa&s;s'd a thou&s;and
Compliments upon her. &startq;I ought not to complain,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to her,</HI> of leaving the Court as I
have done, to come into the Country; where I
have the happine&s;s of meeting with a Per&s;on &s;o
charming as your&s;elf.&endq; &startq;Madam, <HI>replied &s;he,</HI> we
&s;trive, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to imitate you; but
our Endeavours are all in vain.&endq; &startq;Ah! what is
it you tell me, my Fair, <HI>cry'd Madam</HI> de Lure,
you are altogether amiable; I &s;ee Rays of Wit
dart from your Eyes, which ravi&s;h me.&endq; The
Widow &s;aid a great many fine things to <HI>Virginia;</HI>
and in &s;hort, they both talked &s;o together, that
they confounded each other. Never were Prai&s;es
deliver'd with a better Air; <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> triumph'd,
and gave his Sentiments open-mouth'd: he was
overjoy'd, that the Widow applauded his growing
Pa&s;&s;ion; and <HI>Virginia,</HI> for her part, u&s;ed all her
Eloquence.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Company li&s;ten'd with great
Attention; but the Barone&s;s was not over-well
plea&s;ed that her Daughters &s;hould engro&s;s all the
Prai&s;es; for &s;he was one that thought all was her
d$e, and look'd upon all the Compliments paid to
others, as injurious to her&s;elf: which put her into
&s;o &s;trange a Mood, that &s;he would &s;ay nothing but
Yes and No. In the mean time the Conver&s;ation,
which could not always be on the Ad$antages of
Beauty, turn'd upon tho&s;e of Wit; which rai&s;ed
new De&s;ires in Madam <HI>de Rouet</HI> and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI>
to offer up their Ince$&s;e; who looking at each
other, admired that inexhau&s;tible Source of great
Words which &s;ignified $$ttle or nothing: when, to
make &s;ome diver&s;ion from the Subject they were
got into, the Vi&s;count told Madam <HI>de St. Thomas,</HI>
that they two were great L$$ers by not being in
the Wood when the Ladies $ead one of the fine&s;t
Stories of the Fairies that ever was made. &startq;What,
<HI>&s;aid the Widow,</HI> are the&s;e Ladies acquainted with
<PB N="233" REF="234">
the&s;e &s;orts of Amu&s;ements; have they got into
the Country already?&endq; &startq;and what do you take
us for, Madam? <HI>an&s;wr'd</HI> Virginia; do you think
that our Climate wants &s;o much the favourable
Influences of &s;ome benevolent Star; and that we
are &s;o very ignorant of what pa&s;&s;es under your
cele&s;tial vaulted Roof? Indeed our Sphere is not
&s;o much limited as you imagine; we know how to
lay our Scenes &s;o well, as that the Author need
not to be a&s;hamed.&endq; &startq;I mu&s;t confe&s;s, <HI>&s;aid the new-married
Lady,</HI> that I did not expect to find the
Mu&s;es and Fairies &s;o familiarly u&s;ed here in the
Country; I &s;hould be overjoy'd to hear how they
are handled.&endq; Upon this, <HI>Marthonida,</HI> who wan|ted
not Merit and a good Opinion of her&s;elf, offer'd
to read a Story which &s;he had ju&s;t made an end of.
&startq;Nothing can be more new, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Virginia, for it
has not yet been corrected.&endq; All the Company
accepted of the Propo&s;ition; and as &s;he had it
about her, &s;he pull'd it out, and began thus:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Perfect Love: A Story.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of tho&s;e agreeable Countries that depend
on the Empire of the Fairies, there reign'd the
formidable <HI>Danamo,</HI> who was as knowing in her
Art, as cruel in her Actions, and boa&s;ted of the
Honour of being de&s;cended from the celebrated
<HI>Calip&s;o,</HI> who&s;e Charms had the Glory and Power of
&s;taying the famous <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> and triumphing over the
Prudence of the Conquerors of <HI>Troy.</HI></P>
<P>She was lu&s;ty, had a wild Look, and her Pride
made her with &s;ome difficulty &s;ubmit to the hard
Laws of Matrimony; for Love was not able to
reach her Heart: but the de&s;ign of uniting a flou|ri&s;hing
Kingdom to that &s;he was Queen of, and
<PB N="234" REF="235">
another &s;he had u&s;urp'd, made her con&s;ent to mar|ry
an old neighbouring King, who died &s;ome few
Years after their Marriage, and left the Fairy a
Daughter call'd <HI>Azira,</HI> who was very ugly; but
appear'd not &s;o in the eyes of <HI>Danamo,</HI> who thought
her charming; perhaps, becau&s;e like her&s;elf. She
was to be the Queen of three Kingdoms; which
Circum&s;tance qualified all her Defects, and cau&s;ed
her to be asked in Marriage by the mo&s;t powerful
Princes of the neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>This, together with the blind Friend&s;hip of <HI>Da|namo,</HI>
render'd her Vanity in&s;upportable, &s;ince &s;he
was de&s;ired with an Ardour which &s;he did in no
wi&s;e de&s;erve. But as <HI>Danamo</HI> though of nothing
but rendring the Prince&s;s's Happine&s;s compleat, &s;he
brought up in her Palace a young Prince, her Bro|ther's
Son; who was called <HI>Parcinus:</HI> he had a no|ble
Air, a delicate Shape, a fine Head of Hair, &s;o
admirably white, that Love him&s;elf might have
been jealous of his Power; for that God never had
golden Shafts more &s;ure of triumphing over Hearts
without re&s;i&s;tance, than the Eyes of <HI>Parcinus.</HI> He
did every thing well, danced and &s;ung extraordi|nary
fine, and gain'd all the Prizes at Tournaments,
whenever he contended for them.</P>
<P>This young Prince was the Delight of the Court;
and <HI>Danamo,</HI> who had her De&s;igns, was not again&s;t
the Re&s;pect and Value they &s;hew'd him. The King
his Father, was the Fairy's Brother, whom &s;he de|clared
War again&s;t without any Pretence what&s;o|ever.
This King fought courageou&s;ly at the head
of his Troops; but what could an Army do again&s;t
&s;o powerful a Fairy as <HI>Danamo?</HI> who &s;uffering the
Victory not to ballance long after her Brother's
Death, who was kill'd in the Action, with one
Stroke of her Wand di&s;per&s;ed her Enemies, and
became Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Parcinus</HI> was then an Infant in Arms; they brought
him to <HI>Danamo,</HI> for it would have been in vain to
have conceal'd him from a Fairy: he had then &s;uch
<PB N="235" REF="236">
engaging Smiles, that they won all Hearts; and
<HI>Danamo</HI> care&s;&s;ing him, in few days after carried him
home with her to her own Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Prince was about eighteen Years old, when
the Fairy, willing to execute what &s;he had &s;o long
de&s;ign'd, re&s;olved to marry him with her Daughter;
and not doubting but the Prince, who was born
one, but by his Misfortunes made a Subject, would
be overjoy'd to become one day a Sovereign of
three Empires, &s;ent for the Prince&s;s, and di&s;co|ver'd
to her the Choice &s;he had made.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s hearken'd to this Di&s;cour&s;e with an
Emotion that made the Fairy think that this Re&s;o|lution
in favour of <HI>Parcinus,</HI> di&s;plea&s;ed her Daugh|ter.
&startq;I &s;ee, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to her, ob&s;erving her Di&s;order in|crea&s;e,</HI>
that your Ambition carries you &s;o far, that
you would add to your Empire the Dominions of
one of tho&s;e Kings, who have demanded you &s;o
often. But what Kings may not <HI>Parcinus</HI> over|come?
His Courage is beyond every thing; the
Subjects of a Prince &s;o accompli&s;h'd, may &s;ome
time revolt in his favour; and by giving you to
him, I make &s;ure of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his King|dom.
And for his Per&s;on, we need not &s;peak of
that; you know the proude&s;t Beauties are not
able to re&s;i&s;t his Charms.&endq;</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s, ca&s;ting her&s;elf &s;uddenly at the feet
of the Fairy, interrupted her Di&s;cour&s;e, and con|fe&s;s'd
to her, That her Heart had not had the

for his Conque&s;t: &startq;But, <HI>added &s;h$, blu&s;hing,</HI> I have
given the in&s;en&s;ible <HI>Parcinus</HI> a thou&s;and Marks of
my Tenderne&s;s, which he receiv'd with a Cold|ne&s;s
that makes me de&s;pair.&endq; &startq;Twas becau&s;e he
dur&s;t not rai&s;e his Thoughts up to you, <HI>reply'd the
proud Fairy,</HI> he was without doubt afraid of di&s;|plea&s;ing
me; I know his Re&s;pect.&endq;</P>
<P>This flattering Opinion was too agreeable to the
Prince&s;s's Inclination and Vanity, for her not to be
per&s;uaded to it. In &s;hort, the Fairy &s;ent for <HI>Par|cinus,</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="237">
who came to her in a magnificent Clo&s;et,
where &s;he, and the Prince&s;s her Daughter, waited
for him; where &s;he &s;aid to him, as &s;oon as &s;he
&s;aw him, &startq;Call all your Courage to your aid; I
&s;ent for you not to continue your Misfortune, but
for your good; reign, <HI>Parcinus:</HI> and to compleat
your Happine&s;s, reign by marrying my Daughter.&endq;
&startq;I, Madam! <HI>cry'd the young Prince in an Amazement,
wherein it was ea&s;y to perceive his Joy had not the grea|te&s;t
&s;hare;</HI> I marry the Prince&s;s, <HI>continued he, falling
back &s;ome Steps,</HI> alas! what God concerns him&s;elf
in my Fate, not to leave it to him alone from
whom I ask a&s;&s;i&s;tance?&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e Words were pronounced by the Prince
with an Heat which his Heart had too great a &s;hare
in, to be with&s;tood by his Rea&s;on. The Fairy
thought that this unlook'd-for Happine&s;s had put
him be&s;ide him&s;elf; but the Prince&s;s loved, and
Love makes Lovers more penetrating than Wi&s;dom
it&s;elf. &startq;What God, <HI>Parcinus, &s;aid &s;he to him with
Di&s;order,</HI> do you &s;o tenderly implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of; I know too well I have no &s;hare in the Vows
you offer up to him.&endq; The young Prince, who
had had time to recover his fir&s;t Surprize, and
who knew he had been guilty of an Imprudence
in what he had done, &s;ummon'd all his Wit to the
aid of his Heart, and an&s;wer'd the Prince&s;s more
gallantly than &s;he hoped for; and thank'd the Fairy
with an Air of Grandeur, that &s;hew'd him not only
worthy of the Empire offer'd him, but that of the
whole World.</P>
<P><HI>Danamo,</HI> and her proud Daughter, who were both
&s;atisfied with this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ettled all things be|fore
they went out of the Clo&s;et: The Fairy defer|red
the Day of the Nuptials, only to give the Court
time to prepare them&s;elves on &s;o great an occa&s;ion.
After this, the News of <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Marriage with
<HI>Azira,</HI> was &s;pread all about the Court; and the
Courtiers came in Crouds to congratulate the
Prince.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">
<HI>Parcinus</HI> receiv'd all their Compliments with an
Air of Coldne&s;s, which very much &s;urprized his
new Subjects, that he &s;hould appear chagrin'd and
out of humour: All the re&s;t of the day he was
perplex'd with the Congratulations of the whole
Court, and the continual Declarations of <HI>Azira</HI>'s
Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What a Condition was the young Prince in, who
was &s;eiz'd with a lively Grief? The Day &s;eem'd to
him a thou&s;and times longer than ordinary. The
impatient <HI>Parcinus</HI> long'd for night, which at la&s;t
came; when with ha&s;te he left that place where he
had &s;uffer'd &s;o much, and went to his own Apart|ment;
and after having &s;ent all his Attendants
away, open'd a Door that led into the Gardens of
the Palace, which he cro&s;s'd, follow'd only by a
young Slave.</P>
<P>A fine, but &s;mall River ran at the end of the&s;e
Gardens, and &s;eparated the Fairy's Palace from a
Ca&s;tle flanked with four Towers, and &s;urrounded
with a deep Ditch that was fill'd by the River:
thither flew <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Wi&s;hes and De&s;ires.</P>
<P>A Wonder was &s;hut up in it; which Trea&s;ure
<HI>Danamo</HI> had carefully guarded. It was a young
Prince&s;s, her Si&s;ter's Daughter, who when &s;he died
left her to the Care of the Fairy; her Beauty,
worthy of the admiration of the whole World, ap|pearing
too dangerous for <HI>Danamo</HI> to permit her
to be &s;een nigh <HI>Azira.</HI> Sometimes the charming
<HI>Irolita,</HI> which was her Name, was &s;uffer'd to come
to the Palace to &s;ee the Fairy, and the Prince&s;s her
Daughter; but was never allow'd to appear in pub|lick:
yet her Charms, tho concealed, were not
unknown to the World.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>Parcinus</HI> had &s;een her with the Prin|ce&s;s
<HI>Azira,</HI> and adored her from that very moment.
Their Nearne&s;s of Blood gave this young Prince no
privilege with <HI>Irolita;</HI> for after &s;he was grown up,
the mercile&s;s <HI>Danamo</HI> permitted none to &s;ee her.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="239">
In the mean time, <HI>Parcinus</HI> burnt with a raging
flame, which the Charms of <HI>Irolita</HI> had kindled;
&s;he was about fourteen Years old; her Beauty was
perfect, her Hair of a fine brown, her Complection
blooming as the Spring; her Mouth delicate, her
Teeth admirably white and even; and her Smiles
engaging, her Eyes were of a fine hazle Colour,
and piercing, and her Looks &s;eem'd to &s;peak a
thou&s;and things her young Heart as yet knew no|thing
of.</P>
<P>She had been brought up in great Solitude, nigh
the Fairy's Palace, in the Ca&s;tle where &s;he lived;
but &s;aw no more of the World than if &s;he had been
in a De&s;art. <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Orders were &s;o exactly obey|ed,
that the fair <HI>Irolita</HI> pa&s;s'd her days only among
tho&s;e Women appointed her, who&s;e number was
very &s;mall, but yet as many as were nece&s;&s;ary in &s;o
lonely and retir'd a Court: however, Fame, which
regarded not <HI>Danamo,</HI> publi&s;h'd &s;o many Wonders
of this young Prince&s;s, that Per&s;ons at the greate&s;t
di&s;tance from the Court, offer'd them&s;elves to be
with the young <HI>Irolita.</HI> And her Pre&s;ence bely'd
not what Fame had reported, &s;ince they always
found her worthy of their Admiration.</P>
<P>A governant of great Wit and Knowledge, for|merly
attach'd to the Prince&s;s her Mother, lived
with her, and often groan'd under the Rigours of
<HI>Danamo</HI> towards the charming <HI>Irolita:</HI> &s;he was cal|led
<HI>Mana;</HI> and her de&s;ire of &s;etting the Prince&s;s at
liberty, and re&s;toring her to her Right and Dignity,
made her yield to <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Love. It was then
three Years &s;ince he was fir&s;t introduced into the
Ca&s;tle in the Habit of a Slave; at which time he
found her in the Garden, and di&s;cover'd to her his
Pa&s;&s;ion; and as &s;he was then but a Child, &s;he lo|ved
<HI>Parcinus</HI> only as a Brother. <HI>Mana,</HI> who was
never ab&s;ent long from her, &s;urprized the young
Prince in the Garden one day, when he acquainted
her with his Love for the Prince&s;s, and the De&s;ign
he had form'd to lo&s;e his Life, or re&s;tore her Liber|ty;
<PB N="339" REF="240">
and &s;eeking, by &s;hewing him&s;elf to his Subjects,
a glorious Revenge on <HI>Danamo,</HI> and placing <HI>Irolita</HI>
on the Throne. As the ri&s;ing Merit of <HI>Parcinus</HI>
was capable of rendring the mo&s;t difficult Projects
credible, and was the only means to deliver <HI>Irolita,
Mana</HI> &s;$ffer'd him to come &s;ometimes to the Ca&s;tle
when it was night; but never let him &s;ee the Prin|ce&s;s,
except in her pre&s;ence. He, with his tender
Di&s;cour&s;e, and his con&s;tant Sedulities, endeavour'd to
in&s;pire in her as violent a Pa&s;&s;ion as his own. Thus
employ'd for three Years, he went almo&s;t every night
to the Ca&s;tle, and &s;pent all the days in nothing but
thinking of his Prince&s;s. But to return to where
we left him cro&s;&s;ing the Gardens, follow'd by a
Slave, and pierced with Grief at the Re&s;olutions of
the Fairy: When he came to the River-&s;ide, a guil|ded
Boat which <HI>Azira</HI> &s;ometimes took the Air in, that
was fa&s;ten'd to the Bank, &s;erved to carry this amo|rous
Prince over. The Slave row'd, and as &s;oon
as <HI>Parcinus</HI> had got up a &s;ilken Ladder, that was
thrown out from off a little Terra&s;s, that fronted
the Ca&s;tle, the faithful Slave row'd the Boat back
again, where he waited for a Signal he made him,
which was to &s;hew him a lighted Flambeau from
off the Terra&s;s. That night the Prince took his
u&s;ual Tour; the &s;ilken Ladder was let down, and
he enter'd without any Ob&s;tacle the young <HI>Irolita</HI>'s
Chamber, whom he found laid on the Bed all in
Tears: but the Beauty that appear'd in that melan|choly
Po&s;ture, had an extraordinary effect on the
Prince!</P>
<P>&startq;What ails my Prince&s;s? <HI>&s;aid he, falling on his
Knees by the Bed-&s;ide wher$on &s;he l$y;</HI> what could
cau&s;e the&s;e precious Tears: Alas! <HI>continued he,
&s;ighing,</HI> have I yet new Misfortunes to hear?&endq; The
Tears and Sighs of the&s;e young Lo$ers were inter|mix'd,
and they were forced to $ent their Pa&s;&s;ion,
before they could tell the $au&s;e of their Grief.
At length the young Prince de&s;ired <HI>Irolita</HI> to tell
him what new Severity the Fairy had u&s;ed to her.
<PB N="240" REF="241">
&startq;She will make you marry <HI>Azira, an&s;wer'd the beau|tiful</HI>
Irolita, <HI>blu&s;hing,</HI> which, of all her Cruelties,
is the mo&s;t painful to me.&endq; &startq;Oh! my dear Prin|ce&s;s,
<HI>cry'd the Prince,</HI> you fear le&s;t I &s;hould marry
<HI>Azira;</HI> my Fate is a thou&s;and times more kind
than I thought it.&endq; &startq;Can you prai&s;e Fate, <HI>re|ply'd
the young</HI> Irolita <HI>langui&s;hingly,</HI> when it is rea|dy
to &s;eparate us? I cannot expre&s;s the Tor|ments,
the Dread of that makes me feel. Oh!
<HI>Parcinus,</HI> you are in the right, the Love of a
Lover, and that of a Brother, is quite different.&endq;
The amorous Prince thought to thank his Fortune,
he never till then knew the Love the young <HI>Irolita</HI>
had for him; and, in &s;hort, could no longer doubt
of the good Fortune of having in&s;pired &s;uch tender
Sentiments into the Prince&s;s. This Happine&s;s,
which he did not expect, rouzed up all his Hopes.
&startq;No, <HI>cry'd he in a Tran&s;port,</HI> I de&s;pair not now of
overcoming our Misfortunes, &s;ince I am a&s;&s;ured
of your Tenderne&s;s. Let us fly, my Prince&s;s, let
us avoid the Rage of <HI>Danamo,</HI> and her hateful
Daughter; let us not tru&s;t to &s;o fatal an Abode,
Love alone will make us happy.&endq; &startq;Should I go
away with you, <HI>reply'd the Prince&s;s with Surprize,</HI>
what would the World &s;ay of my Flight?&endq; &startq;Lay
a&s;ide the&s;e vain Reflections, fair <HI>Irolita, interrupt$d
the impatient</HI> Parcinus, every Circum&s;tance urges
us to leave this Place, let us go&mdash;&endq;&punc; &startq;But
where will you go? <HI>reply'd the prudent</HI> Mana, (who
was always with them, and who, le&s;s engaged than
tho&s;e young Lovers, fore&s;aw all the Difficulties in
their Flight.) &startq;I will give you an account of my
De&s;igns, <HI>reply'd the Prince;</HI> but how did you hear
&s;o &s;oon the News from the Fairy's Court?&endq; &startq;A
Relation of mine, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Mana, writ to me as
&s;oon as it was whi&s;per'd about the Palace, and I
thought it my Duty to inform the Prince&s;s of it.&endq;
&startq;And what have I endured &s;ince? <HI>reply'd the lovely</HI>
Irolita: No, <HI>Parcinus,</HI> I cannot live without you.&endq;
The young Prince, tran&s;ported with Love, and
<PB N="241" REF="242">
charmed with the&s;e words, ki&s;&s;ed <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Hand
with an Ardour and Tenderne&s;s, that had all the
Thanks of a fir&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable Favour. Day
began to appear, and inform'd <HI>Parcinus</HI> too &s;oon,
that it was time he retired, when he a&s;&s;ured the
Prince&s;s he would come again the next Night, and
impart to her his Project; he got to the Boat and
Slave again, and retired to his Apartment. He was
&s;o overjoy'd with the Plea&s;ure of being beloved by
the fair <HI>Irolita,</HI> and agitated by the Difficulties he
fore&s;aw they &s;hould meet with in their Flight,
that Sleep could not calm that Unea&s;ine&s;s, nor make
him forget a moment of his Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was hardly Morning, when a Dwarf enter'd
his Chamber, and pre&s;ented him with a fine Scarf
from the Prince&s;s <HI>Azira,</HI> who by a Billet more ten|der
than he wi&s;h'd for, de&s;ired him to wear from
that day that Scarf. He &s;ent an An&s;wer, which
very much confounded him, but he was obliged to
it, to deliver <HI>Irolita,</HI> and to con&s;train him&s;elf for
her Liberty. When he had &s;ent <HI>Azira</HI>'s Dwarf a|way,
a Giant came from <HI>Danamo,</HI> and pre&s;ented
him with a Sabre of an extraordinary Beauty, the
Handle of which was of one &s;ingle Stone, more
beautiful than a Diamond, and which gave a great
Light in the night; on this Sabre were engraved
the&s;e words:
<Q>For the Hand of a Conqueror.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Parcinus</HI> was mightily plea&s;ed with the Fairy's
Pre&s;ent, and went and thanked her with that and
the Scarf on. The Tenderne&s;s of <HI>Irolita</HI> &s;u&s;pended
all Di&s;quiets, &s;he had rai&s;ed in his Heart that &s;weet
and perfect Satisfaction &s;ucce&s;sful Love feels; a
plea&s;ant Air appeared in all his Actions, which <HI>A|zira</HI>
attributed to her Charms, and the Fairy to
<HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Ambition: the day was &s;pent in Plea&s;ures
and Diver&s;ion, which in no wi&s;e dimini&s;h'd the
in&s;upportable length <HI>Parcinus</HI> thought it.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243">
In the Evening they took the Air in the Gardens
of the Palace, and on the &s;ame River &s;o well known
to the Prince, who, in going in the Boat, felt a
&s;en&s;ible Concern, to &s;ee what difference there was
between the Plea&s;ures it u&s;ed to give him, and the
cruel Torment he then endured. <HI>Parcinus</HI> could
not forbear looking often at the Habitation of the
charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> who never appeared when the Fai|ry
or <HI>Azira</HI> were on the Water. That Prince&s;s,
who watch'd all the Actions of the Prince, ob&s;erv'd
that his Eyes were often turn'd towards the Ca&s;tle.
&startq;What do you look at, Prince? <HI>&s;aid &s;he:</HI> in the
mid&s;t of the Honours done you, is <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Pri&s;on
worthy your Regard?&endq; &startq;Yes, Madam, <HI>reply'd the
Prince, very imprudently,</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible of the Suf|ferings

are too compa&s;&s;ionate, <HI>an&s;wer'd</HI> Azira <HI>di&s;dainfully;</HI>
but to ea&s;e you of your Pain, I can tell you, <HI>Ire|lita</HI>
will not be long a Pri&s;oner.&endq; &startq;And what will
become of her?&endq; <HI>reply'd the young Prince &s;hort.</HI> &startq;The
Queen will marry her in five days to the Prince
<HI>Brutus, return'd</HI> Azira; he is of our Blood, you
know, and according to the Intentions of the
Queen, he will, the next day after their Mar|riage,
carry <HI>Irolita</HI> into a Fortre&s;s, from whence
&s;he will never return to Court.&endq; &startq;What, <HI>&s;aid the
Prince, in an extraordinary Di&s;order,</HI> will the Queen
give that beautiful Prince&s;s to &s;o hideous a Prince,
who&s;e ill Qualities exceed his Deformity? What
Cruelty is this!&endq; This la&s;t word came from him
again&s;t his will, but he could no longer conceal his
Re&s;entment. &startq;I thought that you, of all People,
<HI>Parcinus, an&s;wer'd the Prince&s;s haughtily,</HI> &s;hould not
complain of <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Cruelties.&endq; This Conver&s;a|tion,
without doubt, had been pu&s;hed too far for the
young Prince, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to di&s;&s;emble,
if by good luck the Attendants of <HI>Azira</HI> had not
come up to them, and the Fairy appeared on the
River-&s;ide. <HI>Azira</HI> returned to the Fairy, and <HI>Par|cinus</HI>
coming out of the Boat, feigned to be &s;ick,
<PB N="243" REF="244">
that he might have the more liberty to go and
complain, without any Witne&s;s, of his new Mi&s;|fortunes.</P>
<P>The Fairy, and above all <HI>Azira,</HI> &s;hew'd a great
Unea&s;ine&s;s for his being ill. He retired, accu&s;ing
Fate a thou&s;and times for the Misfortunes that
threaten'd the charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> abandoning him&s;elf
to all his Grief and Tenderne&s;s; but beginning at
length to recover tho&s;e Di&s;orders faithful Lovers
are &s;o &s;ubject to, he writ, in the mo&s;t moving Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
his Love could dictate, to one of his Aunts,
who&s;e Name was <HI>Favourable;</HI> who was a Fairy as
well as <HI>Danamo,</HI> but one who took as much plea|&s;ure
in comforting and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Unfortunate, as
<HI>Danamo</HI> did in making them &s;o. He told her to
what a cruel Condition his Love and Fortune had
reduced him; and not daring to leave <HI>Danamo</HI>'s
Court without di&s;covering his De&s;igns, he &s;ent his
faithful Slave with it.</P>
<P>When every body was retired, he left his Apart|ment
as u&s;ual, and cro&s;&s;ing the Gardens alone, went
into the Boat, without knowing whether he could
row or not; but what will not Love learn us? he
row'd as well as the mo&s;t expert Seaman, and got
into the Ca&s;tle, where he was very much &s;urpriz'd
to find <HI>Mana</HI> only, and &s;he all in Tears, in the
Prince&s;s's Chamber. &startq;What is the matter with
you, <HI>Mana, &s;aid the Prince in ha&s;te,</HI> and where is
my dear <HI>Irolita?</HI>&endq; &startq;Alas! Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Mana, &s;he is

end of the&s;e words, but &s;wooned away as &s;oon as
he under&s;tood the Prince&s;s was gone. <HI>Mana</HI> took
a great deal of pains to bring him to him&s;elf again,
which was no &s;ooner done, but falling &s;uddenly
into a Pa&s;&s;ion, he drew a little Dagger he wore in
his Girdle, and had pierced his Heart, had not the

Live to deliver her from <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Rage. Alas!

went away, and return'd to his own Apartment
with all the Grief &s;o unhappy and tender a Pa&s;&s;ion

threw him&s;elf on when he went in, where Day
&s;urprized him; which had appeared &s;ome Hours,
when he heard a noi&s;e at his Chamber-Door. He
ran with that eager impatience we generally ex|pre&s;s,

had brought a Man who wanted to &s;peak with him
in ha&s;te, and whom he knew to be one of <HI>Mana</HI>'s
Relations: he gave <HI>Parcinus</HI> a Letter, who went
into his Clo&s;et to hide the Trouble it might give
him; where he open'd it, and found the&s;e words:</P>

<HI>Irolita</HI>'s Love? He was &s;o much be&s;ide him&s;elf, that
he had much ado to return a &s;uitable An&s;wer; he
thank'd the prudent <HI>Mana,</HI> inform'd the Prince&s;s of
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he expected from the Fairy <HI>Favourable,</HI>
and &s;aid a thou&s;and things on his Grief and Love:
afterwards he gave the Letter to <HI>Mana</HI>'s Relation,
and with it a Pre&s;ent of fine Jewels of an ine&s;ti|mable
Value, to recompen&s;e him for the plea&s;ure
he had done him. He was &s;carcely gone, when
the Queen and Prince&s;s <HI>Azira</HI> &s;ent to know how
the Prince did; it was ea&s;y to know, by his Looks,
that he was not well; they pre&s;s'd him to go to
bed, which he agreed to, thinking he &s;hould be
le&s;s con&s;train'd than if he went to the Fairy.</P>
<P>After Dinner the Queen went her&s;elf to &s;ee him,
and &s;poke to him of <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Marriage with the
Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> as a thing re&s;olved on. <HI>Parcinus,</HI> who
had at la&s;t re&s;olved to re&s;train him&s;elf, to carry on
his De&s;igns the better, &s;eem'd to approve of the
Fairy's Intentions, and de&s;ired her only to &s;tay till
he was recover'd, becau&s;e he had a great mind to
<PB N="246" REF="247">
be at that Solemnity. The Fairy and <HI>Azira,</HI> who
de&s;pair'd at his Sickne&s;s, promi&s;ed him what he ask|ed;
by which means he retarded the di&s;mal Nuptials
of <HI>Irolita</HI> for &s;ome days. The Conver&s;ation he had
on the Water with <HI>Azira</HI> forwarded the Misfortune
of the Prince&s;s he loved &s;o tenderly, for <HI>Azira</HI> had
given the Queen an account of his Di&s;cour&s;e and his
Compa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Irolita.</HI> And the Queen, who never
delay'd the Execution of her Will, &s;ent that Even|ing
for <HI>Irolita,</HI> and re&s;olved, with <HI>Azira,</HI> to fini&s;h
the Marriage of that Prince&s;s, and to ha&s;ten her
Departure before <HI>Parcinus</HI> had a more e&s;tabli&s;hed
Authority; but in the mean time, before the Expi|ration
of the time, the faithful Slave arrived. How
great was <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Joy, to find in the Letter <HI>Fa|vourable</HI>
had writ, Marks of her Compa&s;&s;ion and
Friend&s;hip for him and <HI>Irolita!</HI> She &s;ent him a lit|tle
Ring, compo&s;ed of four different Metals, Gold,
Silver, Bra&s;s, and Iron; this Ring had the power
of &s;ecuring them four times again&s;t the Per&s;ecutions
of the cruel <HI>Danamo:</HI> and <HI>Favourable</HI> a&s;&s;ured the
Prince, that the wicked Fairy could not pur&s;ue
them oftner than the Ring had power to &s;ave them.
This good News re&s;tored the young Prince to his
Health, he &s;ent in all ha&s;te for <HI>Mana</HI>'s Relation,
and gave him a Letter, that inform'd <HI>Irolita</HI> of the
happy Succe&s;s they might flatter them&s;elves withal.
They had no time to lo&s;e, the Queen was for con|&s;ummating
Prince <HI>Brutus</HI>'s Marriage in three days,
and that &s;ame Night <HI>Azira</HI> made a Ball, and <HI>Irolita</HI>
was to be there. <HI>Parcinus</HI> could not think of being
negligent on that occa&s;ion; he dre&s;s'd him&s;elf in a
magnificent Suit, and appear'd a thou&s;and times
brighter than the Day, but dur&s;t not &s;peak to <HI>Iro|lita,</HI>
except with his Eyes, which often met tho&s;e
of that fair Prince&s;s. <HI>Irolita</HI> had on the noble&s;t
Dre&s;s imaginable; the Fairy had given her very
fine Jewels, and as &s;he had but four Days to &s;tay
in her Palace, re&s;olved to treat her as &s;he ought to
be. Her Beauty, not u&s;ed to be &s;et off with &s;uch
<PB N="247" REF="248">
Ornaments, &s;eem'd wonderful to all, and much
more to the amorous <HI>Parcinus,</HI> who thought, by the
Joy that he &s;aw in her bright Eyes, &s;he had re|ceived
his Letter. The Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> talked often
with <HI>Irolita,</HI> but he appear'd of &s;o ill a Mien under
the Gold and Jewels he was loaded with, that he
was not a Rival worthy of the young Prince's Jea|lou&s;y.
The Ball was almo&s;t over, when <HI>Parcinus,</HI>
tran&s;ported with his Love, de&s;ired, with great ar|dour,
the liberty of talking a moment with the
Prince&s;s. &startq;Cruel Queen, and thou hateful <HI>Azira,
&s;aid he to him&s;elf,</HI> will you deprive me yet longer
of the charming Plea&s;ure of telling the fair <HI>Iro|lita</HI>
a thou&s;and times how I adore her? Why
leave you not, you jealous Witne&s;&s;es of my Hap|pine&s;s,
the Place, &s;ince Love can only triumph in
your Ab&s;ence?&endq; He had hardly form'd this Wi&s;h,
but the Fairy, finding her&s;elf a little out of order,
call'd <HI>Azira,</HI> and went with her into the next Room,
whither Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> follow'd them; <HI>Parcinus</HI> had
then the Ring on his Finger the Fairy <HI>Favourable</HI>
had &s;ent him. He ought to have pre&s;erved the
Succours given him for more pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ions,
but violent Love and Prudence are &s;eldom Compa|nions;
the young Prince thought, by the Fairy's
and <HI>Azira</HI>'s Departure, that the Ring began to fa|vour
his Love: he flew to the charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> and
&s;poke to her of his Pa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t touching and
eloquent Expre&s;&s;ions; when he perceived that he
had made u&s;e of <HI>Favourable</HI>'s Charm &s;illily, but could
not repent of an Imprudence which gain'd him the
plea&s;ure of entertaining his dear <HI>Irolita:</HI> they re|&s;olved
on the Place and Hour to put an end to their
cruel Slavery the next day. The Fairy and <HI>Azira</HI>
return'd again &s;ome time after, <HI>Parcinus</HI> parted with
no &s;mall Regret from <HI>Irolita,</HI> and looking on his
Ring, perceived the Iron was mix'd with the other
Metals, and &s;aw very well that he had but three
Wi&s;hes to make, which he re&s;olved to employ bet|ter
than the fir&s;t for his Prince&s;s; but tru&s;ted none
<PB N="248" REF="249">
with his Departure, but his faithful Slave. The
next day he appear'd to the Queen very ea&s;y, and
more plea&s;ant than ordinary; he pa&s;s'd &s;ome Compli|ments
on the Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> upon his Marriage, and
did it in a manner capable of removing all Su&s;pi|cious
they might entertain of his Pa&s;&s;ion. At two
a-clock in the Morning he went to the Fairy's
Park, where he found his faithful Slave, who, ac|cording
to his Ma&s;ter's Orders, had brought four of
his Hor&s;es. The Prince waited a little, when the
lovely <HI>Irolita</HI> came wearied, and leaning on <HI>Mana;</HI>
for that young Prince&s;s endured &s;o much in the
Walk, that Love alone, without <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Cruel|ties,
and the ill Qualities of Prince <HI>Brutus,</HI> would
not have been capable to have made her undertake
it. It was then Summer, the Night was clear, and
the Moon and Stars &s;hined &s;o bright, that it was
as light as Day. The Prince made up in ha&s;te to|wards
her, ki&s;s'd her Hand, for 'twas not a place
to talk in, and helped her on her Hor&s;e, for &s;he rid
wonderfully well, it being one of her Amu&s;ements
to take hor&s;e with her Maids, and ride into a little
Wood, &s;ome di&s;tance from the Ca&s;tle, which the Fairy
&s;uffer'd her to take the Air in. Afterwards <HI>Parcinus</HI>
mounted his Hor&s;e, and <HI>Mana</HI> and the Slave theirs.
Then the young Prince, drawing the brilliant Sabre
the Fairy gave him, &s;wore to the fair <HI>Irolita,</HI> to a|dore
her all his Life, and to die, if nece&s;&s;ary, in
her defence. After the&s;e words they went away,
and the Zephirs &s;eem'd to corre&s;pond with them,
or to take <HI>Irolita</HI> for <HI>Flora,</HI> by always attending
them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Day di&s;cover'd to <HI>Danamo</HI> a
piece of News &s;he little expected. The Ladies who
were about <HI>Irolita,</HI> were amazed that &s;he &s;lept &s;o
long; but obeying the order the prudent <HI>Mana</HI> had
given them the night before, dur&s;t not go into the
Prince&s;s's Chamber till &s;he call'd them. <HI>Mana</HI> lay
in the &s;ame Chamber with <HI>Irolita,</HI> from whence they
went out at a little Back-door that let them into a
<PB N="249" REF="250">
Court of the Palace, very little frequented, by a
Door that was in <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Clo&s;et, and was made up;
but in two or three Nights they found out the
means to open it. In &s;hort, the Queen &s;ent for
<HI>Irolita;</HI> in obedience to the Fairy, they knock'd at
the Prince&s;s's Chamber-door, and no body an&s;wer'd.
But when the Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> arrived, who came to
conduct the Prince&s;s to the Queen, he was very
much &s;urprized; he broke open the door, and went
in, and &s;eeing the little Door in the Clo&s;et forced,
he no longer doubted of the Prince&s;s's Flight.
When the News was carried to the Queen, &s;he
&s;haked with Anger, and order'd them to &s;earch
every where for <HI>Irolita;</HI> but it was all in vain, no
body could give any account of her. The Prince
<HI>Brutus</HI> him&s;elf went to &s;eek after her, and &s;ent the
Fairy's Guards with all &s;peed on the Roads he
thought they might take. In the mean time, <HI>Azira</HI>
ob&s;erved that <HI>Parcinus</HI> did not appear in this general
Con&s;ternation; and Jealou&s;y opening her Eyes, &s;he
&s;ent in ha&s;te to him, and began to think that
Prince had taken <HI>Irolita</HI> away. The Fairy her&s;elf
could not believe it; but upon con&s;ulting her Books,
&s;he found <HI>Azira</HI>'s Su&s;picion to be matter of fact. In
the mean time, that Prince&s;s having learn'd that
<HI>Parcinus</HI> was not in his Apartment, nor the Palace,
&s;ent to the Ca&s;tle where <HI>Irolita</HI> had been &s;o long, to
&s;ee if &s;he could find any thing whereby &s;he might
ju&s;tify or condemn the Prince. The prudent <HI>Mana</HI>
had taken care to leave nothing that might di&s;cover
<HI>Irolita</HI>'s Corre&s;pondence with <HI>Parcinus;</HI> but <HI>Azira</HI>'s
Scarf, which was found on the Couch he &s;wooned
on, and had been untied while he was in that con|dition;
and which neither the Prince, nor <HI>Mana,</HI>
who were full of Grief, perceiv'd. What did not the
haughty <HI>Azira</HI> feel at the &s;ight of that Scarf? Her
Love and Pride &s;uffer'd both alike; &s;he afflicted her|&s;elf
to exce&s;s, and &s;ent all the Servants of <HI>Irolita</HI> and
the Prince to Pri&s;on. The Ingratitude the Queen
thought <HI>Parcinus</HI> had &s;hew'd her, pu&s;h'd her natural
<PB N="250" REF="251">
Rage to the la&s;t extremity. She would willingly
have given one of her Kingdoms to have been re|venged
of tho&s;e two Lovers, who at the &s;ame time
were pur&s;ued on all &s;ides: Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> and his
Troop met with fre&s;h Hor&s;es every where by the
Fairy's Order, whereas tho&s;e of <HI>Parcinus</HI> were tired,
and an&s;wer'd not the Impatience of their Ma&s;ter.
At the further &s;ide of a Fore&s;t he overtook them:
the fir&s;t Motion of the Prince was to go and fight
that unworthy Rival; he was riding up to him with
his Sabre drawn, when <HI>Irolita</HI> cry'd out, &startq;Prince,
&s;eek not an unprofitable Danger, obey the Orders
of the Fairy <HI>Favourable.</HI>&endq; The&s;e words gave a
check to <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Rage, who, to obey the Prin|ce&s;s
and the Fairy, wi&s;h'd the Prince&s;s was in &s;afe|ty
again&s;t the Per&s;ecutions of the cruel Queen.
He had &s;carcely made this Wi&s;h, but the Earth
open'd between him and his Rival; a little ugly
Man, magnificently dre&s;s'd, appear'd, and made a
&s;ign to him to follow him. The De&s;cent was ea&s;y
on their &s;ide, he went down on hor&s;eback, with
<HI>Irolita,</HI> and <HI>Mana,</HI> and the Slave, and the Earth
clo&s;ed. <HI>Brutus,</HI> &s;urprized at &s;o extraordinary an
Event, went in ha&s;te to give <HI>Danamo</HI> an account of
it; and in the mean time our young Lovers fol|low'd
the little Man thro a dark Road, that led to
a large Palace, lighted by a great many Flambeaux
and Lamps. They alighted from off their Hor&s;es,
went into a prodigious large Hall, &s;upported by
Pillars of &s;hining Earth, cover'd with Ornaments
of Gold; a little Man, loaded with Jewels, &s;at on
a Throne of Gold at the bottom of the Hall, with
a great number of People like him&s;elf about him,
who conducted the Prince to that Place: who, as
&s;oon as he appear'd with the charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> the
little Man ro&s;e from his Throne, and &s;aid to him,
&startq;Come, Prince, the great Fairy <HI>Favourable,</HI> who
has been a long time one of my Friends, hath de|&s;ired
me to &s;ecure you again&s;t the Cruelties of
<HI>Danamo.</HI> I am King of the <HI>Gnomes,</HI> you and the
<PB N="351" REF="252">
Prince&s;s are welcome to my Palace&endq; <HI>Parcinus</HI>
thank'd him for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The King and
all his Subjects were enchanted at the Beauty
of <HI>Irolita,</HI> they took her for a Star that came to
lighten their Abode, and &s;erved up a magnificent
Entertainment. The King of the <HI>Gnomes</HI> paid them
all manner of Re&s;pect; and harmonious Concert, but
&s;omewhat wild, was the Diver&s;ion of the Night,
where they &s;ang the Charms of <HI>Irolita,</HI> and repeated
&s;everal times the&s;e Ver&s;es:
<Q><L>What Star is this that thus our Sight invades,</L>
<L>And darts &s;uch Beams on the&s;e our gloomy Shades?</L>
<L>Which, while its Lu&s;tre fondly we admire,</L>
<L>Dazzles our Eyes, and &s;ets our Hearts on fire.</L></Q></P>
<P>After the Mu&s;ick was done, they led the Prince
and Prince&s;s, each into a magnificent Room, and
<HI>Mana</HI> and the faithful Slave follow'd them. The
next day they &s;hew'd them the King's Palace, who
di&s;po&s;ed of all the Riches of the Earth; nothing
could be added to that Trea&s;ure, which was a con|fu&s;ed
Ma&s;s of fine things unformed. The Prince
and Prince&s;s remained eight days in this &s;ubterra|neous
Abode: <HI>Favourable</HI> had order'd the King of
the <HI>Gnomes,</HI> during that time, to make the Prin|ce&s;s
and her Lover gallant and magnificent Enter|tainments.
The Night before their Departure, the
King, to immortalize the Memory of their Re&s;i|dence
in his Empire, had their two Statues erected
in Gold on each &s;ide his Throne, on Pede&s;tals of
white Marble; with the&s;e words writ in Letters
of Diamonds on the Pede&s;tal of the Prince's Statue:
<Q><L>We de&s;ire no more the &s;ight of the Sun;</L>
<L>We have &s;een this Prince,</L>
<L>Who is brighter, and more beautiful.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="253">
And on the Pede&s;tal of the Prince&s;s's Statue:
<Q><L>To the immortal Honour</L>
<L>Of the Godde&s;s of Beauty,</L>
<L>Who de&s;cended here,</L>
<L>Under the Name of <HI>Irolita.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The ninth Day the Prince had very fine Hor&s;es
given him, who&s;e Trappings were of Gold, laid o|ver
with Diamonds, and left, with his &s;mall Troop,
the dark Abode of the <HI>Gnomes,</HI> after having paid his
Acknowledgments to their King, and found him&s;elf
in the &s;ame place where Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> attack'd
him; and looking on his Ring, perceived only the
Silver and the Bra&s;s. He pur&s;ued his way with the
charming <HI>Irolita,</HI> and ha&s;ten'd to arrive at the Ha|bitation
of the Fairy <HI>Favourable,</HI> where they were to
be in &s;afety: when all on a &s;udden coming out of
a Vale, they met with a Troop of <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Guards,
who were &s;till in &s;earch after them, and were ju&s;t
ready to fall on them; when the Prince wi&s;h'd,
and pre&s;ently there appear'd a great &s;pace of Wa|ter
between them and the Fairy's Troop. A beau|tiful
Nymph, half naked, ro&s;e up in the middle of
the Water, in a Boat of Ru&s;hes laced together,
and making towards the Shore, de&s;ired the Prince
and his beautiful Mi&s;tre&s;s to come into it; who,
with <HI>Mana</HI> and the Slave, left their Hor&s;es in the
Field, and went into the Boat, which &s;unk under
Water, and made the Guards think they cho&s;e ra|ther
to drown them&s;elves, than fall into their
hands. Immediately they found them&s;elves in a
Palace, the Walls of which were great Drops of
Water, which falling continually, made Halls,
Chambers, Clo&s;ets, and encompa&s;s'd Gardens, where
a thou&s;and Spoutings of Water, of odd Figures,
form'd the De&s;ign of Parterres. None but <HI>Naids</HI>
could live in this Palace, &s;o fine and &s;ingular as it
was; therefore to afford the Prince and the fair
<PB N="253" REF="254">
<HI>Irolita</HI> a more &s;olid Habitation, the <HI>Naid&punc;</HI> that con|ducted
them, carried them into Grotto's of Shell|work,
compo&s;ed of Coral, Pearls, and all the Riches
of the Sea. Their Beds were of Mo&s;s, a hundred
Dolphins guarded <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Grott, and twenty Whales
the Prince's. The <HI>Naids</HI> admired, at their Return,
the Beauty of <HI>Irolita;</HI> and moreover, a <HI>Triton</HI> grew
jealous of the Prince's Looks and Care: They gave
them in the Prince's Grotto a Collation of fine
Fruits; twelve <HI>Syrens</HI> came to charm, by their &s;weet
Voices, the Trouble of the Prince and <HI>Irolita,</HI> and
&s;ung the following Song:
<Q><L>Wherever Love our Heart conveys,</L>
<L>He makes us happy diff'rent ways:</L>
<L>Perfect Lovers, triumph in your Chains,</L>
<L>And let your Pa&s;&s;ions &s;till &s;urmount your Pains.</L></Q></P>
<P>At night there was an Entertainment, con&s;i&s;ting
wholly of Fi&s;h, of an extraordinary Size, and ex|qui&s;ite
Ta&s;te. After this Repa&s;t, the <HI>Naids</HI> danced
in Habits of Fi&s;h-Scales, of different Colours, which
was very fine; Bodies of <HI>Tritons,</HI> with In&s;truments
unknown to Men, compo&s;ed a Symphony, which was
odd, but new, and very agreeable. <HI>Parcinus</HI> and
the fair <HI>Irolita,</HI> were four Days in this Empire; the
fifth Day the <HI>Naids</HI> came in Crouds to conduct the
Prince and Prince&s;s; which two Lovers went into
a Boat of one entire Shell, and the <HI>Naids,</HI> half out
of the Water, accompanied them to the River-&s;ide,
where <HI>Parcinus</HI> found his Hor&s;es again, and &s;et for|ward
with &s;peed: when looking on his Ring, he
perceived only the Bra&s;s; but they were then nigh
<HI>Favourable</HI>'s Palace. They travelled three Days,
when on the fourth, at Sun-ri&s;ing, they perceived
Men in Arms, who, when they came near, appear'd
to be the Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> and his Troop, whom <HI>Da|namo</HI>
had &s;ent again to pur&s;ue them, with Orders
not to leave them if they found them, nor to &s;tir
off the &s;pot, where any thing extraordinary &s;hould
<PB N="254" REF="255">
fall out; and above all, to endeavour to engage the
Prince to fight. <HI>Danamo</HI> knew very well, after
what <HI>Brutus</HI> had told her, that a Fairy protected
the Prince and Prince&s;s; but her Knowledge was
&s;o great, that &s;he de&s;paired not of overcoming them
by more powerful Charms. Prince <HI>Brutus,</HI> overjoy'd
to &s;ee the Prince and <HI>Irolita</HI> again, whom he &s;ought
after with &s;o much diligence, rid with his Sword
in his hand up to <HI>Parcinus,</HI> to endeavour to fight
him, according to <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Orders. The young
Prince drew his Sword with &s;o fierce an Air, that
<HI>Brutus</HI> repented more than once of his Undertaking;
but <HI>Parcinus,</HI> perceiving <HI>Irolita</HI> all in Tears, moved
with Compa&s;&s;ion at that &s;ight, made his fourth Wi&s;h,
and pre&s;ently there aro&s;e a great Fire up to the
Skies, which &s;eparated <HI>Parcinus</HI> from his Enemy.
This Fire made Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> and his Troop fall
back. The young Prince and <HI>Irolita,</HI> who were al|ways
attended by the faithful Slave and <HI>Mana,</HI>
found them&s;elves in a Palace, the &s;ight of which,
being all Fire, at fir&s;t frighten'd <HI>Irolita;</HI> but &s;he was
&s;oon encouraged, when &s;he perceived &s;he felt no
greater Heat than that of the Sun, and that this
Fire had only the flaming Quality, and not tho&s;e
others, which render it in&s;upportable. A great
many young and hand&s;ome Per&s;ons, richly clothed,
came from whence the Flames &s;eem'd to ri&s;e, to
receive the Prince&s;s and her Lover. One of them,
whom they judged to be the Queen of that Place,
by the Re&s;pects paid to her, &s;aid, &startq;Come, charm|ing
Prince&s;s, and you lovely <HI>Parcinus,</HI> you are in
the Kingdom of the <HI>Salamanders;</HI> I am the Queen,
and with plea&s;ure am charged by <HI>Favourable</HI> to
conceal you &s;even Days in my Palace: I wi&s;h
only your Abode here was to be longer.&endq; After
the&s;e words &s;he carried them into a large Apart|ment,
all of Fire, like the re&s;t of the Palace, and
which gave as great a Light as the Sun. That
Night they &s;upped with the Queen, and had a no|ble
Entertainment; after it was over, they went
<PB N="255" REF="256">
on a Terra&s;s, to &s;ee an artificial Fire of wonderful
Beauty, and a very &s;ingular De&s;ign, which was pre|pared
in a great Court before the <HI>Salamander</HI>'s Pa|lace.
Twelve Loves were on Pillars of Marble, of
different Colours; &s;ix of them &s;eem'd ready to
draw their Bows, and the &s;ix others held out a
great Plate, whereon the&s;e Words were writ in
Characters of Fire:
<Q><L>Where'er fair <HI>Irolite</HI> appears,</L>
<L>A glorious Conque&s;t there &s;he bears:</L>
<L>Our raging Flames, and hotte&s;t Fire,</L>
<L>Fall &s;hort of what her Eyes in&s;pire;</L>
<L>So great's the Torment of De&s;ire.</L></Q></P>
<P>The young <HI>Irolita</HI> blu&s;h'd at her own Glory, and
<HI>Parcinus</HI> was overjoy'd that &s;he was thought as
hand&s;ome as &s;he appeared to him. In the mean
time the <HI>Cupids</HI> drew their Arrows of Fire, which
cro&s;&s;ing in the Air, form'd in a thou&s;and places
the Cypher and Name of <HI>Irolita,</HI> and carried it
up to the Heavens. The &s;even Days they &s;tay'd
in this Palace were &s;pent in Plea&s;ures and Diver|&s;ions.
<HI>Parcinus</HI> ob&s;erved, that all the <HI>Salaman|ders</HI>
had a great deal of Spirit, and a charming
Vivacity, were all gallant and amorous, and that
the Queen her&s;elf was not exempt from that Pa&s;|&s;ion,
&s;ince &s;he was in love with a young <HI>Salaman|der</HI>
of extraordinary Beauty. The eighth Day they
left, with regret, an Abode &s;o agreeable to their
Tenderne&s;s, and found them&s;elves in a fine Field;
where <HI>Parcinus,</HI> looking on his Ring, found on the
four Metals mix'd together, the&s;e words engraved:
<Q>You wi&s;h'd too &s;oon.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words afflicted the Prince and young Prin|ce&s;s,
but they were &s;o nigh <HI>Favourable</HI>'s Habitation,
that they hoped to reach it that day. This Thought
&s;u&s;pended their Grief, they went forwards, calling
<PB N="256" REF="257">
on Fortune and Love, too often deceitful Guides.
The Prince <HI>Brutus,</HI> following the Fairy's Orders,
never &s;tirred from the Place where the Fire &s;epa|rated
them, but lay encamped behind a Wood,
when his Sentinels, who kept continual Watch, in|form'd
him that the Prince and Prince&s;s appeared
on the Plain again. He mounted his Troop, and
came up by night with the unfortunate Prince and
divine <HI>Irolita. Parcinus</HI> was not in the lea&s;t di&s;may'd
at the great number of tho&s;e who attacked him all
at once; he flew on them with a Courage that
terrify'd them: &startq;I fulfil my Promi&s;e, fair <HI>Irolita,
&s;aid he, drawing his Sabre;</HI> I will die for you, or
deliver you from your Enemies.&endq; After the&s;e
words, he &s;truck the fir&s;t he met, and fell'd him at
his feet; but, Oh Grief unexpected! that Sabre
which he had of the Fairy, broke into a thou&s;and
pieces. 'Twas what the Fairy expected from the
Combat with the young Prince, for when &s;he gave
any Arms, &s;he charm'd them in &s;uch a manner,
that when they were made u&s;e of again&s;t her&s;elf,
they &s;hould break at the fir&s;t Blow into a thou&s;and
pieces. <HI>Parcinus</HI> thus di&s;arm'd, could not long re|&s;i&s;t
the Numbers that &s;urrounded him; they took
him, loaded him with Chains, and made the young
<HI>Irolita</HI> undergo the &s;ame Fate. &startq;Oh! Fairy <HI>Favoura|ble,
cry'd the Prince melancholily,</HI> abandon me to all
the Rage of <HI>Danamo,</HI> but &s;ave the fair <HI>Irolita.</HI>&endq; &startq;You
have di&s;obey'd the Fairy, <HI>an&s;wer'd a young Man of
&s;urprizing Beauty, who appeared in the A$r,</HI> you mu&s;t
endure the Puni&s;hment; if you had not been &s;o
prodigal of <HI>Favourable</HI>'s A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we had pre&s;er|ved
you again&s;t the Cruelties of <HI>Danamo.</HI> The
whole Kingdom of the <HI>Silphes</HI> are vex'd that they
had not the Glory of rendring &s;o charming a
Prince, and &s;o beautiful a Prince&s;s, happy.&endq; After
this he di&s;appear'd. <HI>Parcinus</HI> groan'd at his Impru|dence;
he appear'd in&s;en&s;ible of his own Misfor|tunes,
but was cruelly agitated with tho&s;e of <HI>Iro|lita:</HI>
and the Regret of having contributed to them,
<PB N="257" REF="258">
had made him to die away for Grief, if Fate had
not prepared more cruel Torments for him to un|dergo.
The young <HI>Irolita</HI> &s;hewed a Courage wor|thy
her illu&s;trious Blood; and the mercile&s;s <HI>Brutus,</HI>
far from relenting at &s;o moving a &s;ight, redoubled
their Calamities, which he was partly the cau&s;e of.
He &s;eparated them, and deprived them of the plea|&s;ure
of complaining to each other without redre&s;s.
After a cruel Journey, they arrived at the wicked
Fairy's, who expre&s;&s;ed a malign Joy to &s;ee the
Prince and young Prince&s;s in a condition &s;o wor|thy
of creating Pity in any other Brea&s;t but hers;
however, <HI>Azira</HI> had &s;ome for <HI>Parcinus,</HI> but dur&s;t not
&s;hew it before the Fairy: &startq;I will, <HI>&s;aid that cruel
Queen, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the young Prince,</HI> have the
plea&s;ure of revenging my&s;elf on thy Ingratitude;
go, in&s;tead of a&s;cending the Throne my Bounty
de&s;igned you, to the Pri&s;on of the Sea, where I
will put an end to thy mi&s;erable Life by the mo&s;t
horrible Puni&s;hments.&endq; &startq;I chu&s;e rather the mo&s;t
wretched Pri&s;on, <HI>reply'd the Prince, looking on her
fiercely,</HI> than the Favours of &s;o unju&s;t a Queen:&endq;
Which words provoked her much more, who ex|pected
to have &s;een him pro&s;trate at her feet. She
made him be carried away to the appointed Pri&s;on:
<HI>Irolita</HI> cry'd in &s;eeing him go, <HI>Azira</HI> could not retain
her Sighs, and all the Court groaned &s;ecretly at &s;o
cruel an Order. For the fair <HI>Irolita,</HI> the Queen &s;ent
her to the Ca&s;tle where &s;he had been kept &s;o long,
had her carefully guarded, and u&s;ed her as inhuman|ly
as &s;he was capable of.</P>
<P>The Prince's Pri&s;on was a Tower in the mid&s;t
of the Sea, built on a &s;mall De&s;art I&s;le: there he
was kept loaded with Irons, and underwent all
imaginable Hard&s;hips. What a Place was this for
a Prince fit to rule the whole World? The remem|brance
of <HI>Irolita</HI> was his &s;ole Employ; he called on
<HI>Favourable</HI> only to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and wi&s;h'd a thou|&s;and
times to die, to expiate the Crime he had
committed; his faithful Slave was put into the &s;ame
<PB N="258" REF="259">
Pri&s;on, but had not the Satisfaction of &s;erving his
illu&s;trious Ma&s;ter, who had none but rude Soldiers
about him, devoted to the Fairy; who, tho obe|dient
to her, could not but re&s;pect the unhappy
Prince. His Youth, Beauty, and above all his Cou|rage,
touched them with an Admiration, that made
them look on him as a Man &s;uperior to all others.
The prudent <HI>Mana</HI> was treated in the Ca&s;tle with
<HI>Irolita,</HI> in the &s;ame manner as the faithful Slave.
None but <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Creatures came nigh the Prin|ce&s;s,
who, by her Order, excited in her a fre&s;h
Grief every moment, by telling her what the Prince
&s;uffered. The Calamities of <HI>Parcinus</HI> made the
Prince&s;s &s;ometimes forget the remembrance of her
own, and renewed her Tears in a Place where &s;he
had &s;o often heard that charming Prince &s;wear to
her an eternal Fidelity: &startq;Alas! <HI>&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf,</HI>
why was you &s;o con&s;tant, my dear Prince, indeed
your Infidelity would have co&s;t me my Life; but
what &s;ignified that? you would, after that, have
been happy.&endq; <HI>Danamo,</HI> who took &s;ome time to
prepare a Charm of extraordinary force, &s;ent <HI>Irolita,</HI>
in the morning, two Lamps; one of Gold, the o|ther
Chry&s;tal; the Golden one was lighted. <HI>Da|namo</HI>
ordered her not to let one of tho&s;e two Lamps
go out, but told her, &startq;She might keep which &s;he
plea&s;ed lighted.&endq; <HI>Irolita</HI> an&s;wer'd, with her natural
Sweetne&s;s, She &s;hould obey her, without &s;earch|ing
into the &s;ignification of it. She carried the
two Lamps carefully into her Clo&s;et, and as the
Golden one was lighted, &s;he put it not out all that
day, and lighted the other the next day, and &s;o
continued to obey the Fairy. She had kept the&s;e
Lamps fifteen days, when her Health began to di|mini&s;h,
which &s;he thought might be occa&s;ioned by
her Grief; but when they told her <HI>Parcinus</HI> was
very ill, her piercing Grief, and violent Oppre&s;&s;ion,
rai&s;ed pity in all the Women about her. One
night, when they were all a&s;leep, one of them
went &s;oftly to the Prince&s;s, and &s;eeing the Chry&s;tal
<PB N="259" REF="260">
Lamp burning: &startq;What is it you do, Great Prin|ce&s;s?
<HI>&s;aid &s;he to her,</HI> put out that fatal Light, your
Health depends upon it, pre&s;erve a Life &s;o valua|able
from the Cruelties of <HI>Danamo.</HI>&endq; &startq;Alas! <HI>re|ply'd
the melancholy</HI> Irolita, <HI>in a langui&s;hing Air,</HI> &s;he
has made it &s;o mi&s;erable, that 'tis a kind of fa|vour
in the Fairy to afford me the means of putting
an end to it: but, <HI>continued &s;he pre&s;ently after, with
an Emotion that brought a Colour in her Face,</HI> who&s;e
Life does that golden Lamp prevail over?&endq; &startq;<HI>Parci|nus</HI>'s,
<HI>reply'd</HI> Danamo'<HI>s Confidant,</HI>&endq; who &s;poke to the
Prince&s;s by her Order; for that wicked Fairy had
a mind to torment her, by letting her know how
cruel her Fate was. At this News the Grief of
having her&s;elf taken care to put an end to <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s
days, made her lie &s;ome time in&s;en&s;ible; but when
&s;he came to her&s;elf, and, in recovering her Sen&s;es,
re&s;umed her Sorrows, &startq;Odious Fairy, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, when
&s;he had power to &s;peak,</HI> barbarous Fairy! Is not my
Death &s;ufficient to appea&s;e thy Rage? but to be
more cruel, thou mu&s;t de&s;troy, by my hands, a
Prince &s;o dear to me, who is de&s;erving of the
tendere&s;t and mo&s;t perfect Love. But Death, a
thou&s;and times more kind than thou, will &s;hortly
deliver me from all the Mi&s;chiefs thy Rage in|vents,
again&s;t a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o violent and faithful.&endq;
The young Prince&s;s cry'd continually over the fa|tal
Lamp, on which <HI>Parcinus</HI>'s Life depended, and
lighted none but her own, which &s;he &s;aw burn
with Joy, as a Sacrifice &s;he offered up to her Love
and Lover. All this time that unhappy Prince was
tormented with Puni&s;hments his Courage could not
&s;upport: The Fairy made the Soldiers who guarded
him, and feigned to be &s;en&s;ible of that illu&s;trious
Prince's Sorrows, tell him, &startq;That <HI>Irolita</HI> had con|&s;ented
to marry the Prince <HI>Brutus</HI> in a few days
after he was put into Pri&s;on, and that that Prin|ce&s;s
&s;eemed very well content with her Marriage,
at all the Fea&s;ts that were made to celebrate it; and
in &s;hort, that &s;he was gone away with her Hu&s;|band.&endq;
<PB N="260" REF="261">
This was a Misfortune the Prince did not
expect, and was the only one that could be greater
than his Con&s;tancy: &startq;What, my dear <HI>Irolita,</HI> are
you unfaithful to me, <HI>&s;aid the &s;ad Prince,</HI> to be
Prince <HI>Brutus</HI>'s? You have only bewailed my
Misfortunes, you have thought only of putting
an end to tho&s;e my Tenderne&s;s cau&s;ed you: but
live happy, ungrateful <HI>Irolita;</HI> I adore you, un|con&s;tant
as you are, and will die for my Love,
tho not permitted the honour of dying for my
Prince&s;s.&endq; Whil&s;t the unfortunate <HI>Parcinus</HI> was
thus afflicting him&s;elf, and the tender <HI>Irolita</HI> was
wa&s;ting her Life to prolong her Lover's, <HI>Danamo</HI>
was affected with <HI>Azira</HI>'s De&s;pair, who died away
for Grief at the Hard&s;hips of <HI>Parcinus:</HI> In &s;hort,
the cruel Fairy perceiving, that to &s;ave her Daugh|ter's
Life, &s;he mu&s;t pardon the Prince, &s;uffered her
to go to &s;ee him, and to promi&s;e him all he &s;hould
name if he would marry her, and at the &s;ame time
re&s;olved to have put <HI>Irolita</HI> to death, as &s;oon as the
Prince had accepted the Propo&s;itions. The hopes
of &s;eeing <HI>Parcinus</HI> again, gave the melancholy <HI>Azira</HI>
new Life; the Queen bid her &s;end to <HI>Irolita</HI> for the
Lamp, that &s;he might be &s;ure it did not burn:
which Order &s;eemed more cruel than all the re&s;t to
the &s;orrowful <HI>Irolita.</HI> How great was her Unea|&s;ine&s;s
for the Life of <HI>Parcinus?</HI> &startq;Be not &s;o con|cerned
for the Life of that Prince, <HI>&s;aid the Women
to her, who were about her,</HI> he is going to marry
the Prince&s;s <HI>Azira,</HI> and 'tis &s;he who, careful of
his Life, &s;ends for the Lamp.&endq; The Torment of
Jealou&s;y, which was wanting among all her Mi&s;|fortunes,
never, till after the&s;e words, had any
&s;hare in her Calamities. Neverthele&s;s <HI>Azira</HI> went
to &s;ee the Prince, and offered her&s;elf and Kingdoms
to him, pretending to be ignorant that he had heard
of <HI>Irolita</HI>'s Marriage with <HI>Brutus;</HI> by which Exam|ple
&s;he would have convinced him, he had carried
his Con&s;tancy too far. <HI>Parcinus,</HI> to whom nothing
was valuable but his beloved <HI>Irolita,</HI> preferred his
<PB N="261" REF="262">
Pri&s;on and Sufferings before Liberty and Empire.
<HI>Azira</HI> de&s;paired at his Refu&s;al, and her Grief ren|dered
her equally unhappy as that Prince.</P>
<P>During this time the Fairy <HI>Favourable,</HI> who till
then had boa&s;ted of the In&s;en&s;ibility of her Heart,
was not able to re&s;i&s;t the Charms of a young Prince
in her Court, who was in love with her; and this
Fairy could not have re&s;olved to li&s;ten to him, had
not the Pride of her Soul been overcome by the
Violence of her Pa&s;&s;ion: in &s;hort, &s;he yielded to
the de&s;ire of letting him know how he triumphed.
The plea&s;ure of &s;peaking to what we love, &s;eemed
then &s;o charming to her, and &s;o worthy of being de|&s;ired,
that approving what &s;he had blamed &s;o much,
&s;he came in ha&s;te to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Parcinus</HI> and the
fair <HI>Irolita.</HI></P>
<P>Had &s;he &s;taid a little longer, it would have been
too late, the fatal Lamp of <HI>Irolita</HI> had but &s;ix days
to burn, and the Grief of the unhappy <HI>Parcinus</HI>
had almo&s;t put an end to his days. <HI>Favourable</HI> ar|rived
at <HI>Danamo</HI>'s Palace, and as her Power was &s;u|periour
to hers, &s;he would be obeyed in &s;pite of
the wicked Fairy. The Prince was fetched out of
his Pri&s;on, from whence he would not &s;tir, till he
was a&s;&s;ured by <HI>Favourable,</HI> that the fair <HI>Irolita</HI> might
&s;till be his. He appeared, for all his Palene&s;s, as
hand&s;ome as the Day, and went with the Fairy <HI>Fa|vourable</HI>
to the Prince&s;s's Ca&s;tle, who&s;e Lamp ca&s;t but
a glimmering Light. The dying <HI>Irolita</HI> would not
con&s;ent to have it put out, till &s;he was a&s;&s;ured of the
Fidelity of her happy Lover. No Words or Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
are lively and tender enough to give an
Idea of their Joy to &s;ee each other again. <HI>Favou|rable</HI>
made them in&s;tantly re&s;ume their former
Charms, and endowed them with a long Life and
con&s;tant Happine&s;s; but for their Tenderne&s;s &s;he
had nought to add to that. <HI>Danamo</HI> outrageous to
&s;ee her Authority defeated, killed her&s;elf, leaving
the Fate of <HI>Azira</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> entirely to <HI>Irolita,</HI> who
took no other revenge than marrying them both
<PB N="262" REF="263">
together. <HI>Parcinus,</HI> as generous as con&s;tant, ac|cepted
only of his Father's Kingdom, and left tho&s;e
of <HI>Danamo</HI> to <HI>Azira.</HI> The Nuptials of the Prince
and Divine <HI>Irolita</HI> were &s;olemnized with great Mag|nificence;
and after having paid their Acknowledg|ments
to <HI>Favourable,</HI> and rewarded the Slave, and
prudent <HI>Mana,</HI> they &s;et out for their Kingdom;
where the Prince, and lovely <HI>Irolita,</HI> enjoyed the
Happine&s;s of a Pa&s;&s;ion, as tender and con&s;tant in
their Pro&s;perity, as it was violent and faithful in
their Adver&s;ity.</P>

the Widow.</HI> &startq;A Gentleman of Merit, <HI>&s;aid the Vi&s;|count,</HI>
was he not an Enemy to our Friend here.&endq;
&startq;Indeed, I have &s;een him, <HI>reply'd &s;he,</HI> and now per|fectly
remember him.&endq; &startq;You remember him! <HI>an|&s;wer'd</HI>
Dandinardiere, <HI>knitting his Brows,</HI> you now
joke with me; he is a Clown I would make no
compari&s;on with: and I am &s;urprized, that a
Woman &s;o well dre&s;s'd as you are, can allow a
Man of that &s;tamp to be tolerable.&endq; Madam <HI>Rouet,</HI>
who had &s;ecretly an Inclination for <HI>Villeville,</HI> finding
<PB N="265" REF="266">
her&s;elf &s;en&s;ibly touch'd, reply'd in a deriding man|ner,
&startq;And pray who are you, good Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dandi|nardiere?</HI>
Does your Removal from <HI>St. Dennis-Street</HI>
to the Sea-&s;ide authorize you to call all Mankind
Scoundrels?&endq; &startq;Ha! Madam Mu&s;hroom, <HI>cry'd he,
as red as Fire,</HI> truly it does not become you of all
People to talk again&s;t me; without my Mo|ney
your Father would have narrowly e&s;caped
the&mdash;&endq; &startq;What In&s;olence is this! <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> my
Father &s;uffer'd by your Breaking.&endq; In &s;hort, the
Di&s;pute began with &s;o much Warmth on both &s;ides,
that the Gentlemen, thinking it might be carried
too far, and fearing le&s;t Madam <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> who
was always upon the Enquiry, &s;hould di&s;cover the
true Original of our Cavalier, and learn more than
they would have her, endeavour'd all they could
to make a Peace; and with them, Madam <HI>de Lure</HI>
was very earne&s;t to reconcile them, for &s;he would
not for ever &s;o much have it &s;aid in the Country, that
&s;he kept Company with a Citizen. But this Quarrel
of the Widow's and <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>'s was got already
to a great height; however, out of Manners and
Re&s;pect due to the Intreaties of their Friends, they
held their tongues, tho their Rage plainly di&s;co|ver'd
it&s;elf by their Eyes, and &s;everal Reflections
pa&s;s'd backwards and forwards, without mentioning
any Names.</P>
<P>The Baron at la&s;t, thinking it would be the be&s;t
way to part them, to that end &s;aid, &startq;I believe,
Ladies, it will not be ami&s;s, if we &s;hould take a
Turn or two into the Wood, where we diverted
our&s;elves in the Morning.&endq; &startq;Upon my word, <HI>&s;aid
the W$dow,</HI> the Situation is infinitely agreeable; I
love the Sea to di&s;traction, and very much approve
of the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who marry it
every year: and was I the Doge's Wife, I would
marry it too, or at lea&s;t make &s;ome Alliance or
Friend&s;hip with it.&endq; After this Speech &s;he ro&s;e
up, without once looking upon <HI>Dandinardiere;</HI> and
catching hold of Madam <HI>de St. Thomas</HI>'s Arm, &s;aid
<PB N="266" REF="267">
to her, &startq;Come, let us recreate our&s;elves by this
ungovernable Elements's &s;ide.&endq; The Barone&s;s up|on
this pulled her Arm ha&s;tily away, and told her,
&s;he was able enough to &s;upport her&s;elf, without
making her her Leaning-&s;tock. The Widow, who
was not a little out of humour at her Cou&s;in the
Cit, thought her&s;elf affronted by the Barone&s;s, and
made an&s;wer, &startq;Indeed, there are &s;ome People in
the World, who in&s;tead of offering Ro&s;es, pre&s;ent
nought but the Prickles.&endq; &startq;O! I under&s;tand you,
<HI>&s;aid the Barone&s;s, with an haughty Air;</HI> you are
the Flower, and I the Thorn. Well, if you are
a Ro&s;e, it is, I am &s;ure, a fading one.&endq; &startq;You are
very in&s;ulting, Madam, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Widow, colour|ing;</HI>
had I thought of this Reception, &s;ome Mira|cle
mu&s;t have been wrought to have made me
have done you the honour of a Vi&s;it.&endq; &startq;It is
what I could very well have excu&s;ed,&endq; <HI>&s;aid the Ba|rone&s;s,</HI>
(who was re&s;olved to have the la&s;t word.)
&startq;Indeed, my Dear, <HI>&s;aid the Baron,</HI> you have a great
mind to vex me to-day.&endq; &startq;I know you, Sir, <HI>re|ply'd
&s;he, rai&s;ing her Voice,</HI> I know you would take
the great <HI>Turk</HI>'s part, if it was but again&s;t me;
but a &s;eparate Maintenance will make me ea&s;y.&endq;
The Godde&s;s of Di&s;cord her&s;elf &s;eem'd to him to
have taken up her Re&s;idence that day at his Hou&s;e,
for there was nothing to be heard but Wranglings
and Differences; however, Mon&s;ieur <HI>St. Thomas</HI>
made his Wife no An&s;wer, but engaged the Ladies
to go into the Wood, leaving the Barone&s;s and <HI>Dan|dinardiere</HI>
together, who at that time agreed ex|traordinarily
in their Sentiments of Madam <HI>Rouet.</HI>
&startq;Well, <HI>&s;aid Madam</HI> St. Thomas, will you give me
leave to &s;peak my mind freely to you.&endq; &startq;Oh!
you do me too much honour,&endq; <HI>reply'd the Cit.</HI> &startq;Then,
<HI>an&s;wer'd &s;he,</HI> I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, your Cou&s;in is a

he;</HI> O Madam, &s;he is nothing related to me, we
are only Cou&s;ins&mdash;You under&s;tand me.&endq; &startq;If
I do, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I have more Under&s;tanding than any
<PB N="267" REF="268">
Woman in <HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ides, to gue&s;s at an entire
Hi&s;tory, without one &s;ingle Syllable's being men|tioned.&endq;
&startq;Oh! how happy is a Man, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dan|dinardiere,
to have a Wife of &s;o much Merit; if
Heaven had given me &s;uch a one, I &s;hould have
adored her as much as the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> wor&s;hip their
<HI>Pagods:</HI> I &s;hould ki&s;s her little Toes, and gnaw
her Mittons.&endq; &startq;But you &s;ee, <HI>&s;aid the Barone&s;s,</HI> how
my Husband u&s;es me; I mu&s;t tell you, Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> there is not a Man in the World &s;o
incomplai&s;ant as him&s;elf, for tho he appears &s;weet
and agreeable, in the bottom he is but four. For
my part, I was born and bred with a Politene&s;s,
which &s;uch ill U&s;age cannot be plea&s;ing to.&endq; &startq;I
believe as much, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere; any one may
have my Soul, by u&s;ing &s;oft and obliging Expre&s;|&s;ions:
but if I am dealt roughly with, I am as hard:
as Iron; all the Devils in Hell, Fairies, Sorcerers,
and Magicians, can never make any thing of me.
Ha! I love you for that, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> you are exactly
of my Temper, we certainly were fa&s;hioned by
the &s;ame Model: But to return to what you told
me, what, is not this Widow your Relation?&endq;
&startq;Good God! no, Madam, <HI>reply'd he, &s;omewhat angry,</HI>
I have told you No once, and tell you &s;o again.
One of her Uncles had the Care of my Hou&s;e,
and when &s;he was young and hand&s;ome, &s;he u&s;ed
often to come and &s;ee him: and as I was young
too, I u&s;ed to tell her fine Stories.&endq; &startq;Oh! fy, fy,
Sir, <HI>cry'd &s;he,</HI> I would not have &s;uch a Woman
brag that &s;he knows me for all the World; and
I'll go and tell her this minute, that if &s;he ever
names me, I'll &s;it as clo&s;e to her as her Shift
to her Back.&endq; &startq;You take things too literally, <HI>re|ply'd
the Cit,</HI> I don't pretend to ca&s;t any Reflection
upon Madam <HI>de Rouet</HI>'s Virtues, what I meant was
in relation to her Quality and mine: for, Ma|dam,
if we come to be &s;o &s;trict in this point, that
all Women were to give as good Proofs of their
Lives and Conver&s;ation, as the Knights of <HI>Maltha</HI>
<PB N="268" REF="269">
do of their Nobility, the virtuous Ladies might
live by them&s;elves. Come, we mu&s;t not be un|charitable.&endq;
&startq;Since your Maxims and mine, Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Dandinardiere, &s;aid Madam</HI> St. Thomas, are
grounded upon different Principles, you will not
take it ami&s;s if I don't believe you.&endq; &startq;Good God!
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> would you upon this fall out with your
Husband?&endq; &startq;Yes, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> you your&s;elf can't but
have &s;een how he carry'd it with the Cit; I al|ways
love to &s;peak my Mind, and between you
and I, I believe he has been acquainted with her
a long while.&endq;</P>
<P>As they were talking thus friendly together, <HI>A|lain</HI>
came in, and interrupted them, gaping and
&s;taring as if he had been &s;tuck, which &s;urprized his
Ma&s;ter; but after &s;ome little pau&s;e, he went clo&s;e
to him, and whi&s;pering him in the Ear, bid him
to prepare for the other World, for that <HI>Villeville</HI>
was in the Wood laughing and prating, as if he
was in no fear of him; that him&s;elf was hid be|hind
a Tree, from whence he could ea&s;ily &s;ee him;
and that he was grown half a Yard taller than he
was before. The Barone&s;s ob&s;erving, that the News
<HI>Alain</HI> brought di&s;turbed the Tranquillity of <HI>Dandi|nardiere</HI>'s
Countenance, told him, that perhaps &s;he
might be trouble&s;ome, and &s;o left him, not a little
plea&s;ed at her ab&s;ence. As &s;oon as &s;he was gone,
and he found him&s;elf at liberty, he asked his Va|let,
if he was &s;ure he had &s;een <HI>Villeville.</HI> &startq;Don't
flatter your&s;elf, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that I was mi&s;taken,
for I &s;aw him as plain as I now &s;ee my own Foot;
and I'll tell you the whole Story: When the&s;e
Ladies came out of your Chamber, I was in the
dark Pa&s;&s;age, and heard one of them &s;ay to the
Gentlemen,&endq; &startq;He is a &s;orry Fellow, a Trade&s;man
in <HI>St. Dennis-Street,</HI> with whom I u&s;ed, &s;ome time
&s;ince, to lay out &s;ome Money; but of late he has
had a great Inclination to counterfeit a Man of
Quality, and &s;o makes &s;port: and as I buy a
great deal upon Credit, I divert my&s;elf with him,
<PB N="269" REF="270">
and call him Cou&s;in, to get the more time, for
we Court-Ladies have not always ready Money.
With a great many more things, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain, which
I cannot remember.&endq; &startq;I find thy Memory is only
good at the&s;e &s;ort of Stories,&endq; <HI>an&s;wer'd his Ma&s;ter.</HI>
Indeed, Sir, <HI>continued</HI> Alain, I'd rather be hang'd
for a Faux&s;onnier, than tell a Lye; for I am &s;ure
I repeat the Words I heard as true as any Conju|rer's
Book. But to return to the&s;e Ladies; I fol|low'd
them very &s;oftly, and crept as clo&s;e to them
as po&s;&s;ible; and as they were chattering and pra|ting,
they heard the trotting of a Hor&s;e, and
upon our looking behind us, who &s;hould appear
but that Hangtrace <HI>Villeville,</HI> who bow'd to them
to the very ground: in the mean time, I trem|bled
like an a&s;pin Leaf, and retired to inform
you.&endq; &startq;This is an Affair, <HI>cry'd</HI> Dandinardiere,
that requires a great deal of Con&s;ideration; &s;ince
my Enemy appears &s;o much hereabouts, and pa&s;|&s;es
and repa&s;&s;es every night and morning, to be
&s;ure he has told the Widow, and &s;he'll&mdash;Why,
<HI>Alain,</HI> why ha&s;t thou no Heart?&endq; &startq;And
what if I had one, Sir, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> what &s;hould we
do?&endq; &startq;What I am very confident we never &s;hall
do, <HI>&s;aid the Cit,</HI> for thou ha&s;t not Courage; what
&s;ignifies my laying Schemes then for thee to exe|cute?
The be&s;t way will be to think of a Re|treat.&endq;
&startq;That's well &s;aid, Sir, <HI>added</HI> Alain, le&s;t
that de&s;perate cutting and &s;la&s;hing Fellow, Mr.
<HI>Robert,</HI> &s;hould play us &s;ome trick.&endq; &startq;But what
&s;hall we do, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere? for if they
&s;hould meet with us upon the Road, we are un|done.&endq;
&startq;Have a little patience, Sir, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Alain;
I'll put you into our Cart, and cover you over
with your Books.&endq; &startq;Excellently well thought on,
<HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere; but fir&s;t go again to the Place
where you &s;aw <HI>Villeville,</HI> and come and tell me
whether he is there.&endq; <HI>Alain</HI> obey'd, and crept up
by a dark &s;hady Alley to the Place where the Com|pany
were, but &s;aw not his Ma&s;ter's dreadful Foe,
<PB N="270" REF="271">
tho he looked carefully all abouts, and afterwards
returned to his Ma&s;ter, to tell him he had nothing
to fear, for that this terrible Myrmydon was gone.
No &s;ooner did this joyful News reach his Ears,
but he cry'd out&punc; &startq;Let us go, and add fre&s;h Lau|rels
to tho&s;e which adorn my Brow. Reach me
my Arms and my Boots, and go and &s;addle my
little <HI>Bucephalus.</HI> What! &s;hall that impudent Var|let
come where I am? I'll teach him to come
here.&endq; <HI>Alain</HI> all this time looked upon his Ma&s;ter
with the utmo&s;t Amazement, but at la&s;t recovering
his Surprize, &s;aid, &startq;Can it be proper to arm your|&s;elf?
your Head is very bad, and your poor Shoul|ders
have not yet recover'd the Damage from the
Adventure of the Bed.&endq; <HI>Dandinard$ere</HI> pretended
not to hear <HI>Alain,</HI> but minding to talk to him&s;elf,
&s;aid, &startq;But to generous Souls, Virtue makes no ac|count
of Years.&endq; And then again, with more Spi|and
Courage; &startq;Shew your&s;elves, ye <HI>Navarrians,
Moors,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tillans.</HI>&endq; And &s;o continued repeating
&s;everal Places of the <HI>Cid.</HI></P>
<P>While he was thus exerci&s;ing him&s;elf for Bat|tel,
he got armed, and then mounted his poor
Palefry, who was much gayer than his Ma&s;ter, by
having five or &s;ix days good Feed in his Belly;
and &s;allied out towards the Wood, with his Lance
in his hand, with which he beat all the Bu&s;hes as
he went along. The noi&s;e he made obliged the
Ladies to turn about, who were &s;urprized at his
Equipage, and bur&s;t out a laughing, e&s;pecially the
Widow, who, to &s;hew her fine Teeth, &s;et up a
hollow again. <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> upon this, to &s;ignalize
him&s;elf, and to revenge the $ffront, &s;eeing her
Cornet, which was adorned with ro&s;e-colour'd Rib|bands,
&s;tanding up very high, made no more to do,
but run his Lance into it, and not only carried it
away, but al&s;o a fal&s;e Tower of fair Hair, which
&s;he wore to conceal her fiery Locks, and left her
quite bare-headed. It may ea&s;ily be thought &s;he
was not a little enraged and vexed; &s;he srkeamed
<PB N="271" REF="272">
out terribly, while the Hor&s;e, frighten'd at the
Ribband$ that hung before his Eyes, and the Noi&s;e
&s;he made, ran away with his Ma&s;ter; who could
not have &s;topped him, had not <HI>Villeville,</HI> who had
left the Company, and as he pa&s;s'd by &s;topped to
&s;peak to Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI> turn'd him&s;elf about, and &s;ee|ing
<HI>Dandinardiere</HI> in that danger, catch'd hold of the
Bridle: and making u&s;e of this opportunity to put
that Project in execution, which the Vi&s;count, the
Prior, and him&s;elf, had concerted, he &s;aid to
him, drawing his Sword, &startq;Well, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dandi|nardiere,</HI>
&s;ince we are thus fortunately met, let us
decide our Quarrel, and cut each other's Throat
genteelly.&endq; Which &s;truck &s;uch a Damp upon his
Spirits, that he was not able to open his Lips; e&s;|pecially
when he &s;aw the Sword glittering before
his Eyes, he had like to have died away with the
Fright. At la&s;t, after a quarter of an hour's &s;i|lence,
he got out, &startq;I will not fight when I am
in Armour; I am a Man of too much Honour, to
fight with &s;o great an Advantage.&endq; &startq;Have-at-you
then, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Villeville, (clapping the point of his
Sword to his Throat.) Upon which <HI>Dandinardiere</HI>
falling off his Hor&s;e, cry'd out,&endq; &startq;Oh! Mr. <HI>Robert,</HI>
I am dead; come and bleed me pre&s;ently. Oh!
good dear Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villeville,</HI> don't kill me; I beg
my Life, and if this Habit of War di&s;plea&s;es you,
I'll renounce it for ever.&endq; &startq;There's only one
thing, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Villeville, that can &s;ave you from my
Rage; I will give you your Life, provided you
will promi&s;e me to marry one of the Madam <HI>St.
Thomes's.</HI>&endq; &startq;Name which, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Dandinardiere, for
if you order me, I'll marry them both, and the
Father and Mother too.&endq; &startq;I leave you to your
own choice, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Villeville; but if you don't make
u&s;e of the Honour that I would procure for you,
depend upon it I'll kill you, if you are a hundred
foot under ground.&endq; The Git, thinking him&s;elf
the happie&s;t of all Men, to come off &s;o well, got
up, &s;haking like one in an Ague, and ca&s;t him&s;elf
<PB N="272" REF="273">
at the feet of his terrible Enemy, a&s;&s;uring him,
that he would neglect nothing, that lay in his
power to obey him in: and to &s;hew his Submi&s;&s;ion,
ask'd to ki&s;s his hand, which <HI>Villeville</HI> gravely held
out; telling him withal, that he thought it would
be mo&s;t proper for him to ask <HI>Virginia</HI> of Mon&s;ieur
<HI>St. Thomas,</HI> who would be brought to give his con|&s;ent
the more ea&s;ily. When he &s;aw that he had
forgiven him, and that they were Friends; &startq;You
&s;hall now pre&s;cribe me Laws, <HI>an&s;wer'd the Cit,</HI>
and I'll agree to whatever you negotiate.&endq; <HI>Ville|ville,</HI>
fortified with this Promi&s;e, returned back a|gain,
and taking the Vi&s;count and Prior a&s;ide, told
them, that there was no occa&s;ion to bring Mr. <HI>Ro|bert</HI>
upon the Stage, and to contrive a Meeting for
him&s;elf and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> &s;ince Chance had effected
what they might have found more difficult than
they imagin'd; and then told what had happen'd.
The&s;e two Gentlemen were not a little plea&s;ed at
this News, and re&s;olved, without lo&s;ing any time,
to conclude the Marriage; but were in &s;ome em|bara&s;&s;ment,
le&s;t the Widow, upon this account,
&s;hould &s;ubmit to a Reconciliation with her Cou&s;in,
and advi&s;e him to the contrary; till <HI>Villeville</HI> in|form'd
them, that he had &s;ome A&s;cendant over her,
and would let her into the Secret; a&s;&s;uring them,
that &s;he would be overjoy'd at this Mark of Con|fidence,
and would &s;econd them in their Project.
And accordingly he goes to her, while the Vi&s;|count
di&s;cour&s;ed Mon&s;ieur <HI>St. Thomas,</HI> who receiv'd
the Propo&s;al agreeably enough. As for Madam <HI>St.
Thomas,</HI> &s;he con&s;ented to it by a Fit of Caprice,
which &s;eldom la&s;ted long, and <HI>Virginia</HI> received it
with Joy, being prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd that <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was
a Hero, that had performed &s;everal noble Exploits.
So that they, who had all been, as one may &s;ay,
at Daggers-drawing &s;ome hours before, were very
good Friends. When <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> came to them,
he trembled, and was as pale as death; every one
received him with open Arms, and endeavoured to
<PB N="273" REF="274">
make him forget the Cata&s;trophe attending his
Combat. In &s;hort, he demanded <HI>Virginia</HI> in form,
was favourably received, and the Vi&s;count propo|&s;ed
to return in a doors, to draw up the Articles.
But how great was poor <HI>Alain</HI>'s A&s;toni&s;hment, to
&s;ee the Wolves and Lambs herding together, mean|ing
<HI>Villeville</HI> and <HI>Dandinardiere,</HI> who embraced one
another every minute, and were continually &s;ha|king
hands. He &s;tood &s;tock &s;till, gaping and &s;taring
like one frighten'd; but when he was told that his
Ma&s;ter was to marry <HI>Virginia,</HI> and that his Happi|ne&s;s
was entirely owing to the Management of
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villeville,</HI> he went &s;inging, jumping, and
dancing about the Hou&s;e, ju&s;t out of his Sen&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was di&s;armed by young Madam <HI>St.
Thomas</HI> like another Don <HI>Quixote,</HI> and bedecked
with Flowers, every one calling him by &s;ome merry
Name or other; till the Baron, who began now to
be intere&s;ted him&s;elf, de&s;ired the Vi&s;count, Prior,
and <HI>Villeville,</HI> to look upon him as one who was to
be his Son-in-Law. From that very night, Turkeys,
Chickens, Ducks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> went all to the Spit and
Pot, for Mon&s;ieur <HI>St. Thomas</HI> was at all the Ex|pences
of the Wedding, which was all the Portion
the Cit was to have with his Wife, be&s;ides the
knack of making Stories, which might be inherited
by their Po&s;terity. However, <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> was &s;a|tisfied,
or at lea&s;t pretended to be &s;o, out of his
Dread of <HI>Villeville,</HI> without whom the Match had
never been brought to bear. And after &s;ome days
of Mirth and Fea&s;ting, <HI>Dandinardiere</HI> took his Wife
home, accompanied with her Si&s;ter; and left <HI>Alain,</HI>
with his Cart and A&s;&s;es, behind, to bring his
Study.</P>
