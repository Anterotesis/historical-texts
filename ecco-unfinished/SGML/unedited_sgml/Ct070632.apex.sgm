<HEAD>Proper for the Reader to be ac|quainted with.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t publi&s;hed the life of this beautiful Lady, which was in the year 1724, I &s;ent one of the books, as a pre&s;ent, to my old friend and acquaintance Mr. Thomas Sou|therne, author of the Tragedy of Oroonoko.</P>
<P>When he had read my book, he paid me a vi&s;it at my hou&s;e in I&s;ling|ton; and, agreeable to his u&s;ual face|tiou&s;ne&s;s, for he was an excellent companion, rallied me &s;everely in my making the Lady, the Heroine of the work, &s;o unnatural to her children in her di&s;owning them; and added, that what I had related concerning
<PB N="2" REF="6">
her circum&s;tances, as to her poverty, in the latter part of her life, he knew to be fal&s;e; for, on the contrary, he knew her not only to be rich, but very rich; and he was &s;o free with me, as to tell me that I knew it al&s;o; and that, he imagined, I afflicted her, in that particular, for the &s;ake of the moral only, that her wickedne&s;s, he &s;aid, as I was plea&s;ed to call it, might not go unpuni&s;hed. He further ad|ded, her deportment, elegance of manners, and graceful behaviour, were equal, if not &s;uperior, to the beauty of her features, and that he ever at|tributed her &s;ucce&s;&s;es to the former, as much as to the latter; yet, &s;aid he, her complexion and features were &s;o happily, and &s;o agreeably united, that when &s;he was at the age of forty, no per&s;on whatever in her company could have believed &s;he exceeded four-and-twenty; nay, he added, when he &s;aw her in the fiftieth year of her age, had &s;he not told him her&s;elf to the con|trary, he &s;hould not have taken her to be much above thirty.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7">
He &s;till further added, &s;he was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two ine&s;timable jew|els; that is to &s;ay, a good head, and a good heart; the fruits of whom, her friends were &s;ure always to be plen|tifully provided at her table; the one from her agreeable conver&s;ation and politene&s;s; the other from her gene|ro&s;ity and liberality; as were likewi&s;e the poor, who had their &s;hare of the latter, and who were &s;eldom or ever &s;ent empty away. And though &s;he fre|quently in her reflections, calls her|&s;elf a pro&s;titute; a &s;trumpet; yet, &s;aid he, in the true &s;en&s;e of the words, &s;he was as cha&s;te, with re&s;pect to the per&s;on whom &s;he lived with, as the mo&s;t virtuous wife could be to a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>In my excu&s;e, for Mr. Southerne is an excellent judge of what is proper in hi&s;tory, as well as in poetry; I told him, as to that part concerning her children, I not only had it from her original papers, but al&s;o from the Lady her&s;elf, in the &s;everal conver&s;a|tions
<PB N="4" REF="8">
that had pa&s;&s;ed between us, and tho&s;e &s;o lately as the year 1723, in which year &s;he died; and the rea&s;ons &s;he gave me were: &s;he was, &s;he &s;aid, terrified, in her thinking of her two elde&s;t daughters, who &s;urvived her, and who are both married, to whom &s;he gave ample fortunes; I &s;ay &s;he was terrified, for fear they &s;hould ever come to the knowledge of the wicked cour&s;e of life &s;he had formerly led, both in England and in France.</P>
<P>But upon my Friend's &s;aying &s;o much to me, and he giving me &s;ome few hints, has occa&s;ioned me to re|&s;tore the children, and alter the cata&s;|trophe, by re&s;cuing her from that pretended poverty, though not from her remor&s;e, which at the conclu&s;ion, I before had plunged her in.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of this extraordinary Lady, is to &s;peak for it&s;elf. If it is not as beautiful as the lady her&s;elf was known to be; if it is not as diverting as the reader can de|&s;ire,
<PB N="5" REF="9">
and much more than he can rea&s;onably expect; and if all the mo&s;t diverting parts of it are not adapted to the in&s;truction and improvement of the Reader, it mu&s;t be from the defect of my own performance; dre&s;|&s;ing up the &s;tory wor&s;e than the Lady, who&s;e words I relate, prepar|ed it for the world.</P>
<P>Though &s;he had in her hi&s;tory of her life, omitted the names, yet as I afterwards came to the knowledge of the per&s;ons whom &s;he meant, and, what &s;he had &s;aid of them, except|ing of her husband, and his &s;i&s;ter, being much to their credit, I have thought proper to in&s;ert them. She likewi&s;e went on with her hi&s;tory, from the beginning to the end, with|out any ob&s;truction: I have thought proper, for the ea&s;e of the reader, to throw it into chapters; that he, like a traveller on the road, when he e&s;pies a good inn, may put up his hor&s;e, and re&s;t both him&s;elf and his bea&s;t; may al&s;o when tired, lay down
<PB N="6" REF="10">
the book, at the &s;everal re&s;ting places, I before have appointed.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to &s;ay, that this &s;tory differs from mo&s;t of the modern performances of this kind, though &s;ome of them have met with a very good reception in the world: I &s;ay, it differs from them in this great and e&s;&s;ential article, namely, that the foundation of this is laid in truth of fact; and &s;o the work is not a &s;tory, but a hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>I was particularly acquainted with this lady's fir&s;t husband, Mr. Ba|con, the Brewer, and with his bad cir|cum&s;tances; I knew his father al&s;o, and know that fir&s;t part of the &s;tory to be truth.</P>
<P>This may, I hope, be a pledge for the credit of the re&s;t; and though &s;ome part of her hi&s;tory lay abroad, and cannot &s;o well be vouched as
<PB N="7" REF="11">
the fir&s;t; yet, as &s;he told it to me her&s;elf, I have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to que&s;tion the truth of that part al&s;o.</P>
<P>In the manner &s;he has told the &s;tory, it is evident &s;he does not in&s;i&s;t upon her ju&s;tification in any one part of it; much le&s;s does &s;he re|commend her conduct, or indeed, any part of it, except her re|pentance to our imitation: On the contrary, &s;he makes frequent excur|&s;ions, in a ju&s;t cen&s;uring and con|demning her own practice. How often does &s;he reproach her&s;elf in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate manner; and guide us to ju&s;t reflections in the like ca&s;es?</P>
<P>It is true, &s;he met with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, in all her intrigues; but even in the highe&s;t elevations of her pro&s;perity, &s;he makes frequent ac|knowledgments, that the plea&s;ure of her wickedne&s;s was not worth the pain of the repentance; and that all
<PB N="8" REF="12">
the &s;atisfaction &s;he had, all the joy in the view of her pro&s;perity, no, nor all the wealth &s;he rolled in; the gaiety of her appearance; the equi|pages, and the honours, &s;he was at|tended with, could quiet her mind, abate the reproaches of her con&s;ci|ence, or procure her an hour's &s;leep, when ju&s;t reflections kept her wak|ing.</P>
<P>The noble inferences that are drawn from this one part, are worth all the re&s;t of the &s;tory; and abundantly ju&s;tify, as they are the profe&s;&s;ed de|&s;ign of, the publication.</P>
<P>If there are any parts in her &s;tory, which being obliged to relate a wick|ed action, &s;eem to de&s;cribe it too plainly; all imaginable care has been taken to keep clear of indecencies, and immode&s;t expre&s;&s;ions; and 'tis hoped you will find nothing to prompt a vicious mind, but every where much to di&s;courage and expo&s;e it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="13">
Scenes of crime can &s;carce be re|pre&s;ented in &s;uch a manner, but &s;ome may make a criminal u&s;e of them; but when vice is painted in its low|prized colours, 'tis not to make peo|ple in love with it, but to expo&s;e it; and if the reader makes a wrong u&s;e of the figures, the wickedne&s;s is his own.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the advantages of the pre&s;ent work are &s;o great, and the virtuous reader has room for &s;o much improvement, that I make no que&s;tion, the &s;tory will find a pa&s;&s;age to his be&s;t hours; and be read both with profit and delight.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY Of Mademoi&s;elle de Beleau; Or, ROXANA, The Fortunate Mi&s;tre&s;s: Afterwards Counte&s;s of Wint&s;el&s;heim.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>A Wedding, and an Elopement.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY Father, Mr. John de Beleau, was a merchant, in the city of Poictiers, in the province, or county of Poictou, in France; from whence I was brought to England by my parents, when I was about ten years of age, where my fa|ther lived in very good circum&s;tances, and died in about eleven years after he came to London; in which time, as I had accompli&s;hed my&s;elf for the &s;ociable part of the world, &s;o I had ac|quainted my&s;elf with &s;ome of our Engli&s;h neigh|bours, as is the cu&s;tom in London; and as, while I was young, I had picked-up three or four play-fellows and companions, &s;uitable to my years; &s;o, as we grew bigger, we learnt to call one|another intimates and friends; and this forwarded
<PB N="2" REF="16">
very much the fini&s;hing me for conver&s;ation, and the world.</P>
<P>I went to Engli&s;h &s;chools, and being young, I learnt the Engli&s;h tongue perfectly well, with all the cu&s;toms, of the Engli&s;h young Lad$es; &s;o that I re|tained nothing of the French but the language; nor did I &s;o much as keep any remains of the French accent in &s;peaking, as mo&s;t foreigners do, but &s;poke what we call natural Engli&s;h, as if I had been born here.</P>
<P>Being to give my own character, I mu&s;t be ex|cu&s;ed to give it as impartially as po&s;&s;ible, and as if I was &s;peaking of another per&s;on; and the &s;e|quel will lead you to judge whether I flatter my|&s;elf or no.</P>
<P>I was, unle&s;s I was flattered, at the age of four|teen, tall, and extremely well &s;haped; being French born, I danced, as &s;ome &s;ay, naturally, loved it exceedingly, played on the harp&s;ichord, and &s;ung well al&s;o, and &s;o well, that as you will hear, it was afterwards &s;ome advantage to me. With all the&s;e accompli&s;hments, I wanted neither wit, beauty, or fortune. In this manner I &s;et out into the world, having all the advantages that any young woman could de&s;ire, to recommend me to others, and form a pro&s;pect of happy living to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>One day, when my father returned from hunt|ing, he brought home with him to dine, a Mr. Bacon, a brewer; I was then turned of fifteen. This per&s;on by frequently coming to our hou&s;e, at length, made his addre&s;&s;es in form, and having my father's con&s;ent, he not only al&s;o obtained mine, but a portion of two thou&s;and pounds be&s;ides.</P>
<P>With this precious thing called a hu&s;band, I lived eight years, and for &s;ome part of the time,
<PB N="3" REF="17">
kept a coach, that is to &s;ay, a kind of mock-coach; for all the week the hor&s;es were kept at work in the dray-carts, but on Sunday I had the privilege to go abroad in it, either to church, or otherways, as my hu&s;band and I could agree; which, by the way, was not very often: but of that hereafter.</P>
<P>Before I proceed in the hi&s;tory of the married part of my life, you mu&s;t allow me to give as impartial an account of my hu&s;band, as I have done of my&s;elf. He was a jolly, hand&s;ome fel|low, as any woman need wi&s;h for a companion; tall, and well made: he danced well, which, I think, was the fir&s;t thing that brought us to|gether: he had a father, who managed the bu|&s;ine&s;s carefully, &s;o that he had little of that part lay on him, but now-and-then to appear, and &s;how him&s;elf; and he took the advantage of it, for he troubled him&s;elf very little about it, but went abroad, kept company, hunted much, and loved it exceedingly.</P>
<P>After I have told you that he was a hand&s;ome man, and a good &s;port&s;man, I have, indeed, &s;aid all; and unhappy was I, like other young peo|ple of our &s;ex, I cho&s;e him, as I have &s;aid, for being hand&s;ome; for he was otherwi&s;e a weak, empty-headed, untaught creature, as ever any wo|man could de&s;ire to be coupled with: and here I mu&s;t take the liberty, whatever I have to reproach my&s;elf with in my after-conduct, to turn to my fellow-creatures, the young Ladies of this country, and &s;peak to them by way of precaution. If you have any regard to your future happine&s;s, any view of living comfortably with a hu&s;band, any hope of pre&s;erving your for|tunes, or re&s;toring them after any di&s;a&s;ter; never, Ladies, marry a fool; any hu&s;band rather than a fool: with &s;ome other hu&s;bands you may be un|happy,
<PB N="4" REF="18">
but with a fool you will be mi&s;erable: with another hu&s;band you may, I &s;ay, be unhap|py, but with a fool you mu&s;t; nay, if he would, he cannot make you ea&s;y; every thing he does is &s;o aukward, every thing he &s;ays is &s;o empty, a woman of any &s;en&s;e cannot but be &s;urfeited, and &s;ick of him many times a-day: what is more &s;hocking, than for a woman to bring a hand&s;ome comely fellow of a hu&s;band into company, and then be obliged to blu&s;h for him every time &s;he hears him &s;peak? To hear other Gentlemen talk &s;en&s;e, and he able to &s;ay nothing? and &s;o look like a fool, or, which is wor&s;e, hear him talk non|&s;en&s;e, and be laughed at for a fool.</P>
<P>In the next place, there are &s;o many &s;orts of fools, &s;uch an infinite variety of fools, and &s;o hard it is to know the wor&s;t of that kind, that I am obliged to &s;ay, no fool, Ladies, at all, no kind of fool; whether a mad fool, or a &s;ober fool, a wi&s;e fool, or a &s;illy fool; take any thing but a fool; nay, be any thing, be even an old-maid, the wor&s;t of nature's cur&s;es, rather than take up with a fool.</P>
<P>But to leave this a-while, for I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to &s;peak of it again; my ca&s;e was particu|larly hard, for I had a variety of fooli&s;h things complicated in this unhappy match.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He was a conceited fool: he would have it, every thing he &s;aid, was right, was be&s;t, and was to the purpo&s;e, whoever was in company, and whatever was advanced by others, though with the greate&s;t mode&s;ty imaginable; and yet when he came to defend what he had &s;aid, he would do it &s;o weakly, &s;o emptily, and &s;o nothing to the purpo&s;e, that it was enough to make any-body that heard him, &s;ick and a&s;hamed of him.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="19">
Secondly, He was po&s;itive and ob&s;tinate, and the mo&s;t po&s;itive in the mo&s;t &s;imple and incon&s;i&s;tent things, &s;uch as were intolerable to bear.</P>
<P>The&s;e two articles, if there had been no more, qualified him to be a mo&s;t unbearable creature for a hu&s;band; and &s;o it may be &s;uppo&s;ed at fir&s;t &s;ight, what a kind of life I led with him: however, I did as well as I could, and held my tongue, which was the only victory I gained over him; for when he would talk after his own empty rattling way with me, and I would not an&s;wer, or enter into di&s;cour&s;e with him on the point he was upon, he would ri&s;e up in the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;ion imaginable, and go away; which was the cheape&s;t way I had to get rid of him.</P>
<P>I could enlarge here much, upon the method I took to make my life pa&s;&s;able and ea&s;y with the mo&s;t incorrigible temper in the world; but it is too long, and the articles too trifling: I &s;hall mention &s;ome of them as the circum&s;tances I am to relate, &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily bring them in.</P>
<P>After I had been married about four years, my own father died, my mother having been dead before. He liked my match &s;o ill, and &s;aw &s;o little room to be &s;atisfied with the conduct of my hu&s;band, that though he left me five thou&s;and livres, and more at his death, yet he left it in the hands of my elder brother, who running on too ra&s;hly in his adventures, as a merchant, failed, and lo&s;t not only what he had of his own, but what he had for me too; as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Thus I lo&s;t the la&s;t gift of my father's bounty, by having a hu&s;band not fit to be tru&s;ted with it; there is one of the benefits of marrying a fool.</P>
<P>Within two years after my own father's death, my hu&s;band's father al&s;o died, and, as I thought,
<PB N="6" REF="20">
left him a con&s;iderable addition to his e&s;tate, the whole trade of the brewhou&s;e, which was a very good one, being now his own.</P>
<P>But this addition to his &s;tock was his ruin, for he had no genius to bu&s;ine&s;s; he had no knowledge of his accounts; he bu&s;tled a little about it indeed, at fir&s;t, and put on a face of bu&s;ine&s;s, but he &s;oon grew &s;lack; it was below him to in&s;pect his books, he committed all that to his clerk; and while he found money in ca&s;h to pay the malt&s;ter, and the exci&s;e, and put &s;ome in his pocket, he was perfectly ea&s;y and indolent, let the main chance go how it would.</P>
<P>I fore&s;aw the con&s;equence of this, and at|tempted &s;everal times to per&s;uade him to apply him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s; I put him in mind how his cu&s;tomers complained of the neglect of his &s;er|vants on the one hand, and how abundance broke in his debt, on the other, for want of the clerk's care to &s;ecure him: yet he thru&s;t me by, either with hard words, or fraudulently, with repre&s;ent|ing the ca&s;es otherwi&s;e than they were.</P>
<P>However, to cut &s;hort a dull &s;tory, which ought not to be long, he began to find his trade &s;unk, his &s;tock declined, and that, in &s;hort, he could not carry on his bu&s;ine&s;s, and twice his brewing uten&s;ils were extented for the exci&s;e; and the la&s;t time he was put to great extremities to clear them.</P>
<P>This alarmed him, and he re&s;olved to lay down his trade; which, indeed, I was not &s;orry for; fore&s;eeing that if he did not lay it down in time, he would be forced to do it another way, namely, as a bankrupt. Al&s;o I was willing he &s;hould draw out while he had &s;omething left, le&s;t I &s;hould come to be &s;tript at home, and be turned out of doors with my children; for I had now
<PB N="7" REF="21">
five children by him; the only work, perhaps, that fools are good for.</P>
<P>I thought my&s;elf happy when he got another man to take his brewhou&s;e clear off of his hands; for paying down a large &s;um of money, my hu&s;band found him&s;elf a clear man, all his debts paid, and with between two and three thou|&s;and pounds in his pocket: and being now o|bliged to remove from the brewhou&s;e, we took a hou&s;e at Kenti&s;h-town, a village about two miles from London; and happy I thought my&s;elf, all things con&s;idered, that I was got off clear, upon &s;o good terms; and had my hand&s;ome fellow had but a few grains of wit, I had been &s;till well enough.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed to him either to buy &s;ome place with the money, or with part of it, and offered to join my part to it, which was then in being, and might have been &s;ecured; &s;o we might have lived tolerably, at lea&s;t, during his life. But as it is the part of a fool to be void of coun&s;el, &s;o he neglected it, lived on as he did before, kept his hor&s;es and men, rid every day out to the fore&s;t a hunting, and nothing was done all this while; but the money decrea&s;ed apace, and I thought I &s;aw my ruin ha&s;tening on, without any po&s;&s;ible way to prevent it.</P>
<P>I was not wanting with all that per&s;ua&s;ions and entreaties could perform, but it was all fruitle&s;s. Repre&s;enting to him how fa&s;t our money wa&s;ted and what would be our condition when it was gone, made no impre&s;&s;ion on him; but, like one &s;tupid, he went on, not valuing all that tears and lamentations could be &s;uppo&s;ed to do; nor did he abate his figure or equipage, his hor&s;es or
<PB N="8" REF="22">
&s;ervants, even to the la&s;t; till he had not a hun|dred pound left in the whole world.</P>
<P>It was not above three years that all the rea|dy-money was thus &s;pending off; yet he &s;pent it, as I may &s;ay, fooli&s;hly too, for he kept no valuable company neither; but generally with hunt&s;men and hor&s;e-coar&s;ers, and men meaner than him&s;elf, which is another con&s;equence of a man's being a fool; &s;uch can never take de|light in men more wi&s;e and capable than them|&s;elves; and that makes them conver&s;e with &s;coun|drels, drink with porters, and keep company al|ways below them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This was my wretched &s;tate, when one morn|ing my hu&s;band told me, he was &s;en&s;ible he was come to a mi&s;erable condition, and he would go and &s;eek his fortune &s;omewhere or other. He had &s;aid &s;omething to that purpo&s;e &s;everal times be|fore that, upon my pre&s;&s;ing him to con&s;ider his circum&s;tances, and the circum&s;tances of his family before it &s;hould be too late: but as I found he had no meaning in any thing of that kind, as indeed, he had not much in any thing he ever &s;aid; &s;o I thought they were but words of cour&s;e now. When he &s;aid he would be gone, I u&s;ed to wi&s;h &s;ecretly, and even &s;ay in my thoughts, I wi&s;h you would, for if you go on thus, you will &s;tarve us all.</P>
<P>He &s;tayed, however, at home all that day, and lay at home that night; early the next morning he gets out of bed, goes to a window which looked out towards the &s;tables, and &s;ounds his French-horn, as he called it; which was his u&s;ual &s;ignal to call his men to go out a hunting.</P>
<P>It was the latter-end of Augu&s;t, and &s;o was light yet at five o'clock, and it was about that time that I heard him and his two men go out
<PB REF="23">

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>A Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;Fidelity of a Servant.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be a little &s;urpri&s;ing to the reader to tell him at once, that after this, I never &s;aw my hu&s;band more; but to go farther, I not only ne|ver &s;aw him more, but I never heard from him, or of him, neither of any or either of his two &s;er|vants, or of the hor&s;es, either what became of them, where, or which way they went, or what they did, or intended to do, no more than if the ground had opened and &s;wallowed them all up, and no-body had known it, for &s;everal years after.</P>
<P>I was not, for the fir&s;t night or two, at all &s;urprized, no nor very much the fir&s;t week or two, believing that if any thing evil had befallen them, I &s;hould &s;oon enough have heard of that; and al&s;o knowing that he had two &s;ervants and three hor&s;es with him, it would be the &s;trange&s;t thing in the world that any thing could befal them all, but that I mu&s;t &s;ome time or other hear of them.</P>
<P>But you will ea&s;ily allow, that as time run on a week, two weeks, a month, two months, and &s;o on, I was dreadfully frighted at la&s;t, and the more when I looked into my own circum&s;tances, and con&s;idered the condition in which I was left; with five children, and no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them, excepting about &s;eventy pounds in money,
<PB N="10" REF="24">
and what few things of value I had about me, which, though con&s;iderable in them&s;elves, were yet nothing to feed a family, and for a length of time too.</P>
<P>What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have recour&s;e. To keep in the hou&s;e where I was, I could not, the rent being too great; and to leave it without his order, if my hu&s;band &s;hould re|turn, I could not think of that neither; &s;o that I continued extremely perplexed, melancholy, and di&s;couraged, to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>I remained in this dejected condition near a twelvemonth. My hu&s;band had two &s;i&s;ters, who were married, and lived very well, and &s;ome o|ther near relations that I knew of, and I hoped would do &s;omething for me; and I frequently &s;ent to the&s;e, to know if they could give me any account of my vagrant creature; but they all declared to me in an&s;wer, that they knew no|thing about him; and after frequent &s;ending, began to think me trouble&s;ome, and to let me know they thought &s;o too, by their treating my maid with very &s;light and unhand&s;ome returns to her inquiries.</P>
<P>This grated hard, and added to my affliction; but I had no recour&s;e but to my tears, for I had not a friend of my own left me in the world: I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that it was about half a year before this elopement of my hu&s;band, that the di&s;a&s;ter I mentioned above befel my bro|ther; who broke, and that in &s;uch bad cir|cum&s;tances, that I had the mortification to hear not only that he was in pri&s;on, but that there would be little or nothing to be had by way of compo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="25">
Misfortunes &s;eldom come alone: this was the forerunner of my hu&s;band's flight; and as my expectations were cut off on that &s;ide, my hu&s;|band gone, and my family of children on my hands, and nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them, my con|dition was the mo&s;t deplorable that words can expre&s;s.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome plate and &s;ome jewels, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed, my fortune and former circum|&s;tances con&s;idered; and my hu&s;band, who had never &s;tayed to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, had not been put to the nece&s;&s;ity of rifling me, as hu&s;bands u&s;ually do in &s;uch ca&s;es: but as I had &s;een an end of all the ready-money, during the long time I had lived in a &s;tate of expectation for my hu&s;band, &s;o I began to make away one thing after another, till tho&s;e few things of value which I had, be|gan to le&s;&s;en apace, and I &s;aw nothing but mi&s;ery and the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s before me, even to have my children &s;tarve before my face. I leave any one that is a mother of children, and has lived in plenty and genteelly, to con&s;ider and reflect, what mu&s;t be my condition. As to my hu&s;band, I had now no hope or expectation of &s;eeing him any more: and, indeed, if I had, he was the man, of all the men in the world, the lea&s;t able to help me, or to have turned his hand to the gaining one &s;hilling towards le&s;&s;ening our di&s;tre&s;s; he neither had the capacity or the inclination; he could have been no clerk, for he &s;carce wrote a legible hand; he was &s;o far from being able to write &s;en&s;e, that he could not make &s;en&s;e of what others wrote; he was &s;o far from under&s;tanding good Engli&s;h, that he could not &s;pell good Engli&s;h: to be out of all bu&s;ine&s;s was his de|light;
<PB N="12" REF="26">
and he would &s;tand leaning again&s;t a po&s;t for half an hour together, with a pipe in his mouth, with all the tranquility in the world, &s;mokeing, like Dryden's Clown, who
<Q>&mdash;whi&s;tled as he went for want of thought;</Q>
and this even when his family was as it were &s;tarving, that little he had wa&s;ting, and that we were all bleeding to death; he not knowing, and as little con&s;idering, where to get another &s;hilling when the la&s;t was &s;pent.</P>
<P>This being his temper, and the extent of his capacity, I confe&s;s I did not &s;ee &s;o much lo&s;s in his parting with me, as at fir&s;t I thought I did; though it was hard and cruel to the la&s;t degree in him, not giving me the lea&s;t notice of his de&s;ign; and, indeed, that which I was mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed at, was, that &s;eeing he mu&s;t certainly have in|tended this e$cur&s;ion &s;ome few moments at lea&s;t, before he put it in practice, yet he did not come and take what little &s;tock of money we had left; or at lea&s;t, a &s;hare of it, to bear his expence for a little while: but he did not; and I am morally certain he had not five guineas with him in the world, when he went away: all that I could come to the knowledge of, about him, was, that he left his hunting-horn, which he called the French-horn in the &s;table, and his hunting-&s;addle, went away in a hand&s;ome furniture, as they call it, which he u&s;ed &s;ometimes to travel with; hav|ing an embroidered hou&s;ing, a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols, and other things belonging to them; and one of his &s;ervants had another &s;addle with pi&s;tols, though plain; and the other a long gun; &s;o that they did not go out as &s;port&s;men, but ra|ther as travellers: what part of the world they went to, I never heard for many years.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="27">
As I have &s;aid, I &s;ent to his relations, but they &s;ent me &s;hort and &s;urly an&s;wers; nor did any one of them offer to come to &s;ee me, or to &s;ee the children, or &s;o much as to enquire after them, well perceiving that I was in a condition that was likely to be &s;oon trouble&s;ome: but it was no time now to dally with them, or with the world; I left off &s;ending, and went my&s;elf among them; laid my circum&s;tances open, told them my whole ca&s;e, and the condition I was reduced to, begged they would advi&s;e me what cour&s;e to take, laid my&s;elf as low as they could de&s;ire, and intreated them to con&s;ider that I was not in a condition to help my&s;elf, and that without &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we mu&s;t all inevitably peri&s;h: I told them, that if I had but one child, or two children, I would have done my endeavour to have worked for them with my needle, and &s;hould only have come to beg them to help me to &s;ome work, that I might get our bread by my la|bour; but to think of one &s;ingle woman not bred to work, and at a lo&s;s where to get em|ployment, to get the bread for five children, that was not po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome of my children being young too, and none of them big enough to help one another.</P>
<P>It was all one. I received not the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from any-body, was hardly a&s;ked to &s;it down at the two &s;i&s;ters hou&s;es, nor offered to eat or drink at two more near relations. The fifth, an ancient gentlewoman, a Mrs. Goodwill, aunt|in-law to my hu&s;band, a widow, and the lea&s;t able of any, did, indeed, a&s;k me to &s;it down, gave me a dinner, and refre&s;hed me with a kinder treatment than any of the re&s;t; but added the melancholly part, viz. That &s;he would have
<PB N="14" REF="28">
helped me, but that, indeed, &s;he was not able: which, however, I was &s;atisfied was very true.</P>
<P>Here I relieved my&s;elf with the con&s;tant a&s;|&s;i&s;tant of the afflicted, I mean tears; for rela|ting to her how I was received by the other of my hu&s;band's relations, it made me bur&s;t into tears, and I cried vehemently for a great while together, till I made the good old Lady cry too &s;everal times.</P>
<P>However, I came home from them all with|out any relief, and went on at home till I was reduced to &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;tre&s;s, that it is not to be de&s;cribed. I had been &s;everal times after this at the old aunt's; for I prevailed with her to promi&s;e me to go and talk with the other relations; at lea&s;t, that, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;he could bring &s;ome of them to take my children, or to contribute &s;omething towards their mainte|nance; and, to do her ju&s;tice, &s;he did u&s;e her endeavour with them, but all was to no pur|po&s;e, they would do nothing, at lea&s;t that way: I think, with much entreaty, &s;he obtained, by a kind of collection among them all, about eleven or twelve &s;hillings; which, though it was a pre|&s;ent comfort, was not yet to be named as ca|pable to deliver me from any part of the load that lay upon me.</P>
<P>There was a poor woman, a Mrs. Barton, that had been a kind of a dependant upon our family, and who I had often, among the re&s;t of the relations, been very kind to; my maid put it into my head one morning to &s;end to this poor woman, and to &s;ee whether &s;he might not be able to help, in this dreadful ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t remember it here, to the prai&s;e of this poor girl, my maid, that though I was not able
<PB N="15" REF="29">
to give her any wages, and had told her &s;o, yet &s;he would not leave me; nay, and as long as &s;he had any money, when I had none, &s;he would help me out of her own.</P>
<P>Amy, for that was her name, put it into my thoughts to &s;end for this poor woman to come to me, for I was now in great di&s;tre&s;s, and I re&s;olved to do &s;o; but ju&s;t the very morning that I intended it, the old aunt, with the poor woman in her company, came to &s;ee me: the good old Gentlewoman was, it &s;eems, heartily concerned for me, and had been talking again among tho&s;e people, to &s;ee what &s;he could do for me; bur to very little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>You &s;hall judge a little of my pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s by the po&s;ture they found me in: I had five &s;mall children, the elde&s;t was under ten years old, and I had not one &s;hilling in the hou&s;e to buy them victuals, but had &s;ent Amy out with a &s;mall &s;ilver &s;poon, to &s;ell it, and bring home &s;omething from the butcher's; and I was in a parlour, &s;itting on the ground, with a great heap of old linen rags, and other things about me, looking them over, to &s;ee if I had any thing among them that would &s;ell or pawn for a little money, and had been crying ready to bur&s;t my|&s;elf, to think what I &s;hould do next.</P>
<P>At this juncture they knocked at the door. I thought it had been Amy, &s;o I did not ri&s;e up, but one of the children opened the door, and they came directly into the room where I was, and where they found me in that po&s;ture, and crying vehemently, as above. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at their coming, you may be &s;ure, e&s;pecially &s;eeing the per&s;on I had ju&s;t before re&s;olved to &s;end for: but when they &s;aw me, how I looked, for my
<PB N="16" REF="30">
eyes were &s;welled with crying, and what a con|dition I was in as to the hou&s;e, and the heaps of things that were about me, and e&s;pecially when I told them what I was doing, and on what occa&s;ion, they &s;at down, like Job's three comforters, and &s;aid not one word to me for a great while, but both of them cried as fa&s;t, and as heartily as I did.</P>
<P>The truth was, there was no need of much di&s;cour&s;e in the ca&s;e, the thing &s;poke it&s;elf. They &s;aw me in want and mi&s;ery, who but a little be|fore lived in affluence and &s;plendor; thin, dejected and pale, who was lately comely and beauti|ful: the hou&s;e, that was before hand&s;omely fur|ni&s;hed with pictures and ornaments, cabinets, pier-gla&s;&s;es, and every thing &s;uitable, was now &s;tripped, and naked, mo&s;t of the goods having been &s;eized by the landlord for rent, or &s;old to buy nece&s;&s;aries; in a word, all was mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s; the face of ruin was every where to be &s;een; we had eaten up almo&s;t every thing, and little remained, unle&s;s, like one of the pitiful wo|men of Jeru&s;alem, I &s;hould eat up my very children them&s;elves.</P>
<P>After the&s;e two good creatures had &s;at, as I &s;ay, in &s;ilence &s;ome time, and had then looked about them, my maid Amy came in, and brought with her a &s;mall brea&s;t of mutton, and two bunches of turnips, which &s;he intended to &s;tew for our dinner: as for me, my heart was &s;o over|whelmed at &s;eeing the&s;e two friends, for &s;uch they were, though poor, and at their &s;eeing me in &s;uch a condition, that I fell into another vi|olent fit of crying; &s;o that, in &s;hort, I could not &s;peak to them again for a great while longer.</P>
<P>During my being in &s;uch an agony, they went to my maid Amy at another part of the &s;ame
<PB N="17" REF="31">
room, and talked with her. Amy told them all my circum&s;tances, and &s;et them forth in &s;uch moving terms, that I could not, upon any ac|count have done it like her my&s;elf; and in a word, affected them both with it in &s;uch a man|ner, that the old aunt came to me, and though hardly able to &s;peak for tears: <Q>&startq;Look ye, Cou|&s;in,&endq;</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>&startq;things mu&s;t not &s;tand thus; &s;ome cour&s;e mu&s;t be taken, and that directly; pray where were the&s;e children born?&endq;</Q> I told her the pari&s;h where we lived before, that four of them were born there; and one in the hou&s;e where I now was, where the Landlord, after having fei&s;ed my goods for the rent pa&s;t, not then knowing that I had five children, had now given me leave to live for a whole year without any rent, being moved with compa&s;&s;ion; but that this year was now almo&s;t expired.</P>
<P>Upon hearing this account, they came to this re&s;olution: that the children &s;hould be all car|ried by them to the door of one of the relati|ons mentioned above, and be &s;et down there by Amy, and that I &s;hould remove for &s;ome days, &s;hut up the doors, and be gone; that the people &s;hould be told, that if they did not think fit to take &s;ome care of the children, they might &s;end for the churchwardens if they thought that better; for that they were born in that pa|ri&s;h, and there they mu&s;t be provided for. As for the other child, which was born in the pa|ri&s;h, that was already taken care of by the pa|ri&s;h officers; for, indeed, they were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;tre&s;s of the family, that they had, at fir&s;t word, done what was their part to do.</P>
<P>This was what the&s;e good women propo&s;ed, and bade me leave the re&s;t to them. I was at
<PB N="18" REF="32">
fir&s;t, &s;adly afflicted at the thoughts of parting with my children, and e&s;pecially at that horrid thing, their being taken into the pari&s;h-keep|ing; and then a hundred terrible things came into my thoughts; viz. of pari&s;h-children being &s;tarved at nur&s;e; of their being ruined, let grow crooked, lamed, and the like, for want of being taken care of; and this &s;unk my very heart within me.</P>
<P>But the mi&s;ery of my own circum&s;tances hard|ened my heart again&s;t my own fle&s;h and blood; and when I con&s;idered they mu&s;t inevitably be &s;tarved, and I too, if I continued to keep them about me, I began to be reconciled to parting with them all, any how, and any where, that I might be freed from the dreadful nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ee|ing them all peri&s;h, and peri&s;hing with them my|&s;elf: &s;o I agreed to go away out of the hou&s;e, and leave the management of the whole matter to Amy, and to them, and accordingly I did &s;o; and the &s;ame afternoon they carried them all away to one of their aunts.</P>
<P>Amy, a re&s;olute girl, knocked at the door, with the children all with her, and bade the elde&s;t, as &s;oon as the door was open, run in, and the re&s;t after her. She &s;et them all down at the door before &s;he knocked, and when &s;he knocked, &s;he &s;tayed till a maid-&s;ervant came to the door; <Q>'Sweetheart,' &s;aid &s;he, &startq;pray go in and tell your mi&s;tre&s;s, here are her little cou&s;ins come to &s;ee her:&endq; at which the maid offered to go back.</Q> 'Here, child,' &s;ays Amy, <Q>&startq;take one of them in&endq; your hand, and I will bring the re&s;t;&endq;</Q> &s;o &s;he gives her the lea&s;t, and the wench goes in mighty inno|cently, with the little one in her hand, upon which
<PB N="19" REF="33">
Amy turns the re&s;t in after her, &s;huts the door &s;oftly, and hurried away as fa&s;t as &s;he could.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t in the interval of this, and even while the maid and her mi&s;tre&s;s were quarrelling, for the mi&s;tre&s;s raved and &s;colded at her like a mad-woman, and had ordered her to go and &s;top Amy, and turn all the children out of the doors again; but &s;he had been at the door, and Amy was gone, and the wench was out of her wits, and the mi&s;tre&s;s too: I &s;ay, ju&s;t at this juncture came the poor old woman, Mrs. Barton, not the aunt, but the other of the two that had been with me, and knocks at the door. The aunt did not go, becau&s;e &s;he had been an advocate for me, and they would have &s;u&s;pected her of &s;ome contri|vance; but as for the other, they did not &s;o much as know that &s;he had kept up any corre&s;pondence with me.</P>
<P>Amy and &s;he had concerted this between them, and it was well enough contrived that they did &s;o. When &s;he came into the hou&s;e the mi&s;tre&s;s was fuming and raging like one di&s;tracted, and call|ing the maid all the fooli&s;h jades and &s;luts that &s;he could think of, and that &s;he would take the children and turn them all out into the &s;treets. The good poor woman &s;eeing her in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, turned about as if &s;he would be gone again; and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;Madam, I will come again another time, I &s;ee you are engaged.&endq;</Q>&mdash;<Q>&startq;No, no, Barton,&endq;</Q> &s;ays the Mi&s;tre&s;s, <Q>&startq;I am not much engaged, &s;it down: this &s;en&s;ele&s;s creature here, has brought in my fool of a brother's whole hou&s;e of chil|dren upon me, and tells me, that a wench brought them to the door, and thru&s;t them in, and bade her carry them to me; but it &s;hall be no di&s;turbance to me, for I have ordered them
<PB N="20" REF="34">
to be &s;et in the &s;treet, without the door, and &s;o let the churchwardens take care of them, or el&s;e make this dull jade carry them back again; and let her that brought them into the world, look after them if &s;he will; what does &s;he &s;end her brats to me for?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The la&s;t, indeed, had been the be&s;t of the two,' &s;ays Mrs. Barton, 'if it had been to be done; and that brings me to tell you my errand, and the occa&s;ion of my coming, for I came on purpo&s;e about this very bu&s;ine&s;s, and to have pre|vented this being put upon you, if I could; but I &s;ee I am come too late.&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;I knocked at the door, but no-body came, till at la&s;t &s;ome of the neighbours &s;ervants called to me, and &s;aid,'&mdash;"There is no-body lives there Mi&s;tre&s;s, what do you knock for?"&mdash;'I &s;eemed &s;urprized at that:'&mdash;"What no-body live there!"

Why truly, nothing wor&s;e," '&s;aid they,' can come to them than &s;taying here, for they were almo&s;t &s;tarved with hunger; &s;o the neighbours &s;eeing the poor Lady in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, for &s;he &s;tood crying, and wringing her hands over her children like one di&s;tracted, &s;ent for the churchwardens to take care of the children; and they, when they came, took the younge&s;t, which was born in the pari&s;h, and have got it a very good nur&s;e, and taken care of it; but as for the other four, they had &s;ent them away to &s;ome of their father's relations, and who were very &s;ub&s;tantial people, and who be&s;ides&endq; that, lived in the pari&s;h where they were born.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I was not &s;o &s;urprized at this, as not pre&s;ently to fore&s;ee that this trouble would be brought upon you, Mrs. Cro&s;s, &s;o I came immediately to bring you word of it, that you might be pre|pared for it, and might not be &s;urprized: but I &s;ee they have been too nimble for me, &s;o that I know not what to advi&s;e: the poor woman, it &s;eems, is turned out of doors into the &s;treet; and another of the neighbour's there told me, that when they took her children from her, &s;he &s;wooned away, and when they recovered her out of that, &s;he run di&s;tracted, and is put into a mad-hou&s;e by the pari&s;h; for there is no-body el&s;e to take any care of her.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This was all &s;aid by this good, kind, poor creature; for though her de&s;ign was perfectly good and charitable, yet there was not one word of it true in fact; for I was not turned out
<PB N="22" REF="36">
of doors by the landlord, nor gone di&s;tracted: it was true, indeed, that at parting with my poor children, I fainted, and was like one mad when I came to my&s;elf and found they were gone; but I remained in the hou&s;e a good while after that; as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>While the poor woman was telling this di&s;mal &s;tory, in came Mr. Cro&s;s, the hu&s;band, and though her heart was hardened again&s;t all pity, who was really and nearly related to the children, for they were the children of her own brother; yet the good man was quite &s;oftened with the di&s;|mal relation of the circum&s;tances of the family; and when the poor woman had fini&s;hed, he &s;aid to his wife, <Q>&startq;This is a di&s;mal ca&s;e, my dear, in|deed,' and &s;omething mu&s;t be done</Q> His wife fell a raving at him, 'What,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>&startq;do you want to have four children to keep? Have we not children of our own? would you have the&s;e brats come and eat up my children's bread? no, no, let them go to the pari&s;h, and let that take care of them, I will take care of my own.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Come, come, my dear,' &s;ays the hu&s;band, charity is a duty to the poor, and he that gives to the poor lends to the Lord; let us lend our Heavenly Father a little of our childrens bread, as you call it, it will be the be&s;t &s;ecurity that our children &s;hall never come to want charity, or be turned out of doors, as the&s;e poor innocent creatures are.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Don't tell me of &s;ecurity,' &s;ays the wife; it is a good &s;ecurity for our children to keep what we have together, and provide for them: it is time enough to help to keep other folks children; charity begins at home.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="23" REF="37">
&startq;Well, well, my dear,' &s;ays he again, 'I only talk of putting out a little money to intere&s;t; our Maker is a good borrower, never fear making a bad debt there child; I will be be bound for it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Don't banter me with your charity, and your allegories,' &s;ays the wife angrily;' I tell you they are my relations, not yours, and they &s;hall not rooft here, they &s;hall go to the pari&s;h.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;All your relations are my relations now,' &s;ays the good Gentleman very calmly, 'and I will not &s;ee your relations in di&s;tre&s;s and not pity them, any more than I would my own; indeed, my dear, they &s;hall not go to the pari&s;h. I a&s;&s;ure you none of my wife's relations &s;hall come to the pari&s;h, if I can help it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;What, will you take four children to keep?&endq; &s;ays the wife.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;No, no, my dear,' &s;ays he; 'there is your &s;i&s;ter, I will go and talk with her, and your uncle, I will &s;end for him and the re&s;t; I'll warrant you when we are all together we will find ways and means to keep four poor little children from beggary and &s;tarving, or el&s;e it will be very hard; we are none of us in &s;o bad circum&s;tances but we are able to &s;pare a mite for the fatherle&s;s; don't &s;hut up your bowels of compa&s;&s;ion again&s;t your own fle&s;h and blood: could you hear the&s;e innocent children cry at your door for hunger, and give them no bread?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Prythee what need they cry at our door,' &s;ays &s;he; 'it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pari&s;h to provide for them: they &s;hall not cry at our door, if they do,' I will give them nothing. 'Won't you,' &s;ays he, 'but I will; remember that dreadful &s;cripture is directly again&s;t us, Prov. xxi. 13. Who&s;o

<P>Then the poor woman put in, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;But, Madam, that is &s;ending them to &s;tarve in|deed; for the pari&s;h has no obligation to take care of them, and &s;o they would lie and pe|ri&s;h&endq; in the &s;treet.</Q></P>

Upon this he &s;ends and gathers all the rela|tions together at a tavern hard-by, and &s;ent for the four little children, that they might &s;ee them; and they all, at fir&s;t word, agreed to have them taken care of; and becau&s;e his wife was &s;o fu|rious that &s;he would not &s;uffer one of them to be kept at home, they agreed to keep them all together for a while; &s;o they committed them to the poor woman that had managed the af|fair for them, and entered into obligations to one another to &s;upply the needful &s;ums for their maintenance; and not to have one &s;eparated from the re&s;t, they &s;ent for the younge&s;t from the pari&s;h where it was taken in, and had them all brought up together.</P>
<P>It would take up too long a part of this &s;tory to give a particular account with what a chari|table tenderne&s;s this good per&s;on, who was but uncle-in-law to them, managed that affair; how careful he was of them; went con&s;tantly to &s;ee them, and to &s;ee that they were well provided for, cloathed, put to School, and at la&s;t put out in the world for their advantage; but it is enough to &s;ay he acted more like a father to them, than an uncle-in-law, though all along much again&s;t his wife's con&s;ent, who was of a di&s;po&s;ition not &s;o tender and compa&s;&s;ionate as her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>You may believe I heard this with the &s;ame plea&s;ure which I now feel at the relating it again; for I was terribly frighted at the apprehen&s;ions of my children being brought to mi&s;ery and di&s;|tre&s;s, as tho&s;e mu&s;t be who have no friends, but are left to pari&s;h benevolence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>An incident far from being unnatural.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Was now, however, entring on a new &s;cene of life; I had a great hou&s;e upon my hands, and &s;ome furniture left in it, but I was no more able to maintain my&s;elf and Amy in it, than I was my five children; nor had I any thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t with, but what I might get by working, and that was not a town where much work was to be had.</P>
<P>My landlord had been very kind indeed, af|ter he came to know my circum&s;tances, and that I was left with five children; though before he was acquainted with that part, he had gone &s;o far as to &s;eize my goods, and to carry &s;ome of them off too.</P>
<P>And here it will not be improper to look back a little, to relate the fact that brought about this unexpected, and important, affair.</P>
<P>One morning, as i was &s;urrounded by my chil|dren in the parlour, in the greate&s;t affliction, and in tears, having before &s;ent out Amy with a &s;mall &s;ilver &s;poon to procure us a meal; I di&s;|covered a man, of a genteel appearance, enter the room, and immediately I recollected him to be my landlord.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Do not be &s;urpri&s;ed, Mrs. Bacon,' &s;aid he, I am not come to a&s;k you for any rent; but, pray, tell me, what is the matter with you,&endq; that you &s;eem thus afflicted?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Dear Sir, I &s;hould have imagined you to be the la&s;t per&s;on in the world to a&s;k me the que&s;tion; for, give me leave to &s;ay, it is chiefly
<PB N="27" REF="41">
owing to your &s;everity, that I am, at pre&s;ent,&endq; under this affliction.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Owing to me! Mrs. Bacon; pray in what&endq; manner?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Oh! Sir, your &s;teward or agent, in your name, long ago, &s;eized my goods for the rent, which has occa&s;ioned my being in the condi|tion&endq; you at pre&s;ent behold me.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I a&s;&s;ure you Mrs. Bacon, upon my honour, I am a &s;tranger to what you have mentioned; 'tis true my general orders are to let none of my tenants run above a year, or a year and a half at mo&s;t; but as to your particu|lar ca&s;e I was intirely ignorant; and now I am acquainted with it, it indeed di&s;turbs me&endq; much.</Q></P>
<P>After a long conver&s;ation of enquiries on his part, with the an&s;wers on mine, he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and coming to me, he put two gui|neas into my hand, gave me a ki&s;s, &s;aid he would &s;ee me again, and was preparing to leave me.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Oh! Sir, your kindne&s;s overcomes me; may you, for this &s;ingle action, meet with every ble&s;&s;ing you can wi&s;h in this life, and&endq; everla&s;ting happine&s;s in the life to come.</Q></P>
<P>As I was attending him to the door, Amy returned with &s;omething in her hand for dinner: he took no notice of her, but bowed to me, and went away.</P>
<P>When I came in, I told Amy the whole of his di&s;cour&s;e, and what he had given me. She in&s;tantly fell on her knees, with thanks to hea|ven for the donor, it being a great relief to us; for we had drank nothing but water for many weeks before.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="42">
The next day he &s;ent me my goods again, and in about a week after he came him&s;elf. Upon my making acknowledgments for his re|turning my things, he &s;topt me, and ki&s;&s;ed me twice, or thrice; which had &s;uch an effect upon my &s;pirits, that I felt the warmth and glow of it upon my cheeks, for &s;everal minutes after.</P>
<P>At length he took a chair and &s;at down by me; but, as our conver&s;ation, while he &s;tayed, is of little importance to my readers, I &s;hall, for that rea&s;on, omit it, and acquaint them only, that he left me, as he did before, in better circum&s;tances than he &s;ound me.</P>
<P>Mr. Dazzle, for that was my Landlord's name, had not only &s;everal e&s;tates, but was a dealer in jewels. I had now lived three quarters of a year in his hou&s;e after the &s;eizure of my goods, and had paid him no rent, and, which was wor&s;e, if he had de&s;ired it, I was in no condition to pay him any. However, I ob&s;erved, now, he came oftener to &s;ee me; his looks were the looks of affection, and his words were the words of friend&s;hip; particularly the la&s;t two or three times which he came, and the la&s;t time of all he was kinder &s;till, for he told me he came to dine with me, and that I &s;hould give him leave to treat me, and a&s;ked me where my children were: upon which I informed him, as the reader has been already acquainted. He then called Amy, and &s;ent her out to buy a joint of meat: he told her what &s;he &s;hould buy, but naming two or three things, either of which &s;he might take. The maid, a cunning wench, and faithful to me, as the &s;kin to my back, did not buy any thing out-right, but brought the butcher along with her, with both the things that &s;he had cho&s;en,
<PB N="29" REF="43">
for him to plea&s;e him&s;elf; the one was a loin of veal; the other a piece of roa&s;ting beef. He looked at them, and paid the butcher what they came to, and bade me take them both; the beef, he &s;aid, would &s;erve another time.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed, you may be &s;ure, at the bounty of a man that had before been my terror, and had taken the goods out of my hou&s;e; but I con&s;idered that my di&s;tre&s;&s;es had mollified his temper, and that he had afterwards been &s;o com|pa&s;&s;ionate as to give me leave to live rent-free in the hou&s;e a whole year.</P>
<P>But now he put on the face, not of a man of compa&s;&s;ion only, but of a man of friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s, and this was &s;o unexpected, that it &s;urpri&s;ed me: we di&s;cour&s;ed together, and were, as I may call it, chearful, which was more than I could &s;ay I had been for three years before.</P>
<P>Here he de&s;ired me to give him leave to &s;end for &s;ome wine; and when Amy was come with it, he bid her fill a gla&s;s to him, and with the gla&s;s in his hand, he came to me, and ki&s;&s;ed me, which I was not now &s;urpri&s;ed at, but I was at what followed; for he told me, That as the &s;ad condition which I was reduced to, had made him pity me, &s;o my conduct in it, and the courage I bore it with, had given him a more than ordinary re&s;pect for me, and made him very thoughtful for my good; that he was re&s;olved for the pre&s;ent to do &s;omething to relieve me, and to employ his thoughts in the mean time, to &s;ee if he could, for the future, put me into a way to &s;upport my&s;elf.</P>
<P>While he found me change colour, and look &s;urpri&s;ed at his di&s;cour&s;e, for &s;o I did to be &s;ure,
<PB N="30" REF="44" MS="Y">
he turns to Amy, and looking at her, he &s;ays to me; <Q>&startq;I &s;ay all this Mrs. Bacon before your maid, becau&s;e both &s;he and you &s;hall know that I have no ill de&s;ign, and that I have, in mere kindne&s;s, re&s;olved to do &s;omething for you, if I can; and as I have been a witne&s;s of the un|common hone&s;ty and fidelity of Amy here, to you in all your di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I know &s;he may be tru&s;ted with &s;o hone&s;t a de&s;ign as mine is; for I a&s;&s;ure you I bear a proportioned regard to your maid too, for her affection to you.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Amy made him a curt&s;ey, and the poor girl looked &s;o confounded with joy, that &s;he could not &s;peak; but her colour came-and went, and every now and then &s;he blu&s;hed, as red as &s;carlet, and the next minute looked as pale as death. Well, having &s;aid this, he &s;at down, made me &s;it down, and then drank to me, and made me drink two gla&s;&s;es of wine together; 'For,' &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;you have need of it:&endq; and &s;o indeed I had.</Q> When he had done &s;o, 'Come, Amy,' &s;ays he, with &startq;your mi&s;tre&s;s's leave, you &s;hall have a gla&s;s too:&endq; &s;o he made her drink two gla&s;&s;es al&s;o, and then ri&s;ing up; 'And now, Amy,' &s;ays he, 'go and 'get dinner,' and in the mean time, he &s;aid, he would walk in the garden.</P>
<P>When he was gone, Amy looked as plea&s;ed as ever &s;he did in her life. 'Dear Madam!' &s;ays &s;he, what does this Gentleman mean?'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Nay, Amy,' &s;ays I, 'he means to do us good, you &s;ee, don't he? I know no other meaning he can have, for he can get nothing by me.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I warrant you, Madam,' &s;ays &s;he, 'he'll a&s;k you a favour bye-and-by.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;No, no, you are mi&s;taken, Amy, I dare &s;ay,&endq;</Q> &s;aid I; 'you heard what he &s;aid, did not you?'</P>
<P><Q><PB N="31" REF="45">
&startq;Ay,' &s;ays Amy, it is no matter for that, you &s;hall &s;ee what he will do after dinner.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, well, Amy,' &s;ays I, 'you have hard thoughts of him, I cannot be of your opinion; I don't &s;ee any thing in him yet that looks like it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As to that, Madam,' &s;ays Amy, 'I don't &s;ee any thing of it yet neither; but what &s;hould move a Gentleman to take pity of you as he does?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Nay,' &s;ays I, 'that is a hard thing too, that we &s;hould judge a man to be wicked becau&s;e he is charitable; and vicious becau&s;e he is kind.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;O Madam,' &s;ays Amy, 'there is abundance of charity begins in that vice, and he is not &s;o unac|quainted with things, as not to know, that poverty is the &s;tronge&s;t incentive; a temptation, again&s;t which no virtue is powerful enough to &s;tand out; he knows your condition as well as you do.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, and what then, Amy?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, then he knows too you are young and hand&s;ome, and he has the &s;ure&s;t bait in the world, to take you with.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, Amy,' &s;aid I, 'but he may find him|&s;elf mi&s;taken, in &s;uch a thing as that.&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;I hope not, Madam, I hope you would be wi&s;er; I am &s;ure if he will &s;et you up, as he talks of, you ought to deny him nothing; and you will &s;tarve if you do not con&s;ent, that is certain.&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;Nay, Madam,' &s;ays Amy, 'I don't think you would for any thing el&s;e; it would not be lawful for any thing el&s;e, but for bread, Madam;

why nobody can &s;tarve, there is no bearing that, I am &s;ure.&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;Why look you, Madam, if he would but give you enough to live ea&s;y upon, he &s;hould lye with me for it with all my heart.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;That is a token, Amy, of inimitable kindne&s;s to me,' &s;aid I, 'and I know how to value it; but there is more friend&s;hip than hone&s;ty in it, Amy.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;O Madam,' &s;ays Amy, 'I would do any any thing to get you out of this &s;ad condition; as to hone&s;ty, I think hone&s;ty is out of the que&s;|tion, when &s;tarving is the ca&s;e; are not we al|mo&s;t&endq; &s;tarved to death?</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;Why that is an exce&s;s of affection, Amy,'</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>&startq;I never met with before; I wi&s;h I may be ever in a condition to make you &s;ome re|turns &s;uitable: but, however, Amy, you &s;hall not be &s;uch to him, to oblige him to be kind to me: no, Amy, nor I won't be a pro&s;titute to him if he would give me much more than he is able to give me, or do for me.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, Madam,' &s;ays Amy, 'I don't &s;ay I will go and a&s;k him; but I &s;ay, if he &s;hould promi&s;e to do &s;o and &s;o for you, and the condi|tion was &s;uch, that he would not &s;erve you un|le&s;s

I would let him lie with me, he &s;hould lie with me as often as he would, rather than you &s;hould not have his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but this is but talk, Madam, I don't &s;ee any need of &s;uch di&s;|cour&s;e, and you are of opinion that there will be&endq; no need of it too.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Indeed, &s;o I am, Amy; but,' &s;aid I, 'if there was, I tell you again, I would rather die before I would con&s;ent; or before you &s;hould con&s;ent for my &s;ake.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Hitherto I had not only pre&s;erved the virtue it|&s;elf, but the virtuous inclination and re&s;olution; and had I kept my&s;elf there, I had been happy, though I had peri&s;hed of meer hunger; for, with|out que&s;tion, a woman ought rather to die, than to pro&s;titute her virtue and honour, let the tempta|tion be what he will.</P>
<P>But to return to my &s;tory: he walked about the garden; which was, indeed, all in di&s;order, and over-run with weeds, becau&s;e I had not been able to hire a gardener to do any thing to it, no not &s;o much as to dig up ground enough to &s;ow a few turnips and carrots for family u&s;e. After he had viewed it, he came in, and &s;ent Amy to fetch a poor man, a gardener, that u&s;ed to help our man-&s;ervant, and carried him into the garden, and told him to do &s;everal things in it, to put it into a little order; and this took him up near an hour.</P>
<P>By this time, I had dre&s;&s;ed me, as well as I could; for though my things were indifferent, I was tight and clean, and in better plight than he had &s;een me in a great while, and he looked ex|tremely plea&s;ed to &s;ee me &s;o; for he &s;aid, I looked &s;o di&s;con&s;olate, and &s;o afflicted before, that it
<PB N="34" REF="48">
grieved him to &s;ee me; and he bade me pluck up a good heart, for he hoped to put me in a condi|tion to live in the world, and be beholden to no|body.</P>
<P>I told him that was impo&s;&s;ible, for I mu&s;t be beholden to him for it, for all the friends I had in the world would not, or could nor, do &s;o much for me as that he &s;poke of. 'Well, Widow,' &s;ays he; (for &s;o he called me, and &s;o indeed I was in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e that de&s;olate word could be u&s;ed in) 'if you are beholden to me, you &s;hall 'be beholden to nobody el&s;e.'</P>
<P>By this time dinner was near ready, and Amy came in to lay the cloth, with an apology for the want of nece&s;&s;aries to entertain him. However, he knew how things were, and bade me make no &s;cruple about bringing out what I had; he hoped to &s;ee me in a better plight; he did not come, he &s;aid, to be entertained, but to entertain me, and comfort and encourage me: thus he went on, &s;peaking &s;o chearfully to me, and &s;uch chearful things, that it was a cordial to my very &s;oul, to hear him &s;peak.</P>
<P>Here we went to dinner, and I am &s;ure I had not eat &s;o good a meal hardly in a twelvemonth, at lea&s;t, not of &s;uch a joint of meat as the loin of veal was. I eat indeed very heartily, and &s;o did he, and he made me drink three or four gla&s;&s;es of wine, &s;o that, in &s;hort, my &s;pirits were lifted up to a degree I had not been u&s;ed to, and I was not only chearful, but merry, and &s;o he pre&s;&s;ed me to be.</P>
<P>I told him, I had a great deal of rea&s;on to be merry, &s;eeing he had been &s;o kind to me, and had given me hopes of recovering me from the wor&s;t circum&s;tances that ever woman of any &s;ort of
<PB N="35" REF="49">
fortune was &s;unk into; that he could not but believe that what he had &s;aid to me, was like life from the dead; that it was like recovering one &s;ick from the brink of the grave. How I &s;hould ever make him a return any way &s;uitable, was what I had not yet had time to think of; I could only &s;ay, that I &s;hould never forget it while I had life, and &s;hould be always ready to acknowledge it.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, that was all he de&s;ired of me; that his reward would be, the &s;atisfaction of having re&s;cued me from mi&s;ery; that he found he was obliging one that knew what gratitude meant; that he would make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to make me com|pleatly ea&s;y, fir&s;t or la&s;t, if it lay in his power; and in the mean time, he bade me con&s;ider of any thing that I thought he might do for me, for my advantage, and in order to make me per|fectly ea&s;y.</P>
<P>After we had talked thus, he bade me be chear|ful: 'Come,' &s;ays he, 'lay a&s;ide the&s;e melan|'choly things, and let us be merry.' Amy waited at the table; and &s;he &s;miled, and laughed, and was &s;o joyous &s;he could hardly contain it, for the girl loved me to &s;uch exce&s;s, hardly to be de&s;cribed; and it was &s;uch an unexpected thing to hear any one talk to her mi&s;tre&s;s, that the wench was be&s;ide her&s;elf almo&s;t; and after dinner was over, Amy went up-&s;tairs, and dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf too in the be&s;t &s;he had.</P>
<P>We &s;at together talking of a thou&s;and things, of what had been, and what was to be, all the re&s;t of the day; and in the evening he took his leave of me, with many expre&s;&s;ions of kind|ne&s;s and tenderne&s;s, and true affection to me, but offered not the lea&s;t of what Amy had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="50">
At his going away, he took me in his arms; prote&s;ted an hone&s;t kindne&s;s to me; &s;aid &s;everal kind things, which I cannot now recollect, and after ki&s;&s;ing me, put a guinea into my hand; which, he &s;aid, was for my pre&s;ent &s;upply, and told me, that he would &s;ee me again, before it was out; al&s;o he gave Amy half-a-crown.</P>
<P>When he was gone; <Q>&startq;Well, Amy,' &s;aid I, are you convinced now he is an hone&s;t as well as a true friend, and that there has been nothing, not the lea&s;t appearance of any thing of what&endq; you imagined, in his behaviour.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Yes,' &s;ays Amy, 'I am; but I admire at it; he is &s;uch a friend as the world, &s;ure, has not abundance of to &s;how.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I am &s;ure,' &s;ays I, 'he is &s;uch a friend as I have long wanted, and as I have as much need&endq; of as any creature in the world has, or ever had.'</Q> And, in &s;hort, I was &s;o overcome with the com|fort of it, that I &s;at down and cried for joy a good while, as I had formerly cried for &s;orrow.</P>
<P>We heard no more of him for two days, but the third day he came again; then he told me, with the &s;ame kindne&s;s, that he had ordered me a &s;upply of hou&s;hold goods for the furni&s;hing the hou&s;e. <Q>&startq;And now,' &s;ays he, 'I will tell you what I have in my head for you, for your pre|&s;ent &s;upply; and that is, that the hou&s;e, being well furni&s;hed, you &s;hall let out in lodgings, by which you will get a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, e&s;|pecially &s;eeing you &s;hall pay me no rent for two years, nor after neither, unle&s;s you can afford it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t view I had of living comfort|ably indeed, and it was a very probable way, I mu&s;t confe&s;s: &s;eeing we had very good conveni|encies, &s;ix rooms on a floor, and three &s;tories
<PB N="37" REF="51">
high. While he was laying down a &s;cheme of my management, came a cart to the door with a load of goods, and an uphol&s;terer's man to put them up; with two fine cabinets, and &s;ome pier|gla&s;&s;es, and &s;everal other valuable things.</P>
<P>He told me, he gave them me freely, as a &s;a|tisfaction for the cruelty he had u&s;ed me with before; and the furniture of one room being fini&s;hed, and &s;et up, he told me, he would fur|ni&s;h one chamber for him&s;elf, and would come and be one of my lodgers, if I would give him leave.</P>
<P>I told him, he ought not to a&s;k me leave, who had &s;o much right to make him&s;elf welcome. So the hou&s;e began to look in &s;ome tolerable figure, and clean; the garden al&s;o, in about a fortnight's work, began to look &s;omething le&s;s like a wilder|ne&s;s than it u&s;ed to do; and he ordered me to put up a bill for letting rooms, re&s;erving one for him|&s;elf, to come as he &s;aw ooca&s;ion.</P>
<P>When all was done to his mind, as to placing the goods, he &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed, and we dined together again of his own providing. After dinner he took me by the hand; <Q>&startq;Come now, Mrs. Bacon,' &s;ays he, 'you mu&s;t &s;how me&endq; your hou&s;e:'</Q> for he had a mind to &s;ee every thing over again.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;No, Sir,' &s;ays I, 'but I will go &s;how you your hou&s;e, if you plea&s;e.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>So we went up through all the rooms, and in the room which was appointed for him&s;elf, Amy was doing &s;omething.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, Amy,' &s;ays he, 'I intend to lie with you to-morrow night.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;To-night, if you plea&s;e, Sir,' &s;ays Amy very innocently; 'your room is quite ready.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, Amy,' &s;ays he, 'I am glad you are &s;o willing.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="38" REF="52">
&startq;No,' &s;ays Amy, 'I mean your chamber is ready&endq; to-night.'</Q> And away &s;he run out of the room a&s;hamed enough; for the girl meant no harm, whatever &s;he had &s;aid to me in private.</P>
<P>However, he &s;aid no more then; but when Amy was gone, he walked about the room, and looked at every thing, and taking me by the hand; he ki&s;&s;ed me, and &s;poke a great many kind, affec|tionate things to me indeed; as of his mea&s;ures for my advantage, and what he would do to rai&s;e me again in the world; told me, that my afflic|tions, and the conduct I had &s;hewn in bearing them to &s;uch an extremity, had &s;o engaged him to me, that he valued me infinitely above all the women in the world; that though he was under &s;uch engagements that he could not marry me, [his wife and he had been parted, for &s;ome rea|&s;ons, which make too long a &s;tory to intermix with mine] yet that he would do every thing el&s;e that a woman could a&s;k in a hu&s;band, and with that he ki&s;&s;ed me again, and took me in his arms, but offered not the lea&s;t uncivil action to me, and told me, he hoped I would not deny him all the favours he &s;hould a&s;k, becau&s;e he re&s;olved to a&s;k nothing of me but what it was fit for a woman of vertue and mode&s;ty, for &s;uch he knew me to be, to grant.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the terrible pre&s;&s;ure of my former mi|&s;ery, the memory of which lay heavy upon my min, and the &s;urprizing kindne&s;s with which he had delivered me, and withal, the expecta|tion of what he might &s;till do for me, were pow|erful things, and made me have &s;carce the power to deny him any thing he would a&s;k. However, I told him thus, with an air of tenderne&s;s too;
<PB N="39" REF="53">
that he had done &s;o much for me, that I thought I ought to deny him nothing: only I hoped, and depended upon him, that he would not take the advantage of the infinite obligations I was under to him, to de&s;ire any thing of me, the yielding to which would lay me lower in his e&s;teem than I de&s;ired to be; that as I took him to be a man of honour, &s;o I knew he could not like me the better for doing any thing that was below a woman of honour and hone&s;ty to do.</P>
<P>He told me, that he had done all this for me, without &s;o much as telling me what kindne&s;s or real affection he had for me; that I might not be under any nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to him in any thing, for want of bread; and he would no more oppre&s;s my gratitude now, than he would my nece&s;&s;ity before, nor a&s;k any thing, &s;uppo&s;ing he would &s;top his favours, or withdraw his kind|ne&s;s, if he was denied. It was true, he &s;aid, he might tell me more freely his mind now, than before, &s;eeing I had let him know that I accepted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;aw that he was &s;incere in his de&s;ign of &s;erving me; that he had gone thus far to &s;hew me that he was only kind to me; but that now he would tell me, that he loved me, and yet would demon&s;trate that his love was both ho|nourable, and that what he &s;hould de&s;ire, was what he might hone&s;tly a&s;k, and I might hone&s;t|ly grant.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that within tho&s;e two limitations, I was &s;ure I ought to deny him nothing, and I &s;hould think my&s;elf not ungrateful only, but very unju&s;t, if I &s;hould: &s;o he &s;aid no more, but I ob|&s;erved he ki&s;&s;ed me more, and took me in his arms in a more familiar way, more than u&s;ual,
<PB N="40" REF="54">
and which put me in mind of my maid Amy's words; and yet, I mu&s;t acknowledge, I was &s;o overcome with his goodne&s;s to me in the&s;e many kind things he had done, that I not only was ea&s;y at his ki&s;&s;ing me, and made no re&s;&s;i&s;tance, but was inclined to do the like my&s;elf, though I did not. But he went no farther than what I have &s;aid, nor did he offer &s;o much as to &s;it-down on the bed-&s;ide with me, but took his leave, &s;aid he loved me tenderly, and would convince me of it by &s;uch demon&s;trations as &s;hould be to my &s;atisfaction. I told him, I had a great deal of rea&s;on to believe him; that he was full ma&s;|ter of the whole hou&s;e, and of me, as far as was within the bounds we had &s;poken of, which I believed he would not break; and a&s;ked him if he would not plea&s;e to lodge there that night.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he could not well &s;tay that night, bu|&s;ine&s;s requiring him in London; but added, &s;miling, that he would come the next day, and take a night's lodging with me. I pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;tay that night, and told him, I &s;hould be glad a friend &s;o valuable &s;hould be under the &s;ame roof with me; and, indeed, I began at that time not only to be much obliged to him, but to love him too, and that in a manner that I had not been ac|quainted with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Oh! let not any of my &s;ex ca&s;t a reflection on a woman left de&s;titute, with five children, but con&s;ider her generou&s;ly delivered from trouble; and that &s;he, in return, was furni&s;hed with prin|ciples of gratitude, to an amiable man.</P>
<P>This Gentleman had freely and voluntarily de|livered me from mi&s;ery, from poverty, and di&s;tre&s;s; he had made me what I was, and put me into a way to be even more than I ever was, namely, to

live happy and plea&s;ed, and on his bounty I de|pended: what could I &s;ay to this worthy man when he pre&s;&s;ed me to yield to him, and argued the lawfulne&s;s of it? But of that in its place.</P>
<P>I pre&s;&s;ed him again to &s;tay that night, and told him it was the fir&s;t compleatly happy night that I had ever had in the hou&s;e in my life, and I &s;hould be very &s;orry to have it be without his company, who was the cau&s;e and foundation of it all; that we would be innocently merry, but that it never could be without him; and, in &s;hort, I courted him &s;o, that he &s;aid he could not deny me, but he would take his hor&s;e, and go to Lon|don, do the bu&s;ine&s;s he had to do, and that he would come back in three hours at farthe&s;t, and &s;up with me, but bade me get nothing there, for &s;ince I was re&s;olved to be merry, which was what he de&s;ired above all things, he would &s;end me &s;omething from London. 'And we will make a wedding-&s;upper of it, my dear,' &s;ays he; and with that word, took me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ed me &s;o vehemently, that I made no que&s;tion but he intended to do every thing el&s;e that Amy had talked of.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted a little at the word Wedding. <Q>&startq;What do you mean, Sir, to call it by &s;uch a name!</Q> &s;ays I; adding, <Q>&startq;We will have a &s;upper, but the other is impo&s;&s;ible, as well on your &s;ide as mine. He laughed: 'Well,' &s;ays he, 'you &s;hall call it what you will, but it may be the &s;ame thing, for I &s;hall &s;atisfy you, it is not &s;o&endq; impo&s;&s;ible as you make it.&endq;</Q></P>

&startq;Well, well,' &s;ays he, 'we will talk of that&endq; after &s;upper:</Q> &s;o he ro&s;e up, gave me another ki&s;s, and took his hor&s;e for London.</P>
<P>This kind of di&s;cour&s;e had fired my blood, I confe&s;s, and I knew not what to think of it. It was plain now that he intended to lie with me, if I would let him; but how he could reconcile it to a legal thing, like a marriage, that I could not imagine. We had both of us u&s;ed Amy with &s;o much intimacy, and tru&s;ted her with every thing, having &s;uch unexampled in&s;tances of her fidelity, that he made no &s;cruple to ki&s;s me, and &s;ay all the&s;e things to me before her; &s;o that when he was gone: 'Well, Amy,' &s;ays I, <Q>&startq;what will all this come to now?

<P><Q>&startq;Come to, Madam, &s;ays Amy, 'I &s;ee what it will come to plain enough, I mu&s;t put you to bed to-night together; for has he not told you his wife has left him, &s;o that her office is be|come vacant, and I can &s;ee he is &s;o &s;truck with your beauty, that he &s;olicits you to &s;upply and fill this vacancy; by which means, both you and your children, will be in a plentiful manner provided for; therefore, I &s;ay, I mu&s;t put you to bed to-night together.&endq;</Q></P>

&s;uch, indeed, you are; for as my ma&s;ter has left you &s;o many years, he is dead to be &s;ure; at lea&s;t, he is dead to you.

could come together, upon any other terms than that of adultery: the ignorant jade's argument, That he had brought me out of the hands of the devil, by which &s;he meant the devil of po|verty and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hould have been a powerful motive to me, not to plunge my&s;elf into the jaws of hell, and into the power of the real de|vil, in recompence for that deliverance; I &s;hould have looked upon all the good this man had done for me, to have been the particular work of the goodne&s;s of heaven; and that good|ne&s;s &s;hould have moved me to return of duty and humble obedience; I &s;hould have received the mercy thankfully, and applied it &s;oberly to the prai&s;e and honour of my Maker; whereas by this wicked cour&s;e, all the bounty and kindne&s;s of this Gentleman became a &s;nare to me, was a meer bait to the devil's hook; I received his kindne&s;s at the dear expence of body and &s;oul, mortgaging faith, religion, con&s;cience, and mo|de&s;ty, for, as I may call it, a mor&s;el of bread; or, if you will, ruined my &s;oul from a princi|ple of gratitude, and gave my&s;elf up to the devil, to &s;hew my&s;elf grateful to my benefactor: I mu&s;t do the Gentleman that ju&s;tice, as to &s;ay, I verily believe that he de&s;igned nothing but what was lawful; and I mu&s;t do that ju&s;tice upon my&s;elf, as to &s;ay, that if I con&s;ented, I &s;hould do, what my own con&s;cience convinced me at the very time I did it, was horribly un|lawful, &s;candalous, and abominable.</P>

<P>'I do not know how you &s;hould, Madam,' &s;ays Amy.</P>
<P>Thus Amy and I canva&s;&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s be|tween us; the jade prompted the crime, which, I am afraid, I had but too much inclination to commit; that is to &s;ay, not as a crime, for I had nothing of the vice in my con&s;titution; but the kindne&s;s and good-humour of the man, and the dread of my own circum&s;tances con|curred to bring me to that which no woman, who has the lea&s;t preten&s;ion to virtue, &s;hould ever think of parting from.</P>
<P>About two hours after he was gone, came a porter on hor&s;eback, with a ba&s;ket, with an order to get &s;upper ready by nine o'clock, which I prepared accordingly; and he gave me time enough, for he came before &s;even, &s;o that Amy got every thing ready in time.</P>
<P>We &s;at down to &s;upper about nine, and were indeed very merry. Amy made us &s;ome &s;port, for &s;he was a girl of &s;pirit and wit; and with her talk &s;he made us laugh very often, and yet the jade managed her wit with all the good-manners imaginable.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, he took me up into his chamber, where Amy had made a good fire, and there he
<PB N="49" REF="63">
pulled out a great many papers, and &s;pread them upon a little table, and then took me by the hand, and after ki&s;&s;ing me, he entered into a di&s;cour&s;e of his circum&s;tances, and of mine, how they agreed in &s;everal things exactly; for ex|ample, that I was abandoned of a hu&s;band in the prime of my youth and vigour, and he of a wife in his middle-age; how the end of mar|riage was de&s;troyed by the treatment we had ei|ther of us received; and it would be very hard that we &s;hould be tied by the formality of the contract, where the e&s;&s;ence of it was de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>I interrupted him, and told him, There was a va&s;t difference between our circum&s;tances, and that in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part; namely, that he was rich, and I was poor; that he was above the world, and I infinitely below it; that his circum&s;tances were very ea&s;y, mine mi&s;erable, and this was an inequality the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential that could be imagined.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;As to that, my Dear,' &s;ays he, 'I have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hall make an equa|lity&endq; &s;till;'</Q> and with that, he &s;hewed me a con|tract in writing, wherein he engaged him&s;elf to me; to cohabit con&s;tantly with me; to provide for me in all re&s;pects as a wife, and to keep and provide for my children; and repeating, in the preamble, a long account of the nature and rea&s;on of our living together, and an obligation in the penalty of &s;even thou&s;and pounds never to abandon me; and at la&s;t, &s;hewed me a bond for five hundred pounds, to be paid to me, or to my a&s;&s;igns, within three months after his de|cea&s;e, with one hundred pounds, al&s;o, for each of my children.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="64">
He read over all the&s;e things to me, and then in a mo&s;t moving, affectionate manner, and in words not to be an&s;wered, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;Now, my dear, is this not &s;ufficient? Can you object any thing again&s;t it? if not, as I believe you will not, then let us debate this&endq; matter no longer;</Q> with that he pulled out a pur&s;e which had three&s;core guineas in it, and threw them into my lap, and concluded all the re&s;t of his di&s;cour&s;e with ki&s;&s;es, and prote&s;tations of his love; of which, indeed, I had abundant proof.</P>
<P>Pity human frailty, you that read of a woman reduced in her youth and prime to the utmo&s;t mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s; and rai&s;ed again, as above, by the unexpected and &s;urpri&s;ing bounty of a &s;tranger; I &s;ay pity her, if &s;he was not able, after all the&s;e things, to make any more re|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>However, I &s;tood out &s;till. I a&s;ked him, how he could expect that I could come into a propo&s;al of &s;uch con&s;equence, the very fir&s;t time it was moved to me? and that I ought, if ever I con&s;ented to it, to capitulate with him, that he &s;hould never upbraid me with ea&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;enting too &s;oon: he &s;aid, no; but on the contrary, he would take it as a mark of the greate&s;t kindne&s;s I could &s;how him; then he went on to give rea&s;ons why there was no occa&s;ion to u&s;e the ordinary ceremony of delay; or to wait a rea&s;onable time of court&s;hip, which was only to avoid &s;candal; but, as this was pri|vate, it had nothing of that nature in it; that he had been courting me &s;ome time, by the be&s;t of court&s;hip, viz. doing acts of kindne&s;s to me; and that he had given te&s;timonies of his

&s;incere affection to me, by deeds, not by flat|tering trifles, and the u&s;ual court&s;hip of words, which were often found to have very little mean|ing; that he took me, not as a mi&s;tre&s;s, but, as his wife; and that he would not only be a hu&s;band to me, but a father to my children; and prote&s;ted, it was clear to him he might law|fully do it, and that I was perfectly at liberty; and a&s;&s;ured me by all that it was po&s;&s;ible for an hone&s;t man to &s;ay, that he would treat me as his wife as long as he lived; he prote&s;ted he loved me above all the world, and begged I would for once believe him; that he had never de|ceived me, and never would, but would make it his &s;tudy to make my life comfortable and happy, and to make me forget the mi&s;ery I had gone through.</P>
<P>I &s;tood &s;till a while, and did not &s;peak, for he now had almo&s;t conquered the re&s;i&s;tance I intended to make, but &s;eeing him eager for my an&s;wer, I &s;miled, and, looking up at him; <Q>&startq;And mu&s;t I then,' &s;ays I, '&s;ay yes at fir&s;t a&s;king?

<P><Q>&startq;By every thing that's &s;acred you may; and if I thought,' &s;aid he, 'I &s;hould ever prove fal&s;e, lovely and beautiful as you are, I here declare by all my hopes, both here and here|after, I would in&s;tantly de&s;i&s;t my purpo&s;e, and urge no longer to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e charms, but de|prive my&s;elf of that ble&s;&s;ing which I now &s;o earne&s;tly &s;olicit, and have &s;o often, and do at this in&s;tant, promi&s;e and vow to fulfil.&endq;</Q></P>

&endq;end of my life;'</Q> and with that I took him, with both my hands, and gave him the fir&s;t ki&s;s, which, from me, he had ever received.</P>
<P>And thus in gratitude for the favours I re|ceived from a man, was all &s;en&s;e of religion and duty to God, all regard to virtue and honour, given up at once, and we were to call one ano|ther man and wife, who, in the &s;en&s;e of the laws, both of God and our country, were no le&s;s than two adulterers; nor, as I have &s;aid above, was my con&s;cience &s;ilent in it, though, it &s;eems, his was; for I &s;inned with open eyes, and thereby had a double guilt upon me; as I always &s;aid his notions were of another kind, and he either was before of the opinion, or argued him|&s;elf into it now, that we were both free, and might lawfully marry.</P>
<P>But I was quite of another opinion, nay, and my judgment was right, but my circum&s;tances were my temptation. The terrors behind me looked blacker than the terrors before me; and the dreadful argument of wanting bread, and being run into the horrible di&s;tre&s;&s;es I was in before, ma&s;ter'd all my re&s;olution, and I gave my|&s;elf up to &s;hame and infamy.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the evening we &s;pent very agree|ably. He was perfectly good-humoured and ex|tremely cheerful; and I having con&s;ented, as above, to his propo&s;al, we had not much more to do; he gave me my writings, and the bond for my maintenance during his life, and for the five hundred pounds for my&s;elf, with the one hundred pounds, as has been &s;aid, for each of my children, after his death; and &s;o far was he from abating his fondne&s;s and affection to me, that two years after we were thus, as
<PB N="53" REF="67">
he called it, married, he made his will greatly in favour of me and my children, as will be re|lated hereafter.</P>
<P>Amy put us to bed, and my friend Mr. Dazzle, I cannot call him hu&s;band, was &s;o well plea&s;ed with Amy, for her fidelity and kindne&s;s to me, that he paid her all the arrear of her wages that I owed her, and gave her five guineas be&s;ides; and &s;urely Amy richly de&s;erved what &s;he had, for never was a &s;ervant &s;o true to a mi&s;tre&s;s in &s;uch dreadful circum&s;tances as I was in.</P>
<P>We lived, certainly, the mo&s;t agreeable life, the grand exception only excepted, that ever two lived together; he was the mo&s;t obliging, and the mo&s;t tender men, $Word$, that ever woman gave her&s;elf up to; nor was there ever the lea&s;t inter|ruption to our mutual kindne&s;s, no, not to the la&s;t day of his life; and he would frequently &s;ay, for I confe&s;s I loved him, that he e&s;teemed me as much his wife, as if we had been married from our youth, and had neither of us known any other; nay, he loved me, I believe, as en|tirely, as if I had been the wife of his youth; and, he told me, it was true, in one &s;en&s;e, that he had two wives, but that I was the wife of his affection, the other the wife of his aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, we lived as cheerfully, and as happily, as could be expected, con&s;idering our circum|&s;tances; I mean as to the pretended marriage, and as to that, Mr. Dazzle had not the lea&s;t con|cern about him for it: yet I could not help it; there was, and would be, hours of intervals, and of dark reflections, which came involuntarily in, and thru&s;t in &s;ighs into the middle of all my &s;ongs; and there would be, &s;ometimes, a heavi|ne&s;s of heart, which intermingled it&s;elf with all my joy, and which would often fetch a tear; and
<PB N="54" REF="68">
let others pretend what they will, I believe it im|po&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e with any-body; there can be no &s;ub&s;tantial &s;atisfaction in a life of known wickedne&s;s: con&s;cience will, and does, often break in upon them at particular times, let them do what they can to prevent it.</P>
<P>But I am not to preach, but to relate, and what|ever loo&s;e reflections were, and how often &s;oever tho&s;e dark intervals came on, I did my utmo&s;t to conceal them from him; aye, and to &s;uppre&s;s, and &s;mother them too in my&s;elf; and to outward ap|pearance we lived as cheerfully, and as agreeably, as it was po&s;&s;ible for any couple in the world to live.</P>
<P>After I had thus lived with him &s;omething above two years, I found my&s;elf with child; Mr. Dazzle was mightily plea&s;ed at it, and nothing could be kinder than he was in the preparations he made for me, and for my lying-in, which was, however, very private, becau&s;e I cared for as lit|tle company as po&s;&s;ible; nor had I kept up my neighbourly acquaintance; &s;o that I had no-body to invite upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was brought to-bed of a daughter, but the child died at about &s;ix weeks old; and the next year I brought him a &s;on, to his great &s;atisfaction: it was a charming child, and did very well.</P>
<P>Some time after this, Mr. Dazzle came to me one evening, and told me, he had a very difficult thing happened to him, which he knew not what to do in, or how to re&s;olve about, unle&s;s I would make him ea&s;y: this was, that his occa&s;ions re|quired him to go over to France for about two months.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, my dear,' &s;ays I, 'and how &s;hall I make you ea&s;y?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="55" REF="69">
&startq;Why, by con&s;enting to let me go,' &s;ays he, upon which condition, I will tell you the occa&s;i|on of my going, that you may judge of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity&endq; there is for it on my &s;ide.</Q> Then to make me ea&s;y in his going, he told me, he would make his will before he went, which &s;hould be to my full &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I told him, the la&s;t part was &s;o kind, that I could not decline the fir&s;t part, unle&s;s he would give me leave to add, that if it was not for put|ting him to an extraordinary expence, I would go over along with him.</P>
<P>He was &s;o plea&s;ed with this offer, that he told me, he would give me full &s;atisfaction for it, and accept of it too; &s;o he took me to London with him the next day, and there he made his will, and &s;hewed it to me, and &s;ealed it before proper witne&s;&s;es, and then gave it me to keep. In this will he gave a thou&s;and pounds to a per&s;on that we both knew very well, in tru&s;t, to pay it, with the intere&s;t from the time of his decea&s;e, to me, or my a&s;&s;igns; then he willed the payment of my jointure, as he called it, viz. his bond as be|fore-mentioned, to me and my children, after his death; he al&s;o gave me all the hou&s;hold-goods, plate, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t engaging thing for a man to do to one under my circum&s;tances; and it would have been hard, as I told him, to deny him any thing, or to refu&s;e to go with him any where; &s;o we &s;ettled every thing as well as we could; left Amy in charge with the hou&s;e and children, for now they were all come home; and for his other bu&s;ine&s;s, which was in jewels, he had two men he entru&s;ted, who he had good &s;ecurity for,

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>A Journey to Paris.&mdash;Villainy undi&s;covered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THings being thus concerted, and &s;o privately as his agents knew nothing of me, we went away to France, arrived &s;afe at Calais, and by ea&s;y journies, came in eight days to Paris, where we lodged in the hou&s;e of an Engli&s;h merchant of his acquaintance, as hu&s;band and wife, and were very courteou&s;ly entertained.</P>
<P>Mr. Dazzle's bu&s;ine&s;s was with &s;ome per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank, and to whom he had &s;old &s;ome jewels of very good value, and received a great &s;um of money in &s;pecie, and, as he told me privately, he gained three thou&s;and pi&s;toles by the bargain, but would not &s;uffer the mo&s;t inti|mate friend he had there, to know what he had received; for it is not &s;o &s;afe a thing in Paris, to have a great &s;um of money in keeping, as it might be in London.</P>
<P>We made this journey much longer than we intended; and he &s;ent for one of his managers in London, to come over to us to Paris with &s;ome diamonds, and &s;ent him back to London again, to fetch more; then other bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ell into his hands &s;o unexpectedly, that I began to think we &s;hould take up our con&s;tant re&s;idence there, which I was not very aver&s;e to, it being my native coun|try, and I &s;poke the language perfectly well; &s;o we took a hou&s;e in Paris, and lived very genteely: Mr. Dazzle offered to keep me a coach, but I declined it, e&s;pecially in Paris; but as they have tho&s;e conveniencies by the day there, at a certain
<PB N="57" REF="71">
rate, I had an equipage provided for me when|ever I plea&s;ed, and I lived here in a very good fi|gure, and might have lived higher if I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But in the middle of all this felicity, a dreadful di&s;a&s;ter befel me, which entirely unhinged all my af|fairs, and threw me back into the &s;ame &s;tate of life that I was in before; with this one happy exception however, that whereas before I was poor, even to mi|&s;ery, now I was not only provided for, but very rich.</P>
<P>Mr. Dazzle had the name in Paris for a very rich man, and indeed, he was &s;o, though not &s;o immen&s;ely rich as people imagined; but that which was fatal to him, was, that he generally carried a &s;hagreen ca&s;e in his pocket, e&s;pecially when he went to court, or to the hou&s;es of any of the Princes of the blood, in which he had jewels of very great value.</P>
<P>It happened one day, that being to go to Ver|failles, to wait upon the Prince of C&mdash;, he came up into my chamber in the morning, and laid out his jewel-ca&s;e, becau&s;e he was not going to &s;how any jewels, but to get a foreign bill accepted, which he had received from Am&s;terd$m; &s;o when he gave me the ca&s;e, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;My dear, I think I need not carry this with me, becau&s;e, it may be, I may not come back t$ll night, and it is too much to venture:' I returned, Then my dear, you &s;han't go.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'Why? my dear,' &s;ays he.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Becau&s;e as they are too much for you, &s;o you are too much for me to venture; and you &s;hall not go, unle&s;s you will promi&s;e me not to &s;tay &s;o as&endq; to come back in the night.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I hope there is no danger,' &s;aid he, '&s;eeing I have nothing about me of any value; and,&endq; therefore, left I &s;hould, take the&s;e too.'</Q> And
<PB N="58" REF="72">
gives me his gold watch, and a rich diamond, which he had in a ring, and always wore on his finger.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well but, my dear,' &s;ays I, 'you make me more unea&s;y now than before; for if you appre|hend no danger, why do you u&s;e this caution? and if you apprehend there is danger, why do you go at all?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;There is no danger,' &s;ays he, 'if I do not &s;tay late, and I do not de&s;ign to do &s;o.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, but promi&s;e me then, that you won't, &s;ays I, 'or el&s;e I cannot con&s;ent to your going.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I won't indeed, my dear,' &s;ays he, 'unle&s;s I am obliged to it; I a&s;&s;ure you I do not in|tend it; but if I &s;hould, I am not worth rob|bing now; for I have nothing about me, but&endq; about &s;ix pi&s;toles in my pur&s;e, and this little ring.'</Q> Shewing me a &s;mall diamond ring, worth about ten or twelve pi&s;toles, which he put upon his fin|ger, in the room of the rich one.</P>
<P>I &s;till pre&s;&s;ed him not to &s;tay late, and he &s;aid he would not. <Q>&startq;But if I am kept late,' &s;ays he, beyond my expectation, I will &s;tay all night, and come next morning.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This &s;eemed a very good caution: but &s;till my mind was very unea&s;y about him, and I told him &s;o, and entreated him not to go. I told him, I did not know what might be the rea&s;on, but that I had a &s;trange terror upon my mind about his going, and that, if he did go, I was per&s;uaded &s;ome harm would attend him. He &s;miled, and returned; <Q>&startq;Well, my dear, if it &s;hould be &s;o, you are now richly provided for; all that&endq; I have here, I give to you;'</Q> and with that, he takes up the ca&s;ket; <Q>&startq;Here,' &s;ays he, 'hold
<PB N="59" REF="73">
your hand, there is a good e&s;tate for you in this ca&s;e; if any thing happens to me, it is all your&endq; own, I give it to you for your&s;elf.'</Q> And with that, he put the ca&s;ket, the fine ring, and his gold watch, all into my hands, and the key of his e&s;critoir be&s;ides; adding, 'And in my e&s;critoir 'there is &s;ome money: it is all your own.'</P>
<P>I &s;tared at him, as if I was frighted, as indeed I was, for I thought his countenance changed, and he appeared terrified, and full of horror; but it all went off, and he looked as he u&s;ually did. Immediately I fell a crying, and hung about him. <Q>&startq;My dear,' &s;aid I, 'I am frighted to death; you &s;hall not go; depend upon it, &s;ome mi&s;chief will&endq; befal you.'</Q> I did not tell him how my vapori&s;h fancy had repre&s;ented him to me, that I thought was not proper; be&s;ides, he would only have laughed at me, and would have gone away with a je&s;t about it. But I pre&s;&s;ed him &s;eriou&s;ly not to go that day; or if he did, to promi&s;e me to come home to Paris by day-light. He looked a little graver then, than he did before; told me, he was not apprehen&s;ive of the lea&s;t danger; but if there was, he would either take care to come in the day, or, as he &s;aid before, would &s;tay all night.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e promi&s;es came to nothing; for he was &s;et upon in the open day, and robbed, by three men on hor&s;eback, ma&s;ked, as he went; and one of them, who, it &s;eems, rifled him, while the re&s;t &s;tood to &s;top the coach, &s;tabbed him in the body with a &s;word, &s;o that he died immediate|ly. He had a footman behind the coach, who they knocked down, with the &s;tock, or but-end of a carbine. They were &s;uppo&s;ed to kill him, becau&s;e of the di&s;appointment they met with, in
<PB N="60" REF="74">
not getting his ca&s;ket of diamonds, which they knew he carried about him; and this was &s;uppo&s;ed, becau&s;e after they had killed him, they made the coachman drive out of the road, a long way over the heath, till they came to a convenient place, where they pulled him out of the coach, and &s;earched his cloaths more narrowly than they could do while he was alive.</P>
<P>But they found nothing but his little ring, &s;ix pi&s;toles, and the value of about &s;even livres in &s;mall monies.</P>
<P>This was a dreadful blow to me; though I cannot &s;ay I was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed as I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been; for all the while he was gone, my mind was oppre&s;&s;ed with the weight of my own thoughts; and I was as &s;ure that I &s;hould never &s;ee him any more, that I think nothing could be like it; the impre&s;&s;ion was &s;o &s;trong, that, I think, nothing could make &s;o deep a wound that was imaginary; and I was &s;o dejected and di&s;con&s;olate, that when I received the news of his di&s;a&s;ter, there was no room for any extraordinary alteration in me: I had cried great part of the day, eat nothing, and only waited, as I might &s;ay, to receive the di&s;mal news, which I had brought to me about five o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>I was in a &s;trange country; and though I had a pretty many acquaintances, had but very few friends that I could con&s;ult on the occa&s;ion' All po&s;&s;ible enquiry was made after the villains that had been thus babrarous, but nothing could be heard of them; nor was it po&s;&s;ible that the footman could make any di&s;covery of them, by his de&s;cription; for they knocked him down im|mediately, &s;o that he knew nothing of what was done afterwards; the coachman was the only man
<PB N="61" REF="75">
that could &s;ay any thing, and all his account a|mounted to no more than this, that one of them had &s;oldier's cloaths, but he could not remember the particulars of his mounting, &s;o as to know what regiment he belonged to; and as to their faces, that he could know nothing of, becau&s;e they had all of them ma&s;ks on.</P>
<P>I had him buried as decently as the place would permit a prote&s;tant &s;tranger to be buried, and made &s;ome of the &s;cruples and difficulties on that account ea&s;y, by the help of money to a per&s;on, who went boldly to the curate of the pari&s;h of St. Sulpitius, in Paris, and told him, that the Gen|tleman that was killed, was a catholic; that the thieves had taken from him a cro&s;s of gold, &s;et with diamonds, worth &s;ix thou&s;and livres; that his wi|dow was a catholic, and had &s;ent by him &s;ixty crowns to the church, for ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for the repo&s;e of his &s;oul. Upon all which, though not one word of it was true, he was buried with all the ceremonies of the Roman Church.</P>
<P>I almo&s;t cried my&s;elf to death for him; for I abandoned my&s;elf to all the exce&s;&s;es of grief: and indeed, I loved him to a degree inexpre&s;&s;ible; and con&s;idering what kindne&s;s he had &s;hewn me at fir&s;t, and how tenderly he had u&s;ed me to the la&s;t, what could I do le&s;s?</P>
<P>Then, the matter of his death was terrible and frightful$ to me, and I was a good while as one &s;tupid; however, after &s;ome time, I began to re|cover, and look into my affairs. I had the &s;atis|fection not to be left in di&s;tre&s;s, or in danger of poverty; on the contrary, be&s;ides what he had put into my hands fairly, in his life-time, which a|mounted to a very con&s;iderable value: I found above &s;even hundred pi&s;toles in gold, in his e&s;cri|toir, of which he had given me the key: and I
<PB N="62" REF="76">
found foreign bills accepted, for about twelve thou|&s;and livres; &s;o that, in a word, I found my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of almo&s;t ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, in a very few days after this di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I did upon this occa&s;ion, was, to &s;end a letter to my maid Amy; with an in|junction of &s;ecrecy, not to acquaint any one with it, not even my children; wherein I gave her the particulars of my di&s;a&s;ter; how Mr. Dazzle was murdered. And as I did not know how his rela|tions, or his wife's friends, might act upon that occa&s;ion, I ordered her to convey away all the plate, linen, and other things of value, and to &s;ecure them in per&s;on's hands that I directed her to, and then to &s;ell and di&s;po&s;e of the furniture of the hou&s;e, if &s;he could; and &s;o, without acquainting any-body with the rea&s;on of her going, withdraw; &s;ending notice to the head-manager at London, that the hou&s;e was quitted by the tenant, and they might come and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for the exe|cutors. Amy was &s;o dexterous, and did the work &s;o nimbly, that &s;he emptied the hou&s;e, and &s;ent the key to the &s;aid manager, almo&s;t as &s;oon as he had notice of the misfortune that befel their ma&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>An Incident agreeable to mo&s;t Wives.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UPON their receiving the &s;urpri&s;ing news of his death, the head-manager came over to Paris: I made no &s;cruple of calling my&s;elf Ma|dam Dazzle, the widow of Mon&s;ieur Dazzle, the Engli&s;h jeweller; and as I &s;poke French naturally, I did not let him know but that I was his wife, married in France, and that I had not heard that
<PB N="63" REF="77">
he had any wife in England; but pretended to be &s;urpri&s;ed, and exclaim again&s;t him for &s;o ba&s;e an action; and that I had good friends in Poictou, where I was born, who would take care to have ju&s;tice done me in England, out of his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, that as &s;oon as the news was public of a man being murdered, and that he was a jeweller, fame did me the favour as to publi&s;h pre&s;ently, that he was robbed of his ca&s;ket of jewels, which he always carried about him. I confirmed this among my daily lamenta|tions for his di&s;a&s;ter, and added, that he had with him a fine diamond ring, which he was known to wear frequently about him, valued at a hundred pi&s;toles, a gold watch, and a great quantity of diamonds of ine&s;timable value, in his ca&s;ket; which jewels he was carrying to the Prince of C&mdash;, to &s;how &s;ome of them to him; and the Prince owned, that he had &s;poken to him to bring &s;ome &s;uch jewels, to let him &s;ee them. But I &s;orely repented this part afterwards, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>This rumour put an end to all enquiry after his jewels, his ring, or his watch; and as for the &s;even hundred pi&s;toles, the&s;e I &s;ecured: for the bills which were in hand, I owned I had them; but that, as I &s;aid, I brought my hu&s;band thirty thou&s;and livres portion, I claimed the &s;aid bills, which came to about twelve thou&s;and livres, for my amende; and this, with the plate, and the hou&s;hold-goods was the principal of all his e&s;tate which they could come at. As to the foreign-bill, which he was going to Ver&s;ailles to get accepted, it was really lo&s;t with him; but his manager, who had remitted the bill to him by way of Am&s;terdam, bringing over the &s;econd bill, the
<PB N="64" REF="78">
money was &s;aved, as they called it, which would, otherwi&s;e, have been al&s;o gone; the villains who robbed and murdered him, were, to be &s;ure, afraid to &s;end any-body to get the bill ac|cepted; for that would undoubtedly have di&s;co|vered them.</P>
<P>By this time my maid Amy was arrived, and &s;he gave me an account of her management, and how &s;he had &s;ecured every thing, and that &s;he had quitted the hou&s;e, and &s;ent the key to the head|manager of his bu&s;ine&s;s; and let me know how much &s;he had made of every thing, very punctu|ally and hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erved in the account of his dwelling with me &s;o long at Kenti&s;h-town, that he never pa&s;&s;ed for any thing there, but a lodger in the hou&s;e; and though he was landlord, that did not alter the ca&s;e; &s;o that at his death, Amy coming to quit the hou&s;e, and give them the key, there was no affinity between that, and the ca&s;e of their ma&s;ter, who was newly killed.</P>
<P>I got good advice at Paris, from an eminent lawyer, a Coun&s;ellor of the Parliament there, and laying my ca&s;e before him, he directed me to make a proce&s;s in dower upon the e&s;tate, for making good my new fortune upon matrimony, which accordingly I did; and, upon the whole, the manager went back to England, well &s;atisfied, that he had gotten the unaccepted bills of ex|change, which were for two thou&s;and five hun|dred pounds, with &s;ome other things, which toge|ther, amounted to a very large &s;um; and thus I got rid of him.</P>
<P>I was vi&s;ited with great civility on this &s;ad occa&s;ion, of the lo&s;s of my hu&s;band, as they thought him, by a great many Ladies of quality;
<PB N="65" REF="79">
and the Prince of C&mdash;, to whom it was reported he was carrying the jewels, &s;ent his Gentleman with a very hand&s;ome compliment of condolance to me; and his Gentleman, whether with or without order, hinted, as if his Highne&s;s did in|tend to have vi&s;ited me him&s;elf, but that &s;ome ac|cident, which he made a long &s;tory of, had pre|vented him.</P>
<P>By the c$ncour&s;e of ladies and others, that thus came to vi&s;it me, I began to be much known; and as I did not forget to &s;et my&s;elf out with all po&s;&s;ible advantage, con&s;idering the dre&s;s of a wi|dow; I &s;ay, as I did thus from my own vanity, for I was not ignorant that I was very hand&s;ome; I &s;ay, on this account, I was &s;oon made very publick, and was known by the name of La Belle veufeu de Poictou; or, The pretty Widow of Poictou. As I was very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee my|&s;elf thus hand&s;omely u&s;ed in my affliction, it &s;oon dried up all my tears; and though I appeared as a widow, yet, as we &s;ay in England, it was a widow comforted: I took care to let the Ladies &s;ee, that I knew how to receive them; that I was not at a lo&s;s how to behave to any of them; and, in &s;hort, I began to be very popular there; but I had an occa&s;ion afterwards, which made me decline that kind of management, as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>About four days after I had received the com|pliments of condolance from the Prince of C&mdash;, the &s;ame gentleman he had &s;ent before came to tell me, that his Highne&s;s was coming to give me a vi&s;it. I was, indeed, &s;urpri&s;ed at that. How|ever, as there was no remedy, I prepared to re|ceive him as well as I could. It was not many
<PB N="66" REF="80">
minutes before his Highne&s;s came, introduced by his own Gentleman, and, by my woman, Amy.</P>
<P>He treated me with abundance of civility, and condoled politely the lo&s;s of my hu&s;band, and likewi&s;e the manner of it; he told me, he un|der&s;tood he was coming to Ver&s;ailles, to him&s;elf, to &s;hew him &s;ome jewels; that it was true, that he had di&s;cour&s;ed with him about jewels, but could not imagine how any villains &s;hould hear of his coming at that time with them; that he had not ordered him to attend with them at Ver&s;ailles, but told him that he would come to Paris by &s;uch a day, &s;o that he was no way acce&s;&s;ary to the di&s;a&s;ter. I told him gravely, I knew very well that all his Highne&s;s had &s;aid of that part, was true; that the&s;e villains knew his profe&s;&s;ion, and knew, no doubt, that he always carried a ca&s;ket of jewels about him, and that he always wore a diamond ring, on his finger worth a hundred pi&s;toles, which report had magnified to five hun|dred; and that if he had been going to any other place, it would have been the &s;ame thing. After this, his Highne&s;s ro&s;e up to go, and told me, he had re&s;olved, however, to make me &s;ome re|paration; and with the&s;e words, put a &s;ilk pur&s;e into my hand, with a hundred pi&s;toles, and told me, he would make me a farther compliment of a &s;mall pen&s;ion, which his gentleman would in|form me of.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure I behaved with a due &s;en&s;e of &s;o much goodne&s;s, and offered to kneel to ki&s;s his hand; but he took me up, and &s;aluted me, and &s;at down again, though before, he made as if he was going away, making me &s;it down by him.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="81">
He then began to talk with me more fami|liarly; told me he hoped I was not left in bad circum&s;tances; that Mr. Dazzle was reputed to be very rich, and that he had gained lately great &s;ums by &s;ome jewels; and he hoped, he &s;aid, that I had &s;till a fortune agreeable to the con|dition I had lived in before.</P>
<P>I replied, with tears, That I believed if Mr. Dazzle had lived, we &s;hould have been far out of danger of want; but that it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;timate the lo&s;s which I had &s;u&s;tained, be&s;ides that of the life of my hu&s;band; that by the opi|nion of tho&s;e that knew &s;omething of his affairs, and of what value the jewels were which he in|tended to have &s;hewn to his Highne&s;s, he could not have le&s;s about him, than the value of a hundred thou&s;and livres; that it was a fatal blow to me, and to his whole family, e&s;pecially that they &s;hould be lo&s;t in &s;uch a manner.</P>
<P>His Highne&s;s returned, with an air of concern, that he was very &s;orry for it; but he hoped, if I &s;ettled in Paris, I might find ways to re&s;tore my fortune; at the &s;ame time he complimented me upon my being the fine&s;t woman, both in figure and features, that he had ever &s;een, and that I could not fail of admirers. I bowed, and hum|bly thanked his Highne&s;s, but told him, I had no expectations of that kind; that I thought I &s;hould be obliged to go over to England, to look after my hu&s;band's effects there, which I was told were con&s;iderable; but that I did not know what ju&s;tice a poor &s;tranger would get among them; and as for Paris, my fortune be|ing &s;o impaired, I &s;aw nothing before me, but to go back to Poictou, to my friends, where &s;ome of my relations, I hoped, might do &s;ome|thing
<PB N="68" REF="82">
for me; and added, that one of my bro|thers was an Abbot, near Poictiers.</P>
<P>He ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and, taking me by the hand, led me to a large looking-gla&s;s, which made up the pier in the front of the parlour; <Q>&startq;Look there, Madam,' &s;aid he, 'is it &s;it that&endq; face, that &s;hape, tho&s;e eyes,'</Q> pointing to my figure in the gla&s;s, '&s;hould go back to Poictou? <Q>'No, Madam,' &s;ays he, &startq;&s;tay, and make &s;ome per&s;on of quality happy, that may, in return, make you forget all your &s;orrows;&endq;</Q> and with that, he took me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ing me twice, told me, he would &s;ee me again, but with le&s;s ceremony.</P>
<P>Some little time after this, his Gentleman came to me again, and with great ceremony and re&s;pect, delivered me a black box, tied with a &s;carlet ribband, and &s;ealed with the Prince's coat of arms; there was in it a grant from his High|ne&s;s, with a warrant to his Banker to pay me two thou&s;and livres a year, during my &s;tay in Paris, as the widow of Mon&s;ieur Dazzle, the Jeweller, mentioning the horrid murder of my late hu&s;band, as the occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>I received it with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and ex|pre&s;&s;ions of being infinitely obliged to his ma&s;ter, and of my &s;hewing my&s;elf on all occa&s;ions his Highne&s;s's mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant; and after giv|ing my mo&s;t humble duty to his Highne&s;s, with the utmo&s;t acknowledgments of the obligation; I went to a little cabinet, and taking out &s;ome gold, offered to give him five pi&s;toles.</P>
<P>He drew back, but with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and told me, he humbly thanked me, but that he dur&s;t not accept them; that his Highne&s;s would take it &s;o ill of him, he was &s;ure he would
<PB N="69" REF="83">
never &s;ee his face more; but that he would not fail to acquaint his Highne&s;s what re&s;pect I had offered; and added, <Q>&startq;I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, you engro&s;s the thoughts of the Prince, my ma&s;ter, to a greater degree than you imagine; and, I be|lieve,&endq; you will hear more of him.'</Q> I told him, if his Highne&s;s did me the honour to &s;ee me again, I hoped he would not let me be &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed as I was before; that I would be glad to have &s;ome little notice of it, and would be obliged to him, if he would procure it me. He replied, he was very &s;ure, that when his Highne&s;s intended to vi&s;it me, he &s;hould be &s;ent before, to give me notice of it; and that he would give me as much warning of it as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The &s;ame per&s;on came &s;everal times after this about the &s;ettlement, the grant requiring &s;everal things yet to be done for making it payable, without going every time to the Prince again for a fre&s;h warrant. The particulars of this part I did not under&s;tand; but as &s;oon as it was fini&s;hed, which was above two months, the Gentlem$n came one afternoon, and &s;aid, his Highne&s;s de|&s;igned to vi&s;it me in the evening; but de&s;ired to be admitted without ceremony.</P>
<P>Now I began to have &s;u&s;picions, and re&s;olved, if his Highne&s;s did come again, he &s;hould &s;ee me under no di&s;advantages if I could help it; there|fore I prepared not my rooms only, but my&s;elf; and when he came in, there was no-body ap|peared in the hou&s;e but his Gentleman, and my maid Amy; and of her I bid the Gentleman ac|quaint his Highne&s;s, that &s;he was an Engli&s;h wo|man, that &s;he did not under&s;tand a word of French; and that &s;he was one al&s;o that might be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="84">
When he came into my room, I fell down at his feet, and with words full of duty and re&s;pect, thanked him for his bounty and goodne&s;s to a poor de&s;olate woman, oppre&s;&s;ed under the weight of &s;o terrible a di&s;a&s;ter, and refu&s;ed to ri&s;e till he would allow me the honour to ki&s;s his hand.</P>
<P><Q><HI>&startq;Leves vous done,'</HI> &s;ays the Prince, taking me in his arms, 'I de&s;ign more favours for you, than this trifle; and,' he added, 'you &s;hall, for the future, find a friend where you did not look for it; and I re&s;olve to let you &s;ee how kind I can be to one, who is, to me, the mo&s;t agreeable creature on earth.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I was in a kind of half-mourning, had turned off my weeds, and my head was &s;o dre&s;&s;ed, as failed not to &s;et me out with advantage, for, now I began to under&s;tand his meaning; and the Prince profe&s;&s;ed, I was the mo&s;t beautiful crea|ture on earth; and 'Where have I lived?' &s;ays he; <Q>&startq;and how ill have I been &s;erved, that I &s;hould never, till now, be &s;hewed the fine&s;t woman in France?&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This was the way, the mo&s;t likely to break in upon my virtue, if I had been mi&s;tre&s;s of any, for I was now extremely vain, and particularly of my beauty; which, as other people admired, &s;o I became every day more in love with my&s;elf than before.</P>
<P>He &s;aid &s;ome very kind things to me after this, and &s;at down with me for an hour, or more; when getting up, and calling his Gentleman by his name, he threw open the door, <HI>'Au boir,'</HI> &s;ays he; upon which, his Gentleman immediately brought up a little table, covered with a fine da|ma&s;k cloth, the table no bigger than he could bring in his two hands; but upon it was &s;et two
<PB N="71" REF="85">
decanters, one of champaigne, and the other of water, &s;ix &s;ilver plates, and a &s;ervice of fine &s;weet-meats in fine china di&s;hes, on a &s;et of rings &s;tanding up about twenty inches high, one above another; below, were three roa&s;ted patridges, and a quail. As &s;oon as the Gentleman had &s;et all down, he ordered him to withdraw. 'Now,' &s;ays the Prince, 'I intend to &s;up with you.'</P>
<P>When he &s;ent away his Gentleman, I &s;tood up, and offered to wait on his Highne&s;s while he eat; but he po&s;itively refu&s;ed, and told me. <Q>&startq;No, to-morrow you &s;hall be the widow of Mon&s;ieur Dazzle, the jeweller, but to-night you &s;hall be my mi&s;tre&s;s; therefore &s;it here,' &s;ays he, 'and eat with me, or I will get up and &s;erve.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I would then have called up my woman, Amy, but I thought that would not be proper neither; &s;o I made my excu&s;e, that &s;ince his Highne&s;s would not let his own &s;ervant wait, I would not pre&s;ume to let my woman come up; but if he would plea&s;e to let me wait, it would be my honour to fill his Highne&s;s's wine: but, as before, he would by no means allow me; &s;o we &s;at and eat toge|ther.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Now, Madam,' &s;ays the Prince, 'give me leave to lay a&s;ide my character; let us talk to|gether with the freedom of equals. My quality &s;ets me at a di&s;tance from you, and makes you ceremonious; your beauty exalts you to more than an equality; I mu&s;t then treat you as lovers do their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, but I cannot &s;peak the lan|guage; it is enough to tell you, how agreeable you are to me; how I am &s;urpri&s;ed at your beauty, and re&s;olve to make you happy, and to be happy with you.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="86">
I blu&s;hed, and looking towards him, &s;aid, I was already made happy, in the favour of a per|&s;on of &s;uch rank; and had nothing to a&s;k of his Highne&s;s, but that he would believe me infinitely obliged.</P>
<P>After he had done eating, he poured the &s;weet|meats into my lap; and the wine being out, he called his Gentleman again, to take away the things, and laying another cloth, &s;et the table on one &s;ide of the room, with a noble &s;ervice of plate upon it; then having &s;et the two decanters again upon the table, filled, as before, he withdrew; for I found the fellow under&s;tood his bu&s;ine&s;s very well, and his Lord's bu&s;ine&s;s too.</P>
<P>About half an hour after, the Prince told me, that I offered to wait a little before; that if I would now take the trouble, he would give me leave to give him &s;ome wine: &s;o I went to the table, filled a gla&s;s of wine, and brought it to him, on a fine &s;alver, which the gla&s;&s;es &s;tood on, and brought a decanter of water in my other hand, to mix it as he thought fit.</P>
<P>He &s;miled, and bid me look on that &s;alver; which I did, and admired it much, for it was a very fine one, indeed. <Q>&startq;You may &s;ee,' &s;ays he, I re&s;olve to have more of your company, for my&endq; &s;ervant &s;hall leave you that plate, for my u&s;e.'</Q> I told him, I believed his Highne&s;s would not take it ill, that I was not furni&s;hed fit to entertain a per&s;on of his rank; and that I would take great care of it, and value my&s;elf infinitely upon the honour of his Highne&s;s's vi&s;it.</P>
<P>It now began to grow late, and he began to take notice of it: 'But,' &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;I cannot leave you; have you not a &s;pare lodging, for one&endq; night?'</Q> I told him, I had but a homely lodg|ing
<PB N="73" REF="87">
to entertain &s;uch a gue&s;t; he &s;aid &s;omething exceeding kind on that head, but needle&s;s to re|peat; adding, that my company would make him amends.</P>
<P>About one in the morning, I begged leave to withdraw, &s;uppo&s;ing he would go to bed: but he &s;aid, 'I am not going to-bed yet; pray let me &s;ee 'you again.'</P>
<P>I took this time to undre&s;s me, and to come in a new dre&s;s, which was, in a manner, <HI>une di&s;ha|bille,</HI> but &s;o neat, and &s;o agreeable, that he &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed.

<P><Q>&startq;It is only a loo&s;e habit, my Lord,' &s;aid I;&endq; that I may the better wait on your Highne&s;s:</Q></P>
<P>'You are perfectly obliging,' &s;ays he: and with that he took me in his arms, and&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;My Lord! my woman! my woman's com|ing!&endq; And will&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion was, an appointment to &s;up with me the next evening.</P>
<P>I have mentioned this, to &s;hew how unhappy women are ruined by great men; for though poverty is an irre&s;i&s;tible temptation to the poor, vanity and &s;plendor are as irre&s;i&s;tible to the rich; to be courted by a Prince, who was fir&s;t a bene|factor, then an admirer; to be called hand&s;ome, the fine&s;t woman in France; are things, a woman mu&s;t have no vanity, nay, no corruption in her, that is not overcome by it; and my ca&s;e was &s;uch, that, I am afraid, I had too much of both.</P>
<P>Had I been mi&s;tre&s;s of any re&s;olution; all had been &s;afe: but my virtue was lo&s;t before, and the Devil, who had found the way to break in upon me by one temptation, ea&s;ily ma&s;tered me now,
<PB N="74" REF="88">
by another; and I gave my&s;elf up to a per&s;on, who was not only a man of high dignity, but was the mo&s;t tempting and obliging man I had ever yet met with.</P>
<P>I had the &s;ame particular to in&s;i&s;t upon here with the Prince, that I had with Mr. Dazzle before. I he&s;itated much at con&s;enting, at fir&s;t a&s;king; but the Prince told me, Princes did not court like other men; that they brought more powerful arguments; and he very prettily added, that they were &s;ooner repul&s;ed that other men, and ought to be &s;ooner complied with; intimating, though very genteely, that after a woman had po&s;i|tively refu&s;ed him once, he could not, like other men, wait with importunities, and &s;tratagems, and laying long &s;ieges; but as &s;uch men as he &s;tormed warmly, &s;o, if repul&s;ed, they made no &s;e|cond attacks. And indeed, it was but rea&s;onable; for as it was below their rank, to be long battering a woman's con&s;tancy, &s;o they run greater ha|zards in being expo&s;ed in their amours, than other men did.</P>
<P>I took this for a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, and told his Highne&s;s, that I had the &s;ame thoughts, in re|&s;pect to the manner of his attacks, for that his per&s;on, and his arguments, were irre&s;i&s;tible; that a per&s;on of his rank, and a munificence &s;o un|bounded, could not be with&s;tood; that no virtue was proof again&s;t him, except &s;uch, as was able too to &s;uffer martyrdom. That I thought it im|po&s;&s;ible I could be overcome; but that now I found it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould not be overcome. That &s;o much goodne&s;s, joined with &s;o much greatne&s;s, would have conquered any woman; and that I confe&s;&s;ed he had the victory over me, by a merit infinitely &s;uperior to the conque&s;t he had made.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="89">
He made me a mo&s;t obliging an&s;wer; told me, abundance of fine things, which &s;till flattered my vanity, till at la&s;t I began to have pride enough to believe him, and fancied my&s;elf a fit mi&s;tre&s;s for a Prince.</P>
<P>As he had thus, as I have &s;aid, obtained the la&s;t favour, and he had all the freedom with me that it was po&s;&s;ible for me to grant, &s;o he gave me leave to u&s;e as much freedom with him another way, and that was, to have every thing of him I thought fit to command; and yet I did not a&s;k of him with an air of avarice as if I was greedily making a property of him; but I ma|naged him with &s;uch art, that he generally antici|pated my demands. He only reque&s;ted of me, that I would not think of taking another hou&s;e, as I had intimated to him, that I had intended, not thinking it good enough to receive his vi&s;its in; but, he &s;aid, my hou&s;e was the mo&s;t convenient that could po&s;&s;ibly be found in all Paris for an a|mour, e&s;pecially for him; having a way out into three &s;treets, and not overlooked by any neigh|bours; &s;o that he could pa&s;s and repa&s;s without ob&s;ervation: for one of the back-ways opened in|to a narrow dark pa&s;&s;age, which pa&s;&s;age was a thorough-fare, out of one &s;treet into another; and any per&s;on that went in or out by the door, had no more to do, but to &s;ee there was no-body follow|ed him in the pa&s;&s;age, before he went in at the door. This reque&s;t I knew was rea&s;onable, and therefore, I a&s;&s;ured him I would not change my dwelling, &s;eeing his Highne&s;s did not think it too mean for me to receive him in.</P>
<P>He al&s;o de&s;ired me, that I would not take any more &s;ervants, or &s;et up any equipage, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="76" REF="90">
for the pre&s;ent; for that it would then be imme|diately concluded, I had been left very rich; and then I &s;hould be thronged with the impertinence of admirers, who would be attracted by the mo|ney, as well as by the beauty of a young widow, and he &s;hould be frequently interrupted in his vi&s;its; or, that the world would conclude I was maintained by &s;ome body, and would be inde|fatigable to find out the per&s;on; &s;o that he &s;hould have &s;pies peeping at him, every time he went out or in, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;appoint; and that he &s;hould pre&s;ently have it talked over all the toilets in Paris, that the Prince de C&mdash;had got the jeweller's widow for a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This was too ju&s;t to oppo&s;e; and I made no &s;cruple to tell his Highne&s;s, that &s;ince he had &s;tooped &s;o low as to make me his own, he ought to have all the &s;atisfaction in the world that I was &s;o; that I would take all the mea&s;ures he &s;hould plea&s;e to direct me, to avoid the im|pertinent attacks of others; and that, if he thought fit, I would be wholly within doors, and have it given out, that I was obliged to go to England, to &s;olicit my affairs there, after my hu&s;|band's misfortune; and that I was not expected there again for at lea&s;t a year or two. This he liked very well, only, he &s;aid, that he would by no means have me confined; that it would injure my health; and that I &s;hould then take a coun|try-hou&s;e in &s;ome village, a good way off of the city, where it &s;hould not be known who I was; and that he &s;hould be there &s;ometimes, to divert me.</P>
<P>I made no &s;cruple of the confinement; and told his Highne&s;s, no place could be a confinement,
<PB N="77" REF="91">
where I had &s;uch a vi&s;iter; and &s;o I put off the country-hou&s;e, which would have been to re|move my&s;elf farther from him, and have le&s;s of his company; and made the hou&s;e be, as it were, &s;hut up. Amy, indeed, appeared; and when any of the neighbours and &s;ervants enquired, &s;he an|&s;wered in broken French, that I was gone to Eng|land, to look after my affairs; which pre&s;ently went current through the &s;treets about us. For you are to ob&s;erve, that the people of Paris, e&s;pe|cially the women, are the mo&s;t bu&s;y and im|pertinent enquirers into the conduct of their neighbours, e&s;pecially that of a &s;ingle woman, that are in the world; though there are no greater intriguers in the univer&s;e than them|&s;elves; and perhaps that may be the rea&s;on of it; for it is an old but a &s;ure rule; that</P>

<P>Thus his Highne&s;s had the mo&s;t ea&s;y, and yet the mo&s;t undi&s;coverable acce&s;s to me imaginable; and he &s;eldom failed to come two or three nights in a week, and &s;ometimes &s;tayed two or three nights together. Once he told me, he was re|&s;olved I &s;hould be weary of his company, and that he would learn to know what it was to be a pri&s;oner; &s;o he gave out among his &s;ervants, that he was gone to one of his &s;eats, where he often went a hunting, and that he &s;hould not return under a fortnight; and that fortnight he &s;tayed wholly with me, and never went out of my doors.</P>

<P>To fini&s;h the felicity of this part, I mu&s;t not forget, that the Devil had played a new game with me, and prevailed with me to &s;atisfy my&s;elf with this amour, as a lawful thing; that a Prince of &s;uch grandeur, and maje&s;ty, &s;o infinitely &s;upe|rior to me, and one who had made &s;uch an intro|duction by an unparalelled bounty, I could not re|&s;i&s;t; and therefore, that it was very lawful for me to do it, being at that time perfectly &s;ingle, and unengaged to any other man; as I was, mo&s;t certainly, by the unaccountable ab&s;ence of Mr. Bacon, my hu&s;band, and the murder of Mr. Dazzle, who went for my &s;econd.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted but that I was the ea&s;ier to per&s;uade my&s;elf of the truth of &s;uch a doctrine as this, when it was &s;o much for my ea&s;e, and for the repo&s;e of my mind, to have it be &s;o.</P>
<Q><L>In things we wi&s;h, 'tis ea&s;y to deceive;</L>

<P>I &s;ay, I &s;atisfied my&s;elf with the &s;urpri&s;ing oc|ca&s;ion, that, as it was all irre&s;i&s;tible, &s;o it was all lawful; for that heaven would not &s;uffer us to be puni&s;hed for that which it was not po&s;&s;ible for us to avoid; and with the&s;e ab&s;urdities I kept con|&s;cience from giving me any con&s;iderable di&s;tur|bance in all this matter; and I was as perfectly ea&s;y as to the lawfulne&s;s of it, as if I had been mar|ried

to the Prince, and had had no other hu&s;band: &s;o po&s;&s;ible is it for us to toll our&s;elves up in wick|edne&s;s, till we grow invulnerable by con&s;cience: and that centinel once dozed, &s;leeps fa&s;t, not to be awakened while the tide of plea&s;ure continues to flow, or till &s;omething dark and dreadful brings us to our&s;elves again,</P>
<P>I have, I con&s;e&s;s, wondered at the &s;tupidity that my intellectual part was under all that while; what $ethargick fumes dozed the &s;oul; and how it was po&s;&s;ible that I, who in the ca&s;e before, where the temptation was many ways more forci|ble, and the arguments &s;tronger and more irre|&s;i&s;tible, was yet under a continued inquietude on account of the wicked life I led, could now live in the mo&s;t profound tranquility, and with an uninterrupted peace, nay, even ri&s;ing up to &s;a|tisfaction, and joy, and yet in a more palpable &s;tate of adultery than before; for before, Mr. Dazzle, who called me wife, had the pretence of his wi&s;e being parted from him, refu&s;ing to do the duty of her office as a wi&s;e to him: as for me, my circum&s;tances were the &s;ame; but as for the Prince, as he had a fine and extraordinary Lady, or Prince&s;s of his own; &s;o he had two or three mi&s;tre&s;&s;es more be&s;ides me, and made no &s;cruple of it, even to me.</P>
<P>However, I &s;ay, as to my own part, I enjoyed my&s;elf in perfect tranquility; and as the Prince was the only deity I wor&s;hipped, &s;o I was really his idol; and however it was with his Prince&s;s, I a&s;&s;ure you, his other mi&s;tre&s;&s;es found a &s;en&s;ible difference; and though they could never find me out, yet I had good intelligence that they gue&s;&s;ed very well, that their Lord had got &s;ome new favourite that robbed them of his company,
<PB N="80" REF="94">
and perhaps, of &s;ome of his u&s;ual bounty too. And now I mu&s;t mention the &s;acrifices he made to his idol; and they were not a few, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>As he loved like a Prince, &s;o he rewarded like a Prince; for though he declined my making a figure, he let me &s;ee, that he was above doing it for the &s;aving the expence of it, and &s;o he told me, and that he would make it up in other things: fir&s;t of all, he &s;ent me a toilet, with all the appurtenances, of &s;ilver, even &s;o much as the frame of the table; and then, for the hou&s;e, he gave me the table, or &s;ideboard of plate I men|tioned before, with all things belonging to it of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver; &s;o that, in &s;hort, I could not, for my life, &s;tudy to a&s;k him for any thing of plate which I had not.</P>
<P>He could then accommodate me in nothing more but jewels and cloaths, or money for cloaths. He &s;ent his Gentleman to the mercer's, and bought me a &s;uit of the fine&s;t brocaded &s;ilk, fi|gured with gold, and another with &s;ilver, and another of crim&s;on; &s;o that I had three &s;uits of cloaths, &s;uch as the Queen of France would not have di&s;dained to have worn, Yet I went out no|where; but as tho&s;e were for me to put on, when I went out of mourning, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in them, alternately, whenever his Highne&s;s came to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>I had no le&s;s than five &s;everal morning dre&s;&s;es be&s;ides the&s;e, &s;o that I need never be &s;een twice in the &s;ame dre&s;s; to the&s;e, he added &s;everal par|cels of fine linen, and of lace, that I had no room to a&s;k for more, or indeed for &s;o much.</P>
<P>I took the liberty once, in our freedoms, to tell him, he was too bountiful, and that I was
<PB N="81" REF="95">
too chargeable to him for a mi&s;tre&s;s, and that I would be his faithful &s;ervant, at le&s;s expence to him; and that he not only left me no room to a&s;k him for any thing, but that he &s;upplied me with &s;uch a profu&s;ion of good things, that I &s;carce could wear them, or u&s;e them; unle&s;s I kept a great equipage, which he knew was no way convenient for him, or for me. He &s;miled, and took me in his arms, and told me, he was re&s;olved, while I was his, I &s;hould never be able to a&s;k him for any thing; but that he would be daily a&s;king new favours of me.</P>
<P>After we were up, for this conference was in bed, he de&s;ired I would dre&s;s me in the be&s;t &s;uit of cloaths I had: it was a day or two after the three &s;uits were made, and brought home. I told him, if he plea&s;ed, I would rather dre&s;s me in that &s;uit which I knew he liked be&s;t. He a&s;ked me how I could know which he would like be&s;t, before he had &s;een them? I told him I would pre&s;ume, for once, to gue&s;s at his fancy by my own; &s;o I went and dre&s;&s;ed me in the &s;econd &s;uit, brocaded with &s;ilver, and returned in full dre&s;s, with a &s;uit of Bru&s;&s;el's lace, which would have been worth in England, two hundred pounds &s;terling; and I was every way &s;et out as well as Amy could dre&s;s me, who was a very genteel dre&s;&s;er: in this figure I came to him, out of my dre&s;&s;ing-room, which opened with folding-doors into his bed-chamber.</P>
<P>He &s;at as one a&s;toni&s;hed, a good-while, look|ing at me, without &s;peaking a word, till I came quite up to him, kneeled on one knee to him, and almo&s;t whether he would or no, ki&s;&s;ed his hand. He took me up, and &s;tood up him&s;elf; but was &s;urpri&s;ed, when, taking me in his arms, he

<P>It would look a little too much like a romance here, to repeat all the kind things he &s;aid to me on that occa&s;ion, but I cannot omit one pa&s;&s;age; as he &s;aw the tears drop down my cheeks, he pulled out a fine cambrick handkerchief, and was going to wipe the tears off, but checked his hand, as if he was afraid to deface &s;omething; I &s;ay, he checked his hand, and to&s;&s;ed the hand|kerchief to me to do it my&s;elf.

He appeared &s;urprized more than ever, and &s;wore, which was the fir&s;t time that I had heard him &s;wear from my fir&s;t knowing him, that he could not have believed there was any &s;uch &s;kin without paint in the world: 'Well, my Lord,' &s;aid I, <Q>&startq;your Highne&s;s &s;hall have a farther de|mon&s;tration than this; as to that which you are plea&s;ed to accept for beauty, that it is the&endq; meer work of Nature;'</Q> and with that I rung a bell for my woman Amy, and bade her bring me a cup full of hot water; and when it was come I de&s;ired his Highne&s;s to feel if it was warm, which he did; and I immediately wa&s;hed my face all over with it before him. This was, indeed, more than &s;atisfaction, that is to &s;ay, than believing, for it was an undeniable demon&s;tration; and he ki&s;&s;ed my cheeks and neck a thou&s;and times, with expre&s;&s;ions of the greate&s;t &s;urprize imaginable.</P>
<P>Nor was I an indifferent figure as to &s;hape, though I had had two children by Mr. Dazzle, and five by my hu&s;band. I &s;ay, I was no de&s;p$|eable &s;hape; and, as my Prince, I mu&s;t be allowed the vanity to call him &s;o, was taking his view of me, as I walked from one end of the room to the other; he at la&s;t leads me to the darke&s;t part of the room, and &s;tanding behind me, bade me hold up my head; when putting both his hands round my neck, as if he was &s;panning it, to &s;ee how &s;mall it was, for it was long and &s;mall, he held my neck &s;o hard in his hand, that I complained he hurt me a little; what he did it for I knew not, nor had I the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion but that he was &s;pan|ning my neck; but when I &s;aid he hurt me, he &s;eemed to let go, and in half a minute more led me to a pier-gla&s;s, and behold I &s;aw my neck

I did not take any notice of it to him, till I was &s;atisfied, that I was not deceived; when one morning early, when we were in bed together, I &s;aid to him, <Q>&startq;My Lord, I doubt your Highne&s;s never gives your&s;elf leave to think what the ca&s;e &s;hould be, if I &s;hould&endq; have the honour to be with child by you.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, my dear,' &s;aid he, 'we are able to keep it, if &s;uch a thing &s;hould happen; I hope you&endq; are not concerned about that.</Q></P>
<P>No, my Lord,' &s;aid I, <Q>&startq;I &s;hould think my&s;elf very happy, if I could bring your Highne&s;s a &s;on, I &s;hould hope to &s;ee him a lieutenant-general of the King's Armies, by the intere&s;t of his father,&endq; and by his own merit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, child,' &s;aid he, 'if it &s;hould be &s;o, I will not refu&s;e owning him for my &s;on, though it be, as they call it a natural &s;on; and &s;hall never &s;light or neglect him, for the &s;ake of&endq; his mother:</Q> Then he began to importune me, to know if it was &s;o; but I po&s;itively denied it &s;o long, till at la&s;t, I was able to give him the &s;atisfaction of knowing it him&s;elf, by the motion of the child within me.</P>
<P>He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf overjoyed at the di&s;covery, but told me, that now it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="88" REF="102">
for me to quit the confinement, which, he &s;aid, I had &s;uffered for his &s;ake, and to take a hou&s;e &s;omewhere in the country, in order for health, as well as for privacy, again&s;t my lying-in. This was quite out of my way; but the Prince, who was a man of plea&s;ure, had, it &s;eems, &s;everal re|treats of this kind, which he had made u&s;e of, I &s;uppo&s;e, upon like occa&s;ions; and &s;o leaving it, as it were, to his gentleman, he provided a very convenient hou&s;e, about four miles &s;outh of Paris, at the village of Bray, where I had very agree|able lodgings, good gardens, and all things very ea&s;y to my content; but one thing did not plea&s;e me at all, viz. that an old woman was provided, and put into the hou&s;e, to furni&s;h every thing nece&s;&s;ary to my lying-inn, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t me at my travail.</P>
<P>I did not like this old woman; &s;he looked &s;o like a &s;py upon me, or, as &s;ometimes I was frighted to imagine, like one &s;et privately to di&s;patch me out of the world, as might be&s;t &s;uit with the cir|cum&s;tance of my lying-in; and when his High|ne&s;s came the next time to &s;ee me, which was not many days, I expo&s;tulated a little on the &s;ubject of the old woman; and by the management of my tongue, as well as by the &s;trength of rea&s;oning, I convinced him, that it would not be at all con|venient; that it would be the greate&s;t ri&s;que on his &s;ide; and that fir&s;t or la&s;t it would certainly expo&s;e him and me al&s;o. I a&s;&s;ured him, that my &s;ervant being an Engli&s;h woman, never knew to that hour who his Highne&s;s was; that I always called him the Count de Clerac; and that &s;he knew nothing el&s;e of him, nor ever &s;hould; that if he would give me leave to choo&s;e proper per&s;ons for my u&s;e, it &s;hould be &s;o ordered, that not one
<PB N="89" REF="103">
of them &s;hould know who he was, or perhaps ever &s;ee his face; and that for the reality of the child that &s;hould be born, his Highne&s;s who had alone been at the fir&s;t of it &s;hould, if he plea&s;ed, be pre&s;ent in the room at the time, &s;o that he would need no witne&s;&s;es on that account.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e fully &s;atisfied him, &s;o that he ordered his gentleman to di&s;mi&s;s the old woman, and to get me another, which was accordingly done; and I was very ea&s;y when &s;he came, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e &s;he brought with the mid|wife a good motherly &s;ort of a woman, who was to be her a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and would be very helpful on occa&s;ion; and be&s;poke a man-midwife at Paris too, if there &s;hould be any nece&s;&s;ity for his help. Having thus made provi&s;ion for every thing, the Count, for &s;o we all called him in public, came as often to &s;ee me as I could expect, and con|tinued exceeding kind as he had always been. One day conver&s;ing together upon the &s;ubject of my being with child, I told him how all things were in order, but that I had a &s;trange appre|hen&s;ion that I &s;hould die with that child. He &s;miled.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;So all the ladies &s;ay, my dear,' &s;aid he, when they are with child. 'Well, however, my Lord,' &s;aid I, 'it is but ju&s;t that care &s;hould be taken, that what you have be&s;towed in your&endq; exce&s;s of bounty upon me &s;hould not be lo&s;t;'</Q> and upon this I pulled a paper out of my bo&s;om folded up but not &s;ealed, and I read it to him; wherein I had left order, that all the plate and jewels, and fine furniture, which his Highne&s;s had given me, &s;hould be re&s;tored to him by my woman, and the keys be immediately delivered to his gen|tleman, in ca&s;e of di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="104">
Then I recommended my woman Amy to his favour, on condition &s;he gave the keys up, as above, to his gentleman, and his gentleman's re|ceipt for the &s;ame. When he &s;aw this, <Q>&startq;My dear child,' &s;aid he, 'and took me in his arms, what, have you been making your will, and di&s;po&s;ing of your effects.&endq; Pray who do you make your he$r.</Q></P>
<P>So far as to do ju&s;tice to your Highne&s;s, <Q>&startq;in ca&s;e of mortality, I have my Lord,' &s;aid I, and who &s;hould I di&s;po&s;e the valuable things to, which I have had from your hand, as pledges of your favour, and te&s;timonies of your bounty, but to the giver of them? If the child &s;hould live, your Highne&s;s will, I do not que&s;tion, act like your&s;elf in that part, and I &s;hall have the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction, that it will be well u&s;ed by your direction.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I could &s;ee he took this very well: <Q>&startq;I have for|&s;aken all the ladies in Paris,' &s;aid he, 'for you; and I have ob&s;erved every day &s;ince I knew you, that you know how to merit all that a man of honour can do for you: Be ea&s;y, child, I hope you will not die; and all you have is your own, to do with it as you plea&s;e.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I was then within two months of my reckon|ing; and when I found my time was come, it fell out very happily that he was in the hou&s;e, and I entreated he would continue in it till it was over, which he agreed to. They called his Highne&s;s to come into the room, if he plea&s;ed, as I had of|fered, and as I de&s;ired him, and I &s;ent word I would make as few complaints as po&s;&s;ible, to pre|vent di&s;turbing him. He came into the room once, and called to me to be of good courage, it would &s;oon be over. And then he withdrew again; and in about half an hour more, Amy carried him the
<PB N="91" REF="105">
news that I was delivered, and had brought him a charming boy. He gave her ten pi&s;toles for her news, &s;tayed till they had adju&s;ted things about me, and then came into the room again; cheared me and &s;poke kindly to me, and looked on the child, then ki&s;&s;ed me and withdrew; and came again the next day to vi&s;it me.</P>
<P>Since this, and when I have looked back upon the&s;e things with eyes unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with crime, when the wicked part has appeared in its clearer light, and I have &s;een it in its own natural colours; when no more blinded with the glittering appear|ances, which at that time deluded me, and as in like ca&s;es, if I may gue&s;s at others by my&s;elf, too much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mind; I &s;ay, &s;ince this, I have often wondered with what plea&s;ure or &s;atisfaction the prince could look upon the poor innocent infant; which though his own, and that he might that way have &s;ome attachment in his affections to it, yet mu&s;t always afterwards be a remem|brancer to him of his mo&s;t early crime; and which was wor&s;e, mu&s;t bear upon it&s;elf, unmerit|ed, an eternal mark of infamy, which &s;hould be &s;poken of upon all occa&s;ions to its reproach, from the folly of its father, and wickedne&s;s of its mother.</P>
<P>Great men are, indeed, delivered from the burthen of their natural children, as to their maintenance. This is the main affliction in other ca&s;es, where there is not &s;ub&s;tance &s;ufficient, without breaking into the fortunes of the family; in tho&s;e ca&s;es, either a man's legi|timate children &s;uffer, which is very unnatural; or the unfortunate mother of that illegitimate birth has a dreadful affliction, either of being turned off with her child, and be left to &s;tarve, or of &s;eeing the poor infant packed off with a piece
<PB N="92" REF="106">
of money, to &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;he-butchers, who take children off of their hands, as it is called; that is to &s;ay, &s;tarve them, and in a word, murder them.</P>
<P>Great men, I &s;ay, are delivered from this bur|then, becau&s;e they are always furni&s;hed to &s;upply the expence of their out-of-the-way offspring, by making little a&s;&s;ignments upon the bank of Lyons, or the town-hou&s;e of Paris, and &s;ettling tho&s;e &s;ums, to be received for the maintenance of &s;uch expence as they &s;ee cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, in the ca&s;e of this child of mine, while he and I conver&s;ed, there was no need to make any appointment, as an appennage, or maintenance for the child, or its nur&s;e; for he &s;upplied me more than &s;ufficiently for all tho&s;e things; but afterward, when time, and a particular circum|&s;tance, put an end to our conver&s;ing together; as &s;uch things always meet with a period, and gene|rally break off abruptly; I &s;ay, after that, I found he appointed the children a &s;ettled allowance, by an a&s;&s;ignment of annual rent, upon the bank of Lyons, which was &s;ufficient for bringing them hand&s;omely, though privately, up in the world; and that not in a manner unworthy of their father's blood, though I might be &s;unk and for|gotten in the ca&s;e; nor did the children ever know any thing of their mother to this day, other, than as you may have an account hereafter.</P>
<P>But to look back to the particular ob&s;ervation I was making, which, I hope may be of u&s;e to tho&s;e who read my &s;tory; I &s;ay, it was &s;omething wonderful to me to &s;ee this per&s;on &s;o exceedingly delighted at the birth of this child, and to plea&s;ed with it; for he would &s;it and look at it, and with an air of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s &s;ometimes, a great while to|gether;
<PB N="93" REF="107">
and particularly, I ob&s;erved, he loved to look at it when it was a&s;leep.</P>
<P>It was, indeed, a lovely, charming child, and had a certain vivacity in its countenance, that is far from being common to all children &s;o young; and he would often &s;ay to me, that he be|lieved there was &s;omething extraordinary in the child, and he did not doubt, if he lived, but he would come to be a great man.</P>
<P>I could not hear him &s;ay &s;o, but though &s;ecretly it plea&s;ed me, yet it &s;o clo&s;ely touched me another way, that I could not refrain &s;ighing, and &s;ome|times tears; and one time in particular, it &s;o affected me, that I could not conceal it from him; but when he &s;aw tears run down my face, there was no concealing the occa&s;ion from him; he was too importunate to be denied in a thing of that moment; &s;o I frankly an&s;wered, <Q>&startq;It &s;en&s;ibly affects me, my Lord,' &s;aid I; 'that whatever the merit of this little creature may be, he mu&s;t always have a bend on his arms; the di&s;a&s;ter of his birth will be always, not only a blot to his honour, but a bar to his fortunes in the world; our affection will be ever his affliction, and his mother's crime be the &s;on's reproach; the blot can never be wiped out by the mo&s;t glorious actions; nay, if he lives to rai&s;e a family, the infamy mu&s;t de&s;cend even to his in|nocent po&s;terity.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>He took the thought, and told me afterwards, that it made a deeper impre&s;&s;ion on him than he di&s;covered to me at that time; but for the pre&s;ent, he put it off, with telling me, the&s;e things could not be helped; that they &s;erved for a &s;pur to the &s;pirits of brave men; in&s;pired them with prin|ciples of gallantry; and prompted them to brave
<PB N="94" REF="108">
actions; that though it might be true, that the mention of illegitimacy might attend the name, yet that per&s;onal virtue placed a man of honour a|bove the reproach of his birth; that as he had no &s;hare in the offence, he would have no concern at the blot; when having by his own merit placed him&s;elf out of the reach of &s;candal, his fame &s;hould drown the memory of his beginning.</P>
<P>That is was u&s;ual for men of quality to make &s;uch little e&s;capes, &s;o the number of their natu|ral children were &s;o great, that they generally took &s;uch good care of their education, that &s;ome of the greate&s;t men in the world had a bend in their coats of arms, and that it was of no con&s;equence to them, e&s;pecially when their fame began to ri&s;e upon the ba&s;is of their acquired merit; and upon this, he began to reckon up to me &s;ome of the greate&s;t families in France, and in England al&s;o.</P>
<P>This carried off our di&s;cour&s;e for a time; but I went farther with him once; removing the di&s;cour&s;e from the part attending our children, to the reproach which tho&s;e children would be apt to throw upon us, their originals; and when &s;peaking a little too feelingly on the &s;ubject, he began to receive the impre&s;&s;ion a little deeper than I wi&s;hed he had done; at la&s;t he told me, I had almo&s;t acted the confe&s;&s;or to him; that I might, perhaps, preach a more dangerous doctrine to him, than we &s;hould either of us like, or than I was aware of: <Q>&startq;For, my dear,' &s;ays he; 'if once we come to talk of repentance, we mu&s;t talk of parting.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>If tears were in my eyes before, they flowed too fa&s;t now to be re&s;trained; and I gave him but too much &s;atisfaction in my looks, that I had
<PB N="95" REF="109">
yet no reflections upon my mind &s;trong enough to go that length, and that I could no more think of parting, than he could.</P>
<P>He &s;aid a great many kind things, which were great, like him&s;elf, and extenuating our crime, intimated to me, that he could no more part with me, than I could with him; &s;o we both, as I may &s;ay, even again&s;t our light, and again&s;t our conviction, concluded to &s;in on: indeed, his affec|tion to the child, was one great tie to him, for he was extremely fond of it.</P>
<P>I think I may &s;ay now, that I lived indeed like a Queen; for no woman was ever more valued, or more care&s;&s;ed by a per&s;on of &s;uch quality, only in the &s;tation of a mi&s;tre&s;s. I had, indeed, one deficiency, which women in &s;uch circum&s;tances &s;eldom are chargeable with; namely, I craved no|thing of him; I never a&s;ked him for any thing in my life; nor &s;uffered my&s;elf to be made u&s;e of, as is too much the cu&s;tom of mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, to a&s;k fa|vours for others: his bounty always prevented me in the fir&s;t, and my &s;trict concealing my&s;elf, in the la&s;t; which was no le&s;s to my convenience, than his.</P>
<P>The only favour I ever a&s;ked of him, was, for his Gentleman, who he had all along intru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of our amour, and who had once &s;o much offended him, that he found it very hard to make his peace; he came and laid his ca&s;e be|fore Amy, and begged her to &s;peak to me, to inter|cede for him; which I did, and on my account, he was pardoned; for which, the fellow requited me, by getting to-bed to his benefactre&s;s, at which I was very angry; but Amy generou&s;ly acknow|ledged, that it was her fault as much as his; and that &s;he loved the fellow; I &s;ay, this pacified me,
<PB N="96" REF="110">
and I only obtained of her, that &s;he &s;hould not let him know, that I knew it.</P>
<P>I enquired of Amy, upon what terms they came to be &s;o intimate; but Amy &s;eemed backward to explain her&s;elf; till after &s;ome time, &s;he told it me all freely, of her own accord, which amounted to this; as they had many lei&s;ure hours, while they waited re&s;pectively, when his Lord and I were to|gether; he could hardly avoid the u&s;ual que&s;tion, why might not they do the &s;ame below, that we did above?</P>
<P>It happened one day, that the Prince had a mind to give me &s;ome diver&s;ion, and to take the air with me; but that he might do it, and not be publickly known, and that I might be the more effectually concealed, he ordered me to be taken up at a mantua-maker's hou&s;e, where he &s;ometimes came, whether upon other amours, or not, was no bu&s;i|ne&s;s of mine to enquire. I knew nothing whither he intended to carry me; but when he was in the coach with me, he told me, he would &s;hew me &s;ome of the beau monde: I told him, I cared not where I went, while I had the honour to have him with me. So he carried me to the fine palace of Meudon.</P>
<P>While I was there, the King happened to come thither from Ver&s;ailles, and making but a &s;hort &s;tay, vi&s;ited Madam the Dauphine&s;s. The Prince was here incog. only becau&s;e of his being with me; and therefore, when he heard that the King was in the gardens, he kept clo&s;e within the lodgings; but the Gentleman, in who&s;e lodgings we were, with his Lady, and &s;everal others, went out to &s;ee the King, and I had the honour to be a&s;ked to go with them.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="111">
After we had &s;een the King, who did not &s;tay long in the gardens, we walked up the broad terrace, and cro&s;&s;ing the hall, towards the great &s;tair-ca&s;e, I had a &s;ight which confounded me, as, I doubt not, it would have done any woman in the world. The hor&s;e-guards, or what they call there the Gens de arms, had upon &s;ome occa&s;ion been either upon duty, or reviewed, or &s;omething was the matter, that occa&s;ioned their being there, I know not what; but walking in the guard|chamber, and with his jack-boots on, and the whole habit of the troop; I &s;ay, there, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible confu&s;ion, I &s;aw Mr. Bacon, my hu&s;|band, the brewer.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed &s;o near him, that I almo&s;t touched him with my cloaths, and looked him full in the face, but having my fan before mine, &s;o that he could not know me: however, I knew him perfectly well, and I heard him &s;peak, which was a &s;econd way of knowing him; be&s;ides, I turned about af|ter I had pa&s;&s;ed him &s;ome &s;teps, and pretending to a&s;k the Lady who was with me &s;ome que&s;tions, I &s;tood as if I had viewed the great-hall, the outer guard-chamber, and &s;ome other things; but I did it, to take a full view of his dre&s;s, that I might farther inform my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked the Lady; 'Pray Madam, what are the&s;e troopers? are they the King's guards?'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;No,' &s;ays &s;he, 'they are the Gens de arms; a &s;mall detachment of them, I &s;uppo&s;e, attend|ed the King to-day, but they are not his Ma|je&s;ty's&endq; ordinary guard.'</Q> Another Lady that was with her, &s;aid, <Q>&startq;No, Madam, it &s;eems that is not the ca&s;e; for I heard them &s;aying, the Gens de arms were here to-day by &s;pecial order,

&s;ome of them being to march towards the Rhine, and the&s;e to attend for orders; but they go back to-morrow to Orleans, where they are expected.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This &s;atisfied me in part, but I found means after this, to enquire who&s;e particular troop it was that the Gentlemen that were here belonged to; and with that, I heard they would all be at Paris the week after.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>An Incident di&s;agreeable to mo&s;t Wives.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TWO days after this, we returned for Paris, when I took occa&s;ion to &s;peak to my Lord, that I heard the Gens de arms were to be in the city the next week, and that I &s;hould like to &s;ee them march, if they came in a body. He was &s;o obliging, that I need not but ju&s;t name a thing, and it was done; &s;o he ordered his Gentleman to get me a place in a certain hou&s;e, where I might &s;ee them march.</P>
<P>As he did not appear with me on this occa|&s;ion, &s;o I had the liberty of taking Amy with me; and &s;tood where we were very well ac|commodated for the ob&s;ervation I was to make. I told Amy what I had &s;een, and &s;he was as forward to make the di&s;covery, as I was to have her, and almo&s;t as much &s;urprized at the thing it&s;elf; in a word the Gens de arms entered the city, as was expected, and made a mo&s;t glorious &s;how indeed, being new-cloathed and armed, and being to have their &s;tandards ble&s;&s;ed by the Arch|bi&s;hop of Paris. On this occa&s;ion, they indeed looked very gay; and as they marched very lei&s;ure|ly, I had time to take as critical a view, and
<PB N="99" REF="113">
make as nice a &s;earch among them as I plea&s;ed. Here, in a particular rank, I &s;aw my hu&s;band a|gain, and a very hand&s;ome jolly fellow he was, as any in the troop.</P>
<P>Amy, who thought &s;he might, on many ac|counts, venture with more &s;afety to be particular, than I could, a&s;ked her Gentleman, how a par|ticular man, who &s;he &s;aw there, among the Gens de arms, might be enquired after, and found out; &s;he having &s;een an Engli&s;hman riding there, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead in England for &s;everal years before &s;he came out of London, and that his wife had married again. It was a que&s;tion the Gentleman did not well under&s;tand how to an|&s;wer; but another per&s;on, that &s;tood by, told her, if &s;he would tell him the Gentleman's name, he would endeavour to find him out for her, and a&s;ked je&s;tingly, if he was her lover? Amy put that off with a laugh, but &s;till continued her enquiry, and in &s;uch a manner, as the Gentleman ea&s;i|ly perceived &s;he was in earne&s;t; &s;o he left ban|tering, and a&s;ked her in what part of the troop he rode; &s;he fooli&s;hly told him his name, which &s;he &s;hould not have done; and pointing to the cornet that troop carried, which was not then quite out of &s;ight, &s;he let him ea&s;ily know where|abouts he rode, only &s;he could not name the Cap|tain; however, he gave her &s;uch directions af|terwards, that, in &s;hort, Amy, who was an inde|fatigable girl, found him out; it &s;eems he had not changed his name, not &s;uppo&s;ing any enquiry would be made after him here; but, I &s;ay, Amy found him out, and went boldly to his quarters, a&s;ked for him, and he came out to her immedi|ately.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="114">
I believe I was not more confounded at my fir&s;t &s;eeing him at Meudon, than he was at &s;eeing Amy; he &s;tarted and turned pale, and a&s;ked in Engli&s;h, with an admiration, 'What are you!'</P>
<P>Sir!' &s;aid &s;he, 'do not you know me?'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Yes,' &s;ays he, 'I knew you when you were alive, but what you are now, whether gho&s;t or&endq; &s;ub&s;tance, I know not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Be not afraid Sir, of that. I am the &s;ame Amy that was in your &s;ervice, and do not &s;peak to you now for any hurt, but that I &s;aw you acciden|tally ye&s;terday ride among the troopers. I thought you might be glad to hear from your&endq; friends in London.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;My mi&s;tre&s;s, Sir, alas! not the mi&s;tre&s;s you mean. Poor gentlewoman, you left her in a &s;ad&endq; condition.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;I believe &s;o, Sir, or el&s;e you had not gone away as you did; for it was a very terrible con|dition&endq; you left them all in, that I mu&s;t &s;ay.</Q></P>
<P>'What did they do after I was gone?'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Do, Sir! very mi&s;erably, you may be &s;ure;&endq; how could it be otherwi&s;e?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, that is true indeed; but you may tell me, Amy, what became of them; for though I went away, it was not becau&s;e I did not love them, but becau&s;e I could not bear to &s;ee the poverty that was coming upon them, and which&endq; was not in my power to help; what could I do?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Nay, I believe &s;o indeed, and I have heard my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ay many times &s;he did not doubt
<PB N="101" REF="115">
but your affliction was as great as her's almo&s;t, wherever you were.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'Why, did &s;he believe I was alive then?'.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Yes, Sir, &s;he always &s;aid &s;he believed you were alive; becau&s;e &s;he thought &s;he &s;hould have heard &s;omething of you, if you had been dead.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Aye, aye, my perplexity was very great, indeed, or el&s;e I had never gone away.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It was very cruel though, Sir; &s;he almo&s;t broke her heart for you at fir&s;t, for &s;ear of what might befall you, and at la&s;t, becau&s;e &s;he could not hear from you.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Alas, Amy! what could I do? things were driven to the la&s;t extremity before I went. I could have done nothing but help to have &s;tarved them all, if I had &s;tayed; and be&s;ides, I could not bear to &s;ee it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;You know, Sir, I can &s;ay little to what pa&s;&s;ed before, but I am a melancholy witne&s;s to the &s;ad di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my poor mi&s;tre&s;s, as long as I &s;tayed with her, and which would grieve your heart too, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here &s;he tells my whole &s;tory, to the time that the pari&s;h took off one of my children, and which &s;he perceived very much affected him; and he &s;hook his head, and &s;aid &s;ome things very bitter, when he heard of the cruelty of his own relations to me.</NOTE> to hear them.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, Amy, I have heard enough &s;o far; what did &s;he do afterwards?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I cannot give you any farther account, Sir. My mi&s;tre&s;s would not let me &s;tay with her any longer; &s;he could neither pay me, or &s;ub&s;i&s;t me. I told her I would &s;erve her without any wages, but I could not live without victuals; &s;o I was forced to leave her, &s;ore again&s;t my will; and I&endq; heard afterwards, that &s;he had been &s;een in the
<PB N="102" REF="116">
city very &s;habby, and poor in cloaths; and it was thought &s;he worked with her needle for her bread.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>All this the jade &s;aid with &s;o much cunning, and managed it &s;o well, and wiped her eyes, and cried &s;o artificially, that he took it all as it was intend|ed he &s;hould, and &s;he &s;aw tears in his eyes too. He told her it was a moving melancholy &s;tory, and it had almo&s;t broke his heart at fir&s;t; but that he was driven to the la&s;t extremity, and could do nothing but &s;tay and &s;ee them all &s;tarve, which he could not bear the thoughts of; that he left his wife all the money he had, but 25l. which was as little as he could take with him, to &s;eek his for|tune in the world. He could not doubt but that his relations, &s;eeing they were all rich, would have taken the poor children, and not let them come to the pari&s;h; and that his wife was young and hand|&s;ome; and he thought might marry again to her advantage, and for that very rea&s;on he never wrote to her, or let her know he was alive, that &s;he might, in a rea&s;onable term of $ears marry, and perhaps mend her fortune: That he re&s;olved never to claim her, becau&s;e he &s;hould rejoice to hear that &s;he had &s;ettled to her mind.</P>
<P>Amy &s;aid &s;he could &s;ay nothing to that; but this, that &s;he was &s;atisfied her mi&s;tre&s;s would marry no-body, unle&s;s &s;he had certain intelligence that he had been dead, from &s;omebody that &s;aw him buried; <Q>&startq;But alas!' &s;ays Amy, 'my mi&s;tre&s;s was reduced to &s;uch di&s;mal circum&s;tances, that nobody would be &s;o fooli&s;h as to think of her, unle&s;s it had been &s;omebody to go a-begging with her.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Amy then &s;eeing him &s;o perfectly deluded, made a long and lamentable outcry, how &s;he her&s;elf
<PB N="103" REF="117">
had been deluded away, to marry a poor footman; <Q>&startq;for he is no better,' &s;ays &s;he, 'though&endq; he calls him&s;elf a lord's gentleman;'</Q> and here, &s;ays Amy, 'he has dragged me over into a &s;trange country, to make a begger of me;' and then &s;he falls a crying again; which by the way, was all hypocri&s;y, but &s;o as perfectly deceived him, and he gave entire credit to every word of it.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, Amy,' &s;aid he, 'you are very well dre&s;&s;ed, you do not look as if you were in dan|ger of being a beggar.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Aye, hang him,' &s;ays Amy, 'they love to have fine cloaths here, if they have never a &s;mock under them; be&s;ides, Sir, mo&s;t of the cloaths I have, were given me in the la&s;t place I had, when I went away from my mi&s;tre&s;s.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole of the di&s;cour&s;e, Amy got out of him what condition he was in, and how he lived, upon her promi&s;e to him, that if ever &s;he came to England, and &s;hould &s;ee her old mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;hould not let her know that he was alive.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Alas! Sir, I may never come to &s;ee England again as long as I live; and if I &s;hould, it would be ten thou&s;and to one, whether I &s;hall &s;ee my mi&s;tre&s;s; for how &s;hould I know which way to look for her? or what part of England &s;he may be in; not I, I do not &s;o much as know how to enquire for her; and if I &s;hould ever be &s;o happy as to &s;ee her, I would not do her &s;o much mi&s;chief, as to tell her where you were, Sir, unle&s;s &s;he was in a condition to help her|&s;elf&endq; and you too.</Q></P>
<P>This farther deluded him, and made him en|tirely open in his conver&s;ation with her. As to his own circum&s;tances, he told her &s;he &s;aw him in the highe&s;t preferment he had arrived to, of
<PB N="104" REF="118">
was ever like to arrive to: For having no friends or acquaintance in France, and which was wor&s;e, no money, he never expected to ri&s;e; that he could have been made a lieutenant to a troop of light-hor&s;e but the week before, by the favour of an officer in the Gens d' arms, who was his friend; but that he mu&s;t have found eight thou|&s;and livres to have paid for it, to the gentleman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and had leave given him to &s;ell: &startq;<Q>But where could I get eight thou&s;and livres, that have never been ma&s;ter of five hundred livres, at a time, &s;ince I came into France?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;O dear, Sir, I am very &s;orry to hear you &s;ay &s;o; I fancy if you once got up to &s;ome prefer|ment, you would think of my mi&s;tre&s;s again, and do &s;omething for her; poor woman &s;he wants it to be &s;ure,'</Q> and then &s;he falls a-crying again; &startq;<Q>it is a &s;ad thing indeed,' &s;ays &s;he, 'that you &s;hould be &s;o hard put to it, when you had got a friend to recommend you, and &s;hould lo&s;e it for want of money;'&mdash;'Aye, &s;o it was, Amy, indeed, but what can a &s;tranger do that has no money or friends?' Here Amy puts in again, well,' &s;ays &s;he, 'my poor mi&s;tre&s;s has had the lo&s;s, though &s;he knows nothing of it. O dear! how happy it would have been, to be &s;ure, Sir,&endq; you would have helped her all you could.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Aye, Amy, &s;o I would with all my heart; and even as I am, I would &s;end her &s;ome relief, only that the letting her know I was alive, might do her &s;ome prejudice, in ca&s;e of her &s;et|tling, or marrying any-body.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Alas!' &s;ays Amy, 'marry!' who will marry&endq; her, in the poor condition &s;he is in?' And &s;o their di&s;cour&s;e ended for that time.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="119">
All this was meer talk on both &s;ides, and words of cour&s;e; for on farther enquiry, Amy found that he had no &s;uch offer of a lieutenant's com|mi&s;&s;ion, or any thing like it.</P>
<P>I was once thinking to have &s;ent him the eight thou&s;and livres, to purcha&s;e the commi&s;&s;ion he had &s;poken of. But Amy &s;oon came to a better under|&s;tanding of him; for &s;he pre&s;ently learned that he had a mo&s;t abandoned character; that he was a meer &s;harper; one that would &s;tick at nothing to get money, and that there was no depending on any thing he &s;aid; they told her he had often made u&s;e of pretences to borrow money, and move gentlemen to pity him, in hopes to get him pre|ferment; that he had reported that he had a wife and five children in England, who he maintained out of his pay; and by the&s;e &s;hifts had run into debt in &s;everal places; and upon &s;everal complaints for &s;uch things, he had been threatened to be turned out of the Gens d' Arms; and that, in &s;hort, he was not to be believed in any thing he &s;aid, or tru&s;ted on any account.</P>
<P>Upon this information, Amy began to cool in her farther meddling with him; and told me, it was not &s;afe for me to attempt doing him any good, unle&s;s I re&s;olved to put him upon &s;u&s;picions and enquiries, which might be to my ruin, in the condition I was now in.</P>
<P>I was &s;oon confirmed in this part of his cha|racter; for the next time that Amy came to talk with him, he di&s;covered him&s;elf more effectually; for while &s;he had put him in hopes of procuring one to advance the money for the lieutenant's com|mi&s;&s;ion for him, upon ea&s;y conditions; he, by degrees, dropt the di&s;cour&s;e, then pretended it was too late, and that he could not get it; and then
<PB N="106" REF="120">
de&s;cended to a&s;k Amy to lend him five hundred pi&s;toles.</P>
<P>Amy pretended poverty; that her circum&s;tances were but mean; and that &s;he could not rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;um; and this &s;he did to try him to the utmo&s;t. He de&s;cended to three hundred, then to one hun|dred, then to fifty, and then to a &s;ingle pi&s;tole, which &s;he lent him, and he never intending to pay it, played out of her &s;ight as much as he could: and thus being &s;atisfied that he was the &s;ame worthle&s;s thing he had ever been, I threw off all thoughts of him; whereas, had he been a man of any &s;en&s;e, and of any principle of honour, I would have lived hone&s;tly with him: but as a fool is the wor&s;t of hu&s;bands to do a woman good, &s;o a fool is the wor&s;t hu&s;band a woman can do good to. All that I had now to do, was to keep out of his &s;ight, which was not very difficult to me, con&s;idering in what &s;tation he lived.</P>
<P>The journal of his life, for one week, which I had &s;ent me, was the lea&s;t &s;ignificant of any thing of its kind, that was ever &s;een; as it had really nothing of earne&s;t in it, &s;o it would make no je&s;t, to relate it; it was not important enough, &s;o much as to make the reader merry withal; and for that rea&s;on I omit it.</P>
<P>Yet this nothing-doing wretch was I obliged to watch and guard again&s;t, as again&s;t the only thing that was capable of doing me hurt in the world. I was to &s;hun him, as we would &s;hun a &s;pectre, or even the Devil, if he was actually in our way. Though this life he led, &s;ometimes moved me to pity him; yet, at the &s;ame time, it gave me mo&s;t contemptible thoughts of him, and made me often &s;ay, I was a warning for all the Ladies of Europe, again&s;t marrying of fools; a man of
<PB N="107" REF="121">
&s;en&s;e fails in the world, and gets up again, and a woman has &s;ome chance for her&s;elf; but with a fool! once fall, and ever undone; once poor, and &s;ure to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>But it is time to have done with him. Once I had nothing to hope for, but to &s;ee him again; now my only felicity was, if po&s;&s;ible, never to &s;ee him, and, I above all, to keep him from &s;eeing me; which, as above, I took effectual care of.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>A Tour to Italy, and back again.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Was now returned to Paris. My little &s;on of honour, as I called him, was left where my la&s;t country &s;eat then was, and I came to Paris, at the Prince's reque&s;t; thither he came to me as &s;oon as I arrived, and told me, he came to give me joy of my return, and to make his acknow|ledgments, for that I had given him a &s;on. I thought indeed, he had been going to give me a pre&s;ent, and &s;o he did the next day; but in what he &s;aid then, he only je&s;ted with me. He gave me his company all the evening; &s;upped with me about midnight, and telling me in je&s;t, that the be&s;t thanks for a &s;on born, was giving the pledge for another.</P>
<P>But as I hinted, &s;o it was: the next morning he laid down, on my toilet, a pur&s;e with three hundred pi&s;toles. I &s;aw him lay it down, and un|der&s;tood what he meant. But I took no notice of it, till I came to it, as it were ca&s;ually; then I gave a great cry-out, and fell a &s;colding in my way; for he gave me all po&s;&s;ible freedom of &s;peech, on &s;uch occa&s;ions. I told him, he was unkind; that
<PB N="108" REF="122">
he would never give me an opportunity to a&s;k him for any thing; and that he forced me to blu&s;h, by being too much obliged; all which I knew was very agreeable to him: for as he was bountiful, be|yond mea&s;ure, &s;o he was infinitely obliged by my being &s;o backward to a&s;k any favours; and I was even with him, for I never a&s;ked him for any mo|ney in my life.</P>
<P>Upon this rallying him, he told me, I had ei|ther perfectly &s;tudied the art of humour, or el&s;e, what was the greate&s;t difficulty to others, was natural to me; adding, that nothing could be more obliging to a man of honour, than not to be &s;oliciting and craving.</P>
<P>I told him, nothing could be craving upon him; that he left no room for it; that I hoped he did not give, merely to avoid the trouble of being im|portuned. I told him, he might depend upon it, that I &s;hould be reduced very low indeed, before I offered to di&s;turb him that way.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, a man of honour ought always to know what he ought to do; and as he did nothing but what he knew was rea&s;onable, he gave me leave to be free with him, if I wanted any thing; that he had too much value for me, to deny me any thing, if I a&s;ked; but that it was infinitely agree|able to him to hear me &s;ay, that what he did, was to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>We &s;trained compliments thus a great while, and as he had me in his arms mo&s;t part of the time, &s;o upon all my expre&s;&s;ions of his bounty to me, he put a &s;top to me with his ki&s;&s;es, and would admit me to go on no farther.</P>
<P>I &s;hould in this place mention, that this Prince was not a &s;ubject of France, though at that time
<PB N="109" REF="123">
he re&s;ided at Paris, and was much at Court, where, I &s;uppo&s;e, he had, or expected, &s;ome con&s;iderable em|ployment: but I mention it on this account; that a few days after this, he came to me, and told me, he was come to bring me not the mo&s;t welcome news that ever I heard from him in his life. I looked at him, a little &s;urprized; but he returned, <Q>&startq;Do not be unea&s;y, it is as unplea&s;ant to me, as to you; but I come to con&s;ult with you a|bout it, and &s;ee, if it cannot be made a little ea&s;y to us both.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I &s;eemed &s;till more concerned and &s;urprized. At la&s;t he &s;aid, it was, that he believed he &s;hould be obliged to go into Italy; which though otherwi&s;e it was very agreeable to him, yet his parting with me, made it very dull but to think of.</P>
<P>I &s;at mute, as one thunder-&s;truck, for a good|while; and it pre&s;ently occurred to me, that I was going to lo&s;e him, which, indeed, I could but ill bear the thoughts of; and, as he told me, I turned pale. 'What is the matter?' &s;aid he ha&s;tily; 'I have &s;urprized you, indeed;' and &s;tepping to the &s;ide-board, fills a gla&s;s of cordial-water, and comes to me. 'Be not &s;urprized,' &s;aid he; 'I will go no-where without you:' adding &s;e|veral other things &s;o kind, as nothing could ex|ceed it.</P>
<P>I might, indeed, turn pale, for I was very much &s;urprized at fir&s;t, believing that this was, as is often happens in &s;uch ca&s;es, only a project to drop me, and break off an amour, which he had now carried on &s;o long; and a thou|&s;and thoughts whirled about my head in the few moments while I was kept in &s;u&s;pence; I &s;ay, I was indeed, &s;urprized, and might, perhaps, look
<PB N="110" REF="124">
pale; but I was not in any danger of fainting, that I knew of.</P>
<P>However, it not a little plea&s;ed me, to &s;ee him &s;o concerned and anxious about me; but I &s;topped a little, when he put the cordial to my mouth, and taking the gla&s;s in my hand, I &s;aid, <Q>&startq;My Lord, your words are infinitely more of a cordial to me, than this citron; for as nothing can be a greater affliction, than to lo&s;e you, &s;o nothing can be a greater &s;atisfaction than the a&s;&s;urance, that I &s;hall not have that misfortune.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>He made me &s;it down, and he &s;at down by me, and after &s;aying a thou&s;and kind things to me; he turns upon me with a &s;mile, <Q>&startq;Why, will you venture your&s;elf to Italy with me?' I &s;topped a-while, and then an&s;wered, 'that I wondered he would a&s;k me that que&s;tion; for I would go any-where in the world, or all over the world, wherever he &s;hould de&s;ire me, and give me the&endq; felicity of his company.</Q></P>
<P>Then he entered into a long account of the occa&s;ion of the journey; and how the king had engaged him to go; and &s;ome other circum&s;tances which are not proper to enter into here.</P>
<P>But to cut &s;hort this part of the &s;tory, and the hi&s;tory of our journey, and &s;tay abroad, which would almo&s;t fill up a volume of it&s;elf; I &s;ay, we &s;pent all that evening in chearful con&s;ultations about the manner of our travelling; the equipage and figure he &s;hould go in; and in what manner I &s;hould go. Several ways were propo&s;ed, but none &s;eemed fea&s;ible; till, at la&s;t, I told him, I thought it would be &s;o trouble&s;ome, &s;o expen&s;ive, and &s;o publick, that it would be many ways in|convenient to him; and though it was a kind of death to me to lo&s;e him, yet that rather than
<PB N="111" REF="125">
&s;o very much perplex his affairs, I would &s;ubmit to any thing.</P>
<P>At the next vi&s;it I filled his head with the &s;ame difficulties, and then, at la&s;t, came over him with a propo&s;al, that I would &s;tay in Paris, or where el&s;e he &s;hould direct; and when I heard of his &s;afe arrival, would come away by my&s;elf, and place my&s;elf as near him as I could.</P>
<P>This gave him no &s;atisfaction, nor would he hear any more of it; but if I dur&s;t venture my|&s;elf, as he called it, &s;uch a journey, he would not lo&s;e the &s;atisfaction of my company; and as for the expence, that was not to be named, nei|ther indeed was there room to name it; for I found that he travelled at the King's expence, as well for him&s;elf as for all his equipage; being upon a piece of &s;ecret &s;ervice of the la&s;t impor|tance.</P>
<P>But after &s;everal debates between our&s;elves, he came to this re&s;olution, viz. that he would travel incog. and &s;o he &s;hould avoid all publick notice, either of him&s;elf, or of who went with him; and that then he &s;hould not only carry me with him, but have a perfect lei&s;ure of enjoying my agree|able company, as he was plea&s;ed to call it, all the way.</P>
<P>This was &s;o obliging, that nothing could be more; &s;o upon this footing, he immediately &s;et to work to prepare for his journey; and by his di|rections, &s;o did I too. But now I had a terrible difficulty upon me, and which way to get over it, I knew not; and that was, in what manner to take care of what I had to leave behind me. I was rich, as I have &s;aid, very rich; and what to do with it I knew not, nor who to leave in tru&s;t, I knew not. I had no-body but Amy, and to
<PB N="112" REF="126">
travel without Amy, was very uncomfortable; or to leave all I had in the world with her, and if &s;he mi&s;carried, be ruined at once, was a frightful thought; for Amy might die, and who&s;e hands things might fall into, I knew not: This gave me great unea&s;ine&s;s, and I knew not what to do; for I could not mention it to the Prince, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;ee that I was richer than he thought I was.</P>
<P>But the Prince made all this ea&s;y to me; for in concerting mea&s;ures for our journey, he &s;tarted the thing him&s;elf, and a&s;ked me merrily one even|ing, who I would tru&s;t with all my wealth, in my ab&s;cence?</P>
<P><Q>&startq;My wealth, my Lord!' &s;aid I, 'except what I owe to your goodne&s;s, is but &s;mall; but yet, that little I have, I confe&s;s, cau&s;es &s;ome thought|fulne&s;s; becau&s;e I have no acquaintance in Paris that I dare tru&s;t with it, nor any-body but my woman, to leave in the hou&s;e; and how to do without her upon the road, I do not well know.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'As to the road, be not concerned,' &s;ays the Prince, <Q>&startq;I will provide you &s;ervants to your mind; and as for your woman, if you can tru&s;t her, leave her here, and I will put you in a way how to &s;ecure things, as well as if you&endq; were at home.'</Q> I bowed and told him, I could not be put into better hands than his own, and that therefore, I would govern all my mea&s;ures by his directions; &s;o we talked no more of it that night.</P>
<P>The next day he &s;ent me in a great iron che&s;t, &s;o large, that it was as much as &s;ix lu&s;ty fellows could get up the &s;teps, into the hou&s;e; and in this I put, indeed, all my wealth; and for my &s;afety, he ordered a good hone&s;t ancient man and his wife,
<PB N="113" REF="127">
to be in the hou&s;e with her, to keep her company; and a maid &s;ervant, and a boy; &s;o that there was a good family, and Amy was madam, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Things being thus &s;ecured, we &s;et out incog. as he called it; but we had two coaches and &s;ix hor&s;es; two chai&s;es; and about eight men &s;ervants on hor&s;eback, all very well armed.</P>
<P>Never was woman better u&s;ed, that went upon no other account than I did. I had three women &s;ervants to wait on me: one was an elderly woman, who thoroughly under&s;tood her bu&s;ine&s;s, and ma|naged every thing, &s;o I had no trouble. They had one coach to them&s;elves, and the Prince and I the other; only that &s;ometimes, where he knew it nece&s;&s;ary, I went into their coach; and one par|ticular gentleman of the retinue rode with him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay no more of the journey, than that when he came to tho&s;e frightful mountains, the Alps, there was no travelling in our coaches; &s;o he ordered a hor&s;e-litter, but carried by mules, to be provided for me, and him&s;elf went on hor&s;e|back; the coaches went &s;ome other way back to Lvons; then we had coaches hired at Turin, which met us at Su&s;a; &s;o that we were accom|modated again, and went by ea&s;y journies after|wards to Rome, where his bu&s;ine&s;s called him to &s;tay &s;ome time, and from thence to Venice.</P>
<P>He was as good as his word indeed; for I had the plea&s;ure of his company, and in a word, en|gro&s;&s;ed his conver&s;ation almo&s;t all the way. He took delight in &s;howing me every thing that was to be &s;een, and particularly in telling me &s;ome|thing of the hi&s;tory of every thing he &s;hewed me.</P>
<P>What valuable pains were here thrown away upon one, who he was &s;ure, at la&s;t, to abandon
<PB N="114" REF="128">
with regret! How below him&s;elf did a man of quality, and of a thou&s;and accompli&s;hments, be|have in all this! It is one of my rea&s;ons for en|tering into this part, which otherwi&s;e would not be worth relating. Had I been a daughter, or a wife, of whom it might be &s;aid, that he had a ju&s;t concern in their in&s;truction or improvement, it had been an admirable &s;tep; but all this to a mi&s;tre&s;s! to one who he carried with him upon no account that could be rationally agreeable; and none but to gratify the meane&s;t of himan frailties: This was the wonder of it.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the power of a vicious inclination. Intriguing was, in a word, his darling crime; the wor&s;t excur&s;ion he made; for he was otherwi&s;e, one of the mo&s;t excellent per&s;ons in the world; no pa&s;&s;ions; no furious deviations; no o&s;tentati|ous pride: The mo&s;t humble, courteous, affable, per&s;on living; not an oath; not an indecent word, or the lea&s;t blemi&s;h in behaviour was to be &s;een in all his conver&s;ation, except as before excepted; and it has given me occa&s;ion for many dark re|flections &s;ince, to look back and think, that I &s;hould be the &s;nare of &s;uch a per&s;on's life; that I &s;hould influence him to &s;o much wickedne&s;s; and that I &s;hould be the in&s;trument in the hand of the devil, to do him &s;o much prejudice.</P>
<P>We were near two years upon this grand tour, as it may be called, during mo&s;t of which, I re|&s;ided at Rome, or at Venice, having only been twice at Florence, and once at Naples. I made &s;ome very diverting and u&s;eful ob&s;ervations in all the&s;e places, and particularly of the conduct of the ladies; for I had an opportunity to conver&s;e very much among them, by the help of the old wo|man who travelled with us. She had been at
<PB N="115" REF="129">
Naples, and at Venice, and had lived in the for|mer &s;everal years; where, as I found, &s;he had lived but a loo&s;e life, as indeed the women of Naples generally do; and, in &s;hort, I found &s;he was fully acquainted with all the intriguing arts of that part of the world.</P>
<P>Here my Lord bought me a little female Turki&s;h &s;lave, who being taken at &s;ea by a Malte&s;e man of war, was brought in there; and of her I learned the Turki&s;h language; their way of dre&s;&s;ing and d$ncing, and &s;ome Turki&s;h or rather Moori&s;h &s;ongs, of which I made u&s;e, to my advantage, on an extraordinary occa&s;ion, &s;ome years after, as you &s;hall hear in its place I need not &s;ay I learned Italian too, for I got pretty well mi&s;tre&s;s of that, before I had been there a year; and as I had lei&s;ure enough, and loved the language, I read all the Italian books I could come at.</P>
<P>I began to be &s;o in love with Italy, e&s;pecially with Naples and Venice, that I could have been very well &s;atisfied to have &s;ent for Amy, and have taken up my re&s;idence there for life.</P>
<P>As to Rome, I did not like it at all; the &s;warms of eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of all kinds, on one &s;ide, and the &s;coundrel rabble of the common people, on the other, make Rome the unplea&s;ante&s;t place in the world, to live in.</P>
<P>But I have no mind to write the hi&s;tory of my travels on this &s;ide of the world; at lea&s;t, not now; it would be too tedious.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, omit, that the Prince con|tinued in all this journey, the mo&s;t kind, obliging per&s;on to me in the world, and &s;o con&s;tant, that though we were in a country, where it is well known all manner of liberties are taken, I am
<PB N="116" REF="130">
yet well a&s;&s;ured, he neither took the liberty he knew he might have, or &s;o much as de&s;ired it.</P>
<P>I have often thought of this noble per&s;on, on that account. Had he been but half &s;o true, &s;o faithful and con&s;tant to the be&s;t lady in the world, I mean his prince&s;s; how glorious a virtue had it been in him? and how free had he been from tho&s;e ju&s;t reflections which touched him, in her behalf, when it was too late.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome very agreeable conver&s;ations upon this &s;ubject; and once he told me, with a kind of more than ordinary concern upon his thoughts, that he was greatly beholden to me for taking this hazardous and difficult journey; for that I had kept him hone&s;t. I looked up in his face, and coloured as red as fire. 'Well, well,' &s;ays he, 'do not let that &s;urprize you; I do &s;ay, you 'have kept me hone&s;t.'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;My Lord,' &s;aid I, 'it is not for me to ex|plain your words, but I wi&s;h I could turn them my own way: I hope,' &s;ays I, 'and believe, we are both as hone&s;t as we can be, in our cir|cum&s;tances.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Ay, ay,' &s;ays he, 'and hone&s;ter than I &s;hould have been, if you had not been with me. I cannot &s;ay but if you had not been here, I &s;hould have wandered among the gay world, in Naples, and in Venice too; for it is not &s;uch a crime here, as it is in other places. But I pro|te&s;t, I have not touched a woman in Italy, but your&s;elf; and more than that, I have not &s;o much as had any de&s;ire to it; &s;o that, I &s;ay, you&endq; have kept me hone&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;ilent, and was glad that he interrupted me, or kept me from &s;peaking, with ki&s;&s;ing me. I was once going to &s;ay, that if his Lady, the Prin|ce&s;s,
<PB N="117" REF="131">
had been with him, &s;he would, doubtle&s;s, have had the &s;ame influence upon his virtue, with infi|nitely more advantage to him: but I con&s;idered this might give him offence; and be&s;ides, &s;uch things might have been dangerous to the circum|&s;tance I &s;tood in; &s;o it pa&s;&s;ed off. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I &s;aw that he was quite another man, as to women, than I under&s;tood he had always been before; and it was a particular &s;atisfaction to me, that I was thereby convinced that what he &s;aid was true, and that he was, as I may &s;ay, all my own.</P>
<P>I was with child again in this journey, and lay|in at Venice, but was not &s;o happy as before. I brought him another &s;on, and a very fine boy it was; but it lived not above two months.</P>
<P>Shortly after this, my Lord told me, his bu&s;i|ne&s;s began to clo&s;e, and we would think of return|ing to France; which I was very glad of, but principally on account of my trea&s;ure I had there. It is true, I had letters very frequently from Amy, with accounts, that every thing was very &s;afe, and that was very much to my &s;atisfaction. However, as the Prince's negociations were at an end, and he was obliged to teturn, I was very glad to go. So we returned from Venice to Turin; and in the way, I &s;aw the famous city of Milan. From Turin, we went over the mountains again, and our coaches met us at Pont a Voi&s;in, between Chamberry and Lyons; and, by ea&s;y journies, we arrived &s;afely at Paris; having been ab&s;ent two years, wanting eleven days.</P>
<P>I found the family, much as we left them; and Amy cried for joy when &s;he &s;aw me, and I did the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="132">
The Prince took his leave of me the night be|fore; for as he told me he knew he &s;hould be met upon the road by &s;everal per&s;ons of qua|lity, and perhaps by the Prince&s;s her&s;elf, &s;o we lay at two different inns that night, le&s;t &s;ome &s;hould come quite to the place, as indeed, it hap|pened. After this, I &s;aw him not for above twenty days, being taken up in his family, and al&s;o with bu&s;ine&s;s; but he &s;ent me his Gentleman, to tell me the rea&s;on of it, and bid me not be unea&s;y; and that &s;atisfied me effectually.</P>
<P>In all this affluence of my good fortune, I did not forget that I had been rich and poor once al|ready, alternately; and that I ought to know, that the circum&s;tances I was now in, were not to be expected to la&s;t always; that I had had two chil|dren by him, and expected another; and if I bred often, it would &s;omething impair me in the great article that &s;upported my intere&s;t, I mean, what he called beauty; that as that declined, I might ex|pect the fire would abate, and the warmth with which I was now &s;o care&s;&s;ed, would cool, and in time, like the other mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of great men, I might be dropt again; and that, therefore, it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to take care that I &s;hould fall as &s;oftly as I could.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I did not forget, therefore, to make as good provi&s;ion for my&s;elf, as if I had had nothing to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on, but what I now gained; whereas I had not le&s;s than ten thou&s;and pounds, as I &s;aid before, which I had ama&s;&s;ed, or &s;ecured rather, out of the ruins of my faithful friend, the jeweller; and which, he little thinking of what was &s;o near him when he went out, told me, though in a kind of a je&s;t, was all my own, if
<PB N="119" REF="133">
he never came back; and which, upon that title, I took care to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>My greate&s;t difficulty now, was, how to &s;ecure my wealth, and to keep what I had got; for I had greatly added to it, by the generous bounty of the Prince, and the more, by the private retired man|ner of living, which he rather de&s;ired for privacy, than par&s;imony; for he &s;upplied me with a more magnificent way of life than I de&s;ired, if it had been proper.</P>
<P>I &s;hall cut &s;hort the hi&s;tory of this pro&s;|perous wickedne&s;s, with telling you I brought him a third &s;on, within &s;even months after our return from Italy; that now I lived a little more openly, and went by a particular name which he gave me abroad; but which I mu&s;t o|mit: viz. the Counte&s;s de&mdash;, and had coaches, and &s;ervants, &s;uitable to the quality he had given me the appearance of; and which is more than u&s;ually happens in &s;uch ca&s;es, this held &s;even years from the beginning; during which time, as I had been very faithful to him, &s;o, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that he was the &s;ame to me; that whereas he u&s;ually had two or three women, which he kept privately, he had not in all that time conver&s;ed with any of them, but that I had &s;o perfectly engro&s;&s;ed him, that he left them all, not, per|haps, that he &s;aved much by it, for I was a very chargeable mi&s;tre&s;s to him; but it was all owing to his particular affection to me, not to my extrava|gance; for, as I &s;aid, he never gave me leave to a&s;k him for any thing, but poured in his favours and pre&s;ents fa&s;ter than I expected, and &s;o fa&s;t, as I could not have the a&s;&s;urance to make the lea&s;t mention of de&s;iring more.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="134">
Nor do I &s;peak this of my own gue&s;s, I mean, about his con&s;tancy to me, and his quitting all other women; but the old harradan, as I may call her, who he made the guide of our travel|ing, and who was a &s;trange old creature, told me a thou&s;and &s;tories of his gallantry, as &s;he called it, that he had no le&s;s than three mi&s;tre&s;&s;es at one time, and, as I found, all of her procuring, he had of a &s;udden, dropt them all, and that he was entirely lo&s;t to them; that they did believe he had fallen into &s;ome new hands, but &s;he could never hear who, or where, till he &s;ent for her to go this journey; and then the old hag complimented me upon his choice; that &s;he did not wonder I had &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed him; &s;o much beauty; &s;uch an elegant figure, &amp;c. and there &s;he &s;topt,</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I found by her, what was, you may be &s;ure, to my particular &s;atisfaction, viz. that, as I &s;aid before, he was all my own.</P>
<P>But the highe&s;t tide has its ebb; and in all things of this kind, there is a reflux which &s;ometimes al&s;o is more impetuou&s;ly violent than the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;ion. The Prince was a man of a va&s;t fortune, though no Sovereign, and therefore there was no probability that the expence of keeping a mi&s;tre&s;s could be injurious to him, as to his e&s;tate: he had al&s;o &s;everal employments, both out of France, as well as in it; for he was not a &s;ubject of France, though he lived in that Court. He had a Prince&s;s, a wife, with whom he had lived &s;everal years, and a woman, &s;o the voice of fame reported, the mo&s;t valuable of her &s;ex; of birth equal to him, if not &s;upe|rior, and of fortune proportionable; but, in beauty, wit, and a thou&s;and good qualities,
<PB N="121" REF="135">
&s;uperior not to mo&s;t women, but even to all her &s;ex; and as to her virtue, the character which was mo&s;t ju&s;tly her due, was that of, not only the be&s;t of Prince&s;&s;es, but even the be&s;t of women.</P>
<P>They lived in the utmo&s;t harmony, as with &s;uch a Prince&s;s it was impo&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e; but yet the Prince&s;s was not in&s;en&s;ible that her Lord had his foibles; that he did make &s;ome ex|cur&s;ions; and particularly, that he had one fa|vourite mi&s;tre&s;s which &s;ometimes engro&s;&s;ed him more than &s;he could wi&s;h, or be ea&s;ily &s;atisfied with: however, &s;he was &s;o good, &s;o generous, &s;o truly kind a wife, that &s;he never gave him any unea&s;ine&s;s upon that account; except &s;o much as mu&s;t ari&s;e from the &s;en&s;e of her bearing the af|front of it with &s;uch patience, and &s;uch a pro|found re&s;pect for him, as was in it&s;elf enough to have reformed him, and did &s;ometimes &s;hock his generous mind, &s;o as to keep him at home, as I may call it, a great while together; and it was not long before I not only perceived it by his ab&s;ence, but really got a knowledge of the rea&s;on of it, and he even acknowledged it to me.</P>
<P>It was a point that lay not in me to manage: I made a kind of motion, once or twice, to him, to leave me, and keep him&s;elf to her, as he ought by the laws and rites of matrimony to do, and argued the genero&s;ity of the Prince&s;s to him, to per&s;uade him: but I was a hypocrite; for had I prevailed with him really to be hone&s;t, I had lo&s;t him, which I could not bear the thoughts of; and he might ea&s;ily &s;ee I was not in earne&s;t. One time in particular, when I took upon me to talk at this rate, I found when I argued &s;o much
<PB N="122" REF="136">
for the virtue and honour, the birth, and above all, the generous u&s;age he found in the per&s;on of the Prince&s;s, with re&s;pect to his private amours, and how it &s;hould prevail upon him: I found it began to affect him, and he returned; <Q>&startq;And do you indeed,&endq;</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;per&s;uade me to leave you? would you have me think you &s;incere?&endq;</Q> I looked up in his face, &s;miling; <Q>&startq;Not for any other favourite, my Lord,&endq;</Q> &s;aid I; <Q>&startq;that would&endq; break my heart;</Q> but for the Prince&s;s!&mdash;and then I could &s;ay no more, tears followed, and I &s;at &s;ilent a-while. <Q>&startq;Well,&endq;</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;if ever I do leave you, it &s;hall be on the virtuous account; it &s;hall be for the Prince&s;s, I a&s;&s;ure you it &s;hall be for no other woman.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;That is enough, my Lord,&endq;</Q> &s;aid I; <Q>&startq;there I ought to &s;ubmit; and, while I am a&s;&s;ured it &s;hall be for no other mi&s;tre&s;s, I promi&s;e your High|ne&s;s, I will not repine; or that, if I do, it &s;hall be a &s;ilent grief, it &s;hall not interrupt your felicity.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>All this while I &s;aid I knew not what, and &s;aid what I was no more able to do, than he was able to leave me; which, at that time, he owned he could not do, no, not for the Prince&s;s her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But another turn of affairs determined this matter; for the Prince&s;s was taken very ill, and in the opinion of all her phy&s;icians, very dange|rou&s;ly &s;o: in her &s;ickne&s;s &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with her Lord, and to take her leave of him. At this grievous parting, &s;he &s;aid &s;o many pa&s;&s;ionate kind things to him; lamented that &s;he had left him no children; &s;he had had three, but they were dead; hinted to him, that it was one of the
<PB N="123" REF="137">
chief things which gave her &s;atisfaction in death, as to this world; that &s;he &s;hould leave him room to have heirs to his family, by &s;ome Prince&s;s that &s;hould &s;upply her place; with all humility, but with a Chri&s;tian earne&s;tne&s;s, recommended to him to do ju&s;tice to &s;uch Prince&s;s, whoever it &s;hould be, from whom, to be &s;ure, he would ex|pect ju&s;tice; that is to &s;ay, to keep to her &s;ingly, according to the &s;olemne&s;t part of the marriage-covenant; humbly a&s;ked his Highne&s;s pardon, if &s;he had any way offended him; and appealed to Heaven, before who&s;e tribunal &s;he was to ap|pear, that &s;he had never violated her honour, or her duty to him; and praying to the Almighty, that his Highne&s;s might reform, and repent of his follies; &s;he in the mo&s;t moving, and mo&s;t pathe|tic expre&s;&s;ions of her affection to him, took her la&s;t leave of him, and died the next day.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e from a Prince&s;s &s;o valuable in her|&s;elf, and &s;o dear to him, and the lo&s;s of her fol|lowing &s;o immediately after, made &s;uch deep im|pre&s;&s;ions on him, that he looked back with de|te&s;tation upon the former part of his life; grew melancholy and re&s;erved; changed his &s;ociety, and much of the general conduct of his life; re&s;olved on a life regulated mo&s;t &s;trictly by the rules of virtue, and piety; and in a word, was quite another man.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of his reformation, was a &s;torm upon me; for, about ten days after the Prince&s;s's funeral, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to me by his Gentle|man, intimating, though in very civil terms, and with a &s;hort preamble, that he de&s;ired I would not take it ill that he was obliged to let me know, that he could &s;ee me no more. His Gentleman
<PB N="124" REF="138">
told me a long &s;tory of the new regulation of life his Lord had taken up, and that he had been &s;o afflicted for the lo&s;s of his Prince&s;s, that he thought it would either &s;horten his life, or he would re|tire into &s;ome religious hou&s;e, to end his days in &s;olitude.</P>
<P>I need not direct any body to &s;uppo&s;e, how I received this news. I was, indeed, exceedingly &s;urprized at it, and had much a-do to &s;upport my|&s;elf, when the fir&s;t part of it was delivered; though the gentleman delivered his errand with great re|&s;pect, and with all the regard to me, that he was able, and with a great deal of ceremony; al&s;o telling me how much he was concerned to bring me &s;uch a me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But when I heard the particulars of the &s;tory at large, and e&s;pecially that of the lady's di&s;cour&s;e to the Prince, a little before her death, I was fully &s;atisfied; I knew very well he had done nothing but what any man mu&s;t do, that had a true &s;en&s;e upon him of the ju&s;tice of the Prince&s;s's di&s;cour&s;e to him, and of the nece&s;&s;ity there was of his alter|ing his cour&s;e of life, if he intended to be either a chri&s;tian, or an hone&s;t man. I &s;ay, when I heard this, I was perfectly ea&s;y; I confe&s;s it was a cir|cum&s;tance that I might be rea&s;onably expected &s;hould have wrought &s;omething al&s;o upon me: I that had &s;o much to reflect upon more than the Prince; that had now no more temptation of poverty, or of the powerful motive, which Amy u&s;ed with me, namely, 'Comply and live; deny 'and &s;tarve;' I &s;ay, 'I that had no poverty to in|troduce vice, but was grown not only well &s;up|plied, but rich, and not only rich, but was very rich; in a word, richer than I knew how to think of; for the truth of it was, that thinking of it &s;ome|times
<PB N="125" REF="139">
almo&s;t di&s;tracted me, for fear of lo&s;ing it all again by &s;ome cheat or trick, not knowing any body that I could commit the tru&s;t of it to.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I &s;hould add at the clo&s;e of this affair, that the Prince did not, as I may &s;ay, turn me off rudely, and with di&s;gu&s;t; but with all the decency and goodne&s;s peculiar to him&s;elf, and that could con&s;i&s;t with a man reformed, and &s;truck with the &s;en&s;e of his having abu&s;ed &s;o good a lady as his late Prince&s;s had been. Nor did he &s;end me away empty, but did every thing like him&s;elf; and in particular, ordered his gentleman to pay the rent of the hou&s;e, and all the expence of his two &s;ons: and to tell me how they were taken care of, and where; and al&s;o, that I might at all times in&s;pect the u&s;age they had, and if I di&s;liked any thing, it &s;hould be rectified; and having thus fini&s;hed every thing, he retired into Lorrain, where he had an e&s;tate, and I never heard of him more, I mean, not as a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>The Hi&s;tory of a Jew and a Merchant.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW I was at liberty to go to any part of the world, and take care of my money my&s;elf. The fir&s;t thing that I re&s;olved to do, was to go directly to England, for there, I thought, being among my country folks, for I e&s;teemed my&s;elf an Engli&s;h woman, though I was born in France, but there, I &s;ay, I thought I could better manage things, than in France; at lea&s;t, that I would be in le&s;s danger of being deceived; but how to get away with &s;uch a trea&s;ure as I had with me, was a difficult point, and what I was greatly at a lo&s;s about.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="140">
There was a Dutch merchant in Paris, a Mr. Vandunc, that was a per&s;on of great reputation for a man of &s;ub&s;tance, and of hone&s;ty; but I had no manner of acquaintance with him, nor did I know how to get acquainted, &s;o as to di&s;cover my cir|cum&s;tances to him.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e I had no remedy, but that I mu&s;t tru&s;t &s;omebody; &s;o I &s;ent Amy.

<P>He dealt very candidly with me, and advi&s;ed me, when he knew my ca&s;e &s;o particularly, to take bills upon Am&s;terdam, and to go that way to England; for that I might lodge my trea&s;ure in the bank there, in the mo&s;t &s;ecure manner in the world; and that there he could recommend me to a man who perfectly under&s;tood jewels, and would deal faithfully with me in the di&s;po&s;ing of them.</P>
<P>I thanked him, but &s;crupled very much the travelling &s;o far into a &s;trange country, and e&s;pe|cially with &s;uch a trea&s;ure about me; that whether known, or concealed, I did not know how to
<PB N="127" REF="141">
venture with it: Then he told me, he would try to di&s;po&s;e of them there, at Paris, and convert them into money, and &s;o get me bills for the whole; and in a few days he brought a Jew to me, who, he &s;aid, would buy the jewels.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Jew &s;aw the jewels, I &s;aw my folly; and it was ten thou&s;and to one but I had been ruined, and perhaps, put to death in as cruel a manner as po&s;&s;ible. The ca&s;e was thus.</P>
<P>As &s;oon, I &s;ay, as the Jew &s;aw the jewels, he fell a jabbering in Dutch, to the merchant, and I could pre&s;ently perceive that they were in &s;ome great &s;urprize, both of them; the Jew held up his hands, looked at me with &s;ome horror, and put him&s;elf into a thou&s;and &s;hapes, twi&s;ting his body, and wringing up his face this way, and that way, in his di&s;cour&s;e; &s;tamping with his feet, and throwing abroad his hands, as if he was not in a rage only, but in a meer fury; then he would turn and give a look at me, like the Devil; I thought I never &s;aw any thing &s;o frightful in my life.</P>
<P>At length I put in a word; 'Sir,' &s;ays I, 'to Mr. Vandunc, <Q>&startq;what is all this di&s;cour&s;e to my bu&s;ine&s;s? What is this gentleman in all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions about? I wi&s;h, if he is to treat with me, he would &s;peak that I may under&s;tand him; or if you have bu&s;ine&s;s of your own between you, that is to be done fir&s;t, let me withdraw, and I will come again when you are at lei&s;ure.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'No, no, Madam,' &s;ays the Merchant, very kindly, <Q>&startq;you mu&s;t not go, all our di&s;cour&s;e is about you, and your jewels; and you &s;hall hear it pre|&s;ently: it concerns you very much, I a&s;&s;ure you:&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="128" REF="142">
&startq;Concern me!' &s;ays I; 'what can it concern me &s;o much, as to put this gentleman into &s;uch agonies? And what makes him give me &s;uch looks as he does? Why, he looks as if he would devour me.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The Jew under&s;tood me pre&s;ently, continuing in a kind of rage, and &s;poke in French, 'Yes, 'Madam, it does concern you much, very much 'very much,' repeating the words, &s;haking his head, and then turning to the merchant, 'Sir,' &s;ays he, 'pray tell her what is the ca&s;e.' 'No,' &s;ays Mr. Vandunc, 'not yet, let us talk a little 'farther of it by our&s;elves;' upon which they withdrew into another room, where &s;till they talked very high, but in a language I did not under&s;tand. I began to be a little &s;urprized at what the Jew had &s;aid, and eager to know what he meant, and was very impatient till the mer|chant came back, and that &s;o impatient, that I called one of his &s;ervants to let him kn$w, I de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. When Mr. Vandunc came in, I a&s;ked his pardon for being &s;o impa|tient, but told him, I could not be ea&s;y, till he had told me what the meaning of all this was.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, Madam,' &s;ays he, 'in &s;hort the mean|ing is, what I am &s;urprized at too: This man is a Jew, and under&s;tands jewels perfectly well; and that was the rea&s;on I &s;ent for him, to di&s;|po&s;e of them to him, for you; but as &s;oon as he &s;aw them, he knew the jewels very di&s;tinctly, and flying out in a pa&s;&s;ion, as you &s;ee he did, told me, in &s;hort, that they were the very par|cel of jewels which the Engli&s;h Jeweller had about him, who was robbed going to Ver&s;ailles, about &s;even years ago, to &s;how them the Prince de C&mdash;, and that it was for the&s;e very jewels,
<PB N="129" REF="143">
that the poor gentleman was murdered; and he is in all this agony to make me a&s;k you, how you came by them; and he &s;ays, you ought to be charged with the robbery and murder, and put to the que&s;tion, to di&s;cover who were the per&s;ons that did it, that they might be brought&endq; to ju&s;tice:'</Q> while he &s;aid this, the Jew came impudently back, into the room, without calling, which a little &s;urprized me again.</P>
<P>Mr. Vandunc &s;poke pretty good Engli&s;h, and he knew that the Jew did not under&s;tand Engli&s;h at all; &s;o he told me the latter part, when the Jew came into the room, in Engli&s;h; at which I &s;miled, which put the Jew into his mad fit again, and &s;haking his head, and making his devil's faces again, he &s;eemed to threaten me for laughing; &s;aying in French, this was an affair I &s;hould have little rea&s;on to laugh at; at this, I laughed again, letting him &s;ee that I &s;corned him; and turning to the merchant, 'Sir,' &s;ays I, <Q>&startq;that tho&s;e jewels were belonging to Mr. Dazzle, the Engli&s;h Jeweller; in that, &s;ays I, this per&s;on is right; but that I &s;hould be que&s;tioned how I came to have them, is a token of his ignorance; which, however, he might have managed with a little more good manners, till I had told him who I am; and both he, and you too, will be more ea&s;y in that part, when I &s;hould tell you, that I am the unhappy widow of that Mr Daz|zle, who was &s;o barbarou&s;ly murdered going to Ver&s;ailles; and that he was not robbed of tho&s;e jewels, but of others; my hu&s;band, having left tho&s;e behind him with me, le&s;t he &s;hould be robbed; had I, Sir, come otherwi&s;e by them, I &s;hould not have been weak enough to have
<PB N="130" REF="144">
expo&s;ed them to &s;ale here, where the fact was&endq; done, but have carried them farther off.</Q></P>
<P>This was an agreeable &s;urprize to the merchant, who being an hone&s;t man him&s;elf, believed every thing I &s;aid, which indeed, being all really and literally true, except the deficiency of my marriage, I &s;poke with &s;uch an unconcern|ed ea&s;ine&s;s, that it might plainly be &s;een, that I had no guilt upon me, as the Jew &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Jew was confounded when he heard that I was the jeweller's wife; but as I had rai&s;ed his pa&s;&s;ion, with &s;aying he looked at me with a devil's race, he &s;tudied mi&s;chief in his heart, and an&s;wer|ed, 'That &s;hould not &s;erve my turn;' &s;o called Mr. Vandunc out again; when he told him, that he re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute this matter farther.</P>
<P>There was one kind chance in this affair, which indeed, was my deliverance, and that was, that the fool could not re&s;train his pa&s;&s;ion, but mu&s;t let it fly to the Dutch Merchant; to whom, when they withdrew a &s;econd time, he told, that he would bring a proce&s;s again&s;t me for the murder; and that it &s;hould co&s;t me dear, for u&s;ing him at that rate; and away he went, de&s;ir|ing the Merchant to tell him when I would be there again. Had he &s;u&s;pected that Mr. Van|dunc would have communicated the particulars to me, he would never have been &s;o fooli&s;h as to have mentioned that part to him.</P>
<P>But the malice of his thoughts anticipated him, and the Merchant was &s;o good as to give me an account of his de&s;ign, which indeed was wicked enough in its nature; but to me it would have been wor&s;e, than otherwi&s;e it would to ano|ther; for upon examination, I could not have proved my&s;elf to be the wife of the Jeweller, &s;o the
<PB N="131" REF="145">
&s;u&s;picion might have been carried on with the better face; and then I &s;hould al&s;o have brought all his relations in England upon me; who find|ing by the proceedings, that I was not his wife, but a mi&s;tre&s;s, would immediately have laid claim to the jewels, as I had owned them to be his.</P>
<P>This thought immediately ru&s;hed into my mind, as &s;oon as the Merchant had told me what wicked things were in the head of that cur&s;ed Jew; and the villain convinced the Merchant that he was in earne&s;t, by an expre&s;&s;ion which &s;hewed the re&s;t of his de&s;ign, and that was, a plot to get the re&s;t of the jewels into his hands.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t he hinted to Mr. Vandunc, that the jewels were &s;uch a man's, meaning my hu&s;band's, he made wonderful explanations on account of their having been concealed &s;o long; where mu&s;t they have lain? and what was the woman that brought them? and that &s;he, meaning me, ought to be immediately apprehended, and put into the hands of ju&s;tice; and this was the time that, as I &s;aid, he made &s;uch horrible ge&s;tures, and looked at me &s;o like a devil.</P>
<P>The merchant hearing him talk at that rate, and &s;eeing him in earne&s;t, &s;aid to him, <Q>&startq;hold your tongue a little, this is a thing of con&s;e|quence; if it be &s;o, let you and I go into the next room, and con&s;ider of it there; and &s;o they withdrew, and left me.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Here, as before, I was unea&s;y, and called him out, and having heard how it was, gave him that an&s;wer, 'that I was his widow,' which the mali|cious Jew &s;aid, &s;hould not &s;erve my turn; and then it was, that the Merchant called him out again; and in this time of his withdrawing, the
<PB N="132" REF="146">
Merchant finding that he was really in earne&s;t, counterfeited a little to be of his mind, and enter|ed into propo&s;als with him for the thing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this they agreed to go to an advocate, or coun&s;el for directions how to proceed, and to meet again the next day; again&s;t which time the Mer|chant was to appoint me to come again with the jewels, in order to &s;ell them. 'No,' &s;ays the Merchant, <Q>&startq;I will go farther with her than &s;o; I will de&s;ire her to leave the jewels with me, to &s;how to another per&s;on, in order to get a better price for them:' 'That is right,' &s;ays the Jew, and I will engage &s;he &s;hall never be mi&s;tre&s;s of&endq; them again; they &s;hall either be &s;eized by us,'</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;in the King's name, or &s;he &s;hall be glad to give them up to us, to prevent her being put to the torture.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The Merchant &s;aid yes to every thing he offer|ed, and they agreed to meet the next morning about it, and I was to be per&s;uaded to leave the jewels with him, and come to them the next day, at four o'clock, in order to make a good bar|gain for them; and on the&s;e conditions they parted; but the hone&s;t Merchant, filled with in|dignation at the barbarous de&s;ign, came directly to me, and told me the whole &s;tory; 'and now, madam,' &s;ays he, 'you are to con&s;ider immedi|'ately what you have to do.'</P>
<P>I told him, if I was &s;ure to have ju&s;tice, I would not fear all that &s;uch a rogue could do to me; but how &s;uch things were carried on in France, I knew not. I told him the greate&s;t difficulty would be to prove our marriage, for that it was done in England, and in a remote part of Eng|land too, and which was wor&s;e, it would be hard

<P><Q>&startq;But as to the death of your hu&s;band, madam,&endq; what can be &s;aid to that?' &s;aid he.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Nay, &s;aid I, 'what can they &s;ay to it? In England, 'added I, if they would offer &s;uch an injury to any one, they mu&s;t prove the fact, or give ju&s;t rea&s;on for their &s;u&s;picion; that my hu&s;|band was murdered, that every one knows; but that he was robbed, of what, or how much, that none knows, no, not my&s;elf; and why was I not que&s;tioned for it then? I have lived in Paris ever &s;ince, excepting a tour I lately made to Italy, and no man had yet the impudence to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a thing of me.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'I am fully &s;atisfied of that,' &s;ays the Mer|chant; <Q>&startq;but as this is a man who may &s;tick at nothing, what can we &s;ay? and who knows what he may &s;wear? Suppo&s;e he &s;hould &s;wear, that he knew your hu&s;band had tho&s;e particular jewels with him the morning when he went out, and that he &s;hewed them to him, to con&s;ider their value, and what price he &s;hould a&s;k the Prince for them.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'Nay, by the &s;ame rule,' &s;aid I, 'he may &s;wear that 'I murdered my hu&s;band, if he finds it for his turn:'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;That is true,' &s;aid he; 'and if he &s;hould, I do not &s;ee what can &s;ave you;' but, added he, I have found out his more immediate de&s;ign; his de&s;ign is to have you carried to the Chatel|lette, that the &s;u&s;picion may appear ju&s;t; and then to get the jewels out of your hands, if po&s;&s;i|ble; then, at la&s;t, to drop the pro&s;ecution, on your con&s;enting to quit the jewels to him; and how you will do to avoid this, is the que&s;tion which I would have you con&s;ider of.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="134" REF="148">
&startq;My misfortune, Sir', &s;aid I, 'is, that I have no time to con&s;ider, and I have no per&s;on to con|&s;ider with, or advi&s;e about it; I find, that inno|cence may be oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch an impudent fellow as this; he that does not value a perjury, has any per&s;on's life at his mercy. But Sir, &s;aid I, is the ju&s;tice &s;uch here, that while I may be in the hands of the publick, and under pro&s;ecution, he may get hold of my effects, and get my jewels into his hands?&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;But what cour&s;e can I take to do that,' &s;ays I, now they have got notice that I have them? If they get me into their hands, they will oblige me to produce them, or perhaps, &s;entence me to pri|&s;on till I do.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Nay,' &s;ays he, 'as this brute &s;ays too, put you to the que&s;tion; that is, to the torture, on pretence of making you confe&s;s who were the murderers of your hu&s;band.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>The very word rack frighted me to death almo&s;t, and I had no &s;pirit left in me. 'Did it my&s;elf!' &s;aid I; 'that is impo&s;&s;ible!'</P>
<P><Q><PB N="135" REF="149">
&startq;No, Madam,' &s;ays he, 'it is far from im|po&s;&s;ible; the mo&s;t innocent people in the world have been forced to confe&s;s them&s;elves guilty of what they never heard of, much le&s;s, had any hand in.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;What then mu&s;t I do?' &s;aid I; 'what would 'you advi&s;e me to?&endq;</Q></P>

<P>Then he told me, how the Jew would have me ordered to bring the jewels the next day for &s;ale; and that then he would have me appre|hended; that he had made the Jew believe he would join with him in his de&s;ign; and that he would get the jewels into his hands.</P>
<P>Here I de&s;ired Mr. Vandunc to go home with me, that he might be a&s;&s;ured that what I had &s;aid was truth. He complied with my reque&s;t: and upon his enquiry, he was &s;atisfied that I was really the wi|dow of Mr. Dazzle, and that the jewels were law|fully mine.</P>
<P>When we had returned back to his hou&s;e; <Q>&startq;Now,' &s;ays the Merchant, 'I will give you bills for the money you de&s;ired immediately, and &s;uch as &s;hall not fail of being paid; take your jewels with you, and go this very evening to St. Germains; I will &s;end a man thither with you, and from thence, he &s;hall guide you to|morrow to Roan, where there lies a &s;hip of mine, ju&s;t ready to &s;ail for Rotterdam; you &s;hall have your pa&s;&s;age in that &s;hip on my account, and I will &s;end orders for him to

<P>Then the Merchant told me the mea&s;ures he had re&s;olved to take to delude the Jew, while I made my e&s;cape, which were very well contrived. <Q>&startq;Fir&s;t,' &s;aid he, 'when he comes to-morrow, I &s;hall tell him, that I propo&s;ed to you, to leave the jewels with me, as we agreed: but that you &s;aid, you would come and bring them in the afternoon, &s;o that we mu&s;t &s;tay for you till four o'clock; but then, at that time, I will &s;how a letter from you, as if ju&s;t come in, where|in you &s;hall excu&s;e your not coming; for that &s;ome company came to vi&s;it you, and prevented you; but that you de&s;ire me to take care that the Gentleman be ready to buy your jewels; and that you will come to-morrow, at the &s;ame hour&endq; without fail.</Q></P>

<P>I could not but approve all his mea&s;ures, &s;eeing they were &s;o well contrived, and in &s;o friendly a manner, for my benefit; and as he &s;eemed to be &s;o very &s;incere, I re&s;olved to put my life in his hands.

<P>When I came to him, he had his bills ready, and we &s;ettled.

The day after I was on board, the &s;hip went away, and we were out at &s;ea the next day after that; and thus I took my leave of France, and got clear of an ugly bu&s;ine&s;s, which, had it gone on, might have ruined me, and &s;ent me back as naked to England, as I was a little before I left it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>A Storm; and an Affair of another kind.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW Amy and I were at lei&s;ure to look upon the mi&s;chiefs that I had e&s;caped; and had I had any religion, or any &s;en&s;e of a &s;upreme power managing, directing, and governing both cau&s;es and events in this world, &s;uch a ca&s;e as this would have given any-body room to have been very thankful to the power who had not only put &s;uch a trea&s;ure into my hand, but given me &s;uch an e&s;cape from the ruin that threatened me. But I had none of tho&s;e things about me; I had indeed, a grateful &s;en&s;e upon my mind of the generous friend&s;hip of my deliverer, the Mer|chant; by whom I was &s;o faithfully &s;erved, and by whom, as far as relates to &s;econd cau&s;es, I was pre&s;erved from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, I had a grateful &s;en&s;e upon my mind, of his kindne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s to me, and I re&s;olved to &s;how him &s;ome te&s;timony of it, as &s;oon as I came to the end of my rambles, for I was yet but in a &s;tate of uncertainty, and &s;ometimes that gave me a little unea&s;ine&s;s too: I had paper indeed for my money, and he had &s;hewed him|&s;elf very good to me, in conveying me away; but I had not &s;een the end of things yet; for unle&s;s the bills were paid, I might &s;till be a great lo&s;er by Mr. Vandune, and he might, per|haps, have contrived all the affair of the Jew, to put me into a fright, and get me to run away, and that, as if it were to &s;ave my life; that if the bills &s;hould be refu&s;ed, I was cheated, with a witne&s;s.

<P>When I pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;hip between Dover and Calais, and &s;aw beloved England once more un|der my view; England, which I counted my na|tive country, being the place I was bred up in; a &s;trange kind of joy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my mind, and I had &s;uch a longing de&s;ire to be there, that I would have given the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip twenty pi&s;toles to have &s;tood-over, and &s;et me on &s;hore in the Downs; and when he told me he could not do it, that is, that he dur&s;t not do it, if I would have given him an hundred pi&s;toles, I &s;ecretly wi&s;hed that a &s;torm would ri&s;e, that might drive the &s;hip over to the coa&s;t of England, whether they would or not, that I might be &s;et on &s;hore any where upon Engli&s;h ground.</P>
<P>This wicked wi&s;h had not been out of my thoughts above two or three hours, but the Ma&s;|ter &s;teering away to the north, as was his cour&s;e to do, we lo&s;t &s;ight of land on that &s;ide, and only had the Flemi&s;h &s;hore in view on our right|hand, or, as the &s;eamen call it, the &s;tarboard|&s;ide; and then with the lo&s;s of the &s;ight, the wi&s;h for landing in England abated; and I con|&s;idered how fooli&s;h it was to wi&s;h my&s;elf out of the way of my bu&s;ine&s;s; that if I had been on &s;hore in England, I mu&s;t go back to Holland, on account of my bills, and I having no corre&s;pon|dence there, that I could not have managed it without going my&s;elf. But we had not been out of &s;ight of England many hours, before the wea|ther began to change, the winds whi&s;tled, and made a noi&s;e, and the &s;eamen &s;aid to one another, that it would blow hard at night. It was then a|bout
<PB N="140" REF="154">
two hours before &s;un-&s;et, and we were pa&s;&s;ed by Dunkirk, and I think they &s;aid we were in &s;ight of O&s;tend; but then the wind grew high, and the &s;ea &s;welled, and all things looked terrible, e&s;pecially to us, that under&s;tood nothing but ju&s;t what we &s;aw before us; in &s;hort, night came on, and very dark it was, the wind fre&s;hened, and blew harder and harder, and about two hours within night, it blew a terrible &s;torm.</P>
<P>I was not quite a &s;tranger to the &s;ea, having come from Rochelle to England, when I was a child, and went to France afterward; but I began to be alarmed a little with the terrible clamour of the men over my head, for I had never been in a &s;torm, and &s;o had never &s;een the like, or heard it; and once, offering to look out of the door of the &s;teerage, as they called it, it &s;truck me with &s;uch horror, the darkne&s;s, the fiercene&s;s of the wind, the dreadful height of the waves, and the hurry the Dutch &s;ailors were in, who&s;e language I did not under&s;tand, neither when they cur&s;ed, or when they prayed; I &s;ay, all the&s;e things toge|ther, filled me with terror; and, in &s;hort, I began to be very much frighted.</P>
<P>When I was come back into the great-cabin, there &s;at Amy. When Amy &s;aw me come back, and &s;it down without &s;peaking, for &s;o I did, &s;he looked two or three times up at me. At la&s;t &s;he came running to me: <Q>&startq;Dear Madam! what is the matter! what makes you look &s;o pale? why,&endq; you are not well; what is the matter?</Q> I &s;aid nothing &s;till, but held up my hands two or three times. Amy doubled her importunities. Upon that, I &s;aid; 'Step to the &s;teerage-door, and look out. So &s;he went immediately, and looked too,
<PB N="141" REF="155">
as I had bidden her; but the poor girl came back again in the greate&s;t amazement and horror that ever I &s;aw any poor creature in, wringing her hands, and crying &s;he was undone! &s;he was undone! &s;he &s;hould be drowned! they were all lo&s;t! Thus &s;he ran about the cabin like a mad thing, and &s;o perfectly out of her &s;en&s;es, as any one in &s;uch a ca&s;e could be &s;up|po&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>I was frighted too: but when I &s;aw the girl in &s;uch a terrible agony, it brought me a little to my|&s;elf, and I began to talk to her, and put her in a little hope. I told her, there was many a &s;hip in a &s;torm, that was not ca&s;t-away; and I hoped we &s;hould not be drowned; that it was true, the &s;torm was very dreadful, but I did not &s;ee that the &s;eamen were &s;o much concerned as we were; and &s;o I talked to her as well as I could, though my heart was full enough of it, as well as Amy's, and death began to &s;tare us in the face, aye, and &s;omething el&s;e too, that is to &s;ay, con&s;cience, and my mind was very much di&s;turbed; but I had no|body to comfort me.</P>
<P>But Amy being in &s;o much wor&s;e a condition, that is to &s;ay, &s;o much more terrified at the &s;torm than I was, I had &s;omething to do to com|fort her; &s;he was like one di&s;tracted, and went raving about the cabin, crying out, &s;he was undone! undone! &s;he &s;hould be drowned; and at la&s;t, the &s;hip giving a jerk, by the force I &s;uppo&s;e of &s;ome violent wave, it threw poor Amy quite down, for &s;he was weak enough before with being &s;ea-&s;ick, and as it threw her forward, the poor girl &s;truck her head again&s;t the bulk-head, as the &s;ea|men call it, of the cabin, and laid her as dead as
<PB N="142" REF="156">
a &s;tone upon the floor, or deck, that is to &s;ay, &s;he was &s;o to all appearance.</P>
<P>I cried out for help; but it had been all one to have cried out on the top of a mountain, where no-body had been within five miles of me; for the &s;eamen were &s;o engaged, and made &s;o much noi&s;e, that no-body heard me, or came near me. I opened the great cabbin-door, and looked into the &s;teerage, to cry for help; but there, to en|crea&s;e my fright, were two &s;eamen on their knees, at prayers, and only one man who &s;teered, and he made a groaning noi&s;e too, which I took to be &s;aying his prayers, but it &s;eems it was an&s;wering to tho&s;e above, when they called to him, to tell him which way to &s;teer.</P>
<P>Here was no help for me, or for poor Amy, who &s;till lay in &s;uch a condition, that I did not know whether &s;he was dead or alive. In this fright I went to her, and lifted her a little way up, &s;etting her on the deck, with her back to the boards of the bulk-head. However, after a great while, &s;he began to revive, and in about half an hour &s;he came to her&s;elf, but remembered nothing at fir&s;t of what had happened to her.</P>
<P>When &s;he recovered, &s;he a&s;ked me where &s;he was? I told her, &s;he was in the &s;hip yet, but God knows how long it be might be. 'Why Madam,' &s;ays &s;he, 'it not the &s;torm over?'</P>
<P>'No, no,' &s;ays I, 'Amy.'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, Madam,' &s;ays &s;he, 'it was calm ju&s;t&endq; now:' meaning when &s;he was in the &s;wooning fit, occa&s;ioned by her fall.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Calm Amy!' &s;ays I, 'it is far from calm; it may be it will be calm by-and-by, when we are all drowned, and gone to Heaven.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="143" REF="157">
&startq;Heaven! Madam,' &s;ays &s;he; 'what makes you talk &s;o? Heaven! I go to Heaven! No, no, if I am drown'd, I am damn'd! Don't you know what a wicked creature I have been? I have lived a wretched abominable life of vice and wickedne&s;s for &s;everal years. O Madam, you know it, and God knows it; and now I am to die; to be drowned; O? what will become of me? I am undone for ever! ay, Madam, for ever; to all eternity! O I am lo&s;t! I am lo&s;t! If I am drowned, I am lo&s;t for ever!&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words, you will &s;uppo&s;e, mu&s;t be &s;o many &s;tabs into the very &s;oul of one in my own ca&s;e; it immediately occurred to me, 'Poor Amy! 'what art thou, that I am not? what ha&s;t thou 'been that I have not been?' Then it came to my remembrance, that I had been wor&s;e than Amy, this repeated it&s;elf to my thoughts at that very moment; and every one of Amy's cries &s;ounded thus in my ears; <Q>&startq;if thou art lo&s;t for ever, what mu&s;t I be? what mu&s;t be my por|tion, who have much more to an&s;wer for? and that as we had &s;inned together; &s;o, now, we were likely to &s;ink together.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>It is true, this difference was between us, that I &s;aid all the&s;e things within my&s;elf, and &s;ighed, and mourned inwardly; but Amy, as her temper was more violent, &s;poke aloud, and cried, and called out aloud, like one in an agony.</P>
<P>I had but &s;mall encouragement to give her, and indeed could &s;ay but very little; but I got her to compo&s;e her&s;elf, and not let any of the people of the &s;hip under&s;tand what &s;he meant, or what &s;he &s;aid; but even in her greate&s;t compo&s;ure, &s;he con|tinued to expre&s;s her&s;elf with the utmo&s;t dread and terror, on account of the wicked life &s;he had
<PB N="144" REF="158">
lived; and crying out, &s;he &s;hould be doomed to eternal puni&s;hment; which was very terrible to me, who knew what condition I was in my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e &s;erious con&s;iderations, I was very penitent too for my former &s;ins, and cried out, though &s;oftly, 'Lord have mercy upon me;' to this, I added abundance of re&s;olutions, of what a life I would live, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God but to &s;pare me this time; how I would live a virtuous life, and &s;pend a great deal of what I had thus wickedly got, in acts of charity, and doing good.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e dreadful apprehen&s;ions, I looked back on the life I had led, with the utmo&s;t ab|horrence; I blu&s;hed, and wondered at my&s;elf, how I could act thus; how I could dive&s;t my&s;elf of mode&s;ty and honour, and pro&s;titute my&s;elf for gain; and I thought, if ever it &s;hould plea&s;e God to &s;pare me this time from death, it would not be po&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould be the &s;ame creature again.</P>
<P>Amy went farther; &s;he prayed, &s;he re&s;olved, &s;he vowed to lead a new life, if God would &s;pare her but this time: it now began to be day-light, for the &s;torm held all night long, and it was &s;ome comfort to &s;ee the light of another day, which indeed none of us expected; but the &s;ea went mountains high, and the noi&s;e of the wa|ter was as frightful to us as the &s;ight of the waves; nor was any land to be &s;een; at la&s;t, to our great joy, they made land, which was on the coa&s;t of Suffolk; and the &s;hip being in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, they ran for the &s;hore, at all hazards, and, with great difficulty, got into Harwich, where they were &s;afe, as to the danger of death; but the &s;hip was &s;o full of water, and &s;o much damaged, that if they had not laid her on &s;hore the &s;ame
<PB N="145" REF="159">
day, &s;he would have &s;unk before night, according to the opinion of the &s;eamen, and of the work|men on &s;hore too, who were hired to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;topping their leaks.</P>
<P>Amy was revived as &s;oon as &s;he heard they had e&s;pied land, and went out upon the deck; but &s;he &s;oon came in again to me. 'O Madam,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>&startq;there's the land indeed to be &s;een, it looks like a ridge of clouds, and may be all a cloud for ought I know, but if it be land, it is a great way off; and the &s;ea is in &s;uch a commotion, we &s;hall all peri&s;h before we can reach it; 'tis the dreadfulle&s;t &s;ight to look at the waves, that ever was &s;een; why, they are as high as moun|tains; we &s;hall certainly be all &s;wallowed up, for all the land is &s;o near.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I had conceived &s;ome hope, that if they &s;aw land, we &s;hould be delivered; and I told her, &s;he did not under&s;tand things of that nature; that &s;he might be &s;ure, if they &s;aw land, they would go directly towards it, and would make into &s;ome harbour; but it was, as Amy &s;aid, a frightful di&s;|tance to it. The land looked like clouds, and the &s;ea went as high as mountains, &s;o that no hope appeared in the &s;eeing the land; but we were in fear of foundering before we could reach it; this made Amy &s;o de&s;ponding &s;till: but as the wind, which blew from the Fa&s;t, drove us fu|riou&s;ly towards the land; &s;o when, about half an hour after, I &s;tepped to the &s;teerage-door, and lo$ked out, I &s;aw the land much nearer than Amy repre&s;ented it; then I went in, and encou|raged Amy again, and indeed, was encouraged my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="160">
In about an hour we could &s;ee, to our infinite &s;atisfaction, the open harbour of Harwich, and the ve&s;&s;el &s;tanding directly towards it, and in a few minutes more, the &s;hip was in &s;mooth water, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible comfort; and thus I had, though again&s;t my will, and contrary to my true intere&s;t, what I wi&s;hed for, to be driven away to England, though it was by a &s;torm.</P>
<P>This incident did neither Amy or me much &s;ervice; for the danger being over, the fears of death vani&s;hed with it; ay, and our fear of what was beyond death al&s;o: our &s;en&s;e of the life we had lived, went off, and with our return to life, our wicked ta&s;te of life returned, and we were both the &s;ame as before. So certain is it, that the repentance which is brought about by the meer apprehen&s;ions of death, wears off as tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions wear off; and death-bed repent|ance, or &s;torm-repentance, which is much the &s;ame, is &s;eldom &s;incere.</P>
<P>However, I do not tell you that this was all at once, neither; the fright we had at &s;ea la&s;ted a little while afterwards, at lea&s;t, the impre&s;&s;ion was not quite blown off as &s;oon as the &s;torm; e&s;pe|cially poor Amy, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;et her foot on &s;hore, &s;he fell flat upon the ground, and ki&s;&s;ed it, and gave God thanks for her deliverance from the &s;ea; and turning to me when &s;he got up, 'I 'hope, Madam, you will never go upon the &s;ea 'again.'</P>
<P>I know not what ailed me; but Amy was much more penitent at &s;ea, and much more &s;en|&s;ible of her deliverance when &s;he landed, and was &s;afe, than I was. I was in a kind of &s;tupidity, I know not what well to call it; I had a mind full of horror in the time of the &s;torm, and &s;aw
<PB N="147" REF="161">
death before me as plainly as Amy, but my thoughts got no vent, as Amy's did; I had a &s;ilent &s;ullen kind of grief, which could not break out either in words or tears, and which was, therefore, much the wor&s;e to bear.</P>
<P>I had a terror upon me for my wicked life pa&s;t, and firmly believed I was going to the bot|tom, launching into death, where I was to give an account of all my pa&s;t actions; and in this &s;tate, and on that account, I locked back upon my wickedne&s;s with abhorrence. But I had no &s;en&s;e of repentance, from the true motive of re|pentance; I &s;aw nothing of the corruption of na|ture, the &s;in of my life, as an offence again&s;t God; as a thing odious to the holine&s;s of his being; as abu&s;ing his mercy, and de&s;pi&s;ing his goodne&s;s. In &s;hort, I had no thorough effectual repentance; no &s;ight of my &s;ins in their proper &s;hape; no view of a Redeemer, or hope in him: I had only &s;uch a repentance as a criminal has at the place of ex|ecution, who is &s;orry, not that he has committed the crime, as it is a crime, but &s;orry that he is to &s;uffer for it.</P>
<P>It is true, Amy's repentance wore off too, as well as mine, but not &s;o &s;oon: however, we were both very grave for a time.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we could get a boat from the town, we went on &s;hore, and immediately went to a publick-hou&s;e in the town of Harwich, where we were to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly what was to be done, and whether we &s;hould go up to London, or &s;tay till the &s;hip was refitted, which, they &s;aid, would be a fortnight, and then go for Holland, as we in|tended, and as bu&s;ine&s;s required.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on directed that I &s;hould go to Holland, for there I had all my money to receive, and there
<PB N="148" REF="162">
I had per&s;ons of good reputation and character to apply to, having letters to them from Mr. Vandunc, and they might, perhaps, give me a recommendation again to merchants in London, and &s;o I &s;hould get acquaintance with &s;ome people of figure, which was what I loved; whereas now I knew not one creature in the whole city of London, or any-where el&s;e, that I could go and make my&s;elf known to. Upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, I re&s;olved to go to Holland.</P>
<P>But Amy cried and trembled, and was ready to fall into fits, when I did but mention going upon the &s;ea again, and begged of me not to go, or if I would go, that I would leave her behind, tho' I was to &s;end her a begging. The people in the inn laughed at her, and je&s;ted with her; a&s;ked her if &s;he had any &s;ins to confe&s;s, that &s;he was a&s;hamed to be heard of? and that &s;he was trou|bled with an evil con&s;cience; told her if &s;he came to &s;ea, and to be in a &s;torm, if &s;he had lain with her ma&s;ter, &s;he would certainly tell her mi&s;tre&s;s of it; and that it was a common thing for girls to confe&s;s all the young men they had lain with; that there was one poor girl that went over with her mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e hu&s;band was a mercer in Cheap&s;ide, who confe&s;&s;ed, in the terror of a &s;torm, that &s;he had lain with her ma&s;ter &s;o often, and in &s;uch and &s;uch places, that made the poor mi&s;tre&s;s, when &s;he returned to London, fly at her hu&s;band, and make &s;uch a bu&s;tle, as was almo&s;t the ruin of the whole family.</P>
<P>I thought Amy's fear would have been over by that time the &s;hip would be gotten ready, but I found the girl was rather wor&s;e and wor&s;e; and when I came to the point, that we mu&s;t go on board, or lo&s;e the pa&s;&s;age, Amy was &s;o terrified,
<PB N="149" REF="163">
that &s;he fell into fits; &s;o the &s;hip went away with|out us.</P>
<P>But my going being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, I was obliged to go in the packet-boat &s;ome time after, and leave Amy behind at Harwich, but with di|rections to go to my children, and &s;tay with them, to receive letters and orders from me what to do: accordingly, I &s;upplied her with a &s;ufficient &s;um of money for all expences, and to pay whatever was owing.</P>
<P>Now I was become, from a woman given up to plea&s;ures, a woman of bu&s;ine&s;s, and of great bu|&s;ine&s;s too, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I got me a &s;ervant at Harwich, to go over with me, who had been at Rotterdam, knew the place, and &s;poke the language, which was a great help to me, and away I went. I had a very quick pa&s;|&s;age, and plea&s;ant weather; and coming to Rotter|dam, &s;oon found out the merchant to whom I was recommended, who received me with extraordinary re&s;pect. And fir&s;t he acknowledged the accepted bill for four thou&s;and pi&s;toles, which he afterwards paid punctual$y; other bills that I had al&s;o pay|able at Am&s;terdam, he procured to be received for me; and whereas one of the bills for one thou&s;and two hundred crowns was prote&s;ted at Am&s;terdam, he paid it me him&s;elf, for the honour of the indor|&s;er, as he called it, which was my friend Mr. Van|dunc.</P>
<P>There I entered into a negotiation by his means, for my jewels, and he brought me &s;everal jewellers, to look on them, and particularly one to value them.</P>
<P>All this work took me $Word$ half a year, and by managing my bu&s;ine&s;s $hus my&s;elf, and having large &s;ums to do with, I became as expert in it, as
<PB N="150" REF="164">
any the-merchant of them all; I had credit in the bank for a large &s;um of money, and bills and notes for much more.</P>
<P>After I had been here about three months, my maid Amy writes me word, that &s;he had received a letter from her friend, as &s;he called him; that, by the way, was the Prince's gentleman, that had been Amy's extraordinary friend indeed; for Amy owned to me, that he had lain with her as often as he plea&s;ed, for the &s;even years which that affair la&s;ted. This was what &s;he called her friend, who &s;he corre&s;ponded with upon this particular &s;ubject; and among other things, &s;ent her this par|ticular news, that my hu&s;band, Mr. Bacon, the Brewer, who rode in the Gens d' Arms, was dead; that he was killed in a rencounter, as they call it, or accidental &s;cuffle among the troopers; and &s;o the jade congratulated me upon my being now a free woman; <Q>&startq;And now, Madam,' &s;ays &s;he, at the end of her letter, 'you have nothing to do but to come hither, and &s;et up a coach; and if beauty and a good fortune will not make&endq; you a dutche&s;s, nothing will.'</Q> But I had not fixed my mea&s;ures yet; I had no inclination to be a wife again, I had had &s;uch bad luck with my fir&s;t hu&s;band, I hated the thoughts of a &s;econd. I found that a wife is treated with indifference, a mi&s;tre&s;s with a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion. A wife is looked upon as but an upper &s;ervant, a mi&s;tre&s;s as a &s;o|vereign; a wife mu&s;t give up all &s;he has; have every re&s;erve &s;he makes for her&s;elf be thought hard of, and be upbraided with her very pin-mo|ney; whereas a mi&s;tre&s;s makes the &s;aying true, <Q>&startq;that what the man has, is her's, and what &s;he&endq; has is her own.'</Q> The wife bears a thou&s;and in|&s;ults, and is forced to &s;it &s;till and bear it, or part
<PB N="151" REF="165">
and be undone. A mi&s;tre&s;s in&s;ulted, helps her&s;elf immediately, and takes another.</P>
<P>The&s;e were my wicked arguments for inconti|nency, for I never &s;et again&s;t them the difference another way, I may &s;ay, every other way; how that, fir&s;t, a wife appears boldly and honourably with her hu&s;band; lives at home, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his hou&s;e, his &s;ervants, his eq$ipages, and has a right to them all, and to call them her own; entertains his friends, owns his children, and has the return of duty and affection from them, as $hey are here her own, and claims upon his e&s;tate, by the cu&s;tom of England, if he dies, and leaves her a widow.</P>
<P>The pro&s;titute &s;eulks about in lodgings; is vi|&s;ited in the dark; di&s;owned upon all occa&s;ions, be|fore God and man; is maintained indeed, for a time, but is condemned to be abandoned at la&s;t, and left to the mi&s;eries of fate, and her own ju&s;t di&s;a&s;ter. If &s;he has any children, her endeavour is to get rid of them, and not maintain them; and if &s;he lives, &s;he is certain to &s;ee them all hate her, and be a&s;hamed of her. While the vice rages, and the man is in the devil's hand, &s;he has him; and while &s;he has him, &s;he makes a prey of him: but if he happens to fall &s;ick; if any di&s;a&s;ter befals him, the cau&s;e of all lies upon her; he is &s;ure to lay all his misfortunes at her door; and if once he comes to repentance, or makes but one &s;tep towards a reformation, he begins with her; leaves her; u&s;es her as &s;he de&s;erves; hates her; abhors her; and &s;ees her no more; and that with this never|failing addition, namely, That the more &s;incere and unfeigned his repentance is, the more earne&s;t|ly he looks up; and the more effectually he looks in, the more his aver&s;ion to her, encrea&s;es; and he cur&s;es her from the bottom of his &s;oul; nay, it

<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed one morning, when being at the merchant's hou&s;e, who he had recommend me to, in Rotterdan, and being bu&s;y in his compting-hou&s;e, managing my bills, and preparing to write a letter to him, to Paris, I heard a noi&s;e of hor&s;es at the door; which is not very common in a city, where every body pa&s;&s;es by water; but he had, it &s;eems, ferried over the Maez from William&s;tadt, and &s;o came to the very door; and I looking to|wards the door, upon hearing the hor&s;es, &s;aw a gentleman alight, and come in at the gate. I knew nothing, and expected nothing, to be &s;ure, of the per&s;on; but, as I &s;ay, was &s;urpri&s;ed, and indeed, more than ordinarily &s;urpri&s;ed, when, com|ing nearer to me, I &s;aw it was my Merchant at Paris; my benefactor; and indeed, my deliverer, Mr. Vandunc.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, it was an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e to me, and I was exceeding glad to &s;ee him, who was &s;o honourable and &s;o kind to me, and who indeed had &s;aved my life. As &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he run to me, took me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ed me, with a freedom that he never offered to take with me before. <Q>&startq;Dear Mrs. Dazzle,' &s;ays he, 'I am glad to &s;ee you &s;afe in this country; if you had &s;tayed two days longer at Paris, you had been&endq; undone.'</Q> I was &s;o glad to &s;ee him, that I could not &s;peak a good while, and I bur&s;t out into tears, without &s;peaking a word for a minute; but I recovered that di&s;order, and &s;aid, 'The more, Sir, is my obligation to you, that &s;aved my life;' and added, <Q>&startq;I am glad to &s;ee you here, that I may con&s;ider how to ballance an account, in which I am &s;o much your debtor.&endq;</Q></P>

'You and I will adju&s;t that matter ea&s;ily,' &s;ays he, 'now we are &s;o near together. Pray where do 'lodge, Madam?'</P>

<P>'And where you may lodge too, Sir,' &s;ays the Gentleman, 'if it &s;uits with your bu&s;ine&s;s, and 'your other conveniency.'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;With all my heart,' &s;ays he; 'then Madam, I &s;hall be near you, and have time to tell you a &s;tory, which will be very long, and yet many ways very plea&s;ant to you, how trouble|&s;ome that fellow the Jew, has been to me, on your account; and what a &s;nare he had laid for you, if he could have found you.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>In &s;hort, he took up his lodgings in the &s;ame hou&s;e where I lodged and the room he lay in, opened ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to mine; and I was not at all &s;hy of him on that &s;core, for I believed him per|fectly hone&s;t, and &s;o indeed he was; and if he had not, that article was at pre&s;ent no part of my concern.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I gave him a particular account of every thing that has been already related; and added, but that money, he might &s;ee, would make a wo|man go any where.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed to laugh at all our womani&s;h fears, upon the occa&s;ion of the &s;torm; telling me, it was nothing but what is very ordinary in tho&s;e &s;eas; but that they had harbours on every coa&s;t, &s;o near, that they were &s;eldom in danger of being

<P>He told me, he was glad I had &s;uch an obliga|tion upon me to come over into Holland how|ever; but hinted, that he was &s;o intere&s;ted in my welfare, and be&s;ides, had &s;uch farther de&s;igns upon
<PB N="155" REF="169">
me, that if I had not &s;o happily been found in Holland, he was re&s;olved to have gone to England to &s;ee me; and that it was one of the principal rea|&s;ons of his leaving Paris.</P>
<P>I told him, I was extremely obliged to him for &s;o far intere&s;ting him&s;elf in my affairs; but that I had been &s;o far his debtor before, that I knew not how any thing could encrea&s;e the debt; for I owed my life to him already, and I could not be in debt for any thing more valuable than that.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered in the mo&s;t obliging manner po&s;|&s;ible, that he would put it in my power to pay that debt, and all the obligations be&s;ides, that ever he had, or &s;hould be able to lay upon me.</P>
<P>I began to under&s;tand him now, and to &s;ee plainly, that he re&s;olved to make love to me; but I would by no means &s;eem to take the hint, and be&s;ides, I knew that he had a wife with him in Paris; and I had, ju&s;t then, at lea&s;t, no ta&s;te to any more intriguing; however, he &s;urpri&s;ed me into a &s;udden notice of the thing a little while after, by &s;aying &s;omething in his di&s;cour&s;e, that he did, as he &s;aid, in his wife's days; I &s;tarted at that word; 'What mean you, Sir!' have you 'not a wife at Paris?'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;No, Madam, 'indeed,' &s;aid he, 'my wife died the beginning of September la&s;t, which it &s;eems was but a little after I came away.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>We lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e all this while; and as we lodged not far off of one another, opportu|nities were not wanting of as near an acquaintance as we might de&s;ire; nor have &s;uch opportunities the lea&s;t agency in vicious minds, to bring to pa&s;s even what they might not intend at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>However, though he courted &s;o much at a di|&s;tance, yet his preten&s;ions were very honourable;
<PB N="156" REF="170">
and as I had before found him a mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted friend, and perfectly hone&s;t in his dealings, even when I tru&s;ted him with all I had; &s;o now I found him &s;trictly virtuous, till an opportunity offered, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>It was not long after our former di&s;cour&s;e, when he repeated what he had in&s;inuated before, name|ly, that he had yet a de&s;ign to lay before me, which, if I would agree to his propo&s;als, would more than balance all accounts between us. I told him, I could not rea&s;onably deny him any thing; and except one thing, which I hoped and believed he would not think of, I &s;hould think my&s;elf very ungrateful if I did not do every thing for him that lay in my power.</P>
<P>He told me what he &s;hould de&s;ire of me, would be fully in my power to grant, or el&s;e he &s;hould be very unfriendly to offer it, and &s;till, all this while, he declined making the propo&s;al, as he called it, and &s;o, for that time, we ended our di&s;cour&s;e, turning it off to other things; &s;o that, in &s;hort, I began to think he might have met with &s;ome di&s;|a&s;ter in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and might have come away from Paris in &s;ome di&s;credit; or had had &s;ome blow on his affairs in general; and as really I had kindne&s;s enough to have parted with a great &s;um to have helped him, and was in gratitude bound to have done &s;o, he having &s;o effectually &s;aved to me all I had; &s;o I re&s;olved to make him the offer the fir&s;t time I had an opportunity, which, two or three days after, offered it&s;elf very much to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Sir,' &s;aid I, 'it is but ju&s;t, that what expence you have been obliged to be at, which was all on my account, &s;hould be repaid you; and there|fore, let me &s;ee&mdash;&endq;</Q> and there I pau&s;ed, and be|gan

to reckon up what I had ob&s;erved, from his own di&s;cour&s;e, it had co&s;t him in the &s;everal di&s;|putes, and hearings, which he had with that fellow of a Jew, and I ca&s;t them up at about two thou&s;and crowns; &s;o I pulled out &s;ome bills which I had upon a merchant in Am&s;terdam, and a particular account in bank, and was look|ing on them, in order to give them to him.</P>
<P>When he &s;eeing evidently what I was going about, interrupted me with &s;ome warmth, and told me, he would have nothing of me on that ac|count, and de&s;ired I would not pull out my bills and papers on that &s;core; that he had not told me the &s;tory with any &s;uch view; that it had been his misfortune fir&s;t to bring that rogue to me, which, though it was with a good de&s;ign, yet he would puni&s;h him&s;elf with the expence he had been at, for his being &s;o unlucky to me; that I could not think &s;o hard of him, as to &s;uppo&s;e he would take money of me, a widow, for &s;erving me, and do|ing acts of kindne&s;s to me in a &s;trange country, and in di&s;tre&s;s too; but he &s;aid he would repeat what he had &s;aid before, that he kept me for a deeper reckoning, and that, as he had told me, he would put me into a way to even all that favour, as I called it, at once; &s;o we &s;hould talk it over another time, and ballance all together.</P>
<P>Now I expected it would come out, but &s;till he put it off, from whence I concluded, it could not be matter of love, for that tho&s;e things are not u&s;ually delayed in &s;uch a manner, and therefore it mu&s;t be matter of money; upon which thought I broke the &s;ilence, and told him, that as he knew I had, by obligation, more kindne&s;s for him, than to deny any favour to him that I could grant, and that he &s;eemed backward to mention his ca&s;e; I
<PB N="158" REF="172">
begged of him to give me leave to a&s;k him, whether any thing lay upon his mind, with re&s;pect to his bu&s;ine&s;s and effects in the world? that if it did, he knew what I had, as well as I did; and that if he wanted money, I would let him have any &s;um for his occa&s;ion, and he &s;hould pay me as his own affairs would permit; and that, if he never paid me, I would a&s;&s;ure him, that I would never give him any trouble for it.</P>
<P>He ro&s;e up with ceremony, and gave me thanks, in terms that &s;ufficiently told me, he had been bred among people more polite, and more courte|ous, than is e&s;teemed the ordinary u&s;age of the Dutch; and after his compliment was over, he came nearer to me, and told me, that he was o|bliged to a&s;&s;ure me, though with repeated acknow|ledgments of my kind offer, that he was not in any want of money; that he had met with no unea&s;ine&s;s in any of his affairs, no not of any kind whatever, except that of the lo&s;s of his wife, and one of his children, which indeed, had troubled him much; but that this was no part of what he had to offer to me, and by granting which, I &s;hould ballance all obligations; but that, it was that &s;eeing providence had taken his wi&s;e from him, I would make up the lo&s;s to him; and with that, he held me fa&s;t in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ing me, would not give me leave to &s;ay no, and hardly to breathe.</P>
<P>At length, having got room to &s;peak, I told him, that, as I had &s;aid before, I could deny him but one thing; I was very &s;orry he &s;hould propo&s;e that thing only that I could not grant.</P>
<P>He was long bringing it out; but when he had, he pur&s;ued it with &s;uch importunities, as would admit of no denial, at lea&s;t he intended they &s;hould
<PB N="159" REF="173">
not; but I re&s;i&s;ted them ob&s;tinately, and yet with expre&s;&s;ions of the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s and re&s;pect for him that could be imagined; often telling him, there was nothing el&s;e I could deny him, and &s;hew|ing him all the re&s;pect, and upon all occa&s;ions treating him with intimacy and freedom, as if he had been my brother.</P>
<P>He tried all the ways imaginable to bring his de&s;ign to pa&s;s, but I was inflexible. At la&s;t, as I imagine, he thought of a way, which, he flattered him&s;elf, would not fail; nor would he have been mi&s;taken, perhaps, in any other woman but me; this was, as I &s;ay I imagine, to try if he could take me at an advantage, and get to-bed to me, and then, as was mo&s;t rational to think, I &s;hould wil|lingly enough marry him afterwards.</P>
<P>We were &s;o intimate together, that nothing but man and wife could, or at lea&s;t ought to be, more; but &s;till our freedoms kept within the bounds of mode&s;ty and decency. But one evening, above all the re&s;t, we were very merry, for I had been &s;ing|ing and playing on the harp&s;ichord, and I fancied he de&s;igned to watch for his advantage.</P>
<P>About one o'clock in the morning, for &s;o long we &s;at up together; I &s;aid, 'Mr. Vandunc it is 'very late, I mu&s;t go to bed.'</P>
<P>'Well,' &s;ays he, 'I will go with you.'</P>
<P>'No, no, thank you Sir,' &s;ays I; 'go to your 'own chamber:' and wi&s;hing him a good night I le&s;t him.</P>
<P>I had not been in bed two minutes, but he comes to my bed-chamber door, and opens it a little way, and &s;ays &s;oftly; 'What, are you really 'in bed?'</P>
<P>'Yes, yes,' &s;ays I; 'get you gone.' So he comes into the room, fa&s;tens the door, and immediately
<PB N="160" REF="174">
came to the bed-&s;ide, and took hold of one of my hands? I began to &s;truggle, and with &s;ome warmth bid him leave me, and be gone; but, it &s;ignified nothing, he did not regard it; &s;o he throws off his gown and &s;lippers, opened the bed-clothes, and came into my bed to me, in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t draw a &s;hade, and, though I made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, mu&s;t confe&s;s the frailty of nature, for this night, and the two following.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>An Incident very uncommon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the third night, Mr. Vandunc began to be very grave and &s;olemn. <Q>&startq;Now, my dear, though I have carried this matter farther than ever I intended; or than, I believe, you expect|ed from me, who never made any pretences to you but what were honourable; yet to heal it all up, and let you &s;ee how &s;incerely I meant at fir&s;t, and how hone&s;t I will ever be to you, I am ready to marry you &s;till, and de&s;ire you to let it be done to-morrow morning; and I will give you the &s;ame fair conditions of marriage as I&endq; would have done before.</Q></P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be owned, was a te&s;timony that he was very hone&s;t, and that he loved me &s;incere|ly; but I con&s;trued it quite another way, name|ly, that he aimed at my money. But how &s;ur|pri&s;ed did he look! and how was he confounded, when he found me receive his propo&s;al with cold|ne&s;s and indifference! and &s;till tell him, that it was the only thing I could not grant!</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="175">
He was a&s;toni&s;hed! <Q>&startq;What! not take me now!&endq;</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;When I have been a-bed with you!&endq;</Q> I an&s;wered coldly, though re&s;pectfully &s;till, <Q>&startq;It is true, to my &s;hame,&endq;</Q> &s;ays I; <Q>&startq;that you have taken me by &s;urpri&s;e; but I hope you will not take it ill that I cannot con&s;ent to marry, for all that; I hope you will not expo&s;e me, for my having expo&s;ed my&s;elf, but I cannot go any farther.&endq;</Q> And at that point I &s;tood, and would hear of no matrimony by any means.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e this may &s;eem a little odd, I &s;hall &s;tate the matter clearly, as I under&s;tood it my|&s;elf. I knew that while I was a mi&s;tre&s;s, it is cu&s;tomary for the per&s;on kept, to receive from them that keep; but if I &s;hould be a wife, all I had then was given up to the hu&s;band, and I was thenceforth to be under his authority on|ly; and as I had money enough, and was in no fear of being what they call a ca&s;t-off mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;o I had no need to give him twenty thou&s;and pounds to marry me, which had been buying my lodging too dear a great deal.</P>
<P>Thus his project of coming to-bed to me, was a trick upon him&s;elf, while he intended it for a trick upon me; and he was no nearer his aim of marrying me, than he was before; all his argu|ments he could urge upon the &s;ubject of matri|mony were at an end, for I po&s;itively declined marrying him; and as he had refu&s;ed the two thou&s;and crowns which I had offered him in com|pen&s;ation for his expences and lo&s;s with the Jew, and had done it upon the hopes he had of mar|rying me; &s;o when he found his way difficult &s;till, he was amazed, and, I had &s;ome rea|&s;on to believe, repented that he had refu&s;ed the money.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="176">
But thus it is when men run into wicked mea|&s;ures, to bring their de&s;igns about. I that was in|finitely obliged to him before, began to talk to him, as if I had ballanced accounts with him now; and that the favour of lying with me, was equal, not to the two thou&s;and crowns only, but to all the debt I owed him, for &s;aving my life, and all my effects.</P>
<P>But he drew him&s;elf into it, and though it was a dear bargain, yet it was a bargain of his own making. He could not &s;ay I had tricked him into it; but as he projected and drew me in to lie with him, depending that it was a &s;ure game in order to a marriage, &s;o I granted him the fa|vour, as he called it, to ballance the account of favours received from him, and keep the two thou&s;and crowns with a good grace.</P>
<P>He was extremely di&s;appointed in this article, and, I dare &s;ay, if he had not expected to have made it an earne&s;t for marrying me, he would never have attempted me the other way; &s;o, I believed, if it had not been for the money, which he knew I had, he would never have de&s;ired to marry me after he had lain with me. For, where is the man that cares to marry a &s;trumpet, though of his own making? And as I knew him to be no fool, &s;o I did him no wrong, when I &s;uppo&s;ed that, but for the money, he would not have had any thoughts of me that way; e&s;pe|cially after my yielding as I had done; in which it is to be remembered, that I made no capitula|tion for marrying him, when I yielded to him, but let him do ju&s;t what he plea&s;ed, without any previous bargain.</P>
<P>Hitherto we went upon gue&s;&s;es at one-another's de&s;igns; but as he continued to importune me
<PB N="163" REF="177">
&s;till to marry, though he had lain with me, and &s;till did lie with me as often as he plea&s;ed, and I continued to refu&s;e to marry him, though I let him lie with me whenever he de&s;ired it; I &s;ay, as the&s;e two circum&s;tances made up our conver|&s;ation, it could not continue long thus, but we mu&s;t &s;oon come to an explanation.</P>
<P>One morning, he &s;ighed, and told me, he de|&s;ired my leave to a&s;k me one que&s;tion, and that I would give him an an&s;wer to it with the &s;ame ingenuous freedom and hone&s;ty, that I had u&s;ed to treat him with. I told him I would. His que&s;tion was; why I would not marry him, &s;eeing I allowed him all the freedom of a hu&s;band? <Q>&startq;Or,' &s;ays he, 'my dear, &s;ince you have been &s;o kind as to take me to your bed, why will you not make me your own, and take me for good-and-all, that we may enjoy our&s;elves, without any reproach to one-another.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I told him, that as I con&s;e&s;&s;ed it was the only thing I could not comply with him in, &s;o it was the only thing in all my actions, that I could not give him a rea&s;on for; but it was evident, and he might &s;ee it, that as I was &s;en&s;ible of the obli|gation I was under to him, I could deny him no|thing; and if I had had any greater favour to yield him, I &s;hould have done it, that of matri|mony only excepted, and he could not but &s;ee that I loved him to an extraordinary degree, in every part of my behaviour to him; but that as to marrying, which was giving up my liberty, it was what once he knew I had done, and he had &s;een how it had hurried me up and down in the world, and what it had expo&s;ed me to; that I had an aver&s;ion to it, and de&s;ired he would not in&s;i&s;t upon it; he might ea&s;ily &s;ee I had no a|ver&s;ion
<PB N="164" REF="178">
to him; and that if I was with child by him, he &s;hould &s;ee a te&s;timony of my kindne&s;s to the father by my well providing for the child.</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent a good-whii$. At la&s;t, &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;Come, my dear, you are I believe the fir&s;t wo|man in the wor$d that ever lay with a man, and then refu&s;ed to marry him, and therefore there mu&s;t be &s;ome other rea&s;on for your refu&s;al; and I have therefore one other reque&s;t, and that is, if I gue&s;s at the true rea&s;on, and remove the objecti|on,&endq; will you then yield to me?'</Q> I told him, if he removed the objection, I mu&s;t needs comply, for I &s;hould certainly do every thing I had no ob|jection again&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why then, my dear, it mu&s;t be, that either you are already engaged, and married to &s;ome o|ther man, or you are not willing to di&s;po&s;e of your money to me, and expect to advance your|&s;elf higher with your fortune; now, if it be the fir&s;t of th$&s;e, my mouth will be &s;topped, and I have no more to &s;ay; but if it be the la&s;t, I am prepared effectually to remove the objection, and an&s;wer all you can &s;ay on that &s;ubject.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I took him up &s;hort at the fir&s;t of the&s;e; tel|ling him, he mu&s;t have ba&s;e thoughts of me indeed, to think that I could yield to him in &s;uch a manner as I had done, and continue it with &s;o much freedom, as he found I did, if I had a hu&s;band, or were engaged to any other man; and that he might depend upon it, that was not my ca&s;e, nor any part of my ca&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why then,' &s;aid he, 'as to the other, I have an offer to make to you, that &s;hall take off all the objection; that is, that I will not touch one &s;hil|ling of your e&s;tate, more, than &s;hall be with your own voluntary con&s;ent; neither now,

<P>I was indeed, &s;urpri&s;ed at that part of his of|fer, and he might ea&s;ily perceive it; it was not only what I did not expect, but it was what I knew not what an&s;wer to make to. He had in|deed removed my principal objection, nay, all my objections, and it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to give any an&s;wer; for if upon &s;o generous an offer I &s;hould agree with him, I then did as good as confe&s;s, that it was upon the ac|count of my money that I refu&s;ed him; and that though it was true, yet was really too gro&s;s for me to acknowledge.</P>
<P>I told him, I had, perhaps, different notions of matrimony, from what the received cu&s;tom had given us of it; that I thought a woman was a free agent, as well as a man, and was born free, and could &s;he manage her&s;elf &s;uitably, might en|joy that liberty to as much purpo&s;e as the men do; that the laws of matrimony were indeed otherwi&s;e, and mankind at that time, acted quite upon other principles; that the very nature of the marriage-contract was, in &s;hort, nothing but giving up liberty, e&s;tate, authority, and every thing to the man, and the woman was in|deed, a mere woman ever after, that is to &s;ay, a &s;lave.</P>
<P>He replied, that though in &s;ome re&s;pects it was as I had &s;aid, yet I ought to con&s;ider, that as an equivalent to this, the man had all the care
<PB N="166" REF="180">
of things devolved upon him; that the weight of bu&s;ine&s;s lay upon his &s;houlders, and as he had the tru&s;t, &s;o he had the toil of life upon him, his was the labour, his the anxiety of living; that the woman had nothing to do but to &s;it &s;till, and look round her; be waited on, and made much of; be &s;erved, and loved, and made ea&s;y; and that, in general, the labour of the man was appointed to make the woman live quiet and un|concerned in the world; that they had the name of &s;ubjection, without the thing; for in general, the women had only the care of managing, that is, &s;pending what their hu&s;bands get; and that a woman had the name of &s;ubjection indeed, but that they generally commanded not the men only, but all they had; managed all for them&s;elves, and where the man did his duty, the woman's life was all ea&s;e and tranquility.</P>
<P>I returned, that while a woman was &s;ingle, &s;he had the full command of what &s;he had, and the full direction of what &s;he did; that &s;he was con|trouled by none, becau&s;e accountable to none, and was in &s;ubjection to none; &s;o I &s;ung the&s;e two lines:</P>
<Q><L>O! 'tis plea&s;ant to be free,</L>
<L>The &s;weete&s;t Mi&s;s is Liberty.</L></Q>
<P>I added, that whatever the woman was, that had an e&s;tate, and would give it up to be the &s;lave of a man, that woman was a fool, and mu&s;t be fit for nothing but a beggar; that it was my opinion, a woman was as fit to govern and enjoy her own e&s;tate, without a man, as a man was without a woman.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="181">
All he could &s;ay, could not an&s;wer the force of this, as to argument; only this, that the other way was the ordinary method that the world was guided by; that he had rea&s;on to expect I &s;hould be content with that which all the world was con|tented with; that he was of the opinion, that a &s;incere affection between a man and his wife, an|&s;wered all the objections that I had made about the being a &s;lave; and where there was a mutual love, there could be no bondage; but that there was but one intere&s;t, one aim, one de&s;ign, and all con&s;pired to make them both happy.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Ay,' &s;aid I, 'that is the thing I complain of; the pretence of affection, takes from a wo|man every thing that can be called her&s;elf; &s;he is to have no intere&s;t, no aim, no view; but all is the intere&s;t, aim, and view, of the hu&s;|band.

He did not know how feelingly I &s;poke this; how near I was to the very la&s;t article, viz. crying my&s;elf to death; and how I really &s;tarved for al|mo&s;t two years together.</P>
<P>He &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, where had I lived? and what dreadful families had I lived among, that had frighted me into &s;uch terrible apprehen&s;ions of things? that if I would embark with him, he had a fortune equal with mine; that together, we &s;hould have no occa&s;ion of engaging in bu&s;ine&s;s any more; but that in any part of the world where I had a mind to live, whether England, France, Holland, or where I would, we might &s;ettle, and lives as happily as the world could make any one live; that if I de&s;ired the management of our e&s;tate, when put together, if I would not tru&s;t him with mine, he would tru&s;t me with his; that we would be up|on one bottom, and I &s;hould &s;teer, 'Ay,' &s;ays I, 'you will allow me to &s;teer, that is, hold the 'helm, but you will conn the &s;hip, as they call 'it.'

<P>Well, he did not give it over yet, but came to the &s;erious part, and there he thought he &s;hould be too many for me. He fir&s;t hinted, that mar|riage was decreed by Heaven; that it was the fixed &s;tate of life, which God had appointed for man's felicity, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing a legal po&s;te|rity; that there could be no legal claims of e&s;tates by inheritance, but by children born in wed|lock; that all the re&s;t were &s;unk under &s;candal and illegitimacy; and very well he talked upon that &s;ubject, indeed.</P>
<P>But it would not do: I took him &s;hort there. <Q>&startq;Look you, Mr. Vandunc, &s;aid I, 'you have an advantage of me there indeed, in my par|ticular ca&s;e; but it would not be generous to make u&s;e of it. I readily grant, that it were better for me to have married you, than to ad|mit you to the liberty I have given you: but as I could not reconcile my judgment to marriage, for the rea&s;ons above, and had kindne&s;s enough for you, and obligation too much on me to re&s;i&s;t you, I &s;uffered you to take indecent free|doms, and gave up my virtue; but I have two things before me to heal up that breach of honour, without that de&s;perate one of mar|riage; and tho&s;e are, repentance for what is pa&s;t, and putting an end to it for the time&endq; to come.</Q></P>
<P>He &s;eemed to be concerned, to think that I &s;hould take him in that manner. He a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="170" REF="184">
me that I mi&s;under&s;tood him; that he had more manners, as well as more kindne&s;s for me; and more ju&s;tice, than to reproach me with what he had been the aggre&s;&s;or in, and had &s;ur|pri&s;ed me into.</P>
<P>We &s;trained &s;ome compliments upon tho&s;e points, not worth repeating; and I added, I &s;up|po&s;ed when he got to-bed to me, he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of me; and indeed, in the ordinary cour&s;e of things, he ought to think &s;o; but that, upon the &s;ame foot of argument which I had di&s;|cour&s;ed with him upon, it was ju&s;t the contrary; and when a woman had been weak enough to yield up the la&s;t point before wedlock, it would be adding one weakne&s;s to another, to take the man afterwards; to pin down the &s;hame of it upon her&s;elf all the days of her life, and bind her|&s;elf to live all her time with the only man that could upbraid her with it; that in yielding at fir&s;t, &s;he mu&s;t be a fool, but to take the man, is to be &s;ure to be called fool; that to re&s;i&s;t a man, is to act with courage and vigour, and to ca&s;t off the re|proach, which, in the cour&s;e of things, drops out of knowledge, and dies; the man goes one way, and the woman another, as fate, and the circum&s;tances of things direct; and if they keep one another's coun&s;el, the folly is heard no more of: <Q>&startq;But to take the man,' &s;ays I, 'is the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous thing in nature; and, to u&s;e a coar&s;e expre&s;&s;ion, is to be&s;oil one's-&s;elf, and&endq; live always in the &s;cent of it.</Q> No, no,' added I, <Q>&startq;after a man has lain with me as a mi&s;tre&s;s, he ought never to lie with me as a wife; that is not only pre&s;erving the crime in memory, but it is recording it in the family. If the woman marries the man afterwards, &s;he beats the re|proach
<PB N="171" REF="185">
of it to the la&s;t hour; if her hu&s;band is not a man of a hundred thou&s;and, he &s;ome time or other upbraids her with it; if he has children, they fail not, one way or other, to hear of it; if the children are virtuous, they do their mother the ju&s;tice to hate her for it; if they are wicked, they give her the mortification of doing the like, and giving her for the ex|ample: On the other hand, if the man and the woman part, there is an end of the crime, and an end of the clamour; time wears out the me|mory of it; or a woman may remove but a few &s;treets, and &s;he &s;oon outlives it, and hears&endq; no more of it.</Q></P>
<P>He was confounded at this di&s;cour&s;e, and told me, he could not &s;ay but I was right in the main; that as to that part relat$$$ to managing e&s;tates, it was arguing <HI>a la cavalier;</HI> it was in &s;ome &s;en&s;e right, if the women were able to carry it on &s;o, but that in general, the &s;ex were not capable of it; their heads were not turned for it, and they had better choo&s;e a per&s;on capable, and hone&s;t, that knew how to do them ju&s;tice, as women, as well as to love them; and that then the trouble was all taken off their hands.</P>
<P>I told him, it was a dear way of purcha&s;ing their ea&s;e; for very often when the trouble was taken off their hands, &s;o was their money too; and that I thought it was far &s;afer for the &s;ex not to be afraid of the trouble, but to be really afraid of their money; that if nobody was tru&s;ted, no|body would be deceived; and the &s;taff in their own hands, was the be&s;t &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>He replied, that I had &s;tarted a new thing in the world; that however I might &s;upport it by &s;ubtle rea&s;oning, yet it was a way of arguing that
<PB N="172" REF="186">
was contrary to the general practice, and that he confe&s;&s;ed he was much di&s;appointed in it; that had he known I would have made &s;uch a u&s;e of it, he would never have attempted what he did, which he had no wicked de&s;ign in, re&s;olving to make me reparation, aad that he was very &s;orry he had been &s;o unhappy; that he was very &s;ure he &s;hould never upbraid me with it hereafter, and had &s;o good an opinion of me, as to believe I did not &s;u&s;pect him; but &s;eeing I was po&s;itive in refu&s;ing him, notwith&s;tanding what had pa&s;&s;ed, he had nothing to do but to &s;ecure me from re|proach, by going back again to Paris, that &s;o, according to my own way of arguing, it might die out of memory, and I might never meet with it again to my di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>I was not plea&s;ed with this part, for I had no mind to let him go neither; and yet I had no mind to give him &s;uch hold of me as he would have had; and thus I was in a kind of &s;u&s;pence, ir|re&s;olute, and doubtful what cour&s;e to take.</P>
<P>I was in the hou&s;e with him, as I have ob&s;erved, and I &s;aw evidently that he was preparing to go; and particularly, I found he was remitting money to Paris; I found al&s;o, that I was with child, which was what I had not yet told him of; and &s;ometimes I thought not to tell him of it; but I was in a &s;trange place, and had no acquaintance, though I had a great deal of &s;ub&s;tance, which in|deed, having no friends there, was the more dan|gerous to me.</P>
<P>This obliged me to take him one morning, when I &s;aw him, as I thought, a little anxious about his going, and irre&s;olute; &s;ays I to him, <Q>&startq;I fancy you can hardly find in your heart to&endq; leave me now.</Q></P>

<P>'It is pity &s;o much love,' &s;aid he, 'on both '&s;ides, &s;hould ever &s;eparate.'</P>

<P>'Becau&s;e,' &s;aid he, 'you won't take me.'</P>
<P>'But if I won't take you,' &s;aid I, 'you may 'take me any where, but to Paris.'</P>
<P>He was very loth, he &s;aid, to go any where with|out me; but he mu&s;t go to Paris, or to the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>I told him, I did not u&s;e to court, but I dur&s;t venture my&s;elf to the Ea&s;t-Indies with him, if there was a nece&s;&s;ity of his going.</P>
<P>He told me, God be thanked, he was in no nece&s;&s;ity of going any where, but that he had a tempting invitation to go to the Indies.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, I would &s;ay nothing to that; but that I de&s;ired he would go any where but to Pa|ris, becau&s;e there he knew I mu&s;t not go.</P>
<P>He &s;aid he had no remedy, but to go where I could not go; for he could not bear to &s;ee me if he mu&s;t not have me.</P>
<P>I told him, that was the unkinde&s;t thing he could &s;ay of me, and that I ought to take it very ill, &s;eeing I knew how very well to oblige him to &s;tay, without yielding to what he knew I could not yield to.</P>
<P>This amazed him, and he &s;aid I was plea&s;ed to be my&s;terious; but that he was &s;ure it was in nobody's power to hinder him going, if

he re&s;olved upon it, except me; who had influ|ence enough upon him to make him do any thing.</P>
<P>Yes, I told him, I could hinder him, becau&s;e I knew he could no more do an unkind thing by me, than he could do an unju&s;t one; and to put him out of his pain, I told him I was with child.</P>
<P>He came to me, and taking me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ing me, &s;aid, why would I be &s;o unkind, not to tell him that before?</P>
<P>I told him, 'twas hard, that, to have him &s;tay, I &s;hould be forced to do as criminals do, plead my belly; and that I thought I had given him te&s;ti|monies enough of an affection equal to that of a wife; if I had not only lain with bim; been with child by him; &s;hewn my&s;elf unwilling to part with him; but offered to go the Ea&s;t-Indies with him; and except one thing that I could not grant, what could he a&s;k more?</P>
<P>He &s;tood &s;ilent a good while; but afterwards told me, he had a great deal more to &s;ay, if I could a&s;&s;ure him, that I would not take ill what|ever freedom he might u&s;e with me in his di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I told him he might u&s;e any freedom he plea&s;ed with me; for a woman who had given leave to &s;uch freedoms as I had done, had left her&s;elf but little room to take any thing ill, let it be what it would.</P>

of refu&s;ing him, which he owned he could not for|give me &s;o heartily as he &s;hould do, becau&s;e he was &s;atisfied it was an injury to my&s;elf; and to remem|ber, that, if my mind &s;hould alter, I had a fa&s;t friend at Paris, who would not upbraid me with the unkind things pa&s;t, but would be always ready to return me good for evil.</P>
<P>This letter moved me much, and I cried for &s;everal hours after, almo&s;t without cea&s;ing about it; and yet, even all this while, whatever it was that bewitched me, I had not one &s;erious wi&s;h that I had taken him. I wi&s;hed heartily indeed, that I could have kept him with me; but I had a mor|tal aver&s;ion to marrying him, or indeed any body el&s;e; but formed a thou&s;and wild notions in my head, that I was yet gay enough, and young and hand&s;ome enough to plea&s;e a man of quality here|after, if I &s;hould chu&s;e to change my condition.</P>
<P>Thus, blinded by my own vanity, I threw away the opportunity I then had, to have effectually &s;ettled my fortunes, and &s;ecured them for this world; and I am a memorial to all that &s;hall read my &s;tory, a &s;tanding monument of the madne&s;s and di&s;traction which pride and infatuations from hell runs us into; how ill our pa&s;&s;ions guide us; and how dangerou&s;ly we act, when we follow the dictates of an ambitious mind.</P>
<P>I was rich, beautiful, and as agreeable as ever; I had known &s;omething of the influence I had had upon the fancies of men, even of the highe&s;t rank. I knew I could make a figure at London, and how well I could grace that figure. But I go back to my immediate circum&s;tances at this time.</P>
<P>I got over the ab&s;ence of Mr. Vandunc but &s;lowly at fir&s;t, but it wore off gradually; and as I had a pretty deal of bu&s;ine&s;s for managing my ef|fects,
<PB N="180" REF="194">
the hurry of that particular &s;erved to divert my thoughts, and, in part, to wear out the impre&s;|&s;ions which had been made upon my mind.</P>
<P>I had &s;old my jewels, all but the fine diamond ring, as al&s;o the diamond necklace, which the Prince had given me, and a pair of extraordinary ear-rings. So that I had in ready money, and in account in the bank at Am&s;terdam, above one and twenty thou&s;and pi&s;toles, and how to get this trea&s;ure to England was my greate&s;t concern.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;pent nine months in Holland; re|fu&s;ed the be&s;t offer ever woman in my circum&s;tances had; parted unkindly, and, indeed, barbarou&s;ly with the be&s;t friend, and hone&s;te&s;t man in the world; got all my money in my pocket, and a child within me; I took &s;hipping at the Brill, in the packet-boat, and arrived &s;afe at Harwich, where my woman Amy was come, by my directions, to meet me with a coach and four hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Here, after Amy giving me a plea&s;ing account of my children, and how much they were grown, &s;he told me &s;he had obeyed my commands, in taking elegant lodgings in Pall-Mall; and had hired me two maids, and a footman, who &s;he had put in livery, according to my orders. So having nothing to do at Harwich, I came away for Lon|don, with Amy, to my lodgings, where I arrived in very good health, and where I pa&s;&s;ed for a French lady.</P>
<P>As Amy was the mo&s;t faithful creature living to me, as the reader is well acquainted with, and knew all my &s;ecrets but one; I told her in my journey from Harwich to London, of that one al&s;o; viz. my intrigue with Mr. Vandunc, the Dutch Merchant, and what he had offered, and what condition I was in.</P>
<P><Q><PB N="181" REF="195">
&startq;Amy,' &s;ays I, 'as &s;oon as I conveniently can, I will &s;end you to take lodgings for me at Hackney, where I will pa&s;s for a merchant's lady, who is lately come from Paris, and that you only &s;hall attend me there, until I am up again; and the whole to be concealed, both from my children, and the &s;ervants; and, to account for &s;o long an ab&s;cence, they &s;hall be told that we are both going to York and Scar|borough.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The next morning after I came to London, I went with Amy, unknown to my other &s;ervants, to &s;ee my children, and after many endearments on both &s;ides, I could not refrain from weeping; but, I confe&s;s, they were tears of joy, for I could not help admiring the beauty of my elde&s;t daugh|ter, a woman grown, and as fine a figure as I had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>In about two months I &s;ent my woman, Amy, to Hackney, concerning the bu&s;ine&s;s I have before mentioned, where I had a very convenient and neat fir&s;t-floor; with re&s;pectful and polite u&s;age from the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, a young widow, a very fine woman, and extremely engaging, both in her per&s;on and manners; with this plea&s;ant companion, I pa&s;&s;ed away many agreeable hours, during my continuance with her, which may be ea&s;ily accounted for; I &s;taying chiefly at home, and being not only her lodger, but her boarder al&s;o.</P>
<P>When I had been there about three weeks, I was brought to bed of a fine boy, and, according to my promi&s;e, &s;ent an account of it to Mr. Van|dunc, the father of it; and in my letter, told him how &s;orry I was for his going away, and did as good as intimate, that if he would come once more
<PB N="182" REF="196">
to &s;ee me, I &s;hould u&s;e him better than I had done. He gave me a very kind and obliging an&s;wer, but took not the lea&s;t notice of what I had &s;aid of his coming over, which was as ab&s;olute a denial to me, as he was able to give; &s;o I &s;at down, I can|not &s;ay contented, but vexed heartily that I had ever made him the offer, for he had, as I may &s;ay, his full revenge of me, in &s;corning to an&s;wer, and to let me a&s;k that of him, which he with &s;o much importunity begged of me before.</P>
<P>When my month was expired, I acquainted my good-natured widow, the time was drawing nigh that I &s;hould do a violence to my&s;elf in the making preparations for my removal to London. This oc|ca&s;ioned many polite compliments to pa&s;s between us; and though &s;uch compliments were highly agreeable to our&s;elves at the time; yet they would, if related on paper, afford the reader but little &s;a|tisfaction now; for which rea&s;on I &s;hall take the liberty to omit them.</P>
<P>As I paid the widow to the extent of her expec|tations, &s;he very affectionately &s;aid, at our parting, <Q>&startq;I hope, my lady, that though this is the fir&s;t, it will not be the la&s;t time that I &s;hall have the ho|nour of your Lady&s;hip's commands.' I an&s;wered, Your behaviour, Mrs. Willis, has been &s;o extreme|ly kind and engaging, that I &s;hall be an enemy to my own happine&s;s to forget it.&endq;</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Here the Name of Roxana was acquired.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WAS now returned to my lodgings in Pall-Mall; and here I began to make a figure &s;uit|able to my e&s;tate; and I &s;hall give you an account of my equipage in a few words, and of my&s;elf too.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="197">
I paid a hundred pound a year for my new apart|ments. They were hand&s;ome lodgings indeed, and very richly furni&s;hed. My equipage was hand|&s;ome, but not very great. I had a coach, a coach|man, a footman, my woman Amy, who I now dre&s;&s;ed and made her my companion, and three maids. I dre&s;&s;ed to the height of every mode; went extremely rich in cloaths and jewels. I gave a very good livery laced with &s;ilver, and as rich as could be &s;een. And thus I appeared, leaving the world to gue&s;s who or what I was.</P>
<P>I walked &s;ometimes in the Mall with my wo|man, Amy; but I kept no company, and made no acquaintances, only made as gay a &s;how as I was able to do, and that upon all occa&s;ions. I found, however, the world was not altogether &s;o unconcerned about me, as I &s;eemed to be about them. And fir&s;t, I under&s;tood that the neighbours began to be mighty inqui&s;itive about me; as who I was? and what my circum&s;tances were?</P>
<P>Amy was the only per&s;on that could an&s;wer their curio&s;ity, or give any account of me, and took care to do that with all the art that &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of. She let them know, that I was the widow of a per&s;on of quality in France; that I was very rich; that I came over hither to look after an e&s;tate that fell to me by &s;ome of my rela|tions who died here; that I was worth fifty thou|&s;and pounds, all in my own hands.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found my&s;elf thronged with admirers, and I received vi&s;its from &s;ome per&s;ons of very great figure, who always introduced them&s;elves by the help of an old Lady or two, who were now become my intimates. The&s;e Ladies were too old to intrigue them&s;elves; at lea&s;t, I think they were too old for a bri&s;k young fellow to in|trigue
<PB N="184" REF="198">
with them, unle&s;s he was amply paid for it. And one of them, I under&s;tood afterwards, was &s;et to work on purpo&s;e to get into my favour, in order to introduce what followed.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation we had, was generally court|ly, but civil; at length, &s;ome Gentlemen propo&s;ed to play, and made, what they called, a party. This it &s;eems, was a contrivance of one of my female hangers-on, for, as I &s;aid, I had two of them, who thought this was the way to introduce people as often as &s;he plea&s;ed, and &s;o indeed it was. They played high, and &s;tayed late, but begged my pardon, only a&s;ked leave to make an appointment for the next night. I was as gay, and as well plea&s;ed as any of them; and told my Lord Courtly, that &s;eeing they were doing me the honour of diverting them&s;elves at my apart|ment, and de&s;ired to be there &s;ometimes, I did not keep a gaming-table, but I would give them a little ball the next night, if they plea&s;ed; which, they accepted very willingly.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the evening the Gentlemen be|gan to come, when I let them &s;ee, that I under|&s;tood very well what &s;uch things meant. I had a large dining-room in my apartments, with five other rooms on the &s;ame floor, all which I made drawing-rooms for the occa&s;ion; in three of the&s;e I had tables placed, covered with wine and &s;weet|meats; the fourth had a table for play; and the fifth was my own room, where I &s;at, and where I received all the company that came to pay their compliments to me. I was dre&s;&s;ed, you may be &s;ure, to all the advantage po&s;&s;ible, and had all the jewels on that I was mi&s;tre&s;s of. My Lord Courtly, to whom I made the invitation, &s;ent me a &s;et of fine mu&s;ic from the Opera-hou&s;e, and
<PB N="185" REF="199">
the Ladies danced, and we began to be merry; when about eleven o'clock I had notice given me, that there were &s;ome Gentlemen coming in ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>A-while after, the ma&s;ks came in, and began with a dance <HI>a la comique,</HI> performing wonder|fully indeed. While they were dancing, I with|drew, and left a Lady to an&s;wer for me, that I would return immediately. In le&s;s than half an hour I returned, dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of a Turki&s;h Prince&s;s; the habit I got at Leghorn, when the Prince de C&mdash;bought me a Turki&s;h &s;lave, as I have &s;aid; the dre&s;s was extraordinary fine indeed; the robe was a fine Per&s;ian, or India dama&s;k; the ground white, and the flowers blue and gold, and the train held five yards. The dre&s;s under it, was a ve&s;t of the &s;ame, embroidered with gold, and &s;et with &s;ome pearl in the work, and &s;ome tur|quois &s;tones. To the ve&s;t, was a girdle five or &s;ix inches wide, after the Turki&s;h mode; and on both ends where it joined or hooked, it was &s;et with diamonds.</P>
<P>The turban, or head-dre&s;s, had a pinacle on the top, but not above five inches, with a piece of loo&s;e &s;arcenet hanging from it; and on the front, ju&s;t over the forehead, was a fine jewel, which I had added to it.</P>
<P>When I came down, the room was full of company: but I ordered the folding-doors to be &s;hut for a minute or two, till I had received the compliments of the Ladies that were in the room, and had given them a full view of my dre&s;s.</P>
<P>But my Lord Courtly, who happened to be in the room, &s;lipped out at another door, and
<PB N="186" REF="200">
brought back with him one of the ma&s;ks, a tall well-&s;haped per&s;on, but who had no name, being all ma&s;ked, nor would it have been allowed to a&s;k any per&s;on's name on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. The per|&s;on &s;poke in French to me, that it was the fine&s;t dre&s;s he had ever &s;een; and a&s;ked me, if he &s;hould have the honour to dance with me? I bowed, as giving my con&s;ent; but &s;aid, as I had been a Mahometan, I could not dance after the manner of this country; I &s;uppo&s;ed their mu&s;ick could not play <HI>a la More&s;que.</HI> He an&s;wered mer|rily, I had a Chri&s;tian's face, and he would venture it, that I could dance like a Chri&s;tian; adding, that &s;o much beauty could not be Mahometan. Immediately the folding-doors were flung open, and he led me into the room. The company were under the greate&s;t &s;urprize imaginable; the very mu&s;icians &s;topped awhile to gaze; for the dre&s;s was indeed exceeding &s;urpri&s;ing, perfectly new, very agreeable, and wonderfully rich.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, led me only a courant, and then he led me to the drawing-room door, when he retired to the re&s;t of the ma&s;ks. When he left me at the drawing-room door, I did not go in, as he thought I would have done, but turned about and &s;howed my&s;elf to the whole room; and calling my woman Amy to me, gave her &s;ome directions to the mu&s;ick, by which the company pre&s;ently un|der&s;tood that I would give them a dance by my|&s;elf. Immediately all the hou&s;e ro&s;e up, and paid me a kind of compliment, by removing back every way to make me room, for the place was exceeding full; and I danced by my&s;elf a figure which I learnt in France, when the Prince de C&mdash;de&s;ired I would dance for his diver&s;ion; it was in|deed a very fine figure, invented by a famous
<PB N="187" REF="201">
ma&s;ter at Paris, for a Lady or a Gentleman to dance &s;ingly; and being perfectly new, it plea&s;ed the company exceedingly, and they all thought it had been Turki&s;h.</P>
<P>At the fini&s;hing the dance the company clapped, and almo&s;t &s;houted; and one of the Gentlemen cryed out, 'Roxana! Roxana!' with an oath; upon which fooli&s;h accident I had the name of Roxana fixed upon me all over the town, as effec|tually as if I had been chri&s;tened Roxana. I had, it &s;eems, the felicity of plea&s;ing every body that night, to an extreme; and my ball, but e&s;pecially my dre&s;s, was the chat of the town for that week, and &s;o the name Roxana was the to$&s;t at, and about the Court; no other health was to be named with it.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen ma&s;ked went off about three o'clock in the morning; the other Gentlemen &s;at down to play; the mu&s;ick held it out; and &s;ome of the Ladies were dancing at &s;ix in the morning.</P>
<P>But I was mighty eager to know who it was danced with me. Some of the Lords went &s;o far as to tell me, I was very much honoured in my company; one of them &s;poke &s;o broad, as almo&s;t to &s;ay it was the King; but to this hour I never knew po&s;itively who it was; and by his behaviour I thought he was too young; his Maje&s;ty being at that time in an age that might be di&s;covered from a young per&s;on, even in his dancing.</P>
<P>Be that as it would, I had five hundred guineas &s;ent me the next morning, and the me&s;&s;enger was ordered to tell me, that the per&s;ons who &s;ent it, de|&s;ired a ball again at my lodgings on the next Tue&s;day, but that they would have my leave to
<PB N="188" REF="202">
give the entertainment them&s;elves. I was mighty well plea&s;ed with this, but very inqui&s;itive to know who the money came from. But the me&s;|&s;enger was &s;ilent as to that point; and bowing always at my enquiries, begged me to a&s;k no que&s;tions which he could not give an obliging an&s;wer to.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention that the Gentlemen that played, gave a hundred guineas to the box, and at the end of their play, they a&s;ked for my Gentlewoman of the bed-chamber, as they called her, Mrs. Amy, and gave it her; and gave twenty guineas more among the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The&s;e magnificent doings equally both plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed me; but e&s;pecially, the notion of the King being the per&s;on that danced with me, puffed me up to that degree, that I not only did not know any-body el&s;e, but indeed, was very far from knowing my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I had now the next Tue&s;day to provide for the like company; but alas! it was all taken out of my hand. Three Gentlemen, who yet were, it &s;eems, but &s;ervants, came the next day, and bringing &s;ufficient te&s;timonies that they were right, for one was the &s;ame who brought the five hundred guineas; I &s;ay, three of them came, and afterwards they &s;ent in all &s;orts of wines, and hampers of &s;weet-meats to &s;uch a quantity, it appeared they de&s;igned to hold the trade on more than once, and that they would furni&s;h every thing to a profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day there came &s;uch an appearance of Quality, that my apartments were by no means able to receive them; and tho&s;e who in paricular appeared as principals, gave order below, to let no
<PB N="189" REF="203">
more company come up. The &s;treet was full of coaches with coronets, and chairs; and in &s;hort, it was impo&s;&s;ible to receive the company. I kept my little room, as before, and the dancers filled the great room; all the drawing-rooms al&s;o were filled, and three other rooms below-&s;tairs, which were not mine.</P>
<P>That the King was at this a&s;&s;embly was out of que&s;tion with me, by circum&s;tances that I could not be deceived in; and particularly, that there were five per&s;ons who were not ma&s;ked, three of them had blue garters, and they appeared not to me till I came out to dance.</P>
<P>This meeting was managed ju&s;t as the fir&s;t, though with much more magnificence, becau&s;e of the company. I placed my&s;elf, exceedingly rich in cloaths and jewels, in the middle of my little room, as before, and made my com|pliments to all the company as they pa&s;&s;ed me, as I did before. But my Lord Courtly, who had &s;poken openly to me the fir&s;t night, came to me, and unma&s;king, told me the com|pany had ordered him to tell me, they hoped they &s;hould &s;ee me in the dre&s;s I had appear|ed in the fir&s;t day, which had been &s;o accep|table, that it had been the occa&s;ion of this new meeting. <Q>&startq;And Madam,' &s;ays he, 'there are &s;ome in this a&s;&s;embly, who it is worth your while to oblige.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I bowed to my Lord, and immediately with|drew. While I was above dre&s;&s;ing in my new habit, two Ladies, perfectly unknown to me, were conveyed into my apartment below, by the order of a noble per&s;on, who, with his family,
<PB N="190" REF="204">
had been in Per&s;ia; and here indeed, I thought I &s;hould have been excelled.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e Ladies was dre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t exqui|&s;itely fine indeed, in the habit of a Virgin Lady of Quality of Georgia, and the other in the &s;ame habit of Armenia, with each of them a woman &s;lave to attend them.</P>
<P>The Ladies had their petticoats &s;hort to their ancles, but plaited all round, and before them &s;hort aprons, but of the fine&s;t point that could be &s;een: their gowns were made with long antick &s;leeves hanging down behind, and a train let down: they had no jewels, but their heads and brea&s;ts were dre&s;&s;ed up with flowers, and they both came in veiled.</P>
<P>Their &s;laves were bare-headed; but their long black hair was braided in locks hanging down be|hind to their wai&s;ts, and tied up with ribbands; they were dre&s;&s;ed exceeding rich, and were as beautiful as their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; for none of them had any ma&s;ks on. They waited in my room till I came down, and all paid their re&s;pects to me after the Per&s;ian manner, and &s;at down on a &s;afra, that is to &s;ay, almo&s;t cro&s;s-legged on a couch made up of cu&s;hions laid on the ground.</P>
<P>This was admirably fine, and I was, indeed, &s;tartled at it. They made their compliments to me in French, and I replied in the &s;ame lan|guage. When the doors were opened, they walked into the dancing-room, and danced &s;uch a dance, as indeed nobody there had ever &s;een, and to an in&s;trument like a guittar, with a &s;mall low-&s;ound|ing trumpet, which, indeed, was very fine, and which my Lord Courtly had provided.</P>
<P>They danced three times all alone, for nobody indeed could dance with them: the novelty
<PB N="191" REF="205">
plea&s;ed, truly, but yet there was &s;omething wild and bizarre in it, becau&s;e they really acted to the life the barbarous country whence they came; but as mine had the French behaviour under the Mahometan dre&s;s, it was every way as new, and plea&s;ed much better.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had &s;hewn their Georgian and Armenian &s;hapes, and danced, as I have &s;aid, three times, they withdrew, paid their compli|ment to me, for I was Queen of the night, and went off to undre&s;s.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen then danced with Ladies all in ma&s;ks, and when they &s;topped, nobody ro&s;e up to dance, but all called out 'Roxana, Roxana.' In the interval my Lord Courtly had brought another ma&s;ked per&s;on into my room, who I knew not, only that I could di&s;cern it was not the &s;ame per|&s;on that led me out before. This noble per&s;on, who was the Duke of&mdash;, after a &s;hort compli|ment, led me out into the middle of the room.</P>
<P>I was dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame ve&s;t and girdle as be|fore; but the robe had a mantle over it, which is u&s;ual in the Turki&s;h habit, and it was of crim&s;on and green; the green brocaded with gold; and my head-dre&s;s varied a little from that I had be|fore, as it &s;tood higher, and had &s;ome jewels about the ri&s;ing part, which made it look like a turban crowned.</P>
<P>I had no ma&s;k, neither did I paint; and yet I had the day of all the Ladies that appeared at the ball, I mean, of tho&s;e that appeared with faces on; as for tho&s;e ma&s;ked, nothing could be &s;aid of them, no doubt there might be many finer than I was. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the habit was infinitely advantageous to me, and every
<PB N="192" REF="206">
body looked at me with a kind of plea&s;ure, which gave me great advantage too.</P>
<P>After I had danced with that noble per&s;on, I did not offer to dance by my&s;elf, as I had be|fore; but they all called out Roxana again; and two of the Gentlemen came into the drawing-room, to intreat me to give them the Turki&s;h dance, which I readily yielded to; &s;o I came out and danced, ju&s;t as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>While I was dancing, I perceived five per|&s;ons &s;tanding all together, and among them, one only with a hat on; it was an immediate hint to me who it was, and had at fir&s;t almo&s;t put me into &s;ome di&s;order; but I went on, received the applau&s;e of the hou&s;e as before, and retired into my own room. When I was there, the five Gen|tlemen came cro&s;s the room to my &s;ide, and coming in, followed by a throng of great per&s;o|nages; the per&s;on with his hat on, &s;aid, 'Ma|'dam Roxana, you perform to admiration;' and &s;aluted me; &s;o pa&s;&s;ing back again through the great room, went away.</P>
<P>About three o'clock in the morning the com|pany began to decrea&s;e: the Ladies e&s;pecially drew away by degrees, and the Gentlemen retired down &s;tairs, where they unma&s;ked and went to play.</P>
<P>Amy waited at the room where they played; &s;at up all night to attend them; and in the morn|ing, when they broke up, they &s;wept the box into her lap, when &s;he counted out to me &s;ixty-two guineas and a half, and the other &s;ervants got very well too. Amy came to me when they were all gone, 'La! Madam,' &s;ays Amy, with a long gaping cry, 'what &s;hall I do with all this 'money?' And indeed the poor creature was half mad with joy.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="207">
There is a &s;cene which came in here, which made my fortune almo&s;t boundle&s;s; &s;o great, enough to &s;atisfy any woman with more vanity, if po&s;&s;ible, than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>A few evenings after the ma&s;querade, his Grace the Duke of&mdash;came to me in private, and ac|quainted me, a certain great per&s;onage, who had &s;een me dance, had honoured him with his com|mands, which, he &s;aid, was to bring me to him; that if I would oblige him in going, it would be highly worth my acceptance.</P>
<P>With this per&s;onage I lived about three years retired, with the greate&s;t harmony and content; at the end of which time, an accident happened which deprived me of this felicity; who, or what he was, my duty, and private vows, oblige me not to reveal.</P>
<P>In about a week after the commencement of this amour, I gave orders to my woman Amy, to pay, and quit the lodgings in Pall-mall directly; go to my children, and &s;ay I was gone to Paris upon extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, concerning &s;ome bills that were unpaid, to the amount of &s;everal thou|&s;and pounds; and that &s;he could not &s;ay when I &s;hould return; and, added, her orders were to follow me. This Amy did &s;o faithfully, that it was never di&s;covered where I was concealed; and they thought I was in Paris the whole time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>Another Incident natural to many Ladies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER the end of this amour, and what I call my retreat, in which I accumulated a pro|digious &s;um, for I had now an e&s;tate of almo&s;t
<PB N="194" REF="208">
three thou&s;and pounds a year; and as I was not in the lea&s;t impaired in beauty, or figure, excepting I was a little lu&s;tier than I was formerly, and as the reader mu&s;t know, without my telling, three years older too; yet I &s;ay I was for health, beauty, and figure, as de&s;irable a woman, as any in the three kingdoms. But, &s;uppo&s;ing I had not had &s;uch an opinion of my&s;elf, which, to be free with you, I really had; yet, the &s;equel will &s;hew, a per&s;on of very great honour, and a per&s;on of a very great e&s;tate too, made me &s;uch an ample offer, that I have many rea&s;ons to think that he thought &s;o, as well as I did.</P>
<P>This nobleman vi&s;ited me a long while, and, in &s;hort, courted me as clo&s;ely and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, as if he had been wooing me to matrimony. He made me &s;everal valuable pre&s;ents, which I &s;uffer|ed my&s;elf to be prevailed with to accept, but not without great difficulty.</P>
<P>Gradually I &s;uffered al&s;o his other importunities, and when he made me a propo&s;al of a compliment, or appointment to me for a &s;ettlement, he &s;aid, that though I was rich, yet there was not the le&s;s due from him, to acknowledge the favours he received; and that if I was to be his, I &s;hould not live at my own expence, co&s;t what it would. I told him, I was far from being extravagant, and yet I did not live at the expence of le&s;s than one thou&s;and pounds a year; that however I was not covetous of &s;ettled allowances, for I looked upon that as a kind of golden chain, &s;omething like matrimony; that though I knew how to be true to a man of ho|nour, as I knew his Lord&s;hip to be, yet I had a kind of aver&s;ion to the bonds. And though I was not &s;o rich as the world took me to be, yet I was
<PB N="195" REF="209">
not &s;o poor as to bind my&s;elf to hard&s;hips for a pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>He told me he expected to make my life per|fectly ea&s;y, and intended it &s;o; that he knew of no bondage there could be in a private engage|ment between us; that the bonds of honour he knew I would be tied by, and think them no bur|then; and for other obligations, he &s;corned to ex|pect any thing from me, but what he knew, as a woman of honour, I could grant; then, as to maintenance, he told me, he would &s;oon &s;how me that he valued me infinitely above one thou&s;and pounds a year; and upon this footing we began.</P>
<P>I &s;eemed kinder to him after this di&s;cour&s;e; and as time and private conver&s;ation made us very in|timate, he acknowledged it as an infinite favour, that I would accept of the thou&s;and pounds a year; and I, that thought it was too much, &s;uffered my&s;elf to be ma&s;tered, or prevailed with, to yield, even on but a bare engagement upon parole.</P>
<P>When he had obtained his end, I told him my mind. <Q>&startq;Now you &s;ee, my Lord,' &s;aid I, 'how weakly I have acted, namely, to yield to you without any capitulation, or any thing &s;ecured to me, but that which you may cea&s;e to allow, when you plea&s;e; if I am the le&s;s valued for &s;uch a confidence, I &s;hall be injured in a manner that I will endeavour not to de&s;erve.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>He told me he would make it evident to me, that he did not &s;eek me by way of bargain, as &s;uch things were often done; that as I had treated him with a generous confidence, &s;o I &s;hould find I was in the hands of a man of honour, and one that knew how to value the obligation; and upon this, he gave me a draught upon his banker for five hundred pounds directly, which, he &s;aid, he gave
<PB N="196" REF="210">
me as a pledge, that I &s;hould not be a lo&s;er by my not having made a bargain with him.</P>
<P>This was engaging indeed, and gave a good idea of our future corre&s;pondence; and in &s;hort, as I could not refrain treating him with more kindne&s;s than I had done before, &s;o, one thing be|getting another, I gave him &s;everal te&s;timonies that I was entirely his own by inclination, as well as by the common obligation of a mi&s;tre&s;s; and this plea&s;ed him exceedingly.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Soon after this &s;ecret engagement, I &s;aid, my Lord, as I have the honour of your Lord|&s;hip's company, it would be more agreeable to me to live in private, as I am de&s;irous of no other ac|quaintance than your lord&s;hip's.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;My dear love,' &s;aid he, and ki&s;&s;ing me, 'you &s;hall have it &s;o; nor can you think how much this conduct of your's engages me.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>In a week he found out a lodging for me in a very hand&s;ome hou&s;e, where he was not known. I &s;uppo&s;e he had employed &s;omebody to find it out for him; and where he had a convenient way to come into the garden, by a door that opened into St. James's Park.</P>
<P>By this key he could come in at what time of the night or day he plea&s;ed; and as we had al&s;o a little door in the lower part of the hou&s;e, which was always left upon a lock, and his was the ma&s;|ter-key, &s;o if it was twelve, one, or two o'clock at night, he could come directly into my bed-cham|ber.</P>
<P>It happened plea&s;antly enough one night. His Lord&s;hip had been out of town for &s;everal days, and I, not expecting him home, had taken Amy to bed with me, and when my Lord came into the chamber, we were both fa&s;t a&s;leep. I think
<PB N="197" REF="211">
it was near three o'clock, he &s;aid, when he came in, and a little merry, but not at all fuddled, or what they call in drink; and he directly came in|to my room.</P>
<P>Amy, when &s;he awaked, was frightened out of her wits, and cried out. I &s;aid calmly, <Q>&startq;Indeed my Lord I did not expect you to-night, and we have been a little frightened with the cry of fire.&endq;</Q>&mdash;<Q>&startq;O!&endq;</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;I &s;ee you have got a bedfellow with you.&endq;</Q>&mdash;I began to make an apology.&mdash;<Q>&startq;No, no,&endq;</Q> &s;ays my Lord, <Q>&startq;you need no excu&s;e, it is not a man-bedfellow I &s;ee;&endq;</Q> but then, talking merrily, he catched his words back;&mdash;<Q>&startq;My dear,&endq;</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;now I think on it, how &s;hall I be &s;atisfied it is not a man-bedfellow?&mdash;O,&endq;</Q> &s;ays I, <Q>&startq;I dare &s;ay your Lord&s;hip is &s;atis|fied&endq; it is none but Amy.</Q> 'Yes,' &s;ays he, laughing, <Q>&startq;it is Amy;' but how do I know what Amy is? it may be Mr. Amy, for ought I know. I hope you will give me leave to be &s;atisfied. '&mdash;' I &s;aid, 'Yes, my Lord, by all means, I&endq; would have your Lord&s;hip &s;atisfied;' but I &s;up|po&s;ed at the time he knew who &s;he was.</Q></P>
<P>Accordingly, he fell foul of poor Amy, and he would know whether Amy was Mr. Amy or Mrs. Amy, and &s;o it &s;eemed he did; for &s;he told me &s;o afterwards, and that he gave her a guinea; and then being &s;atisfied in that doubtful ca&s;e, he walked to the farther end of the room, and went into a little clo&s;et, and &s;at down.</P>
<P>In the mean time Amy and I got up, and I bid her run and prepare the bed in another chamber for my Lord, and I gave her &s;heets to put into it; which &s;he did immediately, and I put my Lord to bed there; and when I had done, at his de&s;ire went to bed to him. I was backward at fir&s;t, and
<PB N="198" REF="212">
made my excu&s;e, becau&s;e I had been in bed with Amy, and had not &s;hifted me, but he was pa&s;t tho&s;e niceties at that time; and as he was &s;ure it was Mrs. Amy, he was very well &s;atisfied, and &s;o the je&s;t pa&s;&s;ed over. But Amy appeared no more all that night, or the next day; and when &s;he did, my Lord was &s;o merry with her upon his eclairci&s;&s;ement, as he called it, that Amy did not know what to do with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I held this &s;cene of life near eight years, reckon|ing from my fir&s;t coming to Pall-Mall; and tho' my Lord found no fault, yet I found, without much examining, that any one who looked in my face, might &s;ee I was above thirty; and yet, with|out flattering my&s;elf, I carried my age extremely well, which was, at the very time, bordering on fifty.</P>
<P>I may venture to &s;ay, that no woman ever lived a life like me, of four and twenty years of wicked|ne&s;s, without the lea&s;t &s;ignals of remor&s;e; without any &s;igns of repentance; or without &s;o much as a wi&s;h to put an end to it. I had &s;o long habituat|ed my&s;elf to a life of vice, that really it appeared to be no vice to me. I went on &s;mooth and plea&s;ant; I wallowed in wealth, and it flowed in upon me at &s;uch a rate, having lived frugally; &s;o that I had, at the end of the eight years, full three thou&s;and pounds coming in yearly, of which I did not &s;pend one penny, being maintained by my allow|ance from my Lord&mdash;, and more than main|tained, by above two hundred pounds per annum; for though he did not contract for a thou&s;and pounds a year, yet he gave me money &s;o often, and that in &s;uch large &s;ums, that I had &s;eldom &s;o little, one year with another.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>Better late than never.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YET, upon the account of &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;&s;es be|tween us, my amour with my Lord began to draw to an end; and indeed, notwith&s;tanding his money, it had la&s;ted &s;o long, that I was much more &s;ick of his Lord&s;hip than he could be of me. He grew old, and fretful, and captious; and I mu&s;t add, which made the vice it&s;elf begin to grow &s;urfeiting and nau&s;eous to me, he grew wor&s;e and wickeder the older he grew; and that to &s;uch a degree, as is not fit to write of; and made me &s;o weary of him, that upon one of his capricious humours, which he often took occa&s;ion to trouble me with, I took occa&s;ion to be much le&s;s complai&s;ant to him than I u&s;ed to be; and as I knew him to be ha&s;ty, I fir&s;t took care to put him into a little pa&s;&s;ion, and then to re&s;ent it, and this brought us to words; in which I told him, I thought he grew &s;ick of me; and he an&s;wered, in a heat, that truly &s;o he was. I replied, that I found his Lord&s;hip was endeavouring to make me &s;ick too; that I had met with &s;everal &s;uch rubs from him of late; and that he did not u&s;e me as he u&s;ed to do; and I begged his Lord&s;hip he would make him&s;elf ea&s;y. This I &s;poke with an air of coldne&s;s and indifference, &s;uch as I knew he could not bear; but I did not downright quarrel with him, and de&s;ire him to quit me, for I knew that would come of it&s;elf; be&s;ides, I had received a great deal of hand&s;ome u&s;age from him, and I was loth to have the breach be on my &s;ide, that he might not be able to &s;ay I was ungrateful.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="214">
But he put the occa&s;ion into my hands, for he came no more to me for two months. Indeed I expected a fit of ab&s;ence, for &s;uch I had had &s;everal times before, but not for above a fort|night or three weeks at mo&s;t. But after I had &s;tayed a month, which was longer than ever he kept away yet, I took a new method with him; for I was re&s;olved now it &s;hould be in my power to continue, or not, as I thought fit. At the end of a month therefore I removed, and took lodg|ings in Ken&s;ington gravel-pits, and left nobody at my hou&s;e but Amy and a footman; with pro|per in&s;tructions how to behave, when his Lord|&s;hip, being come to him&s;elf, &s;hould think fit to come again, which I knew he would.</P>
<P>Here I will take the liberty to digre&s;s a little, and, in&s;tead of proceeding in my own &s;tory, relate an anecdote concerning my woman Amy. I think I have mentioned already in this hi&s;tory, that I made Amy my confidant in all my amours; &s;he in return, for I believe, if &s;he had committed a murder &s;he would not have concealed it from me, told me, while I was retired at my lodgings at Ken&s;ington, my footman, whom I left with her in my hou&s;e in town one night, by her leaving her bed-chamber door unfa&s;tened, which &s;hould be a caution to all women who have any regard to their character, never to be &s;o negligent; this young fellow, he got to bed to her; and when he thought he had made the mo&s;t he could of her, for &s;he acknowledged he had had, at lea&s;t, fifty guineas, which &s;he had given him, and which &s;he told him were all &s;he had; though that, &s;he &s;aid, was only a pre|tence; the fellow, after an amour of near two
<PB N="201" REF="215">
months, had the ingratitude to leave her, and &s;he never heard of him after. I take &s;hame to my&s;elf for this action; for I was &s;o far from be|ing angry with her for her indi&s;cretion, that, on the contrary, I was rather plea&s;ed, for the want of a thorough repentance for my own crimes, that I could find another as wicked as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>But to return to my own &s;tory. About the end of two months, his Lord&s;hip came in the du&s;k of the evening, as u&s;ual. The footman, for now I had another man, an&s;wered him, and told him, his Lady was not at home, but there was Mrs. Amy above. So he did not order her to be called down, but went up into the dining-room. When Amy came to him, he a&s;ked where I was? <Q>&startq;My Lord, my Mi&s;tre&s;s has been re|moved a good while from hence, and lives at Ken&s;ington.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Ay, Mrs. Amy! how came you to be here then?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;My Lord, we are here till quarter-day, becau&s;e the goods are not removed, and to give an&s;wers if any comes to a&s;k for my Lady.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, and what an&s;wer are you to give to me?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Indeed, my Lord, I have no particular an|&s;wer to your Lord&s;hip; but to tell you, and every-body el&s;e, where my Lady lives, that they may not think &s;he is run away.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;No, Mrs. Amy, I do not think &s;he is run away; but indeed, I cannot go after her &s;o far.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Amy &s;aid nothing to that; but made a cur$&s;y, and &s;aid, &s;he believed I would be there again for
<PB N="202" REF="216">
a week or two, in a little time. 'How little 'time,' &s;ays my Lord.</P>
<P>'She comes next Tue&s;day, my Lord,' &s;ays Amy.</P>
<P>'Very well, I will call and &s;ee her then:' and &s;o he went away.</P>
<P>Accordingly I came on the Tue&s;day, and &s;tayed a fortnight, but he came not; &s;o I went back to Ken&s;ington; and after that I had very few of his Lord&s;hip's vi&s;its, which I was very glad of; and in a little time after was more glad of it than I was at fir&s;t, and upon a far better account too.</P>
<P>For now I began not to be &s;ick of his Lord&s;hip only, but really I began to be &s;ick of the vice; and as I had good lei&s;ure now to divert and en|joy my&s;elf in the world, as much as it was po&s;|&s;ible for any woman to do, that ever lived in it; &s;o I found that my judgment began to prevail up|on me to fix my delight upon nobler objects than I had formerly done; and the very beginning of this brought &s;ome ju&s;t reflections upon me rela|ting to things pa&s;t, and to the former manner of my living; and though there was not the lea&s;t hint in all this, from what may be called religion or con&s;cience, and far from any thing of repentance, or any thing that was a-kin to it, e&s;pecially at fir&s;t; yet the &s;en&s;e of things, and the knowledge I had of the world, and the va&s;t variety of &s;cenes that I had acted my part in, began to work up|on my &s;en&s;es, and it came &s;o very &s;trong upon my mind one morning, when I had been lying awake &s;ome time in my bed, as if &s;omebody had a&s;ked me the que&s;tion, what was I a &s;trumpet for now? It occurred naturally upon this enquiry, that at fir&s;t I yielded to the importunity of my circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="203" REF="217">
the mi&s;ery of which, the Devil di&s;mal|ly aggravated, to draw me to comply; for I confe&s;s I had &s;trong natural aver&s;ions to the crime at fir&s;t, partly owing to a virtuous educa|tion, and partly to a &s;en&s;e of religion; but the Devil, and that greater Devil of poverty, pre|vailed; and the per&s;on who laid &s;iege to me, did it in &s;uch an obliging, and I may almo&s;t &s;ay, irre|&s;i&s;tible manner, all &s;till managed by the evil &s;pi|rit; for I mu&s;t be allowed to believe, that he has a &s;hare in all &s;uch things, if not the whole ma|nagement of them. But, I &s;ay, it was carried on by that per&s;on, in &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible manner, that, as I &s;aid when I related the fact, there was no with&s;tanding it. The&s;e circum&s;tances, I &s;ay, the Devil managed, not only to bring me to comply, but he continued them as arguments to fortify my mind again&s;t all reflection, and to keep me in that horrid cour&s;e I had engaged in, as if it were hone&s;t and lawful.</P>
<P>But not to dwell upon that now: this was a pre|tence, and here was &s;omething to be &s;aid, though I acknowledge, it ought not to have been &s;uffici|ent to me at all; but, I &s;ay, to leave that, the Devil him&s;elf could not form one argument, or put one rea&s;on into my head now, that could &s;erve for an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion; why I &s;hould be a pro&s;titute now?</P>
<P>It had for a-while been a little kind of excu&s;e to me, that I was engaged with this old Lord, and that I could not in honour for&s;ake him; but how fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd did it look, to repeat the word honour on &s;o vile an occa&s;ion? As if a woman &s;hould pro&s;titute her honour in point of honour; horrid incon&s;i&s;tency! Honour called upon me to dete&s;t the crime and the man too, and to have
<PB N="204" REF="218">
re&s;i&s;ted all the attacks which from the beginning had been made upon my virtue; and honour, had it been confu'ted, would have pre&s;erved me hone&s;t from the beginning.</P>
<Q>For Hone&s;ty and Honour are the &s;ame.</Q>
<P>This, however, &s;hews us with what faint ex|cu&s;es, and with what trifles we pretend to &s;atisfy our&s;elves, and &s;uppre&s;s the attempts of con&s;cience in the pur&s;uit of agreeable crime, and in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e plea&s;ures which we are loth to part with.</P>
<P>But this objection would now &s;erve no lon|ger; for my Lord had, in &s;ome &s;ort, broke his engagements with me, and had &s;o far &s;lighted me, as fairly to ju&s;tify my entire quitting of him now; and &s;o, as the objection was fully an&s;wered, the que&s;tion remained &s;till unan&s;wered, 'Why am I a 'pro&s;titute now?' Nor indeed, had I any thing to &s;ay for my&s;elf, even to my&s;elf. I could not without blu&s;hing, as wicked as I was, an&s;wer, that I loved it for the &s;ake of the vice, and that I delighted in being a &s;trumpet; as &s;uch, I &s;ay, I could not &s;ay this even to my&s;elf, and alone, nor indeed, would it have been true; I was never able in ju&s;tice, and with truth, to &s;ay I was &s;o wicked as that: but as nece&s;&s;ity fir&s;t debauched me, and poverty made me a pro&s;titute at the beginning; &s;o exce&s;s of avarice for getting money, and exce&s;s of vanity, conti|nued me in the crime, not being able to re&s;i&s;t the flatteries of great per&s;ons; being called the fine&s;t woman both in France and in England; and being care&s;&s;ed by a Prince; the&s;e were my baits, the&s;e the chains by which the Devil held me bound; and by which I was indeed, too fa&s;t held, for any rea&s;oning that I was mi&s;tre&s;s of to deliver me from.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="219">
But this was all over now; avarice could have no pretence. I was out of the reach of all that fate could be &s;uppo&s;ed to do to reduce me; now I was &s;o far from poor, or the danger of it, that I had more wealth than I knew what to do with; when I ruminated on it all in my thoughts, as you may be &s;ure I did often, added weight &s;till to the que&s;tion, as above, and it &s;ounded continu|ally in my head, 'What am I a &s;trumpet for now?'</P>
<P>It is true, this was, as I may &s;ay, &s;eldom out of my thoughts, but yet it made no impre&s;&s;ions upon me of that kind, which might be expected from a reflection of &s;o important a nature, and which had &s;o much of &s;ub&s;tance and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in it.</P>
<P>And &s;urely I am an in&s;tance of the depravity of human nature, to an eminent degree. So &s;oon after my late reflections upon the life which I had lived for upwards of twenty years, to fall into the &s;nare again, &s;eems &s;uch an abominable ab&s;urdity which can &s;carcely be reconciled; but &s;uch is the frailty of man, or, rather the frailty of woman. For happening, on a vi&s;it to a Lady, to be in the company of a young Gentleman, whom I had never &s;een before, I was &s;o &s;truck with his per|&s;on, on his fir&s;t entrance into the room, and after|wards with his behaviour and conver&s;ation, that I was fully convinced I had ever, till then, been a &s;tranger to the pa&s;&s;ion of love; and, to heighten my imaginations, I perceived, in &s;everal in&s;tances, that I was not indifferent to him.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed with the conque&s;t which I thought I had made, or rather the conque&s;t which he had made on me, I was determined, if I could, to &s;ee him again; to obtain which, I exerted all my powers to be as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible; and taking an opportunity as we were &s;tanding at one of the windows together, I &s;poke to him in a low voice,
<PB N="206" REF="220">
that I &s;hould take it as a &s;ingular favour, if he would be &s;o obliging as to be my partner in a dance, at my own lodgings, the next evening; at the &s;ame time giving him privately a card of my addre&s;s. He gave me a bow of a&s;&s;ent, and we took our &s;eats again.</P>
<P>For about an hour, the conver&s;ation of the company was, as u&s;ual, brilliant and polite; but, as it was no ways conducive to the plan of this hi&s;tory, nor might it be agreeable if it was to be related, I &s;hall, therefore, take the freedom to con|ceal it, and keep it to my&s;elf. And immediately after took my leave, the Gentleman fir&s;t taking me by the hand, and leading me to my coach.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, for that was his name, was my partner as de&s;ired; his motions, and &s;teps, in the minuet, were admirable, and plea&s;ed me highly; and when the dance was fini&s;hed, he conveyed me to a &s;eat.</P>
<P>When we were &s;eated, he very gracefully and politely complimented me, and &s;aid, he never met with a Lady who danced any thing like me, and wondered where I had acquired it, and who were my ma&s;ters?</P>
<P>I told him, the rudiments I learned, when a child, in Paris; but that my chief &s;tudy was here, in England; and, added, &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure to merit the approbation of &s;o good a judge, I a&s;&s;ured him, that it would be the means of an additional vanity, and that I thought I had enough of it before.</P>
<P>Finding him plea&s;ed, I did all I could to in|crea&s;e it; and my conver&s;ation with him was ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch terms, with an invitation, as I &s;hould be alone, for him to dine with me the
<PB N="207" REF="221">
next day; that, to a man of his under&s;tanding, I left but little room for him to gue&s;s at my inclina|tions.</P>
<P>Hitherto, every amour or intrigue, that I had ever been concerned in, was on the &s;core of in|tere&s;t only; but this, which I am going to relate, was of another kind.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was a hand&s;ome young fellow, not thirty. He was tall, genteel, and extremely well made; with an expre&s;&s;ion in his countenance which betokened &s;en&s;ibility; of little or no fortune, but a gentleman by birth.</P>
<P>And, that I may not keep you too long in &s;u|pen&s;e, agreeable to my invitation, he came&mdash;he dined&mdash;he &s;upped&mdash;and to tell you a &s;ecret, my kind reader, he &s;tayed&mdash;not by enchantment, not by magick, as &s;ome of the heroes in ancient &s;tory; but by powers more attractive, more agreeable, namely, by his own de&s;ires, his own inclinations; and &s;o long and faithfully too, that you, or any one el&s;e, might have taken a voyage to the Ea&s;t-Indies and back again; I mean in re&s;pect to my|&s;elf; my own behaviour to him. Whether he did &s;o by me, is out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Perhaps, reader, you &s;tartle at the word faith|fully. Why, I do a&s;&s;ure you, with the greate&s;t truth, and &s;incerity, that not only with him, but in every amour with others, I was ever as true and faith|ful to my companion, as the mo&s;t virtuous wife can be to a hu&s;band; nor was I ever &s;u&s;pected to the contrary; and I maintained him in as genteel and affluent a manner, though privately, as he could have maintained me, if I had been his wife, and he had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my whole fortune; I &s;ay privately, for now I kept little or no company, nor did I ever go abroad with him, nor, indeed, did
<PB N="208" REF="222">
I go abroad much with any others, excepting to &s;ee a play, which was not very often, and that was always in company with one of my own &s;ex; and as I lived in lodgings and had the fir&s;t-floor, &s;o, to take off &s;u&s;picion, he rented the &s;econd; by which means he went out when he plea&s;ed, and returned when he plea&s;ed, without any reflection upon me in the whole neighbourhood; nor was it ab&s;olutely known by any in the hou&s;e, excepting my own maid Amy, in whom I could confide; though, perhaps, it might be generally gue&s;&s;ed at by the re&s;t of my &s;ervants; but that I never heard for certain.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid he went out when he plea&s;ed, as indeed he did very often; and he would &s;ometimes be away, though &s;eldom, for two or three days together, for I laid no injunction or re&s;traint on his actions; and though I was extremely fond of his behaviour and conver&s;ation, for they were ever polite and engag|ing; yet I never let him &s;ee, nor did he ever know, either by my expre&s;&s;ions or countenance, that I wi&s;hed him to &s;tay at home, whenever he had an inclination to be abroad. My u&s;ual que&s;tion to him was, with a &s;mile, when I &s;aw him preparing to leave me, by his taking his hat and &s;word, 'My Dear, what time do you think to return?' He, with the &s;ame affability, fir&s;t giving me a ki&s;s, would reply, 'Ju&s;t as it may happen, my dear, 'either to dinner or &s;upper.' Whichever he men|tioned, I knew he would be as good as his word, for he was always extremely punctual. I mention this to &s;hew that he was as engaging in his temper and manners, as he was in his per&s;on; and &s;urely he had every perfection to an eminent degree that any woman can de&s;ire to make her happy; and if &s;he cannot be happy and contented with &s;uch a
<PB N="209" REF="223">
man, I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s what will make her &s;o.</P>
<P>But as all earthly felicities and enjoyments mu&s;t terminate and clo&s;e at la&s;t, a circum&s;tance happen|ed which put a period to my pre&s;ent happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy had been ab&s;ent two days, and the evening of the latter, I gave my maid Amy leave to go to the play. When &s;he came home, &s;he told me, a few minutes before the curtain drew up, &s;he &s;aw Mr. Worthy come with a beautiful young lady, mo&s;t elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, into one of the &s;tage boxes; &s;he added, <Q>&startq;Do not be alarmed, Madam, for I do not look upon it in the light of an intrigue; I am rather inclinable to think it is an affair of court&s;hip, Madam, for his be|haviour to the lady was with a deal of politene&s;s and re&s;pect.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>My not giving an an&s;wer to what Amy had &s;aid, and &s;he looking me full in the face; cried, <Q>&startq;Lord! Madam, what is the matter with you?'&mdash;'Oh! Amy, I am undone!'&mdash;'Heavens forbid, Ma|dam! I wi&s;h I had not told you of this unlucky affair.'&mdash;'I &s;hould have been very angry with you, if you had not, if I had known it from any other per&s;on hereafter; but, I am determined I will not take any notice to Mr. Worthy of what you have &s;aid, for I have that opinion of him he will acquaint me him&s;elf, when I &s;ee him, except it be an intrigue, and that to be &s;ure I, and all the world would expect he &s;hould conceal.'&mdash;'You &s;ay, Amy, the lady is genteel; is &s;he hand&s;ome too?'&mdash;'Both, Madam, though not to &s;o great a degree with your&s;elf; for with|out flattery, I never &s;aw a lady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much. This cannot be called flattery in me, for all who know you &s;ay &s;o, and if they did
<PB N="210" REF="224">
not, I know your mind &s;o well, Madam, that you your&s;elf are of that opinion.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>After Amy had undre&s;&s;ed me, and I was gone to re&s;t, or rather to-bed, for re&s;t I could not get any; it revolved in my mind the tale I had been told. I con&s;idered that if it was, as Amy imagined, an affair of honour, he might have come home as u&s;ual; and in this perplexity of my mind, I con|cluded it, he not coming, to be no other than an intrigue; and though generally people, who are under afflictions, are inclinable to imagine the wor&s;t; yet, I thought, if it was an intrigue, it was the le&s;&s;er evil of the two; there might be an end of that; but if he could &s;ucceed with the lady in the other, by marriage, I knew to me he was lo&s;t for ever; he being a man not only of the &s;tricte&s;t ho|nour, but of con&s;cience too, in every ca&s;e, as well as in that of love.</P>
<P>Still I was unea&s;y: for though it might be as I imagined, it affected me in a double capacity. Fir&s;t in my per&s;on. And, to a woman of my feelings, I &s;hall leave the ladies to gue&s;s. Next, it was at my expence too, for, to him, I was profu&s;e in my boun|ties, whom, I thought, &s;o every way de&s;erving, and, to do him ju&s;tice, he was a charming fellow.</P>
<P>After he was ab&s;ent five days, as I was &s;itting mu&s;ing, and alone in my parlour, I was agree|ably &s;urpri&s;ed with the &s;ight of him who had &s;o lately engro&s;&s;ed my thoughts, and immediately ri&s;ing from my &s;eat, 'My Dear Angel,' &s;aid he, &s;aluting me, 'did not you imagine you had lo&s;t 'me?' I pre&s;&s;ed him eagerly to me, and, &s;haring with him in the &s;alute, I replied, <Q>&startq;No, my Love, why &s;hould you think &s;o now, more than at any other time?'&mdash;'Becau&s;e,' &s;aid he, 'I never de|prived
<PB N="211" REF="225">
my&s;elf of the happine&s;s of your &s;ociety &s;o long before; nor &s;hould I have done it now, if I had not accidentally met with a friend, a Mr. Bennet, who took me to a lady of his acquain|tance, a Merchant's daughter, a Mi&s;s Harpur, who was in company with another lady, a Merchant's daughter likewi&s;e, a Mi&s;s Stanley,&endq; and we all four went to the play together.</Q></P>
<P>As I had never heard him mention this Mr. Bennet, nor ever heard of the names of the&s;e ladies before; it occured to me he had di&s;covered Amy at the play, as well as &s;he had him; that the whole was a mere pretence; and though, by my beha|viour to him, he had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion then, nor ever after, the unea&s;ine&s;s it gave to me, yet I was convinced, in my opinion, that there was an intrigue at the bottom.</P>
<P>I never before this, had the lea&s;t jealou&s;y of any man, nor did I ever give any man cau&s;e to be jealous of me; but, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was at pre&s;ent a little tinctured with the di&s;ea&s;e, from the above &s;u&s;picion only; not that Mr. Worthy had given me any cau&s;e to doubt of the veracity of his &s;tory, but from the &s;tory it&s;elf.</P>
<P>His behaviour, as I have already &s;aid, was always agreeable and engaging to me, as indeed I believe it was to every one he conver&s;ed with; and we lived together in the utmo&s;t harmony; and, as I had never heard any more concerning his friend Mr. Bennet, or of the ladies, I concluded, for it was now above &s;ix months &s;ince the affair of the play-hou&s;e, that I had done him an injury in har|bouring &s;uch a thought, and was determined to make him ample amends, by forgetting it.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="226">
I had not been long in this &s;erenity of mind, before my maid Amy brought me the following letter.</P>

<P>When I had peru&s;ed it, I pulled the bell for Amy; and when &s;he came, 'There,' &s;aid I, pointing to the letter, 'read it.'</P>
<P>As I cannot &s;ufficiently de&s;cribe the anxieties which pa&s;&s;ed in my brea&s;t at that time, I mu&s;t leave it to the minds of my readers to imagine, under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, by what would have pa&s;&s;ed in their own.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="227">
I did not imagine it was po&s;&s;ible for any wo|m$n to be &s;o greatly affected for the lo&s;s of a man, as I was, for &s;everal weeks, for the lo&s;s of Mr. Worthy; and the many reflections which fre|quently occurred to my mind, were reflections rather thrown upon my own conduct, than ca&s;t upon his; for I had not the lea&s;t pretence to com|plain of him, except I may be allowed to call it &s;o, in his marrying a virtuous Lady, with a large fortune; and, where is the man to be found, who would not prefer an honourable engagement with a virtuous woman, and an independency; rather than rely on the favours of the capricious, and fan|ta&s;tick humours of a pro&s;titute?</P>
<P>Here I began again to reflect upon my manner of living. And one morning when Amy was in bed with me, and I had &s;ome of my dulle&s;t thoughts about me, Amy, hearing me &s;igh pretty often, a&s;ked me, if I was not well?</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Yes, Amy, I am well enough; but my mind is oppre&s;&s;ed with unea&s;y thoughts, and has been &s;o a good while.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'Why &s;o, Madam?' &s;ays Amy.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, prythee girl, what &s;ober virtuous Lady, or what family of any character will vi&s;it or be acquainted with me?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, all that is true, Madam,' &s;ays &s;he; 'but how can it be remedied now?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is true Amy, the thing cannot be remedied now, but the &s;candal of it, I fancy, may be thrown off.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Truly,' &s;ays Amy, 'I do not &s;ee how, un|le&s;s you will go abroad again, and live in &s;ome other nation, where nobody has known you, or &s;een you, &s;o that they cannot &s;ay they ever &s;aw you before.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="228">
That very thought of Amy put what follows into my head; and I returned, <Q>&startq;Why, Amy, is it not po&s;&s;ible for me to remove from this part of the town, and go and live in another part, or &s;omewhere in the country, and be as entirely concealed as if I had never been known?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Yes,' &s;ays Amy, 'I believe it might; but then you mu&s;t put off all your equipages, and &s;ervants, coaches, and hor&s;es; change your li|veries, nay, your own cloaths, and if it was po&s;&s;ible, your very face; for you have a face, Madam, that is not ea&s;ily forgotten.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, and that is the way, Amy, and that I will do, and that &s;hortly; for I am not able to live in this manner any longer.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Amy came into this with a kind of plea&s;ure peculair to her&s;elf, that is to &s;ay, with an eager|ne&s;s not to be re&s;i&s;ted; for Amy was apt to be precipitant in her motions, and was for doing it immediately.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well Amy, as &s;oon as you will; but what cour&s;e mu&s;t we take to do it? we cannot put off &s;ervants, and coach and hor&s;es, and every thing; leave off hou&s;e-keeping, and transform our&s;elves into a new &s;hape, all in a moment. Servants mu&s;t have warning, and the goods mu&s;t be &s;old off, and a thou&s;and&endq; things.'</Q> And this began to perplex us, and in particular, took up two or three days con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Amy, who was a clever manager in mo&s;t ca&s;es, came to me with a &s;cheme as &s;he called it. <Q>&startq;I have found it out, Madam. I have found a &s;cheme how you &s;hall, if you have a mind to it, begin, and fini&s;h a perfect entire change of your figure and circum&s;tances, in one

day; and &s;hall be as much unknown, Madam, in twenty-four hours, as you would be in &s;o many years.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Come Amy, let us hear it, for you plea&s;e me mightily with the thought of it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why then,' &s;ays &s;he, 'let me go this af|ternoon, and I will enquire out &s;ome hone&s;t, plain, &s;ober family, where I will take lodgings for you, as for a country Lady that de&s;ires to be in London for about half a year, and to board your&s;elf and a kin&s;woman, that is half a &s;ervant, half a companion, meaning my&s;elf; and &s;o agree&endq; with them by the month.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;To this lodging, if I get one to your mind, you may go to-morrow morning, in a hackney|coach, with nobody but me, and leave &s;uch cloaths and linnen as you think fit; but to be &s;ure the plaine&s;t you have, and then you are removed at once, you need never &s;o much as &s;et your foot in this hou&s;e again, or &s;ee any body belonging to it. In the mean time, I will let the &s;ervants know, that you are going over to Hol|land upon extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, and will leave off your equipages, and &s;o I will give them warning, or, if they will accept of it, give them a month's wages; then I will &s;ell off your fur|niture as well as I can; only take care to let this lodging be in &s;ome remote part of the town, and you may be as perfectly unknown, as if you had never been in England in your life.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This was Amy's &s;cheme; and away Amy went, and was gone five hours. But when &s;he came back, I could &s;ee, by her countenance, that her &s;uc|ce&s;s had been &s;uitable to her pains; for &s;he came
<PB N="216" REF="230">
laughing. 'O Madam! I am &s;ure it will do.' And with that, &s;he tells me how &s;he had fixed upon a hou&s;e in a court in the Minories; that &s;he was directed to it merely by accident; that it was a female family, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e being gone to New-England; and that the wo|man had four children, kept two maids, and lived very hand&s;omely, but wanted company to divert her; and on that very account, &s;he had agreed to take boarders.</P>
<P>Amy agreed for a hand&s;ome price, if I liked them, becau&s;e &s;he was re&s;olved I &s;hould be u&s;ed well; &s;o &s;he bargained to give her ten pound a month, and twelve pound, if we took a maid, and &s;o in proportion for every &s;ervant, leaving that to my choice; and that we might be &s;atisfied we &s;hould meet with nothing very gay, the Gentle|woman, &s;he &s;aid, being a Quaker.</P>
<P>I was &s;o plea&s;ed, that I re&s;olved to go with Amy the next day to &s;ee the lodgings, and to &s;ee the wo|man of the hou&s;e, and &s;ee how I liked them. But if I was plea&s;ed with the general, I was much more plea&s;ed with the particulars; for the Quaker was a mo&s;t courteous, obliging, mannerly per&s;on; per|fectly well-bred, and perfectly good humoured, and, in &s;hort, the mo&s;t agreeable conver&s;ation that ever I met with; and, which was worth all, though grave, yet was plea&s;ant and &s;ociable, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s how I was plea&s;ed and delighted with her company; and particular|ly, I was &s;o plea&s;ed, that I would go away no more; &s;o I even took up my lodging there the very fir&s;t night,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. <HI>An unexpected Incident.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, though it took up Amy almo&s;t a month to put off all the appearances, of hou&s;e-keeping, it need take me up but little time to re|late it; it is enough to &s;ay, that Amy quitted all that part of the world, and came pack and package to me, and here we took up our abode.</P>
<P>I was now in a perfect retreat indeed; remote from the eyes of all that ever had &s;een me, and as much out of the way of being ever &s;een or heard of by any that u&s;ed to follow me, as if I had been among the mountains in Lanca&s;hire; for when did a blue garter, or a coach and &s;ix come into a little narrow pa&s;&s;age in the Minories? And as there was no fear of them, &s;o really I had no de&s;ire to &s;ee them, or &s;o much as to hear from them any more.</P>
<P>I lived here perfectly retired, and with a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and agreeable Lady; I mu&s;t call her &s;o, for though a Quaker, &s;he had a full &s;hare of good breeding, &s;ufficient for her, if &s;he had been a Duche&s;s; in a word, &s;he was the mo&s;t agreeable creature in her conver&s;ation, as I &s;aid before, that ever I met with.</P>
<P>I pretended, after I had been there &s;ome little time, to be extremely in love with the dre&s;s of the Quakers, and this plea&s;ed her &s;o much, that &s;he would needs dre&s;s me up one day in a &s;uit of her own cloaths; but my real de&s;ign was, to &s;ee whe|ther it would pa&s;s upon me for a di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="232">
Amy was &s;truck with the novelty, though I had not mentioned my de&s;ign to her; and when the Quaker was gone out of the room, &s;ays Amy, <Q>&startq;I gue&s;s your meaning; it is a perfect di&s;gui&s;e to you; why you look quite another body, I &s;hould not have known you my&s;elf; nay, Madam, more than that, it makes you look ten years younger than you did.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Nothing could plea&s;e me better than that; and when Amy repeated it, I was &s;o fond of it, that I a&s;ked my Quaker, I will not call her landlady, it is, indeed, too coar&s;e a word for her, and &s;he de&s;erves a much better. I &s;ay, I a&s;ked her, who were here mercer and mantua-maker, for I was &s;o fond of it, that I would have a &s;uit made for me. <Q>&startq;I can &s;oon help thee to both, '&s;ays &s;he: 'for&endq; they live but in the Minories.'</Q> In about a week after they were brought home fini&s;hed, with every article &s;uitable to wear with them.</P>
<P>When Amy had dre&s;&s;ed me, I came down to my Quaker. The moment &s;he &s;aw me, &s;ays &s;he, <Q>&startq;Friend, now thou art one of us, and, I profe&s;s, had not I been at the purcha&s;e of thy garment, I doubt if I &s;hould have known thee; and if thy particular were to come, he would enquire of thee, after thy&s;elf; for, I believe, he would&endq; not have the lea&s;t knowledge of thee.'</Q> Upon this, I went to the gla&s;s, and to be &s;incere with you, I was of the &s;ame opinion, I was &s;o meta|morpho&s;ed; thaugh every thing I had on was the be&s;t that could be got.</P>
<P>This good, though unhappy Quaker, had the misfortune to have a bad hu&s;band, and he was gone beyond-&s;ea. She had a good hou&s;e, and
<PB N="219" REF="233">
well furni&s;hed, and had &s;ome jointure of her own e&s;tate, which &s;upported her and her children, &s;o that &s;he did not want; but &s;he was not at all above &s;uch a help, as my being there was to her; &s;o &s;he was as glad of me, as I was of her.</P>
<P>However, as I knew there was no way to fix this new acquaintance, like making my&s;elf a friend to her, I began with making her &s;ome hand&s;ome pre&s;ents: and fir&s;t, opening my bundles one day in my chamber, I heard her in another room, and called her in, with a kind of familiar way; there I &s;howed her &s;ome of my rich cloaths, and having among the re&s;t of my things, a piece of very fine new holland, I pulled it out: 'Here, Madam,' &s;ays I, 'I will make you a pre&s;ent, if you will accept 'of it.' And with that I laid the piece of holland in her lap.</P>
<P>I could &s;ee &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed, and that &s;he could hardly &s;peak. 'What do&s;t thou mean?' &s;ays &s;he; <Q>&startq;indeed I cannot have the face to accept &s;o fine a pre&s;ent as this;' adding, 'It is fit for&endq; thy own u&s;e, but it is above my wear, indeed.</Q> I thought &s;he had meant &s;he mu&s;t not wear it &s;o fine, becau&s;e &s;he was a Quaker; &s;o I returned, 'Why, do not you Quakers wear fine linen?'</P>
<P>'Yes,' &s;ays &s;he, 'we wear fine linen when 'we can afford it, but this is too good for me.' However, I made her take it, and &s;he was very thankful too: but my end was an&s;wered another way; for by this I engaged her &s;o, that as I found her a woman of under&s;tanding, and of hone&s;ty too, I might upon any occa&s;ion, have a confi|dence in her, which was indeed what I very much wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="234">
By accu&s;toming my&s;elf to conver&s;e with her, I had not only learned to dre&s;s like a Quaker, but &s;o u&s;ed my&s;elf to Thee and Thou, that I talked like a Quaker too, as readily and naturally as if I had been born among them; and, in a word, I pa&s;&s;ed for a Quaker among all people that did not know me. I went but little abroad, but I had been &s;o u&s;ed to a coach, that I knew not how well to go without one; be&s;ides, I thought it would be a farther di&s;gui&s;e to me, &s;o I told my Quaker friend one day, that I thought I lived too clo&s;e; that I wanted air. She propo&s;ed taking a hackney-coach &s;ometimes, or a boat. But I told her, I had always had a coach of my own, till now, and I had a great inclination of having one again.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed to think it &s;trange at fir&s;t, con&s;idering how private I lived, but had nothing to &s;ay when &s;he found I did not value the expence; &s;o in &s;hort, I re&s;olved I would have a coach. When we came to talk of equipages; &s;he extolled the having all things plain: I &s;aid &s;o too. So I left it to her di|rection, and a coach-maker was &s;ent for, and he provided me a plain coach, lined with a light grey cloth, and my coachman had a coat of the &s;ame, and no lace on his hat.</P>
<P>When all was ready, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, and &s;aid; <Q>&startq;Come, I will be a Quaker to-day; and you and&endq; I will go abroad.</Q> Which we did; and there was not a Quaker in town looked le&s;s like a coun|ter&s;eit than I did. But all this was my particular plot to be the more compleatly concealed, and that I might depend upon being not known, and yet need not be confined like a pri&s;oner, and be

always in fear; &s;o that all the re&s;t was only pre|tence.</P>
<P>We lived there very ea&s;y and quiet, and yet I cannot &s;ay I was &s;o in my mind; I was like a fi&s;h out of water; I was as gay and as young in my di&s;po&s;ition, as I was at five and twenty; and as I had always been courted, flattered, and u&s;ed to love it, &s;o I mi&s;&s;ed it in my conver&s;ation; and this put me many times upon looking back up|on pa&s;t things.</P>
<P>I had very few moments in my life, which, in their reflection, afforded me any thing but regret; and while I was &s;urrounded with the&s;e melancholy ideas, a &s;trange adventure happened to me, which I &s;hall here relate. I had been abroad to take the air, as u&s;ual, with my Quaker, as far as Epping-forre&s;t, and we were driving back to London. When on the road between Bow and Mile-end, two Gentlemen on hor&s;eback came riding by, having overtaken the coach, and pa&s;&s;ed it, and went forwards towards London.</P>
<P>They did not ride apace, though they pa&s;&s;ed the coach, for we went very &s;oftly, nor did they look into the coach at all, but rode &s;ide by &s;ide, earne&s;tly talking to one another, and inclining their faces &s;ide-ways a little towards one another; he that went neare&s;t the coach, with his face from it, and he that was farthe&s;t from the coach, with his face towards it, and pa&s;&s;ing in the very next tract to the coach, I could hear them talk Dutch very di&s;tinct|ly: but it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the confu&s;ion I was in, when I plainly &s;aw that the farthe&s;t of the two, him who&s;e face looked towards the coach, was my friend, and old acquaintance, Mr. Van|dunc.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="236">
If it had been po&s;&s;ible to conceal my di&s;or|der from my friend the Quaker, I would have done it; but I fund &s;he was too well acquaint|ed with &s;uch things, not to take the blut. Upon this, &s;he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;Do&s;t thou under&s;tand&endq; Dutch?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why friend do you a&s;k?&endq; &s;aid I.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why,' &s;ays &s;he; 'it is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e that thou art a little concerned at &s;omewhat the&s;e men &s;ay. I imagine they are talking of thee.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Indeed, my good friend, thou art mi&s;taken this time, for I know very well what they are talking of, but it is all about &s;hips, and trading affairs.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well,' &s;ays &s;he, 'then one of them is a man-friend of thine, or &s;omewhat is the ca&s;e; for though thy tongue will not confe&s;s it, thy face does.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I was going to tell a lye, and &s;aid, I knew no|thing of them, but I found it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal it; &s;o I &s;aid, <Q>&startq;Indeed, I think I know the farthe&s;t of them; but I have neither &s;poken to him, or &s;o much as &s;een him for above eleven years.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well then,' &s;ays &s;he, 'thou ha&s;t &s;een him with more than common eyes, when thou did&s;t &s;ee him; or el&s;e &s;eeing him now would not be &s;uch a &s;urprize to thee.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Indeed,' &s;aid I, 'it is true I am a little &s;ur|prized at &s;eeing him now, for I thought he had been in quite another part of the world; and I can a&s;&s;ure you, I never &s;aw in him Eng|land before.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well then, it is more like he is come now on purpo&s;e to &s;eek thee.&endq;</Q></P>

&startq;No, no,' &s;aid I, 'knight-errantry is over; women are not &s;o hard to come at, that men &s;hould not be able to plea&s;e them&s;elves without running from one kingdom to another.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, well,' &s;ays &s;he, 'I would fain have him &s;ee thee for all that, as plainly as thou ha&s;t &s;een him.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;No, but he &s;hall not,' &s;ays I, 'for I am &s;ure he don't know me in this dre&s;s, and I will take&endq; care he &s;hall not &s;ee my face, if I can help it.'</Q> So I held up my fan before my face; and &s;he &s;aw me re&s;olute in that, &s;o &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me no farther.</P>
<P>But, at la&s;t, I confe&s;&s;ed &s;o much, that though I would not let him know who I was, or where I lived, I did not care if I knew where he lived, and how I might enquire about him.</P>
<P>She took the hint immediately, and her &s;ervant being behind the coach, &s;he called him to the coach &s;ide, and bade him keep his eye on that Gentleman, de&s;cribing him, and as &s;oon as the coach came to White-chapel church, he &s;hould get down and follow him clo&s;ely, &s;o as to &s;ee where he put up his hor&s;e, and then to make what enquiry he could, who he was, and where be lived.</P>
<P>The fellow followed diligently to the gate of an inn, and &s;eeing him go in, made no doubt but he had him fa&s;t; but was confounded, when, upon enquiry, he found the inn was a thoroughfare into another &s;treet, and that the two Gentlemen had only rode thorough the inn, as the way to the &s;treet where they were going, and &s;o, in &s;hort, came back no wi&s;er than he went.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>An Interview unexpected.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DURING an interval of near five weeks, I &s;uf|fered a thou&s;and perplexities of mind. I was thoroughly convinced I was right as to his per&s;on, that he was the man; I knew him &s;o well, and &s;aw him &s;o plain, I could not be deceived. Under the pretence of air, I ordered my coach to be ready every afternoon, in hopes of &s;eeing him again, &s;ometimes going one road, &s;ometimes another, but was never &s;o fortunate as to meet with him; till at la&s;t I concluded he was gone back to Paris.</P>
<P>One &s;aturday evening the quaker came to me in the parlour, in a little more hurry than u&s;ual, and joy in her countenance. <Q>&startq;I have found out thy Dutch friend,' &s;ays the, 'and can tell thee how&endq; to find him too.'</Q> Immediately I felt a glow in my face; <Q>&startq;then thou ha&s;t dealt with the evil one, friend,' &s;aid I very gravely. 'No, no,' &s;ays &s;he, I have no familiar; but I tell thee, I have found him for thee, that he is a Dutchman; that he came from Roan; that he lodges with a Mr.
<PB N="225" REF="239">
Cavell, on Lawrence Pountney's-hill, and that&endq; his name is Vandunc.</Q></P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed, you may be &s;ure, not being able to imagine how &s;he could come to know all this. However, to remove my &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he told me &s;he ordered her man to place him&s;elf at the corner of Whitechapel Church-Wall, every &s;aturday in the afternoon, by which means the fellow di&s;covered him. 'Pray let me &s;ee the man,' &s;ays I. After I had que&s;tioned him for &s;ome|time, for the trouble and pains he had taken, I gave him a guinea.</P>
<P>When he was gone, <Q>&startq;Well,' &s;aid I, 'my dear friend, thou art very kind, but this is not worth thy pains; for now I know it, 'tis only to &s;a|tisfy my curio&s;ity.' 'Be that as thou wilt: be|&s;ides,' added &s;he, 'thou art in the right to &s;ay &s;o to me; for, why &s;hould I be tru&s;ted with it? Though if I were, I a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hould not betray thee:' 'That is very kind,' &s;aid I, 'and I believe thee; and a&s;&s;ure thy&s;elf, if I do &s;end to him, thou &s;halt know it, and be tru&s;ted with it too.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Though now I had made the di&s;covery, I was as far to &s;eek what mea&s;ures to take, as I was be|fore; to &s;end to him, or &s;peak to him fir&s;t, if I &s;hould &s;ee him, &s;o as to know him, that I re&s;olved not to do, if I died for it; to watch him about his lodgings, that was as much below my &s;pirit as the other; &s;o that, in a word, I was at a perfect lo&s;s how to act, or what to do as much as ever, as no human invention could bring me to the &s;peech of him, in &s;uch a manner as would &s;uit with my re&s;olutions; and, after all, how did I know what
<PB N="226" REF="240">
his circum&s;tances were? whether married or &s;ingle? and if he had a wife, I knew he was &s;o hone&s;t a man, he would not conver&s;e with me.</P>
<P>In the next place, as he had entirely neglected me, which, in &s;hort, is the wor&s;t way of &s;lighting a woman, I did not know but he might be the &s;ame man &s;till; &s;o I re&s;olved that I could do nothing in it, unle&s;s &s;ome fairer opportunity pre&s;ented, which might make my way clearer to me; for I was determined he &s;hould have no room to put any more &s;lights upon me.</P>
<P>In the&s;e thoughts I pa&s;&s;ed away near three months; at the end of which time, the following &s;cene opened.</P>
<P>One afternoon, my friendly quaker and I &s;itting in her chamber up &s;tairs, and very chearful, chat|ting together, when &s;omebody ringing ha&s;tily, and no &s;ervant ju&s;t then in the way, &s;he ran down her&s;elf, to the door; when a gentleman appears with a footman attending, and making &s;ome apo|logies, who&s;e voice I heard, and who&s;e &s;peech I knew, which &s;he did not thoroughly under&s;tand, he &s;peaking very bad Engli&s;h; he a&s;ked to &s;peak with me, by the very &s;ame name that I went by in her hou&s;e; which, by the way, was not the name that he had known me by.</P>
<P>She, with very civil language, in her way, brought him into a very hand&s;ome parlour below &s;tairs, and &s;aid, &s;he would go and &s;ee whether the per&s;on who lodged in her hou&s;e owned that name, and he &s;hould hear farther.</P>
<P>I was frighted, and ready to die, when my qua|ker came up all gay, and crowing; 'There,' &s;ays &s;he, 'is thy Dutch French Merchant come to &s;ee
<PB N="227" REF="241">
'thee.' I could not &s;peak one word to her, nor &s;tir off of her chair, but &s;at as motionle&s;s as a &s;ta|tue. She &s;aid many plea&s;ant things to me, but they made no impre&s;&s;ion on me; at la&s;t &s;he pulled me, and teazed me, <Q>&startq;Come, come,' &s;ays &s;he, be thy&s;elf, and rouze up, I mu&s;t go down again to him; what &s;hall I &s;ay to him?'&mdash;'Say,' &s;aid I, that you have no &s;uch body in the hou&s;e.'&mdash;'That I cannot do,' &s;ays &s;he, 'becau&s;e it is not the&endq; truth.</Q> Be&s;ides, I have owned thou art above.'</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well,' &s;ays &s;he, 'I'll go and tell him thou&endq; wilt come quickly,' &s;o without giving me time to an&s;wer her, away &s;he goes.</Q></P>
<P>A number of thoughts circulated in my head, while &s;he was gone, and what to do I could not tell. I &s;aw no remedy but I mu&s;t &s;peak with him, but would have given any thing to have &s;hunned it; yet, had I &s;hunned it, perhaps then, I would have given any thing again, that I had &s;een him. Thus fluctuating and unconcluding were my thoughts; what I &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, I declined when it offered it&s;elf.</P>
<P>While I was in this hurry, my friend, the qua|ker, comes up again, and perceiving the confu&s;ion I was in, &s;he runs to her clo&s;et, and fetched me a little plea&s;ant cordial, but I would not ta&s;te it. <Q>&startq;O!' &s;ays &s;he, 'I under&s;tand thee, be not un|ea&s;y, I'll give thee &s;omething &s;hall take off all the &s;mell; if he ki&s;&s;es thee a thou&s;and times, he&endq; &s;hall be no wi&s;er.'</Q> I thought with my&s;elf thou art perfectly acquainted with affairs of this nature, I think you mu&s;t govern me now, &s;o I began to incline to go down with her; upon that, I took the cordial, and &s;he gave me a kind of &s;picey pre|&s;erve
<PB N="228" REF="242">
after it, who&s;e flavour was &s;o &s;trong, and yet &s;o deliciou&s;ly plea&s;ant, that it would cheat the nice&s;t &s;melling, and it left not the lea&s;t taint of the cordial on the breath.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little he&s;itation, I went down a pair of back-&s;tairs with her, and into a dining-room, next to the parlour in which he was; but there I haited, and de&s;ired &s;he would let me con&s;ider of it a little. 'Well, do &s;o,' &s;ays &s;he, and left me with more readine&s;s than &s;he did before; 'do con&s;ider, 'and I'll come to thee again.'</P>
<P>Though I hung back with an aukwardne&s;s that was really unfeigned, yet when &s;he &s;o readily left me, I thought it was not &s;o kind, and I began to think &s;he &s;hould have pre&s;&s;ed me &s;till on to it; &s;o fooli&s;hly backward are we, to the thing which of all the world we mo&s;t de&s;ire; mocking our&s;elves with a feigned reluctance, when the negative would be death to us; but &s;he was too cunning for me, for while I, as it were, blamed her in my mind, for not carrying me to him, though at the &s;ame time I appeared backward to &s;ee him; on a &s;udden &s;he unlocks the folding-doors, which looked into the next parlour, and throwing them open, 'There, friend,' &s;ays &s;he, (u&s;hering him in) 'is the per&s;on, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, thou enquire&s;t 'for;' and the &s;ame moment, with a kind decency &s;he retired, and that &s;o &s;wift, that &s;he would not give us leave, hardly, to know which way &s;he went.</P>
<P>I &s;tood up, but was confounded with a &s;udden enquiry in my thoughts, how I &s;hould receive him? and with a re&s;olution as &s;wift as lightning, in an&s;wer to it, &s;aid to my&s;elf, it &s;hall be coldly;
<PB N="229" REF="243">
&s;o, on a &s;udden, I put on an air of &s;tiffne&s;s and ceremony, and held it for about two minutes; but it was with great difficulty.</P>
<P>He re&s;trained him&s;elf too; on the other hand, came towards me gravely, and &s;aluted me in form; but it was, it &s;eems, upon his &s;uppo&s;ing the quaker was behind him, whereas &s;he, as I &s;aid, under|&s;tood things too well, and had retired, as if &s;he had vani&s;hed, that we might have full freedom. For, as &s;he &s;aid afterwards, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed we had &s;een one another before, though it might have been a great while &s;ince.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;tiffne&s;s I had put on my behaviour to him, I was &s;urpri&s;ed in my mind, and angry at his, and began to wonder what kind of a cere|monious meeting it was to be. However, after he perceived the quaker was gone, he made a kind of a he&s;itation, looking a little round him; 'Indeed,' &s;aid he, 'I thought the lady was not withdrawn,' and with that he took me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ed me three or four times. But I that was prejudic|ed to the la&s;t degree, with the coldne&s;s of his fir&s;t &s;alutes, when I did not know the cau&s;e of it, could not be thoroughly cleared of the prejudice, when I did know the cau&s;e; and thought that even his return, and taking me in his arms, did not &s;eem to have the &s;ame ardour with which he u&s;ed to receive me, and this made me behave to him awkwardly, and I know not how, for a good while.</P>
<P>He began with a kind of an exta&s;y upon the &s;ubject of his finding me out; how it was po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould have been four years in England, and had u&s;ed all the ways imaginable, and could
<PB N="230" REF="244">
never &s;o much as have the lea&s;t intimation of me, or of any one like me; and that it was now above two years that he had de&s;paired of it, and had given over all enquiry; and that now he &s;hould light upon me, as it were, unlooked and un&s;ought for.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily have accounted for his not finding me, if I had but &s;et down the detail of my real retirement; but I gave it a new, and indeed, a truly hypocritical turn. I told him, that any-one that knew the manner of life I led, might account for his not finding me; that the retreat I had taken up, would have rendered it a hundred thou|&s;and to one, that he ever found me at-all; that as I had abandoned all conver&s;ation, and had taken up another name, it was no wonder he had not met with me; that even my dre&s;s would let him &s;ee, that I did not de&s;ire to be known by any body.</P>
<P>Then he a&s;ked if I had not received &s;ome let|ters from him? I told him, No, he had not thought fit to give me the civility of an an&s;wer to the la&s;t I wrote to him; and he could not &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould expect a return, after a &s;ilence in a ca&s;e where I had laid my&s;elf &s;o low, and expo&s;ed my|&s;elf in a manner I had never been u&s;ed too; and that being &s;o ju&s;tly, as I thought, puni&s;hed for my weakne&s;s, I had nothing to do, but to repent of being a fool, after I had &s;trictly adhered to a ju&s;t principle before: That however, as what I did was rather from motives of gratitude, than from real weakne&s;s, however it might be con&s;trued by him, I had the &s;atisfaction in my&s;elf of having fully di&s;charged the debt. I added, that I had not wanted occa&s;ions of all the &s;eeming advance|ments
<PB N="231" REF="245">
which the pretended felicity of a marriage|life was u&s;ually &s;et-off with, and might have been what I de&s;ired not to name; but that, however low I had &s;tooped to him, I had maintained the dignity of female liberty, again&s;t all the attacks, either of pride or avarice; and that I had been in|finitely obliged to him for giving me an opportu|nity to di&s;charge the only obligation that endan|gered me, without &s;ubjecting me to the con&s;e|quence; and that I hoped he was &s;atisfied I had paid the debt, by offering my&s;elf to be chained; but was infinitely debtor to him another way, for letting me remain free.</P>
<P>He was confounded at this, but recovering him|&s;elf a little, he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;I run out in a di&s;cour&s;e he hoped was over and forgotten, and he did not&endq; intend to revive it;</Q> that upon the repul&s;e I had given him in a ca&s;e &s;o circum&s;tanced as his was, and after &s;uch entreaties, and &s;uch offers as he had made me, he went away with a mind heartily grieved, and full of re&s;entment; that he had look|ed back on the crime he had committed, with &s;ome regret, but on the cruelty of my treatment of the poor infant I went with at that time, with the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation; and that this made him un|able to &s;end an agreeable an&s;wer to me; for which rea&s;on he had &s;ent none at all for &s;ome time; but that in about &s;ix or &s;even months tho&s;e re&s;ent|ments wearing off by the return of his affection to me, and his concern in the poor child&mdash;there he &s;topped, and indeed, tears &s;tood in his eyes, while in a parenthe&s;is, he only added, and to this mi|nute he did not know whether it was dead or alive. He then went on, That he had yet taken up his
<PB N="232" REF="246">
re&s;idence here, firmly believing, that one-time or other he &s;hould meet me, or hear of me, and that &s;ome kind chance would at la&s;t throw me in his way; that he had lived thus above four years, and though his hopes were vani&s;hed, yet he had not any thoughts of removing any more in the world, unle&s;s it &s;hould be at la&s;t, as it is with other old men, he might have &s;ome inclination to go home, to die in his own country; but that he had not thought of it yet; that if I would con&s;ider all the&s;e &s;teps, I would find &s;ome rea&s;ons to forget his fir&s;t re&s;entments, and to think that penance, as he called it, which he had undergone in &s;earch of me, an honourable amends, in reparation of the affront given to the kindne&s;s of my letter of invitation; and that we might at la&s;t make our&s;elves &s;ome &s;atisfaction on both &s;ides, for the mortifications pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I could not hear all this without being moved very much, and yet I continued a little &s;tiff and formal too, a good-while. I told him, that before I could give him any reply to the re&s;t of his di&s;cour&s;e, I ought to give him the &s;atisfaction of telling him, that his &s;on was alive; and that, in|deed, &s;ince I &s;aw him &s;o concerned about it, and mentioned it with &s;uch affection, I was &s;orry that I had not found out &s;ome way or other to let him know it &s;ooner; but that I thought, after his &s;lighting the mother, he had &s;ummed up his affec|tion to the child, in the letter he had wrote to me about providing for it; and that he had, as other fathers often do, looked upon it as a birth, which being out of the way, was to be forgotten, as its beginning was to be repented of; that in provid|ing
<PB N="233" REF="247">
&s;ufficiently for it, he had done more than all &s;uch fathers u&s;ed to do, and might be well &s;atis|fied with it.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered me, that he &s;hould have been very glad if I had been &s;o good but to have given him the &s;atisfaction of knowing the poor unfortunate creature was yet alive, and he would have taken &s;ome care of it upon him&s;elf, and particularly, by owning it for a legitimate child, which, where no|body had known to the contrary, would have taken off the infamy which would otherwi&s;e cleave to it; and &s;o the child &s;hould not, it&s;elf, have known any thing of its own di&s;after; but that he feared it was now too late</P>
<P>He added, that I might &s;ee by all his conduct &s;ince that, what unhappy mi&s;take drew him into the thing at fir&s;t; and that he would have been very far from doing the injury to me, or being in|&s;trumental to add <HI>Une Mi&s;erable,</HI> that was his word, to the world, if he had not been drawn into it, by the hopes he had of making me his own; but that, if it was po&s;&s;ible to re&s;cue the child from the con&s;equences of its unhappy birth, he hoped I would give him leave to do it, and he would let me &s;ee that he had both means and affection &s;till to do it; and that, notwith&s;tanding all the mis|fortunes that had befallen him, nothing that be|longed to him, e&s;pecially by a mother he had &s;uch a concern for as he had for me, &s;hould ever want what he was in a condition to do for it.</P>
<P>I could not hear this without being &s;en&s;ibly touched with it. I was a&s;hamed that he &s;hould &s;how that he had more real affection for the child, though he had never &s;een it in his life, than I that
<PB N="234" REF="248">
bore it; for indeed, I did not love the child, not love to &s;ee it; and though I had provided for it, yet I did it by Amy's and had not &s;een it above twice in four years; being privatel re&s;olved that when it grew up, it &s;hould not be able to call me mother.</P>
<P>However, I told him, the child was taken care of, and that he need not be anxious about it, un|le&s;s he &s;u&s;pected, that I had lets affection for it than he had; that, I a&s;&s;ured him, I had made my will, and that I had left it five thou&s;and pounds, and the intere&s;t of it till he &s;hould come of age, if I died before that time; that I would &s;till be as good as that to it; but if he had a mind to take it from me, into his government, I would not be again&s;t it; and to &s;atisfy him that I would per|form what I &s;aid, I would cau&s;e the child to be delivered to him, and the five thou&s;and pounds al&s;o for its &s;upport; depending upon it, that he would &s;how him&s;elf a father to it, by what I &s;aw of his affection to it now.</P>
<P>I had ob&s;erved that he had hinted two or three times, in his di&s;cour&s;e, his having had misfortunes in he world, and I was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the expre&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially at the repeating it &s;o often; but I took no notice of that part yet.</P>
<P>He thanked me for my kindne&s;s to the child, with a tenderne&s;s which &s;hewed the &s;incerity of all he had &s;aid before; and which encrea&s;ed the re|gret with which, as I &s;aid, I looked back on the little affection I had &s;hewed to the poor child. He told me, he did not de&s;ire to take him from me, but &s;o as to introduce him into the world as his own; which he could &s;till do, having lived ab&s;ent
<PB N="235" REF="249">
from his other children &s;o long; for he had two &s;ons and a daughter which were brought up at Nimmeguen in Holland, with a &s;i&s;ter of his, that he might very well &s;end another &s;on of ten years old to be bred up with them; and &s;uppo&s;e his mother to be dead or alive, as he found occa&s;ion; and that as I had re&s;olved to do &s;o hand&s;omely for the child, he would add to it &s;omething con&s;iderable. Tho' having had &s;ome great di&s;appointments, repeating the words, he could not do for it as he would otherwi&s;e have done.</P>
<P>I then thought my&s;elf obliged to take notice of his having &s;o often mentioned his having met with di&s;appointments. I told him, I was very &s;orry to hear he had met with any thing afflicting to him in the world; that I would not have any thing belonging to me, add to his lo&s;s, or weaken him in what he might do for his other children; and that I would not agree to his having the child away, though the propo&s;al was infinitely to the child's advantage, unle&s;s he would promi&s;e me, that the whole expence &s;hould be mine; and that if he did not think five thou&s;and pounds enough for the child, I would give it more.</P>
<P>We had &s;o much di&s;cour&s;e upon this, and the old affairs, that it took up all our time at his fir&s;t vi&s;it. I was a little importunate with him, to tell me how he came to find me out, but he put it off for that time; and only obtaining my leave to vi&s;it me again, he went away; and indeed, my heart was &s;o full with what he had &s;aid already, that I was glad when he went. Sometimes I was full of tenderne&s;s and affection for him, and e&s;pe|cially when he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o earne&s;tly and
<PB N="236" REF="250">
pa&s;&s;ionately about the child; other times I was crowded with doubts about his circum&s;tances; &s;ometimes I was terrified with apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t, if I &s;hould come into a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with him, he &s;hould any way come to hear what kind of life I had led in Pall-Mail, and in other places, and it might make me mi&s;erable afterwards; from which la&s;t thought I concluded, that I had better repul&s;e him again, than receive him. All the&s;e thoughts, and many more, crowded in &s;o fa&s;t upon me, that I wanted to give vent to them, and get rid of him, and was very glad when he was gone.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal meetings after this, in which &s;till we had &s;o many preliminaries to go through, that we &s;carce ever bordered upon the main &s;ub|ject. Once indeed, he &s;aid &s;omething of it, and I put it off with a kind of a je&s;t. <Q>&startq;Alas!' &s;ays I, tho&s;e things are out of the que&s;tion now; 'tis almo&s;t an age &s;ince tho&s;e things were talked be|tween us; you &s;ee I am grown an old woman&endq; &s;ince that.'</Q> Another time he gave a little hint at it again, and I laughed again:&mdash;<Q>&startq;Why, what do&s;t thou talk of,' &s;aid I, in a formal way. Do&s;t thou not &s;ee I am turned quaker? I can|not&endq; &s;peak of tho&s;e things now.'</Q>&mdash;'Why,' &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;Quakers marry as well as other people, and love one another as well; be&s;ides, the Quakers&endq; dre&s;s does not ill become you,' and &s;o je&s;t$d with me again, and &s;o it went off for a third time;</Q> however, I began to be kinder to him in proce&s;s of time, as they call it, and we grew very in|timate.</P>
<P>About a month before this time, I received a dif|ferent account of the death of my hu&s;band, the
<PB N="237" REF="251">
Brewer, that being commanded into the field, up|on an occa&s;ion of &s;ome action in Flanders, he was wounded in battle, and died of his wounds in the ho&s;pital of the invalids.</P>
<P>Mr. Vandunc and I had entered into clo&s;e con|ferences upon the grand affair; and he having cleared up my doubts too, as to his circum&s;tances, and the misfortunes he had &s;poken of, I had gone &s;o far, that we had begun to con&s;ider where we &s;hould live, and in what figure; what equipage; and the like.</P>
<P>I had made &s;ome harangues upon the delight|ful retirement of a country-life, and how we might enjoy our&s;elves &s;o effectually, without the incum|brances of bu&s;ine&s;s; but all this was affectation, and purely becau&s;e I was afraid to make any pub|lick appearance in the world, for fear &s;ome imper|tinent per&s;on of quality &s;hould know me.</P>
<P>Mr. Vandunc, bred to bu&s;ine&s;s, and u&s;ed to conver&s;e among men of bu&s;ine&s;s, could hardly tell how to live without it; at lea&s;t, it appeared he &s;hould be like a fi&s;h out of water, unea&s;y and dy|ing; but however, he joined with me, only argued that we might live as near London as we could; that he might &s;ometimes come to change, and hear how the world &s;hould go abroad, and how it fared with his friends, and his children.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, That if he cho&s;e &s;till to embarra&s;s him&s;elf with bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;ed it would be more to his &s;atisfaction to be in his own country, and where his family was &s;o well known, and where his children al&s;o were.</P>
<P>He &s;miled at the thoughts of that, and let me know, that he &s;hould be very willing to embrace
<PB N="238" REF="252">
&s;uch an offer, but that he could not expect it of me, to whom England was, to be &s;ure, &s;o natu|ralized now, as that it would be carrying me out of my native country, which he would not de&s;ire by any means, however agreeable it might be to him.</P>
<P>I told him, he was mi&s;taken in me; that as I had told him &s;o much of a married &s;tate being a captivity, and the family being a hou&s;e of bondage; that when I married, I expected to be but an up|per &s;ervant; &s;o if I did, notwith&s;tanding, &s;ubmit to it, I hoped he &s;hould &s;ee I knew how to act the &s;ervant's part, and do every thing to oblige my ma&s;ter; that if I did not re&s;olve to go with him wherever he de&s;ired to go, he might depend I would never have him; 'and did I not,' &s;aid I, 'offer 'my&s;elf to go with you to the Ea&s;t-Indies?'</P>
<P>All this while, this was indeed but a copy of my countenance; for as my circum&s;tances would not admit my &s;tay in London, at lea&s;t, not &s;o as to appear publickly; I re&s;olved, if I took him, to live remote in the country, or go out of England with him.</P>
<P>I pretended that I wanted breath when I was in London; but that any where el&s;e I would be &s;atisfied; and then I a&s;ked him, whether any &s;ea|port town in England would not &s;uit him; be|cau&s;e I knew, though he &s;eemed to leave off, he would always love to be among bu&s;ine&s;s, and con|ver&s;ing with men of bu&s;ine&s;s; and I named &s;everal places; but I took care that we would re&s;olve up|on nothing; only by this it &s;eemed to be certain, that we &s;hould live in England.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="253">
It was time now, to bring things to a con|clu&s;ion, and &s;o, in about &s;ix weeks time more, we &s;ettled all preliminaries.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I &s;ettled, by will, ten thou&s;and pounds upon my two elde&s;t daughters, for my other three children by my hu&s;band, Mr. Bacon, were dead; which, upon the decea&s;e of either, was to go to the &s;urvivor: &s;o that this part of my wealth was given away from him. Secondly, I acquainted him with what I had done, that he &s;hould not have hereafter the lea&s;t pretence to &s;ay I had deceived him in that point.</P>
<P>He replied, he was well &s;atisfied, and, in &s;o doing, as I had given a proof of one of my duties as a mother, he had no doubt but I &s;hould fill the re&s;t as a wife.</P>
<P>Having, as I have &s;aid, &s;ettled all our prelimina|naries, we were married the next morning.</P>
<P>Thus I thought my&s;elf &s;ecure, that there was an end to the intrigueing part of my life; a life full of pro&s;perous wickedne&s;s; the reflections up|on which, were &s;o much more afflicting, as the time had been &s;pent in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t crimes, which the more I looked back upon, the more black and horrid they appeared, effectually drinking up all the comfort and &s;atisfaction which I might otherwi&s;e have taken in that part of life which was &s;till before me.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;atisfaction, however, that I took in the new condition I was in, was in reflecting, that at length the life of crime was over; and that I was like a pa&s;&s;enger coming back from the In|dies, who having, after many years fatigues and hurry in bu&s;ine&s;s, accumulated a good e&s;tate, with
<PB N="240" REF="254">
innumerable difficulties and hazards, is arrived &s;afe at home with all his effects, and has the plea&s;ure of &s;aying, he &s;hall never venture upon the &s;eas any more.</P>
<P>When the ceremony was over, we came back immediately to my lodgings, for the Church was but ju&s;t by, and we were &s;o privately married, that none but Amy and my friend the Quaker, were acquainted with it. As &s;oon as we came into the hou&s;e, he took me in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ing me, <Q>&startq;Now you are my own,' &s;ays he; 'O! that you had been &s;o good to have done this eleven years before.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Then,' &s;aid I, 'you, perhaps, would have been tired of me long ago. It is much better now; for now all our happy days are to come.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;O!' &s;ays he, 'I &s;hould not been tired of you; but I will make you pay for it all, now I have you.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I &s;tarted at the&s;e words. <Q>&startq;Ay,' &s;aid I, 'do you threaten already? Pray what do you mean,&endq; my dear?'</Q> And began to look a little grave.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I will tell you,' &s;ays he, 'very plainly what I mean.' And &s;till he held me fa&s;t in his arms. I intend from this time, never to trouble my&s;elf with any more bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o I &s;hall never get one &s;hilling for you, more than I have already; all that you &s;hall lo&s;e one way. Next, I in|tend not to perplex my&s;elf with any of the care or trouble of managing what either you have for me, or what I have to add to it; but you &s;hall even take it all upon your&s;elf, as the wives do in Holland, &s;o you &s;hall pay for it that way too; for all the drudgery &s;hall be yours.
<PB N="241" REF="255">
Thirdly, I intend to condemn you to the con&s;tant bondage of my impertinent company, for I &s;hall tie you like a pedlar's pack at my back, I &s;hall &s;carce ever be from you; for, I am &s;ure, I can take delight in nothing el&s;e in this world.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Very well,' &s;ays I, 'but I am pretty heavy; I hope you will &s;et me down &s;ometimes, when you are weary.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'As for that,' &s;ays he, 'tire me if you can.'</P>
<P>We were very merry the re&s;t of the day; and at night, Amy and the Quaker put us to bed; the hone&s;t Quaker little thinking we had been a-bed together eleven years before; nay, that was a &s;ecret which, as it happened, Amy her&s;elf did not know, until I told her in our journey from Harwich. Amy grinned, and made &s;aces, as if &s;he had been plea&s;ed; but it came out in &s;o many words, when he was not by: the &s;um of her mumbling and muttering was, that this &s;hould have been done ten or a dozen years before; that it would &s;ignify little now; that was to &s;ay, in &s;hort, that I was pretty near fifty, and too old to have any children. I child her. The Quaker laughed; complimented me upon my not being &s;o old as Amy pretended; that I could not be forty, and might have a hou&s;e full of children yet. But Amy, and I too, knew better than &s;he how it was; for, in &s;hort, I was old enough to have done breeding, however I looked; but I bid her hold her tongue.</P>
<P>In the morning my Quaker came and vi&s;ited us, before we were up, and brought us cakes and chocolate; and then left us again, and bid us take
<PB N="242" REF="256">
a nap upon it, which I believe we did; in &s;hort, &s;he treated us &s;o hand&s;omely, and with &s;uch an agreeable chearfulne&s;s, as well as plenty, as made it appear to me, that Quakers may, and that this Quaker did, under&s;tand good-manners, as well as any other people. I &s;ay, &s;he entertained us &s;o ele|gantly the whole week of our wedding, and with &s;uch a profu&s;ion of all &s;orts of delicacies, that in con&s;ideration of the extraordinary expence &s;he had been at, knowing in this ca&s;e, &s;he making a point of it, &s;he would not accept of any thing her&s;elf, that I made her four daughters a pre&s;ent of five guineas each.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. <HI>Benevolence a Virtue.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE lived this week in all the innocent mirth imaginable; and our good-humoured Qua|ker was &s;o plea&s;ant in her way, that it was particu|larly entertaining to us. We had no mu&s;ick or dancing; only I now and then &s;ung a French &s;ong, to divert my hu&s;band, and an Engli&s;h one to divert my friend; and the privacy of our mirth, greatly added to the plea&s;ure of it. I did not make any cloaths for my wedding, having a great many rich cloaths by me, which, with a little altering for the fa&s;hion, were perfectly new. The next day, he pre&s;&s;ed me to dre&s;s, though we had no company. At la&s;t, je&s;ting with him, I told him, I believed I was able to dre&s;s me &s;o, in one
<PB N="243" REF="257">
kind of dre&s;s that I had by me, that he would not know his wife when he &s;aw her, e&s;pecially if any body el&s;e was by: No! he &s;aid, that was im|po&s;&s;ible; and he longed to &s;ee that dre&s;s. I told him I would dre&s;s me in it, if he would promi&s;e me never to de&s;ire me to appear in it before company. He promi&s;ed he would not, but wanted to know why too; as hu&s;bands you know are inqui&s;itive creatures, and love to enquire after any thing they think is kept from them; but I had an an&s;wer ready for him; 'Becau&s;e,' &s;aid I, 'it is not a decent dre&s;s in 'this country, and would not look mode&s;t;' neither indeed, would it, for it was but one degree off from appearing in one's &s;hift; but was the u&s;ual wear in the country where they were u&s;ed. He was &s;atisfied with my an&s;wer, and gave me his promi&s;e never to a&s;k me to be &s;een in it before company. I then withdrew, taking only Amy and the Quaker with me; and Amy dre&s;&s;ed me in my Turki&s;h habit, which I danced in at the ma&s;querade. The Quaker was charmed with the dre&s;s, and merrily &s;aid, That if &s;uch a dre&s;s &s;hould come to be worn here, &s;he &s;hould be tempted, &s;he believed, to try how &s;he would look in it; 'That you may do now,' &s;aid I. 'No, no,' &s;aid &s;he, 'that would be vanity indeed.'</P>
<P>When the dre&s;s was put on, I loaded it with jewels, and in particular, I placed the large brea&s;t-jewel, which he had given me, of a thou|&s;and pi&s;toles, upon the front of the head-dre&s;s; where it made a mo&s;t glorious &s;how indeed. I had my own diamond necklace on, and my
<PB N="244" REF="258">
hair was tout brilliant, all glittering with jew|els.</P>
<P>His picture &s;et with diamonds, I had placed, &s;titched to my ve&s;t, ju&s;t, as might be &s;uppo&s;ed, upon my heart, which is the compliment in &s;uch ca&s;es among the Ea&s;tern people, and all being open at the brea&s;t, there was no room for any thing of a jewel there. In this figure, Amy holding the train of my robe, I came down to him. He was &s;urpri&s;ed, and perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed; he knew me, to be &s;ure, becau&s;e I had prepared him, and becau&s;e there was nobody el&s;e there but the Quaker and Amy; but he by no means knew Amy, for &s;he had dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in the ha|bit of a Turki&s;h &s;lave, being the garb of my little Turk, which I had at Naples. She had her neck and arms bare, was bare-headed, her hair braided in a long ta&s;&s;el hanging down her back; but the jade could neither hold her countenance, or her chattering tongue, &s;o as to be concealed long.</P>
<P>He was &s;o charmed with this dre&s;s, that he would have me &s;it and dine in it; but it was &s;o thin, and &s;o open before, and the weather being al&s;o &s;harp, that I was afraid of taking cold; how|ever, the fire being enlarged, and the doors kept &s;hut, I &s;at to oblige him; and he profe&s;&s;ed, he never &s;aw &s;o fine a dre&s;s in his life: I afterwards told him that my hu&s;band, &s;o he called the jew|eller that was killed, bought it for me, at Leg|horn, with a young Turki&s;h &s;lave, which I parted with at Paris; and that it was by the help of that &s;lave that I learned how to dre&s;s in it, and how every thing was to be worn, and many of the Turki&s;h cu&s;toms al&s;o, with &s;ome of their lan|guage;
<PB N="245" REF="259">
this &s;tory agreeing with the fact, only changing the per&s;on, was very natural, and &s;o it went off with him; but there was good rea&s;on why I &s;hould not receive any company in this dre&s;s, that is to &s;ay, not in England; I need not repeat it, as you may, probably, hear more of it.</P>
<P>But when I came abroad, I frequently put it on, and, upon two or three occa&s;ions, danced in it, but always at his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>We continued at the Quaker's lodgings for above a year; for now making as though it was difficult to determine where to &s;ettle in England to his &s;atisfaction, unle&s;s in London, which was not to mine, I pretended to make him an offer, that to oblige him, I began to incline to go and live abroad with him; that I knew nothing could be more agreeable to him, and that, as to me, every place was alike; that as I had lived abroad without a hu&s;band &s;o many years, it could be no burthen to me to live abroad again, e&s;pecially with him; and I could not but know that his native country, where his children were breeding up, mu&s;t be mo&s;t agreeable to him, and that if I was of &s;uch value to him, I would be there then, to enhance the rate of his &s;atisfaction; that wherever he was, would be a home to me; and any place in the world would be England to me, if he was with me; and thus, I brought him to give me leave to oblige him with going to live abroad, when in truth, I could not have been perfectly ea&s;y at liv|ing in England, unle&s;s I had kept con&s;tantly within doors; le&s;t &s;ome time or other, the di&s;&s;o|lute life I had lived here, &s;hould have come to be known, and all tho&s;e wicked things have been
<PB N="246" REF="260">
known too, which I now began to be very much a&s;hamed of.</P>
<P>When we clo&s;ed up our wedding week, in which our Quaker had been &s;o very hand&s;ome to us, I told him how much I thought we were obliged to her for her generous carriage to us; how &s;he had acted the kinde&s;t part through the whole, and what a faithful friend &s;he had been to me upon all occa&s;ions; and then letting him know a little of her family unhappine&s;&s;es, I propo&s;ed, that I thought I not only ought to be grateful to her, but really to do &s;omething extraordinary for her, towards making her ea&s;y in her affairs; and I added, that I had no hangers-on, that &s;hould trouble him; that there was nobody belonging to me, but what was thoroughly provided for, and that if I did &s;omething for this hone&s;t woman, that was con&s;iderable, it &s;hould be the la&s;t gift I would give to any body in the world but Amy; and as for her, we were not going to part with, but whenever any thing offered for her, we would do as we &s;aw cau&s;e; that Amy was not poor; that &s;he had &s;aved between &s;even and eight hundred pounds; by the way I did not tell him how, and by what means &s;he had got it, but that &s;he had it; and that was enough to let him know &s;he would never be in want of us.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band was exceedingly plea&s;ed with my di&s;cour&s;e about the Quaker, made a kind of &s;peech to me upon the &s;ubject of gratitude; told me, it was one of the brighte&s;t parts of a Lady; that it was &s;o twi&s;ted with hone&s;ty, nay, and even with religion too, that he que&s;tioned whether either of them could be found, where gratitude was not to
<PB N="247" REF="261">
be found; that in this act there was not only gra|titude, but charity; and that to make charity &s;till more Chri&s;tian-like, the object too had real merit to attract it; he therefore agreed to my propo&s;al with chearfulne&s;s, only would have had me let him pay it out of his effects.</P>
<P>I told him, as for that, I did not de&s;ign, what|ever I had &s;aid formerly, that we &s;hould have two pockets; and that though I had talked to him of being a free woman, and an independant, and he had offered and promi&s;ed that I &s;hould keep all my own e&s;tate in my own hands; yet, that &s;ince I had taken him, I would even do as other ho|ne&s;t wives did, where I thought fit to give my&s;elf, I &s;hould give what I had too; that if I re&s;erved any thing, it &s;hould be only in ca&s;e of mortality, and that I might divide it between his children and my own afterwards, as my own gift; and that, in &s;hort, if he thought fit to join &s;tocks, we would &s;ee what &s;trength we could both make up in the world, and bringing it all together, con&s;ider, before we re&s;olved upon the place of removing, how we &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of what we had, as well as of our&s;elves. This di&s;cour&s;e was too obliging, and he too much a man of &s;en&s;e, not to receive it as it was meant; he only an&s;wered, we would do in that as we &s;hould both agree; but the thing under our pre&s;ent care, was to &s;hew not gratitude only, but charity and affection too, to our kind friend the Quaker; and would willingly have left it to me. But I told him I thought it would come better from him&s;elf, and whatever he approved of. I &s;hould approve. He then &s;aid, he would make her a pre&s;ent of a pur&s;e of a hundred guineas, as
<PB N="248" REF="262">
an earne&s;t of his intentions, and &s;ettle upon her, but in &s;uch a manner, as not to be in the power of any per&s;on to reach, but her&s;elf, forty pounds per an$um for her life, &s;ecured any way as &s;he &s;hould de&s;ire. This was a great kindne&s;s, and, indeed, &s;hewed the generous principles of my hu&s;band, and for that rea&s;on I mention it.</P>
<P>In the evening, when we were ju&s;t going to bed, he took my Quaker by the hand, and with a ki&s;s, told her, that we had been very kindly treated by her from the beginning of this affair, and his wife before, as &s;he had informed him; and that he thought him&s;elf bound to let her &s;ee, that &s;he had obliged friends who knew how to be grateful; that for his part of the obligation, he de|&s;ired &s;he would accept of that, for an acknow|ledgment in part only, putting the pur&s;e into her hand, and that his wife would talk with her about what farther he had to &s;ay to her; and upon that, not giving her time to reply, away he went up &s;tairs into our bedchamber, leaving her confu&s;ed, and not knowing what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>When he was gone, &s;he began to make to me very hand&s;ome and obliging repre&s;entations of her good-will to us both, but that it was without expectation of reward; that I had given her &s;everal valuable pre&s;ents before, and how &s;he was obliged by me on many other occa&s;ions; that &s;he was not in condition to &s;how her gratitude any other way, not being able to make a &s;uitable return; and that now we took from her all op|portunity to ballance my former friend&s;hip, and left her more in debt than &s;he was before: &s;he &s;poke this in a very good kind of a manner, in
<PB N="24" REF="263">
her own way, but which was very agreeable in|deed, and had as much apparent &s;incerity, and I verily believe as real, as was po&s;&s;ible to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed; but I put a &s;top to it, and bid her &s;ay no more, but accept of what my hu&s;band had given her, which was but in part, as &s;he had heard him &s;ay; and <Q>&startq;Put it up,' &s;ays I, 'and come and &s;it down here, and give me leave to &s;ay &s;omething el&s;e to you on the &s;ame head, which Mr. Vandunc and I have &s;ettled between&endq; our&s;elves, in your behalf.</Q></P>
<P>'What do&s;t thee mean?' &s;aid &s;he, and blu&s;h'd, and looked &s;urpri&s;ed, but did not &s;tir; &s;he was going to &s;peak again, but I interrupted her, and told her, &s;he &s;hould make no more apologies of any kind whatever, for I had better things than all this to talk to her of; &s;o I went on, and told her, that as &s;he had been &s;o friendly and kind to us on every occa&s;ion; and that her hou&s;e was the lucky place where we came together; and that &s;he knew I was, from her own mouth, acquainted in part, with her circum&s;tances, we were re&s;olved &s;he &s;hould be the better for us as long as &s;he lived: Then I told her what we had re&s;olved to do for her, and that &s;he had nothing more to do, but to con&s;ult with me how it &s;hould be effectually &s;e|cured for her, di&s;tinct from any of the effects which were her hu&s;band's: and that if her hu&s;|band did &s;o &s;upply her, that &s;he could live com|fortably, and not want it for bread, or other ne|ce&s;&s;aries, &s;he &s;hould not make u&s;e of it, but lay up the income of it, and add it every year to the principal, &s;o to encrea&s;e the annual payment, which in time, and perhaps before &s;he might
<PB N="250" REF="264">
come to want it, might double it&s;elf; that we were very willing whatever &s;he &s;hould &s;o lay up, &s;hould be to her&s;elf, and whoever &s;he thought fit after her; but that the forty pound a year, mu&s;t re|turn to our famly, after her life; which we both wi&s;hed might be long and happy.</P>
<P>Let no reader wonder at my extraordinary concern for this poor woman; or at my giving my bounty to her a place in this account; it is not, I a&s;&s;ure you, to make a pageantry of my charity, or to value my&s;elf upon the greatne&s;s of my &s;oul, that &s;hould give in &s;o profu&s;e a manner; but there was another &s;pring from whence all flow'd, and it is on that account I &s;peak of it: Was it po&s;&s;ible I could think of a poor de&s;olate woman with four children, and her hu&s;band gone from her, and perhaps good for little if he had &s;tayed; I &s;ay, was I, that had ta&s;ted &s;o deep of the &s;orrows of &s;uch a kind of widowhood, able to look on her, and think of her circum|&s;tances, and not be touched in an uncommon manner? No, I never looked on her, and her fa|mily, though &s;he was not left &s;o helple&s;s and friendle&s;s as I had been, without remembring my own condition, as the reader already knows; nor could I look on her children, though not poor and peri&s;hing, like mine, without tears; reflect|ing on the dreadful condition that mine were re|duced to, when poor Amy &s;ent them all to their aunt's, and ran away and left them there; the&s;e were the original &s;prings, or fountain-head, from whence my affectionate thoughts were moved to a&s;&s;i&s;t this amiable woman.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, was, however, the &s;pring of my concern for this hone&s;t, friendly and grateful
<PB N="251" REF="265">
Quaker, and as I had &s;o plentiful a fortune in the world, I re&s;olved &s;he &s;hould ta&s;te the fruit of her kind u&s;age to me, in a manner that &s;he could not expect.</P>
<P>All the while I talked to her, I &s;aw the di&s;|order of her mind; the &s;udden joy was too much for her, and &s;he coloured, trembled, changed, and at la&s;t grew pale, and was indeed near faint|ing; when &s;he ha&s;tily rung a little bell for her maid, who, coming in immediately, &s;he beckoned to her, for &s;peak &s;he could not, to fill her a gla&s;s of wine, but &s;he had no breath to take it in, and was almo&s;t choaked with that which &s;he took in her mouth. I &s;aw &s;he was ill, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her what I could, and with &s;pirits and things to &s;mell to, ju&s;t kept her from fainting, When &s;he beck|oned to her maid to withdraw, and immediately bur&s;t out in crying, and that relieved her. When &s;he recovered her&s;elf a little, &s;he flew to me, and throwing her arms about my neck, 'O!' &s;ays &s;he, 'thou ha&s;t almo&s;t killed me;' and there &s;he hung, laying her head in my neck for &s;everal minutes, not able to &s;peak, but &s;obbing like a child that had been whipped.</P>
<P>Nor did our kindne&s;s to the Quaker end with the forty pound a year, for we were always, while we &s;tayed with her, giving her one good thing or another; and in&s;tead of lodging with her, &s;he boarded with us, for I kept the hou&s;e, and &s;he and all her family eat and drank with us, and yet we paid her the rent of the hou&s;e too; in &s;hort, I remembered my widowhood, and I made this widow's heart glad many a day the more, upon that account.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="266">
And now my hu&s;band and I began to think of going over to Holland, where I had propo&s;ed to him to live, and in order to &s;ettle all the pre|liminaries of our future manner of living, I began to draw in my effects, &s;o as to have them all at command, upon whatever occa&s;ion we thought fit; after which, one morning I called Mr. Vandune up to me; 'My dear,' &s;aid I to him, 'there they are, take all that I have got;' and threw them down upon the table, my &s;everal &s;ecurities upon e&s;tates, which I had upon mort|gages, with the re&s;t of my writings which I had purcha&s;ed! and when they were &s;ummed up, they amounted to above forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>But let nobody conclude, from the &s;trange &s;uc|ce&s;s I met with in all my wicked doings, and the va&s;t e&s;tate which I had rai&s;ed by it, that therefore I either was happy or ea&s;y: no, there was a dart &s;truck into my liver; there was a &s;ecret hell within, even all the while, when our joy was at the highe&s;t; but more e&s;pecially now, after it was all over, and when, according to all appearance, I was one of the happie&s;t women upon earth; all this while, I &s;ay, I had &s;uch a con&s;tant terror upon my mind, as gave me frequently very terrible &s;hocks, and which made me expect &s;omething very frightful upon every accident of life.</P>
<P>With this e&s;tate, &s;ettled as you have heard, and with the be&s;t hu&s;band in the world, I le&s;t England again. I had not only in human pru|dence, and by the nature of the thing, being now married and &s;ettled in &s;o glorious a manner, I &s;ay I had not only abandoned all the gay and wicked cour&s;e which I had gone through before,
<PB N="253" REF="267">
but I began to look back upon it with that hor|ror, and that dete&s;tation, which is the certain companion, if not the forerunner of repentance.</P>
<P>Sometimes the wonders of my pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances would work upon me, and I &s;hould have &s;ome raptures upon my &s;oul, upon the &s;ubject of my coming &s;o &s;moothly out of the arms of Hell, that I was not ingulphed in ruin, as mo&s;t who lead &s;uch lives are, fir&s;t or la&s;t: but this was a flight too high for me; I was not come to that repentance that is rai&s;ed from a &s;en&s;e of heaven's goodne&s;s; I repented of the crime, but it was of another and lower kind of repentance, and rather moved by my fears of vengeance, than from a &s;en&s;e of being &s;pared from being puni&s;hed, and landed &s;afe after a &s;torm. Now I have men|tioned a &s;torm, notwith&s;tanding what Amy had before &s;aid, that &s;he would never venture her&s;elf upon the &s;eas again, yet, &s;he would not leave me, and accordingly embarked with us for Holland.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing of con&s;equence which happened after our coming to the Hague, where we lodged for a while, was, that my hu&s;band &s;aluted me one morning with the title of Counte&s;s, as he &s;aid he intended to do, by having the inheritance, to which the honour was annexed, made over to him. It is true, it was a rever&s;ion, but it &s;oon fell, and, in the mean time, as all the brothers of a Count are called Counts, &s;o I had the title by courte&s;y, a little before I had it in reality.</P>
<P>I was now in the height of my glory and pro|&s;perity, and I was called the Counte&s;s de Wint|&s;el&s;heim, for I had obtained that unlooked for, which I &s;ecretly aimed at. I took now more
<PB N="254" REF="268">
&s;ervants lived in real magnificence; was called <HI>tour honour</HI> at every word, and had a coronet upon my coach; though at the &s;ame time I knew little or nothing of my new pedigree.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that my hu&s;band took upon him to manage, was to declare our&s;elves married eleven years before our arriving in Holland; and con&s;equently to acknowledge our little &s;on, who was yet in England, to be legitimate; order him to be brought over, and added to his family, and acknowledge him to be our own.</P>
<P>This was done by giving notice to his people at Nimmeguen, where his children, which were two &s;ons and a daughter, were brought up, that he was come over from England, and that he was arrived at the Hague, with his wife, and &s;hould re&s;ide there &s;ome time; and that he would have his two &s;ons brought down to &s;ee him, which accordingly was done, and where I entertained them with all the kindne&s;s and tenderne&s;s that they could expect from their mother-in-law; and who pretended to be &s;o ever &s;ince they were two or three years old.</P>
<P>This, &s;uppo&s;ing us to have been &s;o long mar|ried, was not difficult at all, in a country where we had been &s;een together about that time, and where we had never been &s;een afterwards, till we now returned together? this being &s;een together, was al&s;o openly owned, and acknowledged of cour&s;e, by our friend the merchant at Rotterdam; and al&s;o by the people in the hou&s;e where we both lodged, in the &s;ame city, and where our fir&s;t intimacies began, and who, as it happened, were all alive; and therefore to make it the more
<PB N="255" REF="269">
public, we made a tour to Rotterdam again, lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and were vi&s;ited there by our friend the Merchant, and afterwards in|vited frequently to his hou&s;e, where he treated us very genteely.</P>
<P>This conduct of my &s;pou&s;e, and which he ma|naged extremely well, was, indeed, a te&s;timony of a wonderful degree of hone&s;ty and affection to our little &s;on, for it was done purely for the &s;ake of the child.</P>
<P>I call it hone&s;t affection, becau&s;e it was from a principle of hone&s;ty that he &s;o earne&s;tly con|cerned him&s;elf, to prevent the &s;candal which would otherwi&s;e have fallen upon the child, who was it&s;elf innocent; and as it was from this prin|ciple of ju&s;tice that he &s;o earne&s;tly &s;olicited me, and conjured me by the natural affections of a mother, to marry him, when it was yet young within me, and unborn, that the child might not &s;uffer for the &s;in of its father and mother; &s;o tho' at the &s;ame time he really loved me, yet I had rea&s;on to believe, that it was from this principle of ju&s;tice to the child, that he came to England again to &s;eek me, with de&s;ign to marry me, and, as he called it, &s;ave an innocent lamb from an in|famy wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>It is with a ju&s;t reproach to my&s;elf, that I mu&s;t repeat it again, that I had not the &s;ame concern for it, though it was the child of my own body; nor had I ever the hearty affectionate love to the child, that he had; what the rea&s;on of it was, I cannot tell; and indeed, I had &s;hewn a general neglect of the child through all the gay years of my London revels, except that I &s;ent Amy to
<PB N="256" REF="270">
look upon it now and then, and to pay for its nur&s;|ing; as for me, I &s;carce &s;aw it four times in the fir&s;t four years of its life, and often wi&s;hed it would go quietly out of the world; whereas a &s;on which I had by Mr. Dazzle the jeweller, I took a different care of, and &s;hewed a differ|ent concern for, for I provided very well for him; had him put out genteely to &s;chool, and when he came to years fit for it, let him go over with a per&s;on of hone&s;ty and good bu&s;ine&s;s, to the Indies; and after he had lived there &s;ome time, and began to act for him&s;elf, &s;ent him over the value of 2000l. at &s;everal times, with which he traded and grew rich.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band and I lived a very regular con|templative life, and in it&s;elf certainly a life filled with all human felicity: but if I looked upon my pre&s;ent &s;ituation with &s;atisfaction, as I cer|tainly did, &s;o in proportion I on all occa&s;ions looked back on former things with dete&s;tation, and with the utmo&s;t affliction; and now indeed, and not till now, tho&s;e reflections began to prey upon my comforts, and le&s;&s;en the &s;weets of my other enjoyments: they might be &s;aid to have gnawed a hole in my heart before, but now they made a hole quite through it; now they eat into all my plea&s;ant things, made bitter every &s;weet, and mixed my &s;ighs with every &s;mile.</P>
<P>Not all the affluence of a plentiful fortune; not a hundred thou&s;and pounds e&s;tate; for be|tween us we had little le&s;s, not honour and titles, attendants and equipages; in a word, not all the things we call plea&s;ure, could give me any reli&s;h, or &s;weeten the ta&s;te of things to me, at lea&s;t, not
<PB N="257" REF="271">
&s;o much, but I grew &s;ad, heavy, pen&s;ive, and melancholly; eat little, and &s;lept le&s;s; dreamed continually of the mo&s;t frightful and terrible things imaginable, &s;o that in the morning, when I &s;hould ri&s;e, and be refre&s;hed with the ble&s;&s;ing of re&s;t, I was hagridden with frights, and terrible things, formed merely in the imagination; and was either tired and wanted &s;leep, or over-run with vapours, and not fit for conver&s;ing with my family, or any one el&s;e.</P>
<P>My hu&s;band, the tendere&s;t creature in the world, and particularly &s;o to me, was in great concern for me, and did every thing that lay in his power to comfort and re&s;tore me; &s;trove to rea&s;on me out of it; then tried all the ways po&s;&s;ible to divert me; but it was all to no purpo&s;e, or but to very little.</P>
<P>My only relief was, &s;ometimes to unbo&s;om my|&s;elf to poor Amy, when &s;he and I were alone; and &s;he did all &s;he could to comfort me, but all was to little effect there; for though Amy was the better penitent before, when we had been in the &s;torm; Amy was ju&s;t where &s;he u&s;ed to be, now a wild, gay, unthinking wretch, and not much the graver for her age; for Amy was between forty and fifty by this time too; though a very de&s;irable woman &s;till.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. <HI>Which concludes the Hi&s;tory.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN le&s;s than nine months after our arrival in Holland, a terrible di&s;a&s;ter happened to me. My hu&s;band was taken ill of a violent fever, and died in a few days; leaving me executrix to the whole of his effects, excepting ten thou&s;and pounds to each of his three children by a former wife; but, before this misfortune, he had provided hand|&s;omely for our &s;on, and &s;ent him to Bengal, from which place I have lately heard from him.</P>
<P>When I had &s;ettled all my affairs in Holland, I returned again to England, with my two daugh|ters, and my maid Amy, and took a very genteel hou&s;e at Clapton; where, with another maid &s;er|vant, a coachman, and footman, we all lived re|tired, and happily together.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came back to London, I went to &s;ee my friend the Quaker; with this agreeable companion, both at her hou&s;e and mine, I &s;pent many a chearful hour, nay many a chearful month, for we were &s;eldom a&s;under; till at length, &s;he having di&s;po&s;ed of the three elde&s;t of her daughters in marriage to worthy men, and her brother having no children, took the fourth to him&s;elf, I prevailed upon her to leave off hou&s;e|keeping, and retire to Clapton with me; here we lived together, a &s;ociable and a rational life, generally employing cur&s;elves in innocent amu&s;e|ments at home, or in exerci&s;e abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="273">
I had not been at Clapton above a year and a half, when perceiving a Gentleman &s;tep out of a chariot oppo&s;ite my hou&s;e, occa&s;ioned by an acci|dent which happened to one of the wheels; I &s;ent a &s;ervant with my compliments to de&s;ire the Gen|tleman to walk in, until the wheel was repaired. As &s;oon as he made his appearance in the par|lour, I gave a &s;hriek, fell back in my chair, and fainted away.</P>
<P>When I came to my&s;elf, I perceived he had both my hands fa&s;t in his. 'How is it with you, <Q>&startq;Madam?' &s;ays he; and exclaimed, 'good God? what happine&s;s is this in being ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;ight of you again &s;o unexpectedly.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Ble&s;&s;ed indeed! &s;aid I; 'happy misfortune, to &s;ee you after &s;o long a &s;eparation, for I never expected to behold you more.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Indeed, Madam,' &s;aid he, 'I am as much &s;urpri&s;ed as you can be, I thought you had been out of the kingdom.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Here he related to me the happine&s;s he had enjoyed in the married &s;tate, but, as it had plea&s;ed Heaven to deprive him of what he then held mo&s;t dear in taking his wife from him, if I was under no engagement to another, he &s;hould think it the greate&s;t happine&s;s to be allied to me.</P>
<P>By this time, I imagine, gentle reader, you are impatient to know who this extraordinary per&s;on was, and therefore, that I may not tre&s;pa&s;s too much on your good-nature, I will inform you, it was my dear friend, and companion, Mr. Wor|thy, whom you have, in this hi&s;tory, been already acquainted with.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="274">
A little after his chariot was ready, he, fir&s;t de&s;iring me to admit him to &s;ee me again, &s;aluting me, took his leave.</P>
<P>When he was gone, and I had returned to the parlour, my companion the Quaker, for &s;he was with us great part of the time; 'Friend,' &s;ays &s;he, <Q>&startq;this affair of thine hath alarmed thee much, and greatly exceedeth thy meeting with thy for|mer friend thy Dutch merchant; but, if it endeth as happily, thou wilt have cau&s;e to be very thankful for the event; and, &s;urely, thee mu&s;t have &s;omething greatly affecting in thy &s;tory.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I &s;miled, and &s;aid; <Q>&startq;Indeed it hath greatly alarmed me; and, as I find you are inclined to hear it, I will be brief.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Here I acquainted her with &s;ome part of what the reader already knows, and by my concealing the criminal part, &s;uch was, and ever will be the effect, in our relating our own &s;tory, that it appeared to her, as a cha&s;te and regular court&s;hip.</P>
<P>The next day, as indeed I expected, Mr. Worthy come again, and after the tea equipage was removed, my friend the Quaker, rightly gue&s;&s;ing a third per&s;on to be needle&s;s, left us to our&s;elves; and, though he &s;tayed above two hours, it is immaterial to relate any part of our conver&s;a|tion, it being only upon common topics, not worthy of being recorded in this hi&s;tory; but, with this addition, I a&s;&s;ure my reader, that nothing pa&s;&s;ed between us, that would have enabled a third per&s;on, nay even in my friend the Quaker, to have occa&s;ioned a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>While my Quaker and I were at &s;upper, I perceived her to &s;mile, and look very well

plea&s;ed, and when the cloth was removed, &s;ays &s;he; <Q>&startq;Friend, I wonder thou art &s;o pen&s;ive, I expected to have &s;een thee in gay &s;pirits, and not &s;o melancholy as thou &s;eeme&s;t to be.&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;Truly, Friend,' &s;ays &s;he, 'it cannot be a common acquaintance, for tho&s;e who are indif|ferent to us, &s;eldom employ our thoughts, e&s;pe|cially when ab&s;ent, which, at pre&s;ent, thee know|e&s;t is thy own ca&s;e; but, come be chearful, thee wilt &s;ee him again I hope, if it will be for thy good.&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;My dear Friend,' &s;ays I, '&s;till you have not an&s;wered my que&s;tions; I a&s;ked you concern|ing Mr. Worthy, not concerning my&s;elf, and you have given your opinion-relative to me only,

and it was of him that I reque&s;ted your &s;enti|ments.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why then,' &s;aid &s;he, in very good temper, &s;ince thou wilt have me &s;peak, I think that thou like&s;t him, better than he liketh thee, or, in other words, thou appeare&s;t fonder of him, than thy friend doth of thee; and, that I may now come to thy que&s;tion, my opinion is, thee art as hand&s;ome for a woman, as he is for a man; and now, I hope, I have an&s;wered thy reque&s;t; though, perhaps, I may tell thee my mind more fully hereafter.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Worthy came according to his promi&s;e, and after he had taken his leave and was gone, my Quaker began. <Q>&startq;A mighty agreeable &s;ociable companion, is this, thy friend, I do not now wonder at thy partiality towards him, a man of &s;uch good morals, for I do not here &s;peak of his per&s;on, though that is unexceptionable, al|mo&s;t any woman, unengaged, might lawfully give her hand and heart too; as, I doubt not, at a proper &s;ea&s;on, thou would&s;t mo&s;t willingly do it thy&s;elf.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;So then, Friend,' &s;ays I, 'if I under&s;tand you right, you would have no objection to him your&s;elf, if you was an unmarried wo|man.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I have not told thee &s;o,' &s;ays &s;he, &s;miling; why wilt thou wre&s;t, and extort my words to thy own meaning? what might to thee be a|greeable, might not be &s;o to me, I am not ena|moured with thy friend, though I have my rea&s;ons to think that thou art.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="263" REF="277">
'Pray, my dear Friend,' &s;aid I, 'what may be your rea&s;ons in thinking &s;o? I am in high &s;pirits and &s;hould be glad to hear.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Fir&s;t then,' &s;aid &s;he, 'thee &s;peake&s;t but little thy&s;elf. Secondly, thou art very attentive to all thy friend &s;ayeth. And thirdly, thou frequent|ly rivette&s;t thy eyes &s;o &s;tedfa&s;tly on his, that I mu&s;t have been blind and deaf not to have di&s;|covered thy motives; if the&s;e are not rea&s;ons &s;ufficient for my &s;u&s;picions, for thy love and affection to him, I know not what are.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I could not help &s;miling at my Quaker's de|&s;cription of the pa&s;&s;ion of love; and the next vi&s;it Mr. Worthy made me, I told him, before her, the whole of what &s;he had &s;aid, and though &s;he blu&s;hed exceedingly, it plea&s;ed him, and we all &s;pent the evening very agreeably together.</P>
<P>Within a month after this, I acquainted her, Mr. Worthy had been very pre&s;&s;ing for me to con&s;ent, as he was plea&s;ed to call it, to his happi|ne&s;s; that as to my own fortune, he would leave it to me in what manner I &s;hould chu&s;e to &s;ettle it, and, as I had two daughters, he &s;aid, it was ex|tremely proper they &s;hould be provided for; with a great many kind expre&s;&s;ions concerning my&s;elf: <Q>&startq;And though they were plea&s;ing to me, my dear Friend, would afford but little plea&s;ure for you to hear; therefore, I &s;hall omit them, and pro|ceed&endq; to acquaint you with my an&s;wer to him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Mr. Worthy, your genero&s;ity towards me, and my girls, demands my acknowledgments; and as we are upon a &s;erious &s;ubject, you will&endq; permit me to make as &s;erious a reply.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="264" REF="278">
&startq;Without entering into a detail of particulars on your part, I flatter my&s;elf, whatever you have &s;aid, and the many high compliments you have paid to my per&s;on, has proceeded from &s;incerity only; and to do you ju&s;tice, Mr. Worthy, I a&s;&s;ure you I have not the lea&s;t doubt of your veracity in any one in&s;tance; yet, I am afraid, you know not what you reque&s;t; I am not the woman I was, though, by your &s;miling, you &s;eem to think I am. Here, my dear Friend, he made &s;everal prote&s;tations, and ki&s;&s;ing me with great eagerne&s;s; I will leave you to imagine whether I was mo&s;t offended or plea&s;ed at his behaviour.&endq; But to proceed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As you have, I &s;aid, never enquired, Mr. Worthy, concerning my fortune, I mu&s;t con|clude you have a plentiful one of your own; however, be that as it may, I &s;hall deal ingenu|ou&s;ly with you, I have already &s;ettled one third of mine, upon each of my daughters; and, if our affair does not take place, the whole that I may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, at my decea&s;e, excepting &s;ome few legacies, will be equally divided between&endq; them.</Q></P>
<P>'My dear Love,' &s;aid he, taking me by the hand, with a great deal of tenderne&s;s, 'have you 'done?'</P>
<P>With the &s;ame tenderne&s;s, on my part, I re|plied, I had.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why then,' &s;aid he, 'my fortune, thank Heaven, is &s;ufficient for us both, and whatever you intended for me, &s;hall be &s;ettled upon your|&s;elf, to di&s;po&s;e as you plea&s;e; it is your dear per&s;on I a&s;pire to, and that only; name the day, &s;o it be but &s;hortly, and I &s;hall be happy.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="265" REF="279">
&startq;His behaviour, my dear Friend, overcame me, and in the warmth of my love, I told him, yes, my fair Friend, I told him, for I could not conceal it any longer, I had &s;till twenty thou&s;and pounds left for him, and as he de&s;ired I would fix the day of our marriage, he &s;hould be ma&s;ter, both of that &s;um, and me, any time the following week, whenever he plea&s;ed; and Thur&s;|day next is the day fixed upon, when, and where, I hope you will have no objection to be pre&s;ent&endq; at the ceremony.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Objection!' &s;aid my Quaker, 'no truly; and I hope thee wilt not let me be idle, for thee mu&s;t have a great many preparations to make a|gain&s;t&endq; the time.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Whatever they may be,' &s;aid I, 'you &s;hall,&endq; I promi&s;e you, be as bu&s;y as you plea&s;e.</Q> And, indeed, &s;he was of great &s;ervice to me, and it was concluded &s;o privately, that none, but my own family knew of any &s;uch tran&s;action in agitation, until it was over.</P>
<P>When we were returned home from church, I immediately went up &s;tairs to my dre&s;&s;ing|room; the Quaker following me &s;aid, <Q>&startq;Thee remembereth how merry we were, when I put thee to bed, when thee wert married, to Mr. Vandunc, the Dutch Merchant; pray let us be as merry to-night, and I imagine we &s;hall be &s;o, for thy hu&s;band &s;eemeth to be a very good-tempered&endq; man.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;He is &s;o indeed, my Friend,' &s;aid I, 'and you will be &s;en&s;ible of it before the week&endq; be out.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="280">
Our Quaker, for I left it to her management, provided an elegant dinner, and we were all as rationally delighted as we could de&s;ire, the whole day, and evening al&s;o. About eleven o'clock, the Quaker and Amy put me to bed, when pre&s;ently after in came Mr. Worthy; and after the u&s;ual ceremonies on &s;uch occa&s;ions, they &s;milingly wi&s;hed us a good night, &s;hut the door, and left us.</P>
<P>In a few days after, when we had dined, and the cloth was removed, my hu&s;band &s;aid to the Quaker, <Q>&startq;What is the matter with you Madam? you are not &s;o chearful as you u&s;ually are; you have lo&s;t your vivacity, do you wi&s;h for&endq; another wedding?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;No Friend,' &s;ays &s;he, 'I am thinking thou art, though unde&s;ignedly, the greate&s;t enemy I have; for I perceive plainly, not only from thy&s;elf, but al&s;o from thy wife, that I am not likely to have much of her company when thee&endq; art in the way.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well Friend,' &s;aid I, merrily, 'do not be ca&s;t down, and to make you amends, whenever I go&s;&s;ip abroad, you &s;hall have his company at&endq; home; will that content you?</Q> This put an end to our dialogue, for the pre&s;ent, and we were all, &s;hortly, as chearful as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Thus time glided away in the utmo&s;t harmony, for above eighteen months; when, a little incident had liked to have given me a great unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>One afternoon, as I entered my bed-chamber, who &s;hould I &s;ee before me, but my hu&s;band and my Quaker &s;itting clo&s;ely together. Alarmed as I was, I had the pre&s;ence of mind to &s;ay, &s;miling;
<PB N="267" REF="281">
'So, my dear, how do you like my friend?' And immediately went to my looking-gla&s;s, with &s;eemingly a great deal of coolne&s;s.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of he an&s;wering me, &s;he replied: <Q>&startq;Friend, do not thee be unea&s;y, our di&s;cour&s;e is&endq; only concerning thee.'</Q> Had I then con&s;idered the affair rightly, I &s;hould not have had any occa|&s;ion to be unea&s;y, the door being wide open; and both of them were as unconcerned upon my coming in, as if it had only been my lap-dog, who had entered the room; therefore, I &s;ay, had I con&s;i|dered the matter rightly, I had little rea&s;on to be alarmed, but, the circum&s;tance of finding a female in the company of my hu&s;band, in my bed-cham|ber, I confe&s;s, occa&s;ioned in me an idea of crimi|nality. This I might have concealed from the reader, as neither my hu&s;band, or my Quaker, had ever the lea&s;t &s;urmize of my &s;u&s;picion; and to do them both the ju&s;tice they de&s;erved, I con|fe&s;s, it was highly wrong in me to harbour a thought &s;o much to their prejudice.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Pray, Friend,' &s;ays I, laughing, 'what was your di&s;cour&s;e concerning me?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, thy hu&s;band,' &s;ays &s;he, 'has been telling me that thou art the be&s;t wife in the world; and I &s;aid, you was even with him, I was &s;ure, for that you thought his equal could not be found; and now, I doubt not, but thou&endq; wilt be vain from what he hath &s;aid.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, Friend,' &s;aid I, 'will you call it vanity, in my having a better opinion of my&s;elf, from the &s;entiments my hu&s;band has entertained of me? If &s;o, vanity may belong to tho&s;e only who are mo&s;t worthy of prai&s;e; and &s;he who,
<PB N="268" REF="282">
perhaps, may not be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one virtue, may be free from that vice. However, if being plea&s;ed with my hu&s;band's encomiums be a fault, I am afraid, I &s;hall be an offender to a high degree.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>It may be wondered by the reader, why I have been &s;o long &s;ilent concerning my two daugh|ters, whom I had by my fir&s;t hu&s;band; my other three children, which, as I &s;aid before, I had by him, were at this time dead. As they were both very likely girls, two Hamburgh Mer|chants in the neighbourhood, &s;oon after I came to Clapton, paid their addre&s;&s;es to them, both men of ample fortunes, to neither of whom could I make an objection; to the&s;e two Gentlemen, I gave my daughters in marriage, with each a portion of ten thou&s;and pounds; and at Hamburgh they all re&s;ide. Su&s;annah, my elde&s;t, has lately been brought to bed of a &s;on; and the other, Olivia, of a daughter; and in their letters they inform me they are both happy in their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark, I am apprehen&s;ive, may be made, concerning my tru&s;ty and faithful wo|man Amy, &s;he who has &s;o often been mentioned in this hi&s;tory. Some time &s;ince, &s;aid &s;he to me, <Q>&startq;Madam, I have a great favour to beg of you.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'What is it, Amy?' &s;aid I.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why,' &s;ays &s;he, 'as I would not do any thing of importance without your approbation, it is to know how I &s;hall di&s;po&s;e of the money I have &s;aved in your &s;ervice.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>'Why, what have you &s;aved, Amy?'</P>
<P>'Near a thou&s;and pounds, Madam.'</P>
<P><Q><PB N="269" REF="283">
&startq;And &s;o you want my advice in the di&s;po&s;al of it. Why, you &s;impleton, put your money out upon good &s;ecurities, don't keep it by you&endq; mouldering.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;I am afraid to tell you, Madam, le&s;t you &s;hould be angry, and yet I mu&s;t tell you, if you &s;hould be &s;o; there is Mr. James, my ma&s;ter's valet de chambre, Madam, has been very pre&s;&s;ing for me to con&s;ent to marry him for the&s;e &s;ix months pa&s;t. I think he is a very di&s;creet, and a &s;ober man, and I do not imagine I can be|&s;tow my&s;elf and my money better, than by hav|ing him; do pray, Madam, let me prevail up|on you to be of my opinion.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Well, Amy, as you tell me you are in love, I will &s;peak to your ma&s;ter about Mr. James, concerning this di&s;temper of yours, this fever of the mind.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Fever, Madam!&endq;</Q> laughing; <Q>&startq;I have not any fever, I am &s;ure I am as well as ever I was in my life, as well as I was when I fir&s;t came into your &s;ervice.&endq;</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;How long is it &s;ince, Madam?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why, it is turned of thirty years; we were both girls then, and though you were married
<PB N="270" REF="284">
to Mr. Bacon, the Brewer, you was &s;carce &s;eventeen, and I remember, I was not &s;ixteen then; and yet, thank God for it, we are both as healthy now as ever we were in our lives; and I prote&s;t, Madam, without the lea&s;t flattery, you are as hand&s;ome as ever you were.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Your ob&s;ervations are ju&s;t, Amy,&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;I think we are as well in health as ever, nor can I perceive any alteration in you, and it has often been remarked to me, by others, and that very lately, what a likely woman you are; and &s;o, indeed, I think you are, Amy, though you have been naught, as well as my&s;elf.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Upon the entrance of Mr. Worthy, Amy with|drew, and I acquainted him, with what &s;he had &s;aid concerning his Valet, with this addition, <Q>&startq;My Dear,&endq;</Q> &s;ays I, <Q>&startq;it will be proper for you to que&s;tion Mr. James, and if you find his engagements are &s;imilar with her's, let us give our con&s;ents to their marriage; &s;he has been a tru&s;ty &s;ervant to me, and if they marry, I will give her, for her faithful &s;ervices, a &s;mall freehold farm, which I purcha&s;ed &s;ome years ago, where they may retire, and live comfort|ably together.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Do &s;o, my Dear,&endq;</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>&startq;and we will &s;end for him in, and hear what he &s;ays.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Upon his entrance into the room my hu&s;band &s;aid, <Q>&startq;James, have you any intention of altering your condition, or, in other words, have you any intention of marrying?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Not without I have your con&s;ent, and my Lady's, Sir.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;And, who is the object of your de&s;ire? &s;ays I.
<PB N="271" REF="285">
Your Lady&s;hip's woman, Mrs. Amy, my Lady. She is the per&s;on I have &s;ettled my affections upon, and if I have not her, I will remain &s;in|gle&endq; as I have ever been.</Q> He then gave us &s;o many &s;atisfactory rea&s;ons why he prefered her to any other woman, that my hu&s;band ordered him to &s;eek for Amy, and bring her in along with him.</P>
<P>When Amy came into the room, her face was like &s;carlet, and &s;he could &s;carcely &s;peak, but in a &s;hort time, recovering her&s;elf, her behaviour was &s;uch, that we gave our con&s;ents they might marry whenever they plea&s;ed, upon condition they would acquaint us with it, and that I would give them not only their wedding dinner, but I would al&s;o give them the freehold farm before mentioned.</P>
<P>This drew from James, a profu&s;ion of ac|knowledgments for our kindne&s;&s;es, as they did from poor Amy, a profu&s;ion of tears.</P>
<P>As Amy had pa&s;&s;ed for a widow, for &s;everal years, and as James did not know any thing to the contrary, nor, indeed, did any other, except|ing my&s;elf. James ea&s;ily prevailed upon her to have the wedding fixed for that day week, which ceremony was accordingly performed, and the day and evening concluded in mirth; the Quaker and I put her to-bed, and my hu&s;band was as merry as either of us.</P>
<P>I told the Quaker, for &s;he has been a widow &s;everal months, I hope it will be your turn next.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Why doth thee hope &s;o friend? I have no occa&s;ion for a male-companion, do&s;t thee think&endq; I have?</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="272" REF="286">
&startq;Yes, yes, as much occa&s;ion as either of us. There is Mr. Trueman, our neighbour, I have ob&s;erved him for &s;ome time pa&s;t; I am &s;ure he likes you, and if I am not greatly mi&s;taken, he is not indifferent to a certain per&s;on, and if it is not&endq; a match, I think the fault will be in your&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>After this, I do not know what encouragement &s;he gave him. He came more frequently than u&s;ual, and in le&s;s than three months, matters were agreed on, and they became hu&s;band and wife, greatly to her advantage.</P>
<P>Five women in one family, each to get a good hu&s;|band, is a happine&s;s &s;eldom to be found, and what is more rare, my&s;elf, my two daughters, Amy, and the Quaker, each thinking &s;he has the be&s;t, and indeed, they are all de&s;erving men.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the manifold ble&s;&s;ings which I have received, and the mo&s;t endearing u&s;age from the be&s;t of hu&s;bands, yet there is a &s;omething corroding at my heart, which gives me great un|ea&s;ine&s;s; the life I had formerly led, for &s;everal years in adultery, di&s;turbs me now in my &s;erious moments; and I find by experience the &s;plendor of this world, though it may lull and compo&s;e us for a time, will not in the end, without a thorough repentance, heal an unquiet and di&s;|turbed mind.</P>
<P>It was in one of the&s;e &s;olemn and important fits, my hu&s;band ob&s;erved a tear &s;teal down my cheek, and tenderly que&s;tioning me the occa&s;ion, I revealed to him that part of my corrupt and vicious life, with others, which, though the reader has been already acquainted with it, he, my hu&s;band, was an utter &s;tranger to before.</P>
<P><Q><PB N="273" REF="287">
&startq;My dear, do not po&s;&s;e&s;s your mind with ideas &s;o afflictive; you have been an unexceptionable and a virtuous wife to me, which I doubt not will atone for follies pa&s;t; and my love is &s;o unbounded, &s;o unlimited towards you, to &s;ee&endq; you thus renders me mi&s;erable.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Oh! my love, you are too good, too kind, to &s;uch a wretch as me; had I no other than the crime which, long &s;ince we our&s;elves together com|mitted, I could not bear it now; and, though you never have reproached me with it, I have a monitor within me, that will not let me re&s;t; and, fearful I am, I &s;hall never know comfort&endq; more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;My dear, do not indulge &s;uch melancholy thoughts, let us chearfully return thanks to the Almighty for his goodne&s;s towards us; let us earne&s;tly do unto others what we would have others do unto us; and we have an a&s;&s;urance from him, who never failed in his promi&s;e, of&endq; our receiving a happy reward hereafter.</Q></P>
<P>Such were the cordial drops, my kind and loving hu&s;band ever endeavoured to relieve me, nor has he failed in his applications&mdash;My thoughts are more &s;erene&mdash;I have not that tempe&s;t in my mind as heretofore&mdash;I rely on the father of all mercies, and he has given me ea&s;e&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be his name&mdash;now and for evermore&mdash;</P>
<P>Here the conclu&s;ion is left for me to relate, as I had it from Mr. Worthy him&s;elf. He told me, his dear and affectionate wife, for &s;uch he a&s;&s;ured me &s;he was to him, being &s;en&s;ibly touched with the remembrance of her former fol|lies, and &s;tedfa&s;tly relying, and frequently call|ing
