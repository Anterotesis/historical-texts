<HEAD>1 PETER II. 16.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">As free, and not u&s;ing your liberty for a cloke of
maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervants of God.</HEAD>
<P>THE duties to which we are this day cal|led,
are principally two; to implore the
ble&s;&s;ing of God on the coun&s;els and the
arms of our &s;overeign and our country, for put|ting
an happy end to the civil war in which we
are involved; and to humble our&s;elves in &s;incere
repentance for tho&s;e &s;ins by which we have pro|voked
God to vi&s;it us with this calamity, and
which, per&s;i&s;ted in, may ju&s;tly provoke him to
prolong it, or to bla&s;t our &s;ucce&s;s and our national
pro&s;perity. In both the&s;e duties we may be ani|mated
and directed, by due con&s;ideration of the
words now read.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle having inculcated on Chri&s;tians
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the civil government under which
they lived; and, though it was a very exception|able
<PB N="4" REF="3">
form, being the government of the Roman
emperours, and that too chiefly as it was exer|ci&s;ed
over the provinces, having repre&s;ented that
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as a duty of &s;acred obligation, as in|cumbent
<HI>for the Lord's &s;ake,</HI> and required by <HI>the
will of God;</HI> he adds, <HI>As free, and not u&s;ing
your liberty for a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the
&s;ervants of God.</HI> He acknowleges that they were
free in many important re&s;pects; but he inti|mates
that a licence wantonly to oppo&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed
government, is no part of that liberty which the
go&s;pel either be&s;tows or tolerates: he permits them
to enjoy and rejoice in every degree of true li|berty
which the government allowed them; but
he warns them, that under the fal&s;e colour of en|joying
and u&s;ing it, they might very readily run
into <HI>maliciou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> into bad practices of many kinds,
and, by the plau&s;ible pretence of the&s;e being im|plied
in the lawful exerci&s;e of their liberty, might
deceive both them&s;elves and others into an in&s;en|&s;ibility
of their ba&s;ene&s;s, perhaps into an admira|tion
of them as great and worthy. He points
out their danger, not to excu&s;e their mi&s;conduct
by the difficulty of avoiding it, but on the con|trary
to make them the more careful to avoid it;
<PB N="5" REF="4">
for he a&s;&s;ures them that what is in any degree
wrong cannot be ju&s;tified by its being di&s;gui&s;ed
under the <HI>cloke</HI> of <HI>liberty,</HI> that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with
their being <HI>the &s;ervants of God,</HI> a right to di&s;obey
whom liberty cannot po&s;&s;ibly include, who ex|pre&s;sly
requires Chri&s;tians to be &s;ubject to their
governours, and who will call them to an account
for the manner in which they u&s;e their liberty, as
well as for every other part of their behaviour.</P>
<P>IF now, my brethren, that oppo&s;ition to the
government of Britain, which its colonies have
rai&s;ed, comes under the de&s;cription of what Peter
expre&s;sly forbids, if it has been rai&s;ed under a <HI>fal&s;e
pretence</HI> of enjoying and defending their <HI>liberty,</HI>
and if it has led them into conduct which may
ju&s;tly be called <HI>maliciou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> we may with humble
&s;aith and tru&s;t implore the ble&s;&s;ing of God on our
righteous cau&s;e: And if many of the vices which
&s;tain our national character, and in&s;ect the hearts
and pervert the ways of individuals, &s;pring &s;rom
our indulging our&s;elves in what is wrong, under
the colour of liberty, we may, by con&s;idering
them in their &s;ource, be excited to and directed
in our repentance for them. That both the&s;e
&s;uppo&s;itions are founded in truth, it &s;hall be my
bu&s;ine&s;s to evince.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
I. I SHALL &s;how that the oppo&s;ition of the
colonies to the government of Britain has been
rai&s;ed under a fal&s;e pretence of liberty, and has
proceeded to maliciou&s;ne&s;s. I &s;hall not enter mi|nutely
into all the rea&s;onings which might be u&s;ed
for the full proof of this, nor into an examination
of all the exceptions which have been adopted in
order to elude their force; I &s;hall only &s;ugge&s;t
&s;ome of tho&s;e principles and maxims, which may
be clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and which lead directly to
the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE world is not yet &s;o degenerate that men
can carry on what is wrong, avowedly as being
wrong; all except the mo&s;t abandoned mu&s;t, for
their own peace of mind, di&s;gui&s;e it to them|&s;elves;
and, for obtaining the &s;upport or even
avoiding the dete&s;tation of others, all mu&s;t veil
it to the world, under the cloke of what is right,
or innocent at lea&s;t. We can never &s;afely form
our judgment of the de&s;igns and the conduct of
men, by the repre&s;entation which them&s;elves give
of them: the brighter the varni&s;h which they en|deavour
to throw over them, the blacker in rea|lity
generally are bad de&s;igns and vicious actions.
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Any thing that is good, may, by the &s;elf-deceit
and artifice of men, be perverted into a cover for
evil practices: but there is a &s;ingular danger of
liberty being abu&s;ed into a ma&s;k for all the de|grees
of undutiful behaviour towards governours.
The very conception of liberty naturally warms
the heart, makes a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;pirit,
and produces vigorous efforts to repell whatever
we regard as an encroachment on it: and it is
too ready to lead us to mi&s;take the ju&s;te&s;t re|&s;traints
for encroachments. If its true nature and
its real extent be in any mea&s;ure mi&s;under&s;tood,
it inevitably pu&s;hes men into mi&s;conduct; and
that with the greater force, on account of the
ardor which it kindles in the brea&s;t, and which
always burns &s;tronge&s;t in the mo&s;t generous na|tures.</P>
<P>A SUPPOSED encroachment on their liberty, is
confe&s;&s;edly the motive to the defection of the
colonies; and this encroachment lies preci&s;ely in
their being taxed by the Briti&s;h parliament without
their own con&s;ent. The plea, that to be taxed
without their own con&s;ent, is &s;imply and in it&s;elf
to be in &s;lavery, depends on this general principle,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
That liberty con&s;i&s;ts in mens being governed only
by laws made by them&s;elves or with their own
con&s;ent. This de&s;cription of liberty has been
given by &s;ome of the greate&s;t of our countrymen,
and under the &s;anction of their names has been
implicitly received, and with the generality has
pa&s;t into an axiom. But it is a de&s;cription, from
which it might ea&s;ily be proved to follow, That
the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible form of government may be in|con&s;i&s;tent
with liberty, That the very wor&s;t form
may be con&s;i&s;tent with liberty, That there never
was one free government in the world, That if a
free government were formed, it could not be
tran&s;mitted beyond that generation which formed
it, That liberty cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in any &s;ociety, ex|cept
every individual belonging to it have a &s;hare
in the legi&s;lature, Nor &s;ub&s;i&s;t a moment longer
than all their re&s;olutions are unanimous. A con|ception
of liberty fraught with con&s;equences &s;o
ab&s;urd, yet demon&s;trably deducible from it,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I have often examined the connexion between all the&s;e
con&s;equences and the commonly received de&s;cription of li|berty,
with the m$&s;t &s;crupulous attention of which I am ca|pable:
but a full eviction of it would have been improper
in a <HI>&s;ermon:</HI> it is a &s;ubject much fitter for a <HI>treati&s;e.</HI></NOTE>,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
mu&s;t needs be fal&s;e; and when it is prevalent, it
is certainly of importance that it be exploded. That
every per&s;on &s;hould be governed only by his own
con&s;ent, is incon&s;i&s;tent with every po&s;&s;ible form of
government; it is, in its &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, incon&s;i&s;tent
even with the independence of a nation of &s;avages.</P>
<P>LIBERTY cannot exi&s;t in any &s;ociety without
re&s;traints; were there but two per&s;ons within
reach of one another, the one could not enjoy
liberty, if the other were under no re&s;traint. Li|berty
con&s;i&s;ts only in the power of doing what we
ought, and in not being con&s;trained to do what
we ought not. Wherever laws require only what
is right, and forbid only what is wrong, there is li|berty,
by whom&s;oever the laws be made. Where|ever
the form of government gives &s;ecurity for
&s;uch laws, it gives proportionable &s;ecurity for li|berty.
It is our happine&s;s to live under a govern|ment
which gives the greate&s;t &s;ecurity for this:
but our &s;ecurity ari&s;es not immediately, but only
remotely, from part of the legi&s;lature being cho|&s;en
by the people: the circum&s;tance from which
it <HI>immediately</HI> ari&s;es, is, that the legi&s;lature have
the &s;ame intere&s;t with the body of the people; and
<PB N="10" REF="9">
this circum&s;tance gives the very &s;ame &s;ecurity to
tho&s;e who have no voice in chu&s;ing them, as to
tho&s;e who have.</P>
<P>LAWS impo&s;ing taxes, &s;tand on no different
ground from other laws. Taxes proportioned to
the real ends of good government, are as nece&s;&s;ary
as government it&s;elf. They are not a <HI>free gift</HI> of
the people, which they may lawfully with-hold at
plea&s;ure: They are a <HI>debt</HI> on the property of the
people, &s;trictly due to the public; a right to re|fu&s;e
them, would be a right to &s;ubvert govern|ment,
which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them. There|fore
the &s;ame apo&s;tle who faith, <HI>Let every &s;oul be
&s;ubject unto the higher powers</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 1.</NOTE>, &s;aith al&s;o, <HI>Render
to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due,
cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom</HI><NOTE N="&verbar;&verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 7.</NOTE>. Taxes are encroach|ments
upon liberty, not by their being impo&s;ed
upon per&s;ons without their own con&s;ent, but only
by their being &s;uch as they ought not to be; only
when they are exce&s;&s;ive, or when they are gro&s;sly
unequal, or when there is no &s;ecurity again&s;t their
be$$ming &s;uch. That the taxes required from
th$ $$onies were exce&s;&s;ive, either in them&s;elves,
o$ in compari&s;on with tho&s;e of Britain, has not
<PB N="11" REF="10">
been and cannot be pretended; they were palpa|bly
the rever&s;e. That the colonies, if taxed by the
Briti&s;h parliament, would not have had the very
&s;ame <HI>degree</HI> of &s;ecurity again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, as the
other &s;ubjects, is readily acknowleged; yet they
would have had a very great, perhaps a &s;ufficient
degree of &s;ecurity, from the very circum&s;tance
which gives us &s;ecurity, their manifold connexions
of intere&s;t with the members of the legi&s;lature;
but if this was not deemed a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity,
concern for their liberty would have doubtle&s;s ju|&s;tified
them in making dutiful application for &s;ome
additional &s;ecurity; every liberal mind would have
wi&s;hed &s;ucce&s;s to their application, and it would
have met with &s;ucce&s;s; if it had been ob&s;tinately
refu&s;ed, the refu&s;al, in a free &s;tate, I &s;cruple not
to &s;ay, would have ju&s;tified re&s;i&s;tance; for it would
have betrayed an intention of abridging the liber|ty
which the con&s;titution allows. But this has ne|ver
been their demand; it has been declared that
this was not what they de&s;ired, or would be &s;ati&s;|fied
with. Their demand has been &s;uch as pre|cluded
the offer of &s;uch &s;ecurity from being made
to them. Their <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> demand has con&s;tantly
been, that they &s;hould not be at all taxed by the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Briti&s;h parliament, but only by their own &s;eparate
a&s;&s;emblies: and this is a demand truly incon&s;i&s;tent
with their being parts of the whole empire; a de|mand,
the granting of which could &s;carcely fail to
occa&s;ion a continual deficience in the revenue, and
would either overburden the re&s;t of the &s;ubjects&punc; to
make up their deficience, or el&s;e put a &s;top to all
the operations of government; nay it is a demand,
though made by the pretended partizans of liberty,
which it might ea&s;ily be proved, by entitling ad|mini&s;tration
to make requi&s;itions from di&s;tinct and
independent legi&s;latures, would directly tend to
enable them, by care&s;&s;ing one, to en&s;lave the
whole. But even this demand, unrea&s;onable and
pernicious as it is, was only a ma&s;k to di&s;gui&s;e
what they truly and ultimately aimed at, a total
immunity from contributing any thing to the ge|neral
&s;upport of the Briti&s;h empire; an immunity
repugnant to the plaine&s;t principles of ju&s;tice, an
inva&s;ion on the property, and an encroachment
on the liberty of all the other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>UNDER the &s;pecious <HI>cloke of liberty,</HI> but really
in &s;upport of &s;o unju&s;t a demand, our deluded
brethren have proceeded to conduct which in
<PB N="13" REF="12">
every point of view may be termed <HI>maliciou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>
With liberty in their mouths, they have exerci&s;ed
the cruelle&s;t violence, the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive tyranny
over all among them&s;elves, who would not co-operate
in their de&s;igns: <HI>the vile&s;t men</HI> have been
<HI>exalted,</HI> and therefore <HI>the wicked</HI> have <HI>walked on
every &s;ide</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xii. 8.</NOTE>. They have &s;tirred up war: and war
is one of the &s;ierce&s;t &s;iends which the Almighty
turneth loo&s;e &s;or the puni&s;hment of nations by
whom he hath been long provoked; the de&s;truc|tion
of the human &s;pecies is the end at which it
aims; as &s;oon as it breaks out, thou&s;ands be|come
intent on butchering thou&s;ands. They have
wantonly ri&s;en in rebellion, they have excited a
civil war: to excite it, except for the mo&s;t urgent
as well as the mo&s;t important cau&s;e, is enormous
and complicated guilt. It is the &s;elle&s;t &s;orm of
war; it &s;ets every man again&s;t his brother; it
bur&s;ts the deare&s;t and the mo&s;t &s;acred ties. They
have per&s;i&s;ted for years in war; many a father,
with a bleeding heart, has been dragged &s;rom his
clinging wife and his tender offspring, to fall in
turning the battle from the gate; many a weeping
<PB N="14" REF="13">
mother has &s;een her darling &s;on, perhaps her only
hope, torn from her bo&s;om, to peri&s;h by the &s;word;
the bloody horrors o&s; a field of battle have been
renewed and again renewed: <HI>come, behold what
de&s;olations</HI> have been <HI>made in the earth</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xlvi. 8.</NOTE>. Unna|tural
children have made the&s;e de&s;olations in lift|ing
up their arm again&s;t the mother land, who
had cheri&s;hed their infancy, and rai&s;ed them to
high pro&s;perity. They have lifted up their arm
again&s;t her, in violation of the &s;olemn oaths of
allegiance which their own mouths had pronoun|ced
in the face of heaven. Not another, but that
very generation of men have thus afflicted Bri|tain,
in who&s;e defence &s;he had lately wa&s;ted mil|lions
of her trea&s;ures and rivers of her blood;
ungrateful, they have thus afflicted her for having,
at this expence, driven from their continent, a
nation from whom they were in perpetual dan|ger.
This very &s;ecurity which &s;he had dearly
purcha&s;ed for them, they have mi&s;employed again&s;t
her&s;elf. To fill up the mea&s;ure of their ingrati|tude,
that &s;ame nation, in dread of whom they
had lived &s;o long, and by whom, for all that them|&s;elves
<PB N="15" REF="14">
could have done, they had been ere now
en&s;laved, they have courted to embrue her hands
in the blood of their parent country, by who&s;e
&s;trenuous and co&s;tly efforts alone, but about
fifteen years ago, their deliverance was wrought,
By &s;uch conduct, the &s;pirit of the nation may well
be rou&s;ed. By expo&s;ing its accumulated ba&s;ene&s;s,
I mean not to exa&s;perate you again&s;t their per&s;ons;
mo&s;t of them have been deluded, many of them
have mi&s;taken; I mean to excite you to pray
with the greater earne&s;tne&s;s for their repentance,
to pray, not that they may, by the &s;ucce&s;s of our
arms, be reduced to &s;lavery,&mdash;the generous &s;pirit
of Briti&s;h liberty, both in our rulers, and in the
people, reprobates the thought with indignation,&mdash;but
to pray that, by returning to their
duty, they may be re&s;tored to the ble&s;&s;ings of the
free&s;t government under heaven, in&s;tead of groan|ing
for years under the alternate ravages of anarchy
and tyranny, and in all probability, after a &s;eries
of excruciating convul&s;ions, &s;ettling at la&s;t in ar|bitrary
government: I mean to make you feel
the ju&s;tice of your country's cau&s;e, and to add con|fidence
and fervour to your prayers for her pro&s;|perity
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and &s;ucce&s;s. Guilty as &s;he may be in many
re&s;pects, in relation to her colonies &s;he is guilt|le&s;s;
if &s;he be chargeable with any faults on their
account, they are &s;o trivial as to vani&s;h when
compared with the atrocity of theirs. If in &s;o
ju&s;t a cau&s;e, the righteous King of nations deny
us &s;ucce&s;s, it mu&s;t be, either for the accompli&s;h|ment
of &s;ome great purpo&s;e of his own in&s;crutable
providence, or for the puni&s;hment of our &s;ins.
Mani$old and heinous the &s;ins of this nation doubt|le&s;s
are; and the general &s;pirit of that corruption
from which they flow, cannot perhaps be repre|&s;ented
in any ju&s;ter point of view, than that which
the text &s;ugge&s;ts, as we &s;hall briefly un&s;old under
the &s;econd head propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>II. WE too, brethren, have <HI>u&s;ed our liberty for
a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Many of the vices which
&s;tain our national character, and pollute individu|als,
&s;pring &s;rom our indulging our&s;elves in what is
wrong, under the colour of liberty. The faulty
part of the Briti&s;h character, in the pre&s;ent age,
cannot be more preci&s;ely de&s;ined, than by a reign|ing
propen&s;ity to libertini&s;m and licentiou&s;ne&s;s.
The leading &s;eature in the prevailing manners of
<PB N="17" REF="16">
the times, is a daring freedom in di&s;daining all
re&s;traints of laws human and divine, and in de|&s;pi&s;ing
all that order and decorum which compli|ance
with them would e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>IT is the fundamental law of civil &s;ociety, more
ancient than any written law, enacted by God at
that moment when he formed man for &s;ociety,
that all the members of the &s;tate co-operate for
the public good. But in the practice of very ma|ny,
this fundamental law is even rever&s;ed. In the
room of affection to the intere&s;t and &s;ervice of
their country, they have &s;ub&s;tituted attachment to
a party, and &s;ordid &s;elfi&s;h views. When they on|ly
perform their duty, by promoting right mea|&s;ures,
they mu&s;t be hired to perform it; and for
hire they will promote any mea&s;ures. I need not
labour to expo&s;e this &s;pirit of corruption: however
many may be actuated by it, all pretend that they
dete&s;t it. By many again, a &s;pirit of &s;tated, un|di&s;tingui&s;hed
oppo&s;ition to every mea&s;ure of go|vernment,
right or wrong, is indulged, avowed,
and applauded. It is <HI>maliciou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> it is incon&s;i&s;tent
with integrity, for it is not po&s;&s;ible that <HI>every</HI> mea|&s;ure
&s;hould be wrong. It would pa&s;s it&s;elf for the
<PB N="18" REF="17">
oppo&s;ite of corruption; but it is its twin-brother;
its language is, Let my country peri&s;h, if it is not
&s;aved by the party to which I have given my
name, and in the prevalence of which my intere&s;t
or my caprice is involved. It calls it&s;elf a watchful
jealou&s;y for liberty; but the fir&s;t opportunity of
getting into place proves that it was only unprinci|pled
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and ambition. It pretends to be
of great utility as a check again&s;t bad de&s;igns: but
it lo&s;es all the power of checking <HI>bad</HI> de&s;igns, by
being pointed again&s;t <HI>every</HI> mea&s;ure; it nece&s;&s;arily
hinders many <HI>good</HI> de&s;igns from being formed;
it ob&s;tructs the execution of the be&s;t; if it prevailed,
it would &s;top all the motions of government and
annihilate the &s;tate; it renders corruption almo&s;t
inevitable for avoiding this effect. It di&s;fu&s;es it&s;elf
through the body of the people; it produces <HI>mur|murers,
complainers, pre&s;umptuous, &s;elf-willed,</HI> &s;ac|tious
&s;pirits, <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing government, &s;peaking evil of

little dangerous, it may be to the public, on ac|count
of the ob&s;curity and impotence of tho&s;e who

<PB N="19" REF="18">
which religion, as well as &s;ound rea&s;on, re|quires

fe&s;ters even into &s;uch malignity as to pro|duce
partiality again&s;t their country.</P>
<P>THE law of God is, <HI>Honour the king; &s;ubmit
your&s;elves to every ordinance of man, whether it be
to the king, as &s;upreme, or unto governours, as unto
them that are &s;ent by him</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 13, 14, 17.</NOTE>; <HI>render to all their
dues, fear to whom fear is due, honour to whom
honour</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 7.</NOTE>. But the &s;pirit of this age &s;purns all
&s;ubordination; it indulges it&s;elf in vilifying and
abu&s;ing the be&s;t and the mo&s;t exalted characters;
it glories in in&s;olence to all &s;uperiours, as the mo&s;t
delicious enjoyment of liberty. Alas! liberty has
not a more deadly foe than &s;uch licentiou&s;ne&s;s:
its immediate effect is lawle&s;s anarchy; its end
&s;eldom fails to be &s;lavery.</P>
<P>SUCH in&s;tances of behaviour as I have mention|ed,
we generally con&s;ider as purely political; we
are very apt to forget that morality and religion
have any concern in them: but both have a
deep concern in them; all the degrees of di&s;|affection
<PB N="20" REF="19">
to the intere&s;t of our country, and of
di&s;re&s;pect to our rulers and &s;uperiours, are truly
&s;inful, however they may be cloked; and they
are &s;ins which there is a peculiar nece&s;&s;ity to men|tion
on this day, as requiring repentance, becau&s;e,
not only by the ju&s;t judgment of God again&s;t them,
but al&s;o by their own direct operation, they tend
to bring on national calamities, and have in an
eminent degree contributed to produce, and if
per&s;i&s;ted in, mu&s;t continue to aggravate the very
calamity which we are now deploring.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e are not the only &s;ins by which God
may be provoked to afflict our country; the&s;e are
not the only kinds of <HI>maliciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> which we indulge
under the di&s;gui&s;e of <HI>liberty.</HI> God often puni&s;hes
&s;ins by other judgments than tho&s;e which ari&s;e
directly from their own natural tendency; and
among us many &s;ins prevail, which de&s;erve his
heavie&s;t judgments. I need not enumerate them
minutely; they are too notorious to require it.
I need not &s;tudiou&s;ly trace them up to the affecta|tion
of fal&s;e liberty, as their &s;ource; they are too
plainly tinged with the colour of this corrupt foun|tain.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
THE laws of private ju&s;tice are of &s;acred and
indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation; they are nece&s;&s;ary for the
very exi&s;tence of &s;ociety. The violation of them
is &s;o gro&s;sly vicious as &s;carce to be &s;u&s;ceptible of
palliation, by the mo&s;t extravagant mi&s;conception
of liberty. Yet &s;o great is our depravity, that
ju&s;tice is violated with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved licence.
Violations of it, in &s;ome of their blacke&s;t forms,
and the mo&s;t &s;ubver&s;ive of the faith of &s;olemn con|tracts,
are frequent and flagrant beyond the exam|ple
of any former period; and in all tran&s;actions
of bu&s;ine&s;s, how much do the arts of di&s;hone&s;ty
abound? What injuries are daily perpetrated
again&s;t the property, the reputation, the peace
and quiet, the mo&s;t valuable rights of men?</P>
<P>WITH what impetuo&s;ity do per&s;ons of every
&s;tation of life, ru&s;h madly into every conceivable
di&s;&s;ipation? The gentle ties of decency and propri|ety
are regarded as intolerable fetters, and thrown
a&s;ide as incompatible with enlargement and free|dom
of &s;pirit. A levity of manners greatly blame|able,
a giddy fondne&s;s for uncea&s;ing amu&s;ement,
in&s;ignificance, enervation of &s;pirit, application to
trifles, impatience of reflection, indi&s;po&s;ition to
<PB N="22" REF="21">
&s;erious or &s;evere employment, are chargeable on
multitudes who are comparatively innocent. The
de&s;tructive idlene&s;s of gaming is no longer only
the a&s;ylum of the de&s;perate and the unthinking;
very generally in the upper &s;pheres of life, and
too generally in the lower, it is painfully pur&s;ued
as an occupation, its arts are &s;eriou&s;ly formed into
a &s;cience, its objects are, with a mi&s;employed in|genuity,
&s;urpri&s;ingly multiplied. Profu&s;ion over|leaps
all the boundaries of prudence, and ex|hau&s;ts
in a moment all the &s;upplies which indu&s;try
can furni&s;h or hone&s;tly permit, and all the re&s;our|ces
which princely fortunes can afford. Tempe|rance
impo&s;es only whole&s;ome and &s;alutary re&s;tric|tions:
but they gall like &s;hackles; they are bur&s;t
a&s;under, and ca&s;t away; full &s;cope is given to
luxury in all its forms; debauchery revels thro' the
land; every plea&s;ure, the mo&s;t guilty, the mo&s;t
&s;hameful, is eagerly and openly pur&s;ued. The
holy bands of marriage are contemned; the &s;acred
purity of the marriage bed, as well as the cha&s;tity
of the blu&s;hing virgin, is polluted with a degree
of effrontery unknown in other ages. Even the
more delicate &s;ex have, in numerous in&s;tances,
renounced all the mode&s;ty of their nature. And
all the&s;e heinous vices are varni&s;hed over, and at|tempted
<PB N="23" REF="22">
to be ju&s;tified, by being mi&s;named liber|ties.
All the pa&s;&s;ions are indulged till they cannot
bear control from principle or con&s;cience.</P>
<P>WE think our&s;elves free to &s;hake even the throne
of God. The liberty of examining every religious
principle with impartiality, many abu&s;e into a li|cence
of rejecting all religious principles without
examination, and of treating all religion with
&s;currilous abu&s;e or &s;neering ridicule. The liberty
of every man's wor&s;hiping God according to his
con&s;cience, many pervert into the privilege of not
wor&s;hiping him at all, and of &s;coffing at tho&s;e who
wor&s;hip him, as the &s;laves of illiberal &s;uper&s;tition.
In how many ways is the &s;olemnity of oaths profan|ed,
and their tremendous obligation &s;lighted? A
commanding &s;en&s;e of God, habitual piety, fervent
devotion, how generally are they wanting? how
defective are they in the be&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>The land and all the inhabitants thereof are
di&s;&s;olved</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxv. 3.</NOTE>. Di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners has made
an alarming progre&s;s. God forbid that the&s;e enor|mous
vices &s;hould be general in the nation! God
<PB N="24" REF="23">
forbid that they &s;hould not be ballanced by many
virtues! But certainly they are by far too pre|valent:
and while they continue prevalent, can we
wonder if God with-hold his ble&s;&s;ing from us, even
in the ju&s;te&s;t cau&s;e, and notwith&s;tanding the
crimes of tho&s;e who have ri&s;en up again&s;t us? Suc|ce&s;s
proportioned to the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, we
have not yet obtained. Let us mourn for the cor|ruption
of manners which doubtle&s;s has ob&s;tructed
it; let us pray for a general reformation; let each
of us &s;earch out his own &s;ins and turn from them.
Let us never fooli&s;hly affect an exemption from the
re&s;traints of any one of God's laws, but act in all
things <HI>as the &s;ervants of God,</HI> per&s;uaded that his
&s;ervice is perfect liberty, and peace, and happine&s;s.</P>
