<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>WE apprehend it can be deemed no Injury to the Author of
the <HI>Three fir&s;t Books</HI> of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> that we publi&s;h
this <HI>Fourth.</HI> It was found merely by Accident, in taking a Sur|vey
of the <HI>Library</HI> of a late eminent Nobleman; but in &s;o blot|ted
a condition, and in &s;o many detached pieces, as plainly
&s;hewed it to be not only <HI>incorrect</HI> but <HI>unfini&s;hed:</HI> That the
Author of the three fir&s;t Books had a de&s;ign to extend and com|plete
his Poem in this manner, appears from the Di&s;&s;&s;ertation pre|fixt
to it, where it is &s;aid, that the <HI>De&s;ign is more exten&s;ive,
and that we may expect other Epi&s;odes to complete it:</HI> And
from the Declaration in the Argument to the third Book, that
<HI>the Accompli&s;hment of the Prophecies therein, would be the
Theme hereafter of a Greater Dunciad.</HI> But whether or no he
be the Author of this, we declare our&s;elves ignorant. If he be,
we are no more to be blamed for the Publication of it, than <HI>Tucca</HI>
and <HI>Varius</HI> for that of the la&s;t &s;ix books of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> tho' per|haps
inferior to the former.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;d of a more perfect Copy of this Work,
or of any other Fragments of it, and will communicate them to
the Publi&s;her, we &s;hall make the next Edition more complete: In
which, we al&s;o promi&s;e to in&s;ert any <HI>Critici&s;ms</HI> that &s;hall be pub|li&s;hed,
if at all to the purpo&s;e, with the <HI>Names</HI> of the <HI>Authors;</HI> or
<PB REF="4">
any Letters &s;ent us (tho' not to the purpo&s;e) &s;hall yet be printed
under the Title of <HI>Epi&s;tolae Ob&s;curorum Virorum;</HI> which, toge|ther
with &s;ome others of the &s;ame kind (formerly laid by for that
purpo&s;e) may make no unplea&s;ant Addition to the future Impre&s;&s;ions
of this Poem.</P>

<HEAD>THE
ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BOOK the FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Poet being, in this Book, to declare the <HI>Completion</HI> of the <HI>Prophecies</HI>
mention'd at the end of the former, makes a new <HI>Invocation,</HI> (as the
greater Poets are wont, when &s;ome high and worthy matter is to be
&s;ung.) He &s;hows the Godde&s;s coming in her Maje&s;ty to de&s;troy <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Sci|ence,</HI>
and to &s;ub&s;titute the <HI>Kingdom of the Dull</HI> upon earth. How &s;he leads cap|tive
the <HI>Sciences,</HI> and &s;ilenceth the <HI>Mu&s;es;</HI> and what they be who &s;ucceed in
their &s;tead. All her children, by a wonderful attraction, are drawn about her;
and bear along with them al&s;o divers others, who promote her Empire by
connivance, weak re&s;i&s;tance, or di&s;couragement of Arts; &s;uch as Half wits,
ta&s;tele&s;s Admirers, vain Pretenders, the Flatterers of dunces, or the Patrons of
them. All the&s;e crowd round her: one of them offering to approach her,
is driven back by a Rival, but &s;he commends and encourages both. The fir&s;t
who &s;peak in form are the <HI>Genius's</HI> of the <HI>Schools,</HI> who a&s;&s;ure her of their
care to advance her Cau&s;e, by confining Youth to <HI>words,</HI> and keeping them out
of the way of real Knowledge. Their Addre&s;s, and her gracious An&s;wer; with
her Charge to them and the Univer&s;ities. The <HI>Univer&s;ities</HI> appear by their pro|per
Deputies, and a&s;&s;ure her that the &s;ame method is ob&s;erv'd in the pro|gre&s;s
of Education: The &s;peech of <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> on this &s;ubject. They are
driven off by a band of young Gentlemen, return'd from <HI>Travel</HI> with their
<HI>Tutors;</HI> one of whom delivers to the Godde&s;s, in a polite oration, an ac|count
of the whole Conduct and Fruits of their <HI>Travels:</HI> pre&s;enting to
her at the &s;ame time a young Nobleman perfectly accompli&s;hed. She re|ceives
him graciou&s;ly and indues him with the happy quality of <HI>Want of
Shame.</HI> She &s;ees loitering about her a number of <HI>Indolent Per&s;ons</HI> abandon|ing
all bu&s;ine&s;s and duty, and dying with lazine&s;s; to whom approaches the
<PB REF="6">
Antiquary <HI>Annius,</HI> intreating her to make them <HI>Virtuo&s;os</HI> and a&s;&s;ign them over
to him: But <HI>Mummius,</HI> another Antiquary, complaining of his fraudulent
proceeding, &s;he finds a method to reconcile their difference. Then enter a
troop of people-fanta&s;tically adorn'd, offfering her &s;trange and exotic pre&s;ents:
Among&s;t them, on &s;tands forth and demands ju&s;ice on another, who had
deprived him of one of the greate&s;t Curio&s;ities in nature: but he ju&s;tifies him|&s;elf
&s;o well, that the Godde&s;s gives them both her approbation. She recom|mends
to them to find proper employment for the <HI>Indolents</HI> before-mention'd,
in the &s;tudy of Butterflies, Shells, Birds-ne&s;ts, Mo&s;s, &amp;c. but with particular
caution, not to proceed beyond <HI>Trifles,</HI> to any u&s;eful or exten&s;ive views of Na|ture,
or of the Author of Nature. Again&s;t the la&s;t of the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, &s;he
is &s;ecur'd by a hearty Addre&s;s from the <HI>Minute Philo&s;ophers</HI> and <HI>Free-thinkers,</HI>
one of whom &s;peaks in the name of the re&s;t. The Youth thus in&s;tructed
and principled, are delivered to her in a body by the hands of <HI>Silenus;</HI> and
then admitted to ta&s;te the Cup of the <HI>Magus</HI> her High Prie&s;t, which cau&s;es a
total oblivion of all Obligations, divine, civil, moral or rational. To the&s;e her
Adepts &s;he &s;ends <HI>Prie&s;ts, Attendants,</HI> and <HI>Comforters,</HI> of various kinds; then
confers on them <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Degrees;</HI> and finally d&igrave;&s;mi&s;&s;ing them with a &s;peech,
confirms to each his <HI>Privileges,</HI> warns <HI>One</HI> in particular not to exceed them,
and concludes with a <HI>Yawn</HI> of extraordinary virtue, the effects of which are
not unfelt at this day.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>The DUNCIAD, BOOK IV.] This Book
may properly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the former
by the Name of the GREATER DUNCIAD,
not &s;o indeed in Size, but in Subject; and &s;o far
contrary to the di&s;tinction anciently made of
the <HI>Greater</HI> and <HI>Le&s;&s;er Iliad.</HI> But much are they
mi&s;taken who imagine this Work in any wi&s;e in|ferior
to the former, or of any other hand than
of our Poet; of which I am much more cer|tain,
than that the <HI>Iliad</HI> it&s;elf was the Work
of <HI>Solomon,</HI> or the <HI>Batrachomuomachia</HI> of <HI>Ho|mer,</HI>
as the learned Barnes hath affirmed. Nor
is it imperfect or incorrect, &s;ave in &s;ome few
places, which we &s;hall remark. SCRIBI.</P>
<P><HI>VERSE</HI> 2.&mdash;dread Chaos and eternal Night!]
Invoked, as the Re&s;toration of their Empire is
the Action of the Poem, referring to the Pro|phecy
in Ver&s;e 338 of the third book;
<Q><L>She comes, the Cloud-compelling Pow'r, behold!</L>
<L>With Night primval, and with Chass old, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>VERSE 1, &amp;c.] This is an Invocation of much
Piety. The Poet willing to approve him&s;elf a
genuine Son, beginneth by &s;hewing (what is
ever agreeable to <HI>Dulne&s;s)</HI> his high Re&s;pect for
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<HI>Antiquity</HI> and a <HI>Great Family,</HI> how dull, or dark

<P>VERSE 4.&mdash;<HI>balf to &s;hew, half veil, the

a dull Poet can never expre&s;s him&s;elf other|wi&s;e
than by <HI>halves</HI> or imperfectly. There are
&s;ome, I know, who under&s;tand it very diffe|rently;
as if the Author in this work had in|deed
a <HI>deep Intent,</HI> that there were in it <HI>My&s;te|ries</HI>
or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which he du$&s;t not fully re|veal,
and that in divers veries (according to
<HI>Miltor.)</HI></P>
<Q>&mdash;more is meant than meets the $ar.</Q>
<P>VERSE 6. <HI>To whom Time bears me on his ra|pii
wing.]</HI> Fair and &s;oftly, good Poet! (cries
the gentle <HI>Scriblerus</HI> on this place) For &s;ure in
&s;pite of this unu&s;ual mode&s;ty, he &s;hall not travel
&s;o fa&s;t toward Oblivion, as divers others of more
Confidence have done: For when I revolve in
my mind the Catalogue of tho&s;e who have the
mo&s;t boldly promi&s;ed to them&s;elves Immortality,
<HI>viz. Pindar, Luis Gagora, Ron&s;ard, Olaham,</HI>
[Lyrick,] and <HI>Lycophron, Statius, Camoens, Chap|$a$,
Blackmore,</HI> [Heroicks,] I find the one half
to be already dead, and the other in utter dark|ne&s;s.
But it becometh not us, who have taken
upon us the office of Commentator, to &s;uffer
our Poet thus prodigally to ca&s;t away his Life:
contrary-wi&s;e the more hidden and ab&s;tru&s;e is
his work, and the more remote its beauties
from common Under&s;tanding, the more is it
our duty to draw forth and exalt the &s;ame, in
the face of Men and Angels. Herein &s;hall we
imitate the laudable Spirit of tho&s;e, who have
(for this very rea&s;on) delighted to comment on
the Fragments of dark and uncouth Authors,
preferred <HI>Eunius</HI> to <HI>Virgil,</HI> and cho&s;en to give
light to <HI>Lyophron,</HI> rather than to hold a candle
to <HI>Homer.</HI> SCRIBL.</P>
<P>VERSE 7.&mdash;<HI>Force inertly &s;trong.]</HI> Alluding

has no Power, is yet the Foundation of all its
Qualities and Attributes.</P>

and expo&s;ing his po&s;teriors. SCRIBL.</P>
<P>VERSE 20.&mdash;<HI>her Laureate &s;on reclines.]</HI> With
great judgment is it imagined by the Poet, that
&s;uch a Collegue as Dulne&s;s had elected, &s;hould &s;leep
on the Throne, and have very little &s;hare in the
Action of the Poem: accordingly he hath done
little or nothing from the day of his Anointing,
having pa&s;t thro' the &s;econd book without taking
part in whatever was tran&s;acted about him, and
thro' the third in profound Sleep. Nor ought
this, well con&s;ider'd, to &s;eem &s;trange in our
days, when &s;o many <HI>King-Con&s;orts</HI> have done
the like. SCRIB.</P>
<P>VERSE <HI>id&mdash;her Laurcate.]</HI>&startq;When I find
my Name in the Satyrical works of this
Poet, I never look upon it as any malice
meant to me, but PROFIT to HIMSELF.
For he con&s;iders that <HI>my Face</HI> is more <HI>known</HI>
than mo&s;t in the nation; and therefore <HI>a
Lick at the Laureate</HI> will always be a &s;ure
bait <HI>ad captandum vulgus,</HI> to catch little

<P>Now if it be certain, that the works of our
Poet have owed their &s;ucce&s;s to this ingenious
Expedient, we hence derive an unan&s;werable
Argument that this DUNCIAD as well as the
former hath had the Author's la&s;t hand, and
was by him intended for the Pre&s;s: Or el&s;e to
what purpo&s;e hath he crowned it, as we &s;ee, by
this fini&s;hing Stroke, the profitable Lick at the
Laureate? SCRIBL.</P>

<P>VER. 596. <HI>What Mortal can re&s;i&s;t the Yawn
of Gods?]</HI> This ver&s;e is truly Homerical, as is
the conclu&s;ion of the Action, where the great
Mother compo&s;es all, in the &s;ame manner as
Minerva at the period of the Ody&s;&s;ey.&mdash;It
may indeed &s;eem a very &s;ingular Epita&s;is of a
Poem, to end as this does, with a <HI>Great Yawn;</HI>
but we mu&s;t con&s;ider it as the <HI>Yawn of a God,</HI>
and of powerful effects. Nor is it out of Na|ture,
mo&s;t long and grave coun&s;els concluding
in this very manner: Nor without Authority,

the incomparable Spencer having ended one of
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his works with a <HI>Rear,</HI>

whereof are de&s;cribed as the Cata&s;trophe of
his Poem.</P>
<P>VER. 597. <HI>Churches and Chappels,</HI> &amp;c.] The
Progre&s;s of this Yawn is judicious, natural, and
worthy to be noted. Fir&s;t it &s;eizeth the
Churches and Chappels; then catcheth the
Schools, where tho' the boys be unwilling to
&s;leep, the Ma&s;ters are not: Next We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,
much more hard indeed to &s;ubdue, and
not totally put to &s;ilence even by the Godde&s;s:
Then the Convocation, which tho' extreamly
de&s;irous to &s;peak, $et cannot: Even the Hou&s;e
of Commons, ju&s;tly called the Sen&s;e of the
Nation, is <HI>l$$t</HI> (that is to &s;ay <HI>&s;u&s;pended)</HI> during
the Yawn (far be it from our Author to &s;ug|ge&s;t
it could be lo&s;t any longer!) but it &s;pread|eth
at large over all the re&s;t of the Kingdom,
to &s;uch a degree, that Palinurus him&s;elf (tho'
as incapable of &s;leeping as Jupiter) yet noddeth
for a moment: the effect of which, tho' ever
&s;o momentary, could not but cau&s;e &s;ome Relax|ation,
for the time, in all publick affairs.</P>
<P>VER. 606, 608.] The&s;e Ver&s;es were written
many years ago, and may be found in the State-Poems
of that time. So that Scriblerus is Mi&s;|taken,
or whoever el&s;e wrote the Argument
prefixt to this Book, where it is &s;aid, &startq;the effects
of the Yawn are not unfelt at this day.&endq;</P>

they give us a Catalogue, con&s;tantly call for

help on the Mu&s;es, who as the Daughters of

<P>But our Poet had yet another rea&s;on for putting
this Task upon the Mu&s;e; that all be&s;ides being
<HI>a&s;leep,</HI> &s;he only could relate what pa&s;&s;ed. SCRIB.</P>
<P>VER. 618. <HI>&mdash;o'er the Land and Deep.]</HI> It
was but nece&s;&s;ary for the Poet to &s;ay this ex|pre&s;sly,
that Britain might not be &s;uppos'd to be
in this condition alone, but in company with all
other Nations of Europe. It had been a mon|&s;trous
impropriety, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to have made
any Nation keep awake, except <HI>France.</HI> But
our Poet, tho' a Satyri&s;t, is an utter enemy to
all National Reflections. SCRIBL.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to lament &s;ufficiently the lo&s;s
of the re&s;t of this Poem, ju&s;t at the opening of

It is to be hop'd however that the Poet com|pleated
it, and that it will not be lo&s;t to po&s;te|rity,
if we may tru&s;t to a Hint given in one
of his Satires.</P>
