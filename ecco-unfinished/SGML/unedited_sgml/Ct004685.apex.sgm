WAYS AND MEANS; OR, <HI>A TRIP TO DOVER.</HI></P>
<P>A COMEDY, IN THREE ACTS, As it is Performed at the <HI>THEATRE-ROYAL,</HI> HAY-MARKET.</P>
<P>WRITTEN BY GEORGE COLMAN, Junior.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Reader of the following Comedy is a reader of New&s;papers in general, he will, probably, &s;it down to peru&s;e it with &s;ome prejudice in it's disfavour. To do away this prejudice, it is recommended to begin where he would naturally fini&s;h; and read the <HI>Epilogue</HI> fir&s;t. The grovelling <HI>Doer</HI> of daily Papers has, there, been di&s;turbed in his occupation: and who that di&s;turbs a Scavenger, while he is driving his dirty vehicle through the town, is expected to e&s;cape without being plentifully be&s;pat|tered?</P>
<P>That the pre&s;ent Piece has experienced this kind of na&s;ty revenge, is obvious: and, in mo&s;t of the publick prints, it has been</P>
<L>"Winnow'd with &s;o rough a wind,</L>
<L>"That even its Corn has &s;eem'd as light as Chaff,</L>
<L>"And good from bad found no partition!"</L>
<P>The &s;orene&s;s which the venal &s;pinners of malicious paragraph have evinced, on this occa&s;ion, is an acknowledgment that they feel them&s;elves clo&s;ely de&s;cribed in the Epi|logue. It is a cap, which, with &s;ome very few exceptions, (as fitly as "your barber's chair fits all"&mdash;very oppo&s;ite ex|tremities,) fits all their <HI>heads.</HI> The thick head, the &s;oft head, the block-head, or any head.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
The few heads it does <HI>not</HI> fit&mdash;the im|partial heads of New&s;paper critici&s;m&mdash;&s;acrcely, perhaps, exceeding the heads of Cerberus in number&mdash;cannot be wounded by the expo&s;ure of their community. They may laugh, indeed, like Fal&s;taff, at the ap|pearance of his ragged regiment, and cry&mdash;</P>
<P>'If I am not a&s;hamed of my <HI>brethren,</HI> I am a &s;ouc'd gurnet! A hundred and fifty tatter'd prodigals, lately come from &s;wine-keeping; from eating draffs and hu&s;ks!" but they may, al&s;o, &s;ay, "for their <HI>malice,</HI> I know not where they had that, and for their <HI>p$o&s;titution&mdash;</HI>I am &s;ure they never learnt that of <HI>Me."</HI></P>
<P>Men of candour and &s;hrewd remark, pub|lickly chronicled for unbia&s;s'd opinion.&mdash;The Bees of Critici&s;m, who are pleas'd in &s;electing the &s;weets of an Author, when he has any, and &s;eldom &s;ting till they are provoked; it would be wanton, and ab&s;urd to attack: but the <HI>Grubs&mdash;</HI>the canker|worms&mdash;in&s;ects generated from corruption, and detrimental to the fair fruits of indu&s;try&mdash;every labourer in the Dramatick vine|yard is doing good, when he treads on them. Pity it is the <HI>Grubs</HI> are &s;o very nu|merous! Pity, that the Canker-worms can prey upon more than the produce of &s;cenick fiction! and that many re&s;pectable and flouri&s;hing branches of this kingdom are &s;uf|fer'd to be blighted by their pe&s;tilential pol|lution!</P>
<P>The Calumny heap'd on individuals, in daily prints, generally convey'd with art
<PB N="5" REF="4">
&s;ufficient to elude the letter of the Law, is notorious, and calls aloud for reform. The liberty of the Pre&s;s is profaned by the licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s of the New&s;papers. It becomes a &s;anctuary for the wor&s;t of all a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins&mdash;the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of private character&mdash;the man|glers of reputation, and the dark murderers of the peace of families!</P>
<P>The trader in a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination is &s;eldom with|out a double calling: The Bravo finds fre|quent practice in the capacity of Pander. In New&s;papers, the qualifications for either are in&s;eparable; and the ruffian, who &s;tabs with &s;lander and defamation, is &s;een gro&s;sly &s;erving the purpo&s;es of employers, who will pay the price of his venality.&mdash;The ab|ject tool of tho&s;e who lu&s;t for fame, and conde&s;cend to hire a de&s;picable animal to procure it!</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted, in the &s;illy triumph of vapid Citici&s;m, after con&s;idering <HI>Ways and Means</HI> as inferior to the Author's more early production, <HI>Inkle and Yarico,</HI> that little can be expected from the future efforts of a pen, which already manife&s;ts imbecillity, and promi&s;es annual declen&s;ion. Direct prai&s;e never gratifies &s;o effectually as unin|tentional commendation: and when the Author declares Inkle and Yarico, though <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> acted, to have been <HI>&s;ub&s;equently</HI> written, he cannot help &s;miling, more, per|haps, with contempt than plea&s;ure, at the
<PB N="6" REF="5">
unde&s;igned compliment which pronounces his progre&s;&s;ive improvement.</P>
<P>This Comedy, however, has completely an&s;wered his expectations; which were too limited to expo&s;e him to much di&s;appoint|ment. Not attempting to fix &s;erious atten|tion by his &s;tory, he &s;ees it, with indifference, receive as little as he has be&s;tow'd upon it. Laugh and whim were his objects; and the mirth and good humour of his audi|ence, whatever malice or mi&s;repre&s;entation may affirm to the contrary, have convinced him that his de&s;ign is accompli&s;h'd.</P>

<P>O never fear: if the girls are aver&s;e to it; and they, at our parting, like &s;imple dam|&s;els in romance, bewail'd their cruel fate, while we, like true knights errant, promis'd to re&s;cue them from confinement.

<P>You mi&s;take me, I had too much honour to impo&s;e on my Harriet's amiable &s;im|plicity; and have the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation for mar|rying merely to make a fortune. In the&s;e in|tere&s;ted ca&s;es, if we keep up appearances, after marriage, the wife becomes a clog and incum|brance; if we throw off the ma&s;k, we are mak|ing a worthy woman, perhaps, mi&s;erable, who

I heard him, like a high wind, thro' the cracks of the old family wain&s;cot. He little dreams of what's to happen before he wakes. Where can Scruple be all this while? He promis'd to be on the watch, as &s;oon as every thing was &s;ilent; but he's &s;o cur&s;ed &s;low, and backward in this bu&s;ine&s;s! If I was not pretty &s;ure that one woman is as much as any one can manage, I &s;hould be tempted to take his nymph away with|out waiting for him. It's &s;o damn'd dark too, that there's no being certain of his door. The chair was a lucky thought; we &s;hould have made &s;ome confounded mi&s;take without it, I believe.

<P>Our conduct, Sir David, is not &s;o culpable as you imagine.
