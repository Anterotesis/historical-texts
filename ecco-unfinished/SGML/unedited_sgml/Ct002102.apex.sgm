<P>DISSIPATION.</P>
<P>A COMEDY, IN FIVE ACTS; AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Comedy having abided the deci&s;ion of the public, having undergone the &s;trictures of critici&s;m, and, notwith&s;tanding its numerous errors, having fortunately met with general approbation, the author hopes he may, in conjunction with other di&s;po&s;ers of the drama, be indulged with a few re|marks of his own.</P>
<P>The great objection to this play has been the want of plot, an objection which the author will not pre|tend to di&s;pute; but then he begs it may be con&s;i|dered, that his chief aim in writing was to draw a lively picture of the manners of high life, characte|ri&s;ed by an ea&s;y indifference to the vi&s;&s;icitudes of fortune, and a kind of indolent acceptance of every fa&s;hionable enjoyment; he therefore imagined an in|tricacy of plot would ill accord with the delineation of per&s;onages, who would not them&s;elves undergo the fatigue of engaging in a multiplicity of bn&s;ine&s;s, to promote either their deare&s;t intere&s;ts, or their fonde&s;t plea&s;ures. To &s;upply this defect, the author has endeavoured to &s;upport, through five acts, a plea&s;ant laughable dialogue, heightened by &s;tage &s;itu|ation; an undertaking, in his opinion, full as diffi|cult as the invention of fable. How far he has &s;uc|ceeded, is now &s;ubmitted to the candid con&s;ideration of the reader.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much concerning the reception of the play before the curtain, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to mention the treatment it has met with behind.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, has taken away &s;everal <HI>witty</HI> things from this comedy, which proba|bly would have had a <HI>&s;triking</HI> and <HI>very violent</HI> effect; but &s;hould he, in his <HI>great dearth</HI> of genius, ever venture to introduce them in any future production
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
of his own, and the audience &s;hould not immediate|ly perceive the <HI>difference,</HI> the original author will cer|tainly put in his claim to all the merit they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>But to be &s;erious&mdash;To the proprietors of the thea|tre all thanks are due for their care, attention, and liberality in getting up this play; and to Mr. Lin|ley in particular, for his politene&s;s in offering, and his &s;kill in compo&s;ing, the mu&s;ic introduced in the third act.</P>
<P>Of the performers, for their diligence and their un|rivalled talents, the author cannot &s;ay enough; like Sir Andrew Acorn, in the comedy, it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to do them ju&s;tice, and, therefore, he won't undertake it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Abington's elegant deportment, her perfect knowledge of poli&s;hed life, the graceful ea&s;e and na|tural &s;prightline&s;s with which &s;he plays the part of Lady Rentle&s;s, can only be equalled by the chearful|ne&s;s and affability with which &s;he accepted it.</P>
<P>Mr. King's excellence may not be dwelt upon, le&s;t from the recollection of Puff, in the Critic, the real tribute of applau&s;e might force an improper &s;mile.</P>
<P>Mr. Par&s;ons&mdash;but it is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;erious about him&mdash;from the moment he appears on the &s;tage to the end of the piece, he neither walks, looks, or &s;peaks, without calling forth the ri&s;ibility of the audience; the part may have &s;ome merit, but with &s;uch &s;upport, that character mu&s;t be poorly drawn indeed that would not plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Palmer, Mr. Baddeley, and the re&s;t of the performers, are equally intitled to the gratitude of the author, but for the critic rea&s;on, hinted at above, he will not venture to enlarge further on their com|mendation.</P>

<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough of mu&s;ic, my dear Harriot&mdash;though you came here ye&s;terday, I have &s;carce had time to repeat to you how inexpre&s;&s;ively happy I am.</P>

<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, but you do not; for I was going to a&s;&s;ure you, that the &s;tile of living, and the manners of Lord and Lady Rentle&s;s, which I &s;ee you di&s;approve, are as unplea&s;ing to me as&mdash;</P>

<P>Believe me, I fore&s;aw your apprehen&s;ions. But re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, my deare&s;t Harriot, that tho' Lord Rentle&s;s is my guardian, and it &s;eem'd my father's will that I &s;hould live immediately under his Lord&s;hip's eye, yet I entirely di&s;like his mode of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, entirely, no doubt of it. Who would have imagined, when you came in a di&s;creet manner to &s;olicit the honour of my fair hand after our meeting at Scar|bro', that the &s;entimental Charles Woodbine was the ward of one of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable libertines about town.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Harriot, I cannot allow you to trifle, un|le&s;s you will a&s;&s;ure me, you are convinc'd I mean to pur&s;ue that plan when we are united&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O fye! And can you think that I, who propo&s;e to pa&s;s my life in a quiet, good, dome&s;tic way in the country, watching my flowering &s;hrubs, nur&s;ing my birds, and, and&mdash;in &s;hort, do you imagine I will give my hand to a man who is wedded to this di&s;&s;ipated town? Oh, no.</P>

<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce, gentlemen, for a moment, and I will explain my&s;elf. Though fa&s;hionable indulgencies may have led me into error, I hope I am above a deliberate fal&s;hood to conceal it. The depo&s;it of Charles's deeds with Mr. Labradore, was merely to &s;upply a temporary nece&s;&s;ity&punc; but he will find from my &s;teward, that I had the means, as well as the intention, of re&s;toring all his property unhurt, and Sir Andrew <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;ee this matter clearly, at lea&s;t.</P>

<P>Pray though, my Lord, do you in London call this taking care of your ward's affairs in the country&mdash;But there we know nothing.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROBE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir Andrew, there is one thing known and agreed upon every where, that no extravagance or nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould tempt a man to violate his tru&s;t. But let us not be unkind; &s;omething may be allowed to the incaution of youth, and &s;omething to the too general di&s;&s;ipation of the times.</P>

<P>Nay, Mr. Labradore, remember our bargain was only for hereafter, and I'm &s;ure my Lord will in proper time fulfil the engagement&mdash;but let me do one piece of imme|diate ju&s;tice. Come, Sir Andrew, with your con&s;ent I'll place this hand where I know it will be mo&s;t valued. <STAGE>[Taking Harriot.]</STAGE> Poor thing! it &s;han't go into the country to enjoy a <HI>t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t$te</HI> with its papa.</P>

<P>Come, my friends, as harmony &s;eems again re&s;tored, we will now retire to celebrate the union of this de&s;erving couple; and at the &s;ame time let us reflect, that the pre|&s;ent rage for di&s;&s;ipation, by treating lightly all the &s;erious engagements of life, is at once the bane of filial affection, parental tenderne&s;s, and nuptial love.</P>
