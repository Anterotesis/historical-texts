<HEAD>An ACCOUNT
OF THE
LIFE and WRITINGS
OF
OPPIAN.</HEAD>
<P>AS the E&s;teem we have for the Writings of an
admired Author naturally leads us into an
enquiry concerning his Country and per&s;onal
Character, together with the Time and Cir|cum&s;tances
of his Life; &s;o we generally receive the be&s;t
information in the&s;e particulars from &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in
the &s;ame Writings that engaged our Curio&s;ity. How|ever
the <HI>Ancients</HI> may vary in their Accounts, <HI>Oppian</HI>
him&s;elf, in dedicating his <HI>Halieuticks</HI> to <HI>Severus</HI> and his
Son <HI>Caracalla,</HI> has a&s;certain'd the time in which he wrote
his fir&s;t Piece; and becau&s;e we find him only in this
Poem complimenting both Father and Son as then
reigning with joynt Power, and the &s;ame Rea&s;ons that
fir&s;t moved him to write obliged him to be as &s;peedy
as po&s;&s;ible in his application to his Royal Patrons: 'tis
highly probable he pre&s;ented this Piece, and this only,
to <HI>Severus</HI> in that Emperour's Life time. <HI>Ritter&s;hu&s;ius,</HI>
the mo&s;t learned Editor of his Works, has made a great
&s;lip in fixing his Birth in the reign of <HI>Severus;</HI> which
<PB N="2" REF="9">
taking in only the compa&s;s of eighteen years, it is
very unlikely he &s;hould at &s;uch an age fini&s;h &s;o com|pleat
a Poem. We mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e then that he might
be born in the former part of <HI>Commodus</HI>'s Reign; which
cannot be charged with the like ab&s;urdity as the for|mer
Opinion.</P>
<P>All who &s;peak of him (except <HI>Suidas</HI>) agree that he
was born at <HI>Anazarbus,</HI> a City of <HI>Cilicia;</HI> which place
likewi&s;e gave birth to tho&s;e eminent Phy&s;icians <HI>A&s;cle|piades</HI>
and <HI>Dio&s;corides. Suidas</HI> indeed makes him a Na|tive
of <HI>Corycus;</HI> but <HI>Oppian</HI> refutes that him&s;elf in the
third <HI>Halieutick</HI> by di&s;tingui&s;hing his Countrymen from
their neighbours the <HI>Corycians.</HI> His Father <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI>
was a man of wealth and figure in <HI>Anazarbus;</HI> but
being a re&s;erved and philo&s;ophical per&s;on, when <HI>Se|verus,</HI>
taking a progre&s;s through <HI>Cilicia,</HI> made his en|trance
into that City, he avoided the hurry and fati|gue
of that Solemnity, and hoped his Studies might
have excu&s;ed the formality of attendance. But <HI>Seve|rus,</HI>
a Prince of a rough and &s;u&s;picious temper, took this
as an in&s;tance of contempt, and re&s;ented his non-ap|pearance
&s;o far as to bani&s;h the old Gentleman into
the I&s;land of <HI>Malta.</HI> The pious Son could not de|&s;ert
his Father under this unhappy circum&s;tance, but
voluntarily accompanied him in his Exile. Perhaps it
was to this melancholly Retirement that we are in|debted
for one of the fine&s;t Remains of Antiquity:
indeed it too often happens that the noble&s;t Produ|ctions
of great Wits, are owing to the misfortunes of
their Authors. Men of gallant Spirits fru&s;trate the
malicious intents of Fortune, and lay the foundation
of their Glory in Di&s;appointments. 'Twas thus <HI>Virgil</HI>
and <HI>Horace</HI> were introduced into the acquaintance of
the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> who made <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> their Patron, and Po|&s;terity
their Admirers. <HI>Oppian</HI> had doubtle&s;s been en|gaged
in tho&s;e Diver&s;ions he could de&s;cribe &s;o well,
<PB N="3" REF="10">
with as keen a pur&s;uit as other young Gentlemen of
his age, and perhaps with no other views; but Ad|ver&s;ity
only could make them the materials of his &s;tu|dies,
and refine his Recreations into Poetry.</P>
<P>In the time of his Bani&s;hment having lei&s;ure and op|portunity,
both by reading and experience, to en|quire
into the Nature of Animals, he compo&s;ed three
Poems, each containing five Books, of the Nature,
and &s;everal kinds of <HI>Fi&s;hes, Bea&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Birds,</HI> and
the manner of taking them; which few or none had
attempted in Ver&s;e before. <HI>Epicharmus</HI> indeed and
many be&s;ides had &s;tudied the Nature of Animals; and
others had treated of the Arts u&s;ed in Fi&s;hing and
Hunting, but mo&s;t of them wrote after a dry man|ner,
and contented them&s;elves with a bare recital of
Names, without any thing Poetical in their Compo&s;i|tions,
but the Ver&s;e; and none of them had &s;trength
of Genius &s;ufficient to take in the whole Subject, or
wrote with that &s;ublimity of thought, and accuracy of
judgment, as our Author has done.</P>
<P><HI>Oppian</HI> had doubtle&s;s peru&s;ed the Works of the An|cient
Naturali&s;ts, particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> though
he often differs in opinion from that great Man, and
&s;ometimes di&s;agrees with him in account of matters of
fact; he has be&s;ides many Names and Relations of
<HI>Fi&s;hes,</HI> which are not to be found in <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Colle|ction,
or in any other Naturali&s;t. The la&s;t Book of
his <HI>Cynegeticks</HI> (for it is certain he wrote five) is lo&s;t;
of the <HI>Hixeuticks</HI> there is is only a Greek Paraphra&s;e
remaining; though the Learned have been long amu|&s;ed
with expectations of the Original Poem, which is
&s;aid to have lain concealed in the <HI>Italian</HI> Libraries.
But by lucky chance we have his mo&s;t fini&s;hed Piece the
<HI>Halieuticks</HI> entire; and Time which, as Sr. <HI>William
Temple</HI> &s;ays, <HI>like a River, lets things of worth and weight
&s;ink and be lo&s;t, but carries with it the light and trifling,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="11">
has yet wafted down to us this &s;olid and valuable Re|main
of Antiquity. This, though the fir&s;t compo&s;ed,
&s;eems to have been the mo&s;t laboured and correct of
all his Writings: There appears le&s;s of youthful heat,
and fla&s;h of fancy, and greater depth of judgment in
his <HI>Halieuticks</HI> than in his <HI>Cynegeticks:</HI> The Compli|ment
at the end of the former is more artificial and
ju&s;t, and not &s;tretcht into &s;uch youthful flights as that
in the beginning of the latter. <HI>Oppian</HI> knew that it
was this his fir&s;t Work on which all his hopes depended,
his own, and (what was much dearer to him) his Fa|ther's
Relea&s;ment. He therefore cho&s;e an uncommon,
though in it&s;elf a plea&s;ant Subject; which he adorned
with all the Embelli&s;hments it was capable of receiving
from a bright and luxuriant Fancy tempered with &s;ound|ne&s;s
and &s;trength of Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Oppian</HI> thought it much more honourable to merit
his Relea&s;e by &s;ome valuable Work, than to endeavour
to extort it by Prayer. In this he &s;how'd a greater
reach of thought than Ovid in tho&s;e tedious <HI>De&s;cri|ptions
of his Bani&s;hment.</HI> Querulous people are gene|rally
but little regarded; they le&s;&s;en them&s;elves by
their impatience, and give an unea&s;ine&s;s to the Hearer:
but he who &s;ings his own misfortunes has this di&s;ad|vantage
by his Poetry, that all men will think tho&s;e
mi&s;eries, which can be &s;o artfully de&s;cribed, to be little
le&s;s than Fiction. Our Author was &s;o cautious of this,
that he takes care never to mention his own Exile;
only once, when it was almo&s;t unavoidable, he touches
upon the mi&s;eries of Bani&s;hment, but with &s;o fine a
turn, as &s;hews the delicacy of his ta&s;te and exactne&s;s
of his judgment. Nor was he deceived in the hopes
he had entertained of plea&s;ing the Emperour; for
when, according to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e times, he had
in a publick Theatre recited his <HI>Halieuticks, Severus</HI>
was &s;o ravi&s;hed with the Sweetne&s;s of the Compo&s;ition,
<PB N="5" REF="12">
and the Novelty of the Subject, that he bid him ask
what he would, nothing &s;hould be denied him. The
pious Son had now an opportunity of obtaining all he
de&s;ired, the re&s;toring his Father <HI>Age&s;ilaus</HI> to his Liber|ty
and Country. His in&s;i&s;ting only on this, after &s;o ge|neral
an offer, could not but very much increa&s;e that
e&s;teem his per&s;onal merit had before entitled him to;
and that Prince not only granted him his reque&s;t, but
pre&s;ented him with an additional reward of a<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">3506 Staters of Gold each containing about <HI>16s. 4d</HI> of our money.</NOTE> <HI>Stater</HI>
of Gold for each Ver&s;e; a generous and princely Gra|tuity,
and an hand&s;ome Compliment to mode&s;t Worth,
and Poetry.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Writers of his Life &s;ay he writ many ad|mirable
Poems, be&s;ides tho&s;e of <HI>Fi&s;hing, Hunting</HI> and
<HI>Fowling;</HI> and <HI>Oppian</HI> him&s;elf informs us that he had a
de&s;ign to do honour to his Country in an <HI>Epic</HI> Poem,
of which he gives us a Specimen in his De&s;cription of
the inundation of the <HI>Orontes,</HI> and the draining of that
River by <HI>Hercules;</HI> at the conclu&s;ion of which &s;tory he
thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf;
<Q><L><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cyneget 2 Book ver&s;e 156.</NOTE> But when I &s;ing my deare&s;t Country's prai&s;e,</L>
<L>This Theme &s;hall &s;hine in more exalted Lays.</L>
<L>Mean while the Scenes of Sylvan Toil excu&s;e,</L>
<L>And hunting Arts engage the willing Mu&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>Our Author had doubtle&s;s a Genius &s;ufficient for
<HI>Epic</HI> Poetry, but it is not probable he lived to begin,
much le&s;s to fini&s;h that intended Work; for &s;oon after
his favourable reception at the Court of <HI>Severus,</HI> when
being returned to his Country this unfortunate good
<PB N="6" REF="13">
Man had begun to enjoy the plea&s;ures of that Liberty
the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> had obtained for him, he was &s;eized with
the Plague, which put a period to his Life in the thir|tieth
year of his age. Thus died <HI>Oppian</HI> the la&s;t of the
<HI>Ancient Poets:</HI> the Citizens of <HI>Anazarbus</HI> were extream|ly
concerned at &s;o irrecoverable a lo&s;s, in being depri|ved
of one who was already the Glory of his Nation.
But nothing could be done more than to be&s;tow the
highe&s;t honours on his Funeral. To expre&s;s the high
opinion they had of him, and what hopes they had con|ceived
from &s;o promi&s;ing a <HI>Genius,</HI> they erected him a
Statue with this pompous In&s;cription.</P>
<Q><L>Though much they lov'd, no <HI>Heliconian</HI> Maid</L>
<L>Could <HI>Oppian</HI> &s;ave, or &s;ullen Fate per&s;wade;</L>
<L>The rigid <HI>De&s;tinies</HI> &s;uperiour Pow'r</L>
<L>Snapt quick the thread, and fixt the ha&s;ten'd hour.</L>
<L>But had the&s;e <HI>Si&s;ters</HI> like the <HI>Nine</HI> been kind,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Oppian</HI>'s life to thrice ten years confin'd;</L>
<L>All the In&s;pir'd had him their Chief allow'd,</L>
<L>And all to his their humbler Lawrels bow'd.</L></Q>
<P>As for the other part of the Character of our Poet,
which we have not in the Hi&s;torical Accounts of his
Life, we may in a great mea&s;ure draw it from his
Writings. For though <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Catullus</HI> would have
us believe that lu&s;cious Ver&s;es are con&s;i&s;tent with per|&s;onal
Cha&s;tity; yet it is certain one may give a &s;hrewd
gue&s;s at the Manners, Principles, and Di&s;po&s;ition of
an Author, from the uniform Character, and general
Tendency of his Writings; becau&s;e every one makes
choice of &s;uch Subjects, and gives them &s;uch a turn
<PB N="7" REF="14">
as is mo&s;t agreeable to his own Temper. Now there
is &s;uch an inartificial and unaffected &s;train of Piety
and Good Nature in every Page of our Author's works,
as had we no Hi&s;tory of his Life, would repre&s;ent him
to us under the amiable Character of a young Gentle|man
of the livelie&s;t Wit, &s;weeten'd with the mo&s;t en|gaging
Virtue, and ennobled by Religion. In all his
Digre&s;&s;ions and Reflections, he recommends Virtue
with &s;o agreeable an air, and di&s;countenances Vice af|ter
&s;o moving a manner, as &s;hows him to have been
the <HI>be&s;t good Man,</HI> but far from having the <HI>wor&s;t natur'd
Mu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I could never find that Natural Affection, which the
<HI>Greeks</HI> call <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;o well expre&s;t in any Poet as him.
His Similitudes and Allu&s;ions have almo&s;t all a refe|rence
to this; His Images are all made up of Piety,
Friend&s;hip, Gratitude and Innocence. No one ever
better mixt the Gentleman and the Philo&s;opher than
this Author has done. He &s;hews his Learning and Edu|cation
by many fine <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> and <HI>Digre&s;&s;ions,</HI> but without
the lea&s;t affectation, and only when the Subject re|quires
it. His <HI>Moral Reflections</HI> are very fine and ju|dicious,
as tho&s;e on <HI>Sympathy, Love, Jealou&s;ie, human
Indu&s;try, the Nature of Man,</HI> and the like. His <HI>Reli|gious
Sentiments,</HI> con&s;idering he was a Heathen, are ve|ry
con&s;picuous in his account of <HI>Providence, the Nece&s;|&s;ity
of divine Aid, and the Puni&s;hments that attend the Vi|tious.</HI>
His <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> or <HI>good &s;en&s;e</HI> was no le&s;s apparent,
in that under the mi&s;eries of Bani&s;hment, he could
refrain not only from railing again&s;t the Cruelty of
others, but even from complaining of his own Hard|&s;hips.
As he was capable of improving every thing,
&s;o he made choice of a Subject which though noble in
it's &s;elf, was yet too much neglected (as it is now) by
the Poets of tho&s;e days, who, either through want
of reading, or deterred by the &s;eeming difficulty of
<PB N="8" REF="15">
managing it with &s;ucce&s;s, would not undertake &s;o la|borious
a Task.</P>
<P><HI>Natural Hi&s;tory</HI> is a divine &s;peculation to the Reli|gious,
and no le&s;s agreeable to the Curious; as there
is no Subject more excellent in it's nature, or more capa|ble
of being adorned, if it fall into able hands, &s;o
there is none that reflects a greater honour on an Au|thor,
or is more conducive to the ends of Poetry, the
Delight and In&s;truction of the Reader. The glorious
Dangers and Exploits of Heroes, the Splendour and
Triumphs that attend Victory, which are the u&s;ual
Subjects of an <HI>Epic</HI> Poem, are things that we admire
in common with the gro&s;s of mankind; but to trace
the foot&s;teps of Providence among inferiour ranks of
Creatures, and to contemplate their con&s;tant Regula|rity
in promoting the ends of their Creation, is an
Entertainment which only refined Under&s;tandings are
capable of reli&s;hing. The De&s;ign of an <HI>Epic Poet</HI> is
either to enforce &s;ome Political Maxim, or to pay an
artful Compliment to his Prince and Country in the
per&s;ons of their Ance&s;tors: but the <HI>Naturali&s;t</HI> pur&s;ues
a more noble end, while by pointing out the Beauties
of Nature, he imprints in our minds worthy and ratio|nal
Notions of the Deity. Be&s;ides the Nature of his
Subject obliges him in a great mea&s;ure to avoid tho&s;e
Corruptions, which other Poets have introduced into
the Heathen Theology, by engaging their Gods in
amorous Intrigues, Quarrels, and &s;ometimes in actual
War again&s;t one another. The Deities of the <HI>Natu|rali&s;t,</HI>
each within his own Di&s;trict, are employed in
the Functions u&s;ually a&s;&s;igned to their Natures, and
promoting the good of the Univer&s;e in Subordination
to <HI>Jupiter</HI> their Supreme; which is allow'd to be the
mo&s;t rational Sy&s;tem of the Heathen Divinity.</P>
<P>'Tis one of the mo&s;t admirable Secrets in Poetry to
heighten &s;mall things by a noble manner of Expre&s;|&s;ion;
<PB N="9" REF="16">
the meaner therefore any Subject is, the more
capable it is of being adorned. As there is a regular
Gradation of created Beings from Man down to the
lowe&s;t Vegetable, the <HI>Naturali&s;t</HI> &s;eems to have the
advantage in a Subject which is capable of being im|proved
by borrowing it's Metaphors and Allu&s;ions from
Objects of a &s;uperiour Nature. His Trees and Plants
are influenced with the pa&s;&s;ions of De&s;ire and Aver|&s;ion,
Joy and Grief; and his Animals &s;eem to rival
Mankind in their Virtues and Perfections. The <HI>Na|turali&s;t</HI>
and <HI>Epic</HI> Poet borrow mutually from each
other: the one, in magnifying the Character of his
Hero, finds him&s;elf obliged to fetch his Compari&s;ons
from the mo&s;t remarkable Qualities of inferiour Crea|tures,
the other, after a more ea&s;y and natural man|ner,
adds a dignity to his Subject by alluding to the
Hero. The Imagination is agreeably &s;urprized at the
figure the Vegetive Creation makes under the promo|tion
to which it is advanced by the daring Metaphors
of the Poet: but in point of In&s;truction the Hi&s;tory
of Animals claims the preference. Tho&s;e Faculties in
the Souls of Brutes, which bear an Analogy to the
Will and Pa&s;&s;ions, and enable them to act with a re|&s;emblance
of the Virtues and Vices of Mankind, fur|ni&s;h
the Poet with frequent occa&s;ions of in&s;inuating
the Precepts of Morality after the mo&s;t ea&s;y and per|&s;wa&s;ive
manner. While he repre&s;ents in the mo&s;t
lively colours their natural Affection and Piety, their
generous Friend&s;hip, Courage, and Contempt of death,
he &s;eems to upbraid Mankind either with the want of
tho&s;e Virtues, or not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them in a far &s;uperiour
degree. The <HI>Wi&s;e&s;t of Men,</HI> when he bids the <HI>Sluggard
go to the Ant, con&s;ider her ways, and be wi&s;e,</HI> by recom|mending
to his imitation the par&s;imonious <HI>In&s;ect,</HI> ra|ther
than the mo&s;t indu&s;trious of his own <HI>Species,</HI> &s;eems
to imply that the &s;hame of being excelled by an infe|riour
<PB N="10" REF="17">
Creature is a &s;tronger motive to Virtue than the
mo&s;t &s;hining Example. When we ob&s;erve the Dan|gers
and Mi&s;chiefs the &s;ame Animals expo&s;e them|&s;elves
to by their Folly and Intemperance, we are
convinced of a very u&s;eful Truth, that Mi&s;ery is the
natural Effect of Vice.</P>
<P>I know there is an ingenious <HI>Gentleman</HI> who is very
angry with the <HI>Water Poets.</HI> He in particular ridicules
<HI>Sannazarius,</HI> and other Authors of <HI>Pi&s;catory Eclogues;</HI>
though that <HI>Writer</HI> gained more Reputation by tho&s;e
Eclogues than all his other Works. <HI>Rapin</HI> &s;eems to
di&s;approve of them in general; but the Rea&s;ons he
gives are but of little weight. Every one knows that
no Employment has more intervals of Lei&s;ure, and
opportunities of Contemplation than that of <HI>Fi&s;hing;</HI>
and <HI>Suidas</HI> ob&s;erves that <HI>Pan</HI> was accounted the com|mon
God both of Fi&s;hers and Shepherds. If the Wa|ters
contain in them nothing but what is uncomfort|able
and dreadful, 'tis very &s;trange that <HI>Ovid,</HI> who na|turally
loved what was &s;oft and agreeable, &s;hould ever
have made any Attempt in this kind; and that Mr.
<HI>Waller</HI> &s;hould have given us a Specimen of the <HI>Halieu|tick</HI>
Strain in his <HI>Battle of the &s;ummer I&s;lands.</HI> The <HI>Ita|lians,</HI>
upon the revival of Learning, who perhaps had
even then as nice a Ta&s;t as any of our modern Cri|ticks,
were &s;o fond of the Sea, that they attempted
<HI>Pi&s;catory Plays</HI> with good &s;ucce&s;s, and compo&s;ed <HI>Dra|maticks</HI>
Pieces, wherein <HI>Syrens</HI> aud <HI>Tritons</HI> bore the
greate&s;t &s;hare. Neither was this any arbitrary Change,
for every one knows that <HI>Theocritus,</HI> who is the Stan|dard
of <HI>Bucolick</HI> Writing, has given us a <HI>Pi&s;catory Idyl|lium</HI>
Whoever affirms that there are no beauteous
Images to be drawn from the Waters, and that no|thing
is to found there but Objects of Dread and
Horrour, was certainly never at Sea but in a Storm.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18">
But to return to our Author; the Stile of <HI>Oppian</HI> is
florid and copious, but always pure and unaffected;
his Epithets are proper and expre&s;&s;ive, his Metaphors
daring, but always ju&s;t; as <HI>Bodin</HI> well expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>Ex|uberat
Oppianus mir&acirc; verborum copi&acirc;, non &s;ine magno &s;plen|dore
&s;ententiarum.</HI> Our Author has made choice of a
Method peculiar to him&s;elf, and very proper for the
Subjects he was about to treat of, in which he is exact
and uniform: his Poems of <HI>Fowling</HI> and <HI>Hunting</HI> were
doubtle&s;s formed upon the &s;ame Plan with the <HI>Halieu|ticks.</HI>
But above all <HI>Oppian</HI> is admirable in his <HI>Simili|tudes;</HI>
no one u&s;es them more frequently, or &s;ets them
off to greater advantage. As <HI>Similitudes</HI> are the mo&s;t
lively Embelli&s;hments, and the &s;tronge&s;t colours of
Poetry, &s;o he knew they were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
adorn a Subject &s;omewhat out of the way, and per|haps
not &s;o plea&s;ing to common Readers. Though
I own &s;ome of his Compari&s;ons &s;eem to be a little far|fetcht,
and to have in them more of the Quaintne&s;s
of the Moderns, than the Simplicity of the Ancients.
From the judicious management of the Whole, the
ju&s;tne&s;s and regularity of his Method, the brightne&s;s
and delicacy of his Similitudes, <HI>Scaliger,</HI> and from him
Dr. <HI>Kennet</HI> are very po&s;itive that he had read <HI>Virgil,
and had taken care to be largely indebted to him; and</HI> (adds
he)<HI>by not mi&s;employing tho&s;e trea&s;ures he has &s;hown that he
de&s;erved to borrow them.</HI> I do not deny but that it is
probable <HI>Oppian</HI> had read <HI>Virgil;</HI> yet I am loth to do
my Author any inju&s;tice, by a&s;cribing his perfections
rather to Imitation than Invention.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of <HI>Oppian</HI>'s Judgment is, that con|&s;idering
him&s;elf as a Naturali&s;t as well as a Poet, he
has carefully avoided the Recital of any fabulous Re|ports;
but on the contrary, has taken notice of, and
refuted many vulgar Errours. Sr. <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> com|mends
<HI>Oppian</HI> for his &s;trict regard to truth, when the
<PB N="12" REF="19">
Pro&s;e-Writers of Natural Hi&s;tory are more extravagant
in their Narrations. But for other <HI>Fables</HI> which are
extrin&s;ick to the Hi&s;tory of Nature, he has not &s;cru|pled
to make u&s;e of them to embelli&s;h the Story, and
releive the Reader with an agreeable Digre&s;&s;ion; his
Fictions being &s;uch as are hardly ever to be met with
in common Authors.</P>
<P><HI>Oppian,</HI> as we have &s;aid, having taken all imaginable
care to write &s;omething that might la&s;t to Po&s;terity,
his Works accordingly met with a very favourable ac|ceptance
among the Learned. <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> on <HI>Homer,</HI>
and the <HI>Scholia&s;ts</HI> on <HI>Theocritus, Nicander,</HI> and <HI>Lycophron</HI>
&s;peak of him with e&s;teem, and often quote him as an
Author of worth and credit. As for the treatment
which <HI>Oppian</HI> has met with in the&s;e latter Ages, there
have been &s;everal Editions of him in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI>
Among the re&s;t <HI>Tzetzes</HI> has paraphra&s;ed his <HI>Halieuticks</HI>
in <HI>Greek;</HI> and there is a Tran&s;lation of them into <HI>Latin</HI>
Ver&s;e by <HI>Laurentius Lippius</HI> an Italian, but very in|elegant
and full of Errours. It cannot be denied that
tho&s;e, who have been acquainted with more than the
bare Name, or Title Page of our Author, have all
along given him his ju&s;t prai&s;e. The <HI>Elder Scaliger</HI> is
endle&s;s in his commendation: he calls <HI>him a divine and
incomparable Poet, one skill'd in all parts of Philo&s;ophy, the
mo&s;t perfect Writer among the Greeks, and the only per&s;on
that ever came up to Virgil. His Similitudes</HI> (he ob&s;erves)
<HI>never want either Beauty or &s;trength; that he de&s;cribes eve|ry
thing to the life after the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t natural manner.</HI>
Dr. <HI>Kennet,</HI> (than whom no one was better ver&s;t in
polite Literature) does our Author ju&s;tice in the fol|lowing
Character. <HI>The Dryne&s;s of his Subject, though it
offends &s;ome modern French Criticks, yet has not hindred
him from being e&s;teemed by more knowing Judges, as an Au|thor
little inferiour in Fancy, Art and Language to the
mo&s;t celebrated Ma&s;ters in the Grecian Strain. The begin|ning
<PB N="13" REF="20">
and ending Strokes of each Poem have &s;omething of &s;o
great a Spirit and Turn, as &s;how him to have had a Genius
for much more Heroical Atcheivements in Ver&s;e.</HI> Sr. <HI>Tho.
Brown,</HI> though a &s;evere Cen&s;or of Authors and Opi|nions,
and very &s;paring of his encomiums, cries out
with &s;ome indignation, <HI>It is a great wonder that Oppian</HI>'s
<HI>elegant Lines are &s;o much neglected, &s;urely we hereby reject
one of the be&s;t Epic Poets.</HI> Indeed I know not how it
happens, that there is &s;carce any of the <HI>Ancients</HI> that
de&s;erves more, or meets with le&s;s Regard.</P>
<P>It was this Motive that invited Mr. <HI>Diaper</HI> to make
an E&s;&s;ay on the two fir&s;t Books, which contain the <HI>Na|tural
Hi&s;tory of Fi&s;hes:</HI> as he had a Wit that was capa|ble
of &s;hining on any Subject, &s;o his Tran&s;lation &s;hews
him to have had a peculiar Genius for Natural Hi&s;tory.
Where the Images are brighter than ordinary, he has
&s;omewhat paraphra&s;ed the Author, but no where, I
believe, deviated from his Sen&s;e and Intention. The
Richne&s;s of his Fancy and copious Expre&s;&s;ion maintain
the Character and Spirit of <HI>Oppian,</HI> even while he re|cedes
from the Letter of the Original. His unfortu|nate
Death preventing him from fini&s;hing his intended
Work, I have attempted a Tran&s;lation of the three
la&s;t Books, which are properly <HI>Halieuticks,</HI> and treat
of the <HI>Art of Fi&s;hing.</HI> The Honour I owe the Memo|ry
of my <HI>Fellow Collegian,</HI> and a Zeal for re&s;cuing
<HI>Oppian</HI> from an unde&s;erved Ob&s;curity will plead my
excu&s;e for the Undertaking, as want of Experience
and A&s;&s;i&s;tance will for the Performance.</P>

the Scene of his Poem,'tis but rea&s;onable

modern <HI>Ichthyologi&s;ts</HI> will find them very much divided
in their opinions, and at a lo&s;s to determine what
Fi&s;hes are meant from the ancient Accounts of 'em;
&s;o that whoever would be exact in adju&s;ting their
Names, mu&s;t take the pains of comparing them to|gether,
and not tru&s;t to a &s;ingle Authority.</P>

and <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, and who&s;e Qualities are &s;o re|markable
that they leave us no room to doubt, &s;uch
Names as are already made by other Naturali&s;ts as
Mr. <HI>Willoughby, Grew</HI> and <HI>Charleton,</HI> I have not &s;crupled
to make u&s;e of for genuine Engli&s;h. As we have no

<PB N="224" REF="242">
unknown to our Seas, I have been &s;ometimes obliged
to retain the Original Word, or to borrow <HI>Italian</HI>
Names when they are more agreeable: &s;ome of 'em
I have de&s;cribed by a kind of <HI>Periphra&s;is,</HI> and ventured
to coin new Terms for others, agreeable to the Ety|mology
of the <HI>Greek.</HI> Sometimes the different Sexes
and Ages of a known <HI>Species</HI> which have but one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Name, have different ones in the <HI>Greek;</HI> but this De|fect
is ea&s;ily &s;upplied by the addition of a proper Epi|thet.
Several Fi&s;hes take their Names from Land-Animals,
on the account of &s;ome accidental Mark or
Property, without any Regard to their Shape or &s;pe|cifick
Nature. For (as Sr. <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> righty ob|&s;erves)
'tis a vulgar Errour to &s;uppo&s;e that there are
Fi&s;hes in the Sea analogous to all Creatures on the
Land. In the following Catalogue it would be need|le&s;s
to give any account of Fi&s;hes farther than would
be nece&s;&s;ary for reading the Author; &s;ince &s;o many
Ancients and Moderns have written long Treati&s;es on
this Subject; among the former, <HI>Ari&s;totle, Aelian</HI> and
<HI>Pliny,</HI> of the latter <HI>Aldrovandus, Rondolet, Salvian, Ge&s;ner,
John&s;ton,</HI> and above all Mr. <HI>Willoughby;</HI> who has not
only given a nice and anatomical De&s;cription of Fi&s;hes,
but al&s;o an exact repre&s;entation of their external Fi|gures.
In ob&s;erving the prodigious Variety of their
Shapes, and now excellently the parts of their Bodies
are fitted to the u&s;es which Providence has allotted
them for their pre&s;ervation, the Curious will find an
agreeable Entertainment, and will at once di&s;cover
new Beauties in Nature, and the De&s;criptions of our

different places of their feeding and u&s;ual Re&s;ort, in|tended

the Scene before he proceeded to Action. But with
