<P>AT fir&s;t view it may appear odd, and perhaps indelicate, to in&s;cribe a <HI>maritime</HI> &s;ketch, to an ennobled female per&s;onage; but the title I hope will apologize for my pre&s;umption.

Now I mention critics; let no per&s;on above the degree of a water critic, at|tack my pamphlet; no D. D.'s or LL. D.'s from Aberdeen pre&s;ume to anatomize, becau&s;e my ob&s;er|vations are &s;o near home&mdash;Your Grace will excu&s;e this occa&s;ional parry of critical &s;padres, which like tho&s;e of Portugal &s;tab a man in the dark or back. I have a&s;ked no premium to &s;uppre&s;s this piece, nor a&s;k any for my dedication; I am per&s;onal without &s;currillity, and as I di&s;dain pecuniary ad|vantage
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
obtained by unworthy means, &s;o I wi&s;h no further emolument from my publication than what the public will allow, and innocent amu&s;e|ment may merit. I pre&s;ume your Grace is clear, that a voyager need not vi&s;it Otaheite for luxu|rious dances, licentious manners, u&s;ele&s;s &s;hells, or une&s;&s;ential plants: but that you'll agree with the author, that we traver&s;e the globe for bau|bles, and trea&s;ure up tri&s;les with childi&s;h avidity. In my &s;hort <HI>trip,</HI> the lying &s;pirit of a MANDE|VILLE, and other magnifying travellers, might have galloped &s;orth on the pega&s;us of fal&s;ehood; but I am &s;imple enough to like truth; and therefore offer her quite unadorned to others.</P>
<P>Though your Grace has been long conver&s;ant with a court, I hope the unfa&s;hionable dame will not be an unwelcome vi&s;itor, e&s;pecially as &s;he has whi&s;pered in my ear, that the Duche&s;s of ****** is benevolence it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>A TRIP TO CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>"WHAT," &s;aid a friend of ours one evening over a bottle, "go to Calais in that &s;mall ve&s;&s;el! "The reply was given by one who was fond of &s;ailing, and plea&s;ed at the thought of &s;uch a trip; "Yes, Sir, why not? A &s;mall and &s;ound ve&s;|&s;el is much better than a large and leaky &s;hip; be&s;ides, we have on board many conveniencies, &s;uch as ca&s;es for cordial, lockers for liquor, &s;lips for &s;leeping, fire for frying, and place for provi&s;ion, and if you &s;eem the lea&s;t inclined for &s;uch a trip, pray let us know to-night, and get ready to em|bark

to-morrow morning; for we flat|ter our&s;elves with the hopes of a ve|ry plea&s;ant &s;alt-water tour, and &s;hould be very happy to have you of the party."</P>
<P>Here our friend pau&s;ed a little, and &s;aid, in a doubtful tone of voice, and with a &s;erious look, "You know, Tom, I am fond of &s;ailing, and like the company that's going; and as I have never been in France, &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee that too.</P>
<P>"But no words can command the winds, nor can any prayers give pity to the waves, therefore not choo&s;ing to lay my&s;elf under an obligation to beg a favour on my knees, either of Aeolus or Neptune, mu&s;t beg leave to decline this briny excur&s;ion, by keep|ing my&s;elf as &s;afe as the &s;ound &s;oil of <HI>terra firma</HI> will admit."</P>
<P>We were very well &s;atisfied with our friend's an&s;wer, and gave him up to his own opinion, which every man has a right to enjoy, and by way of

<HEAD>SATURDAY, the 22d of July, 1775.</HEAD>
<P>THIS morning embarked on board a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el about &s;even tons burthen, called the Hawke, ly|ing at Black-friars bridge.</P>
<P>At ten A. M. got under way.</P>
<P>It being calm, we had nothing but the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the tide, which at noon conveyed us a-brea&s;t of Cuc|kold's Point, the horns bearing S. Being all &s;ingle men, not one of us was &s;hocked at this forked <HI>in&s;ignia</HI> of connubial incontinence.</P>
<P>At two P. M. a light breeze &s;prang up at NNW.</P>
<P>At three came a brea&s;t of Wool|wich town; &s;ent the boy on &s;hore with a jolly boat for &s;ea nece&s;&s;aries.
<PB N="5" REF="9">
Here the Judith, a &s;ailing boat of the Cumberland fleet joined company, la&s;hed along &s;ide, and all hands of each ve&s;&s;el dined together, and were as happy as roa&s;t beef, wine, punch and ale were capable of making us.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t four, &s;et the cro&s;s jack; light airs.</P>
<P>At noon, a-brea&s;t of Erith town, the church bearing NW by N. Here a plea&s;ant breeze &s;prang up, and as the way of our little ve&s;&s;els was refre&s;h|ed by the wind, &s;o were our &s;pirits exhilarated with the wine, which cre|ated &s;ome light and merry conver&s;a|tion, &s;uch as joke, pun, repartee, and &s;ong. One of the company gave a &s;ong, which was applicable to the time, place, and &s;ea&s;on; and as it is new, it may not be di&s;agreea|ble to the reader; the words being written to the tune of a &s;ea &s;ong, in a piece called The Trip to Port&s;|mouth.</P>

After the &s;ong, this light &s;ong&s;ter gave us what he calls a &s;entiment; bur I fancy the generality of our readers will think it too light for a &s;entiment; and as it bore &s;o great &s;imilarity to the &s;ong, the company were plea&s;ed, and gave applau&s;e to the thought. The toa&s;t was, "May we ca&s;t off the &s;urtout of &s;tupidity, put on levity's livery, and pa&s;s through life in the garments of gaiety." We had a lively and merry conver&s;ation till ten o'clock, when we came a-brea&s;t of Grave&s;end town, the church bea|ring SW.</P>

<P>At four A. M. in Sea reach. The Judith &s;ent her jolly boat with parting compliments, &s;he returning to London.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t four came to anchor off the Blyth, being obliged to lay till the tide &s;erved to carry us down. Here we amu&s;ed our&s;elves with &s;leeping for a few hours, it being a &s;weet and ne|ce&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment either by &s;ea or land; and it happening to be a fine calm morning, we were not inter|rupted from ta&s;ting this &s;oft ble&s;&s;ing of Nature's bounty.</P>
<P>At ten, being high water, all hands turned out, weighed, and got under way, the Grain Point bearing ESE. A &s;cene of canine di&s;tre&s;s now offered to view; a large &s;hip dog &s;wimming in the &s;ea, de&s;erted, as we &s;uppo&s;e, by the &s;hip he belonged to; being touch|ed with tenderne&s;s for the poor ani|mal's di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ent the boy with the jolly boat, and took him in.</P>

At noon a-brea&s;t of Yantlett creek, the i&s;land of Sheepy bearing SSE. a light breeze at SE.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t twelve the breeze fre&s;h|ened, &s;truck top ma&s;t; at two we pa&s;t by his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip Mars, which was lying off the Nore, to take in impre&s;&s;ed men for his Maje&s;ty's &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>At three, a fre&s;h breeze from the SW. at twenty minutes pa&s;t &s;ix, made the Reculvers in one. At half pa&s;t nine, came into Margate harbour; all hands went on &s;hore, and &s;taid all night. At this place we left one of our company behind, he not chu&s;ing to go on the French coa&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>MONDAY 24.</HEAD>
<P>At ten this morning, all hands went on board, and got out of the harbour with a pilot for the French coa&s;t, wind SE.</P>

<P>At three, the wind encrea&s;ing, &s;et &s;econd jibb, and took in fir&s;t reef of the main&s;ail.</P>
<P>At four, went through the Downs; found riding there, a Dutch Ea&s;t In|diaman, Lord Byron's and Lord Fer|rers's &s;ailing yachts, and the Wells and Greyhound cutters, wind WSW. a fre&s;h breeze, the South Foreland light hou&s;e bearing SSW. At half pa&s;t five, the wind decrea&s;ing, let the reef out of the main&s;ail.</P>
<P>At &s;even, came into Dover har|bour; all hands went on &s;hore, and &s;taid at the King's head tavern all night. After &s;upper the evenings being long and plea&s;ant, we agreed to take a walk round the town. Pa&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="11" REF="15">
by a little ale-hou&s;e ju&s;t by the &s;ea beach, we heard an extraordinary noi&s;e, which induced us, by way of curio&s;ity, to enter the hou&s;e; where we found four or five &s;mugglers, dan|cing, &s;inging, bla&s;ting and &s;wearing.</P>
<P>As new &s;cenes of life give fre&s;h food for the mind, we quietly &s;at down in the &s;ame room; and were &s;oon a&s;ked by one of the mo&s;t wicked and aban|doned of the company, if we wanted a boat to go over to Calais? Being in high &s;pirits, and willing to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with the&s;e amphibious brutes, one of us replied, "Though it was a very plea&s;ing night, and we liked &s;ailing extremely well, yet we had no great inclination to &s;tand the chance of getting a belly full of &s;alt water, it being e&s;teemed a much bet|ter medicine in the morning." We were an&s;wered with "D&mdash;n my eyes, ma&s;ter, you a'n't the fir&s;t better looking gentleman than you are, that would give their eyes to get over at
<PB N="12" REF="16">
this time of night! By this we ima|gined they took us either for &s;orger|ers, murderers, or highwaymen. We freely gave them &s;ome liquor, and as freely entered into conver&s;ation with them; they as freely divulged the &s;ecrets of their charnel hou&s;e. One of them told us a &s;tory of his villany.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, "La&s;t winter, about ele|ven o'clock, a dark, &s;tormy night, that blowed great guns enough to blow the devil's head off, that one of the&s;e here gentlemen came down from London for forgery, and wanted a boat to go over to Calais directly. We were down upon the frig, and b&mdash;&s;t me, now was the time to do the thing well. We were &s;ure he had plenty of crop; and you may be &s;ure, ma&s;ter, we wou'd'nt go over for no|thing, &s;o I ax'd the gentleman what he would give us? He &s;aid ten gui|neas to go off immediately. Upon this, `B&mdash;&s;t me, &s;ays my companion, you may do as youu plea&s;e. Tom, but
<PB N="13" REF="17">
d&mdash;n my eyes if I go for le&s;s than twenty and a tub.' This was what Will called bearing up: at la&s;t the gentleman agreed; for he &s;aid every minute was almo&s;t as dear to him as his life.</P>
<P>"By G-d ma&s;ter, and &s;o I be|lieved it was, for he &s;eemed to be in great fear, and a d&mdash;d hurry; but at la&s;t, out comes the quids, out of a d&mdash;d long pur&s;e, &s;eparated from the convoy of about a hundred more. I winked my eye at Will, and &s;aid to my&s;elf, B&mdash;&s;t me, but half that mu&s;t be ours; how&s;endever, the bargain being &s;truck, and the money paid down, we got aboard of the boat, and put off, the night as dark as pitch, and blowed a parfect &s;torm.</P>
<P>"When we had got half &s;eas over, Now ma&s;ter, &s;ays I to him, half acres bears good corn, as the old &s;aying is, and you mu&s;t &s;hare that there long pur&s;e with us. Why, &s;ays the gen|tleman, did not I agree with you for
<PB N="14" REF="18">
twenty guineas? You have received the money, and what can you de&s;ire more? `D&mdash;n my eyes, &s;ays Will, as we are the means of your e&s;caping, b&mdash;&s;t me but I think we have as much right to the money as you have, &s;o make no more di&s;putes; if you do, by G-d we take it all, and you go over-board; why it is d&mdash;d bad weather, and who do you think's to &s;tand all this, without being well paid, not I b&mdash;&s;t me;' &s;o with this he quietly gave up half the blunt, which was about fifty-four guineas." He concluded his &s;tory, by &s;aying they &s;at him on &s;hore at Calais in the morning, as wet as a drownded rat. By this we were convinced of the hone&s;ty of the&s;e gentlemen of the &s;urf, and took our leaves in a bumper of Holland's gin, which they obliged us to drink.</P>
<P>From this place we returned to our inn, drank a bottle of wine, and re|flected on the wickedne&s;s and frailties
<PB N="15" REF="19">
of mankind, agreeing to &s;et off for Calais the next morning, to &s;ee &s;ome of the <HI>manoeuvres des Fran&ccedil;ois.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>TUESDAY 25.</HEAD>
<P>At eight A. M. all hands repaired on board, got under way, and came out of Dover harbour, in company with four packet and bye boats; on board one was his royal highne&s;s William duke of Gloce&s;ter, his du|che&s;s, child, and attendants, going to Italy; wind WSW. a light breeze; hoi&s;ted the jolly boat in.</P>
<P>At nine, bent large jibb, calm about an hour, then a plea&s;ant breeze &s;prang up at WSW.</P>
<P>At ten came a-brea&s;t of his royal highne&s;s's boat; at twelve, Calais church bore SE. by S. and Blackne&s;s SW. wind as before.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t twelve, clo&s;e a-brea&s;t of Calais pier-head; the wind changed to WNW. a plea&s;ant breeze, &s;et the cro&s;s jack; at half pa&s;t two, a-brea&s;t

of Gravelines, the church bearing SSE. got up top ma&s;t; lights airs.</P>
<P>At &s;even made Dunkirk harbour; got aground going in; backed her off, and &s;tood out to the northward, till the tide flowed more water.</P>
<P>At about eight &s;hot the pier, and &s;tood up the harbour; all hands went on &s;hore; took quarters at the Flying-hor&s;e in <HI>Rue de Jean,</HI> &s;upped, and drank Champaigne till one, by way of welcome to the country.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>WEDNESDAY 26.</HEAD>
<P>This morning after Breakfa&s;t we amu&s;ed our&s;elves with reconnoitering the town till dinner time; found an excellent quay, and &s;pacious market|place, and as it was the fir&s;t dinner we had eaten in this country, can't help taking notice of the goodne&s;s of the fi&s;h and fowl.</P>
<P>The meat, I think, is not quite &s;o rich in flavour as in England; but we
<PB N="17" REF="21">
made up all deficiencies in the eating way, by taking copious libations of Burgundy till &s;ix o'clock.</P>
<P>As generous wine, in an Engli&s;h con&s;titution, generally creates a de&s;ire for women, we found out, by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a captain, who had been here &s;ome time, a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure; two <HI>filles de joye</HI> were introduced, with French wine, and one of the&s;e French fair ones &s;poke Engli&s;h tolera|bly well. This lady was a girl of mirth, and &s;eemed well calculated to give joy over the bottle, and plea&s;ure in private.</P>
<P>In the&s;e places, or indeed in any other, where wine exhilarates the &s;pirits, and women give life to the conver&s;ation, the &s;oul &s;ometimes will expre&s;s its joy by tones of &s;weet mu|&s;ic, &s;et to words commonly called a Song; this we felt the agreeable ef|fects of, by the French girl's &s;inging one, which &s;he executed plea&s;ingly and prettily; after this, &s;he politely
<PB N="18" REF="22">
a&s;ked which of the gentlemen would &s;ing: upon this a very lu&s;ty, heal|thy looking gentleman, of about thir|ty, who by the appearance of his body be&s;poke a good roa&s;t beef con&s;titution, and by his face, plenty, peace of mind, and chearfulne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, hol|lowed out to a little fat faced fellow, with a &s;canty head of hair, and a &s;mile upon his cheek, "Come give us the &s;ong you chaunted the other night at the Devil tavern;" then turning round to a &s;lim gentleman in black, with a queue wig and a ca&s;t in his eye, "What do you &s;ay, Sir, mu&s;t not Tom &s;ing? Although he has not the be&s;t voice in the world, yet I think he will not di&s;plea&s;e the company."</P>
<P>The gentleman in mourning, with his u&s;ual politene&s;s, got up, and told him, he was almo&s;t &s;ure the &s;ong would plea&s;e the company, and par|ticularly oblige him; then &s;ilence was &s;avagely bawled out by the captain,

<P>Now we were all in high glee, and &s;eemed likely to be as happy as French wine and French women were capa|ble of making us; but, Oh, &s;ad di&s;|appointment! a quarrel en&s;uing be|tween the captain and the landlord, put us all in confu&s;ion.</P>

<P>As a contra&s;t to the above hou&s;e of amorous amu&s;ement, we entered a hou&s;e of religion, which appears to be the principal church, and &s;tands next to the market-place; we were not a&s;hamed of this tran&s;ition, as we find it is the fa&s;hion of the country, fir&s;t to &s;in and then to pray.</P>
<P>We viewed the plate and pictures, in both which their churches abound; &s;ome of their pictures were middling, others very bad; the be&s;t we &s;aw in this church was a large one of the re|&s;urrection; who was the ma&s;ter we could not learn: then returned to our hotel.</P>

<P>The wine we got at this place was very good and cheap.

<P>Here were two holy fathers in com|pany; one of them an Engli&s;hman, of the order of Ricolets, and the other a &s;uperior of the Carmelites, with three more Frenchmen, very agree|able company.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t twelve we got into the pa&s;&s;age boat, and found on board the Marquis of Beaufort, his lady, two &s;ons, who were officers, two daugh|ters, and an Engli&s;h elderly &s;agacious looking gentlemen, playing back gam|mon with the marquis, the ladies &s;ing|ing and playing on the guittar, and the younge&s;t &s;on knitting a hood; this we thought rather <HI>petit</HI> for an officer, or indeed any thing el&s;e in

<P>At five o'clock we came to a re|markable &s;tone bridge, with four &s;ides, and an arch on each &s;ide, which was erected on the centre of a cro&s;s on two rivers, which take you to &s;our dif|ferent places, <HI>viz.</HI> to Calais, St. Omer's, Dunkirk, and Arc.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock came to Calais, went as by recommendation to an hotel, called the Court of London; took re|fre&s;hment, and afterwards walked down to the pier-head, and looked in the offing for our little barque, which we expected round by this time from Dunkirk, but &s;he was not arrived; left the pier-head, and viewed the town and works; took a peep into one of their churches, but found it like their land, not quite &s;o clean and cle|ver as in the other countries.</P>
<P>At nine o'clock returned to our hotel. Here we found &s;ome gentle|men ju&s;t arrived from London in one
<PB N="45" REF="49">
of the packet boats, and were going to Paris, who joined company, and &s;upped with us; the cloth being drawn, and the table furni&s;hed with full bottles and empty gla&s;&s;es, each man filled the latter with wine, and gave the toa&s;t, which in England is always drank in a bumper, and here wants no explanation. Now as wine circling makes conver&s;ation flow, we, though now birds of pa&s;&s;age, would wi&s;h to be intelligent beings, for in this country, or at lea&s;t where we have been, you may as well look for a vir|tuous prie&s;t, or a cha&s;te abbe&s;s, as a news-paper; &s;o we con&s;equently a&s;ked our countrymen, the news cir|culating in the metropolis of England. They told us, that American matters were the chief camp of conver&s;ation, and that &s;ome people looked upon the Yankies to be a ridiculous rout of re|bellious ra&s;cals, while others thought them an innocent and injured &s;et of provoked provincials. Here each
<PB N="46" REF="50">
man gave his different opinion, as is always the way in the&s;e matters, till at la&s;t two of the gentlemen came to high words, and put the whole com|pany in confu&s;ion; but a reconciliatory toa&s;t being propo&s;ed, and the di&s;pu|tants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;ome degree of pacific under&s;tanding, very &s;en&s;ibly dropt the &s;ubject, and heard the toa&s;t, which was, "May a mannerly me|thod of modulating matters attend all difficult ca&s;es."</P>
<P>After the toa&s;t, which each man drank in a bumper, the conver&s;ation turned very agreeably on many &s;ubjects, but was often interrupted by one of the company, who would throw in his &s;craps of French every now and then; but what made us laugh at this fellow, was his mode of &s;peaking it, not according to the pronunciation of the French, but as you would li|terally read it. I can't de&s;cribe it better on paper, becau&s;e to write the mode would lo&s;e the effect: but

happy for the company, he got drunk and fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>One of the company enquired if Mr. Foote's new piece, called A Trip to Calais, was out yet; he was an|&s;wered, "No; it was &s;topped by the interce&s;&s;ion of the Dutche&s;s of King|&s;ton, who thought her&s;elf &s;candalized and ill u&s;ed, therefore applied to the Lord Chamberlain, and had influence enough with that nobleman to prevent a licence for the piece, which," &s;ays he, "I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t be a mental pu|ni&s;hment, attended with a pecuniary di&s;appointment: a mental puni&s;h|ment, that a woman &s;hould cramp his genius; and a pecuniary di&s;appoint|ment, which may circum&s;cribe his plea&s;ures."</P>
<P>We had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e about this great author's writings; the &s;tile, beauties, and peculiarities; &s;eeming all to agree, if we may be allowed judges, that his Devil upon Sticks was the be&s;t devil that ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, and that
<PB N="48" REF="52">
it was a wondrous work of wit, at|tended by the fire of &s;en&s;e and &s;atire.</P>
<P>Here one of the gentlemen made an ob&s;ervation, and pointed out a pe|culiarity in Mr. Foot's writings, which in general, I believe, is e&s;teemed a beauty, and called aliteration; the longe&s;t he makes u&s;e of, is in the Mayor of Garrat, where Mrs. Sneak calls Jerry, a poor, paltry, prying, pi|tiful, pin-maker. One of the company &s;aid it put him in mind of two lines of Mr. Pitt's, an eminent author, and taken notice of in Colley Cibber's lives of the poets; it was written on Cardi|nal Wol&s;ey, and runs thus:
<Q><L>"Begot by butchers but by bi&s;hops bred;</L>
<L>"How high his honour holds his haughty head."</L></Q>
Here a gentleman ob&s;erved it was a long one, but that would appear but very &s;hort, compared to one of a great|length. He was a&s;ked if he knew a longer; "O yes, Sir, one twelve times as long; for a friend of mine wrote one
<PB N="49" REF="53">
la&s;t winter; and becau&s;e he would be thought a man of letters, he has gone through the alphabet with it, and calls it</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>AN ALPHABETICAL ALITERATION."</HEAD>
<P>The company &s;aid they &s;hould be very glad to hear it recited. He &s;aid, if his memory did not deceive his good wi&s;hes to oblige, he would give it directly; and told us it was a &s;ong written to the old Engli&s;h tune of <HI>Down, down, down, derry down;</HI> and hoped the novelty of the matter might engage the attention of the company, and &s;hade the attempt of an indiffer|ent &s;inger; he then began.</P>

<HEAD>TUESDAY the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>This morning after breakfa&s;t went down to the pier-head, to look for our little ve&s;&s;el, &s;aw her working down to harbour; went to the hotel, paid the bill, and prepared to &s;ail this day for England. After dinner we &s;ent a tub of brandy and other nece&s;&s;aries on board, for &s;ea &s;tore.</P>
<P>At about half after two all hands went on board. A per&s;on came down and demanded port charges; paid him half a guinea, which we thought ra|ther too much for our &s;mall frigate; got under way to go out of harbour, but the wind &s;hifting right a head, and blowing fre&s;h, did not chu&s;e to &s;tand the chance of being at &s;ea all night, therefore came up the harbour again.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t three debarked, and went to &s;ee a nunnery. In a room
<PB N="53" REF="57">
here, was a fine picture of a female penitent, but &s;omething damaged by accident. We bought &s;ome trinkets of the lady abbe&s;s, who by the way &s;eems to have about her more art than religion, and then took leave of the convent.</P>
<P>At about five, took a walk out of town, met numbers of people return|ing from a fair, held about two leagues up the country; returned to our hotel at nine, had an agreeable &s;upper, and retired to re&s;t about midnight, fully re&s;olved to take leave of Calais the next morning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>WEDNESDAY 2.</HEAD>
<P>We were called this morning at half pa&s;t three, to embark for En|gland.</P>
<P>At four all hands on board, got under way, and &s;ailed out of Calais habour with a gentle breeze at SW.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="58">
At eight weathered the &s;outh head of the Goodwin &s;ands; a rowling &s;ea, got down main&s;ail, and &s;et the cro&s;s jack. At ten a-brea&s;t of Deal town.</P>
<P>At noon came a-brea&s;t of the North Foreland light hou&s;e; the wind &s;hift|ing, hawled down cro&s;s jack, and &s;et double reef main&s;ail.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t one came into Mar|gate harbour. All hands went on &s;hore to an inn, and dined; amu&s;ed our&s;elves with walking till &s;even, and then went to the play-hou&s;e to &s;ee the Bu&s;y Body and the Lying Valet. Returned to our inn, and retired to bed about one in the morning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>THURSDAY 3.</HEAD>
<P>This morning all hands turned out about nine, breakfa&s;ted, and after|wards amu&s;ed our&s;elves till dinner time on the &s;ea beach getting &s;hell fi&s;h. After dinner took a walk to King&s;gate
<PB N="55" REF="59">
with &s;ome company we joined at the inn.</P>
<P>At this place is a country &s;eat, with a fine view of the &s;ea, &s;urrounded with a picture&s;que pro&s;pect of artifi|cial ruins, lately belonging to the right hon. Henry lord Holland. We went to the &s;ign of the Capt. Digby, amu&s;ed our&s;elves, playing at trap-ball, and drinking arrack punch, it being &s;o exceeding good that we could not part with it till eight o'clock; then went home by the &s;ea &s;ide on the &s;andy beach, under tremendous cliffs of chalk, and came to our inn at nine; &s;upped and went to bed about twelve, intending to &s;et off when the tide &s;erved next morning for London.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>FRIDAY 4.</HEAD>
<P>This morning turned out about &s;e|ven, and took a walk till breakfa&s;t time down to the bathing places, and
<PB N="56" REF="60">
by the number of &s;ick and lame peo|ple we met crawling and limping about the town, a per&s;on would &s;uppo&s;e this place was the Kenti&s;h maritime ho&s;|pital, for &s;ick and lame trade&s;men of the city and &s;uburbs of London.</P>
<P>At ten all hands went on board, and &s;ailed out of harbour under a dou|ble&punc;reef main&s;ail and third jibb, with a fee&s;h breeze at SW by W.</P>
<P>At eleven went through the Nar|rows.</P>
<P>At half after one pa&s;&s;ed by the Nore; the wind veering more we&s;|terly.</P>
<P>At &s;even came to an anchor in Grave&s;end road, off the Falcon back door, and went on &s;hore to this inn.</P>
<P>Looking over the rails, in a little paved yard, at the back of the hou&s;e, that commands a pro&s;pect of the &s;hip|ping, and talking about indifferent mat|ters, a grave elderly gentleman in black, with a large white wig, and &s;eemed by the con&s;equence of his external
<PB N="57" REF="61">
index, to po&s;&s;e&s;s an internal volume of learning and &s;en&s;ibility, leaning over the rails, at the &s;ame time joined conver&s;ation with us, and gave us a real proof of what we pre&s;umptively thought.</P>
<P>While we were talking, a young gentleman came into the yard, play|ing with a little black and white &s;pa|niel dog; the lad was about fourteen years of age, a very hand&s;ome youth indeed, which made us take notice of him. "Yes, Sir," &s;aid the old gentleman, "that child belongs to me, and although I am not imme|diately his parent, yet having the care and in&s;truction of him in his infancy, I can't help con&s;idering him as my own. He is heir to two thou&s;and a year in Che&s;hire, and his uncle, who is &s;till living, is de|termined to make him as profound and good a &s;cholar as any in Europe; and intends &s;ending him to Italy, un|der
<PB N="58" REF="62">
my tuition, to &s;tudy the dead lan|guages."</P>
<P>"How, Sir," &s;ays one of the com|pany, with a tone of admiration, "what, &s;end him to Italy!" "Yes, Sir," replied the other, "there is clear air, good &s;oil, rich fruit, and fine wine." "It is very true, Sir; but if I might pre&s;ume to give my advice, I would have him &s;tay where he is." "Stay where he is!" &s;ays the old one in &s;urprize, laying the empha&s;is &s;trong upon &s;tay; "Yes, Sir," an&s;wered the other, "for I think there's not a bet|ter place in Europe than Grave&s;end, for a man to &s;tudy the dead languages."</P>
<P>At this the old gentleman, who had not &s;worn an oath, I &s;uppo&s;e, the&s;e twenty years, muttered out, "D&mdash;n your punning," and turned round to run away, but accidentally came again&s;t a lu&s;ty gentleman's fat belly, which recoiled the old man again&s;t a &s;lim gentleman in black, and was very

near pu&s;hing him down; but at la&s;t he made his e&s;cape, while the &s;illy fellow that made the pun, &s;tood laughing at his own non&s;en&s;e and their confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Here we &s;tayed all night, and were very well treated.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>SATURDAY 5.</HEAD>
<P>This morning after breakfa&s;t took a walk up the windmill-hill, till near twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>At noon, it being low water, pre|pared for &s;ailing to London. All hands got on board, and came to &s;ail with a light breeze at SW.</P>
<P>At four P. M. came a-brea&s;t of the half-way hou&s;e, and at eight &s;afe ar|rived at our moorings a little above Blackfriars-bridge. Here many of our friends came on board, and were very glad to &s;ee us &s;afe returned, they think|ing it a &s;ervice of danger to go to &s;ea in &s;o &s;mall a boat. After drinking a
<PB N="60" REF="64">
bumper of French brandy all together, we went a&s;hore, and were jolly, not at all di&s;plea&s;ed with our &s;hort but plea&s;ant Trip to Calais.</P>
