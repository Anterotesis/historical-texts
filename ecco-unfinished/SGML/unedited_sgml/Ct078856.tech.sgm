<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Treati&s;e
may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure,
claim the Honour of
Your Lord&s;hip's Patronage, as
being undertaken in Obedience
to Your Commands, and con|taining
<PB REF="3">
part of tho&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es,
I had with your Lord&s;hip, when
you allow'd me the Honour, to
talk with you on <HI>Philo&s;ophical
Subjects;</HI> Tho' Your Lord&s;hip's
uncommon Advances, even in
the more ab&s;tru&s;e parts of <HI>Geo|metry,</HI>
and <HI>Natural Knowledge,</HI>
have made you &s;o great a <HI>Ma|&s;ter</HI>
of Rea&s;onings of this kind,
that I am not capable of offer|ing
any thing to You worthy
Your own Peru&s;al; yet did but
the Performance, an&s;wer the
Dignity of the Subject, I &s;hou'd
not think it, unworthy of Your
Lord&s;hip's Protection.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
Such has been Your Lord&s;hip's
happy <HI>Genius,</HI> and <HI>Conduct</HI> in
Your Studies, that Your great
Progre&s;s in the nobler parts of
<HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> has not retarded
Your deep Inquiries, in the Know|ledge
of <HI>civil Government;</HI> nor
Your <HI>univer&s;al Learning</HI> ren|dred
you more unfit for an active
Life, and doing good to Man|kind.
It was the peculiar Wi&s;|dom
of the <HI>Antients,</HI> to lay &s;uch
Foundations both for <HI>Know|ledge,</HI>
and for <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> that
they left it to their Stars to de|termine,
which of the two &s;hou'd
afford them Occa&s;ion, to become
mo&s;t u&s;eful to Mankind. What
<PB REF="5">
Provi&s;ion Your Lord&s;hip has laid
in for the fir&s;t, if others know not
as I do, it is becau&s;e they have
not had Occa&s;ion to Di&s;cour&s;e
with You on Subjects of Learn|ing.
And the Queen's Choice, is
an undoubted Proof of Your Ca|pacity
for the other. Her Ma|je&s;ty
having put You, in the mo&s;t
difficult Po&s;t of the Government of
Your Country, I wou'd &s;ay too,
in the mo&s;t difficult Times, if any
thing could be reckon'd &s;o, for
the pre&s;ent Reign.</P>
<P>It was Your Lord&s;hip's Opi|nion,
that the <HI>Providence of
the Almighty Governour of
the Univer&s;e,</HI> had re&s;erv'd to
<PB REF="6">
this la&s;t Age, tho&s;e great
Advantages, by which the Se|crets
of Nature have been more
happily unravell'd, than in
any former Times, on pur|po&s;e,
to expo&s;e the Folly of a cor|rupt
Generation of Men, who
from their vitious Practices,
being prone to <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> have
vainly pretended, the <HI>Oracles of
Rea&s;on</HI> to be on their &s;ide. And
upon the &s;ame account, I cannot
but look upon Your Lord&s;hip as
a &s;ingular <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> as well as
an <HI>Ornament</HI> to Your Country,
who are a <HI>Living Exemple,</HI> that
true <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Probity</HI>
go Hand in Hand, and that
<HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> receive
<PB REF="7">
additional <HI>Lu&s;tre</HI> from one ano|ther.
But, becau&s;e I would not
offend Your Lord&s;hip's darling
Vertue, Your <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> I &s;hall
choo&s;e to tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t
the common Rules of Dedica|tions,
and &s;hall not pre&s;ume, to
mention, either Your <HI>Birth,</HI> or
<HI>Fortune,</HI> or <HI>Breeding,</HI> or <HI>Tem|per,</HI>
or which is more valuable,
that <HI>Probity</HI> and <HI>Candor</HI> that
&s;hines in all You &s;ay or do, but
&s;hall only make good Wi&s;hes, &s;up|ply
the Place of a ju&s;t <HI>Enco|mium.</HI></P>
<P>May Your Lord&s;hip be as
happy in your Admini&s;tration,
as the Motives upon which you
<PB REF="8">
accepted it, were Ju&s;t and Ho|nourable.
May you be as ea&s;ie
in your Office, as you are to all
the World in your <HI>Temper.</HI>
And as your noble Mind, has
&s;ecur'd you from mean and nar|row
Prejudices; May your In|tegrity
protect you from unju&s;t
Malice; May your Endeavours
for &s;ettling the Peace and Hap|pine&s;s
of your Country, be as
&s;ucce&s;sful, as your Love to it is
&s;incere.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my Lord, are the only
Returns, I can make your Lord|&s;hip,
for the many Favours I
have receiv'd from you, and
this &s;mall <HI>Treati&s;e</HI> is the only
<PB REF="9">
Pre&s;ent I have to offer you; of
which however, I beg your Lord|&s;hip's
Acceptance, and that your
Lord&s;hip wou'd believe, that no
one can Honour you more, than</P>

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE End and De&s;ign of the&s;e
Di&s;cour&s;es, may be gathered
from the <HI>Title Page,</HI> and the
<HI>Contents;</HI> and I have alrea|dy
hinted, what gave the Occa&s;ion and
Ri&s;e to them, <HI>viz.</HI> the Commands and
Conver&s;ation of that <HI>noble Per&s;on,</HI> to
whom they are in&s;cribed. As for the Ma|terials,
&s;ome of them I borrowed from
the Works of tho&s;e Learned Men, I have
had Occa&s;ion to be conver&s;ant in; others
I had, by a little reflexion on my Subject.
If any one think, I have made free with
their Inventions, without doing Ju&s;tice to
their <HI>Names,</HI> I give every Man Liberty to
lay in his own Claim, and a&s;&s;ert his ju&s;t
Right, for I indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided all
Quotations, becau&s;e my Subject wanted
<PB REF="11">
not <HI>Authorities,</HI> but <HI>Demon&s;tration.</HI> Some
part of the Matter was furni&s;hed me
from Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>'s Store, and his Inven|tions
have &s;uch peculiar Marks, as will
di&s;tingui&s;h them, even in my rude Dre&s;s,
without particular <HI>Innuendo's.</HI> For what
concern'd the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> be&s;ides,
<HI>Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini,</HI> that <HI>Friend</HI> to Mankind,
my con&s;tant good Friend, Dr. <HI>Archibald
Pitcairn</HI> his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertations</HI> &s;upply'd me the
mo&s;t plentifully. I borrowed but little,
from tho&s;e who have written on the &s;ame
Subjects with my &s;elf, both to avoid Re|petitions,
and becau&s;e they generally went
on Principles (tho' ju&s;t and demon&s;trative)
yet of a different Nature from mine.</P>
<P>If I have had the Misfortune, to differ
in &s;ome few <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> points, from
&s;ome great and de&s;erving Men, I hope
they will have the Goodne&s;s to pardon
me, having treated their Opinions, with
all the <HI>Candor</HI> and <HI>Regard</HI> due to their
<HI>Merits,</HI> without mentioning their <HI>Names;</HI>
and a <HI>mannerly</HI> Liberty in <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI>
points, is allow'd to ev'ry Body.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">
That the&s;e Sheets have not many more
Faults than they have, is owing to the Judi|cious
Corrections and Advices, of the <HI>Reve|rend</HI>
and <HI>Excellent Mr. John Craig,</HI> and the
Learned, <HI>Dr. Arbuthnott Phy&s;ician to his Roy|al
Highne&s;s,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Friend</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;ti Church
Oxford.</HI> Men &s;ufficiently eminent in the
Common-Wealth of Learning, not to
want any Paneygrick from me.</P>
<P>If I am not over fond of my Subject, I
think I may &s;ay, a Treati&s;e on it was wan|ted,
I wi&s;h there may not be Occa&s;ion of
&s;aying &s;o &s;till. If my Performance excite
others, of more Lei&s;ure and Capacity to
do it the Ju&s;tice it de&s;erves, I have ob|tain'd
the end of my Ambition.</P>

common Subject of Di&s;|cour&s;e
than <HI>Nature</HI> and its
<HI>Laws;</HI> and yet, however U&s;e has made
the&s;e Words familiar, there are few that

mo&s;t Men, that there are &s;carce any that

enter their Compo&s;ition; I &s;hall not pre|tend

enough to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to give
the Sen&s;e I &s;hall apply to them in the fol|lowing
Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; II. By <HI>Nature,</HI> I under&s;tand this va&s;t,
if not infinite <HI>Machin</HI> of the <HI>&V;niver&s;e,</HI> the
Perfect and Wi&s;e Production of Almighty
God, con&s;i&s;ting of an infinite Number of
le&s;&s;er <HI>Machins,</HI> every one of which is ad|ju&s;ted
by Weight and Mea&s;ure. By the
<HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> I mean, tho&s;e Laws of
Motion by which natural Bodies are go|vern'd
in all their Actions upon one ano|ther,
and which they inviolably ob&s;erve
in all the Changes that happen in the na|tural
State of things. But here we are to
di&s;tingui&s;h between the Laws of <HI>Creation</HI>
and tho&s;e of <HI>Nature,</HI> for not only the great
Bodies of this Univer&s;e, but the inferiour
<HI>Machins</HI> thereof, were created by a different
Law from what they, are now govern'd,
<PB N="3" REF="36">
as &s;hall afterwards be more fully ex|plain'd.</P>
<P>&sect; III. That there is no &s;uch thing as
an <HI>Univer&s;al Soul</HI> animating this va&s;t Sy|&s;tem
according to <HI>Plato,</HI> nor any <HI>Sub&s;tan|tial
Forms</HI> according to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> nor any
Omni&s;cient <HI>Radical Heat</HI> according to <HI>Hip|pocrates,</HI>
nor any <HI>Pla&s;tick Virtue</HI> according
to <HI>Scaliger,</HI> nor any <HI>Hylarchic Principle</HI> ac|cording
to <HI>Henry More,</HI> is evident from
the following Con&s;iderations; 1. The&s;e
are meer <HI>Allegorical</HI> Terms coin'd on pur|po&s;e
to conceal their Author's Ignorance.
When the <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> cou'd not account
for the appearances of Nature, they were
&s;o far from owning any want of Know|ledge,
that to keep up their Credit with
the thoughtle&s;s and credulous part of Man|kind,
they attributed the&s;e unaccountable
Effects to unintelligible Beings of their
own Contrivance, which neither had Foun|dation
nor Exi&s;tence in Nature: But who|ever
will give them&s;elves the lea&s;t trouble
to con&s;ider the Matter, will plainly &s;ee, that
they really meant nothing by tho&s;e ama|zing
<PB N="4" REF="37">
Terms, but to di&s;gui&s;e their own Ig|norance
2. The&s;e Beings are derogatory
from the Wi&s;dom and Power of the <HI>Au|thor</HI>
of <HI>Nature,</HI> who doubtle&s;s can govern
this <HI>Machin</HI> he cou'd create, by more di|rect
and ea&s;ie Methods, than employing
the&s;e &s;ub&s;ervient <HI>Divinities,</HI> 3. The Ap|pearances
them&s;elves, to &s;alve which they
were contriv'd, may be by more intelli|gible
and le&s;s indirect Principles accounted
for, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;hall be afterwards
&s;hown. 4. La&s;tly, The&s;e very <HI>Beings</HI> will
not &s;erve the de&s;ign of their Creation, un|le&s;s
we endow 'em with Powers and Fa|culties
above the Dignity of &s;uch &s;econdary
Agents.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> which
&s;eems mo&s;t agreeable to the Wi&s;dom of
its Author, is (&s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Sy&s;tem of
the Univer&s;e</HI> already created) that he has
&s;ettled Laws, and laid down Rules, con|formable
to which, Natural Bodies are go|vern'd
in their Actions upon one another,
and according to which, the Changes in
the material part of this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> are brought
<PB N="5" REF="38">
about which all Bodies inviolably ob&s;erve,
and which of them&s;elves naturally acting,
they never tran&s;gre&s;s in the lea&s;t degree,
whil&s;t <HI>God Almighty</HI> pre&s;erves them in their
Faculties and Operations. This Great <HI>Ma|chin</HI>
of the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> may in &s;ome degree
be liken'd to a fini&s;h'd Piece of Clock-Work,
form'd upon <HI>Geometrick</HI> Principles,
which naturally, and of it &s;elf (as long
as the Parts are kept together) will go
on in the &s;ame con&s;tant tenour of Motion,
unle&s;s di&s;turb'd by &s;ome external Force;
the Movements of this Clock-Work de|pend
upon tho&s;e General Rules, according
to which, one Part communicates its Mo|tion
to another, and are particularly de|termin'd
by the Configuration of the &s;e|veral
Pieces of which it con&s;i&s;ts, I &s;hall
not here con&s;ider the Actions of Beings,
that have a Power of <HI>Free-Will,</HI> nor even
of tho&s;e that have <HI>Self-Motion,</HI> &s;uch as are
all Animal Agents; nor do I in the lea&s;t
degree exclude the Government of <HI>God Al|mighty</HI>
in this World. On the contrary,
my principal De&s;ign is to demon&s;trate his
<PB N="6" REF="39">
continued Providence from evident Princi|ples,
and to convince the World, that he
not only has the Springs of this <HI>Great Ma|chin,</HI>
and of its &s;everal Parts in his own
Hand, and is the fir&s;t <HI>Mover;</HI> but that
without his continual Influence and Sup|port,
the whole Movement would &s;oon
fall to Pieces. Be&s;ides this, he has re&s;erv'd
to him&s;elf the Power of Di&s;pen&s;ing with
the&s;e Laws, when he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect; V. It is not my De&s;ign here to ex|plain
all the particular <HI>Laws of Motion,</HI> and
of the Actions of Bodies upon one ano|ther,
nor cou'd it be well done in &s;o nar|row
a Compa&s;s as I have propo&s;ed to my
&s;elf, I &s;hall here only &s;et down the Gene|ral
<HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> which virtually include
the&s;e others, and infer &s;uch Conclu&s;ions
from 'em as I find mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for clea|ing
&s;ome parts of the following Di&s;|cour&s;es.</P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<PB N="7" REF="40">
<HEAD>LAW I.</HEAD>
<P>ALL Bodies per&s;evere in the &s;ame
State of re&s;t, or of moving for|ward
in a &s;trait Line, unle&s;s forc'd out of
that State by &s;ome outward impre&s;s'd Vio|lence
<HI>i. e.</HI> all Bodies at re&s;t will naturally,
and of them&s;elves for ever continue in re&s;t,
unle&s;s &s;ome external Cau&s;e put 'em in Mo|tion:
And all Bodies in motion will na|turally
move forwards for ever in the &s;ame
&s;trait Line, unle&s;s they are &s;top'd by &s;ome
oppo&s;ite Force, or turn'd out of their
Cour&s;e by &s;ome differently directed Vio|lence.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. To &s;hew how inviolably this
Law is ob&s;erv'd by natural Agents, we
need only con&s;ider it never has been ob|&s;erv'd
that any Body did of it &s;elf, bring
it &s;elf from Re&s;t to Motion, nor that ever
any Body in Motion, brought it &s;elf to
Re&s;t; Nor that ever any Body in Motion,
of it &s;elf altered its Cour&s;e, but that
where ever &s;uch Changes happened, there
<PB N="8" REF="41">
were always evident Cau&s;es. If Bodies
chang'd their places of them&s;elves, all
Things wou'd run into Confu&s;ion, nor
wou'd there be any certain Laws to regu|late
the <HI>Motions</HI> of the Univer&s;e. We
are certain <HI>Projectils</HI> wou'd for ever move
on, in the &s;ame right Line, did not the
Air, their own Gravity, or the Ruggedne&s;s
of the Plane, on which they move, &s;top
their Motion; or did not &s;ome Body
with a different Direction alter their Cour&s;e.
A Top who&s;e parts, by their Cohe&s;ion,
hinder one anothers rectilinear Motions,
wou'd never cea&s;e to turn round did not
the Air, gradually impair its Motion.
Natural Bodies con&s;i&s;t of a Ma&s;s of Mat|ter,
which by it &s;elf can never alter its
State, and if Bodies are once at re&s;t, they
mu&s;t continue &s;o, unle&s;s &s;ome new Force
put 'em in Motion. If in Motion, the
&s;ame Energy will continue 'em in Motion
and drive 'em forwards in the &s;ame Dire|ctions.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="42">
&sect; VII. Moreover, there is in Matter
an unactive <HI>Principle,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>
very well expre&s;&s;es by the <HI>vis inertiae,</HI>
whereby Bodies re&s;i&s;t to the utmo&s;t of
their Power, any change or alteration of
their State, whatever it be, either of Re&s;t,
Motion, or its Direction; And this Re&s;i&s;tance
is always equal in the &s;ame Body,
and in different Bodies is proportional to
the quantity of Matter they contain.
There is required as much Force to &s;top a
Body in Motion, as is required to put it in
Motion, and <HI>&egrave; contr&agrave;;</HI> And therefore &s;ince
the &s;ame Body equally re&s;i&s;ts the contrary
equal Changes of its State, this Re&s;i|&s;tance
will operate as powerfully to keep
a Body in Motion as to keep it at Re&s;t,
and con&s;equently of it &s;elf, it can never
change its State of Re&s;t, Motion, or Dire|ction;
for to change its Direction, is the
&s;ame thing as to move of it &s;elf another
way. Matter then of it &s;elf is &s;o far in|different
to Motion or Re&s;t, that it is no
more inclin'd to the one than to the other,
and does no le&s;s Re&s;i&s;t a change from Re&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="43">
to Motion, than from Motion to Re&s;t.
This <HI>vis inertiae</HI> is no where more con&s;pi|cuous
than in the &s;udden Motion of a
Ve&s;&s;el full of Liquor upon a Horizontal
Plane, at fir&s;t the Liquor &s;eems to move
with a Direction contrary to that of the
Ve&s;&s;el, not that there is really any &s;uch
Motion impre&s;s'd upon the Liquor, but
that the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> endeavouring to con|tinue
it in its State of Re&s;t, the Ve&s;&s;el
can't immediately communicate its Motion
to the Liquor; But the Liquor per&s;everes
in its State of Re&s;t whil&s;t the Ve&s;&s;el makes
forward and &s;o &s;eems to move a contrary
way. But when once the Liquor has
the Motion of the Ve&s;&s;el communicated to
it, and begins to move with a velocity
equal to that of the Ve&s;&s;el, if the Ve&s;&s;el
be &s;uddenly &s;top'd, the Liquor continues
its Motion and da&s;hes over the &s;ides of the
Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="11" REF="44">
<HEAD>Corollary 1.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; VIII. Hence it is evident that no
Particle of Matter, nor any Combination
of Particles, <HI>i. e.</HI> no Body, can either move
of them&s;elves, or of them&s;elves alter the
Direction of their Motion; Matter is not
endow'd with Self-motion, nor with a
Power to alter the Cour&s;e in which it is
put, it is meerly pa&s;&s;ive and mu&s;t for
ever of it &s;elf continue in that State and
that Cour&s;e that it is &s;ettled in; and indeed,
if it can't move of it &s;elf, it can never
alter its Cour&s;e of it &s;elf when in Motion,
for to alter its Cour&s;e of it &s;elf is only to
move of it &s;elf after a particular manner.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 2.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; IX. Hence it is Evident, that no
Body put in Motion will naturally, and of
it &s;elf move in a <HI>Curve Line.</HI> All Motion
is naturally forward in the &s;ame &s;trait Line
with the Direction of the moving Force;
<PB N="12" REF="45">
but what ever moves in a Curve Line
mu&s;t in every Point alter its Direction,
and therefore naturally of it &s;elf, no body
can move in a <HI>Curve Line.</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 3.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; X. Hence the great Bodies of this
Univer&s;e the <HI>Planets,</HI> their <HI>Satellits</HI> and the
<HI>Comets</HI> do not naturally and of them&s;elves
(tho' at fir&s;t put in Motion) move in their
repective Orbits, which are <HI>Curve-Lines</HI> re|turning
into them&s;elves, but are kept in
by &s;ome attractive Force, which if once
&s;u&s;pended they wou'd for ever run out in
right Lines, and con&s;equently the Motions
of the&s;e Great Bodies in their <HI>Orbits</HI> do ab&s;o|lutely
depend upon this attractive Force,
whence&s;oever it ari&s;es.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 4.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; XI. Hence neither Motion nor Re&s;t
(I mean not one of 'em particularly) is
e&s;&s;ential to Matter. <HI>i. e.</HI> Matter is indiffe|rent
<PB N="13" REF="46">
as to either of the&s;e particularly, and
does as much re&s;i&s;t its being chang'd from
Re&s;t to Motion, as it does the being
chang'd from Motion to Re&s;t. And as
any Force will imprint &s;ome degree of Mo|tion
on a quie&s;cent Body, &s;o the &s;ame de|gree
of Force impre&s;s'd at the &s;ame time,
with a contrary Ditection, will bring it
to Re&s;t again, but it is not nece&s;&s;ary to the
<HI>Being</HI> of Matter; that it be in Re&s;t or Mo|tion,
for Matter will be &s;till Matter in
which ever of the&s;e States it be.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary 5.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; XII. Since then it is not e&s;&s;ential to
Matter to be either in Re&s;t or in Motion,
it is evident that the pre&s;ervation of a
Body in Re&s;t or in Motion (after the fir&s;t
In&s;tant) does ab&s;olutely depend upon
<HI>Almighty God</HI> as its Cau&s;e, no part of Mat|ter
can move it &s;elf, nor when put in Mo|tion,
is this Motion ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to
its being nor does depend upon it &s;elf, and
therefore the pre&s;ervation of this Motion
<PB N="14" REF="47">
mu&s;t depend upon &s;ome other Cau&s;e, but
there is no other Cau&s;e a&s;&s;ignable, but

&s;ince con&s;equently, if two Bodies con|taining

that two Bodies containing equal

<P>Effects are alway proportionable to

<P>&sect; XVIII. From the&s;e Laws, and their

Bodies a&s;cending or de&s;cending in verti|cal
Lines, may be deduced, as al&s;o, the
Rules of the Congre&s;&s;es and Reflections
of two Bodies, as the <HI>Geometers</HI> have
&s;hewn. From the preceding Corollary, the
Method of compounding and re&s;olving
Motions in any given Directions may be
drawn, for Example, the Compo&s;ition of
the direct Force <HI>AD,</HI> of any oblique ones,
&s;uch as <HI>AB</HI> and <HI>BD,</HI> as al&s;o the Re&s;o|lution
of the direct Force, into any ob|lique
ones, &s;uch as <HI>AB</HI> and <HI>BD,</HI> as al&s;o
the <HI>ratio</HI> of an oblique Force to move a
Body, to chat of the &s;ame Force coming
with a perpendicular Direction to move
the &s;ame Body; for Example, let an ob|lique
Force, as <HI>AC</HI> be impre&s;s'd upon the
Body <HI>E</HI> in <HI>C,</HI> at the Point <HI>C</HI> erect a per|pendicular
<HI>CD,</HI> and from <HI>A</HI> let fall a per|pendicular
upon <HI>CD,</HI> and another upon
<HI>CB;</HI> then by the former Corollary, the
Force <HI>AC</HI> may be re&s;oved into the two
<PB N="25" REF="58">
Forces <HI>AD</HI> and <HI>AB,</HI> of which only <HI>AB</HI>
has any Energy to move the Body <HI>E;</HI>
wherefore the oblique Force as <HI>AC</HI> is to
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
the &s;ame Force coming with a perpendicu|lar
Direction, as <HI>AB</HI> to <HI>AC,</HI> or as the
&s;ine of the Angle of Incidence <HI>AB</HI> to the
Radius <HI>AC.</HI> The &s;ame is true of the
Energy of an oblique Stroke upon the Body
<HI>E,</HI> to that of the &s;ame &s;triking perpendi|cularly.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame preceding Corollary, it
follows that if a Body <HI>A</HI> be impell'd or
drawn by three different Forces in three
different Directions <HI>AB, AE, AC,</HI> &s;o that
the Body yields to none of 'em, but con|tinues
<PB N="26" REF="59">
in <HI>aequilibrio,</HI> the&s;e three Powers
are to one Another as three right Lines
drawn parallel to their Directions, and ter|minated
by their mutual Concour&s;es. If
<HI>AD</HI> repre&s;ent the Force by which the Body
<HI>A</HI> is impell'd from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>B,</HI> then will the
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
&s;ame <HI>AD</HI> repre&s;ent the contrary equal
Force, whereby it is impell'd from <HI>A</HI> to
<HI>D.</HI> But by the former Corollary a Force,
as <HI>AD</HI> impelling from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D</HI> is equi|pollent
to two others, acting in the Dire|ctions
<HI>AC, AE,</HI> to which the other
impelling from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D,</HI> is as <HI>AD</HI> to
<HI>AC,</HI> and <HI>AE</HI> or <HI>CD,</HI> re&s;pectively. So
likewi&s;e two Forces acting in the Dire|ctions
<PB N="27" REF="60">
<HI>AC, AE,</HI> and being equipollent
to the Force Acting in the Directions
<HI>AD,</HI> from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D</HI> will be to the
Force acting according to the Direction
<HI>AD,</HI> from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D,</HI> as <HI>AC, AE</HI> to <HI>AD;</HI>
and therefore the Forces acting in the Di|rections
<HI>AC</HI> and <HI>AE,</HI> and equipollent to the
Force acting in the Direction, <HI>AD</HI> are to
this Force acting in the Direction <HI>AD,</HI> as
<HI>AC, AE,</HI> or <HI>CD</HI> to <HI>AD,</HI> that is, if a
Body be urg'd by three different equi|pollent
Powers in the Directions <HI>AB,
AC, AE,</HI> the&s;e three Forces &s;hall be to
one another as <HI>AD, AC, CD</HI> re&s;pective|ly,
<HI>q. e. d.</HI> and this &s;ingle Propo&s;ition is
the Foundation of all the Mechanicks, as
&s;everal <HI>Geometers</HI> have expre&s;ly &s;hown; &s;o
that it is plain, the&s;e three Laws do vir|tually
comprehend all the Rules of Me|chani&s;m,
and con&s;equently, if any appea|rance
contradict the&s;e Laws, or their ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Con&s;equences, it is not to be Me|chanically
accounted for. So then in our
future Inquiries, we have nothing to do
to &s;how any thing is Immechanical, or
<PB N="28" REF="61">
not according to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws

which did for that rea&s;on recede
from it; and being there ama&s;s'd in a

produce a Body like the <HI>Sun;</HI> that the
Sun being thus fram'd, and moving about
its own <HI>Axe</HI> with the Motion of the re&s;t

throw out &s;ome Parts of its Matter

it the&s;e <HI>Globules</HI> which are neare&s;t, with

that are neare&s;t the <HI>Center</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> would
be lea&s;t, for were they greater or equal,
they wou'd by rea&s;on of their Velocity,
have a greater centifrugal Force, and there|fore
recede from the <HI>Center.</HI> Now &s;hou'd
it happen that any of the&s;e <HI>Sun-like</HI> Bodies

if it were of le&s;s Solidity, or le&s;s capable
of Motion than the <HI>Globules,</HI> towards the
extremity of the <HI>Solar Vortex,</HI> then it wou'd
de&s;cend toward the <HI>Sun,</HI> till it met with
<HI>Globules</HI> of the &s;ame Solidity, and capable
of the &s;ame Degree of Motion with it, and
being fixt there, it wou'd for ever be car|ried
about by the Motion of the <HI>Vortex,</HI>
without either approaching to, or receding
from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and &s;o become a <HI>Planet.</HI>
Suppo&s;ing this true then, we may imagine
our <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> to have been at fir&s;t divided
into &s;everal <HI>Vortices</HI> in the <HI>Center,</HI> of which
<PB N="33" REF="66">

of the&s;e being gradually incru&s;tated, were
&s;wallow'd up by others, more powerful

and carried away by the bigge&s;t
<HI>Solar Vortex,</HI> except &s;ome few that were
thrown of in right Lines from one <HI>Vortex</HI>
to another, and became <HI>Comets.</HI> Hence it
appears that the <HI>Planets</HI> that are neare&s;t the

which makes up the Body of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
moves with greater Velocity the Parts of
the <HI>Vortex,</HI> and the Bodies &s;wiming there|in,
that are neare&s;t it, than tho&s;e that are
remoter, which is the rea&s;on why the <HI>Pla|nets</HI>
next the <HI>Sun,</HI> fini&s;h their Periods &s;ooner
than tho&s;e that are more remote; and that
the&s;e <HI>Planets</HI> move about their own <HI>Axes,</HI>
becau&s;e they were <HI>Sun like,</HI> lucid, and re|volving
Bodies before.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="67">
&sect; XXIII. Now not to mention the
many Defects in the Mechanical Produ|ction
of this immaginary <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> I &s;hall
only take Notice (as Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> has) of
the known <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Appearances it contra|dicts;
and the Ab&s;urdities wou'd follow,
tho' we &s;hou'd allow the Author all that
he wou'd have granted. And, 1. It is
certain that a <HI>Vortex</HI> produc'd by the Re|volution
of a <HI>Sphere,</HI> about a giv'n <HI>Axis,</HI>
wou'd be propagated <HI>in infinitum,</HI> if nothing
did hinder it; and &s;eeing there mu&s;t be
as many &s;uch <HI>Vortices</HI> as there are fixt Stars,
one <HI>Vortex</HI> wou'd nece&s;&s;arily run into ano|ther,
and every Particle wou'd be acted
by a Motion compounded, of the Motions
of all the <HI>Central Spheres,</HI> which is ab|&s;urd
and contrary to that Con&s;tancy and
Limitation ob&s;ervable in the Cele&s;tial Ap|pearances.
2. Since the Motion of the
Parts of the <HI>Vortices</HI> neare&s;t the <HI>Center</HI> is
&s;wifter than that of the more remote, they
will pre&s;s upon the exterior Parts, and
thereby perpetually communicate &s;ome
part of their Motion to them, and there|fore
<PB N="35" REF="68">
the&s;e interior parts of the <HI>Vortex,</HI> will
be continually lo&s;ing &s;ome part of their
Motion, which never being re&s;tored, the&s;e
parts mu&s;t gradually move &s;lower, till at
la&s;t the Motion is quite de&s;troy'd. 3. Ac|cording
to this <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> each <HI>Planet</HI> is
of the &s;ame Den&s;ity with the parts of the
<HI>Vortex</HI> in which it &s;wims, and is govern'd
by the &s;ame Laws of Motion, and is as it
were, only concreted parts or the <HI>Vortex:</HI>
Now the times of the periodical Motion,
of Bodies, carry'd about by a <HI>Vortex</HI> are
in duplicat proportion of the Di&s;tances
from the Center; whereas the Squares of
Times of the periodical Motions of the
<HI>Planets,</HI> are as the Cubes of the Di&s;tances
from the <HI>Center;</HI> and con&s;equently the <HI>Pla|nets</HI>
cannot be carry'd about by a <HI>Vortex.</HI>
4. If a <HI>Vortex</HI> run out <HI>in infinitum,</HI> then a
Body carry'd round by it, wou'd certainly
de&s;cribe a perfect Circle, unle&s;s &s;omething
&s;olid did hinder it, and therefore, the greater
Di&s;tance there were between the&s;e &s;olid
Bounds, or the larger the Ba&s;on be which
contains the <HI>Vortex,</HI> in re&s;pect of th <HI>Orbit</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="69">
of the Body carry'd about in it, the nearer
wou'd this Orbit approach to a Circle.
<HI>i. e.</HI> The Excentricity of the <HI>Planets</HI> neare&s;t
the <HI>Sun,</HI> would be le&s;s than that of tho&s;e
more remote, the contrary of which is
true, for that of <HI>Mercury</HI> is greater than
that of <HI>Saturn.</HI> Moreover, &s;ince the <HI>Pla|nets</HI>
in this <HI>Vortex</HI> wou'd nece&s;&s;arily move
in Orbits nearly &s;imilar to that of the &s;ides
of the containing Ba&s;on, it wou'd follow
that the <HI>Aphelia</HI> of all the <HI>Planets</HI> &s;een from
the Sun, wou'd be directed towards the
&s;ame fixt Stars: but this too is contrary to
Ob&s;ervation. Likewi&s;e the Matter of the
<HI>Vortex</HI> (as of every Fluid) when bound
up within &s;trait Bounds, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
move fa&s;ter than when enlarg'd in a wider
Channel; <HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Planets</HI> mu&s;t move fa|&s;ter
in their <HI>Perihelia,</HI> than in their <HI>Aphelia,</HI>
which contradicts Experience. 5. A Body
carry'd about in a <HI>Vortex</HI> of the &s;ame den|&s;ity
with it, wou'd nece&s;&s;arily de&s;cribe a
Circle to who&s;e Plane, the Axis of the cen|tral
Body which produces the Circulation
of the Fluid, wou'd be perpendicular; but
<PB N="37" REF="70">
there is not one <HI>Planet</HI> to the Plane of
who&s;e Orbit the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Axis is perpendicu|lar.
La&s;tly, The <HI>Comets</HI> have their Orbits,
not only oblique, but &s;ometimes at right
Angles with the Plane of the Ecliptick,
&s;ometimes the Cour&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Comets</HI> is Dia|metrically
oppo&s;ite to that of the <HI>Sun;</HI> they
per&s;evere in their Motions without any
change, they de&s;cribe equal <HI>Area's</HI> by a
<HI>Radius</HI> from the <HI>Sun</HI> in equal times, they
enter into the <HI>Vortex</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> all which
is impo&s;&s;ible, if the <HI>Solar Vortex</HI> mov'd
round with Force &s;ufficient to carry the&s;e
va&s;t Bodies of the <HI>Planets</HI> along with
it.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. This <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> is &s;omewhat
altered and mended by the famous Mr. <HI>Leib|nitz,</HI>
he accomodates it better to the Cele|&s;tial
Appearances, and makes it agree more
exactly to the Rules of <HI>Geometry.</HI> He fir&s;t
of all &s;hows, that all Bodies which in a
Fluid de&s;cribe a <HI>Curve-Line,</HI> are mov'd by
the Fluid, for of them&s;elves they wou'd
de&s;cribe right Lines, and nothing but the
Fluid concurs to turn them out of their
<PB N="38" REF="71">
way. He next &s;hows, that every <HI>Planet</HI> is
carry'd about by a Motion compounded of
two other Motions, <HI>viz</HI> the <HI>Harmonical
Circulation</HI> of the carrying Fluid, and the
<HI>Paracentrical Motion</HI> of acce&s;s to, or rece&s;s
from the <HI>Sun.</HI> The <HI>Planets</HI> de&s;cribe <HI>Area's</HI>
by a <HI>Radius</HI> from the <HI>Sun,</HI> proportional to
their times. Now the Fluid that carries
the <HI>Planets</HI> mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity circulate &s;o
as to produce this effect, which cannot
be done otherwi&s;e, than by &s;uppo&s;ing in|numerable
concentrical Orbs of exceeding
thinne&s;s to make up the <HI>Vortex,</HI> every one
of which has its own proper way of Cir|culation,
<HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e Orbs that are neare&s;t
the <HI>Sun</HI> circulate fa&s;te&s;t, and the Veloci|ties
of the Circulations are every where re|ciprocally
proportional to the Di&s;tances of
the re&s;pective Orbs from the <HI>Sun,</HI> which
will nece&s;&s;arily make the <HI>Planet</HI> in what|ever
part of <HI>Vortex</HI> it is, de&s;cribe equal <HI>Area's</HI>
in equal Times; for the&s;e <HI>Area's</HI> are in a
compounded proportion of their <HI>Radii</HI> or
Di&s;tances from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and a reciprocal
proportion of the Arches or Lengths of
<PB N="39" REF="72">
the Circulations, which in this ca&s;e will
make a proportion of equality, and
this Law of Circulation of the <HI>Vortex</HI>
he calls <HI>Harmonical.</HI> The <HI>Paracentrical</HI>
Motion is compounded of two others, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Excu&s;&s;ory</HI> Impre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Harmonical</HI>
Circulation, whereby all Bodies moving
in a <HI>Curve,</HI> endeavour to recede from the
<HI>Center</HI> by the <HI>Tangent,</HI> and the Attraction
of the <HI>Sun</HI> or the Gravitation of the <HI>Pla|net</HI>
toward it; and this <HI>Leibnitz</HI> is of Opi|nion,
ari&s;es from an Impul&s;e communi|cated
by the Circulating Fluid. Now &s;ince
the <HI>Planets</HI> move in <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits, in one
of who&s;e <HI>foci</HI> the <HI>Sun</HI> is, and by a <HI>Ra|dius</HI>
from the <HI>Sun</HI> de&s;cribe equal <HI>Area's</HI> in
equal Times, which no other Law of a
Circulating Fluid, but the <HI>Harmonical</HI> Cir|culation
can Account for, we mu&s;t find
out a Law for the <HI>Paracentrical</HI> Motion,
that may make the Orbits <HI>Elliptick.</HI> The
<HI>Excu&s;&s;ory</HI> Impre&s;&s;ion of the Circulating
Fluid, wou'd throw off the <HI>Planet</HI> from
the Center by the <HI>Tangent.</HI> Wherefore the
Attraction of the <HI>Sun,</HI> or the Gravitation
<PB N="40" REF="73">
of the <HI>Planets</HI> towards it, mu&s;t be &s;uffi|cient
to de&s;troy this Effect; and be&s;ides,
to make them move in <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits,
which cannot be brought about, unle&s;s
this Attraction or Gravitation be recipro|cally
as the Squares of the Di&s;tances from
the <HI>Focus,</HI> which is the Sum of <HI>Leibnitz</HI>'s
Doctrine upon this Head.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. But even this Account of the
Cele&s;tial Motions is undoubtedly fal&s;e and
in&s;ufficient for the&s;e Rea&s;ons. 1. The <HI>Co|mets,</HI>
as was formerly &s;aid, have their
Orbits, &s;ome of them very oblique, nay,
&s;ometimes at right Angles with the <HI>Zo|diak,</HI>
and &s;ometimes the Cour&s;es of the&s;e
<HI>Comets</HI> are quite contrary to that of the
<HI>Planets:</HI> Now the <HI>Comets</HI> de&s;cribing about
the <HI>Sun Area's,</HI> proportional to the times,
mo&s;t be carry'd about by a <HI>Harmonically</HI>
circulating Fluid, as well as the <HI>Planets,</HI>
and thus we &s;hou'd have <HI>Vortices</HI> contrary
to <HI>Vortices,</HI> which is very ab&s;urd. 2. This
Suppo&s;ition is not only unrea&s;onable, but
di&s;agreeable to the uniform Simplicity of
Nature; nor is there any thing in the Mo|tions
<PB N="41" REF="74">
of the Heavenly Bodies &s;o difficult
to explain, as this very <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> which
is introduc'd to account for them. Be&s;ides,
3. In equable Motion, the Times are al|ways
as the Spaces directly, and the Ve|locities
reciprocally; but in a Circular
Motion, the Spaces in one Revolution are
as the <HI>Radii,</HI> and in an <HI>Harmonical</HI> Circula|tion,
the Velocities are as the <HI>Radii</HI> recipro|cally,
and therefore the periodical Times
of a Fluid circulating <HI>Harmonically,</HI> are in
the Duplicate Proportion of the <HI>Radii.</HI>
Now the periodical Times of the <HI>Planets</HI>
are in Se&s;quiplicate Proportion, and not a
Duplicate Proportion of the Di&s;tances from
the <HI>Center</HI> or the <HI>Radii,</HI> and con&s;equently
the <HI>Planets</HI> cannot be carried about by an
<HI>Harmonically</HI> circulating Fluid. To this it
may be an&s;wer'd, that this <HI>Harmonical</HI>
Circulation is not continued from <HI>Mer|cury</HI>
to <HI>Saturn,</HI> but is interrupted, and
reaches only from <HI>Mercury</HI>'s <HI>Perihelium</HI> to
his <HI>Aphelium,</HI> and there breaks off, and be|gins
again at <HI>Venus</HI>'s <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and reaches
to her <HI>Aphelium,</HI> and is there again inter|rupted,
<PB N="42" REF="75">
and &s;o on through the whole Sy|&s;tem
of the <HI>Planets:</HI> But what a gha&s;tly
and un&s;ightly kind of Deformity there
wou'd happen on this Suppo&s;ition, every one
may ea&s;ily &s;ee, this is not like the unform
and &s;impleMea&s;ures of Nature, Be&s;ides, the
<HI>Comets</HI> moving forward in the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> pa&s;s
through all the&s;e Cha&s;ms and Inter&s;tices,
and notwith&s;tanding, move in the &s;ame
manner, as if they were carried by a Fluid,
circulating <HI>Harmonically</HI> according to &s;ome
uniform Law, neither do their Appearan|ces
&s;hew the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of the&s;e Inter|ruptions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. It being thus prov'd, that
the Cele&s;tial Bodies do not revolve by the
means of any circulating Fluid, they mu&s;t
be kept in their Orbits, by &s;ome <HI>Attractive</HI>
Power in the <HI>Sun,</HI> or by &s;ome gravitating
Power in them towards him, which is the
&s;ame thing, &s;ince it mu&s;t be mutual by the
third Law. This Gravitating or Attract|ing
Power of the great Bodies of the Uni|ver&s;e
towards one another, &s;ome <HI>Philo&s;o|&s;ophers</HI>
endeavour <HI>Mechanically</HI> to account
<PB N="43" REF="76">
$or, from the Action of a Subtile Matter,
which violently whirling round the <HI>Sun</HI>
$n general, the <HI>Earth</HI> and the re&s;t of the
<HI>Planets</HI> in particular, and acquiring there|by
a Power of receding from the Center,
$mpels Bodies towards that Center about
which the &s;tronge&s;t Circulation is made;
or being driven with an immen&s;e Velocity
$n right Lines according to all po&s;&s;ible Di|rections,
impels the Body according to
$he Direction of that part of this Subtile
Fluid, which is lea&s;t re&s;i&s;ted by the inter|po&s;ition
of other Bodies. And thus, not
only Bodies within the Sphere of the <HI>Earth</HI>'s
Activity are impell'd towards it, but al&s;o
the <HI>Planets</HI> do gravitate towards the <HI>Sun,</HI>
out without entering into the particular
manner of the Explication of Gravitation
according to this Scheme, there be two or
three Objections again&s;t all the po&s;&s;ible Ac|counts
of Gravity in particular, or Gravi|tation
in general from the Circulation of a
Subtile Matter. 1. It is impo&s;&s;ible from the
fir&s;t Part of this <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> to account for
Bodies gravitating towards a Point, for
<PB N="44" REF="77">
the Motion <HI>quaqu&agrave; ver&s;um</HI> in a great Circle
of the Sphere, which is alledged to &s;alve
this Difficulty, is a Contradiction to Nature,
no &s;uch thing being either conceiveable or
po&s;&s;ible. 2. It is impo&s;&s;ible to explain
whence the Circular Motion of this &s;ubtile
Fluid comes, there mu&s;t be conceiv'd ano|ther
&s;ubtile Fluid Moving after &s;ome cer|tain
manner to produce the Motion of
of that Fluid, which is the Cau&s;e of Gra|vity,
and &s;o on in <HI>infinitum,</HI> or el&s;e we
mu&s;t admit its Motion without any Cau&s;e,
which is harder to conceive than Gravity
it &s;elf. 3. That Matter which is the
Cau&s;e of Gravity, or by who&s;e Motion
it is produc'd in all the po&s;&s;ible <HI>Mechani|cal</HI>
Explications thereof, mu&s;t be without
Gravity which is Ab&s;urd Matter being
every where in rea&s;on to be &s;uppos'd of
the &s;ame uniform Nature, and its Gravity
to be always proportional to the Quantity
of its &s;olid Ma&s;s. 4. Bodies from the Im|pul&s;e
of a Fluid can only gravitate in pro|portion
to their Surfaces, and not accor|ding
to their Quantity of Matter, which
<PB N="45" REF="78">
is contraray to Experience; for we find
all Bodies gravitate in proportion to their.
Solidities, <HI>i. e.</HI> their Quantity of Matter;
And tho' this Difficulty may be remov'd,
by &s;uppo&s;ing Bodies to con&s;i&s;t originally
of <HI>Cylinders</HI> of infinitely &s;mall <HI>Ba&s;es,</HI> for
on &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, the&s;e <HI>Cylinders</HI> wou'd
be to one another as their Surfaces, their
<HI>Ba&s;es</HI> being nothing, and con&s;equently, the
Gravities of Bodies, which by the Action
of this &s;ubtile Fluid are as their Surfaces,
wou'd be al&s;o as their Solidities, <HI>i. e.</HI> the
Quantities of Matter they contain, &s;ince
the Surfaces of the original Particles of
Bodies are as their &s;olid Contents. Yet
this is &s;o very hard a <HI>Po&s;tulate,</HI> to require
Bodies to be diver&s;ified, only by the
Lengths of their primitive con&s;tituent <HI>Cy|linders,</HI>
that I can't &s;ee how it can po&s;&s;ibly
account for all the varieties of Colours,
Ta&s;tes and Smells, and other &s;en&s;ible Qua|lities
of Bodies, which ari&s;e from the Di|ver&s;ities
of the Texture and Figure of their
con&s;tituent Parts. But that which in my
Opinion, overthrows all &s;uch <HI>Mechanical</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="79">
Accounts, however artfully contriv'd, is
that. 5. There &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary to|ward
a full Explication of the Appearan|ces
of Nature, &s;everal different Conditions
of this Univer&s;al Law of <HI>Gravitation,</HI> which
cannot be <HI>Mechanically</HI> explain'd, without
&s;uppo&s;ing different Sy&s;tems of this Fluid,
to move after different Manners, and ac|cording
to different Laws, which will nei|ther
accord ea&s;ily together, nor &s;eem like
the Limitations and Simplicity of Nature.
That there are different Conditions of the
Univer&s;al Law of <HI>Gravitation,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily to
be &s;uppos'd, &s;eems evident from the Na|ture
of Light, as Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has explain'd
it from certain Experiment; and there are
other Appearances in Nature, that &s;eem to
require Conditions different from that
which governs the the Motions of the Ce|le&s;tial
Bodies, and Cau&s;es the inflexions of
Light, as &s;hall be afterwards &s;hown.
Now, to account <HI>Mechanically</HI> for the&s;e
different Conditions of the General Law of
<HI>Gravitation,</HI> there mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;up|pos'd
various and different Sy&s;tems of this
<PB N="47" REF="80">
&s;ubtile Fluid, which looks a little odd,
e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that is not as yet
known how many and how different the&s;e
Sy&s;tems mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to account for
all the various Conditions of this General
Law, that may hereafter be di&s;covered ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to explain the various Appearan|ces
of Nature. 6. La&s;tly, this whole
Affair is more Naturally and Simply to be
accounted for from Principles now to be
laid down.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary</HEAD>
<P>&sect; XXVII. From what has been &s;aid
it appears, that the Attraction or Gravi|tation
of Bodies toward one another, is
not to be <HI>Mechanically</HI> accounted for, and
&s;ince it has been likewi&s;e &s;hown, that the
<HI>Planets</HI> cannot continue their Motions in
their Orbits, without the Suppo&s;ition of
&s;uch an Attraction or Gravitation, it is
evident, that this mu&s;t be a Principle an|nex'd
to Matter by the <HI>Creator</HI> of the
World; it is a Principle no ways e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="48" REF="81">
to Matter, &s;ince it is the Source and the O|rigin
of the Cele&s;tial Motions, as Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI>
and after him Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> has demon&s;trated
And by the fir&s;t Law of Nature and its Co|rollaries,
no kind of Motion is e&s;&s;ential to
Matter, and therefore Attraction or Gra|vitation
cannot be e&s;&s;ential to it; it is not
a Re&s;ult from the Nature of Matter, be|cau&s;e
the efficacy of Matter is communi|cated
by immediate Contact, and it can
by no means act at a di&s;tance; for we &s;ee
an Object, becau&s;e the Light reflected from
thence &s;trikes immediately upon our Or|gans
of Vi&s;ion, we &s;mell, becau&s;e parts of
the odorous Body touch the Nerves of our
<HI>No&s;trils,</HI> and univer&s;ally all the other Na|tural
Effects of Material things are per|form'd
by the meer Impul&s;e of one Body on
another, whereas this Power of Gravita|tion
acts at all Di&s;tances without any <HI>Me|dium</HI>
or In&s;trument to convey it, and pa&s;|&s;es
as far as the Limits (if any &s;uch there
are) of the Univer&s;e. Be&s;ides, by the fir&s;t
Law of Nature, Matter is entirely pa&s;&s;ive
in its Nature, and can no more tend to,
<PB N="49" REF="82">
or draw other Bodies then it can move of
it &s;elf; likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ing this Gravitation
of the parts of Matter toward one ano|ther
de&s;troy'd, yet &s;till Matter wou'd be
the &s;ame extended &s;olid Sub&s;tance. More|over,
if there were but one indivi&s;ible Part
of Matter in being, it could not be &s;aid
to have this Property, it being a Relative
one, and having re&s;pect only to other
Parts which it attracts; whereas impenetra|bility
or any other of the e&s;&s;ential Proper|ties
of Matter continues with it, ev'n when
it becomes indivi&s;ible. La&s;tly; That can|not
be e&s;&s;ential to Matter which is inten|ded
or remitted, but this Property increa&s;es
and dimini&s;hes reciprocally as the Squares
of the Di&s;tances dimini&s;h or increa&s;e, where|as
impenetrability, and the other e&s;&s;ential
Attibutes of Matter are always the &s;ame.
On all which Accounts, it's plain that this
Univer&s;al Force of <HI>Gravitation</HI> is the ef|fect
of the <HI>Divine Power</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> by
which the Operations of Material Agents
are pre&s;erv'd. And this Power of <HI>Gravita|tion</HI>
being thus impre&s;s'd on Matter, is one
<PB N="50" REF="83">
rea&s;on of the Di&s;tinction between the Laws
of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> for tho' the <HI>Ener|gy</HI>
of the Impre&s;&s;ion does &s;till la&s;t, yet its
not being e&s;&s;ential to Matter, nor ari&s;ing
from its Nature, is the rea&s;on why it ought
not to be reckon'd among tho&s;e Laws
which ari&s;e from the particular Texture,
Figure and Di&s;po&s;ition of Bodies, &s;uch as
mo&s;t of the Laws of Nature or Motion
are. The Chief Difficulties that I can find
have &s;traitned Learned Men, in admitting
this Principle of the Univer&s;al Law of the
<HI>Gravitation</HI> of Bodies upon one another are,
1. That they cannot conceive how this
Principle can be <HI>Mechanically</HI> accounted for,
and they think it <HI>Unphilo&s;ophical</HI> to admit
any Principle in the Explication of the Ap|pearances
of Nature which can't be thus ac|acounted
for. It is indeed in my Opinion
certain, that this Priciple cannot be <HI>Me|chanically</HI>
accounted for; for there is no o|ther
<HI>Mechanical</HI> Cau&s;e conceivable, this
Principle of the <HI>Gravitation</HI> of Bodies upon
one another, can ari&s;e from, but the Mo|tion
of &s;ome &s;ubtile Fluid, and were there
<PB N="51" REF="84">
no other Argument again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible Ex|plications
of <HI>Gravitation</HI> ari&s;ing from the
Motion of a &s;ubtile Fluid, but this one,
<HI>viz.</HI> that thereby the&s;e Parts of Matter
which are the Cau&s;e of, or produce <HI>Gravi|tation,</HI>
are upon this Suppo&s;ition, de&s;titute
of Gravity; I &s;hou'd think it &s;ufficient to
prejudice any inqui&s;itive Man again&s;t &s;uch
Explications; for it's certain that Nature
is uniform and con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf, and
wou'd not deprive one part of Matter of
&s;o Cardinal a Property, with which &s;he had
endow'd all the re&s;t. But ev'n the ad|mi&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch an <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> removes us
but one Step further from <HI>Immechanical</HI> Prin|ciples,
for the Cau&s;e of the Motion of this
&s;ubtile Fluid, which is the Cau&s;e of Gravity,
is it &s;elf <HI>Immechanical.</HI> Nor has any Body
ever pretended to a&s;&s;ign any other Cau&s;e
of the Motion of this &s;ubtile Fluid, but the
<HI>Omnipotent Cau&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Univer&s;e;</HI> and &s;ince
we mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity admit the Motion
of this &s;ubtile Fluid, which is the Cau&s;e of
<HI>Gravitation</HI> to be unaccountable without a
<HI>Fir&s;t Cau&s;e,</HI> why may we not rather ad|mit
<PB N="52" REF="85">
this <HI>Fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> to have impre&s;s'd this
Property in Matter, &s;ince that this Difficulty
is the &s;ame in both; and that be&s;ides, the
fir&s;t Suppo&s;ition is burthen'd with &s;everal
Additional ones, to which the &s;econd is
not liable. There has never been any
Sy&s;tem of <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy</HI> offered to
the World as yet, that does not require
&s;ome <HI>Po&s;tulates</HI> that are not to be accounted
for <HI>Mechanically;</HI> the fewe&s;t any one pre|tends
to, are the Exi&s;tence of Matter, the
Impre&s;&s;ion of Rectilinear Motions, and the
pre&s;ervation of the Faculties of Natural
Agents, which no Man has pretended to
account for from Principles of <HI>Mechani&s;m;</HI>
and the Impre&s;&s;ion of an <HI>attractive Faculty</HI>
upon Matter, is no harder <HI>Po&s;tulate</HI> than
any of the&s;e; but &s;ince it is Matter of Fact
and Demon&s;tration, that Matter is in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this Quality; for we daily &s;ee,
that the Earth draws to its Center all Bo|dies
within its Activity, we mu&s;t allow
of it, whether it be to be <HI>Mechanically</HI> ac|counted
for or not; anc &s;ince it is not to
be accounted for from <HI>Mechanical</HI> Princi|ples,
<PB N="53" REF="86">
as I think, I have demon&s;trated, we
mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity refer it to the Power and
Influence of the <HI>Fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> of all things.
2. Another Difficulty ingenious Men have
in the Conception of this Quality in Mat|ter,
is how it can aft at a Di&s;tance with|out
any <HI>Medium</HI> to convey this Action, as
of nece&s;&s;ity it mu&s;t. Now, were there
no other Difficulty of the like Nature in
Philo&s;ophy but this one, it might &s;tumble
judicious Per&s;ons; but we know the man|ner
of <HI>Thinking</HI> and <HI>Reflection,</HI> of <HI>Remem|bring</HI>
and <HI>Sen&s;ation,</HI> are things not ea&s;ily to
be explain'd, and yet we mu&s;t admit them.
The Communication of Motion from one
part of Matter to another, the Continuation
of a Body in Motion after it is removed
from the impellent Body, and ev'n the
fir&s;t Production of Matter and Motion, are
not to be accounted for, and yet there is
no denying that &s;uch things really are,
when we are capable to explain how our
Souls and our Bodies act mutually up|on
one another, we may come to be a|ble
to conceive how Matter acts at a Di|&s;tance
<PB N="54" REF="87">
without any <HI>Medium;</HI> but till then,
it is &s;ufficient to know, that &s;uch a Qua|lity
is actually lodg'd in Matter, and that
it is the Cau&s;e of all the Great and Uni|form
Appearances of Nature. No wi&s;e
and hone&s;t Man, who throughly under|&s;tands
the Matter, will offer to explain by
Rules of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> how this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of
things was produc'd, nor how the Faculties
of Material Organs are pre&s;erv'd, whence
they aro&s;e, and what way they commu|nicate
their Actions and Influences to one
another; it will &s;uffice &s;uch, from the Pre|&s;ent
Appearances to inve&s;tigate the Powers
and Forces of Nature, and from the&s;e to
account for future Ob&s;ervations and Ap|pearances;
if we admit an <HI>infinitely Wi&s;e
and Powerful Being</HI> to have made this,
World, there will be little Difficulty in al|lowing
him to have impre&s;s'd on Matter
what property he pleas'd, and if we
will not admit of &s;uch a Being, there are
much greater and harder Difficulties in the
<HI>Mechanical</HI> Explication of the Nature of
things to be &s;urmounted, as &s;hall be after|wards
&s;hown.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="88">
&sect; XXVIII. The great and primary
<HI>Law</HI> then, imprinted by the Author of Na|ture
upon all the Bodies of this Univer&s;e, is
that every part of every Body attracts or
gravitates toward every part of every other
Body, and the mo&s;t general Conditions of
this Law are, that the <HI>Force</HI> by which
one part attracts another in different Di&s;tan|ces
from it, is reciprocally as the Squares of
tho&s;e Di&s;tances, and that at the &s;ame Di|&s;tance,
the <HI>Force</HI> of the Attraction or Gra|vitation
of one part toward divers others,
is as the Quantity of Matter they contain:
By the Virtue and Efficacy of this Law,
the <HI>Planets</HI> mu&s;t perpetually move in <HI>Ellip|tick</HI>
Orbits, if they meet with no re&s;i&s;tance
in the Spaces in which they move, (their
Di&s;tances from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and their Recti|linear
Motions being once adju&s;ted by the
Author of Nature,) and in &s;uch a manner,
that a Line drawn from the <HI>Sun</HI> to them,
de&s;cribes equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal Times; and
their <HI>periodical</HI> Revolutions will be in a
<HI>&s;e&s;quiplicate</HI> proportion of their middle Di|&s;tances.
By Virtue of the &s;ame Law, and
<PB N="56" REF="89">
of the&s;e Conditions, the <HI>Moon</HI> will for ever
turn round the Earth, as the Earth doth
round the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Sattellits</HI> of <HI>Saturn</HI>
and <HI>Jupiter</HI> round them; As al&s;o the <HI>Comets</HI>
will in very oblong <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits de&s;cribe
about the <HI>Sun</HI> equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal times;
But becau&s;e the <HI>Sun,</HI> not only attracts the
<HI>Planets</HI> and <HI>Comets,</HI> as al&s;o the&s;e the <HI>Sun,</HI> but
likewi&s;e the <HI>Planets</HI> attract one another,
their Orbits will be &s;omewhat irregular, and
differ from exact <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI> which will be
more &s;en&s;ible in the Motions of the <HI>Moon,</HI>
becau&s;e She is &s;o near to us; and this one
Con&s;ideration, well apply'd, will account
for all the Irregularities hitherto ob&s;erv'd in
the Cele&s;tial Appearances, as Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>
and after him Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> has &s;hown; Like|wi&s;e
&s;ince a great part of this our Globe is
covered over with Water, it is plain that
by the Force of this Attraction of the
<HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon,</HI> the Water that lyes directly
under them will be rais'd above its ordi|nary
Level, which will likewi&s;e happen if
they are directly in the oppo&s;ite part of our
Globe, becau&s;e the remoter parts of the Wa|ter
<PB N="57" REF="90">
will be le&s;s attracted than the nearer,
and the Motions produc'd in the Waters by
the attraction of the&s;e two <HI>Luminaries</HI> can't
be ob&s;erv'd &s;eperately, but their Forces
make up a compound Motion, which at
new and full <HI>Moon</HI> is greate&s;t, and lea&s;t at
the <HI>Quadratures,</HI> and the&s;e effects are vari|ou&s;ly
limited by the different Di&s;tances of
the&s;e <HI>Luminaries</HI> from the Earth, their <HI>De|clinations</HI>
from the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and the various
<HI>Latitudes</HI> of Places. By this Gravitation,
Bodies on this Globe will pre&s;s towards its
Center, tho' not exactly thither neither, by
rea&s;on of the <HI>oblate &s;pherodical</HI> Figure of
the Earth ari&s;ing from its diurnal Rotation
about its Axis. Thus we &s;ee this one Prin|ciple
will account for all the great and con|&s;tant
Appearances of Nature, and none but
this will exactly an&s;wer any one, much le&s;s
them all, which is a demon&s;tration of its
Truth. And were not our Terre&s;trial <HI>Phy|&s;iology</HI>
more complicated than the Cele&s;tial
(by rea&s;on of the multiplicity of different
Attractions proceeding from the many dif|ferent
Bodies that &s;urround any particular
<PB N="58" REF="91">
one) we &s;hould doubtle&s;s &s;ee the Extent
of this Principle, in accounting for the
more minute, and le&s;s con&s;tant appearan|ces
on this our Globe, as in a great many
we actually are. Add to the&s;e Con&s;idera|tions,
that we are certain by the Effects,
that the Gravitation by which the <HI>Planets</HI>
are kept in their Orbits, and by which the
<HI>Moon</HI> turns round the Earth, is of the &s;ame
Nature with that by which heavy Bodies
tend toward the Center of the Earth, and
con&s;equently, &s;ince we feel that Terre&s;trial
Bodies are attracted by the Earth, and &s;ince
we know by the <HI>&s;econd Law</HI> of Nature,
that Action and Reaction are mutual and
equal, it is plain that every part of Matter
attracts every other part, and that the Force
of this <HI>Attraction</HI> (as all other Virtues pro|pogated
round in a Sphere) is recipro|cally
as the Squares of the Di&s;tances from
the Center of the Action. In &s;hort, &s;ince
Action and Reaction is mutual, and &s;ince
the <HI>Primary Planets</HI> gravitate towards the
<HI>Sun,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Secondary Planets</HI> tend to|ward
the Primary ones as the Center of
<PB N="59" REF="92">
their Motions, and &s;ince the Decrea&s;e
and Increa&s;e of this Gravitation is of
the &s;ame Nature with that of our Ter|re&s;tial
Gravity, &s;ince likewi&s;e the <HI>Sun</HI> di|&s;turbs
the Motion of that <HI>Moon,</HI> and the
<HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI> tho&s;e of our <HI>Earth,</HI> it is
plain they all, <HI>Sun, Moon, Planets</HI> and
their <HI>Satellits,</HI> mutually gravitate upon one
another.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. Having thus in the Gene|ral,
e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Laws <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI>
and deduc'd &s;uch Con&s;equences from 'em
as we found nece&s;&s;ary to clear &s;ome Parts
of the following Di&s;cour&s;es; having like|wi&s;e
&s;hown the Nece&s;&s;ity of admitting the
Univer&s;al Law of <HI>Gravitation</HI> to &s;olve the
Cele&s;tial Apperances, and hinted the great
U&s;e of this Principle in the Cele&s;tial <HI>Phy|&s;iology,</HI>
let us next proceed to &s;ome of the
mo&s;t <HI>Univer&s;al</HI> of our Terre&s;tial <HI>Phaenomena;</HI>
and fir&s;t of all, let us enquire into the Nature
and Cau&s;e of Fluidity, which &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t
principally in the <HI>Mobility</HI> of &s;ome parts, with|out
carrying along with 'em the re&s;t, or the
ea&s;ie &s;lipping of &s;ome Parts upon others un|mov'd,
<PB N="60" REF="93">
at lea&s;t, not mov'd after the manner
of &s;olid Bodies. All the Bodies in the Uni|ver&s;e
are Originally compounded of &s;olid
Parts, tho' not indivi&s;ible, yet very &s;mall
and firm, and Fluids mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take
in the&s;e four Conditions. 1. That their
Parts be extremely little, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o very &s;mall,
that no Eye, however a&s;&s;i&s;ted, be able to
perceive their Magnitude, we have been
able to di&s;cover the Figures of Bodies &s;wim|ing
in Fluids, but no one as yet has been
able to di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>Figures</HI> or <HI>Magni|tudes</HI>
of the con&s;tituent Parts of <HI>Liquors.</HI>
2. That their Figures be <HI>&s;pherical,</HI> or at lea&s;t
<HI>&s;pheriodical</HI> or approaching to one of the&s;e,
&s;o that they may touch only in a Point,
and by con&s;equence, one Particle may ea|&s;ily
&s;lip upon another, and for this End.
3. They mu&s;t be exactly &s;mooth and po|li&s;h'd,
and &s;ubjected to the Univer&s;al Law
of Gravitation, whereby each Particle of
the Fluid attracts another, whence that co|he&s;ion
in the Parts of the fine&s;t natural
Fluids proceeds; but their Gravity mu&s;t
be &s;uch, that the Force thereof may ea&s;ily
<PB N="61" REF="94">
exceed the Force of their Cohe&s;ion; and
here we are to di&s;tingui&s;h between the&s;e
Fluids, generated by the Force of the Fire,
and tho&s;e that are naturally &s;uch, there be|ing
no nece&s;&s;ity of attributing any particu|lar
Figure to the Parts of the fir&s;t Kind,
which own their Fluidity to the Force of the
Particles of Fire, which tear a&s;under the
Parts of &s;olid Bodies, and keep 'em in a
perpetual Agitation, and thereby make 'em
appear in the Form of a Fluid, whereas
the Appearances of natural Fluids do ne|ce&s;&s;arily
require the Conditions in their
Parts ju&s;t now a&s;&s;ign'd. 4. The Particles
of natural Fluids mu&s;t be &s;imilar, of equal
<HI>Diameters,</HI> of equal Solidity, and con&s;e|quently
of equal &s;pecifick Gravities, that
they may be <HI>Homogeneous,</HI> and of the &s;ame
uniform Nature; from the&s;e general Sup|po&s;itions,
all the general Appearances may
be ea&s;ily accounted for.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Water &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of
&s;mall, &s;mooth, hard, porous, &s;pherical Par|ticles
of equal <HI>Diameters,</HI> and equal &s;peci|fick
Gravities, which have between 'em
<PB N="62" REF="95">
&s;ome Spaces &s;o large, and ranged in &s;uch
a manner, as to be pervious on all Sides.
Their Smoothne&s;s, makes 'em &s;lip ea&s;ily
upon one another, their <HI>Sphericity</HI> keeps 'em
from touching one another in more Points
than one, by both which, their Frictions
in &s;liding upon one another is rendered the
lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible; their Hardne&s;s is the rea&s;on
why Water is incompre&s;&s;ible, when the
Air lodg'd in it, is exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The <HI>Poro&s;ity</HI> of the Parti|cles
of Water (which is &s;o great, that a
<HI>Cubical</HI> mea&s;ure of Water contains at lea&s;t
forty times more Pores than Parts, for Wa|ter
is nineteen times lighter than Gold, and
con&s;equently nineteen times rarer than
Gold; and Gold will by much pre&s;&s;ure,
let Water pa&s;s through it, and &s;o may be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have more Pores than &s;olid
Parts, and by con&s;equence, Water has
above forty times more Pores than &s;olid
Parts) accounts not only for the different
<HI>Specifick</HI> Gravity between Water and other
Fluids, &s;uch as <HI>Mercury,</HI> but al&s;o why it
is more ea&s;ily concreted into a &s;olid Form
<PB N="63" REF="96">
than other Fluids are. <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Freezing,</HI>
&s;eem to proceed from &s;ome <HI>Salin</HI> Sub|&s;tance
floating in the Air; we &s;ee that all
Salts, but more eminently &s;ome, mix'd
with Ice, prodigiou&s;ly encrea&s;e the Effects
and Force of Cold, we &s;ee all <HI>Salin</HI> Bo|dies
produce a Rigidity and Stiffne&s;s in
the Parts of Bodies to which they are
apply'd, much like the Effects of Free|zing,
we know, from Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory
of Cold,</HI> that Freezing increa&s;es the Di|men&s;ions
both of Solid and Fluid Bodies,
<HI>Micro&s;copial Ob&s;ervations</HI> inform us, that the
Figures of &s;ome Salts, before they &s;hoot
into Ma&s;&s;es, are thin double wedg'd-like
Particles, which have abundance of Sur|faces
in re&s;pect of their Solidity, which is
the rea&s;on why they &s;wim in Water when
they are rais'd once, tho' they be &s;pecifically
heavier. But this Effect may be more ju&s;tly
attributed to the &s;ame Cau&s;e that is pre&s;ent|ly
to be &s;hown to be the Cau&s;e of Freezing,
<HI>viz</HI> the &s;mall Points of the Salts getting
into the Pores of the Particles of Water,
whereby the&s;e Salts are &s;u&s;pended in the
<PB N="64" REF="97">
Water. In Summer the Heat of the Sun
di&s;&s;olves the <HI>&s;alin</HI> Particles into a Fluid,
breaks off their &s;lender Points, and by its
Action, keeps 'em in a perpetual Motion,
&s;o that they cannot &s;hoot into a &s;olid
Wedge, and con&s;equently are not able to
produce the <HI>Appearances</HI> of <HI>Cold</HI> upon Bo|dies;
but in Winter they are le&s;s di&s;turb'd,
and more at liberty to approach one ano|ther,
and by &s;hooting into tho&s;e <HI>Chry&s;tals</HI>
(as we &s;ee the Particles of artificial Salts
do, when the Liquor is expos'd to the
the Air) which by both their Extremities
in&s;inuating them&s;elves into the Pores of
Particles of Water, make 'em cohere, and
fix 'em in a &s;olid Form. The Dimen&s;ions
of freez'd Bodies are encreas'd by the In|&s;inuations
of the&s;e <HI>Chry&s;tal</HI> Wedges in their
Pores, and the Particles of congeal'd Water
are kept at &s;ome di&s;tance from one ano|ther,
by the Figure of the&s;e <HI>Chry&s;tals,</HI> which
in Freezing, in&s;inuate them&s;elves in their
Pores; for as I have before &s;aid, the&s;e
<HI>Chry&s;tals</HI> are ob&s;erv'd to have the Form of
a double Wedge, who&s;e Extremities are
<PB N="65" REF="98">
pointed and &s;lender, but its Middle broader
and larger, &s;o that when the Extremities
have in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the Pores
of two watery Particles, the&s;e <HI>Globules</HI> can|not
come to touch, by rea&s;on of the Large|ne&s;s
of the Middle of the&s;e <HI>Chry&s;tals,</HI> and
&s;o the&s;e Particles in Freezing, are kept at
greater Di&s;tances from one another, than
they were when in a fluid Form, and thus
the Spaces between the&s;e &s;pherical Parti|cles
become larger and wider than before,
which is one Rea&s;on why Ice becomes
<HI>&s;pecifically</HI> lighter than Water. But be&s;ides
this, there are many little <HI>Volumes</HI> of Air
included at &s;everal Di&s;tances, both in the
Pores of the watery Particles, and in the
Inter&s;tices form'd by their &s;pherical Fi|gures.
Now by the In&s;inuation of the&s;e
<HI>Chry&s;tals,</HI> the <HI>Volumes</HI> of Air are driv'n out
of the watery Particles, and many of 'em
uniting Form larger <HI>Volumes,</HI> which
thereby have a greater Force to expand
them&s;elves than when di&s;per&s;ed, and &s;o
both enlarge the Dimen&s;ions, and le&s;&s;en
the <HI>&s;pecifick</HI> Gravity of Water thus con|geal'd
<PB N="66" REF="99">
into Ice. Hence we may gue&s;s at
the manner, how Water impregnated with
<HI>Salts, Earths</HI> or <HI>Sulphurs,</HI> which are not
ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olvible, may form it&s;elf into <HI>Me|tals,
Minerals, Gems,</HI> and other <HI>Fo&s;&s;ils,</HI> the
Parts of the&s;e Mixtures becoming a Ce|ment
to the Particles of Water, or getting
into their Pores, change 'em into the&s;e
different Sub&s;tances.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary</HEAD>
<P>Hence it is plain, that the Quantity of
Water on this our <HI>Globe</HI> does daily decrea&s;e,
&s;ome part thereof being every Day turn'd
into <HI>Animal, Vegetable, Mineral,</HI> or <HI>Metallick</HI>
Sub&s;tances, which are not ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olv'd
into their component Parts again; for &s;e|parate
a few Particles of any Fluid, and
fa&s;ten them to a &s;olid Body, or keep 'em
a&s;under from one another, and they are
no more fluid, to produce which, a con|&s;iderable
number of the&s;e Particles are

<P>&sect; XXXIV. Other Fluids (be&s;ides that

all that which pa&s;&s;es under the
Name of <HI>Aetherial</HI> or <HI>Subtile Matter,</HI> which
I &s;hall examin hereafter) &s;eem to be com|pounded,
of the&s;e <HI>Primitive Fluids</HI> viz. <HI>Wa|ter,
Air, Mercury</HI> and <HI>Light;</HI> and of Par|ticles
<PB N="70" REF="103">
of <HI>Salts, Earths, Sulphurs,</HI> and &s;uch
like Ingredients, and the Varieties of &s;uch
mixt Fluids may in the general be thus e&s;ti|mated.
1. Suppo&s;ing all other things a|like,
e&s;pecially the <HI>Primitive Fluid,</HI> and the
Figure of the parts of the Ingredient, the
mixt Fluids will differ proportionably to the
Magnitude of the parts of the &s;olid Body,
which mixes with the Fluid; thus Water
or <HI>Lymph</HI> mix'd with <HI>Globules</HI> of Fle&s;h or
Blood of a greater <HI>Diameter,</HI> will make a
different Liquor from the &s;ame <HI>Lymph,</HI>
mix'd with <HI>Globules</HI> of Fle&s;h or Blood of a
le&s;s <HI>Diameter.</HI> 2. <HI>Caeteris Paribus,</HI> (e&s;peci|ally
the Fluid, the Figure, and the Dia|meters
of the mixing Ingredient being the
&s;ame,) the Liquor will differ proportiona|bly
to the Difference of the Firmne&s;s or
Softne&s;s of the Parts of the mixing Ingre|dient;
thus <HI>Mercury</HI> mix'd with <HI>Globules</HI>
of <HI>Diamond,</HI> would make a different Fluid
from <HI>Mercury</HI> mix'd with <HI>Globules</HI> of Sil|ver
or Bra&s;s. 3. All other things being
&s;uppos'd the &s;ame, the Fluid will differ pro|portionably
to the Difference of the &s;pe|cifick
<PB N="71" REF="104">
Gravities of the Particles of the
mixing Ingredients; thus a mixture of <HI>Gold</HI>
and <HI>Mercury</HI> will make a different Liquor
from that of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Lead,</HI> the Diffe|rence
of the &s;pecifick Gravities being here
only con&s;idered. 4. All other things
being &s;uppos'd the &s;ame, the Liquor will
differ according to the different Degrees of
the Cohe&s;ion of the &s;olid Parts among
them&s;elves; thus, <HI>Mercury</HI> mix'd with little
&s;pherical <HI>Magnets,</HI> will make a different
mixture from that of <HI>Mercury,</HI> mixt with
little Spheres of <HI>Lead</HI> or <HI>Iron.</HI> And the&s;e
&s;eem to be the <HI>Primogenial</HI> Differences of
mixt Fluids; Now, not only all the&s;e
may be differently combin'd with one ano|ther,
and with the four <HI>Primitive Fluids,</HI>
but al&s;o the Figures of the &s;olid Parts in
the mixture may be infinitely diversified,
(whereas we have hitherto only &s;uppos'd all
the mixing Solids <HI>&s;pherical</HI>) which will
make an infinitely infinite Variety of mixt
Liquors.</P>

&sect; XXXV. That <HI>Light</HI> is a Body, or a
material Sub&s;tance, &s;eems to be evident
from the&s;e Con&s;iderations. 1. It is pro|gre&s;&s;ive,
and requires a determin'd time to
go from one place to another, and is not
propagated in an In&s;tant, as is plain from
Mr. <HI>Romer</HI>'s Rea&s;onings upon the <HI>Eclip&s;es</HI>
of the <HI>Satellits</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> (which are con|firm'd
by the Ob&s;ervations of other <HI>A&s;tro|nomers</HI>)
whereby he demon&s;trates that <HI>Light</HI>
requires about ten Minutes to come from
the <HI>Sun</HI> to us. 2. It may be &s;topt or re|&s;i&s;ted
in its Pa&s;&s;age from one place to ano|ther,
by the Interpo&s;ition of an opake Body,
as other Fluids are &s;topt in their Cour&s;es
by the Oppo&s;ition of any &s;olid Body.
3. It may be congregated within a nar|rower,
or &s;cattered through a larger Space,
as is evident from reflecting <HI>Specula,</HI> and
refracting <HI>Burning-Gla&s;&s;es.</HI> 4. It may be
reflected, and the Determination of its Mo|tion
changed like other Bodies, and it ob|&s;erves
the &s;ame Law in its Reflexions that
other Bodies do, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Angle</HI> of Refle|xion
is always equal to the <HI>Angle</HI> of Inci|dence
<PB N="73" REF="106">
5. It may be put out of its Cour&s;e
more or le&s;s, according to the Nature of
the <HI>Medium,</HI> through which it pa&s;&s;es. 6. It
acts upon the <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Animals,</HI> and upon
all other Bodies, as other fluid Sub&s;tances
do, by &s;triking upon them with a deter|min'd
Force, by communicating a certain
Degree of Motion to them, by &s;eparating
their component Parts, and putting them
in Motion; all the&s;e Effects we daily &s;ee.
7. It may be confin'd and &s;hut up in de|termin'd
Spaces like other Fluids. The
The Light of the <HI>Sun</HI> will warm and heat
other &s;olid and fluid Bodies, which effects,
continue when their Cau&s;e is remov'd; the
parts of Light are yearly impri&s;on'd in Fruits,
Plants, and other Vegetables, as we &s;ee by
the Spirits, and warm Juices they afford.
8. La&s;tly, the parts of Light are endow'd
with various <HI>Original Colours,</HI> &s;ome are <HI>Red,</HI>
others <HI>Blue,</HI> others <HI>Yellow,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Green,</HI>
as Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demon&s;trated, and may
be &s;een by a <HI>Pri&s;m</HI> applied to the Hole of a
darken'd Room through which the <HI>Sun</HI>
&s;hines. Now all the&s;e are the Properties of
<PB N="74" REF="107">
Bodies and can belong to nothing but Mat|terial
Sub&s;tances.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. That the Particles of <HI>Light</HI>
are extremely little or &s;mall, we may con|clude
from thence, that they pa&s;s through
almo&s;t all Bodies that are pervious, &s;uch as
<HI>Chry&s;tals, Gla&s;&s;es,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Gems,</HI> and almo&s;t
all Fluids but <HI>Mercury,</HI> and that it freely
pa&s;&s;es where no other Fluid, how thin &s;oe|ver,
can enter, and yet, no eye, however
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, has been able to di&s;cover or di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the parts of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Fluid. But
what mo&s;t of all demon&s;trates their &s;mal|ne&s;s,
is that Light may be propagated from
innumerable different <HI>Luminous Bodies,</HI> with|out
any con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition to one ano|ther;
Suppo&s;e a Plate of Mettal (having
at the top the &s;malle&s;t Hole can be made)
were erected <HI>perpendicularly</HI> upon a <HI>Horizon|tal
Plane,</HI> and about it were &s;et innumera|ble
luminous Objects of about the &s;ame
height with the Plate, at an ordinary Di|&s;tance
from it, the Light proceeding from
every one of tho&s;e Objects, will be propaga|ted
through this &s;mall Hole, without interfe|ring
<PB N="75" REF="108">
This will appear by applying a dark
Object, in a &s;traight Line again&s;t the Lu|minous
Body, for the Light of this Body
will through the Hole be receiv'd upon the
dark Body; Now it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;o
many different <HI>Streams of Light</HI> cou'd be
tran&s;mitted through &s;o &s;mall a Hole, were
not the Particles of Light extremely &s;mall.
Add to this, that were not the Particles of
Light extremely little, being extremely
&s;wift, (<HI>i. e.</HI> more than a Million of times
&s;wifter than a <HI>Cannon Bullet,</HI> continuing in
its greate&s;t Velocity, as &s;hall be pre&s;ently
&s;hown) they wou'd peirce all kinds of &s;o|lid
Bodies with almo&s;t as great Facility as
they do Vacuities, whereas we &s;ee Light
regularly reflected from &s;ome Bodies.
Moreover, we find that innumerable dif|ferent
Spheres of Light within our <HI>Hori|zon,</HI>
may be propagated from their &s;everal
luminous Centers, without interfering. How
many Millions of Candles and <HI>Flambeaux</HI>
may we &s;ee &s;ending out their <HI>Tides</HI> of
Light, without cla&s;hing upon one ano|ther,
which argues both the Smallne&s;s of
<PB N="76" REF="109">
the Parts of Light, and the Largene&s;s of
the void Inter&s;tices between the Particles of
Air and other Bodies.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. How extremely &s;wift the
Particles of <HI>Light</HI> are, we may gather from
the forementioned Experiment of Mr. <HI>Ro|mer</HI>'s
whereby he demon&s;trates, that the
<HI>Streams of Light</HI> pa&s;s from the <HI>Sun</HI> to our <HI>Earth</HI>
in about ten Minutes; and <HI>Hugens</HI> in his <HI>Co&s;|motheoros,</HI>
has prov'd, that a <HI>Bullet</HI> conti|nuing
in the Velocity with which it leaves
the Mu&s;le of the <HI>Cannon,</HI> wou'd require
twenty five Years to pa&s;s from us to the <HI>Sun;</HI>
Now the <HI>Via Percur&s;a</HI> being the &s;ame in
both, the Velocities will be reciprocally as
the times, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Velocity of Light will
be to that of a <HI>Cannon-Bullet,</HI> per&s;i&s;ting in
its greate&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s, as twenty five Years is
to ten Minutes, or as 1314700 to one <HI>Pro|xime,</HI>
&s;o that the Velocity, with which the
Particles of Light pa&s;s, will be more than
a Million of times &s;wifter than a <HI>Cannon-Bullet.</HI>
Moreover, the Di&s;tance betwixt
the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>us</HI> is at Lea&s;t 12000 <HI>Diameters</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="110">
of the Earth, but allowing it to be only
10000 <HI>Diameters,</HI> the Light runs a thou&s;and
<HI>Diameters</HI> in a Minute, or &s;ixteen and half
Diameters of the Earth in a Second, or
beating of an Artery, that is more than
1100000 <HI>Toi&s;es,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>Diameter</HI> of the
Earth contains 2865 <HI>French Leagues,</HI> and
every <HI>League</HI> contains 2282 <HI>Toi&s;es,</HI> accor|ding
to the Numbers of Mr. <HI>Picard.</HI> But
Sound goes but about 180 <HI>Toi&s;es</HI> in a Se|cond,
wherefore Light is about &s;ix hundred
thou&s;and times more Swift than Sound.
Likewi&s;e &s;ince the Earth's middle <HI>Diameter</HI>
is 7846 Miles, each of which contains
5000 Feet; and &s;ince Light goes in a Se|cond
or in a pul&s;e of an Artery, &s;ixteen and
a half; <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Earth, it is plain,
that in every Second it runs at lea&s;t a hun|dred
and thirty thou&s;and Miles, which is
a prodigious and almo&s;t an incredible Space
in &s;o &s;hort a time. But the extraordinary
Effects of Light and Heat &s;eem to require
all this; we &s;ee how powerfully it acts
(being congregated) upon the mo&s;t com|pact

an abatement of its Velocity.</P>

Degree, and their Heat probably may
be pre&s;erv'd by the greatne&s;s of their Bo|dies,
and the mutual Action and Re action
between their Parts and the Light, which
they emit, and their Parts are kept from

<PB N="79" REF="112">
made it probable, that the <HI>Comet</HI> which ap|pear'd
in 1680. by approaching to the <HI>Sun</HI>
in its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> acquir'd &s;uch a Degree of
Heat, as to be 50000 Years a cooling,

Parts in a vibrating Motion, wherein Heat

Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demon|&s;trated
from plain and convincing Experi|ments,
that the <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of

he calls their <HI>Light,</HI> Compound and <HI>Heteroge|neal;</HI>
the greater or le&s;s <HI>Refrangibility</HI> of
Rays, is their Di&s;po&s;ition to be turn'd more

the roughe&s;t, which being contrary to Ex|perience,
<PB N="85" REF="118">
it is evident that the Reflexion
of a Ray is not effected by one &s;ingle Point
of the <HI>reflecting</HI> Body, but by &s;ome Power
of the Body, which is evenly diffus'd
over all its Surface, by which it acts upon
the Ray without immediate <HI>Contact,</HI> after
the manner hinted &sect; 37. Bodies <HI>reflect</HI>
and <HI>refract</HI> Light by one and the &s;ame
Power variou&s;ly exerci&s;ed in various Cir|cum&s;tances;
for when Light goes out of
Gla&s;s into Air as <HI>obliquely</HI> as it can po&s;&s;ibly
do, if its <HI>Incidence</HI> then be made &s;till more
<HI>oblique,</HI> it becomes totally <HI>reflected,</HI> for then
its <HI>refractive</HI> Power, or the Force of its
Attraction upon the Ray, becomes too
&s;trong to let any of the Rays go through.
Be&s;ides that, tho&s;e Surfaces of tran&s;parent
Bodies which have the greate&s;t <HI>refracting</HI>
Power, <HI>reflect</HI> the greate&s;t Quantity of
Light; for by Experiment it is found, that
in the <HI>Superficies</HI> interceding two tran&s;pa|rent
<HI>Mediums,</HI> the <HI>Reflexion</HI> is &s;tronger or
weaker, as the Superfice hath a greater or
le&s;&s;er <HI>refracting</HI> Power, for in the confine
of <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Sal-Gem</HI> 'tis &s;tronger than in the
<PB N="86" REF="119">
confine of <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> and &s;till &s;tronger
in the confine of <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>common Gla&s;s</HI> or
<HI>Cry&s;tal,</HI> and &s;tronger in the confine of <HI>Air</HI>
and <HI>Diamond.</HI> Between the Parts of opake
and colour'd Bodies, there are many Spa|ces
either empty or repleni&s;h'd with <HI>Me|diums</HI>
of other Den&s;ities, as Water between
the tinging Particles wherewith any Li|quor
is impregnated, Air between the <HI>aque|ous
Globules,</HI> that con&s;titute Clouds or Mi&s;ts,
and perhaps, <HI>Mediums</HI> different from both
the&s;e between the Parts of hard Bodies.
Now <HI>Reflexions</HI> are produc'd in the <HI>Su|perficies</HI>
which intercede the&s;e <HI>Mediums</HI> of
different Den&s;ities, and the Rea&s;on why
uniform, pellucid <HI>Mediums</HI> have no &s;en&s;ible
Reflexion, but at their external <HI>Superficies,</HI>
is becau&s;e all their Parts are of an equal
Den&s;ity; and Opacity ari&s;es from the mul|titude
of <HI>Reflections</HI> produc'd in the internal
Parts of Bodies.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. All Bodies &s;eem to have their
<HI>refractive</HI> Powers <HI>proportional</HI> to their Den|&s;ities,
excepting &s;o far as they partake more
or le&s;s of &s;ulphurous, oily Particles, and
<PB N="87" REF="120">
thereby have their refractive Power made
more or le&s;s; this Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has found
by Ob&s;ervation on almo&s;t all tran&s;parent
Bodies, together with a Calculation founded
upon the Suppo&s;ition, that Light is &s;wifter
in Bodies than <HI>in vacuo,</HI> in the Proportion
of the <HI>Signs</HI> which mea&s;ure the <HI>Refraction</HI> of
Bodies, which is certainly true, &s;ince it's
from the Action of Bodies on Light, that
this <HI>refractive</HI> Power does ari&s;e; and it's
very probable, that this <HI>refractive</HI> Power
in Bodies does mo&s;tly depend upon the
&s;ulphurous Parts with which they abound,
&s;ince all Bodies partake more or le&s;s of Sul|phurs,
as by Chymical <HI>Analy&s;es</HI> we find.
And as Light congregated by a Burning-Gla&s;s,
acts mo&s;t upon &s;ulphurous Bodies,
to turn them into Fire and Flame; &s;o &s;ince
all Action is mutual, Sulphurs act mo&s;t
upon Light: and that the Action between
Light and Bodies is mutual, is evident from
this Con&s;ideration, that the den&s;e&s;t Bodies
which <HI>refract</HI> and <HI>reflect</HI> Light mo&s;t &s;trong|ly,
grow hotte&s;t in the Summer Heat, by
the Action of the <HI>refracted</HI> and <HI>reflected</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="121">
Light. The Bodies that reflect Light, are
tho&s;e who&s;e Pores are fill'd with <HI>Mediums</HI>
of an unequal Den&s;ity with that of the <HI>re|fracting
Medium</HI> it&s;elf, and Bodies become
more tran&s;parent, by filling their Pores
with Fluids of equal, or almo&s;t equal Den|&s;ities
with their Parts, as Paper dip'd in
Water or Oyl; and on the contrary, the
mo&s;t tran&s;parent Sub&s;tances may by eva|cuating
their Pores, or &s;eparating their Parts,
be rendered &s;ufficiently opake, as Salts or
wet Paper dried, Gla&s;s by being pulve|ris'd,
or Horn by being &s;crap'd.</P>
<P>XLII. The <HI>lea&s;t Parts</HI> of almo&s;t all
Natural Bodies are tran&s;parent, as may
be &s;een by viewing &s;mall Bodies with a
<HI>Micro&s;cope,</HI> and con&s;equently, they mu&s;t
according to their &s;everal Sizes, reflect Rays
of one Colour, and tran&s;mit tho&s;e of a|nother,
upon the &s;ame Ground that thin
Plates reflect or tran&s;mit tho&s;e Rays; for
a thin Plate of an even thickne&s;s appears
all over of the &s;ame Colour, and if this
Plate were &s;lit into <HI>Threads,</HI> or broken
into <HI>Fragments</HI> of the &s;ame thickne&s;s with
<PB N="89" REF="122">
the Plate, there is no Rea&s;on why every
<HI>Thread</HI> or <HI>Fragment</HI> &s;hould not keep its Co|lour,
and con&s;equently, why a heap of
tho&s;e <HI>Threads</HI> or <HI>Fragments</HI> &s;hould not con|&s;titute
a Ma&s;s or Powder of the &s;ame Co|lour
which the Plate exhibited before it
was broken; and the &s;mall Parts of all Na|tural
Bodies being like &s;o many <HI>Fragments</HI>
of a Plate, mu&s;t on the &s;ame Grounds ex|hibit
their Colours. Now Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>
found by Ob&s;ervation, that thin Plates or
Bubbles <HI>reflected</HI> Rays of one Colour and
<HI>tra&s;mitted</HI> tho&s;e of another, according to
their &s;everal thickne&s;s or thinne&s;s; and there|fore
the &s;mall Parts of Natural Bodies be|ing
tran&s;parent, mu&s;t upon the &s;ame
Grounds <HI>reflect</HI> or <HI>tran&s;mit</HI> the &s;everal &s;orts
of Rays: and this is the Foundation of the
various Colours of all Natural Bodies. But
the parts of Bodies on which their Colours
depend, mu&s;t be den&s;er than the <HI>Medium,</HI>
which pervades their Inter&s;tices; and as
there is a con&s;tant Relation between Co|lours
and <HI>Refrangibility,</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>Refran|gible</HI>
Rays being <HI>Violet,</HI> the lea&s;t <HI>refrangible
<PB N="90" REF="123">
Red,</HI> and tho&s;e of intermediate Colours ha|ving
proportionally intermediate Degrees
of <HI>Refrangibility;</HI> &s;o there is a con&s;tant Re|lation
between Colour and <HI>Reflexibility,</HI> the
<HI>Violet</HI> being in like Circum&s;tances reflected,
at lea&s;t thickne&s;&s;es of any Plate or Bubble,
the Red at greate&s;t thickne&s;&s;es, and the inter|mediate
Colours at intermediate thickne&s;&s;es;
and there are &s;everal Orders of tho&s;e Co|lours
more or le&s;s inten&s;e and vivid, ac|cording
to the &s;everal thickne&s;&s;es of the&s;e
Plates or Bubbles: and the Rea&s;on why the
Surfaces of all thick and tran&s;parent Bo|dies
reflect part of the Light incident on
them, and refract or tran&s;mit the re&s;t, is,
that &s;ome Rays at their <HI>Incidence</HI> are in <HI>Fits</HI>
of ea&s;ie <HI>Reflection,</HI> and others in <HI>Fits</HI> of
ea&s;ie <HI>Tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</HI> Tho&s;e who&s;e who de|&s;ire
full Satisfaction in this wonderful Ap|pearance
of Nature, mu&s;t go to that late
admirable Treati&s;e of <HI>Opticks,</HI> written by
Mr. <HI>Newton;</HI> for it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate
the Parts of this Work from one another
without Di&s;advantage to them,, or to &s;um
them up in a le&s;s room, without lo&s;ing &s;ome|thing
<PB N="91" REF="124">
<HI>New</HI> and <HI>U&s;eful.</HI> That great Per&s;on
having before &s;hown how far <HI>Numbers</HI> and
<HI>Geometry</HI> would go in. <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI>
has now manife&s;ted to the World to what
&s;urprizing Heights, even vulgar <HI>Experi|ments</HI>
duly managed and carefully examin|ed
in &s;uch Hands may advance it. In the
general, I think we may &s;afely conclude
from Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>'s Di&s;coveries, 1. That
the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars</HI> are but <HI>Planets</HI> or
<HI>Earths</HI> vehemently heated, or having their
&s;malle&s;t Parts put in a &s;trong <HI>vibrating</HI> Mo|tion.
2. That Light is emitted from them,
by the&s;e powerful <HI>Vibrations</HI> of their &s;mall|e&s;t
Parts. 3. That this Fluid of Light e|mitted
from the&s;e <HI>vibrating</HI> luminous Bo|dies
requires a certain time in pa&s;&s;ing from
them to us, and moves after the &s;ame man|ner
other Fluids do, only with a much
greater Velocity. 4. That Bodies draw
this Light to 'em in Lines <HI>perpendicular</HI> to
their Surfaces, and that this Light puts the
parts of the&s;e Bodies in a <HI>vibrating</HI> Mo|tion
wherein Heats con&s;i&s;t. 5. That the
Motion of Light is &s;wifter in Bodies than
<PB N="92" REF="125">
<HI>in vacuo,</HI> by rea&s;on of this Attraction, and
and &s;lower after its being <HI>reflected,</HI> than in
its <HI>Incidence,</HI> becau&s;e that Force of Attra|ction
which accelerates its Motion in its
<HI>Incidence,</HI> mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity retard its Mo|tion
in its <HI>Reflexion,</HI> by rea&s;on of the diffe|rent
Direction thereof. 6. That the Ray
in its whole Cour&s;e of <HI>Reflexion</HI> and <HI>In|cidence</HI>
de&s;cribes a <HI>Curve,</HI> or is rather bend|ed
than broken. 7. That the <HI>Vibration</HI>
of the &s;maller Parts of Bodies produc'd
by the Action of Light, when brought
to a certain Degree of Strength, is the
Cau&s;e of their Light, ju&s;t as we &s;ee the
<HI>Vibrations</HI> produc'd in the Air by tremu|lous
and &s;onorous Bodies, mu&s;t be of
&s;uch a determin'd Force to produce a di|&s;tinct
Sound. 8. That the&s;e <HI>Vibrations</HI>
produc'd in Bodies by the Action of
Light, when their Motion con&s;pires with
that of the Rays of Light, <HI>i. e.</HI> when
any Ray is in that part of the&s;e <HI>Vibrations</HI>
that has the &s;ame Direction with that of
the Ray, it ea&s;ily breaks through a <HI>re|fracting</HI>
Sub&s;tance, but when it is in the
<PB N="93" REF="126">
contrary part of the <HI>Vibration,</HI> which im|pedes
its Motion, it is ea&s;ily reflected, and
&s;o every Ray is di&s;pos'd <HI>alternately</HI> to be
ea&s;ily <HI>reflected</HI> or ea&s;ily <HI>tran&s;mitted.</HI> 9. That
the Rays of Light are of their own Na|ture
diver&s;ly <HI>Refrangible</HI> and <HI>Reflexible,</HI> and
that this diver&s;ity in both ari&s;es from the
&s;ame Principle, acting differently in dif|ferent
Circum&s;tances, <HI>viz.</HI> the Action of
Bodies upon Light. 10. That <HI>Reflexion</HI>
is caus'd by the different Den&s;ities of Bo|dies,
and happens only in <HI>Superficies</HI> that
intercede <HI>Mediums</HI> of different Den&s;ities.
11. That Light is totally tran&s;mitted
through <HI>Mediums</HI> only that are of the &s;ame
uniform Den&s;ity, and that the <HI>refractive</HI>
Power of Bodies is principally owing to
the Sulphurs with which they abound;
for &s;ince all Action is mutual, and &s;ince
Light congregated by a Burning-Gla&s;s acts
mo&s;t upon Sulphurs, &s;o Sulphurs ought to
act mo&s;t upon Light. 12. That the For|ces
of Bodies to <HI>reflect</HI> or <HI>refract</HI> Light
are very nearly proportional to the Den|&s;ities
of the &s;ame Bodies. 13. That cer|tain
<PB N="94" REF="127">
Colours are ty'd to &s;uch Degrees of
<HI>Refrangibility</HI> or <HI>Reflexibility,</HI> and that all
the <HI>primitive</HI> and <HI>original</HI> Colours depend
upon the&s;e Degrees. 14. That <HI>White</HI> con|&s;i&s;ts
in an equal Mixture of all the <HI>primi|tive</HI>
Colours, and <HI>Black</HI> in a Suffocation
of all the Rays of Light, which is the
Rea&s;on why <HI>Blacks</HI> burn more ea&s;ily
than other Colours; and other not <HI>primi|tive</HI>
Colours ari&s;e from a certain Mixture
of the&s;e. 15. That the Colours of Na|tural
Bodies depend upon the different
Den&s;ity of their &s;mall Parts, and thereby
their fitne&s;s to reflect Light of one Co|lour
and tran&s;mit that of others. 16. That
&s;everal &s;orts of Rays make <HI>Vibrations</HI> of &s;eve|ral
bigne&s;&s;es, which according to their big|ne&s;&s;es
excite Sen&s;ations of &s;everal Colours
much after the &s;ame manner, that the <HI>Vibra|tions</HI>
of the Air according to their &s;everal big|ne&s;&s;es
excite Sen&s;ations of &s;everal Sounds.
17. That the <HI>Harmony</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> of Co|lours
ari&s;e from the Proportions of the <HI>Vi|bration</HI>
propagated through the Fibres of the
Optick Nerves into the Brain, as the <HI>Har|mony</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="128">
and <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> of Sounds ari&s;es from the
Proportions of the <HI>Vibrations</HI> of the Air.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Corollary.</HEAD>
<P>From what has been &s;aid of the Nature
of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and its <HI>Light,</HI> it is evident that
the Quantity of Heat and Light in the <HI>Sun</HI>
does daily decrea&s;e; like other vehemently
hot Bodies it mu&s;t gradually cool; as al&s;o,
by its <HI>Emi&s;&s;ion</HI> of &s;o many Millions of Rays
perpetually, quite round its Body upon all
the <HI>Planets</HI> within its Sy&s;tem, which do not
return, both its Bulk and Heat mu&s;t be di|mini&s;hed.
It is not improbable that all the
virtual Heat in the juices of Vegetables,
Metals and Minerals, may be owing to the
impri&s;oned Rays in 'em; the Production of
Animals in the ordinary way, require sa cer|tain
Degree of Warmth, which proceeds
from his Influence. SomeBodies do &s;tifle and
&s;uffocate the Rays of Light, &s;o as that they
are never, or not duly reflected again. Sul|phurous
Bodies form little Cells by the
Action of the Rays of Heat and Light to
<PB N="96" REF="129">
retain 'em, and from the Ingenious Expe|riment
of the <HI>accurate</HI> and <HI>learn'd</HI> Mr. <HI>John
Bernoulli,</HI> we are inform'd, that our <HI>Atmo|&s;phere</HI>
and all the Bodies on our Globe are
<HI>&s;aturated</HI> at all times with Rays of Light
which never return again to their Fountain,
becau&s;e as has been &s;hown in the former Se|ctions,
Bodies do attract, and con&s;equently
retain the&s;e Rays. I &s;hall here &s;et down
one of the Ways (for he try'd the &s;ame Ex|periment
after different manners) the Inge|nious
Author pre&s;cribes, which by my Or|der
was repeated here at <HI>London.</HI> They are
related in the 2d. Volume of Mr. <HI>Fontanelle</HI>'s
<HI>Memoirs of the Academie Royalle for the Year</HI>
1700. We &s;uck'd thro' a very clean Tube
of about 30 Inches in Length, open at
both ends, very well clean&s;ed <HI>Mercury,</HI> till
it came to the top, then nimbly &s;triking off
the upper Surface of the <HI>Mercury,</HI> which had
been &s;oil'd by the Air, and hindred the
Effect in former Tryals, we nicely and
quickly clos'd the upper end with a proper
Cement &s;o that no Air cou'd get in, then &s;u|&s;pending
the Tube that the <HI>Mercury</HI> might
<PB N="97" REF="130">
&s;ub&s;ide, and darkening the Room that no
Light could get in, we perceiv'd that at,
every <HI>Vibration,</HI> Fla&s;hes of Light appear'd in
the Vacuity at the upper End, which en|lighten'd
all the Room, which as Mr. <HI>Ber|noulli</HI>
rea&s;ons, happen'd thus; that Film of
Dirt, wherewith the Air &s;oils the upper
Surface of the <HI>Mercury,</HI> and which hinders
the Pa&s;&s;age of the Particles of Light in or|dinary
<HI>Barometers,</HI> being remov'd; in the
<HI>Vibrations</HI> of the Tube, the <HI>Mercury</HI> a&s;cend|ing
in its oblique Situation, &s;ub&s;ides again
in its <HI>Perpendicular</HI> one, and thereby leaves
behind it a Vacuity, to fill which, the Par|ticles
of <HI>Light,</HI> being the only Body that
can get in, ru&s;hes in, from the <HI>Mercury</HI>
and through the Gla&s;s, in great Quantities,
and &s;o produces the&s;e Fla&s;hes; which &s;hows
that the Sub&s;tance of <HI>Light,</HI> is &s;cattered
every where, though it be not vi&s;ible.
Now &s;ince it's certain, that Bodies do attract,
the Rays of <HI>Light,</HI> and do retain 'em &s;o,
that they can never return to the Fountain
of <HI>Light</HI> again; it's plain, the Quantity
of <HI>Light</HI> both in this <HI>Bright Luminary,</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="131">
and in the <HI>Sun-like fixt Stars</HI> mu&s;t be
continually decrea&s;ing: However, it's al&s;o
certain, that this Decrea&s;e is very incon&s;i|derable
in any &s;hort time, though we are
&s;ure there is &s;ome, and our not being &s;en|&s;ible
of this Decrea&s;e, is only an Argu|ment
of the exceeding Smalne&s;s of the
Particles of <HI>Light.</HI> We find &s;ome <HI>odorife|rous</HI>
Bodies, &s;end out Steams for many
Years, without &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hing either
their Bulk or Weight, which argues the
Smalne&s;s of the Parts of the&s;e Steams. But
the Particles of <HI>Light</HI> mu&s;t be extremely
&s;mall, &s;ince the <HI>Sun</HI> for &s;o many Ages has
been con&s;tantly emitting <HI>Oceans</HI> of Rays,
without any &s;en&s;ible Diminution: But this
can &s;urpri&s;e no Body, who con&s;iders that
Matter is infinitely divi&s;ible; for it is po&s;|&s;ible
to a&s;&s;ign in Numbers, a Quantity,
whereof a Body as big as the <HI>Sun</HI> may
con&s;tantly, for any finite Number of Years
emit <HI>Oceans,</HI> and yet the Sum of 'em all,
may not be greater than a cubical Inch,
or even a Grain of Sand.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="132">
&sect; XLIII. We have already ob&s;erv'd,
that the mo&s;t general Condition, of the
<HI>Univer&s;al Law</HI> of Gravitation in Bodies, was,
that at the &s;ame Di&s;tance from the Center
of the attracting Force, Bodies did gravi|tate
in proportion to their Solidity, and at
different Di&s;tances, <HI>reciprocally</HI> as the Squares
of tho&s;e Di&s;tances; but this Condition is
not &s;o general, as altogether to exclude
others; the way to know how this <HI>Uni|ver&s;al
Law</HI> is diver&s;ify'd, in the different
Bodies, is to ob&s;erve what Lines, Bodies
in their Motions or Actions upon one ano|ther
de&s;cribe, or what the Effects of the&s;e
Motions and Actions are; and then to in|ve&s;tigate
what Conditions of the <HI>Univer|sal
Law</HI> of Gravitation, will make Bodies
de&s;cribe the&s;e Lines, or produce the&s;e Ef|fects.
Thus if any of the <HI>Primary</HI> or <HI>Se|condary
Planets,</HI> did de&s;cribe perfect Circles
or <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI> about the <HI>Sun,</HI> or a <HI>Primary
Planet</HI> plac'd in the Center, the Condi|tion
of the <HI>Univer&s;al Law</HI> in the&s;e, would
be, that the <HI>attractive Force</HI> at different Di|&s;tances
from the Center, would be as the&s;e
<PB N="100" REF="133">
Di&s;tances directly. If they de&s;cribed a
<HI>Parabola,</HI> by &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>attractive Force</HI>
at an infinite Di&s;tance, or an <HI>Hyperbola,</HI> by
changing the <HI>Centripetal</HI> into a <HI>Centrifugal
Force;</HI> then the Condition of the <HI>Univer&s;al
Law</HI> wou'd be, that the Force were al|ways
<HI>equable</HI> and the &s;ame at all Di&s;tances,
as Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demon&s;trated, <HI>Prop.</HI> 11.
<HI>Lib. I.</HI> We find, as has been in&s;inuated in
the preceding Sections, That the Rays of
<HI>Light</HI> in pa&s;&s;ing through different <HI>Media,</HI>
do tend <HI>perpendicularly,</HI> to either the Plane
of <HI>Incidence</HI> or <HI>Reflexion,</HI> &s;o that the Force
of Attraction is always the &s;ame, at equal
Di&s;tances from the &s;ame Plane. We &s;ee
that the Parts of <HI>Air,</HI> &s;hun or fly from one
another, in&s;tead of tending to one another;
&s;o that in accounting for the Appearances
of Nature from the <HI>Univer&s;al Law</HI> of Gra|vitation,
we are not ty'd to one &s;ingle Con|dition,
but may have recour&s;e to others as
the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity, of the Appearan|ces
&s;eem to require; for the whole Diffi|culty

from the Appearances of the Motions given,
and then from the&s;e Powers to account for
all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. The obvious Appearances of
<HI>cohering</HI> Bodies are thus, two very &s;mooth
well poli&s;h'd, plain Bodies, put together,
will firmly cohere even in an exhau&s;ted
Receiver, which &s;hows evidently that their
<HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> is owing, neither to the Gravity, nor
to any other Property of the Air; all &s;a|line,
cry&s;talline, and mo&s;t mineral Bodies,
break in very &s;mooth and plain, or at lea&s;t
<HI>congruent</HI> Surfaces; and univer&s;ally almo&s;t
all hard and very compact Bodies, break
with Surfaces, which immediately upon
the Separation, appear whiti&s;h, which is
an Evidence, that though the Surfaces be
very &s;mall, yet they are very &s;mooth and
poli&s;h'd, for only innumerable little po|li&s;h'd
Surfaces, are fit to reflect plentifully
all kinds of Rays, whereby white Co|lours
are produc'd. Now the&s;e Appearan|ces
of <HI>cohering</HI> Bodies, do naturally lead us
to imagine, that one nece&s;&s;ary Condition
toward <HI>Cohe&s;ion,</HI> is the plainne&s;s, or at lea&s;t
<PB N="102" REF="135">
<HI>Congruity</HI> of <HI>cohering</HI> Surfaces, and this
&s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to exclude any Fluid from
lying between <HI>cohering</HI> Bodies, for the&s;e
Bodies cannot be &s;aid to <HI>cohere,</HI> or be con|tinued,
betwixt who&s;e <HI>cohering</HI> Surfaces, in
all its Points a Fluid may in&s;inuate it&s;elf.
The plainne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s of the <HI>cohe|ring</HI>
Surfaces, will make more Points come
into <HI>Contact,</HI> than when they are rough
and irregular. For whatever Cau&s;e <HI>Cohe|&s;ion</HI>
ari&s;es from, if we &s;uppo&s;e that Cau&s;e
to act mo&s;t &s;trongly at the <HI>Contact,</HI> the
more Points of the <HI>cohering</HI> Bodies come
into <HI>Contact,</HI> the firmer the <HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> will
be; and though exact Congruity in <HI>Curve</HI>
Surfaces, will bring as many Points into
<HI>Contact,</HI> as plain Surfaces will, yet <HI>Curvity</HI>
not being the &s;imple&s;t, nor mo&s;t expedi|tious
Method of producing this Effect, nei|ther
agreeable to Nature, (who always
brings about all her Effects the &s;horte&s;t
and ea&s;ie&s;t way) it &s;eems evident, that
the plainne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s of Surfaces, is
one Condition of <HI>Cohe&s;ion,</HI> and that tho&s;e
<HI>Atoms</HI> that are terminated with plain Sur|faces
<PB N="103" REF="136">
will (<HI>caeteris paribus</HI>) produce Bodies
of the firme&s;t <HI>Cohe&s;ion.</HI> This will appear
more evident from the contrary Quality in
the con&s;tituent Particles of Fluids. For we
have &s;hown before, that one nece&s;&s;ary
Condition of <HI>Fluidity,</HI> is the <HI>Curvity</HI> of the
Surfaces, of the con&s;tituent Particles of
Fluids, whereby their <HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> is very &s;mall,
in re&s;pect of the <HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> of tho&s;e Particles
that are terminated with plain Surfaces, and
their Gravity always exceeds the Force of
their <HI>Cohe&s;ion,</HI> &s;o that from both the&s;e
Cau&s;es, they ea&s;ily &s;lip and move one upon
another. We may then &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome
of the <HI>Primary Atoms,</HI> of which Bodies are
con&s;tituted, are terminated with plain Sur|faces
on all &s;ides, which will produce Bo|dies
of the firme&s;t <HI>Cohe&s;ion,</HI> others again are in|tirely
terminated with <HI>curve</HI> Surfaces, which
will produce Fluids, and between tho&s;e in|tirely
plain, and entirely <HI>curve,</HI> there are
infinite <HI>Combinations,</HI> of plain and <HI>curve</HI> Sur|faces
<PB N="104" REF="137">
which will account for all the vari|ous
Degrees of <HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> in Bodies, in re&s;pect
of their Figures. But though this &s;mooth|ne&s;s
and plainne&s;s, in the Surfaces of <HI>cohering</HI>
Bodies, will bring mo&s;t Points into <HI>Contact,</HI>
yet this will not hinder them from being
&s;eparated, by any Force how &s;mall &s;oever;
and &s;ince we are certain, that <HI>cohering</HI> Bo|dies
require a determin'd Force, to &s;eparate
them, there wants &s;till a <HI>Cement,</HI> as it were,
to hinder them from being ea&s;ily &s;eparated
when join'd. Now this can be deriv'd
from nothing in Nature, but that <HI>Univer|&s;al
Law</HI> of Attraction, whereby all the
Parts of Matter, endeavour to <HI>embrace</HI> one
another, and cannot be &s;eparated but by
a Force &s;uperiour, to that by which they

cannot obtain in the <HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> of Bodies; for

is &s;o &s;mall, as does not an&s;wer the <HI>Appear|ances;</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="145">

than the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the con&s;tituent Parti|cles
<PB N="113" REF="146">
of the&s;e Fluids, and &s;o by their lateral
pre&s;&s;ures, de&s;troy the efficacy of the Force

only the <HI>Convex</HI> &s;ides, are turn'd in
towards their <HI>Centers;</HI> the matter being thus,
let us &s;uppo&s;e, that two very &s;mooth and
plain &s;quare Surfaces, are join'd together,
&s;o that each Particle in the&s;e Planes, attracts
another, by &s;ome one or other of the Con|ditions
of the <HI>General Law of Attraction,</HI> if
the&s;e Planes, by any external Force, were &s;o
&s;eparated, as to move upon a common &s;ide
of the Congruent &s;quares as an <HI>Axis,</HI> and that
no forein Fluid endow'd with a disjoining
Force (&s;uch as <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> are) cou'd in|terpo&s;e,
to hinder their Action: it is cer|tain&punc;
that the external Force which thus &s;e|parated
the&s;e Planes, cea&s;ing to act, the <HI>At|tractive</HI>
Force wou'd immediately bring
the&s;e Planes together again, and if the&s;e
Planes were &s;eparated by a <HI>parallel</HI> Motion,
if the Di&s;tance were &s;o &s;mall, that no forein
<PB N="116" REF="149">
Fluid could get in to hinder their Action,
if the <HI>&s;eparating</HI> Force ceas'd, the <HI>attracting</HI>
Force would act and bring 'em together a|gain;
and in both Ca&s;es, with a Force
which may be ea&s;ily gathered from the
Condition of the Law of <HI>Attraction,</HI> and
the Di&s;tance of the&s;e Planes being given.
Now all <HI>Ela&s;tick</HI> Bodies in their Actions
upon one another, changing their Figures,
mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have &s;ome of their Parts
in the&s;e Actions, &s;eparated by a <HI>parallel</HI> or
a circular Motion about an <HI>Axis;</HI> or by a
Motion after &s;ome manner compounded of
both the&s;e, (for it is no matter after what
manner they are disjoin'd, provided they be
not &s;eparated, &s;o far, as to admit any forein
Fluid to enter, which may de&s;troy the effi|cacy
of the Force, whereby the&s;e Particles
<HI>attract</HI> one another.) If we then &s;uppo&s;e,
the Surfaces of the Parts of <HI>Ela&s;tick</HI> Bodies,
plain and &s;mooth, and that they <HI>attract</HI> one
another after &s;ome one or other Condition

<P>&sect; I. IT is a little &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee Men
&s;ometimes contending and wran|gling
about the <HI>Origin</HI> of their
&s;everal Families, and yet &s;carce any Bo|dy
give Him&s;elf the trouble once &s;eri|ou&s;ly
to con&s;ider or enquire how Man at
fir&s;t became to <HI>be,</HI> whether he &s;prang from
the <HI>Earth</HI> or dropt from the <HI>Clouds,</HI>
when he began, or if ever there was a
<PB N="2" REF="153">
time when he was not; tho' the&s;e Enqui|ries
be far more worthy a wi&s;e Man's pains
than tho&s;e in&s;ignificant Conte&s;ts. We are
ea&s;ily &s;atisfy'd we and our own immedi|ate
Parents have not been for ever; but
few of us go farther, we take this World
as we find it, without troubling our Heads
<HI>who made it,</HI> or whether it was <HI>made</HI> or
not. No Body can well bear to have
their <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> affronted, no$ their <HI>Pedi|gree</HI>
de&s;pi&s;ed; and yet very many now a
days don't &s;cruple. to own them&s;elves
the <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> or the Off|&s;pring
of <HI>blind Fate and Chance.</HI> Whate|ver
others may do, I &s;hall not think my
Pains ill be&s;tow'd once in my Life to have
examin'd how this pre&s;ent &s;tate of things
became at fir&s;t to <HI>be.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; II. There are three general Opini|ons
about this matter, the fir&s;t is of tho&s;e
of the Epicurean Sect, that holds that an
<HI>immen&s;e Void,</HI> and an Infinity of different|ly
figur'd, very &s;mall, extreamly; hard and
infrangible <HI>Particles of Matter</HI> have for
<HI>ever been;</HI> and that the&s;e Particles mo|ving
<PB N="3" REF="154">
of 'em&s;elves in a direction oblique
to one another, after innumerable <HI>ren|counters,</HI>
did at la&s;t &s;ettle in this <HI>beautiful
Order of things</HI> we now behold. This is
the <HI>Scheme</HI> upon which &s;ome build their
<HI>Hopes,</HI> and upon the account of which
&s;ome of our <HI>Moderns</HI> think 'em&s;elves &s;ub|til
<HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> how ju&s;tly we &s;hall now
examine.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Fir&s;t this <HI>Scheme</HI> &s;uppo&s;es Mat|ter
to have forever been of it&s;elf, with|out
any Cau&s;e; which is a very liberal
Compliment to &s;uch an unactive inani|mate
Ma&s;s, to make it independent for
its Being and uncapable of being de&s;troy|ed
(both which <HI>Self-exi&s;tence</HI> nece&s;&s;arily
implies) 'tis to rai&s;e it to a very high pitch
of Dignity, to which we find none of its
other qualities an&s;werable. <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Space</HI>
it's true may have for ever been; but that
is becau&s;e they may have &s;ome relation
to a Being endow'd with all other &s;uitable
qualities; but Matter &s;eems to be too igno|ble
a Being to arrogate &s;uch high <HI>Endom|ments.</HI>
But pa&s;s we over this Head, as
<PB N="4" REF="155">
not e&s;&s;ential to the Bu&s;ine&s;s in Hand.
And,</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Let us con&s;ider how out of
the&s;e few <HI>Principles</HI> of an <HI>immen&s;e Void,</HI>
an infinity of very &s;mall, hard, and in|frangible
<HI>Particles,</HI> and their <HI>oblique Dire|ction</HI>
to one another, it is po&s;&s;ible to form
this pre&s;ent &s;tate of things. We have
have prov'd &sect; XI. of the preceding Chap|ter,
that <HI>Motion</HI> is no more <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to
Matter than Re&s;t, that of it &s;elf it can
never bring it &s;elf into Motion, that it
wou'd for ever continue in the &s;tate it is
put in, and, if it was from all Eternity
at re&s;t, it would continue &s;o for ever;
if in Motion, it wou'd for ever move on.
But I'd gladly know whence this motion
did proceed, &s;ince it is &s;uppos'd there is
nothing be&s;ide unactive Matter it &s;elf to
produce it. Whatever can be &s;uppos'd to
put Matter in Motion, may at the &s;ame
time, and with the &s;ame ea&s;e, be &s;uppo|&s;ed
to have directed the &s;everal parts
thereof to the Places they are now in, <HI>i. e.</HI>
to have produc'd this <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate of things.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="156">
No Body can think Motion <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to
Matter, who &s;ees any part thereof at re&s;t;
for what is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to any thing, that
thing can never be without it. But &s;ome
<HI>Philo&s;ophers,</HI> and tho&s;e of great Name too,
have a&s;&s;erted that no part of Matter ever
was nor can be at ab&s;olute re&s;t. For, &s;ay
they, Motion is a Quantity, and may be
divided <HI>in infinitum</HI> as well as other Quan|tities,
and a Body may be moving any fi|nite
time, and yet never &s;en&s;ibly change
its <HI>relative</HI> Place; for the &s;pace is as the
Velocity, and if the Velocity be very
&s;mall, the &s;pace it moves through is &s;o
likewi&s;e: And that tho&s;e Bodies which
&s;eem to be at re&s;t, are only alternately
moving very &s;lowly to and from the <HI>ter|mination</HI>
of the Motion, or the <HI>Ob&s;tacle.</HI>
To this I an&s;wer, that tho' it may be ve|ry
true, that nothing, in this Univer&s;e is
actually at <HI>ab&s;olute re&s;t,</HI> but that every thing
is in &s;ome degree of Motion; yet that ab|&s;olute
Re&s;t in Bodies is not impo&s;&s;ible, is
clear from hence, that it implies no con|tradiction,
a Sphere in a vacuity &s;hou'd
<PB N="6" REF="157">
be pre&s;s'd by two other equal Spheres with
equal Forces and contrary Directions; from
which pre&s;&s;ure the intermediate Sphere
wou'd be at <HI>ab&s;olute Re&s;t;</HI> wherefore if it
is not ab&s;urd a Body &s;hou'd be at <HI>ab&s;olute
Re&s;t,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible Motion &s;hou'd be
<HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to Matter. There is another Argu|ment
which to me &s;eems very conclu&s;ive
again&s;t Motions being <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to Matter,
and that is from the infinite po&s;&s;ible Varie|ties
of its Directions; laying a&s;ide the con|&s;ideration
of all other Bodies; or, &s;uppo|&s;ing
a Body moving <HI>in vacuo,</HI> it mu&s;t move
in one certain <HI>Direction.</HI> Now what is it
that determines it to this <HI>Direction</HI> rather
than to any other of the infinite Variety;
no Rea&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;&s;ign'd why it
&s;hou'd move rather in this than in any
other of the infinite number of Directions.
And it cannot po&s;&s;ibly move in more than
one of 'em at once, and therefore it will
of it&s;elf move in none of 'em, <HI>i. e.</HI> it will
not of it &s;elf move at all, and con&s;equent|ly
Motion is not <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to Matter. For
in the faculties of natural things which are
<PB N="7" REF="158">
not endow'd with Free-will, where there
is an infinite variety of Choice, and no
po&s;&s;ible Rea&s;on to determine any one way,
there can be no Choice made at all. From
all which it is plain, that allowing the
<HI>Abe$tors</HI> of this <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> their <HI>Void</HI> and
their <HI>Atoms,</HI> yet nothing cou'd be produc'd
for want of Motion, it not being <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI>
to Matter, as has been prov'd, and there
being nothing el&s;e to produce it.</P>
<P>&sect; V. But allowing Matter to be <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent</HI>
and <HI>&s;elf-moving,</HI> I wou'd know
whence came this <HI>obliquity</HI> of <HI>Direction,</HI>
this is to a&s;cribe Will and Choice to the&s;e
Particles, and to alledge that they are ca|pable
of re&s;olving what way they will go.
The Contrivers of this <HI>Scheme</HI> &s;aw wi&s;ely
enough, that granting the&s;e <HI>Atoms</HI> to be
<HI>&s;elf-moving,</HI> yet nothing wou'd follow but
an eternal wandering in Lines <HI>parallel</HI> to
one another, without any other effect;
and therefore they added, that the&s;e Parti|cles
moved with different <HI>oblique Di|rections</HI>
to one another; by which means
they wou'd meet and ju&s;tle and reflect, in
<PB N="8" REF="159">
innumerable different ways. But does not
every Body &s;ee that it is as ea&s;ie and as
intelligible to &s;uppo&s;e this World already
in Being, as to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Particles
endow'd with this <HI>obliquely</HI> directed Mo|tion,
the Cau&s;e of the one being no le&s;s
accountable from their Principles than the
other. We &s;ee all Motions now perform'd
in the &s;ame direction with that, of the mo|ving
Force, and all Motions produc'd by
the &s;ame <HI>adequat Cau&s;e</HI> have the &s;ame <HI>Di|rections;</HI>
and con&s;equently, if the Mo|tion
of the&s;e Atoms ari&s;es from 'em&s;elves,
they mu&s;t all follow the &s;ame <HI>Directions,
i. e.</HI> they mu&s;t all move in <HI>parallel</HI> Lines;
and con&s;equently they cou'd never meet
in order to produce any regular Effect.
We do not find that Matter or Bodies
now can alter their Directions, and yet
according to the Opinion of the&s;e Men
for infinite Ages by-pa&s;t, they have mov'd
as they li&s;ted. Why do they not &s;o &s;till?
Since (according to their own &s;uppo&s;ition)
nothing has happen'd to alter their Na|ture,
or the manner of their Motions ever
<PB N="9" REF="160">
&s;ince; it is altogether unaccountable
why Matter &s;hou'd move in one <HI>Direction</HI>
rather than another, upon any other ac|count
but the <HI>Direction</HI> of the impre&s;s'd
Force, and all that's alleged on this Head
by the <HI>Favourers</HI> of this <HI>Scheme</HI> is altoge|ther
<HI>precarious.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; VI. But allowing the&s;e <HI>Atoms</HI> to be
<HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent, &s;elf-moving,</HI> and <HI>obliquely</HI> di|rected,
yet 'tis &s;till inconceivable how they
&s;hou'd produce a World. For the&s;e <HI>Atoms</HI>
cou'd not move all with the &s;ame degree
of Obliquity to one another, for that
wou'd be making 'em all <HI>converge</HI> to a
point, and &s;o nothing but one great &s;o|lid
Sphere cou'd be produc'd; if they hap|pen'd
to unite after their Meeting, and if
they again reflected from one another,
they wou'd produce a fluid Sphere, their
rectilinear Motions turning into circular
ones, or otherwi&s;e wander on in right
Lines as before: And to make &s;ome con|verge
to one point, others to another; is
to &s;ay the&s;e Atoms were intelligent free
Beings, which cou'd chu&s;e the cour&s;e they
<PB N="10" REF="161">
wou'd go in. We have a very powerful
Proof of the in&s;ufficiency of the&s;e, <HI>Atoms,</HI>
tho' endow'd with their <HI>obliquity</HI> of <HI>Dire|ction</HI>
to produce any thing, in the Rays
of the Sun, which as was before prov'd
are very &s;mall parts of Matter, by the inter|po&s;ition
of the &s;urfaces of reflecting Bodies
differently &s;ituated, obtaining all po&s;&s;ible
varieties of Obliquity; and yet the&s;e pro|duce
no regular <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> of Bodies, tho'
they move and probably ju&s;tle and inter|fere
all imaginable ways. As I have ju&s;t
now &s;aid, only tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>Directions</HI>
converge to a point, cou'd meet to pro|duce
any real Body, and ev'n the Body
which wou'd be produc'd wou'd only be
a <HI>&s;pherical</HI> one. So that out of all their
Motions, only <HI>Spheres</HI> of different Mag|nitudes
cou'd be form'd, which how &s;mall
a part this is of the infinite variety of
Bodies in this Univer&s;e, I leave the Rea|der
to confider. The truth of the mat|ter
is, if Bodies were <HI>&s;elf-moving,</HI> they
cou'd move what way they pleas'd, and
&s;top when and where they pleas'd, <HI>i. e.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="162">
they wou'd be free-will'd <HI>Elective</HI> Agents.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. Again, allowing the&s;e <HI>Atoms</HI>
to be <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent, &s;elf-moving</HI> and <HI>obliquely</HI>
directed, yet I wou'd gladly know how
from thence this <HI>&V;niver&s;e</HI> cou'd be fram'd.
It is not enough to &s;ay barely the&s;e <HI>Atoms</HI>
thus di&s;pos'd wou'd at la&s;t &s;ettle into this
&s;tate of things, unle&s;s it be &s;hewn by what
particular <HI>Motions, Directions</HI> and <HI>Refle|ctions,</HI>
the principal Bodies of this Uni|ver&s;e
were fram'd. To &s;hew a thing po&s;|&s;ible
to be done, we mu&s;t tell how, what
way, and by what Laws it may be done.
For unle&s;s we de&s;cend to Particulars, we
are never certain it can be &s;o; and 'tis as
probable (till the contrary be evinc'd, in
&s;ome Particulars at lea&s;t) it may not be
&s;o. <HI>Generals</HI> are always to be &s;u&s;pected,
a Contradiction may be di&s;covered in the
particular Explications of an Appearance
that was not taken notice of in the <HI>general
Scheme;</HI> as indeed it happens in every
individual In&s;tance of this pre&s;ent Subject
hitherto attempted. I &s;hall not ask of
tho&s;e who defend this <HI>Scheme,</HI> a particu|lar
<PB N="12" REF="163">
account of the <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> of every in|dividual
Appearance in our <HI>Sy&s;teme,</HI> for
that indeed were endle&s;s. But if any one
can tell by what Laws of Mechani&s;m, any
one Animal or Vegetable was produc'd,
or from what mechanick Principles the
Planets de&s;cribe <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits, I &s;hall
for the &s;ake of the&s;e allow their whole
<HI>Scheme</HI> to be true. We all know how
wretchedly <HI>Des Cartes</HI> (the able&s;t <HI>Patron</HI>
that ever this Opinion had) has blunder'd
on the&s;e Heads, and his Followers have
not mended the matter much. It is &s;ur|pri&s;ing
to think how any rea&s;onable Man
cou'd believe this <HI>&V;niver&s;e</HI> to have been
produc'd by Matter and Motion; when
as yet no Man that ever liv'd, from the&s;e
Principles alone, can tell by what <HI>Mecha|ni&s;m</HI>
the mo&s;t contemptible of the <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI>
or <HI>Terre&s;trial</HI> Bodies cou'd be produc'd;
and yet to be fully &s;atisfy'd of the truth
of this <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> a Man mu&s;t under&s;tand
the particular Mechani&s;m of the whole
<HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things, and of every individual
Appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="164">
&sect; VII. The&s;e <HI>Atoms</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>in|frangible,</HI>
extreamly compacted and hard
(as indeed the lea&s;t parts of Matter mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily be) which <HI>compactedne&s;s</HI> and
<HI>hardne&s;s</HI> is a demon&s;tration that nothing
cou'd be produc'd by 'em, &s;ince being &s;o
they cou'd never come to cohere, in or|der
to produce &s;olid Bodies. The only
tolerable account of <HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> in &s;uch like
Particles is from their branch'd Figure.
Now hard &s;olid Particles reflecting from
one another, can never po&s;&s;ibly lay hold
of one another, at lea&s;t not &s;o but that
the lea&s;t Motion will disjoin 'em again.
It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how innumera|ble
hard and compacted <HI>Atoms</HI> &s;wimming in
an immen&s;e <HI>Aby&s;s</HI> cou'd ever come to co|here
&s;o as to produce &s;uch hard Bodies
as <HI>Diamonds</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Mineral Sub|&s;tances</HI>
are, without any other cement but
their catching hold of one another; this
mutual embracing might keep 'em from
being ea&s;ily torn a&s;&s;under, but they wou'd
be &s;till movable like chain'd Work, and
cou'd never produce the appearance of
<PB N="14" REF="165">
Firmne&s;s and Solidity. And what is here
&s;aid of Cohe&s;ion and Solidity, may be like|wi&s;e
&s;hewn of Ela&s;ticity. And thus allow|ing
the&s;e <HI>Atoms</HI> to be <HI>Self-exi&s;tent, Self-moving,
obliquely</HI> directed, and to meet
according to any Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> yet
they cou'd only produce loo&s;e heaps of
<HI>Atoms,</HI> or &s;uch movable ones that are al|together
unlike the &s;olid Bodies we now
behold. So that to account for the pro|duction
of this pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, be|&s;ides
their Matter and Motion, the <HI>Abet|tors</HI>
of this Opinion want a Principle for
Solidity or Cohe&s;ion and Ela&s;ticity; Both
which are owing to no e&s;&s;ential Property
of Matter, as is &s;hewn in the two la&s;t Se|ctions
of the preceding Chapter.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. There are &s;everal <HI>Appearances</HI>
absolutely unaccountable from the Laws
of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> and con&s;equently the&s;e
cou'd never be produc'd by Matter and
Motion alone, or any <HI>Combinations</HI> of
them. It were endle&s;s to allege all the
In&s;tances that might be brought on this
Head, &s;ome few of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
<PB N="15" REF="166">
will &s;uffice; for if any one be incon&s;i&s;tent
with the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> then it is
impo&s;&s;ible this <HI>Sy&s;teme</HI> cou'd have been
produc'd by the concour&s;e of <HI>Atoms.</HI> The
fir&s;t I &s;hall in&s;tance in, is that great Law
to which all the Bodies of this Univer&s;e are
&s;ubject, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Gravitation.</HI> In
the former <HI>Chapter</HI> I have endeavour'd to
&s;hew that this Property is not <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to
Matter, nor can ari&s;e from the Figure, Tex|ture
or Motions of its Parts, but is <HI>implan|ted</HI>
therein by &s;ome Power &s;uperiour to
that of Matter; whence it is evident that
one of the primary Attributes of Matter
is independent of the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m.</HI>
That active Principle which animates as it
were the dead Ma&s;s of Bodies, and which
is the Cau&s;e of all the beautiful <HI>Appearan|ces</HI>
of Nature, owes its Origin to &s;ome|thing
different from Matter and Motion,
and therefore this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things cou'd
not ari&s;e from thence.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. Not only <HI>Gravitation,</HI> or that
implanted Principle whereby Bodies tend
towards one another, is above the Powers
<PB N="16" REF="167">
of Matter, but all the Effects and Appea|rances
that nece&s;&s;arily depend thereupon,
<HI>i. e.</HI> all the <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> and <HI>Terre&s;trial Appea|rances</HI>
are likewi&s;e above the Powers and
Laws of Matter and Motion. All the At|tempts
of others before Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> to
explain the regular and con&s;tant <HI>Appearan|ces</HI>
of Nature, were mo&s;t of 'em <HI>&V;ngeo|metrical,</HI>
and all of 'em &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent or
unintelligible, that it was as hard to allow
their <HI>Po&s;tulata</HI> as to conceive the thing
which they pretended to account for
from them. All the <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> that ever
were, cou'd never from the meer Laws
of <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> explain how the Planets came
to move in <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits, they might
(if Matter had been &s;elf-moving) have for
ever &s;tray'd in right Lines; but, that
they &s;hould con&s;tantly revolve in Orbits,
that they &s;hould approach to and remove
from a determin'd point at different Sea|&s;ons,
and that uniformly and con&s;tant|ly,
is altogether unaccountable from the
Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> as has been &s;hewn in
the former <HI>Chapter.</HI> But from this im|planted
<PB N="17" REF="168">
Principle of Gravitation, all the
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> are accounted for, and that
to the greate&s;t nicety we are capable of
di&s;tingui&s;hing. So that not only this Uni|ver&s;e
cou'd not have been produc'd by the
Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> but there is &s;carce a
&s;ingle <HI>Appearance</HI> that can thence ade|quately
be accounted for.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The Production of Animals is
altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the Laws of
<HI>Mechani&s;m.</HI> 1. The Blood is &s;queez'd by
the force of the Heart from the left <HI>Ven|tricle,</HI>
through the Arteries unto the Ex|tremities
of the Body, and is thence re|turn'd
by the Veins into the right <HI>Ventri|cle;</HI>
thence by the <HI>Arteria Pulmonalis</HI> unto
the <HI>Lungs,</HI> from the <HI>Lungs</HI> by the <HI>Vena
Pulmonalis</HI> to the right <HI>Ventricle</HI> again.
The Motion of the Heart is caus'd by the
nervous Juices mixing with the Blood in
the <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> part thereof. And the&s;e
nervous Juices are both deriv'd from the
Blood, and forc'd into the <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> part
of the Heart, by the Motion of the Heart
it&s;elf, the Texture of their containing Ve&s;|&s;els,
<PB N="18" REF="169">
and perhaps by the pul&s;ation of the
Arteries upon the Nerves in the Brain.
Here now the Heart is the Cau&s;e of the
Motion of the Blood in the Arteries, and
the Motion of the Blood in the <HI>Arteries</HI>
urging their Juices through the Nerves, is
the Cau&s;e of the Motion of the Heart,
which is a plain <HI>Circulation</HI> of <HI>Mechanical</HI>
Powers; <HI>i. e.</HI> a <HI>Perpetuum Mobile,</HI> which
by what was &s;aid in the preceding Chap|ter
is contrary to the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m.</HI>
If an <HI>Epicurean Philo&s;opher</HI> cou'd contrive
a <HI>Water Machin</HI> that the Water &s;hou'd
move the <HI>Machin,</HI> and the <HI>Machin</HI> the
Water; &s;o that the &s;ame Water &s;hou'd
con&s;tantly return in a Circle to move the
Machin: I &s;hou'd then think their <HI>Scheme</HI>
&s;omewhat fea&s;ible. But, &s;ince the fir&s;t
is demon&s;trably impo&s;&s;ible, the latter mu&s;t
be &s;o likewi&s;e. 2. In all Animals there
are <HI>Organs</HI> in number actually indefinite
if not infinite. By an <HI>Organ</HI> I mean a
di&s;tinct independent part of a <HI>Machin:</HI> Thus
a Wheel and all its parts is an <HI>Organ</HI> of a
Watch, if I may &s;peak &s;o; and a <HI>Gland</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="170">
with all its parts, or a Canal from its Origin
to its Extremity is an <HI>Organ</HI> in an Animal
Body. Now the&s;e Organs or independent
parts in the Animal, are infinitely many,
which is evident both from the Nature of
<HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> and <HI>Nutrition. Sen&s;ation</HI> is per|form'd
by the mediation of an <HI>Organ</HI> ari|&s;ing
from the Brain and continued through
the part affected. Now there is not the
lea&s;t imaginable &s;olid part of the Ve&s;&s;els
or Mu&s;cles but is &s;en&s;ible, and therefore
the Organs in Animals that convey this
Sen&s;ation, are infinite in Number. To
this perhaps it may be objected, that one
<HI>Organ</HI> may convey <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> through &s;e|veral
places, and con&s;equently tho' ev'ry
minute part of the Body be &s;en&s;ible, it will
not follow that the Organs which convey
this <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> are infinitely many, &s;ince they
may all be only the continuation of &s;ome
few <HI>Organs</HI> through different parts. But
the An&s;wer is obvious, if every point of
the Ve&s;&s;els and Mu&s;cles of the Animal Bo|dy
be &s;en&s;ible, then the <HI>Organs</HI> which
convey the Sen&s;ation are infinitely &s;mall,
<PB N="20" REF="171">
and if infinitely &s;mall they mu&s;t be infi|nitely
many, &s;eeing their Extremities in
the Brain con&s;titute a finite <HI>Superficies,</HI> or
fill a finite Space: For a finite number of in|finitely
&s;mall parts can never make a finite
Quantity. Again, <HI>Nutrition</HI> is perform'd
by an Organ, through which the Supply
is convey'd to the Place to be nouri&s;h'd,
and &s;ince there is no part of the Body that
may not be encreas'd or dimini&s;h'd (as is
evident from the Cure of Wounds in all
Places through which the nece&s;&s;ary part of
the Fluids of the Body can pa&s;s) it is plain
that ev'ry individual point of the Ani|mal
Body is the termination of an <HI>Organ</HI>
through which the <HI>Nutrition</HI> may be con|vey'd.
Moreover &s;eeing even the Canals
them&s;elves do encrea&s;e in bulk, may de|cay
and be impair'd, ev'ry a&s;&s;ignable part
of the&s;e Canals mu&s;t be the termination
of &s;ome <HI>&s;ecretory</HI> Duct &s;eparating a fluid
fit to encrea&s;e their Dimen&s;ions or repair
their Lo&s;&s;es; and the&s;e &s;ecretory Chanels
again mu&s;t have others to encrea&s;e <HI>their</HI>
bulk or repair <HI>their</HI> Lo&s;&s;es, and &s;o on <HI>in
<PB N="21" REF="172">
infinitum.</HI> Add to all the&s;e, that the fi|ne&s;t
Gla&s;&s;es di&s;cover nothing in the &s;eve|ral
parts of the Ve&s;&s;els and Mu&s;cles but
fine &s;lender Canals; and the better the
<HI>Micro&s;copes</HI> are, the greater Number of
tho&s;e capillary Pipes are di&s;covered; and
the&s;e parts which were formerly reckon'd
<HI>Parenchymatous</HI> are now found to be bun|dles
or heaps of exceedingly &s;mall Tubes
or Threads. The Mu&s;cles them&s;elves con|&s;i&s;t
of a Number of Fibres, and each Fi|bre
of an incredible Number of little <HI>Fi|brils,</HI>
bound together and divided into
little Cells or <HI>Ve&s;icles,</HI> the Glands are no|thing
but a <HI>clew</HI> of little &s;lender Pipes di|ver&s;ly
rolled or folded together; the <HI>Brain</HI>
is a numberle&s;s <HI>Congeries</HI> of infinitely &s;mall
Tubes woven into &s;everal Figures; the
<HI>Nerves</HI> are bundles of &s;mall <HI>cylindrical</HI>
Pipes; and the <HI>Lungs</HI> and <HI>Liver</HI> are but
Heaps of little Bladders upon which the
Blood Ve&s;&s;els are &s;pread in Net-work; or
of little Glands among which the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els
are di&s;per&s;ed. In one Word, all the &s;o|lid
parts of the Body are nothing, but
<PB N="22" REF="173">
either very fine exceeding &s;mall Tubes for
the conveyance of &s;ome fluid, or &s;lender
Threads, in Bundles ty'd together by
others &s;urrounding'em, or going from one
Fibre to another, or &s;pread out into thin
Membranes: For the <HI>Bones</HI> are nothing
but &s;uch Bundles, and all the Membranes
or Membranons Coats of the Ve&s;&s;els, are
nothing but the&s;e Threads wrought toge|ther
into thin Skins. From all which it
is beyond di&s;pute, that every Animal is
made of Organs in Number really infinite.
For the&s;e Organs become at la&s;t infinitely
&s;mall, and &s;o their Sum mu&s;t be infinitely
many, &s;eing it con&s;titutes a finite Quantity.
Now how ridiculous is it to imagine a
thing &s;o wonderfully made cou'd be the
Effect of meer Chance, or of the blind
Laws of Motion. In <HI>Artificial Machines,</HI>
the more complicated and compounded
the Contrivance of the Parts is, the grea|ter
the difficulty is in adju&s;ting them; and
the difficulty encrea&s;es in the &s;ame proporti|on
the <HI>complications</HI> do, and con&s;equent|ly
when the <HI>complications</HI> are infinite the
<PB N="23" REF="174">
Machin is altogether above the Power of
<HI>Mechanicks,</HI> and quite impracticable by the
Laws of Matter and Motion: But this is
exactly the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and therefore the
Production of an Animal is altogether <HI>im|mechanical.</HI>
3. Allowing Animals might
$ave been produc'd by the ca&s;ual concour&s;e
of <HI>Atoms,</HI> why do not the&s;e very &s;ame Cau|&s;es
continually operate, and why do we not
&s;ee the &s;ame Effects in our Days (&s;ince the
Cau&s;es continue the &s;ame) that were beheld
in former Times? If any of the <HI>Philo&s;o|phers</HI>
&s;hou'd &s;hew us &s;uch an Appearance;
nay, if they wou'd but tell us (without
runing upon Contradictions) how &s;uch
a <HI>Machin</HI> might be produc'd, we might
begin to hearken to their Pretences. But
&s;ince &s;uch a thing was never &s;een nor pre|tended,
it's very arrogant in them to think
People &s;hou'd believe the Matter without
any Rea&s;on upon their meer Word. No
Body now-a-days that under&s;tands any
thing of Nature or <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> can &s;o much
as imagine that any Animal how abject &s;o|ever
can be produc'd by an <HI>equivocal Ge|neration,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="175">
or without the conjunction of
Male and Female Parents, in the &s;ame or
in two different Individuals. And very few
who have con&s;idered the Matter but own
that ev'ry Animal proceeds from a pre|exi&s;tent
<HI>Animalcul,</HI> and that the Parents
conduce nothing but a convenient Habita|tion
and &s;uitable Nouri&s;hments to it, till
it be fit to be tru&s;ted with the Light, and
capable of receiving the Benefit of the Air.
We know very well that there is nothing
in the <HI>Animal Machin,</HI> but an infinity of
branching and winding Canals, fill'd with
Liquors of different Natures, going the
&s;ame perpetual round which are no more
capable of producing the wonderful Fabrick
of another Animal, than a thing is of ma|king
it&s;elf. Be&s;ides, in the <HI>Generation</HI> of
an Animal, there is a nece&s;&s;ity that the
<HI>Head, Heart, Nerves, Veins</HI> and <HI>Arteries</HI>
&s;hou'd be form'd at the &s;ame time, which
can never be done by the Motion of any
fluid what way &s;oever mov'd; for as hath
been ju&s;t now &s;aid, the Heart cannot
move, unle&s;s Animal Spirits, be &s;ent from
<PB N="25" REF="176">
the Head through the Nerves into it; the
Animal Spirits cannot be deriv'd into the
Heart unle&s;s the Blood be &s;queez'd by the
Heart through the Arteries into the Brain.
So that it is evident that the Head and
Heart, the Arteries Veins and Nerves mu&s;t
be all form'd at the &s;ame time, if the Ani|mal
is <HI>Mechanically</HI> produc'd. But this is
altogether impo&s;&s;ible, for no Motion of
any fluid or fluids how&s;oever di&s;po&s;ed can
form all the&s;e at the &s;ame in&s;tant. And
we know all the internal <HI>Mechanical</HI> Acti|ons
of Animals are perform'd by the force
of their fluids. Let any one con&s;ider the
<HI>Infinity</HI> of Canals and other Organical
parts in an Animal, and again con&s;ider
that all that one Animal can conduce to|ward
the <HI>Generation</HI> of another is by the
force of &s;ome Liquors through &s;ome Ca|nals,
and try if from this Power he be
able to form the Idea of the <HI>Generation</HI>
of an Animal. It is doing Penance to
read the wretched Accounts of the wi&s;e&s;t
and mo&s;t learned <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> on this Head.
To ob&s;erve how in every &s;tep they con|tradict
<PB N="26" REF="177">
the known Laws of Motion; and
indeed the manner after which they wou'd
have 'em generated is as much above the
Power and beyond the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI>
as the true and genuin Manner and Me|thod
of their Production is. From all the&s;e
Con&s;iderations, it is evident that an Ani|mal
cannot be produc'd mechanically, it
is too hard a Probleme to be &s;olv'd from
&s;o few <HI>data</HI> as Matter and Motion. For
indeed cou'd this one be once &s;olv'd by
any of the <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> we &s;hou'd be ea|&s;ily
&s;atisfy'd of the re&s;t, tho' Plants and
all the vegetable Kingdom be liable to the
&s;ame Difficulties, and furni&s;h us with the
&s;ame Objections; for they are indeed only
Animals of a lower Rank. And cou'd it
be once prov'd either by <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> or
by <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Fact</HI> that a Plant or an Ani|mal
cou'd be produc'd by <HI>Mechani&s;m, i. e.</HI>
Nature, or the Laws of Motion, the thought|ful
parts of Mankind wou'd be ea&s;ily temp|ted
to believe, that &s;ince the better part
was produc'd by Mechani&s;m, the meaner
<HI>i. e.</HI> all the re&s;t of this vi&s;ible World might
<PB N="27" REF="178">
have been form'd the &s;ame way. So that
it is a Matter of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence
that we have demon&s;trated, that neither
Animals nor Vegetables can be produc'd
<HI>Mechanically.</HI> There are many other Ar|guments
which I can produce to prove the
&s;ame Propo&s;ition which the Language I
write in will not permit me to &s;et forth.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The <HI>Spontaneous</HI> Motions of the &s;en|&s;itive
part of this <HI>Sy&s;teme</HI> is an eternal con|tradition
to the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m.</HI> We
have &s;ufficiently &s;hewn that neither <HI>Spon|taneous</HI>
(nor indeed any) Motion is e&s;&s;en|tial
to Matter, it is determin'd to one di|rection
(while in Motion) which it can
no more alter than move of it&s;elf. This
our Sen&s;es may daily inform us of, the
Ball goes on in the direction of the Club
or of the Body of the Piece out of which
it is &s;hot, the Arrow in that given it by
the Bow&s;tring, and the Hand of the Dial|plate
in that given it by the Wheels, and
that nece&s;&s;arily and con&s;tantly if not forc'd
out of the &s;ame by &s;ome foreign Violence.
But all <HI>Sen&s;itive</HI> Animals have a <HI>Self-moti|on,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="179">
can turn and wind, move through all
the points of the Compa&s;s, go back and
forward as their Occa&s;ions require, or In|clinations
prompt 'em. It's true, &s;ome of
our Modern <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI> have a&s;&s;erted,
that the <HI>Brute-Creation</HI> are only pieces of
Clock-work, and that all their Motions
are as nece&s;&s;arily determin'd as that of the
Dial-plate. But this is meerly precarious,
and may be deny'd as ea&s;ily as it is con|fidently
alleg'd. Be&s;ides the Demon&s;tra|tions
<HI>&agrave; priori</HI> I have ju&s;t now brought to
evince the contrary, the Ob&s;ervation and
Experience of all Mankind contradicts it.
The <HI>Docility</HI> and <HI>Segacity</HI> of &s;ome Animals
demon&s;trate the contrary, and &s;ome <HI>Brute-Animals</HI>
&s;hew more Indications of it than
&s;ome of the Race of Mankind on whom
they be&s;tow it. What more evident Proofs
of a <HI>&s;pontaneous</HI> Motion cou'd the&s;e poor
Creatures give than they do, if they were
really &s;uppos'd to be endow'd with it? No|thing
but a &s;en&s;ation in our &s;elves of the
<HI>Principle</HI> of their Actions cou'd create
clearer Evidences of a <HI>&s;pontaneous</HI> Motion.
<PB N="29" REF="180">
Be&s;ides, it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible to ac|count
for the far greater part of their A|ctions
and Motions from <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> as
we have in the preceding Propo&s;itions
&s;hewn at large. And we &s;hou'd be &s;trange|ly
&s;urpriz'd if by any combination of ma|terial
Organs, we &s;hou'd produce the &s;mal|le&s;t
part of their Actions and Pa&s;&s;ions.
Wherefore &s;ince the &s;en&s;itive World is en|dow'd
with <HI>&s;pontaneous</HI> Motions, and &s;ince
this is far beyond and above the Powers of
Matter, it is evident this Univer&s;e cou'd
not have been produc'd <HI>Mechanically.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; XII. The <HI>Voluntary Motions</HI> of Ra|tional
Creatures are altogether unaccoun|table
from the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m.</HI> Mu&s;|cular
Motion is perform'd much after &s;uch
a manner as this; the Mu&s;cles are Bundles
of Fibres, which being clo&s;ely compacted
at both ends make their two <HI>Tendons,</HI> each
of which is in&s;erted into &s;ome one fixt
part of the Body or other, every one of
the&s;e Fibres con&s;i&s;ts of a prodigious Num|ber
of le&s;&s;er Fibres or <HI>Fibrils</HI> which are
&s;o many very &s;lender ela&s;tick Canals bound
<PB N="30" REF="181">
about by &s;mall tran&s;wer&s;e parallell Threads
which divide the&s;e hollow <HI>Fibrils</HI> into &s;o
many ela&s;tick <HI>Cy&s;tes</HI> or <HI>Ve&s;iculae,</HI> as if a
Gut were ty'd at equal di&s;tances. Into
every one of the&s;e <HI>Ve&s;iculae,</HI> an Artery,
Vein, and Nerve enter, the two fir&s;t to
bring and carry back the Blood, the lat|ter
to carry thither likewi&s;e its proper flu|id;
which mixing in the <HI>Ve&s;iculae</HI> with the
Blood, produces a rarefaction (the manner
how, foravoiding Di&s;putes, I &s;hall forbear
at pre&s;ent to determine) whereby the&s;e
<HI>Ve&s;iculae</HI> are di&s;tended, and their <HI>Longi|tudinal
Diameters</HI> (from Knot to Knot)
&s;traitned, and &s;o the length of the whole
Mu&s;cle &s;hortned. The Nerves are the <HI>&s;e|cretory</HI>
Ducts of the <HI>Glandulous</HI> Sub&s;tance
of the Brain, and con&s;equently are much
of the &s;ame Nature, with the other <HI>Ex|cretories</HI>
of the Body, which are nothing
but &s;mall &s;lender &s;lips of the Arteries for
deriving an appropriated Juice from the
Blood. Wherefore &s;ince the nervous Juice
is form'd out of the Blood, and &s;ince the
Nerves are very &s;mall Arterial Tubes, this
<PB N="31" REF="182">
Juice mu&s;t move in the&s;e Nerves after the
&s;ame manner the Blood does in the Arte|ries;
only with this difference, that it moves
abundantly more &s;low, (its Velocity be|ing
abated either by the many circumvo|lutions
of the Artery in the <HI>Gland,</HI> which
is the Origin of the Nerve, or by the re|&s;i&s;tence
the Juice meets with in the &s;lender
Pipe of the Nerve it &s;elf.) If the <HI>circula|tion</HI>
of the Blood be admitted, and all
the Juices of the Body be allow'd to be
deriv'd from it, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that any
of the&s;e Juices &s;hou'd &s;tagnat in their Ve&s;|&s;els
longer than till they be fill'd. And
therefore the nervous Juice in its Channels
is propell'd after the &s;ame manner and by
the &s;ame Mechani&s;m the Blood is urg'd
forward in the Arteries. Now in the Mu&s;|cles
of involuntary Motion, &s;uch as the
Heart, the Lungs, the Stomach and Guts,
and the mu&s;cular Coats of the Ve&s;&s;els,
this nervous Juice is con&s;tantly deriv'd by
a <HI>Mechanical</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity. In the Heart,
while the <HI>Auricles</HI> are full of Blood, they
are di&s;tended, and the influence of the
<PB N="32" REF="183">
nervous Juices into their Mu&s;cles thereby
&s;top'd; but when once this Blood begins
to flow into the <HI>Ventricles,</HI> the re&s;i&s;tence
ari&s;ing from the di&s;ten&s;ion of the <HI>Auricles</HI>
to the influx of the nervous Juice is taken
off, and &s;o it flows into the mu&s;cular Sub|&s;tance
of the <HI>Auricles</HI> and thereby they
are contracted, while the <HI>Ventricles</HI> are di|&s;tended,
and the influx of the nervous
Juice into their Mu&s;cles is thereby &s;top'd,
till the Blood be deriv'd into the <HI>Aorta,</HI>
and the Impediment from this di&s;ten&s;ion
to the influx of the nervous Juice be taken
off, and &s;o the <HI>Ventricles</HI> come into Con|traction;
which hinders the Blood from run|ing
any more into the <HI>Ventricles</HI> from the <HI>Au|ricles,</HI>
and then the <HI>Auricles</HI> are again fill'd:
And thus, by a <HI>Mechanical</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity they
act <HI>alternately,</HI> the Auricles and Ventricles
being as it were <HI>Antagoni&s;ts</HI> to one another;
&s;o as that while the&s;e are di&s;tended tho&s;e
are contracted, the di&s;ten&s;ion of the fir&s;t
permitting the influence of the nervous
Juice into the latter; and &s;o on the other
hand. After the &s;ame manner are the <HI>mu&s;|cular</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="184">
Coats of the Blood Ve&s;&s;els, and of
the Coats of the other Ve&s;&s;els containing
Liquors deriv'd from the Blood, <HI>alternate|ly</HI>
contracted and dilated; for by the con|traction
of the Heart the Blood is thrown
into the Arteries, which di&s;tends them,
and &s;o the influence of the nervous Juice
into their Mu&s;cular Coat is hindred; but
when the Blood is by the <HI>impetus</HI> it has
conceiv'd deriv'd into the Veins, this im|pediment
is taken off, and the Mu&s;cular
Coats of the Arteries then act, the <HI>Mem|branous</HI>
by their <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> concurring. In
the Lungs the Gravity of the <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI>
forces the Air into the &s;mall orbicular Ve|&s;icles
thereof, and dilates the Cavity of
the Brea&s;t; whereby the pre&s;&s;ure of its
Sides upon them, and the Nerves that act
in this function is taken off, and &s;o the
Mu&s;cles of the <HI>diafragm</HI> and the other
concurring ones are at freedom to act,
and to di&s;tend the Cavity of the <HI>thorax,</HI>
till the pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;ides of the Brea&s;t
become too &s;trong for the&s;e oppo&s;ite com|bin'd
dilating Cau&s;es; and then by their
<PB N="34" REF="185">
own Gravity and the ela&s;tick force of the
Ribs they fall down and compre&s;s the
Lungs and &s;hut np the Emi&s;&s;aries of the
Nerves. So likewi&s;e in the Stomach and
Guts, when the <HI>Longitudinal Mu&s;cular</HI>
Fibres are in Action, the <HI>Tran&s;ver&s;e</HI> and
<HI>Spiral</HI> ones ar$ relax'd by the pre&s;&s;ure of
the acting Fibres upon the Emi&s;&s;aries of
the Nerves of the relax'd ones; and &s;o on
the other Hand, when tho&s;e are relax'd
the&s;e are in action, and univer&s;ally in all
the <HI>involuntary</HI> Motions there is a <HI>Mecha|nical</HI>
Nece&s;&s;ity for the derivation of the
nervous Juices into the Mu&s;cles employed
in the&s;e Motions. But in voluntary Mo|tions
there neither is nor can be any &s;uch
Mechanical Nece&s;&s;ity, it being a plain
Contradiction to their Nature; and there|fore
voluntary Motion is quite contrary
to the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m:</HI> we can move
our Hands and Feet how and when we
plea&s;e in an In&s;tant, we can bend and un|bend'
em as we will. There is no <HI>Mecha|nical</HI>
Cau&s;e imaginable to force this ner|vous
Juice into the Mu&s;cles of voluntary
<PB N="35" REF="186">
Motion, and no Motion can follow unle&s;s
this Juice be deriv'd, as is plain from hence,
that cuting the Nerves that &s;erve any Mu&s;|cle,
tho' all other things continue the
&s;ame, yet no Motion will follow. And
the only Conception we can form of vo|luntary
Motions, is that the Mind like a
skilful <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> &s;trikes upon that Nerve
which conveys animal Spirits to the Mu&s;|cle
to be contracted, and adds a greater
force than the natural to the nervous Juice,
whereby it opens its Pa&s;&s;age into the Ve|&s;icles
of which the Mu&s;cular Fibres con|&s;i&s;t,
which it cou'd not have done by its
natural Power. But this Action of the
Mind or Will upon the&s;e Animal Spirits
being altogether unaccountable from the
Laws of Motion, it is plain that volun|tary
Motion is altogether <HI>immechanical.</HI>
And indeed were it <HI>Mechanical,</HI> it cou'd
not be Voluntary; for what ever acts
<HI>Mechanically,</HI> acts con&s;tantly and nece&s;|&s;arily,
and &s;o can never act volunta|rily.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="187">
&sect; XIII. That <HI>Freedom</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> of
choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing which we find in our
&s;elves is altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Me|chani&s;m.</HI>
Some Men indeed deny that
we have any Free-will at all; but the&s;e
need only examine their own Con&s;ciences
to be convinc'd of their mi&s;take; they

own <HI>Freedom;</HI> they can choo&s;e the time
and Place the Degrees and Circum&s;tances
of all the&s;e Actions that are call'd free.
It's true &s;ome of our natural Actions are
nece&s;&s;ary, but the&s;e which are commonly
call'd voluntary Actions, are as much free
as the nature of things will permit them.
Their Power being limited, I wou'd glad|ly
know what greater <HI>Indications</HI> of free|dom
they cou'd wi&s;h to have, than they
now have. The Pa&s;&s;ions of Mankind
(which in mo&s;t, determine their Actions)
are indeed violent, but they have it in
<PB N="37" REF="188">
their Power to &s;u&s;pend for &s;ome time
the &s;atisfying of them; which &s;hews they
are not nece&s;&s;arily determin'd toward their
Satisfaction; for the Action of nece&s;&s;ary
Agents can only be &s;u&s;pended by a Mira|cle.
Let us &s;uppo&s;e that Man in a per|fect
&s;tate of Health, is free and has a Pow|er
of <HI>election;</HI> the only <HI>Indications</HI> he cou'd
give of this Freedom, are by doing the
contrary, where there are weighty and
&s;olid Rea&s;ons for doing &s;uch a thing; or
by making an <HI>Election</HI> among many things,
when there is no imaginable Rea&s;on to
determine him more to one than another;
or to be able to &s;u&s;pend the effect of na|tural
Actions, when without this interpo|&s;ition
they wou'd <HI>Mechanically</HI> operate.
Now it's certain that we are capable of
giving all the&s;e <HI>Indications,</HI> to &s;hew our
Freedom: we have it in our Power to hurt
or even de&s;troy our &s;elves tho' there be
the be&s;t Rea&s;ons in the World to hinder
us from &s;o doing, we can take out the
one and not the other, in two or more of
the &s;ame things in all Circum&s;tances alike:
<PB N="38" REF="189">
Tho' <HI>Re&s;piration</HI> be reckon'd an involuntary
Action, and tho' it is certainly perform'd
<HI>mechanically</HI> and uniformly, yet we have
it in our Power to keep in our Breaths
and to &s;u&s;pend the efficacy of this natural
<HI>Function</HI> for &s;ome time; and this &s;eems
to be one of the mo&s;t evident <HI>Indications</HI>
of Freedom that can po&s;&s;ibly be de&s;ired.
For tho' in other Ca&s;es it may be alledg'd
that it is the &s;ubtil and <HI>imperceptible</HI> man|ner
after which we are determin'd that
makes any of our Actions &s;eem free, yet
in this In&s;tance that Objection can have
no Place; for if we are determin'd ever
&s;o <HI>imperceptibly,</HI> it is by the Nece&s;|&s;ity
of Nature we are determin'd. Now
it is ab&s;urd to think that Nature &s;hou'd
determine any natural <HI>Function</HI> to be per|form'd
regularly and con&s;tantly the &s;ame
way, and that by <HI>Mechanical</HI> Laws, and
at the &s;ame time determine this <HI>Function</HI>
to be irregularly and uncertainly &s;u&s;pen|ded.
On the other Hand, if we are ne|ce&s;&s;arily
determin'd in all our Actions,
and if we have no Freedom, it is ab&s;o|lutely
<PB N="39" REF="190">
impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hou'd make any E|lection
among things in all Circum&s;tances
alike; for if we are determin'd, it can
only be from the things them&s;elves with|out
us, for all things within us are upon
this <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> to be &s;uppos'd to move
uniformly and <HI>Mechanically.</HI> Now where
the things without us are in all Circum|&s;tances
alike, we can never be determin'd
to any one of them by them&s;elves. And
therefore were we not free, we cou'd ne|ver
make an Election among things alto|gether
alike. By things altogether alike,
I mean &s;uch as are alike as to all the Cir|cum&s;tances
nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute them
the things requir'd. Thus two Farthings
are altogether alike, tho' they may differ
in &s;ome &s;mall Circum&s;tances that do not
concern the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of that <HI>Species</HI> of Coin.
Thus 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. are equally odd Num|bers,
and 2. 4. 6. 8. equally even Num|bers,
and if it were propos'd to a&s;&s;ign an
even or odd Number, there are infinitely
many which are equally &s;uch. The &s;ame
thing happens in the An&s;wers to all the&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="191">
<HI>Problems</HI> which are call'd <HI>indetermin'd;</HI>
and in a&s;&s;igning one of the An&s;wers to
any &s;uch <HI>Problems,</HI> there is nothing in their
Nature that can po&s;&s;ibly determine us,
the Conditions of the Problem only being
had re&s;pect to. And therefore &s;uch
things as the&s;e are only pitch'd upon by
the energy of our Wills or Freedom. But
no Arguments will make a Man confe&s;s
he feels, if he be ob&s;tinately re&s;olv'd not
to confe&s;s it. Now Liberty is a thing
felt, and is only to be found by a <HI>reflex|ion</HI>
on our &s;elves and our Actions; but
there is one Argument which will always
have weight with the wi&s;er and better
part of Mankind. And that is that with|out
Free-will, Virtue and Vice, Ju&s;tice and
Inju&s;tice are only bare Words. Now if
Rational Creatures be free, as mo&s;t cer|tainly
they are, this Freedom is a plain
downright Contradiction to <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI>
for <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> produces all its Effects ne|ce&s;&s;arily.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. Having I think &s;ufficiently
&s;hewn the Incon&s;i&s;tency and Impo&s;&s;ibility
<PB N="41" REF="192">
of the <HI>Epicurean Scheme.</HI> I come to the
&s;econd Opinion about the <HI>Origination</HI> of
the Univer&s;e, which in few Words tells
us very po&s;itively, that this pre&s;ent &s;tate
of things has been from all <HI>Eternity</HI> of it|&s;elf,
&s;o as we now behold it; and that
any Changes that have happen'd therein,
have proceeded from the Laws of <HI>Mecha|ni&s;m</HI>
that now obtain in the World. This
<HI>Scheme</HI> con&s;i&s;ts principally of the&s;e two
Parts. 1. That this World has been
for <HI>ever</HI> in the &s;tate we now behold it.
2. That it has been &s;o for <HI>ever</HI> of it&s;elf,
independent of any other Cau&s;e. This
Opinion is commonly, but fal&s;ly a&s;crib'd
to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> not as its fir&s;t <HI>Broacher</HI> but as its
able&s;t <HI>Patron.</HI> But tho' <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> held the
fir&s;t part of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the World was
from all <HI>Eternity</HI> as we now behold it, yet
he did not think it was &s;o <HI>of it &s;elf;</HI> and
there is a very great Difference betwixt
allowing this pre&s;ent <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of the <HI>&V;ni|ver&s;e</HI>
to have been created from all <HI>Eter|nity</HI>
by an <HI>Omnipotent Cau&s;e,</HI> and believing
it to have been for <HI>ever</HI> of it&s;elf without
<PB N="42" REF="193">
any <HI>Cau&s;e.</HI> My De&s;ign in the following
Di&s;cour&s;e is not to di&s;pute again&s;t any
<HI>Scheme</HI> of tho&s;e who admit the Exi&s;tence
of a <HI>Deity,</HI> I intend only to &s;hew, that
this pre&s;ent &s;tate of things cou'd not have
been from all <HI>Eternity,</HI> neither of it &s;elf,
nor without the frequent and particular
interpo&s;ition of a <HI>Divine Power;</HI> and to
make it plain that naturally and of it&s;elf it
tends to <HI>Di&s;&s;olution;</HI> Tho' in the mean
time, it is not to be doubted but that
that <HI>Almighty Power</HI> which cou'd create
this <HI>beautiful Sy&s;tem</HI> of things, can pre|&s;erve
it in being as long as He plea&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. That this Univer&s;e cou'd never
have been ftom all <HI>Eternity</HI> of it&s;elf, in
the pre&s;ent condition it now is, is evident
from hence, that it requires an <HI>extrin&s;ick
Principle</HI> for its &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in its pre&s;ent
Condition. If one &s;hou'd &s;ee a Piece of
<HI>Clock-work,</HI> pointing out the Divi&s;ions of
time exactly and regularly, he might have
&s;ome Difficulties about the manner of its
Production; but if he &s;hou'd &s;ee or learn
that it requir'd &s;ome <HI>Foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> to
<PB N="43" REF="194">
keep it a going, that its Motion depended
upon &s;ome Principle without it&s;elf, that
it requir'd winding up of the Spring or
Weights, he wou'd be &s;oon &s;atisfy'd it
cou'd not have been from all Eternity of
it&s;elf in the &s;tate he then beheld it. Now
this is the very Condition of the <HI>Earth,</HI> the
<HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Planets,</HI> and of all the <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI>
and <HI>Terre&s;trial</HI> Appearances. Their Mo|tions
and Actions depend upon a Principle
quite <HI>extrin&s;ick</HI> to Matter, which ari&s;es from
none of its Powers or Properties, as has been
&s;hown in the former Chapter. The Power
which produces and pre&s;erves their Moti|ons,
&s;prings from &s;omething without them|&s;elves,
and if this Power were &s;u&s;pended
or withdrawn, they wou'd immediately
&s;top and their Motions wou'd be de&s;troy'd,
and they wou'd become a lifele&s;s unactive
heap of Matter. And this Power is no|thing
el&s;e but that univer&s;al Law of Gra|vitation,
which <HI>actuates</HI> the whole frame
of all the <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> of Bodies; which pro|ceeds
from a Principle both independent
of, and di&s;tinct from Matter and all its Fa|culties.
<PB N="44" REF="195">
Wherefore it is altogether impo&s;|&s;ible
this pre&s;ent &s;tate of things &s;hou'd
have been from all Eternity <HI>of it&s;elf,</HI> &s;ince
at pre&s;ent it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a regular
and beautiful <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> without the perpe|tual
influence of &s;ome &s;uperiour and <HI>ex|trin&s;ick</HI>
Power.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. Whatever depends upon ano|ther
thing as its <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> as al&s;o, whatever
is nece&s;&s;arily requir'd for the Exi&s;tence or
Pre&s;ervation of another thing, the&s;e cou'd
not have been from all Eternity <HI>of them|&s;elves;</HI>
for <HI>Self-exi&s;tence</HI> nece&s;&s;arily implies
independency as to Exi&s;tence on any other
thing, either as Cau&s;e or as Effect; (I mean
only of tho&s;e things which are about us,
<HI>viz.</HI> The vi&s;ible things of this World,
which have but Qualities both finite in
Number and Degree; and con&s;equently
have <HI>a&s;&s;ignable</HI> relations to and dependen|ces
upon one another; for it is otherwi&s;e
in the <HI>Immen&s;e Being</HI> in re&s;pect of his
Creatures, which can have no Proportion
to him, and he no dependence on them.)
And when a thing depends upon another
<PB N="45" REF="196">
thing as its Cau&s;e, this implies that the
fir&s;t thing exi&s;ts that the &s;econd <HI>may ex|i&s;t;</HI>
which &s;uppo&s;es De&s;ign and Contri|vance,
and con&s;equently is a &s;ign of Pro|duction
or Creation, and not of the Self-exi&s;tence
of the&s;e things. Likewi&s;e, when
a thing is nece&s;&s;arily requir'd for the Ex|i&s;tence
or Pre&s;ervation of another, it plain|ly
implies that the fir&s;t thing exi&s;ts that
the &s;econd <HI>may exi&s;t,</HI> which likewi&s;e &s;up|po&s;es
<HI>De&s;ign</HI> and <HI>Contrivance,</HI> and con&s;e|quently
can be no &s;ign of <HI>Self-exi&s;tence</HI>
in the&s;e things. Now is there any thing
more plain, than that mo&s;t of the things
in this our <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful
towards the Being or Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Man|kind.</HI>
Remove the <HI>Sun</HI> from us, or us
from the <HI>Sun,</HI> the Earth cou'd bring
forth no Fruits for our Support; take
away the <HI>Moon,</HI> the <HI>Seas</HI> wou'd &s;tagnat
and the Fi&s;h be de&s;troy'd; level our
<HI>Mountains</HI> we &s;hou'd have no fre&s;h Waters;
de&s;troy our <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> or the Airs Ela&s;ti|city,
we &s;hou'd &s;well-like poy&s;oned Rats.
Do not the&s;e and a thou&s;and other In&s;tan|ces
<PB N="46" REF="197">
I cou'd allege, demon&s;trate that all
the Beings of this Univer&s;e exi&s;t as the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Effect, or for the Exi&s;tence or Pre|&s;ervation
of other Beings, and con&s;equent|ly
imply <HI>Contrivance</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign;</HI> which
is a mo&s;t evident &s;ign that all the&s;e things
have been produc'd and are not Self-ex|i&s;tent.
If a wild <HI>Scythian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> who
never &s;aw a Hou&s;e in his Life, &s;hou'd
meet with a <HI>Noble Palace</HI> neatly fini&s;h'd
and finely furni&s;h'd, and about it &s;hou'd
find Creatures that cou'd not &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out
&s;uch a Convenience, and &s;hou'd plain|ly
di&s;cover, that the Accommodations and
Conveniences of this <HI>Building</HI> were ex|actly
&s;uited in every Circum&s;tance to the
Wants and Nece&s;&s;ities of the&s;e Creatures;
I think he wou'd have no difficulty in con|cluding
that this Hou&s;e was built by &s;ome
wi&s;e <HI>Architect</HI> for the Convenience of the&s;e
Creatures, he wou'd certainly never dream
that it had for ever been there of it&s;elf &s;o
as he then beheld it. Now this is the ve|ry
Ca&s;e betwixt us and the <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of
things about us; not that I think the
<PB N="47" REF="198">
whole <HI>Sy&s;teme</HI> of the Univer&s;e was made
for us of the <HI>Race of Mankind,</HI> but that
we cannot be without a great many of
the&s;e things that are round us, and that
con&s;equently we were &s;ome part in the
de&s;ign of them, and &s;o they cou'd not have
been for ever of 'em&s;elves.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. That <HI>Animals</HI> cou'd not have
been from all Eternity is plain, for both
the Rea&s;ons alleged in the two former
Sections. For 1. Their Production
and Exi&s;tence depend upon Principles
quite extrin&s;ick from and independent of
them&s;elves, I mean of their <HI>Material part.</HI>
I have formerly &s;hown, that they can nei|ther
&s;ub&s;i&s;t nor be produc'd by the Pow|ers
of <HI>Mechani&s;m;</HI> but for both require
the con&s;tant influence of a Principle even
different from that which governs the in|animated
part of the Univer&s;e, <HI>viz. Gra|vitation.</HI>
Now all that is ob&s;ervable in
this World, (according to this <HI>Scheme</HI>)
is Matter and Motion (for if we once al|low
a Power di&s;tinct from the&s;e, we ruin
this <HI>Hypothe&s;is;</HI> for we do not then know
<PB N="48" REF="199">
how far the influence of this Power may
reach, as to the Production and Pre&s;erva|tion
of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things.) But
the Production and Pre&s;ervation of <HI>Ani|mals</HI>
is above the Powers of Matter as has
been formerly &s;hown, and therefore &s;ince
they depend upon a Principle di&s;tinct from
and independent of the Laws of <HI>Mecha|ni&s;m,</HI>
and need a continual influence of
&s;ome Principle, di&s;tinct from Matter and
its Properties, they cou'd not have been
for ever of them&s;elves. 2. All the &s;eve|ral
Parts and Organs of the Animal Body
are &s;o prudently adapted to the benefit
of the whole <HI>Compo&s;itum</HI> as plainly implies
De&s;ign and Contrivance, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible
to con&s;ider this, and imagine they
have been Self-exi&s;tent. How wi&s;ely are
the <HI>Bones articulated?</HI> How prudently the
<HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> contriv'd? and how conveniently
fa&s;tned to the &s;everal Places of the Body
to produce the nece&s;&s;ary Motions? With
what Judgment are the <HI>Arteries, Veins</HI>
and <HI>Nerves</HI> rang'd? With what Wi&s;dom
are their fluids di&s;pos'd in their proper
<PB N="49" REF="200">
Ve&s;&s;els? How carefully is the propagati|on
of the <HI>Species</HI> provided for according
to &s;everal Circum&s;tances ari&s;ing from the
particular Climate and Element each <HI>Ani|mal</HI>
is confin'd to, and how ju&s;tly is eve|ry
Particular adapted for the Benefit of
the whole compound? I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion
to pur&s;ue the&s;e In&s;tances farther here|after,
but any Body who is ever &s;o lit|tle
acquainted with the <HI>&s;tructure</HI> of an
<HI>Animal,</HI> cannot but di&s;cover evident Foot|&s;teps
of <HI>De&s;ign and Contrivance</HI> in it, and
therefore Animals cannot be Self-exi|&s;tent.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. It has been formerly &s;hewn
in &sect; XXX. and its Corollary of the pre|ceding
Chapter, that &s;ome part of the
nouri&s;hment of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
and the greate&s;t part requir'd to the pro|duction
of <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals</HI> is a wa|tery
Fluid, impregnated with &s;ome other
Body, which by the&s;e Operations upon
Matter is chang'd into a &s;olid Form, of
which but a very &s;mall part is ever re&s;olv'd
into Water again, whereby the quantity
<PB N="50" REF="201">
of Water on this our Globe is daily im|pair'd
and dimini&s;h'd; wherefore if the
World had la&s;ted from all Eternity in the
State it now is, we had long &s;ince wan|ted
both &s;alt and fre&s;h Water. And in|deed
this decrea&s;e of the Quantity of Wa|ter
on our Globe is &s;o con&s;iderable, that
a <HI>very great Man</HI> is of Opinion that the
<HI>Comets</HI> were de&s;ign'd to &s;upply the &s;ame,
which when they come nigh our Dwelling,
&s;end us &s;uch a Quantity of Vapours from
their <HI>prodigious</HI> Tails, as is &s;ufficient to
&s;upply the Expen&s;es of Water till the Re|turn
of another <HI>Comet.</HI> But we &s;o &s;el|dom
receive Vi&s;its from the&s;e <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Bo|dies,
and we are &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of the
difference of the Quantity of Water fal|ling
then and at other times; and the&s;e
<HI>Comets</HI> are when they come within our
Regions at &s;o great a di&s;tance from us,
that no &s;uch con&s;iderable Effects as may
an&s;wer our Demands are, I fear, to be
expected from 'em. Be&s;ides, the Wi&s;|dom
of Nature generally &s;upplies re|gular
<HI>Deficiencies</HI> by regular and uniform
<PB N="51" REF="202">
Cau&s;es and tho' the decrea&s;e of fluidity
on this our Globe may not be ev'ry Year
of the &s;ame Quantity exactly, yet it &s;eems
to be more con&s;tant and regular than the
returns of the&s;e <HI>Comets;</HI> but of this we
&s;hall have Occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e at more
length in the following Chapter. Where|fore,
&s;ince it's certain that the Quantity
of Water on our Globe does daily de|crea&s;e
(tho' perhaps not &s;en&s;ibly) had the
World <HI>Eternally been,</HI> the whole Face of
this Earth had been more parch'd than
the Defarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> which not being
&s;o, it is plain this pre&s;ent State of things
has not been from all Eternity.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. It has been prov'd likewi&s;e in
the preceding Chapter, that the <HI>Light</HI>
of the <HI>Sun</HI> does daily decrea&s;e, and that
the Body of the Sun does continually grow
cooler; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the <HI>fixt
Stars:</HI> Now had the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars</HI>
been from all Eternity, we &s;hou'd have
been reduc'd long before this time to a
State of utter Darkne&s;s. We are very cer|tain
that the Rays of the Sun are impri|&s;oned
<PB N="52" REF="203">
in our Plants and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> in our
<HI>Metals</HI> and <HI>Minerals,</HI> and are retain'd by
the Action of Bodies upon Light; and
&s;ome part of them by their &s;eparation
from others, and their being impri&s;on'd
in the&s;e Sub&s;tances, and the Action of
Bodies upon Light, are for ever hinder'd
from returning to the Body of the <HI>Sun.</HI>
We are certain likewi&s;e that the Foun|tain
of our Heat daily impairs, that the
va&s;t Body of the <HI>Sun</HI> is perpetually a-cool|ing,
and tho' the&s;e Effects be not &s;o con|&s;iderable
as to become &s;en&s;ible in three
or four thou&s;and Years (tho' if ancient Hi|&s;tories
be true, this abatement and diminu|tion
of the Light and Heat has not been in|&s;en&s;ible)
yet in an infinity of Ages (this di|minution
being &s;till &s;omewhat) the Sun
had been redu'd to the Heat and Light of
a Candle long 'ere this time; and we had
been involv'd in a more than <HI>Cimmerian</HI>
darkne&s;s. But &s;ince we ob&s;erve no &s;uch
Effect as this, it is plain the World has
not la&s;ted from all Eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="204">
&sect; XX. But that which does infallibly
demon&s;trate that this pre&s;ent &s;tate of
things, both had a beginning and that of
them&s;elves they mu&s;t have an end, is,
that our <HI>Earth,</HI> the <HI>Planets,</HI> the <HI>Sun</HI> and
<HI>fixt Stars</HI> do not move in Spaces altoge|ther
void. But in &s;uch that do make at
lea&s;t &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance to their Motions;
I have &s;hewn in the preceding Chapter,
that the Rea&s;on why, for example, the
<HI>Planets</HI> move about the <HI>Sun</HI> is that the
Body of the <HI>Sun</HI> attracts the&s;e <HI>Planets,</HI>
and likewi&s;e the&s;e <HI>Planets</HI> attract the <HI>Sun,</HI>
and that (&s;ince the <HI>Planets</HI> de&s;cribe <HI>Ellip|tick</HI>
Orbits about the <HI>Sun</HI>) the attractive
Force of the Sun upon the Planets is <HI>reci|procally,</HI>
as the <HI>Squares</HI> of the different di|&s;tances
of the <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbit from the <HI>Suns</HI>
Center in its <HI>focus.</HI> But that be&s;ides,
the&s;e <HI>Planets</HI> were driven at fir&s;t, or at
the beginning of their Motion (to &s;peak
&s;o) by a Force who&s;e direction made an
Angle with the attractive Force; or that
at the very &s;ame time the attractive Force
of the Sun exerted it&s;elf on the&s;e <HI>Planets</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="205">
they were pu&s;h'd along in right Lines by
a Force who&s;e direction was in &s;ome man|ner
or other inclin'd to that of the directi|on
of the attractive Force of the Sun, o|therwi&s;e
they cou'd never have revolv'd
in Orbits. So that it's evident the Mo|tion
of the <HI>Planets</HI> about the Sun, is com|pounded
of two different Motions in two
different Directions, either of which be|ing
de&s;troy'd the Planets mu&s;t have
fall'n into the <HI>Sun,</HI> or &s;tray'd for ever in
right Lines; and tho' the re&s;i&s;tence of the
<HI>Medium</HI> cannot alter the <HI>Centripetal</HI> Moti|on,
(&s;o I call that whereby the Planet
tends towards the Sun) yet if there be
any re&s;i&s;tence in the <HI>Medium</HI> through
which the Planets pa&s;s, the <HI>projectil</HI> Moti|on,
(&s;o I call the other) mu&s;t decrea&s;e
and (in an infinity of Ages) be de&s;troy|ed.
Now tho' Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has con&s;ider|ed
the re&s;i&s;tence ari&s;ing from the <HI>Expan|&s;ion</HI>
of the <HI>Ela&s;tick Atmo&s;pheres</HI> of the <HI>Pla|nets,</HI>
and cannot &s;ay it is ab&s;olutely no|thing,
(for he only finds that it's not &s;uf|ficient
to de&s;troy the <HI>projectil</HI> Motion in
<PB N="55" REF="206">
a very &s;hort time,) yet he has not men|tioned
that ari&s;ing from the fluid of <HI>Light</HI>
which reaches beyond the Orbit of <HI>Saturn,</HI>
and tho' we have &s;hewn in the preceding
Chapter, that this fluid is extreamly thin
and its parts ea&s;ily moveable, yet &s;till they
make a fluid; and this fluid mu&s;t give
&s;ome re&s;i&s;tence to Bodies pa&s;&s;ing through
it, which tho' very &s;mall, mu&s;t in an in|finity
of Ages have been &s;ufficient to have
quite de&s;troyed this <HI>projectil</HI> Motion. If
the Light of the Sun be a Body (as we
have prov'd it to be) it mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t other
Bodies that move in it, and if it be but
the <HI>Action</HI> of lucid Bodies communicated
by the impul&s;e of one Body upon another,
in a &s;trait Line, without the <HI>actual</HI> Motion
of any one of 'em, yet &s;till it is nece&s;&s;ary
that there be a <HI>Series</HI> of Bodies interpos'd
betwixt the lucid Body and the illumina|ted
Object, which will as much re&s;i&s;t the
pa&s;&s;age of Bodies, as if the parts of Light
mov'd them&s;elves; &s;o that in both Ca&s;es
there mu&s;t be &s;ome re&s;i&s;tence made to Bo|dies
pa&s;&s;ing through this Ocean of Light;
<PB N="56" REF="207">
which tho' not &s;en&s;ible in any finite time,
mu&s;t have been &s;ufficient in an infinity of
Ages to have de&s;troy'd the <HI>projectil</HI> Moti|on,
and con&s;equently long e're now all the
<HI>Planets</HI> had been broiling in the Sun, had
the World la&s;ted from all Eternity; which
not having happened, it's plain this pre|&s;ent
&s;tate of things has not la&s;ted from all
Eternity in the Order we now behold
it.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. Since it has been &s;ufficiently
demon&s;trated in the preceding Chapter,
that Motion is not e&s;&s;ential to Matter,
that no particle thereof nor any <HI>Combina|tions</HI>
of particles can bring them&s;elves to
Motion, and &s;ince there are various and
different Motions ob&s;ervable in this pre|&s;ent
&s;tate of things, it's evident that the
Matter or Bodies of this Univer&s;e has
been &s;ome time or other before this pre&s;ent
time put in Motion, but more e&s;pecial|ly
&s;ince no Body put in or ev'n endow'd
with Motion, can of it&s;elf revolve in an
Orbit or any <HI>curve</HI> Line, <HI>per Coroll.</HI> 3. of
the fir&s;t <HI>Law of Nature;</HI> and &s;ince we &s;ee
<PB N="57" REF="208">
the <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Bodies do move in <HI>curve</HI> Lines
it's plain they have not for ever mov'd of
them&s;elves, and con&s;equently they have
not for ever exi&s;ted in the &s;tate we behold
'em. It is altogether impo&s;&s;ible for any
Body to move in an Orbit or any <HI>curve</HI>
Line of it&s;elf, becau&s;e at every different
point it mu&s;t change its direction; and to
&s;uppo&s;e a Body capable of changing its
direction at every different point of its
Cour&s;e, is to &s;uppo&s;e it to have Rea&s;on
and Di&s;cretion. And &s;ince to move in an
Orbit or any <HI>curve</HI> Line is to move with
a Motion compounded of two other Mo|tions,
one of which at lea&s;t mu&s;t have
been impre&s;s'd, &s;ince it cannot move of
it&s;elf by both, by the <HI>Corollary</HI> now men|tioned.
Therefore before the one of
the&s;e Motions was impre&s;s'd, it was in a
different &s;tate from what it, was in, after
that other Motion was impre&s;s'd. So that
&s;ince the <HI>Planets</HI> do revolve in Orbits or
<HI>curve</HI> Lines, it is plain they have, not for
ever been in the &s;tate we now behold
'em of them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="209">
&sect; XXII. If the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> be not actu|ally
infinite in their Number, then this
pre&s;ent &s;tate of things mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity
both have had a beginning and mu&s;t have
an end. It's certain the&s;e luminous Bo|dies
do mutually <HI>attract</HI> each other, &s;ince
it's ab&s;urd to imagine Matter not to be
of the &s;ame uniform Nature every where;
and it's as certain they do not revolve
about any common Center or Centers,
&s;ince they have been ob&s;erv'd never to
have varied their &s;ituations or di&s;tances
from each other. Now if they be finite
in Number, the terminating Bodies of the
material part of the World mu&s;t be all
free from Attractions towards the void
part, and &s;o mu&s;t be all approaching to|ward
the <HI>common Center of Gravity</HI> of the
whole; and had the Frame of the World
been eternal, they had long e're now all
of 'em met there. <HI>Space</HI> indeed may
be infinite in its extent, but there is no
imaginable Rea&s;on to believe the Number
of the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> is infinite, nor the material
part of the Univer&s;e boundle&s;s, &s;ince we
<PB N="59" REF="210">
have very good Rea&s;on to believe that
the &s;olid Sub&s;tance has a very &s;mall Propor|tion
to the Vacuities inter&s;per&s;ed even in our
<HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> and the Matter of this Univer&s;e is
almo&s;t nothing in re&s;pect of the contain|ing
Space, as has been in&s;inuated in the
former Chapter. For &s;ince Space is infi|nite
(as I &s;hall hereafter demon&s;trate) and
&s;ince there's a nece&s;&s;ity of admitting of
actual Vacuities as I have formerly &s;hewn;
it's plain, Matter cannot be infinite in its
extent, &s;ince thereby it is not equal to
<HI>Space.</HI> Now if the fixt Stars be finite in
their Number, or the material part of this
Univer&s;e limited in its extent, the Bodies
at the limits of the material part being
quite free from attractions upon the &s;ide
toward the infinite Space, mu&s;t yield to
the attracting Force of the Bodies toward
the <HI>common Center of Gravity</HI> of the mate|rial
part, and the <HI>Boundaries</HI> yielding, the
Bodies next them mu&s;t do &s;o likewi&s;e, and
&s;o on ev'n to the Center; for nothing but
an equal attraction on all Hands can keep
the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> con&s;tant in their Places, and
<PB N="60" REF="211">
nothing but an infinite Number rang'd up
and down the infinite Space can be &s;uffi|cient
for this; wherefore &s;ince it has been
evidently demon&s;trated that the material
part of this Univer&s;e is finite in its extent.
If the World had la&s;ted from all Eterni|ty
the whole Matter of this Univer&s;e had
been long before this time ama&s;s'd in the
<HI>common Center of Gravity,</HI> and had there
made a lifele&s;s Heap; which not having
happened it's plain this World has not la|&s;ted
from all Eternity, nor can of it&s;elf
continue to all Eternity. And it's not un|likely
that the va&s;t if not immen&s;e di&s;tan|ces
of the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> from us and one ano|ther,
has been de&s;ign'd to retard this Effect
as long as the de&s;igns of Providence may
require.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. In the former part of this
<HI>Chapter</HI> I have demon&s;trated the impo&s;&s;i|bility
of the <HI>Mechanical</HI> production of <HI>Ani|mals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> and I &s;hall have Oc|ca&s;ion
in the following <HI>Chapter</HI> to make it
evident, that ev'ry generated <HI>Animal</HI> is
produc'd from a preexi&s;tent <HI>Animalcul</HI> of
<PB N="61" REF="212">
the &s;ame <HI>Species,</HI> and that ev'ry <HI>Vegetable</HI>
ari&s;es from a &s;mall Plant of the &s;ame kind.
And it is impo&s;&s;ible it can be otherwi&s;e
upon our Adver&s;ary's <HI>Scheme</HI> of admitting
nothing but Matter and Motion, for if
<HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> cannot be produc'd
from the&s;e, (and I have clearly prov'd
they cannot) they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have
been from all Eternity. And con&s;equent|ly
that all the <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> that
have exi&s;ted or &s;hall exi&s;t, have actually
been all included in the fir&s;t of ev'ry <HI>Spe|cies;</HI>
or which is the &s;ame thing, that
pitching upon any one <HI>individual</HI> of ei|ther
kind now exi&s;tent, that all the <HI>Ani|mals</HI>
or <HI>Vegetables</HI> that proceed from it
were included in it, and it, with all the&s;e
was included in that one from which it
proceeded, and &s;o on infinitely backwards;
and con&s;equently &s;ince there is no new
production, all that are or ever have been
of that <HI>Species</HI> were once actually together
included in one infinitely remote from
this now pitch'd upon. And that at any
finitely or infinitely di&s;tant time (if they
<PB N="62" REF="213">
have &s;o long exi&s;ted) from their Genera|tion
or Production, all the <HI>Animals</HI> in|cluded
in the fir&s;t of ev'ry <HI>Species</HI> were
there moving and living <HI>Animalculs,</HI> and
all <HI>Vegetables</HI> included in the fir&s;t of ev'ry
Kind, were there actually growing and
encrea&s;ing &s;mall Plants. Now &s;ince every
<HI>Animal</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> has been prov'd to
con&s;i&s;t of <HI>Organs</HI> in Number infinite (tho'
if the Organs of <HI>Animals</HI> be only finite
in Number, it will as effectually &s;erve our
pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.) It is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;i|ble
any of the <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> or <HI>Vege|tables</HI>
&s;hou'd have exi&s;ted from all Eterni|ty;
for then their Number mu&s;t have
been infinitely many, and the <HI>Animalculs</HI>
and &s;mall Plants, being <HI>Organical</HI> Bodies
and con&s;i&s;ting of parts, and tho&s;e infinite|ly
many too, and being all included in
the fir&s;t of every <HI>Species,</HI> or tho&s;e infi|nitely
di&s;tant from the pre&s;ent <HI>Individu|als,</HI>
the&s;e fir&s;t ones of ev'ry <HI>Species</HI> mu&s;t
of nece&s;&s;ity have been infinitely big, for
infinitely many <HI>Organical</HI> Bodies how
&s;mall &s;oever, ama&s;s'd together in one Bo|dy,
<PB N="63" REF="214">
mu&s;t make that Body infinitely big;
&s;o that unle&s;s we cou'd admit the fir&s;t of
ev'ry <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> to
be infinitely big (and how ab&s;urd &s;uch an
<HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> is, I leave the Reader to judge)
It is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that <HI>Animals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> &s;hou'd have been from all
Eternity; neither can I &s;ee how this Ar|gument
can be evaded, if we admit all
<HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> to proceed from
preexi&s;tent &s;mall <HI>Individuals</HI> of the &s;ame
Species, included in the fir&s;t of each kind.
And it is impo&s;&s;ible this can be otherwi&s;e
upon our Adver&s;aries Scheme, if the <HI>Me|chanical</HI>
Production of the&s;e be impo&s;&s;ible,
which I think I have clearly demon|&s;trated.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. Had the World la&s;ted from
<HI>all Eternity</HI> as it now is, it is altogether
impo&s;&s;ible but that <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences</HI>
mu&s;t have been brought to a far greater
Perfection than they have as yet attain'd.
Let us take for In&s;tance the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI>
it is certain this Science has been more im|prov'd
within the&s;e two hundred Years, than
<PB N="64" REF="215">
in all the time pa&s;t before that, &s;ince we have
any Records; and two or three hundred
Years more, going on at the rate of
tho&s;e la&s;t pa&s;t, may carry 'em to a height
which we now cannot imagine. Now it
is altogether impo&s;&s;ible the Improvements
already made &s;hou'd be lo&s;t, &s;eeing they
contain things &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
the <HI>Accommodation</HI> of Mankind; they will as
&s;oon forget the u&s;e of Hou&s;es and Cloaths,
as the Advantages to be reap'd from this
<HI>Science;</HI> wherefore had the World Eter|nally
been, this Science had been brought
to its utmo&s;t Perfection long e'er now.
It may be alleged that <HI>Inundations, Delu|ges,
Wars</HI> and <HI>Pe&s;tilencies</HI> might have de|&s;troyed
all the former Emprovements, and
then we &s;hou'd have been left to begin a|new.
As for <HI>Deluges,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible they
&s;hou'd have been Univer&s;al, <HI>i. e.</HI> Natu|rally
and Mechanically impo&s;&s;ible; for
the only <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> Account of an <HI>Uni|ver&s;al
Deluge</HI> hitherto a&s;&s;ign'd, <HI>viz.</HI> that
of Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s, depends entirely upon
the Principles of Gravitation, which have
<PB N="65" REF="216">
been proved not to be <HI>Mechanical;</HI> and
&s;ince there cou'd be no <HI>Univer&s;al Deluge</HI>
naturally, (and to allow a Principle above
Nature or the e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of <HI>Mecha|ni&s;m,</HI>
is to yield the Cau&s;e) particular In|undations,
cou'd never have been &s;ufficient
to have obliterated the remains of Scien|ces,
particularly of this one, which by In|&s;criptions
on <HI>Medals,</HI> by the Ruins of
<HI>Architecture,</HI> by <HI>Pillars, In&s;truments,</HI> and
<HI>Machins,</HI> might have been pre&s;erv'd in de|&s;pite
of every thing but an Univer&s;al Con|flagration.
Be&s;ides, it's meerly precarious,
to &s;ay there have been Deluges that have
done any con&s;iderable Damage, to the
whole rational Creation, and may be de|ny'd
with the &s;ame Rea&s;on it is affirm'd,
&s;ince it is certain we have heard of none
of any con&s;iderable Con&s;equence. It's true
there happen'd an <HI>Univer&s;al Deluge</HI> in
<HI>Noah's</HI> Days; but be&s;ides, as I formerly &s;aid,
that this was not brought about naturally,
we know not, if this and other Sciences, had
arriv'd at any great Perfection before this
Deluge happen'd. So that we are not
<PB N="66" REF="217">
certain if the Perfection of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sci|ences</HI>
has been much retarded upon this
account. Wars and Pe&s;tilences, it's true,
have been and may be, but tho&s;e do not
happen univer&s;ally over the whole World
at the &s;ame time; and there are always
&s;ome Countries and many particular Per|&s;ons
who e&s;cape; &s;o that is impo&s;&s;ible the&s;e
things cou'd have obliterated all the Re|mains
of <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences.</HI> I believe it
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible by any means, except
<HI>Annihilation,</HI> or a general Conflagration,
&s;o to deface the Memory and Remains of
all our modern Improvements, that &s;ome
of 'em &s;hou'd not la&s;t at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and
Years to come; and yet it's certain we have
no evident Foot&s;teps of Improvements ol|der
than three or four thou&s;and Years. In
&s;hort, this Argument holds good again&s;t
ev'ry thing but <HI>Univer&s;al Deluges;</HI> and to
admit or &s;uppo&s;e any &s;uch to have been,
is to yield the Cau&s;e, &s;ince it's impo&s;&s;ible
to explain &s;uch by the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI>
or to account for them by Matter and Mo|tion
as things are now &s;ettled; and to
<PB N="67" REF="218">
quit the&s;e, or to allow any thing to have
happen'd contrary to them, is to admit
<HI>Powers</HI> &s;uperiour to 'em, which for ought
we know might have produc'd that which
they can now &s;o powerfully alter. And
tho' <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences</HI> may have been at
a &s;tand for many Ages in &s;ome Countries,
yet that is nothing to the whole Globe.
For &s;ince that Principle which prompts &s;ome
Men to improve <HI>Arts</HI> or <HI>Sciences</HI> they are
inclin'd to, &s;prings naturally in their Minds,
according to the <HI>Scheme</HI> of our Adver&s;a|ries,
and is neither imprinted upon them,
nor were the things them&s;elves reveal'd to
them, by any &s;uperiour Beings; this Prin|ciple
in an infinity of Ages, without any
<HI>Univer&s;al Deluge,</HI> or ev'n any particular
one of any great extent, mu&s;t have of
Nece&s;&s;ity brought Arts and Sciences, and
the other Accommodations of Life,
to a much greater Perfection than we &s;ee
they have now attain'd. From all which
duly weigh'd, it's plain this World has
not Eternally been as it is now. And
indeed, the Accounts of our Emprove|ments
<PB N="68" REF="219">
an&s;wer very well to the time, a&s;|&s;ign'd
by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for the Creation of the
World.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. If the Number of any <HI>genera|ted</HI>
thing, which we behold on this Globe,
does either encrea&s;e or dimini&s;h continu|ally,
in any finite Number of Years how
great &s;oever, by any finite Number how
&s;mall &s;oever, then this World cou'd not
have been from all Eternity in the pre&s;ent
&s;tate we now behold it. For had it en|creas'd
in any finite Number of Years how
great &s;oever, by any Number how &s;mall
&s;oever, long before this time their Num|ber
had been infinite; &s;o that this poor
<HI>M$l$-Hill</HI> of a <HI>Globe</HI> had not been able
to contain 'em: And had they decreas'd,
their Number had been none at all, <HI>i. e.</HI>
the whole Race had been extingui&s;hed.
But &s;ince neither of the&s;e has happened,
it's plain the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things has
not been for ever. It's not ea&s;ie to be|lieve
for in&s;tance, that the Race of Man|kind,
has been <HI>ebbing</HI> and <HI>flowing</HI> without
con&s;iderable encrea&s;es or diminutions, from
<PB N="69" REF="220">
all Eternity. We are certain <HI>Wars, Pe&s;ti|lences</HI>
and <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and the other means
of De&s;truction, have not been fewer for
the&s;e 300 Years by-pa&s;t; than ever they have
been &s;ince we have Records, and yet it's plain
the Number of Mankind has con&s;iderably
encrea&s;ed in that time. Sir <HI>William Pet|ty</HI>
from Ob&s;ervations on Birth's and Buri|als
has di&s;covered that in 360 Years the,
Ma&s;s of Mankind is doubled in the&s;e Coun|tries.
Had they thus encreas'd from all E|ternity
in other Countries, all the <HI>Planets</HI>
within our <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> had not been able to
have contain'd them by this time; yea if
in many <HI>millions</HI> of Years they had but
encreas'd by an Unity continually, their
Number had been infinite by this time.
But it's plain both the Number of Man|kind,
and that of other <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vege|tables,</HI>
mu&s;t have perpetually encreas'd, if
the World has been from all Eternity as it
is at pre&s;ent And &s;ince their Number is
but finite at pre&s;ent, it's evident this
World has not been for ever as now it is.
And indeed the pre&s;ent Number of Ani|mals
<PB N="70" REF="221">
does an&s;wer very well to the com|mon
<HI>Aera</HI> of the Creation. The&s;e two
la&s;t Arguments I have &s;ubjoin'd, not as
conclu&s;ive proofs of the Production of this
pre&s;ent Univer&s;e in time, but as concur|ring
Confirmations of the former Demon|&s;trations.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. La&s;tly, How improbable is
it that this World &s;hou'd have been from
all Eternity? Is there any thing we &s;ee
in any part of it, or ev'n in the whole,
that has any other Quality &s;uitable to that
<HI>Cardinal</HI> one of Self-exi&s;tence? We our
&s;elves are certainly the noble&s;t part of
this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> we are acquainted with; and
yet God knows how unfit any of us, or
even our whole Race is, to have &s;o ex|travagant
a Compliment be&s;tow'd upon us
as Self-exi&s;tence, when as we can &s;carce
be &s;aid to be at all, &s;o very a nothing our
Lives are in re&s;pect of <HI>Infinite Duration.</HI>
We might with as much Rea&s;on imagine
Mankind <HI>Omni&s;cient</HI> or <HI>Omnipotent,</HI> (which
we know too well he is not) as <HI>&s;elf-exi|&s;tent.</HI>

where one is, all the re&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily

all other Qualities &s;uitable to that of

is abundance in the World; for it's cer|tain
we can never determine any thing a|bout
what we never, or but very <HI>&s;light|ly</HI>

<PB N="75" REF="226">
live and dye ignorant of many Self-evi|dent
Truths, becau&s;e they never took the
Pains to con&s;ider them. But the being
or not being of a Deity, is a Matter of
that Moment to the Government of the
World, the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences there|of,
do &s;o nearly concern the Happine&s;s
or Mi&s;ery of every <HI>individual rational

the <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> of this <HI>great Truth, viz.</HI>
that there is a <HI>&s;upreme Being,</HI> who made
and governs this pre&s;ent <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things,
has employ'd the Care of many <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and

which agreed be&s;t with my manner of
<PB N="76" REF="227">

of a, ju&s;ter. <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and a more
genuine Explication of Nature, than was
known till of late. And I have cho&s;en this
way of rea&s;oning, the rather becau&s;e our
modern <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> have taken <HI>Sanctuary</HI>
within the Bounds of <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; II. All the Arguments of the <HI>pre|ceding
Chapter,</HI> are &s;o many, Proofs of
the Exi&s;tence of a <HI>&s;urpreme Power,</HI> who
made and governs this pre&s;ent <HI>Sy&s;tem of
things.</HI> For &s;ince this World, cou'd neither
be produc'd by the ca&s;ual <HI>Concour&s;e</HI> of
<HI>Atoms,</HI> neither cou'd have been from all
<HI>Eternity</HI> of it &s;elf, as it has been &s;uffici|ently
prov'd; and &s;ince that it now is, no
Body doubts, of Nece&s;&s;ity therefore, it
mu&s;t have been produc'd or created, &s;ome,
time or another, by &s;ome preexi&s;ting
Power. Now &s;ince there is nothing el&s;e
in being but <HI>this World,</HI> unle&s;s we admit
that <HI>&s;upreme Power</HI> we are now &s;peaking
of; and &s;ince it cou'd neither have been
produc'd from the <HI>fortuitous Concour&s;e of
Atoms,</HI> nor have been from all <HI>Eternity</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="228">
of <HI>it &s;elf;</HI> it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have been
produc'd by that <HI>&s;upreme Power,</HI> who&s;e
Being we now inquire into. Since then
this <HI>&s;upreme Power,</HI> of nece&s;&s;ity, mu&s;t have
created this beautiful <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things,
and &s;ince exi&s;ting independently, He mu&s;t
for ever be, and have been; therefore
that <HI>great Power,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily now
exi&s;t. All the Difficulty any rational Crea|ture
can have about the Exi&s;tence of a
<HI>Deity,</HI> is how to conceive his having for
ever been of him&s;elf without a Beginning.
Now if we could avoid this Difficulty, by
&s;aying that this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> was produc'd, by
the ca&s;ual meeting of <HI>Atoms,</HI> or by al|ledging
it to have for ever been of it &s;elf,
we might have &s;ome &s;light Pretence for
our <HI>Infidelity.</HI> But &s;ince this Difficulty,
does equally lye again&s;t all the&s;e three
Suppo&s;itions, (for if the World has been
produc'd by the <HI>ca&s;ual Concour&s;e of Atoms,</HI>
then <HI>a Void, Atoms,</HI> and <HI>Motion</HI> have for
ever been, without a Beginning, of 'em|&s;elves;
if it has been from all Eternity <HI>of
it&s;elf,</HI> as it is, then the Ca&s;e is plain, that
<PB N="78" REF="229">
we mu&s;t allow &s;omething to have been
without a beginning <HI>of it &s;elf.</HI>) Where|fore
I &s;ay, &s;ince the; very &s;ame Difficulty
equally and unavoidably, urges all the
three Suppo&s;itions; is it not more rea|fonable
and <HI>congruous,</HI> to allow that Being
to have been for ever of it &s;elf, without a
beginning, to whom we may a&s;cribe, and
who does nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;s all other &s;ui|table
Perfections; rather than either of
tho&s;e others, which we know are nei|ther
endow'd with, nor capable of, &s;uch
eminent and tran&s;cendent Qualitys? I
will not &s;ay with <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> that be|cau&s;e
in our Conception of a Being <HI>infi|nitely
perfect,</HI> there mu&s;t be included <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary</HI>
Exi&s;tence, that therefore &s;uch a
Being mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity <HI>actually</HI> exi&s;t. But
&s;ure I am, &s;ince our main Difficulty in
the Conception of the Exi&s;tence of a be|ing
<HI>ab&s;olutely perfect,</HI> is his nece&s;&s;ary Ex|i&s;tence,
or his having for ever been of
him&s;elf without a beginning; it is much
more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that Being to
have for ever been of him&s;elf who ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="79" REF="230">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all other &s;uitable Qua|lities,
than tho&s;e who neither po&s;&s;e&s;s, nor
are capable of any of them.</P>
<P>&sect;III. The <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> of <HI>Matter,</HI> is a
plain <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> of the <HI>Exi&s;tence of a
Deity.</HI> I believe no body doubts, that
there now exi&s;ts a Quantity of <HI>&s;olid Ma&s;s,</HI>
out of which the <HI>cele&s;tial and terre&s;trial</HI>
Bodies were form'd; and tho' perhaps in
our mo&s;t &s;olid Bodies, there be more
Pores than Parts, or more <HI>Vacuity</HI> than
<HI>Solidity,</HI> yet there is &s;till &s;ufficient, not
to permit us to doubt of the Exi&s;tence of
Matter. Wherefore &s;ince Matter now a|ctually
is, I wou'd gladly learn how
it fir&s;t exi&s;ted. It cou'd never have been
of it &s;elf, &s;ince we are certain, that it
is de&s;titute of all <HI>active</HI> Qualities what|&s;oever;
it cannot move of <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> nor when
put in motion can it re&s;t of <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> nor
of <HI>it&s;elf</HI> change it's Cour&s;e, nor alter it's
Direction; it can neither change it's
<HI>Figure,</HI> nor <HI>Colour,</HI> nor <HI>Situation;</HI> in a
word, it is endu d with no Property but Inactivity,
which is but a Negation. How
<PB N="80" REF="231">
ab&s;urd is it then, to imagine it cou'd have
brought <HI>it&s;elf</HI> into Being, when it can
do ju&s;t nothing <HI>of it&s;elf?</HI> We may as rea|&s;onably
imagine that <HI>Nonentity,</HI> &s;hou'd
bring it&s;elf to become a po&s;itive Being,
as conceive it po&s;&s;ible that Matter &s;hou'd
of <HI>it&s;elf</HI> for ever have been. Be&s;ides, ad|mitting
Matter to have been for ever of
it&s;elf, yet this will not &s;olve half the
Difficulties, ari&s;ing in the Formation and
Production of the pre&s;ent State of things,
as has been &s;hewn in the <HI>preceding Chap|ter,</HI>
and &s;hall be now farther illu&s;trated,
Whereas the admitting of an <HI>infinitely
Powerful and perfect Being</HI> to have for <HI>e|ver</HI>
been, and to have created the <HI>&s;olid
Ma&s;s,</HI> and out of it, fram'd this wonder|ful
<HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of Things, contracts all the
Difficulties of Nature into this one of
his <HI>Exi&s;tence.</HI> For as to the Difficulties of
Creation, they vani&s;h quite, before <HI>infi|nite</HI>
Power, for Power implies a Capacity
to act, and <HI>infinite</HI> Power a Capacity to
act every thing not involving a Contra|diction.
Wherefore &s;ince Matter now
<PB N="81" REF="232">
actually is, and yet it neither cou'd have
been for ever of it&s;elf, nor had it for e|ver
been, wou'd that remove the Difficul|ties
ari&s;ing in the Formation of this pre|&s;ent
<HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things, but on the contrary
wou'd multiplie 'em. Is it not much more
rea&s;onable then, to admit an infinitely wi&s;e
Being to have for ever been <HI>of him&s;elf?</HI>
whereby all the Difficulties, in the con|ceiving
the Manner of the Production of
this <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> do vani&s;h at once.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. It has been formerly &s;hewn, that
this <HI>Univer&s;e</HI> was not form'd by the
&s;ame Laws it now is govern'd,, and which
it's &s;everal Parts in their Actions do now
obey; and therefore of nece&s;&s;ity there
mu&s;t have been &s;ome Power &s;uperior
to, and di&s;tinct from, that of Matter,
which form'd this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> at fir&s;t, and pre|&s;crib'd
Laws for it's Parts afterwards to
ob&s;erve. We &s;ee all the Changes that
now happen in this material World, are
according to the Laws e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
<HI>fir&s;t Chapter.</HI> But this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of Things
cou'd never have been brought into it's
<PB N="82" REF="233">
pre&s;ent Order, by the now e&s;tabli&s;hed
Laws of Nature, (ev'n admitting Matter
to have been <HI>eternally exi&s;tent of it&s;elf</HI>) as
I have abundantly &s;hewn in the <HI>fir&s;t Chap|ter;</HI>
neither one, nor all of the&s;e Laws
were &s;ufficient to have &s;eparated, that
thin and rare fluid of <HI>Light,</HI> from the other
gro&s;&s;er and more den&s;e ones, and ama&s;s'd
it in the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars;</HI> neither did
the Laws of &s;pecifick Gravities obtain in
the <HI>Formation</HI> and <HI>Situation</HI> of the inner
Parts of our <HI>Earth,</HI> and the other <HI>Planets;</HI>
nor in the <HI>Separation</HI> and <HI>Situation</HI> of the
&s;everal Fluids thereof. By none of the
known Laws of Motion, was the <HI>Num|ber,
Magnitudes,</HI> or Di&s;tances of the <HI>fixt
Stars</HI> determin'd, the Figure, Number,
Den&s;ities, Gravitations upon one ano|ther,
Situations and Order of the <HI>Pla|nets</HI>
adju&s;ted, the Number, Di&s;tances,
and Magnitudes of the <HI>Satellits of Jupi|ter,</HI>
the Form and bulk of the <HI>Annulus</HI> of
<HI>Saturn</HI> limited. In a word, the whole pro|ce&s;s
of the <HI>Formation</HI> of the <HI>cele&s;tial</HI> and
<HI>terre&s;trial</HI> World, as to their principal
<PB N="83" REF="234">
Parts and Arrangements, was brought a|bout
by none of the Laws of Motion and
<HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> that now obtain in this &s;et|tled
&s;tate of things; or at mo&s;t the&s;e
Laws had but a &s;mall Share in their Pro|duction.
Wherefore &s;ince this beautiful
&s;tate of things, has not been for ever <HI>of
it&s;elf,</HI> nor cou'd be form'd by the Powers
and Laws of Nature, it is plain it has
been, produc'd by &s;omething &s;uperiour to
Matter and it's Qualities, and con&s;equent|ly
by that <HI>&s;upreme</HI> Being, into who&s;e <HI>Ex|i&s;tence</HI>
we are now inquiring. And truly
from what has been here &s;aid, and a great
deal more of the &s;ame Nature alleg'd in
the <HI>fir&s;t Chapter,</HI> it is evident, we can
have no Notion of the <HI>Formation</HI> of this
pre&s;ent State of things, other than what
we have of a <HI>Planetary Clock,</HI> or any other
complicated <HI>Machin,</HI> form'd by the Hand
of a skilful <HI>Arti&s;t;</HI> where tho' the Rules
of Motion, and Laws of Nature, may
obtain, yet they are directed, and even
&s;ometimes contradicted, by the volunta|ry
Motions, and the de&s;ign'd Interpo&s;ings
<PB N="84" REF="235">
of <HI>free Agents.</HI> And tho' this no doubt,
be but a very faint Re&s;emblance of that
<HI>noble</HI> and glorious Work, yet it is the
be&s;t and mo&s;t adequate our <HI>Imaginations,</HI>
without runing upon evident Contradicti|ons,
can frame.</P>
<P>&sect; V. As the Formation and Di&s;po&s;ition
of the <HI>great Bodies</HI> of this Univer&s;e, did
nece&s;&s;arily require the Hand of a Being
infinitely powerful; &s;o likewi&s;e did their
fir&s;t Movement, and impre&s;s'd Motions,
demand the Impul&s;e of an almighty Hand,
to &s;et them fir&s;t a going. For &s;uppo&s;ing
the <HI>cele&s;tial</HI> Bodies already form'd, and
rang'd according to their &s;everal Di&s;tan|ces
from one another; yet without this
Impul&s;e, they had continu'd unactive, un|moving,
Heaps of Matter. Now it has
been already &s;hewn that no Particle of
Matter, nor any <HI>Combination</HI> of Particles,
can move them&s;elves and therefore it
was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that &s;omething
different from them&s;elves, &s;hou'd put
them in a motion, with a due Velocity
along the <HI>Tangents</HI> of their &s;everal <HI>Orbits;</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="236">
otherwi&s;e they had for ever continued in
the places, and at the Di&s;tances, they
were at fir&s;t &s;et. Wherefore &s;ince it is
certain that the&s;e <HI>glorious Bodies</HI> have
been rowling about the&s;e four or five
thou&s;and Years; and &s;ince it hath been
demon&s;trated that they are not &s;elf-mo|ving,
being <HI>&s;olid Ma&s;&s;es of Matter;</HI> &s;ince
it has likewi&s;e been &s;hewn, that they
have not mov'd from all Eternity <HI>of them|&s;elves,</HI>
it is plain, that they have been
&s;et a going by &s;ome powerful Hand; and
what Hand &s;ufficient for &s;uch a Work,
but his who is infinite, both in Strength
and Skill; and con&s;equently he who did
&s;o <HI>great and glorious</HI> things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
<HI>be.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; VI. Not only the <HI>Formation,</HI> and
fir&s;t <HI>impul&s;e</HI> of the great Bodies of this
Univer&s;e, along the <HI>Tangents</HI> of their <HI>Or|bits,</HI>
but their <HI>Centripetal</HI> impul&s;es, where|by
their Revolutions or <HI>orbicular</HI> Motions
are perform'd, did, and &s;till do, require a
Power beyond that of Matter, and the
Laws of Nature, to the pre&s;ervation of
<PB N="86" REF="237">
their Motion. Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> and after him
Dr. <HI>Gregory,</HI> has demon&s;trated, that to
the Motion of any of the <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Bodies in
an <HI>Orbit,</HI> there is nece&s;&s;arily requir'd two
Impul&s;es, one along the <HI>Tangent</HI> of the <HI>Orbit,</HI>
another toward the Center, about which the
Body moves. The fir&s;t being once impre&s;s'd,
does continually per&s;evere, and needs no
more to be renew'd, as is evident from
the fir&s;t Law of Nature: The &s;econd con|tinually
draws the <HI>cele&s;tial</HI> Body from it's
<HI>rectilinear</HI> Motion, and forces it into a
<HI>curvilinear</HI> Orbit, &s;o that it mu&s;t be re|peated
ev'ry Minute of time. Now the&s;e
<HI>&s;econdary</HI> Impul&s;es ari&s;e from that <HI>Uni|ver&s;al
Principle of Attraction,</HI> whereby e|very
Particle of Matter, and all the Bo|dies
of this Univer&s;e tend toward one a|nother;
and by which the <HI>Sun</HI> being the
far greate&s;t Body of this our <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> draws
toward him the <HI>Planets,</HI> and they their
own <HI>Satellits;</HI> and without which they
wou'd for ever wander in right Lines.
But it has been demon&s;trated in <HI>the fir&s;t
Chapter,</HI> that this Principle whereby the
<PB N="87" REF="238">
<HI>Revolutions</HI> of the&s;e glorious Bodies are
perform'd, is independent of the Laws of
<HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> and only accidental (noways
<HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI>) to Matter, but implanted there|in
by &s;ome extrin&s;ick Power, and con&s;e|quently
(&s;ince it mu&s;t be repeated every
Minute) mu&s;t be perpetuated in it by &s;ome
uninterrupted Influence. And &s;eeing there
is nothing in Nature, but Matter and the
Powers thereof, unle&s;s we admit that &s;u|preme
Being for who&s;e Exi&s;tence we con|tend,
therefore the Revolutions of the
<HI>cele&s;tial</HI> Bodies in their &s;everal <HI>Orbits</HI> do
nece&s;&s;arily infer the Exi&s;tence of a Deity.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> does
nece&s;&s;arily infer the <HI>Exi&s;tence of a Dei|ty;</HI>
for it has been demon&s;trated in the
<HI>former Chapter,</HI> that all Animals are in
their own Natures <HI>perpetua mobilia,</HI> that
they have &s;ome Principle above the Pow|ers
of Matter that governs their Moti|ons;
it has likewi&s;e been &s;hewn, that
every <HI>individual Plant</HI> and <HI>Animal</HI> is a
<HI>Machine</HI> of an infinite Number of Or|gans;
that no Animal is or can be pro|duc'd
<PB N="88" REF="239">
or generated by the Force of Mat|ter,
and Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> (that all <HI>Ani|mals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> that ever were or
&s;hall be, were all created or formed at once,
&s;hall be afterwards &s;hewn) and that all
the&s;e are ab&s;olutely unaccountable from
the Laws of Motion, and con&s;equently,
mu&s;t &s;pring from a principle independent
of, and altogether above the Powers and
Properties of Matter. Now when ever
we for&s;ake the Powers of Matter, and
the Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> we nece&s;&s;arily
mu&s;t have Recour&s;e, to the <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> of
&s;ome Power &s;uperiour to, and indepen|dent
of Matter, and all it's Laws and Pro|perties;
and con&s;equently to that <HI>infinite|ly
Perfect Being,</HI> into who&s;e Exi&s;tence we
are now inquiring, &s;ince there is nothing
be&s;ides Matter and its Properties in the
World, unle&s;s we admit the Exi&s;tence of
that <HI>&s;upreme Being.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The <HI>&s;pontaneous</HI> Motions of
<HI>irrational,</HI> and the voluntary Motions of
<HI>rational</HI> Animals, the <HI>Freedom of Will,</HI>
and Liberty of choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing in the
<PB N="89" REF="240">
latter, and in a word all the <HI>Appearances</HI>
of Nature, which are above the Powers
of <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> (which are innumerable)
are &s;o many undeniable Proofs of the <HI>Be|ing</HI>
of a <HI>God.</HI> For &s;ince this pre&s;ent <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI>
of Things, has not been from all Eternity
<HI>of it&s;elf,</HI> and &s;ince the&s;e are allow'd to
be above the Powers of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> they
mu&s;t have been produc'd by &s;ome Power

alone does great and marvellous things,</HI>

he that brought about all the&s;e glo|rious
things, <HI>who alone does Wonders,</HI>
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily <HI>be.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; IX. The Pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Being</HI>
and Faculties, both of the animate and
inanimate Part of this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things, does
nece&s;&s;arily require the Power, and con&s;e|quently
the <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> of a Being ab&s;olute|ly
perfect, <HI>i. e.</HI> of a Deity. For &s;ince this
<HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things has not been from all E|ternity
of it&s;elf, as we now behold it, and
<PB N="90" REF="241">
&s;ince there is no nece&s;&s;ary Connexion be|tween
the being of any one Part thereof,
or of it's Faculties, this pre&s;ent Moment,
and their being the next, and &s;ince we &s;ee
both have been pre&s;erv'd for a con&s;idera|ble
time: This pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Being</HI>
and Faculties of things, can never be ac|counted
for, without having Recour&s;e
to an <HI>Almighty</HI> Power, which may be &s;uf|ficient
for all things not involving a Con|tradiction;
and therefore that <HI>Omnipotent</HI>
Being indow'd with this Power, mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<HI>be.</HI> Let us take, for in&s;tance,
the Pre&s;ervation, of a Body moving, in
it's Motion: Ev'ry <HI>motive</HI> Force (as all
other Quantity) may be &s;uppos'd divided
into &s;everal Parts (the Sum of all which
mu&s;t be equal to the <HI>motive</HI> Force fir&s;t
propos'd.) This motive Force being im|pre&s;s'd
on a giv'n Body, mu&s;t produce a
Motion therein equal to the Motion pro|duced
by all the &s;everal Parts thereof, im|pre&s;s'd,
either at once, or at different times.
Now the Motion produc'd by any one
Part of this Motive Force, may be de&s;troy'd
<PB N="91" REF="242">
(by the Oppo&s;ition of an equal Body, im|pell'd
with a Force equal to that Part of
the Motive Force we wou'd de&s;troy, but
with a contrary Direction) the re&s;t of the
Motion remaining unaltered; therefore
the &s;everal Parts of any impre&s;s'd Motion
have no <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Dependence upon one
another, &s;ince one can be de&s;troyed with|out
the re&s;t; and con&s;equently the Per|&s;everation
of a Body in Motion, does not
depend upon the Nature of Body, nor
upon the Nature of Motion, but upon
&s;ome Principle <HI>extrin&s;ick</HI> to both, <HI>viz.</HI>
that fir&s;t Law of Nature (pre&s;crib'd by
the Author thereof) whereby Bodies as
much as in them is, per&s;evere in that
&s;tate of Motion or re&s;t they are put in,
unle&s;s forced to change the &s;ame by &s;ome
<HI>foreign</HI> impre&s;s'd Violence. Moreover,
Motion may be con&s;idered, as the <HI>Tran&s;|lation</HI>
of a Body from one place into a|nother.
Now there is no imaginable con|nexion
between a Bodies being in this
place now, and in another hereafter; and
therefore the Per&s;everation of a Body
<PB N="92" REF="243">
in motion, is not all <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to it. La&s;t|ly,
&s;ince an impre&s;s'd Force is not at
all permanent in the Body mov'd, but
con&s;i&s;ts in the meer <HI>Action,</HI> and it's Ef|ficacy
is &s;pent that very Moment it is
impre&s;s'd; it is evident therefore, that
the Per&s;everation of a Body in motion, is
neither owing to the motive Force, nor
to the Body mov'd. But to that <HI>vis in|erciae,</HI>
which is implanted therein by &s;ome|thing
di&s;tinct from Matter and its e&s;&s;enti|al
Properties, <HI>i. e.</HI> to <HI>God Almighty,</HI> the
Author of Nature and all its Productions.
After the &s;ame manner in the de&s;cent of
heavy Bodies the <HI>Acceleration</HI> of their Mo|tion
may be re&s;embled (or is <HI>equivalent</HI>)
to the <HI>Acceleration</HI> of a Body impelled by
a con&s;tant equable Force, acting ev'ry
Minute equally, and by that means ad|ding
a new Velocity to the former. Now,
any one, or any Number of the&s;e Impul|&s;es
may be de&s;troyed without the re&s;t;
and therefore the &s;everal Impul&s;es, by
which heavy Bodies de&s;cend, do not de|pend
upon one another, &s;ince by contra|ry
<PB N="93" REF="244">
equal Impul&s;es they may be de&s;troyed,
and con&s;equently the Degrees of the <HI>Ac|celeration</HI>
of the Motion of heavy Bodies
de&s;cending, have no nece&s;&s;ary Connexion
one upon another, and &s;o the Pre&s;ervation
of this Faculty of Attraction in Matter
which is the Cau&s;e thereof does not depend
upon Matter, and therefore mu&s;t be a&s;cri|bed
to a higher Power. And the &s;ame may
be &s;aid of the Being of, (and of all the Fa|culties
not e&s;&s;ential to) Bodies; for the Be|ing
of any thing now, does by no Means
infer it's being the next Minute, unle&s;s the
thing be <HI>&s;elf-exi&s;tent</HI> (which cannot be true
of Matter, nor of any of it's Faculties, as
has been formerly &s;hewn) or unle&s;s Time
or Place cou'd change the Natures of
things, which is ab&s;ur'd. And univer&s;ally,
whatever is not e&s;&s;ential to a thing, that
thing can be without; whatever any thing
can be without, the Continuation of that
is not owing to it, (I mean of inanimate
things) <HI>i. e.</HI> to it's Nature, and con&s;e|quently
requires &s;ome Power above it, for
the Cau&s;e of it's Continuation, there, be|ing
<PB N="94" REF="245">
no nece&s;&s;ary Connexion betwixt Time
or Place, and the Being or Faculties of
Things; and con&s;equently their Pre&s;erva|tion
is owing to &s;ome Power above tho&s;e
of Matter, <HI>i. e. to him in whom we live,
move, and have our Being.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; X. But that Argument for the <HI>Ex|i&s;tence</HI>
of a <HI>Being infinitely perfect,</HI> who
made and governs this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things,
which of all others affects me mo&s;t, is
that it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible, this Uni|ver&s;e
cou'd have been better contriv'd or
more compleatly fini&s;hed, than it is, had
<HI>infinite Wi&s;dom</HI> fir&s;t actually de&s;ign'd it,
and then put the De&s;ign in execution. Or
which is the &s;ame, there are legible and
indelible <HI>Characters</HI> of <HI>infinite Wi&s;dom,</HI> in
the <HI>Contrivance</HI> of the whole, and of the
&s;everal Parts of this admirable Fabrick of
the <HI>Univer&s;e;</HI> and it is altogether impo&s;|&s;ible
for the united skill of Men and An|gels,
to mend any one Part, or to con|trive
it better, or even to find out any
real Defect therein, due Regard being
had to the univer&s;al Benefit of the whole
<PB N="95" REF="246">
<HI>Sy&s;tem;</HI> for in the Contrivance and Ad|ju&s;tment
of the &s;everal Parts of this no|ble
Machin, where the Choice is various,
and &s;ometimes infinite, that one is pitch'd
upon, which alone cou'd bring, the mo&s;t
advantages to the whole, or which
only cou'd bring about the de&s;ign'd Ef|fect.
This is a very large Subject, and
to treat it according to it's Dignity re|quires
more Room, than the Limits I
have pre&s;crib'd to my &s;elf will admit.
However, I &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate
the &s;ame in the following Particulars. But
fir&s;t of all it will be convenient to lay
down a general <HI>Scheme</HI> of this noble Stru|cture.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. Let us then conceive the <HI>Mun|dan
Space,</HI> or the univer&s;al Place of all
Bodies, to be boundle&s;s in it's Extent, or
indefinite in its Dimen&s;ions, and in it at
va&s;t Di&s;tances from one another, the fixt
Stars (huge luminous Bodies, like the Sun)
to be plac'd, keeping always the &s;ame
Di&s;tances from one another, and moving
only (perhaps) about their own <HI>Axes;</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="247">
about each of the&s;e let us imagine &s;e|veral
Bodies like our <HI>Planets;</HI> rowling in
&s;everal <HI>Orbits</HI> at &s;everal Di&s;tances; and
about tho&s;e le&s;&s;er ones <HI>Analogous</HI> to the
<HI>Satellits</HI> of our <HI>Planets.</HI> Each of the&s;e
fixt Stars with their Circumambient <HI>Pla|net-like
Orbs,</HI> con&s;tituting that which is
call'd a <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of the <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Bodies. And
how many &s;uch there, mu&s;t be in the va&s;t
Extent of Space, a naked eye in a cloud|le&s;s
Night, may give us &s;ome faint <HI>Glimps,</HI>
but much more a good large <HI>Tele&s;cope</HI> di|rected
toward that Region of the Skie,
which is call'd the <HI>milky way.</HI> Our Num|bers
fall very &s;hort here, and our <HI>Arithme|tick</HI>
can &s;carce give us an <HI>idea</HI> of the
va&s;t Quantity of <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> that adorn this
<HI>&s;tupenduous</HI> Piece of <HI>Architecture;</HI> and yet
no doubt their Number is finit, and they
are all included in a bounded Exten&s;ion;
for Matter &s;eems not capable in it's Na|ture
of being infinitely propagated. More|over,
let us conceive the glorious Body
of the Sun, fixt in the Center of Gravity
(or near it) of this our <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> and in the
<PB N="97" REF="248">
common Center of Motion (or <HI>focus</HI>) of
all the <HI>Planetary Orbits.</HI> And then next
to him <HI>Mercury</HI> makes his <HI>oval round,</HI>
but &s;o near him, that we can rarely ob|tain
a di&s;tinct View of him, he being
&s;wallow'd up almo&s;t, in the Light of the
<HI>Sun.</HI> Next to <HI>Mercury,</HI> is our beautiful
Morning and Evening Star <HI>Venus:</HI> next
<HI>Venus,</HI> our <HI>Earth,</HI> with it's Attendant the
<HI>Moon,</HI> perform their friendly Cour&s;e, and
mea&s;ure out the Year. Beyond our <HI>Earth
Mars</HI> &s;ingly and alone, revolves about the
&s;ame Center; next to <HI>Mars, Jupiter,</HI> the
large&s;t of the <HI>Planets,</HI> with his four <HI>Satel|lits</HI>
turn round in concert; and la&s;t
of all, <HI>Saturn</HI> with his five Guards, and
his &s;urrounding <HI>Annulus</HI> or <HI>Ring,</HI> de&s;cribes
the remote&s;t <HI>Orbit,</HI> and concludes our
<HI>Sy&s;tem.</HI></P>

have we here? How &s;imple, and yet
how wonderful are the Works of Nature?
Such like are all the Effects of infinite
Wi&s;dom, her Foundations are plain and
&s;imple, but her <HI>&s;uper&s;tructure,</HI> various and
wonderful. Her Cau&s;es few, her Effects
innumerable. Her Cour&s;e the ea&s;ie&s;t and
&s;horte&s;t Po&s;&s;ible, and her Means the &s;ewe&s;t

Let us. but con&s;ult the Books of the old
<HI>A&s;tronomers,</HI> and we will then have &s;uffici|ent
Ground to admire the frugal Simplicity
of Nature, in this neat, compact <HI>Sy&s;tem;</HI>

were to be expected below, or to
be peep'd at by &s;ome poor Paltry Fellows

out this poor Corner, while the other
more glorious, great and noble Parts, are

mu&s;t have a great Opinion of them&s;elves,
and of their own Habitation, who can
think &s;o poorly of the re&s;t of the Univer&s;e.
But allowing the <HI>Planets</HI> to be inhabited,
and that the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> have their <HI>Planets</HI>

Degrees of Heat and Light they en|joy;
as al&s;o the different Vici&s;&s;itudes of Day
and Night; and the Sea&s;ons of the Year.
<HI>Mercury</HI> is three times nearer the <HI>Sun,</HI> than
we, and con&s;equently enjoys nine times
as much Heat and Light, he never remo|ving
thirty eight Degrees from that va&s;t

Hours, and &s;o her Day is but one Hour le&s;s

the <HI>Axe</HI> of his Rotation to the Plane of his
<HI>Orbit,</HI> and con&s;equently enjoys a perpe|tual
<HI>Equinox,</HI> but no Vici&s;&s;itudes of Sea|&s;ons;
he receives but the third Part of
our Light and Heat. <HI>Jupiter</HI> likewi&s;e en|joys
a perpetual <HI>Equinox,</HI> and a Day of|ten
Hours, but receives only the twenty

Plane wou'd be immoveable, or always
the &s;ame, and who&s;e Inclination to the
Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick</HI> wou'd never vary;
but by the Action of the <HI>Sun</HI> upon the
<HI>Moon,</HI> all the&s;e Effects are di&s;turb'd, for
&s;he neither di&s;cribes equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal
Times by a <HI>Ray</HI> from the Center of the
Earth, but &s;omewhat larger ones in her
<HI>Conjunctions</HI> and <HI>Oppo&s;itions</HI> with the Sun
than in her <HI>Quadratures.</HI> Neither is her
<HI>Orbit</HI> always <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> the &s;ame, nor is the
<HI>Earth</HI> in any of the <HI>Foci</HI> of her <HI>Orbits;</HI>
for they are more <HI>Curve</HI> about the <HI>Qua|dratures,</HI>
and le&s;s toward her <HI>Conjunctions</HI>

the Situation of the Plane of her <HI>Orbit,</HI>
and it's Inclination to the Plane of the
<HI>Ecliptick,</HI> varies every Moment, and
all the&s;e Uncertainties and Aberrations,
are multiply'd by her nearer or remo|ter
Di&s;tances from the <HI>Sun,</HI> be&s;ides a
great many other Irregularities too tedi|ous
here to relate. Upon the account of
all which, it has been &s;o very hard for <HI>A&s;tronomers,</HI>
to reduce her Motions to Rule,
and to expre&s;s 'em in Numbers; and yet
all the&s;e Irregularities are wonderfully ac|counted
for, from the Action of the <HI>Sun</HI>
and <HI>Earth</HI> upon her, upon the common Sup|po&s;ition
of the Law of Attraction, ev'n to
a Nicety, beyond which Ob&s;ervation can|not
di&s;tingui&s;h, as is evident from Mr.
<HI>Newton's Theory</HI> of the <HI>Moon,</HI> printed in
Dr. <HI>Gregory's A&s;tronomy,</HI> which is a &s;ur|pri&s;ing
Confirmation of the Truth of
that Principle. On the other hand, the
Force of the <HI>Sun,</HI> but e&s;pecially of the
<HI>Moon,</HI> di&s;turbs the Motion of the <HI>Earth,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="265">
as is evident from our <HI>Tides,</HI> which do
&s;o exactly follow the Motions of the
<HI>Moon,</HI> that he who knows the former,
with &s;ome few collateral Circum&s;tances,
cannot be ignorant of the latter; for when
the <HI>Moon</HI> comes to the vertical Point of
any Place, we have a <HI>Tide</HI> there, as al&s;o
on the Place <HI>diametrically</HI> oppo&s;ite to it;
this <HI>Tide</HI> is greater at the <HI>Conjunctions</HI> and
<HI>Oppo&s;itions</HI> of the <HI>Moon</HI> to the <HI>Sun,</HI> than
at her <HI>Quadratures,</HI> and greate&s;t of all at
the <HI>Equinoxes,</HI> e&s;pecially if the <HI>Moon</HI> is
then in her <HI>Perigeum,</HI> the Rea&s;ons of all
which I have &s;ugge&s;ted in <HI>the fir&s;t Chap|ter.</HI>
And what is here &s;aid of the <HI>Earth,</HI>
with re&s;pect to the <HI>Moon,</HI> may be with

<P>&sect; XVII. That the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> are Bodies
like our <HI>Sun</HI> all the late <HI>A&s;tronomers</HI> a|gree,
for it's plain they &s;hine by their own
Light, &s;ince it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible,
that the Light of the <HI>Sun,</HI> &s;hou'd be &s;ent
to them, and tran&s;mitted to us, &s;o as to
make them appear &s;o lucid as we &s;ee them.
<PB N="115" REF="266">
We &s;ee how faintly in re&s;pect of &s;ome
of the <HI>fixt Stars, Saturn</HI> &s;hines for all his
Bulk; and yet his Di&s;tance is but a Point
in re&s;pect of the neare&s;t <HI>fixt Star,</HI> from
the <HI>Sun.</HI> The Rays of the <HI>Sun</HI> wou'd be
&s;o di&s;&s;ipated before they reach'd &s;o re|mote
an Object, that the be&s;t Eye of
the World, cou'd not by it, di&s;cover them.
Their Di&s;tance is &s;o great, that the be&s;t
<HI>Tele&s;cope,</HI> in&s;tead of magnifying 'em above
what they appear to the naked Eye (as
they do any Object, remov'd by any men&s;u|rable
Di&s;tance, how great &s;oever) does con|&s;iderably
le&s;&s;en them, &s;o that they appear
like lucid Points. Be&s;ides, tho' we in this
Globe, approach nearer them &s;ome twenty
four thou&s;and <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Earth, (or
188304000 Miles, allowing five thou|&s;and
Feet to the Mile) one time of the
Year than another, yet their <HI>Parallax</HI> is
&s;carce &s;en&s;ible, if any at all, which cou'd not
be, if they were at my moderate Di&s;tance:
By Mr. <HI>Hugen</HI>'s Computation, the Di&s;tance
of the <HI>Sun</HI> from us, is to the Di&s;tance of
the neare&s;t <HI>fixt Star</HI> from us, as 1 to
<PB N="116" REF="267">
27664, that is (allowing the Di&s;tance of
the <HI>Sun</HI> from us to, be 12000 <HI>Diameters</HI>
of the Earth, and a <HI>Diameter</HI> to be of 7846
Miles, according to the be&s;t Calculations)
the Di&s;tance of the neare&s;t <HI>fixt Star</HI> from
us, is at lea&s;t 2404520928000 Miles,
which a Cannon Bullet moving with the
Velocity it has, when parted from the
Month of the Piece, wou'd &s;pend almo&s;t
&s;even hundred thou&s;and Years to go thro'.
Since then, both the&s;e are true, that they
&s;hine by their own Light, and that they
are at &s;uch an immen&s;e Di&s;tance from us,
it is plain, they mu&s;t be <HI>Bodies</HI> like our
<HI>Sun;</HI> which wou'd be evident, cou'd they
be brought near us, or we near them, for it
is only the Di&s;tance that creates our doubt.
Now this being true, it is impo&s;&s;ible they
&s;hou'd be all in the Surface of the &s;ame
<HI>Sphere,</HI> &s;ince our <HI>Sun</HI> which is one of
'em, cannot be reduc'd to this Rule. Be|&s;ides,
their different Magnitudes, &s;hew
that they are at as immen&s;e Di&s;tances
from one another, as the neare&s;t of 'em
is from us. Let us but imagine our &s;elves
<PB N="117" REF="268">
remov'd 'at an equal Di&s;tance from the
<HI>Sun,</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> we &s;hould then certain|ly

for as to all the <HI>Planets,</HI> that we &s;ee now
attend the <HI>Sun,</HI> we &s;hou'd not have the
lea&s;t Glimp&s;e of them; both becau&s;e
their Light wou'd be too weak to affect
us, and becau&s;e all their Orbs wou'd be
united, in that one lucid point of the
<HI>Sun.</HI> In this Station, we &s;hou'd have no
occa&s;ion to imagin any Difference be|tween
one <HI>Star</HI> and another, but &s;hou'd
certainly conclude both <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>fixt Stars</HI>
of the &s;ame Nature; and knowing the Na|ture
of one, we &s;hou'd certainly conclude
the &s;ame of all the re&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that if one
was a lucid Globe of liquid Fire, &s;o wou'd
all the re&s;t be, and that they were at im|men&s;e
Di&s;tances from one another. Cer|tainly
if the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> actually had <HI>Pla|nets,</HI>
and they <HI>Satellits,</HI> yet at our Di|&s;tance
we cou'd &s;ee neither. Since then

(&s;ome of which I hinted before) that they
have Attendant <HI>Planets,</HI> and no po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="118" REF="269">
one to evict the contrary, we may &s;afely

like our <HI>Planets,</HI> they do move in a re|curring
<HI>Orbit,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> is in one of
the <HI>Foci</HI> of this <HI>Orbit,</HI> that by a Ray from
the <HI>Sun,</HI> they de&s;cribe equal <HI>Area</HI>'s in equal
Times, that the &s;ame <HI>Law of Gravitation</HI>
obtains in them, which does in the <HI>Pla|nets;</HI>
that their <HI>Periodical</HI> Times are cer|tain
and invariable, and that their Moti|ons
are regular, only their Cour&s;e in their
<HI>Orbits</HI> is not determin'd one way, but indif|ferently
&s;ome of 'em move one way, others
<PB N="119" REF="270">
another: They are al&s;o about the &s;ame
Bulk with the <HI>Planets,</HI> generally &s;peak|ing;
and like them are compact &s;olid
Bodies, but &s;urrounded with a va&s;tly
large thin Fluid, intermixt with &s;everal
gro&s;&s;er Particles, and compo&s;ing an irre|gular
unequally di&s;po&s;s'd, and uncertainly
agitated Ma&s;s; which is call'd its <HI>Atmo|&s;phere,</HI>
who&s;e <HI>Diameter,</HI> is ten or fifteen
Times as long as that of its Body. Be&s;ides
which, it has a long lucid <HI>Train,</HI> which is
rais'd in its Approach to the <HI>Sun,</HI> by the
Heat thereof, and extends &s;ometimes to four
hundred Thou&s;and Miles above its Body.
It is always oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Sun,</HI> becau&s;e
it is the thiner part of its <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> ex|tremely
rarified by his Rays; and &s;o rare
that the <HI>Stars</HI> may be &s;een through it.
This <HI>Tail</HI> accompanies it through its Cour&s;e
over all the <HI>Planetary Regions,</HI> encrea&s;ing
in its Approach to the <HI>Sun,</HI> and le&s;&s;ening
in its Rece&s;s. The&s;e <HI>Comets</HI> &s;ometimes
come &s;o near the <HI>Sun,</HI> as to be heated
to &s;uch a Degree that they cannot be|come
cool again, in many Thou&s;ands of
<PB N="120" REF="271">
Years. This with its violent Motion in a
<HI>Curve,</HI> which comes near to a &s;treight Line,
after it has pa&s;s'd its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and the
irregular Di&s;po&s;ition of the confu&s;s'd
Ma&s;s of its <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> makes it an un|fit
Habitation for Animals, that are not
in a &s;tate of Puni&s;hment, &s;o far as we can
conceive of the Nature of Animals. And
therefore &s;ome have thought it de&s;ign'd,
to &s;upply the Expence of Fluids in the
<HI>Sun</HI> and the <HI>Planets.</HI> But as I have before
hinted, this does not &s;eem &s;o very pro|bable,
becau&s;e Nature always &s;upplies
con&s;tant and regular Expences after a
con&s;tant and regular Manner. Now the
Returns of the&s;e Bodies are &s;o irregular
and uncertain, and we &s;o little feel the
Effects of the&s;e Returns (which of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
mu&s;t be felt, if the&s;e frightful Bo|dies
made the <HI>Reimbur&s;ement</HI> mention'd,
&s;ince the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> are recruited all
at once, or in a very &s;hort time, of all the
lo&s;s they have &s;uffer'd in their Fluids for
many Years before,) that I am afraid no
&s;uch benign Influences, are to be expect|ed
<PB N="121" REF="272">
from them. I readily grant, that there
may be &s;ome Clouds of Vapours &s;weep'd
off the <HI>Tails</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Comets,</HI> by the <HI>Sun</HI>
and <HI>Planets</HI> as they approach them. But
then, it is uncertain of what Nature the&s;e
Vapours are, for every Vapour will not
become a Fluid, unle&s;s its Parts be of
&s;uch a determin'd <HI>Figure</HI> and <HI>Size</HI> as the
Nature of Fluids require. Now it's certain,
that Heat will rai&s;e any Body into a Va|pour,
provided it be &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;olve
the Union of its Parts, and increa&s;e their
Bulk to a nece&s;&s;ary Dimen&s;ion: Moreover
its hardly accountable how the <HI>Sun</HI> &s;hou'd
draw from thence only the Fluid of Light,
the Earth, that of Water, the other <HI>Pla|nets</HI>
their proper Fluids; or if they were
&s;uppo&s;s'd to draw all <HI>promi&s;cuou&s;ly,</HI> how
the&s;e Effects can an&s;wer the De&s;ign, &s;ince
Water in the <HI>Sun,</HI> which wanted only
more of the Fluid of Light, wou'd be as
improper a Gue&s;t, as Fire on the Earth,
which wanted only more Water. I think
it is more probable, that the&s;e frightful
Bodies are the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Divine Ju&s;tice,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="273">
and in their Vi&s;its, lend us <HI>Benign</HI> or <HI>No|xious</HI>
Vapours, according to the De&s;igns
of Providence: that they may have brought,
and may &s;till bring about, the great <HI>Cata|&s;trophes</HI>
of our <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> by rai&s;ing of <HI>Tides,</HI>
changing the Figures, and the Po&s;itions
of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and the very Nature of
the <HI>Orbits</HI> them&s;elves: and that they may
be the Habitation of <HI>Animals</HI> in a &s;tate
of Puni&s;hment; which, if it did not look
too <HI>notional,</HI> there are many Arguments
to render not improbable. But as for the
Diminution of the Quantity of Fluids in
the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets,</HI> it is certainly &s;o &s;mall
and &s;o incon&s;iderable (tho' &s;till it be &s;ome|thing)
that it will never be &s;en&s;ible in
any finite Number of Years, and &s;o
needs not &s;o magnificent an <HI>Apparatus,</HI>
as the vi&s;it of a <HI>Comet</HI> to &s;upply it; as
to the Diminution of Light, I do believe
it may be demon&s;trated, that if all the
Fluid which the <HI>Sun</HI> lo&s;es in a Year were
brought into a &s;olid Form, it would not
equal a Grain of Sand. Now what is that
to the va&s;t Body of the <HI>Sun?</HI> And as for
<PB N="123" REF="274">
the Fluids on <HI>our Globe,</HI> tho' &s;ome of them
be reduc'd into a &s;olid Form, yet upon
Examination it will be found that mo&s;t
of the &s;ame is again di&s;&s;olv'd into a Fluid;
for in all <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> the
Matter is plain; and as for <HI>Minerals</HI> and
<HI>Metals,</HI> I doubt much, whether there be ve|ry
many new Productions or Generations
of that kind, &s;ince their fir&s;t Production.
So that tho' there be &s;ome lo&s;s of Fluids
on <HI>our Globe,</HI> yet there is &s;tore enough
to &s;upply all the U&s;es of Life and Vege|tation,
for any finite number of Years; and
by the Frame, and make of this our <HI>Sy|&s;tem,</HI>
it does not &s;eem de&s;ign'd to la&s;t for
ever, without &s;ome con&s;iderable Changes.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. Thus I have given a &s;hort
View of this <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of things, as it is at
pre&s;ent, and I am of Opinion it is pretty
near the Truth. And now let any one &s;e|riou&s;ly
reflect upon the <HI>Va&s;tne&s;s, Magni|ficence,
Beauty, Order,</HI> and <HI>Symmetry</HI> of
this <HI>Scheme,</HI> and try if he can think it the
Effect of Chance, or, if he can &s;o much
as doubt, that &s;ome infinitely wife and
<PB N="124" REF="275">
powerful <HI>Architect</HI> has rear'd this noble
<HI>Fabrick.</HI> But to drive the Argument far|ther,
let us enquire a little into the par|ticular
and obvious <HI>De&s;igns</HI> and <HI>Contrivan|ces</HI>
of this Divine <HI>Architecture.</HI> And 1. It
is plain from what has been &s;hewn, that
the univer&s;al Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> or
<HI>Gravitation</HI> obtains in all the Bodies of
this Univer&s;e; and that the Motions of
all the <HI>Planets,</HI> their <HI>Satellits</HI> and the
<HI>Comets,</HI> are govern'd by one Condition
thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Force thereof at
different Di&s;tances from the Center of
Attraction, is <HI>reciprocally</HI> as the <HI>Squares</HI>
of the&s;e Di&s;tances. Now is it at all pro|bable
that &s;o <HI>univer&s;al a Law,</HI> &s;o power|ful
a <HI>Principle,</HI> and &s;o con&s;tant a Rule
&s;hou'd be owing to Chance? If one with
10000 Dice, &s;hou'd throw 5000 Sizes,
once or twice, or even 1000 Sizes
once and again, we might po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay
he did it by Chance; but if with an al|mo&s;t
infinite Number of Dice, he &s;hou'd
always without failing throw the &s;ame
&s;ide in 'em all, we &s;hou'd certainly con|clude,
<PB N="125" REF="276">
he either did it by <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Con|trivance,</HI>
or that the&s;e Dice cou'd turn
up on no other &s;ide. Now I have demon|&s;trated
that <HI>Gravitation</HI> is not <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to
Matter, and &s;o it might have been with|out
it; and yet all the Bodies of the Uni|ver&s;e,
&s;o far as we can di&s;cover, are en|dow'd
with this Principle; and therefore,
it was de&s;ign'd by him who laid the
Foundations of the World. 2. It is
worth our Ob&s;ervation to take Notice,
how con&s;tant and beautiful a Proportion,
the Times of the Revolutions of all the
<HI>Planets,</HI> and their <HI>Satellits,</HI> keep to their
<HI>middle Di&s;tances;</HI> for univer&s;ally, in all
the Revolutions of the <HI>Planets</HI> about the
<HI>Sun,</HI> and of the &s;econdary <HI>Planets</HI> about
the <HI>Primary</HI> ones, the <HI>periodical Times</HI> is
in a <HI>Se&s;quialter</HI> Proportion to the <HI>middle
Di&s;tances;</HI> or the <HI>Cubes</HI> of the middle
Di&s;tances, from the Center of their Mo|tions,
are in all of them (<HI>Planets</HI> and <HI>Sa|tellits</HI>)
as the <HI>Squares</HI> of the <HI>Periodical
Revolutions.</HI> 3. All the <HI>Planets</HI> by Rays
from the <HI>Sun,</HI> and all the <HI>Satellits,</HI> by
<PB N="126" REF="277">
Rays from their Primary <HI>Planets,</HI> de|&s;cribe
equal <HI>Area</HI>'s in equal Times, <HI>i. e.</HI>
the <HI>Area's</HI> de&s;crib'd, are always <HI>proporti|onal</HI>
to the Times. So that when they
approach to the Center of their Motion,
they move fa&s;ter, and when they recede
from it, &s;lower; &s;o as to compen&s;at
their Nearne&s;s, by their Swiftne&s;s, and
their Di&s;tance by their Slowne&s;s: Al|ways
making up equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal
Times. The&s;e two &s;o <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> and &s;o
<HI>regular</HI> Affections, of the Motions of the
<HI>Cele&s;tial</HI> Bodies, are not only di&s;coverable
by Ob&s;ervation, but are the nece&s;&s;ary Ef|fect,
of the Law of Gravitation, ju&s;t now
mentioned to be the <HI>Principle</HI> of the
Heavenly Motions. Can any Body now,
who con&s;iders how many things are con|curring
to, and depending upon the&s;e
beautiful <HI>Proportions,</HI> and regular Effects,
&s;o much as once que&s;tion whether they
are the Product of infinit Wi&s;dom? Cer|tainly
nothing le&s;s cou'd be &s;ufficient, to
make the <HI>Calculations,</HI> adju&s;t the <HI>Forces,</HI> and
determine the <HI>Powers,</HI> nece&s;&s;ary towards
<PB N="127" REF="278">
the Production, of &s;uch exact and regu|lar
<HI>Effects.</HI> 4. All the <HI>Planets</HI> are &s;o
wi&s;ely &s;ituated, in re&s;pect of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
that the Den&s;er <HI>Planet,</HI> is &s;till neare&s;t
him, and the le&s;s Den&s;e, is farther re|mov'd
from him; and the lea&s;t Den&s;e of
all, is the mo&s;t remote. Now can any
Body think this was &s;o ordered without
<HI>De&s;ign?</HI> No certainly, it is &s;o obvious
no Body can mi&s;s of it; for it is plain the
more Den&s;e Matter requires a greater De|gree
of Heat, to fit it for natural Produ|ctions;
and the le&s;s Den&s;e, needs only a
le&s;&s;er Degree of Heat, for the &s;ame End.
And con&s;equently, their Di&s;tances were
adju&s;ted for this very Rea&s;on; and this
by the bye, is a very good Argument
for the <HI>Planets</HI> being inhabited, &s;ince
according to their Den&s;ities, they are fit|ted
with Degrees of Heat nece&s;&s;ary for
natural Productions, now this Adju&s;tment
and the&s;e natural Productions were u&s;ele&s;s,
if there were no Creatures to enjoy the Be|nefit
of 'em; and we all know Nature has
done nothing in vain, And therefore &s;ince
<PB N="128" REF="279">
the&s;e <HI>Accommodations</HI> are provided for li|ving
Creatures, there are &s;uch certainly to
enjoy 'em. 5. The <HI>Velocity</HI> of the <HI>Pla|nets</HI>
Motions, is &s;o adju&s;ted in re&s;pect
of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Velocity</HI> of the <HI>Satel|lits,</HI>
in re&s;pect of their <HI>primary Planets,</HI>
that the <HI>Planet</HI> which is neare&s;t the <HI>Sun,</HI>
moves fa&s;te&s;t, and tho&s;e more remote,
le&s;s fa&s;t, and the farthe&s;t, &s;lowe&s;t of all.
And &s;o in the <HI>Satellits;</HI> the neare&s;t to the
<HI>primary Planets,</HI> moves quicke&s;t, and the
remote&s;t, &s;lowe&s;t. For &s;ince the <HI>Centri|petal</HI>
Forces, are <HI>reciprocally,</HI> as the
<HI>Squares</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;tances</HI> from the Center,
and the <HI>Celerities</HI> in that ca&s;e, recipro|cally,
as the <HI>&s;quare Roots</HI> of the Di&s;tan|ces
from the Center; and &s;ince the &s;quare
Root of the remoter Di&s;tance is greater,
than the &s;quare Root of the nearer, there|fore
the Velocity of the nearer, is grea|ter
than that of the remoter. Now this
is a wi&s;e <HI>Contrivance</HI> of the <HI>Author</HI> of
<HI>Nature;</HI> for &s;ince the nearer <HI>Planet</HI> enjoys
more of the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> than the re|moter,
it was fit the Vici&s;litudes of the
<PB N="129" REF="280">
Sea&s;ons, &s;hou'd be quicker, that an&s;we|ring
be&s;t the Ends of natural Productions;
for &s;ince their Di&s;tances are lea&s;t, and
their Velocities greate&s;t, that are next
the <HI>Sun,</HI> their <HI>Periods</HI> mu&s;t be &s;horte&s;t;
and &s;ince they all move about their <HI>Axes,</HI>
mo&s;t, if not all of them, making there|by
&s;ome <HI>Angle</HI> or other with the Plane
of their <HI>Orbit,</HI> they mu&s;t admit of Va|riety
of Sea&s;ons; and where the Heat is
greate&s;t, there for the Conveniency of
natural Production, it was nece&s;&s;ary the
Sea&s;ons &s;hou'd be &s;horte&s;t, where the
Heat is lea&s;t, there the Sea&s;ons &s;hou'd be
longe&s;t: Now all the&s;e Effects are taken
care of by this adju&s;ting of the Velocity
to the Di&s;tance. And what is here &s;aid
of the Sea&s;ons in re&s;pect of the <HI>Planets,</HI>
may be under&s;tood of the <HI>Satellits</HI> Influ|ences,
from their <HI>primary Planets;</HI> for
whatever Effects the <HI>primary Planets</HI> pro|duce
on the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> ones, it is doubtle&s;s
mo&s;t convenient, the Vici&s;litudes there|of
&s;hou'd be quicke&s;t, in the neare&s;t, and
&s;lowe&s;t in the remote&s;t <HI>Satellits.</HI> And
<PB N="130" REF="281">
this, as well as the former, is a convin|cing
Proof of the <HI>Planets</HI> being inhabited;
for all this beautiful Contrivance is lo&s;t,
if there be no Inhabitant in the&s;e <HI>Cele&s;tial</HI>
Bodies to enjoy the Benefit of it. 6. All
the <HI>Planets,</HI> de&s;cribe about the <HI>Sun</HI> in
one of their <HI>Foci, Elliptick Orbits</HI> of one
Species or another; and all the <HI>Satellits</HI>
de&s;cribe about their <HI>primary Planets</HI> in
one of their <HI>Foci, Elliptick Orbits</HI> al&s;o;
and the Planes of all the Orbits do very
nearly coincide with one another, and
with the Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick.</HI> That
the <HI>Planets</HI> de&s;cribe <HI>Elliptick Orbits</HI> about
the <HI>Sun,</HI> there is no manner of doubt
now among <HI>A&s;tronomers.</HI> And tho' they
&s;ay, that the <HI>Orbits</HI> of the <HI>Satellits</HI> are
not exactly <HI>Elliptical,</HI> yet that is from
nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;es, and is not owing to
Chance, but to the already e&s;tabli&s;h'd
Laws of the Univer&s;e; yet &s;till their <HI>Or|bits</HI>
are nearer <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI> than any other <HI>Geo|metrical
Curves,</HI> and may be reduc'd to
the&s;e; and that the Planes of the <HI>Orbits</HI> of
the <HI>Planets</HI> coincide with the Plane of the
<HI>Ecliptick,</HI> and with one another nearly, is
<PB N="131" REF="282">
matter of Ob&s;ervation. Now is it imagi|nable,
this beautiful and con&s;tant Order
of the&s;e three things, of <HI>Elliptick Orbits,</HI>
the Situation of the <HI>Sun</HI> in the one of the
<HI>Foci,</HI> and the Coincidence of the Planes,
of the <HI>Orbits,</HI> with that of the <HI>Eclip|tick,</HI>
cou'd have been the Effect of Chance
and Ca&s;ualty? Or that it was without
De&s;ign or Coun&s;el? No certainly, for
the Advantages thereby ari&s;ing to our
<HI>Earth</HI> in particular, are evident; for there|by,
the colder and more Northern Places
of our Globe, are brought &s;ome hundreds
of thou&s;and Miles, nearer the <HI>Sun</HI> in
Winter, than in Summer; which cannot
but be of &s;ome u&s;e to tho&s;e Places, that
by the natural Cour&s;e of the Earth, are
depriv'd of the benign Influence of the
<HI>Sun</HI> at that Sea&s;on. Now this Benefit
wou'd be con&s;tant if the Place of the
<HI>Perihelium</HI> did not change; but &s;ince
that is not con&s;tant, the other is not du|rable,
but temporary. But this change
is not now to be taken notice of, &s;ince it
is a Que&s;tion if the&s;e Irregularities were
<PB N="132" REF="283">
any part of the fir&s;t Contrivance of this
Univer&s;e. Now tho' in the re&s;t of the
<HI>Planets,</HI> the Situation of their <HI>Perihelia,</HI>
is not the &s;ame; yet nothing is to be
concluded from thence, again&s;t this Ar|gument,
&s;ince we know not the Nature
of their Inhabitants, nor of their Natural
Productions: But this we may conclude,
&s;ince it is of notable U&s;e to one of the
<HI>Planets,</HI> it cannot be ami&s;s to any of 'em,
they agreeing in mo&s;t things: But what|ever
be the De&s;ign thereof, yet the
con&s;tant Order of the&s;e things are a &s;uf|ficient
Proof that they were not Ca&s;ual,
but the work of Infinite Wi&s;dom, 7. The
<HI>Sun,</HI> all the <HI>Planets,</HI> and their <HI>Satellits,</HI>
&s;o far as we have had occa&s;ion to know,
move about their own <HI>Axes,</HI> the <HI>Axe</HI> of
this Rotation is alway <HI>parallel</HI> to it&s;elf, and
they revolve all one way from We&s;t to
Ea&s;t, and that in Planes, almo&s;t coinci|dent
with one another, and that of the
<HI>Ecliptick.</HI> As to the <HI>Rotation</HI> about their
own <HI>Axe,</HI> it is matter of Ob&s;ervation in
the <HI>Sun,</HI> the <HI>Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Venus,</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="284">
the <HI>Moon,</HI> and it is very probable in the
other two; and as to the <HI>Paralleli&s;m</HI> of
the <HI>Axe</HI> of their; Rotation, it is demon|&s;trable
<HI>a priori,</HI> as I have formerly &s;hewn,
and wou'd be nicely exact, if the &s;ame
were not di&s;turb'd by &s;ome collateral
Cau&s;es; as al&s;o the Coincidence of the
Planes of this Rotation, with one ano|ther,
and with the Plane of the <HI>Ecclip|tick,</HI>
is &s;o very near the Truth, that the
&s;mall Difference from it, is not to be
regarded. Now can the&s;e con&s;tant and
regular Effects be a&s;crib'd to any thing,
but an over-ruling Providence? Can Jum|ble,
and Confu&s;ion produce regular and
invariable Effects? It is altogether, impo&s;|&s;ible,
and therefore, nothing but the Au|thor
of Light, and Order, and Beauty,
cou'd have brought about &s;o uniform,
and &s;uch con&s;tant Effects. Farther, let
us now con&s;ider, that all the&s;e beautiful
and comely <HI>Proportions,</HI> all the&s;e con|&s;tant
and immutable <HI>Effects,</HI> all the&s;e
uniform and regular Appearances, which
agree, not to a few things, or in &s;ome
<PB N="134" REF="285">
particulars, but in mo&s;t of them, to all
the <HI>Planets,</HI> to all their <HI>Satellits,</HI> to the
<HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Moon,</HI> and the <HI>Comets,</HI> and
in a word, to every thing in this our
<HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> might have been varied, &s;eve|ral
and diver&s;e ways; and yet none of
'em fitted &s;o well, to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of
things, and the univer&s;al Benefit of the
whole <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> as the&s;e already &s;ettled.
Thus there might have been an <HI>infinity</HI>
of different, po&s;&s;ible Laws of <HI>Gravitation,</HI>
yet none of them wou'd have fitted our
pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, &s;o well as to the
<HI>Reciprocal Duplicat.</HI> There are innume|rable
<HI>proportions,</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>Se&s;quialter,</HI>
yet none of 'em had &s;uited us &s;o well,
becau&s;e this is the Effect of the Law of
Gravitation, and on the&s;e two, all the
&s;ub&s;equent Advantages from the pre&s;ent
e&s;tabli&s;h'd Motions of the <HI>Planets</HI> depen|ding,

The various po&s;&s;ible Di&s;tances of
the <HI>Planets</HI> from the <HI>Sun,</HI> the po&s;&s;ible
Times of their <HI>Revolutions,</HI> their po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="135" REF="286">
<HI>Celerities,</HI> the po&s;&s;ible <HI>Figures</HI> of their

and <HI>Bulks,</HI> and the po&s;&s;ible <HI>Changes</HI> of
their many other <HI>Affections,</HI> are in num|ber
infinite; and yet I have &s;hewn that
mo&s;t of the&s;e as they are at pre&s;ent,
bring very con&s;iderable Advantages with
them, to the <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> in general, which
con&s;equently wou'd be lo&s;t, were they
di&s;pos'd after another manner. Add to
the&s;e, that all the&s;e Affections of the <HI>Hea|venly
Bodies,</HI> might have been in no re|gular
Order, nor con&s;tant Proportion,
at all, and con&s;equently the po&s;&s;ible
Varieties of the <HI>Cele&s;tial, Bodies</HI> might
have been infinite among 'em&s;elves, and
different from tho&s;e now mentioned. But
&s;eeing every thing is adju&s;ted by <HI>weight</HI>
and <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> &s;eeing they ob&s;erve <HI>Order</HI>
and <HI>Proportion,</HI> and that every one of
'em is di&s;pos'd in the fitte&s;t <HI>Order,</HI> the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of things will admit, &s;ince
both the whole and the &s;everal Parts of
<PB N="136" REF="287">
the <HI>Cele&s;tial Fabrick</HI> is both very good,
u&s;eful, and convenient, who that con|&s;iders

<HI>lives and reigns for ever and ever?</HI> or who
can forbear to admire and adore him, who
<HI>weigh'd the Mountains in Scales, and the
Hills in a Balance, who &s;tretch'd the Hea|like

<P>&sect;XX. Having now con&s;idered, &s;ome
of the more general Affections, of the
<HI>Heavenly Bodies,</HI> and of their Motions,
and &s;hewn &s;ome of the Advantages, ari&s;ing
from their, pre&s;ent Order and Di&s;po&s;ition.
I come now to con&s;ider the <HI>Cele&s;tial Bo|dies</HI>
a little more particularly, and fir&s;t as
to the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> can any thing beget
a greater <HI>Idea</HI> of the Univer&s;e, or of it's
Creator, than that <HI>prodigious</HI> number of
glorious Bodies, like our <HI>Sun,</HI> rang'd all
up and down the <HI>immen&s;e Va&s;t,</HI> and
remov'd at Di&s;tances from one another
an&s;werable to their Di&s;tance from us? This,
<PB N="137" REF="288">
not only their different <HI>apparent Magni|tudes,</HI>
but likewi&s;e the number of tho&s;e
of the fir&s;t, and &s;econd Rate, does evince.
For upon the Suppo&s;ition, that every <HI>fixt
Star,</HI> is like our <HI>Sun,</HI> and governs in a
Portion of <HI>Mundan &s;pace,</HI> equal to our <HI>Sy|&s;tem,</HI>
then there mu&s;t be only as many <HI>fixt
Stars</HI> of the fir&s;t Magnitude, as there are
<HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> that can &s;tand round ours; but there
are but about twelve or thirteen <HI>Spheres,</HI>
that can &s;tand round a middle one, equal
to 'em; and &s;o many are the <HI>Stars</HI> of
the fir&s;t Magnitude. Again, if we examine
how many <HI>Spheres</HI> can &s;tand round this
fir&s;t Range of <HI>Spheres</HI> we will find their
number betwixt forty eight and fifty two,
and &s;o we find the number of the <HI>Stars</HI>
of the &s;econd Magnitude. As for the &s;e|veral
other Magnitudes, it is not alto|gether
po&s;&s;ible to determine their num|ber,
becau&s;e they are not &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h|able
from tho&s;e of the other Magnitudes,
as the fir&s;t and &s;econd are. Be&s;ides, I
do not plead here for Accuracy, but on|ly
for things being nearly &s;o; for, I do
<PB N="138" REF="289">
not think that the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> are either
all of the &s;ame real Magnitude, or that
their <HI>Sy&s;tems,</HI> are all of the &s;ame Dimen|&s;ions:
the&s;e things being nearer any Re|gular
Proportion, than they are to Irre|gularity,
is &s;ufficient for my Purpo&s;e; for
it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Body, &s;eriou&s;ly to
con&s;ider in his Mind, or view with his
Eyes., what is certain about the&s;e glori|ous
Bodies, to hinder him&s;elf from being
ravi&s;h'd with the Power and Wi&s;dom of
the <HI>Great God of Heaven and Earth.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;XXI. How <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>glorious</HI> a
Body is the <HI>Sun,</HI> and of what ab&s;olute
Nece&s;&s;ity to the Being of all <HI>Animals</HI> and
<HI>Vegetables!</HI> As to <HI>Vegetables,</HI> it is beyond
all doubt, that without him they cou'd
never ri&s;e above the Ground; for it is
his Heat alone, that rarifies the &s;izy Jui|ces
about their tender Roots, and makes
them force their way, to di&s;play all the
Foldings of the &s;lender Seed, and there|by
to augment their Parts; ju&s;t as we
find his Heat, rai&s;es the Liquor in the
<HI>Thermometrical</HI> Tubes, and drives them
<PB N="139" REF="290">
through all it's winding Branches, and
tho' perhaps <HI>Animals,</HI> might make a &s;or|ry
Shift (&s;uppo&s;ing Food cou'd be &s;up|ply'd
'em without his Influence) in a
perpetual State of Darkne&s;s, yet it wou'd
be a very mi&s;erable &s;ort of Life, and cou'd
be of no long continuance; for we know,
how nece&s;&s;ary the <HI>Sun</HI> is to purifie our
Air, and to exhale the <HI>noxious</HI> Dews, and
the baleful Vapours of the Night; we
feel a &s;en&s;ible Joy in his Light, and Hea|vine&s;s
in his Ab&s;ence; foul Weather, and
a cloudy Day, is a Di&s;ea&s;e alone, and he
who under&s;tands the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI>
knows the Rea&s;ons, and the <HI>Mechanical</HI>
Nece&s;&s;ity of all the&s;e things. One thing
ev'ry Body knows, <HI>viz.</HI> that by the
Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the Action of his
Rays, that infinite Number of the <HI>excre|cretory
Ducts</HI> of Per&s;piration, plac'd along
all the &s;uperficial Parts of the Body are
open'd, and enlarg'd, and &s;o tho&s;e Exha|lations,
which Nature has de&s;ign'd &s;hou'd
be carry'd out of the Body, are more
freely and plentifully deriv'd; which mu&s;t
<PB N="140" REF="291">
needs give a greater Freedom to the Blood
and Spirits, the contrary of all which,
happens in the Ab&s;ence, of this <HI>Benign
Star.</HI> But of this more afterwards. It's
being &s;ituated immoveable in the Cen|ter
of our <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> no Body who has been
at the pains to con&s;ider the Matter, I be|lieve
doubts now, for not to mention at
pre&s;ent the Controver&s;ie about the <HI>Paral|lax</HI>
of &s;ome of the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> which Mr.
<HI>Fla$$&s;tead</HI> has ob&s;erv'd, and whereby he
pretends to demon&s;trate the Motion of
the Earth, and con&s;equently the Stability
of the <HI>Sun;</HI> there are &s;ome other Argu|ments
that will have &s;ufficient Weight to
&s;ettle the Matter among thoughtful Men,
For 1. It is altogether impo&s;&s;ible to ac|count
for the Appearances of the <HI>Planets,</HI>
their <HI>Satellits,</HI> and of the <HI>fixt Stars,</HI> in any
tolerable manner, without admiting the
Motion of the Earth. 2. It is likewi&s;e
impo&s;&s;ible to account for the Motions of
the <HI>Comets,</HI> upon, any other Suppo&s;ition.
And 3. that Analogy of the <HI>Periodical</HI>
Times, to the <HI>midle Di&s;tances,</HI> which
<PB N="141" REF="292">
is the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of the e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
Law of Gravitation, does demon|&s;trate
the Earth's Motion <HI>&agrave; priori;</HI> &s;o that
unle&s;s we wou'd &s;ubvert the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI>
of <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> and di&s;prove the Cau&s;es of
all the Cele&s;tial Motions, we &s;hall never
be able to prove the Stability of the
<HI>Earth.</HI> For if the Cele&s;tial Bodies attract
one another in a <HI>duplicate Proportion reci|procally,</HI>
to their Di&s;tances from the Cen|ter
of their Revolutions, then the <HI>Earth</HI>
(and not the <HI>Sun</HI>) moves. Add to all
the&s;e, that there is no tolerable Objecti|on
again&s;t the Earth's Motion, but has
had a full An&s;wer, and a plain Solution.
Now what an In&s;tance of Wi&s;dom and
Contrivance is this, in placing that Foun|tain
of Light and Life, in the Center of
his <HI>Sy&s;tem.</HI> How unartful wou'd it have
been, to have &s;et him in a Corner, when
he was to have giv'n Light and Warmth
to all the Bodies round him; be&s;ides, to
the con&s;ervation of any &s;uch Suppo&s;ition
(&s;uch as the <HI>Tychonick</HI> or <HI>Ptolomick.</HI>) there
are requir'd &s;o many different Laws of
<PB N="142" REF="293">
<HI>Gravitation,</HI> that any rea&s;onable Per&s;on
by inquiring into them, wou'd ea&s;ily di&s;|cover,
that what&s;oever was Matter of
fact, yet this Po&s;ition of ours was the
the mo&s;t &s;imple and ea&s;ie, and look'd mo&s;t
like the Effects of Wi&s;dom and De&s;ign:
For here one &s;ingle Law, accounts for all
the various Motions and Appearances of
the <HI>Cele&s;tial Bodies.</HI> Thus then this great
and glorious Body is fixt, like a powerful
and a kindly <HI>Monarch</HI> on his Throne,
distributing Light, Warmth, and Life in
plentiful Effu&s;ion, to all his &s;urrounding
<HI>Va&s;&s;als,</HI> and that &s;o equally, that the
neare&s;t have not too much, nor the re|mote&s;t
too little. The&s;e are &s;uch great,
&s;uch wi&s;e Ends, as clearly &s;peak the <HI>Om|nipotence</HI>
and <HI>Omni&s;cience</HI> of their <HI>Author.</HI>
Moreover, let us con&s;ider, with how
much Artfulne&s;s his Bulk and Situation, in
re&s;pect of the <HI>Planets,</HI> is contriv'd to have
ju&s;t Quantity enough of Matter to draw
round him the&s;e Ma&s;&s;y Bodies, and their
<HI>Satellits,</HI> &s;o various in their Bulks and Di|&s;tances
from him; and that in regular
<PB N="143" REF="294">
and uniform <HI>Orbits.</HI> How exactly his
Body is rounded, how fully it has been
&s;aturated with the Fluid of Light, to be
able to la&s;t &s;o many Years without any
&s;en&s;ible Diminution, tho' there are con|&s;tant
Emanations thereof upon his Atten|dents.
As for his <HI>Rotation</HI> about his own
<HI>Axe,</HI> it is no doubt likewi&s;e, for wi&s;e
Ends and Purpo&s;es, perhaps it may be for
the better propagating, and emitting this
Fluid of Light, through the <HI>Planetary
Regions;</HI> but I am rather inclin'd to be|lieve
it may be the nece&s;&s;ary Effect of the
Fluidity of his Body, it being very well
known, that the Particles of all &s;olid Bo|dies
running into &s;u&s;ion, by the Force of
the heat, are turn'd innumerable different
ways; and &s;o by their Oppo&s;ition and In|terferings,
are at la&s;t determin'd, into a
circular Motion of the whole one way.
However this Matter be, we have here
&s;ufficient In&s;tances of Wi&s;dom and De|&s;ign
to enforce upon us the Belief that
a being infinitely perfect is the Author
thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="295">
&sect; XXII. We can no otherwi&s;e gather
the u&s;efulne&s;s of the <HI>&s;econdary Planets,</HI> to
their <HI>primary</HI> Ones, but by &s;uppo&s;ing the
re&s;t may reap <HI>re&s;pectively,</HI> &s;ome thing <HI>a|nalogous,</HI>
to the Benefits we of the Earth,
receives from our <HI>Moon,</HI> which are 1. The
&s;upplying of the <HI>Sun</HI> in the Night time,
for at lea&s;t three fourths of the Year. Now
how comfortable and delightful a thing
this is, Travellers and Voyagers can be&s;t
tell, <HI>Curio&s;ity, Ambition</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI>
have now made it nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;ome part
of Mankind &s;hou'd be travelling by Land
or Sea, in the Night Sea&s;ons; how plea|&s;ant
then, and joyful a thing, is it to have
a Light held us forth from <HI>Heaven,</HI> not
only to guide our Steps, but to direct us
in our Cour&s;e, and to point out to us,
how our time wears out? For a very lit|tle
Experience, makes us reap both the&s;e
la&s;t Advantages from the Pre&s;ence and
Motion of the <HI>Moon.</HI> 2. She rai&s;es our
<HI>Tides,</HI> twice in twenty four Hours, which
how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it is toward the
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> we
<PB N="145" REF="296">
&s;hall now &s;hew. Every Body knows that
a <HI>Lake or Loch,</HI> that has no fre&s;h Water
runing into it, will by the heat of a few
Months, and its Stagnation, turn into
a &s;tinking rotten <HI>Pudle,</HI> &s;ending forth
nau&s;eous and poy&s;onous Steams; for tho'
I do not think, the con&s;tituent Particles
of Water them&s;elves, are alter'd by this
Stagnation, yet no Water is ab&s;olutely
pure, but contains a greater Quantity of
Fle&s;hy, Bony, Earthy, Salin, Metallick,
and Vegetable Particles, than of pure <HI>E|lement;</HI>
and it is upon the&s;e, the heat
operates, by di&s;&s;olving their Union, and
combining 'em in new Forms, and &s;epa|rating
the&s;e <HI>noxious</HI> Particles which pro|duce
this Effect. Now tho' there be ma|ny
thou&s;ands of fre&s;h Water Rivers, daily
runing into the <HI>Sea,</HI> yet they are very in|con&s;iderable
in re&s;pect of the <HI>va&s;t Ocean</HI> of
Salt Water, and wou'd by no means hin|der
it's Stagnation, and con&s;equently it's
Corruption and Stinking. But admit the
Ocean once &s;tagnated, and then the fir&s;t
Effect wou'd be, that all the Places to|ward
<PB N="146" REF="297">
the Shores, wou'd be fir&s;t wrought
upon by the Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> and turn'd
to a <HI>Mephitis,</HI> and then by Degrees it
wou'd get farther, till the whole were
become more <HI>baneful</HI> and <HI>poy&s;onous</HI> than
the Lake of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah;</HI> where|by
the <HI>Fi&s;hes</HI> wou'd be fir&s;t de&s;troy'd, and
by the noxious Steams thence ari&s;ing, af|terwards
the <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Animals;</HI> where|as
by this Action of the <HI>Moon,</HI> the Wa|ters
are lifted up in a heap, as it were,
and then let fall again; whereby the Wa|ters
near the Shores, are con&s;tantly &s;e|cur'd
from Stagnation and Corruption,
and the begining Malady &s;tifled. This
perpetual Change of new Water on the
Shores, keeping any one Portion thereof,
too &s;hort a time, expos'd to the heat of
the <HI>Sun,</HI> to have it's mixture corrupted.
Now what a <HI>noble</HI> Contrivance have we
here! by appointing an <HI>Attendant</HI> to
our <HI>Earth,</HI> all the <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI>
are pre&s;erv'd from certain De&s;truction;
(but I am of opinion that to the full effect
of this wi&s;e De&s;ign, the Salt of the Sea
<PB N="147" REF="298">
does very much contribute; for as I have
&s;aid before, and may ob&s;erve afterward,
the pointed &s;lender Particles of the <HI>Salt,</HI>
&s;tick the Parts of Bodies &s;o together,
that the Particles of Heat, cannot &s;o ea&s;i|ly
tear 'em a&s;$nder.) Be&s;ides this, how
many Conveniencies for our <HI>Navigation,</HI>
in Rivers and Harbours, does this ebbing
and flowing of the <HI>Sea</HI> afford? No Body
that con&s;iders them, can cea&s;e from won|der,
or can continue in Unbelief. And
here perhaps it will not be ami&s;s to con|&s;ider
that if our <HI>Earth</HI> had any more than
one <HI>Moon</HI> attending it, that we &s;hou'd
receive more Damage than Advantage from
it; for tho' perhaps thereby our Light in
the Night (provided &s;he were of any Bulk,
or at any Di&s;tance near to that of our pre|&s;ent
<HI>Moon</HI>) might be augmented, yet at
the <HI>Conjunctions</HI> and <HI>Oppo&s;itions</HI> with one a|nother,
and with the <HI>Sun,</HI> we &s;hou'd have
Tides that wou'd rai&s;e the Waters to the
tops of our Mountains, and in their <HI>Quadra|tures</HI>
we &s;hou'd have no Tide at all. In
&s;hort, if our <HI>Moon</HI> were biger or nearer the
<HI>Earth,</HI> or if we had more than one, at any
<PB N="148" REF="299">
tolerable di&s;tance from us, We &s;hou'd be every
now and then, in hazard of being drown'd;
and if our pre&s;ent <HI>Moon</HI> were le&s;s, or at a
greater di&s;tance, or if there were none
at all, we &s;hou'd be in hazard of being
&s;tifled by the noxious Steams ari&s;ing
from the <HI>Ocean,</HI> which wou'd &s;tagnat
more than it now does. From all which
it's evident how wi&s;ely our <HI>Satellit,</HI> has
been contriv'd for our Purpo&s;es. As for
the numerous Attendants of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and
<HI>Saturn,</HI> they mu&s;t be rea&s;onably expected
to fit the Nece&s;&s;ities of the Inhabitants of
the&s;e <HI>Planets,</HI> &s;ince our Moon &s;uits us &s;o
well, and tho' the Fluids of the&s;e <HI>Planets,</HI>
be not in &s;o great hazard of corrupting from
the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> yet they may po&s;|&s;ibly
be in hazard of being congeal'd by
the Violence of the Cold, and the fre|quent
to&s;&s;ing and turning over of them,
by the united, or &s;eparated Forces of &s;o
many <HI>Moons,</HI> may hinder this Effect; for
we &s;ufficiently know, how &s;trongly Fluids
in Motion will re&s;i&s;t the Efficacy of Cold.
However the thing be, we may here ob|&s;erve
<PB N="149" REF="300">
one very &s;ignal In&s;tance of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI>
and <HI>Contrivance,</HI> in placing the Heavenly

Ju&s;tice,</HI> &s;ending baleful Steams, from
their long Trains, upon the <HI>Planets,</HI> they
come nigh; and if what is commonly &s;aid
of 'em by <HI>A&s;trologers</HI> be true, they &s;eldom
vi&s;it us without &s;ome &s;uch direful Salu|tation.
However, from them we may
learn that the <HI>Divine Vengeance,</HI> may find
a &s;eat for the puni&s;hment of his Di&s;obe|dient
Creatures, without being put to the
expen&s;e of a new Creation.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="303">
&sect; XXIV. Come we now to enquire
into the Wi&s;dom of the Contrivance of
the <HI>Planets.</HI> But having already &s;hewn
the <HI>Analogy</HI> between them and our <HI>Earth,</HI>
and how probable it is that they are in|habited
by Creatures fitted for &s;uch Habi|tations,
I &s;hall content my &s;elf with point|ing
out &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable In|&s;tances
of <HI>De&s;ign</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in this our
<HI>Planet;</HI> hoping the Reader will rea&s;on
after the &s;ame manner (bateing particular
Circum&s;tances) of the re&s;t, and that, both
becau&s;e the de&s;ign'd Brevity of this Trea|ti&s;e
will not permit me to be &s;o particu|lar,
as the Subject de&s;erves, and becau&s;e,
if the <HI>Analogy</HI> hold in general, the parti|cular
ones (with allowance for Circum|&s;tances)
will ea&s;ily follow. And fir&s;t let
us con&s;ider the Advantages, ari&s;ing to us
by the <HI>Rotation</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> about it's
own <HI>Axis.</HI> We the Inhabitants of this
Globe are &s;o made, that once in &s;ixteen
or twenty Hours at mo&s;t, we require a
Time for <HI>Relaxation,</HI> and generally &s;peak|ing,
in all healthful People this time is
<PB N="153" REF="304">
pretty equal, between &s;ix and nine Hours,
the Store-hou&s;es of our Spirits will not
permit any longer Application than twen|ty
Hours, without Injury to our Con&s;titu|tions,
and much about the Time of &s;ix
Hours is requir'd to fill 'em again; and
generally &s;peaking, it is nece&s;&s;ary that
an Alternation of <HI>Application</HI> and <HI>Relaxa|tion,</HI>
&s;hou'd be once in twenty four Hours.
It's true Cu&s;tom and Education, may get
the better of the&s;e <HI>natural Propen&s;ities,</HI>
and a very &s;trong Con&s;titution may bear
out with harder Mea&s;ures for &s;ome time;
but the Young, and the Weak, and al|mo&s;t
all at their own Liberty, natural|ly
run into a <HI>Relaxation,</HI> and recruiting
their Spirits by Sleep, once in twenty
four Hours. It was likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary,
that the Air &s;hou'd be at lea&s;t cool and
temperate, during the time of this Re&s;t,
for we generally find tho&s;e that &s;leep in
the open Air, or ev'n while the <HI>Sun</HI> is
above the <HI>Horizon,</HI> the wor&s;e for it; the
<HI>Sun</HI> and Heat exhaling the natural Per&s;pi|rations
too violently, and rai&s;ing too quick
<PB N="154" REF="305">
a Motion, in the Blood, whereby the
Sleep is le&s;s calm, and more di&s;turb'd.
And tho' we generaly per&s;pire more in the
Night than the Day, yet this is more na|tural,
and le&s;s violent, and more accor|ding
to the Nece&s;&s;ities of our Con&s;tituti|on,
in the Night than the Day. Be&s;ides,
that of nece&s;&s;ity, the Darkne&s;s is le&s;s
&s;ubject to Noi&s;e and Di&s;turbance, than
the Day. Now all the&s;e things are won|derfully
provided for by the <HI>Rotation</HI> of
the <HI>Earth</HI> about its <HI>Axis;</HI> for thereby we
have the <HI>Vici&s;&s;itudes</HI> of Day and Night,
the Day for <HI>Application</HI> and &s;pending our
Spirits in, about the Nece&s;&s;ities of Life,
the Night by its Coolne&s;s and Quiet, to
afford us time to recruit 'em, and lay up
in &s;tore, for the Expen&s;es of the next
Day; as al&s;o for nouri&s;hing the Mu&s;cles,
Bones, Channels, and the other Parts of
the Body; for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Nutrition
is mo&s;tly, if not altogether perform'd in
the time of Re&s;t, becau&s;e the Blood has
too rapid and quick a Motion, the Ex|pen&s;es
of the Spirits are too great, to af|ford
<PB N="155" REF="306">
Lei&s;ure, or Materials, for nouri&s;hing
the Parts in the time of Application: Be|&s;ides
that a gentle uniform Motion is re|quir'd
to apply nouri&s;hing Parts, to the
nece&s;&s;ary Places, and to &s;ettle 'em there;
and we generally find that People reco|vering
from a Di&s;ea&s;e, and Children, &s;leep
more, and are more fed by their Sleep,
than any other <HI>Animal Function,</HI> and
gro&s;s People naturally &s;leep longe&s;t. Like|wi&s;e,
what a comfortable and refre&s;hing
thing is the cool Breezes of the Night, to
tho&s;e that live under the <HI>equatorial Parts,</HI>
without which Life wou'd be both ex|ceeding
&s;hort, and very grievous. More|over,
let us reflect upon the Nece&s;&s;ities
of our <HI>Vegetables,</HI> which are the Support
of Animals; we have before &s;aid, that
the Heat of the <HI>Sun</HI> rarifies and con&s;e|quently
rai&s;es the &s;izy Juices, at the Roots
of the tender Seeds, and thereby forces
the folded Branches to expand and en|large.
Now were the <HI>Sun</HI> con&s;tantly, or
for any long time, &s;hining upon them;
the&s;e Juices wou'd not be at liberty to
<PB N="156" REF="307">
&s;ettle, and con&s;olidate in the fit Places
of the Branches; but wou'd be &s;till
ri&s;ing higher and higher, till at la&s;t
they bur&s;t the Tops of the Canals, and
con&s;equently cou'd produce nothing;
whereas by this <HI>Vici&s;&s;itude</HI> of Heat and
Cold, what is rais'd in the Day-time,
has time to &s;ettle and con&s;olidate in the
Night, and it's Cold runs the thin Juices
fir&s;t into thick, &s;izy, Sub&s;tances, which
the &s;upervening Heat, by exhaling the
watery Parts (which are now brought
nearer the Surface of the <HI>Plant</HI>) does
harden and fix. This we evidently &s;ee
in <HI>Nutgals,</HI> and the other Excre&s;cences of
the Leaves of <HI>Vegetables;</HI> and generally,
Countries that have moderately cool
Nights, produce <HI>Vegetables</HI> of the firme&s;t
Union of Parts; and very hot Countries,
&s;uddenly bring up their Seeds, but their
Parts are le&s;s firmly &s;tuck together; they
may be heavier, but not &s;o tough or hard,
tho' this too depends much upon the
Con&s;titution, and fir&s;t make of the Seed.
On the other Hand, had not the <HI>Earth</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="308">
mov'd upon its <HI>Axe,</HI> but only turn'd round
the <HI>Sun</HI> in its <HI>annual Period,</HI> we had not
only lo&s;t all the&s;e Advantages, which
are &s;o beneficial, if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to the Being of our <HI>Animals</HI> and
<HI>Vegetables,</HI> but we had &s;uffered al&s;o &s;uch
Inconveniences, as neither of the&s;e cou'd
po&s;&s;ibly bear; for then, for very near one
half of the Year we &s;hou'd have been in
perpetual Darkne&s;s, the Con&s;equence of
which wou'd have been, that fir&s;t baleful
and &s;ulphureous Damps (by the Forces of
the preceding Heat generated and rais'd.)
wou'd have fall'n, which wou'd have &s;ti|fled
all the <HI>Animals,</HI> or had they &s;urviv'd
that, by Degrees, exceeding Rains wou'd
have been pour'd down (as the Vapours
became cooler) next Sleet, then Snow,
and Ice, and Fro&s;t, which wou'd of ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
not only have lock'd up all Fluids,
but wou'd' have freez'd the Blood and
Spirits in the Channels, of all the <HI>Ani|mals</HI>
we are acquainted with; for as I
have &s;hewn before, there is a &s;aline Body
con&s;tantly &s;wiming in our Air, which by
<PB N="158" REF="309">
the Pre&s;ence and Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> is &s;o
attenuated and reduc'd into &s;o &s;lender
Particles, who&s;e Points (being ea&s;ie&s;t bro|ken)
by the Force of the Fluid of Light
are fir&s;t beat off, as not to be able to do any
Damage, but in <HI>his</HI> Ab&s;ence, they &s;hoot
them&s;elves into oblong &s;harp Wedges,
which &s;tick together the Parts of all Bo|dies.
Now in a half Years Ab&s;ence of the
<HI>Sun,</HI> in what Quantities, and with how
much firmne&s;s wou'd the&s;e Saline Bodies
have form'd them&s;elves! Certainly nothing
that moves, whether <HI>Animate</HI> or <HI>Inanimate,</HI>
wou'd have been able to &s;upport &s;uch a cold
And all this is not only demon&s;trable <HI>a
priori,</HI> but is Matter of fact, and actually
happens in tho&s;e Places that are under the
<HI>Poles,</HI> during a much &s;horter Ab&s;ence of
this <HI>glorious Star.</HI> Again, in the enlight|ned
half of the Year, we &s;hou'd have had,
fir&s;t huge Deluges of melted Waters, from
the preceding Snow, which likewi&s;e wou'd
have produc'd &s;uffocating Mi&s;ts; next all
our Ground, wou'd have turn'd into a &s;tiff
&s;tinking <HI>Puddle,</HI> (being in a manner di&s;|&s;olv'd
by the Force and Quantity of the
<PB N="159" REF="310">
Snow Water) then wou'd <HI>&s;ultry Heats</HI>
and a burning Air have gall'd us, that
we &s;hou'd have found re&s;t, neither in
Hou&s;es nor Dens; till at la&s;t the Heat
encrea&s;ing without Abatement, the Blood
and Spirits of all the <HI>Animals</HI> of our <HI>Globe,</HI>
wou'd be quite exhal'd, or they turn'd
delirous by the violent Agitation of the
Blood and Spirits, and then dy'd in <HI>Con|vul&s;ions,</HI>
like &s;o many Puppies in the
<HI>Dog-Days;</HI> for it were ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible,
that any thing that has Life
&s;hou'd re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a Degree of Heat. It's
true, there are &s;ome People live under the
<HI>Aequator,</HI> yet they have but a &s;curvy time
on't, tho' they are &s;upply'd with con&s;tant
Breezes, ari&s;ing from the <HI>Earth</HI>'s <HI>Rotation</HI>
about her <HI>Axis,</HI> and prodigious Quantities
of Rain, falling by the Plenty of Vapour,
rais'd by the Days Heat, and let fall by
the &s;upervening Cold of the Night, ha|ving
as long a Night as they have a Day,
which is a mighty Relief, the continued
uninterrupted Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> being
by much a far harder part, than the Degree
<PB N="160" REF="311">
of the Heat at &s;tated Sea&s;ons. And as
for the <HI>Poles,</HI> we have very certain Infor|mation,
that few if any at all, inhabit
near 'em. The extreme Degrees of Heat
and Cold that happen there, being in|compatible
with an <HI>Animal</HI> Life. But
that which makes the Ca&s;e much wor&s;e
than in any part of our <HI>Globe,</HI> upon this
Suppo&s;ition, is, that the Rays of the <HI>Sun</HI>
wou'd be both direct, and there cou'd be
no Rains nor Winds becau&s;e it is the cool|ing
of the Air, that is the Cau&s;e of both;
which by no means cou'd happen in our
Ca&s;e, every &s;ucceeding Hour heating the
Air to a greater Degree than the former.
Add to all the&s;e, that our Seas even not|with&s;tanding
our <HI>Tides,</HI> wou'd either be
exhal'd, or turn'd into De&s;arts of Salt,
and &s;o, not only our Fi&s;hes wou'd be
de&s;troy'd, but we cou'd have no fre&s;h
Waters, &s;eeing we cou'd have no cool
Air to &s;end it down: If we had any
<HI>Plants</HI> or <HI>Vegetables,</HI> they wou'd be but
of one particular kind, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e which
require the greate&s;t Degrees of Heat, but
<PB N="161" REF="312">
it is demon&s;trable we &s;hou'd have Occa|&s;ion
for none; for any body who under|&s;tands
the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> will ea&s;ily
&s;ee that no <HI>Animal,</HI> &s;uch as we have on
our <HI>Globe</HI> now, cou'd bear &s;uch an ex|ce&s;&s;ive
and uninterrupted Degree of Heat.
Upon all which Accounts it is very plain,
that the pre&s;ent <HI>Rotation</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI>
about her <HI>Axe,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t &s;ignal
In&s;tances of Wi&s;dom and Contrivance,
that can be imagin'd.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. Next let us combine this
<HI>Diurnal Rotation</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> about its
own <HI>Axe,</HI> with the <HI>Annual Revolution</HI> of
the &s;ame about the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the <HI>Paral|leli&s;m</HI>
of the <HI>Axe,</HI> of the <HI>Diurnal Rota|tion</HI>
with it&s;elf: And from thence we
&s;hall have the beautiful Sea&s;ons of the
Year; Seed time, and Harve&s;t, Summer,
and Winter; the comfortable Vici&s;&s;itudes
of colder and warmer Periods, of Snow,
and Rain, Winds and Calms, of &s;horter
Days, and longer Nights, and again of
longer Days, and &s;horter Nights, and of
all tho&s;e delightful Changes, which are
<PB N="162" REF="313">
&s;o plea&s;ant, comfortable, yea, and ne|ce&s;&s;ary
in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. If
the <HI>Earth</HI> had only turn'd about her own
<HI>Axe,</HI> once in twenty four Hours, then
all our <HI>Vici&s;&s;itudes</HI> wou'd have been of
Days, and Nights; which by no means
wou'd have been &s;ufficient for <HI>Vegetation.</HI>
If the <HI>Earth</HI> had made a <HI>Period,</HI> about
the <HI>Sun,</HI> once in the Year, without any
<HI>Rotation,</HI> we &s;hou'd have had but one
long Day, and another equal Night;
which as I have &s;hewn, wou'd not have
agreed, neither with Life, nor Vegetation.
If both the&s;e had been united without
the third of the <HI>Paralleli&s;m</HI> of the <HI>Axe</HI>
of the <HI>Diurnal Rotation</HI> to it&s;elf, we
might have had Days and Nights, but
our other Sea&s;ons wou'd have been un|certain,
and in &s;ome Places none at all;
and &s;o the Effect of the Annual Revolution
wou'd have been de&s;troy'd in &s;ome Mea&s;ure.
But by this wi&s;e Conjunction of all the&s;e
three Modifications, we enjoy our Sea|&s;ons,
and the other con&s;equent Changes
of the Year, which are of &s;o great u&s;e to
<PB N="163" REF="314">
us; for had we enjoy'd a con&s;tant uni|form
Sea&s;on all the Year round, &s;up|po&s;e
of Summer Weather, then our
Ground had been exhau&s;ted, and worn
out by con&s;tant bringing forth of <HI>Vege|tables,</HI>
and wou'd have run into Weeds,
and tho&s;e other Plants that require the
lea&s;t rich Soil, and mo&s;t Heat only; &s;o
that in a few Years the <HI>Earth</HI> wou'd have
been reduc'd into a <HI>Wilderne&s;s</HI> of unu&s;e|ful
Herbs; for toward the Production
of the more u&s;eful Plants, there is re|quir'd
(be&s;ides a certain Degree of Heat
and Moi&s;ture,) a <HI>Lixivial</HI> and <HI>Nitrous
Salt,</HI> which keeps the Mould loo&s;e (for re|ceiving
the moi&s;t Air, and for the entry
of that Heat and Moi&s;ture.) For tho' <HI>Salts</HI>
con&s;olidat Water, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;olid
porous Parts, whereby their Particles are
&s;tuck together, yet they keep the Parts of
Mould or Sandy Clay (which has little
or no Water) a&s;under, and loo&s;e, by
the &s;ame very Rea&s;on, for their Particles
not allowing them entry into them&s;elves,
they get betwixt 'em, and fir&s;t &s;eparate
<PB N="164" REF="315">
their union, and then keep 'em from
coming together; and perhaps both for|ward
the Motion of the Liquors in the
<HI>Vegetable</HI> Channels (which are certainly
endow'd with &s;ome Degree of <HI>Elasticity,</HI>
and &s;o capable of being &s;timulated, as is
evident in younger Twigs and Branches,
as well as <HI>Animal</HI> ones) and endows the
Juices with the Qualities the <HI>Plant</HI> re|quires.
Now the&s;e are either quite ex|hau&s;ted,
or de&s;troy'd, by con&s;tant Growth
and <HI>Vegetation.</HI> We &s;ee the be&s;t Ground
wears out in a few Years, and turns
into wild u&s;ele&s;s Weeds; and all the
Materials for enriching Ground, are ga|thered
from Places, debar'd from the
Action of the <HI>Sun</HI> and the Expences
of <HI>Vegetation,</HI> but expo&s;s'd to the Air,
and Weather, whereby they are im|pregnated
with this <HI>Nitrous Salt:</HI> Such
are old Turf, new Mould, the Dung,
and Excrements of <HI>Animals,</HI> or tho&s;e
things which abound with <HI>Lixivial Salts;</HI>
&s;uch are burnt Wood, burnt Turf, Stubble,
and the like. Now all the&s;e, wou'd by a
<PB N="165" REF="316">
&s;hort Time's uninterrupted <HI>Vegetation.</HI>
have been quite &s;pent. Add to the&s;e,
that in a perpetual <HI>Summer,</HI> there
would not fall &s;ufficient Quantities of
Rain, to moi&s;ten and &s;often the Mould,
to that Degree that is nece&s;&s;ary for con|&s;tant
<HI>Vegetation;</HI> for we find there is more
than twice or thrice as much Rain falls
in the <HI>Winter</HI> &s;ix Months, from <HI>September</HI>
to <HI>April,</HI> than in the <HI>Summer</HI> &s;ix Months;
and yet all this is but &s;ufficient for one
&s;ix Months <HI>Vegetation.</HI> Moreover, even
the <HI>Animals</HI> them&s;elves, cou'd not con|veniently
bear a perpetual <HI>Summer;</HI> for
we find now, that the cold of the <HI>Win|ter,</HI>
by &s;toping the Pores of the &s;en&s;ible
Per&s;piration, keeps the Warmth more
within, whereby there is a greater Quan|tity
of Spirits generated, the Blood is
le&s;s rarify'd, the natural Functions, are
more &s;trong, and perform'd with more
Vigour, the Dige&s;tion is better, the &s;en|&s;ible
Excretions more natural, and le&s;s
violent, and the Crudities of the pre|ceding
<HI>Summer</HI> are &s;ettled and dige&s;ted,
<PB N="166" REF="317">
I mean, in healthful and &s;ound <HI>Animals</HI>
(for the Ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e in <HI>Valetu|dinary
ones,</HI> as of nece&s;&s;ity it mu&s;t be) and
in a moderate and not over tedious <HI>Win|ter;</HI>
wheras in <HI>Summer</HI> the Blood is more
rarify'd, the Spirits more exhau&s;ted, the
<HI>&s;en&s;ible Per&s;pirations</HI> more violent, and
le&s;s natural, the Dige&s;tion wor&s;e, and
all the Concoctions le&s;s thoroughly per|form'd.
So that it is evident we cou'd bear
neither of the&s;e States perpetually, the
Change of the <HI>one</HI> being ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to qualify the Errours and Ex|treams
of the <HI>other.</HI> If we had a per|petual
<HI>Summer,</HI> we &s;hou'd be reduc'd to
meer <HI>Skeletons;</HI> if a perpetual <HI>Winter,</HI> we
&s;hou'd turn Dull, unactive <HI>Drones.</HI> Now
perhaps again&s;t all the&s;e it may be ob|jected,
that there are rational Creatures,
who inhabit this <HI>Globe</HI> of ours, who are
perpetually in both the&s;e Extreams, and
yet are found to be not at all di&s;pos'd,
as I pretend they wou'd be. To this I
an&s;wer, that tho' as to the Pre&s;ence or
Ab&s;ence of the <HI>Sun,</HI> they may be much
<PB N="167" REF="318">
the &s;ame as I &s;uppo&s;e, yet, there are other
concurring Circum&s;tances, which ari&s;e
from the <HI>Vici&s;&s;itudes</HI> of the Sea&s;ons in
the other Parts of the <HI>Globe,</HI> which alters
the Ca&s;e quite; for there are con&s;tant
Sea&s;ons of Rain, in the more <HI>Southern</HI>
Countries, which fall for &s;ome con&s;ide|rable
time, that both hinders the perpe|tual
<HI>Vegetation,</HI> &s;oftens the Mould, and
fattens it for the next Crop; there are
Clouds of Snow, and Rain, impregnated
with the&s;e <HI>nitrous Salts,</HI> which are driven
(by the Force of the Winds) from colder
into the&s;e hotter Countries and there fall|ing,
do enrich the Ground. Be&s;ides that,
even the Clouds, rais'd from the&s;e hotter
Countries them&s;elves, when de&s;till'd into
Rain, are &s;ufficient for this end; for as I
have &s;aid before, the Air every where is
full of &s;uch <HI>Salts,</HI> as is known by Experi|ment.
Let any one con&s;ult <HI>Varenius,</HI> and
he will be &s;atisfied that the&s;e Southern
Countries have <HI>Winters,</HI> though not of
Snow, yet what is abundantly &s;ufficient to
&s;top the perpetual <HI>Vegetation,</HI> to moi&s;ten,
<PB N="168" REF="319">
&s;often and fatten the Mould, and to cool
the Blood, and other Fluids of the <HI>Ani|mals.</HI>
Now the Principal thing that
makes this <HI>Poetical</HI> &s;tate of a Perpetual
<HI>Summer,</HI> unfit for the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution
of the <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> is, that
in &s;uch a &s;tate (either ari&s;ing from only a
<HI>Diurnal Rotation,</HI> without an <HI>Annual,</HI> or
an <HI>Annual</HI> without a <HI>Diurnal</HI>) there wou'd
not be that variety of Rains, and cool
Breezes, nor con&s;tant, and Trade-winds,
nor overflowing Rivers, and &s;uch like
Circum&s;tances, which are the Effect of
this Combining the&s;e two Motions to|gether.
I need not &s;hew the Inconveni|ences
of a perpetual <HI>Winter,</HI> every Body
is &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible, that upon &s;uch a
Suppo&s;ition, we &s;hou'd have neither <HI>Ve|getable</HI>
nor <HI>Animal</HI> in a very &s;hort Time;
e&s;pecially of any con&s;iderable u&s;e, or va|lue,
&s;uch as require a <HI>Summer</HI>'s Heat, for
their Growth; and as for <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Au|tumn,</HI>
they are not &s;o much di&s;tinct Sea|&s;ons
from the two former, as Gentle <HI>Gra|dations</HI>
and ea&s;ie Steps, whereby the one
<PB N="169" REF="320">
&s;lides into the other, through the inter|mediate
Degrees. From all which it is evi|dent,
how wi&s;ely the&s;e three &s;o different
Modifications, have been link'd together,
for the Benefit of the Inhabitants of this
<HI>Globe;</HI> for by the&s;e, we have &s;ufficient Heat
in <HI>Summer,</HI> to ripen the Fruits that are the
product of every re&s;pective <HI>Climat;</HI> and
we are furni&s;h'd with Rea&s;on, and made
capable of Indu&s;try, to transfer the Pro|ducts
of one Country to another; we
have Rain, and cooling Breezes in the
<HI>Winter,</HI> of tho&s;e Countries, where Heat
is not wanting, to cool, &s;often and en|rich
the Mould, and to &s;top con&s;tant
<HI>Vegetation;</HI> and we have Fro&s;t and Snow
in others, where the Heat is not to &s;pare,
to lock up the Mould from being wa&s;h'd
away, and keep in either the natural, or
adventitious Heats, till the time that all
Circum&s;tances concur, to have the pro|duct
of the Ground brought to its <HI>Vege|tation.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Come we now to con&s;ider
the <HI>Obliquity</HI> the Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="321">
to that of the <HI>Aequator,</HI> or of the <HI>Axe</HI> of
the <HI>Diurnal Rotation,</HI> to the Plane of the
<HI>Annual Orbit</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> which makes
an <HI>Angle</HI> of 66 &frac12; Degrees. I have alrea|dy
&s;hewn, that if the <HI>Equator</HI> and <HI>Eclip|tick</HI>
had coincided, it wou'd have ren|dred
the <HI>Annual Revolution</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI>
quite u&s;ele&s;s; for if the <HI>Earth</HI> had mov'd
about its own <HI>Axe,</HI> and this <HI>Axe</HI> had been
at right <HI>Angles</HI> with the Plane of the <HI>E|cliptick,</HI>
the &s;ame Appearances as to the
<HI>Vici&s;&s;itudes</HI> of Day and Night, had hap|pen'd,
whether the <HI>Earth</HI> had mov'd
round the <HI>Sun,</HI> or not; and the Alte|rations
of Sea&s;ons, and all the Con&s;e|quences
thereon depending, had not been
at all; and what a hinderance this wou'd
have been to <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Vegetation,</HI> I have
already &s;hewn. Be&s;ides that in the <HI>Torrid
Zone,</HI> the Heat wou'd have been intolera|ble,
and not to have been endured; and in
the <HI>frigid Zones,</HI> the Cold wou'd have
de&s;troy'd both <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
and even in the <HI>Temperat Climats,</HI> the one
half of e'm wou'd have made but a very
<PB N="171" REF="322">
comfortle&s;s Habitation, for &s;uch Crea|tures
as we now are; &s;o that but only
the other half, wou'd have been any
ways, a tolerable Seat for rational Crea|tures,
and five &s;ixths at lea&s;t of the whole
Globe, wou'd have been rendred u&s;ele&s;s.
But <HI>God</HI> who is wi&s;er than Man, has
contriv'd the Matter much better; for by
this pre&s;ent <HI>Obliquity</HI> of the <HI>Ecliptick</HI> to
the <HI>Equator,</HI> we reap one very con&s;idera|ble
Advantage, which is taken notice of
by my very learn'd and ingenious Friend
Mr. <HI>John Keill,</HI> and that is, that we be|yond
the forty fifth Degree of <HI>Latitude,</HI>
and who con&s;equently have the greate&s;t
need of the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Heat, have more of it,
take the whole Year about, than if the
<HI>Sun</HI> had mov'd continually in the <HI>Equator;</HI>
and they that live in the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> and
the adjacent Places, even to the <HI>Latitude</HI>
of forty five Degrees, who are rather too
much expo&s;ed to the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
than too little, have by the&s;e Means,
le&s;s of his Heat, than they wou'd have
had, had the <HI>Earth</HI> ob&s;erv'd a right Po|&s;ition.
<PB N="172" REF="323">
Tho&s;e who de&s;ire to &s;ee the De|mon&s;tration
of this, may con&s;ult Mr.
<HI>Keill</HI>'s Examination of Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>The|ory</HI>
of the <HI>Earth</HI> pag. 71. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> To
the&s;e add, that &s;ince this <HI>Globe</HI> of ours,
has been de&s;ign'd for a Habitation of ra|tional
and irrational Creatures, of vari|ous
<HI>Tempers, Con&s;titutions</HI> and <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions,</HI>
and for <HI>Vegetables</HI> of different <HI>Natures</HI> and
<HI>Virtues,</HI> requiring different Degrees of Heat,
and Nouri&s;hment, to ripen, and bring 'em
to Perfection, (to &s;hew the <HI>manifold</HI> Wi&s;|dom
of the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> in the Va|riety
of every thing.) And &s;ince we find
the pre&s;ent Heat of the <HI>Torrid Zones,</HI> ve|ry
well fitted for all the Kinds of <HI>Animals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> that inhabit and grow there,
the Cold of the <HI>Frigid Zones,</HI> very tole|lerable
to the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> and <HI>Productions</HI>
of the&s;e Places, and the <HI>Temper</HI> of the
intermediate ones, &s;uited to theirs; tho&s;e
<HI>Animals</HI> that cannot tran&s;port them&s;elves,
and the <HI>Vegetables</HI> that require a greater
Degree of Heat, not having too much,
and the like <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> that
<PB N="173" REF="324">
can &s;uffer cold, not having too little Heat,
and the rational Creatures being endow'd
with Rea&s;on and Means, to tran&s;port
them&s;elves where they live mo&s;t at ea&s;e.
And &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible to have ac|commodated,
all the&s;e &s;o various and dif|ferent
<HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> in a place of
an equable and uniform, (or in one, and
in the &s;ame) <HI>Climate,</HI> it's evident that the
pre&s;ent Situation of the <HI>Axe</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI>
to the Plane of the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> is the be&s;t (of
that infinite Variety po&s;&s;ible) that cou'd
be, for our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances; for
by any other very con&s;iderable <HI>Alteration,</HI>
all or mo&s;t of the mention'd Advantages
would be lo&s;t. For all which Rea&s;ons we
can never &s;ufficiently admire, the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI>
of the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> who has provi|ded
&s;o liberally, and prudently for his
Creatures.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The &s;ame divine Wi&s;dom,
is con&s;picuous, in the Situation of the
<HI>Earth</HI> in re&s;pect of the <HI>Sun;</HI> for had the
Di&s;tance between the <HI>Earth</HI> and the <HI>Sun,</HI>
been the &s;ame with the Di&s;tance between
<PB N="174" REF="325">
<HI>Mercury</HI> and the <HI>Sun, i. e.</HI> were we brought
three times nearer the <HI>Sun</HI> than we are, or
the <HI>Sun</HI> brought three times nearer us than
he is, our Ground in Winter, wou'd have
been hotter than red hot Iron, and what a
Condition we &s;hou'd have been in then, we
may ea&s;ily gue&s;s. On the other Hand,
had the <HI>Sun</HI> been remov'd from us, or we
from the <HI>Sun,</HI> to the Di&s;tance <HI>Jupiter</HI> or
<HI>Saturn</HI> are remov'd, our hotte&s;t <HI>Summer
Day</HI> had not afforded &s;o much Heat, as
tho&s;e that now live under the very <HI>Polar
Star</HI> (if any &s;uch there be) of our Globe
feel in the mid&s;t of Winter. Are not
we then very wi&s;ely provided for, who
are put in &s;uch a Mediocrity, between
the&s;e two extream Di&s;tances, that neither
our Heat nor Cold is &s;o violent, but that
we may either endure 'em, or with a little
Indu&s;try fence our &s;elves again&s;t their Inju|ries?
Again, as to the <HI>Figure</HI> of our <HI>Earth,</HI>
tho' it be the nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;ult of the <HI>Earth</HI>'s <HI>Rotation</HI> about its own <HI>Axe,</HI> and the Flui|dity
of the &s;uperficial Parts of the <HI>Earth,</HI> at
the Commencement of this Rotation; yet
<PB N="175" REF="326">
it is very convenient for us. By the
<HI>Earth</HI>'s Motion about its <HI>Axe,</HI> the Parts en|deavour
to recede from the &s;ame <HI>Axe</HI> as
much as they po&s;&s;ibly can, by a <HI>centrifugal</HI>
Force, ari&s;ing from the circular Motion;
and therefore, if the Matter of any of the
Heavenly Bodies, was fluid, at the Com|mencement
of this circular Motion, it
wou'd nece&s;&s;arily have ri&s;en from the <HI>Poles,</HI>
and accumulated at the <HI>Equator,</HI> and &s;o in|duced
a <HI>&s;pheroidical</HI> Figure on the <HI>Planets</HI>
Body, generated by the <HI>Circumvolution.</HI>
of an <HI>Ellip&s;e</HI> about its le&s;&s;er <HI>Diameter.</HI>
Now &s;ince it is evident to our &s;ight, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
with a good <HI>Tele&s;cope,</HI> particularly,
in <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that the <HI>Diameter</HI> at the <HI>Equa|tor</HI>
is longer, than that at the <HI>Poles,</HI> and
&s;ince Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> has demon&s;trated that
<HI>Earth</HI> is at lea&s;t &s;eventeen Miles higher
at the <HI>Equator</HI> than at the <HI>Poles,</HI> its plain
that at the Commencement of the diur|nal
Rotation, the Surface of the <HI>Planets</HI>
has been covered with a Fluid; which
gives an Account why at every forty or
fifty fathoms, below the Surface of our
<PB N="176" REF="327">
<HI>Earth,</HI> we never mi&s;s of Water. It is
likewi&s;e evident from this Figure of the
Body of the <HI>Planets,</HI> that the Surface of
the <HI>temperate Climates</HI> is larger than it
wou'd have been, had the <HI>Globe</HI> of our
<HI>Earth,</HI> or of the <HI>Planets,</HI> been either <HI>&s;phe|rical</HI>
or <HI>oblongly &s;pheroidical;</HI> &s;o that the
Advantage of this Figure is very con&s;ide|rable,
the Surfaces of the <HI>Polar Regions,</HI>
which by rea&s;on of the oblique Incidence
of the Rays of the <HI>Sun</HI> upon them, are
colder, and le&s;s convenient for the Habi|tation
of <HI>Animals,</HI> and the Production of
the nobler Sort of <HI>Vegetables,</HI> are hereby
con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened, and the Surfaces or
Space about the <HI>temperate Zones,</HI> which
are mo&s;t comfortable and u&s;eful, are
thereby con&s;iderably enlarged. The &s;ame
Figure obtains not only in the <HI>Earth,</HI> and
the re&s;t of the <HI>Planets,</HI> and their <HI>Satellits</HI>
but likewi&s;e in the <HI>Sun,</HI> and univer&s;ally
in every fluid Body revolving about an
<HI>Axe.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;&punc; XXVIII. Having &s;hewn &s;ome of the
Advantages ari&s;ing from the &s;everal Mo|tions
<PB N="177" REF="328">
of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and the Combination
of the&s;e, which are common to the other
<HI>Planets,</HI> I come now briefly to con&s;ider, tho&s;e
that po&s;&s;ibly may be more particularly be|longing
to our <HI>Globe,</HI> and are not the im|mediate
Con&s;equence of its Motions; and
the fir&s;t in order is our <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> of
&s;uch Nece&s;&s;ity toward the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of
<HI>Animals,</HI> and the growth of <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
that neither, cou'd be any con&s;iderable
time without it. This <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> is a thin
<HI>Ela&s;tick</HI> Fluid, intermixt with Particles of
different Natures, &s;urrounding our <HI>Globe</HI>
to the heighth, of about forty or forty
five Miles. The Nature and Properties
of this Fluid, I have in &s;ome manner &s;hewn
already. But &s;ome of it's u&s;es I &s;hall now
point out, and fir&s;t as to <HI>Vegetation,</HI> Dr.
<HI>Grew</HI> and <HI>Malpighi</HI> have &s;hewn that it is
a principal concurrent therein, it being
more ea&s;ily rarified, and heated by the
<HI>Action</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> than other more com|pact,
heavy, and le&s;s <HI>&s;pringy</HI> Fluids, is
fitter to promote the A&s;cent of the Jui|ces
in the &s;lender Channels of <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="329">
and there being no Fluid without a con|&s;iderable
Portion thereof, lodged up and
down among it's Parts, the fir&s;t Impul&s;e
of the Juices upwards, does thence ari&s;e.
Moreover, as to <HI>Animals</HI> it is well known,
that they cou'd live but a few Minutes
without this <HI>Ela&s;tick</HI> Fluid, and probably
that which &s;o &s;uddenly kills thunder-&s;truck
<HI>Animals,</HI> is the quick and violent Rarefa|ction
of the Air about them; for the
<HI>Lungs</HI> of all &s;uch upon opening, are found
quite de&s;titute of Air, and the &s;ides of
their <HI>Ve&s;icles</HI> quite clap'd together. It's
certain, that the Blood is &s;ent from the
right Ventricle of the Heart to the <HI>Lungs,</HI>
and if the Ve&s;icles thereof be not di&s;ten|ded
or blown up, by the Air, the <HI>Circu|lation</HI>
mu&s;t &s;top there, and the <HI>Animal</HI>
peri&s;h; and both for the Comminution
of the Particles of the Blood, that they
may more ea&s;ily pa&s;s through the <HI>Capilla|ry</HI>
and terminating Ve&s;&s;els, and for the
Propagation thereof in the wider ones,
there is nece&s;&s;arily requir'd a Fluid of a
determinate Gravity, and <HI>Ela&s;ticity.</HI> We
<PB N="179" REF="330">
have as great Difficulty of breathing, in
a thin as in a thick Air; and ev'n in <HI>Fi&s;h|es,</HI>
where the Water in &s;ome mea&s;ure
&s;upplys the want of Air, yet if you draw
out all the Bubbles of Air, which are al|ways
found in Water, they will langui&s;h
and dye; &s;o that ev'n to them, a certain
Portion of this <HI>Ela&s;tick</HI> Fluid, is nece&s;&s;ary.
Now how well is this Fluid fitted for the ge|nerality
of the Inhabitants of this <HI>Globe?</HI>
it being neither too heavy, nor too light,
neither too much, nor too little <HI>ela&s;tick,</HI>
for the u&s;es of Re&s;piration. Another Ad|vantage
we reap by our <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> is,
that by it our <HI>Clouds</HI> and <HI>Vapours</HI> are &s;up|ported,
without which we &s;hou'd neither
have fre&s;h Water, nor Snow, nor Rain,
nor any of tho&s;e things, which moi&s;ten
and enrich our Soil, and make it fit for
<HI>Vegetation.</HI> For tho' it be the <HI>Sun</HI> that ra|rifies
the Water, and makes it take its
fir&s;t flight in <HI>Vapours,</HI> and <HI>Steams;</HI> yet
its by the <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> it's Progre&s;s is conti|nued
to the upper Regions, and &s;uppor|ted
when it is there, to be afterwards
<PB N="180" REF="331">
form'd into Snow, or Hail, or Rain, or
carried into other Regions, who&s;e Soil
does want it more. Every Body knows,
that if there were no <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> but a
perfect <HI>Void</HI> around the. <HI>Earth,</HI> the
Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> wou'd not be able to
rai&s;e the <HI>Vapours</HI> above a few feet, from
its Surface; and that its only the <HI>Atmo|&s;phere</HI>'s
being <HI>&s;pecifically&punc;</HI> heavier, than
the&s;e <HI>Vapours,</HI> that buoys 'em up in
the Air, by its greater Tendency toward
the Center. Now then, if there were
no <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> the <HI>Vapours</HI> cou'd ri&s;e to
no &s;ufficient heighth, and &s;o cou'd never
be cool'd &s;ufficiently, &s;o as to be form'd
into Snow, or Rain; for at a &s;mall di&s;tance
from the <HI>Earth</HI>'s Surface, the reflected
Rays of the <HI>Sun,</HI> make the Places &s;o warm,
that no <HI>Vapour</HI> cou'd be turn'd into Snow&punc;
or Rain, there; for it's the Coldne&s;s of
the upper Regions, (being de&s;titute of
the&s;e reflected Rays) and the length of
of their De&s;cent, that forms the&s;e <HI>Clouds</HI>
and <HI>Vapours</HI> into Snow, and Rain, when|ever
the &s;upporting <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> becomes
<PB N="181" REF="332">
lighter&punc; than the&s;e accumulated <HI>Vapours,</HI>
they fall down with the Temper of Heat
or Cold, they had in the <HI>upper Regions,</HI>
and &s;o become Snow, or Rain according|ly.
So that its plain, it's our <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI>
that is one of the principal Means of our
Dews, and Rains, and all the Ble&s;&s;ings,
that follow upon the&s;e. A third Advan|tage
of our <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> is, our <HI>Breezes</HI>
and our <HI>Winds,</HI> which carry our Ships
upon the Sea; and purifie our Air, from
noxious Steams, which (with the Concur|rence
of the <HI>Sun</HI>) melt our Snows, and
dry our Ground when over-moi&s;tned;
and &s;erve for &s;o many other Purpo&s;es,
for the Accommodation of Humane Life&punc;
<HI>Wind</HI> is nothing but a violent Motion of
the Air, produc'd principally by its Rare|faction,
more in one Place, than another,
by the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Beams, the <HI>Attractions</HI> of
the <HI>Moon,</HI> and the Combinations of the
<HI>Earth</HI>'s Motions. Without our <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI>
we &s;hou'd have no more <HI>Wind</HI> above,
than under Ground, and &s;o be depriv'd
of all the Benefits ari&s;ing thence. La&s;tly,
<PB N="182" REF="333">
Our <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> is the Vehicle and <HI>Medi|um</HI>
of &s;ound, that Sen&s;e which mo&s;tly
di&s;tingui&s;hes us from <HI>Fi&s;hes,</HI> and the infe|rior
&s;ort of <HI>In&s;ects. Sound</HI> is nothing
but a <HI>Modulation</HI> or <HI>Percu&s;&s;ion</HI> of the Air,
communicated by an impul&s;e, from the
vibrating &s;onorous Body, and propagated
in <HI>&V;ndulations,</HI> through the Fluid of the
<HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> ev'ry way round. Without
our Air we &s;hou'd not be able to hear
the Report of a thou&s;and Pieces of Ord|nance
di&s;charg'd at the &s;malle&s;t Di&s;tance;
we &s;hou'd have no &s;uch thing as Langua|ges
or <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> and what a comfortle&s;s
&s;tate this wou'd be, I leave the Reader
to judge. From all which it's very plain
that there was <HI>Coun&s;el</HI> and <HI>De&s;ign</HI> in the
Contrivance and Production of our <HI>At|mo&s;phere.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The next thing in Order
to be con&s;idered is, our <HI>Mountains,</HI>
without which it were almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
for <HI>Animals</HI> to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or <HI>Vegetables</HI> to
grow, they being one of the principal
concurrent Cau&s;es toward the Producti|on
<PB N="183" REF="334">
of our fre&s;h-water Rivers. It has
been &s;hewn from Calculation, by &s;eve|ral
Per&s;ons, and particularly the inge|nious
Profe&s;&s;or of Geometry at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Ed. Halley,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> rai&s;es Va|pours
from the Surface of the Sea, in a
Year, &s;ufficient to &s;upply all the Rivers
with fre&s;h Water for that time. Now
the&s;e Vapours being rais'd (the <HI>Sun</HI> act|ing
upon the Surface of the Sea, as a
Fire under an <HI>Alembick</HI> by rarifying the
&s;ame, it makes the lighte&s;t, <HI>i. e.</HI> the
fre&s;he&s;t Portions thereof, to ri&s;e fir&s;t;
and it rarifies the Water by the In&s;inu|ation
of its active Particles among the
porous Parts thereof, whereby they are
put in a violent Motion innumerable dif|ferent
ways, and &s;o are expanded in|to
little Bubbles of larger Dimen&s;ions
than they formerly had, and by that
means become <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> lighter, and
&s;o are buoy'd up by the weightier <HI>Atmo&s;|phere</HI>)
in &s;uch Quantities, as is &s;ufficient
to make Streams of Vapours, which re&s;t|ing
in tho&s;e Places, where the Air is
<PB N="184" REF="335">
of equal Gravity with them, are carried
up and down the <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> by the Cour&s;e
of that Air, till they at la&s;t hit again&s;t
the &s;ides of the more eminent and <HI>Moun|tainous</HI>
Places, of the <HI>Globe,</HI> and by this
Concu&s;&s;ion are conden&s;ed, and thus be|come
heavier than the Air they &s;wom in,
and &s;o gleet down the rocky Caverns of
the&s;e <HI>Mountains,</HI> who&s;e inner Parts be|ing
hollow, and &s;tony, afford them a
<HI>Ba&s;on,</HI> till they are accumulated in &s;uffi|cient
Quantities to break out at the fir&s;t
<HI>Crany;</HI> whence they de&s;cend into the
Plains, and &s;everal of them uniting, form
Rivulets, and many of the&s;e Rivers; &s;o
that it is evident the great Benefit of the&s;e
Eminences is not, that by the Shock the&s;e
Vapours get in their Cour&s;e from them,
they are condens'd, &s;o as to be precipita|ted
thereby through the Chinks of the
Rocks, but that afterwards in their Bow|els
they are pre&s;erv'd, till they be of &s;uf|ficient
quantity to form Rivulets, and then
Rivers; for doubtle&s;s our Vapours wou'd
fall in Rain, and Dew, tho' there were
<PB N="185" REF="336">
no <HI>Mountains,</HI> but then they wou'd fall
equally, over con&s;iderable Places of the
<HI>Globe</HI> at once, and &s;o wou'd be &s;uck'd
up in the Ground, or make an <HI>univer&s;al
Puddle;</HI> whereas by the&s;e <HI>Mountains,</HI> they
are perpetually almo&s;t, (at lea&s;t a Nights)
pouring down in &s;ome particular Places,
and there trea&s;uring up, for a con&s;tant
Supply to the Rivers. Another very con|&s;iderable
u&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Hills,</HI> and <HI>Eminen|ces,</HI>
is the Determination of the&s;e Rivers;
for tho' there had been Rivers without
Mountains, (which is hardly po&s;&s;ible) yet
in that ca&s;e the Rivers cou'd only have
run in a &s;traight Line, if they had run at
all; whereas, by the&s;e <HI>Eminences,</HI> plac'd
up and down the <HI>Globe,</HI> the Rivers make
innumerable beautiful turnings and wind|ings,
whereby they enrich, fatten, and
water the Soil of &s;everal different Coun|tries
in one Cour&s;e, make the Tran&s;por|tations
and Carriage over Lands more ea|&s;ie
and manageable, and at la&s;t di&s;em|bogue
in &s;everal Mouths into the <HI>Sea;</HI>
where, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Tides,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="337">
they from Harbours and Ports, for the
convenience of <HI>Shiping</HI> and <HI>Navigation.</HI>
All the&s;e Advantages we have by our
<HI>Mountains;</HI> for tho' from other Cau&s;es,
we might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;upply'd with fre&s;h
Water <HI>Springs,</HI> (tho' Nature &s;eldom is
<HI>Luxuriant</HI> in diver&s;ity of Cau&s;es) yet
without our <HI>Mountains</HI> we cou'd never
have Rivers, nor cou'd the&s;e Rivers have
&s;uch delightful turnings, nor tho&s;e u&s;eful
falls, which gives them an impetuo&s;ity
that may be improv'd to &s;o many delight|ful
as well as profitable U&s;es. Thus we
&s;ee of what Advantage the&s;e un&s;ightly
Mol's (as &s;ome thought them) are to
the Accommodations and even Nece&s;&s;ities
of living.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Next come our Fluids to be
con&s;idered, without which we cou'd ne|ver
have been, &s;eeing they are a very <HI>e&s;|&s;ential</HI>
part of us; that which I &s;hall prin|cipally
take notice of, is, 1. The few|ne&s;s
of the <HI>original</HI> and <HI>primary</HI> Fluids, in
re&s;pect of that va&s;t Number of compoun|ded
ones, which are indeed numberle&s;s.
<PB N="187" REF="338">
The <HI>primary</HI> ones are only four, <HI>viz. Air,
Water, Mercury</HI> and <HI>Light;</HI> three of which
are but &s;eldom much compounded with
others, &s;o that it is Water alone, or <HI>Lymph,</HI>
that is the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> of all our Mixtures, and
it is the parts of &s;olid Bodies floating in
this Fluid, that produces all our delight|ful
and u&s;eful varieties of Liquors; &s;o
frugal is Nature in <HI>Principles,</HI> and &s;o
fruitful and various in Effects and Com|po&s;itions.
2. The great Difference be|tween
the <HI>&s;pecifick</HI> Gravities of our Fluids,
<HI>Mercury</HI> being about 8000 times heavier
than <HI>Air.</HI> Now not to mention the ma|ny
u&s;es of this la&s;t Fluid in Artificers
Works, had <HI>Air</HI> been as heavy as <HI>Mercury,</HI>
it had been altogether u&s;ele&s;s in re&s;pirati|on;
on the contrary, it had choaked us
immediately; and had there not been a
Fluid of the &s;ame weight with <HI>Mercury,
i. e.</HI> a collection of exceeding &s;mall, va&s;t|ly
heavy <HI>Spherules,</HI> in the pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances
of Mankind, I do not know
what a great part of the World would have
done. For the Lewdne&s;s and Debauch|ery
<PB N="188" REF="339">
of Mankind, has brought a great ma|ny
Di&s;ea&s;es to that degree of Malignity&punc;
that I &s;carce &s;ee how a thorough Cure
cou'd be made of 'em, without this Fluid;
for it's certain, wherever any Di&s;temper
ari&s;es from an ob&s;truction of the Blood
Ve&s;&s;els, wherein the <HI>Globules</HI> them&s;elves,
and not the <HI>Serous</HI> part is principally con|cern'd,
that this Fluid, if not ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, is extreamly beneficial; for no|thing
has &s;ufficient force to take away
this ob&s;truction, and to &s;eparate the&s;e
<HI>Globules</HI> from one another, in the extreme
<HI>capillary</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, but a little weighty <HI>Sphere,</HI>
&s;uch as the Particles of <HI>Mercury</HI> certainly
are. Now by this difference of the <HI>Spe|cifick</HI>
Gravity of the Fluids, a Remedy is
provided for all the&s;e Maladies, which I
am &s;atisfied are more than two or three.
But that which is mo&s;t wonderful in the&s;e
Fluids, is, 3. The univer&s;al condition of
the direction of their <HI>Pre&s;&s;ure</HI> upon the
&s;ides of the containing Ve&s;&s;el; for in all
Fluids of what&s;oever kind or nature, this
<HI>Pre&s;&s;ure</HI> is communicated in Lines <HI>perpen|dicular</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="340">
to the &s;ides of the containing Ve&s;|&s;el.
Now this Property of Fluids, which
is &s;o beautiful and uniform, is the nece&s;|&s;ary
Con&s;equence of the <HI>Sphericity</HI> of their
con&s;tituent Particles; for &s;ince by the
third Law of Nature, <HI>Reaction</HI> or <HI>Repul&s;e</HI>
is always equal and contrary to Impul&s;e
or Action, in the &s;ame Direction, con&s;e|quently
the &s;ides of the containing Ve&s;&s;el
pre&s;&s;es the contain'd Fluid, as much as
the contain'd Fluid pre&s;&s;es the &s;ides of the
containing Ve&s;&s;el; and this <HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> of the
&s;ides of the containing Ve&s;&s;el, is directed
in the &s;ame right Line with that of the
contain'd Fluid, but is contrary to it. Now
&s;eeing a <HI>right Plane,</HI> can only touch a
<HI>Sphere,</HI> in a point, and can pre&s;s it in a
direction through that point of Contact;
if this Direction through the point of <HI>Con|tact,</HI>
do not likewi&s;e pa&s;s through the Cen|ter
of the <HI>Sphere,</HI> the <HI>Sphere</HI> will nece&s;&s;a|rily
revolve upon the <HI>Plane</HI> till the Dire|ction
of its <HI>pre&s;&s;ure,</HI> from the point of
<HI>Contact</HI> pa&s;s through the Center of the
<HI>Sphere;</HI> ju&s;t to likewi&s;e, if a <HI>Plane</HI> pre&s;s
<PB N="190" REF="341">
two <HI>Spheres,</HI> in the &s;ame Direction, the
Line of this Direction will nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s
through both their Centers. And &s;o if
there be any number of <HI>Spheres</HI> whatever,
pre&s;s'd by a <HI>Plane</HI> in the &s;ame Direction,
the Line of this Direction will nece&s;&s;arily
pa&s;s through all their Centers. But a Line
through the Center of a Sphere from the
point of Contact, is <HI>perpendicular</HI> to the
<HI>Tangent Plane;</HI> and &s;ince this is the Dire|ction
of the <HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>Plane</HI> upon the
<HI>Spheres,</HI> it is al&s;o the Direction of the
<HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> of the <HI>Spheres</HI> upon the <HI>Plane.</HI>
Since al&s;o the Particles of Fluids, are <HI>Sphe|rical,</HI>
or nearly approaching thereto, and
&s;ince they are &s;uppos'd exceeding &s;mall,
as al&s;o &s;ince <HI>curve</HI> &s;urfaces are compoun|ded
of an infinite Number of little plain
&s;urfaces, it is univer&s;ally true, that all
Fluids of what nature &s;oever, pre&s;s the
&s;ides of the containing Ve&s;&s;els in a Dire|ction
<HI>perpendicular</HI> thereto. And on the
other hand, &s;ince by <HI>demon&s;tration,</HI> it is
true, that Fluids do pre&s;s the &s;ides of the
containing Ve&s;&s;els, in a Direction <HI>perpen|dicular</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="342">
thereto, it's certain that the Par|ticles
of all Fluids are <HI>Spherical,</HI> or nearly
approaching thereto; &s;o that this is now
no more <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> but <HI>Demon&s;tration.</HI>
Now cou'd any thing but the Fingers, and
<HI>Almighty Power</HI> of God, have rounded
tho&s;e infinite numbers of &s;mall Particles,
whereof Fluids con&s;i&s;t? or cou'd any thing
but his <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> have a&s;&s;ign'd them their
true dimen&s;ions, their exact weights and
requir'd Solidities? We &s;hall allow him to
continue in his infidelity who can demon|&s;trate
by what Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> all
the Particles of Water were turn'd of the
&s;ame <HI>Diameter,</HI> Solidity and Weight, and
tho&s;e of Air, <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> turn'd
all of different <HI>Diameters,</HI> Solidities and
Weights from one another; but all of the
&s;ame <HI>Diameters,</HI> Solidities and Weights
among 'em&s;elves.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. What a noble repre&s;entati|on
of the Divine Wi&s;dom does our Fluid
of <HI>Light</HI> afford us! how wonderfully are
its parts fram'd! and with what a prodi|gious
<HI>velocity</HI> are they &s;ent from the Body
<PB N="192" REF="343">
of the <HI>Sun!</HI> its Subtility is almo&s;t beyond
imagination, no Pore &s;o &s;mall as to ex|clude
it; no Stream of it &s;o great, but
may be congregated into a &s;ingle Point;
no Surface &s;o finely poli&s;hed, as not to
&s;catter almo&s;t one half of it; its Rays tra|ver&s;e
through one another, millions of
different ways, without interfering ev'n
in the &s;traite&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages; in one Word,
we are not able to comprehend nor ima|gine
a Number &s;ufficiently &s;mall, to ex|pre&s;s
its &s;ubtility; in every Pul&s;e of an <HI>Ar|tery,</HI>
it runs &s;ome <HI>hundred and thirty thou|&s;and
Miles;</HI> what an amazing, and uncon|ceivable
<HI>velocity,</HI> mu&s;t this be! nothing
but the action of the Mind, can any ways
repre&s;ent it: And then what a beautiful
<HI>Idea</HI> of this Fluid, do Mr. <HI>Newton's la|ter
Di&s;coveries</HI> pre&s;ent us with, ev'ry Ray
is endow'd with its own <HI>Colour,</HI> and its
different degree of <HI>Refrangibility</HI> and <HI>Re|flexibility.</HI>
One Ray is <HI>Violet,</HI> another
<HI>Indigo,</HI> a third <HI>Blew,</HI> a fourth <HI>Green,</HI> a
fifth <HI>Yellow,</HI> a &s;ixth <HI>Orange,</HI> and the la&s;t
<HI>Red.</HI> And the&s;e are the <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>ori|ginal
<PB N="193" REF="344">
Colours,</HI> and from the mixture of the&s;e,
all the intermediate ones proceed, and
<HI>White</HI> from an equable mixture of the whole;
<HI>Black</HI> on the contrary, from the &s;mall quan|tity
of any of them being reflected; or,
all of them in a great mea&s;ure being &s;uffo|cated.
So that now it is not Bodies that
are coloured, but the <HI>Light</HI> that falls up|on
them, and their Colours ari&s;e from
their <HI>Aptitude,</HI> to reflect Rays of one Co|lour,
and tran&s;mit all tho&s;e of another.
Their prominent little Parts, upon their
Surfaces, according to their different De|grees
of <HI>den&s;ity</HI> and <HI>thinne&s;s,</HI> are apt to
reflect back upon our <HI>Organs,</HI> Rays of one
Colour, and of one degree of <HI>Refrangi|bility</HI>
and <HI>Reflexibility,</HI> and to let others
pa&s;s through their Pores; and this one Co|lour
too, is le&s;s or more inten&s;e, accord|ing
as their prominent parts are of diffe|rent
<HI>den&s;ities,</HI> or are thicker or thinner. For
the fir&s;t degrees of <HI>Inten&s;ene&s;s,</HI> in all the
<HI>primary</HI> Colours, &s;eem to ari&s;e from
&s;ome determin'd degrees of <HI>den&s;ity</HI> and
<HI>thinne&s;s;</HI> and the &s;ub&s;equent degrees from,
<PB N="194" REF="345">
the other different degrees of den&s;ity or
thickne&s;s or thinne&s;s, of the prominent
little parts, of the Surfaces of Bodies.
<HI>Light</HI> acts upon Bodies by heating, di&s;&s;ol|ving,
and puting their parts in a <HI>vibrating</HI>
Motion; as al&s;o Bodies act upon <HI>Light,</HI> in
drawing its parts to them, and that in Lines
<HI>perpendicular</HI> to their Surfaces: All the dif|ferently
<HI>reflexible Light,</HI> ob&s;erves this one
Law, that all the different <HI>Angles</HI> of <HI>In|cidences</HI>
are re&s;pectively equal to the <HI>An|gles</HI>
of <HI>Reflexion;</HI> and all the differently
<HI>Refrangible</HI> Rays of <HI>Light,</HI> ob&s;erve one
Law likewi&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> that in all the <HI>obli|quities</HI>
of the &s;ame Ray, to the Plane of
<HI>Incidence,</HI> the <HI>Sines</HI> of the <HI>Angles</HI> of <HI>In|cidence,</HI>
are to the <HI>Sines</HI> of the <HI>Angles</HI> of
<HI>Refraction</HI> in a con&s;tant <HI>ratio;</HI> and both
the&s;e Properties proceed from one, and
the &s;ame Principle, acting in different
Circum&s;tances, <HI>viz.</HI> that Bodies attract
<HI>Light</HI> in <HI>Lines perpendicular</HI> to their Sur|faces,
and that this attraction is equal in
all the <HI>Incidences,</HI> and <HI>Refractions</HI> at equal
Di&s;tances from the &s;ame <HI>Plane,</HI> and the
<PB N="195" REF="346">
<HI>reflected</HI> Rays are turn'd back before they
arrive at the <HI>reflecting</HI> Plane: For if the
<HI>reflecting</HI> Plane, have &s;uch a force of <HI>at|traction,</HI>
that before the Ray arrives at it,
it has already made the <HI>Sine</HI> of the <HI>Angle</HI>
of <HI>Incidence,</HI> equal to the <HI>Radius,</HI> the
Ray mu&s;t reflect, and not fall upon the
reflecting Plane at all; if a le&s;&s;er degree
of <HI>attraction,</HI> then mu&s;t it enter the Body
of the Plane, and proceed in the Line,
that its direct <HI>impul&s;e,</HI> together with the
degree of <HI>attraction</HI> in the <HI>refracting</HI> Body,
nece&s;&s;arily generates. And as there are
different degrees of <HI>Attraction</HI> in Bodies,
which produce their different degrees of
<HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> and <HI>Cohe&s;ion,</HI> &s;o there mu&s;t be
different degrees of <HI>attraction</HI> in <HI>Mediums,</HI>
&s;uppos'd, to account for their different
<HI>Powers,</HI> in bringing the <HI>refracted</HI> Rays
nearer to or farther from, the <HI>perpendicu|lar;</HI>
for it's well known, all <HI>Mediums</HI>
have not the &s;ame <HI>refractive</HI> Virtue. Now
what a beautiful, uniform, and &s;imple
<HI>Theory</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> is here? this is &s;o very
like the <HI>frugal &s;implicity,</HI> and yet the <HI>ma|nifold
<PB N="196" REF="347">
variety</HI> of Nature, that one would
be almo&s;t tempted to believe it true,
were there no <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> and Experi|ment
to confirm the truth of it. I might
likewi&s;e &s;hew here the Art and Contrivance
of Nature, in the production of the <HI>Cohe|&s;ion</HI>
of Bodies. But having been pretty
copious on this Subject already, I &s;hall
only &s;ugge&s;t one very remarkable In&s;tance
of the wonderful Contrivance and Wi&s;|dom
of Nature, in the <HI>propagation</HI> of
<HI>Light, viz.</HI> that a Ray of <HI>Light,</HI> in pa&s;|&s;ing
from a luminous Point, through two
differently <HI>refracting Mediums,</HI> to illumi|nate
a given Point; &s;pends the lea&s;t time
(the refracting Powers of the &s;everal <HI>Me|diums</HI>
con&s;idered) po&s;&s;ible, and con&s;e|quently
when the Ray pa&s;&s;es, but through
one and the &s;ame <HI>Medium, i. e.</HI> when a
Ray pa&s;&s;es from a luminous Point, to re|flect
upon a given Point, it takes the &s;hor|te&s;t
way po&s;&s;ible. This the <HI>Geometers</HI>
have demon&s;trated, and particularly, Mr.
<HI>Hugens</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Light,</HI> very ele|gantly
<HI>Page</HI> 40 <HI>and</HI> 41. Now I appeal
<PB N="197" REF="348">
to the Reader, how <HI>incredulous</HI> &s;oever, if
this be not an In&s;tance of <HI>Coun&s;el</HI> and <HI>De|&s;ign,</HI>
is not this like the Methods of <HI>Pru|dence</HI>
and <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> which will not &s;pend
more time on a thing, than ju&s;t what is
nece&s;&s;ary to do the Bu&s;ine&s;s; which will
not go about, but take the &s;horte&s;t Cour&s;e
po&s;&s;ible, that will bring it to the Place de|&s;ign'd?
He that can re&s;i&s;t &s;uch pregnant
and powerful In&s;tances of Divine Wi&s;dom,
will never be convinc'd.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. I &s;hou'd next proceed, to
&s;hew the wonders in the <HI>Bowels</HI> of our
<HI>Earth,</HI> but our Di&s;coveries are &s;o few,
and our accounts of this matter, &s;o lame,
that nothing certain can be determin'd a|bout
the&s;e <HI>Inner Regions.</HI> Some have con|cluded
that there mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be a
Central heat, becau&s;e they &s;aw that Springs
run fa&s;ter in Fro&s;t and Snow, than in
hot Weather, but that might proceed
from &s;ome of the other more narrow <HI>out|lets</HI>
of this <HI>Ba&s;on</HI>'s being &s;topt, by the Fro&s;t;
and the <HI>Vapours</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> rai&s;es thence,
being kept in. Others have thought that
<PB N="198" REF="349">
within this outer Cru&s;t of <HI>Earth,</HI> there
mu&s;t be a <HI>Di&s;continuity,</HI> for &s;ome con&s;ide|rable
di&s;tance, quite round, and that
there was &s;ucceeding this, a large <HI>Sphere,</HI>
moving after a certain manner, to account
for the <HI>variation</HI> of the <HI>Magnet;</HI> but I am
of Opinion the Cau&s;es of this <HI>variation</HI> is
to be &s;ought in the <HI>Magnet</HI> it &s;elf, and
not in &s;o remote and &s;o far fetch'd a Cau&s;e;
for it &s;eems pretty odd, that a <HI>Sphere</HI>
&s;hou'd be made, to whirl within the <HI>Bow|els</HI>
of the <HI>Earth,</HI> to make a <HI>Peeble</HI> turn
this or the other way above Ground. If
the <HI>Earth</HI> were an univer&s;al <HI>Magnet</HI> (as
it's commonly but erroneou&s;ly believ'd)
then the parts might follow the Nature of
the whole. But tho' it attracts Bodies, as
well as the <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> does, yet it's after a|nother
manner, and from a different Law.
One might as probably expect a different
turn and figure of internal <HI>Orbs,</HI> to ac|count
for the Effects and Vertues of &s;eve|ral
others of the <HI>Metals, Minerals</HI> and <HI>va|rious
Fo&s;&s;ils,</HI> and of many other <HI>Electrick</HI>
Bodies, different from the <HI>Load&s;tone,</HI> as
<PB N="199" REF="350">
of their Brother the <HI>Magnet.</HI> I believe an
<HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> may be form'd, whereupon by
the figure and &s;ize of its parts in regard of
Bodies attracted, this and the <HI>variation</HI> of
its direction might be accounted for; but
this is not a proper Place for the&s;e things.
As for the analogy between the&s;e inter|nal
<HI>Orbs,</HI> and that of the <HI>Annulus</HI> of <HI>Sa|turn,</HI>
I cannot think it holds, the one be|ing
exteriour the other interiour; the one
a whole <HI>Sphere,</HI> the other a <HI>Ring</HI> only:
Neither can I think that this <HI>Annulus</HI> can
be &s;ome remains of the Ruins of a Cru&s;t,
that is fall'n in upon the Body of the
<HI>Planet,</HI> becau&s;e this <HI>Ring</HI> appears to be
regular and uniform, of an equal breadth
quite round, and at an equal di&s;tance
from the Body of the <HI>Planet;</HI> be&s;ides, it
is &s;carcely probable that the&s;e <HI>Planets,</HI>
which like ours, may be de&s;ign'd for the
Habitation of &s;ome &s;ort of <HI>Animals,</HI> &s;hou'd
be &s;o ruinous as this Suppo&s;ition wou'd
make that <HI>Planet</HI> to be. La&s;tly, all the&s;e
<HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> have not that &s;implicity, and
artfulne&s;s, that the Works of Nature and
<PB N="200" REF="351">
Truth carry along with them. If it be true
that all the Bodies of the Univer&s;e <HI>attract</HI>
one another, then it's very plain that
when ever a le&s;&s;er Body (however figur'd)
attends the Motions of, and revolves with
a greater, that that le&s;&s;er Body is de&s;ign'd
by it's <HI>attraction,</HI> to produce &s;ome effect,
that is the Con&s;equent of this <HI>Attraction.</HI>
Thus it's plain, our <HI>Moon</HI> was de&s;ign'd to
rai&s;e our <HI>Tides,</HI> and regular Winds, and
to di&s;turb the Motions of our <HI>Earth,</HI> for
Purpo&s;es that po&s;&s;ibly we may, or may
never, come to di&s;cover; and &s;o the <HI>Sa|tellits</HI>
of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn,</HI> were de&s;ign'd
to attract, the Fluids, or di&s;order the
Motions of their re&s;pective <HI>Planets;</HI> and
I have &s;ugge&s;ted before, that the Multi|tude
of the <HI>Satellits</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Planets</HI> may
&s;erve in their va&s;t di&s;tance from the <HI>Sun,</HI>
to hinder their Fluids (by frequent and
various Di&s;turbance) from freezing; and
the greater number of the <HI>Satellits</HI> of <HI>Sa|turn,</HI>
than <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;eems to favour this
Conjecture. Now this <HI>Annulus</HI> may po&s;&s;i|bly
&s;erve &s;ome &s;uch purpo&s;e as this, &s;ince
<PB N="201" REF="352">
it moves differently from the Body it &s;elf.
But all the&s;e are but Conjectures on both
&s;ides; and as &s;uch I leave 'em. It's cer|tain
that <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> and <HI>Vulcano's,</HI> pro|ceed
from &s;ome Motion and Mixture of
different Particles within the Body of the
<HI>Earth;</HI> it is likewi&s;e certain that its <HI>Strata,</HI>
are not of &s;uch Gravities as a regular &s;ub|&s;idence
according to the Laws of Gravi|tation
of Bodies, wou'd require; which
&s;hews it has not been compounded by
the&s;e Laws. It's likewi&s;e certain, that
we have fre&s;h Water at any con&s;iderable
depth, in mo&s;t Places di&s;tant from the <HI>Sea;</HI>
we have from its <HI>Bowels,</HI> all our <HI>Metals</HI>
and <HI>Minerals,</HI> with all their Varieties,

&sect; XXXV. As it is plain from what
has been &s;aid, that it is only the Blood,
that is recruited by the <HI>Chyle,</HI> &s;o is it like|wi&s;e
evident from thence, that it is only from
the Blood, that all the Expences of living
are furni&s;hed, and that all the <HI>Secretions</HI>
of what kind &s;oever are deriv'd. Now
the&s;e <HI>Secretions,</HI> are made by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of the <HI>Glands&punc;</HI> and a <HI>Gland</HI> is nothing
but the <HI>Convolution</HI> or various folding, of
the <HI>Evane&s;cent Artery,</HI> who&s;e la&s;t Bran|ches
mu&s;t be <HI>Cylindrical.</HI> This <HI>Cylindrical
Artery,</HI> in its windings, &s;ends out &s;everal
little Ducts, of equal <HI>Diameters,</HI> which
&s;ometimes unite in one common <HI>Pore,</HI>
&s;ometimes run into a common <HI>Ba&s;on.</HI>
This Structure is evident, in all the larger
and more con&s;picuous <HI>Glands,</HI> &s;uch as the
<HI>Inte&s;tins</HI> with their Secretory Ducts, the
<HI>Lacteals,</HI> the <HI>Te&s;ticles,</HI> and &s;ome of the
<HI>Conglobat Glands;</HI> and may be &s;een in all
the re&s;t if they happen to be ob&s;tructed,
and &s;o &s;well to become vi&s;ible. And
therefore the &s;ame is rea&s;onably to be
concluded of all the <HI>Glands;</HI> &s;ince
<PB N="208" REF="359">
Nature is con&s;tant and uniform in her A|ctions,
and produces &s;imilar Effects by &s;i|milar
In&s;truments. Now the Nature of
the <HI>Secretions</HI> them&s;elves depend upon
the&s;e three things. 1. The different <HI>Dia|meter</HI>
of the <HI>Orifice</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts,
whereby Particles of a <HI>Diameter,</HI> greater
than that of this Duct, are excluded.
2. The different <HI>Angle,</HI> which this Duct
makes, with the Trunk of the <HI>Artery;</HI> for
it is already demon&s;trated, that all Fluids
pre&s;s the &s;ides of the containing Ve&s;&s;el,
and that in a direction <HI>perpendicular</HI> to
the&s;e &s;ides; and this is evident in the <HI>pul|&s;ation</HI>
of the <HI>Arteries,</HI> &s;ince it is, to that
<HI>pre&s;&s;ure,</HI> this <HI>pul&s;ation</HI> is owing. It is like|wi&s;e
evident that the Blood is urg'd for|ward
by the Force of the Heart, &s;o that
the Motion of <HI>Secretion</HI> mu&s;t be compoun|ded
of both the&s;e Motions. Now tho'
this <HI>lateral pre&s;&s;ure,</HI> is greater, when the
<HI>Velocity</HI> of the <HI>longitudinal</HI> Motion is &s;o,
yet it is not in the proportion of this <HI>Ve|locity;</HI>
for this <HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> is always &s;ome what
even, when the Fluid is at re&s;t, and is
<PB N="209" REF="360">
then in <HI>proportion,</HI> to the <HI>Specifick</HI> Gravi|ty
of the Fluid, nothing el&s;e being in this
Fluid to produce this <HI>pre&s;&s;ure,</HI> and in a
Fluid urg'd by a <HI>Longitudinal</HI> Direction,
as the Blood in the <HI>Arteries,</HI> this lateral
<HI>pre&s;&s;ure,</HI> is in a compound Proportion of
both; whence it is evident that if two
Particles of equal <HI>Diameters,</HI> but of une|qual
<HI>&s;pecifick</HI> Gravities, arrive with the
&s;ame <HI>Velocity,</HI> at an <HI>Orifice</HI> capable of ad|mitting
either of 'em, yet they will not
both pa&s;s, becau&s;e their <HI>Motion</HI> of <HI>Dire|ction</HI>
is different: So that this Diver&s;ity in
the <HI>Angles,</HI> the&s;e <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts make with
the <HI>Trunk</HI> of the <HI>Artery,</HI> &s;eems altogether
nece&s;&s;ary to account for the po&s;&s;ible Diver|&s;ities
of &s;ecern'd Fluids, ev'n admitting their
<HI>Diameters,</HI> and Figures, to be the &s;ame.
For it is not to be doubted, that the Blood
is a <HI>Hetrogeneous</HI> Fluid, and contains parts
of different <HI>Specifick</HI> Gravities, different
Cohe&s;ions, and of different Den&s;ities; and
the &s;eparated Fluid mu&s;t be <HI>Homogeneous</HI>
to perform the uniform Functions of Life.
3. The different <HI>Velocities,</HI> with which
<PB N="210" REF="361">
the Blood arrives, at the <HI>Orifices</HI> of the&s;e
<HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts, for &s;ince the <HI>Secretions</HI> are
made in form of a Fluid, there is no po&s;|&s;ible
Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign'd, why &s;ome
<HI>Animals</HI> are of a &s;oft loo&s;e Texture, and
Union of &s;olid Parts, and why one part
of the Body is of a tender, loo&s;e, ea&s;ily
&s;eparable Texture; others of an harder,
$$r$mer, and more clo&s;e Cohe&s;ion, but this
different <HI>Velocity</HI> of the Blood, at the <HI>Ori|fices</HI>
of the &s;eparatory Ducts. And tho'
the Diver&s;ity of the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the&s;e
Ducts, is certainly that which is of grea|te&s;t
<HI>Moment</HI> in this Affair of <HI>Secretion,</HI> yet
it is impo&s;&s;ible to account, for the <HI>&s;imila|rity</HI>
of the &s;ecern'd Fluids from &s;o <HI>Hetero|geneous</HI>
a Fluid, as the Blood is, from this a|lone.
For &s;uppo&s;e, (as my worthy and lear|ned
Friend Dr. <HI>Cockburn</HI> has very ju&s;tly rea|&s;oned)
the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Particles of
<HI>&V;rin, Gall</HI> and <HI>Semen,</HI> to be as 1, 2, 3. The
<HI>Diameters</HI> of the <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts, of the
<HI>Kidneys, Liver</HI> and <HI>Te&s;ticles,</HI> mu&s;t be in
the &s;ame <HI>Proportions.</HI> Now tho' upon this
&s;uppo&s;ition of only different <HI>Diameters,</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="362">
the Particles of <HI>Gall</HI> and <HI>Semen</HI> cannot be
&s;eparated in the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> yet the Parti|cles
of <HI>&V;rine</HI> and <HI>Gall</HI> may be &s;eparated
by the <HI>Excretory</HI> Ducts of the <HI>Te&s;ticles,</HI>
the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the Particles of the&s;e
Fluids, being by &s;uppo&s;ition, le&s;s than
that of the <HI>Diameter</HI> of the <HI>Excretory</HI>
Ducts of the <HI>Te&s;ticles.</HI> So that upon
this &s;uppo&s;ition of only different <HI>Diame|ters,</HI>
it is impo&s;&s;ible to account, for the
<HI>Homogeneity</HI> or <HI>&s;imilarity</HI> of the <HI>&s;ecerned</HI>
Liquors: for all the Particles of whatever
kind, that are le&s;s than the <HI>Diameter</HI> of
the <HI>Secretory</HI> Duct, mu&s;t be indifferently
&s;eparated there. But from this general
view of the Nature and Manner of <HI>Secre|tions,</HI>
the particular ones may be under|&s;tood.
<HI>Nutrition</HI> is perform'd by a <HI>Secretory</HI>
Duct, ari&s;ing from the terminating <HI>Artery,</HI>
which carries a &s;uitable Portion of the
Blood, to every part to be nouri&s;hed, &s;o
that ev'ry point in the Body, mu&s;t be the
<HI>termination</HI> of a <HI>Secretory</HI> Duct; through
which a proper part of the Blood is
brought. The Blood being brought by

the <HI>Arteries</HI> to the Brain, the <HI>Capillary</HI>
parts of the&s;e <HI>Arteries</HI> by innumerable <HI>con|volutions,</HI>
form innumerable little <HI>Glands,</HI>
of which it's <HI>Cortical</HI> part con&s;i&s;ts; in the&s;e
<HI>Glands,</HI> the finer, and more &s;ubtile, <HI>Acid</HI>
Particles of the Blood, are &s;eparated,
and log'd in the &s;lender &s;mall <HI>Tubes</HI> of the
<HI>Medullary</HI> parts, which are the beginning
of the <HI>Nerves.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Nerves</HI> are Bundles
of fine &s;mall Pipes, ari&s;ing from the&s;e in|finitely
many little <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Cineri|tious</HI>
part of the Brain; and terminating
in all the points of the Body; &s;o that
properly, they are only the <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts
of the&s;e little <HI>Glands,</HI> and the <HI>Secretory
Pores</HI> of the <HI>repo&s;itories</HI> of the Animal Spi|rits;
they are hollow but extreamly &s;mall,
&s;o that tho' the Spirits move in them after
the &s;ame manner, and by the &s;ame <HI>Mecha|ni&s;m,</HI>
the Blood <HI>circulates</HI> through the <HI>Ar|teries,</HI>
yet by rea&s;on of the many <HI>convo|lutions</HI>
of the <HI>Evane&s;cent Arteries,</HI> which
form their original <HI>Glands</HI> in the Brain,
to which they are <HI>Excretories;</HI> And the
&s;lenderne&s;s of their <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Coats, the
<PB N="213" REF="364">
exceeding &s;mallne&s;s of their <HI>Cavities,</HI> and
their di&s;tance from the Heart; the <HI>Veloci|ty</HI>
of their Motion, in re&s;pect of that of
the Blood, is very much abated; however
this &s;low Motion keeps 'em very near full,
and when the&s;e <HI>Tubes</HI> are quite full of
this <HI>nervous</HI> Fluid, the <HI>Animal</HI> is active
and watchful; when they are near empty, it
is languid and drow&s;ie; for this Fluid is the
principal concurrent in <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Motion,
and the immediate <HI>Organ</HI> of <HI>Sen&s;ation.</HI> By
the Motion of the <HI>Heart,</HI> through the <HI>E|mulgent</HI>
Branches, the Blood is brought to
the <HI>Kidneys,</HI> and is there freed of its <HI>Se|rum,</HI>
by their little <HI>Glands,</HI> and is receiv'd
into the &s;mall <HI>Excretory</HI> Ducts of the&s;e
<HI>Glands,</HI> to be carried into the <HI>Pelvis,</HI> and
thence by proper <HI>Tubes</HI> into the <HI>Bladder.</HI>
Much after the &s;ame manner, are their
proper Fluids &s;eparated from the Blood
in the <HI>Liver, Sweetbread, Te&s;ticles,</HI> and
the other <HI>Conglobat</HI> and <HI>Conglomerate
Glands</HI> of the Body, &s;o that it is needle&s;s
to in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e.</P>

&sect; XXXVI. The <HI>Lungs</HI> are compos'd
of an infinite number of little <HI>Lobes,</HI> of
different Figures, and Magnitudes, but
&s;o join'd as to leave but &s;mall Vacuities
between 'em. Each <HI>Lobe</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of an

by the Coats of the &s;mall Branches of the

lie flat upon one another, and by

its progre&s;s through them; but as &s;oon
as this <HI>foetus</HI> enjoys the benefit of the Air,
by its weight and <HI>ela&s;tick</HI> Force, this Air
ru&s;hes in through the Pipes of the <HI>Trache$</HI>
into the&s;e <HI>Ve&s;icles,</HI> and blows 'em up,
whereby they &s;tand erect upon the <HI>Trunks</HI>
of the&s;e little <HI>Wind-pipes,</HI> and give a free
pa&s;&s;age to the Blood through the&s;e Ve&s;|&s;els,
&s;pread upon their &s;ides. And when
by the weight of the <HI>Thorax,</HI> and the
<PB N="215" REF="366">
Action of the Mu&s;cles thereof, with tho&s;e
of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> and <HI>Midriff,</HI> this <HI>ela&s;tick</HI>

&s;pread thereon, &s;eparate the <HI>Globules</HI> of

to unite in the wider Channels of the
<HI>Veins;</HI> and by this &s;eparation of the&s;e

renders it more capable to <HI>circulate,</HI> in the
more narrow pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Capillary</HI> Ve&s;|&s;els.
But, if I be not very much mi&s;ta|ken,
there is &s;till a more con&s;iderable u&s;e
of this natural <HI>Function</HI> behind, and that
is to form the&s;e <HI>ela&s;tick Globules</HI> of which
the Blood principally con&s;i&s;ts. It is un|doubted
Matter of Fact and ob&s;ervation,
that the Blood con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>Lymph,</HI> which
is the common <HI>Vehicle,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Salts, Ra|menta</HI>
of a thick con&s;i&s;tence, (which is
probably the unform'd part of the <HI>Chyle,</HI>

it's certain, that the&s;e <HI>Globules</HI> may be
bur&s;t, as in ob&s;tructions; or may be all

the principal Agent, in all the &s;ubtile Ef|fects

the Sub&s;tance of which Mixture, when

<P>&sect; XXXVII. A <HI>Mu&s;cle,</HI> as I have hin|ted
&sect; XIII. of the preceding Chapter,
is only a bundle of <HI>Fibres,</HI> of which all
in the &s;ame Plane run <HI>parallel;</HI> the fle&s;hy
part of the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> is &s;pongious, &s;oft and
lax; the <HI>tendinous,</HI> is only the fle&s;hy part
compacted, the <HI>Fibrils</HI> of the one are di|vided
into innumerable little <HI>orbicular</HI>
Cells, form'd of two concave <HI>Segments</HI> of a
<HI>Sphere;</HI> tho&s;e of the other, are hard and
&s;olid; the&s;e make the Head and Tail,
which are always in&s;erted into &s;ome &s;olid
places of the Body; as to tho&s;e of the Bel|ly
of the <HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> each <HI>Fibre</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of
an infinite number of little <HI>Fibrils,</HI> ty'd
together by tran&s;ver&s;e &s;mall Threads,
which go from <HI>Fibre</HI> to <HI>Fibre,</HI> and are
call'd <HI>Membranous Fibres;</HI> into tho&s;e <HI>orbi|cular</HI>
Cells, enter an <HI>Artery, Vein</HI> and
<HI>Nerve,</HI> the fir&s;t and &s;econd, to bring and
carry back the Blood, the latter to let in
<PB N="221" REF="372">
(upon any Impre&s;&s;ion communicated to it)
its own proper Juice. Now it's very proba|ble
from its <HI>Acid</HI> ta&s;te, that this <HI>nervous</HI> Juice,
con&s;i&s;ts of Particles which are pointed and
fit to break the <HI>Shells</HI> of the <HI>Globules</HI> of
the Blood. And upon an immi&s;&s;ion of this
Liquid of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> into the <HI>orbicular</HI>
Cells of <HI>mu&s;cular Fibres,</HI> the <HI>Globules</HI> of
the Blood may be actually broken, and
&s;o leave the impri&s;oned <HI>Ela&s;tick Aura,</HI> to
e&s;cape; by which means, the&s;e little <HI>ela|&s;tick,</HI>
Cells of the <HI>Fibres</HI> mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity
be blown up. And thereby their <HI>Longi|tudinal
Diameters,</HI> from Cell to Cell &s;trait|ned:
which wou'd contract the length of
the whole <HI>Fibre,</HI> and &s;o move that <HI>Organ</HI>
to which one of the <HI>tendons</HI> is fixt. This
is undoubtedly the true manner of <HI>mu&s;cu|lar</HI>
Motion, and agreeable to the learned
Mr. <HI>John Bernoulli</HI>'s Doctrine on this
Head. And con&s;equently, all the <HI>Geo|metrical
Theorems</HI> he has di&s;covered a|bout
<HI>mu&s;cular</HI> Motion, are now actual
<HI>Theory,</HI> and Matter of Fact. But I &s;hall
have an occa&s;ion of &s;peaking of the&s;e after|wards.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="373">
Only now, The place of the Pro|duction
of the&s;e <HI>Globules,</HI> and their Na|ture
being thus determin'd, <HI>a priori,</HI> is a
very evident demon&s;tration of the true
Cau&s;e of <HI>mu&s;cular</HI> Motion, which has
been long thought uncapable of being
explain'd. The broken Shells of the&s;e
<HI>Globules,</HI> are carried back by the <HI>Veins</HI>
to the <HI>Lungs,</HI> to be new-form'd, which
is the rea&s;on that <HI>mu&s;cular</HI> Motion is &s;o
con&s;tantly and uniformly perform'd, &s;o
long as the <HI>Blood Globules,</HI> and <HI>Animal Spi|rits</HI>
are in &s;ufficient plenty. For the Mo|tion
of the Joints and Limbs the <HI>Bones</HI>
which are the <HI>Pillars</HI> of the Body, are <HI>ar|ticulated</HI>
one into another, and the one
Extremity of the <HI>Mu&s;cle,</HI> is fa&s;tned to &s;ome
&s;olid part, and the other to the <HI>Bone,</HI>
that is to move beyond its <HI>Articulation.</HI>
So that the length of the <HI>Mu&s;cle</HI> being
&s;hortned, the moveable Bone, mu&s;t be
drawn toward the fixt Extremity, accord|ing
to the Manner and Determination, of
the <HI>Articulation.</HI> Thus the Motions of all
<PB N="223" REF="374">
the more &s;olid parts of the Body are per|form'd.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The Fluids of the Body
are principally propell'd, by the Action of
the Heart, and the <HI>ela&s;tick</HI> Force of the
<HI>Fibres</HI> of the containing Ve&s;&s;els. Now
the Heart is a <HI>Mu&s;cle,</HI> like other <HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI>
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Orders of fle&s;hy <HI>Fi|bres,</HI>
of different Directions, it has two
little <HI>Ears</HI> and as many <HI>Ventricles,</HI> which
are Cavities for receiving or holding the
Blood, as it comes from the &s;everal Ve&s;|&s;els,
or is to be driven to different Places.
The <HI>Fibres</HI> of this <HI>Mu&s;cle,</HI> act by the
<HI>Longitudinal Diameters</HI> of its <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI>
Cells being &s;hortned, and &s;o by the win|ding
and &s;piral Direction of its &s;everal
Orders of <HI>Fibres,</HI> the Cavities of the <HI>Ears</HI>
and <HI>Ventricles</HI> are le&s;&s;en'd or con&s;tring'd.
And it is ob&s;ervable that all the <HI>Mu&s;cular
Fibres</HI> of the Coats of the Ve&s;&s;els, act af|ter
the manner already explain'd. But
the <HI>Membranous</HI> Coats, meerly by their
own <HI>Ela&s;ticity,</HI> being &s;tretch'd fir&s;t by ex|ternal
<PB N="224" REF="375">
Violence. Thus the &s;ides of all <HI>Mem|branes</HI>
are bent or pre&s;s'd outward by &s;ome
included Fluid, but re&s;tore 'em&s;elves by
their own natural Ela&s;ticity; whereas
when ever a Coat con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>Fibres</HI> of
whatever kind, excepting tho&s;e for <HI>Sen|&s;ation</HI>
or <HI>Nutrition,</HI> it is a &s;ure <HI>Indication</HI>
that this Coat acts as a <HI>Mu&s;cle;</HI> for Na|ture
does nothing in vain, and wou'd ne|ver
have di&s;tingui&s;h'd a Coat into <HI>Fibres,</HI>
but for <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Action, when a conti|nued
<HI>Membranous,</HI> or <HI>Tendinous</HI> one, is more
capable of acting by its own <HI>Ela&s;ticity.</HI> So
that the Nature of the Coats, and of their
con&s;tituent <HI>Fibres,</HI> of the Channels, being
known, together with the Range and Di|rection
of the&s;e <HI>Fibres,</HI> it is ea&s;ie to know
the manner of their operating upon the
included Fluid. The Coats of the <HI>Gullet</HI>
are three, the outermo&s;t <HI>Membranous,</HI> the
&s;econd fle&s;hy and <HI>Mu&s;cular,</HI> turning ob|liquely
from the uppermo&s;t end of the <HI>Oe|&s;ophagus</HI>
to the <HI>Stomach;</HI> the third, is
tendinous and <HI>mu&s;cular,</HI> of white &s;lender
<HI>Fibres</HI> diver&s;ely interwoven. The <HI>Stomach</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="376">
has four Coats, the innermo&s;t is Carpet-like,
of white &s;hort tendinous <HI>Fibres</HI> &s;tan|ding
<HI>perpendicular</HI> upon the next Coat,
which is <HI>nervous</HI> and extreamly &s;en&s;ible;
the third is fle&s;hy and <HI>Mu&s;cular,</HI> of &s;traight
and circular <HI>Fibres;</HI> the fourth <HI>Membra|nous</HI>
from the <HI>Peritonaeum.</HI> The <HI>Guts</HI> con|&s;i&s;t
of three Coats, the innermo&s;t is of the
&s;ame nature with that of the innermo&s;t
of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> the &s;econd is of two
Orders of <HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres, Longitudinal</HI>
and <HI>Spiral,</HI> the third is common and <HI>mem|branous,</HI>
ari&s;ing likewi&s;e from the <HI>Peri|tonaeum.</HI>
The <HI>Nerves,</HI> as I have before
&s;aid, are a bundle of fine, &s;mall, &s;lender
<HI>Pipes,</HI> wherein the Animal Spirits are
trea&s;ur'd up for the Expen&s;es of Motion
and <HI>Sen&s;ation;</HI> they ari&s;e from the <HI>Glands</HI>
of the <HI>cineritious</HI> part of the Brain, and
are terminated in all the points of the Bo|dy;
ten pair de&s;cend immediately through
proper Holes of the <HI>Skull,</HI> and &s;erve the
adjacent Parts, and particularly the <HI>Organs</HI> of
four of the Sen&s;es; the re&s;t in a large bun|dle,
are let down by the Cavity of the
<PB N="226" REF="377">
<HI>Vertebrae,</HI> and at fit Places are &s;ent forth
to actuate the &s;everal inferiour parts of
the Body. The <HI>Arteries</HI> have three Coats,
the outermo&s;t is a fine Web of <HI>Nerves,</HI>
and Blood Ve&s;&s;els, for the nouri&s;hment of
the&s;e other Coats, and for the <HI>Mu&s;cular
Action</HI> of the intermediate one, which is
made up of &s;everal <HI>&s;trata</HI> of <HI>Spiral Mu&s;cular
Fibres,</HI> according to the bigne&s;s of the
<HI>Artery.</HI> The third is a clo&s;e tran&s;parent
<HI>Membrane</HI> very &s;trong and compact, to
keep in the Blood which otherwi&s;e upon
the dilatation of the <HI>Artery,</HI> wou'd tear the
<HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres</HI> a&s;under. The <HI>Veins</HI> have
the &s;ame Coats with the <HI>Arteries,</HI> only
the <HI>Mu&s;cular Spiral Fibres</HI> are thinner, be|cau&s;e
of the le&s;&s;er force of the Blood a|gain&s;t
the $ides of the diverging <HI>Veins,</HI>
than tho&s;e of the converging <HI>Arteries.</HI>
From this general account of the &s;tructure
of the <HI>Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> their Actions upon the in|clo&s;ed
Fluid may be ea&s;ily under&s;tood,
the &s;hort erected <HI>Fibres</HI> &s;erve for the at|trition
of the <HI>Aliment,</HI> and for &s;traitning
the Cavity of the <HI>Guts</HI> and <HI>Stomach;</HI> the
<PB N="227" REF="378">
<HI>oblique Fibres,</HI> which make but few turns
&s;erve to propagate gently the included
Fluid, the <HI>Longitudinal</HI> ones to move the
Ve&s;&s;el, and the included Fluid, up or
down in a direction <HI>parallel</HI> to its length,
by encrea&s;ing this dimen&s;ion and thereby
le&s;&s;ening the other, <HI>i. e.</HI> the tran&s;ver&s;e
<HI>Diameter;</HI> the <HI>Spiral</HI> ones by &s;queezing it
tran&s;ver&s;ely, and &s;o encrea&s;ing it in length
or le&s;&s;ening it in breadth. Thus the Blood
being pu&s;ht by the contraction of the Heart
into the <HI>Arteries,</HI> di&s;tends their Coats a|long
their whole length, till the force of
the natural <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> of the <HI>Membranous</HI>
Coat, be equal to the force of this Im|pul&s;e;
then that <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> of this Coat be|ginning
to act, at the &s;ame time the <HI>ner|vous</HI>
Juice is &s;queez'd out from the <HI>Nerves</HI>
by this dilatation of the &s;mall <HI>Arteries,</HI> a|mong
the <HI>Originating Nerves</HI> in the Brain,
and &s;o brings the <HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres</HI> into A|ction,
after the manner already explain'd.
And both the&s;e Forces acting at once,
propell the Blood in a continued Stream,
through the uninterrupted Channels of
<PB N="228" REF="379">
the <HI>Veins</HI> and <HI>Arteries.</HI> And the impul&s;e
of the Heart, propagated only by the
<HI>Membranous</HI> Coat, is that which when
felt, is call'd a <HI>Pul&s;e</HI> or <HI>Pul&s;ation</HI> of the <HI>Ar|tery.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. All <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> is perform'd
by the immediate Action of the finer and
more fluid parts of Bodies, upon the <HI>Or|gans</HI>
of Sen&s;e; the Impul&s;e communicated
by the&s;e &s;ubtile parts of Bodies, upon the
<HI>Organs</HI> fitly di&s;po&s;ed, is through them
tran&s;mitted to the <HI>Nerves,</HI> appropriated
and contriv'd for &s;uch a Sen&s;e, and through
them to the Brain. Thus in <HI>Vi&s;ion,</HI> the <HI>Light</HI>
reflected from the Surfaces of Bodies, is
tran&s;mitted through the <HI>Humours</HI> of the
Eye, and congregated upon the <HI>Retina,</HI>
in the &s;ame manner it was reflected from
the Body, and thereby an Impul&s;e modi|fied
after a certain manner, &s;trikes the <HI>fi|laments</HI>
of the <HI>Optick Nerves,</HI> which con|vey
this Impul&s;e to the Brain. In <HI>Hear|ing,</HI>
the Sound after diver&s;e Modifications,
in its pa&s;&s;age through the <HI>Meatus Andito|rius,</HI>
&s;trikes on the <HI>tympanum,</HI> which mo|ving
<PB N="229" REF="380">
the Bones of the Barrel, and they
the inclo&s;ed Air of the <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> the
<HI>Auditory Nerves</HI> there, are mov'd, after
the &s;ame manner they wou'd have been,
had the common Air acted upon them,
with the Advantage of a better qualified
and gentler Impul&s;e than they cou'd have
had otherwi&s;e. In <HI>Smelling, Ta&s;ting,</HI> and
<HI>Touching,</HI> the <HI>Effluvia</HI> and more &s;ubtile
parts of Bodies, act immediately upon the
<HI>Nerves</HI> them&s;elves, and they communi|cate
this Action to the Brain: So that in
&s;ome manner, all <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> is nothing but
<HI>Touching,</HI> &s;everal ways diver&s;ified. <HI>Gene|ration</HI>
is nothing but <HI>Accretion,</HI> for it is
beyond all doubt, that all <HI>Generation</HI> is
from a preceding little <HI>Animal</HI> lodged in
the Male. I have demon&s;trated the <HI>Me|chanical</HI>
production of <HI>Animals,</HI> to be im|po&s;&s;ible
and unconceivable; there is no|thing
in an <HI>Animal</HI> but an <HI>infinity</HI> of bran|ching
and winding Channels, and their
contain'd Fluids, and no Di&s;po&s;ition or
Arrangment of either, can produce an
<HI>Animal</HI> &s;ince all the parts mu&s;t be form'd
<PB N="230" REF="381">
together, we find &s;ome little <HI>bubles,</HI> or
Blood <HI>Globules,</HI> may be form'd out of the
<HI>Chyle</HI> in the Ve&s;&s;els, and one kind of Li|quor
may be &s;eparated from another, out
of the Blood in the <HI>Glands,</HI> and the&s;e are
all the Productions an <HI>Animal</HI> is capable of,
which can never reach to that wonderful
Number, and Di&s;po&s;ition of parts, an <HI>A|nimal</HI>
con&s;i&s;ts of. Now, &s;ince it is ab&s;urd
to think <HI>God Almighty</HI> is confin'd to a new
Creation, in ev'ry <HI>Generation</HI> of an <HI>Ani|mal,</HI>
and that the&s;e <HI>Animals</HI> them&s;elves are
con&s;picuous in all Male Seeds; it is plain
that they mu&s;t have been all created at
once; and lodg'd in the Loyns of the Ori|ginal
pairs of all the <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Animals.</HI>
Likewi&s;e the Fluids, if they did not move
in the Channels of the&s;e &s;mall <HI>Animals,</HI>
wou'd corrupt and de&s;troy their contain|ing
Ve&s;&s;els. It's evident then that they
mu&s;t <HI>circulate</HI> after a manner proper to
'em&s;elves; tho' doubtle&s;s the <HI>Velocity</HI> of
their Motions is perfectly accommodated to
the &s;mallne&s;s of their <HI>Bulk,</HI> and the &s;len|derne&s;s

in&s;en&s;ible <HI>Evacuations</HI> and <HI>Secretions,</HI> this
Lo&s;s mu&s;t be repair'd &s;ome way or other.
Wherefore, it is not improbable they
may lurk &s;omewhere in the Male, in
&s;ome proper Place, till they be fitted to
be carried off in the &s;oft and tender Fluid
of the <HI>Semen,</HI> to be afterwards log'd in

but the <HI>Expan&s;ion</HI> of their parts, and the
breaking of the <HI>Membranes</HI> that folded 'em
up by the Augmentation of the&s;e parts;
that all the &s;everal Figures and Shapes
they put on, is owing to the &s;everal <HI>Mem|branes</HI>
they are involv'd in. Now were
there no other Argument, but the <HI>Analogy</HI>
between the manner of the <HI>Generation</HI> and
<HI>Transformations</HI> of the&s;e lower, and the
more noble <HI>Animals,</HI> it were &s;ufficient to
per&s;uade any one, who con&s;iders the &s;im|plicity
and uniformity of Nature in all her
Works. But this, with the&s;e already men|tioned
<PB N="233" REF="384">
put it beyond all doubt, that we
are all deriv'd from one <HI>Seed,</HI> and were
once all actually in the Loyns of our fir&s;t
Parent, and have been ever &s;ince, grow|ing
to our pre&s;ent E&s;tate.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. From this general view of the
<HI>Structure</HI> of the parts, and of the manner
how the <HI>Animal Functions</HI> are perform'd,
ev'ry body may &s;ee how <HI>wonderfully we
are made,</HI> how wi&s;ely our &s;everal parts are
fitted for their U&s;es; how ju&s;tly our Fluids
are contriv'd and di&s;pos'd, to make the&s;e
uninterrupted <HI>Circulations</HI> wherein Life
con&s;i&s;ts; how &s;imple, and yet how &s;uffi|cient,
the Cau&s;es of all tho&s;e various Mo|tions,
the <HI>Animal</HI> performs, are. It is
impo&s;&s;ible duly to con&s;ider the&s;e things
without being rapt into admiration of the
infinite <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the <HI>Divine Architect,</HI>
and contemning the arrogant Pretences of
the <HI>World</HI> and <HI>Animal Wrights,</HI> and much
more the Productions of Chance or ju&s;tling
<HI>Atoms;</HI> for &s;ince even <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by &s;ome kind of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Contrivance,</HI> does
&s;o mi&s;erably blunder in the Undertakings
<PB N="234" REF="385">
of this Nature (as we may &s;ee in all the
<HI>Schemes</HI> of the <HI>Projectors</HI> upon the&s;e Heads)
we may be a&s;&s;ured <HI>blind Chance</HI> and <HI>jum|ble</HI>
cou'd never produce &s;o beautiful &s;im|ple
and uniform Effects. Cou'd any of our
<HI>mechanical</HI> Undertakers, with all their
skill and cunning, make but an <HI>In&s;ect</HI> or a
<HI>Plant,</HI> with the &s;ame Faculties and Qua|lities
that Nature does; we &s;hou'd begin
to hearken to 'em. But they are &s;o far
from that, that the mo&s;t exact and nice
Performances of <HI>Art,</HI> come &s;o far &s;hort of
the dead <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Animals,</HI> or the <HI>inani|mate</HI>
Productions of Nature, that a weak
Eye may di&s;cover the va&s;t Difference.
Wherefore of unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>He
that form'd the Eye mu&s;t him&s;elf &s;ee, and
he that made the Ear mu&s;t him&s;elf hear,
and he that indu'd Man with Wi&s;dom mu&s;t
him&s;elf under&s;tand;</HI> and he that contriv'd
&s;o wonderfully and wi&s;ely, and form'd &s;o
ju&s;tly and exactly, all things both ani|mate
and inanimate, mu&s;t needs <HI>Him&s;elf
be.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="386">
But I proceed to make &s;ome reflections
upon the particular In&s;tances of <HI>Council</HI>
and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in the <HI>Animal</HI> Fabrick.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The Skin with its parts is what
offers it&s;elf fir&s;t; The <HI>Scarfskin</HI> being upper|mo&s;t,
is compos'd of &s;everal Lays of &s;mall
<HI>Scales,</HI> which cover one another more or
le&s;s, or lye thicker, according as it, is thicker
in one part of the Body than another;
between the&s;e <HI>Scales</HI> the <HI>Excretory</HI> Ducts
of the <HI>Miliary Glands</HI> of the true Skin
open. <HI>Lewenhoeck</HI> reckons that about one
Cuticular <HI>Scale,</HI> 500 &s;uch Ducts may lye,
and that a Grain of Sand will cover 250
of the&s;e <HI>Scales,</HI> &s;o that one Grain of Sand
will cover 125000 <HI>Ori&s;ices</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Ex|cretory</HI>
Ducts. Now what a prodigious
Number of &s;uch <HI>Glands</HI> mu&s;t there be on
the Surface of the whole Body! Into ev'ry
one of the&s;e <HI>Glands</HI> an <HI>Artery, Vein</HI> and
<HI>Nerve</HI> do enter; &s;o that we may gue&s;s
how prodigious the Number of <HI>Organs</HI> in
an Animal Body mu&s;t be, from the&s;e
that are vi&s;ible to the Eye a&s;&s;i&s;ted with
an ordinary <HI>Micro&s;cope.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Glands</HI> &s;e|cern
<PB N="236" REF="387">
the Sweat and in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration.
And of Nece&s;&s;ity they mu&s;t be many,
&s;ince <HI>Sanctorius</HI> ob&s;erves, that through
them fifteen Ounce weight of a Fluid
pa&s;&s;es in 24 Hours. Next under the
<HI>Scarfskin</HI> are the <HI>Papillae Pyramidales,</HI> in|finite
likewi&s;e in Number; they are the
Extremities of the <HI>Nerves</HI> of the <HI>Skin,</HI>
and &s;erve more immediately for the Sen&s;e
of <HI>Feeling,</HI> to convey the Impul&s;e receiv'd
along the <HI>Nerves</HI> to the <HI>Brain.</HI> About
the&s;e, the <HI>Nerves</HI> and other Ve&s;&s;els make
a fine <HI>Web,</HI> all cover'd over with a mu|cous
Sub&s;tance, to moi&s;ten the&s;e <HI>Papillae
Pyramidales;</HI> and then under this the <HI>Mi|liary
Glands</HI> them&s;elves are plac'd, protru|ding
their <HI>Secretory</HI> Ducts up, to the Sur|face
of the <HI>Scarfskin;</HI> upon which there
are many <HI>parallel</HI> Lines, and the&s;e inter|&s;ected
by others, and in each inter&s;ection
a Hair is planted. In the <HI>Summer</HI> the
Skin is thinner and &s;ofter, in <HI>Winter</HI> more
compact and hard, by rea&s;on of the heat
and cold of the&s;e different Sea&s;ons. The
<HI>Scales</HI> of which the <HI>Scarfskin</HI> is compos'd
<PB N="237" REF="388">
is de&s;ign'd to fence the <HI>Orifices</HI> of the <HI>Se|cretory</HI>
Ducts of the <HI>Miliary Glands,</HI> and
to hinder Objects from making too pain|ful
and exqui&s;ite an Impre&s;&s;ion on the
<HI>Nerves,</HI> and to skreen them from exter|nal
Injuries; the Skin it &s;elf is de&s;ign'd
to wrap up the whole Body, to &s;u&s;tain
and to keep the <HI>Papillae Pyramidales</HI> in
their Places, and the <HI>Miliary Glands</HI> from
being di&s;ordered, to receive the Impre&s;&s;i|ons
of external Objects, and to be the
<HI>Organ</HI> of the Sen&s;e of <HI>Touching</HI> and <HI>Feel|ing.</HI>
Now what can be more wonderfully
contriv'd than this exterior part, if the
<HI>Papillae Pyramidales</HI> or the <HI>Miliary Glands</HI>
had been few and large, then the Inter|vals
had been without any Sen&s;e of <HI>Feel|ing,</HI>
and &s;o might have been de&s;troy'd
without our Knowledge, to the danger
of the whole; and the&s;e <HI>Intervals</HI> had
not been freed from the noxious parts,
which are here thrown out of the Body
by the&s;e <HI>Glands;</HI> but by their infinite
Number, ev'ry point and <HI>Atom</HI> of the <HI>A|nimal</HI>
Body is taken care of. But that
<PB N="238" REF="389">
which is yet mo&s;t wonderful, is the apt
proportioning this Sen&s;e of <HI>Feeling,</HI> to the
Actions and Impul&s;es of the Bodies among
which we live. For had our Sen&s;e of <HI>Feeling</HI>
been ten or twenty times as exqui&s;ite as
it is, then we &s;hou'd have been in perpe|tual
Torment, ev'ry Hair had been a Dag|ger,
the touch of a Feather, or of the
Wing of a <HI>Fly,</HI> had made us cry out,
we &s;hou'd not have dar'd to have ap|proach'd
our Cloaths or our Beds; in
&s;hort, we had liv'd in perpetual Mi&s;ery;
and had it been as many times duller, or
more <HI>callous</HI> than it is, we had lo&s;t &s;ome
of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Plea&s;ures of Life,
our tendere&s;t parts had been as in&s;en&s;ible
as our Hairs or Nails, and might have
been torn away or con&s;um'd, without our
Knowledge or Concern. Whereas by
this nice adju&s;tment of the Sen&s;e of <HI>Feel|ing</HI>
to the Impul&s;es and Actions of Bodies
round us, we can live in indolence from
the Di&s;turbance of the <HI>effluvia,</HI> and Acti|ons
of little Bodies that are nece&s;&s;arily in
Motion; and we feel &s;en&s;ibly enough, to
<PB N="239" REF="390">
hinder us from hazarding the Ruin of our
Fabrick. And univer&s;ally indeed in all <HI>A|nimals</HI>
what&s;oever, this Sen&s;e is adapted
to the Circum&s;tances wherein they live,
which is a notable In&s;tance of <HI>Council</HI> and
<HI>De&s;ign</HI> in the formation of the&s;e Parts.
And it is worth noticeing, that this Sen&s;e
of <HI>Feeling</HI> is rendred more exqui&s;ite and
&s;en&s;ible, or more dull and imperceptible,
as it is more or le&s;s u&s;ed; for it is highly
probable, that the <HI>Scales</HI> which compo&s;e
the <HI>Scarfskin,</HI> and guard the <HI>Organs</HI> of
this Sen&s;e from being violated, do ari&s;e
from the <HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> of touching Bodies upon
the Mouths of the <HI>Superficial</HI> Ve&s;&s;els at
different times, by which &s;ome drops of
a vi&s;cid Fluid is forc'd out, which there
drying and hardning, becomes a &s;mall
<HI>Scale;</HI> and therefore the oftner the Mouths
of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are pre&s;s'd upon, or the
oftner we u&s;e the&s;e <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>touching,</HI>
the more of the&s;e <HI>Scales</HI> are form'd, and
the Skin becomes the thicker, and &s;o a
<HI>callou&s;ne&s;s</HI> grows upon it. And con&s;e|quently,
the more moderately we u&s;e
<PB N="240" REF="391">
the Plea&s;ures of Sen&s;e (the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite
of which lie in that of <HI>Feeling</HI>) the more
lively and &s;en&s;ible they are, and the
more immoderately we u&s;e the&s;e Plea&s;ures,
the le&s;s they are &s;o; which is a wonder|full
wi&s;e Contrivance of the <HI>Author</HI> of
<HI>Nature;</HI> for were it otherwi&s;e, &s;o di&s;tra|cted
is the mo&s;t part of Mankind, that
they wou'd certainly de&s;troy them&s;elves,
&s;ince we &s;ee where there is both Sin and
pre&s;ent Puni&s;hment, they are not kept
from Exce&s;&s;es that way.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. Having already &s;hewn the
wonderful yet &s;imple &s;tructure of the
<HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> I have little more to add upon
that Head. For tho' ev'ry &s;ingle <HI>Mu&s;cle,</HI>
of which there are about 446 in a Hu|mane
Body, either in its <HI>Figure, Situati|on</HI>
or <HI>In&s;ertion,</HI> has &s;omething that &s;peaks
<HI>De&s;ign</HI> and <HI>Council;</HI> yet &s;eeing <HI>Borelli</HI> has
written a whole Book to &s;hew this, and
to in&s;tance in all the Particulars, were to
tran&s;cribe it, or to write a whole <HI>Sy&s;teme</HI>
of <HI>Myologie,</HI> I &s;hall refer my Reader for
his full Satisfaction in this Affair, to that
<PB N="241" REF="392">
learned and &s;urpri&s;ing Book <HI>De motu Ani|malium,</HI>
and &s;hall only &s;ugge&s;t a few In|&s;tances.
1. Then the manner of the Di&s;|po&s;ition
of the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of the <HI>Fingers</HI> and
<HI>Toes,</HI> is admirable. We know that for the
u&s;es of Life, the&s;e <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> were to be &s;trong
and large, that they might be &s;ufficient for
the various, and forceable Motions of the&s;e
<HI>Organs;</HI> now had they been &s;ituated near
or about the&s;e Parts, they wou'd have al|together
di&s;turb'd their Motions, and
made the&s;e Places &s;oft and &s;pungy, and
con&s;equently unfit for gra&s;ping and going:
And to avoid this, the <HI>Infinitely wi&s;e Au|thor
of Nature,</HI> has plac'd them at a con&s;i|derable
di&s;tance from the&s;e <HI>Organs;</HI> and
that ev'n there, they might not in bending
the <HI>Arm</HI> or <HI>Leg,</HI> ri&s;e up and fill tho&s;e
Places with their <HI>Bodies</HI> or <HI>Tendons,</HI>
he has ty'd them to the Bones by <HI>Annu|lar
Ligaments;</HI> and al&s;o that one <HI>Tendon</HI>
might not be interrupted in its Cour&s;e by
another, he has &s;lit &s;ome, that others
might pa&s;s through them undi&s;turb'd,
this is &s;uch a wonderful In&s;tance of Wi&s;|dom
<PB N="242" REF="393">
and De&s;ign, that none can pa&s;s it
over without Admiration. 2. It is very
ob&s;ervable that in <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Motion the
Expen&s;e of <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> is not in Pro|portion
to the Labour the <HI>Animal</HI> is at.
Mr. <HI>Bernoului</HI> in that <HI>Curious Meditation</HI>
about <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Motion, printed in the
<HI>Acta Lip&s;iae</HI> 1694, has demon&s;trated,
that the Expen&s;es of <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> are
in a much le&s;s Proportion, than the ele|vated
Weights; for &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Animal
Spirits</HI> expended, in bur&s;ting the Blood
<HI>Globules,</HI> in the <HI>ve&s;icular</HI> Cells of the
<HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres,</HI> to be as 8, then a
Weight four times as great, as when they
are but as 5, may be lifted. So that
when the <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> are but as 5 to 8,
the Weight &s;u&s;tain'd by 'em &s;hall be as 1
to 4. And the like of the other Propor|tions
of the <HI>Animal Spirits;</HI> e&s;pecially the
Difference becomes mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible between
the&s;e <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> and the &s;u&s;tain'd
weights, when the&s;e <HI>Spirits</HI> are expended
in greate&s;t Quantities. Now what a won|derful
wi&s;e Contrivance and <HI>compendium</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="394">
of Nature is this? Here in great Labour,
the <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> which are the Sub&s;tance,
or rather, the very E&s;&s;ence of the Blood,
are &s;av'd as much as is po&s;&s;ible; &s;o that
a Man who is obliged to hard Labour, is
not reduc'd to the nece&s;&s;ity of having
twice or four times as much Victuals, as
one that is under no nece&s;&s;ity to work.
we all know that the Spirits are the mo&s;t
precious things in all the <HI>Animal Body,</HI> by
which we move, and our Blood <HI>circulates,
i. e.</HI> we live; by which all the Plea&s;ures
of Life are reli&s;hed, and all <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> per|form'd,
by which we have that Liveline&s;s
and Agility, that Chearfulne&s;s and Tran|quillity,
that actuates all our Enjoyments;
and without which, we are languid, and
dull, unactive, and thoughtle&s;s. Now
this, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful a Sub&s;tance,
was to be &s;av'd by all means po&s;&s;ible, and
agreeable to the Nece&s;&s;ities of Life, and
we &s;ee the wi&s;e Author of Nature, has
taken wonderful Care, that no Expen&s;es
&s;hou'd be made therein that cou'd be avoi|ded.
3. What a &s;trange variety of Mo|tions
<PB N="244" REF="395">
are our <HI>Organs</HI> capable of? There
is no po&s;&s;ible one, that might be u&s;eful
to us that we want, and how wonder|fully
is the whole <HI>Machin</HI> adju&s;ted? For
our erect Motion, the Center of Gravity
is &s;o difpos'd, as to fall, by a Line drawn
from it to the Center of the <HI>Earth,</HI> al|ways
in &s;ome part of the <HI>parallelogram</HI>
form'd by the outer &s;ides of our Feet, and
two Lines drawn by our Toes and Heels,
by which means we are kept from tum|bling,
and if at any time we chance to
throw this Line without that Space, and
&s;o be in hazard of falling, our Arms, and
the various Motions of our Head, and
Brea&s;t, immediately bring it back within
that Space. Tho&s;e <HI>Animals</HI> that are de&s;ign'd
for flying or &s;wiming on the Surface of
the Water, have all their &s;tronge&s;t <HI>Mu&s;|cles</HI>
upon their Brea&s;ts, whereby they are
kept in the fitte&s;t Po&s;ture for &s;wiming or
flying, the <HI>Center of Gravity</HI> being &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed
as naturally to keep their Heads e|rect.
And in tho&s;e <HI>Animals</HI> that live with|in
the Surface of the Waters, there is a
<PB N="245" REF="396">
Bladder fill'd with Air, who&s;e <HI>Orifice</HI> is
endow'd with a <HI>Mu&s;cular Sphincter,</HI> by
which they let out and take in the <HI>Air,</HI> to
render them <HI>Specifically</HI> lighter or heavier,
than the Fluid they &s;wim in, and &s;o &s;ink
or emerge as their Occa&s;ions prompt them,
or as they pa&s;s to a <HI>Specifically</HI> lighter or
heavier <HI>Element;</HI> for by taking in more
<HI>Air,</HI> they become lighter than they were,
and &s;o nece&s;&s;arily emerge, and by let|ting
out &s;ome, they become heavier, and
&s;o &s;ink. But this Bladder is commonly
full of <HI>Air,</HI> which is under &s;ome Degree
of Conden&s;ation, from the <HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> of the
<HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> &s;ides thereof; &s;uch to wit, as
renders 'em in an <HI>Aequilibrium</HI> without any
Pain, with that kind of Fluid they live
mo&s;t in, and they commonly alter their
<HI>Aequilibrium,</HI> by the Compre&s;&s;ion or Ex|pan&s;ion
of this Bladder, which being cut
out, the Fi&s;h ever after, either &s;wims on
the Surface or &s;inks to the Bottom. Birds
and Fowls that &s;leep, re&s;ting on one Foot
to ea&s;e the other, naturally lay their Heads
under their Wings, that &s;o the <HI>Center</HI> of
<PB N="246" REF="397">
the <HI>Gravity</HI> of their whole Body, may fall
upon the Foot they &s;tand on, and the <HI>Animal</HI>
be pre&s;erv'd from overturning; and tho&s;e
Fowls that &s;leep &s;o on the &s;mall Branches
of Trees, incline a little backwards, that
their Claws by the <HI>Gravity</HI> of their Body,
without any <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Contraction, may
gra&s;p the Branch more &s;trongly. The&s;e
are wonderful In&s;tances of <HI>Divine Wi&s;dom</HI>
and <HI>Providence;</HI> but tho&s;e who plea&s;e to
con&s;ult that noble Work of <HI>Borelli</HI>'s, will
find to their Satisfaction, a thou&s;and &s;uch
In&s;tances, relating to this Head alone of
<HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Motion.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The Bones con&s;i&s;t of hard
compacted <HI>Fibres,</HI> ty'd together by <HI>Tran&s;|ver&s;e</HI>
ones, after the manner of the <HI>Mu&s;|cles;</HI>
they are nouri&s;hed by Blood Ve&s;&s;els
which enter their Sub&s;tance at &s;everal Pla|ces,
which upon the compleat growth of
the&s;e <HI>Bones,</HI> are &s;o &s;traitned as to admit
only what is &s;ufficient to repair their De|cays.
All the con&s;iderably thick <HI>Bones</HI>
are either hollow or &s;pongious, and both
&s;orts contain an <HI>oleaginous</HI> Sub&s;tance, pre|&s;erv'd
<PB N="247" REF="398">
in little <HI>Ve&s;icles,</HI> which by the Heat
of the Body, is exhal'd through the po|rous
Sub&s;tance of the&s;e <HI>Bones,</HI> to &s;upple
and anoint their <HI>Fibres,</HI> that they dry not,
and thereby grow brittle. All the <HI>Bones</HI>
are cover'd with a very &s;en&s;ible <HI>membrane</HI>
call'd the <HI>Perio&s;teum,</HI> each large <HI>Bone,</HI> is
con&s;iderably bigger at the Extremities than
at the middle, and that for very wi&s;e Ends
and Purpo&s;es: For 1. Thereby the <HI>Arti|culations</HI>
are made &s;tronger, for had they
been le&s;&s;er or equal to the middle, our
Limbs had been in hazard of being di&s;|jointed
upon ev'ry Occa&s;ion. And 2. By
the largene&s;s of the&s;e <HI>Tubercles,</HI> it comes
to pa&s;s, that in all the <HI>Revolution</HI> of the
joint. The <HI>Tendon</HI> is kept at the &s;ame di|&s;tance
of the <HI>Semidiameter</HI> of the <HI>Tubercle</HI>
from the Center thereof, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Cen|ter
of Motion; whereby, in the <HI>Articulati|ons</HI>
of the Shoulder and Knee e&s;pecially,
the Arm and Leg, is capable of moving
round, more than a <HI>Semicircle</HI> which by,
no other Contrivance po&s;&s;ible, but this
cou'd be obtain'd. There are &s;everal and
<PB N="248" REF="399">
various manners of <HI>Articulations</HI> of the
<HI>Bones</HI> into one another, wonderfully fit|ted
for the Motions of the &s;everal Mem|bers,
one is like <HI>Ball</HI> and <HI>Socket,</HI> by which
the <HI>Bone</HI> can move equally any way; as
the <HI>Thigh-Bone</HI> with the <HI>I&s;chium;</HI> others
are by way of <HI>Charnal,</HI> as the <HI>Radius</HI>
with the <HI>&V;lna;</HI> a third are only ty'd to|gether
by intervening <HI>Cartilages,</HI> as the
<HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Back. Now all the&s;e dif|ferent
<HI>Articulations</HI> are from the Nece&s;&s;i|ty
of the <HI>Situation,</HI> or Motion of the&s;e
<HI>Bones.</HI> The <HI>Bones</HI> in order to be the
mo&s;t convenient that might be, ought to
have been as light, as was reconcileable
with a &s;ufficient degree of Strength, that
the In&s;truments of Motion, might not re|quire
too great an Expen&s;e of Spirits, to
move them, and that the <HI>mechanical Ma|chin</HI>
might not become a Burthen to
them&s;elves; now the wi&s;e <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Na|ture,</HI>
has wonderfully provided for this,
for he has made 'em light, by evacuating
their middle Sub&s;tance, and yet they are
&s;tronger by very far, than if they had
<PB N="249" REF="400">
compos'd one &s;olid <HI>Cylinder;</HI> for <HI>Galile$</HI>
has demon&s;trated, that of two <HI>Bones</HI> of
equal lengths, and of equal Number of
<HI>Fibres;</HI> the Strength of the one is to the
Strength of the other, as their <HI>Diameters</HI>
are; &s;o that a hollow <HI>Bone</HI> of a double
<HI>Diameter,</HI> to a clo&s;e one of the &s;ame Num|ber
of <HI>Fibres,</HI> is as 2 to 1, or the fir&s;t is
twice as &s;trong as the &s;econd. This is mo&s;t
con&s;picuous in tho&s;e <HI>Animals</HI> that are
form'd to fly; it is wonderful, how light
and yet how &s;trong, the Quils of their
Feathers and their <HI>Bones</HI> are, and this
wonderful wi&s;e <HI>End,</HI> cou'd no otherways
be obtain'd but by this Contrivance. <HI>Bo|relli</HI>
hath &s;hewn that the&s;e <HI>Bones</HI> are &s;o
many <HI>Vectes,</HI> of which the Center of the
<HI>Articulation</HI> is the <HI>Fulcrum,</HI> the <HI>Tendons</HI>
are the <HI>Ropes,</HI> by which the <HI>Vires Moti|vae</HI>
of the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> elevate, and move a|ny
weight, or overcome any Re&s;i&s;tence.
There is a wonderful, and exactly nice
<HI>Geometry</HI> u&s;ed by Nature in the Figure,
Connexion, Order, and Motions of the&s;e
<HI>Pillars</HI> of the Body, and of their Cover
<PB N="250" REF="401">
the <HI>Mu&s;cles;</HI> it were alone a &s;ufficient
work, to &s;hew all the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ities,</HI> the
wi&s;e <HI>Contrivances,</HI> and prudent <HI>adaptati|ons</HI>
of the&s;e admirable <HI>Machines</HI> for the
benefit of the whole. I &s;hall in&s;tance
only in two or three Particulars, and then
proceed. 1. Then, what can be more won|derfully
contriv'd than the <HI>Backbone,</HI> had
it been all of one entire <HI>Bone,</HI> without <HI>Ar|ticulations,</HI>
we cou'd not have &s;toop'd or
turn'd, but have gone forward like a Po&s;t
or a Pillar; had it been compos'd of a few
<HI>Bones</HI> only, then the <HI>Articulations</HI> of the&s;e
<HI>Bones</HI> in bending our Backs, mu&s;t have
made a large <HI>Angle</HI> upon their innermo&s;t
edges, and &s;o the <HI>Spinal Marrow,</HI> which
&s;ends <HI>Nerves</HI> to all the Inferiour part of
the Body, had been in hazard of being
bruis'd at every &s;tooping; and con&s;e|quently
all the inferiour Parts, had been
in perpetual hazard of being depriv'd of
the In&s;truments of their Motions; be&s;ides
that the whole wou'd not have been pli|able,
for the various Po&s;tures we have
occa&s;ion to put our &s;elves in. If it had
<PB N="251" REF="402">
con&s;i&s;ted of various <HI>Bones</HI> without inter|vening
<HI>Catilages,</HI> we &s;hou'd have had no
more Benefit by it, than if it had been
entire without <HI>Articulations,</HI> or had the&s;e
<HI>Articulations</HI> been after the manner of
&s;ome others of the <HI>Bones,</HI> we had not
been capable of the&s;e Varieties of Moti|ons
that we now are, if each <HI>Vertebra</HI>
had had its own proper <HI>Cartilage,</HI> the <HI>Ar|ticulations</HI>
might have been ea&s;ily disjoin|ted.
So that we &s;ee, the Contrivance of
this Hulk as it were, of the Body is the
be&s;t that can be imagin'd; for by the&s;e
many and &s;mall <HI>Articulations</HI> upon &s;ome|what
plain and &s;mooth Surfaces, ty'd by
a common <HI>Cartilage,</HI> the Back for the Se|curity
of that <HI>Medullary</HI> Sub&s;tance, that
runs down its <HI>Cavity,</HI> is bent after the
manner of the <HI>Catenarian Curve,</HI> by which
it obtains that <HI>Curvature</HI> that is &s;afe&s;t for
the included <HI>Marrow,</HI> and brings the
greate&s;t degree of firmne&s;s; the oblique
Proce&s;&s;es of each Superiour and Inferiour
<HI>Vertebra,</HI> keeping the middle, from being
thru&s;t backwards of forwards, to hurt the
<PB N="252" REF="403">
<HI>Spinal Marrow.</HI> Be&s;ides, had not the
<HI>Tran&s;ver&s;e Proce&s;&s;es</HI> been &s;o plac'd as they
are, to keep the intermediate <HI>Vertebra</HI>
from being thru&s;t backward or forward,
then there wou'd have been no more rea|&s;on
why in <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> the <HI>Ribs</HI> &s;hou'd
have mov'd upwards and forwards, than
backwards. But as they are now contriv'd,
the&s;e <HI>Proce&s;&s;es</HI> force the <HI>Ribs</HI> to move up|wards,
and &s;o lift up the <HI>Sternum,</HI> whence
the <HI>dilatation</HI> of the <HI>Thorax</HI> proceeds, which
cou'd not <HI>dilate,</HI> were there no <HI>Tran&s;ver&s;e
Proce&s;&s;es,</HI> or they otherwi&s;e di&s;pos'd.
Now can there be a more manife&s;t In|&s;tance
of Council and Contrivance than
this. Certainly, if infinite Wi&s;dom were
&s;uppos'd to have fram'd this part, it cou'd
not have giv'n a more pregnant Indicati|on
thereof. 2. As I have ob&s;erv'd be|fore,
&s;ome <HI>Bones</HI> are articulated after the
manner of <HI>Ball</HI> and <HI>Socket</HI> as the <HI>Humerus</HI>
with the <HI>Scapula,</HI> and that for this wi&s;e
End, that the Arm might have all man|ner
of po&s;&s;ible Motions; but the <HI>&V;lna</HI>
and <HI>Cubitus</HI> is join'd by way of <HI>Charnal,</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="404">
that this <HI>Articulation</HI> might be the more
&s;trong, for had it been after the former
manner, we &s;hou'd have had no Benefit
thereby, for that <HI>Articulation</HI> of the Shoul|der,
takes off the Nece&s;&s;ity of another
&s;uch here; the Hand by it, having all the
Motions, that it could have by another of
the &s;ame kind in this other <HI>Articulation;</HI>
and we &s;hou'd have lo&s;t the Benefit of
the greater Strength in this Joint. Thus
we &s;ee, Nature in the&s;e Motions lo&s;es no
Benefit in the &s;everal Parts, that can con|&s;i&s;t
with the good of the whole. 3. Be|cau&s;e
the <HI>Tubercles</HI> of the <HI>Bones</HI> of the
<HI>Fingers</HI> and <HI>Toes,</HI> cou'd not be conveni|ently
&s;o large in Proportion to the middle
of the&s;e <HI>Bones</HI> as they are in others, be|cau&s;e
thereby in gra&s;ping or &s;queezing,
the&s;e points of the <HI>Fingers</HI> which are at
the <HI>Articulations,</HI> cou'd only come into
<HI>contact</HI> with the Body &s;queez'd, and &s;o
the Action cou'd not be uniform; and
by this &s;malne&s;s of the&s;e <HI>Tubercles,</HI> there
was a hazard of bringing the direction of
the Action of the <HI>Tendons</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Mu&s;|cles,</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="405">
which contract the <HI>Finger</HI> and <HI>Toes,</HI>
quite through, or very near the <HI>Center</HI> of
<HI>Motion;</HI> whereby this Action wou'd have
been quite, or almo&s;t de&s;troy'd. Now
to prevent this Inconvenience, the <HI>O&s;&s;a
Se&s;amoidoea</HI> (call'd &s;o from their Re&s;em|blance
to the Grains of <HI>Se&s;amum</HI>) are
plac'd at the <HI>Articulations</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Bones,</HI>
to &s;erve as &s;o many <HI>Pullies,</HI> about which
the <HI>Tendons</HI> pa&s;s, at &s;ome di&s;tance from
the Center of the <HI>Articulation,</HI> whereby
the direction of the Motion of the&s;e <HI>Ten|dons,</HI>
are remov'd always at the &s;ame
di&s;tance from the Center of Motion, of
the <HI>Articulation.</HI> The &s;ame Artifice is us'd
in the <HI>Knee,</HI> by means of the <HI>Patella;</HI>
the&s;e are wi&s;e and noble Ends, which
the Wit of Men cou'd not have thought
of, had they not ob&s;erv'd them.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. How wonderfully is the Brain
contriv'd, how carefully and &s;trongly is
that principal <HI>Organ</HI> of the Body, fenc'd
from external Injuries, by a thick Wall
of hard <HI>Bone,</HI> and two very clo&s;e and
compact <HI>Membranes?</HI> What an infinite
<PB N="255" REF="406">
Multitude of <HI>Glands,</HI> are in the <HI>Cortical</HI>
part, and of begining <HI>Nerves</HI> in the <HI>Me|dullar</HI>
Part, a hundred of which do not
exceed one &s;ingle Hair? How commodi|ou&s;ly
are the <HI>Nerves,</HI> that &s;erve for four
of the <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> and all the parts of the <HI>Su|periour
Regions,</HI> &s;ent out the &s;horte&s;t and
&s;afe&s;t ways through proper Holes in the
Head? And tho&s;e that &s;erve the <HI>Inferi|our
Regions</HI> of the Body, carry'd down
in a <HI>Bony Channel.</HI> And it is very remark|able,
that the <HI>Veins</HI> do not pa&s;s out, at
the &s;ame Holes the <HI>Arteries</HI> enter; for if
they did, then upon any violent Motion
of the Blood, or any greater Quantity
thereof than ordinary, log'd in the <HI>Arte|ries,</HI>
their <HI>dilatation</HI> and <HI>pul&s;ation</HI> wou'd
compre&s;s the <HI>Veins</HI> again&s;t the <HI>bony</HI> &s;ides
of their Pa&s;&s;age, and &s;o occa&s;ion a <HI>&s;tagna|tion</HI>
and <HI>extrava&s;ation</HI> of the Blood in the
Brain, to the de&s;truction of the whole
<HI>Machin;</HI> which by the&s;e different <HI>Entries</HI>
and <HI>Exits</HI> of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els is prevented.
The&s;e <HI>Veins</HI> al&s;o do not run along by the
&s;ides of the <HI>Arteries</HI> in the Brain, as they
<PB N="256" REF="407">
do through all the re&s;t of the Body, which
is al&s;o another wi&s;e Contrivance of Nature;
for the <HI>Arteries</HI> here, were by their <HI>dilata|tion</HI>
to pre&s;s out the Juice from the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
into the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> of <HI>involuntary</HI> Motion,
which wou'd have been hindred if the
<HI>Veins</HI> had always gone along with the <HI>Ar|teries;</HI>
for the&s;e <HI>Veins</HI> wou'd have receiv'd
the impul&s;e of the <HI>Arteries,</HI> and thereby
in &s;ome Mea&s;ure kept it from the <HI>Nerves.</HI>
Next how &s;trongly is the <HI>Heart</HI> built, and
with what a Force does it &s;queeze out
the Blood into the <HI>Arteries; Borelli</HI> reckons
it equal to the force of 3000 Pound weight,
and that 350 Pound weight of Blood, pa&s;|&s;es
through the <HI>Heart</HI> ev'ry Hour. How
variou&s;ly and effectual for its end, are its
<HI>mu&s;cular Fibres</HI> arrang'd, and with what
Judgment are its <HI>Columns</HI> and <HI>Furrows</HI>
di&s;pos'd! for the clo&s;er Contraction of its
<HI>Ventricles,</HI> its point is turn'd a little to|ward
the left &s;ide, for the more ea&s;ie a&s;|cent
of the refluent Blood in the <HI>Cava,</HI>
for thereby like a reclining inverted <HI>Si|phon,</HI>
the left <HI>Auricle</HI> becomes lower than
<PB N="257" REF="408">
the right. All the <HI>Auricles</HI> and <HI>Ventricles</HI>
have <HI>Valvs,</HI> whereby the Blood has a
pa&s;&s;age in its true cour&s;e forward, but
is hindred from returning the &s;ame way;
which wou'd frequently happen, upon
the equal <HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> of the Blood on all Hands,
and the Re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ides of the Ve&s;|&s;els,
to the Ruin of the <HI>Animal;</HI> which
Inconvenience is entirely prevented, by
this prudent Contrivance and Situation of
the <HI>Valvs.</HI> And ev'n the Figure of the
<HI>Valvs</HI> them&s;elves, in the &s;everal different
Places, is for wi&s;e Ends and Purpo&s;es.
But that which is mo&s;t wonderful in this
Affair, is the different <HI>Structure</HI> of the
<HI>Heart</HI> in the <HI>Foetus,</HI> from that of the
&s;ame in adult Per&s;ons. In the Heart of
the <HI>Foetus,</HI> ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Mouth
of the <HI>Cava a&s;cendens,</HI> there is a Hole
from the <HI>Cava,</HI> that opens into the <HI>Vena
Pulmonalis,</HI> and is call'd the <HI>Foramen Ovale;</HI>
there is likewi&s;e a Pa&s;&s;age, which runs
from the <HI>Trunk</HI> of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> to the <HI>Trunk</HI>
of <HI>Arteria Pulmonalis.</HI> Now the Blood
which is receiv'd by the <HI>Placenta</HI> from
<PB N="258" REF="409">
the Mother, is by the <HI>u$bilical Veins</HI> car|ried
into the <HI>Porta,</HI> from which it is &s;ent
to the <HI>Cava,</HI> by a Canal which goes &s;traight
from the <HI>Trunk</HI> of the one, to the <HI>Trunk</HI> of
the other, by the <HI>Cava</HI> it is thrown through
the <HI>foramen Ovale,</HI> into the <HI>Vena Pulmonalis,</HI>
which carries it to the left <HI>Ventricle</HI> of the
<HI>Heart,</HI> by which it is &s;queez'd into the <HI>Aor|ta,</HI>
to be di&s;pers'd over the Body. The
Blood that comes from the <HI>Superiour Parts</HI>
of the Body, is diverted by the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of
the <HI>Cava</HI> from the <HI>foramen Ovale,</HI> and falls
into the right <HI>Ventricle,</HI> which throws it
into the <HI>Arteria Pulmonalis,</HI> from whence
by the communicating Canal, it is imme|diately
carried into the <HI>Aorta;</HI> &s;o that the
Blood that comes from the <HI>Cava a&s;cendens,</HI>
pa&s;&s;es only through the right <HI>Ventricle,</HI>
whil&s;t that which comes from the <HI>De&s;cen|dens,</HI>
pa&s;&s;es only through the left <HI>Ventri|cle.</HI>
The rea&s;on of which Pa&s;&s;ages, is be|cau&s;e
the Blood in the <HI>Foetus</HI> cou'd not
go through the <HI>Lungs,</HI> their <HI>Ve&s;icles</HI> by
their compre&s;&s;ure upon the Blood Ve&s;&s;els,
ob&s;tructing that Cour&s;e; neither indeed,
<PB N="259" REF="410">
did the Blood need to pa&s;s through the
<HI>Lungs,</HI> the <HI>Foetus</HI> being nouri&s;hed from
the Mother, who&s;e Fluids had already re|ceiv'd,
all the Advantages they cou'd reap
from the Air, in her <HI>Lungs;</HI> but when
it comes into the <HI>Air,</HI> and is no longer
nouri&s;hed from the Blood of the Mo|ther,
this <HI>pre&s;&s;ure</HI> is taken off from
the Blood Ve&s;&s;els, by the di&s;ten&s;ion
of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> after the manner already
explain'd. And &s;o finding a free Pa&s;&s;age
through the <HI>Lungs,</HI> it runs no more by
the communicating Canal: And &s;o that
dries up; and by the current in the <HI>Pul|monary
Vein,</HI> the <HI>Valve</HI> of the <HI>foramen O|vale</HI>
is &s;hut &s;o, that the Blood can no
more pa&s;s that way from the <HI>Cava.</HI> Now
how wi&s;ely are the&s;e different Channels
for the Blood contriv'd, for the different
nece&s;&s;ities of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> before and after
its Birth! This is a plain Indication of
<HI>fore-knowledge,</HI> and of &s;uch an one as no|thing
but Omni&s;cence, is &s;ufficient for.
And this is certainly one of the mo&s;t con|vincing
Proofs of <HI>De&s;ign</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;el,</HI> that
<PB N="260" REF="411">
can po&s;&s;ibly be wi&s;h'd for; for to provide
for an Event, that in the natural Cour&s;e
of things, mu&s;t happen a long time after,
is an infallible evidence, that the thing
was fore&s;een, and the Provi&s;ion de&s;ign'd,
by &s;ome intelligent Being. But this is not
the only In&s;tance of a <HI>Precaution,</HI> for it's
evident, all the &s;everal Steps of the <HI>growth</HI>
and <HI>Vegetation,</HI> both of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Plants,</HI>
have been fore&s;een, and fore-de&s;ign'd, by
the wi&s;e <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature;</HI> &s;eeing, diffe|rent
Provi&s;ions are made, and different
Circum&s;tances adju&s;ted, for the&s;e various
Periods of their Lives.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. What a noble piece of <HI>Geo|metry</HI>
is manife&s;ted in the <HI>Fabrick</HI> of the
<HI>Eye,</HI> and the manner of <HI>Vi&s;ion!</HI> Without
this <HI>Organ, Animals</HI> cou'd not provide

of approaching Danger, and con&s;equent|ly,
cou'd not guard again&s;t it; without
the Benefit of <HI>Light,</HI> the animated part of

to&s;s'd up and down by Chance and
Fortune, without Hou&s;e or Habitation,
<PB N="261" REF="412">
and depriv'd of all the Plea&s;ures and Con|veniences
of Life. What a mi&s;erable
State wou'd it be, to be confin'd to per|petual
Darkne&s;s, and never to behold the
chearful Light? the Mi&s;ery of &s;uch a Life
is beyond Expre&s;&s;ion and Conception:
And on the other Hand, what can be
more amazing, than that the Particles of
Matter &s;hou'd be &s;o fram'd, as by their
means to &s;hew us the <HI>Shapes, Po&s;itions,
Di&s;tances, Motions,</HI> yea and <HI>Colours</HI> of re|mote
Bodies? How wonderfully mu&s;t the
&s;everal Coats and Humours of this little
<HI>Ball</HI> be di&s;pos'd, to tran&s;mit through them
that fine, and &s;ubtile Fluid, which is emit|ted
from <HI>luminous</HI> Bodies, and reflected
from the Surfaces of <HI>Opake</HI> ones; and u|nited
on the bottom of the <HI>Eye.</HI> The&s;e
things are not only contriv'd and fram'd
with &s;o great Wi&s;dom and Skill, as not
to admit of a better; but to any one
who attentively con&s;iders them, they &s;eem
of &s;uch a Nature as &s;carcely to allow any
other Method, for it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that
<HI>Light</HI> &s;hou'd repre&s;ent <HI>Objects</HI> to us, at
<PB N="262" REF="413">
&s;o va&s;t a di&s;tance, but by the tran&s;mi&s;&s;i|on
of &s;ome fine Fluid, from the <HI>Object</HI>
upon the <HI>Eye.</HI> And it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible
that any other Compo&s;ition of the <HI>Eye,</HI>
&s;hou'd be equally fitted for that end.
The <HI>Globe</HI> of the <HI>Eye</HI> is <HI>&s;pherical;</HI> it is
compos'd of &s;ix <HI>Coats,</HI> and three <HI>Humours,</HI>
the fir&s;t <HI>Coat</HI> is call'd the <HI>Conjunctiva,</HI> and
makes the white of the <HI>Eye.</HI> The &s;econd
<HI>Sclerotica,</HI> it is thick, hard, and &s;mooth,
<HI>Opake</HI> behind, but <HI>Tran&s;parent</HI> before;
where it makes the third Coat call'd the
<HI>Cornea,</HI> from its Re&s;emblance to a piece
of <HI>Tran&s;parent</HI> Horn, it has a greater con|vexity,
than the re&s;t of the <HI>Globe</HI> of the
Eye, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal <HI>Laminae,</HI> which are
nouri&s;h'd by &s;o &s;mall Blood Ve&s;&s;els, as to
ob&s;truct very little of the Light. It is of
an exqui&s;ite Sen&s;e, that upon any touch,
the Tears might be &s;queez'd from the <HI>La|chrymal
Glands,</HI> to wa&s;h and clean it.
The fourth <HI>Coat</HI> is the <HI>Choroides,</HI> it lies
under the <HI>Sclerotica,</HI> it hath little <HI>Glands</HI>
which &s;eparate a black Liquor, which <HI>Tin|ctures</HI>
the internal &s;ide thereof (which
<PB N="263" REF="414">
is otherwi&s;e of a whiti&s;h Colour) for hin|dring
the reflected Light from di&s;turbing
the Pictures of Objects; this Coat has a
Hole before, which is called the <HI>Pupilla,</HI>
for admitting the Light. The fifth is the
<HI>&V;vea,</HI> which is nothing but the Circum|ference
of the <HI>Pupilla;</HI> it is compos'd of
circular and &s;traight <HI>Fibres,</HI> to contract or
dilate, according to the &s;trength or weak|ne&s;s
of the Light, for when the Light is
too &s;trong, the <HI>Circular Fibres</HI> contract
the <HI>Pupilla,</HI> that their Force hurt not the
<HI>Eye;</HI> and when it is weak, the &s;traight
<HI>Fibres</HI> dilate it, to let in more Rays, for
the more di&s;tinct Vi&s;ion. On the in&s;ide
of the <HI>&V;vea</HI> from its <HI>Circumference</HI> which
joins the <HI>Choroides,</HI> ri&s;es the <HI>Ligamentum
Ciliare,</HI> by which the forepart of the <HI>Eye</HI> is
pre&s;s'd outward, and the <HI>Retina</HI> backwad,
or the <HI>Axe</HI> of the <HI>Eye</HI> lengthned, at the
approach, of too near Objects. The &s;ixth
<HI>Coat</HI> is the <HI>Retina,</HI> which covers like a
Net the bottom of the <HI>Eye,</HI> it is only a
fine expan&s;ion, of the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Op|tick
Nerve;</HI> upon this Coat, the Pictures

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Nature of Finitene&s;s and
Infinitene&s;s, and the Limits of
Human Knowledge.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; I. IT is beyond all Di&s;pute, that
our Minds and Capacities, are
as really bounded and circum|&s;crib'd,
as our Bodies; and that it is as im|po&s;&s;ible
for us to extend our Intellectual
Faculties, beyond their determin'd Limits,
as it is for us to add a Cubit to our
<HI>Stature;</HI> There are &s;ome things, that we
can never by all our Endeavour, attain to
a perfect Comprehen&s;ion of; in vain we
Labour, in vain we Struggle, the Eyes of
our Under&s;tanding are capable of but a
limited <HI>aperture,</HI> and of receiving but a
bounded Object; If we &s;trive to enlarge
it, we perceive nothing, but Darkne&s;s and
Confu&s;ion: We may &s;ooner be able to
<PB N="2" REF="435">
<HI>accommodate</HI> a Line of ten Feet, in a Circle
of a Foot <HI>Diameter,</HI> than be able to con|ceive,
how &s;ome things can be, who&s;e
Exi&s;tence notwith&s;tanding, we are forced
to allow; and &s;ince it is &s;o, it becomes a
Wi&s;e Man to di&s;tingui&s;h between what
he can really under&s;tand, and comprehend,
and where he mu&s;t be contented to be
ignorant.</P>
<P>&sect; II. <HI>Magnitude</HI> or <HI>Quantity</HI> in the <HI>Ab|&s;tract,</HI>
is that of which we have the clear|e&s;t
and ju&s;te&s;t Apprehen&s;ions, as it is evi|dent
from hence, that almo&s;t all Men,
who have apply'd them&s;elves diligently to
di&s;cover, in a proper Method, the Proper|ties
of <HI>Lines, Figures</HI> and <HI>Numbers,</HI> have
agreed in their Conclu&s;ions: The Rea&s;on
of which is, that the <HI>Notions</HI> and <HI>Ideas,</HI> of
the&s;e things, are both the &s;imple&s;t, lea&s;t
compounded, and mo&s;t di&s;tinct, and have
the lea&s;t Influence on our Pa&s;&s;ions, Preju|dices
and Intere&s;ts, which generally give
the <HI>Bya&s;s,</HI> to our Rea&s;onings; and yet for
all this, our Minds can never conceive,
<PB N="3" REF="436">
nor our Imaginations form an <HI>Idea</HI> of an
unlimited or boundle&s;s Quantity. We
may indeed improve either of the&s;e <HI>Facul|ties,</HI>
by Study and Indu&s;try &s;o far, as to
be able to reach Heights that may &s;eem
&s;urpri&s;ing to tho&s;e that do not apply them|&s;elves
to &s;uch Matters; but &s;till there are
&s;ome things, to which we can never at|tain,
there is a <HI>Non plus ultra,</HI> beyond which
all is <HI>palpable Darkne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>profound Ob|&s;curity.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; III. We may call <HI>finite,</HI> that who&s;e
<HI>Bounds</HI> or <HI>Limits</HI> are given; or that which
is bounded on all po&s;&s;ible &s;ides; <HI>infinite</HI> that
which is bounded or limited no way; thus
a <HI>finite</HI> right Line is that, both who&s;e Ex|tremities
are determin'd or given. An <HI>in|definite</HI>
right Line, that, one of who&s;e Ex|tremities
is given, but not the other; <HI>i. e.</HI>
a right Line with but one Extremity. An
<HI>infinite</HI> right Line, that which is both ways
<HI>indefinite, i. e.</HI> a Line with no Extremity at
all. Thus an <HI>equilateral Triangle,</HI> or a
<HI>Circle</HI> of a given &s;ide or <HI>Radius,</HI> compre|hends
<PB N="4" REF="437">
a given or <HI>finite Area;</HI> but of an <HI>in|finite</HI>
&s;ide or <HI>Radius,</HI> (if one may be al|low'd
to &s;peak &s;o) an <HI>infinite Area,</HI> as al&s;o
an <HI>equilateral Cone,</HI> or <HI>Sphere,</HI> of a given
&s;ide or <HI>Radius,</HI> makes a <HI>finite</HI> Solid; but of
an <HI>infinite</HI> &s;ide or <HI>Radius,</HI> an <HI>infinite</HI> Solid.
But becau&s;e <HI>Infinitene&s;s</HI> is of that Nature, that
it neither can be defin'd by us, from its <HI>po|&s;itive</HI>
Properties, nor apprehended, by its
<HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Attributes, we are forced to de|&s;cribe
it, by telling what it is not, rather
than what it is. And &s;eeing before we can
&s;peak any thing di&s;tinctly about the Na|ture
of <HI>Finitene&s;s</HI> or <HI>Infinitene&s;s,</HI> we mu&s;t have
&s;ome Mark or Rule, to di&s;tingui&s;h the one
from the other, there is none, I think, more
certain, than this, that <HI>infinite</HI> is always
greater than any <HI>finite</HI> Quantity, how great
&s;oever; for whatever Quantity always ex|ceeds,
all po&s;&s;ible Degrees of <HI>Finites,</HI> how
great &s;oever, mu&s;t be <HI>Infinite,</HI> &s;ince we can
have no Notion of any real Quantity but
<HI>Finite</HI> and <HI>Infinite</HI> with the Degrees there|of.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="438">
&sect; IV. There are two Kinds of <HI>In|finits,</HI>
or <HI>infinitely</HI> great Quantities; one <HI>Re|lative,</HI>
which is only <HI>Infinite,</HI> in re&s;pect of
another Quantity, infinitely Le&s;s: and of
the&s;e there are Gradations <HI>in infinitum,</HI> each
of which, tho' infinitely Little, in them|&s;elves,
is yet infinitely Great, in re&s;pect of
tho&s;e infinitely Le&s;s. Thus any right
lin'd <HI>Angle,</HI> is <HI>infinite</HI> in re&s;pect of the cir|cular
Angle of <HI>Contact;</HI> And there are o|ther
<HI>Curves in infinitum,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Angles</HI> of
<HI>Contact</HI> are <HI>infinitely</HI> Le&s;s, than circular ones,
as we &s;hall afterwards demon&s;trate. Thus
in the Motions of the <HI>Planets,</HI> the <HI>Centri|petal</HI>
Force, in <HI>infinitely &s;mall Portions</HI> of their
<HI>Orbits,</HI> is infinitely Little, in re&s;pect of the
<HI>projectile</HI> Force, or this is infinitely Great,
in re&s;pect of that. The other <HI>Ab&s;olute,</HI>
which is <HI>infinite,</HI> in re&s;pect of any <HI>finite</HI>
Quantity, how great &s;oever: thus the
Space contain'd between the <HI>A&s;ymptote</HI> of
&s;ome <HI>Hyperboloids,</HI> and a Line <HI>parallel</HI>
thereto, at a <HI>finite</HI> Di&s;tance from it, is <HI>in|finite</HI>
in re&s;pect of the <HI>finite</HI> Space, of an
<PB N="6" REF="439">
<HI>infinite</HI> Length, comprehended between the
<HI>A&s;ymptote</HI> and the <HI>Curve.</HI> Thus the <HI>Expan|&s;ion</HI>
or Space of the Univer&s;e, is <HI>infinite,</HI> in
re&s;pect of the place of Body. And what
is &s;aid of <HI>infinitely</HI> great Quantities, is al&s;o
true of <HI>infinitely</HI> Small ones, for if an <HI>in|finitely</HI>
&s;mall Quantity, may be a Relative
<HI>infinitely</HI> Great one, in re&s;pect of an <HI>infinitely</HI>
Le&s;s. <HI>Infinitely</HI> Small, and <HI>infinitely</HI> Great,
will then become correlatives, and con&s;e|quently
the &s;ame may be <HI>infinitely</HI> Great,
and <HI>infinitely</HI> Small, in re&s;pect of other <HI>in|finitely</HI>
Greater, or Smaller, and therefore
Univer&s;ally, as <HI>infinitely</HI> Great, is to <HI>finite,</HI>
&s;o is <HI>finite</HI> to an <HI>infinitely</HI> &s;mall Part there|of,
as al&s;o, as <HI>finite</HI> to an <HI>infinitely</HI> &s;mall
Part thereof, &s;o is that, to an <HI>infinitely</HI> &s;mall
Part of this <HI>infinitely</HI> &s;mall one.</P>
<P>&sect; V. <HI>Numbers,</HI> are the mo&s;t &s;imple
and di&s;tinct <HI>Pictures,</HI> or <HI>Repre&s;entations,</HI> of
<HI>finite</HI> Quantities, and con&s;equently they
would be &s;o likewi&s;e of <HI>infinite</HI> ones, if
an <HI>infinite Number</HI> were a&s;&s;ignable; But
&s;eeing &s;uch a thing, is impo&s;&s;ible, we mu&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="440">
con&s;ider how any <HI>finite</HI> determin'd <HI>Number,</HI>
is increas'd or dimini&s;h'd, and go on in
increa&s;ing, or dimini&s;hing <HI>in infinitum,</HI> and
thus frame our Notions of <HI>infinitely</HI> great
or <HI>&s;mall Numbers;</HI> Thus, if we add <HI>unity</HI>
perpetually to it&s;elf, we &s;hall have as great
a <HI>finite Number</HI> as we de&s;ire, and if we con|tinue
thus adding <HI>in infinitum,</HI> we &s;hall at la&s;t
have a <HI>Number</HI> greater than any <HI>finite</HI> one,
how great &s;oever; <HI>i. e.</HI> we &s;hall have an <HI>in|finite
Number,</HI> not actually, becau&s;e we can
never actually go thro' the&s;e <HI>infinite</HI> Additi|ons;
But Virtually, <HI>i. e.</HI> we &s;hall have the
Progre&s;&s;ion, or the Repre&s;entation of the
Nature, of &s;uch a <HI>Number,</HI> who&s;e Sum at la&s;t
would be equal to an <HI>infinite Number</HI> of Uni|ties,
or other <HI>finite Numbers.</HI> And becau&s;e
a con&s;tant Addition, &s;o many times, of a
determin'd <HI>Number,</HI> is equivalent to a Mul|tiplication
of &s;uch a <HI>Number,</HI> by &s;uch ano|ther
<HI>Number,</HI> therefore what may be had
by a perpetual Addition, may be more
ea&s;ily obtained, by &s;ome one or more Mul|tiplications,
join'd together. Likewi&s;e,
as by a perpetual Subtraction, from any
<PB N="8" REF="441">
<HI>finite Number</HI> how Great &s;oever, of one or
more unites, we &s;hall at la&s;t obtain a re|mainder,
equal to any finite Number, how
&s;mall &s;oever, &s;o by &s;uch a Subtraction per|petuated
<HI>in infinitum,</HI> we &s;hould obtain a
<HI>Number,</HI> &s;maller then any <HI>finite Number,</HI> how
&s;mall &s;oever, <HI>i. e.</HI> an <HI>infinitely</HI> &s;mall <HI>Number.</HI>
And becau&s;e Divi&s;ion is only a perpetual
Subtraction of &s;uch a <HI>Number,</HI> &s;o many times
as the Divi&s;or implies, therefore, whatever
may be obtained in this Ca&s;e by Subtra|ction,
may be al&s;o had by Divi&s;ion. But
here it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that the whole
Force of this manner of generating an <HI>infi|nitely</HI>
great or &s;mall <HI>Number,</HI> lies in the <HI>in|finitely</HI>
perpetuated arithmetical Operations,
upon finite given <HI>Numbers;</HI> not that the&s;e
Operations, in any finite time, can actually
compleat or exhibit the <HI>infinite Number</HI> re|quired.
But that the&s;e continued <HI>in infini|tum,</HI>
would at la&s;t exhibit them, if &s;uch a
thing were to be obtain'd.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="442">
&sect; VI. That <HI>infinitene&s;s</HI> implies no Con|tradiction,
in its Import or Signification,
(as &s;ome have thought) is evident from
both the ways ju&s;t now mentioned, of ge|nerating
an <HI>infinitely</HI> great or &s;mall <HI>Number,</HI>
which may repre&s;ent any <HI>infinitely</HI> great or
&s;mall Quantity what&s;oever; for what&s;o|ever
has once been, implies no Contradi|ction
it &s;hould be again, and if a <HI>finite
Number,</HI> or Quantity may be once added
to it&s;elf, it may be again added to it&s;elf,
and again, and a third time, and con&s;e|quently
it implies no Contradiction it
&s;hould go on con&s;tantly, in being added to
it&s;elf, <HI>in infinitum;</HI> and the Sum of all
the&s;e, would make a Number greater than
any <HI>finite Number,</HI> how great &s;oever; <HI>i. e.</HI>
an <HI>infinite Number.</HI> Again, if you can mul|tiply
a <HI>Number</HI> by it&s;elf, you may do it a|gain,
and again, at lea&s;t it implies no Con|tradiction,
it &s;hould be &s;o multiply'd; and
after an a&s;&s;ignable <HI>Number</HI> of &s;uch Multi|plications,
it may be &s;till multiply'd by
$t&s;elf, or another <HI>Number;</HI> and &s;o it im|plies
<PB N="10" REF="443">
no Contradiction, it &s;hould be &s;till
going on in Multiplying; the Product of
all which Multiplications, and the Sum of
all which Products, would make a <HI>Number</HI>
greater then any <HI>finite</HI> one, how great &s;oe|ver,
<HI>i. e.</HI> an <HI>infinite Number.</HI> Likewi&s;e it's
certain that between any two given Terms
an <HI>infinite</HI> Number, of <HI>Geometrical</HI> mean
Proportionals, can imply no Contradiction,
&s;ince we can a&s;&s;ign their Sum; thus be|twixt
&frac12; and 0 the Sum of an infinite Num|ber
of mean <HI>Proportionals,</HI> at the rate of 2
to 1 is equal to Unity; and &s;ince the Sum
is a&s;&s;ignable, the Parts can imply no Con|tradiction;
and univer&s;ally betwixt <GAP DESC="MATH"> and 0,
there and an infinite Number of mean
<HI>Proportionals,</HI> in the <HI>ratio</HI> of <HI>a</HI> to 1, who&s;e
Sum is <GAP DESC="MATH">, and the mean <HI>Proportionals</HI>
them&s;elves, are <GAP DESC="MATH">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Be&s;ides, the
whole <HI>ab&s;tract Geometry,</HI> depends upon the
po&s;&s;ibility of <HI>infinitely</HI> great, and &s;mall
Quantities, and the Truth's di&s;cover'd by
<HI>Methods,</HI> which depend upon the&s;e Sup|po&s;itions,
<PB N="11" REF="444">
are confirm'd by other <HI>Methods,</HI>
which have other Foundations; and they
are too well &s;upported, to allow of any
He&s;itation, in tho&s;e that are throughly ac|quainted
with this Science. In&s;tances are
needle&s;s, &s;ince whoever does under&s;tand
the&s;e things, need not be told this.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. But that <HI>Infinitene&s;s,</HI> involves no
Contradiction in its Import or Signification,
is evident from the nece&s;&s;ity of allowing
both <HI>Exten&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Duration</HI> to be bound|le&s;s,
and Quantity to be infinitely Divi&s;i|ble;
for, 1. That the <HI>Exten&s;ion,</HI> of the
Univer&s;e is boundle&s;s, is evident from
hence, that whereever we &s;top, there mu&s;t
be &s;till further <HI>Exten&s;ion;</HI> for every Limit
is the termination of two Di&s;tances in the
&s;ame right Line, one going forward, the
other backward, from the Limiting Point,
and whereever our Imagination may place
the <HI>Limits</HI> of the <HI>Exten&s;ion,</HI> of the Univer&s;e,
yet a little further Reflection, will convince
us, there mu&s;t be <HI>Exten&s;ion</HI> beyond the&s;e <HI>Li|mits,</HI>
for in <HI>Exten&s;ion,</HI> the end of one Part of
<PB N="12" REF="445">
it, is the beginning of another, and &s;o it
mu&s;t go on without Bounds or Limits.
Moreover, if the <HI>Exten&s;ion</HI> of the Univer&s;e
is <HI>finite</HI> only, then a <HI>Sphere</HI> of a finite <HI>Dia|meter,</HI>
may be found equal to it, for a <HI>Cube</HI>
of a <HI>finite</HI> &s;ide, may be found equal to any
finite Content what&s;oever, as is well
known; and the <HI>Radius</HI> of a <HI>Sphere</HI> equal
to this <HI>Cube,</HI> is the Product of the &s;ide of
the <HI>Cube</HI> multiply'd, into the <HI>Cube Root</HI> of 3/2
parts of the <HI>ratio</HI> of the <HI>Radius</HI> to the <HI>Circum|ference.</HI>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
Let us then &s;uppo&s;e the whole fi|nite
<HI>Exten&s;ion</HI> of the Univer&s;e, equal to the
<PB N="13" REF="446">
<HI>Sphere,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Radius</HI> is <HI>AB,</HI> let this <HI>Sphere</HI>
be cut by a plane through its Center, and
the Section, be the <HI>Circle ADFE;</HI> it's certain
from the <HI>Elements</HI> of <HI>Euclid,</HI> that to any gi|ven
Point <HI>A,</HI> a <HI>Tangent AC,</HI> may be drawn,
of which only the Point <HI>A</HI> falls upon the
<HI>Circle,</HI> the re&s;t falling without it; from
whence it's evident, that there mu&s;t be <HI>Ex|ten&s;ion</HI>
without this Circle, or the <HI>Sphere</HI> by
the Section of which it is generated; &s;ince
a plane pa&s;&s;ing through this <HI>Tangent,</HI> will
only touch the <HI>Sphere</HI> in the Point <HI>A,</HI> by
which there will an extended Di&s;tance re|main,
between the <HI>Circumference</HI> of the
<HI>Sphere</HI> and the <HI>Tangent</HI> in all their Points ex|cepting
one, and &s;ince this is true, of every
finite <HI>Exten&s;ion</HI> how great &s;oever, it's evident
the <HI>Exten&s;ion</HI> of the Univer&s;e is greater than
any finite <HI>Exten&s;ion.</HI> 2. As to <HI>Duration,</HI> it
is evident, that it both has been without a
beginning, and mu&s;t be without an end,
for whether this Univer&s;e had a beginning
or not, yet time or <HI>Duration</HI> mu&s;t have for
ever been; there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, of
admitting &s;ome real Being to have been for
<PB N="14" REF="447">
ever, as I have already demon&s;trated, in
the preceding Chapters; and con&s;equent|ly
the <HI>Duration</HI> of this Being, has been for
ever; and &s;ince &s;ome real thing mu&s;t for
ever <HI>exi&s;t,</HI> therefore the Duration of this
thing mu&s;t for ever be; &s;o that it's evident,
whatever <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> we go upon,
<HI>Duration</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>infinite</HI> both <HI>&agrave; parte ante,
&amp; po&s;t,</HI> as the Schools &s;peak. Be&s;ides,
were there nothing actually exi&s;ting, yet
time could not be &s;aid not to exi&s;t, for
we cannot &s;uppo&s;e a time, when time was
not, the very Suppo&s;ition, de&s;troying it|&s;elf,
wherefore <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Duration,</HI> is, and
mu&s;t be <HI>infinite.</HI> 3. The infinite <HI>Divi&s;ibi|lity</HI>
of Quantity is &s;o plain, and demon|&s;trated
from &s;o many different Principles,
that it were needle&s;s to dwell upon it, the

no Relation to, nor Dependance upon one

a&s;&s;ignable Proportion, for the&s;e only have a
Proportion to one another, which by finite

from whence it is evident, that <HI>finite</HI>
is no part of <HI>infinite,</HI> and that <HI>finite</HI> can nei|ther
be added to, nor &s;ub&s;tracted from <HI>infi|nite,</HI>
for only the&s;e things that are of the &s;ame

in the <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of <HI>finites,</HI> all <HI>infinites</HI>
are to be thrown away, as no parts of the

any <HI>infinitely</HI> great or little Quantity, of a
higher Rank, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e of a lower,
for when the Proportion between any kinds
of <HI>infinites,</HI> (either <HI>infinitely</HI> Great or <HI>infi|nitely</HI>
Small) is the &s;ame, as that between
an <HI>infinite</HI> of the lowe&s;t kind and a <HI>finite,</HI>
then in the <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of &s;uch <HI>infinites,</HI> the
lower is to be rejected, in the <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of
the higher kind; thus the &s;quare Root, of
an <HI>infinite</HI> Quantity, is to be thrown away,
in the <HI>Arithmetick</HI> of the Squares of <HI>infinite</HI>
Quantities; and the Squares, in that of the
<HI>Cubes,</HI> and &s;o in the higer Powers. But
<PB N="22" REF="455">
in <HI>infinitely</HI> &s;mall Quantities, the contrary
obtains, by rea&s;on that the Product of the

the Proportion of <HI>finite</HI> to <HI>infinite</HI> ob|tains,

the la&s;t thing we attain to, when we are

Under&s;tandings open, we are capable to
advance, and if our Capacities did con|&s;tantly
enlarge and encrea&s;e, we might per|haps,
come di&s;tinctly to conceive the

<P>&sect; XVIII. Having thus explain'd, the
Relations of <HI>Infinites</HI> to one another, I &s;hall
only &s;ubjoin this General Reflexion upon
the whole Di&s;cour&s;e, that <HI>Infinites</HI> of all
Kinds, as to their po&s;itive Nature, are e|qually
<PB N="67" REF="500">
above our Comprehen&s;ion, it is the
&s;ame thing as to us, whether they be &s;im|ply
<HI>infinite,</HI> or infinitely <HI>infinite,</HI> their e&s;&s;en|tial
and po&s;itive Proprieties are equally be|yond
our reach, as the <HI>fixt Stars</HI> &s;eem to
our Eyes, as it were, all &s;tuck into the &s;ame
<HI>Concave Sphere,</HI> tho' they be at various, if
not infinitely different Di&s;tances from us.
And therefore in our Inquiries about the Na|ture
and Proprieties of things, we ought to
pa&s;s over all tho&s;e in which Infinity is con|cern'd,
as being without our <HI>Sphere,</HI> and
not belonging to our Province: where Fi|nity
is only concern'd, there we may la|bour,
and hope for Succe&s;s, God Almighty
having given us Capacities, adequate for
&s;uch <HI>Re&s;erches;</HI> but where ever <HI>Infinity</HI> in
its <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> Nature, and <HI>po&s;itive</HI> Qualities, is
involv'd, there we have nothing to do,
but to leave the Matter as we find it; and
this Reflexion may be of u&s;e to us, in
quieting our Minds, about the Difficulties
ari&s;ing in the conception of tho&s;e things,
where the po&s;itive Nature of Infinites, are
nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood; and &s;uch are &s;e|veral
<PB N="68" REF="501">
Subjects, both of Philo&s;ophy and
Religion. God Almighty cannot be &s;up|pos'd
to work Contradictions, and if we be
Creatures, we mu&s;t partake of the e&s;&s;ential
Natures of &s;uch, and by con&s;equence, be
of finite Capacities and Faculties, and &s;o it
is impo&s;&s;ible even for him to make us un|der&s;tand
the po&s;itive Nature and Qualities
of <HI>Infinites.</HI> And no wi&s;e Man will at|tempt
what it's impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould obtain,
nor be di&s;quieted at what he can never
help.</P>
