<HEAD>CIVIC SERMONS
TO THE
PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Nay, why even of your&s;elves, judge ye not
what is right.</HEAD>
<P>MY BRETHREN&mdash;I call you by
this title becau&s;e we are all truly
brethren; not, as &s;ome of the heathens
imagined, of different <HI>races,</HI> &s;prung, &s;ome
of them from the earth, and others deriv|ing
their origin from the gods; but being
all de&s;cended from one earthly father,
namely Adam, and all created by one hea|venly
<PB N="4" REF="3">
father, namely the one only God
of the Univer&s;e. I have called the&s;e Ser|mons.
A Sermon is a di&s;cour&s;e. Your
cattle cannot di&s;cour&s;e; they like each
other's company, they herd together,
they have a variety of tones by which
they can make each other &s;en&s;ible when
they are plea&s;ed, angry, or in pain, but
they cannot di&s;cour&s;e. To di&s;cour&s;e is
to communicate ideas, that is thoughts,
to compare&mdash;to rea&s;on upon them. This
is the privilege of man. It is by this
faculty that he is above the brutes,
and it is to per&s;uade you to u&s;e this
faculty that the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es are chiefly
written. Many &s;eem to think that
poor people, or tho&s;e who work to
maintain them&s;elves, have not this fa|culty,
and that you ought to be led
and governed like the brutes, without
knowing why or how. But this is
<PB N="5" REF="4">
wor&s;e than &s;inking you from your &s;ta|tion,
it is degrading you from your
&s;pecies. <HI>Judgment</HI> depends upon good
&s;en&s;e and information. Good &s;en&s;e is
born with us, and is found in every
rank of life, in one as much as ano|ther.
There are many in the highe&s;t
cla&s;&s;es who are deficient in it, and who
for that rea&s;on are led, and often im|po&s;ed
upon by others; and many in the
lowe&s;t employments, who from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
a remarkable &s;hare of it, are con&s;ulted
and looked up to by tho&s;e about them.
This you cannot but have ob&s;erved.
With regard to information, the ca&s;e
is different; that is not given by na|ture;
and if a man is de&s;titute of it,
certainly he cannot judge of tho&s;e things
in which he wants it. But there is
none of you &s;o low as that he may not
acquire a competent degree of infor|mation,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
even in matters of general im|portance,
if he earne&s;tly de&s;ire and &s;eek
for it. You can all of you get in|formation
enough concerning your re|&s;pective
trades and handicrafts, and yet
many of them are very difficult and
full of my&s;tery to tho&s;e who have never
taken the pains to enquire into their
principles. The clay that is wrought
into &s;hape under the hands of the pot|ter,
&s;eems to the &s;tander-by to be
&s;welled, and rounded, and touched into
form, as it were by enchantment. The
dextrous throwing of the &s;huttle, and
the web of cloth that grows beneath
the fingers of the weaver, is gazed at
with admiration by the fine gentleman
or fine lady, who &s;aunter through your
bu&s;y manufactories, and they &s;ee colours
mingle, and flowers and figures &s;tart
into the work, without being able to
<PB N="7" REF="6">
comprehend how they are produced there.
Yet it is not becau&s;e their capacity is
not equal to &s;uch knowledge, for <HI>you</HI>
comprehend the&s;e things, becau&s;e you
think it your duty and intere&s;t &s;o to
do, and you have taken pains to learn
them. The principles of Government,
which is one of the noble&s;t &s;ubjects
for the under&s;tanding of man to em|ploy
it&s;elf about, and which I now
wi&s;h to recommend to your attention,
are not more difficult than the princi|ples
of the arts by which you get your
bread; you may certainly under&s;tand them
if you think it worth your while to take
the pains.</P>
<P>But many people will tell you, you
have nothing to do with Government;
that you are like &s;heep, who ought to
follow the &s;hepherd; like the feet and
hands, which ought to obey the head,
<PB N="8" REF="7">
without having your&s;elves any choice
or will in the bu&s;ine&s;s. You may de|&s;ire
the&s;e people to look at a &s;heep,
and then at a &s;hepherd; to examine
the feet and hands, and then the head,
and they will find that the one is by
Nature formed quite differently from
the other. You cannot take a &s;heep
from the flock, and by giving him a
crook, and putting on him a certain
garment, turn him into a &s;hepherd.
You perceive at once, on looking at the
feet and hands, that they are de&s;igned
for different purpo&s;es from the head.
In all the&s;e in&s;tances, the intention of
nature is written in &s;uch plain and for|cible
characters, that no one can mi&s;|take
it. If, therefore, you &s;ee any
men born among&s;t you as different from
your&s;elves as you are from &s;heep, and as
much &s;uperior, you may &s;afely take it
<PB N="9" REF="8">
for granted that it is the will of Heaven
that you &s;hould obey them; but as no
one will pretend that there are any &s;uch
men, the &s;on of a king being born into
the world the &s;ame naked, helple&s;s, ig|norant
creature that your own children
are; it will be proper to enquire <HI>why</HI>
&s;ome men are &s;et over and govern
other men. And as to what the&s;e peo|ple
&s;ay with regard to your having no|thing
to do with Government, I will
tell you what Government is, and then
you will judge whether you have any
thing to do with it or no.</P>
<P>Government is the art of managing
the affairs of a community. Our com|munity
con&s;i&s;ts of nearly twelve mil|lions,
of whom I &s;uppo&s;e about nine
millions maintain them&s;elves by &s;ome
kind of manual labour. If, therefore,
you of the lower cla&s;&s;es have nothing
<PB N="10" REF="9">
to do with Government, three millions
are allowed to manage as they plea&s;e
the affairs of nine millions. Govern|ment
is not the art of managing the
affairs of the moon, but your own af|fairs.
It is not true therefore that
you have nothing to do with it. A&s;k
tho&s;e who tell you that Government is
nothing to you, whether it is nothing
to you how much of your wages and
hard earnings are taken from you in
taxes&mdash;how much of your corn you
may put into your own barns, and how
much you mu&s;t put into the barns of
other people&mdash;for what things you may
be put in pri&s;on, and for what things
your life may be taken away&mdash;by what
means you may obtain redre&s;s if you
have &s;uffered wrong from any one&mdash;to
which of your children your little pro|perty
will go after you are dead, or
<PB N="11" REF="10">
whether to any of them?&mdash;on what oc|ca&s;ions
you may be obliged to go into
other countries to fight and kill people
whom you never quarrelled with, or
perhaps to be killed your&s;elves. I think
you will hardly &s;ay, that the&s;e things are
nothing to you; yet all the&s;e things
belong to Government, and are deter|mined
by it. You may fairly &s;u&s;pect
of tho&s;e who give you &s;uch advice, that
Government is a great deal to them,
and that they find it very convenient
to manage your affairs; but look around
you, and you will ea&s;ily &s;ee that no one's
affairs in any bu&s;ine&s;s whatever are well
managed, except he him&s;elf has &s;ome
knowledge and care about them.</P>
<P>Some are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that if you
under&s;tand Government, you will not
obey it. I &s;hould rather think the con|trary;
<PB N="12" REF="11">
and that finding, upon examina|tion,
Government to be a noble art, an
excellent contrivance, an invention to
&s;ecure peace and order and plenty in a
kingdom; to re&s;train bad men and pro|tect
good; not a plot and con&s;piracy
again&s;t you, but a plot for your welfare and
happine&s;s formed by wi&s;e and hone&s;t men,
who have watched while you &s;lept, and
been careful for you before you could be
careful for your&s;elves&mdash;finding this, I
&s;ay of Government, and good Govern|ment
is this, you will love and revere
it almo&s;t beyond any thing el&s;e, and
be ready to lay down your lives to
pre&s;erve it to your families. In bad
Governments, &s;uch as Turkey, Govern|ment
is a plot <HI>again&s;t</HI> the people, and
therefore in all probability they will not
obey it when once they come to find
out the plot; but no one, I hope, will
<PB N="13" REF="12">
pre&s;ume to &s;ay it is &s;o in this kingdom.
That which is good is more loved the
more it is known and &s;tudied. The
bees have rea&s;on to be thankful to the
man who invented gla&s;s hives, becau&s;e
now that we can &s;ee the ingenuity of
their contrivances, and their indu&s;try and
their oeconomy more fully than before,
our admiration of their &s;kill is &s;o much
the greater. Whoever, therefore, &s;ays you
will not obey, if you under&s;tand, &s;landers
the Government; he calls it unju&s;t, weak,
and calculated to make you wretched;
why el&s;e will it not bear to be looked
into? Be&s;ides, you are at this time par|ticularly
called upon by the Proclamation
of your King, which tells you that there
are <HI>divers wicked and &s;editious writings
indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed,</HI> and <HI>corre&s;pondencies
entered into to forward criminal</HI> and
<HI>wicked purpo&s;es,</HI> which writings and
<PB N="14" REF="13">
purpo&s;es you are <HI>&s;olemnly warned to
guard again&s;t.</HI> It is therefore highly in|cumbent
upon you to know what Se|dition
is; and to know whether the
purpo&s;es for which any corre&s;pondencies
are entered into are <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>criminal,</HI>
otherwi&s;e, through your ignorance, you
may be guilty of calling by the&s;e bad
names, practices and writings which
are very harmle&s;s and lawful. Some
men, it is plain, have got wrong no|tions
of Government; it is the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for you to get right ones. And
that you may have &s;ome rule to go by,
in judging of the&s;e writings and prac|tices,
the Proclamation further tells
you, that they tend to <HI>vilify</HI> and <HI>bring
into contempt provi&s;ions made for the
&s;ecurity of your rights</HI> and <HI>liberties;</HI> the
&s;ecurity of which rights and liberties,
<HI>both civil and religious,</HI> together with
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<HI>the public peace and pro&s;perity,</HI> your
Governors a&s;&s;ure you that they <HI>de&s;ire
more earne&s;tly than any thing el&s;e.</HI> It
becomes therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary that
you &s;hould enquire what the&s;e rights
and liberties are, and what things tend
to promote the peace and pro&s;perity of
a kingdom. The&s;e are high matters,
but you &s;ee you are called upon to
examine, you are expected to under&s;tand
them. You will not be allowed to plead;
I do not know what Sedition is, I do
not know what our rights are. You
are further enjoined to <HI>di&s;courage all pro|ceedings
tending to promote riots and tu|mults.</HI>
That there have been &s;uch
things you know very well; I &s;uppo&s;e
few of you can be ignorant, that a
little while ago, wicked and &s;editious
men, mi&s;led I &s;uppo&s;e by &s;ome of the&s;e
wrong notions which you are warned
<PB N="16" REF="15">
again&s;t, a&s;&s;embled at Birmingham, and
pulled down the hou&s;es, de&s;troyed the
goods, and endangered the lives of quiet
and worthy citizens, to the very great
&s;hame and di&s;grace of this kingdom;
the more &s;o, as they have not yet re|ceived
any adequate indemnification for
their property &s;o de&s;troyed. Now the
men who did this mi&s;chief wanted to
be informed what the rights of their
neighbours were, and what &s;ort of be|haviour
Government required of them;
for want of this knowledge, they called
them&s;elves, all the while, the Friends of
Government, and mi&s;took the matter
&s;o far as to think, that pulling down
of hou&s;es was promoting the peace and
pro&s;perity of the kingdom. You are
further de&s;ired to place <HI>a ju&s;t confidence
in the wi&s;dom and integrity of Parlia|ment.</HI>
You will do well to ob&s;erve the
propriety of this expre&s;&s;ion. The figure
<PB N="17" REF="16">
of Ju&s;tice, you know, is repre&s;ented with
a balance to weigh out to every one his
due, with nice and &s;crupulous exactne&s;s,
&s;o much and no more. You are not de|&s;ired
to place a blind confidence, but a ju&s;t
confidence, that is, a confidence in their
wi&s;dom and integrity, ju&s;t &s;o much as will
ari&s;e from what upon examination they
&s;hall be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s of tho&s;e qualities.</P>
<P>You are invited, therefore, by tho&s;e
who wi&s;h the welfare of their country,
and your welfare, to gain ju&s;t ideas of
wha$ concerns it; for, by having fal&s;e
ideas, you may do much harm: but do
not mi&s;take me, you are not <HI>all</HI> invited.
You who are di&s;&s;olute, idle, intemperate,
&s;avage in your manners, profligate in
your principles, without care for your|&s;elves,
or for tho&s;e who depend upon your
labour; who prey upon the hone&s;t in|du&s;try
of others; who are ignorant, not
<PB N="18" REF="17">
merely from want of information, but
from a deba&s;ed and be&s;otted under&s;tanding&mdash;to
you I do not &s;peak, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be
governed like brutes; for you <HI>are</HI> brutes.
You who own no law, cannot judge of
laws. You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;laves, not thro' the
appointment of men, but by the eternal
law of nature. A King, with &s;uch di&s;|po&s;itions,
cannot govern; he may prowl
about for a time, and tear in pieces and
de&s;troy; but he cannot govern. You too
may break loo&s;e, and do mi&s;chief to others,
but you cannot do good to your&s;elves;
you never did, nor ever can. You ru&s;h
over, and devour, and trample down;
but when your wild fury has &s;pent it&s;elf,
you are &s;ure to &s;link back, hungry and
tired and &s;ore with wounds, to crouch
as before, and lick the hand that is held
over you. To you Government is known
by its re&s;traints, and Religion by its terrors.
All that Government <HI>can</HI> do for you is to
<PB N="19" REF="18">
&s;often and alleviate the mi&s;eries you bring
upon your&s;elves, by your thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s
and your vices. While to others it &s;ecures
<HI>from</HI> you the property they have taken
pains to acquire, for you, with &s;terner
kindne&s;s, it builds ho&s;pitals, workhou&s;es,
and pri&s;ons; but it does not call you to
the a&s;&s;emblies of Citizens, nor &s;ubmit
its awful regulations to your untutored
fancies. But you, in whatever rank of
life you are, who are &s;ober, indu&s;trious,
and thoughtful; you who re&s;pect the
property and rights of your neighbour,
and therefore demand and de&s;erve that
your own rights and property &s;hould be re|&s;pected;
you who have a home, and there|fore
have a country; you who have a love
of order, a &s;en&s;e of ingenuous &s;hame, a re|li&s;h
for the conveniencies and decencies
which civilized life affords; you who
have a provident care for your families;
who are accu&s;tomed to &s;ay to your&s;elves,
<PB N="20" REF="19">
I will not buy &s;trong drink to-day, be|cau&s;e
my children will have no bread to|morrow&mdash;you
are worthy to con&s;ider the
affairs of a community, which, tho' more
complicated, are not materially different.
Come then, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day
is over, and leaning over your counters,
or by your clean fire-&s;ides; or &s;itting
under your &s;preading trees, or in the porch
covered with honey-&s;uckle before your
door, &s;teal a little lei&s;ure to turn over the&s;e
things in your minds, in which, if I can
a&s;&s;i&s;t you, it will give me great &s;atisfaction.
You need not chide away your children,
that pre&s;s about you to climb upon your
knees; they will give a &s;pirit and edge to
your meditations. It is for THEM: it is
for YOURSELVES.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent farewell, and God
ble&s;s you!</P>
