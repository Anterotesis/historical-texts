<P>I Think it nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the Public, that I &s;hould never have thought of writing a Play on the following Subject, if I had not fir&s;t read the ju&s;t|ly celebrated <HI>Horace</HI> of Mr. <HI>Corneille,</HI> and admired his Management of &s;ome Parts of the Story. They will find me tracing him very clo&s;ely (with &s;ome few Alte|rations) in the latter End of the Third Act, and in the Beginning of the Fourth. In the other Acts I am hardly con&s;cious to my&s;elf of having borrowed even a Thought from him; tho' I might have been proud to have tran&s;lated whole Scenes, if my Plan and Cha|racters would have admitted of it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to add, that I was induced, for the Sake of the Action, to put &s;everal Speeches at the latter End of the Play into the Mouth of <HI>Publius,</HI> which more properly belong to the Father. The Reader will accordingly find them re&s;tored here to their fir&s;t Situation.</P>
