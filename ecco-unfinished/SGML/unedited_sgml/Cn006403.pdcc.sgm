<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>MY LORD,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Very much fear I &s;hall be thought guilty of great Pre&s;umption in taking the Liberty to dedicate, to Your Excellency, a Play repre&s;en|ted at this Sea&s;on of the Year; and, at the &s;ame time, in doing it without fir&s;t ob|taining Leave: But as Your Excellency has too ju&s;t a Ta&s;te and Knowledge of every Science to pa&s;s Judgment on any Writer, otherwi&s;e than as You are influenc'd
<PB REF="3">
by the real Merit of his Performance, the fir&s;t Objection will be of little avail again&s;t me; for I &s;hould have the &s;ame Dread, at any other time, of not gaining Your Ex|cellency's Approbation, &s;ince I am &s;en&s;i|ble, I have but &s;mall Pretentions to it from the Alterations and Additions I have made in the Piece I do my &s;elf the Honour to lay at Your Excellency's Feet.</P>
<P>The other Objection, of not begging Your Excellency's Permi&s;&s;ion for this Ad|dre&s;s, is of no greater Force than the for|mer; for tho' very few Gentlemen of high Birth and Station &s;o much de&s;erve the Encomiums of Mankind as Your Ex|cellency, yet, I am told, there are &s;till fewer but &s;eem more delighted with them. Then how could I apply to Your Excel|lency in an Affair of this kind, which is, in my Opinion, no better than a Bargain between the Patron and Poet for &s;uch a Number of Flatteries and over&s;train'd Compliments, as Your Excellency would &s;corn to accept had I Meanne&s;s enough to make an Offering of them?</P>
<P><PB REF="4">But to take this Occa&s;ion of congratu|lating my native Country, <HI>Ireland</HI>, on the Happine&s;s it is going to receive from Your wi&s;e and prudent Admini&s;tration, and of being one of the foremo&s;t in &s;hewing my Zeal and Duty to Your Excellency, I hope will not be thought an unpardonable Am|bition in,</P>
