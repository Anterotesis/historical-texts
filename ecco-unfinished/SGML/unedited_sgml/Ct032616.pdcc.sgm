<HEAD>LETTERS CONCERNING The following Drama.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I Was aware, when I &s;ent you my Poem, that it would be liable to the very objections you make to it. Yet perhaps, they will be obviated to your &s;atis|faction, when I have laid before you (as indeed I ought to have done at fir&s;t) the original idea which led me to the choice of &s;uch a &s;ubject, and to execute it in &s;o peculiar a manner.</P>
<P>Had I intended to give an exact copy of the ancient Drama, your objections to the pre&s;ent Poem would be unan&s;werable. But my de&s;ign was much le&s;s confin'd. I meant only to pur&s;ue the ancient method &s;o far as it is probable a Greek Poet, were he alive, would now do, in order to adapt him&s;elf to the genius of our times, and the character of our Tragedy. According to this
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
notion, every thing was to be allowed to the pre&s;ent ta&s;te, which nature and Ari&s;totle could po&s;&s;ibly di&s;pen&s;e with; and nothing of intrigue or refinement was to be admitted, at which antient Judgment could rea&s;onably take offence. Good &s;en&s;e, as well as antiquity, pre|&s;cribed an adherence to the three great Unities; the&s;e therefore were &s;trictly ob&s;erved. But on the other hand, to follow the modern ma&s;ters in tho&s;e re&s;pects wherein they had not &s;o faultily deviated from their pre|dece&s;&s;ors, a &s;tory was cho&s;en, in which the tender, ra|ther than the noble pa&s;&s;ions were predominant, and in which even love had the principal &s;hare. Characters too were drawn as nearly approaching to private ones, as Tragic dignity would permit; and affections rais'd rather from the impul&s;e of common humanity, than the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of royalty and the fate of kingdoms. Be&s;ide this, for the &s;ake of natural embelli&s;hment, and to re|concile mere modern readers to that &s;implicity of fa|ble, in which I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to copy the anti|ents, I contriv'd to lay the &s;cene in an old romantic fore&s;t. For, by this means, I was enabled to enliven the poem by various touches of pa&s;toral de&s;cription; not affectedly brought in from the &s;tore-hou&s;e of a pic|ture&s;que imagination, but nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from the &s;cenery of the place it&s;elf: A beauty, &s;o extremely &s;triking in the COMUS of Milton, and the AS YOU LIKE IT of Shake&s;peare; and of which the Greek Mu&s;e (tho' fond of rural imagery) has afforded few examples, be|&s;ides that admirable one in the PHILOCTETES of So|phocles.</P>
<P>By this idea I could wi&s;h you to regulate your cri|tici&s;m. I need not, I think, ob&s;erve to you that the&s;e
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
deviations from the practice of the antients may be rea&s;onably defended. For we were long &s;ince agreed, that, where Love does not degenerate into epi&s;odical gal|lantry, but makes the foundation of the di&s;tre&s;s, it is, from the univer&s;ality of its influence, a pa&s;&s;ion very pro|per for Tragedy. And I have &s;een you too much mov'd at the repre&s;entation of &s;ome of our be&s;t Trage|dies of private &s;tory, to believe you will condemn me for making the other deviation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I Am glad, you approve the method, I have taken, of &s;oftening the rigor of the old Drama. If I have, indeed, &s;oftened it &s;ufficiently for the mo|dern ta&s;te, without parting with any of the e&s;&s;entials of the Greek method, I have obtain'd my purpo&s;e: which was to obviate &s;ome of the popular objections made to the antient form of Tragedy. For the current opinion, you know, is, that by the &s;trict adherence to the Unities, it re&s;trains the genius of the poet; by the &s;implicity of its conduct, it dimini&s;hes the pathos of the fable; and, by the admi&s;&s;ion of a continued chorus, prevents that agreeable embarras, which awakens our attention, and intere&s;ts our pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al veneration, which we pay to the name of Shake&s;pear, at the &s;ame time that it has improv'd our reli&s;h for the higher beauties of Poetry, has un|doubtedly been the ground-work of all this fal&s;e criti|ci&s;m. That di&s;regard, which, in compliance merely with the ta&s;te of the times, he &s;hew'd of all the nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
rules of the Drama, hath &s;ince been con&s;ider'd as a characteri&s;tic of his va&s;t and original genius; and con|&s;equently &s;et up as a model for &s;ucceeding writers. <Q>Hence M. Voltaire remarks very ju&s;tly, &startq;que le me|rite de cet auteur a perdu le Theatre Anglois. Le tems, que, &s;eul fait la reputation des hommes, rend &endq;&agrave; la fin leurs defauts re&s;pectables."</Q></P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;urdity of this low &s;u|per&s;tition, the notion is &s;o popular among&s;t Engli&s;h|men, that I fear it will never be entirely di&s;credited, till a Poet ri&s;es up among&s;t us with a genius as eleva|ted and daring as Shake&s;peare's, and a judgment as &s;ober and cha&s;tis'd as Racine's. But as it &s;eems too long to wait for this prodigy, it will not &s;urely be improper for any one of common talents, who would entertain the public without indulging its caprice, to take the be&s;t models of antiquity for his guides; and to adapt tho&s;e models, as near as may be, to the manners and ta&s;te of his own times. Unle&s;s he do both, he will, in effect, do nothing. For it cannot be doubted, that the many gro&s;s faults of our &s;tage, are owing to the complai&s;ance and &s;ervility, with which the ordinary run of writers have ever humour'd that illiterate, whim&s;i|cal, or corrupted age, in which it was their misfortune to be born.</P>
<P>Milton, you will tell me, is a noble exception to this ob&s;ervation. He is &s;o, and would have been a nobler, had he not run into the contrary extreme. The con|tempt, in which, perhaps with ju&s;tice, he held the age he liv'd in, prevented him from conde&s;cending either to amu&s;e or to in&s;truct it. He had, before, given to his unworthy Countrymen the noble&s;t Poem,
<PB N="v" REF="6">
that genius, conducted by ancient art, could produce; and he had &s;een them receive it with di&s;regard, if not with di&s;like. Con&s;cious therefore of his own dignity, and of their demerit, he look'd to po&s;terity only for his reward, and to po&s;terity only directed his future la|bours. Hence it was perhaps, that he form'd his SAMPSON AGONISTES on a model more &s;imple and &s;evere than Athens her&s;elf would have demanded; and took Ae&s;chylus for his ma&s;ter, rather than Sophocles or Euripides: intending by this conduct to put as great a di&s;tance as po&s;&s;ible between him&s;elf and his contempo|rary writers; and to make his work (as he him&s;elf &s;aid) <HI>much different from what among&s;t them pa&s;&s;ed for the be&s;t</HI>.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the Poem was, accordingly, what one would have expected. The age, it appeared in, treated it with total neglect; neither hath that po&s;te|rity, to which he appealed, and which has done ju&s;tice to mo&s;t of his other writings, as yet given to this ex|cellent piece its full mea&s;ure of popular and univer&s;al fame. Perhaps in your clo&s;et, and that of a few more, who unaffectedly admire genuine nature and antient &s;implicity, the Agoni&s;tes may hold a di&s;tingui&s;hed rank. <Q>Yet, I think, we cannot &s;ay (in Hamlet's phra&s;e) &startq;<HI>that it plea&s;es the Million; it is &s;till Caviar to the &endq;ge|neral."</HI></Q></P>
<P>Hence, I think, I may conclude, that unle&s;s one would be content with a very late and very learned po&s;terity, Milton's conduct in this point &s;hould not be followed. A Writer of Tragedy mu&s;t cer|tainly adapt him&s;elf more to the general ta&s;te; be|cau&s;e the Dramatic, of all kinds of Poetry, ought to
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
be mo&s;t univer&s;ally reli&s;h'd and under&s;tood. The Ly|ric Mu&s;e addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf to the imagination of a rea|der; the Didactic to his judgment; but the Tragic &s;trikes directly on his pa&s;&s;ions. Few men have a &s;trength of imagination capable of pur&s;uing the flights of Pindar: Many have not a clearne&s;s of apprehen|&s;ion &s;uited to the rea&s;onings of Lucretius and Pope: But ev'ry man has pa&s;&s;ions to be excited; and ev'ry man feels them excited by Shake&s;pear.</P>
<P>But, tho' Tragedy be thus chiefly directed to the heart, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that it will &s;eldom attain its end without the concurrent approbation of the judg|ment. And to procure this, the artificial con&s;truction of the fable goes a great way. In France, the excellence of their &s;everal poets is chiefly mea&s;ur'd by this &s;tandard. And among&s;t our own writers, if you except Shake&s;peare (who indeed ought, for his other virtues, to be exempt from common rules) you will find, that the mo&s;t re|gular of their compo&s;itions is generally reckon'd their <HI>Chef d'oeuvre</HI>, witne&s;s the <HI>All for Love</HI> of Dryden, the <HI>Venice pre&s;erv'd</HI> of Otway, and the <HI>Jane Shore</HI> of Rowe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;cheme, you propos'd in your la&s;t, is I own practicable enough. Undoubtedly, mo&s;t part of the Dialogue of the Chorus might be put into the mouth of an Emma or Matilda, who, with &s;ome little &s;hew of &s;i&s;terly concernment, might
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
be ea&s;ily made to claim kindred with Earl Athelwold. Nay, by the addition of an unnece&s;&s;ary incident or two, which would co&s;t me no more than they are worth in contriving, and an unmeaning per&s;onage or two, who would be as little expence in creating, I believe I could quickly make the whole tolerably fit for an Engli&s;h Au|dience.</P>
<P>But for all this I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf to enter up|on the ta&s;k. I have, I know not how (like many of my betters,) contracted a kind of veneration for the old Chorus; and am willing to think it e&s;&s;ential to the Tragic Drama. You &s;hall hear the rea&s;ons that in|cline me to this judgment. They re&s;pect the <HI>Poet</HI> and the <HI>Audience</HI>.</P>
<P>It is agreed, I think, on all hands, that, in the conduct of a fable, the admi&s;&s;ion of a Chorus lays a nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint on the <HI>Poet</HI>. The two unities of Time and Place, are e&s;teem'd by &s;ome of le&s;s con&s;equence in our modern Tragedy, than the third Unity of Action; but admit a Chorus, and you mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, re&s;tore them to tho&s;e equal rights, which they anciently, en|joyed, and yet claim, by the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of Ari&s;to|tle. For the difference, which the u&s;e of the Chorus makes, is this. The modern Drama contents it&s;elf with a fact <HI>repre&s;ented</HI>; the antient requires it to be <HI>re|pre&s;ented before Spectators</HI>. Now as it cannot be &s;up|pos'd, that the&s;e Spectators &s;hould accompany the chief Per&s;onages into private apartments, one &s;ingle Scene or <HI>unity of Place</HI> becomes &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary. And as the&s;e Spectators are a&s;&s;embled on purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve and bear a part in the action, the <HI>time</HI> of that action be|comes, of cour&s;e, that of the &s;pectacle or repre&s;entation
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
it&s;elf; it being unrea&s;onable to make the Spectators at|tend as long, as the Poet, in bringing about his Cata&s;|trophe, may require. And this is u&s;ually the practice of the ancient Stage. The modern, on the contrary, regards very little the&s;e two capital re&s;traints; and its di&s;u&s;e of the Chorus helps greatly to conceal the ab&s;ur|dity. For the Poet, without offending &s;o much again&s;t the laws of probability, may lead his per&s;onages from one part to another of the &s;ame palace or city, when they have only a paltry Servant or in&s;ignificant Confi|dant to attend them. He may think him&s;elf at liberty to &s;pend two or three days, months or even years in compleating his &s;tory; to clear the Stage at the end or, if he plea&s;es, in the middle of every act: and, being un|der no controul of the Chorus, he can break the conti|nuity of the Drama, ju&s;t where he thinks it convenient; and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a bri&s;k fugue and a good violin, can per&s;uade his audience, that as much time has elaps'd as his Hero's, or rather his own di&s;tre&s;s may de|mand.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that &s;ecret intrigues become (as Mr. Dryden gravely calls them) the <HI>beauties of our modern Stage</HI>. Hence it is, that Incidents, and Bu&s;tle, and <HI>Bu&s;i|ne&s;s</HI>, &s;upply the place of Simplicity, Nature, and Pathos: A happy change, perhaps, for the generality of writers, who might otherwi&s;e find it impo&s;&s;ible to fill <HI>cette lon|gue carriere de cinq actes</HI>, which a Writer, &s;ufficiently experienced in the&s;e matters, &s;ays, <HI>e&s;t &s;i prodigieu&s;ement difficile &agrave; remplir &s;ans Epi&s;odes</HI>.</P>
<P>But, whatever the&s;e Play-makers may have gain'd by rejecting the Chorus, the true Poet has lo&s;t con|&s;iderably by it. For he has lo&s;t a graceful and natu|ral
<PB N="ix" REF="10">
re&s;ource to the embelli&s;hments of Picture&s;que De|&s;cription, &s;ublime allegory, and whatever el&s;e comes under the denomination of <HI>pure Poetry</HI>. Shake&s;pear, indeed, had the power of introducing this naturally, and, what is mo&s;t &s;trange, of joining it with <HI>pure Pa&s;|&s;ion</HI>. But I make no doubt, if we had a Tragedy of his form'd on the Greek model, we &s;hould find in it more frequent, if not nobler, in&s;tances of the high Po|etical capacity, than in any &s;ingle compo&s;ition he has left us. I think you have a proof of this in tho&s;e parts of his hi&s;torical plays, which are call'd Chorus's, and written in the common Dialogue metre. And your imagination will ea&s;ily conceive, how fine an ode the de&s;cription of the night, preceding the battle of Agin|court, would have made in his hands; and what ad|ditional grace it would receive from that form of com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>With the means of introducing Poetry naturally is lo&s;t, al&s;o, the opportunity of conveying moral reflections with grace and propriety. But this comes more properly under con&s;ideration, when I give you my thoughts on the advantage the Audience receiv'd from a well-con|ducted Chorus.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t I took no notice of that &s;uperior pomp and maje&s;ty, which the Chorus nece&s;&s;arily added to the &s;cene of the Drama. I made no remarks on the agreable variety it introduc'd into the ve&s;ification and metre; nor &s;hew'd how, by uniting the harmony of the Lyre to the pomp of the Bu&s;kin, mu&s;ick became
<PB N="x" REF="11">
intimately connected with it, and furni&s;hed it with all it's additional graces. The&s;e and many other advanta|ges I might have in&s;i&s;ted upon, had I thought them &s;o material as the two I mentioned; the latter of which, namely its being a proper vehicle for moral and &s;enti|ment, is &s;o material, that I think nothing can po&s;&s;ibly atone for the lo&s;s of it.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e parts of the Drama, where the judgment of a mixt audience is mo&s;t liable to be mi&s;led by what pa&s;&s;es before it's view, the chief actors are generally too much agitated by the furious pa&s;&s;ions, or too much at|tach'd by the tender ones, to think cooly, and im|pre&s;s on the &s;pectators a moral &s;entiment properly. A Confidant or Servant has &s;eldom &s;en&s;e enough to do it, never dignity enough to make it regarded. In&s;tead therefore of the&s;e, the antients were provided with a band of di&s;tingui&s;h'd per&s;ons, not merely capable of &s;eeing and hearing, but of arguing, advi&s;ing, and re|flecting; from the leader of which a moral &s;entiment never came unnaturally, but &s;uitably and gracefully; and from the troop it&s;elf, a poetical flow of tender com|mi&s;eration, of religious &s;upplication, or of virtuous tri|umph, was ever ready to heighten the pathos, to in|&s;pire a reverential awe of the Deity, and to advance the cau&s;e of <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> and of truth.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k me, how it augmented the pathe|tic, I cannot give you a better an&s;wer than the <HI>Abb&agrave; Vatry</HI> has done in his di&s;&s;ertation on the &s;ubject publi&s;hed in the <HI>memoirs de l' Acad. des In&s;cr. &amp;c.</HI> <Q>&startq;It affected this (&s;ays he) both in its <HI>odes</HI>, and <HI>dialogue</HI>. The wonderful power of Mu&s;ic and the Dance is univer&s;ally allowed. And, as the&s;e were
<PB N="xi" REF="12">
always <HI>accompaniments</HI> to the Odes, there is no doubt but they contributed greatly to move the pa&s;&s;ions. It was nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be odes or interludes, but it was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that the&s;e interludes &s;hould not &s;uffer the minds of the Audience to cool, but, on the contrary, &s;hould &s;upport and fortify tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, which the previous &s;cenes had already excited. Nothing imaginable could produce this effect better, than the choral &s;ongs and dances, which fill'd the mind with ideas corre&s;ponding to the &s;ubject, and never fail'd to add new force to the &s;entiments of the principal per&s;onages. In the Dialogue al&s;o, the Chorus &s;erv'd to move the pa&s;&s;ions by &s;hewing to the &s;pectators other &s;pectators &s;trongly affected by the action. A &s;pectacle of &s;uch a kind as is fitted to ex|cite in us the pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Terror</HI>, and <HI>Pity</HI>, will not of it&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly affect us, as when we &s;ee others, al&s;o, affected by it. The Painters have ge|nerally under&s;tood this &s;ecret, and have had recour&s;e to an expedient, &s;imilar to that of the Chorus of the Poets. Not content with the &s;imple repre&s;entation of an hi&s;torical event, they have al&s;o added groups of a&s;&s;i&s;tant figures, and expre&s;t in their faces the diffe|rent pa&s;&s;ions, they would have their picture excite. Nay they &s;ometimes inli&s;t into their &s;ervice even irra|tional animals. In the <HI>&s;laughter of the Innocents</HI>, Le Brun was not &s;atified with expre&s;&s;ing all the horror, of which the &s;ubject is naturally capable, he has al&s;o painted two Hor&s;es with their hair &s;tanding on end, and &s;tarting back, as afraid to trample upon the bleeding infants. This is an artifice which has often been employ'd, and which has always, &s;ucceeded. A good poet &s;hould do the &s;ame; and Iphigenia &s;hould
<PB N="xii" REF="13">
not be &s;uffer'd to appear on the Theatre, without being accompanied with per&s;ons capable of feeling &endq;her misfortunes."</Q></P>
<P>Had this ingenious Abb&egrave; &s;een the famous Belli&s;arius of Vandyke, I am apt to believe he would have thought it a much more noble illu&s;tration of the matter. The Soldier in that piece, tho' &s;o much condemn'd by our modern Profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Vert&ugrave;</HI> for being, as they &s;ay, the principal Figure, is the very thing, which rai&s;es this picture from a &s;imple Portrait (which it mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been) to the fine&s;t moral painting; and in Greece would have plac'd the Painter among&s;t that cla&s;s of Ar|ti&s;ts, which they e&s;teem'd the noble&s;t, the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. The greate&s;t Tragic Poet could not have rais'd a more exqui&s;ite di&s;tre&s;s, than this judicious Painter has done by the attitude of that Soldier; as well as by the &s;ubordinate figures, which, with great propriety, are female ones: nothing being &s;o likely to rai&s;e that pitiable di&s;dain in a military mind, which he wanted to expre&s;s, as to &s;ee &s;uch a Hero reliev'd by charity, and that too the charity of girls and old women.</P>
<P>But, returning to my &s;ubject, I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that if it be proper to a&s;&s;i&s;t an audience in reli&s;h|ing the pathetic, by &s;hewing an imitation of that pa|thos in the Chorus, it is much more &s;o to in&s;truct them how to be affected properly, with the characters and actions which are repre&s;ented in the cour&s;e of the Drama. The character of PIERRE in <HI>Venice pre&s;erv'd</HI>, when left entirely to the judgment of the audience, is perhaps one of the mo&s;t improper for public view, that ever was produced on any &s;tage. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, but &s;ome part of the &s;pectators &s;hould go from the repre&s;entation with
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">
very fal&s;e and immoral expre&s;&s;ions. But had that Tra|gedy been written on the antient plan; had Pierre's character been drawn ju&s;t as it is, and &s;ome few altera|tions made in Jaffeir's, I know no two Characters more capable of doing &s;ervice in a moral view, when ju&s;tly animadverted upon by the Chorus. I don't &s;ay, I would have tru&s;ted Otway with the writing of it.</P>
<P>To have done and to relea&s;e you. Bad characters become on this plan as harmle&s;s in the hands of the Poet, as the Hi&s;torian; and good ones become infinitely more u&s;eful, by how much the Poetic is more forci|ble, than the Hi&s;torical mode of in&s;truction.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THE rea&s;on, why in a former Letter you advis'd me to alter the Chorus, is made very apparent in your la&s;t. For, by per&s;uading me to get the Odes &s;et to mu&s;ic, and to ri&s;k the play on the &s;tage, I under&s;tand only that you are willing, any how, to make it a more profitable work for me, that it can po&s;|&s;ibly be by means of the pre&s;s alone.</P>
<P>Yet certainly, Sir, one &s;ingle reflection on our Bri|ti&s;h pit will make you change your &s;entiments effectu|ally. Think only on the trial made by M. Racine, in a nation much before our's, in a ta&s;te for probability and decorum in Theatrical diver&s;ions. In his two la&s;t Tragedies, you know, he has fully &s;ucceeded in the very thing I aim'd at; and has adapted a noble imitation of ancient &s;implicity to the ta&s;te of his own times: particu|larly in his Athaliah, a poem in which the mo&s;t &s;uperb
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
and augu&s;t &s;pectacle, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting event, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime flow of in&s;pir'd Poetry, are all nobly and naturally united. Yet I am told, that neither that, nor the <HI>E&s;ther</HI>, retains it Chorus, when repre&s;ented on the French Theatre.</P>
<P>To what is this owing? To the refinement mo&s;t certainly of our modern mu&s;ic. This art is now carri|ed to a pitch of perfection, or, if you will, of corrup|tion, which makes it utterly incapable of being an ad|junct to Poetry. <HI>Il y a grand apparence, que les progres que vous avez faits dans la mu&s;ique, ont nui enfin &agrave; ceux de la veritable Tragedie. C'e&s;t un talent, qui a fait tort &agrave; un autre</HI>; &s;ays M. Voltaire with his u&s;ual ta&s;te and judg|ment. Our different cadences, our divi&s;ions, varia|tions, repetitions, without which modern mu&s;ic cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, are intirely improper for the expre&s;&s;ion of poe|try, and were &s;carce known to the ancients.</P>
<P>But could this be manag'd, the additional expence nece&s;&s;arily attendant on &s;uch a performance, would make the matter impracticable. This Mr. Dryden fore|&s;aw long ago. The pa&s;&s;age is curious.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;A new Theatre, much more ample and much deeper, mu&s;t be made for that purpo&s;e; be&s;ides the co&s;t of &s;ometimes forty or fifty habits: which is an expence too large to be &s;upply'd by a company of actors. 'Tis true I &s;hould not be &s;orry to &s;ee a <HI>Cho|rus</HI> on a Theatre, more than as large and as deep again as our's, built and adorn'd at a King's Charges; and on that condition, and another, which is, that my hands were not bound behind me, as now they are, I &s;hould not de&s;pair of making &s;uch <HI>a Tragedy</HI>, as might be both <HI>in&s;tructive</HI> and <HI>delightful</HI> according
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
&endq;to the <HI>manner</HI> of the Grecians."</Q> What he means by having <HI>his hands bound</HI>, I imagine, is, that he was either engag'd to his &s;ub&s;cribers for a Tran&s;lation of Virgil, or to the manager of the Theatre for &s;o many plays a &s;ea|&s;on. This &s;uffrage of Mr. Dryden is, however, very appo&s;ite to the pre&s;ent point. But it &s;erves, al&s;o, to vindicate my de&s;ign of imitating the Greek Drama. For if he, who was &s;o prejudiced to the modern &s;tage, as to think intrigue a capital beauty in it; if he, I &s;ay, owns that the grand &s;ecret <HI>prode&s;&s;e et delectare</HI> was the characteri&s;tic of the Greek Drama only, nothing I think can better ju&s;tify my pre&s;ent attempt than the approba|tion he gives to it in this pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Having now, I think, &s;ettled with you all matters of general critici&s;m, I hope in your next you will give me your objections to <HI>&s;cenes, &s;peeches, images</HI>, &amp;c. And be a&s;&s;ur'd I &s;hall treat your judgment in the&s;e matters with greater deference, than I have done in what related to the Stage and the Chorus.</P>
