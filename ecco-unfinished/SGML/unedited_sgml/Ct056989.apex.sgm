<HEAD>THE TRADE TO <HI>INDIA</HI> Critically and Calmly con&s;ider'd.</HEAD>
<P>_AFTER all the Arguments which have been u&s;ed, on one Side as well as on the other, in the <HI>Callicoe Con|trover&s;y</HI> now on Foot, have, as it were, been &s;umm'd up, and laid before the Hou&s;e of Commons, and when we thought there had been little more to do than to wait the Re&s;olutions
<PB N="4" REF="3">
of the Hou&s;e, and receive from thence a conclu&s;ive Sentence: I &s;ay, after all this is done and over, we are attack'd a-new with powerful Applications, I do not &s;ay powerful Rea&s;onings, drawn from the U&s;efulne&s;s and Advantages of the <HI>Ea&s;t India Trade.</HI></P>
<P>This is the more &s;urprizing, becau&s;e they &s;ay 'tis done in Behalf of the <HI>Ea&s;t India Company.</HI> Many People real|ly think there is &s;o little to be &s;aid on that Head to the Company's Advan|tage, that it was always thought they would have been wi&s;er, and had known their Intere&s;t better, than to bring that Di&s;pute upon the Stage, e&s;pecially on this Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Callicoes.</HI> It is &s;ur|prizing I &s;ay al&s;o, becau&s;e in all the Di&s;putes about the <HI>Callicoes,</HI> the Weav|ers and Manufacturers have let the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company alone, as to the Con&s;i|deration of their own Conduct, or the Trade in general: In &s;hort, they have never attack'd either the Company or the Trade, 'till the&s;e Men even forc'd the Di&s;cour&s;e of both into the Contro|ver&s;y, by in&s;i&s;ting upon the Merit of both, and that in a Manner, which no People, <HI>that had really &s;o little to &s;ay for it,</HI> would have ventur'd to do, unle&s;s they were under &s;ome Infatuation, or
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the ill Influence of &s;ome Star, which pointed again&s;t them, and makes their being expos'd inevitable.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o far the Manufacturers have been from de&s;igning to concern the Company, or their general Com|merce, in the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute, that in the fir&s;t Book which was publi&s;h'd in this Cau&s;e, entitl'd, <HI>A brief State of the Que&s;tion;</HI> and in the very Introduction to that Book, it was laid down among the general Maxims, as a Fundamental, that the Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> was le&s;s concern'd in the Di&s;pute than was generally imagin'd; that the Company might go on and flouri&s;h, though all that the Manufacturers a&s;k'd were to be granted. In a Word, the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, or their Trade, &s;eem'd un|concern'd in the Di&s;pute, unle&s;s we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the Jobbing of their Stock to be call'd the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, and the Brokers to be the Company, which I cannot admit; I repeat it therefore again from the Book call'd <HI>The brief State of the Que&s;tion,</HI> &amp;c. the Words are the&s;e:</P>
<P>That the total Prohibiting the Wearing and U&s;ing of Printed or Painted Callicoes in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is not ruinous to or in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Pro&s;perity of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>India</HI> Trade; or, <HI>to put it into an Affir|mative, that may be more capable of Evidence,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade may and would remain in a very thriving and flou|ri&s;hing Condition, and be carry'd on to the Profit and Advantage of the Adventurers, tho' all the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and of <HI>Ireland</HI> were effectually limited from and prohibited the Wearing and U&s;ing of Print|ed and Painted Callicoes.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable, and de&s;erves to be taken Notice of here, that in all that is &s;aid of or for the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, the Advocates for it rather apply them|&s;elves to an&s;wer and clear up the Ob|jections continually rais'd again&s;t it, than to advance any Thing new or &s;ub&s;tantial in its Favour: This proves that the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e is not the only Occa&s;ion there has been to complain of the injurious Effects of this Trade.</P>
<P>The great Que&s;tion is plainly laid down thus, Whether the Trade, as now carry'd on to <HI>India,</HI> or to the <HI>Ea&s;t In|dies,</HI> is profitable to the Nation, or whether it is not.</P>
<P>But, before I enter upon the Que|&s;tion, I mu&s;t openly and profe&s;&s;edly di|&s;tingui&s;h upon the Thing we are talk|ing of; for I am certain, if we do not agree upon the Subject, we &s;hall never
<PB N="7" REF="6">
agree upon the Argument; and, I be|lieve mo&s;t of our Wrangling is for Want of determining fir&s;t what it is we are talking of: My Di&s;tinction is this:</P>
<P>I &s;ay, we mu&s;t <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h</HI> here be|tween the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> COMPANY and the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> TRADE: The Mi&s;take here is the Foundation of all that Cavil and Talk, to little Purpo&s;e, which we have had on this Occa&s;ion; the Diffe|rence is plain; the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> TRADE is one Thing, the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> COMPANY <HI>tradeing</HI> is another.</P>
<P>I grant what was formerly voted by the Hou&s;e of Commons in 1694, That <HI>it is mo&s;t for our Intere&s;t that the</HI> Trade <HI>to the</HI> Ea&s;t Indies <HI>be carry'd on by an exclu&s;ive Company:</HI> But this has no Re|lation to the main Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether <HI>Trade it&s;elf,</HI> whether with a Company or without a Company, <HI>is an advan|tageous Trade?</HI></P>
<P>Again, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between the Trade in Callicoes and Wrought Silks from <HI>India,</HI> on the one Hand, and the whole <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, con&s;ider'd complexly.</P>
<P>But the officious Advocates for the Callicoes, will not &s;uffer the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade to be &s;o pa&s;&s;ive or neutral in this Ca&s;e as they ought to be; but as
<PB N="8" REF="7">
an Argument to &s;upport the U&s;e of Callicoes, they bring the Company in|to the Debate, and, at la&s;t, they have petition'd to be heard.</P>
<P>It will be, as it were, but by Acci|dent, that we embark the Cau&s;e of the Callicoes and <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Silks in this Debate: That the Callicoes are de|&s;tructive to our Woollen and Silk Ma|nufactures, have le&s;&s;en'd their Con&s;ump|tion, beaten &s;everal Sorts of their Goods quite out of Trade; and that the Broad Cloth and Stuff Trade, in particular, are &s;till more and more declining up|on that Account, <HI>has been prov'd at the Bar of the Hou&s;e,</HI> and at the Board of Trade; and the Report of the Lords-Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade makes it out farther, thus:</P>
<Q><P>It being therefore &s;elf-evident, that Print|ed and Stained Callicoes and Linnens are u&s;ed and worn, by almo&s;t all Sorts of Peo|ple in this Kingdom, and that every Piece &s;o worn prevents the Con&s;umption of the &s;ame Quantity of our Woollen and Silk Manufa|ctures, we mu&s;t conclude, that the Complain|ants have been and are exceedingly di&s;cou|raged, and their Trade prejudiced thereby.</P></Q>
<P>But 'tis the Trade to <HI>India</HI> in general, not the Callicoes, that is now the Que|&s;tion, and whether it may pa&s;s under
<PB N="9" REF="8">
that Title of a beneficial Trade to the Nation, or not.</P>
<P>If my An&s;wer to this might di&s;tin|gui&s;h rightly of the Company's Cir|cum&s;tances, I &s;hould, after &s;ome Regu|lations, vote in Favour of the Trade; and I will not doubt, but, with nece&s;&s;ary Limitations, it might be allow'd to be an advantageous Trade: But without tho&s;e Limitations, I cannot venture to call it &s;o, by any Means; but, on the contrary, a Trade de&s;tructive to the Pro&s;perity of our Country, not only in the Woollen and Silk Manufactures, but many other Ways be&s;ides. What tho&s;e Limitations are, will appear in the Con&s;equence of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>There are but two Things, which, in this Ca&s;e, can denominate a foreign Trade gainful to the Nation.</P>
<P N="1">I. That it exports that which it is the Advantage of the Kingdom to ex|port.</P>
<P N="2">II. That it returns, or imports, &s;ome|thing of which we con&s;ume little at Home, and export much.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, <HI>I fear,</HI> will be able to claim neither of the&s;e Qualifi|cations;
<PB N="10" REF="9">
but, on the contrary, it ex|ports, or &s;ends out of the Nation, that <HI>which an&s;wers all Things,</HI> and brings back that which amounts to <HI>little</HI> or <HI>nothing;</HI> and it is in this Particular that the Merit of the whole Cau&s;e will lye.</P>
<P>Give the Advocates for the Trade to <HI>India</HI> their Due; they do not pre|tend to any Merit on Account of their Exportations; they did dwell upon it a little formerly; but they now give up that Point. <HI>I</HI> doubt 60000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, <HI>if I &s;hould allow &s;o much,</HI> will go near to be as great a Sum as they will claim to export in Manufactures, one Year with another: As to other Things, they are rather Trifles for the U&s;e of their Factories, than for a Market; &s;uch as Wine, Beer, Bottles, wrought Iron and Bra&s;s for Hou&s;hold-Stuff, and a few Manufactures for their own Wearing. The Company, indeed, perhaps to make a Show for that Occa&s;ion, have ju&s;t now made two Entries of Woollen Ma|nufactures, amounting to 4000 long Cloths, and 5000 Perpetuana's; but this is &s;uppos'd to be to make a Show, and we mu&s;t look far back for &s;uch another Entry. It has been &s;aid, they are oblig'd by their Charter to export 100000 <HI>l.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<HI>per Annum</HI> in Woollen Manufactures: It is &s;aid likewi&s;e, that they are limited, by the &s;ame Authority, to export no more than 300000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> in Bullion, neither of which Conditions they have ob&s;erv'd, if the Report of the Lords-Commi&s;&s;ioners be to be depended upon, <HI>as I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to que&s;tion it:</HI> By this Report, the very la&s;t Year's Exporta|tions of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade (for here the Company may be call'd the Trade) amounts to but 83179 <HI>l.</HI> 14 <HI>s.</HI> 5 <HI>d.</HI> tho' by far the greate&s;t Year of their Ex|ports, &s;ince 1715; by the la&s;t Year is meant 1718, the Account of 1719 having not been obtain'd; and the &s;ame Year they exported in Bullion 602844 <HI>l.</HI> 8 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> be&s;ides what they exported which was not enter'd, and be&s;ides what is carry'd out in private Trade; which two Articles, &s;ome tell us, amount to half the Sum; &s;o that their Exporta|tion of Silver mu&s;t then amount to 904266 <HI>l.</HI> 12 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d. per Ann.</HI> as to their Exportation of Bullion, the Account is mo&s;t &s;urprizing, indeed, and a bold Tre&s;pa&s;s upon the Law, if they are bound to export no more Bullion than, as above.</P>
<P>The Account above is taken out of their own Books, and reported by the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
Lords-Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade. But it appears, that in the Year 1717, they exported 875, 534 <HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> pub|lickly, be&s;ides all unenter'd and con|ceal'd, which, by the &s;ame Account, mu&s;t be above 1200000 <HI>l.</HI> in the Whole. Con&s;idering then their Trade to &s;tand thus, they may be &s;aid to export 16 &s;eventeenth Parts in Silver, and 1 &s;even|teenth Part only in Manufactures. We are in Debt to their Mode&s;ty &s;o much, as to acknowledge that they do not claim any Thing upon the Account of their Exportations; &s;o the fir&s;t Point is clear, namely, they do not <HI>export that which it is our Advantage to have exported.</HI></P>
<P>The only Plea then that the Compa|ny can make for the <HI>India Trade, (for while I &s;peak of the Company, I &s;hall &s;tick to what they plead them&s;elves)</HI> is upon their Imports; and I will put it as fair for them as can be de&s;ir'd, namely, <HI>That they export again &s;uch great Quan|tities of the Goods which they bring Home,</HI> as &s;ufficiently <HI>an&s;wers the Quantity or Value of the Bullion they &s;end away to the</HI> Indies; and upon this Foot, they would take off effectually, <HI>if the Fact were but true,</HI> all the Complaint made of their Exportation of Bullion: It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that if this Plea could be
<PB N="13" REF="12">
made good, they would gain a great Point; for whatever Goods the Trade from <HI>India</HI> &s;ends Abroad, to be con&s;um'd in foreign Parts, ought to be reckon'd clear Gain to the national Stock as to the Trade; and the Publick would owe them &s;o much Money in Specie; &s;o that then their exporting &s;o much Bullion, as the Value of tho&s;e Goods amounted to, would be no Tre&s;pa&s;s upon the nati|onal Stock, only taking out with one Hand what they put in with the other; tho' even in this Ca&s;e it wou'd not ap|pear that the Trade was gainful to the Publick, any farther than the Balance ari&s;ing from their Exportations, exceed|ed the Bullion they exported; for if they carry'd out all they brought in, what Gain could they be to the Pub|lick, which is the main Que&s;tion in Hand: Indeed, then they would plead the Merit of all the Manufactures which they export, as above, be&s;ides that of bringing Home &s;everal u&s;eful Things for our Home Con&s;umption, which we can|not well be without; &s;uch as, Salt Pe|ter, Pepper, Drugs, Dye, Stuffs, Coffee, Tea, Raw Silk, &amp;c. This, I think, is the full of what they alledge.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall an&s;wer this two Ways, and, I think, both &s;hall confute them effectually: <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I'll &s;uppo&s;e, that they really do export the full Quantity or Value of Goods which they &s;ay they do; their Ac|count which was publi&s;h'd in their Fa|vour, &s;ays, That for five Years, from <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> 1712 to <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> 1717, there was exported 3, 335, 928 <HI>l.</HI> Value in im|ported <HI>India</HI> Goods: Whether the Va|luation of the&s;e Goods is made before the Duties are drawn back, or after, we do not know; but I will &s;uppo&s;e it was without the Duties, which is &s;till in their Favour: The Pretence again&s;t this is, that the Bullion exported is not &s;o much as tho&s;e Goods exported in the &s;ame Time, by 1, 699, 671 <HI>l.</HI> But the Fal|lacy of all this will appear, by giving a more exact Account; for</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> This Account is unju&s;t, the five Years of Export of Bullion being not the &s;ame five Years of the Export of Goods: What the Rea&s;on of that Fraud is, I know not; the five Years of Ex|port of Bullion he reckons from the 29th of <HI>September</HI> 1711 to the 29th of <HI>September</HI> 1716; but for the Goods ex|ported he reckons from 1712 to 1717.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
2<HI>dly,</HI> This Export of Bullion is fal&s;e, and is only of the Bullion enter'd at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e by the Company, which all the World knows is not the Quantity of Bullion carry'd away by the Trade by a great deal: What the re&s;t may be, we know, and &s;hall give a particular Ac|count of, with the Exports of the fol|lowing Years, at the End of this Work.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, to go back to a ju&s;ter Authority for their Bullion exported, we have the Ab&s;tract of the Bullion ex|ported, taken by the Lords Commi&s;&s;ion|ers of Accompts, as above, and laid before the Parliament; and to which I refer.</P>
<P>There it appears, that at a Medium of four Years, taken from 1715 to 1718, inclu&s;ive, the Company exported in Bullion 467, 227 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>

So that the Export of Bullion, in five Years, exceeds the Export of <HI>India</HI> Goods in the &s;ame Length of Time 166, 774 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI></P>
<P>But what Need this Boa&s;ting! I &s;hall next prove, that if it were true, that they exported more Goods than they &s;ent Bullion away, yet, that every Groat of that Bullion remain'd unpaid for, and, by Con&s;equence, was &s;o much pick'd out of the Nation's Pocket, and a dead Lo&s;s to the publick Stock.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall therefore wave the&s;e Niceties of Accompts, and come to the Facts; and, 1<HI>&s;t, (for I &s;hall do it two Ways)</HI> there is great Rea&s;on to know, and be a&s;&s;ur'd, that &s;o great a Part of the&s;e Goods, re-exported, or &s;aid to be re-ex|ported, are not really &s;ent away, but are relanded in <HI>England;</HI> or, if they are really exported, are clande&s;tinely brought back, and con&s;um'd at Home: And, if this be prov'd, where will the Balance of the Exports be then, that &s;hould an&s;wer the Bullion?</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> Add to this the infinite Quan|tity of <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods imported upon us from <HI>Holland</HI> and other Parts; <HI>for this,</HI> to us, <HI>is a Part of the</HI> Ea&s;t India <HI>Trade;</HI> all which Goods are paid for, either with the Produce of tho&s;e other
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods which we export, or, in Defect thereof, with Money, which is the &s;ame Thing.</P>
<P>Some have computed, that the Quan|tities of <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, run in upon us from <HI>Holland,</HI> and con&s;um'd here, are not only equal in Value to all the Goods of our Company's exporting from hence, but much &s;uperior to them: Where then is our Bullion pro|cur'd? In &s;hort, the Bullion is then only bought with Bullion; that is to &s;ay, is taken away from the Balance of other Branches of our Trade, which are advantageous, and which &s;upply it: But as to the <HI>India</HI> Trade, it does no|thing for us.</P>
<P>If ever the U&s;e and Wearing of Cal|licoes and Silks comes to be prohibited, all this My&s;tery of Iniquity will be di&s;cover'd, or will di&s;cover it &s;elf. It is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be then hid; for no Body will import the Goods which no Body will buy; and no Body will buy the Goods which no Body will wear.</P>
<P>But this is not all; for if <HI>this Trade</HI> does nothing <HI>well</HI> for us, it mu&s;t do much <HI>ill</HI> again&s;t us; for there are no neutral Trades which do neither Good or Hurt. The Character of this Trade is, in
<PB N="18" REF="17">
&s;hort, what was printed of it near 20 Years ago, by an Author that examin'd it to the Bottom, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That it carry'd out that <HI>which an&s;wers all Things,</HI> and brings back that which evidently <HI>proves the De&s;truction of our own Manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;hort but pungent Argu|ments again&s;t the Benefit of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade in general, and are drawn up thus.</P>
<P N="1">1 Suppo&s;e the Company, with their Ser|vants and Officers, export yearly, as a|bove, 904266 <HI>l.</HI> 1 2 <HI>s.</HI> 9 <HI>d.</HI> in Bullion: The Quantity of Goods they bring Home is very great, their Sales make that ap|pear: But 'tis al&s;o certain that the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e Goods are for the Home Con&s;umption; &s;o that 'tis doubtful whether they export any Thing con&s;i|derable, but what is clande&s;tinely re|turn'd upon us and con&s;um'd here, and that too after the Government has been defrauded of the Duty: Let us exa|mine it critically.</P>
<P>The Principal Quantity of their Callicoes are exported to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh:</HI> 'Tis hard to judge what they are &s;ent thither for, &s;ince from thence <HI>it is too &s;ad a Truth,</HI> a very great Quantity of Callicoes and <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Wrought Silks are brought in
<PB N="19" REF="18">
upon us, by private Methods, without paying Cu&s;tom at all.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be a&s;k'd here, If the Methods by which it is done are pri|vate and conceal'd, how then does it appear to be &s;o? &s;ince if it was &s;ure that there were &s;uch Things done, the &s;ame Method, by which the Charge is prov'd, would di&s;cover and prevent it: But this is a Fallacy in it&s;elf, and is found &s;o by the Nature of the Thing; for it is known by its Con&s;equences as effectu|ally as if it was known by the Di&s;co|very of the particular Facts. <HI>For Ex|ample:</HI></P>
<P>The Report of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Accompts lays it down as a ju&s;t Cal|culation, that a Million of People wear Printed Callicoes and Painted Linnens in <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that they con|&s;ume five Yards <HI>per Ann.</HI> to each Per|&s;on, one with another, great and &s;mall; &s;o that by this Account, five Millions of Yards of Callicoes and Linnens, printed and painted, are con|&s;um'd in a Year.</P>
<P>Of this Quantity they allow again three Fourth Parts to be Callicoes, and one Fourth Part Linnens; &s;o that there remains to the Home Con&s;umption of Callicoes three Millions &s;even Hundred
<PB N="20" REF="19">
and fifty Thou&s;and Yards of Printed Callicoes in a Year, which is &s;o infi|nitely above the Quantity of Callicoes printed in a Year in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that indeed it makes the Baldance, which mu&s;t be all imported, a Prodigy in the Trade.</P>

<P>By this Account 'tis mo&s;t evident, that the Callicoes worn in <HI>Great Britain</HI> a|mount to more than the Callicoes print|ed in <HI>Great Britain</HI> by two Millions &s;e|ven Hundred &s;eventy five Thou&s;and five Hundred fifty and two Yards, which is a very great Quantity: But it will not re&s;t here.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take Leave to make one Ob|&s;ervation here from this ju&s;t Deduction of Quantities, namely, That were the other Advantages of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade much greater than will upon Examination be found, yet 'tis worth enquiring whether any Trade can be call'd profitable to a Nation, or indeed ought to be &s;uffer'd in this Kingdom, which, in the Con&s;equence of it, is a Protection to &s;uch a mon&s;trous Abu&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="21">
of the Publick and to the fair Traders, as well as to other Branches of Trade.</P>
<P>The endeavouring to continue any Part of their Trade at &s;o great an Ex|pence of their Country, is teally cri|minal in the very Nature of the Thing; and when &s;uch Evidence of this clan|de&s;tine Trade is brought, and of its being the Con&s;equence of the Company's trad|ing in Callicoes, and of their being thus con&s;um'd at Home, by which the inju|rious Trade is protected and render'd undi&s;coverable, the very Company it|&s;elf ought to come voluntarily, and of their own Choice, into Mea&s;ures to pre|vent it; and if no other Method can be propos'd, as it is certain none has been, and, 'tis believ'd, none can be, they ought to give up &s;uch a Branch, however otherwi&s;e profitable to them|&s;elves, as a ju&s;t Compen&s;ation for the Wrong: Such a Sacrifice would &s;hew, that it was their De&s;ire that the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade &s;hould be profitable to their Country, and &s;uch a Sacrifice would make it &s;o.</P>
<P>Then we &s;hould all plead for the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, as a Bu&s;ine&s;s many Ways u&s;eful, if not profitable; whereas now it appears, that it is not only unprofi|table, but very injurious to the Nation,
<PB N="23" REF="22">
and dangerous to other Branches of our Trade, which are mo&s;t profitable in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the Certainty of this clande&s;tine Trade is farther prov'd by the Manner of exporting the Callicoes which are printed here, or, at lea&s;t, the Pretence of doing it; and this I find &s;et out in Part, in a printed Paper, handed about at the Door of the Hou&s;e of Commons, entitled, <HI>The Ca&s;e of the</HI> Fair Traders, <HI>or a clear View and State of</HI> Clande&s;tine Trade, <HI>as now carry'd on in</HI> Great Bri|tain, wherein, among other Things, is the following Paragraph, concerning the Exporting Callicoes printed in <HI>En|gland</HI> to Parts beyond Sea, where <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Callicoes are not prohibited.</P>
<P>Callicoes printed here, are enter'd at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e for Exportation, but not &s;hipp'd off; or, if they are &s;hipp'd, reland|ed and con&s;um'd here, after <HI>8 d. per</HI> Yard on the Importation, and <HI>6 d. per</HI> Yard on the Stamp, are both drawn back.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the Quantity of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Printed Callicoes, exported thus by Certificate, and for all which there is drawn back 8 <HI>d. per</HI> Yard the white Duty, and 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Yard the Print Duty,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
is exceeding great; and the &s;ame Paper declares, That one Hou&s;e of Merchants <HI>(call'd</HI> DRAPERS) in <HI>London,</HI> has re|ceiv'd, in one Year, more than 10000 <HI>l.</HI> for Drawbacks on &s;uch Callicoes: What became of the Goods, and where they were con&s;um'd, it is very ea&s;y to judge.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly.</HI> The la&s;t Evidence of the Fact in both the&s;e Branches of clande&s;tine Trade, is from the frequent Seizures <HI>made by the Officers of the CUSTOMS</HI> of &s;uch Callicoes, as well tho&s;e Printed at Home as Abroad, a large Parcel of which are, even at this very Time, con|demn'd, and the Sale of them publi&s;h'd at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It is hard to make an exact Cal|culation of the Quantities of Goods, Numbers of Yards, and Value, in both the&s;e Articles of clande&s;tine Trade; but I have great Rea&s;on to believe, that he who publi&s;h'd, that the Lo&s;s to the Government in the Cu&s;toms only a|mounts to 400000 <HI>l. per Ann.</HI> is much within Compa&s;s; but what the Injury to the Nation in Trade is, no Man can calculate; 'tis an immen&s;e Sum, &s;carce credible &s;o much as to mention.</P>
<P>If there was really nothing el&s;e to be &s;aid again&s;t the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, than this, That, <HI>as before,</HI> it is the Occa&s;ion
<PB N="25" REF="24">
of, and a Protection to &s;uch a publick Mi&s;chief in Trade, as this clande&s;tine Way of Importation: This alone would be &s;ufficient to give it the Title of an injurious di&s;advantageous Trade.</P>
<P>Nor is this Cu&s;tom of running Calli|coes the only Mi&s;chief of the <HI>Ea&s;t In|dia</HI> Trade; for 'tis the &s;ame in the Tea, the Coffee, and the Pepper; the Exam|ples are mo&s;t flagrant; If the Quantities of Tea enter'd for Exportation were calculated in any &s;ingle Year, by the Cu&s;tom-Bills only, and that di&s;counted out of the Quantity of Tea imported, it would not leave a Proportion equal to the vi&s;ible Expence in <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> by a prodigious Quantity: Whence then can it be &s;upply'd but by foul Pra|ctices?</P>
<P>The Coffee ('till a late Engro&s;&s;ment of Coffee, has alter'd the Ca&s;e, and rais'd the Price) was to be bought cheap|er of the Druggi&s;t, by the Bale or Hun|dred, than the Duty and the Price co&s;t at the Candle amounted to, and that by 40 or 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and how &s;hould this be done, but by clande&s;tine un|fair Trading.</P>
<P>Pepper, &s;ince the high Duty of 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> lb. has wholly di&s;appear'd, as to the Duty; the Exportation has been as great as
<PB N="26" REF="25">
the Importation, within a Trifle; and the Home Con&s;umption has been re|duc'd to about four Bags of Sweepings, or thereabouts, in a Year; that is to &s;ay, there has not above four Bags paid Duty at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e in a Year; and yet we had no Want of Pepper in <HI>England,</HI> but have con&s;um'd as much as ever; and how has this been done, but by the Arts of Shipping and Re|landing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Article of <HI>foreign</HI> Ea&s;t India <HI>Goods,</HI> (I call them foreign, becau&s;e not import|ed by our Company, but by Stealth) has al&s;o another Thing in it, which overthrows all the Merit of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade; for, you mu&s;t note here, that I am talking of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade in general; that is to &s;ay, the Trade in <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, no Matter by whom imported, whether by our Company, or a foreign Company.</P>
<P>The Advocates for the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade plead, that &s;o great a Quantity of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods brought hither are re-exported&punc; that it over-pays for all the Bullion they carry out.</P>
<P>I have accounted for great Part of the&s;e Exportations, on the Foot of their re-landing: But I &s;ay, if that was not to be mention'd at all, I &s;hall over-ba|lance
<PB N="27" REF="26">
them, by the clande&s;tine Impor|tation of other <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, by Way of <HI>Holland,</HI> as al&s;o from <HI>India</HI> directly, by the private Traders on Board our own Ships; the prodigious Quantities of both the&s;e are &s;uch, that, I am a&s;&s;ur'd, they will amount to much more than all the Goods the Company here can pre|tend to &s;end Abroad, or than are &s;ent Abroad any Way from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if this be true, as I &s;ee no Room to doubt, what is become of all the Exportations of <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, boa&s;t|ed &s;o much of? 'Tis all &s;unk at once, and, in &s;hort, there are not only none at all exported; that is to &s;ay, in Effect; but there are more <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods con&s;um'd in <HI>Great Britain</HI> in a Year, than our own Company imports in all, by a very great Quantity.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, indeed, to make exact Calculations of the Value of Things that are thus done by Stealth, and in pri|vate; but the Sum is incredible, and exceeds all our Calculation.</P>
<P>A certain Draper, learned in the &s;muggling Trade, and who&s;e Importa|tions of foreign <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, if Fame belies him not, have borne a great Share in this Over-balance, has been pleas'd to &s;ay, at the Bar of the Hou&s;e
<PB N="28" REF="27">
of Commons, that the Number of Peo|ple in <HI>England</HI> who wear printed Cal|licoes, is very incon&s;iderable, in which he is pleas'd to differ &s;trangely from the Opinion of the Lords-Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade, who judge them to be a Million.</P>
<P>I have heard a judicious Ob&s;erver of the&s;e Things &s;ay, that he has calculated, that 320000 People were cloth'd in print|ed Callicoe and Linnen in the County of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> only, exclu&s;ive of the Cities and Liberties of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> Whether this Gentleman or the mode&s;t Pleader above were neare&s;t the Point, I leave to the Judicious.</P>
<P>The mode&s;t Draper above-nam'd, however, to make &s;ome Amends for under-doing it, in the Number of Wea|rers of Callicoe, allows 16 Yards of Cal|licoe to be con&s;um'd every Year by about 70000 People, who are all he allows to wear it; &s;o that by his Account, the Expence of Printed Callicoes in <HI>Great Britain</HI> amounts to no more, than one Million one Hundred and twenty Thou|&s;and Yards a Year; which is not far off of the Number of Yards printed in <HI>England,</HI> and which is the Fund he goes upon, &s;uppo&s;ing no more to be worn than he can prove are printed in <HI>Great</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
<HI>Britain.</HI> Now let us go both Ways to Work: Fir&s;t let us take his Number of Wearers, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners Quanti|ty, five Yards a Year to each Per&s;on, one with another; for &s;ome are Children, and take up but a little; &s;ome are good Hou&s;ewives, and make 'em &s;erve longer than a Year, which makes the whole of the Callicoes con&s;um'd in <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> in a Year, to be no more than 350000 Yards a Vear.</P>
<P>Were this true, the Gentleman was much in the Right, who put the Que&s;ti|on; namely, <HI>What Trifle then is it that they &s;truggle for thus with the whole Nation?</HI> But this is all ab&s;urd and ri|diculous; and the Account given by the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade of the Number of Per&s;ons wearing Calli|coes and Printed Linnens, being e&s;ti|mated at a Million, is certainly much more rational to make a Judgment up|on, tho', without doubt, much below the Fact: Nor do I make any Scruple to &s;ay, and in it I &s;peak the Judgment of Men of very good Under&s;tanding and Sincerity, that there are near two Millions of People in this I&s;land who are at this Time cloath'd in and u&s;ing Callicoe.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29">
And thus, if there were a Deficiency in the Number of Wearers, it is made up many other Ways: There are many Thou&s;ands of Women who have two or three &s;everal Suits of Callicoe at a Time, for Morning-Gowns, Wrapping-Gowns, and Mantua's, and &s;uch like, be&s;ides that out of the Number of Yards calculated by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, are excluded, the great Quantities u&s;ed in Furniture, &s;uch as Quilts for Beds and Window-Curtains, and the like.</P>
<P>All the U&s;e I make of the&s;e Calcula|tions of Numbers, is this: That from hence is judg'd the Proportion of the Quantities brought in upon us from Abroad, I mean &s;uch as are brought from <HI>India</HI> to us by the Way of <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI> or privately by our own Ships.</P>
<P>But as all Calculations of this Kind are liable to Exceptions, I'll take it their Way and our own together. The Drapers allow the Number of Yards worn by each Per&s;on to be larger than the Lords Report, being 16 in&s;tead of five Yards to each Per&s;on; the Lords Report al|lows the Number of Wearers to be a Million; and the other would in&s;i|nuate them to be no more than the Callicoes printed in <HI>England</HI> can cloath;
<PB N="31" REF="30">
but they bring no Argument to prove the Number of a Million is too great; &s;o I take it at a Medium, and cleaving to the Number of a Million of People, allow 12 Yards to each Per&s;on, thus:</P>
<P><TABLE>

<P>So that by this Rule there mu&s;t be Ten Millions four Hundred &s;even|ty two Thou&s;and five Hundred and ninety four Yards of Printed Callicoes clande&s;tinely imported among us in a
<PB N="32" REF="31">
Year, be&s;ides <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Wrought Silks, in a very great Quantity.</P>
<P>The Value of the&s;e requires another Calculation; and I de&s;ire to do it as mode&s;tly as it can be de&s;ir'd. I'll &s;up|po&s;e they co&s;t us (for we mu&s;t value them) not as they co&s;t Abroad, but as we pay for them at Home, for that is the Foot of the Account, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then we give 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Yard for them one with another (which, by the Way, is a very low E&s;timate) tho&s;e foreign printed Goods bearing the be&s;t Price, as being valu'd at much more, and indeed generally printed better than tho&s;e which are printed at Home; allowing then only 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per</HI> Yard upon the Quantity of Ten Mil|lions four Hundred &s;eventy two Thou|&s;and five Hundred ninety four Yards, it amounts to the Sum of One Million three Hundred and nine Thou&s;and and twenty four Pounds fifteen Shillings <HI>per Ann.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to bring all this to the Point, the&s;e clande&s;tinely imported Goods of <HI>India</HI> mu&s;t be paid for out of the Ex|portations of the Company's Goods
<PB N="33" REF="32">
from <HI>England,</HI> before one Ounce of the Bullion, they want for their yearly Exportation, can be purchas'd by them.</P>
<P>Then con&s;ider their Exportations to be for the mo&s;t Part re-landed, as has been &s;hewn. The Ballance of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade runs again&s;t us thus:</P>
<P>Bullion exported, eight Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds a Year.</P>
<P><HI>India</HI> Goods clande&s;tinely imported, One Million &s;ixty five Thou&s;and four Hundred and nineteen Pounds.</P>
<P>The Foot of this Account, is one Million eight Hundred and &s;ixty five Thou&s;and four Hundred and nineteen Pounds a Year dead Lo&s;s to the Nation by the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>Only, that out of this mu&s;t be rec|kon'd &s;o much Pepper and other Goods as are really exported and not run back on Shore, which may amount to about three Hundred and fifty Thou|&s;and Pounds a Year at the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this is to be plac'd all the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Wrought Silks, and Stuffs mixt with Silks, all the Handkerchiefs and Mu&s;lins that are run in upon us again, as well from <HI>Holland</HI> as from on Board our own Ships, which amount to a very great Quantity; and 'tis believ'd will fully ballance the other.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
But if all the&s;e were to be reckon'd as nothing, or thrown for the Supply of any &s;uppos'd Over-reckoning in the above Calculation, or re&s;erv'd <HI>in Petto,</HI> for a farther Account, there is yet a vi&s;ible Ballance again&s;t them.</P>
<P>So that we lo&s;e by the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> fifteen Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds a Year: Deny it they that can.</P>
<P>It is in vain to plead the Shipping, the Seamen, the People employ'd in this Trade, their Merit in Loans to the Government, or the like; no Trade, carrying out Money, and returning what is con&s;um'd at Home, can be gain|ful to the Nation.</P>
<P>I wholly leave out of the Que&s;tion the Mi&s;chief of the Goods they return, and the Hurt they do to our Manu|factures; that's a Debate by it&s;elf; but I am now only upon the Subject of meer Profit and Lo&s;s to the Publick by the <HI>Ea&s;t India Trade.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to omit, how glo|rious an Advantage there is now put in|to our Hands, nay, and into the Com|pany's Hands al&s;o, to put a Stop to all this; to make them what they never were yet, <HI>viz.</HI> A profitable Company, and to &s;hut the Door again&s;t Foreigners
<PB N="35" REF="34">
abu&s;ing us, and yet leave the Company a flouri&s;hing Company too.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, but a fallacious Advan|tage to take of them, and &s;ay, if their Callicoe Trade is &s;o &s;mall, why do they labour for it &s;o hard? Why com|plain of &s;o much Injury done them? Why &s;et it in Competition with the whole Woollen Manufacture and Trade of <HI>Great Britain?</HI> I &s;ay, this would be a fallacious Advantage, <HI>though, as taken from the Mouth of their own Pleader, it would be ju&s;t, as to them:</HI> For the Fact is not Truth, the Quantity is infinite|ly more; and &s;o great, that our own Company is not able to &s;upply the De|mand, no nor even the <HI>Dutch;</HI> but our interloping Traders have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to erect another Company in <HI>Flanders,</HI> which they call <HI>Imperial;</HI> but, as it is well known, is erected upon and carry'd on by a Sub&s;cription of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stock, and &s;upply'd even with Captains, Factors, Seamen, and Ships from <HI>England:</HI> In Return for which, they &s;upply <HI>England</HI> with their Goods; that is to &s;ay, they &s;pread the Poi&s;on farther among us; and this very Draper&punc; who pleaded at the Bar of the Hou&s;e, and others, that may be nam'd, were known to go over to <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> to the Sale of <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods
<PB N="36" REF="35">
there, and to buy great Quantities of Goods there: How tho&s;e Goods were brought over into <HI>England,</HI> the only Market for them, is &s;till a Que&s;tion, which is worth a&s;king.</P>
<P>So that here is another Influx of <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, how great, Heaven only and the Gentlemen-Drapers know. But this we all know, that the&s;e al&s;o mu&s;t all be paid for from <HI>England,</HI> be|fore one Ounce of that Bullion they talk of bringing back can come in; and where then is the Bullion found which they carry away, and which purcha&s;es all the Goods in <HI>India?</HI> The An&s;wer is ready, 'tis even bought with Bullion, 'tis Money bought with Money, 'tis &s;ent away at the Nation's Expence.</P>
<P>And here we &s;en&s;ibly feel the Da|mage &s;u&s;tain'd by the Publick from this Trade, namely, the Le&s;&s;ening and Con&s;umption of our current Coin&punc; whether they melt it down or no, I will not enquire here; that is a dark Trade by it&s;elf, which de&s;erves to be en|quir'd into; and which, if enquir'd into, may ea&s;ily be laid open. But does any Silver, (that's the Que&s;tion that will try it all) go to the Mint? The com|mon Accidents of the World, and the ordinary Occa&s;ions of Trade and Tra|velling,
<PB N="37" REF="36">
will nece&s;&s;arily dimini&s;h the Coin if there is not a Supply. <HI>And why are we not &s;upply'd?</HI> Why no Silver &s;ent to the Mint? But becau&s;e of the immen&s;e Quantities &s;ent away to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI></P>
<P>And here, if we cou'd dilate and ex|tend our Thoughts to con&s;ider not our own Trade &s;ingly, but the general Trade of the World, we &s;hou'd find the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade ruinous and de&s;tructive to the general Trade of all this Part of the World, as well as to ours in parti|cular.</P>
<P>To judge of this, you mu&s;t con&s;ider <HI>Europe</HI> as one Body, one Nation, or one general Intere&s;t in Trade, and &s;et the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade again&s;t it as another. The <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade exhau&s;ts the whole Trea&s;ure of <HI>Europe,</HI> and de|&s;troys thereby their Trade; carrying every Year &s;uch immen&s;e Sums of Mo|ny in Specie out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>India,</HI> that the whole Body feels the want of it very &s;en&s;ibly. In Return of which, they bring their chief Manufactures and their Growth, and fill the&s;e Parts of the World with Gaiety and Trifles, and rob them a &s;econd Time of the Employment of their People. Some Part of <HI>Europe</HI> indeed have been wi|&s;er
<PB N="38" REF="37">
than we are, and have prohibited the U&s;e and Con&s;umption of all the&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods for the very Rea&s;ons that indeed all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> ought to do the &s;ame; namely, becau&s;e they rob them of their Coin, and &s;tarve their Poor. This carrying the Mony thus away into <HI>India</HI> from <HI>Europe</HI> in gene|ral, is evident in the different Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> for there are more Channels than this one, tho' by all the Chan|nels it runs into the &s;ame Place. For Example,</P>
<P><HI>England, Holland, Flanders, France, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> &s;end their Mo|ny in the &s;ame manner in Bulk, and about by long Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> tran&s;mits va&s;t Sums, even all the Silver they can get by Trade: I &s;ay, they &s;end it down the Red Sea, and by the Gulph of <HI>Mocha,</HI> to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> and Bay of <HI>Bengale&punc;</HI> and all tho&s;e Places, to buy <HI>India</HI> Goods; which again they &s;ell into <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and bring back the Silver; which &s;upplies that Export. The <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade does the like, for all the Sil|ver the <HI>Turks</HI> get from <HI>Europe,</HI> which is no &s;mall Quantity, dreins off this Way, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">
Thus, in a Word, <HI>Europe,</HI> like a Body in a warm Bath, with its Veins open'd, lies bleeding to Death; and her Bul|lion, which is the Life and Blood of her Trade, flows all to <HI>India,</HI> where 'tis ama&s;s'd into infinite Heaps, for the enriching the Heathen World at the Expence of the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>From this great Cau&s;e of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Po|verty come all the Shifts and Projects of <HI>Europe,</HI> for rai&s;ing imaginary Wealth in the room of real Wealth; &s;ub&s;tituting Credit, which indeed is but Air, in|&s;tead of Bullion, and Paper in&s;tead of Money; and they do indeed &s;upply the Want of the Species, or el&s;e <HI>Europe,</HI> which is a trading Nation, <HI>if we may, as above, &s;peak of it all as one Body,</HI> could not carry on her Commerce. Her Product and Manufactures wou'd not circulate for want of Money to a&s;&s;i&s;t that Circulation, and to circulate with it; for, in &s;hort, Money is the Stream of Trade which carries <HI>the Product and Manufactures;</HI> that is to &s;ay, Merchan|di&s;e along with it. And if the Mer|chandi&s;e did not thus float upon the Water, that is Money, 'twou'd be a-Ground, &s;tand and &s;tagnate, and wou'd never be carry'd from Place to Place.</P>
<P><PB REF="39">
The Goods go out, the Money comes in; more are carry'd out upon the Strength of that Money, and the like. But here the Order of Trade is invert|ed; for in the Trade to <HI>India</HI> the Goods do not go out; the Product and Manufacture does not go out to fetch in the Money, as is the natural Cour&s;e of Trade, but the Money goes out to fetch the Goods in; and this, in Trade, is letting out the Blood, and with it the Life.</P>
<P>There is an Evidence of this pa&s;t Con|tradiction in the ordinary Affairs of Trade in <HI>Europe.</HI> For Example, if by the Interruptions of War, or any other Accident of the Sea, or Pyrates, or whatever it be, the Galloons from <HI>New Spain</HI> are prevented coming to <HI>Europe,</HI> by which the Quantity of Bul|lion is &s;upply'd and kept up; we im|mediately feel the Lo&s;s; Trade, like the Belly, mi&s;&s;es its Food; a Scarcity ap|pears, like that of Corn in the Markets after a bad Harve&s;t; and the Price ad|vances 'till a Supply comes.</P>
<P>What is the Rea&s;on, but this, that the Trade to <HI>India</HI> exhau&s;ts the World, the Money drains all away in&s;en&s;ibly, and grows &s;carce?</P>
<P><PB REF="40">
The other Trade of <HI>Europe</HI> does not do thus: If the Money goes out of one Country into another, it pa&s;&s;es from thence into a Third, and thence again into a Fourth, and &s;o back again from whence it came, and round again; ever circulating like the Blood in the Veins, and carries with it the Spirits, which nouri&s;h the whole.</P>
<P>But <HI>India,</HI> like the Grave, &s;wallows up all, and makes no Return; <HI>that is,</HI> the Money never returns: What they &s;end us back, <HI>is nothing;</HI> 'tis con&s;um'd here, and &s;o vani&s;hes and dies away; &s;erving only to ama&s;s more Bullion to be carry'd away; till, in a Word, it im|poveri&s;hes not <HI>England</HI> only, but all <HI>Europe.</HI> And was Gold as good a Com|modity in <HI>England</HI> as Silver, we &s;hou'd not have Mony left to carry on the common Cour&s;e of Trade.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, 'tis clear, That the Trade to <HI>India</HI> is a di&s;advantageous Trade, in its own Nature, not to <HI>Eng|land</HI> only, but to all <HI>Europe.</HI> 'Tis hard we &s;hou'd have it to &s;ay, 'tis more di&s;|advantageous to <HI>England</HI> than to any other Part of <HI>Europe.</HI> But this is our Ca&s;e; the Rea&s;ons are,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="$$" REF="41">
1. <HI>Becau&s;e England</HI> being a manufa|cturing Country, and more engag'd in the manufacturing Part than all <HI>Europe;</HI> be&s;ides the bringing back of <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures among us, for Cheapne&s;s and Gaiety plea&s;ing to our People; we &s;uffer more in our own Manufa|ctures, than any other Nation can do in theirs.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> other Nations, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have Manufactures of their own, whether of Wooll, or Silk, or both, have been wi&s;er than we, and have taken the Alarm early, and &s;hut the Door of Trade again&s;t them; pro|hibiting the U&s;e and Wear of them, under the &s;evere&s;t Penalties; thinking it enough that the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade carries out their ready Mony, and impoveri&s;hes them that Way, and not allowing them to come back and ruin their People, by &s;upplanting their Manufactures with the Returns; &s;o cutting their Throats with their own Knife. This we hope for, tho' we are not arriv'd to it yet.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Becau&s;e England</HI> not only receives all the Manufactures of <HI>India,</HI> brought by our own People, but is the Center of the Con&s;umption of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods for the <HI>Dutch French, Fleming,</HI> and, in a Word, for all the Companies of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="42">
who&s;e Goods are run boldly i$ upon us; and we as &s;upinely run into the Expence of them, to the Ruin of our Trade, and De&s;truction of our Ma|nufactures.</P>
<P>Neither of the&s;e three Particulars can be &s;aid of any other Nation of <HI>Europe;</HI> and therefore the <HI>India</HI> Trade, injurious to them all, is yet more parti|cularly di&s;advantageous to us than to any of the others.</P>
<P N="1">1. I cannot clo&s;e this Work, without ob&s;erving how effectually all this might be prevented, how ea&s;y a Stop might be put to it, and to what infinite Ad|vantage to Trade, by this only Me|thod; namely, of forbidding the U&s;e and Wearing of printed Callicoes and Linnens.</P>
<P N="2">2. That no other Method but this can do it, no Prohibitions, no Penalties, no Forfeitures; no, not if Running them were to be puni&s;h'd with Death, or Tran&s;portation, which is wor&s;e than Death.</P>
<P>But once forbid the U&s;e and Wearing, the Work is done; what no Body can wear or u&s;e, no Body will buy; what no Body will buy, no Body will bring to Market; what no Body will bring to Market, no Body will fetch
<PB N="44" REF="43">
from Abroad. And thus the Trade will be at a full Stop at once.</P>
<P>It has been too plain, that all Laws for preventing clande&s;tine Trade, where the Gain of it is &s;o high, are in vain. The Running of <HI>French</HI> Brandy is a Proof of this, which is done &s;o open|ly, that <HI>French</HI> Brandy is now to be bought, upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> as cheap, within a Trifle, as at <HI>Calais;</HI> and &s;o of all other Goods, for 10 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Men will contract to Run in any Kind of Goods that come from Abroad; and en&s;ure them into our Shops, &s;uch as Pepper, Coffee, Tea, Callicoes, Chints, <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> wrought Silks, <HI>French</HI> Bro|cades, <HI>Dutch</HI> Blacks, Linnens, Fine Hol|lands, and, in a Word, almo&s;t every Thing.</P>
<P>But once prohibit the U&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> wearing Cloths, and you ef|fectually &s;top it all.</P>
<P>'Tis a Particular to the Callicoes and <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, that they are chiefly u&s;ed for upper Garments: If they were le&s;s expos'd, 'twou'd be more dif|ficult to re&s;train them; but as it is, 'tis ea&s;y to do it.</P>
<P>It remains to &s;how, that if this was done, the chief Grievance of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade wou'd be over; not but
<PB N="45" REF="44">
they would be an advantageous Trade even then, but they would do much le&s;s Harm than now, and yet wou'd drive a very great and profitable Trade to them&s;elves: And with this Note &s;hall clo&s;e this Work, re&s;erving the Ex|planation of it to another Time.</P>
