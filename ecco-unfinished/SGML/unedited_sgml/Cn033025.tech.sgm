<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is &s;o cu&s;tomary to write
Prefaces to all Books of
this Kind to introduce them
with the more Advantage into
the World, that I cannot omit it,
tho' on that Account, 'tis thought, this
Work needs a <HI>Preface</HI> le&s;s than any
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
that ever went before it; the plea&s;ant
and delightful Part &s;peaks for it &s;elf;
the u&s;eful and in&s;tructive Part is &s;o
large, and capable of &s;o many Improve|ments,
that it would imploy a Book,
large as it &s;elf, to make Improve|ments
&s;uitable to the va&s;t Variety of
the Subject.</P>
<P>Here's Room for ju&s;t and copious Ob|&s;ervations,
on the Ble&s;&s;ing, and Ad|vantages
of a &s;ober and well govern'd
Education, and the Ruin of &s;o many
Thou&s;ands of Youths of all Kinds, in
this Nation, for want of it; al&s;o
how much publick Schools, and Charities
might be improv'd to prevent the De|&s;truction
of &s;o many unhappy Children,
as, in this Town, are every Year Bred
up for the Gallows.</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable Condition of unhap|py
Children, many of who&s;e natural
<PB N="v" REF="4">
Tempers are docible, and would lead
them to learn the be&s;t Things rather than
the wor&s;t, is truly deplorable, and is
abundantly &s;een in the Hi&s;tory of this
Man's Childhood; where, though Cir|cum&s;tances
form'd him by Nece&s;&s;ity to
be a Thief, a &s;trange Rectitude of
Principles remain'd with him, and
made him early abhor the wor&s;t Part of
his Trade, and at la&s;t wholly leave it
off: If he had come into the World with
the Advantage of Education, and been
well in&s;tructed how to improve the
generous Principles he had in him,
what a Man might he not have
been.</P>
<P>The various Turns of his Fortunes
in the World, make a delightful Field
for the Reader to wander in; a Garden
where he may gather whole&s;ome and
medicinal Plants, none noxcious or
poi&s;onous; where he will &s;ee Virtue
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
and the Ways of Wi&s;dom, every where
applauded, honoured, encouraged, re|warded;
Vice and all Kinds of Wick|edne&s;s
attended with Mi&s;ery, many
Kinds of Infelicities, and at la&s;t, Sin
and Shame going together, the Per|&s;ons
meeting with Reproof and Re|proach,
and the Crimes with Abhor|rence.</P>
<P>Every wicked Reader will here be
encouraged to a Change, and it will
appear that the be&s;t and only good
End of a wicked mi&s;pent Life is Re|pentance;
that in this, there is Comfort,
Peace, and often times Hope, and that
the Penitent &s;hall be return'd like the
Prodigal, <HI>and his latter End be better
than his Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>While the&s;e Things, and &s;uch as
the&s;e, are the Ends and De&s;igns of the
whole Book, <HI>I think,</HI> I need not &s;ay
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
one Word more as an Apology for any
part of the re&s;t, no, nor for the
whole; if Di&s;couraging every thing that
is Evil, and encouraging every thing
that is vertuous and good; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> If
the&s;e appear to be the whole Scope and
De&s;ign of the Publi&s;hing this Story,
no Objection can lye again&s;t it, neither
is it of the lea&s;t Moment to enquire
whether the Colonel hath told his own
Story true or not; If he has made it a
<HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> or a <HI>Parable,</HI> it will be
equally u&s;eful, and capable of doing
Good; and in that it recommends it
&s;elf without any other <HI>Introduction.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
Col. JACK, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_SEEING my Life has been &s;uch a
Checquer Work of Nature, and that
I am able now to look back upon
it from a &s;afer Di&s;tance, than is ordi|narily
the Fate of the Clan to which
I once belong'd; I think my Hi&s;tory may find
a place in the World, as well as &s;ome, who I &s;ee
are every Day read with plea&s;ure, tho' they have
in them nothing &s;o Diverting, or In&s;tructing, as I
believe mine will appear to be.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8">
MY original may be as high as any Bodies for
ought I know, for my Mother kept very good Com|pany,
but that part belongs to her Story, more than
to mine; all I know of it, is by oral Tradition
t$us; my Nur&s;e told me my Mother was a Gentle|woman,
that my Father was a Man of Quality,
and &s;he (my Nur&s;e) had a good peice of Money
given her to take me off his Hands, and deliver
him and my Mother from the Importunities that
u&s;ually attend the Misfortune, of having a Child
to keep that &s;hould not be &s;een or heard of.</P>
<P>MY Father it &s;eems gave my Nur&s;e &s;omething
more than was agreed for at my Mother's reque&s;t,
upon her &s;olemn Promi&s;e that &s;he would u&s;e me
well, and let me be put to School, and charg'd her
that if I liv'd to come to any bigne&s;s, capable to
under&s;tand the meaning of it, &s;he &s;hould always
take care to bid me <HI>remember, that I was a Gentle|man,</HI>
and this he &s;aid was all the Education he
would de&s;ire of her for me, for he did not doubt,
he &s;aid, but that &s;ometime or other the very hint
would in&s;pire me with Thoughts &s;uitable to my
Birth, and that I would certainly act like a Gen|leman,
if I believed my&s;elf to be &s;o.</P>
<P>BUT my Di&s;&s;a&s;ters were not directed to end as
&s;oon as they began; 'tis very &s;eldom that the Un|fortunate
are &s;o but for a Day, as the Great ri&s;e by
degrees of Greatne&s;s to the Pitch of Glory, in
which they &s;hine, &s;o the Mi&s;erable &s;ink to the
depth of their Mi&s;ery by a continu'd Series of
Di&s;&s;a&s;ter, and are long in the Tortures and Ago|nies
of their di&s;tre&s;s'd Circum&s;tances before a
Turn of Fortune, if ever &s;uch a thing happens to
them, gives them a pro&s;pect of Deliverance.</P>
<P>MY Nur&s;e was as hone&s;t to the Engagement
&s;he had enter'd into, as cou'd be expected from
<PB N="3" REF="9">
one of her Employment, and particularly as
hone&s;t as her Circum&s;tances would give her leave
to be; for &s;he Bred me up very carefully with
her own Son, and with another Son of &s;hame <HI>like
me,</HI> who &s;he had taken upon the &s;ame Terms.</P>
<P>MY Name was <HI>John,</HI> as &s;he told me, but nei|ther
&s;he or I, knew any thing of a Sir-name that
belong'd to me; &s;o I was left to call my&s;elf Mr.
Any-thing, what I pleas'd, as Fortune and better
Circum&s;tances &s;hould give occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT happen'd that&punc; her own Son (<HI>for &s;he had a
little Boy of her own, about One Year older than I</HI>)
was call'd <HI>John</HI> too, and about two Year after &s;he
took another, <HI>Son of Shame,</HI> as I call'd it above,
to keep as &s;he did me, and his Name was <HI>John</HI>
too.</P>
<P>As we were all <HI>Johns,</HI> we were all <HI>Jacks,</HI> and &s;oon
came to be call'd &s;o, for at that Part of the Town,
where we had our Breeding, <HI>viz.</HI> near <HI>Goodma's-fields,</HI>
the <HI>Johns</HI> are generally call'd <HI>Jack;</HI> but my
Nur&s;e, who may be allow'd to di&s;tingui&s;h her own
Son a little from the re&s;t, would have him call'd
Captain, becau&s;e for&s;ooth he was the elde&s;t.</P>
<P>I WAS provok'd at having this Boy call'd Cap|tain,
and I cried and told my Nur&s;e I would be call'd
Captain, for &s;he told me I was a Gentleman,
and I would be a Captain, that I would: The
good Woman to keep the Peace, told me ay, ay,
I was a Gentleman, and therefore I &s;hould be a|bove
a Captain, for I &s;hould be a Colonel, and that
was a great deal better than a Captain; for my
Dear, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> every Tarpawlin if he gets but to
be Lieutenant of a Pre&s;s-Smack is call'd Captain,
but Colonels are Soldiers, and none but Gentle|men
are ever made Colonels; be&s;ides, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I
have known Colonels come to be Lords, and Ge|nerals,
<PB N="4" REF="10">
tho' they were Ba&s;&mdash;ds at fir&s;t, and there|fore
you &s;hall be call'd Colonel.</P>
<P>WELL, I was hu&s;h'd indeed with this for the
pre&s;ent, but not thoroughly pleas'd, till a little
while after I heard her tell her own Boy, that I
was a Gentleman, and therefore he mu&s;t call me
Colonel, at which her Boy fell a crying, and he
would be call'd Colonel; that Part pleas'd me to the
Life, that he &s;hould cry to be call'd Colonel, for
then I was &s;atisfy'd that it was above a Captain:
So univer&s;ally is Ambition &s;eated in the Minds of
Men, that not a Beggar-boy but has his &s;hare
of it.</P>
<P>So here was Colonel <HI>Jack,</HI> and Captain <HI>Jack,</HI> as
for the third Boy, he was only plain <HI>Jack</HI> for
&s;ome Years after, till he came to Preferment by
the Merit of his Birth, as you &s;hall hear in its
Place.</P>
<P>WE were hopeful Boy's all Three of us, and
promis'd very early by many repeated Circum|&s;tances
of our Lives, that we would be all Rogues,
and yet I cannot &s;ay, if what I have heard of my
Nur&s;es Character be true, but the hone&s;t Woman
did what &s;he cou'd to prevent it.</P>
<P>BEFORE I tell you much more of our Story, it
would be very proper to give you &s;omething of
our &s;everal Characters, as I have gather'd them up
in my Memory, as far back as I can recover
things, either of my&s;elf&punc; or my Brother <HI>Jacks,</HI>
and they &s;hall be Brief and Impartial.</P>
<P><HI>Capt.</HI> JACK, was the elde&s;t of us all, by a whole
Year, he was a &s;quat, big, &s;trong made Boy, and
promis'd to be &s;tout when grown up to be a
Man, but not to be tall. His Temper was &s;ly,
&s;ullen, re&s;erv'd, malicious, revengeful; and with|al,
he was bruti&s;h, bloody, and cruel in his Di&s;po|&s;ition;
<PB N="5" REF="11">
he was as to manners a meer Boor, or Clown,
of a Carman like Breed; &s;harp as a Street bred
Boy mu&s;t be, but ignorant and unteachable from
a Child. He had much the Nature of a Bull Dog,
bold and de&s;perate, but not generous at all; all
the School-Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es we went to, could never
make him learn, no, not &s;o much as to make him
know his Letters; and as if he was born a Thief,
he would &s;teal every thing that came near him,
even as &s;oon almo&s;t as he could Speak; and that,
not from his Mother only, but from any Body
el&s;e, and from us too that were his Brethren and
Companions. He was an original Rogue, for he
would do the foule&s;t and mo&s;t villainous Things,
even by his own Inclination; he had no Ta&s;te or
Sen&s;e of being Hone&s;t, no, not, I &s;ay, to his
Brother Rogues; which is what other Thieves
make a point of Honour of; I mean that of being
Hone&s;t to one another.</P>
<P>THE other, that is to &s;ay, the younge&s;t of us
<HI>Johns,</HI> was called Major <HI>Jack,</HI> by the Accident
following; the Lady that had depo&s;ited him with
our Nur&s;e, had own'd to her that it was a Major
of the Guards that was the Father of the Child;
but that &s;he was obliged to conceal his Name, and
that was enough. So he was at fir&s;t call'd <HI>John</HI>
the <HI>Major,</HI> and afterwards the <HI>Major,</HI> and at la&s;t,
when we came to rove together, Major <HI>Jack,</HI> ac|cording
to the re&s;t, for his Name was <HI>John,</HI> as I
have ob&s;erv'd already.</P>
<P><HI>Major</HI> JACK was a merry, facetions plea&s;ant
Boy, had a good &s;hare of Wit, e&s;pecially <HI>Off-hand-Wit,</HI>
as they call it; was full of Je&s;ts and good
Humour, and as I often &s;aid, had &s;ome thing of
a Gentleman in him; he had a true Manly
Courage, fear'd nothing, and could look Death
<PB N="6" REF="12">
in the Face, without any He&s;itation; and yet if
he had the Advantage, was the mo&s;t generous and
mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate Creature alive; he had
native Principles of Gallantry in him, without
any thing of the brutal or terrible Part that the
Captain had; and in a Word, he wanted nothing but
Hone&s;ty to have made him an excellent Man; he
Had learned to read as I had done, and as he talk'd
very well, &s;o he wrote good Sen&s;e, and very hand|&s;ome
Language, as you will &s;ee in the proce&s;s of
his Story.</P>
<P>As for your humble Servant, Colonel <HI>Jack,</HI>
he was a poor unhappy tractable Dog, willing
enough, and capable too, to learn any thing, if
he had had any but the Devil for his School-Ma|&s;ter:
He &s;et out into the World &s;o early, that
when he began to do Evil, he under&s;tood nothing
of the Wickedne&s;s of it, nor what he had to ex|pect
for it: I remember very well, that when I
was once carried before a Ju&s;tice, for a Theft
which indeed I was not guilty of, and defended
my &s;elf by Argument, proving the Mi&s;takes of
my Accu&s;ers, and how they contradicted them|&s;elves;
the Ju&s;tice told me it was pitty I had not
been better employ'd, for I was certainly better
taught; in which however his Wor&s;hip was mi&s;ta|ken,
for I had never been taught any thing, but
to be a Thief; except, as I &s;aid, to read, and
write, and that was all, before I was ten Years
old: But I had a natural Talent of Talking, and
could &s;ay as much to the Purpo&s;e as mo&s;t People
that had been taught no more than I.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s'd among my Comrades for a bold re&s;o|lute
Boy, and one that dur&s;t fight any thing;
but I had a different Opinion of my &s;elf, and
therefore &s;hun'd Fighting as much as I could,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
tho' &s;ometimes, I ventur'd too, and came off well,
being very &s;trong made, and nimble withal.
However, I many times brought my &s;elf off with
my Tongue, where my Hands would not have been
&s;ufficient; and this as well after I was a Man, as
while I was a Boy.</P>
<P>I was Wary and Dextrous at my Trade, and was
not &s;o often catch'd as my Fellow Rogues, I mean
while I was a Boy, and never, after I came to
be a Man, no, not once for $26 Years, being &s;o
old in the Trade, and &s;till unhang'd as you
&s;hall hear.</P>
<P>AS for my Per&s;on, while I was a dirty Gla&s;s-Bottle
Hou&s;e Boy, &s;leeping in the A&s;hes, and deal|ing
always in the Street Dirt, it cannot be expect|ed
but that I look'd like what I was, and &s;o we did
all; that is to &s;ay, like a <HI>Black your Shoes your
Honour,</HI> a Beggar Boy, a Black-Guard Boy, or
what you plea&s;e, de&s;picable, and mi&s;erable, to
the la&s;t Degree; and yet I remember, the Peo|ple
would &s;ay of me, that Boy has a good Face;
if he was wa&s;h'd, and well dre&s;s'd, he would be
a good pretty Boy, do but look what Eyes he has,
what a plea&s;ant &s;miling Countenance, 'tis Pitty!
I wonder what the Rogues Father and Mother was,
and the like; then they would call me, and ask
me my Name; and I would tell them my Name
was <HI>Jack.</HI> But what's your Sir Name, Sirrah? &s;ays
they: I don't know &s;ays I: Who is your Father
and Mother? I have none, &s;aid I. What, and
never had you any? &s;aid they: No, &s;ays I, not
that I know of: Then they would &s;hake their
Heads, and cry, poor Boy! and 'tis a Pitty! <HI>and
the like!</HI> and &s;o let me go. But I &s;ay'd up all
the&s;e things in my Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14">
I WAS almo&s;t 10 Year old, the Captain 11,
and the Major about 8, when the good Woman
my Nur&s;e died; her Husband was a Seaman, and
had been drown'd a little before in the <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>
Frigat. one of the King's Ships which was Ca&s;t
away going to <HI>Scotland</HI> with the Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the hone&s;t
Woman dying very Poor, the Pari&s;h was oblig'd
to bury her; when the three young <HI>Jacks</HI> at|tended
her Corps, and I the Colonel, for we all
pa&s;s'd for her own Children, was Chief Mourner,
the Captain who was the elde&s;t Son, going back
very &s;ick.</P>
<P>THE good Woman being dead, we, the three
<HI>Jacks,</HI> were turn'd loo&s;e to the World; as to the
Pari&s;h providing for us, we did not trouble our
&s;elves much about that; we rambl'd about all three
together, and the People in <HI>Ro&s;emary-Lane,</HI> and
<HI>Ratcliff,</HI> and that Way knowing us pretty well,
we got Victuals ea&s;ily enough, and without much
B$gging.</P>
<P>FOR my particular Part, I got &s;ome Reputation,
for a mighty civil hone&s;t Boy; for if I was &s;ent
of an Errand, I always did it punctually and
carefully, and made ha&s;te again; and if I was
tru&s;ted with any thing, I never touch'd it to di|mini&s;h
it, but made it a Point of Honour to be
punctual to whatever was committed to me, tho' I
was as Errant a Thief as any of them in all other
Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>IN like Ca&s;e, &s;ome of the poorer Shop-Keep|ers,
would often leave me at their Door, to look
after their Shops, 'till they went up to Dinner,
or 'till they went over the Way to an Ale-Hou&s;e,
and the like, and I always did it freely and chear|fully,
and with the utmo&s;t Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="15">
<HI>Capt.</HI> JACK on the contrary, a &s;urly, ill-look'd,
rough Boy, had not a Word in his Mouth that &s;avour|ed
either of good Manners, or good Humour; he
wou$d &s;ay yes, and no, ju&s;t as he was ask'd a Que&s;tion,
and that was all, but no Body got any thing from
him that was obliging in the lea&s;t; if he was &s;ent
of an Errand he would forget half of it, and it may
be go to play, if he met any Boys, and never go
at all, or if he went never come back with an An|&s;wer;
which was &s;uch a regardle&s;s, di&s;obliging
Way, that no Body, had a good Word for him,
and every Body &s;aid he had the very look of a
Rogue, and would come to be Hang'd: In a
Word he got nothing of any Body for good will,
but was as it were oblig'd to turn Thief, for the
meer Nece&s;&s;ity of Bread to eat; for if he beg'd,
he did it with &s;o ill a Tone, rather like bidding
Folks give him Victuals, than entreating them,
that one Man of whom he had &s;omething given,
and knew him, told him one Day, Capt. <HI>Jack,
&s;ays he,</HI> thou art but an awkward, ugly &s;ort of a
Beggar now thou art a Boy, I doubt thou wilt be
fitter to ask a Man for his Pur&s;e, than for a Penny,
when thou come&s;t to be a Man.</P>
<P>THE Major was a merry Thoughtle&s;s Fellow,
always Chearful, whether he had any Victuals
or no, he never complain'd, and he recommended
him&s;elf &s;o well by his good Carriage that the
Neighbours lov'd him, and he got Victuals enough
one where or other: Thus we all made a &s;hift, tho'
we were &s;o little to keep from &s;tarving, and as for
Lodging, we lay in the Summer-time about the
Watch-hou&s;es, and on Bulk-heads, and Shop|doors,
where we were known; as for a Bed we knew
nothing what belong'd to it for many Years af|ter
my Nur&s;e died, and in Winter we got into the
<PB N="10" REF="16">
A&s;h-holes, and Nealing-Arches in the Gla&s;s-hou&s;e,
call'd <HI>Dallows</HI>'s Gla&s;s-hou&s;e, near <HI>Ro&s;emary-Lane,</HI>
or at another Gla&s;s-hou&s;e in <HI>Ratcliff-high-way.</HI></P>
<P>IN this manner we liv'd for &s;ome Years, and
here we fail'd not to fall among a Gang of naked,
ragged Rogues like our&s;elves, wicked as the De|vil
cou'd de&s;ire to have them be, at &s;o early an
Age, and Ripe for all the other Parts of Michief
that &s;uited them as they advanc'd in Years.</P>
<P>I remember that one cold Winter Night we
were di&s;turb'd in our Re&s;t with a Con&s;table, and
his Watch, crying out for one <HI>Wry-Neck,</HI> who it
&s;eems had done &s;ome Roguery, and requir'd a Hue
and Cry of that Kind, and the Watch were in|form'd
he was to be found among the Beggar-boys
under the Nealing-Arches in the Gla&s;s-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THE alarm being given, we were awaken'd in
the Dead of the Night with <HI>come out here,</HI> ye Crew
of young Devils, come out and &s;how your&s;elves;
&s;o we were all produc'd, &s;ome came out rubbing
their Eyes, and &s;cratching their Heads, and o|thers
were dragg'd out, and I think there was a|bout
Seventeen of us in all, but <HI>Wry-Neck,</HI> as
they call'd him, was not among them; it &s;eems
this was a good big Boy that us'd to be among the
Inhabitants of that Place, and had been concern'd in
a Robbery the Night before, in which his Comrade
who was taken, who in hopes of e&s;caping Puni&s;h|ment
had di&s;cover'd him and inform'd where he
u&s;ually Harbour'd; but he was aware it &s;eems,
and had &s;ecur'd him&s;elf, at lea&s;t for that time; &s;o
we were allow'd to return to our warm Appart|ment
among the Coal-a&s;hes, where I &s;lept many
a cold Winter Night: Nay, I may &s;ay, many a
Winter, as &s;ound, and as comfortably as ever I
did &s;ince, tho' in better Lodging.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17">
IN this manner of living, we went on a good
while, I believe two Year, and neither did, or
meant any Harm: We generally went all Three
together; for in &s;hort, the Captain for want of
Addre&s;s, and for &s;omething di&s;agreeable in him,
would have &s;tarv'd if we had not kept him with
us: As we were always together, we were gene|rally
known by the Name of the three <HI>Jacks;</HI> but
Col. <HI>Jack</HI> had always the preference upon many
Accounts; the Major, as I have &s;aid, was Merry
and Plea&s;ant, but the Colonel always held talk
with the better Sort; I mean, the better Sort of
tho&s;e that would Conver&s;e with a Beggar-boy: In
this way of Talk, I was always upon the Inquiry,
asking Que&s;tions of things done in Publick as well
as in Private, particularly, I lov'd to talk with
Seamen and Soldiers about the War, and about
the great Sea-Fights, or Battles on Shore, that
any of them had been in; and as I never forgot any
thing they told me, I could &s;oon, that is to &s;ay, in
a few Years give almo&s;t as good an Account of the
<HI>Dutch</HI> War, and of the Fights at Sea, the Battles
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the taking of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and the like,
as any of tho&s;e that had been there, and this
made tho&s;e old Soldiers and Tars love to talk with
me too, and to tell me all the Stories they could
think of, and that not only of the Wars then go|ing
on, but al&s;o of the Wars in <HI>Oliver's</HI> time, the
Death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, and the like.</P>
<P>BY this means, as young as I was, I was
a kind of an Hi&s;torian, and tho' I had read
no Books, and never had any Books to read,
yet I cou'd give a tollerable Account of what
had been done, and of what was then a do|ing
in the World, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e things
that our own People were concern'd in. I
<PB N="12" REF="18">
knew the Names of every Ship in the Navy, and
who commanded them too, and all this before I
was 14 Year old, or but very &s;oon after.</P>
<P><HI>Capt.</HI> JACK, in this time fell into bad Compa|ny,
and went away from us, and it was a good
while before we ever heard Tale or Tidings of him,
till about half Year, I think or there abouts, I un|der&s;tood
he was got among a Gang of Kidnappers
as they were then call'd, being a Sort of wicked
Fellows that us'd to Spirit Peoples Children away
that is &s;natch them up in the Dark, and &s;top|ing
their Mouths, carry them to &s;uch Hou&s;e$
where they had Rogues, ready to receive them
and &s;o carry them on Board Ships bound to <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI>
and &s;ell them.</P>
<P>THIS was a Trade that horrid <HI>Jack,</HI> for &s;o I call'd
him, when we were grown up, was very fit for
e&s;pecially the violent Part; for if a little Child
got into his Clutches he would &s;top the Breath of
it, in&s;tead of &s;topping its Mouth, and never
Trouble his Head with the Childs being almo&s;t$
&s;trangl'd, &s;o he did but keep it from making $
Noi&s;e. There was it &s;eems &s;ome Villainous thing
done by this Gang about that time, whether $
Child was murther'd among them, or a Child o$
therwi&s;e abus'd; but it &s;eems it was a Child of a$$|eminent
Citizen, and the Parent &s;ome how or other
got a Scent of the thing, &s;o that they recover'd
their Child, tho' in a &s;ad Condition, and almo&s;t
kill'd; I was too young, and it was too long ag$$
for me to remember the whole Story, but they
were all taken up, and &s;ent to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and Capt$$
<HI>Jack</HI> among the re&s;t, tho' he was but young, for
he was not then much above 13 Year old.</P>
<P>WHAT puni&s;hment was inflicted upon the Ro$$
gues of that Gang I cannot tell now, but the
<PB N="13" REF="19">
Captain being but a lad, was order'd to be three
times &s;oundly Whipt at <HI>Bridewell;</HI> my Lord Mayor,
or the Recorder telling him, it was done in pitty
to him, to keep him from the Gallows, not forget|ting
to tell him that he had a Hanging look, and
bid him have a care on that very Account; &s;o re|markable
was the Captain's Countenance, even
&s;o young, and which he heard of afterwards on
many Occa&s;ions: When he was in <HI>Bridewell,</HI> I
heard of his Misfortune, and the Major and I
went to &s;ee him, for this was the fir&s;t News we
heard of what became of him.</P>
<P>THE very Day that we went, he was call'd out
to be Corrected, <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> according to his
Sentence, and as it was order'd to be done &s;ound|ly,
&s;o indeed they were true to the Sentence, for
the Alderman, who was the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Bridewell,</HI>
and who I think they call'd Sir <HI>William Turner,</HI>
held preaching to him about how young he was,
and what pitty it was &s;uch a Youth &s;hould come
to be hang'd, and a great deal more, how he &s;hould
take warning by it, and how wicked a thing it
was that they &s;hould &s;teal away poor innocent
Children, and the like; and all this while the
Man with a blue Badge on, la&s;h'd him mo&s;t un|mercifully,
for he was not to leave off till Sir
<HI>William</HI> knock'd with a little Hammer on the
Table.</P>
<P>THE poor Captain &s;tamp'd, and danc'd, and
$roar'd out like a mad Boy; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I
was frighted almo&s;t to Death; for tho' I could
not come near enough, being but a poor Boy, to
&s;ee how he was handled, yet I &s;aw him after|wards,
with his Back all wheal'd with the La&s;hes,
and in &s;everal Places bloody, and thought I
&s;hould have died with the Sight of it; but I
<PB N="14" REF="20">
grew better acquainted with tho&s;e Things after|wards.</P>
<P>I DID what I could to comfort the poor
Captain, when I got Leave to come to him.
But the wor&s;t was not over with him, for he
was to have two more &s;uch Whippings be|fore
they had done with him; and indeed they
&s;courg'd him &s;o &s;everely, that they made him Sick
of the Kidnapping Trade for a great while; but
he fell in among them again, and kept among
them as long as that Trade la&s;ted, for it cea&s;ed in
a few Years afterwards.</P>
<P>THE Major, and I, tho' very Young, had &s;en&s;i|ble
Impre&s;&s;ions made upon us, for &s;ome time, by
the &s;evere U&s;age of the Captain, and it might be
very well &s;aid we were corrected as well as he,
tho' not concerned in the Crime: But it was
within the Year, that the Major, a good Condi|tion'd
ea&s;y Boy, was wheedled a way, by a
couple of young Rogues that frequented the
Gla&s;s-hou&s;e Appartments, to take a Walk with
them, as they were plea&s;ed to call it: The Gen|tlemen
were very well match'd, the Major was
about 12 Year old, and the olde&s;t of the Two that
led him out, was not above fourteen; the bu&s;i$$|ne&s;s
was to go to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, and the End
of going to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, was in &s;hort, to
pick Pockets.</P>
<P>THE Major knew nothing of the Trade, and
therefore was to do nothing, but they promi&s;ed
him a Share with them for all that, as if he had
been as expert as them&s;elves; &s;o away they
went. The two dexterous young Rogues manag'd
it &s;o well, that by about 8 a Clock at Night, they
came back to our du&s;ty Quarters at the Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e,
and &s;itting them down in a Corner, they
<PB N="15" REF="21">
began to &s;hare their Spoil, by the Light of the
Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e Fire: The Major lug'd out the
Goods, for as fa&s;t as they any Purcha&s;e,
they unloaded them&s;elves and gave all to him,
that if they had been taken, nothing might be
found about them.</P>
<P>IT was a devili&s;h lucky Day to them, the Devil
certainly a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to find their Prey, that
he might draw in a young Game&s;ter, and encou|rage
him to the Undertaking, who had been made
backward before, by the Misfortune of the Cap|tain.
The Li&s;t of their Purcha&s;e the fir&s;t Night,
was as follows.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>I. A white Handkerchief from a Country
Wench, as &s;he was &s;taring up at a <HI>Jackpud|ding,</HI>
there was 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and a Row of Pins,
tyed up in one End of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. A colour'd Handkerchief, out of a young
Country Fellow's Pocket as he was buying a
<HI>China</HI> Orange.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. A Ribband Pur&s;e with 11 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> and a
Silver Thimble in it, out of a young Wo|man's
Pocket, ju&s;t as a Fellow offer'd to pick
her up.
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> She mi&s;t her Pur&s;e pre&s;ently, but
not &s;eeing the Thief, charg'd the Man
with it, that would have pick'd her up,
and cry'd out a Pick-Pocket, and he
fell into the Hands of the Mobb, but
being known in the Street, he got off
with great Difficulty.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. A Knife and Fork, that a Couple of Boys
had ju&s;t bought, and were going Home with;
the young Rogue that took it, got it within
<PB N="16" REF="22">
the Minute after the Boy had put it in his
Pocket.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. A little Silver Box, with &s;even Shillings
in it, all in &s;mall Silver, 1 <HI>d. 2 d. 3 d. 4 d.</HI>
Peices.
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> This, it &s;eems a Maid pull'd out
of her Pocket, to pay at her going into
the Booth to &s;ee a Show, and the little
Rogue got his Hand in and fetch'd it
off, ju&s;t as &s;he put it up again.</Q></ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. Another Silk Handkerchief, out of a Gen|tleman's
Pocket.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. Another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. A Joynted Baby, and a little Looking
Gla&s;s &s;tolen off a Toy Seller's Stall, in the
Fair.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>ALL this Cargo to be brought Home clear in
one Afternoon, or Evening rather, and by only
two little Rogues, &s;o young, was it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd,
Extraordinary; and the Major was elevated
the next Day to a &s;trange Degree.</P>
<P>HE came very early to me, who lay not far
from him, and &s;aid to me Colonel <HI>Jack,</HI> I want
to &s;peak with you. Well, &s;aid I, what do you
&s;ay? Nay, &s;aid he, it is Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence,
I cannot talk here, &s;o we walk'd out: As &s;oon as
we were come out into a narrow Lane, by the
Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e, look here, &s;ays he, and pulls out
his little Hand almo&s;t full of Money.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;urpriz'd at the Sight, when he puts it
up again, and bringing his Hand out, here &s;ays he,
you &s;hall have &s;ome of it, and gives me a Six-pence,
and a Shillings worth of the &s;mall Silver
Peices. This was very welcome to me, who, as
much as I was of a Gentleman, and as much as I
<PB N="17" REF="23">
thought of my&s;elf upon that Account, never had
a Shilling of Money together before, in all my
Life, not that I could call my own.</P>
<P>I WAS very earne&s;t then to know how he came
by this Wealth, for he had for his Share 7<HI>s.</HI> and
6<HI>d.</HI> in Money, the &s;ilver Thimble and a &s;ilk
Handkercher, which was in &s;hort an E&s;tate to
him, that never had, as I &s;aid of my&s;elf a Shil|ling
together in his Life.</P>
<P>AND what will you do with it now <HI>Jack</HI> &s;aid
I? I do, <HI>&s;ays be,</HI> the fir&s;t thing I do, I'll go into
Rag-Fair, and buy me a pair of Shoes and Stock|ings,
that's right, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and &s;o will I too; &s;o a|way
we went together, and we bought each of us
a pair of Rag-Fair Stockings in the fir&s;t Place for
5<HI>d.</HI> not 5<HI>d.</HI> a Pair, but 5<HI>d.</HI> together, and good
Stockings they were too, much above our wear I
a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>WE found it more difficult to fit our &s;elves with
Shoes, but at la&s;t, having look'd a great while
before we co$'d find any good enough for us, we
found a Shop very well &s;tor'd, and of the&s;e we
bought two Pair for Sixteen-pence.</P>
<P>WE put them on immediately to our great
Comfort, for we had neither of us had any Stock|ings
to our Legs that had any Feet to them for
a long time: I found my&s;elf &s;o refre&s;h'd with
having a Pair of warm Stockings on, and a Pair
of dry Shoes; things, I &s;ay, which I had not been
acquainted with a great while, that I began to
call to mind my being a Gentleman, and now I
thought it began to come to pa&s;s; when we had
thus fitted our&s;elves, I &s;aid, hark ye Major <HI>Jack,</HI>
you and I, never had any Money in our Lives
before, and we never had a good Dinner in all
<PB N="18" REF="24">
our Lives; What if we &s;hould go &s;omewhere and
get &s;ome Victuals, I am very hungry?</P>
<P>So, we will then &s;ays the Major, I am a hun|gry
too; &s;o we went to a boiling Cook's in <HI>Ro&s;e|mary-Lane,</HI>
where we treated our &s;elves Nobly,
and as I thought with my &s;elf we began to live
like Gentlemen, for we had Three-penny-worth
of boil'd Beef, Two-penny-worth of Pudding,
a pennv Brick, (as they call it, or Loaf) and a
whole Pint of &s;trong Beer, which was &s;even Pence
in all.</P>
<Q><P><HI>N. B.</HI> WE had each of us a good me&s;s of charm|ing
Beef Broth into the Bargain; and which
chear'd my Heart wonderfully, all the while
we were at Dinner, the Maid and the Boy in
the Hou&s;e every time they pa&s;s'd by the open
Box where we &s;at at our Dinner, would look
in, and cry, Gentlemen Do ye call? and do
ye call Gentlemen? I &s;ay this was as good
to me as all my Dinner.</P></Q>
<P>NOT the be&s;t Hou&s;e-keeper in <HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h,
not my Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> no, not the great|e&s;t
Man on Earth could be more happy in their
own Imagination, and with le&s;s mixture of Grief,
or Reflexion, than I was at this new Peice of Felici|ty,
tho' mine was but a &s;mall Part of it, for Major
<HI>Jack</HI> had an E&s;tate compar'd to me, as I had an E|&s;tate
compar'd to what I had before: In a Word,
nothing but an utter Ignorance of greater Feli|city,
which was my Ca&s;e, could make any Body
think him&s;elf &s;o exalted as I did, tho' I had no
&s;hare of this Booty but Eighteen-pence.</P>
<P>THAT Night the Major and I triumph'd in our
new Enjoyment, and &s;lept with an undi&s;turb'd
Repo&s;e in the u&s;ual Place, &s;urrounded with the
<PB N="19" REF="25">
warmth of the Gla&s;s-hou&s;e Fires above, which
was a full amends for all the A&s;hes and Cinders
which we roll'd in below.</P>
<P>THOSE who know the Po&s;ition of the Gla&s;s|hou&s;es,
and the Arches where they Neal the Bot|tles
after they are made, know that tho&s;e Places
where the A&s;hes are Ca&s;t, and where the poor Boys
lye, are Caveties in the Brick-work, perfectly
clo&s;e, except at the Entrance, and con&s;equently
warm as the Dre&s;&s;ing-room of a <HI>Bagnio;</HI> that it is
impo&s;&s;ible they can feel any Cold there, were it
in <HI>Greenland,</HI> or <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and that therefore
the Boys lye not only &s;afe, but very comforta|bly,
the A&s;hes excepted, which are no Grievance
at all to them.</P>
<P>THE next Day the Major and his Comrades
went abroad again, and were &s;till Succe&s;sful; nor
did any Di&s;a&s;ter attend them, for I know not
how many Months, and by frequent imitation and
direction, Major <HI>Jack</HI> became as dexterous a Pick|pocket
as any of them, and went on thro' a long
variety of Fortunes, too long to enter upon now,
becau&s;e I am ha&s;tening to my own Story, which at
pre&s;ent is the main thing I have to &s;et down.</P>
<P>THE Major fail'd not to let me &s;ee every Day
the Effects of his new Pro&s;perity, and was &s;o
bountiful, as frequently to throw me a Te&s;ter,
&s;ometimes a Shilling; and I might perceive that
he began to have Cloths on his Back to leave the
A&s;h-hole, having gotten a Society Lodging (of
which I may give an Explanation by it&s;elf on
another Occa&s;ion) and which was more, he took
upon him to wear a Shirt, which was what nei|ther
he, or I had ventur'd to do for three Year
before and upward.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26">
BUT I ob&s;erv'd all this while, that tho' Ma|jor
<HI>Jack</HI> was &s;o Pro&s;perous and had thriven &s;o
well, and notwith&s;tanding he was very kind, and
even generous to me, in giving me Money upon
many Occa&s;ions, yet he never invited me to enter
my&s;elf into the Society, or to embark with him
whereby I might have been made as happy as he,
no, nor did he recommend the Employment to
me at all.</P>
<P>I WAS not very well pleas'd with his being
thus re&s;erv'd to me; I had learn'd from him in Ge|neral,
that the Bu&s;ine&s;s was Picking of Pockets,
and I fancy'd that tho' the Ingenuity of the Trade
con&s;i&s;ted very much in &s;light of Hand, a good A|dre&s;s,
and being very Nimble, yet that it was
not at all difficult to learn; and e&s;pecially I
thought the Opportunities were &s;o many, the
Country People that come to <HI>London,</HI> &s;o fooli&s;h,
&s;o gaping, and &s;o engag'd in looking about them,
that it was a Trade with no great hazard annex'd
to it, and might be ea&s;ily learn'd, if I did but
know in general the Manner of it, and how they
went about it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubtile Devil never ab&s;ent from his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
but ready at all Occa&s;ions to encourage his
Servants, remov'd all the&s;e Difficulties, and
brought me into an Intimacy with one of the
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Divers, or Pick pockets in the
Town; and this our Intima$y was of no le&s;s a Kind,
than that, as I had an Inclination to be as wicked
as any of them, he was for taking Care that I &s;hould
not be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>HE was above the little F$llows, who went a|bout
&s;tealing Trifles, and Baubles in <HI>Bartholo|mew-Fair,</HI>
and run the Ri&s;que of being Mobb'd
for three or four Shillings$ his aim was at
<PB N="21" REF="27">
higher things, even at no le&s;s than con&s;iderable
Sums of Money, and Bills for more.</P>
<P>HE &s;olicited me earne&s;tly to go and take a
Walk with him, as above, adding that after he had
&s;hown me my Trade a little, he would let me be
as wicked as I would, that is, as he expre&s;s'd it, that
after he had made me capable, I &s;hould &s;et up for
my&s;elf if I pleas'd, and he would only wi&s;h me
good Luck.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY as Major <HI>Jack</HI> went with his
Gentleman, only to &s;ee the manner, and receive
the Purcha&s;e, and yet come in for a Share; &s;o he
told me if he had Succe&s;s, I &s;hould have my Share
as much as if I had been Principal; and this he
a&s;&s;ured me was a Cu&s;tom of the Trade, in order
to encourage young Beginners, and bring them
into the Trade with Courage, for that nothing was
to be done if a Man had not the Heart of the Lyon.</P>
<P>I he&s;i&s;tated at the matter a great while, ob|jecting
the Hazard, and telling the Story of Cap|tain
<HI>Jack</HI> my elder Brother, as I might call
him: Well, Colonel, &s;ays he, I find you are
faint Hearted, and to be faint Hearted, is
indeed to be unfit for our Trade, for nothing
but a bold Heart can go Thro'-Stitch with this
Work; but however, as there is nothing for you
to do, &s;o there is nothing for you to run, in
the&s;e things the fir&s;t time, if I am taken &s;ays he,
you having nothing to do in it, they will let you
go free, for it &s;hall ea&s;ily be made appear that
whatever I have done, you had no Hand in it.</P>
<P>UPON tho&s;e per&s;wa&s;ions I ventur'd out with
him; but I &s;oon found that my new Friend was
a Thief of Quality, and a Pick-pocket above the
ordinary Rank, and that aim'd higher abundant|ly
than my Brother <HI>Jack;</HI> he was a bigger Boy
<PB N="22" REF="28">
than I a great deal; for tho' I was now near 15
Year old, I was not big of my Age, and as to the
Nature of the thing, I was perfectly a Stranger to
it; I knew indeed what at fir&s;t I did not, for it was
a good while before I under&s;tood the thing, as an
Offence: I look'd on picking Pockets as a kind of
Trade, and thought I was to go Apprentice to it;
tis true, this was when I was young in the Society,
as well as younger in Years, but even now I un|der&s;tood
it to be only a thing, for which if we were
catch'd, we run the Ri&s;que of being Duck'd or
Pump'd, which we call'd Soaking, and then all
was over; and we made nothing of having our
Raggs wetted a little; but I never under&s;tood,
till a great while after, that the Crime was Capi|tal,
and that we might be &s;ent to <HI>Newgate</HI> for it,
till a great Fellow, almo&s;t a Man, one of our
Society was hang'd for it, and then I was terribly
frighted, as you &s;hall hear by and by.</P>
<P>WELL, upon the per&s;wa&s;ions of this Lad, I
walk'd out with him; a poor innocent Boy, and
(as I remember, my very Thoughts perfectly well)
I had no Evil in my Intentions; I had never &s;to|len
any thing in my Life, and if a Gold&s;mith
had left me in his Shop with heaps of Money,
&s;trew'd all round me, and bad me look after it, I
&s;hould not have touch'd it, I was &s;o hone&s;t; but
the &s;ubtile Tempter, baited his Hook for me, as I
was a Child, in a manner &s;uited to my Childi&s;h|ne&s;s,
for I never took this picking of Pockets to
be di&s;hone&s;ty, but as I have &s;aid above, I look'd
on it as a kind of Trade, that I was to be bred up to,
and &s;o I enter'd upon it, till I became harden'd
in it beyond the Power of retreating; and thus I
was made a Thief involuntarily, and went on a
Length that few Boys do, without coming to
<PB N="23" REF="29">
the common Period of that kind of Life, I mean
to the Tran&s;port Ship, or the Gallows.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Day I went Abroad with my new
In&s;tructor, he carried me directly into the City,
and as we went fir&s;t to the Water&s;ide, he led me
into the long Room at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; we
were but a Couple of ragg'd Boys at be&s;t, but I was
much the wor&s;e, my Leader had a Hat on, a Shirt,
and a Neckcloth; as for me, I had neither of
the three, nor had I &s;poil'd my Manners &s;o much
as to have a Hat on my Head &s;ince my Nur&s;e died,
which was now &s;ome Years; his Orders to me
were to keep always in &s;ight, and near him, but
not clo&s;e to him, nor to take any notice of him
at any time till he came to me; and if any hurly
burly happen'd, I &s;hould by no means know him,
or pretend to have any thing to do with him.</P>
<P>IOBSERV'D my Orders to a tittle, while he
peer'd into every Corner, and had his Eye upon
every Body; I kept my Eye directly upon him,
but went always at a Di&s;tance, and on the other
Side of the long Room, looking as it were for
Pins, and picking them up on the Du&s;t as I cou'd
find them, and then &s;ticking them on my Sleeve,
where I had at la&s;t gotten 40 or 50 good Pins;
but &s;till my Eye was upon my Comrade, who I
ob&s;erv'd was very bu&s;y among the Crowds of
People that &s;tood at the Board, doing bu&s;ine&s;s
with the Officers, who pa&s;s the Entries, and make
the Cocquets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AT length he comes over to me, and &s;tooping
as if he would take up a Pin clo&s;e to me, he put
&s;omething into my Hand and &s;aid, put that up,
and follow me down Stairs quickly; He did not
run, but &s;hu&s;fl'd along a pace thro' the Crowd, and
went down not the great Stairs, which we came in at,
<PB N="24" REF="30">
but a little narrow Stair-Ca&s;e at the other End of
the Long Room; I follow'd, and he found I did,
and &s;o went on, not &s;topping below as I expected,
nor &s;peaking one Word to me, till thro' innumera|ble
narrow Pa&s;&s;ages, Alley's and Dark ways, we
were got up into <HI>Fenchurch-&s;treet,</HI> and thro' <HI>Billi|ter
lane into Leadenball-&s;treet, and from thence into
Leadenball-Market.</HI></P>
<P>IT was not a Meat-Market Day &s;o we had
room to &s;it down upon one of the Butcher's
Stalls, and he bad me Lug out; what he had given
me, was a little Leather Letter Ca&s;e, with a <HI>French</HI>
Almanack &s;tuck in the in&s;ide of it, and a great
many Papers in it of &s;everal kinds.</P>
<P>WE look'd them over, and found there was &s;e|veral
valuable Bills in it, &s;uch as Bills of <HI>Ex|change,</HI>
and other Notes, things I did not under|&s;tand;
but among the re&s;t was a Gold&s;mith's
Note, <HI>as he call'd it,</HI> of one Sir <HI>Stephen Evens</HI> for
300 <HI>l.</HI> payable to the Bearer, and at Demand, be|&s;ides
this there was another Note, for 12<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI>
being a Gold&s;mith's Bill too, but I forget the
Name; there was a Bill or two al&s;o written in
<HI>French,</HI> which neither of us under&s;tood, but which
it &s;eems were things of value, being call'd foreign
Bills accepted.</P>
<P>THE Rogue my Ma&s;ter knew what belong'd to
the Gold&s;mith's Bills well enough, and I ob&s;erv'd
when he read the Bill of Sir <HI>Stephen;</HI> he &s;aid this
is too big for me to meddle with, but when he
came to the Bill, for 12 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> he &s;aid to me, <HI>this
will do, come hither</HI> Jack; &s;o away he runs to <HI>Lom|bard-&s;treet,</HI>
and I after him huddling the other Pa|pers
into the Letter Ca&s;e; as he went along, he en|quir'd
the Name out immediately, and went di|rectly
to the Shop, put on a good grave Counte|nance,
<PB N="25" REF="31">
and had the Money paid him without any
Stop or Que&s;tion ask'd, I &s;tood on the other &s;ide the
Way looking about the Street; as not at all con|cern'd
with any Body that way, but ob&s;erv'd that
when he pre&s;ented the Bill he pull'd out the Let|ter
Ca&s;e, as if he had been a Merchant's Boy,
acquainted with Bu&s;ine&s;s, and had other Bills a|bout
him.</P>
<P>THEY paid him the Money in Gold, and he
made ha&s;t enough in Telling it over, and came
away, pa&s;&s;ing by me, and going into <HI>Three-King-Court,</HI>
on the other Side of the way; then wes
cro&s;s'd back into <HI>Clements-Lane,</HI> made the be&s;t of
our way to <HI>Cole-Harbour,</HI> at the Water-&s;ide, and got
a Sculler for a Penny to carry us over the Water
to St. <HI>Mary Overs</HI> Stairs, where we Landed, and
were &s;afe enough.</P>
<P>HERE he turns to me Col. <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays he, I be|lieve
you are a lucky Boy, this is a good Jobb,
we'll go away to St. <HI>George's</HI> Fields, and Share
our Booty; away we went to the Fields, and &s;it|ing
down in the Gra&s;s far enough out of the
Path, he pull'd out the Money, look here <HI>Jack,</HI>
&s;ays he, did you ever &s;ee the like before in
your Life? no, never &s;ays I, and added very inno|cently,
<HI>mu&s;t we have it all?</HI> we have it! lays he,
who &s;hould have it? Why &s;ays I, mu&s;t the Man
have none of it again that lo&s;t it; he have
it again! &s;ays he, what d'ye mean by that; Nay,
I don't know, &s;ays I, why you &s;aid ju&s;t now you
would let him have the tother Bill again, that
you &s;aid was too big for you.</P>
<P>HE Laught at me, you are but a little Boy
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that's true, but I thought you had not
been &s;uch a Child neither; &s;o he mighty gravely
Explain'd the thing to me thus: That the Bill of
<PB N="26" REF="32">
Sir <HI>Stephen Evans</HI> was a great Bill for 300<HI>l.</HI> and if
<HI>I, &s;ays be,</HI> that am but a poor Lad &s;hould venture
to go for the Money, they will pre&s;ently &s;ay,
how &s;hould I come by &s;uch a Bill, and that I cer|tainly
found it or &s;tole it, &s;o they will &s;top me
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and take it away from me, and it may be
bring me into Trouble for it too; &s;o, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I
did &s;ay it was too big for me to meddle with, and
that I would let the Man have it again if I could
tell how; but for the Money <HI>Jack,</HI> the Money
that we have got, I warrant you he &s;hould have
none of that; be&s;ides <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> who ever he be that
has lo&s;t this Letter Ca&s;e, to be &s;ure, as &s;oon as he
mi&s;s'd it, he would run to a <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> and give
notice, that if any body came for the Money, they
&s;hould be &s;topp'd, but I am too Old for him there
<HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>WHY <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and what will you do with the
Bill, Will you thro' it away? if you do, &s;omebo|dy
el&s;e will find it <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and they will go and
take the Money: No, no, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> then they will
be Stopp'd and Examin'd, as I tell you, I &s;hould
be: I did not know well what all this meant, &s;o
I talk'd no more about that; but we fell to hand|ling
the Money, as for me, I had never &s;een &s;o
much together in all my Life, nor did I know
what in the World to do with it, and once or twice
I was a going to bid him keep it for me, which
wou'd have been done like a Child indeed, for to
be &s;ure, I had never heard a word more of it, tho'
nothing had befallen him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as I happen'd to hold my Tongue
as to that part, he &s;har'd the Money very hone&s;t|ly
with me, only at the end he told me, that tho'
it was true, he promis'd me half, yet as it was the
fir&s;t time, and I had done nothing but look on, &s;o
<PB N="27" REF="33">
he thought it was very well if I took a little
le&s;s than he did; &s;o he divided the Money, which
was 12 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI> into two exact Parts (<HI>viz.) 6 l. 5 s.</HI>
in each Part, then he took 1 <HI>l. 5 s.</HI> from my Part,
and told me I &s;hould give him that for Hand&s;el,
Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> take it then, for I think you
de&s;erve it all; &s;o however, I took up the re&s;t, and
what &s;hall I do with this now, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> for I have
no where to put it? why have you no Pockets?
<HI>&s;ays he, yes &s;ays I,</HI> but they are full of Holes; I have
often thought &s;ince that, and with &s;ome Mirth
too, how I had really more Wealth than I knew
what to do with, for Lodging I had none, nor
any Box or Drawer to hide my Money in, nor
had I any Pocket, but &s;uch, <HI>as I &s;ay,</HI> was full of
Holes; I knew no Body in the World, that I
cou'd go and de&s;ire them to lay it up for me; for
being a poor nak'd, ragg'd Boy, they would pre|&s;ently
&s;ay, I had robb'd &s;ome Body, and perhaps
$ay hold of me, and my Money would be my
Crime, <HI>as they &s;ay,</HI> it often is in foregin Coun|tries
And now as I was full of Wealth, behold! I
was full of Care, for what to do to &s;ecure my Mo|ney
I could not tell, and this held me &s;o long,
and was &s;o Vexatious to me the next Day, that I
truly &s;at down and cryed.</P>
<P>NOTHING cou'd be more perplexing than
this Money was to me all that Night, I car|ried
it in my Hand a good while, for it was in
Gold all but 14 <HI>s.</HI> and that is to &s;ay, it was in four
Guineas, and that 14 <HI>s.</HI> was more difficult to carry
then the four Guineas; at la&s;t I&s;at down and pull'd
off one of my Shoes, and put the four Guineas into
that, but after I had gone a while, my Shoe hurt
me &s;o, I could not go, &s;o I was fain to &s;it down
again, and take it out of my Shoe, and car|ry
<PB N="28" REF="34">
it in my Hand, then I found a dirty Linnen
Rag in the Street, and I took that up, and wrapt
it all together, and carried it in that, a good way.
I have often &s;ince heard People, &s;ay when they have
been talking of Money, that they cou'd not get
in, I wi&s;h I had it in a foul Clout: In truth I had
mine in a <HI>foul Clout,</HI> for it was foul according to
the Letter of that &s;aying, but it &s;erv'd me till I
came to a convenient Place, and then I &s;at down
and wa&s;h'd the Cloth in the Kennel, and &s;o
then put my Money in again.</P>
<P>WELL, I carried it home with me to my Lodg|ing
in the Gla&s;s-hou&s;e, and when I went to go to
Sleep, I, knew not what to do with it; if I had let
any of the black Crew I was with, know of it, I
&s;hould have been &s;mother'd in the A&s;hes for it,
or robb'd of it, or &s;ome Trick or other put upon
me for it; or I knew not what to do, but lay with
it in my Hand, and my Hand in my Bo&s;om, but
then Sleep went from Eyes: O! the weight of
Human Care! I a poor Beggar Boy could not
Sleep as &s;oon as I had but a little Money to
keep, who before that, cou'd have &s;lept upon a
heap of Brick-bats, or Stones, Cinders, or any
where, as found as a rich Man does on his down
Bed, and &s;ounder too.</P>
<P>EVERY now and then dropping a &s;leep, I
&s;hould Dream that my Money was lo&s;t, and &s;tart
like one frighted; then finding it fa&s;t in my Hand,
try to go to &s;leep again, but could not for a long
while, then drop and &s;tart again; at la&s;t a Fancy
came into my Head, that if I fell a &s;leep, I &s;hould
Dream of the Money, and Talk of it in my
&s;leep, and tell that I had Money, which if I &s;hould
do, and one of the Rogues &s;hould hear me, they
would pick it out of my Bo&s;om, and of my hand
<PB N="29" REF="35">
too without waking me, and after that Thought
I could not &s;leep a wink more; &s;o that I pa&s;s'd
that Night over in Care and Anxiety enough, and
this may &s;afely &s;ay, was the fir&s;t Nights re&s;t that
I lo&s;t by the Cares of this Life, and the deceitful|ne&s;s
of Riches.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was Day, I got out of the Hole
we lay in, and rambled abroad into the Fields,
towards <HI>Stepney,</HI> and there I mus'd and con&s;ider'd
what I &s;hould do with this Money, and many a
time I wi&s;h'd that I had not had it, for after all
my ruminating upon it, and what Cour&s;e I &s;hould
take with it, or where I &s;hould put it, I could
not hit upon any one thing, or any po&s;&s;ible Method
to &s;ecure it, and it perplex'd me &s;o, that at la&s;t,
as I &s;aid ju&s;t now, I &s;at down and cryed heartily.</P>
<P>WHEN my crying was over, the Ca&s;e was the
&s;ame; I had the Money &s;till, and what to do with
it I could not tell, at la&s;t it came into my
Head, that I would look out for &s;ome Hole
in a Tree, and &s;ee to hide it there, till
I &s;hould have occa&s;ion for it: Big with this
di&s;covery, as I then thought it, I began to look
about me for a Tree; but there were no Trees in
the Fields about <HI>Stepney,</HI> or <HI>Mile-End</HI> that look'd
fit for my purpo&s;e, and if there were any that I
began to look narrowly at, the Fields were &s;o full
of People, that they would &s;ee if I went to hide any
thing there, and I thought the People Eyed me
as it was, and that two Men in particular follow'd
me, to &s;ee what I intended to do.</P>
<P>THIS drove me farther off, and I cro&s;s'd the
Road at <HI>Mile-End,</HI> and in the middle of the
Town went down a Lane that goes away to the
<HI>Blind Beggars</HI> at <HI>Bedual-Green;</HI> when I came a lit|tle
way in the Lane, I found a Foot-Path over
<PB N="30" REF="36">
the Fields, and in tho&s;e Fields &s;everal Trees for
my Turn, as I thought; at la&s;t one Tree had
a little Hole in it, pritty high out of my Reach,
and I climb'd up the Tree to get to it, and when
I came there, I put my Hand in, and found, (as
I thought) a Place very fit, &s;o I placed my Trea|&s;ure
there, and was mighty well &s;atisfy'd with it;
but behold, putting my Hand in again to lay it
more commodiou&s;ly, as I thought, of a Suddain
it &s;lipp'd away from me, and I found the Tree was
hollow, and my little Parcel was fallen in quite
out of my Reach, and how far it might go in, I
knew not; &s;o, that in a Word, my Money was
quite gone, irrecoverably lo&s;t, there could be no
Room, &s;o much as to Hope ever to &s;ee it again
for it was a va&s;t great Tree.</P>
<P>As young as I was, I was now &s;en&s;ible what a
Fool I was before, that I could not think of Ways
to keep my Money, but I mu&s;t come thus far to
throw it into a Hole where I could not reach it;
well, I thru&s;t my Hand quite up to my Elbow,
but no Bottom was to be found, or any End of
the Hole or Cavity; I got a Stick off of the Tree
and thru&s;t it in a great Way, but all was one;
then I cry'd, nay, I roar'd out, I was in &s;uch a
Pa&s;&s;ion, then I got down the Tree again, then up
again, and thru&s;t in my Hand again till I &s;cratch'd
my Arm and made it bleed, and cry'd all the
while mo&s;t violently: Then I began to think I
had not &s;o much as a half Penny of it left for a
half Penny Roll, and I was a hungry, and then I
cry'd again: Then I came away in di&s;pair, cry|ing,
and roaring like a little Boy that had been
whip'd, then I went back again to the Tree,
and up the Tree again, and thus I did &s;everal
Times.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="37">
THE la&s;t time I had gotten up the Tree, I
happen'd to come down not on the &s;ame Side that
I went up and came down before, but on the
other &s;ide of the Tree, and on the other Side of
the Bank al&s;o; and behold the Tree had a great
open Place in the Side of it clo&s;e to the Ground,
as old hollow Trees often have; and looking into
the open Place, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy, there
lay my Money, and my Linnen Rag, all rap'd
up ju&s;t as I had put it into the Hole: For the
Tree being hollow all the Way up, there had been
&s;ome Mo&s;s or light Stuff, which I had not
Judgement enough to know was not firm,
and had given way when it came to drop out of
my Hand, and &s;o it had &s;lip'd quite down at
once.</P>
<P>I WAS but a Child, and I rejoyced like a Child,
for I hollow'd quit out aloud, when I &s;aw it; then
I run to it, and &s;natch'd it up, hug'd and ki&s;s'd the
dirty Ragg a hundred Times; then danc'd and
jump'd about, run from on End of the Field to the
other, and in &s;hort, I knew not what, much le&s;s
do I know now what I did, tho' I &s;hall never
forget the Thing, either what a &s;inking Grief it
was to my Heart when I thought I had lo&s;t it,
or what a Flood of Joy o$er whelm'd me when I
had got it again.</P>
<P>WHILE I was in the fir&s;t Tran&s;port of my
Joy, as I have &s;aid, I run about and knew not
what I did; but when that was over, I &s;at down,
open'd the foul Clout the Money was in, look'd
at it, told it, found it was all there, and then I
fell a crying as &s;avourly as I did before, when I
thought I had lo&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="38">
IT would tire the Reader &s;hould I dwell on all
the little Boyi&s;h Tricks that I play'd in the Exta|cy
of my Joy, and Satisfaction, when I had found
my Money; &s;o I break off here: Joy is as Ex|travagant
as Grief, and &s;ince I have been a Man, I
have often thought, that had &s;uch a Thing befal|len
a Man, &s;o to have lo&s;t all he had, and not have
a bit of Bread to Eat, and then &s;o &s;trangely to
find it again, after having given it &s;o effectually
over. <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> had it been &s;o with a Man, it might
have hazarded, his u&s;ing &s;ome Violence upon him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>WELL,
I came away with my Money, and
having taken Six-pence out of it, before I made it
up again, I went to a Chandler's Shop in <HI>Mile|End,</HI>
and bought a Half-Penny Roll, and a Half
Pennyworth of Chee&s;e, and &s;at down at the Door
after I bought it, and eat it very heartily, and
begg'd &s;ome Beer to Drink with it, which the good
Woman gave me very freely.</P>
<P>AWAY I went then for the Town to &s;ee if I
could find any of my Companions, and re&s;olv'd
I would try no more hollow Trees for my Trea|&s;ure;
as I came along <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> I came by
a Broker's Shop, over again&s;t the Church, where
they &s;old old Cloaths, for I had nothing on but
the wor&s;t of Rags; &s;o I &s;topp'd at the Shop, and
&s;tood looking at the Cloaths which hang'd at the
Door.</P>
<P>WELL, young Gentleman, &s;ays a Man that
&s;tood at the Door, you look wi&s;hly, do you
&s;ee any thing you like, and will your Pocket

Pockets, and was as pleas'd as a Prince is with his
Coach and &s;ix Hor&s;es; I thank'd the good Wo|man
too for the Hat, and told her I would come
again when I got more Money, and buy &s;ome o|ther
things I wanted, and &s;o I came away.</P>
<P>I WAS but a Boy 'tis true, but I thought my
&s;elf a Man now I had got a Pocket to put my Mo|ney
in, and I went directly to find out my Com|panion,
by who&s;e means I got it; but I was fright|ed
out of my Wits when I heard that he was car|ried
to <HI>Bridewell;</HI> I made no Que&s;tion but it was
for the Letter Ca&s;e, and that I &s;hould be carried
there too, and then my poor Brother Captain <HI>Jack's</HI>
Ca&s;e came into my Head, and that I &s;hould be
Whip'd there as cruelly as he was, and I was in
&s;uch a fright that I knew not what to do.</P>
<P>BUT in the Afternoon I met him, he had
been carried to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> it &s;eems upon that very
Affair, but was got out again: The Ca&s;e was thus,
having had &s;uch good Luck at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e
the Day before, he takes his Walk thither again,
and as he was in the long Room, gaping and &s;taring
about him, a Fellow $ays hold of him, and calls
to one of the Clerks, that &s;at behind, <HI>here,</HI> &s;ays
<PB N="35" REF="41">
he, <HI>is the &s;ame young Rogue, that I told you I &s;aw
Loitering about t'other Day when the Gentleman lo&s;t
his Letter Ca&s;e, and his Gold&s;mith's Bills; I dare &s;ay
it was he that &s;tole them;</HI> immediately the whole
Crowd of People gather'd about the Boy, and
Charg'd him point Blank; but he was too well
us'd to &s;uch things to be frighted into a Confe&s;&s;i|on
of what he knew they could not prove, for
he had nothing about him belonging to it, not
had any Money, but Six-pence and a few dirty
Farthings.</P>
<P>THEY threatened him, and pull'd, and hall'd
him, till they almo&s;t pull'd the Cloths off of his
Back, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners examin'd him; but all
was one, he would own nothing, but <HI>&s;aid, he</HI> walk'd
up thro' the Room only to &s;ee the Place both then,
and the time before, for he had own'd he was
there before; &s;o as there was no proof again&s;t
him of any Fact, no, nor of any Circum&s;tances
relating to the Letter Ca&s;e, they were forc'd
at la&s;t to let him go; however, they made a &s;how
of carrying him to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and they did carry
him to the Gate, to &s;ee if they could make him
confe&s;s any thing; but he would confe&s;s nothing,
and they had no <HI>Mittimus;</HI> &s;o they dur&s;t not car|ry
him into the Hou&s;e, nor would the People
have receiv'd him I &s;uppo&s;e, if they had, they
having no Warrant for putting him in Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>WELL, when they could get nothing out of him
they carry'd him into an Ale-hou&s;e, and there they
told him, that the Letter Ca&s;e had Bills in it of a
very great Value, that they would be of no u&s;e to
the Rogue that had them, but they would be of infi|nite
Damage to the Gentleman, that had lo&s;t them,
and that he had left word with the Clerk, who the
Man that &s;top'd this Boy had call'd to, and who
<PB N="36" REF="42">
was there with him, that he would give 30 <HI>l.</HI> to
any one that would bring them again, and give
all the Security that could be de&s;ir'd that he would
give them no Trouble, whoever it was.</P>
<P>HE was ju&s;t come from out of their Hands, when
Imet with him, and &s;o he told me all the Story;
<HI>but,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I would confe&s;s nothing, and &s;o I got
off and am come away clear.</HI> Well, &s;ays I, <HI>and what
will you do with the Letter Ca&s;e, and the Bills, will
not you let the poor Man have his Bills again?</HI> No,
not, I, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I won't tru&s;t them, what care I
for their Bills; It came into my Head, as young
as I was, that it was a &s;ad thing indeed to take
a Man's Bills away for &s;o much Money, and not
have any Advantage by it neither; for I conclud|ed
that the Gentleman, who own'd the Bills mu&s;t
loo&s;e all the Money, and it was &s;trange he &s;hould
keep the Bills, and make a Gentleman loo&s;e &s;o
much Money for nothing: I remember that I ru|minated
very much about it, and tho' I did not un|der&s;tand
it very well, yet it lay upon my Mind,
and I &s;aid every now and then to him, do, let the
Gentleman have his Bills again, do, pray do, and
&s;o I Teiz'd him, with do, and pray do, till at la&s;t
I cry'd about them; he &s;aid, what would you have
me be found out and &s;ent to <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and be
Whip'd as your Brother Captain <HI>Jack</HI> was, I &s;aid
no I wou$d not have you Whipt, but I would
have the Man have his Bills, for they will do you
no good, but the Gentleman will be undone it
may be; <HI>and then, I added again,</HI> do, let him have
them; he &s;napt me &s;hort, <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>how &s;hall
I get them to him? who dare carry them? I dare not
to be &s;ure, for they will &s;t$p me, and bring the</HI> Gold|&s;mith
<HI>to &s;ee if he does not know me, and that I receiv|ed
the Money, and &s;o they will prove the Robbery, and
I &s;hall be hang'd, would you have me be hang'd</HI> Jack?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="43">
I WAS &s;ilenc'd a good while with that, for
when he &s;aid, would you have me be hang'd <HI>Jack?</HI>
I had no more to &s;ay; but one Day after this,
he call'd to me, Colonel <HI>Jack, &s;aid he,</HI> I have
thought of a way how the Gentleman &s;hall have
his Bills again, and you and I &s;hall get a good
deal of Money by it, if you will be hone&s;t to
me, as I was to you; indeed, <HI>&s;ays I</HI> ROBIN,
that was his Name, I will be very hone&s;t, let me
know how it is, for I would fain have him have
his Bills.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> they told me that he had left word
at the Clerk's Place in the Long Room, that he
would give 30 <HI>l.</HI> to any one that had the Bills, and
would re&s;tore them, and would ask no Que&s;tions.
Now if you will go, like a poor innocent Boy as
you are, into the Long Room, and &s;peak to the
Clerk, it may do; tell him, if the Gentleman
will do as he promis'd, you believe you can tell
him who has it, and if they are civil to you, and
willing to be as good as their Words, you &s;hall
have the Letter Ca&s;e, and give it them.</P>
<P>I TOLD him aye, I would go with all my
Heart; but Colonel <HI>Jack, &s;ays he,</HI> what if they
&s;hould take hold of you, and threaten to have
you whip'd, won't you di&s;cover me to them; no,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> if they would whip me to Death I won't;
well then, &s;ays he, <HI>there's the Letter Ca&s;e, do you
go;</HI> &s;o he gave me Directions how to act, and
what to &s;ay, but I would not take the Letter Ca&s;e
with me, lea&s;t they &s;hould prove fal&s;e, and take
hold of me, thinking to find it upon me, and &s;o
Charge me with the Fact; &s;o I left it with
him; and the next Morning I went to the
Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, as was agreed, what my Directi|ons
were, will to avoid Repetition, appear in
<PB N="38" REF="44">
what happen'd; It was an Errand of foo much
Con&s;equence indeed to be entru&s;ted to a Boy, not
only &s;o young as I was, but &s;o little of a Rogue
as I was yet arriv'd to the Degree of.</P>
<P>TWO things I was particularly arm'd with,
which I re&s;olv'd upon. (1.) That the Man &s;hould
have his Bills again; for it &s;eem'd a horrible
thing to me that he &s;hould be made to lo&s;e his
Money, which I &s;uppos'd he mu&s;t, purely becau&s;e
we would not carry the Letter Ca&s;e home. (2.)
That whatever happen'd to me, I was never to tell
the Name of my Comrade <HI>Robin,</HI> who had been
the Principal: With the&s;e two Peices of hone&s;ty,
for &s;uch they were both in them&s;elves, and with a
manly Heart, tho' a Boy's Head, I went up into
the Long Room in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e the next
Day.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came to the Place, where the thing
was done, I &s;aw the Man &s;it ju&s;t where he had &s;at
before, and it run in my Head, that he had &s;at
there ever &s;ince; but I knew no better; &s;o I went
up and &s;tood ju&s;t at that Side of the writing Board,
that goes up on that Side of the Room, and
which I was but ju&s;t Tall enough to lay my Arms
upon.</P>
<P>WHILE I &s;tood there, one thru&s;t me this way,
and another thru&s;t me that way, and the Man that
&s;at behind began to look at me; at la&s;t he call'd
out to me; what does that Boy do there, get you
gone Sirrah, are you one of the Rogues that &s;tole
the Gentleman's Letter Ca&s;e a <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t? Then
he turns his Tale to a Gentleman that was do|ing
Bu&s;ine&s;s with him, and goes on thus; here was
Mr.&mdash;had a very unlucky Chance on <HI>Mon|day</HI>
la&s;t, did not you hear of it; no, not I, <HI>&s;ays the
Gentleman,</HI> Why? &s;tanding ju&s;t there, where you
<PB N="39" REF="45">
do, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> making his Entries, he pull'd out his
Letter Ca&s;e, and laid it down, as <HI>he &s;ays,</HI> but ju&s;t
at this Hand, while he reach'd over to the Standi&s;h
there for a Penful of Ink, and &s;ome Body &s;tole
away his Letter Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS Letter Ca&s;e! <HI>&s;ays 'tother,</HI> What? and was
there any Bills in it?</P>
<P>AY, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> there was Sir <HI>Stephen Evans</HI>'s Note
in it for 300 <HI>l.</HI> and another Gold&s;mith's Bill, for
about 12 <HI>l.</HI> and which is wor&s;e &s;till for the Genle|man,
he had two Foreign accepted Bills in it
for a great Sum, I know not how much, I think
one was a <HI>French</HI> Bill for 1200 Crowns.</P>
<P>AND who cou'd it be? <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>NO BODY knows, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but one of our Room|Keepers
<HI>&s;ays,</HI> he &s;aw a Couple of young Rogues
like that, <HI>pointing at me,</HI> hanging about here,
and that on a &s;udden they were both gone.</P>
<P>VILLIANS! <HI>&s;ays he</HI> again, Why? what can
they do with them, they will be of no u&s;e to
them; I &s;uppo&s;e he went immediately, and gave
notice to prevent the Payment.</P>
<P>YES, <HI>&s;ays the Clerk,</HI> he did; but the Rogues
were to nimble for him with the little Bill of 12 <HI>l.</HI>
odd Money, they went and got the Money for
that, but all the re&s;t are &s;topp'd, however, 'tis
an un&s;peakable Damage to him for want of his
Money.</P>
<P>WHY, he &s;hould publi&s;h a Reward for the En|couragement
of tho&s;e that have them to bring
them again, they would be glad to bring them
I warrant you.</P>
<P>HE has po&s;ted it up at the Door, that he will
give 30 <HI>l.</HI> for them.</P>
<P>AYE, but he &s;hould add, that he will promi&s;e,
<PB N="40" REF="46">
not to &s;top, or give any Trouble to the Per&s;on
that brings them.</P>
<P>HE has done that too, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but I fear they
won't tru&s;t them&s;elves to be Hone&s;t, for fear he
&s;hould break his Word.</P>
<P>Why? it is true he may break his Word in that
Ca&s;e, but no Man &s;hould do &s;o; for then, no
Rogue will venture to bring home any thing that
is &s;tolen, and &s;o he would do an Injury to others
after him.</P>
<P>I DURST pawn my Life for him, he would
&s;corn it.</P>
<P>THUS far they Di&s;cours'd of it, and then went
off to &s;omething el&s;e; I heard it all, but did not
know what to do a great while; but at la&s;t, watch|ing
the Gentleman that went away, when he was
gone, I run after him, to have &s;poken to him, in|tending
to have broke it to him, but he went
ha&s;tily into a Room or Two, full of People, at
the hither End of the Long Room, and when I
went to follow, the Door-keepers turn'd me Back,
and told me I mu&s;t not go in there; &s;o I went Back,
and loyter'd about, near the Man that &s;at behind
the Board, and hung about there, 'till I found the
Clock &s;truck Twelve, and the Room began to be
thin of People; and at la&s;t he &s;at there Writing,
but no Body &s;tood at the Board before him, as
there had all the re&s;t of the Morning, then I came
a little nearer, and &s;tood clo&s;e to the Board, as I
did before, when looking up from his Paper, and
&s;eeingme, <HI>&s;ays he to me,</HI> you have been up and
down there all this Morning, Sarrah, What do
you want? You have &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s that is not
very good, I doubt?</P>
<P>No, I han't, &s;aid $.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="47">
No, 'tis well if you han't, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Pray what

<P>I would &s;peak with you, <HI>&s;aid I</HI></P>
<P>With me, <HI>&s;aye he,</HI> What have you to &s;ay to
me?</P>
<P>I have &s;omething to &s;ay, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if you will
do me no Harm for it.</P>
<P>I do thee Harm Child, What Harm &s;hould I
do thee? and &s;poke very kindly.</P>
<P>Won't you indeed Sir, <HI>&s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P>No, not I Child! I'll do thee no Harm; what
is it? do you know any Thing of the Gentle|man's
Letter Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd, but &s;poke &s;oftly, that he could not
hear me, &s;o he gets over pre&s;ently, into the Seat
next him, and opens a Place that was made to
come out, and bad me come in to him; and I
did.</P>
<P>Then he ask'd me again, if I knew any thing
of the Letter-Ca&s;e</P>
<P>I &s;poke &s;oftly again, and &s;aid, Folks would
hear him.</P>
<P>Then he whi&s;per'd &s;oftly, and ask'd me again$</P>
<P>I told him, I believ'd I did; but that, indeed,
I had it not, nor had no Hand in &s;tealing it, but
it was goten into the Hands of a Boy, that would
have burnt it, if it had not been for me; and
that I heard him &s;ay, that the Gentleman would
be glad to have them again, and give a good deal
of Money for them.</P>
<P>I did &s;ay &s;o Child, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> and if you can get
them for him, he &s;hall give you a good Reward,
no le&s;s than 30 <HI>l.</HI> as he has Promis'd.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="48">
But you &s;aid too Sir, to the Gentleman, ju&s;t

there at five a Clock at Night, which accord|ingly
I did, and carry'd the Letter-Ca&s;e with

<P>Becau&s;e, I heard the Boy, that I believe &s;tole

<P>This made him laugh; what, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> had you
ne'er a Mother, what then?</P>
<P>I had a Nur&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but &s;he was not my Mo|ther.</P>
<P>Well,
<HI>&s;ays he to the Gentleman,</HI> I dare &s;ay, this
Boy was not the Thief that &s;tole your Bills.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I did not &s;teal them, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and
Cry'd again.</P>
<P>No, no, Child, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we don't believe you
did.</P>
<P>THIS is a cleaver Boy, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to the other
Gentleman, and yet very Ignorant and Hone&s;t,
'tis pity &s;ome Care &s;hould not be taken of him,
and &s;omething done for him; let us Talk a little
more with him; &s;o they &s;at down and drank
Wine, and gave me &s;ome, and then the fir&s;t Gen|tleman
talk'd to me again.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> What wil't thou do with this
Money now thou ha&s;t it?</P>
<P>I don't know, <HI>&s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P>Where will you put it? <HI>&s;aid he.</HI></P>
<P>In my Pocket, <HI>&s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P>In your Pocket, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> is your Pocket whole?
&s;han't you lo&s;e it?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> my Pocket is whole.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="52">
And where will you put it, when you come
Home?</P>
<P>I have no Home, <HI>&s;aid I, and cry'd</HI> again.</P>
<P>Poor Child! <HI>&s;aid he then,</HI> What doe&s;t thou do
for thy Living?</P>
<P>I go of Errands, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> for the Folks in <HI>Ro&s;e|mary-lane.</HI></P>
<P>And what do&s;t thou do for a Lodging at Night?</P>
<P>I lye at the Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> at Night.</P>
<P>How lye at the Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e! have they any
Beds there? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>I never lay in a Bed in my Life, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> as I
remember.</P>
<P>Why? <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> what do you lye on at the Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e?</P>
<P>The Ground, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and &s;ometimes a little
Straw, or upon the warm A&s;hes.</P>
<P>Here the Gentleman, that lo&s;t the Bills, <HI>&s;aid,</HI> this
poor Child is enough to make a Man Weep for the
Mi&s;eries of humane Nature, and be thankful for
him&s;elf, he puts Tears into my Eyes; and into
mine too, <HI>&s;ays the other.</HI></P>
<P>Well, but <HI>Hark ye</HI> Jack? <HI>&s;ays the fir&s;t Gentle|man,</HI>
do they give you no Money, when they
&s;end you of Errands?</P>
<P>They give me Victuals, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and that's better.</P>
<P>But what, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> do you do for Cloths?</P>
<P>They give me &s;ometimes old things, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> &s;uch
as they have to &s;pare.</P>
<P>Why? you have ne're a Shirt on I believe,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> have you?</P>
<P>No, I never had a Shirt, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> &s;ince my Nur&s;e
dyed.</P>
<P>How long ago is that? <HI>&s;aid he.</HI></P>
<P>Six Winters, when this is out, <HI>&s;aid I.</HI></P>
<P>Why, how Old are you? <HI>&s;aid he.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53">
I can't tell, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays the Gentleman,</HI> now you have this
Money, won't you buy &s;ome Cloths, and a Shirt
with &s;ome of it.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I would buy &s;ome Cloths.</P>
<P>And, what will you do with the re&s;t?</P>
<P>I can't tell, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and cry'd.</P>
<P>What doe&s;t cry for <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;aid he.</P>
<P>I am afraid, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and cryed &s;till.</P>
<P>What art afraid of.</P>
<P>They will know I have Money.</P>
<P>Well, and what then.</P>
<P>Then I mu&s;t &s;leep no more in the warm Gla&s;s-hou&s;e,
and I &s;hall be &s;tarv'd with cold.</P>
<P>They will take away my Money.</P>
<P>But why mu&s;t you &s;leep there no more?</P>
<P>Here the Gentlemen ob&s;erv'd to one another,
how naturally Anxiety and Perplexity attends
tho&s;e that have Money; I warrant you, <HI>&s;ays the
Clerk,</HI> when this poor Boy had no Money, he &s;lept
all Night in the Straw or on the warm A&s;hes in the
Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e, as &s;oundly and as void of Care as it
would be po&s;&s;ible for any Creature to do; But now as
&s;oon as he has gotten Money, the Care of pre&s;erving
it brings Tears into his Eyes, and Fear into his Heart.</P>
<P>THEY ask'd me a great many Que&s;tions more,
to which I an&s;wer'd in my Childi&s;h way as well
as I could, but &s;o as pleas'd them well enough;
at la&s;t I was going away with a heavy Pocket,
and I a&s;&s;ure you not a light Heart, for I was &s;o
frighted with having &s;o much Money, that knew
not what in the Earth to do with my &s;elf: I went
away however, and walk'd a little way, but I
could not tell what to do; &s;o after rambling
two Hours or thereabout, I went back again,
and &s;atd own at the Gentleman's Door, and there
<PB N="48" REF="54">
I cry'd as long as I had any Moi&s;ture in my Head
to make Tears of, but never knock'd at the Door.</P>
<P>I had not &s;at long, I &s;uppo&s;e, but &s;ome body
belonging to the Family got knowledge of it,
and a Maid came and talked to me, but I &s;aid
little to her, only cry'd &s;till, at length it came
to the Gentleman's Ears; as for the Merchant he
was gone; when the Gentleman heard of me, he
call'd me in, and began to talk with me again,
and ask'd me what I &s;taid for.</P>
<P>I told him I had not &s;taid there all that while,
for I had been gone a great while, and was come
again.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but what did you come again for?</P>
<P>I can't tell, <HI>&s;ays I.</HI></P>
<P>And what do you cry &s;o for, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I hope
you have not lo&s;t your Money, have you?</P>
<P>No, I told him I had not lo&s;t it yet, but I was
afraid I &s;hould.</P>
<P>And does that make you cry? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>I told him <HI>yes,</HI> for I knew I &s;hould not be able
to keep it, but <HI>they</HI> would Cheat me of it, or <HI>they</HI>
would Kill me, and take it away from me too.</P>
<P><HI>They,</HI> &s;ays he, Who? what &s;ort of Gangs of
People art thou with?</P>
<P>I told him they were all Boys, but very wick|ed
Boys, Thieves and Pick-Pockets, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> &s;uch
as &s;tole this Letter Ca&s;e, a &s;ad Pack, I can't a|bide
'em.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;aid he, what &s;hall be done for
&s;hee? will you leave it with me, &s;hall I keep it
for you?</P>
<P><HI>Yes,</HI> &s;aid I, with all my Heart, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Come then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> give it me, and that you
may be &s;ure I have it, and you &s;hall have it ho|ne&s;tly
again, I'll give you a Bill for it,
<PB N="49" REF="55">
and for the Intere&s;t of it, and that you may keep
&s;afe enough; <HI>nay,</HI> added he, and if you lo&s;e it or
any Body takes it from you, none &s;hall receive
the Money but your &s;elf, or any part of it.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ently pull'd out all the Money, and
gave it to him, only keeping about Fifteen Shil|lings
for my&s;elf to buy me &s;ome Cloaths, and
thus ended the Conference between us on the fir&s;t
occa&s;ion, at lea&s;t for the fir&s;t time: Having thus
&s;ecured my Money to my full Satisfaction, I was
then perfectly ea&s;ie, and accordingly the &s;ad
Thoughts that afflicted my Mind before began to
vani&s;h away.</P>
<P>THIS was enough to let any one &s;ee how all
the Sorrows and Anxieties of Men's Lives come
about, how they ri&s;e from their Re&s;tle&s;s pu&s;hing
at getting of Money, and the re&s;tle&s;s Cares of
keeping it when they have got it. I that had
nothing, and had not known what it was to have
had any thing, knew nothing of the Care, either
of getting, or of keeping; I wanted nothing, who
wanted every thing; I had no Care, no Concern
about where I &s;hould get my Victuals, or how I
&s;hould Lodge, I knew not what Money was, or
what to do with it; and never knew what it was
not to &s;leep, till I had Money to keep, and was
afraid of lo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>I HAD without doubt an opportunity at this
time, if I had not been too fooli&s;h, and too much
a Child to &s;peak for my&s;elf; I had an opportuni|ty,
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> to have got into the Service, or per|haps
to be under &s;ome of the Care and Concern
of the&s;e Gentlemen, for they &s;eem'd to be very
fond of doing &s;omething for me, and were &s;ur|priz'd
at the Innocence of my Talk to them, as
<PB N="50" REF="56">
well as at the Mi&s;ery (as they thought) it of my
Condition.</P>
<P>BUT I acted indeed like a Child, and leaving
my Money, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> I never went near
them for &s;everal Years after; what Cour&s;e I took,
and what befel me in that Interval, has &s;o much
Variety in it, and carries &s;o much In&s;truction in
it, that requires an Account of it by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t happy Chance, that offer'd it &s;elf to
me in the World, was now over; I had got
Money, but I neither knew the Value of it, or the
U&s;e of it; the Way of Living I had begun, was
&s;o natural to me, I had no Notion of bettering it;
I had not &s;o much as any De&s;ire of Buying me
any Cloths, no not &s;o much as a Shirt, and much
le&s;s, had I any Thought of getting any other
Lodging, than that in the <HI>Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e,</HI> and loyter|ing
about the Streets as I had done: For I knew
no Good, and had ta&s;ted no Evil; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> the
Life I had led, being not Evil in my Account.</P>
<P>IN this State of Ignorance, I return'd to my
really mi&s;erable Life, &s;o it was in it &s;elf, and was
only not &s;o to me, becau&s;e I did not under&s;tand
how to judge of it, and had known no better.</P>
<P>MY Comrade that gave me back the Bills, and
who if I had not pre&s;s'd him, de&s;ign'd never to
have re&s;tor'd them, never ask'd me what I had gi|ven
me, but told me, if they gave me any thing it
&s;hould be my own; for as <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he would not run
the venture of being &s;een in the re&s;toring them, I
de&s;erv'd the Reward if there was any; neither did
he trouble his Head with enquiring what I had,
or whether I had any thing or no; &s;o my Title
to what I had got was clear.</P>
<P>I WENT now, up and down ju&s;t as I did before;
I had Money indeed in my Pocket, but I let no
<PB N="51" REF="57">
Body know it; I went of Errands chearfully, as
before, and accepted of what any Body gave me
with as much Thankfulne&s;s as ever; the only
difference that I made with my&s;elf, was, that if I
was a Hungry, and no Body employ'd me, or
gave me any thing to Eat, I did not beg from
Door to Door, as I did at fir&s;t, but went to a
boyling Hou&s;e, <HI>as I &s;aid once before,</HI> and got a
Me&s;s of Broth, and a piece of Bread, Price a Half-penny;
very &s;eldom any Meat; or if I treated
my&s;elf, it was a Half-penny worth of Chee&s;e;
all which Expence did not Amount to above 2<HI>d.</HI>
or 3 <HI>d.</HI> a Week; for contrary to the u&s;age of the
re&s;t of the Tribe, I was extremly Frugal, and I
had not di&s;pos'd of any of the Guineas, which I had
at fir&s;t; neither, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e
Gentleman, could I tell what a Guniea was made
of, or what it was worth.</P>
<P>AFTER I had been about a Month thus, and had
done nothing, my Comrade, <HI>as I call'd him,</HI> came to
me one Morning, Col. <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays he, When &s;hall
you and I, take a walk again? when you will, <HI>&s;aid
I:</HI> Have you got no Bu&s;ine&s;s yet? <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> no, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
and &s;o one thing bringing in another, he told me, I.
was a fortunate Wretch; and he believed I would be
&s;o again; but that he mu&s;t make a new Bargain with
me now, for <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Col. the fir&s;t time we always let
a raw Brother come in for full &s;hare, to Encourage
him, but afterward, except it be when he puts him|&s;elf
forward well, and runs equal Hazard, he &s;tands
to Courti&s;ie; but as we are Gentlemen, we always
do very Honourably by one another; and if you
are willing to tru&s;t it or leave it to me, I &s;hall
do hand&s;omly by you, that you may depend
upon. I told him, I was not able to do any
thing, that was certain, for I did not under&s;tand
<PB N="52" REF="58">
it, and therefore I cou'd not expect to get any
thing, but I would do as he bad me, &s;o we walk'd
Abroad together.</P>
<P>WE went no more to the <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e,</HI> it was
too bold a Venture; be&s;ides, I did not care to
&s;hew my &s;elf again, e&s;pecially with him in Com|pany;
but we went directly to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and
we hanker'd about in <HI>Ca&s;tle-Alley,</HI> and in <HI>Swithins|alley,</HI>
and at the Coffee-hou&s;e-doors. 'Twas a very
unlucky Day, for we got nothing all Day, but 2
or 3 Hankerchiefs, and came home to the old
Lodging, at the <HI>Gla&s;s hou&s;e;</HI> nor had I had any
thing to Eat or Drink all Day, but a piece of
Bread, which he gave me, and &s;ome Water at the
Conduit at the <HI>Exchange gate:</HI> So when he was gone
from me, for he did not lye in the <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;e,</HI> as
I did, I went to my old Broth-hou&s;e for my u&s;ual
Bait; and refre&s;h'd my &s;elf, and the next Day
early went to meet him again, as he appointed me.</P>
<P>BEING early in the Morning, he took his
Walk to <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> where it &s;eems two Sorts of
People make a great Crowd as &s;oon as it is Light;
and at that time a Year, rather before Day light,
<HI>that is to &s;ay, Crimps,</HI> and the Ma&s;ters of <HI>Coal Ships,</HI>
who they call <HI>Collyer Ma&s;ters;</HI> and Secondly, Fi&s;h|mongers,
Fi&s;h-&s;ellers and Buyers of Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>IT was the fir&s;t of the&s;e People that he had his
Eye upon: So he gives me my Orders, which was
thus; go you, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> into all the Ale-hou&s;es as
we go along, and Ob&s;erve, where any People are
telling of Money, and when you find any, come
and tell me; &s;o he &s;tood at the Door, and I went
into the Hou&s;es: As the <HI>Collyer Ma&s;ters</HI> generally
Sell their Coals at the Gate, <HI>as they call it, So</HI>
they generally receive their Money in tho&s;e Ale|hou&s;es,
and it was not long before I brought him
<PB N="53" REF="59">
Word of &s;everal; upon this he went in, and made
his Ob&s;ervations, but found nothing to his pur|po&s;e;
at length I brought him Word, that there
was a Man in &s;uch a Hou&s;e, who had received a
great deal of Money of &s;ome body, I believ'd of
&s;everal People, and that it lay all upon the Table
in Hea$s, and he was very bu&s;y Writing down
the Sums, and putting it up in &s;everal Bags; is he?
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I'll warrant him, I will have &s;ome of it,
and in he goes, he Walks up and down the Hou&s;e,
which had &s;everal open Tables and Boxes in it,
and li&s;&s;ened to hear if he could what the Man's
Name was, and he heard &s;ome body call him <HI>Cul|lum,</HI>
or &s;ome &s;uch a Name; then he watches his
Opportunity, and &s;teps up to him, and tells him
a long Story, that there was two Gentlemen at
the <HI>Gun-Tavern</HI> &s;ent him to Enquire for him, and
to tell him they de&s;ired to &s;peak with him.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Collier</HI> Ma&s;ter had his Money lay be|fore
him, ju&s;t as I had told him; and had two
or three &s;mall Payments of Money, which he
had put up in little Black Dirty Baggs, and lay
by them&s;elves; and as it was hardly broad
Day, he found means in delivering his Me&s;&s;age;
to lay his Hand upon one of tho&s;e Baggs, and
carry it off perfectly undi&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>WHEN he had got it, he came out to me,
who &s;tood but at the Door, and pulling me by the
Sleeve; run <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays he, for our Lives, and
away he Scours; and I after him, never re&s;ting or
&s;carce looking about me, till we got quite up into
<HI>Fenchurch &s;treet,</HI> thro' <HI>Lime-&s;treet,</HI> into <HI>Leaden|hall
&s;treet,</HI> down St. <HI>Mary axe,</HI> to <HI>London Wall,</HI> than
thro$ <HI>Bi&s;hop gate,</HI> and down old <HI>Bedlam,</HI> into <HI>Moor|fields.</HI>
By this time we were neither of us able
to run very fa&s;t, nor need we have gone &s;o far,
<PB N="54" REF="60">
for I never found that any body Per&s;ued us:
When we got into <HI>Moor&s;ields;</HI> and began to take
Breath, I ask'd him what it was frighted him &s;o?
<HI>fright me,</HI> you Fool, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I <HI>have got a Devili&s;h great
Bag of Money:</HI> A Bag! <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> ay, ay, &s;aid he, let us
get out into the Fields, where no Body can &s;ee us,
and I'll &s;hew it you; &s;o away he had me through
<HI>Long-alley,</HI> and Cro&s;s <HI>Hog-lane,</HI> and <HI>Holloway lane,</HI>
into the middle of the great Field, which &s;ince
that, has been call'd the <HI>Farthing pye-hou&s;e-field:</HI>
There we wou'd have &s;at down, but it was all full
of Water; &s;o we went on, cro&s;s'd the Road at <HI>Anni|&s;eed
Cleer,</HI> and went into the Field where now
the Great Ho&s;pital &s;tands: And finding a by place,
we &s;at down, and he Pulls out the Bag; thou art
a lucky Boy, <HI>Jack,</HI> &s;ays he; thou de&s;erve&s;t a good
&s;hare of this Jobb truly, for 'tis all long of thy
lucky News, &s;o he pours it all out into my Hat;
for, as I told you, I now wore a Hat.</P>
<P>How he did to Whip away &s;uch a Bagg of Mo|ney
from any Man that was Awake, and in his
Sen&s;es; I cannot tell; But there was a great deal
in it; and among it, a Paper full by it &s;elf: When
the Paper dropt out of the Bag, hold, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that's
Gold; and began to Crow and Hallow like a mad
Boy, but there he was Bank'd; for it was a Paper
of old Thirteen-pence-half-penny peices, half,
and Quarter Peices, with Nine pences and Four-pence-half-penny's,
all old Crooked Money, <HI>Scots</HI>
and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Coin, &s;o he was di&s;appointed in that; but
as it was, there was about 17 or 18 Pound in the
Bag as I under&s;tood by him, for I cou'd not tell
Money, not I.</P>
<P>WELL, he parted this Money into three, that
is to &s;ay, into three Shares; two for him&s;elf, and
one for me, and ask'd if I was Content, I told him
<PB N="55" REF="61">
yes, I had rea&s;on to be Contented; be&s;ides, it
was &s;o much Money added to that I had left of his
former Adventure, that I knew not what to do
with it, or with my &s;elf, while I had &s;o much
about me.</P>
<P>THIS was a mo&s;t Exqui&s;ite Fellow for a Thief,
for he had the greate&s;t Dexterity at Conveying
any thing away; that he &s;car&s;e ever Pitch'd upon
any thing in his Eye, but he carried it off with
his Hands, and never that I know of, mi&s;s'd his
Aim, or was catch'd in the Fact.</P>
<P>HE was an Eminent Pick-pocket, and very Dex|trous
at the Ladies Gold Watches; but he gene|rally
pu&s;h'd higher at &s;uch de&s;perate Things as
tho&s;e, and he came off the cleane&s;t, and with the
greate&s;t Succe&s;s Imaginable; and it was in the&s;e
Kinds of the wicked Art of Thieving, that I be|came
his Scholar.</P>
<P>As we were now &s;o Rich, he would not let me
lye any longer in the <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;e,</HI> or go Naked,
and Ragged, as I had done; but oblig'd me to buy
two Shirts, a Wa&s;tcoat, and a Great Coat, for a
Great Coat was more for our purpo&s;e, in the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
we was upon than any other: So I Cloathed
my &s;elf as he Directed, and he took me a Lodging
in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with him, and we Lodg'd toge|ther
in a little Garret fit for our Quality.</P>
<P>SOON after this, we Walk'd out again, and
then we try'd our Fortune in the places, by the
<HI>Exchange</HI> a Second time. Here we began to act
&s;eparately, and I undertook to Walk by my &s;elf,
and the fir&s;t thing I did accurately, was a trick I
play'd, that argued &s;ome Skill, for a new Begin|ner,
for I had never &s;een any Bu&s;ine&s;s of that
Kind done before: I &s;aw two Gentlemen mighty
Eager in Talk, and one pull'd out a Pocket-book
<PB N="56" REF="62">
two or three times, and then &s;lipt it into his Coat|pocket
again, and then out it came again, and
Papers were taken out, and others put in; and
then in it went again, and &s;o &s;everal times, the
Man being &s;till warmly Engag'd with another
Man, and two or three others &s;tanding hard by
them; the la&s;t time he put his Pocket-book into
his Pocket, he might have been &s;aid, to thro' it in,
rather than put it in with his Hand, and the Book
Jay End way, re&s;ting upon &s;ome other Book, or
&s;omething el&s;e in his Pocket; &s;o that it did not
go quite down, but one Corner of it was &s;een a|bove
his Pocket.</P>
<P>THIS Carele&s;s way of Men putting their Pock|et-books
into a Coat-pocket, which is &s;o ea&s;ily
Div'd into, by the lea&s;t Boy that has been us'd
to the Trade, can never be too much blam'd; the
Gentlemen are in great Hurries, their Heads and
Thoughts entirely taken up, and it is impo&s;&s;ible
they &s;hould be Guarded enough again&s;t &s;uch little
Hawks Eyed Creatures, as we were; and there|fore,
they ought either never to put their Pocket-books
up at all, or to put them up more &s;ecure,
or to put nothing of Value into them: I happen'd
to be ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to this Gentleman in that they
call <HI>Swithins-alley;</HI> or that Alley rather, which is
between <HI>Swithins-alley;</HI> and the <HI>Exchange;</HI> ju&s;t by
a Pa&s;&s;age that goes out of the Alley into the <HI>Ex|change:</HI>
When &s;eeing the Book pa&s;s, and repa&s;s,
into the Pocket, and out of the Pocket, as above,
it came immediately into my Head, certainly, I
might get that Pocket book out, if I were Nimble,
and I warrant <HI>Will</HI> would have it, if he &s;aw it go
and come, to and again, as I did: But when I &s;aw
it Hang by the way, as I have &s;aid; Now, 'tis
mine &s;aid I, to my &s;elf, and cro&s;ing the Alley, $
<PB N="57" REF="63">
bru&s;h'd &s;moothly but clo&s;ely by the Man, with
iny Hand down flat to my own Side, and taking
hold of it by the Corner that appear'd; the Book
came &s;o light into my Hand, it was impo&s;&s;ible
the Gentleman &s;hould feel the lea&s;t motion, or
any body el&s;e &s;ee me take it away. I went di|rectly
forward into the broad Place, on the North|&s;ide
of the <HI>Exchange,</HI> then&s;cour'd down <HI>Bartholo|mew-lane,</HI>
&s;o into <HI>Token-hou&s;e-yard,</HI> into the Alleys,
which pa&s;s thro from thence to <HI>London-wall,</HI> &s;o
thro' <HI>Moor-gate,</HI> and &s;at down in the Gra&s;s, in the
Second of the Quarters of <HI>Moor-fields;</HI> towards the
middle Field; which was the Place that <HI>Will</HI> and
I had appointed to meet at, if either of us got any
Booty: When I came thither, <HI>Will</HI> was not come,
but I &s;aw him a coming in about half an Hour.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as <HI>Will</HI> came to me, I ask'd him what
Booty he had gotten; he look'd Pale, and as I
thought frighted: But he return'd, I have got no|thing,
<HI>not I,</HI> but you lucky young Dog, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
what have you got, have not you got the Gentle|man's
Pocket-book in <HI>Swithins-Alley:</HI> Yes, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
and Laught at him; why, how did you know it:
Know it! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> why, the Gentleman is Raving
and half Di&s;tracted: He Stamps and Crys, and
Tears his very Cloths, <HI>he &s;ays</HI> he is utterly un|done,
and ruin'd, and the Folks in the Alley &s;ay,
there is, I know not how many Thou&s;and Pounds
in it; what can be in it, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Will, <HI>come let us &s;ee.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, we lay clo&s;e in the Gra&s;s, in the Middle
of the Quarter; &s;o that no body minded us, and
&s;o we opened the Pocket-book, and there was a
great many Bills and Notes under Men's Hands;
&s;ome <HI>Gold-&s;imiths,</HI> and &s;ome belonging to <HI>In&s;urance
Offices,</HI> as they call them, and the like: But that
which was, it &s;eems, worth all the re&s;t, was that
<PB N="58" REF="64">
in one of the Folds of the Cover of the Book, where
there was a Ca&s;e with &s;everal Partitions; there
was a Paper full of loo&s;e Diamonds: The Man
as we under&s;tood afterwards, was a <HI>Jew;</HI> who
dealt in &s;uch Goods, and who indeed ought to have
taken more Care of the keeping of them.</P>
<P>NOW was this Booty too great, even for <HI>Will</HI>
him&s;elf to Manage; for tho' by this time, I was
come to under&s;tand things better than I did for|merly,
when I knew not what belong'd to Money;
yet, <HI>Will</HI> was better skill'd by far in tho&s;e things
than I. But this puzzl'd him too as well as me:
Now, were we &s;omething like the Cock in the Fa|ble;
for all the&s;e Bills, and I think there was one
Bill of Sir <HI>Henry Furne&s;s</HI>'s for 1200 Pounds, and
all the&s;e <HI>Diamonds,</HI> which were worth abott 150<HI>l.
as they &s;aid,</HI> I &s;ay, all the&s;e things were of no Va|lue
to us; one little Pur&s;e of Gold would have
been better to us, than all of it: But, <HI>come &s;ays
Will,</HI> let us look over the Bills for a little one.</P>
<P>WE look'd over all the Bills, and among them;
we found a Bill under a Man's Hand for 32 <HI>l. come
&s;ays Will,</HI> let us go and Enquire where this Man
Lives: So we went into the City again, and <HI>Will</HI>
went to the <HI>Po&s;t bou&s;e,</HI> and ask'd there, they told
him he liv'd at <HI>Temple-bar;</HI> Well, <HI>&s;ays Will,</HI> I
will venture; I'll go and receive the Money, it
may be he has not remembred to &s;end to &s;top the
Payment there.</P>
<P>BUT it came into his thoughts, to take another
Cour&s;e; <HI>come &s;ays Will,</HI> I'll go back to the Alley, and
&s;ee if I can hear any thing of what has happen'd,
for I believe the Hurry is not over yet; it &s;eems the
Man who lo&s;t the Book was carried into the <HI>King's-Head-Tavern,</HI>
at the End of that Alley, and a
great Crowd was about the Door.
<PB N="59" REF="65">
AWAY goes <HI>Will,</HI> and watches, and waits about
the Place, and then &s;eeing &s;everal People together,
for they were not all di&s;pers'd, he asks one or
two what was the Matter; they tell him a long
&s;tory of a Gentleman who had lo&s;t his Pocket-book,
with a great Bag of <HI>Diamonds</HI> in it, and Bills
for a great many Thou&s;and Pounds, and I know
not what; and that they had been ju&s;t then Cry|ing
it, and had offer'd a Hundred Pound Reward,
to any one that would di&s;cover and re&s;tore it.</P>
<P>I WISH <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to one of them, that Parled
with him, I did but know who has it; I dont
doubt but I would help him to it again; does he
remember nothing of any body, Boy, or Fellow
that was near him, if he cou'd but De&s;cribe him,
it might do; &s;ome body that over heard him
was &s;o forward to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor Gentleman, that
they went up and let him know what a young
Fellow, meaning <HI>Will,</HI> had been talking at the
Door, and down comes another Gentleman from
him, and taking <HI>Will a&s;ide, a&s;k'd him what he bad
&s;aid about it? Will</HI> was a Grave &s;ort of a young
Man, that tho' he was an old Soldier at the Trade,
had yet nothing of it in his Countenance, and he
an&s;wer'd, that he was concerned in Bu&s;ine&s;s
where a great many of the Gangs of little Pick-pockets
haunted; and if he had but the lea&s;t Di&s;|cription
of the Per&s;on that they Su&s;pected, he dur&s;t
&s;ay, he cou'd find him out, and might perhaps get
the things again for him: Upon this, he de$r'd
him to go up with him to the Gentleman, which
he did accordi gly; and there he &s;aid he &s;at lean|ing
his Head back in a Chair, Pale as a Cloth;
di&s;con&s;olate to a &s;trange Degree, and as <HI>Will</HI> de|&s;crib'd
him, ju&s;t like one under a Sentence.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="66">
WHEN they came to ask him whether he had
&s;een no Boy, or &s;habby Fellow lurking near where
he &s;tood, or pa&s;&s;ing, and repa&s;&s;ing? and the like,
he an&s;wer'd, no, not any; neither could he re|member
that any Body had come near him; then
&s;aid <HI>Will,</HI> it will be very hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible
to find them out: However, &s;aid <HI>Will,</HI> if you
think it worth while, I will put my &s;elf among
tho&s;e Rogues, tho' <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I care not for being
&s;een among them, but I will put in among them,
and if it be in any of tho&s;e Gangs, it is ten to
one but I &s;hall hear &s;omething of it.</P>
<P>THEY ask'd him then, if he had heard what
Terms the Gentleman had offer'd to have it re|&s;tor'd;
he an&s;wer'd, no; (tho' he had been told at
the Door,) they a&s;wer'd, he had offer'd a Hundred
Pound; that is too much, <HI>&s;ays Will,</HI> but if you
plea&s;e to leave it to me; I &s;hall either get it for
you for le&s;s than that, or not be able to get it for
you at all: Then the lo&s;ing Gentleman &s;aid to
one of the other, tell him, that if he can get it
lower, the Over-plus &s;hall be to him&s;elf; <HI>William</HI>
&s;aid, he would be very glad to do the Gentleman
&s;uch a Service, and would leave the Reward to
him&s;elf. Well, young Man, &s;ays one of the
Gentlemen, what ever you appoint to the young
Arti&s;t that has done this Roguery; for I warrant
he is an Arti&s;t, let it be who it will, he &s;hall be
paid, if it be within the Hundred Pound, and the
Gentleman is willing to give you 50 <HI>l.</HI> be&s;ides for
your Pains</P>
<P>TRULY, Sir, &s;ays <HI>Will,</HI> very Gravely, it was
by meer Chance; that coming by the Door, and
&s;eeing the Crowd, I ask'd what the matter was;
but if I &s;hould be In&s;trumental to get the unfor|tunate
Gentleman his Pocket-book, and the things
<PB N="61" REF="67">
in it again, I &s;hall be very glad; nor am I &s;o Rich
neither Sir, but 50 <HI>l.</HI> is very well worth my while
too: Then he took Directions who to come to, and
where, and who to give his Account to, if he learnt
any thing, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> &s;taid &s;o long, that as he and I agreed, I
went home, and he did not come to me till Night;
for we had Con&s;ider'd before, that it would not be
proper to come from them directly to me, lea&s;t
they &s;hould follow him, and apprehend me; if he
had made no advances towards a Treaty, he would
have come back in half an Hour, as we agreed;
but &s;taying late, we met at our Night-rendezvous,
which was in <HI>Ro&s;emary-lane.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN he came, he gave me an Account of all
the Di&s;cour&s;e, and particularly what a Con&s;terna|tion
the Gentleman was in, who had lo&s;t the
Pocket-book, and that he did not doubt, but we
&s;hould get a good round Sum for the Recovery
of it.</P>
<P>WE Con&s;ulted all the Evening about it, and
Concluded he &s;hould let them hear nothing of
them the next Day at all; and that the third Day
he &s;hould go, but &s;hould make no Di&s;covery;
only that he had got a Scent of it, and that he be|liev'd
he &s;hould have it, and make it appear as
Difficult as po&s;&s;ible, and to &s;tart as many Obje|ctions
as he could; accordingly, the third Day
after, he met with the Gentleman, who he found
had been unea&s;ie, at his long &s;tay; and told him,
they was a&s;raid that he only Flatter'd them, to
get from them; and that they had been too Ea&s;ie
in letting him go, without a farther Examination.</P>
<P>HE took upon him to be very Grave with them,
and told them, that if that was what he was like
to have for being &s;o free, as to tell them he
<PB N="62" REF="68">
thought he might &s;erve them, they might &s;ee
that they had wrong'd him, and were mi&s;taken
by his coming again to them; that if they thought
they cou'd do any thing by Examining him,
they might go about it if they pleas'd now, that
all he had to &s;ay to them, was, that he knew
where &s;ome of the young Rogues Haunted, who
were Famous for &s;uch things; and that by &s;ome
Inquiries, offering them Money and the like,
he believ'd they would be brought to betray one
another, and that &s;o he might pick it out for them,
and this he would &s;ay before a Ju&s;tice of Peace if
they thought fit, and then all that he had to &s;ay far|ther
to them, was to tell them, he had lo&s;t a Day
or two in their Service; and had got nothing but
to be &s;u&s;pected for his Pains; and that after that,
he had done, and they might &s;eek their Goods
where they could find them.</P>
<P>THEY began to li&s;&s;en a little upon that, and
ask'd him if he could give them any Hopes of re|covering
their Lo&s;s; he told them, that he was
not afraid to tell them, that he believ'd he had
heard &s;ome News of them, and that what he had
done, had prevented all the Bills being Burnt
Book and all; But that now he ought not to be
ask'd any more Que&s;tions till they &s;hould be
pleas'd to an&s;wer him a Que&s;tion or two: They
told him they would give him any Satisfaction
they could, and bid him tell them what he de|&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>WHY,
Sir, <HI>Says he,</HI> how can you expect any
Thief that had Robb'd you to &s;uch a Con&s;iderable
Value as this, wou'd come and put him&s;elf into
your Hands, confe&s;s he had your Goods, and re|&s;tore
them to you; if you do not give them A&s;&s;u|rance,
that you will not only give them the Re|ward
<PB N="63" REF="69">
you agree to, but al&s;o, give A&s;&s;urance that
they &s;hall not be Stop'd, Que&s;tion'd, or call'd to
Account before a Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>THEY &s;aid they would give all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;u|rance
of it; nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I do not know what A&s;|&s;urance
you are able to give; for when a poor
Fellow is in your Clutches, and has &s;hown you
your Goods, you may Seize upon him for a Theif,
and it is plain he mu&s;t be &s;o; then you go take
away your Goods, &s;end him to Pri&s;on, and what
amends can he have of you afterward?</P>
<P>THEY were entirely confounded with the dif|ficulty,
they ask'd him to try if he could get the
Things into his Hands, and they would pay him
the Money before he let them go out of his Hand,
and he &s;hould go away Half an Hour before
they went out of the Room.</P>
<P>No Gentlemen, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that won't do now;
if you had talk'd &s;o before, you had talk'd of ap|prehending
me for nothing, I &s;hould have taken
your Words; but now it is plain you have had
&s;uch a thought in your Heads, and how can I, or
any one el&s;e be a&s;&s;ur'd of Safety.</P>
<P>WELL, they thought of a great many particu|lars,
but nothing would do; at length the other
People who were pre&s;ent, put in, that they &s;hould
give Security to him, by a Bond of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> that
they would not give the Per&s;on any Trouble
what&s;oever: He pretended they could not be
Bound, nor could their Obligation be of any Va|lue,
and that their own Goods being once &s;een,
they might Seize them; and what would it &s;igni|fy,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to put a poor Pick-pocket to Sue for
his Reward: They could not tell what to &s;ay, but
told him, that he &s;hould take the things of the
Boy, if it was a Boy; and they would be Bound
<PB N="64" REF="70">
to Pay him the Money promis'd. He Laught at
them, and &s;aid, no Gentlemen, as I am not the
Thief; &s;o I &s;hall be very loth to put my &s;elf in
the Thiefs &s;tead, and lye at your Mercy.</P>
<P>THEY told him they knew not what to do then;
and that it would be very hard, he would not
tru&s;t them at all; <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he was very willing to
tru&s;t them, and to &s;erve them; but that it would
be very hard to be ruin'd, and Charg'd with the
Theft, for Endeavouring to &s;erve them.</P>
<P>THEY then offer'd to give it him under their
Hands, that they did not in the lea&s;t Su&s;pect him;
that they would never Charge him with any
thing about it; that they Acknowledg'd he went
about to Enquire after the Goods at their Reque&s;t;
and that if he produced them, they would Pay
him &s;o much Money, at, and before the Delivery
of them, without Obliging him to Name or pro|duce
that Per&s;on he had them from.</P>
<P>UPON this Writing Sign'd by three Gentlemen
who were Pre&s;ent, and by the Per&s;on in particu|lar
who lo&s;t the things; the young Gentleman
told them, he would go and do his utmo&s;t to get
the Pocket-book, and all that was in it.</P>
<P>THEN he de&s;ir'd that they would in Writing
before Hand, give him a particular of all the
&s;everal things that were in the Book; that he
might not have it &s;aid when he produc'd it,
that there was not all; and he would have the
&s;aid Writing Seal'd up, and he would make the
Book be Seal'd up when it was given to him:
This they agreed to, and the Gentleman accord|ingly
drew up a particular of all the Bills that
he remembred, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> was in the Book; and
al&s;o of the <HI>Diamonds,</HI> as follows:
<Q><LIST>
<PB N="65" REF="71">
<ITEM>One Bill under Sir <HI>Henry Furne&s;s</HI>'s
Hand, for 1200 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>One Bill under Sir <HI>Charles Dun|comb</HI>'s
Hand, for 800 <HI>l. 250 l.</HI>
Endor&s;t off 550</ITEM>
<ITEM>One Bill under the Hand of
<HI>J. Ta&s;&s;ell,</HI> Gold&s;mith 165</ITEM>

<ITEM>One Bill of one <HI>Stewart</HI> that kept
a <HI>Wager Office,</HI> and <HI>In&s;urance.</HI> 350</ITEM>
<ITEM>A Paper containing 37 loo&s;e <HI>Diamonds,</HI> value
about 250 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>A little Paper containing three large Rough
<HI>Diamonds,</HI> and one large one, poli&s;h'd, and
Cut, Value 185 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>FOR all the&s;e things, they promi&s;s'd fir&s;t to give
me what ever he agreed with the Thief to give
him; not exceeding 50 <HI>l.</HI> and to give him 50 <HI>l.</HI>
more for him&s;elf for procuring them.</P>
<P>Now he had his Cue, and now he came to me,
and told me hone&s;tly the whole Story, as above;
&s;o I deliver'd him the Book, and he told me that
he thought it was rea&s;onable we &s;hould not take
the full Sum; becau&s;e, he would &s;eem to have
done them &s;ome Service, and &s;o make them the
ea&s;ier; all this I agreed to, &s;o he went the next
Day to the place, and the Gentlemen met him
very punctually.</P>
<P>HE told them at fir&s;t Word, he had done their
Work, and as he hoped to their Mind; and told
them, if it had not been for the <HI>Diamonds,</HI> he
could have got it all for 10 <HI>l;</HI> but that the <HI>Dia|monds</HI>
had &s;hone &s;o Bright in the Boy's Imagina|tion,
that he talk'd of running away to <HI>France</HI> or
<PB N="66" REF="72">
<HI>Holland,</HI> and living there all his Days like a Gen|tleman;
at which they Laught: However, Gen|tlemen,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> here is the Book, and &s;o pull'd
it out wrapt up in a Dirty peice of a Colour'd
Handkerchief, as black as the Street could make
it; and Seal'd with a peice of &s;orry Wax, and the
Impre&s;&s;ion of a Farthing for a Seal.</P>
<P>UPON this, the Note being al&s;o un&s;eal'd; at
the &s;ame time he pull'd open the Dirty Rag,
and &s;hew'd the Gentleman his Pocket-Book; at
which he was &s;o over &s;urpriz'd with Joy; notwith|&s;tanding,
all the preparatory Di&s;cour&s;e that he
was fain to call for a Gla&s;s of Wine or Brandy,
to Drink to keep him from Fainting.</P>
<P>THE Book being open'd, the Paper of <HI>Dia|monds</HI>
was fir&s;t taken out; and there they were
every one, only the little Paper was by it&s;elf;
and the Rough <HI>Diamonds</HI> that were in it, were
loo&s;e among the re&s;t; but he own'd they were all
there Safe.</P>
<P>THEN the Bills were call'd over, one by one,
and they found one Bill for 80 Pound more than
the Account mention'd; be&s;ides, &s;everal Papers
which were not for Money, tho' of Con&s;equence
to the Gentleman; and he acknowledg'd that all
was very hone&s;tly return'd, and now young Man,
<HI>&s;aid they,</HI> you &s;hall &s;ee we will deal as hone&s;tly
by you; and &s;o in the fir&s;t place, they gave him
50<HI>l.</HI> for him&s;elf; and then they told out the 50<HI>l.</HI>
for me.</P>
<P>HE took the 50<HI>l.</HI> for him&s;elf, and put it up in
his Pocket; wrapping it in Paper, it being all in
Gold: Then he began to tell over the other 50<HI>l.</HI>
but when he had told out 30<HI>l.</HI> Hold Gentlemen,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> as I have acted fairly for you; &s;o you
&s;hall have no rea&s;on to &s;ay, I do not do &s;o to the
<PB N="67" REF="73">
End; I have taken 30<HI>l.</HI> and for &s;o much I agreed
with the Boy, and &s;o there is 20<HI>l.</HI> of your Money
again.</P>
<P>THEY &s;tood looking one at another a good
while, as &s;urpriz'd at the hone&s;ty of it, for till
that time they were not quite without a &s;ecret Su&s;|picion
that he was the Thief, but that peice of Po|licy
cleared up his Reputation to them: The
Gentleman that had got his Bills, &s;aid &s;oftly to
one of them, give it him all, but the other &s;aid
(&s;oftly too,) no, no, as long as he has got it abated,
and is &s;atisfied with the 50 <HI>l.</HI> you have given him,
'tis very well, let it go as it is; this was not
&s;poke &s;o &s;oftly but I heard it, and <HI>I &s;aid no too,</HI> I
am very well &s;atisfied, I am glad I have got them
for you, and &s;o they began to part.</P>
<P>BUT ju&s;t before they were going away, one of
the Gentlemen &s;aid to him, young Man come,
you &s;ee we are ju&s;t to you, and have done fairly,
as you have al&s;o, and we will not de&s;ire you to
tell us who this cunning Fellow is that got &s;uch a
Prize from this Gentleman; but as you have
talk'd with him, prethee can you tell us nothing
of how he did it, that we may beware of &s;uch
Sparks again.</P>
<P>SIR, &s;ays <HI>Will,</HI> when I &s;hall tell you what they
&s;ay, and how the particular Ca&s;e &s;tood, the Gen|tleman
would blame him&s;elf more than any Body
el&s;e, or as much at lea&s;t; The young Rogue that
catch'd this Prize, was out it &s;eems with a Com|rade,
who is a nimble experienced Pick-pocket
as mo&s;t in <HI>London,</HI> but at that time the Arti&s;t
was &s;ome where at a di&s;tance, and this Boy never
had pick'd a Pocket in his Life before; but <HI>he &s;ays,</HI>
he &s;tood over again&s;t the Pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Ex|change,</HI>
on the Ea&s;t-Side, and the Gentleman &s;tood
<PB N="68" REF="74">
ju&s;t by the Pa&s;&s;age; that he was very earne&s;t in
Talking with &s;ome other Gentleman, and often
pull'd out this Book, and open'd it, and took Papers
out, or put others in, and return'd it into his Coat-Pocket;
that the la&s;t time it hitch'd at the Pocket|hole,
or &s;top'd at &s;omething that was in the Pocket,
and hung a little out, which the Boy, who had
watch'd it a good while, perceiving, he pa&s;&s;es by
clo&s;e to the Gentleman, and carry'd it &s;moothly
off, without the Gentleman's perceiving it at all.</P>
<P>HE went on, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> 'tis very &s;trange Gen|tlemen
&s;hould put Pocket-Books which have &s;uch
things in them into tho&s;e loo&s;e Pockets, and in &s;o
carele&s;s a manner; that's very true, <HI>&s;ays the Gen|tleman,</HI>
and &s;o with &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;e of no
great &s;ignification he came away to me.</P>
<P>WE were now &s;o rich that we &s;carce knew what
to do with our Money, at lea&s;t I did not, for I
had no Relations, no Friend, no where to put
any thing I had, but in my Pocket; as for <HI>Will,</HI>
he had a poor Mother, but wicked as him&s;elf,
and he made her Rich, and Glad with his good
Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>WE divided this Booty equally, for tho' the
gaining it, was Mine, yet the improving it
was his, and his Management brought the Money;
for neither he, or I could have made any thing
proportionable of the thing, any other way; as
for the Bills, there was no room to doubt, but un|le&s;s
they had been carried that Minute to the
Gold&s;miths for the Money, he would have come
with Notice to &s;top the Payment, and perhaps
have come while the Money was Receiving, and
have taken hold of the Per&s;on; and then as to the
Diamonds there had been no offering them to Sale,
by us poor Boys to any Body, but tho&s;e who were
<PB N="69" REF="75">
our known Receivers, and they would have gi|ven
us nothing for them, compar'd to what they
were worth; for as I under&s;tood afterwards, tho&s;e
who made a Trade thus of buying &s;tolen Goods,
took care to have fal&s;e Weights and Cheat the
poor Devil that &s;tole them, at lea&s;t an Ounce in
Three.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, we made the be&s;t of it, many
ways be&s;ides; I had a &s;trange kind of unin&s;tructed
Con&s;cience at that Time; for tho' I made no &s;cruple
of getting any thing in this manner from any
Body, yet I could not bear de&s;troying their
Bills, and Papers, which were things that would
do them a great deal of hurt, and do me no good;
and I was &s;o Tormented about it, that I could not
re&s;t Night or Day, while I made the People ea|&s;ie,
from whom the things were taken.</P>
<P>I WAS now rich, &s;o rich that I knew not what
to do with my Money, or with my&s;elf, I had
liv'd &s;o near and &s;o clo&s;e, that altho' as <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> I
did now and then lay out Two-pence, or Three-pence
for meer Hunger, yet I had &s;o many Peo|ple,
who, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> employ'd me, and who gave
me Victuals, and &s;ometimes Clothes, that in a
whole Year I had not quite Spent the 15 Shil|lings,
which I had &s;av'd of the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e
Gentleman's Money, and I had the 4 Guineas,
which was of the fir&s;t Booty before that, &s;till in
my Pocket, I mean the Money that I let fall in|to
the Tree.</P>
<P>BUT now I began to look higher, and tho'
<HI>Will</HI> and I, went Abroad &s;everal times together,
yet when &s;mall things offer'd, as Handkerchiefs,
and &s;uch Trifies, we would not meddle with
them, not ca$ing to run the Ri&s;que for &s;mall
Matters: It fell out one Day that as we were
<PB N="70" REF="76">
&s;trouling about in <HI>We&s;t-Smithfield,</HI> on a <HI>Friday,</HI>
there happen'd to be an antient Country Gentle|man
in the Market, &s;elling &s;ome very large Bul|locks;
it &s;eems they came out of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> for we
heard him &s;ay there were no &s;uch Bullocks in the
whole County of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> his Wor&s;hip, <HI>for &s;o they
calll'd him,</HI> had receiv'd the Money for the&s;e Bul|locks
at a Tavern, who&s;e Sign, I forget now, and
havi$g &s;ome of it in a Bag, and the Bag in his
Hand, he was taken with a &s;udden fit of Cough|ing,
and &s;tands to Cough, re&s;ting his Hand with
the Bag of Money in it, upon a Bulk-head of a
Shop, ju&s;t by the <HI>Cloy&s;ter-Gate</HI> in <HI>Smithfield,
that is to &s;ay,</HI> within three or four Doors of it;
we were both ju&s;t behind him, &s;ays <HI>Will</HI> to me,
&s;tand ready; upon this, he makes an artificial
&s;tumble, and falls with his Head ju&s;t again&s;t the
old Gentleman in the very Moment, when he
was Coughing ready to be &s;trangl'd, and quite
Spent for want of Breath.</P>
<P>THE violence of the blow beat the old Gentle|man
quite down, the Bag of Money did not im|mediately
fly out of his Hand, but I run to get
hold of it, and gave it a quick &s;natch, pul|led
it clean away, and run like the Wind down
the <HI>Cloy&s;ter</HI> with it, turn'd on the Left-Hand as
&s;oon as I was thro', and cut into <HI>Little-Britain</HI> &s;o
into <HI>Bartholomew-Clo&s;e,</HI> then cro&s;s <HI>Alder&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI>
thro' <HI>Paul's-Alley</HI> into <HI>Red-Cro&s;s-&s;treet,</HI> and &s;o cre&s;s
all the Streets, thro' innumerable Alleys, and
never &s;topp'd, till I got into the &s;econd Quarter
of <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> our old agreed Rendezvous.</P>
<P>WILL, in the mean time fell down with the old
Gentleman, but &s;oon got up; the old Knight,
<HI>for &s;uch it &s;eems he was,</HI> was frighted with the fall,
and-this Breath &s;o &s;topp'd with his Cough, that
<PB N="71" REF="77">
he could not recover him&s;elf to &s;peak till &s;ome
time, during which, nimble <HI>Will</HI> was got up again,
and walk'd off; nor could he call out &s;top Thief,
or tell any Body he had lo&s;t any thing for a good
while; but Coughing vehemently, and looking
red till he was almo&s;t black in the Face, he cry'd
the Ro&mdash;<HI>Hegh, Hegh, Hegh,</HI> the Rogues <HI>Hegh,</HI>
have got <HI>Hegh, Hegh, Hegh, Hegh, Hegh, Hegh,</HI> then
he would get a little Breath, and at it again the
Rogue&mdash;<HI>Hegh, Hegh,</HI> and after a great many
<HI>Heghs,</HI> and <HI>Rogues</HI> he brought it out, have got a|way
my Bag of Money.</P>
<P>ALL this while the People under&s;tood nothing
of the matter, and as for the Rogues indeed, they
had time enough to get clear away, and in about
an Hour <HI>Will</HI> came to the Rendezvous; there we
&s;at down in the Gra&s;s again, and turn'd out the
the Money, which prov'd to be 8 Guineas, and
5<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> in Silver, &s;o that it made ju&s;t 14<HI>l.</HI> to|gether;
this we &s;har'd upon the Spot, and went
to Work the &s;ame Day, for more; but whether
it was that being fluth'd with our Succe&s;s, we
were not &s;o vigilant, or that no other opportunity
offer'd, I know not, but we got nothing more that
Night, nor &s;o much as any thing offer'd it &s;elf
for an attempt.</P>
<P>WE took many Walks of this kind, &s;ometime
together, at a little di&s;tance from one another,
and &s;everal &s;mall Hits we made, but we were &s;o
&s;lu&s;h'd with our Succe&s;s, that truly we were a|bove
meddling with Trifles, <HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> no,
not &s;uch things, that others would have been glad
of; nothing but Pocket-Books, Letter-Ca&s;es, or
Sums of Money would move us.</P>
<P>THE next Adventure was in the dusk of the
Evening in a Court, which goes out of <HI>Grace-Church-&s;treet</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="78">
into <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> where the <HI>Qua|ker's-Meeting
Hou&s;e</HI> is; there was a young Fellow,
who as we learn'd afterward was a Wollen-Drapers
Apprentice in <HI>Grace Church &s;treet;</HI> it &s;eems he had
been receiving a Sum of Money, which was very
con&s;iderable, and he comes to a Gold&s;mith's-Shop
in <HI>Lombard Street</HI> with it; paid in the mo&s;t of
it there, in&s;omuch, that it grew Dark, and the
Gold&s;mith began to be &s;hutting in Shop, and
Candles to be Lighted: We watch'd him in there,
and &s;tood on the other Side of the way to &s;ee what
he did When he had paid in all the Money he
intended, he &s;tay'd &s;till &s;ometime longer to take
Notes, as I &s;uppos'd, for what he had paid, and
by this time it was &s;till darker than before; at
la&s;t he comes out of the Shop, with &s;till a pretty
large Bag under his Arm, and walks over into
the Court, which was then very Dark; in the mid|dle
of the Court is, a boarded Entry, and far|ther,
at the End of it a Thre&s;hold, and as &s;oon
as he had &s;et his Foot over the Thre&s;hold he was
to turn on his Left Hand into <HI>Grace-Church-&s;treet.</HI></P>
<P>KEEPUP,
&s;ays <HI>Will</HI> to me, be nimble, and as &s;oon
as he had &s;aid &s;o, he flyes at the young Man, and
Gives him &s;uch a violent Thru&s;t, that pu&s;h'd him
forward with too great a force for him to &s;tand,
and as he &s;trove to recover, the Thre&s;hold took
his Feet, and he fell forward into the other part
of the Court, as if he had flown in the Air, with
his Head lying towards the <HI>Quaker's-Meeting-Hou&s;e;</HI>
I &s;tood ready, and pre&s;ently felt out the
Bag of Money, which I heard fall, for it flew
out of his Hand, he having his Life to &s;ave, not
his Money: I went forward with the Money,
and <HI>Will</HI> that threw him down, finding I had it,
<PB N="73" REF="79">
run backward, and as I made along <HI>Fen-Church-&s;treet,
Will</HI> overtook me, and we &s;cour'd home
together; the poor young Man was hurt a little
with the fall, and reported to his Ma&s;ter, as we
heard afterward that he was knock'd down, which
was not true, for neither <HI>Will,</HI> or I had any
Stick in our Hands; but the Ma&s;ter of the Youth
was it &s;eems &s;o very thankful that his young
Man was not knock'd down before he paid the
re&s;t of the Money, (which was above 100 <HI>l.</HI> more)
to the Gold&s;mith, who was Sir, <HI>John Sweetapple,</HI>
that he made no great Noi&s;e at the Lo&s;s he
had; and as we heard afterward, only warn'd
his Prentice to be more careful, and come no
more thro' &s;uch Places in the Dark; whereas the
Man had really no &s;uch Deliverance as he ima|gined,
for we &s;aw him before, when he had all
the Money about him, but it was no time of Day
for &s;uch Work as we had to do, &s;o that he was
in no Danger before.</P>
<P>THIS Booty mounted to 29 <HI>l.</HI> 16 <HI>s.</HI> which was 14 <HI>l.</HI>
18 <HI>s.</HI> a peice, and added exceedingly to my Store,
which began now to be very much too big for
my Management; and indeed I began to be now
full of Care for the pre&s;ervation of what I had
got: I wanted a tru&s;ty Friend to commit it to,
but where was &s;uch a one to be found by a poor
Boy, bred up among Thieves? if I &s;hould have
let any hone&s;t Body know that I had &s;o much
Money, they would have ask'd me how I came by
it, and would have been afraid to take it into
their Hands, lea&s;t I being &s;ome time or other
catch'd in my Rogueries, they &s;hould be counted
the Receivers of &s;tolen Goods, and the encouragers
of a Thief.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="80">
WE had however in the mean time a great ma|ny
other &s;ucce&s;sful Enterprizes, &s;ome of one
kind, &s;ome of another, and were never &s;o much
as in danger of being apprehended; but my Com|panion
<HI>Will,</HI> who was now grown a Man, and en|courag'd
by the&s;e Advantages fell into quite
another Vein of Wickedne&s;s, getting acquainted
with a wretched Gang of Fellows, that turn'd
their Hands to every Thing that was vile.</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> was a lu&s;ty &s;trong Fellow, and withal ve|ry
bold and daring, would Fight any Body, and
venture upon any thing, and I found he began
to be above the mean Rank of a poor Pick-pocket,
&s;o I &s;aw him but &s;eldom; however, once coming
to me in a very friendly familiar Manner, and
asking me how I went on, I told him that I us'd
the old Trade &s;till, that I had had two or three
good Jobbs, one with a young Woman, who&s;e
Pocket I had pick'd of eleven Guineas, and ano|ther
a Country Woman ju&s;t come out of a Stage-Coach,
&s;eeing her pull out her Bag to pay the
Coachman, and that I follow'd her till I got an
opportunity, and &s;lipt it out &s;o neatly, that tho'
there was 8 <HI>l.</HI> 17 <HI>s.</HI> in it, yet &s;he never felt it go;
and &s;everal other Jobbs I told him off, by which
I made pretty good Purcha&s;e: I always &s;aid you
were a lucky Boy, Col. <HI>Jack, &s;ays he,</HI> but come
you are grown almo&s;t a Man now, and you &s;hall
not be always at play at Pu&s;h-pin, I am got in|to
better Bu&s;ine&s;s I a&s;&s;ure you, and you &s;hall
come into it too, I'll bring you into a brave Gang
<HI>Jack, &s;ays he,</HI> where you &s;hall &s;ee we &s;hall be all
Gentlemen.</P>
<P>THEN he told me the Trade it &s;elf in &s;hort,
which was with a Set of Fellows, that had
two of the mo&s;t de&s;perate Works upon their
<PB N="75" REF="81">
Hands that belong'd to the whole Art of Thieving;
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> in the Evening they were Foot-pads,
and in the Night they were Hou&s;e-breakers: <HI>Will</HI>
told me &s;o many plau&s;ible Stories, and talk'd of
&s;uch great things, that in &s;hort, I who had been
always us'd to do any thing he bid me do, went
with him without any he&s;itation.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain, than that hitherto
being partly from the gro&s;s Ignorance of my un|taught
Childhood, as I ob&s;erv'd before, partly
from the hardne&s;s, and wickedne&s;s of the Com|pany
I kept, and add to the&s;e, that it was the
Bu&s;ine&s;s I might be &s;aid to be brought up to, I had,
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> all the way hitherto, no manner of thoughts
about the Good or Evil of what I was embark'd in;
con&s;equently, I had no Sen&s;e of Con&s;cience, no
Reproaches upon my Mind for having done
ami&s;s.</P>
<P>YET I had &s;omething in me, by what &s;ecret In|fluence
I knew not, kept me from the other degrees
of Raking and Vice, and in &s;hort, from the ge|neral
Wickedne&s;s of the re&s;t of my Companions:
For Example, I never us'd any ill Words, no
Body ever heard me &s;wear, nor was I given to
drink, or to love &s;trong drink; and I cannot omit a
Circum&s;tance that very much &s;erv'd to prevent it;
I had a &s;trange original Notion, as I have menti|oned
in its Place, of my being a Gentleman; and
&s;everal things had Ca&s;ually happen'd in my way
to encrea&s;e this Fancy of mine; it happen'd one
Day, that being in the <HI>Gla&s;s hou&s;e</HI> Yard, between
<HI>Ro&s;emary-lane</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff-high-way,</HI> there came
a Man dre&s;s'd very well, and with a Coach attend|ing
him, and he came, (as I &s;uppo&s;e) to buy Gla&s;s-bottles,
or &s;ome other Goods, as they &s;old; and
<PB N="76" REF="82">
in bargaining for his Goods, he &s;wore mo&s;t hor|rid
Oaths at every two or three Words.</P>
<P>AT length the Ma&s;ter of the Gla&s;s, an anti|ent
grave Gentleman took the liberty to reprove
him, which at fir&s;t made him &s;wear the wor&s;e;
after a while the Gentleman was a little calmer, but
&s;till he &s;wore very much, tho' not &s;o bad as at
fir&s;t; after &s;ometime, the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;e</HI>
turn'd from him; really Sir, <HI>&s;ays the good
old Gentleman,</HI> you &s;wear &s;o, and take God's
Name in vain &s;o, that I cannot bear to &s;tay with
you, I had rather you would let my Goods alone,
and go &s;ome where el&s;e, I hope you won't take
it Ill, but I don't de&s;ire to deal with any Body
that does &s;o, I am afraid my <HI>Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e</HI> &s;hould
fall on your Head while you &s;tay in it.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman grew good humour'd at the
Reproof, and &s;aid, well come don't go away, I
won't &s;wear any more, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if I can help it,
for I own, <HI>&s;ay he,</HI> I &s;hould not do it.</P>
<P>WITH that the old Gentleman look'd up at
him, and returning, really Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> 'tis pity
you that &s;eem to be a fine Gentleman, well Bred
and good Humour'd, &s;hould accu&s;tom your &s;elf
to &s;uch an hateful Practice; why it is not like a
Gentleman to &s;wear, 'tis enough for my black
Wretches that Work there at the Furnace, or for
the&s;e ragged nak'd black Guard Boys, pointing at
me, and &s;ome others of the dirty Crew that
lay in the A&s;hes; 'tis bad enough for them, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> and they ought to be corrected for it too;
but for a Man of Breeding, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> a Gentle|man!
it ought to be look'd upon as below them;
Gentlemen know better, and are taught better,
and it is plain you know better; I be&s;eech you
Sir, when you are tempted to &s;wear, always ask
<PB N="77" REF="83">
your &s;elf, is this like a Gentleman? does this be|come
me as a Gentleman! do but ask your &s;elf
that Que&s;tion, and your Rea&s;on will prevail, you
will &s;oon leave it off.</P>
<P>I HEARD all this, and it made the Blood run
Chill in my Veins, when he &s;aid Swearing was on|ly
fit for &s;uch as we were; in &s;hort, it made as
great an Impre&s;&s;ion upon me, as it did upon the
Gentleman; <HI>and yet he took it very kindly too, and
thank'd the old Gentleman for his Advice.</HI> But from
that time forward I never had the lea&s;t Inclinati|on
to Swearing, or ill Words, and abhored it when
I heard the other Boys do it; as to Drinking,
I had no Opportunity, for I had nothing to Drink,
but Water or &s;mall Beer, that any body gave me in
Charity, for they &s;oldom gave away &s;trong Beer;
and after I had Money, I neither de&s;ir'd &s;trong
Beer, or car'd to part with my Money to Buy it.</P>
<P>THEN as to Principle, 'tis true I had no Foun|dation
lay'd in me by Education; and being early
led by my fate into Evil, I had the le&s;s Sen&s;e of
its being Evil left upon my Mind: But when I
began to grow to an Age of under&s;tanding, and
to know that I was a Thief, growing up in all
manner of Villany, and ripening a-pace for the
Gallows, it came often into my thoughts that I
was going wrong, that I was in the high Road to
the Devil, and &s;everal times would &s;top &s;hort,
and ask my &s;elf, if this was the Life of a Gentle|man?</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e little things wore off again, as often
as they came on, and I follow'd the old Trade
again; e&s;pecially when <HI>Will</HI> came to prompt me
as I have ob&s;erv'd, for he was a kind of a Guide
to me in all the&s;e things, and I had by Cu&s;tom
and Application, together with &s;eeing his way,
<PB N="78" REF="84">
learnt to be as a cute a Workman as my Ma|&s;ter.</P>
<P>BUT to go back where I left off, <HI>Will</HI> came to
me as I have &s;aid, and telling me how much better
Bu&s;ine&s;s he was fallen into, would have me go a|long
with him, and I &s;hould be a Gentleman:
<HI>Will</HI> it &s;eems under&s;tood that Word in a quite dif|fering
manner from me; for his Gentleman was
nothing more or le&s;s than a Gentleman Thief, a
Villain of a higher Degree than a Pick-pocket;
and one that might do &s;omething more Wicked,
and better Entituling him to the Gallows, than
could be done in our way: But my Gentleman
that I had my Eye upon, was another thing quite,
tho' I cou'd not really tell how to de&s;cribe it
neither.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Word took with me, and I went
with him; we were neither of us Old, <HI>Will</HI>
was about 24, and as for me I was now about 18,
and pretty Tall of my Age.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t time I went with him, he brought me
into the Company only of two more young Fel|lows;
we met at the lower part of <HI>Grays-Inn-Lane,</HI>
about an Hour before Sun-&s;et, and went out
into the Fields toward a place call'd <HI>Pindar of
Wakefield,</HI> where are abundance of Brick-Kilns:
Here it was agreed to &s;pread from the Field Path
to the Road way, all the way towards <HI>Pancra&s;s
Church,</HI> to ob&s;erve any Chance Game, which as
they call'd it, they might &s;hoot Flying: Upon the
Path within the Bank, on the &s;ide of the Road go|ing
towards <HI>Kenti&s;h Town,</HI> two of our Gang, <HI>Will,</HI>
and one of the other, met a &s;ingle Gentleman
walking a-pace towards the Town, being almo&s;t
Dark: <HI>Will</HI> Cryed, <HI>Mark ho,</HI> which it &s;eems was
the Word, at which we were all to &s;tand &s;till at a
<PB N="79" REF="85">
di&s;tance, come in if he wanted help, and give a
Signal if any thing appear'd that was Dangerous.</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> &s;teps up to the Gentleman, &s;tops him, and
put the Que&s;tion, that is, <HI>Sir, your Money?</HI> the
Gentleman &s;eeing he was alone, &s;truck at him
with his Cane, but <HI>Will</HI> a Nimble &s;trong Fellow
flew in upon him, and with Struggling, got him
down, then he begg'd for his Life, <HI>Will</HI> having
told him with an Oath, that he would Cut his
Throat: In that Moment, while this was doing,
comes a Hackney Coach along the Road; and the
fourth Man who was that way, Crys, <HI>Mark ho,</HI>
which was to intimate that it was a Prize, not a
Surprize, and accordingly the next Man went up
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, where they &s;top'd the Coach, which
had a Doctor of Phy&s;ick and a Surgeon in it, who
had been to Vi&s;it &s;ome con&s;iderable Patient; and
I &s;uppo&s;e had had con&s;iderable Fees; for here they
got two good Pur&s;es, one with 11 or 12 Guineas,
the other Six, with &s;ome Pocket Money, two
Watches, one Diamond Ring, and the Surgeons
Plai&s;ter-box, which was mo&s;t of it full of Silver
In&s;truments.</P>
<P>WHILE they were at this Work, <HI>Will</HI> kept the
Man down, who was under him; and tho' he pro|mis'd
not to Kill him unle&s;s he offer'd to make a
Noi&s;e, yet he would not let him &s;tir till he heard
the Noi&s;e of the Coach going on again, by which
he knew the jobb was over on that Side: Then he
Carried him a little out of the way, ty'd his
Hands behind him, and bid him lye &s;till and make
no Noi&s;e, and he would come back in half an
Hour and untie him upon his Word, but if he
Cryed out he would come back and Kill him.</P>
<P>THE poor Man promis'd to lye &s;till and make
no Noi&s;e, and did &s;o; and had not above 11 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="86">
in his Pocket, which <HI>Will</HI> took, and came back to
the re&s;t, but while they were together, I who was
on the Side of the <HI>Pindar</HI> of <HI>Wakefield,</HI> cry'd
<HI>Mark ho,</HI> too.</P>
<P>WHAT I &s;aw, was a Couple of poor Women, one
a kind of a Nur&s;e, and the other a Maid-Servant
going for <HI>Kenti&s;h-Town:</HI> As <HI>Will</HI> knew that I was
but young at the work, he came flying to me, and
&s;eeing how ea&s;ie a Bargain it was, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> go
<HI>Col.</HI> fall to Work; I went up to them, and &s;peak|ing
to the elderly Woman, Nur&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> don't
be in &s;uch ha&s;t, I want to &s;peak with you, at
which they both &s;topp'd, and look'd a little
frighted; don't be frighted Sweetheart, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> to
the Maid, a little of that Money in the bottom
of your Pocket will make all ea&s;ie, and I'll do you
no harm; by this time <HI>Will</HI> came up to us, for they
did not &s;ee him before; then they began to &s;cream
out; hold, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> make no Noi&s;e, unle&s;s you have a
mind to force us to murther you whether we will
or no, give me your Money pre&s;ently, and make
no Words, and we &s;han't hurt you; upon this, the
poor Maid pull'd out 5 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and the old Woman
a Guinea, and a Shilling, crying heartily for her
Money, and &s;aid, it was all &s;he had left in the
World; well we took it for all that, tho' it made
my very heart bleed to &s;ee what agony the poor
Woman was in at parting with it, and I ask'd her
where &s;he liv'd, &s;he &s;aid her Name was <HI>Smith,</HI> and
&s;he liv'd at <HI>Kenti&s;h-Town;</HI> I &s;aid nothing to her,
but bid them go on about their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and I
gave <HI>Will</HI> the Money; &s;o in a few Minutes we
were all together again: Says one of the other
Rogues, come, this is well enough, for one Road;
its time to be gone; &s;o we jog'd away, cro&s;&s;ing the
Fields, out of the Path towards <HI>Tottenham-Court;</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="87">
but hold, <HI>&s;ays Will,</HI> I mu&s;t go and untye the Man,
D&mdash;m him, <HI>&s;ays one of them,</HI> let him lye, no <HI>&s;ays
Will,</HI> I won't be wor&s;e than my Word, I will untye
him; &s;o he went to the Place, but the Man was
gone, either he had untyed him&s;elf, or &s;ome Body
had pa&s;s'd by, and he had call'd for help, and &s;o
was unty'd, for he could not find him, nor make
him hear, tho' he ventur'd to call twice for him
aloud.</P>
<P>THIS made us ha&s;ten away the fa&s;ter, and get|ting
into <HI>Tottenham Court</HI> Road, they thought it was
a little too near, &s;o they made into the Town at
St. <HI>Giles,</HI> and cro&s;&s;ing to <HI>Pickadilly,</HI> went to <HI>High-Park-Gate;</HI>
here they ventured to rob another
Coach; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> one of the two other Rogues,
and <HI>Will</HI> did it between the <HI>Park Gate</HI> and <HI>Knight's-bridge;</HI>
there was in it, only a Gentleman and
a Punk; a Whore that he had pick'd up, it
&s;eems at the <HI>Spring-Garden</HI> a little farther;
they took the Gentleman's Money, and his Watch,
and his Silver hilted Sword; but when they come
to the Slut, &s;he Damn'd them, and curs'd them
for robbing the Gentleman of his Money, and
leaving him none for her; as for her &s;elf, &s;he had
not one Six-penny Peice about her, tho' &s;he was
indeed well enough dre&s;s'd too.</P>
<P>HAVING made this Adventure, we left that
Road too, and went over the Fields to <HI>Chel&s;ea;</HI> in
the way from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> we met three
Gentlemen; but they were too &s;trong for us to
meddle with; they had been afraid to come over
the Fields &s;o late, (for by this time it was Eight
a-Clock, and tho' the Moon gave &s;ome Light, yet
it was too late, and too dark to be Safe,) &s;o they
hired three Men at <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> two with Pitch-Forks,
and the third, a Waterman, with a Boat-Hook-Staff
<PB N="82" REF="88">
to Guard them, we would have Steer'd clear of
them, and car'd not to have them &s;ee us if we could
help it, but they did &s;ee us, and cry'd, <HI>Who comes
there?</HI> we an&s;wer'd Friends, and &s;o they went on
to our great Satisfaction.</P>
<P>WHEN we came to <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> it &s;eems we had other
Work to do, which I had not been made privy
to, and this was a Hou&s;e to be robb'd; they had
&s;ome Intelligence it &s;eems with a Servant in the
Hou&s;e, who was of their Gang; this Rogue was
a Waiting-man, or Foot-man, and he had a Watch
word to let them in by; but this Fellow not for
want of being a Villain, but by getting drunk,
and not minding his part of the Work di&s;appoint|ed
us, for he had Promis'd to ri&s;e at Two a-Clock
in the Morning, and let us all in; but be|ing
very Drunk, and not come in at Eleven a-Clock
his Ma&s;ter order'd him to be &s;hut out, and
the Doors lock'd up, and charg'd the other
Servants not to let him in, upon any Terms what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>WE came about the Hou&s;e at One a-Clock to
make our Ob&s;ervations, intending to go and lye un|der
<HI>Beaufort-Hou&s;e</HI> Wall till the Clock &s;truck Two,
and then to come again; but behold! when we came
to the Hou&s;e, there lay the Fellow at the Door
fa&s;t a-&s;leep, and very Drunk: <HI>Will,</HI> who I found
was the Leader in all the&s;e things, wak'd the
Fellow, who as he had had about two Hours
Sleep was a little come to him&s;elf, and told them
the Misfortune, as he call'd it, and that he could
not get in; they had &s;ome In&s;truments about them,
by which they could have broken in by Force,
but <HI>Will</HI> con&s;ider'd, that as it was but waiting till
another time, and they &s;hould be let in quietly,
they re&s;olv'd to give it over for that time.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89">
BUT this was a happy Drunken-bout for the
Family, for the Fellow having let fall &s;ome
Words in his Drink, for he was a Saucy one, as
well as a Drunken one, and talk'd oddly, as that
it had been better they had let him in, and he
would make them pay dear for it, or &s;ome &s;uch
thing; the Ma&s;ter hearing of it, turn'd him a|way
in the Morning, and never let him come in|to
his Hou&s;e again; <HI>&s;o I &s;ay,</HI> it was a happy
Drunkenne&s;s to the Family, for it &s;av'd them
from being robb'd, and perhaps murther'd, for
they were a cur&s;ed bloody Crew, and as I found
were about Thirteen of them in all, whereof three
of them made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to get into Gen|tlemens
Services, and &s;o to open Doors in the
Night, and let the other Rogues in upon them,
to rob and de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>I rambl'd this whole Night with them, they
went from <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> being di&s;appointed there as
above, to <HI>Ken&s;ington;</HI> there they broke into a Brew-hou&s;e,
and Wa&s;h-hou&s;e, and by that means into
an Out-Kitchen of a Gentleman's-Hou&s;e, where
they unhang'd a &s;mall Copper, and brought it off,
and &s;tole about a Hundred weight of Pewter, and
went clear off with that too, and every one going
their own by-ways, they found means to get &s;afe
to their &s;everal Receptacles where they u&s;ed to
di&s;po&s;e of &s;uch things.</P>
<P>WE lay &s;till the next Day, and &s;har'd the
Effects &s;tolen that Night, of which my Share
came to 8 <HI>l.</HI> 19 <HI>s.</HI> the Copper and Pewter being
weigh'd, and ca&s;t up, a Per&s;on was at hand to
take it as Money, at about half Value, and in the
Afternoon, <HI>Will</HI> and I came away together: <HI>Will</HI>
was mighty full of the Succe&s;s we had had, and
how we might be &s;ure of the like this way every
<PB N="84" REF="90">
Day. But he ob&s;erv'd that I did not &s;eem &s;o eleva|ted
at the Succe&s;s of that Night's Ramble as I us'd to
be, and al&s;o that I did not take any great Notice
of the Expectations he was in, of what was to
come, yet I had &s;aid little to him at that time.</P>
<P>BUT my Heart was full of the poor Woman's
Ca&s;e at <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Town, and I re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible to
find her out, and give her her Money: With the
abhorrence that fill'd my Mind at the Cruelty
of that Act, there nece&s;&s;arily follow'd a little
Di&s;ta&s;te of the thing it &s;elf, and now it came in|to
my Head with a double force, that this was the
High Road to the Devil, and that certainly this
was not the Life of a Gentleman!</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> and I parted for that time, but next Morn|ing
we met again, and <HI>Will</HI> was mighty Brisk and
Merry; and now Col. <HI>Jack, &s;ays he,</HI> we &s;hall be
Rich very quickly; well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and what &s;hall
we do, when we are Rich? do, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we will
buy a Couple of good Hor&s;es, and go farther a
Field; what do you mean by farther a Field, <HI>&s;aid
I?</HI> why, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we will take the Highway like
Gentlemen, and then we &s;hall get a great deal of
Money indeed; well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what then? why
then, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we &s;hall live like Gentlemen.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Will, &s;ays I,</HI> if we get a great deal of
Money, &s;han't we leave this Trade off, and &s;it
down, and be Safe and Quiet?</P>
<P>AY, &s;ays <HI>Will,</HI> when we have got a great E&s;tate
we &s;hall be willing to lay it down; but where,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> &s;hall we be before that time comes, if we
&s;hould drive on this cur&s;ed kind of Trade?</P>
<P>PRETHEE never think of that, <HI>&s;ays Will,</HI> if you
think of tho&s;e things, you will never be fit to
be a Gentleman; he touch'd me there indeed, for
<PB N="85" REF="91">
it run much in my Mind &s;till, that I was to be
a Gentleman, and it made me Dumb for a while;
but I came to my &s;elf after a little while, and I
&s;aid to him, pretty Tartly, Why <HI>Will,</HI> do you
call this way of Living the Life of a Gentleman?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays, Will,</HI> why not?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> was it like a Gentleman for me
to take that Two and Twenty Shillings from a poor
antient Woman, when &s;he beg'd of me upon her
Knees not to take it, and told me it was
all &s;he had in the World to buy her Bread
for her &s;elf and a &s;ick Child which &s;he had at
home, do you think I could be &s;o Cruel if you
had not &s;tood by, and made me do it? why, I
cry'd at doing it, as much as the poor Woman
did, tho' I did not let you &s;ee me.</P>
<P>You Fool you, <HI>&s;ays Will,</HI> you will never be
fit for our Bu&s;ine&s;s indeed, if you mind &s;uch
things as tho&s;e, I &s;hall bring you off of tho&s;e
things quickly; why, if you will be fit for Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
you mu&s;t learn to fight when they re&s;i&s;t,
and cut their Throats when they &s;ubmit; you mu&s;t
learn to &s;top their Breath, that they may beg and
pray no more; what &s;ignifies pity? prethee, who
will pity us when we come to the <HI>Old-Baily?</HI> I
warrant you that whining old Woman that beg'd
&s;o heartily for her Two and Twenty Shillings would
let you, or I beg upon our Knees, and would not
&s;ave our Lives by not coming in for an Evidence
again&s;t us; did you ever &s;ee any of them cry when
they &s;ee Gentlemen go to the Gallows?</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>Will, &s;ays I,</HI> you had better let us keep
to the Bu&s;ine&s;s we were in before; there was no
&s;uch cruel doings in that, and yet we got more
Money by it, then I believe we &s;hall get at this.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="92">
No, no, &s;ays <HI>Will,</HI> you are a Fool, you don't know
what fine things we &s;hall do in a little while.</P>
<P>UPON this Di&s;cour&s;e we parted for that time,
but I re&s;olv'd with my &s;elf, that I would never be
concern'd with him that Way any more; the
Truth is, they were &s;uch a dreadful Gang, &s;uch
horrid barbarous Villains, that even that little
while that I was among them, my very blood run
cold in my Veins at what I heard, particularly,
the continu'd Raving and Damning one another,
and them&s;elves at every Word they &s;poke; and
then the horrid Re&s;olutions of Murther, and
cutting Throats, which I perceiv'd was in their
Minds upon any Occa&s;ion that &s;hould pre&s;ent;
this appear'd fir&s;t in their Di&s;cour&s;e upon the
Di&s;appointment they met with at <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> where
the two Rogues that were with us, ay, and <HI>Will</HI>
too damn'd and rag'd, that they could not get
into the Hou&s;e, and &s;wore they would have
cut the Gentleman's Throat, if they had got
in, and &s;hook Hands, damning and cur&s;ing them|&s;elves,
if they did not murther the whole Fami|ly,
as &s;oon as <HI>Tom</HI> (that was the Man-Servant)
could get an Opportunity to let them in.</P>
<P>TWO Days after this, <HI>Will</HI> came to my Lodging,
for I had now got a Room by my&s;elf, had bought
me tollerably good Cloaths, and &s;ome Shirts, and
began to look like other Folks, but as it happen'd
I was Abroad upon the Scout another way; for
tho' I was not harden'd enough for &s;o black a
Villain as <HI>Will</HI> would have had me be, yet I had
not arriv'd to any Principle &s;ufficient to keep me
from a Life, in its degree wicked enough, which
tended to the &s;ame De&s;truction, tho' not in &s;o vio|lent
and precipitant Degrees: I had his Me&s;|&s;age
deliver'd to me, which was to meet him the
<PB N="87" REF="93">
next Evening, at <HI>&s;uch a Place,</HI> and I came in time
enough to meet, &s;o I went to the Place, but re|&s;olv'd
before hand, that I would not go any more
with him among the Gang.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to my great Satisfaction I mi&s;s'd
him, for he did not come at all to the Place, but
met with the Gang at another Place, they having
&s;ent for him in ha&s;t upon the Notice of &s;ome Booty,
and &s;o they went all away together; this was a
Summons, it &s;eems from one of the Creatures,
which they had Abroad in a Family, where an
Opportunity offer'd them to commit a notorious
Robbery, down almo&s;t as far as <HI>Hown&s;tow,</HI> and
where they wounded a Gentleman's Gardiner &s;o,
that I think he dyed, and robb'd the Hou&s;e of a
very con&s;iderable Sum of Money and Plate.</P>
<P>THIS however was not &s;o clean carried, nor
did they get in &s;o ea&s;ie, but by the Re&s;i&s;tance they
met with, the Neighbours were all arm'd, and the
Gentlemen Rogues were pur&s;ued, and being at
<HI>London</HI> with the Booty, one of them was taken;
<HI>Will,</HI> a dexterous Fellow, and Head of the Gang,
made his E&s;cape, and tho' in his Cloths with a
great weight about him, of both Money and Plate,
plung'd into the <HI>Thames,</HI> and &s;wam over where
there was no Path, or Road, leading to the Ri|ver;
&s;o that no Body &s;u&s;pected any ones going
that way; being got over, he made his way wet
as he was into &s;ome Woods adjacent, and as
he told me afterwards, not far from <HI>Chert&s;y,</HI> and
&s;tay'd lurking about in the Woods, or Fields there
about, till his Cloaths were dry, then in the Night
got down to <HI>King&s;tone,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Mortlack,</HI> where
he got a Boat to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>HE knew nothing that one of his Comerades
was taken; only he knew that they were all &s;o
<PB N="88" REF="94">
clo&s;ely pur&s;ued that they were oblig'd to di&s;per&s;e,
and every one to &s;hift for him&s;elf: He hap|pened
to come home in the Evening as good
luck then directed him, ju&s;t after &s;earch had been
made for him by the Con&s;tables; his Companion,
who was taken, having upon promi&s;e of Favour,
and of &s;aving him from the Gallows, di&s;cover'd his
Companions, and <HI>Will</HI> among the re&s;t, as the
principal Party in the whole Undertaking.</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> got notice of this ju&s;t time enough to run
for it, and not to be taken, and away he came to
look for me; but as my good Fate &s;till directed,
I was not at home neither; however, he left all his
Booty at my Lodging, and hid it in an old Coat,
that lay under my Bedding, and left Word that
my Brother <HI>Will</HI> had been there, and had left his
Coat that he borrow'd of me, and that it was un|der
my Bed.</P>
<P>I KNEW not what to make of it, but went up
to go to Bed, and finding the Parcel, was perfect|ly
frighted to &s;ee wrap'd up in it above a Hun|dred
Pound in Plate, and Money, and yet knew
nothing of Brother <HI>Will, as he call'd him&s;elf,</HI> nor
did I hear of him in three or four Days.</P>
<P>AT the end of four Days, I heard by great Ac|cident
that <HI>Will,</HI> who us'd to be &s;een with me,
and who call'd me Brother, was taken, and would
be hang'd: Next Day a poor Man a Shoemaker,
that us$d formerly to have a kindne&s;s for me, and
to &s;end me of Errands, and give me &s;ometimes
&s;ome Victuals, &s;eeing me accidently in <HI>Ro&s;e|mary
lane,</HI> going by him, clap'd me fa&s;t hold
by the Arm, hark ye young Man, <HI>&s;ays he?</HI> have I
catch'd you, and hal'd me a long as if I had been
a Thief apprehended, and he the Con&s;table;
hark ye, <HI>Col.</HI> Jack, <HI>&s;ays he</HI> again, come a long
<PB N="89" REF="95">
with me, I mu&s;t &s;peak with you: What are you
got into this Gang too? What are you turn'd
Hou&s;e-breaker? come I'll have you hang'd to be
&s;ure.</P>
<P>THESE were dreadful Words to me, who tho'
not guilty of the particular thing in Que&s;tion,
yet was frighted hear$ily before, and did not
know what I might be charg'd with by <HI>Will,</HI> if
he was taken, as I had heard that very Morning,
he was; with the&s;e Words, the Shoemaker began
to hale and drag me a long as he us'd to do when
I was a Boy.</P>
<P>HOWEVER recovering my Spirits, and provok|ed
to the highe&s;t degree, I &s;aid to him again,
what do you mean Mr.&mdash;? let me alone, or
you will oblige me to make you do it, and with
that, I &s;top'd &s;hort, and &s;oon let him &s;ee I was
grown a little too big to be hal'd about, as I us'd,
to be, when I run of his Errands, and made a Mo|tion
with my other Hand as if I would &s;trike him
in the Face.</P>
<P>How, <HI>Jack! &s;ays he,</HI> will you &s;trike me? will
you &s;trike your old Friend? and then he let go
my Arm, and Laugh'd; well, but hark ye <HI>Col.
&s;ays he,</HI> I am in earne&s;t, I hear bad News of you;
they &s;ay you are gotten into bad Company, and
that this <HI>Will,</HI> calls you Brother; he is a great
Villain, and I hear he is Charg'd with a bloody
Robbery, and will be hang'd, if he is taken; I
hope you are not concern'd with him, if you are,
I would advi&s;e you to &s;hift for your &s;elf, for the
Con&s;table, and the Headborough are after him to
Day, and if he can lay any thing to you he will
do it you may be &s;ure; he will certainly hang
you to &s;ave him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="96">
THIS was kind, and I thank'd him, but told
him, this was a thing too Serious, and that had too
much Weight in it to be je&s;ted with, as he had
done before; and that &s;ome Ignorant Stranger
might have &s;eiz'd upon me, as a Per&s;on Guilty,
who had no farther Concern in it, than ju&s;t know|ing
the Man, and &s;o I might have been brought
into Trouble for nothing; at lea&s;t People might
have thought I was among them, whether I was
or no, and it would have rendred me &s;u&s;pected,
tho' I was Innocent.</P>
<P>HE acknowledg'd that, told me he was but in
je&s;t, and that he talk'd to me ju&s;t as he us'd to do:
However, Col. <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I wont je&s;t any more with
you, in a thing of &s;uch a dangerous Con&s;equence;
I only advi&s;e you to keep the Fellow Company
no more.</P>
<P>I THANK'D him, and went away, but in the
greate&s;t perplexity Imaginable; and now not
knowing what to do with my &s;elf, or with the lit|tle
ill-gotten Wealth which I had; I went mu&s;ing,
and alone into the Fields towards <HI>Stepney,</HI> my
u&s;ual Walk; and there began to con&s;ider what to
do, and as this Creature had left his Prize in my
Garret, I began to think, that if he &s;hould be ta|ken
and &s;hould Confe&s;s, and &s;end the Officers to

<P>AY, <HI>&s;ays Will,</HI> I am undone for all that; for

this Morning and carried to <HI>Newgate;</HI> how! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI>
this Morning! yes, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> this Morning, at 4 a
Clock, he is Charg'd with a Robbery and Mur|ther;
&s;ome where beyond <HI>Brentford,</HI> and that
which is wor&s;e, is, that he is Impeach'd by one of
the Gang, who to &s;ave his own Life, has turn'd
Evidence; and therefore you had be&s;t con&s;ider,
<HI>&s;ays the Capt.</HI> what you have to do: What I have

to do! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and what do you mean by that?
Nay, Col. <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> don't be angry, you know be&s;t
if you are not in Danger; I am glad of it, but I
doubt not but you were with them: No, not I,

have been with them at other times; and 'twill
be all one: Not I, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you are quite mi&s;taken,
I am none of their Gang; they are above my
Quality; with &s;uch, and a little more talk of that
kind we parted, and Capt. <HI>Jack</HI> went away;
but as he went, I ob&s;erv'd, he &s;hook his Head,
&s;eem'd to have more Concern upon him, than I
at fir&s;t apprehended; and indeed, more than he
cou'd he &s;uppos'd to have, meerly on my Account,
of which we &s;hall hear more very quickly.</P>
<P>I WAS Extreamly allarm'd when I heard <HI>Will</HI>
was in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and had I known where to have
gone, would certainly have fled as far as Legs
would have carry'd me; my very Joints trembl'd,
and I was ready to &s;ink into the Ground, and all
that Evening, and that Night following, I was
in the uttermo&s;t Con&s;ternation; my Head run
upon nothing but <HI>Newgate,</HI> and the Gallows, and
being Hang'd, which I &s;aid I de&s;erv'd, if it were
for nothing but taking that two and twenty Shil|lings
from the poor old Nur&s;e.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing my perplex'd Thoughts allow'd
me to take care of, was my Money: This indeed lay
in a little Compa&s;s, and I carried it generally all
about me; I had got together as you will perceive
by the pa&s;t Account, above Sixty Pounds, for I
&s;pent nothing, and what to do with it I knew not,
at la&s;t it came into my Head, that I would go to
my Benefactor, the Clerk, at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-bou&s;e,</HI> if
he was to be found; and &s;ee if I could get him to
<PB N="95" REF="101">
take the re&s;t of my Money; the only Bu&s;ine&s;s was
to make a plau&s;ible Story to him, that he might
not wonder how I came by &s;o much Money.</P>
<P>BUT my Invention quickly &s;upply'd that want;
there was a Suit of Cloths at one of our Hou&s;es of
Rendezvous, which was left there for any of the
Gang to put on upon particular Occa&s;ions, as a
Di&s;gui&s;e: This was Green Livery, Lac'd with
Pink Colour'd Galloon, and lin'd with the &s;ame;
an Edg'd Hat, a pair of Boots, and a Whip, I
went and Dre&s;s'd my &s;elf up in this Livery, and
went to my Gentleman, to his Hou&s;e in <HI>Tower|&s;treet;</HI>
and there I found him in Health, and Well,
ju&s;t the &s;ame hone&s;t Gentleman, as ever.</P>
<P>HE &s;tar'd at me when fir&s;t I came to him, for I
meet him ju&s;t at his Door; I &s;ay he &s;tar'd at me,

not knowing me in the lea&s;t, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to me, Do&s;t

&s;aid, yes, Sir, I believe your Wor&s;hip (I had
learnt &s;ome Manners now) does not know me; I

Recollecting me pre&s;ently, &s;ays he, <HI>who</HI> Col.

the Intere&s;t of it too.</P>
<P>I Cring'd, and Bow'd, and told him, I did not

<P>No, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if your Wor&s;hip would plea&s;e,

<P>No, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but I have had a good place.</P>

<P>Why, and plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, my old Ma&s;ter,

<P>And what prethee <HI>Jack,</HI> what ha&s;t thou brought

<P>I CAME away exceeding Joyful, made him
abundance of Bows, and Scrapes, and went
immediately to &s;hift my Cloaths again, with a
Re&s;olution to run away from <HI>London,</HI> and &s;ee it no
more for a great while; but I was &s;urpris'd the
very next Morning, when going cro&s;s <HI>Re&s;emary|lane,</HI>
by the End of the Place, which is call'd
<HI>Rag-Fair,</HI> I heard one call <HI>Jack,</HI> he had &s;aid &s;ome|thing
before, which I did not hear, but upon
hearing the Name <HI>Jack,</HI> I look'd about me, imme|diately
&s;aw three Men, and after them a Con&s;ta|ble
coming towards me with great Fury; I was
in a great Surprize, and &s;tarted to run, but one
of them clap'd in upon me, and got hold of me,
and in a Moment the re&s;t &s;urrounded me, and
I was taken, I ask'd them what they wanted,
and what I had done; they told me it was no
Place to Talk of that there; but &s;how'd me their
Warrant, and bad me read it, and I &s;hould know
the re&s;t when I came before the Ju&s;tice, &s;o they
hurried me away.</P>
<P>I took the Warrant, but to my great Affliction,
I could know nothing by that, for I could not
read, &s;o I de&s;ir'd them to read it, and they read
it that they were to Apprehend a known Thief,
that went by the Name of one of the three <HI>Jacks</HI> of

<HI>Rag$ Fair,</HI> for that he was Charg'd upon Oath, with

<P>IT was to no purpo&s;e for me to deny it, or to
&s;ay I knew nothing of it, that was none of their
Bu&s;ine&s;s they &s;aid; that mu&s;t be di&s;puted, they told
me, before the Ju&s;tice, where I would find that it
was &s;worn po&s;itively again&s;t me, and then per|haps
I might be better &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>I HAD no remedy, but Patience, and as my
Heart was full of Terror and Guilt, &s;o I was ready
to die with the weight of it; as they carried me a
long, for as I very well knew that I was Guilty
of the fir&s;t Days work, tho' I was not of the
la&s;t; &s;o I did not doubt, but I &s;hould be &s;ent
to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and then I took it for granted I
mu&s;t be hang'd; for to go to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and to be
hang'd were to me, as things which nece&s;&s;arily
followed one another.</P>
<P>BUT I had a &s;harp Conflict to go thro' before
it came to that Part, and that was before the Ju|&s;tice,

your Name, let me do you Ju&s;tice, you are not

Capt. <HI>Jack?</HI> or are you u&s;ually call'd &s;o?</P>
<P>I pre&s;ently found, that the Men that took me
knew nothing of me, and that the Con&s;table had
taken me up by Hear-&s;ay, &s;o I took Heart and told
the Ju&s;tice, that I thought with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that it
was not the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion, what my Name was,
but what the&s;e Men, or any one el&s;e had to lay to
to my Charge, whether I was the Per&s;on, who the

was granted: They us'd many Words to in&s;i|nuate
that I was the Per&s;on, and that I knew it
well enough, and that I &s;hould be oblig'd to tell
my Name.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;ted on the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of it, and
that I &s;hould not be oblig'd to accu&s;e my&s;elf, and
the Ju&s;tice told them in &s;o many Words, that he
could not force me to it, that I might do it if I

would indeed; but you &s;ee, <HI>&s;ays the Ju&s;tice,</HI> he under|&s;tood

his Wor&s;hip, in which time I pleaded again&s;t

produce the Accu&s;er, or he mu&s;t Di&s;charge me.</P>
<P>I WAS greatly encouraged at this, and argued
with the more Vigour for my&s;elf; at length the

that I knew him not, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> that it was

the Ju&s;tice talk'd to me, told me I was
born to better Things, and that by my
well managing of my own Defence, he
did not que&s;tion but I had been well Edu|cated,
and that he was &s;orry I &s;hould fall
into &s;uch a Misfortune as this, which he
hop'd however would be no Di&s;honour to
me, &s;ince I was &s;o hand&s;omely acquitted.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="108">
THO' his Wor&s;hip was mi&s;taken in the Matter
of my Education, yet it had this good Effect upon
me, that I re&s;olv'd if it was po&s;&s;ible I would learn
to Read and Write, that I would not be &s;uch an un|capable
Creature, that I &s;hould not be able to read
a Warrant, and &s;ee whether I was the Per&s;on to
be Apprehended or not.</P>
<P>BUT there was &s;omething more in all this,
$word$ what I have taken notice of; for in a Word,
it appear'd plainly that my Brother Capt. <HI>Jack,</HI>
who had the forwardne&s;s to put it to me, whether
I was among them, or no, when in Truth he was
there him&s;elf, had the only Rea&s;on to be afraid
to flye, at the &s;ame time, that he advi&s;ed me to
$word$ for my &s;elf.</P>
<P>As this pre&s;ently occur'd to my Thoughts;
&s;o I made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire, and find
him out, and to give $im notice of it.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, being now Confident of my
own Safety, I had no more Concern upon my
Mind about my&s;elf; but now I began to be anxi|ous
for poor <HI>Will,</HI> my Ma&s;ter and Tutor in Wick|edne&s;s,
who was now fa&s;t by the Heels in <HI>New|gate,</HI>
while I was happily at Liberty, and I want|ed
very much to go and &s;ee him, and accordingly
did &s;o.</P>
<P>I FOUND him in a &s;ad Condition loaden with
heavy Irons, and had him&s;elf no pro&s;pect or
hope of E&s;caping; he told me he &s;hould
die, but bid me be ea&s;ie; for as it would do
him no good to accu&s;e me, who never was out
with any of them, but that once; &s;o I might de|pend
upon it, he would not bring me into the
Trouble; as for the Rogue, who had betray'd them
all, he was not able to hurt me, for I might be
&s;atisfied he had never &s;een me in his Life; but
<PB N="103" REF="109">
Col. <HI>Jack, &s;ays he,</HI> I will tell you who was with
us, and that is your Brother the Captain,
and the Villain has certainly nam'd him, and
therefore, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you can give him
timely Notice of it, do, that he may make his
E&s;cape.</P>
<P>HE &s;aid a great many things to warn me of
following the &s;teps he had led me; I was far out
<HI>Jack, &s;aid he,</HI> when I told you to be a notorious
Thief, was to live like a Gentleman; he chiefly
di&s;cover'd his concern that they had, as he fear'd
killed the Gentleman's Gardiner, and that he in
particular had given him a Wound in the Neck,
of which he was afraid he would die.</P>
<P>HE had a great Sum of Money in Gold about
him, being the &s;ame that I had carried back to him
at the Hay-Stack; and he had concealed it &s;o well,
that tho&s;e that took him had not found it, and he
gave me the greate&s;t Part of it, to carry to his
Mother, which I very hone&s;tly delivered, and
came away with a heavy Heart; nor did I ever
&s;ee him &s;ince, for he was Executed in about three
Weeks time after, being condemn'd that very next
Se&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I HAD nothing to do now, but to find the Capt.
who tho' not without &s;ome trouble, I at la&s;t got
News of, and told him the whole Story, and
how I had been taken up for him by mi&s;take, and
was come off, but that the Warrant was &s;till out for
him, and very &s;trict &s;earch after him; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> tel|ling
him all this, he pre&s;ently di&s;cover'd by his
&s;urprize that he was Guilty, and after a few
Words more, told me plainly it was all true; that
he was in the Robbery, and that he had the great|e&s;t
Part of the Booty in keeping, but what to
do with it, or him&s;elf he did not know, and
<PB N="104" REF="110">
wanted me to tell him, which I was very unfit to
do, for I knew nothing of the World; then he
told me, he had a Mind to fly into <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
was ea&s;ie to be done, and ask'd me if I would go
with him: I told him I would with all my Heart, if I
had Money enough to bear the Charge; he had the
Trade &s;till in his Eyes by his an&s;wer, I warrant
you, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we will make the Journey pay our
Charge; I dare not think of going any more up|on
the Adventure, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> be&s;ides, if we meet with
any Mi&s;fortune out of our Knowledge, we &s;hall
never get out of it, we &s;hall be undone; nay,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we &s;hall find no Mercy here, if they can
catch us, and they can do no wor&s;e Abroad, I am
for venturing at all.</P>
<P>WELL, but Captain, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> have you Husbanded
your time &s;o ill, that you have no Money to &s;up|ply
you in &s;uch a Time as this; I have very little
indeed, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> for I have had bad luck lately;
but he lyed, for he had a great Share of the Booty
they had got at their la&s;t Adventure, as above, and
as the re&s;t complain'd, he and <HI>Will</HI> had got almo&s;t
all of it, and kept the re&s;t out of their Shares,
which made them the willinger to di&s;cover them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it was, he own'd about 22<HI>l.</HI> he had
in Money, and &s;omething that would yield Mo|ney,
I &s;uppo&s;e it was Plate; but he would not
tell me what it was, or where it was, but he &s;aid,
he dur&s;t not go to fetch it, for he &s;hould be be|tray'd
and &s;eiz'd, &s;o he would venture without it;
&s;ure, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we &s;hall come back again &s;ome time,
or other.</P>
<P>I hone&s;tly produc'd all the Money I had, which
was Sixteen Pound, and &s;ome odd Shillings: Now,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> if we are good Husbands, and Travel fru|gally,
this will carry us quite out of Danger, for
<PB N="105" REF="111">
we had both been a&s;&s;ur'd, that when we came out
of <HI>England,</HI> we &s;hould be both Safe, and no Bo|dy
could Hurt us, tho' they had known us; but
we neither of us thought it was &s;o many weary
&s;teps to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as we found it.</P>
<P>I &s;peak of my&s;elf, as in the &s;ame Circum|&s;tances
of Danger, with Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> but it was
only thus, I was in as much Fear as he, but not
in quite as much Danger.</P>
<P>I cannot omit that in the Interval of the&s;e
things, and a few Days before I carried my Mo|ney
to the Gentleman in <HI>Tower-&s;treet;</HI> I took a
Walk all alone into the Fields, in order to go to
<HI>Kenti&s;h-Town,</HI> and do Ju&s;tice to the poor old Nur&s;e;
it happen'd that before I was aware I cro&s;s'd a
Field that came to the very Spot where I robb'd
the poor old Woman, and that Maid, or where I
&s;hould &s;ay <HI>Will,</HI> made me rob them; my Heart
had reproach'd me many a time with that cruel
Action, and many a time I had promis'd to my|&s;elf
that I would find a way to make her Satis|faction,
and re&s;tore her Money, and that Day I
had Set a part for the Work; but was a little &s;ur|priz'd
that I was &s;o &s;uddenly upon the unhappy
Spot.</P>
<P>THE Place brought to my Mind the Villany I
had committed there, and &s;omething &s;truck me
with a kind of Wi&s;h, I cannot &s;ay Prayer, for
I know not what that meant, that I might leave
off that curs'd Trade; and &s;aid to my&s;elf, O! that
I had &s;ome Trade to live by, I would never rob
no more, for &s;ure 'tis a wicked abominable Thing.</P>
<P>HERE indeed I felt the lo&s;s of what ju&s;t Pa|rents
do, and ought to do by all their Children; I
mean being bred to &s;ome Trade, or Employment,
and I wept many times, that I knew not what to
<PB N="106" REF="112">
do, or what to turn my Hand to, tho' I re&s;olved to
leave off the wicked Cour&s;e I was in.</P>
<P>BUT to return to my Journey, I ask'd my way
to <HI>Kenti&s;h-Town,</HI> and it happen'd to be of a poor
Woman, that &s;aid &s;he liv'd there, upon which In|telligence
I ask'd, if &s;he knew a Woman that lived
there, who&s;e Name was <HI>Smith?</HI> She an&s;wer'd, yes,
very well, that &s;he was not a &s;ettled Inhabitant,
only a Lodger in the Town, but that &s;he was an
hone&s;t poor indu&s;trious Woman, and by her La|bour
and Pains, maintain'd a poor di&s;eas'd Hus|band,
that had been unable to help him&s;elf &s;ome
Years.</P>
<P>WHAT a Villain have I been! <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> to my|&s;elf,
that I &s;hould rob &s;uch a poor Woman as this,
and add Grief, and Tears to her Mi&s;ery, and to
the Sorrows of her Hou&s;e? This quicken'd my
Re&s;olution to re&s;tore her Money, and not only
&s;o, but I re&s;olv'd I would give her &s;omething o|ver
and above her Lo&s;s; &s;o I went forward, and
by the Direction I had receiv'd, found her Lodging
with very little Trouble; then asking for the
Woman, &s;he came to the Door immediately, for
&s;he heard me ask for her by her Name; of a little
Girl that came fir&s;t to the Door; I pre&s;ently &s;poke
to her, Dame, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> was not you robb'd about a
Year ago, as you was coming home from <HI>London,</HI>
about <HI>Pindar of Wakefields?</HI> yes indeed I was, <HI>&s;ays
&s;he,</HI> and &s;adly frighted into the Bargain; and how
much did you lo&s;e? <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> indeed, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I lo&s;t all
the Money I had in the World; I am &s;ure I work'd
hard for it, it was Money for keeping a Nur&s;e
Child, that I had then, and I had been at <HI>Lon|don</HI>
to receive it; but how much was it Dame?
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> why, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> it was Two and Twenty Shil|lings
and Six-Pence Half-penny; One and Twen|ty
<PB N="107" REF="113">
Shillings I had been to fetch, and the odd Mo|ney
was my own before.</P>
<P>WELL, look you good Woman, what will you
&s;ay if I &s;hould put you in a way to get your Mo|ney
again; for I believe the Fellow that took it
is fa&s;t enough now, and perhaps I may do you a
kindne&s;s in it, and for that I came to &s;ee you? O
Dear, &s;ays the old Woman, I under&s;tand you,
but indeed I cannot Swear to the Man's Face a|gain;
for it was Dark, and be&s;ides, I would not
Hang the poor Wretch for my Money, let him
live and Repent: That is very kind, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> more
than he de&s;erves from you, but you need not be
Concern'd about that, for he will be Hang'd, whe|ther
you appear again&s;t him or not: But are you
willing to have your Money again that you lo&s;t?
Yes, indeed, &s;ays the Woman, I &s;hould be glad
of that, for I have not been &s;o hard put to it for
Money a great while, as I am now; I have much
a do to find us Bread to Eat, though I work hard
early and late, and with that &s;he Cryed.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT it would have broke my very
Heart, to think how this poor Creature work'd,
and was a Slave at near Three&s;core, and that I a
young Fellow of hardly Twenty, &s;hould Rob her
of her Bread to Support my Idlene&s;s, and Wicked
Life; and the Tears came from my Eyes, in &s;pight
of all my &s;trugling to prevent it, and the Woman
perceiv'd it too; poor Woman, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> 'tis a &s;ad thing
&s;uch Creatures as the&s;e &s;hould plunder, and &s;trip
&s;uch a poor Object as thou art; well, he is at
Lei&s;ure now to Repent it, I a&s;&s;ure you; I perceive
Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you are very Compa&s;&s;ionate, indeed,
I wi&s;h he may Improve the time God has &s;par'd
him, and that he may Repent, and I pray God
give him Repentance, who ever he is, I forgive
<PB N="108" REF="114">
him, whether he can make me Recompence, or not,
and I pray God forgive him, I won't do him any
Prejudice, not I; and that &s;he went on Praying
for me.</P>
<P>WELL, Dame, come hither to me, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and
with that I put my Hand in my Pocket, and &s;he
came to me: Hold up your Hand, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> which
&s;he did, and I told her Nine half Crowns into
her Hand; there Dame, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> is your 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> you
lo&s;t, I a&s;&s;ure you, Dame, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I have been the
chief In&s;trument to get it of him for you; for
ever &s;ince he told me the Story of it among the
re&s;t of his wicked Exploits; I never gave him any
re&s;t till I made him promi&s;e me to make you Re&s;ti|tution:
All the while I held her Hand, and put the
Money into it, I look'd in her Face, and I per|ceiv'd
her Colour come, and go, and that &s;he was
under the greate&s;t Surprize of Joy Imaginable.</P>
<P>WELL, God ble&s;s him, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> and &s;pare him
from the Di&s;a&s;ter he is afraid of, if it be his will;
for &s;ure, this is an Act of &s;o much Ju&s;tice, and &s;o
Hone&s;t, that I never expected the like; &s;he run
on a great while &s;o, and wept for him; when I
told her, I doubted there was no room to expect
his Life: Well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> then pray God give him
Repentance, and bring him to Heaven, for &s;ure
he mu&s;t have &s;omething that is Good at the But|tom;
he has a Principle of Hone&s;ty at Bottom, to
be &s;ure; however, he may have been brought in|to
bad Cour&s;es, by bad Company, and evil Exam|ple,
or other Temptations: But I dare &s;ay he will
be brought to Repentance, one time or other, be|fore
he Dies.</P>
<P>ALL this touch'd me nearer than &s;he Imagin'd,
for I was the Man that &s;he pray'd for all this
while; though &s;he did not know it, and in my
Heart I &s;aid <HI>Amen</HI> to it; for I was &s;en&s;ible that I
<PB N="109" REF="115">
had done one of the vile&s;t Actions, in the World,
in attacking a poor Creature in &s;uch a Condition,
and not li&s;&s;ening to her Entreaties, when &s;he
begg'd &s;o heartily for that little Money we took
from her.</P>
<P>IN a Word, the good Woman &s;o mov'd me
with her Charitable Prayers; that I put my Hand
in my Pocket again for her, Dame, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you
are &s;o Charitable in your Petitions for this mi&s;era|ble
Creature, that it puts me in Mind of one thing
more, which I will do for him, whether he order'd
me or not; and that is, to ask you Forgivene&s;s
for the Thief in robbing you, for it was an Of|fence,
and a Tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t you, as well as an
Injury to you; and therefore I ask your Pardon
for him, will you Sincerely and Heartily forgive
him, Dame? I do de&s;ire it of you; and with that
I &s;tood up, and with my Hat off, ask'd her Par|don;
O Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> do not &s;tand up, and with
your Hat off to me, I am a poor Woman, I for|give
him, and all that were with him; for there
was one or more with him, I forgive them with
all my Heart; and I pray God to forgive them.</P>
<P>WELL, Dame, then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> to make you &s;ome
Recompence for your Charity; there is &s;omething
for you more than your Lo&s;s; and with that I
gave her a Crown more.</P>
<P>THEN I ask'd her, who that was, who was robb'd
with her? She &s;aid, it was a Servant Maid that
liv'd then in the Town, but &s;he was gone from
her place, and &s;he did not know where &s;he liv'd
now: Well Dame, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> if ever you do hear of
her, let her leave Word where &s;he may be found;
and if I live to come and &s;ee you again, I will get
the Money of him for her too; I think that was
but little, was it, no, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> it was but 5<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="116">
which I knew as well as &s;he; well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> Dame,
enquire her out if you have Opportunity; &s;o &s;he
promis'd me &s;he would, and away I came.</P>
<P>THE Satisfaction this gave me, was very much,
but then a Natural Con&s;equence attended it,
which fill'd me with Reflection afterwards, and
this was, that by the &s;ame Rule, I ought to make
Re&s;titution to all that I had wrong'd, in the like
manner; and what cou'd I do, as to that? To this
I knew not what to &s;ay; and &s;o the Thought in
time wore off, for in &s;hort it was impo&s;&s;ible to be
done: I had not Ability, neither did I know any
of the People who I had &s;o Injur'd, and that &s;a|tisfying
me for the pre&s;ent, I let it Drop.</P>
<P>I COME now to my Journey, with Capt. <HI>Jack,</HI>
my &s;uppos'd Brother: We &s;et out from <HI>London</HI> on
Foot, and Travel'd the fir&s;t Day to <HI>Ware,</HI> for we
had learnt &s;o much of our Road, that the way lay
thro' that Town; we were weary enough the fir&s;t
Day, having not been us'd at all to Travelling;
but we made &s;hift to walk once up and down the
Town, after we came into it.</P>
<P>I SOON found, that his walking out to &s;ee the
Town, was not to &s;atisfie his Curio&s;ity in viewing
the Place; for he had no Notion of any thing of
that Kind, but to &s;ee if he cou'd light of any Pur|cha&s;e,
for he was &s;o natural a Thief, that he cou'd
&s;ee nothing on the Road, but it occur'd to him;
how ea&s;ily that might be taken, and how cleverly
this might be carry'd off, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING offer'd in <HI>Ware</HI> to his Mind, it not
being Market-Day, and as for me, tho' I made
no great &s;cruple of Eating and Drinking at the
Co&s;t of his Roguery, yet I re&s;olv'd not to enter
upon any thing, <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> nor to take the
lea&s;t thing from any Body.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="117">
WHEN the Captain found me re&s;olv'd upon
the Negative, he ask'd me, how I thought to Tra|vel?
I ask'd him what he thought of him&s;elf,
that was &s;ure to be hang'd, if he was taken, how
&s;mall &s;oever the Crime was, that he &s;hould be
taken for? How can that be? <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> they don't
know me in the Country; ay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but do you
think they do not &s;end up Word to <HI>Newgate</HI> as
&s;oon as any Thief is taken in the Country, and
&s;o enquire who is e&s;cap'd from them, or who
is fled, that they may be &s;topp'd? a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> the Jaylors Corre&s;pond with one another,
with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s imaginable; and if
you were taken here but for &s;tealing a Basket of
Eggs, you &s;hall have your Accu&s;er &s;ent down to
&s;ee if he knows you.</P>
<P>THIS terrify'd him a little for a while, and
kept him hone&s;t, for three or four Days; but it
was but for a few Days indeed; for he play'd a
great many Rogues Tricks without me, till at
la&s;t he came to his End without me too, tho' it
was not till many Years after, as you &s;hall hear
in its Order; but as the&s;e Exploits are no
part of my Story, but of his, who&s;e Life and
Exploits are &s;ufficient to make a Volume larger
than this by it&s;elf; &s;o I &s;hall omit every thing,
but what I was particularly concern'd in, during
this tedious Journey.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Ware</HI> we Travell'd to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> tho'
that was not our direct Road, the occa&s;ion was
this$; in our way going thro' a Village, call'd
<HI>Puckeridge,</HI> we baited at an <HI>Inn,</HI> at the Sign of
the <HI>Faulcon,</HI> and while we were there, a Country|man
comes to the <HI>Inn,</HI> and hangs his Hor&s;e at the
Door, while he goes in to Drink; we &s;at in the
Gate-way, having called for a Mug of Beer, and
<PB N="112" REF="118">
drank it up: We had been talking with the Ho&s;t|ler
about the way to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and he had bid us
ask the Road to <HI>Roy&s;ton; but &s;ays he,</HI> there is a
Turning ju&s;t here a little farther, you mu&s;t not
go that Way, for that goes to <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>WE had paid for our Beer, and &s;at at the Door,
only to re&s;t us, when on the &s;udden, comes a
Gentleman's Coach to the Door, and three or
four Hor&s;emen; the Hor&s;emen rod into the Yard,
and the Ho&s;tler was oblig'd to go in with them;
<HI>&s;ays be,</HI> to the Captain, young Man pray take
hold of the Hor&s;e, meaning the Countryman's
Hor&s;e, I mention'd above, and take him out of
the way, that the Coach may come up; he did &s;o,
and beckon'd to me to follow him; we walked to|gether
to the Turning, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to me, do you &s;tep
afore, and turn up the <HI>Lane,</HI> I'll overtake you;
&s;o I went on up the <HI>Lane,</HI> and in a few Minutes
he was got up upon the Hor&s;e, and at my Heels,
come get up, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we will have a lift, if we
don't get the Hor&s;e by the Bargain.</P>
<P>I MADE no difficulty to get up behind him, and
away we went at a good round Rate, it being a good
&s;trong Hor&s;e: We lo&s;t no time for an Hours
riding, and more, by which time we thought we
were out of the reach of being pur&s;ued, and as
the Countryman, when he &s;hould mi&s;s his Hor&s;e,
would hear that we enquir'd the way to <HI>Roy&s;ton,</HI>
he would certainly pur&s;ue us that way, and not
towards <HI>Cambridge,</HI> we went ea&s;ier after the fir&s;t
Hours riding, and coming thro' a Town or two
we a lighted by Turns, and did not ride Double
thro' the Villages.</P>
<P>Now as it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Captain to pa&s;s
by any thing that he could lay his Hand on, and
not take it, &s;o now having a Hor&s;e to carry it
<PB N="113" REF="119">
off too, the Temptation was the &s;tronger; going
thro' a Village, where a good Hou&s;ewife of the
Hou&s;e had been Wa&s;hing, and hung her Cloths
out upon a Hedge, near the Road, he could not help
it, but got hold of a Couple of good Shirts, that
were but about half dry, and over-took me upon
the Spur; for I walk'd on Foot before; I imme|diately
got up behind, and away we Gallop'd to|gether
as fa&s;t as the Hor&s;e would well go; in this
Part of our Expedition his good luck or Mine,
carried us quite out of the Road, and having
&s;een no Body to ask the way of, we lo&s;t our &s;elves,
and wandered I know not how many Miles to
the Right Hand, till Partly by that means, and
Partly by the Occa&s;ion following, we came quite
into the Coach Road to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> from <HI>London,</HI>
by <HI>Bi&s;hop-Stortford;</HI> the particular Occa&s;ion that
made me wander on was thus; the Country was
all open Cornfields, no Enclo&s;ures; when being
upon a little ri&s;ing Ground, I Bad him &s;top the
Hor&s;e, for I would get down, and walk a little
to ea&s;e my Legs, being tyr'd with riding &s;o long
behind without Stirrups; when I was down, and
look'd a little about me; I &s;aw plainly the Great
white Road, which we &s;hould have gone at near
two Miles from us.</P>
<P>ON a &s;udden, looking a little back to my Left,
upon that Road, I &s;aw four or five Hor&s;emen,
riding full Speed, &s;ome a good way before the o|ther,
and hurring on as People in a full pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>IT immediately &s;truck me; Ha, Brother <HI>Jack,
&s;ays I,</HI> get off of the Hor&s;e this Moment, and
ask why afterwards; &s;o he jumps off, What's the
matter? <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the matter, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> look yonder,
'tis well we have lo&s;t our Way; do you &s;ee how
they ride, they are pur&s;uing us you may depend
<PB N="114" REF="120">
upon it, either, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you are pur&s;ued from the
la&s;t Village for the two Shirts, or from <HI>Puckeridge,</HI>
for the Hor&s;e. He had &s;o much Pre&s;ence of Mind,
that without my mentioning it to him, he puts
back the Hor&s;e behind a great white-Thorn Bu&s;h,
which grew ju&s;t by him; &s;o that they could by no
means &s;ee the Hor&s;e, which we being ju&s;t at the
Top of the Hill they might otherwi&s;e have done,
and &s;o have pur&s;ued that way at a venture.</P>
<P>BUT as it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;ee the
Hor&s;e, &s;o was it as impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;ee us
at that di&s;tance, who &s;at down on the Ground to
look at them the more &s;ecurely.</P>
<P>THE Road winding about, we &s;aw them a great
way, and they rod as fa&s;t as they could make
their Hor&s;es go; when we found they were gone
quite out of Sight, we mounted, and made the
be&s;t of our way al&s;o; and indeed, tho' we were
two upon one Hor&s;e, yet we abated no &s;peed
where the way would admit of it, not enquiring of
any Body the way to any where, till after a|bout
two Hours riding, we came to a Town, which
upon Enquiry, they call'd <HI>Che&s;terford,</HI> and here
we &s;topp'd, and ask'd not our way to any Place, but
whether that Road went, and were told it was the
Coach Road to <HI>Cambridge;</HI> al&s;o that it was the
Way to <HI>New-Market,</HI> to St. <HI>Edmunds-Bury,</HI> to <HI>Nor|wich</HI>
and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> to <HI>Lyn,</HI> and to <HI>Ely,</HI> and the
like.</P>
<P>WE &s;taid here a good while believing our&s;elves
&s;ecure, and afterwards towards Evening went
forward to a Place, call'd <HI>Bourn-Bridge,</HI> where
the Road to <HI>Cambridge</HI> turns away out of
the Road to <HI>New-Market,</HI> and where there are
but two Hou&s;es only, both of them being <HI>Inns&punc;</HI>
Here the Captain <HI>&s;ays to me,</HI> Hark ye, you &s;ee
<PB N="115" REF="121">
we are pur&s;ued towards <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and &s;hall be
&s;top'd if we go thither; now <HI>New-Market</HI> is but
ten Miles off, and there we may be &s;afe, and per|haps
get an opportunity to do &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Look ye, <HI>Jack, &s;aid I,</HI> talk no more of doing
Bu&s;ine&s;s, for I will not joyn with you in any
thing of that Kind; I would fain get you to <HI>Scotland,</HI>
before you get a Halter about your Neck, I will
not have you hang'd in <HI>England,</HI> if I can help it,
and therefore I won't go to <HI>New-Market,</HI> unle&s;s
you will promi&s;e me to make no fal&s;e &s;teps there:
Well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if I mu&s;t not, then I won't; but I hope
you will let us get another Hor&s;e, won't you?
that we may Travel fa&s;ter; no, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I won't
agree to that, but if you will let me &s;end this
Hor&s;e back fairly, I will tell you how we &s;hall
hire Hor&s;es afterwards, for one Stage&punc; or two, and
then take them as far as we plea&s;e; 'tis only &s;end|ing
a Letter to the Owner to &s;end for him, and
then, if we are &s;topp'd, it can do us but little
Hurt.</P>
<P>You are a wary Politick Gentleman, <HI>&s;ays the
Captain,</HI> but, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> we are better as we are; for
we are out of all Danger of being &s;topp'd on the
Way after we are gone from this Place.</P>
<P>WE had not Parl'd thus long; but tho' in the Dead
of the Night, came a Man to the other <HI>Inn</HI> Door,
for as above, there are two <HI>Inns</HI> at that Place, and
call'd for a Pot of Beer, but the People were all
in Bed, and would not Ri&s;e; he ask'd them if
they had &s;een two Fellows come that way upon
one Hor&s;e: The Man, <HI>&s;aid he had,</HI> that they went
by in the Afternoon, and ask'd the Way to <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI>
but did not &s;top only to drink one M$g: O!
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> are they gone to <HI>Cambridge?</HI> then I'll be
with them quickly: I was awake in a little Gar|ret
<PB N="116" REF="122">
of the next Inn, where we Lodg'd; and hear|ing
the F$llow call at the Door, got up, and went
to the Window, having &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at every
Noi&s;e I heard; and by that means heard the whole
Story: New, the ca&s;e is plain, our Hour was not
come, our Fate had Determin'd other things for
us, and we were to be re&s;erv'd for it, the matter
was thus; when we fir&s;t came to <HI>Bourn-Bridge,</HI>
we call'd at the fir&s;t Hou&s;e, and ask'd the Way to
<HI>Cambridge,</HI> Drank a Mug of Beer, and went on,
and they might &s;ee us turn off to go the way they
Directed; but Night coming on, and we being
very Weary, we thought we &s;hould not find the
way; and we came back in the Dusk of the Even|ing,
and went into the other Hou&s;e, being the
fir&s;t as we came back, as that where we call$d be|fore,
was the fir&s;t, as we went forward.</P>
<P>YOU may be &s;ure I was allarm'd now, as indeed
I had Rea&s;on to be; the Captain was in Bed, and
fa&s;t a Sleep, but I Wak'd him, and Rouz'd him
with a Noi&s;e that frighted him enough; Ri&s;e, <HI>Jack,
&s;aid I,</HI> we are both Ruin'd, they are come after us
hither; indeed, I was wrong to terrify him at that
Rate; for he &s;tarted, and jumpt out of Bed, and
run directly to the Window, not knowing where
he was; and not quite awake, was ju&s;t going
to Jump out of the Window, but I laid hold of
him; what are you going to do? <HI>Says I,</HI> I won't be
taken, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> let me alone, <HI>where are they?</HI></P>
<P>THIS was all Confu&s;ion, and he was &s;o out of
him&s;elf with the Fright; and being overcome
with Sleep, that I had much to do to prevent his
jumping out of the Window: However, I held
him fa&s;t, and thoroughly waken'd him, and then
all was well again, and he was pre&s;ently compos'd.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123">
THEN I told him the Story, and we &s;at toge|ther
upon the Bed-&s;ide; con&s;idering, what we
&s;hould do: Upon the whole, as the Fellow that
call'd, was apparently gone on to <HI>Cambridge;</HI> we
had nothing to &s;ear, but to be quiet till Day break,
and then to Mount and be gone.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, as &s;oon as Day peep'd, we
were up, and having happily inform'd our&s;elves
of the Road at the other Hou&s;e; and being told
that the Road to <HI>Cambridge</HI> turn'd off on the left
Hand, and that the Road to <HI>New-Market</HI> lay &s;trait
forward; I &s;ay, having learn't this, the Captain
told me he would walk away on Foot towards
<HI>New-Market;</HI> and &s;o when I came to go out, I
&s;hould appear as a &s;ingle Traveller; accordingly
he went out immediately, and away he walk'd,
and he Travell'd &s;o hard, that when I came to fol|low,
I thought once that he had Dropp'd me, for
tho' I Rid hard, I got no &s;ight of him for an Hour;
at length having pa&s;s'd the great Bank call'd the
<HI>Divel's-Ditch,</HI> I found him, and took him up be|hind
me, and we Rode Double till we came al|mo&s;t
to the end of <HI>New-Market</HI> Town; ju&s;t at the
hither Hou&s;e in the Town, &s;tood a Hor&s;e at a
Door, ju&s;t as it was at <HI>Puckeridge:</HI> Now, <HI>&s;ays
Jack,</HI> if the Hor&s;e was at the other end of the
Town, I would have him, as &s;ure as we had the
'tother at <HI>Puckeridge;</HI> but it would not do, &s;o he
got down, and Walk'd thro' the Town on the right
Hand &s;ide of the Way.</P>
<P>HE had not got half thro' the Town, but the
Hor&s;e having &s;ome how or other got loo&s;e, came
Trotting gently on by him&s;elf, a$d no body fol|lowing
him; the Captain, an old Soldier at &s;uch
Work, as &s;oon as the Hor&s;e was got a pretry way
before him, and that he &s;aw no Body follow'd,
<PB N="118" REF="124">
&s;ets up a run after the Hor&s;e; and the Hor&s;e hear|ing
him follow, run the fa&s;ter; then the Captain
calls out, &s;top the Hor&s;e, and by this time the
Hor&s;e was got almo&s;t to the farther end of the
Town; the People of the Hou&s;e where he &s;tood,
not mi&s;&s;ing him all the while.</P>
<P>UPON his calling out &s;top the Hor&s;e, the Poor
People of the Town, &s;uch as were next Hand,
run from both &s;ides the Way and &s;topp'd the Hor&s;e
for him, as readily as cou'd be; and held him for
him, till he came up; he very Gravely comes up
to the Hor&s;e, hits him a Blow or two, and calls
him Dog for running away; gives the Man 2<HI>d.</HI>
that catch'd him for him, Mounts, and away he
comes after me.</P>
<P>THIS was the odde&s;t Adventure that cou'd have
happen'd, for the Hor&s;e &s;tole the Capt. the Capt.
did not &s;teal the Hor&s;e; when he came up to me,
now Col. <HI>Jack, &s;ays he,</HI> what &s;ay you to good luck,
would you $ave $ad me refus'd the Hor&s;e, when
he came &s;o Civily to ask me to Ride? No, no,
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you have got this Hor&s;e by your Wit, not
by De&s;ign, and you may go on now I think, you
are in a &s;afer Condition than I am, if we are taken.</P>
<P>THE next Que&s;tion was, what Road we &s;hould
take; here were four ways before us, and we
were alike Strangers to them all; fir&s;t on the right
Hand, and at about a little Mile from the Town,
a great Road went off to St. <HI>Edmund's-Bury;</HI> &s;trait
on, but enclining afterwards to the right, lay the
Great Road to <HI>Barton Mills,</HI> and <HI>Thetford,</HI> and &s;o
to <HI>Norwich;</HI> and full before us lay a great Road
al&s;o to <HI>Brandon</HI> and <HI>Lynn,</HI> and on the left, lay a
le&s;s Road to the City of <HI>Ely,</HI> and into the Fens.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, as we knew not which Road to take,
nor which way to get into the great North Road,
<PB N="119" REF="125">
which we had left; &s;o we by meer unguided Chance
took the way to <HI>Brandon,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Lynn:</HI> At <HI>Brand,</HI>
or <HI>Brandon;</HI> we were told that pa&s;&s;ing over at a
place call'd <HI>Downham Bridge,</HI> we might cro&s;s the
Fenn Country to <HI>Wisbich;</HI> and from thence g$ along
that Bank of the River <HI>Nyne</HI> to <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and
from thence to <HI>Stamford,</HI> where we were in the
Northen Road again; and likewi&s;e, that at <HI>Lynn,</HI>
we might go by the Wa&s;hes into <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and
&s;o might Travel North. But upon the whole,
this was my Rule, that when we enquir'd the way
to any particular Place, to be &s;ure we never took
that Road, but &s;ome other; which the accidental
Di&s;cour&s;e we might have, &s;hould bring in, and
thus we did here, for having chiefly ask'd our
way into the Northern Road, we re&s;olv'd to go
directly for <HI>Lynn.</HI></P>
<P>WE arriv'd here very ea&s;y and &s;afe, and while
we was con&s;idering of what way we &s;hould Tra|vel
next; we found we were got to a Point, and
that there was no way now left, but that by the
Wa&s;hes into <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and that was repre&s;en|ted
as very Dangerous; &s;o an Opportunity offer|ing
of a Man that was Travelling over the Fenns;
we took him for our Guide, and went with him
to <HI>Spalding,</HI> and from thence to a Town call'd
<HI>Deeping,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a large populous Town, and it was
Market Day when we came to it; &s;o we put in at
a little Hou&s;e, at the hither end of the Town, and
Walk'd into the Town.</P>
<P>HERE it was not po&s;&s;ible to re&s;train my
Captain from playing his Feats of Art, and my
Heart ak'd for him; I told him I would not go
with him, for he would not promi&s;e, and I
was &s;o terribly concern'd at the Apprehen&s;ions of
<PB N="120" REF="126">
his ventrous Humour, that I would not &s;o much
as &s;tir out of my Lodging; but it was in vain to
per&s;wade him; he went into the Market, and found
a <HI>Mountebank</HI> there, which was what he wanted;
how he pick'd two Pockets there in one Quarter of
an Hour and brought to our Quarters a Peice of new
<HI>Holland,</HI> of eight or nine Ells; a Peice of Stuff, and
played three or four Pranks more, in le&s;s than two
Hours; and how afterward he robb'd a Doctor of
Phy&s;ick, and yet came off clear in them all; this
I &s;ay, <HI>as above,</HI> belongs to his Story, not to
Mine.</P>
<P>I &s;colded heartily at him, when he came back,
and told him he would certainly ruin him&s;elf, and
me too before he left off, and threaten'd in &s;o
many Words, that I would leave him, and go
back, and carry the Hor&s;e to <HI>Puckeridge,</HI> where
we borrow'd it, and &s;o go to <HI>London</HI> by my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>HE promis'd amendment, but as we re&s;olv'd now
we were in the Great Road to Travel by Night,
&s;o it being not yet Night, he gives me the &s;lip a|gain,
and was not gone half an Hour, but he comes
back with a Gold Watch in his Hand; come, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> Why an't you ready? I am ready to go as
&s;oon as you will; and with that he pulls out the
Gold Watch: I was amaz'd at &s;uch a Thing, as that
in a Country Town, but it &s;eems there was
Prayers at one of the Churches in the Evening,
and he placing him&s;elf, as the Occa&s;ion directed,
found the way to be &s;o near the Lady, as to get
it from her Side, and walk'd off with it unper|ceived.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Night we went away, by Moon|light,
after having the Satisfaction to hear the
Watch cry'd, and ten Guineas offer'd for it again,
<PB N="121" REF="127">
he would have been glad of the ten Guineas, in|&s;tead
of the Watch; but dur&s;t not venture to car|ry
it home. Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you are afraid, and
but, you have Rea&s;on, give it me, I will ven|ture
to carry it again; but he would not let
me; but told me, that when he came into <HI>Scotland</HI>
we might &s;ell any thing there without Danger,
which was true indeed, for there they ask'd us no
Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>WE &s;et out, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> in the Evening by Moon|light,
and Travell'd hard, the Road being very
plain and large, till we came to <HI>Grantham,</HI> by
which time it was about two in the Morning, and
all the Town, as it were dead a &s;leep, &s;o we went
on for <HI>Newark,</HI> where we reach'd about 8 in the
Morning, and there we lay down and &s;lept mo&s;t
of the Day, and by this &s;leeping &s;o continually,
in the Day time, I kept him from doing a great
deal of Mi&s;chief, which he would otherwi&s;e have
done.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Newark,</HI> we took Advice of one that
was accidently comparing the Roads, and we con|cluded
that the Road by <HI>Nottingham,</HI> would be
the be&s;t for us; &s;o we turn'd out of the Great
Road, and went up the Side of the <HI>Trent</HI> to <HI>Not|tingham:</HI>
Here he play'd his Pranks again in a man|ner,
that it was the greate&s;t wonder imaginable to
me, that he was not &s;urpriz'd, and yet he came off
clear; and now he had got &s;o many bulky Goods
that he bought him a Portmanteau to carry them
in: It was in vain for me to offer to re&s;train him
any more; &s;o after this he went on his own way.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Nottingham, I &s;ay,</HI> he had &s;uch Succe&s;s, that
made us the ha&s;tier to be going, than otherwi&s;e
we would have been, lea&s;t we &s;hould have
been baulk'd, and &s;hould be laid hold of; from
<PB N="122" REF="128">
Thence we left the Road, which leads to the
North again, and went away by <HI>Mansfield</HI> into
<HI>Scar&s;dale,</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL take up no more of my own Story,
with his Pranks, they very well merit to be told
by them&s;elves; but I &s;hall ob&s;erve only what re|lates
to our Journey. In a Word, I drag'd him
along as fa&s;t as I could, till I came to <HI>Leeds</HI> in
<HI>Tork&s;hire,</HI> here tho' it be a large, and populous
Town, yet he could make nothing of it, neither had
he any Succe&s;s at <HI>Wakefield;</HI> and he told me, in
&s;hort, that the North Country People were cer|tainly
all Thieves: Why &s;o? <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> The People
&s;eem to be ju&s;t as other People are; <HI>No, no,
&s;ays he,</HI> they have their Eyes &s;o about them, and
are all &s;o &s;harp, they look upon every Body that
comes near them to be a Pick-Pocket, or el&s;e they
would never &s;tand, &s;o upon their Guard; and
then again, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> they are &s;o poor, there is but
little to be got, and I am afraid, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the
farther we go North, we &s;hall find it wor&s;e. Well,
<HI>&s;aid I,</HI> What do you infer from thence? I argue
from thence? <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that we &s;hall do nothing
there, and I had as good go back into the South,
and be hang'd, as into the North to be &s;tarv'd.</P>
<P>WELL, we came at length to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> upon
<HI>Tyne.</HI> Here on a Market-day was a great Throng
of People, and &s;everal of the Towns-People go|ing
to Market to buy Provi&s;ions, and here he
play'd his Pranks, cheated a Shopkeeper of 15 or
16 <HI>l.</HI> in Goods, and got clear away with them;
&s;tole a Hor&s;e, and &s;old that he came upon, and
play'd &s;o many Pranks, that I was quite frighted
for him; I &s;ay for him, for I was not concern'd for
my&s;elf, having never &s;tirr'd out of the Hou&s;e
where I Lodg'd, at lea&s;t not with him, nor with|out
<PB N="123" REF="129">
&s;ome or other with me, belonging to the <HI>Inn,</HI>
that might give an Account of me.</P>
<P>NOR did I u&s;e this Caution in vain, for he had
made him&s;elf &s;o publick by his Rogueries, that he
was way-laid every where to be taken, and had he
not artfully at fir&s;t given out, that he was come
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was going toward <HI>London,</HI> en|quiring
that Road, and the like, which amus'd
his Pur&s;uers for the fir&s;t Day, he had been taken, and
in all probability had been hang'd there; but by
that Artifice he got half a Days time of them; and
yet as it was, he was put &s;o to it, that he was fain
to plung Hor&s;e and all into the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> and
&s;wim over, and thereby made his E&s;cape: It was
true, that he was before upon <HI>Scots</HI> Ground, <HI>as
they call'd it,</HI> and con&s;equently they had no power
to have carried him off, if any Body had op|pos'd
them; yet as they were in a full Cha&s;e af|ter
him, could they have come up with him, they
would have run the Ri&s;que of the re&s;t, and they
cou'd but have deliver'd him up, if they had
been Que&s;tioned about it; however, as he got over
the <HI>Tweed,</HI> and was landed &s;afe, they could nei|ther
follow him, the Water being too High at the
u&s;ual Place of going over, nor could they have
attempted to have brought him away, if they had
taken him: The place where he took the River,
was where there is a <HI>Ford</HI> a little below <HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> but
the Water being up, the <HI>Ford</HI> was not pa&s;&s;able,
and he had no time to go to the <HI>Ferry-Boat,</HI> which
is about a Furlong off, oppo&s;ite to the Town.</P>
<P>HAVING thus made his E&s;cape, he went to
<HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> where he had appointed me to come after
him.</P>
<P>I followed with a heavy Heart, expecting every
Hour to meet him upon the Road, in the Cu&s;tody
<PB N="124" REF="130">
of the Con&s;tables, and &s;uch People, or to hear
of him in the Goal; but when I came to a
Place on the Border, call'd <HI>Woller-haugh-head,</HI> there
I under&s;tood how he had been Chas'd, and how
he had made his E&s;cape.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to <HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> he was ea&s;ie enough to
be found, for his having de&s;perately &s;wam the
<HI>Tweed,</HI> a rapid and large River, made him much
talk'd of, tho' it &s;eems they had not heard of the
occa&s;ion of it, nor any thing of his Character; for
he had wit enough to conceal all that, and live as
retir'd as he could till I came to him.</P>
<P>I WAS not &s;o much rejoyc'd at his Safety, as I
was provok'd at his Conduct; and the more, for
that I could not find he had yet the lea&s;t Notion
of its having been void of common Sen&s;e with re|&s;pect
to his Circum&s;tances, as well as contrary to
what he promis'd me; however, as there was no
beating any thing into his Head by Words, I only
told him, that I was glad he was at la&s;t gotten into
a Place of Safety, and I ask'd him then how he
intended to manage him&s;elf in that Country? He
&s;aid in few Words, he did not know yet, he doubt|ed
the People were very poor; but if they had
any Money, he was re&s;olv'd to have &s;ome of it.</P>
<P>BUT do you know too, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that they are the
&s;evere&s;t People upon Criminals of your kind in
the World? he did not value that, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> in
his blunt &s;hort way, he would venture it; upon
this, <HI>I told him,</HI> that &s;eeing it was &s;o, and he would
run &s;uch ventures, I would take my leave of him,
and be gone back to <HI>England:</HI> He &s;eem'd Sullen, or
rather it was the roughne&s;s of his untractable Di&s;|po&s;ition;
he &s;aid I might do what I would, he
would do, as he found opportunity; however, we
did not Part immediately, but went on towards
the Capital City; on the Road we found too much
<PB N="125" REF="131">
Poverty, and too few People to give him room to
expect any Advantage in his way, and tho' he
had his Eyes about him, as &s;harp as a Hawk, yet
he &s;aw plainly there was nothing to be done;
for as to the Men, they did not &s;eem to have
much Money about them; and for the Women,
their Dre&s;s was &s;uch, that they had any Mo|ney,
or indeed any Pockets, it was impo&s;&s;ible
to come at them; for wearing large Plads a|bout
them, and down to their Knees, they were
wrap'd up &s;o clo&s;e, that there was no coming to
make the lea&s;t attempt of that kind.</P>
<P><HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> was indeed a good Town, and had abundance
of People in it, and yet tho' he &s;taid one <HI>Sunday</HI>
there, and &s;aw the Church, which is very large and
throug'd with People; yet as he told me, there
w$s not one Woman to be &s;een in all the Church
with any other Dre&s;s than a Plaid, except in two
Pews, which belong'd to &s;ome Noblemen, and
who when they came out, were &s;o &s;urrounded with
Footmen and Servants, that there was no com|ing
near them, any more than there was any
coming near the King &s;urrounded by his Guards.</P>
<P>WE &s;et out therefore with this Di&s;courage|ment,
which I was &s;ecretly glad of, and went
forward $or <HI>Edinborough;</HI> all the way thither we
went thro' no con&s;iderable Town, and it was but
very cour&s;e Travelling for us, who were Strangers,
for we met with Waters, which were very Dan|gerous
to pa&s;s, by Rea&s;on of ha&s;ty Rains, at a Place,
call'd <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and where my Cap$ain was really
in danger of drowning, his Hor&s;e being driven down
by the Stream, and fell under him, by which he
wetted and &s;poil$d his &s;tolen Goods, that he brought
from <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and which he had kept dry,
<PB N="126" REF="132">
&s;trangely by holding them up in his Arms, when he
&s;wam the <HI>Tweed;</HI> but here it wanted but little, that
he and his Hor&s;e had been lo&s;t, not &s;o much by the
depth of the Water, as the fury of the Current;
but he had a Porverb in his Favour, and he got
out of the Water, tho' with difficulty enough, not
being born to be drown'd, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve
afterwards in its Place.</P>
<P>WE came to <HI>Edinborough,</HI> the third Day from
<HI>Kel&s;o,</HI> having &s;topp'd at an <HI>Inn</HI> one whole Day, at
a Place, call'd, <HI>Soutra-Hill,</HI> to dry our Goods,
and refre&s;h our &s;elves: We were oddly Saluted at
<HI>Edinborough,</HI> the next Day after we came thither;
My Captain having a de&s;ire to walk, and look a|bout
him, ask'd me if I would go, and &s;ee the
Town? I told him yes; &s;o we went out, and coming
thro'a Gate that they call the <HI>Nether-Bow</HI> into the
Great High-&s;treet, which went up to the <HI>Cro&s;s;</HI>
we were &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee it throug'd with an in|finite
Number of People: Ay, <HI>&s;ays my Captain,</HI>
this will do; however, as I had made him pro|mi&s;e
to make no Adventures that Day, other|wi&s;e,
I told him I would not got out with him;
&s;o I held him by the &s;leeve, and would not let
him &s;tir from me.</P>
<P>THEN we came up to the <HI>Mercart-Cro&s;s,</HI> and there
be&s;ides the great Number of People who pa&s;s'd,
and repa&s;s'd, we &s;aw a great Parade or kind of
Meeting, like an <HI>Exchange,</HI> of Gentlemen, of all
Ranks, and Qualities, and this Encourag'd my
Captain again, and he pleas'd him&s;elf with that
Sight.</P>
<P>IT was while we were looking, and wonder|ing
at what we &s;aw here, that we were &s;ur|priz'd
with a Sight; which we little expected; we
ob&s;erv'd the People running on a &s;udden, as to &s;ee
<PB N="127" REF="133">
&s;ome &s;trange Thing ju&s;t coming along, and
&s;trange it was indeed; for we &s;ee two Men na|ked
from the Wa&s;t upwards, run by us as &s;wift
as the Wind, and we imagin'd nothing, but that
it was two Men running a Race for &s;ome mighty
Wager; on a &s;udden, we found two long &s;mall
Ropes or Lines, which hung down at fir&s;t pull'd
&s;trait, and the two Racers &s;topp'd, and &s;tood &s;till,
one clo&s;e by the other; we could not imagine
what this meant, but the Reader may judge at
our &s;urprize when we found a Man follow after,
who had the ends of both tho&s;e Lines in his Hands,
and who, when he came up to them, gave each of
them two frightful La&s;hes with a Wire-whip, or
La&s;h, which he held in the other Hand; and then
the two poor naked Wretches run on again to the
length of their Line or Tether, where they waited
for the like Salutation; and in this manner they
Danc'd the length of the whole Street, which is
about half a Mile.</P>
<P>THIS was a dark Pro&s;pect to my Captain, and
put him in Mind, not only of what he was to ex|pect,
if he made a &s;lip in the way of his Profe&s;&s;i|on,
in this Place; but al&s;o of what he had &s;uffer'd,
when he was but a Boy; at the famous place,
$all'd <HI>Bridewell.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this was not all, for as we &s;aw the Execu|tion,
&s;o we were curious to Examine into the
Crime too; and we ask'd a young Fellow who
$tood near us, what the two Men had done, for
which they &s;uffer'd that Puni&s;hment. The Fel|low,
an unhappy ill natur'd <HI>Scotch-man,</HI> perceiv'd
$y our Speech, that we were <HI>Engli&s;h-men;</HI> and by
our Que&s;tion, that we were Strangers, told us with
$word$ malicious Wit, that they were two <HI>Engli&s;h-men;</HI>
$nd that they were Whip'd &s;o for Picking-pockets;
<PB N="128" REF="134">
and other petty Thieveries, and that they were
afterwards to be &s;ent away, over the Border into
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now this was every Word of it Fal&s;e, and was
only form'd by his nimble Invention, to in&s;ult
us as <HI>Engli&s;h-men;</HI> for when we enquir'd farther,
they were both <HI>Scotch-men,</HI> and were thus Scourg'd
for the u&s;ual Offences, for which we give the like
Puni&s;hment in <HI>England;</HI> and the Man who held
the Line, and Scourg'd them, was the City Hang|man;
who (by the Way) is there an Officer of
Note, has a con&s;tant Sallary, and is a Man of
Sub&s;tance, and not only &s;o, but a mo&s;t Dextrous
Fellow in his Office; and makes a great deal of
Money of his Employment.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ight however, was very &s;hocking to us;
and my Captain turn'd to me, come, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> let
us go away? I won't &s;tay here any longer; I was
glad to hear him &s;ay &s;o, but did not think he had
meant or intended what he &s;aid: However, we
went back to our Quarters, and kept pretty much
within, only that in the Evenings we Walk'd a|bout:
But even then my Captain found no Em|ployment,
no Encouragement; two or three times
indeed, he made a Prize of &s;ome Mercery and Mil|lenary
Goods: But when he had them, he knew
not what to do with them; &s;o that in &s;hort, he
was forc'd to be hone&s;t, in &s;pight of his good will,
to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>WE remain'd here about a Month; when on a
&s;udden my Captain was gone, Hor&s;e and all, and
I knew nothing what was become of him; nor did
I ever &s;ee or hear of him for eighteen Months af|ter,
nor did he &s;o much as leave the lea&s;t notice
for me; either, whether he was gone, or whether
he would return to <HI>Edinborough</HI> again, or no.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="135">
I Took his leaving me very heiniou&s;ly, not
knowing what to do with my &s;elf, being a
Stranger in the Place, and on the other Hand, my
Money abated a-pace too: I had for the mo&s;t part
of this time, my Hor&s;e upon my Hands to keep;
and as Hor&s;es yield but a &s;orry Price in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
I found no Opportunity to make much of him;
and on the other Hand, I had a &s;ecret Re&s;olution,
if I had gone back to <HI>England,</HI> to have re&s;tor'd him
to the Owner, at <HI>Puckeridge,</HI> by <HI>Ware;</HI> and &s;o I
&s;hould have wrong'd him of nothing, but of the
u&s;e of him for &s;o long time: But I found an Occa|&s;ion
to an&s;wer all my De&s;igns, about the Hor&s;e
to Advantage.</P>
<P>THERE came a Man to the <HI>Stabler</HI> (&s;o they call
the People at <HI>Edinborough,</HI> that take in Hor&s;es to
keep) and wanted to know if he could hear of any
return'd Hor&s;es for <HI>England;</HI> my Landlord (&s;o we
call'd him) came bluntly to me one Day, and ask'd
me <HI>if my Hor&s;e was my own?</HI> it was an odd Que&s;ti|on
as my Circum&s;tances &s;tood, and puzzl'd me at
fir&s;t; and I ask'd him why, and what was the Mat|ter?
Becau&s;e, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if it be a hir'd Hor&s;e in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
as is often the Ca&s;e with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, who
come to <HI>Scotland,</HI> I could help you to &s;end it
back, and get you &s;omething for riding it, &s;o he
expre&s;s'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I WAS very glad of the Occa&s;ion; and in &s;hort,
took Security there of the Per&s;on, for delivering
the Hor&s;e &s;afe and &s;ound, and had 15 <HI>s. Sterling</HI>
for the riding him: Upon this Agreement I gave
order to leave the Hor&s;e at the <HI>Falcon</HI> at <HI>Puckeridge,</HI>
and where I heard many Year after, that he was
hone&s;tly left, and that the Owner had him again,
but had nothing for the Loan of him.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136">
BEING thus eas'd of the Expence of my Hor&s;e,
and having nothing at all to do; I began to con&s;i|der
with my&s;elf, what would become of me, and
what I could turn my Hand to: I had not much
dimini&s;h'd my Stock of Money for tho' I was
all the way &s;o wary, that I would not Joyn
with my Captain in his de&s;perate Attempts, yet
I made no &s;cruple to live at his Expence, which
as I came out of <HI>England,</HI> only to keep him Com|pany
had been but ju&s;t, had I not known that all
he had to &s;pend upon me, was what he robb'd
hone&s;t People off, and that I was all that while a
Receiver of &s;tolen Goods; but I was not come off
&s;o far than as to &s;cruple that Part at all.</P>
<P>IN the the next Place, I was not &s;o anxious a|bout
my Money runing low, becau&s;e, I knew
what a Re&s;erve I had made at <HI>London;</HI> but &s;till
I was very willing to have engag'd in any hone&s;t
Employment for a Livelihood; for I was Sick
indeed of the wandering Life which I had led,
and was re&s;olv'd to Thieve no more; but then
two or three things, which I had offer'd me, I
lo&s;t, becau&s;e I could not Write or Read.</P>
<P>THIS afflicted me a great while very much,
but the <HI>Stabler,</HI> as I have call'd him deliver'd me
from my Anxiety that way, by bringing me to an
hone&s;t, but a poor young Man, who undertook to
teach me, both to Write and Read, and in a little
time too, and for a &s;mall Expence, if I would take
pains at it; I promi&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible Diligence and
to Work, I went with it; but found the Writing
much more difficult to me than the Reading.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in Half a Years time, or there|abouts;
I could Read and Write too tollerably
well, in&s;omuch, that I began to think I was now
fit for Bu&s;ine&s;s, and I got by it into the Service of
<PB N="131" REF="137">
a certain Officer of the Cu&s;toms, who employed
me for a time, but as he &s;et me to do little, but
pa&s;s and repa&s;s between <HI>Leith</HI> and <HI>Edinborough,</HI>
with the Accounts which he kept for the Farmers
of the Cu&s;toms there, leaving me to live at my
own Expence, till my Wages &s;hould be due, I
run out the little Money I had left, in Cloths
and Sub&s;i&s;tance, and a little before, the Years
End, when I was to have 12 <HI>l. Engli&s;h</HI> Money,
truly my Ma&s;ter was turn'd out of his Place, and
which was wor&s;e, having been Charged with &s;ome
Mi&s;-applications, was oblig'd to take Shelter in
<HI>England,</HI> and &s;o we that were Servants, for
there were three of us, were le&s;t to &s;hift for
our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS was a hard Ca&s;e for me, in a &s;trange
Place, and I was reduc'd by it, to the la&s;t Extre|mity:
I might have gone for <HI>England,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Ship being there, the Ma&s;ter profer'd me to give
me my pa&s;&s;age (upon telling him my di&s;tre&s;s) and
to take my Word, for the Payment of 10 <HI>s.</HI> when I
came there; but my Captain appear'd ju&s;t then un|der
new Circum&s;tances which oblig'd him not to go
away, and I was loth to leave him; it &s;eems we
were yet farther to take our Fate together.</P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd, that he left me, and that
I &s;aw him, no more for Eighteen Months: His
Ramble, and Adventures were many in that
time, he went to <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> play'd &s;ome re|markable
Pranks there, e&s;cap'd almo&s;t Miracu|lou&s;ly
from the Gallows, got over to <HI>Ireland,</HI>
wander'd about there, turn'd Raparee, and did &s;ome
villanious Things there, and e&s;cap'd from <HI>London-Derry,</HI>
over to the <HI>Highlands,</HI> in the North of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and about a Month before I was left
de&s;titute at <HI>Leith,</HI> by my Ma&s;ter; behold! my
<PB N="132" REF="138">
Noble Capt. <HI>Jack</HI> came in there, on Board the
Ferry-Boat, from <HI>Fi&s;e,</HI> being after all his Ad|ventures,
and Succe&s;&s;es advanc'd to the Dignity
of a Foot-Soldier, in a Body of Recruits rais'd in
the North, for the Regiment of <HI>Douglas.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER my Di&s;a&s;ter, being reduc'd almo&s;t as
low, as my Captain, I found no better Shift be|fore
me, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, than to enter
my&s;elf a Soldier too, and thus we were Rank'd
together, with each of us a Mu&s;quet upon our
Shoulders, and I confe&s;s that thing did not fit
&s;o ill upon me, as I thought at fir&s;t it would
have done; for tho' I far'd Hard, and lodg'd Ill,
for the la&s;t e&s;pecially, is the Fate of poor Sol|diers
in that Part of the World; yet to me, that
had been us'd to Lodge on the A&s;hes in the
Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e, this was no great matter; I had
a &s;ecret Satisfaction at being now under no Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of &s;tealing, and living in fear of a Pri&s;on,
and of the la&s;h of the Hangman; a thing which
from the time, I &s;aw it in <HI>Edinborough,</HI> was &s;o ter|rible
to me, that I could not think of it without
horror, and it was an inexpre&s;&s;ible ea&s;e to my
Mind, that I was now in a certain way of
Living, which was hone&s;t, and which I could
&s;ay, was not unbecoming a Gentleman.</P>
<P>WHATEVER, was my Satisfaction in that
Part, yet other Circum&s;tances did not equally
concur to make this Life &s;uit me; for after we had
been about Six Months in this Figure, we were
inform'd that the Recruits were all to march for
<HI>England,</HI> and to be &s;hipp'd off at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> or at
<HI>Hull,</HI> to join the Regiment which was then in
<HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould tell you that before this, I was ex|treamly
delighted with the Life of a Soldier; and
<PB N="133" REF="139">
I took the Exerci&s;e &s;o naturally, that the Serje|ant
that taught us to handle our Arms, &s;e$ing me
&s;o ready at it, ask'd me if I had never carryed
Arms before; I told him n$, at which he &s;wore,
tho' Je&s;ting they call you Col <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and I be|lieve
you will be a Col. $word$ you mu&s;t be $word$ Co|lon$l's
Ba&s;tard, or you would never handle $word$
Arms as you do, at once or twice &s;howing.</P>
<P>THIS pleas'd me extreamly, and encourag'd me,
and I was mightily taken with the Life of a Sol|dier;
but when my Captain came, and told me
the News, that we were to march for <HI>England,</HI>
and to be &s;hipp'd off for <HI>Flanders</HI> at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI>
upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> I was &s;urpriz'd very much, and new
Thoughts began to come in my Mind; as fir&s;t,
my Captain's Condition was particular, for he
dur&s;t not appear publickly at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> as he
mu&s;t have done if he had march'd with the Bat|talion
(for they were a Body of above 400, and
therefore, call'd them&s;elves a Battalion, tho' they
were but Recruits, and belonged to the &s;everal
Companies abroad) <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> he mu&s;t have march'd
with them, and been publickly &s;een, in which
Ca&s;e he would have been apprehended, and de|livered
up: In the next Place, I remember'd that
I had almo&s;t a Hundred Pound in Money in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and if it &s;hould have been ask'd, all the Sol|diers
in the Regiment which of them would go to
<HI>Flanders,</HI> a private Centinel if they had a 100 <HI>l.</HI>
in their Pockets, I believ'd none of them would
an&s;wer in the affirmative; a Hundred Pound be|ing
at that time &s;ufficient to buy a Colours in any
New Regiment, tho' not in that Regiment which
was on an old E&s;tabli&s;hment: This whetted
my Ambition, and I Dream't of nothing but be|ing
<PB N="134" REF="140">
a Gentleman Officer, as well as a Gentleman
Soldier.</P>
<P>THESE two Circum&s;tances concurring. I be|gan
to be very unea&s;y, and very unwilling in
my Thoughts to go over a poor Mu&s;quetier into
<HI>Flanders,</HI> to be knock'd on the Head at the Tune
of Three and Six-pence a Week: While I was day|ly
mu&s;ing on the Circum&s;tances of being &s;ent a|way,
as above, and con&s;idering what to do, my
Captain comes to me one Evening; Hark ye, <HI>Jack,
&s;ays he?</HI> I mu&s;t &s;peak with you, let us take a
walk in the Fields a little out from the Hou&s;es;
we were Quarter'd at a Place, call'd <HI>Park-End,</HI> near
the Town of <HI>Dunbar,</HI> about 20 Miles from <HI>Ber|wick</HI>
upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> and about Sixteen Miles from
the River <HI>Tweed,</HI> the neare&s;t way.</P>
<P>WE walk'd together here, and talk'd &s;eriou&s;ly up|on
the matter; the Captain told me how his Ca&s;e
&s;tood, and that he dur&s;t not march with the Bat|talion
into <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> that if he did, he &s;hould
be taken out of the Ranks, and tryed for his Life,
and that I knew as well as he; I could go private|ly
to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle, &s;ays he,</HI> and go thro' the Town
well enough, but to go publickly, is to run into
the Jaws of De&s;truction: <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>that
is very true, but what will you do?</HI> Do! &s;ays
he, <HI>do you think I am &s;o bound by honour, as a Gen|tleman
Soldier, that I will be hang'd for them,</HI> no,
no, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I am re&s;olv'd to be gone; and I would
have you go with us: <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> What do you
mean by us? why, here is another hone&s;t Fellow,
an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man al&s;o, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that is re&s;olv'd to
De&s;ert too, and he has been a long while in
their Service, and &s;ays, he knows how we &s;hall
be us'd Abroad, and he will not go to <HI>Flanders,

<P><PB N="135" REF="141">
WHY, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you will be &s;hot to Dea$$ for

out Scouts for you in the Morning all over the

Hands; as for that, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> my Comrade is
thoroughly acquainted with the Way; and has un|dertaken
to bring us to the Bank of <HI>Tweed,</HI> before
they can come up with us, and when we are on

Way.</P>
<P>No, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> no more of your old Ways; it has
been owing to tho&s;e old Ways, that we are now
in &s;uch a &s;trait.</P>
<P>WELL, well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the old Ways are better
than this &s;tarving Life of a Gentleman, as we
call it.</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> we have no Money in our Pockets;
how &s;hall we Travel?</P>
<P>I have a little, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> enough to help
us on to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> and if we can get none by
the Way, we will get &s;ome Collier Ship to take
us in, and carry us to <HI>London</HI> by Sea.</P>
<P>I like that the be&s;t of all the Mea&s;ures you have
laid yet, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and &s;o I con&s;ented to go, and went
off with him immediately: The cunning Rogue
having lodg'd his Comrade a Mile off under the
Hills, had drag'd me, talking with him by little
and little that way; till ju&s;t when I con&s;ented,
he was in &s;ight, and he &s;aid, look there's my Com|rade;
<PB N="136" REF="142">
who I knew pre&s;ently, having &s;een him a|mong
the Men.</P>
<P>BEING thus gotten under the Hills, and a Mile
of the way, and the Day ju&s;t &s;hot in, we kept on
a pace; re&s;olving if po&s;&s;ible to get out of the reach
of our Pur&s;ue$s, before they &s;hould mi&s;s us, or
know any thing of our being gone.</P>
<P>WE ply'd our time &s;o well, and travell'd &s;o
hard; that by five a Clock in the Morning we
were at a little Village, who&s;e Name I forget:
But they told us, that we were within eight Miles
of the <HI>Tweed;</HI> and that as &s;oon as we &s;hould be
over the River, we were on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground.</P>
<P>WE refre&s;h'd a little here, but march'd on with
but little &s;tay; however, it was half an Hour pa&s;t
eight in the Morning before we reach'd the <HI>Tweed;</HI>
&s;o it was at lea&s;t twelve Miles, when they told us
it was but Eight: Here we overtook two more of
the &s;ame Regiment who had De&s;erted from <HI>Had|dingtown;</HI>
where another part of the Recruits were
quarter'd.</P>
<P>THOSE were <HI>Scots-men,</HI> and very Poor, having
not one Penny in their Pockets; and had no more
when they made their E&s;cape, but 8s. between
them; and when they &s;ee us, who they knew to
be of the &s;ame Regiment, they took us to be Pur|&s;uers,
and that we came to lay hold of them; upon
which they &s;tood upon their Defence, having the
Regiment Swords on, as we had al&s;o, but none of
the Mounting or Cloathing; for we were not to
receive the Cloathing, till we came to the Regi|ment
in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>IT was not long before we made them under|&s;tand,
that we were in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances with
them&s;elves, and &s;o we &s;oon became one Company;
and after re&s;ting &s;ome time on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide of
<PB N="137" REF="143">
the River, (for we were heartily tyr'd, and the other
were as much Fateagu'd as we were;) I &s;ay, after
re&s;ting a while, we &s;et forward towards <HI>New Ca&s;tle,</HI>
whether we re&s;olv'd to go to get our Pa&s;&s;age by
Sea to <HI>London;</HI> for we had not Money to hold us
out any farther.</P>
<P>OUR Money was Ebb'd very Low, for tho' I
had one piece of Gold in my Pocket, which I kept
re&s;erv'd for the la&s;t Extremity; yet it was but
half a Guinea, and my Captain had born all our
Charges as far as his Money would go; &s;o that
when we came to <HI>New Ca&s;tle,</HI> we had but Six-pence
left in all to help our&s;elves; and the two <HI>Scots</HI>
had begg'd their way, all along the Road.</P>
<P>WE contriv'd to come into <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> in the
Dusk of the Evening; and even then we dur&s;t not
venture into the publick Part of the Town, but
made down towards the River, &s;omething below the
Town where &s;ome <HI>Gla&s;s-hou&s;es</HI> &s;tand: Here we knew
not what to do with our&s;elves; but Guided by our
Fate, we put a good Face upon the Matter, and
went into an <HI>Ale-hou&s;e,</HI> &s;at down and call'd for a
Pint of Beer.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e was kept by a Woman only, <HI>that is
to &s;ay</HI> We &s;aw no other, and as &s;he appear'd very
Frank, and Entertain'd us Cheerfully, we at la&s;t
told her our Condition; and ask'd her, if &s;he cou'd
not help us to &s;ome kind Ma&s;ter of a Collier, that
would give us a Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>London</HI> by Sea; the
Subtil Devil, who immediately found us proper
Fi&s;h for her Hock, gave us the kinde&s;t Words in
the World; and told us, &s;he was heartily &s;orry &s;he
had not &s;een us one Day &s;ooner; that there was a
Collier Ma&s;ter of her particular Acquaintance that
went away, but with the Morning-Tide; that the
Ship was fallen down to <HI>Shields,</HI> but &s;he believ'd
<PB N="138" REF="144">
was hardly over the Bar yet, and &s;he would
&s;end to his Hou&s;e, and &s;ee if he was gone on Board,
for &s;ometimes the Ma&s;ters do not go away till a
Tide after the Ship, and &s;he was &s;ure if he was
not gone, &s;he cou'd prevail with him to take us
all in; but then &s;he was afraid we mu&s;t go on
Board immediately the &s;ame Night.</P>
<P>WE begg'd of her to &s;end to his Hou&s;e, for we
knew not what to do, and if &s;he cou'd oblige
him to take us on Board, we did not care what
time of Night it was&punc; for as we had no Money,
we had no Lodging, and we wanted nothing, but
to be on Board.</P>
<P>WE look'd upon this as a mighty Favour, that &s;he
&s;ent to the Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e; and to our greater Joy,
&s;he brought us Word about an Hour after, that he
was not gone, and was at a Tavern in the Town,
whether his Boy had been to fetch him; and that
he had &s;ent Word he would call there in the way
Home.</P>
<P>THIS was all in our Favour, and we were ex|treamly
pleas'd with it; about an Hour after the
Landlady being in the Room with us, her Maid
brings us Word the Ma&s;ter was below, &s;o down
&s;he goes to him, telling us &s;he would go and tell
him our Ca&s;e, and &s;ee to per&s;wade him to take us
all on Board; after &s;ome time, &s;he comes up with
him, and brings him into the Room to us; where
are the&s;e hone&s;t Gentlemen Soldiers, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that
are in &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;s? We &s;tood all up and paid our
Re&s;pects to him; Well, Gentlemen, and is all
your Money &s;pent?</P>
<P>INDEED it is, <HI>&s;aid one of our Company;</HI> and we
&s;hall be infinitely obliged to you, Sir, if you
will give us a Pa&s;&s;age, we will be very willing
<PB N="139" REF="145">
to do any thing we can in the Ship, though we
are not Seamen.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> were none of you ever at Sea in
your Lives?</P>
<P>NO, <HI>&s;ays we,</HI> not one of us.</P>
<P>YOU will be able to do me no Service then,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for you will be all Sick: Well, however,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for my good Landlady's &s;ake, <HI>here I'll do
it:</HI> But are you all ready to go on Board, for I
go on Board this very Night?</P>
<P>YES, Sir, <HI>&s;ays we</HI> again, we are ready to go
this Minute.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> very kindly, we'll Drink to|gether;
come Landlady, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> make the&s;e ho|ne&s;t
Gentlemen a Sneaker of Punch.</P>
<P>WE look'd at one another, for we knew we had
no Money, and he perceiv'd it; come, come, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> don't be concern'd at your having no Money,
my Landlady here, and I, never part with dry
Lips: Come good Wife, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> make the Punch
as I bid you.</P>
<P>WE thank'd him, and &s;aid, God Ble&s;s you No|ble
Captain, a hundred times over; being over|joy'd
with &s;uch good Luck: While we were Drink|ing
the Punch, he calls the Landlady, come,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I'll &s;tep Home, and take my things,
and bid them Good-bye, and order the Boat to
come at high Water and take me up here; and
pray good Wife, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> get me &s;omething for
Supper, &s;ure if I can give the&s;e hone&s;t Men their
Pa&s;&s;age, I may give them a Bit of Victuals too,
it may be they han't had much for Dinner.</P>
<P>WITH this away he went, and in a little while
we heard the Jack a going; and one of us going
down Stairs for a Spye, brought us Word there
was a good Leg of Mutton at the Fire: In le&s;s than
<PB N="140" REF="146">
an Hour our Captain came again, $span$
to us, and blam'd us that we had $span$
the Punch out; come, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> don't be $word$
when that's out we can have another, $word$
am obliging poor Men, I love to do it hand|&s;omely.</P>
<P>WE drank on, and drank the Punch out, and
more was brought up, and he pu&s;h'd it about a
pace; then came up a Leg of Mutton, and I
need not &s;ay that we eat heartily, being told &s;e|veral
times, that we &s;hould pay nothing; after
Supper was done, he bids my Landlady ask if the
Boat was come? and &s;he brought word no, it was
not High Water by a good deal; no, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> well
then give us &s;ome more Punch, &s;o more Punch
was brought in, and, as was afterwards confe&s;s'd
&s;omething was put into it, or more Brandy than
ordinary, that by that time the Punch was drunk
out, we were all very Drunk, and as for me I was
a&s;leep.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time that was out, we were told
the Boat was come, &s;o we tumbl'd out, almo&s;t o|ver
one another into the Boat, and away we
went, and our Captain with us in the Boat; mo&s;t of
us, if not all, fell a&s;leep; till after &s;ometime, tho'
how, much or how far going we knew not, the
Boat &s;topp'd, and we were wak'd, and told we
were at the Ship &s;ide; which was true, and with
much help and holding us, for fear we &s;hould
fall over Board, we were all gotten into the Ship;
all I remember of it was this, that as &s;oon as we
were on Board, our Captain, as we call'd him,
call'd out thus, here Boat&s;on take care of the&s;e
Gentlemen, and give them good Cabbins, and
let them turn in and go to &s;leep, for they are
very weary; and &s;o indeed we were, and very
<PB N="141" REF="147">
Drunk too, being the fir&s;t time I had ever drank
and Punch in my Life.</P>
<P>WELL, care was taken of us, according to or|der,
and we were put into very good Cabbius,
where we were &s;ure to go immediately to &s;leep; in
the mean time the Ship, which was indeed ju&s;t
ready to go, and only on notice given, had come to
an Anchor for us at <HI>Shields,</HI> weigh'd, &s;tood over the
Bar, and went off to Sea, and when we wak'd,
and began to peep abroad, which was not till near
Noon; the next Day we found our&s;elves a great
way at Sea, the Land in &s;ight indeed, but at a
great di&s;tance, and all going merrily on for <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
as we under&s;tood it; we were very well us'd,
and well &s;atisfy'd with our Condition for about
three Days, when we began to enquire whether we
were not almo&s;t come, and how much longer it
would be, before we &s;hould come into the River?
What River? <HI>&s;ays one of the Men,</HI> why, the <HI>Thames,</HI>
&s;ays my Captain <HI>Jack;</HI> the <HI>Thames,</HI> &s;ays the Sea|men,
What do ye mean by that? What han't you
had time enough to be &s;ober yet? &s;o Captain
<HI>Jack</HI> &s;aid no more, but look'd about him like a
Fool, when a while after, &s;ome other of us ask'd
the like Que&s;tion, and the Seamen, who knew no|thing
of the Cheat, began to &s;mell a Trick,
and turning to the other <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> that came
with us, pray, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Where do you fancy you
are going, that you ask &s;o often about it? why to
<HI>London,</HI> &s;ays he, where &s;hould we be going? we
agreed with the Captain to carry us to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>NOT with the Captain, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I dare &s;ay; poor
Men, you are all cheated; and I thought &s;o when I
&s;aw you come Aboard with that Kidnapping Rogue
<HI>Gilliman;</HI> poor Men! <HI>adds he,</HI> you are all Betray'd,
<PB N="142" REF="148">
Why, you are going to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the Ship is
bound to <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> falls a &s;torming, and raving like
a mad Man, and we gathering round him, let any
Men gue&s;s if they can, what was our &s;urpri&s;e, and
how we were confounded when we were told how
it was; in &s;hort, we drew our Swords, and began
to lay about us, and made &s;uch a Noi&s;e, and
Hurry in the Ship, that at la&s;t the Seamen
were obliged to call out for help; the Captain
commanded us to be di&s;armed in the fir&s;t
Place, which was not however done without gi|ving,
and receiving &s;ome Wounds, and after|wards
he caus'd us to be brought to him into the
great Cabbin.</P>
<P>HERE he talk'd calmly to us, that he was
really very &s;orry, for what had befallen us, that
he perceiv'd we had been Trappan'd, and that the
Fellow, who had brought us on Board was a
Rogue that was employ'd by a &s;ort of wicked
Merchants, not unlike him&s;elf; that he &s;uppos'd
he had been repre&s;ented to us, as Captain of the
Ship, and ask'd us if it was not &s;o? we told him
yes, and gave him a large Account of our&s;elves,
and how we came to the Woman's Hou&s;e to en|quire
for &s;ome Ma&s;ter of a <HI>Collier</HI> to get a Pa&s;&s;age
to <HI>London,</HI> and that this Man engag'd to carry us
to <HI>London</HI> in his own Ship, and the like, as is re|lated
above.</P>
<P>HE told us he was very &s;orry for it, and he
had no hand it; but it was out of his Power to
help us, and let us know very plainly what our
Condition was; namely, that we were put on
Board his Ship as Servants to be deliver'd at <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI>
to &s;uch a Man, who he named to us; but
that however if we would be quiet, and orderly
<PB N="143" REF="149">
in the Ship, he would u&s;e us well in the Pa&s;&s;age,
and take care we &s;hould be us'd well when we
came there, and that he would do any thing for
us that lay in his Power; but if we were un|ruly
and refractory we could not expect but he
mu&s;t take &s;uch Mea&s;ures as to oblige us to be &s;a|tisfied;
and that in &s;hort, we mu&s;t be Hand-cuffed,
carried down between the Decks, and kept as
Pri&s;oners, for it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to take care that
no Di&s;turbance mu&s;t be in the Ship.</P>
<P>MY Captain rav'd like a mad Man; &s;wore at
the Captain, told him he would not fail to cut
his Throat either on Board, or a Shore, whenever he
came within his reach, and that if he could
not do it now, he would do it after he came
to <HI>England</HI> again, if ever he dur&s;t &s;how his
Face here again, for he might depend upon it, if
he was carryed away to <HI>Virginia,</HI> he &s;hould find
his way to <HI>England</HI> again; that if it was 20
Year after, he would have Satisfaction of him:
Well, young Man, <HI>&s;ays the Captain &s;miling,</HI> 'tis
very hone&s;tly &s;aid, and than I mu&s;t take care of
you while I have you here; and afterwards, I
mu&s;t take care of my &s;elf; do your wor&s;t, <HI>&s;ays
Jack boldly,</HI> I'll pay you home for it one time or
other; I mu&s;t venture that young Man, &s;ays he
&s;till, calmly, but for the pre&s;ent you and I mu&s;t
talk a little; &s;o he bids the Boat&s;wain, who &s;tood
near him, &s;ecure him, which he did; I &s;poke to
him to be ea&s;ie and patient, and that the Captain
had no Hand in our Misfortune.</P>
<P>NO Hand in it! D&mdash;m him, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> aloud, do
you think he is not Confederate in this Villainy?
Would any hone&s;t Man receive Innocent People
on Board his Ship, and not enquire of their
Circum&s;tances, but carry them away, and not
<PB N="144" REF="150">
&s;peak to them? and now he knows how Barbarou&s;ly
we are treated; Why does he not &s;et us on Shore
again? I tell you he is the Villiain, and none but
him; Why does he not compleat his Villainy, and
Murther us, and then he will be free from our Re|venge?
But nothing el&s;e &s;hall ever deliver him
from my Hands; but &s;ending us to the D&mdash;1, or
going thither him&s;elf; and I am hone&s;ter in tel|ling
him &s;o fairly, than he has been to me, and
am in no Pa&s;&s;ion any more than he is.</P>
<P>THE Captain was a little &s;hock'd at his bold|ne&s;s,
for he talk'd a great deal more of the &s;ame
Kind; with a great deal of Spirit, and Fire, and
yet, without any Di&s;order in his Temper; indeed
I was &s;urpriz'd at it, for I never had heard him
talk &s;o well, and &s;o much to the Purpo&s;e in my
Life: The Captain was, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> a little &s;hock'd at
it; however, he talk'd very hand&s;omely to him,
and told him, look ye, young Man, I bear with
you the more, becau&s;e I am &s;en&s;ible your Ca&s;e is
very hard, and yet, I cannot allow your Threat|ning
me neither; and you oblige me by that, to
be &s;everer with you than I intended; however, I
will do nothing to you, but what your Threatning
my Life makes nece&s;&s;ary: The Boat&s;wain call'd
out to have him to the Geers, as they call'd it,
and to have him Ta&s;t the <HI>Cat-a-nine-tales;</HI> all
which were Terms we did not under&s;tand till af|terwards,
we were told he &s;hould have been
Whipp'd and Pickl'd, for they &s;aid it was not to
be &s;uffer'd; but the Captain &s;aid, no, no, the
young Man has been really Injur'd, and has Rea|&s;on
to be very much provok'd: But I have not
Injur'd him, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and then he prote&s;ted he had
no Hand in it; that he was put on Board, and we
al&s;o by the Owner's Agent, and for their Account;
<PB N="145" REF="151">
That it was true, that they did always deal in
Servants, and carryed a great many every Voy|age;
but that it was no profit to him as Com|mander,
but they were always put on Board by
the Owners, and that it was none of his Bu&s;ine&s;s
to enquire about them, and to prove that he was
not concern'd in it, but was very much troubled
at &s;o ba&s;e a thing, and that he would not be In|&s;trumental
to carry us away again&s;t our Wills,
if the Wind and the Weather would permit, he
would &s;et us on &s;hore again, tho' as it blow'd then,
the Wind being at South-We&s;t, and a hard Gale,
and that they were already as far as the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> it
was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT the Captain was the &s;ame Man; he told him,
that let the Wind blow how it would, he ought not
to carry us away again&s;t our con&s;ents, and that
as to his Pretences of his Owners, and the like
it was &s;aying of nothing to him; for it was he the
Captain that carryed us away, and that whatever
Rogue Trappan'd us on Board, now he knew it, he
ought no more to carry us away, than Murther us,
and that he demanded to be &s;et on Shore, or el&s;e
he the Captain was a Thief, and a Murtherer.</P>
<P>THE Captain continu'd mild &s;till, and then I
put in with an Argument, that had like to have
brought us all back, if the Weather had not real|ly
hindered it; which when I came to under&s;tand
Sea Affairs better, I found was indeed &s;o, and that
had been impo&s;&s;ible. I told the Captain that I
was &s;orry that my Brother was &s;o warm, but
that our u&s;uage was Villainous, which he could
not deny; then I took np the air of what my
Habit did not agree with, I told him, that were
not People to be &s;old for Slaves, that tho' we
had the Misfortune to be in a Circum&s;tance that
<PB N="146" REF="152">
oblig'd us to conceal our&s;elves, having di&s;gui&s;ed
our&s;elves to get out of the Army, as being not wil|ling
to go into <HI>Flanders;</HI> yet, that we were Men
of Sub&s;tance, and able to Di&s;charge our&s;elves
from the Service, when it came to that, and to con|vince
him of it, I told him I would give him &s;uffi|cient
Security, to pay 20<HI>l.</HI> a piece, for my Brother
and my &s;elf; and in as &s;hort time as we could
&s;end, from the Place he &s;hould put in at <HI>London,</HI>
and receive a Return; and to &s;how that I was able
to do it, I pull'd out my Bill for 94<HI>l.</HI> from the
Gentleman of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and who to my
infinite Satisfaction, he knew as &s;oon as he &s;aw
the Bill; he was a&s;toni&s;h'd at this, and lifting up
his Hands, by what Witchcraft, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> were you
brought hither!</P>
<P>As to that, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> we have told you the Story,
and we add nothing to it, but we in&s;i&s;t upon it,
that you will do this Ju&s;tice to us now: Well,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I am very &s;orry for it, but I cannot an|&s;wer
puting back the Ship; neither if I could, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> is it Practicable to be done.</P>
<P>WHILE this Di&s;cour&s;e la&s;ted, the two <HI>Scots|men,</HI>
and the other <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> were &s;ilent, but as
I &s;eem'd to Acquie&s;ce, the <HI>Scotch&s;men,</HI> began to
talk to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which I need not re|peat,
and had not mention'd, but for a merry
Pa&s;&s;age that followed; after the <HI>Scotch&s;men</HI> had &s;aid
all they could, and the Captain &s;till told them
they mu&s;t &s;ubmit; And will you then carry us
to <HI>Virginia? Yes, &s;ays</HI> the Captain, and will we
be &s;old &s;ayd the <HI>Scot&s;man,</HI> when we come
there? Yes, <HI>&s;ays the Captain;</HI> Why, then, Sir, &s;ays
the <HI>Scot&s;man</HI> the Devil will have you at the
hnider End of the Bargain; <HI>&s;ay you &s;o,</HI> &s;ays
the Captain &s;miling, well, well, <HI>let the De|vil
and I alone to agree about that,</HI> do you be
<PB N="147" REF="153">
quiet and behave Civilly as you &s;hould do, and
you &s;hall be us'd as kindly both here, and there
too as I can: The poor <HI>Scotch&s;men</HI> could &s;ay little
to it, nor I, nor any of us; for we &s;aw there was
no Remedy, but to leave the Devil, and the Cap|tain
to agree among them&s;elves, as the Captain
had &s;aid as to the hone&s;ty of it.</P>
<P>THUS, in &s;hort, we were all, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> oblig'd to
Acquie&s;ce; but my Captain, who was &s;o much
the more ob&s;tinate when he found that I had a
Fund to make &s;uch an offer upon, nor could all my
per&s;wa&s;ions prevail with him: The Captain of the
Ship and he had many plea&s;ant Dialogues about
this in the re&s;t of the Voyage, in which <HI>Jack</HI> never
treated him with any Language, but that of Kid|napper,
and Villain, nor talk'd of any thing,
but of taking his Revenge of him; but I omit
that Part tho' very Diverting as being no part of
my own Story.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the Wind continu'd to blow hard,
tho' very fair, till, as the Seamen &s;aid, we were
pa&s;s'd the I&s;lands, on the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
that we began to Steer away We&s;terly, and then
in a few Days, (which I came to under&s;tand &s;ince)
as there was no Land any way, for many Hundred
Leagues, &s;o we had no Remedy but Patience,
and to be as ea&s;y as we could; only my &s;urly Cap|tain
<HI>Jack</HI> continued the &s;ame Man all the way.</P>
<P>WE had a very good Voyage, no Storms all
the way, and a Northerly Wind almo&s;t 20
Days together; &s;o that in a Word, we made the
Capes of <HI>Virginia</HI> in two and Thirty Days, from
the Day we &s;teer'd We&s;t, as I have &s;aid which was
in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, 30 Minutes; be|ing
to the North of the I&s;le of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and
this they &s;aid was a very quick Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="154">
NOTHING material happen'd to me, during the
Voyage, and indeed when I came there I was ob|lig'd
to act in &s;o naarrow a Compa&s;s, that nothing
$word$ material could Pre&s;ent it &s;elf.</P>
<P>WHEN we came a &s;hore, which was in a great
River, which they call <HI>Potomack,</HI> the Captain
ask'd us, but me more particularly, whether I
had any thing to propo&s;e to him now? <HI>Jack</HI> an|&s;w$r'd
<HI>yes, I have &s;omething to propo&s;e to you</HI> Cap|tam;
that is, that I have promis'd you to cut
your Throat, and depend upon it I will be as good
as my Word: Well, well, <HI>&s;ays the Captain,</HI> If I
can't help it you &s;hall; &s;o he turn'd away to me,
I under&s;tood him very well what he meant; but
I was now out of the reach of any Relief, and
as for my Note it was now but a bit of Paper of
no value, for no Body could receive it but my|&s;elf:
I &s;aw no Remedy, and &s;o talk'd coldly to him
of it, as of a thing I was indifferent about; and
indeed I was grown indifferent, for I con&s;idered all
the way on the Voyage, that as I was bred a Vaga|bond,
had been a Pick-pocket, and a Soldier, and
was run from my Colours, and that I had no &s;ettled
Abode in the World, nor any Employ to get
any thing by, except that wicked one I was bred
to, which had the Gallows at the Heels of it; I
did not &s;ee, but that this Service might be as well
to me as other Bu&s;ine&s;s; and this I was parti|cularly
&s;atisfied with when they told me, that af|ter
I had Served out the five Years Servitude, I
&s;hould have the Courti&s;ie of the Country, <HI>as they
call'd it;</HI> that is a certain Quantity of Land to
Cultivate and Plant for my&s;elf; &s;o that now I
was like to be brought up to &s;omething, by which
I might live without that wretched thing, call'd
&s;tealing; which my very Soul abhorr'd, and
<PB N="149" REF="155">
which I had given over, as I have &s;aid ever &s;ince
that wicked time, that I robb'd the poor Widow
of <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Town.</P>
<P>IN this Mind I was, when I arriv'd at <HI>Virginia,</HI>
and &s;o when the Captain enquired of me what I
intended to do, and whether I had any thing to
propo&s;e, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> he meant whether I would
give him my Bill, which he wanted to be Finger|ing
very much; I an&s;wer'd coldly, my Bill would
be of no u&s;e to me now, for no Body would ad|vance
any thing upon it, only this I would &s;ay to
him, that if he would carry me and Captain
<HI>Jack</HI> back to <HI>England,</HI> and to <HI>London</HI> again, I would
pay him the 20 <HI>l.</HI> off of my Bill for each of us:
This he had no mind to; <HI>for as to your Brother,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>I would not take him into my Ship for twice</HI>
20 l. <HI>he is &s;uch a hardened de&s;perate Villain,</HI> &s;ays
he, <HI>I &s;hould be oblig'd to carry him in Irons as I
brought him hither.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we parted with our Captain, <HI>or Kidnap|per,
call him as you will:</HI> We were then deliver'd
to the Merchants, to whom we were Con&s;ign'd,
who again di&s;pos'd of us as they thought fit, and
in a few Days we were &s;eparated.</P>
<P>As for my Captain <HI>Jack,</HI> to make &s;hort of the
Story, that de&s;perate Rogue had the Luck to have
a very ea&s;ie good Ma&s;ter; who&s;e E$&s;ine&s;s, and good
Humour he abus'd very much, and in particular,
took an Opportunity to run away with a Boar,
which his Ma&s;ter entru&s;ted him and another wi$h,
to carry &s;ome Provi&s;ions down the River to ano|ther
Plantation, which he had there: This Boar,
and Provi&s;ions they ran away with, and $word$
North to the bottom of the Bay, <HI>as they call $word$,</HI> and
into a River, call'd <HI>Sa&s;quehanuagh,</HI> and there quit|ting
the Boat, they wandered thro' the Wo$ds,
<PB N="150" REF="156">
till they came into <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> from whence they
made &s;hift to get Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>New-England,</HI> and
from thence Home; where falling in among his old
Companions, and to the old Trade; he was at
length taken and hang'd, about a Month before I
came to <HI>London,</HI> which was near 20 Year after|ward.</P>
<P>MY Part was harder at the Beginning, tho'
better at the latter End; I was di&s;pos'd of, <HI>that
is to &s;ay,</HI> &s;old, to a rich Planter, who&s;e Name was
<HI>Smith,</HI> and with me, the other <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who
was my Fellow De&s;er$er, that <HI>Jack</HI> brought
me to when we went off from <HI>Dunbar.</HI></P>
<P>WE were now Fellow Servan$s, and it was our
Lot to be carrved up a &s;mall River or Creek,
which falls into <HI>Potowmack</HI> River, about eight Miles
from the great River: Here we were brought to
the Plantation, and put in among about 50 Ser|vants,
as well <HI>Negroes,</HI> as others, and being de|livered
to the Head-man, or Director, or Man|nager
of the Plantation, he took care to let us
know that we mu&s;t expect to Work, and very hard
too; for it was for that Purpo&s;e his Ma&s;ter bought
Servants, and for no other: I told him very &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ively,
that &s;ince it was our Misfortune to
come into &s;uch a mi&s;erable Condition as we were
in, we expected no other; only we de&s;ir'd, we
might be &s;how'd our Bu&s;ine&s;s, and be allowed to
learn it gradually, &s;ince he might be &s;ure we had
not been us'd to Labour; and I added that when he
knew particularly by what Methods we were
brought, and betrayed into &s;uch a Condition, he
would perhaps &s;ee Cau&s;e, at lea&s;t to &s;hew us that
Favour, if not more: This I &s;poke with &s;uch a
$$oving Tone, as gave him a Curio&s;ity to enquire
<PB N="151" REF="157">
into the particulars of our Story, which I gave
him at large, a little more to our Adavntage too,
than ordinary.</P>
<P>THIS Story as I hop'd it would, did move
him to a &s;ort of Tenderne&s;s, but yet he told us
that his Ma&s;ter's Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be done, and that
he expected we mu&s;t Work, as above; that he
could not di&s;pen&s;e with that, upon any account
whatever; accordingly to Work we went, and
indeed we had three hard Things attending us;
namely, we work'd Hard, lodg'd Hard, and far'd
Hard; the fir&s;t I had been an utter Stranger to,
the la&s;t I could &s;hift well enough with.</P>
<P>DURING this Scene of Life, I had time to
reflect on my pa&s;t Hours, and upon what I had
done in the World, and tho' I had no great Ca|pacity
of making a clear Judgment, and very
little reflections from Con&s;cience, yet it made &s;ome
impre&s;&s;ions upon me; and particularly that I was
brought into this mi&s;erable Condition of a Slave;
by &s;ome &s;trange directing Power, as a Puni&s;h|ment
for the Wickedne&s;s of my younger Years,
and this thought was increas'd upon the following
occa&s;ion: The Ma&s;ter who&s;e Service I was now
gaged in, was a Man of Sub&s;tance and Figure
in the Country, and had abundance of Ser|vants,
as well as <HI>Negroes,</HI> as <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> in all I think
he had near 200, and among &s;o many, as &s;ome
grew every Year infirm and unable to Work, o|thers
went off upon their time being expir'd, and
others died; and by the&s;e and other Accidents the
Number would dimini&s;h, if they were not often
Recruited and fill'd, and this obliged him to buy
more every Year.</P>
<P>IT happen'd while I was here, that a Ship ar|rived
from <HI>London,</HI> with &s;everal Servants, and
<PB N="152" REF="158">
among the re&s;t was &s;eventeen Tran&s;ported Fe$|lons,
&s;ome burnt in the Hand, others not; eight
of whom my Ma&s;ter bought for the time &s;pecified
in the Warrant for their Tran&s;portation, re|&s;pectively,
&s;ome for a longer, &s;ome a &s;horter
term of Years.</P>
<P>OUR Ma&s;ter was a great Man in the Country,
and a Ju&s;tice of Peace, tho' he &s;eldom came down
to the Plantation where I was, yet as the new
Servants were brought on Shore, and delivered
at our Plantation, his Wor&s;hip came thither, in
a kind of State to &s;ee and Receive them: When
they were brought before him, I was call'd among
other Servants, as a kind of a Guard to take them
into Cu&s;tody, after he had &s;een them, and to car|ry
them to the Work; they were brought by a
Guard of Seamen from the Ship, and the &s;econd
Mate of the Ship came with them, and deliver'd
them to our Ma&s;ter, with the Warrant for their
Tran&s;portation, as above.</P>
<P>WHEN his Wor&s;hip had read over the Warrants,
he call'd them over by their Names, One by One,
and having let them know by his reading the
Warrants over again to each Man re&s;pectively,
that he knew for what Offences they were
Tran&s;ported; he talk'd to every one &s;eperately
very gravely, let them know how much Favour
they had receiv'd in being &s;av'd from the Gallows,
which the Law had appointed for their Crimes,
that they were not Sentenced to be Tran&s;ported,
but to be hang'd, and that Tran&s;portation was
granted them upon their own Reque&s;t and humble
Petition.</P>
<P>THEN he laid before them, that they ought to
look upon the Life they were ju&s;t a going to en|ter
upon, as ju&s;t beginning the World again; that
<PB N="153" REF="159">
if they thought fit to be diligent, and &s;ober, they
would after the time they were order'd to Serve
was expir'd, be encourag'd by the Con&s;titution of
the Country, to Settle and Plant for them&s;elves,
and that even he him&s;elf would be &s;o kind to
them, that if he liv'd to &s;ee any of them &s;erve
their Time faithfully out, it was his cu&s;tom to
a&s;&s;i&s;t his Servants, in order to their Settling in
that Country, according as their Behaviour might
Merit from him, and they would &s;ee and know
&s;everal Planters round about them, who now were
in very good Circum&s;tances, and who formerly
were only his Servants, in the &s;ame Condition
with them, and came from the &s;ame Place; that
is to &s;ay, <HI>Newgate,</HI> and &s;ome of them had the
Mark of it in their Hands, but were now very
hone&s;t Men, and liv'd in very good Repute.</P>
<P>AMONG the re&s;t of his new Servants, he came
to a young Fellow not above 17 or 18 Years of
Age, and his Warrant mention'd that he was, tho'
a young Man, yet an old Offender; that he had
been &s;everal times Condemn'd, but had been Re|&s;pited
or Pardon'd, but &s;till he continued an in|corrigible
Pick-pocket; that the Crime for which
he was now Tran&s;ported was for Picking a Mer|chant's
Pocket-Book, or Letter Ca&s;e out of his
Pocket, in which was Bills of <HI>Exchange,</HI> for a
very great Sum of Money; that he had afterward
receiv'd the Money upon &s;ome of the Bills; but
that going to a Gold&s;mith in <HI>Lombard &s;treet</HI> with
another Bill, and having demanded the Money,
he was &s;topp'd, Notice having been given of the
Lo&s;s of them; that he was condemn'd to Die for
the Felony, and being &s;o well known for an old
Offender, had certainly died, but the Mer|chant
upon his earne&s;t Application, had obtain'd
<PB N="154" REF="160">
that he &s;hould be Tran&s;ported, on Condition that
he re&s;tor'd all the re&s;t of the Bills, which he had
done accordingly.</P>
<P>OUR Ma&s;ter talk'd along time to this young
Fellow; mention'd with &s;ome &s;urprize, that he &s;o
young &s;hould have follow'd &s;uch a wicked Trade
&s;o long, as to obtain the Name of an old Offen|der,
at &s;o young an Age, and that he &s;hould be
&s;til'd incorrigible, which is to &s;ignify, that not|with&s;tanding
his being Whipt two or three times,
and &s;everal times puni&s;h'd by Impri&s;onment, and
once burnt in the Hand, yet nothing would do
him any good; but that he was &s;till the &s;ame.
He talk'd mighty Religiou&s;ly to this Boy, and
told him, God had not only &s;par'd him from the
Gallows, but had now mercifully deliver'd him
from the Opportunity of committing the &s;ame
Sin again, and put it into his Power to live an
hone&s;t Life, which perhaps he knew not how to
do before; and tho' &s;ome part of this Life now
might be laborious, yet he ought to look on it to
be no more, then being put out Apprentice to an
hone&s;t Trade, in which, when he came out of his
Time he might be able to Set up for him&s;elf, and
live hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>THEN he told him, that while he was a Servant,
he would have no Opportunity to be di&s;hone&s;t,
&s;o when he came to be for him&s;elf, he would
have no Temptation to it, and &s;o after a great
many other kind things &s;aid to him, and the re&s;t
they were di&s;mi&s;t.</P>
<P>I WAS exceedingly mov'd at this Di&s;cour&s;e of
our Ma&s;ters, as any Body would judge I mu&s;t be,
when it was directed to &s;uch a young Rogue, born
a Thief, and bread up a Pick pocket like my &s;elf,
for I thought all my Ma&s;ter &s;aid was &s;poken to
<PB N="155" REF="161">
me, and &s;ometimes it came into my Head, that
&s;ure my Ma&s;ter was &s;ome extraordinary Man,
and that he knew all things that ever I had done
in my Life.</P>
<P>BUT I was &s;urpriz'd to the la&s;t degree, when
my Ma&s;ter di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all the re&s;t of us Servants,
Pointed at me, and &s;peaking to his head Clerk, <HI>here
&s;ays he,</HI> bring that young Fellow hither to me.</P>
<P>I HAD been near a Year in the Work, and I
had ply'd it &s;o well, that the Clerk, or head
Man, either flatter'd me, or did really believe
that I behav'd very well; but I was terribly
frighted to hear my&s;elf call'd out, aloud, ju&s;t as
they us'd to call for &s;uch as had done &s;ome Mi&s;|demeanour,
and were to be La&s;h'd, or otherwi&s;e
Corrected.</P>
<P>I CAME in like a Malefactor indeed, and
thought I look'd like one ju&s;t taken in the Fact,
and carry'd before the Ju&s;tice; and indeed when
I came in, for I was carry'd into an Inner-Room,
or Parlour in the Hou&s;e to him; his Di&s;cour&s;e to
the re&s;t was in a large Hall, where he &s;at in a
Seat like a Lord Judge upon the Bench, or a Pet|ty
King upon his Throne.</P>
<P>WHEN I came in, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> he ordered his Man
to withdraw, and I &s;tanding half naked, and bare|headed
with my Haugh or Hoe in my Hand, (the
Po&s;ture and Figure I was in at my Work,) near the
Door, he bad me lay down my Hoe, and come
nearer; then he began to look a little le&s;s Stern and
Terrible, than I fancy'd him to look before; or per|haps
both his Countenance then, and before might
be to my Imagination, differing from what they
really were; for we do not always Judge tho&s;e
things by the real Temper of the Per&s;on, but by
the Mea&s;ure of our Appren&s;ions.</P>

<P>Yes Sir, * here it is, [I pull'd it out of
the Wa&s;tband of my Drawers, where I always
found means to pre&s;erve it, wrap'd up in a peice
of Paper, and pin'd to the Wa&s;tband, and yet
almo&s;t worn out too, with often pining, and remo|ving,
&s;o I gave it to him to read, and he read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this Gentleman in being that
gave you the Bill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, he was alive, and in good Health,
when I came from <HI>London,</HI> which you may &s;ee by
the Date of the Bill, for I came away the next
Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not wonder that the Captain of the
Ship, was willing to get this Bill of you when
you came on Shore here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have given it into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on,
if he would have carryed me, and my Bro|ther
back again to <HI>England,</HI> and have taken what
he ask'd for us out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but he knew better than that too,
he knew if you had any Friends there, they
would call him to an Account for what he had
done; but I wonder he did not take it from you
while you were at Sea, either by Fraud or by
Force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did not attempt that indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, young Man, I have a mind to
try if I can do you any, Service in this Ca&s;e; on
<PB N="159" REF="165">
my Word, if the Money can be paid, and you
can get it &s;afe over, I might put you in a
way how to be a better Man than your Ma&s;ter,
if you will be hone&s;t and diligent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I behave my&s;elf in your Service Sir,
you will I hope judge of the re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But perhaps you Hanker after returning
to <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed Sir, if I can but get my
Bread hone&s;tly here, I have no mind to go to
<HI>England,</HI> for I know not how to get my Bread
there, if I had I had not Li&s;ted for a Soldier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I mu&s;t ask you &s;ome Que&s;tions
about that Part hereafter, for 'tis indeed &s;ome|thing
&s;trange, that you &s;hould Li&s;t for a Soldier,
when you had 94l. in your Pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall give your Wor&s;hip as particu|lar
Account of that, as I have of the other Part
of my Life, if you plea&s;e, but 'tis very long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we will have that another time;
but to the Ca&s;e in Hand, Are you willing I &s;hould
&s;end to any Body at <HI>London,</HI> to talk with that
Gentleman that gave you the Bill; not to take
the Money of him, but to ask him only whether
he has &s;o much Money; of yours in his Hands?
and whether he will Part with it, when you &s;hall
give Order, and &s;end the Bill, or a * Duplicate
of it * (<HI>that is, &s;ays he,</HI> the Copy) and it was
well he did &s;ay &s;o, <HI>for I did not under&s;tand the
Word</HI> [Duplicate at all.]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, I will give you the Bill it &s;elf
if you plea&s;e, I can tru&s;t it with you, tho' I cou'd
not with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, young Man, I won't take it
from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h your Wor&s;hip would plea&s;e to
<PB N="160" REF="166">
keep it for me, for if I &s;hould lo&s;e it, then I am
quite undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will keep it for you <HI>Jack</HI> if you will, but
then you &s;hall have a Note under my Hand, &s;igni|fying
that I have it, and will return it you upon
Demand, which will be &s;afe to you as the Bill, I
won't take it el&s;e.</P>
<P>So I gave my Ma&s;ter the Bill, and he gave me
his Note for it, and he was a faithful Steward for
me, as you will hear in its Place: After this Con|ference,
I was di&s;&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and went to my Work,
but about two Hours after, the Steward or the O|ver&s;eer
of the Plantation came riding by, and
coming up to me as I was at Work, pull'd a Bot|tle
out of his Pocket, and calling me to him, gave
me a Dram of Rum, when in good Manners, I
had taken but a little Sup, he held it out to me
again, and bad me take another, and &s;poke won|derous
civilly to me, quite otherwi&s;e than he
us'd to do.</P>
<P>THIS encouraged me, and hearten'd me very
much, but yet I had no particular View of any
thing, or which way I &s;hould have any Relief.</P>
<P>A DAY or two after, when we were all going
out to our Work in the Morning, the Over&s;eer
call'd me to him again, and gave me a Dram, and
a good peice of Bread, and bad me come off from
my Work about One a-Clock, and come to him
to the Hou&s;e, for he mu&s;t &s;peak with me.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to him, I came to be &s;ure in
the ordinary Habit of a poor half naked Slave;
Come hither young Man, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and give me
your Hoe, when I gave it him; well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
you are to Work no more, in this Plantation.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="167">
I look'd &s;urpriz'd, and as if I was Frighted,
What have I done, Sir? <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and whether am
I to be &s;ent away.</P>
<P>NAY, nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and look'd very plea&s;ant|ly
do not be frighted, 'tis for your good, 'tis not
to hurt you, I am order'd to make an Over&s;eer of
you, and you &s;hall be a Slave no longer.</P>
<P>ALAS! <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> to him, I, an Over&s;eer! I am in
no Condition for it, I have no Cloaths to put on,
no Linnen, nothing to help my&s;elf.</P>
<P>WELL, well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you may be better us'd
than you are aware of, come hither with me; &s;o
he led me into a va&s;t great Ware-hou&s;e, or rather
Set of Ware-hou&s;es, one within another, and cal|ling
the Ware-hou&s;e-Keeper, <HI>here &s;ays he,</HI> you mu&s;t
Cloth this Man, and give him every thing nece&s;|&s;ary,
upon the Foot of Number Five, and give
the Bill to me, our Ma&s;ter has order'd me to al|low
it, in the Account of the We&s;t Plantation:
That was it &s;eems the Plantation where I was
to go.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the Ware-hou&s;e Keeper car|ryed
me into an Inner-Ware-hou&s;e, where were
&s;everal Suites of Cloths of the Sort his Orders
mention'd; which were plain but good &s;orts of
Cloths ready made, being of a good Broad Cloth,
about 115. a Yard in <HI>England,</HI> and with this he
gave me three good Shirts, two Pair of Shoes,
Stockings and Gloves, a Hat, &s;ix Neckcloths,
and in &s;hort, every thing I could want; and when
he had look'd every thing out, and fitted them,
he lets me into a little Room by it &s;elf; here
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> go in there a Slave, and come out a Gen|tleman;
and with that carryed every thing into
the Room, and &s;hutting the Door, bid me put them
on, which I did mo&s;t willingly; and now you
<PB N="162" REF="168">
may believe, that I began to hope for &s;ome|thing
better than ordinary.</P>
<P>IN a little while after this, came the Over|&s;eer,
and gave me Joy of my new Cloths, and
told me I mu&s;t go with him; &s;o I was carried to
another Plantation larger than that where I
work'd before, and where there were two Over|&s;eers,
or Clerks, One within Doors, and Two with|out:
This la&s;t was remov'd to another Plantati|on,
and I was plac'd there in his room, <HI>that is
to &s;ay,</HI> as the Clerk without Doors, and my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
was to look after the Servants <HI>Negroes,</HI> and
take Care that they did their Bu&s;ine&s;s, provide
their Food, and in &s;hort, both Govern and Di|rect
them.</P>
<P>I WAS elevated to the highe&s;t degree in my
Thoughts at this Advancement, and it is impo&s;&s;i|ble
for me to expre&s;s the Joy of my Mind upon
this Occa&s;ion; but there came a difficulty up|on
me, that &s;hock'd me &s;o violently, and went
&s;o again&s;t my very Nature, that I really had al|mo&s;t
forfeited my Place about it; and in all
Appearance the Favour of our Ma&s;ter, who had
been &s;o generous to me; and this was, that when
I entered upon my Office, I had a Hor&s;e given
me, and a long Hor&s;e-whip, like what we call in
<HI>England</HI> a Hunting-whip; the Hor&s;e was to ride
up and down all over the Plantation to &s;ee the
Servants and <HI>Negroes</HI> did their Work, and the
Plantation being &s;o large, it could not be done on
Foot, at lea&s;t &s;o often, and &s;o effectually as was re|quir'd;
and the Hor&s;e-whip was given me to correct
and la&s;h the Slaves and Servants, when they pro|ved
Negligent, or Quarrel&s;ome, or in &s;hort were
guilty of any Offence: This part turn'd the ve|ry
blood within my Veins, and I could not think
<PB N="163" REF="169">
of it with any temper; that I, who was but Ye|&s;terday
a Servant or Slave like them, and under
the Authority of the &s;ame La&s;h, &s;hould lift up
my Hand to the Cruel Work, which was my Ter|ror
but the Day before: This I &s;ay, I cou'd not
do; in&s;omuch, that the <HI>Negroes</HI> perceiv'd it, and
I had &s;oon &s;o much Contempt upon my Authori|ty,
that we were all in Di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE Ingratitude of their Return, for the Com|pa&s;&s;ion
I &s;hew'd them, provok'd me, I Confe&s;s,
and a little harden'd my Heart, and I began with
the <HI>Negroes,</HI> two of whom I was oblig'd to Cor|rect;
and I thought I did it mo&s;t Cruelly; but after
I had La&s;h'd them till every Blow I &s;truck them,
hurt my &s;elf, and I was ready to Faint at the
Work, the Rogues Laught at me, and one of them
had the Impudence to &s;ay behind my Back, that
if he had the Whipping of me, he would &s;how me
better how to Whip a <HI>Negro.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, however, I had no Power to do it in
&s;uch a Barbarous manner, as I found it was nece&s;|&s;ary
to have it done; and the Defect began to be
a Detriment to our Ma&s;ters B$&s;ine&s;s, and now I
began indeed to &s;ee, that the Cruelty, &s;o much
talk'd of, u&s;ed in <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and o|ther
Colonies, in Whipping the <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves, was
not &s;o much owing to the Tyranny, and Pa&s;$ion,
and Cruelty of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as had been reported;
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> not being accounted to be of a Cruel
Di&s;po&s;ition, and really are not &s;o: But that it is
owing to the Brutallity, and ob&s;tinate Temper
of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> who cannot be mannag'd by Kind|ne&s;s,
and Courti&s;y; but mu&s;t be rul'd with a Rod
of Iron, beaten with <HI>Scorpions,</HI> as the Scripture
calls it; and mu&s;t be u&s;ed as they do u&s;e them, or
they would Ri&s;e and Murther all their Ma&s;ters,
<PB N="164" REF="170">
which their Numbers con&s;ider'd, would not be hard
for them to do, if they had Arms and Ammuni|tion
&s;uitable to the Rage and Cruelty of their
Nature.</P>
<P>BUT I began to &s;ee at the &s;ame time, that this
Brutal temper of the <HI>Negroes</HI> was not rightly ma|nag'd;
that they did not take the be&s;t Cour&s;e
with them, to make them &s;en&s;ible, either of Mer|oy,
or Puni&s;hment; and it was Evident to me,
that even the wor&s;t of tho&s;e tempers might be
brought to a Compliance, without the La&s;h, or
at lea&s;t without &s;o much of it, as they generally
Inflicted</P>
<P>OUR Ma&s;ter was really a Man of Humanity
him&s;elf, and was &s;ometimes &s;o full of Tenderne&s;s,
that he would forbid the Severities of his Over|&s;eers
and Stewards; but he &s;aw the Nece&s;&s;ity of
it, and was oblig'd at la&s;t to leave it to the Di&s;|cretion
of his upper Servants: yet he would often
bid them be Merciful, and bid them con&s;ider the
Difference of the Con&s;titution of the Bodies of
the <HI>Negro</HI>'s; &s;ome being le&s;s able to bear the Tor|tures
of their Puni&s;hment than others, and &s;ome
of them le&s;s Ob&s;tinate too, than others.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, &s;ome body was &s;o officious as to
inform him again&s;t me upon this Occa&s;ion, and let
him know, that I Neglected his Affairs, and that
the Servants were under no Government; by
which means his Plantation was not duly ma|nag'd,
and that all things were in Di&s;order.</P>
<P>THIS was a heavy Charge for a young Over|&s;eer,
and his Honour came like a Judge, with all
his Attendants, to look into things, and hear the
Cau&s;e: However, he was &s;o ju&s;t to me, as that
before he Cen&s;ur'd me, he re&s;olv'd to hear me
fully; and that not only Publickly, but in Pri|vate
<PB N="165" REF="171">
too; and the la&s;t part of this was my parti|cular
good Fortune, for as he had formerly allow'd
me to &s;peak to him with Freedom; &s;o I had the
like Freedom now, and had full Liberty to Ex|plain,
and Defend my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I knew nothing of the Complaint again&s;t me,
till I had it from his own Mouth; nor any thing
of his coming, till I &s;aw him in the very Planta|tion,
viewing his Work, and viewing the &s;everal
Peices of Ground that were order'd to be New
Planted; and after he had Rod all round, and
&s;een things in the Condition, which they were to
be &s;een in; how every thing was in its due Order,
and the Servants and <HI>Negroes</HI> were all at Work,
and every thing appearing to his Mind, he went
into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As I &s;aw him come up the Walks, I ran to|wards
him, made my Homage, and gave him my
humble Thanks for the Goodne&s;s he had &s;hew'd
me, in taking me from the Mi&s;erable Condition
I was in before, and Employing and Entru&s;t|ing
me in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and he look'd plea&s;ant
enough, tho' he did not &s;ay much at fir&s;t, and I
attended him thro' the whole Plantation, gave
him an Account of every thing as he went along,
an&s;wer'd all his Objections, and Enquiries, every
where in &s;uch a manner, as it &s;eems, he did not
expect: And, as he acknowledg'd afterward, every
thing was very much to his Satisfaction.</P>
<P>THERE was an Over&s;eer, as I ob&s;erv'd; belong|ing
to the &s;ame Plantation, who was, tho' not
over me, yet in a Work Superior to mine; for
his Bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;ee the <HI>Tobacco</HI> pack'd up, and
deliver it either on Board the Sloops, or otherwi&s;e,
as our Ma&s;ter order'd, and to receive <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Goods from the Grand Ware-hou&s;e, which was at
<PB N="166" REF="172">
the other Plantation, becau&s;e, that was neare&s;t
the Water-&s;ide; and in &s;hort, to keep the Ac|counts:
This Over&s;eer, an Hone&s;t and upright
Man, made no Complaint to him of his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
being Neglected, as above, or of any thing
like it, tho' he Enquir'd of him about it, and that
very &s;trictly too.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have &s;aid, that as he Rid over the Plan|tation;
he came in his round to the Place where
the Servants were u&s;ually Corrected, when they
had done any Fault; and there &s;tood two <HI>Negroes</HI>
with their Hands ty'd behind them, as it were
under Sentence; and when he came near them,
they fell on their Knees, and made pitiful Signs
to him for Mercy: Alas! Alas! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> turning
to me, why did you bring me this way? I do not
love &s;uch Sights, what mu&s;t I do now? I mu&s;t
Pardon them; prethee, what have they done? I
told him the particular Offences, which they were
brought to the Place for; one had Stole a Bottle
of Rum, and had made him&s;elf Drunk with it,
and when he was Drunk, had done a great many
Mad things, and had attempted to knock one of
the white Servants Brains out with a Hand-&s;pike;
but that the white Man had avoided the Blow,
and &s;triking up the <HI>Negroes</HI> Heels, had &s;eiz'd him,
and brought him Pri&s;oner thither, where he had
lain all Night; and that I had told him he was to
be Whipp'd that Day, and the next three Days,
twice every Day.</P>
<P>AND could you be &s;o Cruel, <HI>&s;ays his Honour,</HI>
why, you would Kill the poor Wretch! and &s;o
be&s;ide the Blood which you would have to an&s;wer
for, you would lo&s;e me a lu&s;ty Man <HI>Negro,</HI> which
Co&s;t me at lea&s;t 30 or 40<HI>l.</HI> and bring a Reproach
upon my whole Plantation; nay, and more than
<PB N="167" REF="173">
that, &s;ome of them in Revenge would Murther me,
if ever it was in their Power.</P>
<P>SIR, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> if tho&s;e Fellows are not kept under
by Violence, I believe you are Satisfied, nothing
is to be done with them; and it is reported in
your Works, that I have been rather their Je&s;t,
than their Terror, for want of u&s;ing them as they
de&s;erve; and I was re&s;olv'd how much&s;oever it is
again&s;t my own Di&s;po&s;ition, that you Service
&s;hould not &s;uffer for my un&s;ea&s;onable Forbear|ance;
and therefore, if I had Scourg'd him to
Death:&mdash;Hold, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> no, no, by no means,
any &s;uch Severity in my Bounds; remember
young Man, you were once a Servant, deal as
you would acknowledge'd it would be ju&s;t to deal
with you in his Ca&s;e, and mingle always &s;ome
Mercy; I de&s;ire it, and let the Con&s;equence of
being too gentle, be plac'd to my Account.</P>
<P>THIS was as much as I cou'd de&s;ire, and the
more, becau&s;e what pa&s;s'd, was in Publick, and
&s;everal, both <HI>Negroes</HI> and white Servants, as
well as the particular Per&s;ons, who had accu&s;ed
me, heard it all, tho' I did not know it: A Cruel
Dog of an Over&s;eer, <HI>&s;ays one of the white Ser|vants
behind,</HI> he would have Whipp'd poor <HI>Bul|let-head,</HI>
(<HI>&s;o they call'd the</HI> Negro, that was to be
Puni&s;h'd) to Death, if <HI>his Honour</HI> had not hap|pen'd
to come to Day.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I urg'd the Notorious Crime this
Fellow was Guilty off, and the Danger there was
in &s;uch Forbearance, from the Refactory and in|corrigible
Temper of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> and pre&s;s'd a
little the Nece&s;&s;ity of making Examples; but <HI>he
&s;aid,</HI> well, well, do it the next time, but not
&s;o, I &s;aid no more.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174">
THE other Fellows Crime was trifling, com|par'd
with this; and the Ma&s;ter went forward,
talking of it to me, and I following him, till we
came to the Hou&s;e; when after he had been &s;at
down a while, he call'd me to him: And not
&s;uffering my Accu&s;ers to come near, till he had
heard my Defence, he began with me thus.</P>

<P>Hark ye, young Man, I mu&s;t have &s;ome
Di&s;cour&s;e with you: Your Conduct is Complain'd
of, &s;ince I &s;et you over this Plantation; I thought
your Sence of the Obligation I had laid on you,

<P>I am very &s;orry any Complaint &s;hould

<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I humbly Thank <HI>your Honour,</HI> I have but
one Petition more, <HI>and that is,</HI> that I may know

with, is ju&s;t contrary to what appear'd to me ju&s;t

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I may be permitted to Gue&s;s, Sir, I
believe I know the Charge that is brought again&s;t
me; and that <HI>your Honour</HI> has been told, that I
have been too gentle with the <HI>Negroes,</HI> as well as
with other Servants; and that when, they have
de&s;erv'd to be us'd with the accu&s;tom'd Severity

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the la&s;t Part could be true, I would be

Satisfaction to me, that my Bu&s;ine&s;s not being
Neglected, nor our &s;afety Endanger'd, tho&s;e poor

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I freely acknowledge, Sir, that at fir&s;t,
it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to bring my &s;elf to that
Terrible Work: How could I, that was but ju&s;t
come out of the Terror of it my &s;elf, and had but
the Day before been a poor Naked mi&s;erable Ser|vant
my &s;elf, and might be to Morrow reduc'd

lea&s;t, Sir, when my Duty made it ab&s;olutely Ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
I cou'd not do it without the utmo&s;t
Horror: I be&s;eech you Pardon me, if I have &s;uch
a Tenderne&s;s in my Nature, that tho' I might be
fit to be your Servant; I am incapable of being
an Executioner, having been an Offender my &s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but how then can my Bu&s;ine&s;s be
done? And how will this terrible Ob&s;tinacy of

<P>This brings me, Sir, to the latter part of
my Defence; and here, I hope <HI>your Honour</HI> will
be plea&s;ed to call my Accu&s;ers, or that you will
give your &s;elf the Trouble of taking the exacte&s;t
View of your Plantation, and &s;ee, or let them
&s;hew you, if any thing is Neglected, if your Bu|&s;ine&s;s
has &s;uffer'd in any thing, or if your <HI>Negroes</HI>
or other Servants are under le&s;s Government than
they were before; and if on the contrary, I have
found out that happy Secret, to have good Order
kept, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Plantation done, and
that with Diligence, and Di&s;patch, and that
the <HI>Negroes</HI> are kept in Awe, the natural Temper
of them Subjected, and the Safety and Peace of
your Family &s;ecur'd; as well by gentle Means,
as by Rough, by moderate Correction, as by Tor|ture,
and Barbarity; by a due Awe of ju&s;t Di&s;ci|pline,
as by the Horror of un&s;ufferable Torments,
I hope <HI>your Honour</HI> will not lay that Sin to my
Charge.</P>

Condemn'd Hole yonder, who was to be Whipp'd
eight times in four Days?</P>

<P>Very well, Sir; fir&s;t Sir, he remains un|der
the terrible Appren&s;ions of a Puni&s;hment,
&s;o Severe, as no <HI>Negro</HI> ever had before; this Fel|low,
with your leave, I intended to Relea&s;e to
Morrow, without any Whipping at all, after Talk|ing
to him in my way about his Offence, and
rai&s;ing in his Mind a Sen&s;e of the value of Par|don;
and if this makes him a better Servant than
the &s;evere&s;t Whipping will do, than I p$e&s;ume
you would allow, I have gain'd a Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, Sir, becau&s;e they are never

Mercy is, And what then have they to be Grate|ful
for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art in the right indeed, where
there is no Mercy &s;hew'd, there is no Obligation
laid upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, if they have at any time been
let go, which is very &s;eldom, they are not told
what the Ca&s;e is; they take no pains with them
to imprint Principles of Gratitude on their
Minds, to tell them what Kindne&s;s is &s;hewn

what they might Gain in the End by it.</P>

<P>Your whole Plantation is a Proof of it.
This very Fellow had never acted as he did, if he
had not gotten Rum in his Head, and been out of
the Government of him&s;elf; &s;o that indeed all the
Offence I ought to have puni&s;h'd him for, had been
that of &s;tealing a Bottle of Rum, and drinking it
all up; in which Ca&s;e, like <HI>Noa$,</HI> he did not
know the &s;tr$ngth of it, and when he had it in
his Head he was a mad Man, he was as one
Raging and Di&s;tracted; &s;o that for all the r$&s;t

<P>I de&s;ire nothing, Sir, but your Fa|vour,

<P>You make my very Heart glad within

World, as long as you live.</P>
<P>UPON this, I Bow'd to him very re&s;pectfully,
and told him the following Story. There is a <HI>Ne|groe,</HI>
Sir, in your Plantation, who has been your
<PB N="173" REF="179">
Servant &s;everal Years before I came; he did a Fault
that was of no great Con&s;equence in it&s;elf, but
perhaps would have been wor&s;e, if they had in|deed
gone farther, and I had him brought into the
u&s;ual Place, and ty'd him by the Thumbs for Cor|rection,
and he was told that he &s;hould be Whip|p'd
and Pickl'd in a dreadful manner.</P>
<P>AFTER I had made proper Impre&s;&s;ions on his
Mind, of the Terror of his Puni&s;hment, and
found that he was &s;ufficiently humbled by it, I
went into the Hou&s;e, and caus'd him to be
brought out, ju&s;t as they do when they go to Cor|rect
the <HI>Negroes</HI> on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; when he
was &s;trip'd and ty'd up, he had two La&s;hes gi|ven
him, that were indeed very cruel Ones, and
I call'd to them to hold; <HI>hold &s;aid I,</HI> to the two
Men that had ju&s;t began to lay on upon the poor
Fellow, <HI>hold &s;aid I,</HI> let me talk with him.</P>
<P>So he was taken down, then I began, and repre|&s;ented
to him how kind you, that were his<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">So the <HI>Negroes</HI> call the Owner of the Plantation, or at lea&s;t &s;o they call'd him, becau&s;e he was a great Man in the Country, having three or four large Planatations.</NOTE>
Great
Ma&s;ter had been to him; that you had never
done him any Harm, that you had us'd him
gently, and he had never been brought to this
Puni&s;hment in &s;o many Year, tho' he had done
&s;ome Faults before; that this was a notorious Of|fence,
for he had &s;tolen &s;ome Rum, and made
him&s;elf, and two other <HI>Negroes</HI> Drunk<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To be Drunk in a <HI>Negroe,</HI> is to be be Mad, for when they ge$ Rum they are wor&s;e than Raving, and fit to do any manner of Mi&s;|chief.</NOTE> mad,
and had abus'd two Women <HI>Negroes,</HI> who had
Husbands in our Ma&s;ter's Service, but in ano|ther

Plantation; and play'd &s;everal other Pranks,
and for this I had appointed him this Puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>HE &s;hook his Head, and made Signs, that he
was <HI>muchee &s;orree,</HI> as he call'd it, And what will
you &s;ay, or do, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if I &s;hould prevail with the
Great Ma&s;ter to pardon you? I have a mind to
go and &s;ee if I can beg for you: He told me he
would lye down, let me kill him, me will, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> run
go, fetch, bring for you as long as me live: this
was the opportunity I had a mind to have, to trye
whether as <HI>Negroes</HI> have all the other Faculties of
rea&s;onable Creatures, they had not al&s;o &s;ome
Sen&s;e of Kindne&s;s, &s;ome Principles of natural
Genero&s;ity, which in &s;hort, is the Foundation of
G$atitude; for Gratitude is the Product of gene|roud

<P>YES, Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> it has been carryed on far|ther

you to go, or run for me, you mu&s;t do all that for

that you will be Pardon'd, if you are Pardon'd
at all; for your Offence is again&s;t him, and
what will you &s;ay, will you be Grateful to him,

<P>UPON this, I call'd for my Hor&s;e, and went
from him, and made as if I Rode away to you,
who they told me was in the next Plantation;
and having &s;taid four or five Hours, I came back
and talk'd to him again; told him that I had
waited on you, and that you had heard of his Of|fence,
was highly Provok'd, and had re&s;olv'd to
Cau&s;e him to be &s;everely Puni&s;h'd for an Example
to all the <HI>Negroes</HI> in the Plantation: But that I
had told you how Penitent he was, and how good
he would be if you would Pardon him; and had at
la&s;t had prevail'd on you: That you had told me
what all People &s;aid of the <HI>Negroes;</HI> how, that to
&s;hew them Mercy, was to make them think you
were never in Earne&s;t with them, and that you
did but Triffle and Play with them; However,
that I had told you what he had &s;aid of him&s;elf;
and that it was not true of the <HI>Negroes,</HI>
and that the white Men &s;aid it, but that they
could not know, becau&s;e they did never &s;hew any
Mercy, and therefore had never try'd: That I
had per&s;waded you to &s;hew Mercy, to try whe|ther
kindne&s;s would prevail as much as Cruelty;
and now, Mouchat, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you will be let go,
pray let our Great Ma&s;ter &s;ee that I have &s;aid true;
&s;o I order'd him to be unty'd, gave him a Dram
<PB N="178" REF="184">
of Rum out of my Pocket-bottle, and order'd
them to give him &s;ome Victuals.</P>
<P>WHEN the Fellow was let loo&s;e, he came to
me, and kneel'd down to me, and took hold of
my Legs and of my Feet, and laid his Head upon
the Ground; and Sob'd, and Cry'd, like a Child
that had been Corrected, but could not &s;peak for
his Life; and thus he continu'd a long time: I
would have taken him up, but he would not Ri&s;e,
but I Cry'd as fa&s;t as he, for I could not bear to
&s;ee a poor Wretch lye on the Ground to me, that
was but a Servant the other Day like him&s;elf;
at la&s;t, but not till a quarter of an Hour, I made
him get up, and then he &s;poke. <HI>Me muchee know
good Great Ma&s;ter,</HI> muchee good <HI>you Ma&s;ter: No</HI>
Negro <HI>unthankful,</HI> me Dye <HI>for them, do me &s;o
muchee kind.</HI></P>
<P>I di&s;mi&s;s'd him then, and bad him go to his
Wife, for he was Marry'd, and not Work that
Afternoon; but as he was going away, I call'd
him again, and talk'd thus to him.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Monchat, &s;ays I,</HI> you &s;ee the white Men
can &s;hew Mercy: Now you mu&s;t tell all the <HI>Ne|groes,</HI>
what has been reported of them; that they
Regard nothing but the Whip; that if they are
us'd gently, they are the Wor&s;e, not the Better; and
that this is the Rea&s;on, why the white Man &s;hew
them no Mercy; and convince them, that they
would be much better treated, and us'd kindlier
if they would &s;hew them&s;elves as grateful, for
kind u&s;age, as humble after Torment, and &s;ee if
you can Work on them.</P>
<P>ME go, me go, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> me much&egrave;&egrave; talk to
them, they be much&egrave;&egrave; glad as me be, and do great
Work, to be us'd kind by de Great Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="185">

<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I come next to that Part Sir, about a
Month after this, I caus'd a Report to be &s;pread a|broad
in the Plantation, that I had offended
you the Great Ma&s;ter, and that I was turn'd
out of the Plantation, and was to be hang'd;
your Honour knows that &s;ometime ago, you &s;ent
me upon your particular Bu&s;ine&s;s into <HI>Potuxent</HI>

<P>Yes, Sir, and it made a Di&s;covery in|deed;
the poor Fellow did not believe it pre&s;ent|ly,
but finding I was &s;till Ab&s;ent, he went to the
Head Clerk, and &s;tanding at his Door, &s;aid no|thing,
but look'd like a Fool of 10 Year old;
after &s;ome time, the upper Over&s;eer came out,
and &s;eeing him &s;tand there, at fir&s;t &s;aid nothing,
&s;uppo&s;ing he had been &s;ent of &s;ome Errand; but
ob&s;erving him to &s;tand &s;tock &s;tand &s;tock &s;till, and that he
was in the &s;ame Po&s;ture and Place, during the
time that he had pa&s;s'd and repa&s;s'd two or three

you &s;tand idle here &s;o long?</P>
<P>ME &s;peak&eacute;&egrave;, me tell &s;omething, <HI>&s;ays he.</HI></P>
<P>THEN the Over&s;eer thought &s;ome Di&s;covery

<P>For a good while he &s;tood as if he had
been Thunder-&s;truck, and &s;tupid; but looking
&s;teadily at me, tho' not &s;peaking a Word, at
la&s;t he Mutters to him&s;elf with a kind of a Laugh,

me wakee, me no wakee; no hangee, no hangee,
he live truly, very live; and then on a &s;udden he
runs to me, &s;natches me away as if I had been a
Boy of ten Years old, and takes me up upon his
back, and run away with me, till I was fain to
cry out to him to &s;top; then he &s;ets me down,
and looks at me again, then falls a Dancing a|bout
me, as if he had been bewitch'd, ju&s;t as you
have &s;een them do about their Wives and Chil|dren
when they are Merry.</P>
<P>WELL, then he began to talk with me, and
told me what they had &s;aid to him, how I was
to be hang'd; well, &s;ays I, <HI>Mouchat,</HI> and would
you have been &s;atisfied to be hang'd to &s;ave me,

<P>Now, Sir, your Honour may judge, whether
kindne&s;s well manag'd would not oblige the&s;e
People as well as Cruelty; and whether there
are Principles of Gratitude in them, or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what then can be the Rea&s;on, that
we never believed it to be &s;o before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, I fear that <HI>Mouchat</HI> gave the
true Rea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that Pray? that we were too
Cruel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they never had any Mercy &s;hew'd
them; that we never try'd them, whether they
would be grateful or no; that if they did a Fault,
<PB N="183" REF="189">
they were never &s;par'd, but puni&s;h'd with the
utmo&s;t Cruelty; &s;o that they had no Pa&s;&s;ion, no
Affection to Act upon, but that of Fear, which
nece&s;&s;arily brought Hatred with it; but that if
they were u&s;ed with Compa&s;&s;ion, they would
Serve with Affection, as well as other Servants:
Nature is the &s;ame, and Rea&s;on Governs in ju&s;t
Proportions in all Creatures; But having never
been let Ta&s;te what Mercy is, they know not how
to act from a Principle of Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinc'd, it is &s;o; But now,
pray tell me, how did you put this in Practice
with the poor <HI>Negro's</HI> now in Bonds younder, when
you pa&s;s'd &s;uch a cruel Sentence upon them, that
they &s;hould be whipp'd twice a Day, for four
Days together, was that &s;hewing Mercy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Method was ju&s;t the &s;ame, and if
you plea&s;e to inquire of Mr.&mdash;, your other Ser|vant,
you will be &s;atisfy'd that it was &s;o; for we
agreed upon the &s;ame Mea&s;ures as I took with
<HI>Monchat;</HI> Namely, fir&s;t to put them into the
utmo&s;t Horror and Apprehen&s;ions of the Cru|ele&s;t
Puni&s;hment that they had ever heard of,
and thereby enhaunce the Value of their Pardon,
which was to come as from your &s;elf, but not
without our great Interce&s;&s;ion: Then I was to
argue with them, and Work upon their Rea&s;on,
to make the Mercy that was &s;hew'd them &s;ink
deep into their Minds, and give la&s;ting Impre&s;|&s;ions;
explain the Meaning of Gratitude to them,
and the Nature of an Obligation, and the like, as
I had done with <HI>Mouchat.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am an&s;wer'd, your Method is certain|ly
Right, and I de&s;ire you may go on with it.
for I de&s;ire nothing (on this &s;ide Heaven) m$$
than to have all my <HI>Negroes</HI> &s;erve me from $word$
ciples of Gratitude, for my Kindne&s;s to $span$
<PB N="184" REF="190">
abhor to be fear'd like a Lion, like a Tyrant, it
is a Violence upon Nature every way, and is the
mo&s;t di&s;agreable Thing in the World to a gene|rous
Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, I am doubtful that you may
not believe that I intended to act thus with
tho&s;e poor Fellows; I be&s;eech you to &s;end for
Mr.&mdash;, that he may tell you, what we had
agreed on before I &s;peak with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Rea&s;on have I to doubt that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you have not, but I &s;hould be
very Sorry you &s;hould think me capable of Exe|cuting
&s;uch a Sentence as you have heard me own,
I had p$&s;s'd on them; and there can be no way
effectualy to clear it up, but this.</P>

<P>I hope, Sir, you are now, not only &s;a|tisfy'd

being &s;o proper, and &s;o likely to an&s;wer your End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am fully &s;atisfy'd, and &s;hall be glad
to &s;ee that it an&s;wers the End; for, as I have &s;aid,
nothing can be more agreeable to me, nothing
has &s;o much robb'd me of the Comfort of all my
Fortunes, as the Cruelty u&s;ed in my Name, on
the Bodies of tho&s;e poor Slaves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is certainly wrong, Sir; it is not only
wrong, as it is barbarous and cruel; but it is
wrong too, as it is the wor&s;t way of Managing,
and of having your Bu&s;ine&s;s done.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Ma&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is my Aver&s;ion, it fills my very

poor Creatures, I &s;hould either &s;ink down at the
Sight of it, or fly into a Rage, and kill the Fel|low
that did it; tho' it is done too, by my own

<SP>

<P>But, Sir, I dare &s;ay, I &s;hall convince you
al&s;o that it is wrong, in Re&s;pect of Intere&s;t; and
that your Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be better di&s;charg'd,
and your Plantations better order'd, and more
Work done by the <HI>Negroes,</HI> who &s;hall be engaged
by Mercy and Lenity, than by tho&s;e, who are
driven, and dragg'd by the Whips, and the Chains
of a mercile&s;s Tormentor.</P>

<P>I think the Nature of the Thing &s;peaks

of Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be true, Sir, that there may be
found here and there a <HI>Negro</HI> of a &s;encele&s;s, &s;tu|pid,
&s;ordid Di&s;po&s;ition; perfectly Untractable,
undocible, and incapable of due Impre&s;&s;ions;
e&s;pecially incapable of the Genero&s;ity of Principle
which I am &s;peaking of; you know very well, Sir,
there are &s;uch among Chri&s;tians, as well as among
<HI>Negroes,</HI> whence el&s;e came the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb;
<HI>that if you &s;ave a Thief from the Gallows, he &s;hall

Refractory, undocible Fellow comes in our way,
he mu&s;t be dealt with, fir&s;t, by the &s;inooth ways,

his Temper, as they Break a Hor&s;e; and if no|thing
will do, &s;uch a Wretch &s;hould be Sold off,

the Plantation &s;hould not be broken for one De|vili&s;h
temper'd Fellow; and if this was done, I
doubt not, you &s;hould have all your Plantation
carried on, and your Work done, and not a <HI>Ne|gro</HI>
or a Servant upon it, but what would not on|ly
Work for you, but even Die for you, if there

<SPEAKER>Ma&s;t.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go on with your Mea&s;ures, and
may you &s;ucceed, I'll promi&s;e you I will fully
make you amends for it; I long to have the&s;e
Cruelties out of u&s;e, in my Plantation e&s;pecially,
as for others, let them do as they will.</P>
</SP>
<P>OUR Ma&s;ter being gone, I went to the Pri&s;on|ers,
and fir&s;t, I &s;uffer'd them to be told that the
Great Ma&s;ter had been there, and that he had
been enclin'd to Pardon them, till he knew
what their Crime was; but then he &s;aid it was &s;o
great a Fault that it mu&s;t be Puni&s;h'd: Be&s;ides,
the Man that talk'd to them, told them, that the
Great Ma&s;ter &s;aid, that he knew if he had Pardon'd
them, they would but be the Wor&s;e, for that the
<HI>Negroes</HI> were never thankful for being &s;par'd, and
that there were no other ways to make them Obe|dient,
but Severity.</P>
<P>ONE of the poor Fellows, more &s;en&s;ible than
the other; an&s;wer'd, if any <HI>Negroe</HI> be Bader for
kindly us'd, they &s;hould be Whipped till they
were much$$ better, but that he never knew that,
for he never knew the <HI>Negroe</HI> be kindly u&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS was the &s;ame thing as the other had &s;aid,
and indeed, was but too true, for the Over&s;eers
really knew no &s;uch thing as Mercy; and that
<PB N="187" REF="193">
Notion of the <HI>Negroes</HI> being no other way to be
govern'd but by Cruelty, had been the Occa&s;ion,
that no other Method was ever try'd among them.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if a &s;lack Hand has been at any time
been held upon them; it had not been done with
Di&s;cretion, or as a point of Mercy; and manag'd
with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Argument to convince the
<HI>Negroes</HI> of the Nature and Rea&s;on of it, and to
&s;hew them what they ought to do in Return for
it: But it was perhaps the effect of Negligence,
ill Conduct, and want of Application to the Bu|&s;ine&s;s
of the Plantation; and then'twas no won|der
that the <HI>Negroes</HI> took the Advantage of it.</P>
<P>WELL, I carried on the Affair with the&s;e two
<HI>Negroes,</HI> ju&s;t as I did with <HI>Mouchat,</HI> &s;o I need
not repeat the particulars, and they were deliver'd
with infinite Acknowledgments and Thanks, even
to all the Extravagancies of Joy u&s;ual in tho&s;e
People on &s;uch Occa&s;ion; and &s;uch was the Gra|titude
of tho&s;e two pardon'd Fellows, that they
were the mo&s;t Faithful, and mo&s;t Diligent Ser|vants
ever after, that belong'd to the whole Plan|tation,
<HI>Mouchat</HI> excepted.</P>
<P>IN this manner I carried on the Plantation
fully to his Satisfaction; and before a Year more
was expir'd, there was &s;car&s;e any &s;uch thing as
Correction known in the Plantation; except upon
a few Boys who were incapable of the Impre&s;&s;i|ons,
that good U&s;uage would have made, even
upon them too, till they had liv'd to know the
Difference.</P>
<P>IT was &s;ome time after this Conference, that our
Great Ma&s;ter, <HI>as we call'd him,</HI> &s;ent for me again to
his Dwelling-hou&s;e, and told me he had, had an
An&s;wer from <HI>England</HI> from his Friend, to whom
he had written about my Bill: I was a little
<PB N="188" REF="194">
afraid that he was going to ask me leave to &s;end
it to <HI>London:</HI> But he did not &s;ay any thing like
that: But told me that his Friend had been with
the Gentleman, and that he own'd the Bill, and
that he had all the Money in his Hand, that the
Bill had mention'd; but that he had promis'd the
young Man, that had given him the Money, (mean|ing
me,) not to pay the Money to any Body but
him&s;elf, tho' they &s;hould bring the Bill; the
Rea&s;on of which was, that I did not know who
might get the Bill away from me.</P>
<P>BUT now, Col. <HI>Jack, &s;ays he,</HI> as you Wrote
him an Account where you was, and by what
wicked Arts you were Trapann'd; and that it
was impo&s;&s;ible for you to have your Liberty till
you cou'd get the Money: My Friend at <HI>London</HI>
has written to me, that upon making out a due
Copy of the Bill here, atte&s;ted by a notary, and
&s;ent to him, and your Obligation likewi&s;e atte&s;t|ed;
whereby you oblige your &s;elf to Deliver the
Original to his Order, after the Money is paid,
he will pay the Money.</P>
<P>I told him I was willing to do whatever his
Honour directed; and &s;o the proper Copies were
drawn, as I had been told were requir'd.</P>
<P>BUT now, what will you do with this Money,
<HI>Jack? &s;ays he</HI> &s;miling, will you Buy your Liber|ty
of me, and go to Planting?</P>
<P>I was too cunning for him, now, indeed, for I re|member'd
what he had promis'd me; and I had
too much Knowledge of the Hone&s;ty of his Prin|ciples,
as well as of the Kindne&s;s he had for me;
to doubt his being as good as his Word; &s;o I
turn'd all this Talk of his upon him another way;
I knew that when he ask'd me if I would Buy
my Liberty and go to Planting, it was to try if
<PB N="189" REF="195">
I would leave him; &s;o, I &s;aid, as to buying my
Liberty, Sir, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> going out of your Service,
I had much rather Buy more time in your Ser|vice,
and I am only unhappy that I have but two
Year to &s;erve.</P>
<P>COME, come, Col. <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> don't flatter me, I
love plain Dealing, Liberty is precious to every
Body; if you have a Mind to have your Money
brought over, you &s;hall have your Liberty to be|gin
for your &s;elf, and I will take care you &s;hall
be well us'd by the Country, and get you a good
Plantation.</P>
<P>I &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that I would not quit his Ser|vice
for the be&s;t Planation in <HI>Maryland;</HI> that he
had been &s;o good to me, and I believ'd I was &s;o
u&s;eful to him, that I cou'd not think of it; and
at la&s;t, I added, I hop'd he cou'd not believe but
I had as much Gratitude as a <HI>Negro.</HI></P>
<P>HE &s;mil'd, and &s;aid, he would not be &s;erv'd
upon tho&s;e Terms; that he did not forget what
he had promis'd, nor what I had done in his Plan|tation;
and that he was re&s;olv'd in the fir&s;t place
to give me my Liberty, &s;o he Pulls out a peiece
of Paper, and throws it to me, there, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
there's a Certificate of your coming on Shore, and
being Sold to me for five Years, of which you
have liv'd three with me, and now you are your
own Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I Bow'd, and told him, that I was &s;ure if I was
my own Ma&s;ter, I would be his Servant as long
as he would accept of my Service; and now we
&s;train'd Courtifies; and he told me I &s;hould be
his Servant &s;till: But it &s;hould be on two Condi|tions.
(1.) That he would give me 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year,
and my Board, for my managing the Plantation
I was then employ'd in; and (2.) That at the
<PB N="190" REF="196">
&s;ame time he would procure me a new Planatation
to begin upon for my own Account; for Col.
<HI>Jack, &s;ays he,</HI> &s;miling, tho' you are but a young
Man, yet 'tis time you were doing &s;omething for
your &s;elf.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd, that I cou'd do little at a Plantati|on
for my &s;elf, unle&s;s I Neglected his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
which I was re&s;olv'd not to do on any Terms
whatever: But that I would &s;erve him Faithfully
if he would accept of me as long as he liv'd: So
you &s;hall, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> again, and &s;erve your &s;elf too;
and thus we parted for that time.</P>
<P>HERE I am to ob&s;erve in the general, to
avoid dwelling too long upon a Story; that as the
two <HI>Negroes</HI> who I deliver'd from Puni&s;hment,
were ever after the mo&s;t Diligent, and Laborious
poor Fellows in the whole Plantation, as above;
except <HI>Mouchat,</HI> of whom I &s;hall &s;peak more by
and by, &s;o they not only were Grateful them|&s;elves
for their good u&s;uage, but they Influenc'd
the whole Plantation: So that the Gentle u&s;uage
and Lenity, with which they had been treat|ed,
had a Thou&s;and times more Influence
upon them, to make them Diligent, than all the
Blows and Kicks, Whippings, and other Tortures
could have, which they had been us'd to, and
now the Planation was famous for it; &s;o that &s;e|veral
other Planters began to do the &s;ame, tho' I
cannot &s;ay it was with the &s;ame Succe&s;s; which
might be for want of taking Pains with them,
and working upon their Pa&s;&s;ions in a right man|ner;
it appeard that <HI>Negroes</HI> were to be rea&s;on'd
into things as well as other People, and it was
by thus managing their Rea&s;on, that mo&s;t of the
Work was done.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="197">
HOWEVER, (as it was) the Plantations in <HI>Mary|land,</HI>
were the better for this Undertaking, and they
are to this Day le&s;s Cruel and Barbarous to their
<HI>Negroes,</HI> than they are in <HI>Barbados,</HI> and <HI>Jamica;</HI>
and 'tis ob&s;erv'd the <HI>Negroes</HI> are not in the&s;e
Colonies &s;o de&s;perate, neither do they &s;o often
run away, or &s;o often Plot mi&s;chief again&s;t their
Ma&s;ter, as they do in tho&s;e.</P>
<P>I HAVE dwelt the longer upon it, that if po&s;|&s;ible
Po&s;terity might be per&s;waded to try gentler
Methods with tho&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures, and to
u&s;e them with Humanity; a&s;&s;uring them, that if
they did &s;o, adding the common Prudence that
every particular Ca&s;e, would direct them to for
it&s;elf, the <HI>Negroes</HI> would do their Work fatihful|ly,
and chearfully; they would not find any
of that refractorine&s;s, and &s;ullenne&s;s in their
Temper, that they pretend now to complain of;
but they would be the &s;ame as their Chri&s;tian
Servants, except that they would be the more
Thankful and Humble, and Laborious of the Two.</P>
<P>I Continue'd in this Station between five and
&s;ix Year after this, and in all that time we had not
one <HI>Negroe</HI> whipp'd, except as I ob&s;erv'd before,
now and then an unluckly Boy, and that only for
Triffles; I cannot &s;ay, but we had &s;ome ill-na|tured
ungovernable <HI>Negroes;</HI> but if at any time
&s;uch Offended, they were Pardon'd the fir&s;t Time,
in the manner as above; and the &s;econd Time were
ordered to be turn'd out of the Plantation; and this
was remarkable that they would Torment them|&s;elves
at the Apprehen&s;ions of being turn'd away,
more by a great deal, than if they had been to
be whipp'd, for then they were only Sullen and
Heavy; nay, at length we found the fear of be|ing
turn'd out of the Plantation, had as much
<PB N="192" REF="198">
Effect to Reform them, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> make them
more diligent, than any Torture would have done;
and the Rea&s;on was Evident, namely, becau&s;e
in our Plantation, they were us'd like Men, in
the other like Dogs.</P>
<P>MY Ma&s;ter own'd the Satisfaction, he took in
this ble&s;&s;ed Change, as he call'd it, as long as he li|ved,
and as he was &s;o engag'd, by &s;eeing the <HI>Negroes</HI>
Grateful, he &s;hew'd the &s;ame Principle of Grati|tude
to tho&s;e that &s;erv'd him, as he look'd for in
tho&s;e that he &s;erv'd; and particularly to me, and
&s;o I come briefly to that Part: The fir&s;t thing he
did after giving me my Liberty, <HI>as above,</HI> and
making me an allowance, was to get the Country
Bounty to me, that is to &s;ay, of a Quantity of
Land to begin, and Plant for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT this he manag'd Away by him&s;elf, and
as I found afterwards took up, <HI>that is,</HI> purcha&s;ed in
my Name, about 300 Acres of Land in a more con|venient
Place, than it would have otherwi&s;e been
Allotted me; and this he did by his Intere&s;t with
the Lord Proprietor; &s;o that I had an extent of
Ground mark'd out to me, not next, but very near
one of his own Plantations: When I made my
acknowledgement for this to him, he told me
plainly, that I was not beholding to him for it
at all; for he did it, that I might not be oblig'd
to neglect his Bu&s;ine&s;s for the carrying on my
own, and on that Account he would not reckon
to me what Money he paid, which however, ac|cording
to the Cu&s;tom of the Country was not
a very great Sum, I think about 40 or 50 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>THUS he very generou&s;ly gave me my Liber|ty,
advanc'd this Money for me, put me into a
Plantation for my&s;elf, and gave me 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year
<PB N="193" REF="199">
Wages for looking after one of his own Plan|tations.</P>
<P>BUT Colonel, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> to me, giving you this
Plantation is nothing at all to you, if I do not
a&s;&s;i&s;t you to &s;upport it, and to carry it o$$, and
therefore I will give you Credit for what over is
needful to you for the carrying it on; &s;uch
as Tools, Provi&s;ions for Servants, and &s;ome
Servants to begin; Materials to build Out-Hou&s;es,
and Conveniences of all Sorts for the
Plantation, and to buy Hogs, Cows, Hor&s;es
for Stock, and the like, and I'll take it out of
your Cargo, which will come from <HI>London,</HI> for
the Money of your Bill.</P>
<P>THIS was highly obliging and very kind, and
the more &s;o, as it afterwards appear'd; in order
to this, he &s;ent two Servants of his own, who
were Carpenters, as for Timber, Boards, Planks,
and all Sorts of &s;uch Things in a Country almo&s;t
all made of Wood, they could not be wanting: The&s;e
$un me up a little wooden Hou&s;e in le&s;s than three
Weeks time, where I had three Rooms, a Kit|chin,
an Out-Hou&s;e, and two large Sheds at a di|&s;tance
from the Hou&s;e, for Store-hou&s;es, almo&s;t like
Barns, with Stables at the End of them; and thus
I was Set up in the World, and in Short, remo|ved
by the degrees that you have heard from a
Pick-pocket, to a Kidnapp'd mi&s;erable Slave in
<HI>Virginia;</HI> (for <HI>Maryland,</HI> is <HI>Virginia,</HI> &s;peaking of
them at a di&s;tance,) than from a Slave to a Head
Officer, and Over&s;eer of Slaves, and from thence
to a Ma&s;ter Planter.</P>
<P>I HAD now as above, a Hou&s;e, a Stable, two
Ware-hou&s;es, and 300 Acres of Lano; but <HI>as we
&s;ay,</HI> bare Walls make g$ddy Hu&s;&s;y's, &s;o I had nei|ther
<PB N="194" REF="200">
Axe or Hatchet, to cut down<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note</HI> all the Land before it is plan$ed is over grown with high Trees, which mu&s;t be cut down, and grubb'd up, before any thing call'd Planting can be begun.</NOTE> the Trees;
Hor&s;e, or Hog, or Cow to put upon the Land;
not a Hoe, or a Spade to break Ground, nor a
Pair of Hands, but my own to go to Work upon it.</P>
<P>BUT Heaven and kind Ma&s;ters, make up all
tho&s;e things to a diligent Servant; and I menti|on
it, becau&s;e People, who are either Tran&s;port|ed,
or otherwi&s;e Trappan'd into tho&s;e Places, are
generally thought to be rendered mi&s;erable, and
undone; whereas, on the contrary, I would en|courage
them upon my own Experience to de|pend
upon it, that if their own Diligence in the
time of Service, gains them but a good Character,
which it will certainly do, if they can
de&s;erve it, there is not the poore&s;t, and mo&s;t de|&s;picable
Felon that ever went over, but may
after his time is &s;erv'd, begin for him&s;elf, and may
in time be &s;ure of rai&s;ing a good Plantation.</P>
<Q><P>FOR Example, I will now take a Man in the
meane&s;t Circum&s;tances of a Servant, who
has &s;erv'd out his 5 or 7 Years, (&s;uppo&s;e a
Tran&s;ported Wretch for 7 Years.) The cu|&s;tom
of the Place was then (what it is &s;ince
I know not) that on his Ma&s;ter's certifying
that he had &s;erv'd his time out faithfully he
had 50 Acres of Land allotted him, for
Planting, and on this Plan he begins.</P>
<P>SOME had a Hor&s;e, a Cow, and three Hogs
given, or rather lent them as a Stock for
the Land, which they made an allowance
for, at a certain Time and Rate.</P></Q>

&s;hall Plant; nor is it in the Debtors power

add, no Diligent Man ever Mi&s;carried, if he
had Health to Work, and was a good Husband;

every Year adding more Land, and Pla$ting

<P>BUT I Return to my own Story, I was now a
Pla$ter, and encourag'd by a kind Benefactor,
for, that I might not be wholly taken up with my
new Plantation, he gave me freely, and without
any Con&s;ideration my grateful Negro <HI>Mouchat:</HI>
He told me it was a Debt due to the Affection
that poor Creature had always had for me; and
&s;o indeed, it was, for as the Fellow would once
have been Hang'd for me, &s;o now, and to his la&s;t
he lov'd me &s;o much, that it was apparent he did
every thing with Plea&s;ure that he did for me;
and he was &s;o overcome of Joy when he heard he
was to be my <HI>Negro,</HI> that the People in the Plan|tation
really thought it would turn his Head, and
that the Fellow would go Di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, he &s;ent me two Servants more,
a Man and a Woman, but the&s;e he put to my
Account, as above: <HI>Mouchat,</HI> and the&s;e two fell
immediately to Work for me; and they began
with about 2 Acres of Land, which had but little
Timber on it at fir&s;t, and mo&s;t of that was Cut
down by the two <HI>Carpenters</HI> who built my Hou&s;e,
(or &s;hed, rather, for &s;o it &s;hould be call'd.)</P>
<P>THESE two Acres I got in good Forwardne&s;s,
and mo&s;t of it well Planted with <HI>Tobacco;</HI> tho'
&s;ome of it we were oblig'd to plant with Garden
Stuff for Food; &s;uch as Potatoes, Carrots, Cab|bages,
Peas, Beans, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT was a great Advantage to me, that I had
&s;o Bountiful a Ma&s;ter, who help'd me out in every
Ca&s;e; for in this very fir&s;t Year I receiv'd a Ter|rible
<PB N="197" REF="203">
Blow, for my Bill as I have ob&s;erv'd, ha|ving
been Coppy'd, and Atte&s;ted in Form, and
&s;ent to <HI>London:</HI> My kind Friend and <HI>Cu&s;tom hou&s;e</HI>
Gentleman paid me the Money; and the Mer|chant
at <HI>London,</HI> by my Good Ma&s;t$rs Direction,
had laid it all out in a &s;orted Ca$go of G$ods for
me, &s;uch as would have made a Man of $word$ all at

the Ship was L$&s;t, and that ju&s;t at the En|trance
into the Capes, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> the Mouth
of the Bay; &s;ome of the Goods were recover'd,
but &s;poil'd, and in &s;hort, nothing but the Nails,
Tools, and Iron-work were good for any thing,
and tho' the Value of them was pretty Con&s;i$e|rable
in Proportion to the re&s;t, yet, my lo&s;s was
irreparably Great, and indeed, the Greatne&s;s of
the lo&s;s to me con&s;i&s;ted in its being Irreparable.</P>
<P>I was perfectly A&s;to$$i&s;h'd at the fir&s;t News of
the lo&s;s, knowing that I was in Debt to $word$ Pa|tron,
or Ma&s;ter, &s;o much, that it mu&s;t be &s;everal
Years before I &s;hould recover it; and as he brought
me the bad News him&s;elf, he perceiv'd my Di&s;|order,
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> he &s;aw I was in the ut|mo&s;t
Confu&s;ion, and a kind of Amazement, and
&s;o indeed, I was, becau&s;e I was &s;o much in Debt;
But he &s;poke Chearfully to me; come, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> do
not be &s;o Di&s;courag'd, you may make up this
Lo&s;s: No, Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that never can be, for 'tis my
all, and I &s;hall never be out of Debt; well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
you have no Creditor, however, but me, and now
remember, I once told you, I would make a Man
of you, and I will not Di&s;appoint you for this
Di&s;&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>I thank'd him, and did it with more Ceremony
and Re&s;pect than ever; becau&s;e I thought my &s;elf
more under the Hatches than I was before. But
<PB N="198" REF="204">
he was as good as his Word, for he did not Baulk
me in the lea&s;t of any thing I wanted, and as I
had more Iron-work &s;av'd out of the Ship, in pro|portion,
than I wanted, I &s;upplied him with
&s;ome part of it, and took up &s;ome Linnen, and
Cloaths, and other Nece&s;&s;aries from him in Ex|change.</P>
<P>AND now I began to encrea&s;e Vi&s;ibly; I had
a large Quantity of Land Cur'd, <HI>that is,</HI> Freed
from Timber; and a very good Crop of <HI>Tobacco</HI>
in view, and I got three Servants more, and one
<HI>Negroe;</HI> &s;o that I had five white Servants, and two
<HI>Negroes,</HI> and with this my Affairs went very
well on.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Year, indeed, I took my Wages, or
Sallary, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> of 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, becau&s;e I
wanted it very much; but the &s;econd and third
Year I re&s;olv'd not to take it, on any Account
what&s;oever, but to leave it in my Benefactors
Hands, to clear off the Debt I had Contracted.</P>
<P>AND now I mu&s;t Impo&s;e a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion on
the Reader, to Note, That notwith&s;tanding all the
Di&s;advantages of a mo&s;t wretched Education, yet
Now when I began to feel my &s;elf, as I may &s;ay,
in the World; and to be arriv'd to an Independant
State, and to fore&s;ee, that I might be &s;omething
Con&s;iderable in time; I &s;ay, Now I found differing
Sentiments of things taking Place in my Mind;
and fir&s;t, I had a &s;olid Principle of Ju&s;tice and
Hone&s;ty, and a &s;ecret Horror at things pa&s;s'd,
when I look'd back upon my former Life: That
Original &s;omething, I knew not what, that u&s;ed
formerly to Check me in the fir&s;t meanne&s;&s;es of
my Youth, and us'd to Dictate to me when I was
but a Child, that I was to be a Gentleman, con|tinued
to Operate upon me Now, in a manner I
<PB N="199" REF="205">
cannot De&s;cribe; and I continually remember'd
the Words of the ancient <HI>Gla&s;s-maker,</HI> to the Gen|tleman,
that he reprov'd for Swearing, that to be
a Gentleman, was to be an <HI>Hone&s;t Man,</HI> that with|out
Hone&s;ty, Human Nature was Sunk and Dege|nerated;
the Gentleman lo&s;t all the Dig$$ty
of his Birth, and plac'd him&s;elf, even below an
Hone&s;t Beggar: The&s;e Principles growing upon
my Mind in the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances I was in,
gave me a &s;ecret Satisfaction, that I can give no
De&s;cription of; it was an inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy to me,
that I was now like to be, not only a Man, but
an Hone&s;t Man; and it yielded me a greater Plea|&s;ure,
that I was Ran&s;om'd from being a Vagabond,
a Thief, and a Criminal, as I had been from a
Child, than that I was deliver'd from Slavery,
and the wretched State of a <HI>Virginia</HI> Sold Se$vant:
I had Notion enough in my Mind, of the Hard|&s;hips
of the Servant, or Slave, becau&s;e I had felt
it, and Work'd thro' it; I remember'd it as a
State of Labour and Servitude, Hard&s;hip and
Suffering. But the other &s;hock'd my very Na|ture,
chil'd my Blood, and turn'd the very Soul
within me: The thought of it was like Re$lections
upon Hell, and the Damn'd Spirits; it &s;truck me
with Horror, it was Odious and Frightful to look
back on, and it gave me a kind of a Fit, a Con|vul&s;ion
or nervous Di&s;order, that was very unea&s;y
to me.</P>
<P>BUT to look forward, to Reflect, how things
were Chang'd; how Happy I was, that I cou'd
live by my own Endeavours, and was no more
under the Nece&s;&s;ity of being a Villain, and of
getting my Bread at my own Hazard, and the
Ruin of Hone&s;t Families; this had in it &s;omething
more than commonly plea&s;ing and agreeable, and
<PB N="200" REF="206">
in particular, it had a Plea&s;ure, that till then I
had known nothing of: It was a &s;ad thing to be
under a N$ce&s;&s;ity of doing Evil, to procure that &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance,
which I could not Support the want of,
to be oblig'd to run the venture of the Gallows,
rather than the venture of S$arving, and to be
always wick'd, for fear of want.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay that I had any &s;erious Religious
reflections, or that the&s;e things proceeded yet from
the unea&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;cience, $ut from meer Rea|&s;onings
with my&s;elf, and from being arriv'd to a
Capacity of making a right Judgement of things
more than before; yet I own I had &s;uch an ab|horrence
of the wicked Life I had led, that I
was &s;ecretly ea&s;ie, and had a kind of Plea&s;ure in
the Di&s;&s;a&s;ter that was upon me about the Ship,
and that tho' it was a lo&s;s I could not but be glad,
that tho&s;e ill gotten Goods were gone, and that I had
lo&s;t what I had &s;tolen; for I look'd on it as none
of mine, and that it would be fire in my Flax if
I &s;hould mingle it with what I had now, which
was come hone&s;tly by, and was as it were &s;ent
from Heaven, to lay the Foundation of my pro&s;|perity,
which the other would be only as a Moth
to con&s;ume.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time my Thoughts dictated to me,
that tho' this was the Foundation of my new Life,
yet that this was not the Super&s;tructure, and that
I might &s;till be born for greater things than the&s;e;
that it was Hone&s;ty, and Virtue alone that made
Men Rich and Great, and gave them a Fame, as
well as a Figure in the World, and that there|fore
I was to lay my Foundation in the&s;e, and
expect what might follow in time.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="207">
To help the&s;e Thoughts, as I had learn'd to
Read, and Write when I was in <HI>Scotland;</HI> &s;o I
began now to love Books, and particularly I had
an Opportunity of Reading &s;ome very con&s;ider|able

Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory of <HI>Speed,</HI>

dead, and his Goods &s;old, and others I borrowed.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider'd my pre&s;ent State of Life to be my

becau&s;e in my Youth, I had learn'd nothing;
and if my daily Bu&s;ine&s;s which was now great,
would have permitted, I would have been content
to have gone to School; however, Fate that had
yet &s;omething el&s;e in Store for me, threw an Op|portunity
into my Hand; namely, a cleverFellow,
that came over a tran&s;ported Felon, from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI>
and fell into my Hands for a Servant: He had led
a loo&s;e Life, that he acknowledged, and being
driven to Extremities took to the Highway, for
which, had he been taken, he would have been
Hang'd, but falling into &s;ome low priz'd Rogue|ries
afterwards for want of Opportunity for wor&s;e,
was catch'd, Condemn'd, and Tran&s;ported, and
as, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> was glad he came off &s;o.</P>
<P>HE was an excellent Schollar, and I perceiving
it, ask'd him one time, if he could give a Method how
I might learn the Latin Tongue? <HI>He &s;aid,</HI> &s;miling,
yes, he could Teach it me in three Months, if I would
let him have Books, or even without Books, if
he had time; I told him, a Book would become
his Hands better than a Hoe, and if he could pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="208">
to make me but under&s;tand Latin enough
to read it, and under&s;tand other Languages
by it, I would ea&s;e him of the Labour, which I
was now oblig'd to put him to, e&s;pecially, if I
was a&s;&s;ur'd that he was fit to receive that Favour
of a kind Ma&s;ter: In &s;hort, I made him to me,
what my Benefactor made me to him, and from
him I gain'd a Fund of Knowledge, infinitely
more valuable than the Rate of a Slave, which
was what I paid for it, but of this hereafter.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e Thoughts I went chearfully about
my Work: As I had now five Servants, my Plan|tation
went on, tho' gently, yet &s;afely, and en|creas'd
gradually; tho' &s;lowly; but the third
Year with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my old Benefactor,
I purchas'd two <HI>Negroes</HI> more, &s;o that now I had
&s;even Servants, and having cur'd Land &s;ufficient
for &s;upply of their Food, I was at no difficulty
to maintain them, &s;o that my Plantation be|gan
now to enlarge it&s;elf, and as I liv'd without
any Per&s;onal Expence, but was maintain'd at
my old Great Ma&s;ter's, <HI>as we call'd him,</HI> and at
his Charge, with 30 <HI>l.</HI> a Year be&s;ides, &s;o all my
Gain was laid up for Encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>IN this Po&s;ture I went on for 12 Year, and was
very &s;ucce&s;sful in my Plantation, and had got|ten
by means of my Ma&s;ter's favour, who now
I call'd my Friend, a Corre&s;pondent in <HI>London,</HI>
with whom I Traded, Shipp'd over my Tobacco,
to him, and receiv'd <HI>European</HI> Goods in returns
&s;uch as I wanted, to carry on my Plantation, and
&s;ufficient to &s;ell to others al&s;o.</P>
<P>IN this interval, my good Friend and Bene|factor
died, and I was left very di&s;con&s;olate, on ac|count
of my Lo&s;s, for it was indeed a great Lo&s;s to
me; he had been a Father to me, and I was like a
for&s;aken Stranger without him, tho' I knew the
<PB N="203" REF="209">
Country, and the Trade too well enough, and
had for &s;ometime chiefly carried on his whole
Bu&s;ine&s;s for him, yet I &s;eem'd now at a lo&s;s; my
Councellor, and my chief Supporter was gone,
and I had no Confident to communicate my&s;elf
to, on all Occa&s;ions, as formerly; but there was
no Remedy, I was however in a better Conditi|on
to &s;tand alone than ever; I had a very large
Plantation, and had near 70 <HI>Negroes,</HI> and other
Servants: In a Word, I was grown really Rich,
con&s;idering my fir&s;t Circum&s;tances that began,
<HI>as I may &s;ay,</HI> with nothing: <HI>That is to &s;ay,</HI> I had
nothing of Stock, but I had a great Beginning,
for I had &s;uch a Man's Friend&s;hip, and Support
in my Beginning, that indeed, I needed no other
Stock, and if I had had 500<HI>l.</HI> to have begun with,
and not the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Advice, and Counte|nance
of &s;uch a Man, I had not been in a better
Condition; but he promis'd to make a Man of
me, and &s;o he did, and in one Re&s;pect, <HI>I may &s;ay,</HI>
I merited it of him, for I brought his Plantation
into &s;uch order, and the Government of his <HI>Ne|groes,</HI>
into &s;uch a Regulation, that if he had given
500<HI>l.</HI> to have had it done, he would have thought
his Money well be&s;tow'd; his Work was always
in order going forward to his Mind; every thing
was in a thriving Po&s;ture; his Servants all lov'd
him, even <HI>Negroes</HI> and all, and yet there was no
&s;uch thing, as a cruel Puni&s;hment, or Severities
known among them.</P>
<P>IN my own Plantation it was the &s;ame thing,
I wrought &s;o upon the Rea&s;on, and the Affections
of my <HI>Negroes,</HI> that they &s;erv'd me chearfully,
and by Con&s;equence, Faithfully, and Diligently;
when in my Neighbour's Plantation, there was
not a Week hardly pa&s;s'd without &s;uch horrible
<PB N="204" REF="210">
Out-cryes, Roarings and Yellings of the Servants,
either under Torture, or in Fear of it, that their
<HI>Negroes</HI> would in Di&s;cour&s;e with ours, wi&s;h them|&s;elves
dead, and gone, (as it &s;eems they believ'd
they &s;hould after Death) into their own Country.</P>
<P>IF I met with a &s;ullen &s;tupid Fellow, at &s;ome|times
it was unavoidable, I always parted with
him, and &s;old him off; for I would not keep any,
that Sen&s;e of kind U&s;age would not oblige; but
I &s;eldom met with &s;uch bad ones, for by talking to
them in a plain Rea&s;oning way, I found the
Temper of the Roughe&s;t of them, would break
and &s;often; the Sen&s;e of their own Intere&s;t would
prevail with them fir&s;t, or la&s;t; and if it had
not, the contrary Temper was &s;o general among
my People, that their own Fellows and Country|men
would be again&s;t them, and that &s;erv'd to
bring them to Rea&s;on, as &s;oon as any other thing;
and this, tho&s;e who think it worth their while,
will ea&s;ily find, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that having prevail'd Ef|fectually
over one leading Man among them to
be tractable, and pleas'd, and grateful, he &s;hall
make them all like him, and that in a little
while, with more ea&s;e than can be imagin'd.</P>
<P>I WAS now a Planter, and al&s;o a Student; my
Pedagogue I mention'd above, was very diligent,
and prov'd an extraordinary Man indeed, he
Taught me not only with Application, but with
admirable Judgement in the Teaching part, for
I have &s;een it in many In&s;tances &s;ince that time,
that every good Schollar is not fitted for a School|ma&s;ter,
and that the Art of Teaching is quite
different from that of Knowing the Language
Taught.</P>
<P>BUT this Man had both, and prov'd of great
U&s;e to me, and I &s;ound Rea&s;on in the worth of
<PB N="205" REF="211">
the Per&s;on to be very kind to him, his Circum|&s;tances
con&s;ider'd: I once took the liberty to ask
him how it came to pa&s;s, that he who mu&s;t have had
a liberal Education, and great Advantages to have
advanc'd him&s;elf in the World, &s;hould be capable
of falling into &s;uch mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances as he
was in, when he came over? I us'd &s;ome Caution
in entring upon an enquiry, which, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI>
might not be plea&s;ant to him to relate, but that
I would make him amends, by telling him, that
if he de&s;ir'd not to enter into it with me, I would
readily excu&s;e him, and would not take it ill at
all; this I did, becau&s;e to a Man under &s;uch Af|flictions,
one &s;hould always be Tender, and
not put them upon relating any thing of them|&s;elves,
which was grievous to them, or which
they had rather was conceal'd.</P>
<P>BUT he told me, that it was true, that to look
back upon his pa&s;t Life, was indeed <HI>renovare do|lorem;</HI>
but that &s;uch Mortifications were now u&s;e|ful
to him, to help forward that Repentance
which he hop'd he was &s;incerely entered upon;
and that tho' it was with horror he look'd back
upon mi&s;pent Time, and ill applied Gifts, which
a bountiful Creator had ble&s;s'd him with, and
&s;par'd to him for a better Improvement, yet he
thought he ought to load him&s;elf with as much of
the &s;hame, as it pleas'd God to make his Lot, &s;ince
he had already loaded him&s;elf with the Guilt in a
&s;hamele&s;s manner; till God (he &s;till hop'd in Mer|cy
to him) had cut him &s;hort, and brought him
to publick Di&s;grace, tho' he could not &s;ay he
had been brought to Ju&s;tice, for then he had been
&s;ent into Eternity in de&s;pair, and not been &s;ent
to <HI>Virginia,</HI> to repent of the wickede&s;t Life that
ever Man liv'd:&mdash;He would have gone on,
<PB N="206" REF="212">
but, I found his Speech interrupted by a pa$&s;io|nate
&s;truggle within, between his Grief and his
Tears.</P>
<P>I took no more Notice of it, than to tell him,
that I was &s;orry I had ask'd him about it, but
that it was my Curio&s;ity; when I &s;aw that igno|rant,
untaught, untractable Creatures come into
Mi&s;ery and Shame, I made no enquiry after their
Affairs, but when I &s;aw Men of Parts and Learn|ing
take &s;uch Steps, I concluded it mu&s;t be oc|ca&s;ion'd
by &s;omething exceeding wicked; &s;o in|deed,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Judge &s;aid to me when I beg'd
Mercy of him in Latin, he told me that when a
Man furni&s;h'd with &s;uch Learning falls into &s;uch
Crimes, he is more inexcu&s;able than other Men;
becau&s;e his Learning recommending him, he could
not want Advantages, and had the le&s;s temptation
to Crime.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I believe my Ca&s;e was what
I find is the Ca&s;e of mo&s;t of the wicked Part of
the World (<HI>viz.</HI>) that to be reduc'd to Nece&s;&s;ity
is to be wicked; for Nece&s;&s;ity is not only the
Temptation, but is &s;uch a Temptation as human
Nature is not empower'd to re&s;i&s;t: How good then,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> is that God, which takes from you Sir, the
Temptation, by taking away the Nece&s;&s;ity?</P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Truth of what he &s;aid,
<HI>knowing it by my own Ca&s;e,</HI> that I could not enter
any farther upon the Di&s;cour&s;e; but he went
on voluntarily: <HI>This Sir,</HI> &s;ays he, I am &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble
of, that I think the Ca&s;e I am now reduc'd to,
much le&s;s mi&s;erable than the Life which I liv'd
before, becau&s;e I am deliver'd from the horrid
Nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;uch ill things, which was my
Ruin, and Di&s;&s;a&s;ter then, even for my Bread,
and am not now oblig'd to ravi&s;h my Bread out
<PB N="207" REF="213">
of the Mouths of others by Violence and Di&s;or|der;
but am fed tho' I am made to Earn it by the
hard Labour of my Hands, and I thank God for
the Difference. He paws'd here but went on thus,</P>
<P>How much is the Life of a Slave in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to
be preferr'd to that of the mo&s;t pro&s;perous Thief
in the World! here I live mi&s;erable, but hone&s;t;
&s;uffer wrong, but do no wrong; my Body is pu|ni&s;h'd,
but my Con&s;cience is not loaded; and as
I us'd to &s;ay, that I had no Lei&s;ure to look in,
but I would begin when I had &s;ome Rece&s;s, &s;ome|time
to &s;pare; now God has found me lei&s;ure to
Repent; he run on in this manner a great while,
giving Thanks, I believe mo&s;t heartily, for his
being deliver'd from the wretch'd Life he had
liv'd, tho' his Mi&s;ery were to be ten Fold, as
much as it was.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;incerely Touch'd with his Di&s;cour&s;e
on this Subject, I had known &s;o much of the
real difference of the Ca&s;e, that I could not but
be affected with it, tho' till now I confe&s;s I knew
little of the religious Part: I had been an Offen|der
as well as he, tho' not altogether in the &s;ame
Degree, but I knew nothing of the Penitence;
neither had I look'd back upon any thing, as a
Crime; but as a Life di&s;honourable, and not
like a Gentleman, which run much in my
Thoughts, as I have &s;everal times mention'd.</P>
<P>WELL, but now, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you talk Penitently,
and I hope you are &s;incere, but what would be
your Ca&s;e, if you were deliver'd from the mi&s;e|rable
Condition of a Slave &s;old for Money, which
you are now in? &s;hould you not, think you, be
the &s;ame Man?</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="214">
BLESSED be God, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that if I thought I
&s;hould, I would &s;incerely pray that I might not
be Deliver'd, and that I might for ever be a Slave
rather than a Sinner.</P>
<P>WELL, but <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e you to be under the
&s;ame nece&s;&s;ity, in the &s;ame &s;tarving Condition,
Should you not take the &s;ame Cour&s;e?</P>
<P>HE replied very &s;harply, that &s;hows us the
need we have of the Petition in the Lord's Pray|er:
<HI>Lead us not into Temptation;</HI> and of <HI>Solomon's</HI>
or <HI>Agar's</HI> Prayer: <HI>Give me not Poverty, lea&s;t I
Steal.</HI> I &s;hould ever beg of God not to be left
to &s;uch Snares as Human Nature cannot re&s;i&s;t.
But I have &s;ome hope that I &s;hould venture to
Starve, rather than to Steal; but I al&s;o beg to be
deliver'd from the Danger, becau&s;e I know not
my own Strength.</P>
<P>THIS was hone&s;tly &s;poken, indeed; and there
really were &s;uch vi&s;ible Tokens of Sincerity in all
his Di&s;cour&s;e, that I could not &s;u&s;pect him: On
&s;ome of our Di&s;cour&s;es on this Subject, he pull'd
out a little Dirty Paper Book, in which he had
wrote down &s;uch a Prayer in Ver&s;e, as I doubt
few Chri&s;tians in the World could Sub&s;cribe to;
and I cannot but Record it, becau&s;e I never &s;aw any
thing like it in my Life, the Lines are as follows:
<Q><L>Lord! what&s;oever Sorrows Rack my Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Till Crime removes too, let me find no Re&s;t;</L>
<L>How Dark &s;o e'er, my State, or &s;harp my Pain,</L>
<L>O: let not Troubles Cea&s;e, and Sin Remain.</L></Q>
<Q><L>For Je&s;us &s;ake, remove not my Di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>Till free Triumphant Grace &s;hall Repo&s;e&s;s</L>
<L>The Vacant Throne, from whence my Sins Depart,</L>
<L>And make a willing Captive of my Heart;</L>
<L>Till Grace Compleatly &s;hall my Soul Subdue,</L>
<L>Thy Conque&s;t-full, and my Subjection True.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="215">
THERE were more Lines on the &s;ame Subject,
but the&s;e were the beginning; and the&s;e touching
me &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, I have remember'd them di&s;tinct|ly
ever &s;ince, and have I believe repeated them
to my &s;elf a Thou&s;and times.</P>
<P>I pre&s;s'd him no more you may be &s;ure, after
an an&s;wer &s;o very particular, and affecting as
this was; it was ea&s;y to &s;ee the Man was a &s;in|cere
Penitent, not &s;orrowing for the Puni&s;hment
he was &s;uffering under; for his Condition was no
part of his Affection, he was rather thankful for
it, as above; but his Concern was a feeling and
affecting Sence of the Wicked and Abominable
Life he had led, the abhorr'd Crimes he had Com|mitted,
both again&s;t God and Man, and the little
Sence he had had of the Condition he was in, that
even till he came to the Place where he now was.</P>
<P>I ask'd him if he had no Reflections of this kind,
after, or before his Sentence, he told me, <HI>Newgate,
for the Pri&s;on at</HI> Bri&s;tol <HI>is call'd, &s;o it &s;eems, as well
as that at</HI> London, was a place that &s;eldom made
Penitents, but often made Villains wor&s;e, till they
learn'd to defie God and Devil. But, that how|ever,
he cou'd look back with this Satisfaction;
that he could &s;ay, he was not altogether in&s;en&s;i|ble
of it, even then; but nothing that amounted
to a thorough Serious looking up to Heaven: That
he often indeed look'd in, and reflected upon his
pa&s;t mi&s;pent Life, even before he was in Pri|&s;on,
when the Intervals of his wicked Pra|cti&s;es
gave &s;ome time for Reflection, and he would
&s;ometimes &s;ay to him&s;elf, Whether am I going?
To what, will all the&s;e things bring me at la&s;t?
And where will they End? Sin and Shame follow
one another, and I &s;hall certainly come to the
Gallows; <HI>then &s;aid he,</HI> I wou'd &s;trike upon my
<PB N="210" REF="216">
Brea&s;t, and &s;ay: O wicked Wretch, when wilt
thou Repent! And would an&s;wer my &s;elf as of|ten;
Never! Never! Never! Except it be in a
Goal, or at a Gib$et.</P>
<P>THEN <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I would Weep, and Sigh, and look
back a little upon my wretched Life, the Hi|&s;tory
of which would make the World amaz'd;
but Alas! the pro&s;pect was &s;o Dark, and it fill'd
me with &s;o much Terror, that I cou'd not bear it;
then, I would fly to Wine and Company for re|lief,
that Wine brought on Exce&s;s, and that Com|pany
being always wicked Company like my &s;elf,
brought on Temptation; and then all Reflection
Vani&s;h'd, and I was the &s;ame Devil as before.</P>
<P>HE &s;poke this with &s;o much Affection, that
his Face was ever &s;miling, when he talk'd of
it, and yet his Eyes had Tears &s;tanding in
them, at the &s;ame time, and all the time; for he
had a delightful Sorrow, if that be a proper Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
in &s;peaking of it.</P>
<P>THIS was a &s;trange Relation to me, and began
to affect me after a manner that I did not un|der&s;tand;
I lov'd to hear him talk of it, and yet it
always left a kind of a Dead Lump behind it
upon my Heart, which I cou'd give no Rea&s;on for,
nor imagine to what it &s;hould tend; I had a hea|vine&s;s
on my Soul without being able to de&s;cribe$
it, or to &s;ay, what ailed me.</P>
<P>WELL, he went on with his Relation, after
this, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I fell into the Hands of Ju&s;tice for
a Triffle, a peice of Sport in our Crime; and I,
that for a hundred Robberies, as well on the
Highway, as otherwi&s;e, the particulars of which
would fill a Book to give an Account of, ought,
whenever I was taken to be Hang'd in Chams,
and who, if it had been Publick, could not have
<PB N="211" REF="217">
fail'd of having Twenty People come in again&s;t
me, was privately Hurried into a Country Goal,
under a wrong Name; try'd for a &s;mall Fact
within Benefit of Clergy, and in which I was not
principally Guilty, and by this means obtained
the favour of being Tran&s;ported.</P>
<P>AND what think you, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> has mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly
affected me, and brought on the ble&s;&s;ed Change
that I hope I may &s;ay, God has wrought in my
Soul: Not the Greatne&s;s of my Crimes, but the
Wonders of that merciful Providence, which when
it has Mercy in &s;tore for a Man, often brings him
into the Briars, into Sorrow and Mi&s;ery for le&s;&s;er
Sins; that Men may be led to &s;ee how they are &s;par'd
from the Puni&s;hment due to them, for the great|er
Guilt which they know lies upon them; do you
think that when I receiv'd the Grant of Tran&s;por|tation,
I cou'd be in&s;en&s;ible what a Miracle of
Divine Goodne&s;s &s;uch a thing mu&s;t be, to one
who had &s;o many ways de&s;erv'd to be Hang'd,
and mu&s;t infallibly have Died, if my true Name
had been known, or if the lea&s;t Notice had been
given, that it was &s;uch a Notorious Wretch as I,
that was in Cu&s;tody? There began the fir&s;t Mo|tive
of Repentance, for certainly the Goodne&s;s of
our Great Creator in &s;paring us, when we forfeit
our Lives to his Ju&s;tice, and his Merciful bring|ing
us out of the Mi&s;eries which we Plunge
our&s;elves into, when we have no way to Extri|cate
our&s;elves, his bringing tho&s;e very Mi&s;eries
to be the means of our Deliverance, and working
Good to us out of Evil, when we are working the
very Evil out of his Good: I &s;ay, the&s;e things are
certainly the &s;tronge&s;t Motives to Repentance
that are in the World; and the &s;paring Theives
<PB N="212" REF="218">
from the Gallows, certainly makes more Peni|tents
than the Gallows it &s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is true, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> that the Terror of Pu|ni&s;hment
works &s;trongly upon the Mind: In
view of Death, Men are fill'd with Horror of
Soul, and immediately they call that Repentance
which I doubt is too often mi&s;taken; being only
a kind of Angui&s;h in the Soul, which breeds a
Grief for the Puni&s;hment that is to be &s;uffer'd;
an Amazement founded upon the dreadful View
of what is to follow: But the Sen&s;e of Mercy
is quite another thing, this Seizes all the Pa&s;&s;i|ons,
and all the Affections, and Works a &s;incere
Unfeigned Abhorrence of the Crime, as a Crime;
as an Offence again&s;t our Benefactor, as an Act
of Ba&s;ene&s;s and Ingratitude to him, who has gi|ven
us Life, and all the Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts
of Life; and who has Conquer'd us by continu|ing
to do us good, when he has been Provok'd to
de&s;troy us.</P>
<P>THIS, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> has been the Fountain of
that Repentance, which I &s;o much Rejoyce in:
This is the delightful Sorrow, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that I &s;poke
of ju&s;t now; and this makes Smiles &s;it on my
Face, while Tears run from my Eyes; a Joy that
I can no otherwi&s;e Expre&s;s, than by telling you,
Sir, that I never liv'd a happy Day &s;ince I came
to an Age of acting in the World, till I Landed
in this Country, and work'd in your Plantation:
Naked and Hungry, Weary and Faint, op|pre&s;s'd
with Cold in one Sea&s;on, and Heat in the
other; then I began to &s;ee into my own ways,
and &s;ee the Difference between the Hard&s;hips of
the Body, and the Torment of the Mind: Before
I Revell'd in fulne&s;s, and here, I &s;truggl'd with
hard fare; then I wallow'd in Sloth and Volup|tuous
<PB N="213" REF="219">
Ea&s;e; here, I labour'd till Nature &s;ometimes
was ju&s;t &s;inking under the Load; but with this
Difference in the Felicity of either Ca&s;e; Namely,
that there I had a Hell in my Soul, was fill'd with
Horror and Confu&s;ion, was a daily Terror to my
&s;elf, and always expected a mi&s;erable End;
Whereas here, I had a ble&s;s'd Calm of Soul, an
Emblem, and fore-runner of Heaven: Thankful
and Humble, adoring that Mercy that had &s;natch'd
me out of the Jaws of the Devil; the&s;e took up
my Thoughts, and made my mo&s;t weary Hours
Plea&s;ant to me, my Labour light, and my Heart
Chearful; I never lay down on my hard Lodging,
but I prais'd God with the greate&s;t Exce&s;s of
Affection, not only, that it was not the <HI>Condemn'd-Hole;</HI>
and that I was delivered from the Death I
had de&s;erv'd; But that it was not <HI>Shooters hill,</HI>
that I was not &s;till a Robber, a Terror to Ju&s;t and
hone&s;t Men; a Plunderer of the Innocent, and the
Poor; a Thief, and a Villain, that ought to be
Rooted out from the Earth, for the Safety of o|thers;
But that I was deliver'd from the horrid
Temptation of Sinning, to Support my Luxury,
and making one Vice Nece&s;&s;ary to another; and
this I bear Witne&s;s, is &s;ufficient to Sweeten the
bittere&s;t Sorrow, and make any Man be thankful
for <HI>Virginia,</HI> or a wor&s;e Place, if that can be.</P>
<P>HE then entertain'd me with an Opinion of his,
that if it were po&s;&s;ible for the Face of Heaven and
Hell to be Di&s;clos'd and laid open, and that Men
could be made capable of &s;eeing di&s;tinctly, and
&s;eparately, the Joys and Glory, and utmo&s;t Fe|licity
of One, and the Horrors of the Other;
and to make a Judgment of both, according to
the Power of human Rea&s;oning, the fir&s;t would
have a &s;tronger and more powerful Effect to Re|from
<PB N="214" REF="220">
the World, than the latter: But this we
had farther about Di&s;cour&s;es on many Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be enquir'd, how I was capable of
hearing all this, and having no Impre&s;&s;ions made
upon my Mind by it, e&s;pecially, when it &s;o ma|ny
ways &s;uited my own Ca&s;e, and the Conditi|on
of the former part of my Life; I &s;hall an&s;wer
that pre&s;ently by it &s;elf: However, I took no
notice of it to him, for he had quite other Noti|ons
of me, than I had of my &s;elf; nor did I, as is
u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es, enter into any Confidence
with him on my <HI>own</HI> Story, only that I took &s;ome|times
the Occa&s;ion to let him know, that I did
not come over to <HI>Virginia</HI> in the Capacity of a
Criminal, or that I was not Tran&s;ported; which
con&s;idering how many of the Inhabitants there
were &s;o, who then liv'd in good Circum&s;tances,
was needful enough to be done.</P>
<P>BUT as to my &s;elf it was enough, that I was
in Condition now, 'twas no matter to any Body,
what I had been, and as it was grown pretty
much out of Memory, from what original
di&s;&s;a&s;ter, I came into the Country, or that I was
ever a Servant, otherwi&s;e than Voluntary, and that
it was no Bu&s;ine&s;s of mine to expo&s;e my&s;elf; &s;o I
kept that Part clo&s;e; but for all that, it was im|po&s;&s;ible
for me to conceal the Di&s;order I was in,
as often as he talk'd of the&s;e things; I had hi|therto
gone on upon a Notion of things founded
only in their appearance, as they affected me with
Good, or Evil; e&s;teeming, the happy and unhap|py
Part of Life to be tho&s;e that gave me Ea&s;e,
or Sorrow, without regarding, or indeed much un|der&s;tanding
how far tho&s;e Turns of Life were
influenced by the giver of Life; or how far they
were all directed by a Sovereign God, that Go|verns
<PB N="215" REF="221">
the World, and all the Creatures it had
made.</P>
<P>As I had no Education but as you have heard,
&s;o I had had no In&s;truction, no Knowledge of
Religion, or indeed of the meaning of it; and
tho' I was now in a kind of &s;earch after Religi|on,
it was a meer looking, <HI>as it were,</HI> into the
World to &s;ee what kind of a thing, or Place it
was, and what had been done in it; but as to
him that made it, there had truly been &s;carce
a Creature among all he had made, with Souls in
them, that were &s;o intirely without the know|ledge
of God as I was, and made &s;o little en|quiry
about it.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;erious affectionate Di&s;cour&s;e of this
young Man, began to have different Effects
upon me; and I began to &s;ay to my&s;elf, this
Man's reflections are certainly very ju&s;t, but what
a Creature am I, and what have I been doing?
I that never once did this in all my Life! that ne|ver
&s;aid &s;o much, <HI>God, I thank thee</HI> for all that
I have been &s;av'd from, or all that I have
been brought to in this World; and yet my Life
has been as full of Variety, and I have been as
miraculou&s;ly deliver'd from Dangers and Mi&s;|chiefs,
and as many of them, as ever he has; and
if it has all been brought to pa&s;s by an invi&s;ible
Hand in Mercy to me, what have I been doing,
and where have I liv'd? that I only &s;hould be
the mo&s;t Thoughtle&s;s, and Unthankful of all
God's Creatures!</P>
<P>THIS indeed began to grow upon me, and
made me very melancholly; but as to Religion, I
under&s;tood &s;o little about it, that if I had re|&s;olv'd
upon any &s;uch thing, as a new Cour&s;e of
<PB N="216" REF="222">
Life, or to &s;et about a religious Change, I knew
not at which End to begin, or what to do about it.</P>
<P>ONE Day it happen'd, that my Tutor, for &s;o
I always call'd him, had the Bible in his Hand,
and was looking in it, as he generally did many
times every Day, tho' I knew not for what, &s;eeing
the Bible, I took it out of his Hands, and went
to look in it; which I had done &s;o little before, that
I think I might &s;afely &s;ay, I had never read a
Chapter in it, in all my Life; he was talking of
the Bible then, as a Book only; as where he had it,
and how he brought it to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and in &s;ome exta|&s;ie,
he took it, and ki&s;s'd: This ble&s;&s;ed Book! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI>
this was all the Trea&s;ure I brought out of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
with me, and a comfortable Trea&s;ure, it
has been to me, <HI>added he,</HI> I would not have been
without it in my Sorrows, for any other Trea|&s;ure
in the World, and &s;o he went on at Large.</P>
<P>I THAT had no Notion of what he meant, only,
<HI>as I have &s;aid above,</HI> &s;ome Young Infant Thoughts,
about the Works of Providence in the World,
and its merciful Dealings with me, took the Book
out of his Hand, and went to look into it, and
the Book open'd at the <HI>Acts</HI> 26. v. 28. where <HI>Falix</HI>
&s;ays to <HI>St.</HI> Paul, <HI>almo&s;t thou per&s;wade&s;t me to be a
Chri&s;tian.</HI> I think, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> here's a Line hits me to
a Tittle, upon the long Account, you have given
of your&s;elf, and I mu&s;t &s;ay them to you, as the
Governor here &s;aid; and &s;o I read the Words to
him. He blu&s;h'd at the Text, and returns, I wi&s;h
I could an&s;wer you in the very Words the Apo&s;tle
return'd to him in the next Ver. <HI>I would thou wert
both almo&s;t, and altogether &s;uch as I am, except
the&s;e Bonds.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS now more than Thirty Year old, by my
own Account, and as well as it was po&s;&s;ible for me
<PB N="217" REF="223">
to keep a reckoning of my Age, who had no Body
left, that ever knew my beginning? I was, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI>
above 30 Year old, and had gone thro &s;ome Va|riety
in the World; but as I was perfectly aban|doned
in my Infancy, and utterly without In|&s;truction
in my Youth; &s;o I was int$rely ig|norant
of every thing that was worthy the
name of Religion in the World; and this was the
fir&s;t time that ever any Notion of Religious
Things entered into my Heart; but I was &s;$r|priz'd
at this Man's talk, and that &s;everal ways;
particularly, he talk'd &s;o feelingly of his pa&s;s'd
Circum&s;tances, and they were &s;o like my own,
that every time he made a religious Inference
from his own Condition, and argued from one
Condition of his to another; it &s;truck into my
Thoughts like a Bullet from a Gun, that I had cer|tainly
as much to be thankful for, and to repent
of, as he had, except only that I had no know|ledge
of better things to be thankful for, which
he had; but in return for that, I was deliver'd,
and &s;et up in the World, made a Ma&s;ter, and ea&s;y,
and was in good Circum&s;tances, being rais'd from
the very &s;ame low di&s;tre&s;s'd Condition as he was
in, I mean a &s;old Servant; but that he remain'd
&s;o &s;till, &s;o that if his Sin had been greater than
mine, &s;o his Di&s;tre&s;s'd was &s;till greater.</P>
<P>THIS Article of Gratitude &s;truck deep, and
lay heavy upon my Mind; I remembered that I
was Grateful to the la&s;t degree to my old Ma&s;ter,
who had rais'd me from my low Condition, and
that I lov'd the very name of him, or as might
be &s;aid, the very Ground he trod on; but I had
not &s;o much as once thought of any higher obli|gation;
no, nor, &s;o much as like the Phari&s;ee
had &s;aid, one <HI>God I thank thee,</HI> to him, for all the
<PB N="218" REF="224">
influence which his Providence mu&s;t have had in
my whole Affair.</P>
<P>IT occurr'd to me pre&s;ently, that if none of
all the&s;e things befall us without the direction of
a divine Power, as my new In&s;tructor had told me
at large; and that God had order'd every thing, the
mo&s;t Minute, and lea&s;t Tran&s;action of Life, in|&s;omuch,
<HI>That not a Hair of our Heads &s;hall fall to
the Ground without his Permi&s;&s;ion;</HI> I &s;ay, it occurr'd
to me, that I had been a mo&s;t unthankful Dog to
that Providence, that had done &s;o much for me;
and the Con&s;equence of the Reflection was im|mediately
this; how ju&s;tly may that Power, &s;o
di&s;oblig'd, take away again his Wooll, and his
Flax, with which I am now clothed, and re|duce
me to the mi&s;ery of my fir&s;t Circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>THIS perplex'd me much, and I was very pen|&s;ive,
and &s;ad, in which however, my new In&s;tructor
was a con&s;tant Comforter to me, and I learn'd
every day &s;omething or other from him, upon
which I told him one Morning, that I thought
he mu&s;t leave off teaching me Latin, and Teach
me Religion.</P>
<P>HE &s;poke with a great deal of Mode&s;ty of his
being uncapable of Informing me of any thing
that I did not know, and propos'd to me to read
the Scriptures every Day, as the &s;ure and only
Fund of In&s;truction: I an&s;wer'd; that in the
Words of the <HI>Enuch</HI> to St. <HI>Philip,</HI> when the Apo|&s;tle
ask'd him, if he under&s;tood what he read?
<HI>How can I, unle&s;s &s;ome one Guide me?</HI></P>
<P>WE talk'd frequently upon this Subject, and I
found &s;o much Rea&s;on to believe he was a Sincere
Convert, that I can &s;peak of him as no other, in
all I have to &s;ay of him: However, I cannot &s;ay
<PB N="219" REF="225">
my Thoughts were yet Ripen'd, for an Oppera|tion
of that kind; I had &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s about
my pa&s;t Life, and I liv'd now, and had done &s;o
before I knew him, a very regular Sober Life, al|ways
taken up in my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and running into
no Exce&s;&s;es; but as to commencing Penitent, as
this Man had done, I cannot &s;ay, I had any Con|victions
upon me, &s;ufficient to bring it on, nor
had I a Fund of religious Knowledge to &s;upport
me in it; &s;o it wore off again Gradually, as &s;uch
things generally do, where the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions
are not deep enough.</P>
<P>IN the mean time as he Read over long Lectures
of his own Di&s;a&s;ters to me, and applied them all
&s;eriou&s;ly to me, &s;o our Di&s;cour&s;e was always ve|ry
Solid and Weighty, and we had nothing of Le|vity
between us, even when we were not con|cern'd
in religious Di&s;cour&s;es: He read Hi&s;tory
to me, and where Books were wanting, he gave
me Ideas of tho&s;e things which had not been Re|corded
by our modern Hi&s;tories, or at lea&s;t, that
our Number of Books would not reach; by the&s;e
things he rais'd an unquenchable Thir&s;t in me,
after &s;eeing &s;omething that was doing in the
World, and the more becau&s;e all the World was
at that time engag'd more or le&s;s, in the great
War wherein the <HI>French</HI> King might be &s;aid to
be engag'd with, and again&s;t all the Powers of
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Now, I look'd upon my &s;elf as one Buried a|live,
in a remote Part of the World, where I
could &s;ee nothing at all, and hear but a little of
what was &s;een, and that little, not till at lea&s;t
half a Year after it was done, and &s;ometimes a
Year or more; and in a Word, the old Reproach
<PB N="220" REF="226">
often came in my way; Namely, that even this
was not yet, the Life of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>IT was true, that this was much nearer to it,
than that of a Pick-pocket, and &s;till nearer than
that of a &s;old Slave: But in &s;hort, this would not
do, and I cou'd receive no Satisfaction in it; I
had now a &s;econd Plantation, a very con&s;iderable
one, and it went forward very well; I had on it
almo&s;t 100 Servants already, of &s;undry Sorts,
and an Over&s;eer, that I had a great deal of Rea|&s;on
to &s;ay, I might depend upon, and but that,
I had a third in Embrio, and newly begun, I
had nothing to hinder me from going where I
pleas'd.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I now began to Frame my
Thoughts for a Voyage to <HI>England;</HI> re&s;olving
then to Act as I &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e, but with a &s;e|cret
Re&s;olution, to &s;ee more of the World, if
po&s;&s;ible, and reallize tho&s;e things to my Mind,
which I had hitherto only entertain'd remote
Ideas of, by the helps of Books.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, I pu&s;h'd forward the Settle|ment
of my third Plantation, in order to bring
it to be in a Po&s;ture, to be either let to a Tennant,
or left in Tru&s;t with an Over&s;eer, as I &s;hould
find occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>HAD I re&s;olved to leave it to an Over&s;eer, or
Steward, no Man in the World could have been
fit for it, like my Tutor; but I could not think of
parting with him, who was the Cau&s;e of my de|&s;ire
of Travelling, and who I concluded to make
my Partner in my Travels.</P>
<P>IT was three Year after this, before I could
get things in order, fit for my leaving the Coun|try;
in this time I deliver'd my Tutor from his
Bondage, and would have given him his Liberty,
<PB N="221" REF="227">
but to my great di&s;appointment I found that I could
not empower him to go for <HI>England,</HI> till his time
was expir'd, according to the Certificate of his
Tran&s;portation; which was Regi&s;ter'd, &s;o I made
him one of my Over&s;eers, and thereby rais'd him
gradually to a Pro&s;pect of living in the &s;ame man|ner,
and by the like &s;teps that my good
Benefactor rais'd me; only, that I did not
a&s;&s;i&s;t him to enter upon Planting for him&s;elf as
I was a&s;&s;i&s;ted, neither was I upon the Spot to do
it; but his Man's Diligence and hone&s;t Applica|tion,
even una&s;&s;i&s;ted deliver'd him&s;elf, any far|ther
than, as <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> by making him an Over&s;eer,
which was only a pre&s;ent Ea&s;e and Deliverance
to him from the hard Labour, and Fare, which
he endured as a Servant.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in this Tru&s;t, he behav'd &s;o faithful|ly,
and &s;o diligently, that it recommended him in
the Country; and when I came back, I found him
in Circum&s;tances very differing from what I left
him in, be&s;ides his being my principal Mannager
for near twenty Years, as you &s;hall hear in its
Place.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things the more at large, that if
any unhappy Wretch, who may have the Di&s;a&s;ter
to fall into &s;uch Circum&s;tances as the&s;e, may come
to &s;ee this Account, they may learn the follow|ing
&s;hort Le&s;&s;ons from the&s;e Examples.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT <HI>Virginia,</HI> and a State of Tran&s;portati|on,
may be the happie&s;t Place and Condition
they were ever in, for this Life, as by a
&s;incere Repentance, and a diligent Applica|tion
to the Bu&s;ine&s;s they are put to; they
are effectually deliver'd from a Life of a
<PB N="222" REF="228">
flagrant Wickedne&s;s, and put in a perfectly
new Condition, in which they have no
Temptation to the Crimes they formerly
committed, and have a pro&s;pect of Advan|tage
for the future.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT in <HI>Virginia,</HI> the meane&s;t, and mo&s;t
de&s;picable Creature after his time of Ser|vitude
is expir'd, if he will but apply him|&s;elf
with Diligence and Indu&s;try to the Bu|&s;ine&s;s
of the Country, is &s;ure (Life and Health
&s;uppos'd) both of living Well and growing
Rich.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>AS this is a foundation, which the mo&s;t un|fortunate
Wretch alive is entitul'd to; a Tran&s;|ported
Felon, is in my Opinion a much happier
Man, than the mo&s;t pro&s;perous untaken Thief in
the Nation; nor are tho&s;e poor young People &s;o
much in the wrong, as &s;ome imagine them to be,
that go voluntarily over to tho&s;e Countries, and
in order to get them&s;elves carried over, and
plac'd there, freely bind them&s;elves, there; e&s;pe|cially
if the Per&s;ons into who&s;e Hands they fall,
do any thing hone&s;tly by them; for as it is to
be &s;uppos'd that tho&s;e poor People knew not
what Cour&s;e to take before, or had mi&s;carried in
their Conduct before; here they are &s;ure to be
immediately provided for, and after the expira|tion
of their time, to be put into a Condition to
provide for them&s;elves; but I return to my own
Story, which now begins a new Scene.</P>
<P>I WAS now making Provi&s;ion for my going
to <HI>England,</HI> after having &s;ettled my Planta|tion
in &s;uch Hands, as was fully to my &s;atisfacti|on;
my fir&s;t Work was to furni&s;h my&s;elf with
<PB N="223" REF="229">
&s;uch a Stock of Goods, and Money, as might be
&s;ufficient for my occa&s;ions Abroad, and particu|larly
might allow to make large Returns to <HI>Mary|land,</HI>
for the U&s;e and Supply of all my Planta|tions;
but when I came to look nearer into the
Voyage, it occurr'd to me, that it would not be
prudent to put my Cargo all on Aboard the &s;ame
Ship that I went in; &s;o I Shipp'd at &s;everal
times five Hundred Hog&s;heads of Tobbacco in
&s;everal Ships for <HI>England,</HI> giving Notice to my
Corre&s;pondent in <HI>London,</HI> that I would Embark
about &s;uch a time to come over my&s;elf, and or|dering
him to En&s;ure for a con&s;iderable Sum, pro|portion'd
to the value of my Cargo.</P>
<P>ABOUT two Months after this I left the Place,
and Embark'd for <HI>England,</HI> in a &s;tout Ship, carry|ing
24 Guns, and about &s;ix Hundred Hog&s;heds of
Tobacco, and we left the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> on the
fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>&mdash;: We had a very &s;our and rough
Voyage for the fir&s;t Fortnight, tho' it was in a
Sea&s;on &s;o generally noted for good Weather.</P>
<P>AFTER we had been about eleven Days at Sea,
having the Wind mo&s;t part of the Time blowing
very hard at We&s;t or between the We&s;t and
N. W. by which we were carried a great way far|ther
to the Ea&s;tward, than they u&s;ually go in
their Cour&s;e for <HI>England,</HI> we met with a furious
Tempe&s;t, which held us five Days, blowing mo&s;t
of the time exce&s;&s;ive hard, and by which, we were
oblig'd to run away a$ore the Wind, <HI>as the Sea|men
call it,</HI> where&s;oever it was, our Lot to go;
by this Storm, our Ship was greatly damag'd, and
&s;ome Leaks we had, but not &s;o bad, but that by
the diligence of the Seamen they were &s;topp'd:
However, the Captain after having beaten up
<PB N="224" REF="230">
again, as well as he could again&s;t the Weather
and the Sea going very high, at length he re&s;ol|ved
to go away for the <HI>Bermudas.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS not Seaman enough to under&s;tand what
the Rea&s;on of their Di&s;putes was, but in their
running for the I&s;lands, it &s;eems they over-&s;hot the
Latitude, and could never reach the I&s;land of
<HI>Bermudas</HI> again; the Ma&s;ter and the Mate differ|ed
to an extremity about this; their reckonings,
being more than u&s;ually wide of one another, the
Storm having driven them a little out of their
Knowledge; the Ma&s;ter being a po&s;itive Man, in|&s;ulted
the Mate about it, and threatn'd to ex|po&s;e
him for it, when he came to <HI>England:</HI> The
Mate was an excellent Sea Arti&s;t, and an expe|rienc'd
Sailor, but withal a mode&s;t Man; and
tho' he in&s;i&s;ted upon his being right, did it
in re&s;pectful Terms, and as it became him; but
after &s;everal days Di&s;pute, when the Weather
came to abate, and the Heavens to clear up that
they could take their Ob&s;ervations, and know
where they were, it appear'd that the Mates ac|count
was right, and the Captain was mi&s;taken,
for they were then in the Latitude of 29 Degrees,
and quite out of the Wake of the <HI>Bermudas.</HI></P>
<P>THE Mate made no Indecent u&s;e of the Di&s;|covery
at all, and the Captain being convinc'd,
carry'd it civilly to him, and &s;o the Heats were
over among them; but the next Que&s;tion was,
What they &s;hould do next? &s;ome were for go|ing
one Way, &s;ome another, but all agreed they
were not in Condition to go on the direct Cour&s;e
for <HI>England,</HI> unle&s;s they could have a Southerly,
or South-we&s;t Wind, which had not been our
Fate &s;ince we came to Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="231">
UPON the whole, they re&s;olv'd by con&s;ent to
&s;tand away for the <HI>Canaries,</HI> which was the near|e&s;t
Land they could make, except the <HI>Cape de
Verd</HI> I&s;lands, which were too much to the South|ward
for us, if it could be avoided.</P>
<P>UPON this, they &s;tood away N. E. and the Wind
hanging &s;till We&s;terly, or to the Northward of the
We&s;t, we made good Way, and in about 15 Days
&s;ail we made the <HI>Pico Teneriffe</HI> being a mon&s;trous
Hill in one of the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands: Here we
refre&s;h'd our &s;elves, got fre&s;h Water, and &s;ome
fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, and plenty of excellent Wine,
but no Harbour to run into, to take care of the
Ship, which was Leaky, and tender, having had
&s;o much very bad Weather; &s;o we were oblig'd to
do as well as we could, and put to Sea again, af|ter
Riding at the <HI>Canaries</HI> four Days only.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Canaries,</HI> we had tollerable Weather,
and a &s;mooth Sea, till we came into the Sound|ings,
&s;o they call the Mouth of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Chan|nel,
and the Wind blowing hard at the N. and
N. W. oblig'd us to keep a larger Offing, as the
Seamen call it, at our Enterance into the Chan|nel,
when behold! in the gray of the Morning, a
<HI>French</HI> Crui&s;er, or Privateer of 26 Guns appear'd,
and crowded after us with all the Sail they could
make: In &s;hort, our Captain exchang'd a Broad|&s;ide
or two with them, which was terrible Work
to me; for I had never &s;een &s;uch before, the
<HI>Frenchman's</HI> Guns having Raked us, and kill'd and
wounded &s;ix of our be&s;t Men.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, after a Fight long enough to &s;how us,
that if we would not be taken, we mu&s;t re&s;olve to
&s;ink by her Side, for there was no room to ex|pect
Deliverance; and a Fight long enough to
<PB N="226" REF="232">
&s;ave the Ma&s;ter's Credit, we were taken, and
the Ship carried away for St. <HI>Malo's.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS not mnch concern'd for the lo&s;s I had
in the Ship, becau&s;e I knew I had &s;ufficient in the
World &s;omewhere or other; but as I was effectu|ally
&s;trip'd of every thing I had about me, and
even almo&s;t my Cloaths from my back, I was in
but a very indifferent Condition; but &s;ome Body
informing the Captain of the Privateer, that I
was a Pa&s;&s;enger, and a Merchant, he call'd for
me, and inquir'd into my Circum&s;tances, and
coming to hear from my&s;elf, how I had been us'd,
oblig'd the Seamen to give me a Coat and Hat,
and a pair of Shoes, which they had taken off me,
and him&s;elf gave me a Morning Gown of his
own, to wear while I was in his Ship, and to give
him his due treated me very well.</P>
<P>I HAD however, be&s;ides my being taken, the
Mortification to be detain'd on Board the Crui|&s;er,
and &s;eeing the Ship I was in Mann'd with
<HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and &s;ent away, as above, for St. <HI>Ma|lo,</HI>
and this was a greater Mortification to me af|terwards,
when being brought into St. <HI>Malos,</HI> I
heard that our own Ship was Retaken in her
Pa&s;&s;age to St <HI>Malo's</HI> by an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> of War, and
carryed to <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN our Ship was &s;ent away, the <HI>Rover</HI>
Cruis'd abroad again in the Mouth of the Channel
for &s;ome time; but met with no Purcha&s;e, at la&s;t
they made a Sail, which prov'd to be one of their
Nation, and one of their own Trade, from whom
they learn'd (the News having been carried to
<HI>England,</HI> that &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Privateers lay off and
on, in the Soundings,) that three <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> of War
were come out from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> on purpo&s;e to Crui&s;e
in the Channel, and that they would certainly meet
<PB N="227" REF="233">
with us. Upon this Intelligence, the <HI>Frenchman,</HI>
a bold brave Fellow, far from &s;hrinking from
his Work, &s;tands away North Ea&s;t for St. <HI>Georges</HI>
Channel, and in the Latitude of 48 and a half, un|happily
enough, meets with a large and rich <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Ship, bound home from <HI>Jamaica;</HI> it was in
the gray of the Morning, and very clear when a
Man on the Round-Top, cry'd out <HI>an voile,</HI> a Sail:
I was in hopes indeed it had been the <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen</HI>
of War, and by the Hurry and Clutter
they were in, to get all ready for a Fight, I con|cluded
it was &s;o, and got out of my Hammock, for
I had no Cabbin to lye in, that I might &s;ee what
it was, but I &s;oon found that my hopes were
vain, and it was on the wrong Side; for that
being on our Larboard Bow, the Ship lying
then Northward, to make the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI>
by the time I was turn'd out I could per|ceive
they had all their Sails bent, and full, ha|ving
begun to Chace, and making great way; on
the other Hand, it was Evident the Ship &s;aw
them too, and knew what they were, and to a|void
them, &s;tretch'd away with all the Canvas they
could lay on, for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to run
in there for Harbour.</P>
<P>OUR Privateer, it was plain, infinitely out &s;ail'd
her, running two Foot for her one, and towards
Evening came up with them; had they been able
to have held it but &s;ix Hours longer, they would
have got into <HI>Limerick</HI> River, or &s;omewhere un|der
Shore; &s;o that we &s;hould not have ven|tured
upon them, but we came up with them,
and the Captain when he &s;ee there was no Reme|dy,
bravely brought too, and prepar'd to Fight,
&s;he was a Ship of 30 Guns, but deep in the
Sea, cumber'd between Deck with Goods, and
<PB N="228" REF="234">
could not run out her lower Deck Guns, the Sea
al&s;o going pretty high, tho' at la&s;t ventur'd
to open her Gun-room Ports, and Fire with
three Guns on a Side; but her wor&s;t fate was,
&s;he &s;ail'd heavy, being deep Loaden, and the
<HI>Frenchman</HI> had run up by her Side, and pour'd in
his Broad-&s;ide, and was &s;oon ready again; How|ever,
as &s;he was well Mann'd too, and that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors be&s;tirr'd them&s;elves, they gave us
their Broad-&s;ides too very nimbly and heartily,
and I found the <HI>Frenchman</HI> had a great many Men
kill'd at the fir&s;t Bru&s;h, but the next was wor&s;e,
for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, tho' &s;he did not &s;ail &s;o
well as the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> was a bigger Ship, and
&s;trong built, and as we (the <HI>French</HI>) bore down
upon them again, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> run boldly on Board
us, and lay'd Thwart our Hau&s;e, la&s;hing them|&s;elves
fa&s;t to us; then it was that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Captain run out his lower Tire of Guns, and in|deed
tore the <HI>Frenchman</HI> &s;o, that had he held it,
the Privateer would have had the wor&s;t of it;
but the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> with admirable readine&s;s in|deed,
and Courage, the Captain appearing every
where, with his Sword in his Hand, be&s;tirr'd them|&s;elves,
and loo&s;ing them&s;elves from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Ship, thru&s;ting her off with Brooms, and pour|ing
their &s;mall Shot &s;o thick, that the other
could not appear upon Deck; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> clearing
them&s;elves thus, they came to lye a Broad&s;ide of
each other, when by long firing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship
was at length di&s;abled, her Mi&s;&s;en-Ma&s;t and Bole|&s;prit
&s;hot away, and which was wor&s;t of all, her
Captain kill'd, &s;o that after a Fight which held
all Night, for they fought in the Dark, and part
of the next Day, they were oblig'd to Strike.</P>
<P>I was civily de&s;ir'd by the <HI>French</HI> Captain to
go down into the Hold, while the Fight held,
<PB N="229" REF="235">
and be&s;ides the Civility of it, I found he was
not willing I &s;hould be upon Deck; perhaps he
thought I might have &s;ome Opportunity to do hurt,
tho' I know not how it could be: However, I was
very ready to go down, for I had no Mind to be
Kill'd; e&s;pecially by my own Friends, &s;o I went
down and &s;at by the Surgeon, and had the Oppor|tunity
to find, that the fir&s;t Broad-&s;ide the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Fir'd, &s;even wounded Men were brought down to
the Surgeon, and three and Thirty more after|ward;
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lay Thwart
their Bow, and after they Cleared them&s;elves,
there was about Eleven more; &s;o that they had
one and fifty Men Wounded, and about two and
Twenty Kill'd, the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> had eighteen Men
Kill'd and Wounded, among whom, was the Captain.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> Captain however, triumph'd in
this Prize, for it was an exceeding Rich Ship, ha|ving
Abundance of Silver on Board; and after
the Ship was taken, and they had Plundered all
the great Cabbin afforded, which was very Con&s;i|derable;
the Mate promis'd the Captain; that if
he would give him his Liberty, he would di&s;cover
Six Thou&s;and peices of Eight to him Privately,
which none of the Men &s;hould know of; the Cap|tain
engag'd, and gave it under his Hand to &s;et
him at Liberty, as &s;oon as he came on Shore; ac|cordingly
in the Night after all was either turn'd
in, <HI>as they call it,</HI> or Employ'd on the Duty of
the Watch, the Captain, and the Mate of the
Prize went on Board, and having faithfully Di&s;|cover'd
the Money which lay in a Place made on
purpo&s;e to Conceal it; the Captain re&s;olv'd to
let it lye till they arriv'd, and then he Convey'd
it on Shore for his own u&s;e; &s;o that the Owners
nor the Seamen ever came to any Share of it,
<PB N="230" REF="236">
which by the way was a Fraud in the Captain,
but the Mate paid his Ran&s;om by the Di&s;covery,
and the Captain gave him his Liberty very Pun|ctually
as he promis'd, and two Hundred peices
of Eight to carry him into <HI>England,</HI> and to make
good his Lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN he had made this Prize, the Captain
thought of nothing more, than how to get &s;afe to
<HI>France</HI> with her; for &s;he was a Ship &s;ufficient to
Enrich all his Men, and his Owners al&s;o. The
Account of her Cargo by the Captains Books, of
which I took a Copy, was in general:
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>260 Hhds Sugar.</ITEM>
<ITEM>187 Smaller Cask of Sugar.</ITEM>
<ITEM>176 Barrels of <HI>Indico.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>28 Cask of <HI>Piemento.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>42 Baggs of Cotton-Woll.</ITEM>
<ITEM>80 C. Weight of <HI>Elephants</HI> Teeth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>60 Small Cask of Rum.</ITEM>
<ITEM>18000 Peices of Eight, be&s;ides the 6000
Conceal'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Several parcels of Drugs, Tortoi&s;e-&s;hell,
Sweet-meats call'd Succads, Choco|late.
Lime-juice, and other things of
con&s;iderable Value.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>THIS was a Terrible lo&s;s among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Merchants, and a noble Booty for the Rogues that
took it; but as it was in open War, and by fair
Fighting as they call it, there was no Objection
to be made again&s;t them, and to give them their
Due, they Fought bravely for it.</P>
<P>THE Captain was not &s;o bold as to meeting
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Men of War before, but he was as
wary now; for having a Prize of &s;uch Value in
<PB N="231" REF="237">
his Hands, he was re&s;olv'd not to lo&s;e her again,
if he could help it; &s;o he &s;tood away to the South|ward,
and that &s;o far, that I once thought he was
re&s;olv'd to go into the Streights, and Home by <HI>Mar|&s;eilles.</HI>
But having &s;ail'd to the Latitude of 45.
3 qrs. or thereabouts, he &s;tood away Ea&s;t, into
the Bottom of the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> and carried us
all into the River of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> where on Notice
of his Arrival with &s;uch a Prize, his Owners or
Principals came Overland to &s;ee him, and where
they con&s;ulted what to do with her; the Money
they &s;ecur'd to be &s;ure, and &s;ome of the Cargo;
but the Ships &s;ail'd afterwards along the Coa&s;t to
St. <HI>Malo,</HI> taking the Opportunity of &s;ome <HI>French</HI>
Men of War which were Crui&s;ing on the Coa&s;t,
to be their Convoy as far as <HI>U&s;hant.</HI></P>
<P>HERE the Captain rewarded and di&s;mi&s;s'd the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mate, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> who got a Pa&s;&s;age
from thence to <HI>Diep</HI> by Sea, and after that into
<HI>England,</HI> by the help of a Pa&s;&s;port, thro' <HI>Flanders,</HI>
to <HI>O&s;tend;</HI> the Captain it &s;eems, the more willing|ly
Ship'd him off, that he might not Di&s;cover to
others, what he had Di&s;cover'd to him.</P>
<P>I was now at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and the Cap|tain
ask'd me one Morning, what I intended to
do, I did not under&s;tand him at fir&s;t, but he &s;oon
gave me to under&s;tand, that I was now either to
be deliver'd up to the State as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oner,
and &s;o be carried to <HI>Dinant</HI> in <HI>Britanny,</HI> or to find
means to have my &s;elf Exchang'd, or to pay my
Ran&s;om; and this Ran&s;om he told me at fir&s;t, was
300 Crowns.</P>
<P>I knew not what to do, but de&s;ir'd he would
give me time to Write to <HI>England,</HI> to my Friends;
for that I had a Cargo of Goods &s;ent to them, by
me, from <HI>Virginia,</HI> but I did not know but it
<PB N="232" REF="238">
might have fallen into &s;uch Hands as his were,
and if it was, I knew not what would be my Fate;
he readily granted that, &s;o I Wrote by the Po&s;t,
and had the Satisfaction in An&s;wer to it, to hear
that the Ship I was taken in, had been retaken,
and carried into <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> which I doubted
would have made my new Ma&s;ter more &s;trict, and
perhaps in&s;olent, but he &s;aid nothing of it to me,
nor I to him, tho' as I afterwards under&s;tand, he
had Advice of it before.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this was a help to me, and &s;erv'd
to more than Pay my Ran&s;om to the Captain;
and my Corre&s;pondent in <HI>London</HI> hearing of my
being alive, and at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> immediately &s;ent
me a Letter of Credit upon an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant
at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> for what ever I might have Occa|&s;ion
for: As &s;oon as I received this, I went to the
Merchant, who Honour'd the Letter of Credit,
and told me, I &s;hould have what Money I pleas'd.
But as I, who was before a meer Stranger in the
Place, and knew not what Cour&s;e to take, had
now as it were a Friend to Communicate my Af|fairs
to, and Con&s;ult with; as &s;oon as I told him
my Ca&s;e, Hold, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if that be your Ca&s;e, I
may perhaps find a way to get you off without a
Ran&s;om.</P>
<P>THERE was it &s;eems, a Ship Bound Home to
<HI>France</HI> from <HI>Martinico,</HI> taken off of Cape <HI>Fini&s;terre</HI>
by an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> of War, and a Merchant of <HI>Ro|chelle</HI>
being a <HI>Pa&s;&s;enger,</HI> was taken on Board, and
brought into <HI>Plymouth:</HI> This Man had made great
Sollicitation by his Friends to be Exchang'd,
pleading Poverty, and that he was unable to Pay
any Ran&s;om; my Friend told me &s;omething of it,
but not much, only bad me not be too forward
to Pay any Money to the Captain, but pretend
<PB N="233" REF="239">
I cou'd not hear from <HI>England:</HI> This I did, till the
Captain appear'd Impatient.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, the Captain told me I had
us'd him ill; that I had made him expect a Ran|&s;om,
and he had treated me Courteou&s;ly, and been
at Expence to Sub&s;i&s;t me, and that I held him in
Su&s;pence, but that in &s;hort, if I did not procure
the Money, he would &s;end me to <HI>Dinant,</HI> in Ten
Days, to lye there as the King's Pri&s;oner, till I
&s;hould be Exchang'd: My Merchant gave me my
Cue, and by his Direction I an&s;wer'd, I was very
&s;en&s;ible of his Civility, and &s;orry he &s;hould lo&s;e
what Expences he had been at; but that I found
my Friends forgot me, and what to do I did not
know, and that rather than Impo&s;e upon him, I
mu&s;t Submit to go to <HI>Dinant,</HI> or where he thought
fit to &s;end me; but that if ever I obtain'd my Li|berty,
and came into <HI>England,</HI> I would not fail
to Reimbur&s;e him what Expence he had been at
for my Sub&s;i&s;tance; and &s;o in &s;hort, made my
Ca&s;e very bad in all my Di&s;cour&s;e: He &s;hook his
Head, and &s;aid little, but the next Day Enter'd
me in the List of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, to be at the
King's Charge, as appointed by the Intendant of
the Place, and to be &s;ent away into <HI>Britainny.</HI></P>
<P>I was then out of the Captains Power, and im|mediately
the Merchant with two others, who
were Friends to the Merchant Pri&s;oner, at <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI>
went to the Intendant, and Gain'd an Or|der
for the Exchange, and my Friend giving Se|curity
for my being Forth-coming, in Ca&s;e the
other was not Deliver'd; I had my Liberty im|mediately,
and went Home with him to his
Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THUS we Bilk'd the Captain of his Ran&s;om
Money: But however, my Friend went to him,
<PB N="234" REF="240">
and letting him know that I was Exchang'd by
the Governors Order, paid him whatever he cou'd
&s;ay he was in Disbur&s;e on my Account; and it
was not then in the Captains Power to Object,
or to claim any thing for a Ran&s;om.</P>
<P>I got Pa&s;&s;age from hence to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> on Board
a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, and having a Certificate of an
Exchang'd Pri&s;oner from the Intendant of <HI>Bourde|aux:</HI>
I had a Pa&s;&s;port given me, to go into the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Netherlands, and &s;o whether I pleas'd.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY I came to <HI>Ghent,</HI> in <HI>April</HI>&mdash;,
ju&s;t as the Armies were going to take the
Field; I had no di&s;like to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the
Army, but I thought I was a little above it now;
and had other things to look to, for that in my
Opinion, no Body went into the Field but tho&s;e
that cou'd not live at Home; and yet I re&s;olv'd
to &s;ee the manner of it a little too, &s;o having made
an Acquaintance with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officer, Quar|ter'd
at <HI>Ghent,</HI> I told him my Intention, and he
Invited me to go with him, and offer'd me his
Protection as a Voluntier, that I &s;hould Quarter
with him in his Tent, and live as I would, and
either carry Arms, or not, as I &s;aw Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Campaign was none of the harde&s;t that
had been, or were like to be; &s;o that I had the
Diver&s;ion of &s;eeing the Service, as it was proper
to call it without much Hazard, indeed, I did
not &s;ee any con&s;iderable Action, for there was
not much Fighting that Campaign; as to the
Merit of the Cau&s;e on either &s;ide, I knew nothing
of it, nor had I &s;uffer'd any of the Di&s;putes about
it, to enter into my Thoughts: The Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> had been made King of <HI>England,</HI> and the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trcops were all on his Side, and I heard
a great deal of Swearing and Damming for King
<PB N="235" REF="241">
<HI>William</HI> among the Soldiers, but as for Fighting,
I ob&s;erv'd the <HI>French</HI> Beat them &s;everal times,
and particular the Regiment my Friend belo$g'd
to, was &s;urrounded in a Village where they were
Po&s;ted; I know not upon what Occa&s;ion, and all
taken Pri&s;oners: But by great good $ap, I being
not in Service, and &s;o not in Command, was
&s;troll'd away that Day to &s;ee the Country about,
for it was my Delight, to &s;ee the &s;trong Towns,
and ob&s;erve the Beauty of their Fortifications;
and while I Diverted my &s;elf thus, I had the
happy Deliverance of not being taken by the
<HI>French</HI> for that time.</P>
<P>WHEN I came back, I found the Enemy po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
of the Town, but as I was no Soldier, they
did me no harm, and having my <HI>French</HI> Pa&s;&s;port
in my Pocket, they gave me leave to go to <HI>New|port,</HI>
were I took the Packet-Boat, and came over
to <HI>England,</HI> Landing at <HI>Deal</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Dover;</HI>
the Weather forcing us into the <HI>Downs,</HI> and thus
my &s;hort Campaign ended, and this was my &s;e|cond
E&s;&s;ay at the Trade of Soldiering.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to <HI>London,</HI> I was very well re|ceiv'd
by my Friend, to whom I had con&s;ign'd my
Effects, and I found my &s;elf in very good Circum|&s;tances;
for all my Goods, which as above, by
&s;everal Ships I had Con&s;ign'd to him, came &s;afe
to Hand; and my Over&s;eers that I had left be|hind,
had Ship'd at &s;everal times 400 Hhds of
<HI>Tobacco</HI> to my Corre&s;pondent in my Ab&s;ence,
being the Product of my Plantations, or Part of
it, for the time of my being Abroad; &s;o that I
had above a Thou&s;and Pounds in my Factors
Hands, 200 Hhds of <HI>Tobacco</HI> be&s;ides left in Hand,
not Sold.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="242">
I HAD nothing to do now, but entirely to conceal
my&s;elf, from all that had any knowledge of me
before, and this was the ea&s;ie&s;t thing in the World
to do; for I was grown out of every Body's
knowledge, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e I had known were
grown out of mine: My Captain, who went with
me, or rather, who carryed me away; I found by
enquiring at the proper Place, had been ramb|ling
about the World, came to <HI>London,</HI> fell into
his old Trade, which he could not forbear, and
growing an eminent Highway-man, had made his
Exit at the Gallows; after a Life of 14 Years mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite and &s;ucce&s;sful Rogueries; the particulars
of which would make as I ob&s;erv'd an admira|ble
Hi&s;tory; my other Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> who I cal|led
Major follow'd the like wicked Trade; but
was a Man of more Gallantry, and Genero&s;ity,
and having committed innumerable Depredations
upon Mankind, yet had always &s;o much Dexte|rity,
as to bring him&s;elf off, till at length he
was laid fa&s;t in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and loaded with Irons,
and would certainly have gone the &s;ame way as
the Captain; but he was &s;o dexterous a Rogue,
that no Goal, no Fetters would hold him; and he
with two more, found means to knock off their
Irons, work'd their way thro' the Wall of the Pri|&s;on,
and let them&s;elves down on the Out-&s;ide in
the Night; &s;o e&s;caping, they found means to get
into <HI>France,</HI> where he followed the &s;ame Trade,
and that with &s;o much Succe&s;s, that he grew fa|mous
by the Name of <HI>Anthony,</HI> and had the Hon|our
with three of his Comrades, who he had
Taught the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> way of Robbing generou&s;ly,

and who I got the Knowledge of, without letting
them &s;o much as gue&s;s at who I was, or upon what
Account I enquir'd.</P>
<P>I WAS now at the height of my good Fortune;
indeed I was in very good Circum&s;tances, and be|ing
of a frugal Temper from the beginning, I
Sav'd things together, as they came, and yet liv'd
very well too; particularly I had the Repu|tation
of a very con&s;iderable Merchant, and one
that came over va&s;tly Rich from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and as
I frequently brought Supplies for my &s;everal
Families and Plantations there, as they wrote
to me for them, &s;o I pa&s;s'd, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> for a great
Merchant.</P>
<P>I liv'd &s;ingle indeed, and in Lodgings, but I
began to be very well known, and tho' I had &s;ub|&s;crib'd
my Name only <HI>Jack</HI> to my particular
Corre&s;pondent, yet the <HI>French,</HI> among whom I
liv'd near a Year, <HI>as I have &s;aid;</HI> not under&s;tand|ing
what <HI>Jack</HI> meant, call'd me Mon&s;ieur <HI>Jacque,</HI>
and Colonel <HI>Jacques,</HI> and &s;o gradually Colonel
<HI>Jacque;</HI> &s;o I was call'd in the Certificate of Ex|changing
me with the other Pri&s;oner, &s;o that I went
&s;o al&s;o in <HI>Flanders;</HI> upon which, and &s;eeing my
Certificate of Exchange, <HI>as above,</HI> I was call'd
Colonel <HI>Jaques</HI> in <HI>Enland,</HI> by my Friend, who
I call'd Corre&s;pondent; and thus I pa&s;s'd for a
Foreigner, and a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and I was infinite|ly
fond of having every Body take me for a
<HI>Frenchman;</HI> and as I &s;poke <HI>French</HI> very well, ha|ving
<PB N="238" REF="244">
learn'd it by continuing &s;o long among
them; &s;o I went con&s;tantly to the <HI>French-Church</HI>
in <HI>London,</HI> and &s;poke <HI>French</HI> upon all occa&s;ions,
as much as I could, and to compleat the ap|pearance
of it, I got me a <HI>French</HI> Servant to
do my Bu&s;ine&s;s, I mean as to my Merchandi&s;e,
which only con&s;i&s;ted in receiving and di&s;po&s;ing
of Tobacco, of which I had about 500 to 600
Hog&s;heads a Year from my own Plantations,
and in &s;upplying my People with Nece&s;&s;aries, as
they wanted them.</P>
<P>IN this private Condition I continued about
two Year more, when the Devil owing me a
Spleen, ever &s;ince I refus'd being a Thief, paid
me home, with my Intere&s;t, by laying a Snare
in my way, which had almo&s;t ruined me.</P>
<P>THERE dwelt a Lady, in a Hou&s;e oppo&s;ite to
the Hou&s;e I lodg'd in, who made an extraordi|nary
Figure, indeed &s;he went very well Dre&s;s'd,
and was a mo&s;t beautiful Per&s;on; &s;he was well
Bred, Sung admirably fine, and &s;ometimes I could
hear her very di&s;tinctly, the Hou&s;es being over
again&s;t one another, in a narrow Court not much
unlike <HI>Three King Court</HI> in <HI>Lombard Street.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Lady put her&s;elf &s;o often in my way, that
I could not in good Manners forbear taking
Notice of her, and giving her the Ceremony of
my Hat, when I &s;aw her at her Window, or at the
Door, or when I pa&s;s'd her in the Court, &s;o that we
became almo&s;t acquainted at a di&s;tance; &s;ometimes
&s;he al&s;o vi&s;ited at the Hou&s;e I lodg'd at, and it
was generally contriv'd, that I &s;hould be intro|duced
when &s;he came; and thus by degrees we
became more intimately acquainted, and often
convers'd together in the Family, but always in
Publick, at lea&s;t for a great while.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="245">
I WAS a meer Boy in the Affair of Love, and
knew the lea&s;t of what belong'd to a Woman, of any
Man in <HI>Europe</HI> of my Age; the thoughts of a Wife,
much le&s;s of a Mi&s;tre&s;s, had never &s;o much as taken
the lea&s;t hold of my Head, and I had been till
now as perfectly unacquainted with the Sex, and
as unconcern'd about them, as I was when I was
ten Year old, and lay in a Heap of A&s;hes at the
<HI>Gla&s;s-Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I know not by what Witch-Craft in the
Conver&s;ation of this Woman, and her &s;ingling
me out upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, I began to be en|&s;nared,
I knew not how, or to what to End; and was
on a &s;udden &s;o embarra&s;s'd in my Thoughts about
her, that like a Charm &s;he had me always in her
Circle; if &s;he had not been one of the &s;ubtile&s;t,
Women on Earth, &s;he could never have brought
me to have given my&s;elf the lea&s;t Trouble about
her, but I drawn in by the Magick of a Genius
capable to Deceive a more wary Capacity than
mine, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>SHE attack'd me without cea&s;ing, with the fine|ne&s;s
of her Conduct, and with Arts which were
impo&s;&s;ible to be ineffectual; &s;he was ever, as it
were, in my View; often in my Company, and
yet kept her&s;elf &s;o on the Re&s;erve, &s;o &s;urrounded
continually with Ob&s;tructions, that for &s;everal
Months after &s;he could perceive I &s;ought an Op|portunity
to &s;peak to her, &s;he rendered it impo&s;|&s;ible,
nor could I ever break in upon her, &s;he
kept her Guard &s;o well.</P>
<P>THIS rigid Behaviour was the greate&s;t My&s;te|ry
that could be, con&s;idering at the &s;ame time,
that &s;he never Declined my &s;eeing her, or Con|ver&s;ing
with me in Publick; but &s;he held it on,
&s;he took care never to &s;it next me, that I might
<PB N="240" REF="246">
&s;lip no Paper into her Hand, or &s;peak &s;oftly to
her; &s;he kept &s;ome body or other always between,
that I could never come up to her; and thus
as if &s;he was re&s;olv'd really to have nothing to
do with me, &s;he held me at the Bay &s;everal
Months.</P>
<P>ALL this while nothing was more certain then
that &s;he intended to have me, if &s;he could catch,
and it was indeed a kind of a Catch, for &s;he man|ag'd
all by Art, and drew me in with the mo&s;t
re&s;olute backwardne&s;s, that it was almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible
not to be deceiv'd by it; on the other
Hand, &s;he did not appear to be a Woman de&s;pica|ble,
neither was &s;he poor, or in a Condition that
&s;hould require &s;o much Art to draw any Man
in, but the Cheat was really on my Side; for
&s;he was unhappily told, that I was va&s;tly Rich,
a great Merchant, and that &s;he would live like
a Queen, which I was not at all In&s;trumental in
putting upon her, neither did I know that &s;he
went upon that Motive.</P>
<P>SHE was too cunning to let me perceive how
ea&s;ie &s;he was to be had; on the contrary &s;he run
all the hazards of bringing me to neglect her en|tirely,
that one would think any Woman in the
World could do; and I have wondered often &s;ince
that, how it was po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould fail of making
me perfectly Aver&s;e to her; for as I had a per|fect
indifferency for the whole Sex, and never
till then entertain'd any Notion of them, they
were no more to me than a Picture hanging up
again&s;t a Wall.</P>
<P>As we Convers'd freely together in Publick,
&s;o &s;he took a great many Occa&s;ions to rally the
Men, and the weakne&s;s they were guilty of, in
leting the Woman in&s;ult them as they did; &s;he
<PB N="241" REF="247">
thought if the Men had been Fools, Marriage
had been only Treaties of Peace between two
Neighbours, or Alliances Offen&s;ive or Defen|&s;ive,
which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been carried
on &s;ometimes by Interviews, and per&s;onal
Treaties; but oftner by Amba&s;&s;adors, Agents,
and Emi&s;&s;aries on both Sides; but that the Wo|men
had out-witted us, and brought us upon our
Knees, and made us whine after them, and lower
our &s;elves, &s;o as we could never pretend to gain
our equallity again.</P>
<P>I TOLD her I thought it was a Decency to the
Ladies to give them the Advantage of denying a
little, that they might be Courted, and that I &s;hould
not like a Woman the wor&s;e for denying me.
I expect it Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> when I wait on you
to Morrow, intimating, that I intended it; you
&s;han't be deceiv'd Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> for I'll deny
now, before you ask me the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I WAS da&s;h'd &s;o effectually, with &s;o malici|ous,
&s;o devili&s;h an An&s;wer, that I return'd with
a little &s;ullenne&s;s, I &s;han't Tre&s;pa&s;s upon you
yet Madam, and I &s;hall be very careful not to
offend you when I do.</P>
<P>IT is the greate&s;t Token of your Re&s;pect
Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> that you are able to be&s;tow upon
me, and the mo&s;t agreeable too, except one, which
I will not be out of hopes of obtaining of you
in a little time.</P>
<P>WHAT is in my Power to oblige you in
Madam, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> you may command me at any
time, e&s;pecially, the way we are Talking of;
this I &s;poke &s;till with a Re&s;entment very Sincere.</P>
<P>'TIS only, Sir, that you would promi&s;e to
Hate me, with as much Sincerity, as I will endea|vour
to make you a &s;uitable Return.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="248">
I granted that Reque&s;t, Madam, &s;even Year
before you ask'd it, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> for I heartily Hated
the whole Sex, and &s;carce know how I came to
abate that good Di&s;po&s;ition in Compliment to
your Conver&s;ation; but I a&s;&s;ure you that abate|ment
is &s;o little, that it does no Injury to your
Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>THERE's &s;ome My&s;tery in that indeed, Sir,
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> for I de&s;ir'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t your Aver&s;ion to
Women in a more particular manner, and hop'd it
&s;hould never abate under my Management. We
&s;aid a Thou&s;and ill-natured things after this, but
&s;he out-did me, for &s;he had &s;uch a Stock of bitter|ne&s;s
upon her Tongue, as no Woman ever went be|yond
her, and yet all this while &s;he was the plea|&s;ante&s;t,
and mo&s;t obliging Creature in every Part
of our Conver&s;ation that could po&s;&s;ibly be, and
meant not one Word of what &s;he &s;aid, no, not a
Word: But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it no way an&s;wer'd her
End, for it really cooled all my Thoughts of her,
and I that had liv'd in &s;o perfect an indifferency
to the Sex all my Days, was ea&s;ily return'd to
that Condition again, and began to grow very
cold and negligent in my u&s;ual Re&s;pects to her up|on
all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>SHE &s;oon found &s;he had gone too far with me;
and in &s;hort, that &s;he was extreamly out in her
Politicks, that &s;he had to do with one that was
not li&s;ted yet among the whining Sort of Lovers,
and knew not what it was to Adore a Mi&s;|tre&s;s,
in order to abu&s;e her; and that it was
not with me, as it was with the u&s;ual Sort of
Men in Love, that are warm'd by the cold, and
ri&s;e in their Pa&s;&s;ions, as the Ladies fall in their
Returns; on the contrary, &s;he found that it was
quite alter'd; I was Civil to her, as before, but not
<PB N="243" REF="249">
&s;o forward, when I &s;aw her at her Chamber Win|dow,
I did not throw mine open, as I u&s;ually, had
done to Talk with her; when &s;he Sung in the Par|lour,
where I could ea&s;ily, hear it, I did not Li&s;ten;
when &s;he Vi&s;ited at the Hou&s;e where I Lodg'd, I
did not always come down, or if I did. I had bu&s;i|ne&s;s
which oblig'd me to go Abroad, and yet
all this while, when I did come into her Com|pany,
I was as intimate as ever.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily &s;ee that this madded her to the
Heart, and that &s;he was perplex'd to the la&s;t
degree, for &s;he found that &s;he had all her Game
to play over again; that &s;o ab&s;olute a Re&s;erved|ne&s;s,
even to Rudene&s;s and Ill-manners, was a
little too much; but &s;he was a meer Po&s;ture
Mi&s;tre&s;s in Love, and could put her&s;elf into
what Shapes &s;he pleas'd.</P>
<P>SHE was to wi&s;e to &s;how a fondne&s;s or forward|ne&s;s,
that look'd like kindne&s;s, &s;he knew that was
the meane&s;t, and the la&s;t Step a Woman can
take, and lays her under the Foot of the Man
&s;he pretends to; Fondne&s;s is not the la&s;t Favour
indeed, but it is the la&s;t Favour but one, that a Wo|man
can grant, and lays her almo&s;t as low, I mean
it lays her at the Mercy of the Man, &s;he &s;hows it to,
but &s;he was not come to that neither: This Ca|melion
put on another Colour, turn'd on a &s;ud|den
the grave&s;t, &s;obere&s;t, maje&s;tick Madam, &s;o that
any one would have thought &s;he was advanced in
Age in one Week, from Two and Twenty, to
Fifty, and this &s;he carried on with &s;o much Go|vernment
of her &s;elf, that it did not in the lea&s;t
look like Art, but if it was a Repre&s;entation
of Nature only, it was &s;o like Nature it&s;elf, that
no body living can be able to di&s;tingui&s;h; &s;he
Sung very often in her Parlour, as well by her
<PB N="244" REF="250">
&s;elf as with two young Ladies, who came often
to &s;ee her; I could &s;ee by their Books, and her
Guitar in her Hand, that &s;he was Singing, but
&s;he never open'd the Window as &s;he was wont
to do; upon my coming to my Window, &s;he
kept her own always &s;hut, or if it was open,
&s;he would be &s;itting at Work and not look up,
it may be once in Half an Hour.</P>
<P>IF &s;he &s;aw me by Accident all this while, &s;he
would &s;mile and &s;peak as chearfully as ever,
but it was but a Word or two, and &s;o make her Ho|nours
and be gone; &s;o that in a Word, we Convers'd
ju&s;t as we did; after I had been there a Week.</P>
<P>SHE tired me quite out at this Work, for tho'
I began the &s;trangne&s;s indeed, yet I did not de|&s;ign
the carrying it on &s;o far, but &s;he held it to
the la&s;t, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as &s;he began
it: She came to the Hou&s;e where I Lodg'd, as
u&s;ual, and we were often together, Supp'd toge|ther,
Play'd at Cards together, Danc'd together;
for in <HI>France</HI> I accompli&s;h'd my&s;elf with every
thing that was needful, to make me what I be|liev'd
my&s;elf to be even from a Boy, I mean a
Gentleman; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> we Convers'd together, <HI>as a|bove,</HI>
but &s;he was &s;o perfectly another thing
than what &s;he us'd to be in every Part of her
Conver&s;ation, that it pre&s;ently occurr'd to me,
that her former Behaviour was a kind of a Rant,
or Fit; that either it was the Effect of &s;ome
extraordinary Levity that had come upon her,
or that it was done to Mimick the Coquets of the
Town, believing it might take with me, who &s;he
thought was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and that it was what I
lov'd; but her new Gravity was her real natural
Temper, and indeed became it her &s;o much
better, or as I &s;hould &s;ay, &s;he acted it &s;o well,
<PB N="245" REF="251">
that it really brought me back, to have, not as
much only, but more mind to her, than ever I
had before.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it was a great while before I di&s;co|ver'd
my&s;elf, and I &s;tay'd indeed to find out, if
po&s;&s;ible, whether this Change was Real or Coun|terfeit?
for I could not ea&s;ily believe it was po&s;|&s;ible
the Gay Humour &s;he us'd to appear in could
be a Counterfeit; it was not therefore till a Year
and almo&s;t a Quarter, that I came to any Re&s;o|lution
in my Thoughts about her, when on a
meer Accident we came to a little Conver&s;ation
together.</P>
<P>SHE came to Vi&s;it at our Hou&s;e as u&s;ual, and
it happen'd all the Ladies were gone abroad; but
as it fell out, I was in the Pa&s;&s;age, or Entry of
the Hou&s;e, going towards the Stairs, when &s;he
knock'd at the Door; &s;o &s;tepping back, I open'd
the Door, and &s;he without any Ceremony came
in and run forward into the Parlour, &s;uppo&s;ing
the Women had been there, I went in after her,
as I could do no le&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he did know that
the Family was Abroad.</P>
<P>UPON my coming in, &s;he ask'd for the Ladies,
I told her, I hop'd &s;he came to Vi&s;it me now, for
that the Ladies were all gone abroad; are they, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he,</HI> as if &s;urpris'd (tho' as I under&s;tood afterwards
&s;he knew it before, as al&s;o that I was at home) and
then ri&s;es up to be gone; no Madam, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> Pray
do not go; when Ladies come to Vi&s;it me, I do
not u&s;e to tyre them of my Company &s;o &s;oon,
that's as Ill-natured, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> as you could po&s;&s;i|bly
talk, pray don't Pretend I came to Vi&s;it
you, I am &s;atisfy'd who I came to Vi&s;it, and &s;a|tisfy'd
that you know it; yes Madam, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
<PB N="246" REF="252">
but if I happen to be all of the Family that's left
at home, then you came to Vi&s;it me.</P>
<P>I never receive Vi&s;its from tho&s;e that I hate,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have me there indeed, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> but you never
gave me leave to tell you, why I hated you, I
hated you becau&s;e you would never give me an
Opportuity to tell you I lov'd you; &s;ure you
took me for &s;ome frightful Creature that you
would never come near enough, &s;o much as to
Whi&s;per to you that I love you.</P>
<P>I never care to hear any thing &s;o di&s;agreeable,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> tho' it be &s;poken ever &s;o &s;oftly.</P>
<P>WE rallyed thus for an Hour; in &s;hort, &s;he &s;how|ed
the abundance of her Wit, and I an abundant
defficiency of mine; for tho' three or four times &s;he
provok'd me to the la&s;t degree; &s;o that once I was
going to tell her I had enough of her Company,
and if &s;he pleas'd I would wait upon her to the
Door; yet &s;he had always &s;o much Witchcraft on
her Tongue, that &s;he brought her&s;elf off again; till
to make the Story &s;hort, we came at la&s;t to talk
&s;eriou&s;ly on both Sides about Matrimony, and
&s;he heard me freely propo&s;ed it, and an&s;wered me
directly upon many occa&s;ions: For Example, &s;he
told me, I would carry her away to <HI>France,</HI> or to
<HI>Virginia,</HI> and that &s;he could not think of leaving
<HI>England,</HI> her native Country; I told her I hop'd
&s;he did not take me for a Kidnapper: By the way,
I did not tell her how I had been Kidnapp'd my|&s;elf:
She &s;aid no, but the Con&s;equence of my
Affairs, which were it &s;eems mo&s;tly Abroad, might
oblige me to go, and &s;he could never think of
Marrying any Man, that &s;he could not be content
to go all over the World with, if he had occa&s;ion
to go him&s;elf: This was hand&s;omely expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="247" REF="253">
indeed; I made her ea&s;ie in that Point, and thus we
began the grand Parlee, which indeed &s;he drew me
into with the utmo&s;t Art and Subtilty, &s;uch as was
peculiar to her&s;elf, but was infinitely her Ad|vantage
in our Treating of Marriage; for &s;he made
me effectually Court her, tho' at the &s;ame time
in her De&s;ign &s;he Courted me with the utmo&s;t
Skill, and &s;uch Skill it was that her De&s;ign was
perfectly impenetrable to the la&s;t Moment.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, we came nearer and nearer every time
we met, and after one ca&s;ual Vi&s;it more, in
which I had the mighty Favour of talking with
her alone; I then waited on her every Day at her
own Hou&s;e or Lodgings rather, and &s;o we &s;et a|bout
the Work to a purpo&s;e, and in about a Month
we gave the World the &s;lip, and were privately
Marry'd to avoid Ceremony, and the publick In|conveniency
of a Wedding.</P>
<P>WE &s;oon found a Hou&s;e proper for our dwel|ling,
and &s;o went to Hou&s;e-keeping; we had not
been long together, but I found that gay Temper
of my Wife return'd, and &s;he threw off the Mask
of her Gravity, and good Conduct, that I had &s;o
long Fancy'd was her meer natural Di&s;po&s;ition,
and now having no more occa&s;ion for Di&s;gui&s;es,
&s;he re&s;olv'd to &s;eem nothing but what really &s;he
was, a wild untam'd Colt, perfectly loo&s;e, and
carele&s;s to conceal any part, no, not the wor&s;t of
her Conduct.</P>
<P>SHE carry'd on this Air of Levity to &s;uch an
Exce&s;s, that I could not but be di&s;&s;atisfy'd at the
Expence of it, for &s;he kept Company that I did not
like, liv'd beyond what I could &s;upport, and
&s;ometimes lo&s;t at Play more than I car'd to pay:
Upon which, one Day, I took Occa&s;ion to men|tion
it, but lightly; and &s;aid to her, by way of
<PB N="248" REF="254">
Rallery, that we liv'd merrily, for as long as
it would la&s;t; &s;he turn'd &s;hort upon me, what do

do ye? No, no, Madam, not I, by no means,

long you will plea&s;e to take to di&s;patch me, for
I would not be too long a dying.</P>
<P>I don't know what you talk of, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you
may die as lei&s;urely, or as ha&s;tily as you plea&s;e
when your time comes, I an't a going to kill you,
as I know of.</P>
<P>BUT you are a going to &s;tarve me Madam, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he,</HI> and Hunger is as lei&s;urely a Death, as breaking
upon the Wheel.</P>
<P>I &s;tarve you, Why are not you a great <HI>Virgi|nia</HI>
Merchant, and did not I bring you 1500 <HI>l.</HI>
What would you have? &s;ure, you can maintain
a Wife out of that can't you?</P>
<P>YES, Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I could maintain a Wife,
but not a Gamfter, tho' you had brought me 1500 <HI>l.</HI>
a Year, no E&s;tate is big enough for a Box and
Dice.</P>
<P>SHE took Fire at that, and flew out in a Pa&s;|&s;ion,
and after a great many bitter Words, told
me in &s;hort, that &s;he &s;aw no occa&s;ion to alter
her Conduct, and as for my not maintaining her,
when I could not maintain her longer, &s;he would
find &s;ome way or other to maintain her&s;elf.</P>
<P>SOMETIME after the fir&s;t Rattle of this kind,
&s;he vouch&s;afed to let me know that &s;he was pleas'd
to be with Child; I was at fir&s;t glad of it, in
hopes it would help to abate her Madne&s;s; but
it was all one, and her being with Child; only
<PB N="249" REF="255">
added to the re&s;t, for &s;he made &s;uch Preparations
for her lying in, and the other Appendixes of a
Childs being born, that in &s;hort, I found &s;he would
be down right Di&s;tracted, and I took the Liberty
to tell her one Day, that &s;he would &s;oon bring
her&s;elf and me to De&s;truction, and entreated her
to con&s;ider that &s;uch Figures as tho&s;e were quite
above us, and out of our Circle; and in &s;hort, that
I neither could, nor would allow &s;uch Expences,
that at this Rate, two or three Children would
effectually ruin me, and that I de&s;ir'd her to con|&s;ider
what &s;he was doing.</P>
<P>SHE told me with an Air of di&s;dain, that it
was none of her Bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider any thing of
that matter, that if I could not allow it, &s;he
would allow it her &s;elf, and I might do my wor&s;t.</P>
<P>I begg'd her to con&s;ider things for all that, and
not drive me to Extremities, that I married her
to love and cheri&s;h her, and u&s;e her as a good
Wife ought to be us'd, but not to be ruin'd, and
undone by her. In a Word, nothing could mo|lifie
her, nor any Argument per&s;wade her to Mo|deration,
but withal took it &s;o heiniou&s;ly that I
&s;hould pretend to re&s;train her, that &s;he told me
in &s;o many Words, &s;he would drop her Burthen
with me, and then if I did not like it, &s;he would
take care of her&s;elf, &s;he would not live with me
an Hour, for &s;he would not be re&s;train'd not &s;he,
and talk'd a long while at that Rate.</P>
<P>I told her, as to her Child, which &s;he call'd her
Burthen, it &s;hould be no Burthen to me, as to the
re&s;t, &s;he might do as &s;he pleas'd; it might however
do me this Favour, that I &s;hould have no more Ly|ings-Inn
at the rate of 136 <HI>l.</HI> at a time, as I found
&s;he intended it &s;hould be now; &s;he told me &s;he
<PB N="250" REF="256">
cou'd not tell that, if &s;he had no more by me, &s;he
hop'd &s;he &s;hould by &s;ome Body el&s;e; &s;ay you &s;o
Madam, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> then they that get them, &s;hall keep
them? She did not know that neither, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI>
and &s;o turn'd it off Jearing, and as it were Laugh|ing
at me.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e Nettl'd me, I mu&s;t Con|fe&s;s,
and the more, becau&s;e I had a great deal of
it, and very often, till in &s;hort, we began at
length to enter into a Friendly Treaty about
Parting.</P>
<P>NOTHING cou'd be more Criminal than the &s;e|veral
Di&s;cour&s;es we had upon this Subject; &s;he de|manding
a &s;eparate Maintenance, and in particu|lar
at the Rate of 300 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, and I demanded
Security of her, that &s;he &s;hould not run me in
Debt; &s;he Demanded the keeping of the Child,
with an Allowance of 100 <HI>l.</HI> a Year for that, and
I Demanding that I &s;hould be &s;ecur'd from being
Charg'd for keeping any &s;he might have by &s;ome
Body el&s;e, as &s;he had threaten'd me.</P>
<P>IN the Interval, and during the&s;e Conte&s;ts, &s;he
Drop'd her Burthen, <HI>as &s;he call'd it,</HI> and brought
me a Son, a very fine Child.</P>
<P>SHE was Content during her lying in, to abate
a little, tho' it was but a very little indeed, of
the great Expence &s;he had intended; and with
&s;ome Difficulty and Per&s;wa&s;ion was content with
a Suit of Child-bed-linnen of 15 <HI>l.</HI> in&s;tead of one
&s;he had intended of Three&s;core; and this &s;he mag|nified
as a particular Te&s;timony of her Conde&s;cen|&s;ion,
and a yielding to my Avaricious Temper, <HI>as
&s;he call'd it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT after &s;he was up again, it was the &s;ame
thing, and &s;he went on with her Humour to that
Degree, that in a little time &s;he began to carry
<PB N="251" REF="257">
it on to other Exce&s;&s;es, and to have a &s;ort of Fellows
come to Vi&s;it her, which I did not like, and once
in particular, &s;tay'd Abroad all Night: The next
Day when &s;he came Home, &s;he began to Cry out
fir&s;t; told me where (as &s;he &s;aid) &s;he lay, and that
the Occa&s;ion was a Chri&s;tening, where the Com|pany
had a Fea&s;t, and &s;tay'd too late; that if I
was di&s;&s;atisfied, I might inform my &s;elf there of
all the particulars, where &s;he lay, <HI>and the like;</HI>
I told her coldly, Madam, you do well to Sugge&s;t
my being di&s;&s;atisfied, for you may be &s;ure I am,
and you cou'd expect no other; that as to going
to your Haunts to inform my &s;elf, that's not my
Bu&s;ine&s;s; 'tis your Bu&s;ine&s;s to bring Te&s;timonies
of your Behaviour, and to prove where you lay,
and in what Company, 'tis enough to me that you
lay out of your own Hou&s;e, without your Hus|bands
Knowledge or Con&s;ent, and before you and I
Conver&s;e again, I mu&s;t have &s;ome Satisfaction of
the particulars.</P>
<P>SHE an&s;wer'd, with all her Heart, &s;he was as
Indifferent as I, and &s;ince I took &s;o ill her lying
at a Friend's Hou&s;e, on an extraordinary Occa&s;ion,
&s;he gave me to under&s;tand that it was what &s;he
would have me expect, and what &s;he would have
the Liberty to do, when &s;he thought fit.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> if I mu&s;t expect what
I cannot allow, you mu&s;t expect I &s;hall &s;hut my
Doors by Day, again&s;t tho&s;e that keep out of them
at Night.</P>
<P>SHE would try me, <HI>&s;he &s;aid,</HI> very &s;peedily, and
if I &s;hut the Doors again&s;t her, &s;he would find a|way
to make me open them.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you threaten me hard,
but I would advi&s;e you to con&s;ider before you
take &s;uch Mea&s;ures, for I &s;hall be as good as my
<PB N="252" REF="258">
Word: However, it was not long that we cou'd
live together upon the&s;e Terms; for I found very
quickly what Company &s;he kept, and that &s;he
took a Cour&s;e which I ought not to bear; &s;o I be|gan
the Separation fir&s;t, and refus'd her my Bed:
We had indeed refrain'd all Conver&s;e as Husband
and Wife for about two Months before; for I told
her very plainly, I would Father no Brats that
were not of my own getting; and Matters coming
thus Gradually to an Extremity, too great to con|tinue
as it was; &s;he went off one Afternoon,
and left me a Line in Writing, &s;ignifying that
Affairs were come to &s;uch a pa&s;s between us, that
&s;he did not think fit to give me the Opportunity
of &s;hutting her out of Doors, and that therefore,
&s;he had retir'd her &s;elf to &s;uch a Place; naming,
a Relation of her own, as &s;candalous as her &s;elf;
and that &s;he hop'd I would not give her the trou|ble
to Sue for her Support, in the ordinary Cour&s;e
of Law; but that as her Occa&s;ions requir'd, &s;he
&s;hould draw Bills upon me, which &s;he expected I
would not refu&s;e.</P>
<P>I was extremely &s;atisfied with this proceeding,
and took care to let her hear of it, tho' I gave no
an&s;wer at all to her Letter, and as I had taken
care before, that whenever &s;he play'd &s;uch a
Prank as this, &s;he &s;hould not be able to carry
much with her; &s;o after &s;he was gone, I immedi|ately
broke up Hou&s;e-keeping, &s;old my Furni|ture
by Publick out-cry, and in it every thing in
particular that was her own, and &s;et a Bill upon
my Door, giving her to under&s;tand by it, that
&s;he had pa&s;s'd <HI>the Rubicon,</HI> that as &s;he had taken
&s;uch a &s;tep of her own Accord, &s;o there was no
room left her, ever to think of coming back again.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="259">
THIS was what any one may believe I &s;hould
not have done, if I had &s;een any Room for a Re|formation,
but &s;he had given me &s;uch Te&s;timo|nies
of a Mind alienated from her Husband in
particular, E&s;pou&s;ing her own un&s;ufferable Levi|ty,
that there was indeed no po&s;&s;ibility of our
coming afterwards to any Terms again.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I kept a Couple of tru&s;ty Agents
&s;o near her, that I fail'd not to have a full Ac|count
of her Conduct, tho' I never let her know
any thing of me, but that I was gone over to
<HI>France;</HI> as to her Bills which &s;he &s;aid &s;he would
draw upon me, &s;he was as good as her Word in
drawing one of 30 <HI>l.</HI> which I refus'd to accept,
and never gave her leave to trouble me with
another.</P>
<P>IT is true, and I mu&s;t acknowledge it, that all
this was a very Melancholy Scene of Life to me,
and but that &s;he took Care by carrying her &s;elf
to the la&s;t Degree Provoking, and continually to
In&s;ult me; I cou'd never have gone on to the
parting, with &s;o much Re&s;olution, for I really
lov'd her very &s;incerely, and could have been
any thing but a Beggar, and a Cuckold with her,
but tho&s;e were intollerable to me, e&s;pecially, as
they were put upon me with &s;o much In&s;ult, and
Rudene&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT my Wife carried it at la&s;t to a Point that
made all things light and ea&s;y to me, for after a|bove
a Years Separation, and keeping &s;uch Com|pany
as &s;he thought fit, &s;he was pleas'd to be
with Child again, in which &s;he had, however, &s;o
much Hone&s;ty, as not to pretend that &s;he had had
any thing to do with me; what Wretched Life
&s;he led after this, and how &s;he brought her &s;elf
<PB N="254" REF="260">
to the utmo&s;t Extremity of Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s,
I may &s;peak of hereafter.</P>
<P>I had found &s;oon after our Parting, that I had
a great deal of Rea&s;on to put my &s;elf into a Po|&s;ture
at fir&s;t, not to be impos'd upon by her; for
I found very quickly that &s;he had run her &s;elf in|to
Debt in &s;everal Places very Con&s;iderably; and
that it was upon a Suppo&s;ition, that I was liable
to tho&s;e Debts: But I was gone, and it was Ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould do &s;o; upon which,
&s;he found her &s;elf oblig'd out of her wicked Gains,
however, whatever &s;he made of them to Di&s;charge
mo&s;t tho&s;e Debts her &s;elf.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as &s;he was deliver'd of her Child, in
which my Intelligence was &s;o good, that I had
gotten &s;ufficient Proof of it; I Sued her in the
Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Court, in order to obtain a Divorce,
and as &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to avoid it, &s;o &s;he
declin'd the Defence, and I gain'd a legal Decree,
<HI>or what they call it,</HI> of Divorce, in the u&s;ual time
of &s;uch Proce&s;s, and now I thought my &s;elf a
Freeman once again, and began to be Sick of
Wedlock, with all my Heart.</P>
<P>I liv'd retir'd, becau&s;e I knew &s;he had Con|tracted
Debts, which I &s;hould be oblig'd to Pay,
and I was re&s;olv'd to be gone out of her reach,
with what Speed I cou'd, but it was nece&s;&s;ary that
I &s;hould &s;tay till the <HI>Virginia</HI> Fleet came in; be|cau&s;e
I look'd for at lea&s;t 300 Hhds of <HI>Tobacco</HI>
from thence, which I knew would heal all my
Breaches; for indeed, the Extravagance of three
Years with this Lady, had &s;unk me mo&s;t effectu|ally;
even far beyond her own Fortune, which
was Con&s;iderable, tho' not quite 1500 <HI>l. as &s;he had
call'd it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="261">
BUT all the Mi&s;chiefs I met with on Ac|count
of this Match, were not over yet, for when
I had been parted with her about three Months,
and had refus'd to accept her Bill of 30 <HI>l.</HI> which
I mention'd above, tho' I was remov'd from my
fir&s;t Lodgings too, and thought I had effectually
&s;ecur'd my&s;elf from being found out, yet there
came a Gentleman well Dre&s;s'd to my Lodgings
one Day, and was let in before I knew of it,
or el&s;e I &s;hould &s;carce have admitted him.</P>
<P>HE was led into a Parlour, and I came down
to him in my Gown and Slippers; when I came
into the Room, he call'd me as familiary by my
Name, as if he had known me twenty Year, and
pulling out a Pocket-Book, he &s;hows me a Bill
upon me, drawn by my Wife, which was the &s;ame
Bill for thirty Pound that I had refus'd before.</P>
<P>SIR, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> this Bill has been pre&s;ented before,
and I gave my an&s;wer to it then.</P>
<P>ANSWER! Sir, <HI>&s;ays he, with a kind of jeering
taunting Air,</HI> I don't under&s;tand what you mean
by an an&s;wer, it is not a Que&s;tion Sir, it is a Bill
to be paid.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> it is a Bill, I know that, and
I gave my an&s;wer to it before.</P>
<P>SIR, Sir, &s;ays he, <HI>very &s;aucily,</HI> your An&s;wer,
there's no An&s;wer to a Bill, it mu&s;t be paid, Bills
are to be paid, not to be an&s;wered, they &s;ay you
are a Merchant, Sir, Merchants always pay their
Bills.</P>
<P>I begun to be angry too a little, but I did not
like my Man, for I found he began to be Quar|rel&s;ome;
however <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> Sir, I perceive you are
not much us'd to pre&s;enting Bills; Sir, a Bill is
always fir&s;t pre&s;ented, and pre&s;enting, is a Que&s;ti|on,
'tis asking if I will accept, or pay the Bill,
<PB N="256" REF="262">
and then whether I &s;ay yes, or no, 'tis an an&s;wer
one way, or other; after 'tis accepted, it indeed
requires no more an&s;wer but Payment when 'tis
due, if you plea&s;e to inform your&s;elf, this is
the u&s;age which all Merchants or Trad&s;emen of
any kind who have Bills drawn upon them, Act by.</P>
<P>WELL Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and what then? what is this
to the paying me the thirty Pounds?</P>
<P>WHY, Sir, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> it is this to it, that I told the
Per&s;on that brought it, I &s;hould not pay it.</P>
<P>NOT pay it, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but you &s;hall pay it; ay,
ay, you will pay it.</P>
<P>SHE that draws it, has no Rea&s;on to draw any
Bills upon me, I am &s;ure, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and I &s;hall pay
no Bills &s;he draws, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>UPON this he turns &s;hort upon me, Sir, &s;he
that draws this Bill is a Per&s;on of too much
Honour to draw any Bill without Rea&s;on, and
'tis an Affront to &s;ay &s;o of her, and I &s;hall expect
&s;atisfaction of you for that by it&s;elf, but fir&s;t
the Bill Sir, the Bill, you mu&s;t pay, the Bill, Sir.</P>
<P>I return'd as &s;hort, Sir, I Affront no Body, I
know the Per&s;on as well as you, I hope, and
what I have &s;aid of her, is no Affront, &s;he can
have no Rea&s;on to draw Bills upon me, for I
owe her nothing.</P>
<P>I omit intermingling the Oaths he lac'd his
Speech with, as too foul for my Paper, but he
told me he would make me know, &s;he had Friends
to &s;tand by her, that I had abus'd her, and he
would let me know it, and do her Ju&s;tice; but
fir&s;t, I mu&s;t pay his Bill.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd in &s;hort, I would not pay the Bill,
nor any Bills he &s;hould draw.</P>
<P>WITH that he &s;teps to the Door, and &s;huts it,
and &s;wore by G&mdash;d he would make me pay the
<PB N="257" REF="263">
Bill before we parted, and laid his Hand upon
his Sword, but did not draw it out.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was frighted to the la&s;t degree, for I
had no Sword, and if I had, I mu&s;t own that tho' I
had learn'd a great many good things in <HI>France</HI> to
make me look like a Gentleman; I had forgot
the main Article, of learning, how to u&s;e a Sword,
a thing &s;o univer&s;ally practis'd there; and to &s;ay
more, I had been perfectly unacquainted with
Quarrels of this Nature; &s;o that I was perfectly
&s;urpris'd when he &s;hut the Door, and knew not
what to &s;ay or do.</P>
<P>HOWEVER as it happen'd, the People of the
Hou&s;e hearing us pretty loud, came near the
Door, and made a Noi&s;e in the Entry, to let me
know they were at Hand, and one of the Servants
going to open the Door, and finding it lock'd,
call'd out to me, <HI>Sir, for God&s;ake open the Door,</HI>
What is the matter? <HI>Shall we fetch a Con&s;table?</HI>
I made no An&s;wer, but it gave me Courage,
&s;o I &s;at down compos'd, in one of the Chairs,
and &s;aid to him, Sir, this is not the way to
make me pay the Bill, you had much better be
ea&s;y, and take your &s;atisfaction another way.</P>
<P>HE under&s;tood me of Fighting, which upon
my Word, was not in my Thoughts, but I meant
that he had better take his Cour&s;e at Law.</P>
<P>WITH all my heart, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> they &s;ay, you are
a Gentleman, and they call you Colonel; now
if you are a Gentleman, I accept your Chal|lenge,
Sir, and if you will walk out with me I'll
take it for full payment of the Bill, and will de|cide
it as Gentlemen ought to do.</P>
<P>I Challenge you, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> not I, I made no
Challenge, I &s;aid, this is not the way to make me
pay a Bill, that I have not accepted, <HI>that is,</HI> that
you had better &s;eek your &s;atisfaction at Law.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="264">
LAW! <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> Law! Gentleman's Law is
my Law; in &s;hort, Sir, you &s;hall pay me, or
Fight me; and then, as if he had mi&s;taken, he
turns &s;hort upon me; nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you &s;hall both
Fight me and pay me, for I will maintain her Ho|nour;
and in &s;aying this, he be&s;tow'd about &s;ix
or &s;even Damme's and Oaths, by way of Paren|the&s;is.</P>
<P>THIS interval deliver'd me effectually, for
ju&s;t as the Word <HI>fight me,</HI> for I will maintain her
Honour, the Maid had brought in a Con&s;table
with three or four Neighbours to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>HE heard them come in, and began to be a
little in a Rage, and ask'd if I intended to Mob
him, in&s;tead of paying, and laying his Hand on
his Sword told me, if any Man offered to break
in upon him, he would run me thro' the fir&s;t
Moment, that he might have the fewer to deal
with afterwards.</P>
<P>I told him he knew I had call'd for no help, be|lieving
he could not be in earne&s;t in what he
had &s;aid, and that if any Body attempted to
come in upon us, it was to prevent the Mi&s;chief
he Threaten'd, and which he might &s;ee I had no
Weapons to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>UPON this the Con&s;table call'd, and charg'd
us both in the King's Name to open the Door, I
was &s;itting in a Chair, and offer'd to ri&s;e, he
made a Motion, as if he would draw, upon which
I &s;at down again, and the Door not being open'd,
the Con&s;table &s;et his Foot again&s;t it and came in</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, <HI>&s;ays my Gentleman,</HI> And what now?

which is one of the wor&s;t of Men in the
World to Encounter with, for being in a Fury I
threw my Head in his Face, and Clo&s;ing with
him, threw him fairly on his Back, by main
Stength, and had not the Con&s;table &s;tep'd in, and
taken me off, I had certainly &s;tamp'd him to
Death, with my Feet, for my Blood was now all
in a Flame, and the People of the Hou&s;e were
frighted now as much the other way, lea&s;t I &s;hould
kill him, tho' I had no Weapon at all in my
Hand.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;table too reprov'd me in his turn,
but I &s;aid to him, Mr. <HI>Con&s;table,</HI> don't you think
I am &s;ufficiently Provok'd? Can any Man bear
&s;uch things as the&s;e, I de&s;ire to know who this
Man is, and who &s;ent him hither?</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="266">
I am, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> a Gentleman, and come with a
Bill to him for Money, and he refu&s;es to Pay it;
well, &s;ays the <HI>Con&s;table,</HI> very Prudently, that's
none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, I am no Ju&s;tice of Peace to
hear the Cau&s;e, be that among your &s;elves; but
keep your Hands off one another, and that's as
much as I de&s;ire; and therefore, Sir, &s;ays the <HI>Con|&s;table</HI>
to him, if I may advi&s;e you, &s;eeing he will
not Pay the Bill, and that mu&s;t be Decided be|tween
you as the Law directs, I would have you
leave it for the pre&s;ent, and go quietly away.</P>
<P>HE made many Impertinent Harangues about
the Bill, and in&s;i&s;ted, that it was drawn by my
own Wife; I &s;aid angrily, then it was drawn by a
Whore, he Bullied me upon that, told me I dur&s;t
not tell him &s;o any where el&s;e; and I an&s;wer'd,
I would very &s;oon Publi&s;h her for a Whore to all
the World, and Cry her down, and thus we &s;colded
for near half an Hour, for I took Courage when
the <HI>Con&s;table</HI> was there, for I knew that he would
keep us from Fighting, which indeed I had no
Mind to, and &s;o at length I got Rid of him.</P>
<P>I was heartily vext at this Rencounter, and
the more, becau&s;e I had been found out in my
Lodging, which I thought I had effectually Con|ceal'd:
However, I re&s;olv'd to remove the next
Day, and in the mean time I kept within Doors
all that Day till the Evening, and then I went
out in order not to return thither any more.</P>
<P>BEING come out into <HI>Grace-church-&s;treet,</HI> I ob|&s;erv'd
a Man follow'd me, with one of his Legs tied
up in a String, and Hopping along with the other,
and two Crutches; he begg'd for a Farthing, but
I inclining not to give him any thing, the Fellow
follow'd me &s;till, till I came to a Court, when I an|&s;wer'd
ha&s;tily to him, I have not for you, pray
<PB N="261" REF="267">
don't be &s;o trouble&s;ome; with which Words he
knock'd me down with one of his Crutches.</P>
<P>BEING &s;tunn'd with the blow I knew nothing
what was done to me afterwards; but coming to
my&s;elf again, I found I was wounded very fright|fully
in &s;everal Places, and that among the re&s;t
my No&s;e was &s;lit upwards, one of my Ears cut
almo&s;t off, and a great cut with a Sword on the
Side of my Forehead, al&s;o a &s;tab into the Body,
tho' not Dangerous.</P>
<P>WHO had been near me, or &s;tuck me, be&s;ides
the Cripple that &s;truck me with his Crutch I
knew not, nor do I know to this Hour, but I was
terribly wounded, and lay bleeding on the Ground,
&s;ometime, till coming to my&s;elf I got &s;trength to
cry out for help, and People coming about me,
I got &s;ome Hands to carry me to my Lodging,
where I lay by it more than two Months, before
I was well enough to go out of Doors, and when I
did go out, I had Rea&s;on to believe that I was
waited for by &s;ome Rogues, who watch'd an op|portunity
to repeat the injury I had met with
before.</P>
<P>THIS made me very unea&s;ie, and I re&s;olv'd
to get my&s;elf out of Danger, if po&s;&s;ible, and to
go over to <HI>France,</HI> or home, <HI>as I call'd it,</HI> to <HI>Vir|ginia;</HI>
&s;o to be out of the way of Villains, and
A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations; for every time I &s;tirr'd out here, I
thought I went in danger of my Life, and there|fore,
as before I went out at Night, thinking to
be conceal'd; &s;o now I never went out, but in
open Day that I might be &s;afe, and never with|out
one or two Servants to be my Life Guard.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t do my Wife a peice of Ju&s;tice
here too, and that was that hearing of what had
befallen me &s;he wrote me a Letter, in which
<PB N="262" REF="268">
&s;he treated me more Decently than &s;he had been
wont to do, &s;aid &s;he was very &s;orry to hear how I
had been u&s;ed, and the rather becau&s;e &s;he under|&s;tood
it was on pre&s;enting her Bill to me; &s;he
&s;aid &s;he hop'd I could not in my wor&s;t Di&s;po&s;i|tions
think &s;o hardly of her, as to believe it was
done by her Knowledge, or Con&s;ent, much le&s;s by
her Order, or Direction; that &s;he abhorr'd &s;uch
things, and Prote&s;ted if &s;he had the lea&s;t Know|ledge,
or &s;o much as a gue&s;s at the Villains con|cern'd
&s;he would Di&s;cover them to me; &s;he let me
know the Per&s;ons Name to whom &s;he gave the
Bill, and where he liv'd, and left it to me to o|blige
him to di&s;cover the Per&s;on who had brought
it and us'd me &s;o ill, and wi&s;h'd I might find him,
and bring him to Ju&s;tice, and have him puni&s;h'd
with the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the Law.</P>
<P>I TOOK this &s;o kindly of my Wife, that I
think in my Con&s;cience, had &s;he come after it
her&s;elf, to &s;ee how I did, I had certainly taken her
again; but &s;he &s;atisfy'd her&s;elf with the Civility
of another Letter, and de&s;iring me to let her
know as often as I could how I was, adding, that
it would be infinitely to her &s;atisfaction to hear I
was recover'd of the hurt I had receiv'd, and that
he was hang'd at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> who had done it.</P>
<P>SHE us'd &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;ignifying as I un|der&s;tood
them, her Affliction at our parting, and
her continu'd Re&s;pect for me, but did not make
any Motion towards returning; then &s;he us'd
&s;ome Arguments, to move me to pay her Bills, in|timating
that &s;he had brought me a large For|tune,
and now had nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, which was
very &s;evere.</P>
<P>I Wrote her an An&s;wer to this Letter, tho' I had
not to the other, letting her know how I had been
<PB N="263" REF="269">
us'd, that I was &s;atisfied upon her Letter, that
&s;he had no hand in it; that it was not in her Na|ture
to treat me &s;o, who had never injur'd her,
us'd any Violence with her, or been the Cau&s;e,
or de&s;ire of our parting; that as to her Bill, &s;he
could not but know how much her Expen&s;ive
way of living, had &s;traitn'd, and reduc'd me, and
would if continu'd have ruin'd me, that &s;he had
in le&s;s than three Years &s;pent more than as much
as &s;he brought to me, and would not abate her
Expen&s;ive way tho' calmly intreated by me, with
Prote&s;tations, that I could not Support &s;o great
an Expence, but Cho&s;e rather to break up her
Family, and go from me, than to re&s;train her|&s;elf
to rea&s;onable Limits, tho' I u&s;ed no Violence
with her, but Entreaties, and earne&s;t Per&s;wa&s;ions,
back'd with good Rea&s;ons; letting her know how
my E&s;tate was, and convincing her that it mu&s;t
reduce us to Poverty at lea&s;t; that however, if
&s;he would recal her Bill, I would &s;end her 30 <HI>l.</HI>
which was the Sum mention'd in her Bill, and ac|cording
to my Ability would not let her want,
if &s;he pleas'd to live within due Bounds; but
then I let her know al&s;o, that I had a very bad Ac|count
of her Conduct, and that &s;he kept Company
with a &s;candalous Fellow, who I Nam'd to her;
that I was loth to believe &s;uch things of her, but
that to put an entire End to the Report, and Re|&s;tore
her Reputation; I let her know that &s;till
after all I had heard, if &s;he would re&s;olve to
live without Re&s;traints, within the rea&s;onable
Bounds of my Capacity, and Treat me with the
&s;ame Kindne&s;s and Affection, and Tenderne&s;s, as
I always had Treated her, and ever would: I
was willing to receive her again, and would for|get
all that was pa&s;t; but that if &s;he declin'd
<PB N="264" REF="270">
me now, it would be for ever, for if &s;he did not
accept my offer, I was re&s;olv'd to &s;tay here no
longer, where I had been &s;o ill Treated on many
Occa&s;ions; but was preparing to go into my own
Country, where I would &s;pend my Days in Quiet,
and in a Retreat from the World.</P>
<P>SHE did not give &s;uch an An&s;wer to this, as I
expected; for tho' &s;he thank'd me for the 30 <HI>l.</HI>
yet &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon her Ju&s;tification in all other
Points, and tho' &s;he did not refu&s;e to return to
me, yet &s;he did not &s;ay &s;he Accepted it, and in
&s;hort, &s;aid little or nothing to it, only a kind of
Claim to a Reparation of her Injur'd Reputation,
<HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gave me &s;ome Surprize at fir&s;t, for I thought
indeed, any Woman in her Circum&s;tances would
have been very willing to have put an End to all
her Mi&s;eries, and to the Reproach that was upon
her, by a Reconciliation; e&s;pecially, con&s;idering
&s;he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at that time, but very meanly: But
there was a particular Rea&s;on, which prevented
her return, and which &s;he cou'd not Plead to
me in her Letter, yet was a good Rea&s;on again&s;t
accepting an offer, which &s;he would otherwi&s;e
have been glad of, and this was that, as I have
mention'd above, &s;he had fallen into bad Com|pany,
and had pro&s;tituted her Vertue to &s;ome of
her Flatterers, and in &s;hort, was with Child; &s;o
that &s;he dur&s;t not venture to accept my offer.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as I ob&s;erve above, &s;he did not ab|&s;olutely
refu&s;e it, intending (as I under&s;tood af|terward,)
to keep the Treaty of it on Foot, till
&s;he could Drop her Burthen, as &s;he had call'd it
before; and having been deliver'd privately,
have accepted my Propo&s;al afterward: And in|deed,
this was the mo&s;t Prudent &s;tep &s;he cou'd
<PB N="265" REF="271">
take, or, as we may &s;ay, the only &s;tep &s;he had
le&s;t to take: But I was too many for her here too,
my Intelligence about her was too good, for her to
Conceal &s;uch an Affair from me, unle&s;s &s;he had
gone away before &s;he was vi&s;ibly Big, and unle&s;s
&s;he had gone farther off too than &s;he did, for I
had an Account to a Tittle, of the time when-and
Place where, and the Creature of which &s;he
was deliver'd, and then my Offers of taking her a|gain
were at an End, tho' &s;he Wrote me &s;everal
very Penitent Letters, acknowledging her Crime,
and begging me to forgive her; but my Spirit
was above all that now, nor cou'd I ever bear the
Thoughts of her after that: But per&s;ued a Di|vorce,
and accordingly obtain'd it, as I have men|tion'd
already.</P>
<P>THINGS being at this pa&s;s, I re&s;olv'd, as I
have ob&s;erv'd above, to go over to <HI>France,</HI> after
I had receiv'd my Effects from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and ac|cordingly
I came to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in the Year&mdash;and
here I fell into Company with &s;ome <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
Officers of the Regiment of <HI>Dillon,</HI> who by little
and little Enter'd me into the Army, and by the
help of Lieutenant General&mdash;an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> and
&s;ome Money, I obtain'd a Company in his Regi|ment,
and &s;o went into the Army directly.</P>
<P>I was exceedingly pleas'd with my new Cir|cum&s;tances,
and now I us'd to &s;ay to my &s;elf, I
was come to what I was Born to, and that I had
never till now liv'd the Life of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>OUR Regiment, after I had been &s;ome time in
it, was Commanded into <HI>Italy,</HI> and one of the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Actions that I was in, was the
Famous Attack upon <HI>Cremona,</HI> in the <HI>Millane&s;e,</HI>
where the <HI>Germans</HI> being Privately, and by
Treachery let into the Town in the Night, thro'
<PB N="266" REF="272">
a kind of Common-Shoar, &s;urpriz'd the Town,
and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t Part of it, &s;ur|prizing
the Mare&s;chal Duke <HI>de Villeroy,</HI> and ta|king
him Pri&s;oner as he came out of his Quarters,
and beating the few <HI>French</HI> Troops, which were
left, into the Citadel: But were in the middle of
their Victory &s;o boldly, and re&s;olutely attack'd
by two <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiments, who were Quarter'd in the
<HI>Street</HI> leading to the River <HI>Po,</HI> and who kept Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Water-Gate, or <HI>Po</HI> Gate of the Town,
by which the <HI>German</HI> Reinforcements &s;hould
have come in, that after a mo&s;t de&s;perate Fight,
the <HI>Germans</HI> had their Victory wrung out of their
Hands, and not being able to break thro' us to let
in their Friends, were oblig'd at length to quit the
Town again, to the eternal Honour of tho&s;e <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
Regiments, and indeed of their whole Nation, and
for which we had a very hand&s;ome Compliment
from the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>I NOW had the &s;atisfaction of knowing, and
that for the fir&s;t time too, that I was not that
cowardly low &s;pirited Wretch, that I was, when
the Fellow Bullied me in my Lodgings, about
the Bill of 30 <HI>l.</HI> had he attack'd me now, tho' in
the very &s;ame Condition, I &s;hould naked and
unarm'd as I was have flown in the Face of him,
and trampl'd him under my Feet; but Men never
know them&s;elves till they are tried, and Cou|rage
is acquir'd by time, and Experience of
things.</P>
<P><HI>Philip de Comines,</HI> tells us, that after the Bat|tle
of <HI>Monteleri,</HI> the Count de <HI>Charolois,</HI> who till
then had an utter Aver&s;ion to the War, and ab|horr'd
it, and every thing that belong'd to it,
was &s;o chang'd by the Glory he obtain'd in that
Action, and by the Flattery of tho&s;e about him, that
<PB N="267" REF="273">
afterwards, the Army was his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the
Fateigues of the War his chief Delight, 'tis too great
an Example for me to bring in my own Ca&s;e, but
&s;o it was, that they Flattered me &s;o with my bra|very
as they call'd it on the Occa&s;ion of this
Action, that I fancy'd my&s;elf Brave, whether I
was &s;o or not, and the Pride of it made me Bold,
and Daring to the la&s;t Degree on all Occa&s;ions;
but what added to it, was, that &s;ome Body gave
a particular Account to the Court of my being In|&s;trumental
to the &s;aving the City and the whole
<HI>Cremone&s;e,</HI> by my extraordinary Defence of the <HI>Po</HI>
Gate, and by my Managing that Defence after
the Lieutenant Colonel, who Commanded the Par|ty
where I was Po&s;ted was kill'd; upon which,
the King &s;ent me a publick Te&s;timony of his
accepting my Service, and &s;ent me a Breviat
to be a Lieutenant Colonel, and the next Courier
brought me actually a Commi&s;&s;ion for Lieute|nant
Colonel in the Regiment of&mdash;.</P>
<P>I WAS in &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes and petty En|counters
before this, by which I gain'd the Repu|tation
of a good Officer, but I happen'd to be in
&s;ome particular Po&s;ts too, by which I got &s;ome|what
that I lik'd much better, and that was a good
deal of Money.</P>
<P>OUR Regiment was &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Italy</HI>
by Sea, we embark'd at <HI>Thoulon,</HI> and Landed at
<HI>Savona</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and march'd
from thence to the Dutchy of <HI>Millan:</HI> At
the fir&s;t Town we were &s;ent to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of, which was <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the Citizens ro&s;e upon
our Men in a mo&s;t furious manner, and drove the
whole Garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted of 800 Men, that
is <HI>French,</HI> and Soldiers in the <HI>French</HI> Service quite
out of the Town.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="274">
I was Quarter'd in a Burghers Hou&s;e, ju&s;t by one
of the Ports with Eight of my Men, and a Servant;
where calling a &s;hort Council with my Men, we
re&s;olv'd to maintain the Hou&s;e we was in, what|ever
it Co&s;t, till we receiv'd Order to quit it from
the Commanding Officer; and upon this, when I
&s;aw our Men cou'd not &s;tand their Ground in the
Street, being pre&s;s'd hard by the Citizens, I
turn'd out of Doors all the Family, and kept the
Hou&s;e, as a Ca&s;tle which I was Governor in; and
as the Hou&s;e join'd to the City Gate, I re&s;olv'd
to maintain it, &s;o as to be the la&s;t that &s;hould
quit the Place, my own Retreat being &s;ecur'd by
being &s;o near the Port.</P>
<P>HAVING thus emptyed the Hou&s;e of the Inha|bitants,
we made no Scruple of filling our Pock|ets
with whatever we could find there, in a Word,
we left nothing we could carry away; among
which, it came to my Lot to Dip into the Bur|ghers
Cabinet, who&s;e Hou&s;e it was where we were;
and there I took about the Quantity of 200 Pi|&s;tols
in Money and Plate, and other things of Va|lue.
There was great Complaint made to Prince
<HI>Vaudemont,</HI> who was then Governor of the <HI>Milla|ne&s;e</HI>
of this Violence; but as the Repul&s;e the Ci|tizens
gave us, was contrary to his Order, and to
the general De&s;ign of the Prince, who was then
wholy in the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Philip,</HI> the Citizens
cou'd obtain nothing, and I found, that if we had
Plunder'd the whole City, it would have been the
&s;ame thing; for the Governor had Order to take
our Regiment in, and it was an Act of open Re|bellion
to re&s;i&s;t us as they did; however, we had
orders not to Fire upon the Burghers, unle&s;s con|&s;train'd
to it by evident Nece&s;&s;ity, and we rather
cho&s;e to quit the Place, as we did, then Di&s;pute it
<PB N="269" REF="275">
with a De&s;perate Body of Fellows, who wanted
no Advantage of us, except only that, of having
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two Ba&s;tions, and one Port for our
Retreat; fir&s;t they were Treble our Number, for
the Burghers being join'd by &s;even Companies of
the regular Troops, made up above 1600 Men,
be&s;ides Rabble which was many more; whereas,
we were about 800 in all; they al&s;o had the Cit|tadel
and &s;everal Peices of Cannon, &s;o that we
cou'd have made nothing of it, if we had attack'd
them; but they &s;ubmitted three or four Days af|ter
to other Forces, the Soldiers within turning
upon them, and taking the Cittadel from them.</P>
<P>AFTER this, we lay &s;till in Quarters 8 Months,
for the Prince having &s;ecur'd the whole <HI>Millane&s;e</HI>
for King <HI>Philip,</HI> and no Enemy appearing for
&s;ome time, had nothing to do, but to receive the
Auxiliar Troops of <HI>France;</HI> and as they came,
extend him&s;elf every way as he cou'd, in order
to keep the Imperiali&s;ts (who were preparing to
fall into <HI>Italy</HI> with a great Army) as much at a
Di&s;tance as po&s;&s;ible, which he did, by taking
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and of mo&s;t of
the Towns on that Side, as far as the Lake <HI>dela
Guarda,</HI> and the River <HI>Addige.</HI></P>
<P>WE lay in <HI>Mantua</HI> &s;ome time, but were after|wards
drawn out by Order of the Count <HI>de Te&s;&s;e,</HI>
(afterwards Mar&s;hal of <HI>France</HI>) to Form the <HI>French</HI>
Army, till the Arrival of the Duke <HI>de Vando&s;me,</HI>
who was to Command in Chief. Here we had a
Severe Campaign, <HI>Anno</HI> 1701. having Prince
<HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and an Army of 40000 <HI>Germans,</HI>
all old Soldiers to deal with, and tho' the <HI>French</HI>
Army was more Numerous than the Enemy,
by 25000 Men, yet being on the Defen&s;ive,
and having &s;o many Po&s;ts to Cover, not know|ing
<PB N="270" REF="276">
exactly where the Prince of <HI>Savoy,</HI> who com|manded
the Imperial Army would attack us; it
oblig'd the <HI>French</HI> to keep their Troops &s;o divided;
and &s;o remote from one another, that the <HI>Ger|mans</HI>
pu&s;h'd on their De&s;ign with great Succe&s;s as
the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times more fully relate.</P>
<P>I WAS at the Action at <HI>Carpi, July</HI> 1701,
where we were wor&s;ted by the <HI>Germans</HI> indeed,
were forc'd to quit our Encampment, and give
up to the Prince the whole River of <HI>Addige,</HI> and
where our Regiment &s;u&s;tain'd &s;ome Lo&s;s, but
the Enemies got little by us, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Cati|nate,</HI>
who Commanded at that time drew up in or|der
of Battle the next Day in &s;ight of the <HI>German</HI>
Army, and gave them a defiance, but they would
not &s;tir, tho' we offer'd them Battle two Days
together, for having gain'd the Pa&s;&s;age over the
<HI>Addige,</HI> by our quitting <HI>Rivoli,</HI> which was then
u&s;ele&s;s to us their Bu&s;ine&s;s was done.</P>
<P>FINDING they declin'd a dece&s;ive Action, our
Generals pre&s;s'd them in their Quarters, and
made them fight for every Inch of Ground they
gain'd, and at length in the <HI>September</HI> following, we
attack'd them in their entrench'd Po&s;ts of <HI>Chiar,</HI>
here we broke into the very heart of their Camp,
where we made a very terrible Slaughter, but
I know not by what Mi&s;take among our Ge|nerals,
or Defect in the Execution of their
Orders, the Brigade of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and our <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
Brigade, who had &s;o Bravely enter'd the <HI>Ger|man</HI>
Intrenchments were not &s;upported as we
&s;hould have been, &s;o that we were oblig'd to &s;u&s;|tain
the &s;hock of the whole <HI>German</HI> Army, and
at la&s;t to quit the Advantage we had gain'd, and
that not without Lo&s;s, but being timely reinforc'd
by a great Body of Hor&s;e the Enemy were in
<PB N="271" REF="277">
their Turn beaten off too, and driven back into
their very Camp: The <HI>Germans</HI> boa&s;ted of having
a great Victory here, and indeed in repul&s;ing us
after we had gain'd their Camp they had the ad|vantage,
but had Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Te&s;&s;e</HI> &s;uccoured us
in time, as old <HI>Catinat</HI> &s;aid he ought to have
done, with 12000 Foot which he had with him,
that Days Action had put an End to the War, and
Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> mu&s;t have been glad to have gone
back to <HI>Germany</HI> in more ha&s;t than he came, if
perhaps we had not cut him &s;hort by the way.</P>
<P>BUT the Fate of things went another way,
and the <HI>Germans</HI> continu'd all that Campaign to
pu&s;h forward, and advance one Po&s;t after another,
till they beat us quite out of the <HI>Millane&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THE latter part of this Campaign we made
only a party War, the <HI>French</HI> according to their
volatile Temper, being every Day abroad, ei|ther
Forraging or &s;urprizing the Enemies fo|ragers,
plundering, or circumventing the Plunders
of the other Side, and that tho' they very often
come &s;hort home; for the <HI>Germans</HI> had the better
of them on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, and indeed &s;o many
lo&s;t their lives upon tho&s;e petty Encounters, that
I think including tho&s;e who dyed of Di&s;tempers
gotten by hard Service, and bad Quarters, lying
in the Field, even till the middle of <HI>Decem|ber,</HI>
among Rivers, and Bogs in a Country &s;o
full of Canals and Rivers, as that Part of <HI>Italy</HI>
is known to be, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> we lo&s;t more Men, and &s;o
did the Enemy al&s;o, than would have been lo&s;t in
a general deci&s;ive Battle.</P>
<P>THE Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> to give him his due,
pre&s;s'd earne&s;tly to put it to a Day, and come
to a Battle with Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> but the Duke
<HI>de Villeroy,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Catinate,</HI> and the Count <HI>de
<PB N="272" REF="278">
Te&s;&s;e</HI> were all again&s;t it, and the principal Rea|&s;on
was, that they knew the weakne&s;s of the
Troops, who had &s;uffer'd &s;o much on &s;o many Oc|ca&s;ions,
that they were in no Condition to give
Battle to the <HI>Germans;</HI> &s;o after, as <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> about
three Months Harra&s;&s;ing one another with Par|ties
we went into Winter Quarters.</P>
<P>BEFORE we march'd out of the Field, our Re|giment
with a Detachment of Dragoons of 600,
and about 250 Hor&s;e went without a De&s;ign to in|tercept
Prince <HI>Commercy,</HI> a General of Note under
Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy;</HI> the Detachment was
intended to be only Hor&s;e and Dragoons, but be|cau&s;e
it was the Imperiali&s;ts good luck to beat
many of our Parties, and as was given out, many
more than we beat of theirs; and becau&s;e it was
believed that the Prince, who was an Officer of
good Note among them would not go abroad, but
in very Company; the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiment of Foot
was order'd to be added, that if po&s;&s;ible they
might meet with their Match.</P>
<P>I WAS commanded about two Hours before, to
pa&s;s about 200 Foot, and 50 Dragoons, at a &s;mall
Wood, where our General had intelligence that
Prince would Po&s;t &s;ome Men, to &s;ecure his Pa&s;|&s;age,
which accordingly I did; but Count <HI>Te&s;&s;e</HI>
not thinking our Party &s;trong enough, had
march'd him&s;elf with a Thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and 300
Grenadiers to Support us, and it was very well he
did &s;o; for Prince <HI>Commercy</HI> having Intelligence of
the fir&s;t Party, came forward &s;ooner than they
expected, and fell upon them, and had entirely
Routed them, had not the Count hearing the
firing, advanc'd with the Thou&s;and Hor&s;e he had
with &s;uch Expedition, as to &s;upport his Men in
the very heat of the Action, by which means the
<PB N="273" REF="279">
<HI>Germans</HI> were defeated, and forc'd to retire, but
the Prince made a pretty good Retreat, and af|ter
the Action came on to the Wood, where I was
po&s;ted, but the &s;urpri&s;e of his Defeat had pre|vented
his &s;ending a Deteachment to &s;ecure the
Pa&s;s at the Wood, as he intended.</P>
<P>THE Count <HI>de Te&s;&s;e,</HI> under&s;tanding that we
were &s;ent, <HI>as above,</HI> to the Wood, follow'd them
clo&s;e at the Heels to prevent our being cut off,
and if it were po&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould give them
any Check at the Wood, to fall in, and have
another Bru&s;h with them; it was near Night be|fore
they came to the Wood, by which means
they could not di&s;cern our Number, but when
they came up to the Wood, 50 Dragoons ad|vanc'd
to di&s;cover the Pa&s;s, and &s;ee if all was
clear: The&s;e we &s;uffer'd to pa&s;s a great way in|to
the Defile, or Lane, that went thro' the
Wood, and then clapping in between them, and
the Enterance, cut off their Retreat &s;o effectu|ally,
that when they di&s;cover'd us, and fir'd,
they were in&s;tantly &s;urrounded and cut in peices;
the Officer who commanded them, and eight
Dragoons only being made Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THIS made the Prince halt, not knowing what
the Ca&s;e was, or how &s;trong we were, and to
get better Intelligence, &s;ent 200 Hor&s;e to &s;ur|round
or Skirt the Wood, and beat up our Quar|ter,
and in the intrim, the Count <HI>de Te&s;&s;e</HI> appear'd,
in his Rear: We found the &s;trait he was in, by the
Noi&s;e of our own Troops at a Di&s;tance, &s;o we
re&s;olv'd to Engage the 200 Hor&s;e immediately;
accordingly our little Troop of Hor&s;e drew up
in the Entrance of the Lane, and offer'd to Skir|mi&s;h,
and our Foot lying behind the Hedge,
which went round the Wood, &s;tood ready to act
<PB N="274" REF="280">
as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer, the Hor&s;e being attack'd
gave way, and retir'd into the Lane, but the
<HI>Germans</HI> were too old for us there, they content|ed
them&s;elves to $u$h us to the Enterance,
but would not be drawn into a narrow Pa&s;s
without knowing whether the Hedges were Lin'd
or no.</P>
<P>BUT the Prince finding the <HI>French</HI> in his
Rear, and not being &s;trong enough to Engage a|gain,
re&s;olv'd to force his way thro', and com|manded
his Dragoons to alight, and enter the
Wood to clear the Hedges on either Side the
Lane, that he might pa&s;s with his Cavalry; this
they did &s;o vigorou&s;ly, and were &s;o much too
&s;trong for us, that tho' we made good our Ground a
long time, yet our Men were almo&s;t half of them
cut in peices. However, we gave time to the
<HI>French</HI> Cavalry to come up, and to fall on the
the Prince's Troops, and cut them off, and take
a great many Pri&s;oners, and then retreated in our
Turn, opening a Gap for our own Hor&s;e to break
in; 300 of the Dragoons were kill'd, and 200 of
them taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t heat of this Action, a <HI>German</HI> Of|ficer
of Dragoons well follow'd, had knock'd
down three of my Men that &s;tood next me, and
offering me Quarter, I was oblig'd to accept it,
and gave him my Sword, for our Men were up|on
the Point of quitting their Po&s;t, and &s;hifting
every one as they could; but the Scale was turn'd,
for our Cavalry breaking in, <HI>as above,</HI> the Dragoons
went to wreck, and the Officer who had me Pri|&s;oner,
turning to me &s;aid, <HI>we are all Lo&s;t;</HI> I ask|ed
him if I could &s;erve him, &s;tand &s;till a little,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> for his Men fought mo&s;t de&s;perately in|deed,
but about 200 <HI>French</HI> Hor&s;e appearing in
<PB N="275" REF="281">
his Rear too, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> to me in <HI>French,</HI> I will be
your Pri&s;oner, and returning me my Sword, gave
me al&s;o his own; a Dragoon that &s;tood near him
was ju&s;t going to do the like when he was &s;hot
dead, and the Hor&s;e coming up, the Field was
cleared in an In&s;tant, but Prince <HI>Commercy</HI> went
off with the re&s;t of his Party, and was pur&s;ued
no farther.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen of our Men
releas'd, as I was from being taken; but they
had not the luck I had, to take the Officer that
had them in keeping; he had been &s;o generous to
me, as not to ask what Money I had about me,
tho' I had not much, if he had; but I lo&s;t by his
Civility, for then I could not have the A&s;&s;urance
to ask him for his Money, tho' I under&s;tood he had
near a 100 Pi&s;tols about him; but he very hand|&s;omely
at Night, when we came to our Tents
made me a Pre&s;ent of 20 Pi&s;tols, and in return
I obtain'd leave for him to go to Prince <HI>Eugen</HI>'s
Camp upon his Parole, which he did, and &s;o got
him&s;elf exchang'd.</P>
<P>IT was after this Campaign that I was Quar|tered
at <HI>Cremona,</HI> when the Action happen'd
there, of which I have &s;poken already, and where
our <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiment did &s;uch Service, that they
&s;av'd the Town from being really &s;urpriz'd, and
indeed beat the <HI>Germans</HI> out again after they had
been Ma&s;ters of three Quarters of the Town
&s;ix Hours, and by which they gain'd a very great
Reputation.</P>
<P>BUT I ha&s;ten on to my own Hi&s;tory, for I
am not writing a Journal of the Wars, in which
I had no long Share.</P>
<P>THE Summer after this, our two <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiments
were drawn out into the Field, and had many a
<PB N="276" REF="282">
$ore Bru&s;h with the <HI>Germans,</HI> for Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI>
a vigilant General, gave us little Re&s;t, and gain'd
many Advantages by his continual moving up
and down, Harra&s;&s;ing his own Men, and ours
too; and whoever will do the <HI>French</HI> Ju&s;tice, and
knew how they had behaved, mu&s;t ackowledge,
they never declin'd the <HI>Germans,</HI> but fought them
upon all Occa&s;ions, with the utmo&s;t Re&s;olution
and Courage, and tho' it co&s;t the Blood of an in|finite
Number of fine Gentlemen, as well as
private Soldiers, yet the Duke <HI>de Vendome,</HI> who
now Commanded, tho' King <HI>Philip</HI> was him&s;elf
in the Army this Campaign, made the Prince of
<HI>Savoy</HI> a full return in his own kind, and drove
him from Po&s;t to Po&s;t, till he was ju&s;t at the
Point of quitting the whole Country of <HI>Italy;</HI>
all that gallant Army Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> brought
with him into <HI>Italy,</HI> which was the be&s;t without
doubt, for the goodne&s;s of the Troops that ever
were there, laid their Bones in that Country, and
many Thou&s;ands more after them; till the Affairs
of <HI>France</HI> declining in other Places, they were
forc'd in their Turn to give way to their Fate, as
may be &s;een in the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times, <HI>as
above,</HI> but 'tis none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE part that I bore in the&s;e Affairs was but
&s;hort and &s;harp, we took the Field about the be|ginning
of <HI>July</HI> 1702, and the Duke <HI>de Vendome</HI>
order'd the whole Army to draw the &s;ooner toge|ther,
in order to relieve the City of <HI>Mantua,</HI>
which was block'd up by the Imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Eugene</HI> was a Politick, and indeed a
fortunate Prince, and had the Year before pu&s;h|ed
our Army upon many Occa&s;ions; but his good
Fortune began to fail him a little this Year, for
our Army was not only more Numerous than his,
<PB N="277" REF="283">
but the Duke was in the Field before him, and
as the Prince had held <HI>Mantua</HI> clo&s;ely block'd up
all the Winter, the Duke re&s;olv'd to relieve the
Town, co&s;t what it would: As <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> the Duke
was fir&s;t in the Field, the Prince was in no Con|dition
to prevent his rai&s;ing the Blockade by force;
&s;o he drew off his Troops, and leaving &s;everal
&s;trong Bodies of Troops to protect <HI>Ber&s;ello,</HI> which
the Duke <HI>de Vendom&s;e</HI> threaten'd, and <HI>Borgofort,</HI>
where his Magazine lay, he drew all the re&s;t of
his Forces together, to make Head again&s;t us; by
this time the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> was come into the
Army, and the Duke <HI>de Vendom&s;e</HI> lay, with about
35000 Men, near <HI>Luzara,</HI> which he had re&s;olv'd
to attack, to bring Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> to a Battle:
The Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> lay Entrench'd with
20000 more at <HI>Rivalto,</HI> behind <HI>Mantua,</HI> to cover
the Frontiers of <HI>Millan,</HI> and there was near 12000
in <HI>Mantua</HI> it&s;elf; and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pracontal</HI> lay
with 10000 Men, ju&s;t under the Cannon of one
of the Forts, which Guard the Cau&s;eway, which
leads into the City of <HI>Mantua:</HI> So that had all
the&s;e joyn'd, as they would have done in a few
Days more, the Prince mu&s;t have been put to his
&s;hifts, and would have had enough to do, to have
maintain'd him&s;elf in <HI>Italy;</HI> for he was Ma&s;ter
of no one Place in the Country, that could have
held out a formal Seige of fifteen Days open
Trenches, and he knew all this very well, and
therefore it &s;eems, while the Duke of <HI>Vendo&s;me,</HI>
re&s;olv'd if po&s;&s;ible to bring him to a Bat|tle,
and to that End, made Di&s;po&s;itions to at|tack
<HI>Luzara;</HI> we were &s;urpriz'd to find the 15th
of <HI>June,</HI> 1702, the whole Imperial Army ap|pear'd
in Batalia, and in full March to attack
us.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="284">
AS it happen'd, our Army was all marching in
Columns towards them, as we had done for two
Days before, and I &s;hould have told you, that
three Days before, the Duke having Notice that
General <HI>Vi&s;conti,</HI> with three Imperial Regiments
of Hor&s;e, and one of Dragoons, was po&s;tedat <HI>San-Victoria,</HI>
on the <HI>Te&s;&s;ona;</HI> he re&s;olv'd to attack
them, and this De&s;ign was carried &s;o &s;ecretly that
while Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vi&s;conti,</HI> tho' our Army was three
Leagues another way, pa&s;&s;ing towards the <HI>Mode|ne&s;e,</HI>
he found him&s;elf unexpedctely attack'd by
6000 Hor&s;e, and Dragoons of the <HI>French</HI> Army: He
defended him&s;elf very Bravely, for near an Hour;
when being over pour'd, and finding he &s;hould
be forc'd into Di&s;order, he founded a Retreat, but
the Squadrons had not fac'd about to make their
Retreat &s;carce a Quarter of an Hour, when they
found them&s;elves &s;urrounded with a great Body
of Infantry, who had entirely cut off their Re|treat,
except over the Bridge of <HI>Ta&s;&s;ona,</HI> which
being throng'd with their Baggage, they could
neither get backward or forward; &s;o they Thru&s;t
and tumbl'd over one another, in &s;uch a
manner, that they could pre&s;erve no kind of
Order; but abundance fell into the River, and
were drowned, many were kill'd, and more ta|ken
Pri&s;oners, &s;o that in a Word the whole three
Regiments of Hor&s;e, and one of Dragoons, were
entirely Defeated.</P>
<P>THIS was a great Blow to the Prince, becau&s;e
they were &s;ome of the choice&s;t Troops of his
whole Army: We took about 400 Pri&s;oners, and
all their Baggage, which was a very con&s;iderable
Booty, and about 800 Hor&s;es; and no doubt the&s;e
Troops were very much wanted in the Battle that
in&s;ued on the 15th; as I have &s;aid: Our Army be|ing
<PB N="279" REF="285">
in full March, as <HI>above,</HI> to attack <HI>Luzara,</HI> a
Party of the <HI>Germans</HI> appear'd, being about 600
Hor&s;e, and in le&s;s than an Hour more, their whole
Army in order of Battle.</P>
<P>OUR Army form'd immediately, and the Duke
po&s;ted the Regiments as they came up, &s;o much
to their Advantage, that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was oblig'd
to alter his Di&s;po&s;itions, and had this particular
Inconvenience upon his Hands, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to attack
an Army &s;uperior to his own, in all their mo&s;t
advantagious Po&s;ts; whereas had he thought fit
to have waited but one Day, we &s;hould have met
him half way; but this was owing to the Pride
of the <HI>German</HI> Generals, and their being &s;o Opi|niated
of the goodne&s;s of their Troops: The Royal
Army was Po&s;ted with the Left to the great River
<HI>Po,</HI> on the other Side of which the Prince of <HI>Vau|demonts</HI>'s
Army lay, Canonading of the intrench|ments
which the Imperiali&s;ts had made at <HI>Borgo-Fort,</HI>
and hearing that there was like to be a ge|neral
Battle, he detach'd 12 Battalions, and a|bout
1000 Hor&s;e to Reinforce the Royal Army;
all which to our great Encouragement had time to
joyn the Army, while Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was making
his new Di&s;po&s;itions for the attack; and yet it
was the coming of the&s;e Troops which caus'd
Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> to re&s;olve to begin the Fight, ex|pecting
to have come to an Action before they
cou'd come up, but he was di&s;appointed in the
Rea&s;on of Fighting, and yet was oblig'd to Fight
too, which was an Error in the Prince, that it
was too late to retrieve.</P>
<P>IT was five a-Clock in the Evening before he
could bring up his whole Line to Engage, and
then after having Canonaded us to no great pur|po&s;e
half an Hour, his Right commanded by the
<PB N="280" REF="286">
Prince <HI>de Comercy,</HI> attack'd our Left Wing with
great Fury: Our Meu receiv'd them &s;o well, and
&s;econded one another &s;o punctually, that they
were Repul&s;ed with a very great Slaughter, and
the Prince <HI>Comercy,</HI> being (unhappily for them)
kill'd in the fir&s;t On&s;et, the Regiments for want
of Orders, and &s;urpris'd with the fall of &s;o great
a Man, were pu&s;h'd into di&s;order, and one whole
Brigade was entirely broke.</P>
<P>BUT their &s;econd Line advancing under Gene|ral
<HI>Herbeville,</HI> re&s;tor'd things, in the fir&s;t; the Bat|talions
rallyed, and they came boldly on to
Charge a &s;econd time, and being Seconded, with
new Reinforcements from their main Body, our
Men had their Turn, and were pu&s;h'd to a Canal,
which lay on their left Flank, between them and
the <HI>Po,</HI> behind which they rally'd, and being
&s;upported by new Troops, as well Hor&s;e as Foot;
they fought on both Sides, with the utmo&s;t ob&s;ti|nacy,
and with &s;uch Courage and Skill, that it
was not po&s;&s;ible to judge who &s;hould have had
the better, could they have been able to have
fought it out.</P>
<P>ON the Right of the Royal Army, was Po&s;ted,
the Flower of the <HI>French</HI> Cavalry; Namely, the
<HI>Gens de Arms,</HI> the Royal Carabineers, and the
Queen's Hor&s;e-Guards, with 400 Hor&s;e more, and
next them the Infantry, among which were our
Brigade; the Hor&s;e advanc'd fir&s;t to Charge
and they carried all before them Sword
in Hand, receiving the Fire of two Imperial
Regiments of Curia&s;&s;ers, without firing a Shot,
and falling in among them, bore them down by
the &s;trength of their Hor&s;es, putting them into
Confu&s;ion, and left &s;o clear a Field for us to
follow, that the fir&s;t Line of our Infantry &s;tood
<PB N="281" REF="287">
drawn up upon the Ground, which the Enemy
at fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P>IN this fir&s;t attack the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Crequi,</HI> who
Commanded the whole Right Wing, was kil|led;
a Lo&s;s, which fully ballanc'd the Death of
the Prince <HI>de Commercy,</HI> on the Side of the <HI>Ger|mans;</HI>
after we had thus pu&s;hed the Enemies Ca|valry,
<HI>as above,</HI> their Troops, being rally'd by
the Dexterity of their Generals, and &s;upported
by three Imperial Regiments of Foot, they came
on again to the Charge with &s;uch Fury, that no|thing
could with&s;tand them; and here two Batta|lions
of our <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiments were put into Di&s;orer,
and abundance of our Men kill'd, and here al&s;o I
had the Misfortune to receive a Mu&s;quet &s;hot,
which broke my left Arm, and, that was not all,
for I was knock'd down by a Gyant like a <HI>Ger|man</HI>
Soldier, who when he thought he had kill'd
me, &s;et his Foot upon me, but was immediately
&s;hot dead by one of my Men, and fell ju&s;t up|on
me, which, my Arm being broken, was a ve|ry
great mi&s;chief to me, for the very weight of
the Fellow, who was almo&s;t as big as a Hor&s;e,
was &s;uch, that I was not able to &s;tir.</P>
<P>OUR Men were beaten back after this, from
the Place where they &s;tood, and &s;o I was left in
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Enemy, but was not their Pri|&s;oner,
(<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> was not found) till next
Morning, when a Party being &s;ent, as u&s;ual with
Surgeons to look after the wounded Men, among
the Dead, found me almo&s;t &s;mothered with the
dead <HI>Germans,</HI> and others that lay near me; how|ever,
to do them ju&s;tice, they us'd me with hu|manity,
and the Surgeons &s;et my Arm very Skil|fully,
and well; and after four or five Days I
had liberty to go to <HI>Parma</HI> upon my Parole.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="288">
BOTH the Armies continued fighting, e&s;pe|cially
on our Left, till it was &s;o dark, that it was

their Lo&s;&s;es, as much as was po&s;&s;ible, but
'tis certain that never Battle was fought with
greater Bravery, and Ob&s;tinacy than this was, and
had there been Day light to have fought it cut,
doubtle&s;s there would have been many Thou&s;and
Men more kill'd on both Sides.</P>
<P>ALL the <HI>Germans</HI> had to entitle them to the
Victory was, that they made our Left retire, as
I have &s;aid to the Canal, and to the high Banks,
or Mounds on the edge of the <HI>Po;</HI> but they had
&s;o much Advantage in the Retreat, that they fir'd
from thence among the thicke&s;t of the Enemy,
and cou'd never be forc'd from their Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t Te&s;timony the Royal Army had
of the Victory, and which was certainly the bet|ter
of the two, was, that two Days after the Fight,
they attack'd <HI>Gua&s;talla,</HI> as it were in View of the
<HI>German</HI> Army, and forc'd the Garri&s;on to &s;ur|render,
and to &s;wear not to Serve again for &s;ix
Months, which they being 1500 Men, was a great
Lo&s;s to the <HI>Germans,</HI> and yet Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> did
not offer to Relieve it; and after that we took
&s;everal other Po&s;ts, which the Imperiali&s;ts had
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, but were oblig'd to Quit them up|on
the approach of the <HI>French</HI> Army, not being
in Condition to Fight another Battle that Year.</P>
<P>MY Campaign was now at an End, and tho'
I came Lame off, I came off much better than
abundance of Gentlemen, for in that bloody Bat|tle
<PB N="283" REF="289">
we had above 400 Officers kill'd or wounded,
whereof three were General Officers.</P>
<P>THE Campaign held on till <HI>December,</HI> and
the Duke <HI>de Vendom&s;e</HI> took <HI>Borgo Fort,</HI> and &s;e|veral
other Places from the <HI>Germans,</HI> who in
&s;hort, lo&s;t Ground every Day in <HI>Italy,</HI> I was a
Pri&s;oner a great while, and there being no Car|tel
&s;ettled, Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> order'd the <HI>French</HI> Pri|&s;oners
to be &s;ent into <HI>Hungary,</HI> which was a Cruel|ty
that could not be rea&s;onably exerci&s;ed on
them; however, a great many by that Bani&s;hment,
found means to make their E&s;cape to the <HI>Turks,</HI>
by whom they were kindly receiv'd, and the
<HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> took care of
them, and Shipp'd them back again into <HI>Italy</HI> at
the King's Charge.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke <HI>de Vendom&s;e</HI> now took &s;o many
<HI>Germans</HI> Pri&s;oners, that Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was try'd of
&s;ending his Pri&s;oners to <HI>Hungary,</HI> and was oblig'd
to be at the Charge of bringing &s;ome of them
back again, who he had &s;ent thither, and come
to agree to a general Exchange of Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>I was, as I have &s;aid, allow'd for a time to go to
<HI>Parma,</HI> upon my Parole, where I continu'd for the
recovery of my Wound, and broken Arm, forty
Days, and was then oblig'd to render my &s;elf to
the Commanding Officer at <HI>Ferrara,</HI> where Prince
<HI>Eugene</HI> coming &s;oon after, I was with &s;everal o|ther
Pri&s;oners of War, &s;ent away into the <HI>Mila|ne&s;e</HI>
to be kept for an Exchange of Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>IT was in the City of <HI>Trent,</HI> that I continu'd
about eight Months, the Man in who&s;e Hou&s;e I
Quartered, was exceeding Civil to me, and took a
great deal of care of me, and I liv'd very ea&s;ie;
here I contracted a kind of Familiarity, perfect|ly
unde$$gn'd by me, with the Daughter of the
<PB N="284" REF="290">
Burgher at who&s;e Hou&s;e I had Lodg'd, and I know
not, by what fatallity that was upon me, I was
prevail'd with afterward to Marry her: This was a
peice of Hone&s;ty on my Side, which I mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
I never intended to be guilty of; but
the Girl was too cunning for me; for &s;he found
means to get &s;ome Wine into my Head more than
I us'd to drink, and tho' I was not &s;o di&s;order'd
with it, but that I knew very well what I did,
yet in an unu&s;ual height of good Humour, I con|&s;ented
to be Married. This impolitick piece of
Hone&s;ty put me to many Inconveniences, for I
knew not what to do with this new Clog, which
I had loaded my&s;elf with, I could neither &s;tay
with her, or take her with me, &s;o that I was ex|ceedingly
perplex'd.</P>
<P>THE time came &s;oon after that I was releas'd
by the <HI>Cha$tel,</HI> and &s;o was oblig'd to go to the Re|giment,
which then was in Quarters in the <HI>Mi|lane&s;e,</HI>
and from thence, I got leave to go to <HI>Paris</HI>
upon my Promi&s;e to rai&s;e &s;ome Recruits in <HI>England</HI>
for the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiments, by the help of my Corre|&s;pondence
there; having thus leave to go to <HI>Paris,</HI> I
took a Pa&s;&s;port from the Enemy's Army, to go to
<HI>Trent,</HI> and making a long Circuit, I went back thi|ther,
and very hone&s;tly pack'd up my Baggage,
Wife, and all, and brought her away thro' <HI>Tyrot,</HI>
into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and &s;o thro' <HI>Suabia,</HI> and the black
Fore&s;t into <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> from thence, I came into <HI>Lou|rain,</HI>
and &s;o to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I HAD now a &s;ecret De&s;ign to quit the War,
for I really had enough of &s;ighting; but it was
counted &s;o Di&s;honouable a Thing to quit, while
the Army was in the Field, that I could not Di&s;|pen&s;e
with it, but an intervening Accident made
that Part ea&s;ie to me: The War was now renew|ed
<PB N="285" REF="291">
between <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> ju&s;t
as it was before; and the <HI>French</HI> King meditate|ing
nothing more than how to give the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> a
Diver&s;ion, fitted out a &s;trong Squadron of Men
of War, and Frigates at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> on Board of
which he embark'd a Body of Troops, of about
6500 Men, be&s;ides Voluntiers, and the new King,
as we call'd him, tho' more generally he was cal|led,
the Chevalier <HI>de</HI> St. <HI>George</HI> was Shipp'd a|long
with them, and all for <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I pretended a great deal of Zeal for this Ser|vice,
and that if I might be permitted to &s;ell my
Company in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiment I was in, and
have the <HI>Chevalier's</HI> Brevet for a Colonel, in Ca&s;e
of rai&s;ing Troops for him in <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
after his arrival, I would embark Voluntier,
and Serve at my own Expence; the latter
gave me a great advantage with the <HI>Chevalier;</HI>
for now I was e&s;teem'd as a Man of Con&s;idera|tion,
and one that mu&s;t have a con&s;iderable In|tere&s;t
in my own Country; &s;o I obtain'd leave
to &s;ell my Company, and having had a good
round Sum of Money remitted me from <HI>London,</HI>
by the way of <HI>Holland,</HI> I prepar'd a very hand|&s;ome
Equipage, and away I went to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to
embark.</P>
<P>I WAS very well receiv'd by the <HI>Chevalier,</HI>
and as he had an Account that I was an Officer
in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Brigade, and had &s;erv'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> and
con&s;equently was an old Soldier; all this added
to the Character which I had before, and made
me have a great deal of Honour paid me, tho'
at the &s;ame time I had no particular attachment
to his Per&s;on, or to his Cau&s;e, nor indeed did I
much con&s;ider the Cau&s;e, of one Side or other,
if I had, I &s;hould hardly have ri&s;qu'd not my
Life only, but Effects too, which were all as I
<PB N="286" REF="292">
might &s;ay, from that Moment forfeited to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Government and was too evidently in their
Power to confi&s;cate at their Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>HOWEVER having ju&s;t receiv'd a Remittance
from <HI>London,</HI> of 300 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, and &s;old my
Company in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiment for very near as
much, I was not only in&s;en&s;ibly drawn in, but was
perfectly Voluntier in that dull Cau&s;e, and away
I went with them at all hazards; it belongs very
little to my Hi&s;tory to give an Account of that
fruitle&s;s Expedition, only to tell you that being
&s;o clo&s;ely, and effectually Chas'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Fleet, which was Superior in force to the <HI>French,</HI>
I may &s;ay, that in e&s;caping them, I e&s;caped be|ing
hang'd.</P>
<P>IT was the good Fortune of the <HI>French,</HI> that
they over-&s;hot the Port they aim'd at, and in|tending
for the <HI>Frith</HI> or <HI>Forth,</HI> or as it is call'd
the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburg,</HI> the fir&s;t Land they made
was as far North as a Place call'd <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> where
it was not their Bu&s;ine&s;s to Land, and &s;o they
were oblig'd to come back to the <HI>Frith,</HI> and were
gotten to the Enterance of it, and came to an
Anchor for the Tide; but this Delay or Hinder|ance
gave time to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, under Sir <HI>George
Ping</HI> to come up to the <HI>Frith,</HI> and they came
to an Anchor, ju&s;t as we did, only waiting to go
up the <HI>Firth</HI> with the Flood.</P>
<P>HAD we not over-&s;hot the Port, as above, all our
Squadron had been de&s;troy'd in two Days, and all
we could have done, had been to have gotten in|to
the <HI>Peer</HI> or <HI>Haven</HI> at <HI>Leith,</HI> with the &s;maller
Fregates, and have Landed the Troops and Am|munition,
but we mu&s;t have &s;et fire to the Men
of War, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squadron was not above
24 Hours behind us, or thereabout.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="293">
UPON this &s;urprize the <HI>French</HI> Admiral &s;et
Sail from the North Point of the <HI>Firth,</HI> where
we lay, and crowding away to the North, got
the Start of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, and made their
e&s;cape, with the Lo&s;s of one Ship only, which
being behind the re&s;t, could not get away; when
we were &s;atisfy'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> left Cha&s;ing us,
which was not till the third Night, when we al|ter'd
our Cour&s;e, and lo&s;t Sight of them, we &s;tood
over to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI> and keeping that
Shore on Board all the way to the Mouth of the
<HI>Baltick,</HI> we came to an Anchor again, and &s;ent
two Scouts Abroad to learn News, to &s;ee if the Sea
was clear, and being &s;atisfy'd that the Enemy
did not Cha&s;e us, we kept on with an ea&s;ier Sail,
and came all back again to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and glad I
was to &s;et my Foot on Shore again, for all the
while we were thus fiying for our Lives, I was
under the greate&s;t Terror immaginable, and no|thing
but Halters and Gibbets run in my Head,
concluding, that if I had been taken, I &s;hould
certainly have been hang'd.</P>
<P>BUT the care was now over, I took my leave
of the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and of the Army, and made
ha&s;t to <HI>Paris,</HI> I came &s;o unexpectedly to <HI>Paris,</HI> and
to my own Lodgings that it was my Misfortune to
make a Di&s;covery, relating to my Wife, which
was not at all to my &s;atisfaction, for I found her
Lady&s;hip had kept &s;ome Company, that I had
Rea&s;on to believe were not &s;uch as an hone&s;t Wo|man
ought to have Convers'd with, and as I knew
her Temper, by what I had found of her my&s;elf,
I grew very Jealous and Unea&s;ie about her; I
mu&s;t own it touch'd me very nearly, for I be|gan
to have an extraordinary value for her, and
her Behaviour was very taking, e&s;pecially after
<PB N="288" REF="294">
I had brought her into <HI>France;</HI> but having a Vein
of Levity, it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent her run|ing
into &s;uch things, in a Town, &s;o full of what
they call Gallantry as <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>IT vext me al&s;o to think that it &s;hould be my
Fate to be a Cuckold, both Abroad and at Home,
and &s;ometimes I would be in &s;uch a Rage about
it, that I had no Government of my&s;elf, when I
thought of it; whole Days, and I may &s;ay &s;ome|times
whole Nights I &s;pent mu&s;ing and con&s;ider|ing
what I &s;hould do to her, and e&s;pecially what
I &s;hould do to the Villain, wherever he was that
had thus abus'd and &s;uplanted me: Here indeed
I committed Murther more than once, or indeed
than a hundred times, in my imagination, and as
the Devil is certainly an apparent Prompter to
wickedne&s;s, if he is not the fir&s;t Mover of it in
our Minds; he teiz'd me Night and Day with
Propo&s;als to kill my Wife.</P>
<P>THIS horrid Project he carried up &s;o high,
by rai&s;ing fierce Thoughts, and fomenting the
Blood upon my Contemplation of the word
Cuckold, that in &s;hort, I left debating whether I
&s;hould Murther her or no, as a thing out of the Que|&s;tion,
and Determined; and my Thoughts were
then taken up only with the Management how I
&s;hould kill her, and how to make my e&s;cape after
I had done it.</P>
<P>ALL this while I had no &s;ufficient Evidence of
her Guilt, neither had I &s;o much as charg'd her
with it, or let her know I &s;u&s;pected her, other|wi&s;e,
than as &s;he might perceive it in my Con|duct,
and in the Change of my Behaviour to her,
which was &s;uch, that the could not but perceive
that &s;omething troubled me, yet &s;he took no no|tice
of it to me, but receiv'd me very well, and
<PB N="289" REF="295">
&s;hew'd her&s;elf to be very glad of my return;
nor did I find &s;he had been Extravagant in her
Expences while I was Abroad; but Jealou&s;ie, as
the wi&s;e Man &s;ays, <HI>is the wrath of a Man;</HI> her be|ing
&s;o good a Hu&s;&s;y of what Mon$y I had left
her, gave my di&s;temper'd Fancy an Opinion that
&s;he had been maintain'd by other People, and &s;o
had had no Occa&s;ion'd to &s;pend.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s &s;he had a difficult Point here
upon her, tho' &s;he had been really hone&s;t; for as
my Head was prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd of her di&s;hone&s;ty; if
&s;he had been Lavi&s;h, I &s;hould have &s;aid, &s;he had
&s;pent it upon her Gentlemen; and as &s;he had been
Frugal, I &s;aid, &s;he had been Maintain'd by them:
Thus, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> my Head was Di&s;temper'd, I be|liev'd
my&s;elf Abus'd, and nothing could put it
out of my Thoughts Night or Day.</P>
<P>ALL this while, it was not vi&s;ibly broken out
between us, but I was &s;o fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the
belief of it, that I &s;eem'd to want no Evi|dence,
and I look'd with an evil Eye upon every
Body that came near her, or that &s;he Con|vers'd
with: There was an Officer of the <HI>Guards
du Corps</HI> that lodg'd in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with us, a
very hone&s;t Gentleman, and a Man of Quality; I
happen'd to be in a little Drawing-Room, adjoyn|ing
to a Parlour where my Wife &s;at at that time,
and this Gentleman came into the Parlour, which
as he was one of the Family, he might have
done without Offence, but he not knowing that
I was in the drawing-Room, &s;at down and talk'd
with my Wife; I heard every word they &s;aid, for
the Door between us was open, nor could I &s;ay
that there pa&s;s'd any thing between them, but cur|&s;ory
Di&s;cour&s;e; they talk'd of ca&s;ual things, of a
young Lady a Burgher's Daughter of 19, that had
<PB N="290" REF="296">
been Married the Week before to an Advocate
in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> va&s;tly Rich, and a|bout
63, and of another, a Widow Lady of Fortune
in <HI>Paris,</HI> that had married her deceas'd Husbands
Valet de Chamber, and of &s;uch ca&s;ual Matters,
that I could find no Fault with now at all.</P>
<P>BUT it fill'd my Head with jealous Thoughts,
and fir'd my Temper: Now I fancy'd he us'd too
much freedom with her, then that &s;he us'd too
much freedom to him, and once or twice I was
upon the Point of breaking in upon them, and
Affronting them both, but I re&s;train'd my&s;elf; at
length he talk'd &s;omething merrily of the Lady
throwing away her Maidenhead, as I under&s;tood
it, upon an old Man; but &s;till it was nothing in|decent,
but I, who was all on fire already could
bear it no longer, but &s;tarted up, and came into
the Room, and catching at my Wive's words, <HI>&s;ay
you &s;o,</HI> Madam, &s;aid I, <HI>was he too old for her!</HI> and
giving the Officer a look, that I Fancy was &s;ome|thing
a Kin to the Face on the Sign, call'd the
<HI>Bull and Mouth</HI> within <HI>Alder&s;gate,</HI> I went out in|to
the Street.</P>
<P>THE Marqui&s;s, &s;o he was &s;til'd, a Man of
Honour, and of Spirit too, took it, <HI>as I meant it,</HI>
and follow'd me in a Moment, and Hem'd after
me in the Street; upon which I &s;topp'd, and he
came up too me, Sir, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> our Circum&s;tances

<P>I WAS a little cool'd, as to the Point of my
Conduct to him in the very few Moments that
had pa&s;s'd, and was very &s;en&s;ible, that I was
wrong to him, and, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> therefore to him very
<PB N="291" REF="297">
frankly, Sir, you are a Gentleman, who I know
very well, and I have a very great re&s;pect for you;

would you have done le&s;s?</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry for any di&s;like between you, and
your Wife, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> But what is that to me? Can
you Charge me with any Indecency to her, except
my talking &s;o, and &s;o, at which he repeated the
Words, and as I knew you were in next Room,
and heard every Word, and that all the Doors
were open, I thought no Man could have taken
ami&s;s, &s;o Innocent an Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I could no otherwi&s;e take it ami&s;s, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> than
as I thought it imply'd a farther Familiarity,

any Man of Honour; however, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I &s;poke
only to my Wife, I &s;aid nothing to you, but gave
you my Hat as I pa&s;s'd you.</P>
<P>YES, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> and a look as full of Rage as
the Devil, Are there no Words in &s;uch looks?</P>

grow Calm,</HI> your anger at your Wife, was for her
Di&s;cour&s;e with me, and I think that concerns me
too, and I ought to Re&s;ent it.</P>
<P>I think not, Sir, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> nor had I found you in Bed
with my Wife, would I have Quarreled with you;
for if my Wife will let you lye with her, 'tis &s;he
is the Offender, what have I do with you; you
could not lye with her if &s;he was not willing,
and if &s;he is willing to be a Whore I ought to
puni&s;h her, but I &s;hould have no quarrel with
you, I'll lye with your Wife if I can, and then
I am even with you.</P>

I &s;poke this all in good Humour, and in order
to pacify him, but it would not do; but he would
have me have give him &s;atisfaction, <HI>as he call'd it,</HI>
I told him I was a Stranger in the Country, and
perhaps &s;hould find little Mercy in their Cour&s;e

any Man in his Vindicating his keeping Compa|ny

in having a bad Woman to deal with, that there
was no Rea&s;on in the thing; that after any Man

am injur'd &s;hould go, and Stake my Life upon
an equal Hazard again&s;t the Men who have a|bus'd
me.</P>
<P>NOTHING would prevail with this Per&s;on

him, and no &s;atisfaction could be made him,

much of her Favour, he would take care then to
put me pa&s;t the Su&s;picion, I gave him as
rough an An&s;wer, as he could de&s;ire, and he re|turn'd
in <HI>French, nous Verrons aux Li&s;le,</HI> that is to
&s;ay, we will talk further of it at <HI>Li&s;le.</HI></P>
<P>I told him, I did not &s;ee the benefit, either

Mon&s;ieur&mdash;<HI>s</HI> Garden-wall; &s;o we went thi|ther,
and fell to Work immediately, after &s;ome
Fencing he made a home, Thru&s;t at me, and run
me into my Arm, a long &s;lanting Wound, but at
the &s;ame time receiv'd my Point into his Body,
and &s;oon after fell; he &s;poke &s;ome Words before
he drop'd; fir&s;t he told me I had kill'd him, then
he &s;aid, he had indeed wrong'd me, and as he
knew it, he ought not to have fought me; he de&s;ir'd
I would make my E&s;cape immediately, which
I did into the City, but no farther, no body, as
I thought having &s;een us together: In the Af|ternoon,
about &s;ix Hours after the Action, Me&s;|&s;engers
brought News one on the Heels of another,
that the Marqui&s;s was mortally wounded, and
carried into a Hou&s;e at <HI>Charenton;</HI> that account,
&s;aying he was not dead, &s;urpris'd me a little, not
doubting, but that concluding I had made my
E&s;cape, he would own who it was; however, I
di&s;cover'd nothing of my Concern, but going up
into my Chamber, I took out of a Cabinet there
what Money I had, which indeed was &s;o much as
I thought would be &s;ufficient for my Expences;
but having an accepted Bill for 2000 Livers, I
walk'd &s;edately to a Merchant who knew me, and
got 50 Pi&s;tols of him upon my Bill, letting him
<PB N="294" REF="300">
know my Bu&s;ine&s;s call'd me to <HI>England,</HI> and I
would take the re&s;t of him when he had re|ceiv'd
it.</P>
<P>HAVING furni&s;h'd my&s;elf thus, I provided me
a Hor&s;e for my Servant, for I had one very good
one of my own, and once more ventured Home
to my Lodging, where I heard again that the
Marqui&s;s was not dead: My Wife all this while
cover'd her Concern for the Marqui&s;s &s;o well,
that &s;he gave me no room to make any remark
upon her; but &s;he &s;aw evidently the Marks of
Rage, and deep Re&s;entment in my Behaviour af|ter
&s;ome little &s;tay, and perceiving me mak|ing
Preparations for a Journey; &s;he &s;aid to
me, Are you going out of Town? yes Madam,
<HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that you may have room to Mourn for
your Friend, the Marqui&s;s; at which &s;he &s;tarted,
and &s;hew'd &s;he was indeed in a mo&s;t terrible
Fright: And making a thou&s;and Cro&s;&s;es about
her&s;elf, and with a great many callings upon the
<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin,</HI> and her Country <HI>Saints,</HI> &s;he bur&s;t
out at la&s;t, is it <HI>po&s;&s;ible!</HI> Are you the Man that
has kill'd the Marqui&s;s? then you are undone,
and I too.</P>
<P>YOU may, Madam, be a lo&s;er by the Mar|qui&s;s
being kill'd, but I'll take care to be as lit|tle
a loo&s;er by you as I can; 'tis enough, the Mar|qui&s;s
has hone&s;tly confe&s;t your Guilt, and I have
done with you; &s;he would have thrown her|&s;elf
into my Arms, prote&s;ting her Innocence, and
told me &s;he would flye with me, and would Con|vince
me of her Fidelity, by &s;uch Te&s;timonies
as I cou'd not but be &s;atisfy'd with, but I thru&s;t
her violently from me, <HI>alle Infame!</HI> &s;aid I, go in|famous
Creature, and take from me the Nece&s;&s;ity
I &s;hould be under, if I &s;tay'd of &s;ending you to
<PB N="295" REF="301">
keep Company with your dear Friend the Mar|qui&s;s.
I thru&s;t her away with &s;uch Force that &s;he
fell backward upon the Floor, and cry'd out
mo&s;t terribly, and indeed &s;he had Rea&s;on, for
&s;he was very much hurt.</P>
<P>IT griev'd me indeed to have thru&s;t her away
with &s;uch Force, but you mu&s;t con&s;ider me now in
the Circum&s;tances of a Man enrag'd, and as it
were out of him&s;elf Furious and Mad: However, I
took her up from the Floor, and laid her on the Bed,
and calling up her Maid, bad her go and take care
of her Mi&s;tre&s;s; and going &s;oon after out of Doors,
I took Hor&s;e, and made the be&s;t of my way, not
towards <HI>Calais</HI> or <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> or towards <HI>Flanders,</HI>
whether it might be &s;ugge&s;ted I was fled, and
whether they did pur&s;ue me, the &s;ame Evening;
but I took the direct Road for <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and rid|ing
all Night and very hard, I pa&s;s'd the <HI>Main</HI>
the next Day at Night at <HI>Chalons,</HI> and came
&s;afe into the Duke of <HI>Lorrain's</HI> Dominions the
third Day; where I re&s;ted one Day, only to con|&s;ider
what Cour&s;e to take, for it was &s;till a
mo&s;t difficult thing to pa&s;s any way, but that
I &s;hould either be in the King of <HI>France's</HI> Domi|nions,
or be taken by the <HI>French</HI> Allies as a Subject
of <HI>France;</HI> but getting good Advice from a Prie&s;t
at <HI>Bar le Due,</HI> who tho' I did not tell him the parti|culars
of my Ca&s;e, yet gue&s;s'd how it was, it being
as he &s;aid very u&s;ual for Gentlemen in my Cir|cum&s;tances
to fly that way, upon this Suppo&s;ition,
this kind <HI>Padre</HI> got me a Church Pa&s;s, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI>
he made me a Purveyor for the Abbey of&mdash;
and as &s;uch got me a Pa&s;sport to go to <HI>Deux
Ponts,</HI> which belong'd to the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI>
Having &s;uch Authority there, and the Prie&s;t's
recommendation to an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick in the Place, I
<PB N="296" REF="302">
got Pa&s;sports from thence in the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI>
Name to <HI>Cologne,</HI> and then I was thoroughly &s;afe, &s;o
making my way to the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> without any
difficulty, I came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and from thence,
tho' very privately, and by &s;everal Names, I
came to <HI>England:</HI> And thus I got clear of my
<HI>Italian</HI> Wife, Whore I &s;hould have call'd her, for
after I had made her &s;o my &s;elf, how &s;hould I ex|pect
any other of her.</P>
<P>BEING arriv'd at <HI>London,</HI> I wrote to my
Friend at <HI>Paris,</HI> but dated my Letter from the
<HI>Hague,</HI> where I order'd him to Direct his An|&s;wers:
The chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of my writing was to
know if my Bill was paid him, to enquire if any
pur&s;uit was made after me, and what other News
he had about me, or my Wife, and particular|ly
how it had far'd with the Marqui&s;s.</P>
<P>I receiv'd an An&s;wer in a few Days, import|ing
that he had receiv'd the Money on my Bill,
which he was ready to pay as I &s;hould direct,
that the Marqui&s;s was not dead, but &s;aid he,
you have kill'd him another way, for he has lo&s;t
his Commi&s;&s;ion in the Guards, which was worth to
him 20000 Livres, and he is yet a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner
in the <HI>Ba&s;tile;</HI> that pur&s;uit was order'd after me
upon &s;u&s;pi&s;ion, that they had follow'd me to <HI>A|miens,</HI>
on the Road to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and to <HI>Cha&s;tean de
Cambre&s;is,</HI> on the way to <HI>Flanders;</HI> but mi&s;ling me
that way, had given it over; that the Marqui&s;s had
been too well in&s;tructed to own that he had fought
with me, but &s;aid, that he was a&s;&s;aulted on the Road,
and unle&s;s I could be taken, he would take his Trial,
and come off, for want of Proof, that my flying
was a Circum&s;tance indeed, that mov'd &s;trong|ly
again&s;t him, becau&s;e it was known that we
had had &s;ome Words that Day, and were &s;een
<PB N="297" REF="303">
to walk together; but that nothing being prov'd
on either Side, he would come off with the Lo&s;s
of his Commi&s;&s;ion; which, however, being very
Rich, he could bear well enough.</P>
<P>AS to my Wife, he wrote me Word, &s;he was
incon&s;olable, and had cry'd her &s;elf to Death
almo&s;t; but, <HI>he added,</HI> (very ill natur'd indeed)
and whether it was for me, or for the Marqui&s;s,
that he could not determine: <HI>He likewi&s;e told me,</HI>
She was in very bad Circum&s;tances, and very
low, So that if I did not take &s;ome Care of her,
&s;he would come to be in very great Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE latter Part of this Story mov'd me
indeed, for, I thought however it was, I ought
not to let her Starve; and be&s;ides, Poverty was a
Temptation which a Woman could not ea&s;ily
with&s;tand, and I ought not to be the In&s;trument
to drive her to a horrid Nece&s;&s;ity of Crime, if I
could prevent it.</P>
<P>UPON this, I wrote to him again, to go to
her, and talk with her, and learn as much as he
could of her particular Circum&s;tances; and that
if he found &s;he was really in Want, and par|ticularly,
that &s;he did not live a &s;candalous Life,
he &s;hould give her twenty Pi&s;toles, and tell her,
if &s;he would engage to live retir'd and hone&s;tly,
&s;he &s;hould have &s;o much annually, which was
enough to &s;ub&s;it her.</P>
<P>SHE took the fir&s;t twenty Pi&s;toles, but bad
him tell me, that I had wrong'd her, and unju&s;t|ly
charg'd her; and I ought to do her Ju&s;tice;
and I had ruin'd her, by expo&s;&s;ing her in &s;uch a
Manner as I had, having no Proof of my Charge,
or Ground for any Su&s;picion; that as to twenty
Pi&s;toles a Year, it was a mean Allowance, to a
Wife that had travelled over the World, as &s;he
<PB N="298" REF="304">
had done with me, and the like; and &s;o expo&s;tu|lated
with him, to obtain forty Pi&s;toles a Year
of me, which I con&s;ented to; but &s;he never gave
me the Trouble of paying above one Year; for
after that, the Marqui&s;s was &s;o found of her again,
that he took her away to him&s;elf; and as my
Friend wrote me Word, had &s;ettled 400 Crowns
a Year on her, and I never heard any more
of her.</P>
<P>I was now in <HI>London,</HI> but was oblig'd to be ve|ry
retir'd, and change my Name, letting no Body
in the Nation know who I was, except my Mer|chant,
by whom I corre&s;ponded with my People
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and particularly that my Tutor,
who was now become the head Mannager of my
Affairs, and was in very good Circum&s;tances
him&s;elf al&s;o by my Means; but he de&s;erved all
I did, or could do for him; for he was a mo&s;t
faithful Friend, as well as Servant, as ever Man
had, in that Country at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>I was not the ea&s;ie&s;t Man alive, in the retir'd
&s;ollitary manner I now liv'd in; and I experi|enced
the Truth of the Text, <HI>That it is not good
for Man to be alone;</HI> for I was extreamly Melan|cholly
and Heavy, and indeed, knew not what
to do with my &s;elf; particularly, becau&s;e I was
under &s;ome Re&s;traint; that I was to afraid to go
Abroad; at la&s;t I re&s;olv'd to go quite away, and
go to <HI>Virginia</HI> again, and there live retired as I
could.</P>
<P>BUT when I came to con&s;ider that Part, more
narrowly, I could not prevail with my &s;elf to live
a private Life: I had got a wandring kind of
Ta&s;te, and Knowledge of Things, begat a De&s;ire
of encrea&s;ing it, and an exceeding Delight I had
in it; tho' I had nothing to do in the Armies
<PB N="299" REF="305">
or in the War, and did not de&s;ign ever to meddle
with it again; yet I could not live in the World,
and not enquire what was doing in it; nor could
I think of living in <HI>Virginia,</HI> where I was to hear
my News twice a Year, and read the publick
Accounts, of what was ju&s;t then upon the Stocks,
as the Hi&s;tory of things pa&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS, was my Notion, I was now in my
native Country, where my Circum&s;tances were
ea&s;y; and tho' I had had ill Luck Abroad, for I
brought little Home with me; yet by little good
Mannagement, I might &s;oon have Money by me.
I had no Body to keep but my &s;elf, and my Plan|tations
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> generally return'd me from
400 to 600 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, one Year above 700 <HI>l.</HI> and
to go thither, I concluded, was to be bury'd
a-live; &s;o I put off all Thoughts of it,
and re&s;olv'd to &s;ettle &s;omewhere in <HI>England,</HI>
where I might know every Body, and no Body
know me. I was not long in concluding where
to pitch, for as I &s;poke the <HI>French</HI> Tongue per|fectly
well, having been &s;o many Years among
them, it was ea&s;y for me to pa&s;s for a <HI>French</HI>
Man. So I went to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> call'd my &s;elf an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, among the <HI>French;</HI> and a <HI>French</HI>
Man among the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and on that Score,
was the more perfectly concealed, going by the
Name of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Charnot,</HI> with the <HI>French,</HI>
was call'd Mr. <HI>Charnock</HI> among the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>HERE, indeed, I liv'd perfectly <HI>Incog.</HI> I made
no particular Acquaintance, &s;o as to be intimate,
and yet I knew every Body, and every Body
knew me; I di&s;cours'd in Common, talk'd <HI>French</HI>
with the <HI>Walloons;</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI>
and living retir'd and &s;ober, was well enough re|ceiv'd
by all Sorts; but as I medled with no
<PB N="300" REF="306">
Bodies bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o no Body meddl'd with mine;
I thought I liv'd pretty well.</P>
<P>BUT I was not fully &s;atisfy'd, a &s;ettled
family Life was the thing I Lov'd had made
two pu&s;hes at it, as you have heard, but with ill
Succe&s;s; yet the Mi&s;carriage of what was pa&s;s'd did
not di&s;courage me at all but I re&s;olv'd to marry,
I look'd out for a Woman as &s;uitable as I could,
but always found &s;omething or other to &s;hock
my Fancy; except once a Gentleman's Daughter
of good Fa&s;hion, but I met with &s;o many re|pul&s;es
of one kind or another, that I was forc'd
to give it over, and indeed tho' I might be &s;aid
to be a Lover in this Suit, and had mannag'd
my&s;elf &s;o well with the young Lady, that I had
no difficulty le&s;t, but what would &s;oon have
been adju&s;ted, yet her Father was &s;o difficult,
made &s;o many Objections, was to Day not pleas'd,
one way to Morrow another, that he would &s;tand
by nothing that he him&s;elf had propos'd, nor
could he be ever be brought to be of the &s;ame
Mind two Days together; &s;o that we at la&s;t put
an End to the Pretentions, for &s;he would not Mar|ry
without her Father's con&s;ent, and I would not
&s;teal her, and &s;o that Affair ended.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, but I was a little vex'd at the
Di&s;appointment of this, &s;o I left the City of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> and went to <HI>London</HI> in the Stage-Coach;
here I had an odd Scene pre&s;ented as e|ver
happen'd of its kind.</P>
<P>THERE was in the Stage-Coach a young Wo|man,
and her Maid, &s;he was &s;itting in a very
melancholly Po&s;ture, for &s;he was in the Coach
before me, and &s;igh'd mo&s;t dreadfully all the
way, and whenever her Maid &s;poke to her, &s;he
bur&s;t out into Tears; I was not long in the Coach
<PB N="301" REF="307">
with her, but &s;eeing &s;he made &s;uch a di&s;mal Fi|gure,
I offer'd to Comfort her a little, and en|quir'd
into the Occa&s;ion of her Affliction, but
&s;he would not &s;peak a Word; but her Maid with
a force of crying too, &s;aid her Ma&s;ter was dead,
at which Word the Lady bur&s;t out again into a
Pa&s;&s;ion of crying, and between Mi&s;tre&s;s and
Maid, this was all I could get for the Morn|ing
part of that Day: When we came to Dine, I
offer'd the Lady, that &s;eeing, I &s;uppos'd &s;he would
not Dine with the Company, if &s;he would plea&s;e
to Dine with me, I would Dine in a &s;eparate
Room, for the re&s;t of the Company were Fo|reigners:
Her Maid thank'd me in her Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es
Name, but her Mi&s;tre&s;s could eat nothing, and
de&s;ir'd to be private.</P>
<P>HERE however, I had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with the
Maid, by whom I learn'd that the Lady was
Wife to a Captain of a Ship, who was Outward
bound to &s;omewhere in the <HI>Streights,</HI> I think it
was to <HI>Zant</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> that being gone no far|ther
than the <HI>Downs;</HI> he was taken &s;ick, and after
about ten days Illne&s;s had died at <HI>Deal,</HI> that his
Wife hearing of his Sickne&s;s, had gone to <HI>Deal</HI>
to &s;ee him, and had come but ju&s;t time enough
to &s;ee him die, had &s;tay'd there to bury him, and
was now coming to <HI>London,</HI> in a &s;ad di&s;con&s;olate
Condition indeed.</P>
<P>I heartily pitied the young Gentlewoman in|deed,
and &s;aid &s;ome things to her in the Coach, to
let her know I did &s;o, which &s;he gave no an&s;wer
to, but in Civility, now and then made a Bow, but
never gave me the lea&s;t Opportunity to &s;ee her
Face; or &s;o much as to know whether &s;he had a
Face, or no; much le&s;s to gue&s;s what Form of a
Face it was; it was Winter time, and the Coach
<PB N="302" REF="308">
put up at <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> not going thro' in a Day, as
was u&s;ual in Summer; and a little before we came
to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> I told the Lady I under&s;tood &s;he
had eat nothing to Day, that &s;uch a Cour&s;e
would but make her Sick, and doing her Harm,
could do her deceas'd. Husband no good, and
and therefore I entreated her, that as I was a
Stranger, and only offer'd a Civility to her in
Order to abate her &s;everely afflicting her&s;elf,
&s;he would yield &s;o far to matters of Ceremony,
let us Sup together as Pa&s;&s;engers, for as to the
Strangers they did not &s;eem to under&s;tand the
Cu&s;tom, or to de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>SHE bow'd, but gave no An&s;wer, only after
pre&s;&s;ing her by Arguments, which &s;he could not
deny was very civil and kind; &s;he return'd, that
&s;he gave me thanks, but &s;he could not eat; well,
Madam, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> do but &s;it down, tho' you think you
cannot eat, perhaps you may eat a Bit; indeed
you mu&s;t eat, or you will de&s;troy your&s;elf at
this rate of living, and upon the Road too: In a
Word, you will be Sick indeed; I argued with
her, the Maid put in, and &s;aid, do Madam, pray
try to divert your&s;elf a little; I pre&s;s'd her a|gain,
and &s;he bow'd to me very re&s;pectively, but
&s;till &s;aid no, and &s;he could not eat; the Maid
continu'd to importune her, and &s;aid, dear Ma|dam
do, the Gentleman is a civil Gentleman,
pray Madam do, and then turning to me &s;aid,
my Mi&s;tre&s;s will Sir, I hope, and &s;eem'd pleas'd,
and indeed was &s;o.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I went on to per&s;wade her, and
taking no Notice of what her Maid &s;aid, that I
was a civil Gentleman, I told her, I am a &s;tranger
to you Madam; but if I thought you were &s;hye of
me on any Account, as to civility, I will &s;end my
<PB N="303" REF="309">
Supper up to you in your Chamber, and &s;tay be|low
my&s;elf; &s;he bow'd then to me twice, and
look'd up, which was the fir&s;t time, and &s;aid, &s;he
had no Su&s;picion of that kind, that my offer was
&s;o civil, that &s;he was as much a&s;hamed to refu&s;e
it, as &s;he &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to accept it, if &s;he was
where &s;he was known; that &s;he thought I was not
quite a &s;tranger to her, for &s;he had &s;een me before;
that &s;he would accept my offer, &s;o far as to &s;it at
Table, becau&s;e I de&s;ir'd it, but &s;he could not promi&s;e
me to eat, and that &s;he hop'd I would take the
other as a Con&s;traint upon her, in return to &s;o
much kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>SHE &s;tartled me, when &s;he &s;aid &s;he had &s;een
me before, for I had not the lea&s;t knowledge of
her, nor did I remember &s;o much as to have heard
of her Name; for I had ask'd her Name of her
Maid, and indeed it made me almo&s;t Repent my
Compliment; for it was many ways e&s;&s;ential to
to me not to be known: However, I could
not go back, and be&s;ides, if I was known, it was
e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to me to know who it was
that knew me, and by what Circum&s;tances; &s;o I
went on with my Compliment.</P>
<P>WE came to the Inn, but ju&s;t before it was
Dark, I offer'd to hand my Widow out of the
Coach, and &s;he could not decline it, but tho' her
Hoods were not then much over her Face, yet
being dark, I could &s;ee little of her then, I
waited on her then to the Stair-foot, and led her
up the Inn Stairs to a Dining-room, which the
Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e offer'd to &s;how us, as if for the
whole Company; but &s;he declin'd going in there,
and &s;aid &s;he, de&s;ir'd rather to go directly to her
Chamber, and turning to her Maid, bad her &s;peak
to the Inn-Keeper to &s;how her her Lodging-room;
<PB N="304" REF="310">
&s;o I waited on her to the Door, and took my
leave telling her I would expect her at Supper.</P>
<P>IN order to Treat her moderately well, and
not extravagantly, for I had no thoughts of any
thing farther than Civility, which was the Effect
of meer Compa&s;&s;ion, for the Unhappine&s;s of the
mo&s;t truly di&s;con&s;olate Woman that I ever met
with: <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> in order to treat her hand&s;ome|ly,
but not extravagantly, I provided what the
Hou&s;e afforded, which was a couple of Par|taridges,
and a very good Di&s;h of &s;tew'd Oy|&s;ters;
they brought us up afterward, a Neats
Tongue and a Ham, that was almo&s;t cut quite
down, but we eat none of it, for the other was
fully enough for us both; and the Maid made
her Supper of the Oy&s;ters we had left, which
were enough.</P>
<P>I mention this, becau&s;e it &s;hould appear, I did
not treat her as a Per&s;on I was making any Court
to, for I had nothing of that in my Thoughts; but
meerly in Pity to the poor Woman, who I &s;aw
in a Circum&s;tance that was indeed very un|happy.</P>
<P>WHEN I gave her Maid Notice that Supper
was ready, &s;he fetch'd her Mi&s;tre&s;s, coming in
before her, with a Candle in her Hand; and
then it was that I &s;aw her Face, and being in
her <HI>Di&s;abille,</HI> &s;he had no Hoods over her Eyes,
or Black upon her Head, when I was truly &s;ur|prized,
to &s;ee one of the mo&s;t beautiful Faces
upon Earth: I &s;aluted her, and led her to the
Fire-&s;ide; the Table tho' &s;pread being too far
from the Fire, the Weather being Cold.</P>
<P>SHE was now &s;omething Sociable, tho' very
grave, and &s;ighing often, on Account of her
Circum&s;tances; but &s;he &s;o hand&s;omly govern'd
<PB N="305" REF="311">
her Grief, yet &s;o artfully made, it mingle it
&s;elf with all her Di&s;cour&s;e, that it added ex|ceedingly
to her Behaviour, which was every way
mo&s;t exqui&s;itely Genteel: I had a great deal of
Di&s;cour&s;e with her, and upon many Subjects, and
by degrees took her Name; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> from
her &s;&s;elf, as I had before from her Maid, al&s;o the
Place where &s;he liv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> near <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> or ra|ther
<HI>Stepney,</HI> where I ask'd her leave to pay her
a Vi&s;it, when &s;he thought fit to admit Company,
which &s;he &s;eemed to intimate would not be a great
while.</P>
<P>IT is a Subject too &s;urfeiting to entertain
People with the Beauty of a Per&s;on they will
never &s;ee; let it &s;uffice to tell them &s;he was the
mo&s;t beautiful Creature of her Sex, that I ever
&s;aw before, or &s;ince; and it cannot be wondered
if I was charm'd with her, the very fir&s;t Moment I
&s;ee her Face: Her behaviour was likewi&s;e a Beau|ty
in it&s;elf, and was &s;o extraordinary, that I can|not
&s;ay I can de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>THE next day &s;he was much more free than
&s;he was that fir&s;t Night, and I had &s;o much Con|ver&s;ation
as to enter into particulars of things on
both &s;ide, sal&s;o &s;he gave me leave to come and &s;ee
her Hou&s;e, which however, I did not do under a
fortnight, or thereabouts, becau&s;e I did not know
how far &s;he would di&s;pen&s;e with the Ceremony,
which it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep up at the begin|ning
of her Mourning.</P>
<P>HOWEVER I came as a Man that had Bu&s;ine&s;s
with her, relating to the Ship her Husband was
dead out of, and the fir&s;t time I came was ad|mitted;
and in &s;hort, the fir&s;t time I came I made
Love to her; &s;he receiv'd that Propo&s;al with di&s;|dain,
I cannot indeed &s;ay &s;he treated me with a|ny
<PB N="306" REF="312">
di&s;re&s;pect; but &s;he &s;aid, &s;he abhorr'd the of|fer,
and would hear no more of it.</P>
<P>HOW I came to make &s;uch a Propo&s;al to her,
I &s;carce knew then, tho' it was very much my
Intention from the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I enquir'd into her Cir|cum&s;tances,
and her Character, and heard no|thing
but what was very agreeable of them both;
and above all, I found &s;he had the Report of the
be&s;t humoured Lady, and the be&s;t bred of all
that part of the Town; and now I thought I
had found what I had &s;o often wi&s;h'd for, to
make me happy, and had twice mi&s;carry'd in,
and re&s;olv'd not to mi&s;s her, if it was po&s;&s;ible to
obtain her.</P>
<P>IT came indeed, a little into my Thoughts,
that I was a marry'd Man, and had a &s;econd Wife
alive, who tho' &s;he was fal&s;e to me, and a Whore,
yet I was not legally divorc'd from her, and that
&s;he was my Wife for all that; but I &s;oon got
over that part; for fir&s;t, as &s;he was a Whore,
and the Marqui&s;s had confe&s;s'd it to me, I was
divorc'd in Law, and I had Power to put her away;
but having had the Misfortune of fighting a Duel,
and being oblig'd to quit the Country, I could not
claim the legal Proce&s;s, which was my Right,
and therefore might conclude my &s;elf as much
divorc'd, as if it had been actually done, and
&s;o that Scruple vani&s;h'd.</P>
<P>I &s;uffer'd now two Months to run, without
pre&s;&s;ing my Widow any more, only I had kept
a &s;trict Watch to find if any one el&s;e pretend|ed
to her; at the end of two Months I Vi&s;ited her
again, when I found &s;he receiv'd me with more
Freedom, and we had no more Sighs, and Sobbs
about the la&s;t Husband; and tho' &s;he would not
<PB N="307" REF="313">
let me pre&s;s my former Propo&s;al, &s;o far as I
thought I might have done, yet I found I had leave
to come again, and it was the Article of Decency,
which &s;he &s;tood upon, as much as any thing, that I
was not di&s;agreeable to her, and that my u&s;ing
her &s;o hand&s;omely upon the Road, had given me a
great Advantage in her Favour.</P>
<P>I went on gradually with her, and gave her
leave to &s;tand off for two Months more; but
then I told her the matter of Decency, which was
but a Ceremony, was not to &s;tand in Competition
with the matter of Affection; and in &s;hort, I
could not bear any longer delay, but that if &s;he
thought fit we might Marry privately, and to
cut the Story &s;hort, as I did my Court&s;hip, in
about five Months I got her in the Mind, and
we were privately Married, and that with &s;o
very exact a Concealment, that her Maid that was
&s;o In&s;trumental in it, yet had no Knowledge of
it for near a Month more.</P>
<P>I was now not only in my Imagination, but in
reallity the mo&s;t happy Creature in the World;
as I was &s;o infinitely &s;atisfy'd with my Wife, was
indeed the be&s;t humour'd Woman in the World, a
mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd beautiful Creature indeed, per|fectly
well Bred, and had not one ill Quality a|bout
her, and this happine&s;s continu'd without
the lea&s;t Interruption for about &s;ix Year.</P>
<P>BUT I, that was to be the mo&s;t unhappy Fel|low
alive in the Article of Matrimony, had at
la&s;t a Di&s;appointment of the wor&s;t &s;ort, even
here; I had three fine Children by her, and in her
time of her lying inn with the la&s;t, &s;he got &s;ome
Cold, that &s;he did not in a long time get off, and
in &s;hort &s;he grew very &s;ickly: In being &s;o conti|nually
ill, and out of Order, &s;he very unhappily
<PB N="308" REF="314">
got a Habit of drinking Cordials and hot Liquors;
Drink, like the Devil, when it gets hold of any
one, tho' but a little, it goes on by little and little
to their De&s;truction; &s;o in my Wife, her Stomach
being weak and faint, &s;he fir&s;t took this Cordial,
then that, till in &s;hort, &s;he could not live with|out
them, and from a Drop to a Sup, from
a Sup to a Dram, from a Dram to a Gla&s;s, and
&s;o on to Two, till at la&s;t, &s;he took in &s;hort, to
what we call drinking.</P>
<P>AS I likened Drink to the Devil, in its gradu|al
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Habits and Per&s;on, &s;o it is yet
more like the Devil in its Encroachment on us,
where it gets hold of our Sences; in &s;hort, my
beautiful, good humour'd, mode&s;t, well bred
Wife, grew a Bea&s;t, a Slave to Strong Liquor, and
would be drunk at her own Table, nay, in her
own Clo&s;et by her &s;elf; till in&s;tead of a well
made, fine Shape, &s;he was as Fat as an Ho&s;te&s;s;
her fine Face bloated and blotch'd, had not &s;o
much as the Ruins of the mo&s;t beautiful Per&s;on
alive; nothing remain'd but a good Eye, that in|deed,
&s;he held to the la&s;t: In &s;hort, &s;he lo&s;t her
Beauty, her Shape, her Manners, and at la&s;t her
Virtue; and giving her &s;elf up to Drinking, kill'd
her &s;elf in about a Year and a half, after &s;he fir&s;t
began that cur&s;ed Trade; in which Time &s;he twice
was expo&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;candalous manner, with
a Captain of a Ship, who like a Villain, took the
Advantage of her being in Drink, and not know|ing
what &s;he did; but it had this unhappy Effect,
that in&s;tead of her being a&s;ham'd, and repenting
of it, when &s;he came to her &s;elf; it harden'd her
in the Crime, and &s;he grew as void of Mode&s;ty at
la&s;t as of Sobriety.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="315">
O! The Power of Intemperance! and how it
Encroaches on the be&s;t Di&s;po&s;itions in the World;
how it comes upon us gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly,
and what di&s;mal Effects it Works upon our Mo|rals,
changing the mo&s;t Virtuous, regular, well
in&s;tructed, and well inclin'd Tempers, into wor&s;e
than Brutal. That was a good Story, whether
real or invented, of the Devil tempting a young
Man to murder his Father. No, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> that was
un-natural. Why, then <HI>&s;ays the Devil,</HI> Go and

Well, Then, <HI>&s;ays the Devil,</HI> If you
will do nothing el&s;e to oblige me, go and get
Drunk; Ay, ay, <HI>&s;ays the Fellow,</HI> I'll do that, &s;o

when he was Drunk, he murdered his Father, and
lay with his Mother.</P>
<P>NEVER was a Woman more virtuous, mode&s;t,
cha&s;te, &s;ober, &s;he never &s;o much as de&s;ir'd to
drink any thing &s;trong; it was with the greate&s;t
entreaty, that I could prevail with her to drink
a Gla&s;s or two of Wine, and rarely, if ever, a|bove
one, or two at a time; even in Company,
&s;he had no Inclination to it; not an immode&s;t
Word ever came out of her Mouth, nor would &s;he
&s;uffer it in any one el&s;e, in her Hearing without
Re&s;entment and Abhorence: But upon that Weak|ne&s;s,
and Illne&s;s after her la&s;t Lying-Inn; as above
the Nur&s;e pre&s;s'd her, when ever &s;he found her &s;elf
faint, and a Sinking of her Spirits, to take this
Cordial and that Dram, to keep up her Spirits,
till it became nece&s;&s;ary even to keep her a-live,
and gradually increa&s;ed to a Habit, &s;o that it was
no longer her Phy&s;ick, but her Food; her Appe|tite
&s;unk and went quite away, and &s;he eat little

Height, that, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> &s;he would be Drunk in
her own Dre&s;&s;ing Room by Eleven a Clock in the
Morning; and in Short, at la&s;t was never &s;ober.</P>
<P>IN this Life of Helli&s;h Exce&s;s, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI>
She lo&s;t all that was before &s;o Valuable in her;
and a Villain, if it be proper to call a Man,
that was really a Gentleman, by &s;uch a Name,
who was an intimate Acquaintance coming to
pretend a Vi&s;it to her, made her and her Maid
&s;o Drunk together, that he lay with them both;
with the Mi&s;tre&s;s the Maid being in the Room,
and with the Maid, the Mi&s;tre&s;s being in the
Room; after which, he it &s;eems took the like Li|berty
with them both, as often as he thought fit,
'till the Wench being with Child, di&s;cover'd it for
her &s;elf, and for her Mi&s;tre&s;s too: Let any one
judge what was my Ca&s;e now; I that for &s;ix
Years thought my &s;elf the happye&s;t Man a live,
was now the mo&s;t mi&s;erable di&s;tracted Creature:
As to my Wife, I loved her &s;o well, and was &s;o
&s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;&s;a&s;ter of her Drinking, being
the Occa&s;ion of it all, that I could not re&s;ent
it to &s;uch a Degree as I had done in her Predece&s;&s;or;
but I pity'd her heartily; however, I put away
all her Servants, and almo&s;t lock'd her up; <HI>that
is to &s;ay,</HI> I &s;et new People over her, who would
not &s;uffer any one to come near her, without my
Knowledge.</P>
<P>BUT what to do with the Villain, that had
thus abu&s;ed both her and me, <HI>that was the Que&s;ti|on
that remain'd;</HI> to fight him upon equal Terms,
I thought, was a little hard; that after a Man
had treated me as he had done, he de&s;erv'd no
fair Play for his Life, &s;o I re&s;olv'd to wait
for him in <HI>Stepney</HI> Fields, and which Way he
often came Home pretty late, and Pi&s;tol him
<PB N="411" REF="317">
in the Dark, and if po&s;&s;ible, to let him know
what I Kill'd him for, before I did it: But when I
came to con&s;ider of this, it &s;hock'd my Temper too,
as well as Principle, and I could not be a Mur|derer;
whatever el&s;e I could be, or what ever I
was provok'd to be.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I re&s;olv'd on the other Hand, that
I would &s;everely correct him for what he had
done, and it was not long before I had an Oppor|tunity;
for hearing one Morning that he was
walking cro&s;s the Fields, from <HI>Stepney</HI> to <HI>Shadwel,</HI>
which Way I knew he often went; I waited
for his coming Home again, and fairly met
him.</P>
<P>I had not many Words with him, but told
him, I had long look'd for him; that he knew the
Villaniy he had been guilty of in my Family,
and he could not believe, &s;ince he knew al&s;o, that
I was fully inform'd of it; but that I mu&s;t be
a great Coward as well as a Cuckold, or that I
would re&s;ent it, and that it was now a very
proper Time to call him to an Account for it,
and therefore bad him, if he dur&s;t &s;how his Face
to what he had done, and defend the Name of
a Captain of a Man of War, <HI>as they &s;aid,</HI> he had
been, to draw.</P>
<P>HE &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd at the Thing, and began
to Parlee, and would le&s;&s;en the Crime of it; but
I told him it was not a time to talk that Way,
&s;ince he could not deny the Fact; and to le&s;&s;en the
Crime, was to lay it the more upon the Woman,
who, I was &s;ure if he had not fir&s;t debauch'd with
Wine, he could never have brought to the re&s;t;
and &s;eeing he refu&s;ed to draw, I knock'd him
down with my Cane at one Blow; and I would
not &s;trike him again while he lay on the Ground,
<PB N="312" REF="318">
but waited to &s;ee him recover a little, for I &s;aw
plainly he was not kill'd; in a few Minutes he
came to him&s;elf again, and then I took him fa&s;t
by one Wri&s;t, and can'd him as &s;everely as I
was able, and as long as I could hold it, for want
of Breath, but forbore his Head, becau&s;e I was re|&s;olv'd
he &s;hould feel it; in this Condition at
la&s;t he begg'd for Mercy, but I was Deaf to all
Pitty a great while, till he roar'd out like a Boy
&s;oundly whipt; then I took his Sword from him,
and broke it before his Face, and left him on the
Ground, giving him two or three Kicks on the
Back-&s;ide, and bad him go and take the Law of
me, if he thought fit.</P>
<P>I had now as much Satisfaction, as indeed could
be taken of a Coward, and had no more to &s;ay
to him: But as I knew it would make a great
Noi&s;e about the Town, I immediately remov'd my
Family, and that I might be perfectly conceal'd,
went into the North of <HI>England,</HI> and liv'd in a
little Town called,&mdash;not far from <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI>
where I liv'd retir'd, and was no more heard of,
for about two Years. My Wife tho' more con|fin'd
than &s;he u&s;ed to be, and &s;o kept up from
the leu'd part; which I believe in the Intervals
of her Intemperance, &s;he was truly a&s;hamed of,
and abhor'd; yet retain'd the Drinking part,
which becoming <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for her
Sub&s;i&s;tance, &s;he &s;oon ruin'd her health, and in a|bout
a Year and a half after my Removal into the
<HI>North</HI> &s;he died.</P>
<P>THUS I was once more a free Man, and as one
would think, &s;hould by this time, have been ful|ly
&s;atisfy'd that Matrimony was not appointed
to be a State of Felicity to me.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="319">
I &s;hould have mention'd, that the Villain of a
Captain, who I had drub'd, <HI>as above,</HI> pretended to
make a great Stir about my a&s;&s;aulting him on the
High-Way, and that I had fallen upon him with
three Ruffians with an Intent to murther him, and
this began to obtain Belief among the People
in the Neighbourhood: I &s;ent him Word of &s;o
much of it as I had heard, and told him I hoped
it did not come from his own Mouth, but if it
did, I expected he would publickly di&s;own it, he
him&s;elf declaring he knew it to be fal&s;e; or el&s;e
that I &s;hould be forced to act the &s;ame thing over
again, till I had di&s;ciplin'd him into better Man|ners;
and that he might be a&s;&s;ured, that if he
continued to pretend that I had any Body with
me when I caned him, I would publi&s;h the whole
Story in Print, and be&s;ides that, would Cane
him again where ever I met him, and as often as
I met him, till he thought fit to defend him&s;elf
with his Sword like a Gentleman.</P>
<P>HE gave me no An&s;wer to this Letter, and
the Satisfaction I had for that was, that I gave
twenty or thirty Copies of it about among the
Neighbours, which made it as publick as if I had
printed it, (that is, as to his Acquaintance, and mine)
and made him &s;o hi&s;s'd at, and hated, that he
was obliged to remove, into &s;ome other part of
the Town, whither, I did not enquire.</P>
<P>MY Wife being now dead, I knew not what
Cour&s;e to take in the World, and I grew &s;o di&s;|con&s;olate
and di&s;couraged, that I was next Door
to being di&s;tempered, and &s;ometimes indeed, I
thought my &s;elf a little touch'd in my Head. But
it proved nothing but Vapours, and the Vexation
of this Affair, and in about a Years time, or there
abouts, it wore off again.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="320">
I had rambl'd up and down in a mo&s;t di&s;con|tented
un&s;ettled Po&s;ture after this, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> about
a Year, and then I con&s;ider'd I had three innocent
Children, and I could take no Care of them, and
that I mu&s;t either go away and leave them to the
wide World, or &s;ettle here, and get &s;ome Body to
look after them, and that better a Mother-in-Law,
than no Mother, for to live &s;uch a wandring Life,
it would not do: So I re&s;olved, I would marry as
any thing offer'd, tho' it was mean, and the
meaner the better; I concluded my next Wife
&s;hould be only taken as an upper Servant, <HI>that
is to &s;ay,</HI> a Nur&s;e to my Children, and a Hou&s;e|keeper
to my &s;elf, and let her be whore or hone&s;t

things went.</P>
<P>IN this carele&s;s, and indeed, ra&s;h fooli&s;h Hu|mour,

Woman, my Children will be taken care of; if
&s;he be a Slut and abu&s;es me, as I &s;ee every Body
does; I'll Kidnap her and &s;end her to <HI>Virginia</HI>
to my Plantations there, and there &s;he &s;hall work
hard enough, and fare hard enough to keep her
Cha&s;t, I'll warrant her.</P>
<P>I knew well enough at fir&s;t, that the&s;e were
mad, hare-brain'd Notions, and I thought no more
of being &s;erious in them, than I thought of being
a Man in the Moon: But I know not how it hap|pen'd
to me; I rea&s;on'd and talk'd to my &s;elf in

this I thought of it, I believe four Months mo&s;t
&s;eriou&s;ly before I re&s;olv'd, and that very Pru|dence
&s;poil'd the whole thing; however, at la&s;t
being re&s;olv'd, I took Mrs. <HI>Margaret</HI> one Day
as &s;he pa&s;s'd by my Parlour door, call'd her in, and
told her I wanted to &s;peak with her; &s;he came rea|dily
in, but blu&s;h'd mightily, when I bad her fit
down, for I bad her &s;it down in a Chair ju&s;t by me.</P>
<P>I Us'd no great Ceremony with her, but told
her that I had ob&s;erv'd &s;he had been mighty kind
to my Children, and was very tende to them,
and that they all lov'd her, and that if &s;he and
I could agree about it; I intended to make her their
Mother, if &s;he was not engag'd to &s;ome Body el&s;e;
the Girl &s;at &s;till, and &s;aid never a Word, <HI>till I &s;aid
tho&s;e Words,</HI> if &s;he was not engag'd to &s;ome Body
el&s;e; however, I took no Notice of it, other than
this, look ye <HI>Moggy, &s;aid</HI> I; &s;o they call them
in the Country, if you have promis'd your|&s;elf
you mu&s;t tell me; for we all knew that a
young Fellow, a good Clergyman's wicked Son,
had hung about her a great while, two or three
Year, and made Love to her, but could never get
the Girl in the Mind it &s;eems to have him.</P>
<P>SHE knew I was not ignorant of it, and there|fore
after her fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e was over, &s;he told me
Mr.&mdash;had as I knew often come after
her, but &s;he had never promis'd him any thing, an
had for &s;everal Years refus'd him; her Father al|ways
telling her that he was a wicked Fellow, and
the he would be her Ruin if &s;he had him.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>Moggy,</HI> then, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> what do&s;t &s;ay to
me, art thou free to make me a Wife? She blu&s;h'd
and look'd down upon the Ground, and would not
&s;peak a good while, but when I pre&s;s'd her to
tell me, &s;he look'd up, <HI>and &s;aid &s;he,</HI> &s;uppos'd I was
but Je&s;ting with her; well, I got over that, and
<PB N="317" REF="323">
told her, I was in very good earne&s;t with her, and
I took her for a &s;ober, hone&s;t, mode&s;t Girl, and
as, <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> one that my Children lov'd mighty
well, and I was in earne&s;t with her, if &s;he would
give me her Con&s;ent: I would give her my Word,
that I would have her, and we would be married
to morrow Morning; &s;he look'd up again at that,
and &s;mil'd a little, and &s;aid no, that was too &s;oon
too, to &s;ay yes; &s;he hop'd I would give her &s;ome
time to Con&s;ider of it, and to talk with her
Father about it.</P>
<P>I told he &s;he needed not much time to Con&s;i|der
about it, but however, I would give her till to
morrow Morning, which was a great while; by
this time I had ki&s;s'd <HI>Moggy</HI> two or three times,
and &s;he began to be freer with me, and when I
pre&s;s'd her to Marry me the next Morning, &s;he
laugh'd and told me it was not lucky, to be mar|ried
in her old Cloths.</P>
<P>I &s;topp'd her Mouth pre&s;ently with that, and
told her &s;he &s;hould not be married in her old
Cloths, for I would give her &s;ome new; <HI>ay, it may
be afterwards</HI> &s;ays <HI>Moggy,</HI> and laugh'd again: No,
ju&s;t now, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> come along with me <HI>Moggy;</HI> &s;o
I carried her up Stairs into my Wive's Room that
was, and &s;hew'd her a new Morning Gown of my
Wives, that &s;he had never worn above two or three
times, and &s;everal other fine things; look you there
<HI>Moggy, &s;ays I,</HI> there's a Wedding Gown for you,
give me your Hand uow that you will have me to
morrow Morning, and as to your Father, you
know he is gone to <HI>Liverpool</HI> on my Bu&s;ine&s;s, but
I will an&s;wer for it, he &s;hall not be angry when
he comes Home to call his Ma&s;ter Son-in-law,
and I ask him no Portion; therefore give me thy
Hand for it <HI>Moggy, &s;ays I,</HI> very merrily to her,
<PB N="318" REF="324">
and ki&s;s'd her again, and the Girl gave me her
Hand, and very plea&s;antly too, and I was mightily
pleas'd with it, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>THERE liv'd about three Doors from us, an
antient Gentleman, who pa&s;s'd for a Doctor
of Phy&s;ick, but who was really a <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t
in Orders, as there are many in that Part of the
Country, and in the Evening I &s;ent to &s;peak
with him: He knew that I under&s;tood his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
and that I had liv'd in Popi&s;h Countries,
and in a Word, believ'd me a <HI>Roman</HI> too, for I
was &s;uch Abroad: When he came to me, I told
him the occa&s;ion, for which I &s;ent for him, and
that it was to be to morrow Morning; he readi|ly
told me, if I would come, and &s;ee him in the
Evening, and bring <HI>Moggy</HI> with me, he would
Marry us in his own Study, and that it was
rather more Private to do it in the Evening,
than in the Morning; &s;o I call'd <HI>Moggy</HI> again to
me, and told her &s;ince &s;he and I had agreed
the Matter for to Morrow, it was as well to be
done over Night, and told her what the Doctor
had &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Moggy</HI> blu&s;h'd again, <HI>and &s;aid,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t go
Home fir&s;t, that &s;he could not be ready before to
Morrow; look ye <HI>Moggy, &s;ays I,</HI> you are my Wife
now, and you &s;hall never go away from me a
Maid, I know what you mean, you would go
Home to &s;hift you: Come <HI>Moggy, &s;ayes I,</HI> come
along with me again up Stairs, &s;o I carried her to
a Che&s;t of Linnen, where was &s;everal new &s;hifts
of my la&s;t Wives, which &s;he had never worn at
all, and &s;ome that had been worn, there's a clean
Smock for you <HI>Moggy, &s;ays I,</HI> and to Morrow
you &s;hall have all the re&s;t: When I had done this,
now <HI>Moggy, &s;ays I,</HI> go and Dre&s;s you; &s;o I
<PB N="319" REF="325">
lock'd her in, and went down Stairs; knock <HI>&s;ays
I,</HI> when you are Dre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ometime, <HI>Moggy</HI> did not knock, but
down &s;he came into my Room, compleatly dre&s;s'd,
for there were &s;everal other things that I bad her
take, and the Cloths fitted her, as if they had
been made for her, it &s;eems &s;he &s;lipt the Lock back.</P>
<P>WELL <HI>Moggy, &s;ays I,</HI> now you &s;ee you &s;han't
be marry'd in your old Cloaths, &s;o I took her
in my Arms, and ki&s;s'd her, and well plea&s;ed I
was, as ever I was in my Life, or with any thing
I ever did in my Life; as &s;oon as it was Dark,
<HI>Moggy</HI> &s;lip'd away before-hand, as the Doctor and
I had agreed, to the old Gentleman's Hou&s;e-keeper;
and I came in about half an Hour after,
and there we were marry'd in the Doctor's Study,
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> in his Oratory, or Chapel, a lit|tle
Room within his Study, and we &s;tay'd and
&s;upp'd with him afterward.</P>
<P>WHEN after a &s;hort Stay more, I went Home
fir&s;t, becau&s;e I would &s;end the Children all to
Bed, and the other Servants out of the Way, and
<HI>Moggey</HI> came &s;ome time after, and &s;o we lay to|gether
that Night; the next Morning I let all the
Family know that <HI>Moggy</HI> was my Wife; and my
three Children were rejoyc'd at it to the la&s;t
Degree: And now I was a marry'd Man a fourth
Time; and in &s;hort, I was really more happy
in this plain country Girl, than with any of all
the Wives I had, had: She was not Young, being
about three and Thirty, but &s;he brought me a
Son the fir&s;t Year; &s;he was very pretty, well
&s;hap'd, and of a merry chearful Di&s;po&s;ition, but
not a Beauty; &s;he was an admirable Family Ma|nager;
lov'd my former Children, and u&s;ed them
not at all the wor&s;e for having &s;ome of her own,
<PB N="320" REF="326">
in a Word, &s;he made me an excellent Wife; but
liv'd with me but four Year, and dy'd of a
Hurt &s;he got of a Fall while &s;he was with
Child, and in her I had a very great Lo&s;s in|deed.</P>
<P>AND yet &s;uch was my Fate in Wives, that after
all the Blu&s;hing, and Backwardne&s;s of Mrs.
<HI>Moggy</HI> at fir&s;t, Mrs. <HI>Moggy</HI> had, it &s;eems, made a
Slip in her younger Days, and was got with
Child ten Year before, by a Gentleman of a
great E&s;tate in that Country who promi&s;ed her
Marriage, and afterwards deferted her: But as
that had happen'd long before I came into the
Country, and the Child was dead and forgotten,
the People were &s;o good to her, and &s;o kind to
me, that hearing I hard marry'd her, no Body e|ver
&s;poke of it, neither did I ever hear of it, or
&s;u&s;pect it, till after &s;he was in her Grave, and
then it was of &s;mall Cone&s;quence to me one way
or other and &s;he was a faithful, virtuous, obliging
Wife, to me. I had very &s;evere Affliction in|deed,
while &s;he lived with me, for the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI>
a frightful Di&s;temper in that Country,
broke into my Family, and carry'd off three of
my Children, and a Maid Servant; &s;o that I
had only one of my former Wives, and one
by my <HI>Moggy,</HI> the fir&s;t a Son, the la&s;t a
Daughter.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things were in agitation, came
on the Inva&s;ion of the Scots, and the Fight at
<HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and I have cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Memory of
my <HI>Moggy,</HI> for I was all on Fire on that Side,
and ju&s;t going away with Hor&s;e and Arms, to
joyn the Lord <HI>Darwentwater,</HI> but <HI>Moggy</HI> begg'd
me off, <HI>as I may call it,</HI> and hung about me
&s;o, with her Tears and Importunities that I
<PB N="321" REF="327">
&s;at &s;till and look'd on, for which I had Rea&s;on
to be thankful.</P>
<P>I was really a &s;orrowful Father, and the lo&s;s
of my Children, &s;tuck clo&s;e to me, but the lo&s;s
of my Wife &s;tuck clo&s;er to me than all the re&s;t,
nor was my grief le&s;&s;en'd, or my kinde&s;t Thoughts
abated in the lea&s;t by the Account I heard of
her former Mi&s;carriages, &s;eeing they were &s;o
long before I knew her, and were not di&s;cover'd
by me or to me in her life time.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e things put together made me very
Comfortle&s;s: And now I thought Heaven &s;ummon'd
me to retire to <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Place, and as I may
&s;ay, the only Place I had been ble&s;s'd at, or had met
with any thing that de&s;erv'd the Name of Suc|ce&s;s
in, and where indeed my Affairs being in good
Hands, the Plantations were encreas'd to &s;uch a
Degree, that &s;ome Years my return here made up
eight Hundred Pound, and one Year almo&s;t a
Thou&s;and, &s;o I re&s;olv'd to leave my native
Country once more, and taking my Son with me,
and leaving <HI>Moggy</HI>'s Daughter with her Grand|father,
I made him my principal Agent, left him
con&s;iderable in his Hands, for the Maintenance of
the Child, and left my Will in his Hand, by
which, if I died before I &s;hould otherwi&s;e Pro|vide
for her, I left her 2000 <HI>l.</HI> Portion to be
paid by my Son out of the E&s;tate I had in <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI>
and the whole E&s;tate if he died unmarried.</P>
<P>I embark'd for <HI>Virginia,</HI> in the Year&mdash;, at
the Town of <HI>Leverpool,</HI> and had a tollerable Voy|age
thither, only that we met with a Pyrate Ship,
in the Latitude of 48 Degrees, who Plunder'd us of
every thing they could come at that was for their
turn, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> Provi&s;ions, Ammunition, &s;mall
Arms and Money; but to give the Rogues their
<PB N="322" REF="328">
Due, tho' they were the mo&s;t abandon'd Wretches
that were ever &s;een, they did not u&s;e us ill; and
as to my Lo&s;s, it was not con&s;iderable, the Car|go
which I had on Board, was in Goods, and was
of no u&s;e to them; nor could they come at tho&s;e
things without Rumaging the whole Ship, which
they did not think worth their while.</P>
<P>I found all my Affairs in very good order at
<HI>Virginia,</HI> my Plantations prodigiou&s;ly increas'd,
and my Manager, who fir&s;t in&s;pired me with
travelling Thoughts, and made me Ma&s;ter of
any Knowledge worth Naming, receiv'd me with
a tran&s;port of Joy, after a Ramble of four and
Twenty Years.</P>
<P>I ought to remember it to the encouragement
of all faithful Servants, that he gave me an Ac|count,
which I believe was critically Ju&s;t, of the
whole Affair of the Plantations, each by them|&s;elves;
and Ballanc'd in Years, every Years pro|duce,
being fully tran&s;mitted; Charges deducted
to my Order at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I was exceedingly &s;atisfy'd, as I had good Rea|&s;on
indeed with his Management, and with his Ma|nagement,
as much in its degree of his Own, I can
&s;afely &s;ay it: He had Improv'd a very large Planta|tion
of his own at the &s;ame time, which he began
upon the Foot of the Countries Allowance of
Land, and the Encouragement he had from me.</P>
<P>WHEN he had given me all this plea&s;ing a|greeable
Account you will not think it &s;trange,
that I had a de&s;ire to &s;ee the Plantations, and
to View all the Servants, which in both the Works
were upwards of three hundred; and as my Tu|tor
generally bought &s;ome every Fleet that came
from <HI>England,</HI> I had the Mortification to &s;ee two
or three of the <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Gentlemen there, who being
<PB N="323" REF="329">
Pri&s;oners of War, were &s;par'd from the pub|lick
Execution, and &s;ent over for to that Sla|very,
which to Gentlemen mu&s;t be wor&s;e than
Death.</P>
<P>I do not mention what I did or &s;aid, relating
to them here, I &s;hall &s;peak at large of it, when
the re&s;t of them came over, which more nearly
concern'd me.</P>
<P>BUT one Circum&s;tance occurr'd to me here,
that equally &s;urpris'd me, and terrify'd me to the
la&s;t degree; looking over all the Servants, as I
&s;ay <HI>above,</HI> and viewing the Plantations narrow|ly
and frequently, I came one Day by a place
were &s;ome Women were at Work by them&s;elves:
I was &s;eriou&s;ly reflecting on the Mi&s;ery of human
Life, when I &s;aw &s;ome of tho&s;e poor Wretches;
thought I, they have perhaps liv'd gay, and plea|&s;antly
in the World, notwith&s;tanding, thro' a vari|ety
of Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they may have been brought to
this; and if a Body was to hear the Hi&s;tory of
&s;ome of them now, it would perhaps be as mo|ving,
and as &s;ea&s;onable a Sermon as any Mini|&s;ter
in the Country could Preach.</P>
<P>WHILE I was mu&s;ing thus, and looking at the
Women, on a &s;udden I heard a Combu&s;tion a|mong
other of the Women Servants, who were
almo&s;t behind me, in the &s;ame Work, and help was
call'd loudly for, one of the Women having &s;woon'd
away; they &s;aid &s;he would die immediately if
&s;omething was not done to relieve her; I had no|thing
about me, but a litle Bottle, which we al|ways
carried about us there with Rum, to give
any Servant a Dram that merited that Favour; &s;o
I turn'd my Hor&s;e and went up towards the
Place; but as the poor Creature was lying flat
on the Ground, and the re&s;t of the Women Ser|vants
<PB N="324" REF="330">
about her, I did not &s;ee her, but gave them
the Bottle, and they rubb'd her Temples with it,
and with much a do brought her to Life, and gave
her a little to Drink; but &s;he could Drink none
of it, and was exceeding ill afterwards; &s;o that
&s;he was carried to the Infirmary, &s;o they call it
in the Religious Hou&s;es in <HI>Italy,</HI> where the &s;ick
Nuns or Friers, are carried; but here in <HI>Virginia,</HI>
I think they &s;hould call it the Condemn'd-hole,
for it really was only a Place ju&s;t fit for People to
die in, not a Place to be cur'd in.</P>
<P>THE &s;ick Woman refu&s;ing to Drink, one of the
Women Servants brought me the Bottle again, and
I bad them Drink it among them, which had al|mo&s;t
&s;et them together by the Ears, for the Li|quor,
there being not enough to give every one
a Sup.</P>
<P>I went home to my Hou&s;e immediately, and re|flecting
on the mi&s;erable Provi&s;ion was wont to be
made for poor Servants, when they were &s;ick, I
inquir'd of my Manager, if it was &s;o &s;till? <HI>he &s;aid,</HI>
he believ'd mine was better than any in the Coun|try;
but he confe&s;s'd it was but &s;ad Lodging; how|ever,
<HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he would go and look after it imme|diately,
and &s;ee how it was.</P>
<P>HE came to me again, about an Hour after,
and told me the Woman was very ill, and fright|ed
with her Condition, that &s;he &s;eem'd to be very
Penitent, for &s;ome things in her pa&s;t Life, which
lay heavy upon her Mind, believing &s;he &s;hould
die; that &s;he ask'd him, if there was no Mini|&s;ter
to Comfort poor dying Servants; and he
told her, that &s;he knew they had no Mini&s;ter
nearer than &s;uch a Place, but that if &s;he liv'd till
Morning, he &s;hould be &s;ent for; he told me al&s;o,
that he had remov'd her into a Room where their
<PB N="325" REF="331">
chief Workman us'd to Lodge; that he had gi|ven
her a pair of Sheets, and every thing he
could, that he thought &s;he wanted, and had ap|pointed
another Woman Servant to tend her, and
&s;it up with her.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> that's well, for I cannot bear
to have poor Creatures lye and peri&s;h, by the
meer Hard&s;hip of the Place they are in, when
they are Sick, and want help; be&s;ides, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> &s;ome
of tho&s;e unfortunate Creatures, they call Con|victs,
may be People that have been tenderly
brought up, really Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> this poor Creature
I always &s;aid had &s;omething of a Gentlewo|man
in her, I could &s;ee it by her Behaviour, and
I have heard the other Women &s;ay, that &s;he liv'd
very great once, and that &s;he had fifteeu Hun|dred
Pound to her Portion, and I dare &s;ay &s;he has
been a hand&s;ome Woman in her time, and &s;he has
a Hand as fine as a Ladies now; tho' it be Tan|ned
with the Weather; I dare &s;ay &s;he was never
brought up to Labour as &s;he does here, and &s;he
&s;ays to the re&s;t that it will kill her.</P>
<P>TRULY, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> it may be &s;o, and that may be
the Rea&s;on that &s;he faints under it; and, <HI>I added,</HI>
is there nothing you can put her to within Doors,
that may not be &s;o Laborious, and expo&s;e her to
&s;o much Heat and Cold; he told me <HI>yes,</HI> there
was; he could &s;et her to be the Hou&s;e-keeper, for
the Woman that lately was &s;uch, was out of her
Time, and was married and turn'd Planter. Why
then let her have it, &s;aid I, if &s;he Recovers, and in
the mean time go, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and tell her &s;o, per|haps
the Comfort of it may help Re&s;tore her.</P>
<P>HE did &s;o, and with that, taking good care of
her, and giving her good warm Dyet, the Wo|man
recover'd, and in a little time was Abroad
<PB N="326" REF="332">
again, for it was the meer Weight of Labour
and being expos'd to hard Lodging, and mean
Dyet, to one &s;o tenderly bred, that &s;truck her,
and &s;he fainted at her Work.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he was made Hou&s;e-Keeper, &s;he was
quite another Body; &s;he put all the Hou&s;hold
in &s;uch excellent Order, and manag'd their Pro|vi&s;ions
&s;o well, that my Tutor admir'd her Con|duct,
and would be every now and then, &s;peak|ing
of her to me; that &s;he was an excellent Mana|ger;
I'll warrant, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;he has been Bred a Gentle|woman,
and &s;he has been a fine Woman in her time
too: In a Word, he &s;aid &s;o many good things of her,
that I had a mind to &s;ee her; &s;o one Day I took oc|ca&s;ion
to go to the Plantation Hou&s;e, as they call'd
it and into a Parlour always re&s;erv'd for the Ma&s;ter
of the Plantation; there &s;he had Opportunity to
&s;ee me before I could &s;ee her, and as &s;oon as &s;he had
&s;een me, &s;he knew me; but indeed had I &s;een her
an Hundred times, I &s;hould not have known her &s;he
was it &s;eems in the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion, and Surprize
at &s;eeing who I was, that it was po&s;&s;ible for a|ny
one to be; and when I order'd my Manager to
bring her into the Room, he found her crying, and
beg'd him to excu&s;e her, that &s;he was frighted,
and &s;hould die away, if &s;he came near me.</P>
<P>I NOT imagining any thing, but that the
poor Creature was afraid of me, <HI>for Ma&s;ters in</HI>
Virginia <HI>are terrible things;</HI> bad him tell her &s;he
need to be under no Concern at my calling for
her, for it was not for any hurt, nor any Di&s;plea|&s;ure;
but that I had &s;ome Orders to give her;
&s;o having as he thought encourag'd her, <HI>tho' her
&s;urprize was of another kind,</HI> he brought her in;
when &s;he came in, &s;he held a Handkerchief in her
Hand, wiping her Eyes, as if &s;he had cry'd, Mrs.
<PB N="327" REF="333">
Hou&s;e-keeper, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> &s;peaking chearfully to her,
don't be concern'd at my &s;ending for you, I have
had a very good Account of your Management,
and I call'd for you, to let you know I am very
well pleas'd with it; and if it falls in my way to
do you any good, if your Circum&s;tances will al|low
it, I may be willing enough to help you out
of your Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>SHE made low Curti&s;ies, but &s;aid nothing,
however, &s;he was &s;o far encourag'd that &s;he took
her Hand from her Face, and I &s;aw her Face ful|ly,
and I believe &s;he did it, de&s;iring I &s;hould di&s;co|ver
who &s;he was, but I really knew nothing of
her any more, than if I had never &s;een her in my
Life; but went on as I thought to encourage her
as I us'd to do with any that I &s;aw de&s;erv'd it.</P>
<P>IN the mean time my Tutor, who was in the
Room went out on &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s or other, I know
not what; as &s;oon as he was gone, &s;he bur&s;t out
into a Pa&s;&s;ion, and falling down on her Knees ju&s;t
before me, O! Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I &s;ee you don't know
me, be merciful to me, I am your mi&s;erable
divorc'd Wife!</P>
<P>I WAS a&s;toni&s;h'd, I was frighted, I trembled
like one in an Ague, I was Speechle&s;s; in a Word,
I was ready to &s;ink, and &s;he fell flat on her Face,
and lay there, as if &s;he had been dead; I was
Speechle&s;s, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> as a Stone, I had only Pre|&s;ence
of Mind enough to &s;tep to the Door, and
fa&s;ten it, that my Tutor might not come in:
Then going back to her, I took her up, and &s;poke
comfortably to her, and told her, I no more knew
her, than if I had never &s;een her.</P>
<P>O! Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> Afflictions are dreadful
Things, &s;uch as I have &s;uffer'd have been enough
to alter my Countenance; but forgive <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> for
<PB N="328" REF="334">
God's &s;ake the Injuries I have done you! I have paid
dear for all my wickedne&s;s, and 'tis ju&s;t, 'tis right|eous
that God &s;hould bring me to your Foot, to ask
you Pardon for all my bruti&s;h doings: Forgive me
Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I be&s;eech you, and let me be your Slave
or Servant for it as long as I live; 'tis all I ask,
and with tho&s;e Words, &s;he fell upon her Knees
again, and cry'd &s;o vehemently, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
for her to &s;top it, or to &s;peak a Word
more: I took her up again, made her &s;it down,
de&s;ir'd her to Compo&s;e her&s;elf, and to hear what
I was going to &s;ay, tho' indeed it touch'd
me &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, I was hardly able to &s;peak any
more then &s;he was.</P>
<P>FIRST, I told her it was &s;uch a &s;urprize to me,
that I was not able to &s;ay much to her, <HI>and indeed
the Tears ran down my Face almo&s;t as fa&s;t as they did
on hers,</HI> I told her that I &s;hould only tell $word$
now, that as no Body had yet known any thing$
that had pa&s;s'd, &s;o it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary,
not a Word of it &s;hould be known, that it &s;hould
not be the wor&s;e for her, that &s;he was thus
thrown into my Hands again; but that I
could do nothing for her, if it was known, and
therefore that her future good, or ill Fortune
would depend upon her entire $$ncealing it, $hat
as my Manager would come in again pre&s;ently,
&s;he &s;hould go back to her part of th$ Hou&s;e; $word$
go on in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;he did before; $word$ I
would come to her, and talk more at large with her
in a Day or two; &s;o &s;he retir'd, after a&s;&s;uring me
that not a word of it &s;hould go out of her Mouth,
and indeed &s;he was willing to retire before my
Tutor came again, that he might not &s;ee the Ago|ny
&s;he was in.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="335">
I WAS &s;o perplex'd about this &s;urprizing
Incident, that I hardly knew what I did, or &s;aid
all that Night, nor was I come to any &s;ettled Re|&s;olution
in the Morning, what Cour&s;e to take in
it: However, in that Morning I call'd my Tutor,
and told him that I had been exceedingly con|cern'd
about the poor di&s;tre&s;s'd Creature, the
Hou&s;e-Keeper; that I had heard &s;ome of her
Story, which was very di&s;mal; that &s;he had been
in very good Circum&s;tances, and was bred very
well, and that I was glad he had remov'd her
Out of the Field into the Hou&s;e, but &s;till &s;he was
almo&s;t naked, and that I would have him go to
the Warehou&s;e, and give her &s;ome Linnen; e&s;pe|cially
Head Cloaths, and all &s;orts of &s;mall things,
&s;uch as Hoods, Gloves, Stockings, Shoes, Petty-Coats,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to let her chu&s;e for her &s;elf; al|&s;o,
a Morning-Gown of Callico, and a Mantua
of a better kind of Callico, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> to new
Cloa$$ her, which he did: But brought me
Word, that he found her all in Tears, and that
&s;he had cry'd all Night long, and in &s;hort, that
he believ'd, &s;he would indeed, cry her &s;elf to
Death; that all the while &s;he was receiving the
things he gave her, &s;he cry'd; that now and
then &s;he would &s;truggle with, and &s;top it, but
that then upon another Word &s;peaking, &s;he
would bur&s;t out again, &s;o that it griev'd every
Body that &s;aw her.</P>
<P>I WAS really affected with her Ca&s;e very
much, but &s;trugled hard with my &s;elf, to hide
it, and turn'd the Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;omething el&s;e,
in the mean time, tho' I did not go to her the
next Day, nor till the third Day, yet I &s;tudy'd
Day and Night, how to Act, and what I &s;hould
do in this remarkable Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="336">
WHEN I came to the Hou&s;e which was the third
Day, &s;he came into the Room I was in, cloath'd
all over with my Things, which I had ordered
her, and told me &s;he thank'd God, &s;he was now my
Servant again, and wore my Livery, thank'd me
for the Cloaths I had &s;ent her; and &s;aid it was
much more than &s;he had de&s;erv'd from me.</P>
<P>I then entered into Di&s;cour&s;es with her, <HI>no
Body being pre&s;ent but our &s;elves,</HI> and fir&s;t, <HI>I told
her,</HI> She &s;hould name no more of the unkind
things that had pa&s;t, for &s;he had humbled her&s;elf
more than enough on that Subject, and I would
never reproach her with any thing that was
pa&s;t; I found that &s;he had been the deepe&s;t
&s;ufferer by far, I told her it was impo&s;&s;ible
for me in my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances to receive
her there as a Wife, who came over as a Convict,
neither did &s;he know &s;o little, as to de&s;ire it.
But, <HI>I told her,</HI> I might be In&s;trumental to
put an End to her Misfortunes in the World,
and e&s;pecially to the mi&s;erable part of it;
which was her pre&s;ent Load, provided &s;he could
effectually keep her own Council, and never let
the particulars come out of her Mouth, and that
from the Day &s;he did, &s;he might date her irre|coverable
Ruin.</P>
<P>SHE was as &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity of that
Part, as I was, and told me all &s;he could claim
of me, would be only to deliver her from her
pre&s;ent Calamity, that &s;he was not able to
&s;upport, and that then if I plea&s;ed, &s;he might
live &s;uch a Life, as that &s;he might apply the re|&s;idue
of what time &s;he &s;hould have, wholly to
Repentance; that &s;he was willing to do the mean|e&s;t
Offices in the World for me, and tho' &s;he
&s;hould rejoyce to hear that I would forgive her
<PB N="331" REF="337">
former Life, yet that &s;he would not look any
higher than to be my Servant, as long as &s;he
liv'd, and in the mean time, I might be &s;atis|fy'd
&s;he would not let any Creature &s;o much as
know that I had ever &s;een her before.</P>
<P>I ASK'D her, if &s;he was willing to let me in|to
any Part of the Hi&s;tory of her Life, &s;ince &s;he
and I Parted, but I did not In&s;i&s;t upon it, o|therwi&s;e,
than as &s;he thought convenient; <HI>&s;he
&s;aid,</HI> as her Breach with me began fir&s;t in Folly,
and ended in Sin, &s;o her whole Life afterward,
was a continu'd Series of Callamity, Sin and
Sorrow, Sin and Shame, and at la&s;t Mi&s;ery; that
&s;he was deluded into Gay Company, and to an
expen&s;ive way of Living, which betray'd her
to &s;everal wicked Cour&s;es to &s;upport the Ex|pences
of it; that after a thou&s;and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es
and Difficulties, being not able to maintain her
&s;elf, &s;he was reduced to extreme Poverty.</P>
<P>THAT &s;he would many Times have humbled
her &s;elf to me in the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
manner in the World, being &s;incerely Penitent
for her fir&s;t Crime, but that &s;he could never hear
of me, nor which way I was gone; that &s;he was
by that Means &s;o abandon'd, that &s;he wanted
Bread, and tho&s;e Wants and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es brought
her into bad Company of another Kind, and
that &s;he fell in among a Gang of Thieves, with
whom &s;he Herded for &s;ometime, and got
Money enough a great while, but under the
greate&s;t Dread and Terror imaginable, being in
the con&s;tant Fear of coming to Shame, that
afterwards, what &s;he fear'd, was come upon her,
and for a very triffling Attempt, in which &s;he
was not Principal, but accidentally concern'd,
She was &s;ent to this Place: She told me, her
<PB N="332" REF="338">
Life was &s;uch a Collection of various Fortunes,
up and down, in Plenty, and in Mi&s;ery; in Pri|&s;on,
and at Liberty; at Ea&s;e, and in Torment;
that it would take up a great many Days to give
me a Hi&s;tory of it, that I was come to &s;ee the
End of it, as I had &s;een the be&s;t part of the Be|ginning,
that I knew &s;he was brought up tender|ly,
and fair'd delicately, but that now &s;he was
with the Prodigal, brought to de&s;ire Husks with
Swine and even to want that Supply: Her Tears
flow'd &s;o Strongly upon this Di&s;cour&s;e, that they
frequently interrupted her, &s;o that &s;he could not
go on without Difficulty; and at la&s;t could not go
on at all, &s;o I told her, I would excu&s;e her
telling any more of her Story at that Time; that
I &s;aw it was but a renewing of her Grief, and
that I would rather Contribute to her forgeting
what was pa&s;t, and de&s;ir'd her to &s;ay no more of
it, &s;o I broke off that Part.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, I told her, &s;ince Providence
had thus ca&s;t her upon my Hands again, I would
take Care that &s;he &s;hould not want, and that &s;he
&s;hould not live hardly neither, tho' I could go
no farther at pre&s;ent; and thus we parted for that
Time; and &s;he continu'd in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of
Hou&s;e keeper; only, that to ea&s;e her, I gave
her an A&s;&s;i&s;tant, and tho' I would not have it
call'd &s;o, it was neither more nor le&s;s than a
Servant to wait on her, and do every thing for
her, and told her to, that it was &s;o.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;he had been &s;ome time in this Place,
&s;he recover'd her Spirits, and grew chearful; her
fallen Fle&s;h plump'd up, and the &s;unk and hollow
parts fill'd again, &s;o that began to recover
&s;omething of that Brightne&s;s, and Charming Coun|tenance,
which was once &s;o very agreeable to
<PB N="333" REF="339">
me; and &s;ometimes I could not help having warm
De&s;ires towards her, and of taking her into her
fir&s;t Station again; but there were many Difficul|ties
occur'd, which I could not get over a great
while.</P>
<P>BUT in the mean time an other odd Accident
happen'd, which put me to a very great. Diffi|culty,
and more than I could have thought &s;uch
a thing could be capable of; my Tutor, a Man of
Wit and Learning, and Full of generous Princi|ples,
who was at fir&s;t mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion for
the Mi&s;ery of this Gentlewoman, and even then,
thought there were &s;omethings more than Com|mon
in her, as I have hinted: Now, when, as I
&s;ay, &s;he was recover'd, and her &s;prightly Temper
re&s;tor'd, and comforted, he was charm'd &s;o with
her Conver&s;ation, that in &s;hort, he fell in Love
with her</P>
<P>I hinted in my former Account of her,
that &s;he had a Charming Tongue, was Mi&s;tre&s;s
of abundance of Wit, that &s;he &s;ung incom|paribly
fine, and was perfectly well Bred,
the&s;e all remained with her &s;till, and made
her a very agreeable Per&s;on; and in &s;hort, he
came to me one Evening, and told me, that
he came to ask my Leave to let him marry the
Hou&s;e-keeper.</P>
<P>I WAS exceedingly perplex'd at this Propo&s;al,
but however, I gave him no Room to perceive
that; I told him, I hop'd he had con&s;ider'd
well of it, before he brought it &s;o far as to offer
it to me, and &s;uppos'd that he had agreed
that Point &s;o; that I had no Con&s;ent to give,
but as &s;he had almo&s;t four Year of her Time
to Serve.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="340">
HE an&s;wer'd no, he paid &s;uch a regard
to me, that he would not &s;o much as take one
&s;tep in &s;uch a thing without my Knowledge, and
a&s;&s;ur'd me, he had not &s;o much as mentioned it
to her; I knew not what an&s;wer indeed to make
to him, but at la&s;t I re&s;olv'd to put it off from
from my&s;elf to her, becau&s;e then I &s;hould have
opportunity to talk with her before hand; &s;o I
told him was perfectly free to act in the matter
as he thought fit; that I could not &s;ay either,
one thing or another to it, neither had I any
right to meddle in it; as to her &s;erving out her
time with me, that was a Trifle, and not worth
Naming; but I hop'd he would con&s;ider well e|very
Circum&s;tances before he entered upon &s;uch
an Affair as that.</P>
<P>HE told me he had fully con&s;ider'd it already,
and that he was re&s;olv'd, &s;eeing I was not again&s;t it,
to have her whatever came of it; for he believ'd
he &s;hould be the happie&s;t Man alive with her,
then he run on in his Character of her, how clever
a Woman &s;he was, in the management of all man|ner
of Bu&s;ine&s;s; how admirable Conver&s;ation &s;he
was; what a Wit, what a Memory, what a va&s;t
&s;hare of Knowledge, and the like; all which I
knew to be the Truth, and yet &s;hort of her ju&s;t
Character too; for as &s;he was all that formerly,
when &s;he was mine, &s;he was va&s;tly improv'd in
the School of Affliction, and was all the bright
Part, with a va&s;t Addition of Temper, Prudence,
Judgment, and all that &s;he formerly wanted.</P>
<P>I HAD not much Patiaence at you may well
imagine, till I &s;aw my hone&s;t Hou&s;e-keeper to
communicate this Secret to her, and to &s;ee what
Cour&s;e &s;he would &s;teer on &s;o nice an Occa&s;ion; but
I was &s;uddenly taken &s;o ill with a Cold, which held
<PB N="335" REF="341">
for two Days, that I could not &s;tir out of Doors
and in this time the matter was all done, and
over, for my Tutor had gone the &s;ame Night, and
made his attack, but was coldly receiv'd at fir&s;t,
which very much &s;urpris'd him, for he made no
doubt to have her con&s;ent at fir&s;t Word; how|ever,
the next Day he came again, and again the
third Day, when finding he was in earne&s;t, and yet
that &s;he could not think of any thing of that kind;
&s;he told him in few Words that &s;he thought her&s;elf
greatly oblig'd to him for &s;uch a Te&s;timony of his
Re&s;pect to her, and &s;hould have embrac'd it willing|ly,
as any Body would &s;uppo&s;e one in her Circum|&s;tances
&s;hould do, but that &s;he would not abu&s;e him
&s;o much; for that &s;he mu&s;t acknowledg to him, &s;he
was under Obligations that prevented her, that
was, in &s;hort, that &s;he was a married Woman, and
and had a Husband alive.</P>
<P>THIS was &s;o &s;incere, but &s;o Effectual an An|&s;wer,
that he could have no room to reply one Word
to it; but that he was very &s;orry, and that it
was a very great Affiction to him, and as a great
Di&s;appointment as ever he met with.</P>
<P>THE next Day after he had received this re|pul&s;e
I came to the Plantation Hou&s;e, and &s;end|ing
for the Hou&s;e-keeper, I began with her, and
told her that I under&s;tood &s;he would have a very
advantageous Propo&s;al made to her, and that
I would have her Con&s;ider well of it, and then
told her what my Tutor had &s;aid to me.</P>
<P>SHE immediately fell a crying, at which I
&s;eem'd to wonder very much, O! Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI>
how can you Name, &s;uch a thing to me? I told
her that I could Name it the better to her,
becau&s;e I had been married my&s;elf &s;ince I part|ed
from her: Yes Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> but the Ca&s;e
<PB N="336" REF="342">
alters, the Crime being on my Side, I ought not
to Marry; but, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> that is not the Rea&s;on at
all, but I cannot do it; I pretended to pre&s;s her
to it, (tho' not &s;incerely I mu&s;t acknowledge, for
my heart had turned toward her for &s;ome time,
and I had fully forgiven her in my Mind all her
former Conduct) but, I &s;ay, I &s;eem'd to pre&s;s her
to it, at which &s;he bur&s;t out in a Pa&s;&s;ion, no, no,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> let me be your Slave rather than the be&s;t
Man's Wife in the World: I rea&s;on'd with her up|on
her Circum&s;tances, and how &s;uch a Marriage
would re&s;tore her to a State of Ea&s;e and Plenty,
and none in the World might ever know or &s;u&s;|pect
who or what &s;he had been, but &s;he could
not bear it; but with Tears again rai&s;ing her
Voice, that I was affraid &s;he would be heard. I
be&s;eech you, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> do not &s;peak it any more,
I was once yours, and I will never belong to any
Man el&s;e in the World; let me be as I am, or a|ny
thing el&s;e you plea&s;e to make me, but not a
Wife, to any Man alive but your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was &s;o mov'd with the Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he was in at
&s;peaking this, that I knew not what I &s;aid or did
for &s;ometime, at length, I &s;aid to her, it is great
pity, you had not long ago been as &s;incere as you
are now; it had been better for us both; however,
as it is, you &s;hall not be forc'd to any thing again&s;t
your Mind; nor &s;hall you be the wor&s;e treated
for refu&s;ing. But how will you put him off? no
doubt he expects you will receive his Propo&s;al, as
an Advantage, and as he &s;ees no farther into your
Circum&s;tances; &s;o it is. O, Sir, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I have
done all that already; he has his An&s;wer, and is
fully &s;atisfy'd; he will never trouble you any more
on that Head, and then &s;he told me what an&s;wer
&s;he had given him.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="343">
FROM that minute I re&s;olv'd that I would
certainly take her again to be my Wife as before,
I thought &s;he had fully made me amends for
her former ill Conduct, and &s;he de&s;erv'd to be
forgiven; and &s;o indeed &s;he did, if ever Woman
did, con&s;idering al&s;o, what dreadful Pennance &s;he
had undergone, and how long &s;he had liv'd in Mi|&s;ery
and Di&s;tre&s;s; and that Providence had, as it
were ca&s;t her upon me again, and above all, had
given her &s;uch an Affection to me, and &s;o re&s;olv'd
a Mind that &s;he could refu&s;e &s;o hand&s;ome an offer
of Deliverance, rather than be farther &s;eparated
from me.</P>
<P>AS I re&s;olved this in my Mind, &s;o I thought
it was cruel to conceal it any longer from her;
nor indeed, could I contain my &s;elf any longer,
but I took her in my Arms; well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you
have given me &s;uch a Te&s;timony of Affection in
this, that I can no longer with&s;tand; I forgive
you all that ever was between us on this Ac|count,
and &s;ince you will be no Body's but
mine, you &s;hall be mine again, as you were
at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT this was too much for her the other
way, and now &s;he was &s;o far over-come with
my yielding to her, that had &s;he not got
Vent to her Pa&s;&s;ion by the mo&s;t Vehe|ment
Crying, &s;he mu&s;t have dy'd in my Arms,
and I was forc'd to let her go, and &s;et her down
in a Chair, where &s;he cry'd for a Quarter of
an Hour, before &s;he could &s;peak a Word.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he was come to her &s;elf enough to
talk again, I told her we mu&s;t con&s;ider of a
Method how to bring this to pa&s;s; and that it
mu&s;t not be done by publi&s;hing there, that &s;he
was my Wife before, for that would expo&s;e us
<PB N="338" REF="344">
both, but that I would openly marry her again;
this &s;he agreed was very rational, and according|ly,
about two Months after, we were marry'd
again, and no Man in the World ever enjoy'd a
better Wife, or liv'd more happy than we both
did for &s;everal Years after.</P>
<P>AND now I began to think my Fortunes were
&s;ettled for this World, and I had nothing before
me, but to fini&s;h a Life of infinite Variety, &s;uch
as mine had been with a comfortable Retreat, be|ing
both made wi&s;er by our Sufferings and Diffi|culties,
and able to judge for our &s;elves, what
kind of Life would be be&s;t adapted to our pre|&s;ent
Circum&s;tances, and in what Station we
might look upon our &s;elves to be mo&s;t compleat|ly
happy.</P>
<P>BUT Man is a &s;hort &s;ighted Creature at be&s;t,
and in nothing more than in that of fixing his
own Felicity; or, <HI>as we may &s;ay,</HI> choo&s;ing for
him&s;elf: One would have thought, and &s;o my
Wife often &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that the State of
Life that I was now in, was as perfectly calcu|lated
to make a Man compleatly happy, as any
private Station in the World could be: We had
an E&s;tate more than &s;ufficient, and daily en|crea&s;ing,
for the &s;upporting any State or Figure
that in that Place we could propo&s;e to our &s;elves,
or even de&s;ire to live in: We had every thing
that was Plea&s;ant and agreeable, without the
lea&s;t Mortification in any Circum&s;tances of it;
every &s;weet thing, and nothing to embitter it;
every Good, and no mixture of Evil with it;
nor any Gap open, where we could have the
lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions of any Evil breaking out upon
us; nor indeed, was it ea&s;ie for either of us in
our mo&s;t phlegmatick melancholly Notions, to
<PB N="339" REF="345">
have the lea&s;t Imagination how any thing di&s;|&s;a&s;trous
could happen to us in the common Cour&s;e
of Things, unle&s;s &s;omething &s;hould be fall us
out of the ordinary way of Providence, or of
its actings in the World.</P>
<P>BUT an un&s;een Mine blew up all this apparent
Tranquility at once, and tho' it did not remove
my Affairs there from me, yet it effectually
remov'd me from them, and &s;ent me a wandring
into the World again; a Condition full of Ha|zards,
and always attended with Circum&s;tances
dangerous to Mankind, while he is left to choo&s;e
his own Fortunes, and be guided by his own
&s;hort &s;ighted Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now return to a Circum&s;tance of my
Hi&s;tory, which had been pa&s;t for &s;ome Time,
and which relates to my Conduct, while I was
la&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I mention'd how my faithful Wife <HI>Moggy,</HI>
with her Tears, and her Entreaties had prevail'd
with me not to play the Mad-man, and openly
joyn in the Rebellion with the late Lord <HI>Derwent|water,</HI>
and his Party, when they enter'd <HI>Lanca&s;hire;</HI>
and thereby, <HI>as I may &s;ay,</HI> &s;av'd my Life. But my
Curio&s;ity prevail'd &s;o much at la&s;t, that I gave her
the Slip when they came to <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and at lea&s;t
thought I would go and look at them, and &s;ee
what they were likely to come to.</P>
<P>MY former Wife's importunities, <HI>as above,</HI> had
indeed prevail'd with me from publickly em|barking
in that Enterpri&s;e and joyning openly,
with them in Arms; and by this, as I have ob|&s;erv'd,
&s;he &s;av'd my Life to be &s;ure, becau&s;e I
had then publickly e&s;pou&s;ed the Rebellion,
and had been known to have been among
<PB N="340" REF="346">
them, which might have been as fatal to me
afterwards, tho' I had not been taken in the
Action, as if I had.</P>
<P>BUT when they advanc'd, and came nearer
to us to <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and there appear'd a greater Spi|rit
among the People in their Favour, my old
Doctor, who I had mention'd before, who was a
<HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t, and had married us, in&s;pir'd me with
new Zeal, and gave me no re&s;t, till he oblig'd me
with only a good Hor&s;e, and Arms to joyn them
the Day before they enter'd <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> he him&s;elf
venturing in the &s;ame Po&s;ture with me.</P>
<P>I WAS not &s;o publick here, as to be very well
known, at lea&s;t by any one that had Knowledge
of me in the Country where I liv'd; and this
was indeed my &s;afety afterward, as you will &s;oon
hear; but yet I was known too among the
Men, e&s;pecially, among the <HI>Scots,</HI> with &s;ome of
whom I had been acquainted in foreign Service;
with the&s;e I was particularly Conver&s;ant, and
pa&s;&s;ing for a <HI>French</HI> Officer: I talk'd to them
of making a &s;elect Detachment to defend the
Pa&s;s between <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> and the River and Bridge;
upon maintaining which, as I in&s;i&s;ted, depended
the &s;afety of the whole Party.</P>
<P>IT was with &s;ome warmth that I &s;poke of that
Affair, and as I pa&s;s'd among them, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> for a <HI>French</HI>
Officer, and a Man of Experience, it caus'd &s;e|veral
Debates among them; but the hint was
not follow'd, as is well known; and from that
Moment I gave them all up as lo&s;t, and medita|ted
nothing but how to e&s;cape from them, which
I effected the Night before they were &s;urround|ed
by the Royal Cavalry: I did not do this with|out
great difficulty, &s;wimming the River <HI>Ribble,</HI>
<PB N="341" REF="347">
at a Place, where tho' I got well over, yet
I could not for a long while get to a Place
where my Hor&s;e cou'd land him&s;elf, <HI>that is
to &s;ay,</HI> where the Ground was firm enough
for him to take the Land; however, at length I
got on &s;hoar, and riding very hard came the next
Evening in &s;ight of my own Dwelling, here after
lying by in a Wood till the Depth of Night, I
&s;hot my Hor&s;e in a little kind of a Gravel-pit, or
Marl-pit, where I &s;oon cover'd him with Earth
for the pre&s;ent; and marching all alone, I came
about two in the Morning to my Hou&s;e, where
my Wife &s;urpriz'd Joy, and yet terribly Frighted,
let me in, and then I took immediate Mea&s;ures
to &s;ecure my&s;elf upon whatever incident might
happen, but which as things were ordered, I
had no need to make u&s;e of, for the Rebels being
intirely defeated, and either all killed, or taken
Pri&s;oners. I was not known by any Body in
the Country to have been among them; no,
nor &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected, and thus I made a
narrow E&s;cape from the mo&s;t dangerous Action,
and mo&s;t fooli&s;hly embark'd in, of any that
I had ever been engag'd in before.</P>
<P>IT was very lucky to me, that I killed and
bury'd my hor&s;e, for he would have been taken
two Days after, and would to be &s;ure have been
known by tho&s;e who had &s;een me upon him at
<HI>Pre&s;ton;</HI> but now, as none knew I had been a|broad,
nor any &s;uch Circum&s;tance could di&s;cover
me; I kept clo&s;e, and as my Excur&s;ion had been
&s;hort, and I had not been mi&s;s'd by any of
my Neighbours, if any Body came to &s;peak
with me, behold, I was at Home.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="348">
HOWEVER, I was not thoroughly ea&s;y in my
Mind, and &s;ecretly wi&s;h'd I was in my own Do|minions
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> to which, in a little time,
other Circum&s;tances concurring, I made Prepara|tions
to remove with my whole Family.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, <HI>as above,</HI> the Action at
<HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> happen'd, and the Mi&s;erable People &s;ur|render'd
to the King's Troops; &s;ome were execu|ted
for Examples, as in &s;uch Ca&s;es is u&s;ual; and
the Government extending Mercy to the Multi|tude;
they were kept in <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> Ca&s;tle, and
other places a con&s;iderable time, till they were
di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;ome one Way, &s;ome another, as
we &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>SEVERAL hundreds of them after this, were
at their own Reque&s;t tran&s;ported, <HI>as tis vul|garly
Expre&s;s'd,</HI> to the Plantations, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI>
&s;ent to <HI>Virginia,</HI> and other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Collonies, to
be &s;old after the u&s;ual manner of condemn'd
Criminals, or, <HI>as we call them there,</HI> Convicts, to
&s;erve a limited Time in the Country, and then
be made Freemen again; &s;ome of the&s;e I have
&s;poken of above; but now to my no little Un|ca&s;ine&s;s,
I found, after I had been there &s;ome
time, two Ships arrived with more of the&s;e Peo|ple
in the &s;ame River where all my Plantations
lay.</P>
<P>I no &s;ooner heard of it, but the fir&s;t Step I
took was, to re&s;olve to let none of them be bought
into my Work, or to any of my Plantations;
and this I did, pretending that I would not make
Slaves every Day of unfortunate Gentlemen, who
fell into that Condition, for their Zeal to their Par|ty
only, and the like: But the true Rea&s;on was, that
I expected &s;everal of them would know me, and
might perhaps betray me, and make it publick,
<PB N="343" REF="349">
that I was one of the &s;ame &s;ort, but had made
my E&s;cape, and &s;o I might be brought into Trou|ble;
and if I came off with my Life, might
have all my Effects &s;eiz'd on, and be reduc'd to
Mi&s;ery and Poverty again at once, all which
I thought I had done enough to de&s;erve.</P>
<P>THIS was a ju&s;t Caution, but as I found
quickly, was not a &s;ufficient one, as my Circum|&s;tances
&s;tood, for my Safety; for tho' I bought
none of the&s;e poor Men my &s;elf, yet &s;everal of
my Neighbours did, and there was &s;carce a Plan|tation
near me, but had &s;ome of them, more or
le&s;s among them; So that in a Word, I could
not peep abroad hardly, but I was in Danger to
be &s;een and known too, by &s;ome or other of
them.</P>
<P>I may be allow'd to &s;ay, that this was a very
unea&s;y Life to me, and &s;uch, that in &s;hort, I
found my &s;elf utterly unable to bear; for I was
now reduced from a great Man, a Magi&s;trate,
a Governor, or Ma&s;ter of three great Planta|tions;
and having three or four Hundred Ser|vants
at my Command, to be a poor &s;elf con|demn'd
Rebel, and dur&s;t not &s;hew my Face;
and that I might with the &s;ame &s;afety, or rather
more, have skulk'd about in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> where
I was; or gone up to <HI>London,</HI> and conceal'd my
&s;elf there, till things had been over; but now
the Danger was come Home to me, even to my
Door, and I expected nothing, but to be inform'd a|gain&s;t
every Day, be taken up, and &s;ent to <HI>England</HI>
in Irons, and have all my Plantations &s;eiz'd on,
as a forfeited E&s;tate to the Crown.</P>
<P>I had but one hope of Safety to tru&s;t to, and that
was, that having been &s;o little a while among
them; done nothing for them; and pa&s;&s;ing for a
<PB N="344" REF="350">
Stranger, they never knew my Name, but only
I was call'd the <HI>French</HI> Colonel, or the <HI>French</HI>
Officer, or the <HI>French</HI> Gentleman, by mo&s;t, if not,
by all the People there; and as for the Doctor
that went with me, he had found Means to e&s;|cape
too, tho' not the &s;ame way that I did, find|ing
the Cau&s;e not like to be &s;upported and that
the King's Troops were gathering on all &s;ides
round them like a Cloud.</P>
<P>BUT to return to my &s;elf, this was no Sa|tisfaction
to me, and what to do, I really knew
not; for I was more at a Lo&s;s how to Shift in
&s;uch a di&s;tre&s;s'd Ca&s;e as this, now it lay &s;o clo&s;e
to me, than ever I was in any other Difficulty
of my Life. The fir&s;t thing I did was to come
Home, and make a Confidence of the whole Af|fair
to my Wife; and tho' I did it generou&s;ly,
without Conditions, yet I did not do it, with|out
fir&s;t telling her, how I was now going to put
my Life into her Hands, that &s;he might have it
in her Power to pay me Home, for all that &s;he
might think had been hard in my former U&s;age
of her; and that in &s;hort, it would be in her
Power to deliver me up into the Hands of my
Enemies; but that I would tru&s;t her Gene|ro&s;ity,
as well as her renew'd Affection, and
put all upon her Fidelity; and without any more
Precaution, I open'd the whole thing to her, and
particularly, the Danger I was now in.</P>
<P>A faithful Coun&s;ellor is Life from the Dead,
gives courage where the Heart is &s;inking, and
rai&s;es the Mind to a proper u&s;e of Means; and
&s;uch &s;he was to me indeed, upon every Step of
this Affair; and it was by her Direction that I
took every Step that follow'd for the extricating
my &s;elf out of this Labrinth.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="351">
COME, come, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> if this be
all, there is no room for any &s;uch Di&s;con&s;olate
doings as your fears run you upon; for I was
immediately for &s;elling off my Plantations, and
all my Stock, and embarking my&s;elf forthwith,
and to get to <HI>Maderas,</HI> or to any Place out of the
King's Dominions.</P>
<P>BUT my Wife was quite of another Opini|on,
and encouraging me on another Account,
propos'd two Things, either my Freighting a
Sloop with Provi&s;ions to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;o
taking Pa&s;&s;age from thence to <HI>London,</HI> or letting
her go away directly for <HI>England,</HI> and endeavour
to obtain the King's Pardon whatever it might
co&s;t.</P>
<P>I inclin'd to the la&s;t Propo&s;al, for tho' I was
unhappily Prejudic'd in favour of a wrong Inte|re&s;t,
yet I had always a Secret, and right Noti|on
of the Clemency, and merciful Di&s;po&s;ition
of his Maje&s;ty, and had I been in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould
I believe have been ea&s;ily per&s;waded to have
thrown my&s;elf at his Foot.</P>
<P>BUT going to <HI>England,</HI> as I was, Circum|&s;tances
mu&s;t have been a publick Action, and I
mu&s;t have made all the u&s;ual Preparations for
it, mu&s;t have appear'd in Publick, have &s;taid till
the Crop was ready, and gone away in Form,
and State, as u&s;ual; or have acted as if &s;omething
extraordinary was the Matter, and have fill'd
the Heads of People there with innumerable Sug|ge&s;tions
of they knew not what.</P>
<P>BUT my Wife made all this ea&s;ie to me,
from her own Invention; for without acquaint|ing
me with any thing, &s;he comes merrily to
me one Morning before I was up; My dear,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I am very &s;orry to hear that you are
<PB N="346" REF="352">
not very well, this Morning; I have order'd <HI>Pen|nico</HI>
that was a young <HI>Negro</HI> Girl, which I had
given her, to make you a Fire in your Cham|ber,
and pray lye &s;till where you are a while,
till 'tis done; at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the little
<HI>Negro</HI> came in with Wood, and a pair of Bellows,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to kindle the Fire and my Wife not gi|ving
me time to reply, Whi&s;pers clo&s;e to my
Ear to lye &s;till, and &s;ay nothing till &s;he came
up again to me.</P>
<P>I WAS thoroughly frighted, that you may be
&s;ure of, and thought of nothing, but of being
di&s;cover'd, betray'd, carried to <HI>England,</HI> hang'd,
quarter'd, and all that was terrible, and my very
Heart &s;unk within me; &s;he perceiv'd my Di&s;|order,
and turn'd back, a&s;&s;uring me there was no
Harm, de&s;ir'd me to be ea&s;ie, and &s;he would come
back again pre&s;ently, and give me &s;atisfaction
in every particular that I could de&s;ire; &s;o I
compos'd my&s;elf a while as well as I could; but
it was but a little while that I could bear it, and
I &s;ent <HI>Pennico</HI> down Stairs to find out her Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
and tell her I was very Ill, and mu&s;t &s;peak
with her immediately, and the Girl was &s;carce
out of the Room before I jump'd out of Bed, and
began to dre&s;s me, that I might be ready for all
Events.</P>
<P>MY Wife was as good as her Word, and was
coming up as the Girl was coming down; I &s;ee,
<HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you want Patience, but pray do not
want Government of your&s;elf, but take that
Skreen before your Face, and go to the Window,
and &s;ee if you know any of tho&s;e <HI>Scot&s;men,</HI> that
are in the Yard, for there are &s;even or eight of
them, come about &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s to your Clerk.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="353">
I went and look'd through the Skreen, and
&s;aw the Faces of them all di&s;tinctly, but could
make nothing of them, other than than that they
were <HI>Scot&s;men,</HI> which it was ea&s;ie to di&s;cern;
however, it was no &s;atisfaction to me that I knew
not their Faces, for they might know mine for
all that, according to the old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb, <HI>that
more knows</HI> Tom <HI>Fool, than</HI> Tom <HI>Fool knows;</HI> &s;o
I kept clo&s;e in my Chamber, till I under&s;tood
they were all gone.</P>
<P>AFTER this, my Wife caus'd it to be given
out in the Hou&s;e, that I was not well, and when
this not being well, had la&s;ted three or four
Days, I had my Leg wrap'd up in a great piece
of Flannel, and laid upon a Stool, and there I
was lame of the Gout; and this &s;erv'd for about
&s;ix Weeks, when my Wife told me &s;he had given
it out, that my Gout was rather Rheumatick,
than a &s;ettled Gout, and that I was re&s;olv'd to
take one of my own Sloops, and go away to
<HI>Nevis</HI> or <HI>Antegoa,</HI> and u&s;e the Hot Baths there for
my Cure.</P>
<P>ALL this was very well, and I approv'd my
Wife's contrivance, as admirably good, both to
keep me within Doors, eight or ten Weeks at fir&s;t,
and to convey me away afterwards without any
extraordinary Bu&s;tle to be made about it; but &s;till
I did not know what it all tended to, and what
the De&s;ign of it all was; but as my Wife de&s;ir'd
me to leave that to her, &s;o I readily did, and
&s;he carried it all on with a Prudence not to
be di&s;puted; and after &s;he had wrapt my Legs in
Flannel almo&s;t three Months, &s;he came and told
me the Sloop was ready; and all the Goods put
on Board: And now, my Dear, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I come
to tell you all the re&s;t of my De&s;ign; for ad|ded
<PB N="348" REF="354">
&s;he, I hope you will not think I am going
to kidnap you, and tran&s;port you from <HI>Virginia</HI>
as other People are tran&s;ported to it; or, that I
am going to get you &s;ent away, and leave my|&s;elf
in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your E&s;tate; But you &s;hall
find me the &s;ame faithful humble Creature, which
I &s;hould have been, if I had been &s;till your
Slave, and not had any Hopes of being your
Wife; and that in all my Scheme which I have
laid for your Safety, in this new Exigence, I
have not propo&s;ed your going one Step, but
where I &s;hall go, and be always with you, to
a&s;&s;i&s;t, and &s;erve you on all Occa&s;ions, and to
take my Portion with you, of what kind &s;oever
our Lot may be.</P>
<P>THIS was &s;o generous, and &s;o hand&s;ome a
Declaration of her Fidelity, and &s;o great a To|ken
too of the Goodne&s;s of her Judgement, in
con&s;idering of the Things which were before her,
and of what my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances called
for, that from that time forward, I gave my
&s;elf chearfully up to her Management, with|out
ony He&s;&s;itation in the lea&s;t, and in about
ten Days Preparation, we embark'd in a large
Sloop of my own of about Sixty Ton.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mention'd here, that I had &s;till
my faithful Tutor, (as I called him) at the Head
of my Affairs, and as he knew who to Corre&s;pond
with, and how to mannage the Corre&s;pondence
in <HI>England,</HI> we left all that part to him, as I had
done before; and I did this with a full Satis|faction
in his Ability, as well as in his Inte|grity;
it is true, he had been a little &s;hagreen'd
in that Affair of my Wife, who, <HI>as I hinted be|fore,</HI>
had marry'd me, after telling him $word$
<PB N="349" REF="355">
An&s;wer to his Solicitations, that &s;he had a Hu&s;|band
a live.</P>
<P>Now, tho' this was litterally true, yet as it
was a Secret not fit to be open'd to him, I was
obliged to put him off with other Rea&s;ons, as
well as I could, perhaps not much to the Pur|po&s;e,
and perhaps, not much to his Satisfaction;
&s;o that I reckon'd, he look'd on him&s;elf, as not
very kindly u&s;ed &s;everal Ways.</P>
<P>BUT he began to get over it, and to be ea&s;y,
e&s;pecially at our going away, when he found
that the Tru&s;t of every Thing was &s;till left in his
Hands, as it was before.</P>
<P>WHEN my Wife had thus communicated eve|ry
thing of the Voyage to me, and we began to
be ready to go off, &s;he came to me one Morning,
and with her u&s;ual Chearfulne&s;s told me; &s;he
now came to tell me the re&s;t of her Mea|&s;ures,
for the Compleating my Deliverance, and
this was, that while we made this Trip, <HI>as &s;he
call'd it,</HI> to the hot Springs at <HI>Nevis:</HI> She would
write to a particular Friend at <HI>London,</HI> who &s;he
could depend upon, to try to get a Pardon for a
Per&s;on on Account of the late Rebellion, with
all the Circum&s;tances which my Ca&s;e was at|tended
with, <HI>viz.</HI> of having acted nothing among
them but being three Days in the Place, and
while we were thus ab&s;ent, &s;he did not que&s;tion,
but to have an An&s;wer, which &s;he would direct
to come &s;o many Ways, that we would be &s;ure
to have the fir&s;t of it as &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible
the Ve&s;&s;els could go' and come; and in the
mean time, the Expence &s;hould be very &s;mall,
for &s;he would have an An&s;wer to the grand
Que&s;tion fir&s;t; Whether it could be obtain'd or
no, and then an account of the Expence of it,
<PB N="350" REF="356">
that &s;o I might Judge for my &s;elf, whether I
would Part with the needful Sum, or no, before
any Money was Disbur&s;s'd on my Account.</P>
<P>I could not but be thoroughly &s;atisfy'd with her
Contrivance in this particular, and I had nothing
to add to it, but that I would not have her li|mit
her Friend &s;o &s;trictly, but that if he &s;aw
the way clear, and that he was &s;ure to obtain it,
he &s;hould go thorough Stitch with it, if within
the Expence of two, or three, or four Hundred
Pounds, and that upon Advice of its being practi|cable,
he &s;hould have Bills payable by &s;uch a
Per&s;on on Delivery of the Warrant for the thing.</P>
<P>To fortifie this I enclos'd in her Packet a Let|ter
to one of my Corre&s;pondents, who I could
more particularly Tru&s;t, with a Credit for the
Money, on &s;uch and &s;uch Conditions; but the
Hone&s;ty and Integrity of my Wife's Corre|&s;pondent
was &s;uch, as prevented all the Ex|pence,
and yet I had the wi&s;h'd for Security as if
it had been all paid, as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e things being fix'd to our Minds,
and all things left behind in good Po&s;ture of
Settlement as u&s;ual, we embark'd together, and
put to Sea, having the opportunity of an <HI>Eng|li&s;hman</HI>
of War being on the Coa&s;t in pur&s;uit of
the Pyrates, and who was ju&s;t then &s;tanding a|way
towards the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and told us
he would &s;ee us &s;afe, as far as <HI>New Providence,</HI>
or the <HI>Bahama I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P>AND now having fair Weather, and a plea|&s;ant
Voyage, and my Flannels taken off
of my Legs. I mu&s;t hint a little, what Car|go
I had with me; for as my Circum&s;tances were
very good in that Country, &s;o I did not go &s;uch
a Voyage as this, and with a particular re&s;erve
<PB N="351" REF="357">
of Fortunes whatever might afterwards happen$
without a &s;ufficient Cargo, for our Support, and
whatever Exigence might happen.</P>
<P>OU$ Sloop, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> was of about 60 or 70
Ton, and as Tobacco, which is the general Pro|duce
of the Country was no Merchandize at <HI>Ne|vis,
that is to &s;ay,</HI> for a great Quantity; &s;o we
carried very little, but loaded the Sloop with
Corn, Pea&s;e, Meal and &s;ome Barrels of Pork, and
an excellent Cargo it was; mo&s;t of it being the
Produce of my own Plantation; we took al&s;o a
con&s;iderable Sum of Money with us in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Gold, which was as above, not for Trade, but for
all Events; I al&s;o order'd another Sloop to be
hir'd, and to be &s;ent after me loaden with the
&s;ame Goods, as &s;oon as they &s;hould have Advice
from me that I was &s;afe arriv'd.</P>
<P>WE came to the Latitude of the <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>An|tegoa,</HI>
which was very near to that of <HI>Nevis,</HI>
whether we intended to go, on the 18th Day af|ter
our pa&s;&s;ing the Capes of <HI>Virginia;</HI> but had
no &s;ight of the <HI>I&s;land,</HI> only our Ma&s;ter &s;aid he
was very &s;ure if he &s;tood the &s;ame Cour&s;e as he
then was, and the Gale held, I &s;ay he told me,
he was &s;ure he &s;hould make the <HI>I&s;land</HI> in le&s;s than
five Hours Sail; &s;o he &s;tood on fair for the <HI>I&s;lands:</HI>
However, his Account had fail'd him, for we
held on all the Evening, made no Land, and
likewi&s;e all Night; when in the Gray of the
Morning we di&s;cover'd from the Topma&s;t-head, a
Brigantine, and a Sloop making Sail after us, at
the di&s;tance of about &s;ix Leagues, fair Weather,
and the Wind fre&s;h at S. E.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358">
OUR Ma&s;ter &s;oon under&s;tood what they were,
and came down into the Cabbin to me, to let me
know it; I was much &s;urpriz'd you may be &s;ure
at the Danger, but my poor Wife took me off
of all the Concern for my&s;elf to take care of her,
for &s;he was frighted to that degree, that I
thought we &s;hould not have been able to keep
Life in her.</P>
<P>WHILE we were thus under the fir&s;t Hurry,
and Surprize of the thing, &s;uddenly another
Noi&s;e from the Deck call'd us up to look out, and
that was <HI>Land, Land;</HI> the Ma&s;ter, and I, (for by
this time I had gotten out of my Cabbin) run upon
the Deck, and there we &s;aw the &s;tate of our Ca&s;e
very plain; the two Rogues that &s;tood after us,
laid on all the Canvas they could carry, and
crowded after us a main; but at the di&s;tance, as I
have &s;aid, of about &s;ix Leagues, rather more than
le&s;s; on the other Hand, the Land di&s;cover'd lay
about nine Leagues right a Head; &s;o that if the
Pyrates could get of us, &s;o as to &s;ail three Foot
for our two, it was evident they would be up
with us, before we could make the <HI>I&s;land,</HI> if not,
we &s;hould e&s;cape them, and get in; but even
then we had no great hope to do any more, than
run the Ship a Shoar to &s;ave our Lives, and &s;o
&s;tranding our Ve&s;&s;el, &s;poil both Sloop and Cargo.</P>
<P>WHEN we were making this Calculation,
our Ma&s;ter came in chearfully, and told me he
had crowded on more Sail, and found the Sloop
carried it very well, and that he did not find the
Rogues gain'd much upon us, and that e&s;peci|ally,
if one of them did not, that was the Sloop
he found he could go away from the Brigantine,
as he pleas'd$ Thus we gave them what they call
a &s;teern Cha&s;e, and they work'd hard to come up
<PB N="353" REF="359">
with us, till towards Noon, when on a &s;udden
they both &s;tood away, and gave us over, to our
great &s;atisfaction, you may be &s;ure.</P>
<P>WE did not it &s;eems &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ee the Occa&s;ion
of our Deliverance, as the Pyrate did, for while
we went &s;pooning away large with the Wind, for
one of the <HI>I&s;lands, with tho&s;e two Spurs in our Heels;</HI>
that is, with the&s;e two Thieves at our Sterns:
There lay an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> of War in the Road of
<HI>Nevis,</HI> which was the other <HI>I&s;land</HI> from whence
they &s;py'd the Pyrates, tho' the Land lying be|tween,
we could not &s;ee them.</P>
<P>As the Man of War di&s;cover'd them, &s;he im|mediately
&s;lip'd her Cable, and put her&s;elf under
Sail in Cha&s;e of the Rogues, and they as &s;oon per|$$$d
her, and being to Windward, put them&s;elves
upon a Wind to e&s;cape her; and thus we were
deliver'd, and in about an Hour more, we knew
who was our Deliverer, &s;eeing the Man of War
&s;tretch a Head clear of the <HI>I&s;land,</HI> and &s;tand di|rectly
after the Pyrates, who now crowded from
us, as fa&s;t as they crowded after us before, and
thus we got &s;afe into <HI>Antegoa,</HI> after the terrible
apprehen&s;ion we had been in of being taken; our
Apprehen&s;ions of being taken now, were much
more than they would have been on Board a
loaden Ship, from, or to <HI>London,</HI> where the mo&s;t
they ordinarily do, is to rifle the Ship, take what is
Valuable, and Portable, and let her go; but ours
being but a Sloop, and all our Loading being good
Provi&s;ions, &s;uch as they wanted to be &s;ure, for
their Ships Store; they would certainly have
carried us away, Ship and all; taken out the
Cargo, and the Men; and perhaps, have &s;et the
Sloop on Fire; &s;o that as to our Cargo of Gold it
had been inevitably lo&s;t, and we hurry'd away,
no Body knows where, and us'd as &s;uch barbarous
<PB N="354" REF="360">
Fellows are wont to u&s;e &s;uch innocent People as
fall into their Hands.</P>
<P>BUT we were now out of their Hands, and
had the &s;atisfaction a few Days after, to hear that
the Man of War pur&s;u'd them &s;o clo&s;e, not|with&s;tanding
they chang'd their Cour&s;e in the
Night, that the next Day they were oblig'd to
&s;eparate, and &s;hift for them&s;elves; &s;o the Man
of War took one of them, namely, the Brigan|tine,
and carried her into <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but, the
other (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Sloop, made her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>BEING arriv'd here, we pre&s;ently di&s;pos'd
of our Cargo, and at a tolerable good Price$
and now the Que&s;tion was, what I &s;hould do next$
I look'd upon my&s;elf to be &s;afe here from the
Fears I had been under of being di&s;cover'd as
a Rebel, and &s;o indeed I was, but having been
now ab&s;ent five Months, and having &s;ent the
Sloop back with a Cargo of Rum, and Mela&s;&s;es,
&s;uch as I knew was wanting in my Plantations,
I receiv'd the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el back in return loaden
as at fir&s;t with Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>WITH this Cargo my Wife received a Packet
from <HI>London,</HI> from the Per&s;on, who &s;he had em|ploy'd,
<HI>as above,</HI> to Solicit a Pardon, and who ve|ry
hone&s;tly wrote to her, that he would not be
&s;o unju&s;t to her Friend, whoever he was, as to
put him to any Expence for a private Sollicita|tion,
for that he was very well a&s;&s;ur'd that his Ma|je&s;ty
had re&s;olv'd, from his own native Di&s;po&s;ition
to acts of Clemency and Mercy to his Subjects, to
grant a general Pardon, with &s;ome few Excepti|ons
to Per&s;ons extraordinary, and he hop'd her
Friend was none of the extraordinary Per&s;ons to
be excepted.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="361">
THIS was a kind of Life from the Dead to
us both, and it was re&s;olv'd that my Wife &s;hould
go back in the Sloop directly to <HI>Virginia,</HI> where
&s;he &s;hould wait the good News from <HI>England,</HI> and
&s;hould &s;end me an Account of it as &s;oon as &s;he
receiv'd it.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY &s;he went back, and came
&s;afe with the Sloop and Cargo to our Plantation,
from whence after above four Months more Ex|pectation,
behold! the Sloop came to me again
but empty, and gutted of all her Cargo, except
about 100 Sacks of unground Malt, which the
Pyrates (not knowing how to Brew) knew not
what to do with, and &s;o had left in her: How|ever,
to my infinite &s;atisfaction, there was a
Packet of Letters from my Wife, with another
to her from <HI>England,</HI> as well one from her Friend,
as one from my own Corre&s;pondent; both of them
intimating that the King had &s;ign'd an Act of
Grace, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> a General Free Pardon, and
&s;ent me Copies of the Act, wherein it was ma|nife&s;t
I was fully included.</P>
<P>AND here let me hint, that having now as it
were received my Life at the Hands of King
<HI>GEORGE,</HI> and in a manner &s;o &s;atisfying as
it was to me, it made a generous Convert of
me, and I became &s;incerely given in to the In|tere&s;t
of King <HI>GEORGE;</HI> and this from a
Principle of Gratitude, and a Sen&s;e of my Obli|gation
to his Maje&s;ty for my Life; and it has
continu'd ever &s;ince, and will certainly remain
with me as long as any Sen&s;e of Honour, and
of the Debt of Gratitude remains with me: I men|tion
this to hint how far in &s;uch Ca&s;es Ju&s;tice,
and Duty to our &s;elves commands us; namely, that
to tho&s;e who graciou&s;ly give us our Lives, when
<PB N="356" REF="362">
it is in their Power to take them away; tho&s;e
Lives are a Debt ever after, and ought to be &s;et
a part for their Service, and Intere&s;t as long as a|ny
of the Powers of Life remain; for Gratitude
is a Debt that never cea&s;es while the Benefit re|ceiv'd
remains, and if my Prince has given me
my Life, I can never pay the Debt fully, unle&s;s
&s;uch a Circum&s;tance as this &s;hould happen, that
the Prince's Life &s;hould be in my Power, and I as
generou&s;ly pre&s;erv'd it; and yet neither would
the Obligation be paid then, becau&s;e the Ca&s;es
would differ; thus, that my pre&s;erving the Life
of my Prince was my natural Duty, whereas the
Prince on his Side (my Life being forfeited to
him) had no Motive but meer Clemency, and Be|neficence.</P>
<P>PERHAPS this Principle may not plea&s;e all that
read it; but as I have re&s;olv'd to guide my Actions
in things of &s;uch a Nature by the Rules of &s;trict
Vertue and Principles of Honour; &s;o I mu&s;t lay
it down as a Rule of Honour, that a Man having
once forfeited his Life to the Ju&s;tice of his
Prince, and to the Laws of his Country, and
receiving it back as a Bounty from the Grace of
his Soveraign; &s;uch a Man can never lift up his
Hand again again&s;t that Prince, without a for|feiture
of his Vertue, and an irreparable Breach of
his Honour and Duty, and de&s;erves no Pardon
after it, either from God or Man; but all this
is a Digre&s;&s;ion, I leave it as a Sketch of the Laws
of Honour, printed by the Laws of Nature in
the Brea&s;t of a Soldier, or a Man of Honour, and
which I believe all impartial Per&s;ons who under|&s;tand
what Honour means, will Sub&s;cribe to.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="363">
BUT I return now to my pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances;
my Wife was gone, and with her, all my
good Fortune, and Succe&s;s$ in Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eem'd to
have for&s;aken me; and I had another Scene of
Mi&s;ery to go thro', after I had thought that all
my Misfortunes were over, and at an End.</P>
<P>MY Sloop as I have told you arriv'd, but ha|ving
met with a Pyrate Rogue, in the Gulph of
<HI>Florida,</HI> they took her fir&s;t, then finding her
Cargo to be all Eatbles, which they always
want, they gutted her of all her Loading, except,
<HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> about 100 Sacks of <HI>Malt,</HI> which
they really knew not what to do with; and
which was &s;till wor&s;e, they took away all the
Men, except the Ma&s;ter and two Boys, who they
left on Board, ju&s;t to run the Ve&s;&s;el into <HI>Antegoa</HI>
where they &s;aid they were Bound.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t valuable Part of my Cargo, <HI>viz.</HI>
a Packet of Letters from <HI>England,</HI> tho&s;e they left
to my inexpre&s;&s;ible Comfort and Satisfaction;
and particularly, that by tho&s;e, I &s;aw my Way
open to return to my Wife, and to my Planta|tions,
from which I promi&s;ed my &s;elf never to
wander any more.</P>
<P>IN order to this, I now embark'd my &s;elf,
and all my Effects on board the Sloop, re&s;olving
to Sail Directly to the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> my
Capt. beating it up to reach the <HI>Bahama</HI> Channel,
had not been two Days at Sea, but we were over|taken
with a violent Storm, which drove us &s;o
far upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Florida,</HI> as that we twice
&s;truck upon the Shore, and had we &s;truck a third
time, we had been $inevitably lo&s;t. A Day or
two after that, the Storm abating a little, we
kept the Sea, but found that the Wind blowing
&s;o &s;trong again&s;t our pa&s;&s;ing the Gulph, and the
<PB N="316" REF="364">
Sea going &s;o high, we could not hold it any
long$r; &s;o we were forced to bear away, and
make what &s;hift we could; in which di&s;tre&s;s, the
fifth Day after, we made Land, but found it to
be Cape&mdash;the <HI>North We&s;t</HI> part of the I&s;le
of <HI>Cuba:</HI> Here we found our&s;elves under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
to run in under the Land for Shelter, tho'
we had not come to an Anchor, &s;o that we had
not touch'd the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Territories at all.
However in the Morning we were &s;urrounded with
five <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Barks, or Boats, &s;uch as they call <HI>Barco
Longos,</HI> full of Men; who in&s;tantly boarded
us, took us, and carry'd us into the <HI>Havana,</HI> the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Port belonging to the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
in that Part of the World.</P>
<P>HERE the Sloop was immediately Seiz'd, and
in Con&s;equence plundred, as any one that knows
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> e&s;pecially in that Country, will
ea&s;ily gue&s;s, our Men were made Pri&s;oners and
&s;ent to the common Goal, and as for my &s;elf,
and the Captain, we were carry'd before the <HI>Al|cade
Major,</HI> or Intendant of the Place as Cri|minals.</P>
<P>I &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> very well, having &s;erv'd under
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and it &s;tood me in
good &s;tead at this time, for I &s;o effectually ar|gued
the Inju&s;tice of their Treatment of me,
that the Governor, or what I ought to call him,
frankly own'd they ought not to have &s;topp'd
me, &s;eeing I was in the open Sea, per&s;uing my
Voyage and offer'd no Offence to any Body, and
had not landed or offer'd to land upon any Part
of his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty's Dominions, 'till I was
brought in as a Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="365">
IT was a great Favour, that I could obtain
thus much, but I found it ea&s;ier to obtain an Ac|knowledgement
that I had receiv'd Wrong, than
to get any Satisfaction for that Wrong, and much
le&s;s was there any Hope or Pro&s;pect of Re&s;titu|tion:
And I was let know, that I was to wait,
till an Account could be &s;ent to the Viceroy of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> and Orders could be received back from
him, how to act in the Affair.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily fore&s;ee what all this tended to,
namely to a Confi&s;cation of the Ship and Goods,
by the ordinary Proce&s;s at the Place; and that my
being left to the Deci&s;ion of the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico,</HI>
was but a pretended Repre&s;entation of things to
him from the Corregidore or Judge of the Place.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I had no Remedy but the old
in&s;ignificant thing call'd Patience; and this I was
better furni&s;h'd with, becau&s;e I did not &s;o much
value the Lo&s;s as I made them believe I did;
my greate&s;t Apprehen&s;ions were, that they would
detain me, and keep me as a Pri&s;oner for Life,
and perhaps &s;end me to their Mines in <HI>Pern,</HI> as
they have done many, and pretended to do to all
that come on Shore in their Dominions, how
great &s;oever the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es may have been which
have brought them thither, and which has been the
Rea&s;on why others who have been forc'd on Shore,
have committed all manner of Violence upon the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in their turn; re&s;olving, however Dear
they &s;old their Lives, not to fall into their Hands.</P>
<P>BUT I got better Quarter among them, than
that too; which, was, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> much of
it owing to my &s;peaking <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and to my
telling them how I had fought in &s;o many Oc|ca&s;ions
in the Quarrel of his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty,
in <HI>Italy,</HI> and by great good Chance, I had the
<PB N="360" REF="366">
King of <HI>France</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion for Lieutenant Colo|nel,
in the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Brigade in my Pocket, where it
was mention'd, that the &s;aid Brigade was then
&s;erving in the Armies of <HI>France,</HI> under the Or|ders
of his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>I fail'd not to talk up the Gallantry and per|&s;onal
Bravery, of his Catholick Maje&s;ty on all
Occa&s;ions, and particularly in many Battles
where by the Way, his Maje&s;ty had never been
at all, and in &s;ome, where I had never been
my &s;elf; but I found I talk'd to People who
knew nothing of the Matter, and &s;o any thing
went down with them, if it did but prai&s;e the
King of <HI>Spains,</HI> and talk big of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ca|valry,
of which, God knows, there was not one
Regiment in the Army, at lea&s;t while I was there.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this way of managing my &s;elf,
obtain'd me the Liberty of the Place, upon my
Parole, that I would not attempt an E&s;cape;
and I obtain'd al&s;o, which was a great Favour,
to have 200 Pieces of Eight allow'd me out of
the Sale of my Cargo, for Sub&s;i&s;tance, till I
could Negotiate my Affairs at <HI>Mexico;</HI> as for my
Men they were maintain'd as Pri&s;oners, at the
publick Charge.</P>
<P>WELL, after &s;everal Months Solicitation and
Attendance, all I could obtain was, the Satis|faction
of &s;eeing my Ship and Cargo confi&s;cated,
and my poor Sailors in a fair way to be &s;ent to
the Mines: The la&s;t I begg'd off, upon Condi|tion
of paying 300 Pieces of Eight for their
Ran&s;om, and having them &s;et on Shore at
<HI>Antegoa,</HI> and my &s;elf to remain Ho&s;tage for the
Payment of the &s;aid 300 Pieces of Eight, and
for 200 Pieces of Eight, which I had already
had, and for 500 Pieces of Eight more for my
<PB N="361" REF="367">
own Ran&s;om, if upon a Return from <HI>Mexico,</HI>
the Sentence of Confi&s;cation, <HI>as above,</HI> &s;hould be
confirm'd by the Vice-roy.</P>
<P>THESE were hard Articles indeed, but I was
forced to &s;ubmitt to them: Nor as my Circum|&s;tances
were above all &s;uch Matters as the&s;e, as
to Sub&s;tance, did I lay it much to Heart; the
greate&s;t Difficulty that lay in my Way was
that I knew not how to corre&s;pond with my
Friends in any part of the World, or which way
to &s;upply my &s;elf with Nece&s;&s;aries, or with
Money for the payment I had agreed to: The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> being &s;o Tenacious of their Ports, that
they allowed no Body to come on Shore, or, in|deed,
near the Shore, from any Part of the
World, <HI>upon Pain of Seizure and Confi&s;cation, as
had been my Ca&s;e already.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this Difficulty I began to Rea&s;on with
the Corregidore, and tell him, that he put things
upon us, that were impo&s;&s;ible, and that were In|con&s;i&s;tent
with the Cu&s;toms of Nations; that if
a Man was a Pri&s;oner at <HI>Algiers,</HI> they would
allow him to write to his Friends to pay his
Ran&s;om, and would admit the Per&s;on that brought
it to come and go free, as a publick Per&s;on,
and if they did not, no Treaty could be car|ry'd
on for the Ran&s;om of a Slave, nor the
Conditions be perform'd when they were agreed
upon.</P>
<P>I brought it then down to my own Ca&s;e, and
de&s;ired to know, upon Suppo&s;ition, that I might
within the Time limitted in that Agreement,
have the Sums of Money ready for the Ran&s;om,
of my Men, and of my Self; how I &s;hould ob|tain
to have Notice given me of it? Or, how it
&s;hould be brought, &s;eeing the very Per&s;ons bring|ing
<PB N="362" REF="368">
that Notice, or afterwards pre&s;uming to
bring the Money, might be liable to be &s;eiz'd and
confi&s;cated, as I had been, and the Money it&s;elf
be taken as a &s;econd Prize, without redeeming
the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THO' this was &s;o rea&s;onable a Reque&s;t, that it could
not be with&s;tood, in point of Argument, yet the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;hrunk his Head into his Shoulders, <HI>and
&s;aid,</HI> they had not Power &s;ufficient to act in &s;uch
a Ca&s;e; that the King's Laws were &s;o &s;evere
again&s;t the &s;uffering any Strangers to &s;et their
Foot on his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty's Dominions in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
and they could not di&s;pence with the lea&s;t

they called it,</HI> from the Con&s;ulado, or Chamber of
Commerce at <HI>Sevelle;</HI> or, a Command under the
Hand and Seal of the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>HOW Senior Corregidore <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> with &s;ome
Warmth, and as it were with A&s;toni&s;hment, have
you not Authority enough to &s;ign a Pa&s;&s;port for
an Agent, or Amba&s;&s;ador, to come on Shore here,
from any of the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s Govern|ours
in the&s;e Parts, under a white Flag, or Flag
of Truce, to &s;peak with the Governour of this
Place, or with any other Per&s;on in the King's
Name, on the Subject of &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s as the
Governour may have to Communicate? why
&s;aid he, if you cannot do that, you cannot Act
according to the Law of Nations.</P>
<P>HE &s;hook his Head, but &s;till, &s;aid no, he
could not do even &s;o much as that; but here one
of the Military Governours put in and oppos'd
him, and they two differ'd warmly; the fir&s;t in|&s;i&s;ting
that their Orders were defficient in that
particular; but the other &s;aid, that as they
were bound up to them, it could not be in their
<PB N="363" REF="369">
Power to Act otherwi&s;e, and that they was an|&s;werable
for the ill Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>WELL then, &s;ays the Governour to the Cor|regidore,
now you have kept this <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> as
Ho&s;tage for the Ran&s;om of the Men, that you have
di&s;mi&s;s'd; &s;uppo&s;e he tells you, the Money is rea|dy,
either at &s;uch, or &s;uch, or &s;uch a Place; How
&s;hall he bring it hither? you will take all
the People Pri&s;oners that offer to bring it;
What mu&s;t he do? if you &s;ay you will &s;end and
fetch it? What Security &s;hall he have, that he
&s;hall have his Liberty, when it is paid you? and
why &s;hould he tru&s;t you &s;o far, as to pay the
Money, and yet remain here a Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>THIS carried &s;o much Rea&s;on with it, that the
Corregidore knew not what to &s;ay; but that &s;o
was the Law, and he could Act no otherwi&s;e, but
by the very Letter of it; and here each was &s;o po|&s;itive,
that nothing could determine it, but ano|ther
Expre&s;s to be &s;ent to the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this, the Governour was &s;o kind, as to
&s;ay he would get me a Pa&s;sport for any Body
that &s;hould bring the Money, and any Ve&s;&s;el they
were in by his own Authority, and for their &s;afe
returning, and taking me with them, provided I
would an&s;wer for it; that they &s;hould bring no
<HI>European,</HI> or other Goods whatever with them,
and &s;hould not &s;et Foot on Shoar without his ex|pre&s;s
Permi&s;&s;ion, and provided he did not
receive Orders to the contrary, in the mean
time from any &s;uperior Hand, and that even
in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, they &s;hould have liberty to go
back freely from whence they came, under the
Protection of a white Flag.</P>
<P>I Bow'd very re&s;pectively to the Governour,
in Token of my acknowledging his Ju&s;tice, and
<PB N="364" REF="370">
hhen pre&s;ented my humble Petition to him, that
$e would allow my Men to take their own Sloop,
that it &s;hould be rated at a certain Value, and
would be oblig'd they &s;hould bring Specie on
Board with them, and that they &s;hould either pay
it for the Sloop or leave the Sloop again.</P>
<P>THEN he enquired to what Country I would
&s;end them for &s;o much Money, and if I could a&s;|&s;ure
him of the Payment; and when he under|&s;tood
it was no farther than to <HI>Virginia,</HI> he &s;eem'd
very ea&s;ie, and to &s;atisfie the Corregidore, who
&s;till &s;tood off, adhering with a true <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;tif|ne&s;s
to the Letter of the Law; the &s;aid Gover|nour
calls out to me, Seignior, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I &s;hall make
all this matter ea&s;ie to you, if you agree to my
Propo&s;al; your Men &s;hall have the$ Sloop, on
Condition you &s;hall bemy Ho&s;tage for her return;
but they &s;hall not take her as your Sloop, tho' &s;he
&s;hall in the Effect be yours, on the Payment of
the Money; but you &s;hall take two of my Men on
Board with you upon your Parole, for their &s;afe
return, and when &s;he returns, &s;he &s;hall carry his
Catholick Maje&s;ty's Colours, and to be enter'd as
one of the Sloops belonging to the <HI>Havana;</HI> one
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be Commander, and to be call'd
by &s;uch a Name as he &s;hould appoint.</P>
<P>THIS the Corregidore came into immediate|ly,
and &s;aid, this was within the Letter of the
King's Commanderie or Precept, upon Conditi|on,
however, that &s;he &s;hould bring no <HI>European</HI>
Goods on Board. I de&s;ir'd it might be put in o|ther
Words; namely, that &s;he &s;hould bring no
<HI>European</HI> Goods on Shoar: It co&s;t two days De|bate
between tho&s;e two, whether it &s;hould pa&s;s;
that no <HI>European</HI> Goods &s;hould be brought in
the Ship, or brought on Shoar; but having found
<PB N="365" REF="371">
means to intimate that I meant not to Trade
there; but would not be tyed from bringing a
&s;mall Pre&s;ent to a certain Per&s;on in acknowledge|ment
of favours, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> after I had found
Room to Place &s;uch a hint Right, where it &s;hould
be Plac'd, I found it was all made ea&s;ie to me,
and it was all agreed pre&s;ently, that after, the
Ran&s;om was paid, and the Ship al&s;o bought; it
was but rea&s;onable, that I &s;hould have liberty
to Trade to any other Country, not in the
Dominions of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s; &s;o to make
up my Lo&s;&s;es; and that it would be hard to o|blige
my Men to bring away the Ve&s;&s;el light,
and &s;o lo&s;e the Voyage, and add &s;o much to our
former Misfortunes; that &s;o long as no Goods
were brought on Shore in the Country belong|ing
to his Catholick Maje&s;ty's Dominions which
was all that they had to Defend, that the re&s;t was
no bu&s;ine&s;s of theirs.</P>
<P>NOW I began to &s;ee my way thro' this un|happy
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to find that as Money would
bring me out of it; &s;o Money would bring it to
turn to a good Account another way; wherefore
I &s;ent the Sloop away under <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colours, and
call'd her the <HI>Nue&s;tra Segniora de la Val de Grace,</HI>
commanded by Segnior <HI>Giraldo de Ne&s;ma,</HI> one of
the two <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>WITH the Sloop I &s;ent Letters to my Wife and
to my chief Manager with Orders to Load her
back, as I there directed (<HI>viz</HI>). That &s;he &s;hould have
200 Barrels of Flower, 50 Barrels of Peas, and to
an&s;wer my other Views, I ordered 100 Bales to
be made up of all &s;orts of <HI>European</HI> Goods, &s;uch as
not my own Ware-hou&s;es only would &s;upply, but
&s;uch as they could be &s;upply'd with in other Ware|hou&s;es,
where I knew they had Credit for any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="372">
IN this Cargo I directed all the riche&s;t, and
mo&s;t valuable <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, they had, or could
get, whether Linnen, Woollen or Silk, to be made
up; the Cour&s;er things, &s;uch as we u&s;e in <HI>Virginia,</HI>
for Clothing of Servants, &s;uch I ordered to be
left behind, for the u&s;e of the Plantation: In le&s;s
than &s;even Weeks time the Sloop return'd, and
I that fail'd not every Day to look out for her
on the Strand, was the fir&s;t that &s;py'd her at Sea
at a di&s;tance, and knew her by her Sails, but
afterwards more particularly by her Signals.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;he return'd, &s;he came into the Road
with her <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Antient flying, and came to an
Anchor, as directed; but I that had &s;een her &s;ome
Hours before, went directly to the Governour,
and gave him an Account of her being come,
and fain I would have obtain'd the Favour
to have his Excellence, <HI>as I call'd him,</HI> go on Board
in Per&s;on, that he might &s;ee how well his Orders
were executed, but he declin'd that; &s;aying he
could not ju&s;tifie going off of the <HI>I&s;land,</HI> which
was, in &s;hort, to go out of his Command of the
Fort, which he could not re-a&s;&s;ume without a new
Commi&s;&s;ion from the King's own Hand.</P>
<P>THEN I ask'd leave to go on Board my&s;elf,
which he granted me, and I brought on &s;hoar with
me the full Sum in Gold, which I had conditi|on'd
to pay for the Ran&s;om, both of my Men
and my&s;elf, and for the Purcha&s;e of the Sloop;
and as I obtain'd leave to Land in a different
Place, &s;o my Governour &s;ent his Son with &s;ix Sol|diers
to receive, and convey me with the Money
to the Ca&s;tle, where he Commanded; and therein
to his own Hou&s;e: I had made up the Money in
heavy Parcels, as if it had been all Silver; and
gave it to two of my Men, who belong'd to the
<PB N="367" REF="373">
Sloop, with Orders to them, that they &s;hould
make it &s;eem by their carrying it to be much
heavier than it was; this was done to conceal
three Parcels of Goods, which I had pack'd up
with the Money to make a Pre&s;ent to the Go|vernour
as I intended.</P>
<P>WHEN the Money was carried in, and laid
down on a Table; my Governour order'd the
Men to withdraw, and I gave the Soldiers each
of them a Peice of Eight to Drink, for which
they were very thankful, and the Governour
&s;eem'd well pleas'd with it al&s;o: Then I ask'd
him plea&s;antly if he would plea&s;e to receive the
Money, he &s;aid, no, he would not receive it, but in
pre&s;ence of the Corregidore, and the other Peo|ple
concern'd; then I beg'd his Excellency, <HI>as
I call'd him,</HI> give me leave to open the Parcels
in his Pre&s;ence, for that I would do my&s;elf the
Honour to acknowledge his Favours in the be&s;t
manner I could.</P>
<P>HE told me, no, he could not &s;ee any thing
be brought on Shoar, but the Money, but if I
had brought any thing on Shoar for my own u&s;e,
he would not be &s;o &s;trict to enquire into that,
&s;o I might do what I pleas'd my&s;elf.</P>
<P>UPON that I went into the Place, &s;hut my
&s;elf in, and having open'd all things and placed
them to my Mind: There was five little Parcels,
as follows,
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. 2. A piece of 20 Yards fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Broad-Cloth,
5 yds Black, 5 yds Crim&s;on in
one Parcel, and the re&s;t of fine Mixtures
in another Parcel.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. A piece 30 Ells of fine <HI>Holland</HI> Linnen.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="368" REF="374">
4. A Piece of 18 yds fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> brocaded Silk.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. A Piece of black <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Bays.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q></P>
<P>AFTER I had plac'd the&s;e by them&s;elves, I
found means with &s;ome &s;eeming difficulties, and
much Grimace, to bring him to know that this was
intended for a Pre&s;ent to him&s;elf: After all that
Part was over, and he had &s;eem'd to accept them,
&s;ignified, after walking a hundred Turns and
more in the Room by them, by throwing his Had
which was under his Arm, upon them, and making
a very &s;tiff Bow, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> after this, he &s;eem'd to
take his leave of me, for a while, and I waited
in an Outer-Room, when I was call'd in again;
I found that he had look'd over all the parti|culars,
and caus'd them to be remov'd out of
the Place.</P>
<P>BUT when I came again, I found him quite
another Man; he thank'd me for my Pre&s;ent, told
me it was Pre&s;ent fit to be given to a Viceroy of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> rather than to a meer Governour of a
Fort, that he had done me no Services &s;uitable to
&s;uch a Return, but that he would &s;ee it he could
not oblige me farther before I left the Place.</P>
<P>AFTER our Compliments were over, I ob|tain'd to
have the Corregidore &s;ent for, who ac|cordingly
came, and in his Pre&s;ence the Money
&s;tipulated for the Ran&s;ome of the Ship, and of the
Men was paid.</P>
<P>BUT here the Corregidore &s;hew'd that he
would be as &s;everely ju&s;t on my Side, as on theirs,
for he would not admit the Money as a Ran&s;om
for us as Pri&s;oners, but as a depo&s;ite for &s;o much
as we were to be Ran&s;om'd for, if the Sentence
for our being made Pri&s;oners &s;hould be con|firm'd.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="375">
AND then the Governour and Corregidore
joyning together &s;ent a Repre&s;entation of the
whole Affair, at lea&s;t we were told &s;o to the Vice|roy
of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and it was privately hinted to me,
that I would do well to &s;tay for the Return of
the <HI>Avi&s;o,</HI> that is a Boat which they &s;ent over
the <HI>Bay</HI> to <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> with an Expre&s;s to <HI>Mexi|co,</HI>
who&s;e return is generally perform'd in two
Months.</P>
<P>I WAS not unwilling to &s;tay, having &s;ecret
Hints given me, that I &s;hould find &s;ome way, to
go with my Sloop towards <HI>Vera Cruz</HI> my&s;elf,
where I might have an occa&s;ion to Trade pri|vately,
for the Cargo which I had on Board;
but it came about a nearer way, for about tow
Days after this Money being depo&s;ited, <HI>as above;</HI>
the Governours Son invited him&s;elf on Board
my Sloop, where I told him I would be very
glad to &s;ee him, and whether at the &s;ame time
he brought with him three con&s;iderable Mer|chants
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> Two of them not Inhabitants
of the Place.</P>
<P>WHEN they were on Board, they were very
Merry and Plea&s;ant, and I treated them &s;o much
to their &s;atisfaction, that in &s;hort, they were not
very well able to go on Shoar for that Night, but
were content to take a Nap on &s;ome Carpets,
which I caus'd to be &s;pread for them, and that
the Governour's Son might think him&s;elf well
us'd, I brought him a very good Silk Night-Gown,
with a Crim&s;on Velvet Cap to lye down in, and
in the Morning de&s;ir'd him to accept of them for
his u&s;e, which he took very kindly.</P>
<P>DURING that merry Evening one of the Mer|chants
not &s;o touch'd with Drink as the young
Gentleman, nor &s;o, as not to mind what it was
<PB N="370" REF="376">
he came about; takes an occa&s;ion to withdraw
out of the Great Cabbin, and enter into a Par|lee
with the Ma&s;ter of the Sloop, in order to
Trade for what <HI>European</HI> Goods we had on Board;
the Ma&s;ter took the Hint, and gave me Notice of
what had pa&s;s'd, and I gave him In&s;tructions
what to &s;ay, and what to do, according to which
In&s;tructions they made, but few Words for about
5000 Peices of Eight's, and carried the Goods
away them&s;elves, and at their own hazards.</P>
<P>THIS was very agreeable to me, for now I
began to &s;ee I &s;hould lick my &s;elf whole, by the
Sale of this Cargo, and &s;hould make my &s;elf full
amends of <HI>Jack Spaniard,</HI> for all the injuries he
had done me in the fir&s;t of the&s;e things; with this
View I gave my Ma&s;ter, or Captain of the Sloop
In&s;tructions for Sale of all the re&s;t of the
Goods, and left him to manage by him&s;elf, which
he did &s;o well, that he &s;old the whole Cargo the
next Day to the three <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with this ad|ditional
Circum&s;tance, that they de&s;ir'd the
Sloop might carry the Goods, as they were
on Board, to &s;uch Part of the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> as
they &s;hould appoint between the <HI>Houduras</HI> and
the Coa&s;t of <HI>La Vera Cruz.</HI></P>
<P>It was difficult for me to make good this Part
of the Bargain, but finding the Price agreed for,
would very well an&s;wer the Voyage, I con&s;ent|ed;
but then how to &s;end the Sloop away, and
remain among the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when I was now a
clear Man, this was a difficulty too, as it was al&s;o
to go away, and not wait for a favourable An&s;wer
from the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to the Repre&s;enta|tion
of the Governor and the Corregidore; how|ever
at la&s;t, I re&s;olv'd to go in the Sloop fall out
what would, &s;o I went to the Governor and re|pre&s;ented
<PB N="371" REF="377">
to him, that being now to expect a fa|vourable
An&s;wer from <HI>Mexico,</HI> it would be a great
Lo&s;s to me to keep the Sloop there all the while,
and I de&s;ir'd his leave for me to go with the
Sloop to <HI>Antegoa,</HI> to &s;ell and di&s;po&s;e of the Cargo,
which He well knew I was oblig'd not to
bring on &s;hoar there at the <HI>Havana,</HI> and which
would be in Danger of being &s;poil'd by lying &s;o
long on Board.</P>
<P>THIS I obtain'd readily with Licen&s;e to come
again into the Road, and (for my&s;elf only) to
come on &s;hoar, in order to hear the Viceroy's plea|&s;ure
in my Ca&s;e, which was depending.</P>
<P>HAVING thus obtain'd a Licen&s;e at, or
Pa&s;sport for the Sloop and my&s;elf, I put to Sea
with the three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants on Board with me;
they told me, they did not live at the <HI>Havana,</HI> but
it &s;eems one of them did; and &s;ome rich Merchants
of the <HI>Havana,</HI> or of the Parts thereabouts in
the &s;ame <HI>I&s;land</HI> were concern'd with them, for
they brought on Board that Night we put to Sea
a great Sum of Money in Peices of Eight, and
as I under&s;tood afterwards that the&s;e Merchants
bought the Cargo of me, and tho' they gave me
a very great Price for every thing, yet that they
&s;old them again to the Merchants, who they pro|cur'd
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI> at a prodigious
Advantage; &s;o that they got above a Hundred
<HI>per Cent</HI> after I had gain'd very &s;ufficiently be|fore.</P>
<P>WE &s;ail'd from the <HI>Havana</HI> directly for <HI>Vera
Cruz,</HI> I &s;crupl'd venturing into the Port at fir&s;t,
and was very unea&s;ie, lea&s;t I &s;hould have another
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trick put upon me; but as we &s;ail'd un|der
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colours, they &s;hew'd us &s;uch Authen|tick
<PB N="372" REF="378">
Papers from the proper Officers, that there
was no room to fear any thing.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, when we came in &s;ight of the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, I found that they had a &s;ecret
clande&s;tine Trade to carry on, which tho' it was
Secret, yet they knew the way of it &s;o well, that
it was but a meer Road to them. The Ca&s;e was
this, we &s;tood in clo&s;e under &s;hoar in the Night,
about &s;ix Leagues to the North of the Port, where
two of the Three Merchants went on &s;hoar in
the Boat, and in three Hours, or thereabouts they
came on &s;hoar again with five Canoes, and &s;even or
eight Merchants more with them, and as &s;oon as
they were on Board; we &s;tood off to Sea, &s;o that
by Day-light we were quite out of &s;ight of
Land.</P>
<P>I ought to have mention'd before, that as &s;oon
as we were put out to Sea from the <HI>Havana;</HI> and
during our Voyage into the Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which
was eight Days, we Rumag'd the whole Cargo,
and opening every Bale, as far as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mer|chants
de&s;ired, we Traffick'd with them for the
whole Cargo, except the Barrels of Flower and
Peas.</P>
<P>THIS Cargo was con&s;iderable in it&s;elf, for my
Wife's account, or Invoyce drawn out by my
Tutor, and Manager, amounted to 2684 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI>
and I &s;old the whole, including what had
been &s;old in the Evening, when they were on
Board fir&s;t, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> for 38593 Peices of
Eight, and they allow'd me 1200 Peices of Eight
for the Freight of the Sloop, and made my Ma|&s;ter
and the Seamen very hand&s;ome Pre&s;ents
be&s;ides, and they were well able to do this too,
as you &s;hall hear pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="379">
AFTER we were gotten out of Sight of Land,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fell to their Traffick, and our three
Merchants open'd their Shop, <HI>as they might &s;ay,</HI> for
it was their Shop; as to me, I had nothing to do
with it, or with their Goods; they drove their
Bargain in a few Hours, and at Night we &s;tood
in again for the Shore, when the five Canoes
carry'd a great part of the Goods on Shore, and
brought the Money back in Specie, as well for
that they carry'd, as for all the re&s;t, and at their
Second Voyage carry'd all away clear, leaving
me nothing on Board, but my Barrels of Flower
and Peas, which they bad me Money for too,
but not &s;o much as I expected.</P>
<P>HERE, I found that my <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants
made above 70000 Peices of Eight of the Cargo
I had &s;old them; upon which, I had a great
Mind to be acquainted with tho&s;e Merchants on
the <HI>Terra Ferma,</HI> who were the la&s;t Cu&s;tomers,
for it pre&s;ently occurr'd to me, that I could ea&s;i|ly
go with a Sloop from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and taking a
Cargo directed on purpo&s;e from <HI>England,</HI> of about
five or &s;ix thou&s;and Pound, I might ea&s;ily make
four of one; with this view, I began to make
a kind of an Acquaintance with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
which came in the Canoes, and we became &s;o in|timate,
that at la&s;t, with the Con&s;ent of the
three <HI>Spaniards</HI> of the <HI>Havana,</HI> I accepted an in|vitation
on Shore to their Hou&s;e, which was a
little Villa, or rather Plantation, where they
had an <HI>Ingenio, that is to &s;ay,</HI> a Sugar-hou&s;e, or
Sugar Work, and there they treated us like
Princes.</P>
<P>I took Occa&s;ion, at this Invitation, to &s;ay,
that if I knew how to find my way thither
again, I could vi&s;it them once or twice a Year,
<PB N="374" REF="380">
very much to their Advantage, and mine too;
one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took the Hint; and taking me
into a Room by my &s;elf: Seignior, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> if you
have any Thoughts of coming to this Place again,
I &s;hall give you &s;uch Directions as you &s;hall be
&s;ure not to mi&s;take, and upon either coming
on Shoar in the Night, and coming up to this
Place; or, upon making the Signals which we
&s;hall give you, we will not fail to come off to
you, and bring Money enough for any <HI>Cargai&s;on,
&s;o they call it,</HI> that you &s;hall bring.</P>
<P>I took all their Directions, took their Paroles
of Honour for my Safety, and without taking
any Notice to my fir&s;t three Merchants, laid
up all the re&s;t in my mo&s;t &s;ecret Thoughts, re&s;ol|ving
to vi&s;it them again in as &s;hort a time as I
could; and thus, having in about five Days
fini&s;hed all our Merchandizing, we &s;tood off to
Sea, and made for the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where I
&s;et my three <HI>Spaniards</HI> a Shore, with all their
Trea&s;ure, to their Hearts Content, and made
the be&s;t of my way to <HI>Antegoa;</HI> where, with all
the Di&s;patch I could, I &s;old my 200 Barrels of
Flower; which, however, had &s;uffer'd a little,
by the length of the Voyage; and having
laden the Sloop with Rum, Mola&s;&s;es, and Sugar,
I &s;et Sail again for the <HI>Havana.</HI></P>
<P>I was now unea&s;y, indeed, for Fear of the
Pyrates, for I was a rich Ship, having be&s;ides
Goods, near 40000 Pieces of Eight in Silver.</P>
<P>WHEN I came back to the <HI>Havana,</HI> I went on
Shore, to wait on the Governour, and the Corre|gidore,
and to hear what Return was had from
the Viceroy, and had the good Fortune to know
that the Viceroy had di&s;&s;allow'd that part of the
Sentence which condemn'd us as Pri&s;oners, and
<PB N="375" REF="381">
put a Ran&s;om on us, which he in&s;i&s;ted could
not be, but in time of open War; but as to the
Confi&s;cation, he deferr'd it to the Chamber or
Council of Commerce at <HI>Sevil;</HI> and the Appeal
to the King if &s;uch be preferr'd.</P>
<P>THIS was in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, a very good piece
of Ju&s;tice in the Viceroy; for as we had not been
on Shore, we could not legally be impri&s;oned;
and for the re&s;t, I believe, if I would have given
my &s;elf the Trouble, to have gone to old <HI>Spain,</HI>
and have preferr'd my Claim to both the Ship,
and the Cargo, I had recover'd them al&s;o.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as it was, I was now a free Man,
without Ran&s;om, and my Men were al&s;o free, &s;o
that all the Money which I had depo&s;ited, <HI>as a|bove,</HI>
was return'd me; and thus I took my Leave
of the <HI>Havana,</HI> and made the be&s;t of my way for
<HI>Virginia,</HI> where I arriv'd, after a Year and a
half Ab&s;ence, and notwith&s;tanding all my Lo&s;&s;es,
came Home above 4000 Pieces of Eight richer than
I went out.</P>
<P>As to the old Affair, about the <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Pri&s;o|ners,
that was quite at an End, for the general
Pardon, pa&s;t in Parliament, made me perfectly
ea&s;y, and I took no more Thought about that
Part: I might here very u&s;efully ob&s;erve, how
nece&s;&s;ary and in&s;eperable a Companion, Fear is to
Guilt; it was but a few Months that the Face of
a Poor <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> Tran&s;port, would have frighted
me out of my Wits; to avoid them, I fain'd
my &s;elf Sick, and wrapt my Legs in Flannel,
as if I had the Gout; whereas now, they were
no more Surprize to me, nor was I any more un|ea&s;y
to &s;ee them, than I was to &s;ee any other of
the Servants of the Plantations.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="382">
AND that which was more particular than all,
was, that tho' before I fancied every one of
them would know me, and remember me, and
con&s;equently betray and accu&s;e me; now, tho' I
was frequently among them, and &s;aw mo&s;t of
them, and if not all of them, one time or other;
nay, tho' I remember'd &s;everal of their Faces,
and even &s;ome of their Names, yet there
was not a Man of them, that ever took the
lea&s;t notice of me, or of having known or &s;een
me before.</P>
<P>IT would have been a &s;ingular Satisfaction to
me, if I could have known &s;o much as this of
them before, and had &s;aved me all the Fatiegue,
Hazard, and Misfortune that befel me after|wards;
but Man, a &s;hort &s;ighted Creature,
&s;ees &s;o little before him, that he can neither
anticipate his Joys, nor prevent his Di&s;a&s;ters,
be they at ever &s;o little a Di&s;tance from him.</P>
<P>I had now my Head full of my <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Pro|ject,
and I began to make Provi&s;ion for it according|ly;
I had a full Account of what <HI>European</HI> Goods
were mo&s;t acceptable in <HI>New Spain,</HI> and to add
to my Speed, I knew that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in
great want of <HI>European</HI> Goods; the Galleons from
<HI>Old Spain</HI> having been delay'd, to an unu&s;ual
length of Time, for the two Years before: Upon
this Account, having not time, as I thought, to
&s;end to <HI>England</HI> for a Cargo of &s;uch Goods as
were mo&s;t proper; I re&s;olv'd to load my Sloop
with Tobacco, and with Rum, the la&s;t I brought
from <HI>Antegoa,</HI> and go away to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New$Eng|land,</HI>
and to <HI>New York,</HI> and &s;ee if I could pick up a
Cargo to my Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="383">
ACCORDINGLY, I took 20000 Pieces of Eight
in Money, and my Sloop laden, <HI>as above,</HI> and
taking my Wife with me, we went away; it was
an odd and new Thing at <HI>New-England,</HI> to have
&s;uch a Quantity of Goods bought up there by a
Sloop from <HI>Virginia,</HI> and e&s;pecially to be pay'd
for in ready Money, as I did for mo&s;t of my
Goods; and this &s;et all the Trading Heads upon
the Stretch, to enquire what, and who I was; to
which, they had an immediate and direct An&s;wer,
that I was a very con&s;iderable Planter in <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI>
and that was all, any of my Men on
Board the Sloop could tell of me, and enough
too.</P>
<P>WELL, it was the Cau&s;e of much Speculation
among them, as I heard at &s;econd and third
Hands; &s;ome &s;aid, he is certainly going to <HI>Ja|maica;</HI>
others &s;aid, he is going to Trade with
the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> others, that he is going to the
<HI>South-Sea,</HI> and turn half Merchant, half Pyrate
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chily</HI> and <HI>Peru;</HI> &s;ome one thing,
&s;ome another, as the <HI>Men-Go&s;&s;ips</HI> found their Ima|ginations
directed: But we went on with our Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
and lay'd out 12000 Pieces of Eight, be|&s;ides
our Cargo of Rum and Tobacco, and went
from thence to <HI>New-York,</HI> where we lay'd out the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE chief of the Cargo we bought here, was
fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Broad Cloath, Serges, Drugets, <HI>Nor|wich</HI>
Stuffs, Bays, Says, and all kinds of Woollen
Manufactures, as al&s;o Linnen of all Sorts, a ve|ry
great quantity, and near a thou&s;and Pounds
in fine Sills of &s;everal Sorts.</P>
<P>BEING thus Freighted, I came back &s;afe to <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI>
and with very little Addition to my Cargo,
began to prepare for my <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="384">
I &s;hould have mention'd, that I had built up
on my Sloop, and rai&s;ed her a little &s;o that I had
made her carry Twelve Guns, and fitted her up
for Defence, for I thought &s;he &s;hould not be at|tack'd
and Boarded by a few <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Barco Longos,
as &s;he was before; and I found the Benefit of it
afterwards, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>WE &s;et &s;ail the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and as I
had twice been attack'd by Pyrates in pa&s;&s;ing
the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> or among the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands,
I re&s;olv'd, tho' it was farther about to &s;tand off
to Sea, and &s;o keep as I believ'd it would be, out
of the way of them.</P>
<P>WE pa&s;s'd the Tropick, as near as we could
gue&s;s, ju&s;t where the famous Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI>
fi&s;h'd up the Silver from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plate Wreck,
and &s;tanding in between the I&s;lands, kept our
Cour&s;e W. by S. keeping under the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI>
and &s;o running away, Trade, as they call it, into
the Great Gulph of <HI>Mexico,</HI> leaving the I&s;land
of <HI>Jamaica</HI> to the S. and S. E. by this means a|voiding,
as I thought, all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Cuba,</HI>
or the <HI>Havana.</HI></P>
<P>As we pa&s;s'd the We&s;t Point of <HI>Cuba,</HI> three
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Boats came off to Board us, as they had
done before, on the other Side of the I&s;land; but
they found them&s;elves mi&s;taken, we were too
many for them, for we run out our Guns, which
they not did perceive before, and firing three or
four Shot at them, they retir'd.</P>
<P>THE next Morning they appear'd again, be|ing
five large Boats, and a Bark, and gave us
Cha&s;e; but we then &s;pread our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colours
and brought too to Fight them, at which they re|tir'd,
&s;o we e&s;cap'd this Danger by the addition
of Force which we had made to our Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="385">
WE now had a fair run our Port, and as
I had taken very good Directions, I &s;tood away
to the North of St. <HI>John d' Ulva,</HI> and then run|ing
in for the &s;hoar found the Place appointed ex|actly,
and going on &s;hoar, I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter of
my Sloop directly to the Ingenio&punc; where he found
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchant at his Hou&s;e, and where he
dwelt like a little Sovereign Prince, who welcome'd
him, and under&s;tanding that I was in a particu|lar
Boat at the <HI>Creek,</HI> as appointed, he came im|mediately
with him, and bringing another
<HI>Spaniard</HI> from a <HI>Villa</HI> not far off, in about four
Hours they were with me.</P>
<P>THEY would have per&s;waded me to go up to
their Hou&s;es, and have &s;taid there till the next
Night, ordering the Sloop to &s;tand off as u&s;ual
but I would not con&s;ent to let the Sloop go to Sea,
without me, &s;o we went on Board directly, and as
the Night was almo&s;t run, &s;tood of to Sea, &s;o by
Day-break we were quite out of Sight of Land.</P>
<P>HERE we began, <HI>as I &s;aid</HI> before, to open
Shop, and I found the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were extreamly
&s;urpriz'd at &s;eeing &s;uch a Cargo, I mean &s;o large;
for in &s;hort, they had cared not if it had been four
times as much: They &s;oon ran thro' the Contents
of all the Bales we open'd that Night, and with
very little Di&s;pute about the Price they approv'd,
and accepted all that I &s;how'd them; but as they
&s;aid they had not Money for any greater Parcel,
they agreed to go on &s;hoar the next Evening
for more Mony.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, we &s;pent the remainder of the
Night in looking over, and making Inventories,
or Invoyces of the re&s;t of the Cargo, that &s;o they
might &s;ee the Goods, know the Value, and know
what more Money they had to bring.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="386">
ACCORDINGLY, in the Evening we &s;tood in
for the &s;hoar, and they carried part of the Cargo
with them, borrowing the Sloops Boot to a&s;&s;i&s;t
them, and after they had lodg'd, and Landed the
Goods, they came on Board again, bringing three
of the other Merchants with them, who were con|cern'd
before, and Money enough to clear the
whole Ship, ay, and Ship and all, if I had been
willing to &s;ell her.</P>
<P>To give them their Due, they dealt with me
like Men of Honour; they were indeed &s;en&s;ible
that they bought every thing much Cheaper of me,
than they did before of the three Merchants of the
<HI>Havana;</HI> the&s;e Merchants having been as it were
the Huck&s;ters, and bought them fir&s;t of me, and
then advanc'd, as I have &s;aid, above 100 <HI>per Cent</HI>
upon the Price they gave me; but yet at the &s;ame
time I advanc'd in the Price much more now, than
I did before to the &s;aid <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor was it with|out
Rea&s;on, becau&s;e of the length, and ri&s;que of
the Voyage, both out and home, which now lay
wholly upon me.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, I &s;old the whole Cargo to them, and
for which I receiv'd near two Hundred Thou&s;and
Pieces of Eight in Money, be&s;ides which, when
they came on Board the &s;econd time they brought
all their Boats loaden with fre&s;h Provi&s;ions,
Hogs, Sheep, Fowls, Sweetmeats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> enough
for my whole Voyage, all which they made a
Pre&s;ent to me of, and thus we fini&s;h'd our Traf|fick
to our mutal Satisfaction, and parted with
Promi&s;es of farther Commerce, and with a&s;&s;u|rances
on their part of all acts of Friend&s;hip, and
A&s;&s;i&s;tance that I could de&s;ire, if any Di&s;a&s;ter
&s;hould befal me in any of the&s;e Adventures; as
indeed was not improbable, con&s;idering the &s;trict|ne&s;s
<PB N="381" REF="387">
and &s;everity of their Cu&s;toms, in Ca&s;e a|ny
People were taken Trading upon their Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>I immediately call'd a Council with my little
Crew, which way we &s;hould go back; the Mate
was for beating it up to Windward, and getting
up to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but as we were too rich to run
any Ri&s;ques, and were to take the be&s;t Cour&s;e to
get &s;afe Home, I thought, and &s;o did the Ma&s;ter
of the Sloop, that our be&s;t way was to Coa&s;t a|bout
the Bay, and keeping the &s;hoar of <HI>Florida</HI>
on Board, make the &s;horte&s;t Cour&s;e to the Gulph,
and &s;o make for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and to put
in there into the fir&s;t Port we could, and wait
for any <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> of War that might be on the
Coa&s;t to &s;ecure us to the <HI>Capes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the be&s;t Cour&s;e we could take, and
prov'd very &s;afe to us, excepting that about the
Cape of <HI>Florida,</HI> and on the Coa&s;t in the Gulph,
till we came the height of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine;</HI> we were
&s;everal times vi&s;ited with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Barco
Longos, and &s;mall Barks, in hope of making a
Prize of us; but carrying <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colours, de|ceiv'd
mo&s;t of them, and a good Tire of Guns
kept the re&s;t at a di&s;tance; &s;o that we came
&s;afe, tho' once or twice in Danger of being run
on &s;hoar by a Storm of Wind; I &s;ay we came
&s;afe into <HI>Charles</HI> River in <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence I found means to &s;end a Letter
home, with an Account to my Wife of my good
Succe&s;s and having an Account that the Coa&s;t was
clear of Pyrates, tho' there were no Men of War
in the Place, I ventur'd forward; and in &s;hort,
got &s;afe into the Bay of <HI>Che&s;apeak,</HI> that is to &s;ay,
within the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and in a few days
more to my own Hou&s;e, having been ab&s;ent three
Months, and four days.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="388">
NEVER did any Ve&s;&s;el on this &s;ide the World
make a better Voyage in &s;o &s;hort a time, than I
made in this Sloop, for by the mo&s;t moderate
Computation, I clear'd in the&s;e three Months five
and Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling in ready
Money all the Charges of the Voyage to <HI>New-England</HI>
al&s;o being reckon'd up.</P>
<P>NOW was my time to have &s;at &s;till contented
with what I had got; if it was in the power of
Man to know when his good Fortune was at the
highe&s;t; and more, my prudent Wife gave it as her
Opinion, that I &s;hould &s;it down &s;atisfy'd, and
pu&s;h the Affair no farther, and earne&s;tly per|&s;waded
me to do &s;o; but I that had a Door open,
as I thought to immen&s;e Trea&s;ure, that had found
the way to have a Stream of the Golden Rivers of
<HI>Mexico</HI> flow into my Plantation of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and
&s;aw no hazards, more then what was common to
all &s;uch things in the Pro&s;ecution; <HI>I &s;ay</HI> to me,
the&s;e things look'd with another Face, and I
Dream'd of nothing but Millions and Hundred of
Thou&s;ands; &s;o contrary to all moderate Mea&s;ures,
I pu&s;h'd on for another Voyage, and laid up a Stock
of all &s;orts of Goods that I could get together
proper for the Trade; I did not indeed go again
to <HI>New-England,</HI> for I had by this time a very
good Cargo come from <HI>England,</HI> pur&s;uant to a
Commi&s;&s;ion, I had &s;ent &s;everal Months before; &s;o
that in &s;hort, my Cargo, according to the In|voyce
now made up, amounted to above ten Thou|&s;and
Pounds Sterling fir&s;t Co&s;t, and was a Cargo
&s;o &s;orted, and &s;o well bought, that I expected to
have advanc'd upon them much more in proporti|on
than I had done in the Cargo before.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="389">
WITH the&s;e Expectations, we began our &s;e|cond
Voyage, in <HI>April,</HI> being about five Months
after our Return from the Fir&s;t; we had not indeed
the &s;ame good Speed, even in our Beginning, as
we had at fir&s;t, for tho' we &s;tood off to Sea about
60 Leagues, in order to be out of the Way of the
Pyrates, yet we had not been above five Days at
Sea, but we were vi&s;ited and rifled by two Py|rate
Barks, who being Bound to the <HI>Northward,
that is to &s;ay,</HI> the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> took
away all our Provi&s;ions, and all our Ammunition,
and &s;mall Arms, and left us very ill provided to
per&s;ue our Voyage; and it being &s;o near Home,
we thought it advi&s;able to come about, and &s;tand
in for the Capes again, to re&s;tore our Condition,
and furni&s;h our &s;elves with Stores of all Kinds
for our Voyage; this took us up about 10 Days,
and we put to Sea again; as for our Cargo, the
Pyrates did not meddle with it, being all Bale
Goods, which they had no pre&s;ent U&s;e for,
and knew not what to do with, if they had
them.</P>
<P>WE met with no other Adventure, worth
naming, till by the &s;ame Cour&s;e that we had
&s;teer'd before, we came into the Gulph of <HI>Mexi|co,</HI>
and the fir&s;t Misfortune we met with here,
was, that on the Back of <HI>Cuba,</HI> cro&s;&s;ing towards
the Point of the <HI>Terra Ferma,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Jucatan,</HI> we had Sight of the Flota of <HI>New
Spain, that is,</HI> of the Ships which come from <HI>Car|thagena</HI>
or <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> and go to the <HI>Havana,</HI>
in order to per&s;ue their Voyage to <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>THEY had with them one <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of
War, and three Frigats; two of the Frigats gave
us Cha&s;e, but it being ju&s;t at the &s;hutting in of the
Day, we &s;oon lo&s;t Sight of them, and &s;tand|ing
<PB N="384" REF="390">
to the <HI>North</HI> cro&s;s the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> as if
we were going to the Mouth of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi,</HI> they
lo&s;t us quite, and in a few Days more we made
the bottom of the Bay, being the Port we were
bound for.</P>
<P>WE &s;tood in as u&s;ual, in the Night, and gave
Notice to our Friends, but in &s;tead of their for|mer
Readine&s;s to come on Board; they gave us
Notice, that we had been &s;een in the Bay, and
that Notice of us was given at <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> and at
other Places, and that &s;everal Frigats were in
Que&s;t of us, and that three more would be Crui|&s;ing
the next Morning in &s;earch for us.</P>
<P>WE could not conceive how this could be;
but we were afterwards told, that tho&s;e three Fri|gats,
having lo&s;t Sight of us in the Night, had
made in for the Shore, and had given the Allarm
of us, as of Privateers.</P>
<P>BE that as it would, we had nothing to do,
but to Con&s;ider what Cour&s;e to take immediate|ly,
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants Advice was very
good if we had taken it, namely, to have unla|den
as many of our Bails as we could that very
Night, by the help of our Boat and their <HI>Canoes,</HI>
and to make the be&s;t of our Way in the Morn|ing,
to the <HI>North</HI> of the Gulph, and take our
Fate.</P>
<P>THIS my Skipper, or Ma&s;ter, thought very
well of, but when we began to put it in Execution,
we were &s;o confus'd, and in &s;uch a Hurry, being
not re&s;olv'd what Cour&s;e to take, that we could not
get out above &s;ixteen Bales of all &s;orts of Goods,
before it began to be too light, and we behov'd
to &s;et Sail; at la&s;t, the Ma&s;ter propo&s;s'd a Medium,
which was that I &s;hould go on Shore in the next
Boat, in which was five Bales of Goods more,
<PB N="385" REF="391">
and that I &s;hould &s;tay on &s;hoar, if the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Merchants would undertake to conceal me, and
let them go to Sea, and take their Chance.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants readily undertook to
protect me, e&s;pecially it being &s;o ea&s;ie to have
me pa&s;s for a natural <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and &s;o they took
me on &s;hoar with 21 Bales of my Goods, and the
Sloop &s;tood off 10 Sea; if they met with any E|nemies,
they were to &s;tand in for the &s;hoar the
next Night, and we fail'd not to look well out
for them, but to no purpo&s;e, for the next Day
they were di&s;cover'd and Cha&s;ed by two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Fregates; they &s;tood from them, and the Sloop
being an excellent Sailor gain'd &s;o much that they
would certainly have been clear of them w'en
Night came on, but a &s;mall Picarcon of a Sloop
kept them Company in &s;pight of all they could do,
and two or three times offe'd to Engage them,
thereby to give time to the re&s;t to come up, but
the Sloop kept her way, and gave them a Cha&s;e
of three Days and Nights, having a fre&s;h Gale
of Wind, at South We&s;t, till &s;he made the <HI>Rio
Grand,</HI> or as the <HI>French</HI> call it the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi,</HI> and
there finding no remedy, they run the Ve&s;&s;el on
&s;hoar, not far from the Fort, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
call <HI>Pen&s;acola,</HI> Garri&s;on'd at that time with <HI>French;</HI>
our Men would have enter'd the River as a Port,
but having no Pilot, and the Current of the River
being &s;trong again&s;t them, the Sloop run on &s;hoar,
and the Men &s;hifted as well as they could in
their Boats.</P>
<P>I was now in a very odd Condition indeed, my
Circum&s;tances were in one Sen&s;e indeed very happy;
Namely, that I was in the Hands of my Friends,
for &s;uch really they were, and &s;o faithful, that
no Men could have been more careful of their own
<PB N="386" REF="392">
Safety than were they of mine, and that which ad|ded
to the comfort of my new Condition, was the
produce of my Goods, which were gotten on
&s;hoar by their own Advice and Direction, which
was a Fund &s;ufficient to Maintain me with them
as long as I could be &s;uppos'd to &s;tay there; and, if
not the fir&s;t Merchant to who&s;e Hou&s;e I went,
a&s;&s;ur'd me, that he would give me Credit for twen|ty
Thou&s;and Pieces of Eight, if I had occa&s;ion
for it.</P>
<P>MY greate&s;t Affliction was, that I knew not
how to convey News to my Wife, of my pre&s;ent
Condition, and how among the many Misfortunes
of the Voyage I was yet &s;afe, and in good
Hands.</P>
<P>BUT there was no remedy for this Part, but
the great univer&s;al Cure of all incurable Sorrows,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Patience, and indeed I had a great deal of
Rea&s;on, not for Patience only, but Thankfulne&s;s,
if I had known the Circum&s;tances, which I &s;hould
have been reduc'd to, if I had fallen into the
Hands of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> the be&s;t of which that I
could rea&s;onably have expected, had been, to have
been &s;ent to the Mines, or which was ten Thou|&s;and
times wor&s;e, the Inqui&s;ition; or if I had
e&s;cap'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as my Men in the Sloop
did, the Hard&s;hips they were expos'd to, the
Dangers they were in, and the Mi&s;eries they &s;uffer|ed,
were &s;till wor&s;e, in wandering among Savages,
and the more Savage <HI>French,</HI> who plunder'd and
&s;trip'd them, in&s;tead of relieving, and &s;upplying
them in their long wilderne&s;s Journey over the
Mountains, till they reach'd the S. W. parts of
South <HI>Carolina.</HI> A Journey, which indeed de&s;erves
to have an Account to be given of it by it&s;elf; <HI>I
&s;ay,</HI> all the&s;e things had I known of them would
<PB N="387" REF="393">
have let me &s;ee that I had a great deal of Rea&s;on,
not only to be Patient, under my pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances
but &s;atisfy'd, and thankful.</P>
<P>HERE, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> my Patron the Merchant
entertain'd me like a Prince, he made my &s;afety
his peculiar Care, and while we were in any Ex|pectation
of the Sloop being taken, and brought
into <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> he kept me retired at a little
Hou&s;e in a Wood, where he kept a fine <HI>Avery</HI> of
all &s;orts of <HI>American</HI> Birds, and out of which he
Yearly &s;ent &s;ome as Pre&s;ents to his Friends in old
<HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Retreat was nec&s;&s;ary, lea&s;t if the Sloop
&s;hould be taken, and brought into <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> and
the Men be brought in Pri&s;oners, they &s;hould be
tempted to give an Account of me as their Super
Cargo, or Merchant, and where both I and the
21 Bales of Goods were &s;et on &s;hoar; as for the
Goods he made &s;ure Work with them, for they
were all open'd, taken out of the Bales, and &s;e|parated,
and being mix'd with other <HI>European</HI>
Goods, which came by the Galeons, where made
up in new Package, and &s;ent to <HI>Mexico</HI> in &s;everal
Parcels, &s;ome to one Merchant, &s;ome to another;
&s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to have found them out,
even if they had had Information of them.</P>
<P>IN this Po&s;ture, and in Apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome
bad News of the Sloop, I remain'd at the Villa,
or Hou&s;e in the Vale, for &s;o they call'd it, about
five Weeks; I had two <HI>Negroes</HI> appointed to wait
on me, one of which was my Purvor, or my
Cook, the other my Valet; and my Friend, the
Ma&s;ter of all came con&s;tantly every Evening to
Vi&s;it, and Sup with me, when we walk'd out to|gether
into the <HI>Avery,</HI> which was of its kind, the
mo&s;t beautiful thing that ever I &s;aw in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="394">
AFTER above five Weeks retreat of this
kind, he had good Intelligence of the Fate of the
Sloop, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the two Fregates, and a Sloop had
Chas'd her till &s;he ran on Ground near the Fort of
<HI>Pen&s;acola,</HI> that they &s;aw her &s;trand'd and broke in
pieces by the force of the Waves, the Men making
their e&s;cape in their Boat. This News was brought
it &s;eems by the &s;aid Fregates to <HI>La Vera Cruz,</HI>
where my Friend went on purpo&s;e to be fully
inform'd, and receiv'd the Account from one of
the Captains of the Fregates, and di&s;cours'd with
him at large about it.</P>
<P>I was better pleas'd with the lo&s;s of the
Sloop, and all my Cargo, the Men being got a
Shoar, and e&s;caping, than I &s;hould have $een
with the &s;aving the whole Cargo, if the Men had
fallen into the Hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for now
I was &s;afe, whereas then it being &s;uppos'd
they would have been forc'd to &s;ome di&s;covery a|bout
me, I mu&s;t have fled, and &s;hould have found it
very difficult to have made my E&s;cape, even with
all that my Friends could have done for me too.</P>
<P>BUT now I was perfectly ea&s;ie, and my
Friend, who thought confining me at the Hou&s;e in
the Vale, no longer needful, brought me publickly
home to his dwelling Hou&s;e, as a Merchant come
from old <HI>Spain,</HI> by the la&s;t Galeons, and who ha|ving
been at <HI>Mexico</HI> was come to re&s;ide with him.</P>
<P>HERE I was dre&s;s'd like a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of the
better &s;ort, had three <HI>Negroes</HI> to attend me, and
was call'd <HI>Don Ferdinand de Villa More&s;a,</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;ti|lia
Veja, that is to &s;ay,</HI> in <HI>Old Ca&s;tile.</HI></P>
<P>HERE I had nothing to do but to walk about,
and ride out into the Woods, and come home
again to enjoy the plea&s;ante&s;t, and mo&s;t agree|able
<PB N="389" REF="395">
Retirement in the World; for certainly no
Men in the World live in &s;uch &s;plendor, and wal|low
in &s;uch immen&s;e Trea&s;ures, as the Merchants
of this Place.</P>
<P>THEY live, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> in a Kind of Coun|try
Retreat at their <HI>Villa's,</HI> or, as we would
call them, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> their Plantations, <HI>and as
they do call them,</HI> their <HI>Ingenio's,</HI> where they
make their Indigo, and their Sugars: but they
have al&s;o Hou&s;es, and Ware-hou&s;es, at <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI>
where they go twice a Year, when the Galeons
arrive from <HI>Old Spain;</HI> and when tho&s;e Galeons
r$lade for their return; and it was &s;urprizing to
me, when I went to <HI>la Vera Cruz</HI> with them,
to &s;ee what prodigious Con&s;ignments they had
from their Corre&s;pondents in <HI>Old Spain,</HI> and with
what Di&s;patch they mannag'd them; for no
&s;ooner were the Ca&s;es, Packs, and Bales of <HI>Eu|ropean</HI>
Goods brought into their Ware-hou&s;es, but
they were open'd, and repack'd by Porters, and
Packers of their own, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> Negroes,
and <HI>Indian</HI> Servants; and being made up in|to
new Bales, and &s;eparate Parcels were all
di&s;patch'd again, by Hor&s;es, for <HI>Mexico,</HI> and di|rected
to their &s;everal Merchants there; and
the remainder carry'd home, <HI>as above,</HI> to the
<HI>Ingenio,</HI> where they liv'd, which was near 30
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles from <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> &s;o that in about
20 Days, their Ware-hou&s;es were again entirely
free, at <HI>la Vera Cruz,</HI> all their Bu&s;ine&s;s was
over there; and they, and all their Servants re|tir'd;
for they &s;tay'd no longer there than needs
mu&s;t, becau&s;e of the unhealthine&s;s of the Air.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="396">
AFTER the Goods were thus di&s;patch'd, it was
equally Surprizing, to &s;ee how &s;oon, and with
what Exactne&s;s, the Merchants of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to
whom tho&s;e Cargoes were &s;eparately Con&s;ign'd,
made the Return, and how it came all in Silver,
or in Gold; &s;o that their Ware hou&s;es, in a few
Months, were piled up, even to the Ceiling,
with Che&s;ts of Pieces of Eight, and with Bars
of Silver.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe in the narrow Com|pa&s;s
of this Work, with what Exactne&s;s, and Or|der,
and yet, with how little Hurry, and not
the lea&s;t Confu&s;ion, every thing was done; and
how &s;oon a Weight of Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch Importance
and Value, was negotiated and fini&s;h'd, the Goods
repack'd, Invoyces made, and every thing di&s;|patch'd
and gone; &s;o that in about five Weeks,
all the Goods they had receiv'd from <HI>Europe,</HI> by
the Galeons were di&s;po&s;ed of, and entered in
their Journals, to the proper Account of the Mer|chant,
to whom they were re&s;pectively con&s;ign'd;
from thence they had Book-keepers, who drew
out the Invoyces, and wrote the Letters, which
the Merchant him&s;elf only read over, and Sign'd,
and then other Hands copy'd all again, into other
Books.</P>
<P>I can give no E&s;timate of the Value of the &s;e|veral
Con&s;ignments they receiv'd by that Flota;
but I remember, that when the Galeons went
back, they Ship'd on Board, at &s;everal Times,
one Million three hundred Thou&s;and Pieces of
Eight, in Specie, be&s;ides 180 Bales or Bags of
Cochoneal, and about 300 Bales of Indigo; but
they were &s;o Mode&s;t, <HI>that they &s;aid,</HI> this was for
them&s;elves, and their Friends; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> the
<PB N="391" REF="397">
&s;everal Merchants of <HI>Mexico,</HI> con&s;ign'd large
Quantities of Bullion to them, to Ship on Board,
and con&s;ign according to their Order; but then
I know al&s;o, that for all that, they were allow'd
Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;o that their Gain, was very con&s;i|derable,
even that way al&s;o.</P>
<P>I had been with them at <HI>la Vera Cruz,</HI> and came
back again before we came to an Account for
the Goods which I had brought on Shore, in the
21 Bales; which by the Account we brought them
to, leaving the Piece of every thing to be govern'd
by our la&s;t Market, amounted to 8570 Pieces of
Eight, all which Money, my Friend, <HI>for &s;o I
mu&s;t now call him,</HI> brought me in Specie, and
cau&s;ed his <HI>Negroes</HI> to pile them up in one Corner
of my Apartment; &s;o that I was indeed, &s;till
very Rich, all things con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>THERE was a Bale which I had cau&s;ed to be
pack'd up on purpo&s;e in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and which in|deed,
I had written for from <HI>England,</HI> being
chiefly of Fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Broad Cloaths, Silk, Silk-Druggets,
and fine Stuffs of &s;everal Kinds, with
&s;ome very fine Hollands, which I &s;et a part for
Pre&s;ents, as I &s;hould find Occa&s;ion; and as what
ever Hurry I was in, at carrying the 21 Bales of
Goods on Shore, I did not forget to let this Bale be
one of them, &s;o when we came to a Sale for the
Re&s;t, I told them, that was a Pack with Cloaths
and Nece&s;&s;aries for my own Wearing and U&s;e,
and &s;o de&s;ired it might not be open'd with the
re&s;t; which was accordingly ob&s;erv'd, and that
Bale, or Pack was brought into my Apart|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="398">
THIS Bale, was in general, made up of &s;eve|ral
&s;maller Bales, which I had directed, &s;o that I
might have Room to make Pre&s;ents, equally
&s;orted as the Circum&s;tance might direct me:
However, they were all con&s;iderable, and I
reckon'd the whole Bale co&s;t me near 200 <HI>l. Ster|ling,</HI>
in <HI>England;</HI> and tho' my pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances
requir'd &s;ome Limits to my Bounty, in
making Pre&s;ents, yet the Obligation I was under,
being &s;o much the greater, e&s;pecially, to this one
friendly Generous <HI>Spaniard;</HI> I thought I could not
do better than by opening two of the &s;maller Bales
joyn them together, and make my Gift &s;ome|thing
&s;uitable to the Benefactor, and to the Re|&s;pect
he had &s;hewn me; accordingly, I took
two Bales, and laying the Goods together; the
Contents were as follows.</P>
<Q><P>TWO Pieces of fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> broad Cloth, the
fine&s;t that could be got in <HI>London,</HI> divided
as was that which I gave to the Governor at
the <HI>Havana,</HI> into fine Crim&s;on in Grain, fine
light Mixtures, and fine Black.</P>
<P>FOUR Pieces of fine <HI>Holland,</HI> of 7<HI>s.</HI> to 8<HI>s. per</HI>
Ell in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>TWELVE Pieces of fine Silk Drugget, and <HI>du
Roys,</HI> for Men's Ware.</P>
<P>SIX Peices of Broad Silks, 2 Damasks, 2 Bro|caded
Silks, and 2 Mantuas.</P>
<P>WITH a Box of Ribbons, and a Box of Lace,
the la&s;t Co&s;t about 40<HI>l. Sterling,</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P></Q>
<P>THIS hand&s;ome Parcel I laid open in my Ap|partment,
and brought him up Stairs one Morn|ing,
on Pretence to drink <HI>Chocolate</HI> with me,
<PB N="393" REF="399">
which he ordinarily did; when as we drank <HI>Cho|colate,</HI>
and was merry, <HI>I &s;aid to him,</HI> tho I had
&s;old him almo&s;t all my Cargo, and taken his Mo|ney;
yet the Truth was, that I ought not to
have &s;old them to him, but to have lay'd them
all at his Feet, for that it was to his Direction
I ow'd the having any thing &s;av'd at all.</P>
<P>HE &s;mil'd, and with a great deal of Friend|&s;hip
in his Face, <HI>told me,</HI> that not to have paid
me for them, would have been to have plun|der'd
a Shipwreck, which had been wor&s;e than to
have robb'd an Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t I told him, I had two Reque&s;ts to
make to him, which mu&s;t not be deny'd, <HI>I
told him,</HI> I had a &s;mall pre&s;ent to make to him,
which I would give him a Rea&s;on why he
&s;hould not refu&s;e to accept: And the &s;econd
Reque&s;t I would make after the Fir&s;t was grant|ed.
He &s;aid he would have accepted any Pre&s;ent
from me, if I had not been under a Di&s;&s;a&s;ter,
but as it was, it would be cruel and ungenerous.
But, <HI>I told him,</HI> he was oblig'd to hear my Rea|&s;on
for his accepting it: <HI>Then I told him,</HI> that
this Parcel was made up for him by Name, by
my Wife, and I, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and his Name &s;et
on the Marks of the Bale, and accordingly, I
&s;hew'd him the Marks, which was indeed, on
one of the Bales, but I had doubled it now, <HI>as a|bove,</HI>
&s;o that I told him the&s;e were his Own pro|per
Goods; and in &s;hort, I pre&s;s'd him &s;o to re|ceive
them, that he made a Bow, and I &s;aid no
more, but order'd my <HI>Negro, that is to &s;ay,</HI> his
<HI>Negro</HI> that waited on me, to carry them all ex|cept
the two Boxes into his Apartments, but
would not let him &s;ee the Particulars, till they
were all carry'd away.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="400">
AFTER he was gone, about a Quarter of an
Hour, he came in raving, and almo&s;t &s;wearing,
and in a great Pa&s;&s;ion, but I could ea&s;ily &s;ee, he was
exceedingly plea&s;ed; and told me, had he known
the Particulars, he would never have &s;uffer'd
them to have gone, as he did, and at la&s;t u&s;ed the
very &s;ame Compliment, that the Governour at
the <HI>Havana</HI> u&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was a Pre&s;ent,
fit for a Viceroy of <HI>Mexico,</HI> rather than for him.</P>
<P>WHEN he had done, <HI>he then told me,</HI> he re|member'd
I had two Reque&s;ts to him, and that
one was not to be told till after the fir&s;t was
granted, and he hoped now, I had &s;omething to
ask of him, that was equal to the Obligation I
had lay'd upon him.</P>
<P>I told him, I knew it was not the Cu&s;tom in
<HI>Spain,</HI> for a Stranger to make Pre&s;ents to the
Ladies; and that I would not in the lea&s;t doubt,
but that whatever the Ladies of his Family re|quir'd,
as proper for their U&s;e, he would appro|priate
to them as he thought fit. But that there
was two little Boxes in the Parcel, which my
Wife, with her own Hand had directed to the
Ladies; and I beg'd he would be pleas'd with his
own Hand to give them in my Wife's Name as
directed; that I was only the Me&s;&s;enger, but
that I could not be hone&s;t, if I did not di&s;charge
the Tru&s;t repo&s;'d my&s;elf of.</P>
<P>THESE were the two Boxes of Ribbands, and
Lace, which knowing the nicety of the Ladies in
<HI>Spain,</HI> or rather of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> about their Wo|men
I had made my Wife pack up, and direct with
her own hand, <HI>as I have &s;aid.</HI></P>
<P>HE &s;mil'd, and told me it was true, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
did not ordinarily, admit &s;o much Free|dom
among the Women, as other Nations; but
<PB N="395" REF="401">
he hop'd, <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> I would not think the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
thought all their Women Whores, or that
all <HI>Spaniards</HI> where jealous of their Wive's: That
as to my Pre&s;ent, &s;ince he had agreed to accept
of it; I &s;hould have the Directing of what Part
I pleas'd to his Wife and Daughters; for he had
three Daughters.</P>
<P>HERE I &s;train'd Courtifies again, and told him
by No means, I would direct nothing of that
kind, I only beg'd that he would with his own
Hand pre&s;ent to his <HI>Donna,</HI> or Lady, the Pre&s;ent
de&s;ign'd them by my Wife, and that he would
Pre&s;ent it in her Name now living in <HI>Virginia.</HI> He
was extreamly pleas'd with the nicety I us'd; and
I$&s;aw him Pre&s;ent it to her accordingly, and could
&s;ee at the opening of it, that &s;he was extreamly
pleas'd with the Pre&s;ent it &s;elf, as indeed, &s;he
might very well be, for in that Country it was
worth a very con&s;iderable Sum of Money.</P>
<P>THO' I was us'd with an uncommon Friend|&s;hip
before, and nothing could well be de&s;ir'd
more, yet the grateful Sen&s;e I &s;hew'd of it, in
the Magnificence of this Pre&s;ent was not lo&s;t, and
the whole Family appear'd &s;en&s;ible of it; &s;o that
I mu&s;t allow that Pre&s;ents, where they can be
made in &s;uch a manner, are not without their in|fluence,
where the Per&s;ons were not at all Merce|nary,
either before or after.</P>
<P>I had here now a mo&s;t happy, and comforta|ble
Retreat, tho' it was a kind of an Exile;
here I enjoy'd every thing I could think of, that
was agreeable and plea&s;ant, except only a Liberty
of going home, which for that Rea&s;on, perhaps
was the only thing I de&s;ir'd in the World; for
the grief of one ab&s;ent Comfort is oftentimes
capable of inbittering all the other Enjoyments
in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="402">
HERE I enjoy'd the Moments which I had never
before known how to employ. I mean, that here
I learn'd to look back upon a long ill-&s;pent Life,
ble&s;s'd with infinite Advantage, which I had no
Heart given me till now to make u&s;e of, and
here I found ju&s;t Reflections were the unmo&s;t Fe|licity
of human Life.</P>
<P>HERE I wrote the&s;e Memoirs having to add,
to the Plea&s;ure of looking back with due Reflecti|ons,
the Benefit of a violent Fit of the Gout,
which as it is allow'd by mo&s;t People, clears
the Head, re&s;tores the Memory, and Qualifies
us to make the mo&s;t, and ju&s;t, and u&s;erul Re|marks
upon our own Actions.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, when I wrote the&s;e things down,
I did not fore&s;ee that the Writings of our own
Stories would be &s;o much the Fa&s;hion in <HI>England,</HI>
or &s;o agreeable to others to read, as I find Cu|&s;tom,
and the Humour of the Times has caus'd it
to be; if any one that reads my Story, plea&s;es to
make the &s;ame ju&s;t Reflections, which I acknow|ledge,
I ought to have made; he will reap the be|nefit
of my Misfortunes, perhaps, more than I
have done my&s;elf; 'tis evident by the long Series
of Changes, and Turns, which have appear'd in
the narrow Compa&s;s of one private mean Per&s;on's
Life, that the Hi&s;tory of Men's Lives may
he many ways made U&s;eful, and In&s;tructing to
tho&s;e who read them, if moral and religious Im|provement,
and Reflections are made by tho&s;e
that write them.</P>
<P>THERE remains many things in the Cour&s;e
of this unhappy Life of mine, tho'I have left
&s;o little a part of it to &s;peak of that are worth
giving a large, and di&s;tinct Account of, and which
give Room for ju&s;t Reflections of a Kind which I
<PB N="397" REF="403">
have not made yet; particularly, I think it ju&s;t
to add how in collecting the various Changes,
and Turns of my Affairs, I &s;aw clearer than
ever I had done before, how an invi&s;ible over|ruling
Power, a Hand influenced from above, Go|verns
all our Actions of every Kind, limits
all our De&s;igns, and orders the Events of every
Thing relating to us.</P>
<P>AND from this Ob&s;ervation it nece&s;&s;arily oc|curr'd
to me, how ju&s;t it was, that we &s;hould
pay the homage of all Events to him; that as he
guided, and had even made the Chain of Cau&s;es,
and Con&s;equences, which Nature in general &s;trict|ly
obey'd, &s;o to him &s;hould be given the Honour
of all Events, the Con&s;equences of tho&s;e Cau&s;es,
as the fir&s;t Mover, and Maker of all Things.</P>
<P>I WHO had hitherto liv'd, as might be truly
&s;aid, <HI>without God in the World,</HI> began now to &s;ee
farther into all tho&s;e Things, than I had ever yet
been capable of before, and this brought me at la&s;t
to look with &s;hame and blu&s;hes, upon &s;uch a
Cour&s;e of Wickedne&s;s, as I had gone through
in the World: I had been bred indeed to nothing
of either religious, or moral Knowledge; what
I gain'd of e$tner, was fir&s;t by the little time of
civil Life, which I liv'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where my
abhorrence of the wickedne&s;s of my Captain
and Comrade, and &s;ome &s;ober religious Company
I fell into, fir&s;t gave me &s;ome Knowledge of
Good and Evil, and &s;hew'd me the Beauty of a
&s;ober religious Life, tho' with my leaving
that Country, it &s;oon left me too; or &s;econdly,
the mode&s;t Hints, and ju&s;t Reflections of my
Steward, who I call'd my Tutor, who was a Man
of &s;incere Religion, good Principles, and a re$$
<PB N="398" REF="404">
true Penitent for his pa&s;t Mi&s;carriages: O! had
I with him &s;incerely repented of what was pa&s;s'd,
I had not for 24 Year together liv'd a Life of
levity, and profligate Wickedne&s;s after it.</P>
<P>BUT here I had, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> lei&s;ure to reflect, and
to repent, to call to mind things pa&s;s'd, and with
a ju&s;t Dete&s;tation, learn as <HI>Job</HI> &s;ays, <HI>to abhor my
&s;elf in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</HI></P>
<P>IT is with this Temper that I have written my
Story, I would have all that de&s;ign to read it,
prepare to do &s;o with the Temper of Penitents;
and remember with how much Advantage they
may make their penitent reflections at Home, under
the merciful Di&s;po&s;itions of Providence in Peace,
Plenty, and Ea&s;e, rather than Abroad under the
Di&s;cipline of a Tran&s;ported Criminal as my Wife
and my Tutor, or under the Mi&s;eries and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of a Shipwreck'd wanderer, as my Skipper or
Captain of the Sloop, who as I hear dyed a very
great Penitent, labouring in the De&s;erts and
Mountains to find his way home to <HI>Virginia,</HI> by
the way of <HI>Carolina,</HI> whether the re&s;t of the Crew
reached after infinite Dangers and Hard&s;hips;
or in Exile, however favourably circum&s;tanciated
as mine, in ab&s;ence from my Family, and for &s;ome
time in no probable View of ever &s;eeing them
any more.</P>
<P>SUCH <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> may repent with Advantage,
but how few are they that &s;eriou&s;ly look in, till
their way is hedg'd up, and they have no other
way to look?</P>
<P>HERE, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I had Lei&s;ure to Repent, how far
it plea&s;es God to give the Grace of Repentance
where he gives the Opportunity of it, is not for
me to &s;ay of my&s;elf, it is &s;ufficient that I re|commend
<PB N="399" REF="405">
it to all that read this Story, that when
they find their Lives come up in any degree to
any Similitude of Ca&s;es, they will enquire by me,
and ask them&s;elves, Is not this the time to Repent?
perhaps the An&s;wer may touch them.</P>
<P>I have only to add to what was then written,
that my kind Friend the <HI>Spaniards</HI> finding no o|ther
Method pre&s;ented for conveying me to my
home, that is to &s;ay, to <HI>Virginia,</HI> got a Licen&s;e,
for me to come in the next Galeons, as a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Merchant to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> where I arriv'd &s;afe with all
my Trea&s;ure, for he &s;uffer'd me to be at no Ex|pences
in his Hou&s;e; and from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> I &s;oon got
Pa&s;&s;age on Board an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant Ship for
<HI>London,</HI> from whence I &s;ent an Account of my
Adventures to my Wife, and where in about five
Months more, &s;he came over to me, leaving with
full &s;atisfaction the Management of all our Af|fairs
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> in the &s;ame faithful Hands as
before.</P>
