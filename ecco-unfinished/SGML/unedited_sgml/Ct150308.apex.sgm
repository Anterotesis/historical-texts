<HEAD>EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous and Civil Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is the Cu&s;tom of the World to make Apologies before Books, and I comply with that Cu&s;tom, not for Formality's Sake, but that it is rea&s;ona|ble and ju&s;t, and Self-defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>I know there will be many Objections again&s;t this Sermon, the which it is convenient to obviate. Some will &s;ay, What have the <HI>Quakers</HI> to do with the <HI>Union?</HI> I &s;ay, We have to do with the <HI>Union;</HI> for <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> are our avow'd Principles, and ever were: And we pay as much Re&s;pect to the <HI>QUEEN</HI> of the <HI>UNION,</HI> as any loyal People ought to do.</P>
<P>Another Objection will be, Why was it not publi&s;h'd &s;ooner? (Thus a Man's Mode&s;ty becomes his Crime!) Thou know'&s;t, Reader, that at that Time Abundance of Sermons were printed, which had been held forth in the Pulpit by Men of Learning and Parts, adorn'd with all the Beauties of Rhetorick, and Gayety of Elo|quence; the&s;e were univer&s;ally read and admir'd. Now, for a <HI>Quaker</HI> to print his plain hone&s;t Sermon at that Time, would have been like putting a Child into the crowding Throng, to have it trampled under
<PB REF="3">
Foot, and &s;mother'd in the Du&s;t. They are the <HI>Ce|dars,</HI> but we are the <HI>Shrubs.</HI></P>
<P>And now the great and learn'd Sermons are all read over, perhaps the Men of the World may be at Lei&s;ure to read a plain Sermon. I can tell thee, Reader, thou wilt find in it no fine Language, for it has never been in the Poli&s;her's Hands; but 'tis as full of Truth, as an Egg is full of Meat. Thou wilt find nothing again&s;t the Government in it, but Abundunce for it, and a|gain&s;t its Enemies; the <HI>Tackers</HI> and <HI>High-Flyers.</HI></P>
<P>And herein, I know, I have incurr'd the Hatred and Malice of that &s;ort of People, who&s;e good Word is a Man's Scandal, and who&s;e ill Word is his Honour and Glory. Nor is it any Wonder, that they abu&s;e her Maje&s;ty's good Friends, when they are &s;o impudent as to abu&s;e even her Maje&s;ty her &s;elf. Ungrateful Wretches, to abu&s;e &s;o good a Queen! And what's the Rea&s;on of it, I pray? Only becau&s;e her Maje&s;ty is for Peace and Union, and will not &s;uffer them to de&s;troy the harmle&s;s Flock, the Friends.</P>
<P>And I have printed this to be &s;old for two Pence, that it might not be burden&s;ome and chargeable to the Friends. And I do forewarn the Reader, and every Body el&s;e, That in Ca&s;e the Pirate-Printers do &s;ur|reptiou&s;ly print this Sermon upon me, that the genuine Copy is only &s;old by our Friend <HI>Benjamin Bragge,</HI> and by none el&s;e.</P>
<P>And now, Reader, I bid thee farewel heartily, hoping thou wilt take in good Part, what I have held forth and publi&s;h'd for the Good, In&s;truction, and Edification of the Friends; I &s;ay, accept it &s;avoura|bly from</P>

<HEAD>THE Quakers Sermon ON THE UNION.</HEAD>
<P>MY Friends, the Men of the World, the Sons of Iniquity, and the wicked High-Church-Prie&s;ts, do calumniate and abu&s;e the Friends, the Chil|dren of the Light, commonly known by the Name of QUAKERS, of which Number all we of the Godly here pre&s;ent, are.</P>
<P>Now, my Friends and Brethren, be it known unto you all and &s;ingular, unto the Women of the Light, as well as to the Men, nay, even to the friendly Babes, that I don't value what the High-Church-Prie&s;ts &s;ay of us. My Friends, I no more value what they &s;ay, than I do the Barking of a pernicious Cur-Dog as I pa&s;s along the Streets, or the Saying of that High-flying Bird of Per|dition, by the Men of the World call'd a <HI>Parrot,</HI> when he calls after me, and cries out, <HI>a Quaker, a Quaker, a Quer!</HI> No, my Friends, I don't value what the&s;e impious Ones do &s;ay of us; but the hone&s;t Men &s;peak Evil of us, and I am afraid too ju&s;tly.</P>
<P>What the Light within me has difcover'd to my out|ward Man, I al&s;o will di&s;cover unto you, my Friends, for I am &s;et aloft in this Place of Holding-forth, as a Beacon on the Top of a Hill, to give Light unto the Children of the Light, nay, and al&s;o to the Children of Darkne&s;s. The hone&s;t Men of the World &s;ay unto me, that we the Friends, commonly known by the Name of QUAKERS, have not Held-forth, or according to the Phra&s;e of the World, Preach'd or Sermoniz'd on the Subject of the UNION.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
Our good Queen ANN, with much Care and Pains, has brought this <HI>Union</HI> to pa&s;s, for the Good of every Body, Lay, even for the Good of the Friends; and, &s;ay the Men of the World, What mean the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that they take no Notice of a Thing &s;o very con&s;iderable? I &s;ay $nto you, my Friends and Brethren, it is a Fault, a great Fault; and therefore this Day I will &s;trike your Ears with a Stroke on this Subject.</P>
<P>The Church-men. (I mean the hone&s;t Church-men that are on the Side of Queen ANN, not the pernicious Non|$urers) the Pre&s;$y$erians, the Anabapri&s;ts, the Indepen|cents, and all the Churches, except the High-flying Church of <HI>England,</HI> have preach'd on this Subject. And now, lo! I &s;peak to that Point.</P>
<P>But, my Friends, I &s;hall not, as the Men of the World do, take a Text, and make a long Splutter upon a few Words: I &s;hall not, as they have done, &s;peak of the UNION, but of its contrary and direct Oppo&s;ite, DIS|CORD.</P>
<P>Then will the Men of the World &s;ay of me, and of you, that we are cro&s;s People, that all our Religion lies in Oppo&s;ition and Stubbornne&s;s; that we will not do as others $o, only becau&s;e we will not. But will &s;hew unto you and them, that to treat of DISCORD, on this Oc|ca&s;ion, is more proper, than to &s;peak of UNION.</P>
<P>The&s;e that &s;peak of <HI>Union,</HI> do, as the People &s;ay, put the Cart before the Hor&s;e; for <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> is before <HI>Union;</HI> and my Rea&s;on for &s;o &s;aying, is, becau&s;e <HI>Union</HI> is after <HI>P$&s;cord.</HI> There mu&s;t be Strife, Contention, and Di&s;cord, before there can be an <HI>Union.</HI> People can't be &s;aid to be reconcil'd, that never were at Variance. And therefore, without Vanity, I &s;ay it, my &s;peaking of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> is far more regular, than &s;peaking of <HI>Union,</HI> becau&s;e I begin at the right End; and &s;o, I hope, it will be &s;aid of me and $$, that we are more regular and orderly in our Di&s;cour&s;es, than others our Brethren the Di&s;&s;enters, nay, even than the Steeple-men them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To &s;peak of <HI>Union,</HI> is a lovely Subject: The Thing it &s;elf is lovely, and 'tis plea&s;ant to &s;peak of it, as it is to &s;peak of a good and vertuous Wife, or a true and &s;incere Friend. UNION is from high Heaven and Queen ANN, but DISCORD is from the deep, low, bottomle&s;s <HI>Aby&s;s,</HI> from <HI>dell</HI> and the <HI>High-Flyers:</HI> UNION is an <HI>Angel,</HI> but DISCORD is the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
I have read a Story, my Friends, of two Painters, that con$ $ded for Ma&s;ter&s;hip in Art: The one drew Grapes on a Wall, &s;o much to the Life, that the mi&s;taken Birds came and pe k'd at 'em, as if they had been natural Fruit: The other drew on the &s;ame Wall an ill-favour'd Fellow, like a <HI>High-Flyer,</HI> that frighted away the Birds. Now, which of the&s;e was the be&s;t Arti&s;t? Certainly the latter. And &s;o &s;hall I be, my Friends: 'Tis le&s;s Art to paint a beauteous <HI>Angel,</HI> than an ugly <HI>Devil.</HI> If I can &s;o paint, and hold forth in Words this mon&s;terous <HI>Devil,</HI> DIS|CORD, in its mo&s;t ugly deform'd Shapes, I &s;hall prove my &s;elf a better Painter, than tho&s;e that have &s;hewn UNION in all its Graces and exqui&s;ite Beauties; and to aff$ignten Men from <HI>Di&s;cord,</HI> is &s;ending them to <HI>Union:</HI> A good and pious Work, if artfully perform'd. As our &s;hewing the ugly Nature of Sin, is affrightening Men to Vertue, the Terrors of <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> cau&s;es Men to take a View of GOD and <HI>Heaven;</HI> to hate the one, and be in Love with the other. When the Di&s;gui&s;e, the Ma&s;k of Iniquity, is thrown off, then Men become in Love with the Beauties of Vertue and Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>There is no better Way of &s;hewing you the ugly Na|ture of SIN, than by repre&s;enting to Mankind the Mi&s;|chiefs it has done in this lower World. <HI>Sin</HI> is <HI>Di&s;cord:</HI> It is a Di&s;agreement with the eternal GOD, a Rebellion again&s;t the fundamental and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Laws of Heaven: It was <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> that ca&s;t our fir&s;t Parents, the unhappy Originals of Mankind, out of $word$ it was what turn'd the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> into a Wilderne&s;s, &s;oft and de|licate Plants into prickly Thorns, delicious Fruits into &s;ower Grapes. From this black Fountain of <HI>Di&s;cord,</HI> has flow'd all the human Sweat, Toil, and Labour, that ever &s;ince the Fall has been intail'd on the mi&s;erable Po&s;terity of our fir&s;t Parents: Their <HI>Di&s;union,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> with GOD, brought Mankind, and even the Bea&s;ts of the Field, under hard Pre&s;&s;ures and Bondage; and from them has the Spirit of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> been diffus'd ever &s;ince, throughout the whole Creation.</P>
<P>We look right, when we look into the Originals and Cau&s;es of Things. By what Cau&s;e, and for what Rea&s;ons did our fir&s;t Parents di&s;agree, and fall out with their Maker? Was it not by the Temptations of a <HI>black De|vil?</HI> And how is this fatal <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> continued, to embroil unhappy Mankind? Is it not by the Tem|ptations
<PB N="8" REF="7">
and Artifices of a <HI>black High-flying</HI> Prie&s;t|hood?</P>
<P>And what was the Occa&s;ion of the fir&s;t Di&s;cord be|twixt the Creature and the Creator? Was it not about Empire and Supremacy? The Creature would not be bound by the ecuitable Law of Heaven, but broke thro' the Boundaries &s;et him by his Maker, the Supream Law-Giver. How did <HI>Lucifer,</HI> the Son of the Morning, and the Ho&s;t of Angels, fall into utter Darkne&s;s? Was it not b$ attempting to dethrone the Almighty? Was not the Contention for Empire and Dominion, the Occa&s;ion of their Fall?</P>
<P>And is not the Spirit of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> now reigning in the di&s;obedient Children of High-Church, founded on the &s;ome Ba&s;is, a Struggle, and a wicked Struggle for Empire and Dominion?</P>
<P>As 'tis fabl'd of the Giants of old, how they invaded Heaven; &s;o it is really &s;een how the&s;e invade the Queen's $rer gative, and attempt a Sovereign Empire and Domi|nion over the Con&s;ciences of their Fellow-Subjects.</P>
<P>That they invade the Queen's Prerogative, is plainly &s;een, in denying her a Supremacy, as Head of the Church, tho' that Dignity is e&s;&s;ential to her high Office, as Queen of <HI>Gre$t Britain,</HI> as has been fully prov'd to them by our Friend <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Ob&s;ervator.</HI></P>
<P>What In&s;truments of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> were the&s;e High-flying $ack $word$ at the la&s;t Election for Members of Parlia|ment, when they went about the Country fowing the Seeds of Strife and Contention among the Queen's good Subjects, oppo&s;ing the Queen's Friends, and promoting the Intere&s;t of tho&s;e that were the Queen's Enemies, Lovers of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> and Di&s;union? In&s;omuch, that had not the friendly and peaceable <HI>Quakers</HI> be&s;tirr'd them&s;elves, with otner the Di&s;&s;enters, in Conjunction with the moderate, yet truly zealous Church-men, for the Queen's Intere&s;t, they might have accompli&s;h'd their De&s;ign of bringing the Royal Dignity low, and the Liberty of the Subject to ju&s;t nothing at all.</P>
<P>Take the&s;e High-flying Tacking Prie&s;ts in their &s;piritual Capacity, as they term it, and they appear mutinous, re|bellious, and harden'd in <HI>Di&s;cord:</HI> They fly in the Face or their &s;piritual Governours, the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> who have a legal $$$i&s;diction over them, as the Queen has over the whole
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Church of <HI>England,</HI> as it is e&s;tabli&s;h'd by the Laws of the Realm.</P>
<P>And this Spirit of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> in them, is the true Spirit of the Devil; for they oppo&s;e every Thing that is good. Tho' we are of a different Per&s;wa&s;ion from the Governours of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> yet we mu&s;t acknowledge them to be the be&s;t <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> that have been in our Days, or that we find recorded in former Ages. My Friends, we may &s;peak feelingly and &s;en&s;ibly in this Point; we han't yet forgot how much we &s;uffer'd in the black Reign of that black King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when we were made a Prey to the Sons of Iniquity, the Informers, who plunder'd our Hou&s;es, and &s;old the Conveniencies of our Well-being before our Faces, taking from us the nece&s;&s;ary Sub&s;i&s;tance of our earthly Tabernacles. We han't forgot, that then it was e&s;teem'd good Service for the Men cloath'd with Bea&s;ts Hides, with the carnal Weapons on their Shoulders, com|monly known by the Name of the City Train'd-Bands, to take the Friends by the No&s;e, and lead them from the Pla|ces of holding-forth, to the Goals and Dungeons, like &s;o many Sheep to the Slaughter: I &s;ay, we can't have yet forgotten tho&s;e Days of Tribulation and Bondage; and the Remembrance of tho&s;e dark and cloudy Days, &s;hould &s;erve to heighten the Thoughts of the Ble&s;&s;ings, the Sun|&s;hine and Ea&s;e we now enjoy under the be&s;t of Queens, and the be&s;t of Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>And this, my Friends, is the Occa&s;ion why the tac|king Prie&s;ts are become &s;o much malignant; this is the Rea&s;on of their Di&s;cord, and Envy with and again&s;t the Friends, that by the gentle Reign of our good Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> their Nails are par'd &s;o, that they cannot &s;cratch the Di&s;|&s;enters, as they us'd to do: They are angry with their G$|vernours, the Bi&s;hops, becau&s;e they are not of the &s;ame per&s;ecuting Spirit with them&s;elves. The&s;e are the <HI>Levia|thans</HI> of High-Church, that think they &s;it &s;afe no where, but on raging Billows; they are not tho&s;e Sons of <HI>Thun|der</HI> mention'd in the Scriptares, but the Sons of <HI>Boreas,</HI> de|lighting in Storms and Tempe&s;ts; true Prie&s;ts-Militants of the Church, that delight in Blood. Oh, my Soul, enter not into their Secrets! And let my righteous Spirit ari&s;e again&s;t them, whenever I make mention of their Name!</P>
<P>A &s;piritual Tyrant is much wor&s;e than a temporal or civil Tyrant, as much as the Soul is better than the Body. A civil Tyrant (but I think ben't very civil Folk nei|ther)
<PB N="10" REF="9">
can do Mi&s;chief only to my outward Man, my E|&s;tate and Goods, (all which are valuable in this Life) but not beyond it: But a &s;piritual Tyrant, &s;uch a one la s a Force upon Con&s;cience, and makes the Ordinances of Man, Terms of Salvation; his Malice reaches beyond the Grave, even to a future State; and &s;uch is the Empire the High-Church Tacking-Prie&s;ts aim at, &s;uch is their Pride, &s;uch their Malice, and their Spirit of Di&s;cord and Per&s;ecu|tion.</P>
<P>My Friends, the&s;e Tacking-Prie&s;ts, what are they? From whence came they? If they were of God, God's Work they would do. Methinks 'tis terrible to pronounce any, as coming from the Devil; but the&s;e are of their Fa|ther the Devil, and his Works they will do.</P>
<P>And now, my Friends, han't we a fine Crew among us? Such as our Fore-fathers never knew, and &s;uch as we are a&s;ham'd of; &s;uch as have the <HI>Devil</HI> for their Father, the <HI>Pope</HI> for their Nuncle, the <HI>French</HI> King for their Ally, and would have PERKIN to be their King. The&s;e are the Tackers, whom all good Men would be glad to &s;ee, not <HI>tack'd</HI> up in their own Sen&s;e, but <HI>tuck'd</HI> up in the Sen&s;e of him, whom the Men of the World call the <HI>Fi|ni&s;her of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>And here, my Friends, I cannot help ob&s;erving, that the High-Flyers and Tackers are the only People that fill the College o$ <HI>Newgate,</HI> and create &s;o much Trouble to the <HI>$word$</HI> Men at the <HI>Old Brily;</HI> ever now and then a $word$ puts in for a Share; but the Papi&s;ts and the Tackers are Cou&s;in-Germans, and will &s;hake Hands even at the Gal$ows; and that dry Tree at <HI>Hyde-P rk</HI> Corner &s;eems $word$ to bear no other Sort of Fruit. But when do they $word$ any of the Friends, or other the Di&s;&s;enters, making their <HI>Exit$</HI> at that Place?</P>
<P>And yet the&s;e Tacking-Prie&s;ts would have us believe, that they are the only Prie&s;ts, and that theirs is the only Church; when in&s;tead of being <HI>Pillars,</HI> they are the <HI>$word$</HI> of the Church, and de&s;troy every green Thing, do $word$ Good, but devour and ruinate.</P>
<P>They &s;ay, theirs is the only true Church. Now, what $word$ they mean by the Church? Why, nothing at all, but that Fabrick, call'd the <HI>Steeple-Hou&s;e;</HI> and becau&s;e the Friends and Di&s;&s;enters have not Steeples with Ding-Dongs in 'em affix'd to their Meeting-Hou&s;es, therefore t$ey are not e&s;teem'd as Churches. Poor ignorant Crea|tures!
<PB N="11" REF="10">
The Church is the A&s;&s;embly of the Faithful met together to wor&s;hip God, according to the Scriptures, by the Direction of the Spirit within us, and the Light it has &s;hewn us. The Church is a living, not a dead ina|nimate Sub&s;tance. It is the People, that compo&s;e the Church; 'tis not the Walls of the Steeple-Hou&s;e, that does it.</P>
<P>But the High-Church is the true Church, as they &s;ay: And the Tacking Non-juring Prie&s;ts, are the pro|per Prie&s;ts to admini&s;ter the Sacraments, as <HI>George Hickes,</HI> the Non-juring Levite, has affirm'd in a Book he has lately written again&s;t the Queen, and the Peace of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now, my Friends, I do a&s;&s;ert and affirm unto you, by the Light and the Truth which I have receiv'd, that the Sacraments are no proper Sacrifice, and that the&s;e Prie&s;ts are no proper Prie&s;ts to admini&s;ter them.</P>
<P>I am apt to think, that the&s;e Prie&s;ts are lineally de|&s;cended from tho&s;e under the <HI>Levitical</HI> Law, who were Butchers, as well as Prie&s;ts, and &s;lew the Sacrifice with their own Hands. That Manner of Offering is now ex|tinct by a new Di&s;pen&s;ation; the Prie&s;ts are no longer Butchers, tho' the Cruelty of the Butcher is convey'd downwards, runs in the Blood of the Tacking-<HI>Levites,</HI> is inherent in their Natures; and for this Rea&s;on, I take it, the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lature did exclu$e Prie&s;ts and Surgeons from being Jurors, in Ca&s;e of Life and Death, becau&s;e they were Men of <HI>Blood.</HI></P>
<P>Do you think, my Brethren and Friends, that the&s;e Prie&s;ts are proper Prie&s;ts to admini&s;ter the holy Sacra|ments, who are Spit-Fires in the Pulpit, and out of it &s;ow the Seed of Di&s;cord and Contention? That in wicked and &s;candalous Memorials abu&s;e the Queen, her Mini&s;try, and her good Subjects? That neglect their Preaching&punc; Work, and the Souls of tho&s;e committed to their Charge, and ride about the Country upon their Sorrel-Nags, to make Intere&s;t again&s;t the Queen's Friends at the Elections of Members to &s;erve in Parliament? For Shame, ye Tac|king-Prie&s;ts, don't pretend to any Sanctity above other Peo|ple, when your di&s;&s;olute Lives encourage Athei&s;m, and your Doctrines Slavery. You pretend to be proper Prie&s;ts, when you can't properly be call'd either <HI>Britains,</HI> or Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
My Friends, it is not long ago, as I walk'd the Streets, I &s;aw a <HI>Levite,</HI> whom the Creature had overcome, and in whom the Light was extingui&s;h'd, wallowing in the Ken|nel like a Swine. Now, my Friends, do any of you ima|gine this to be a proper Prie&s;t? Or, that ever God Almighty ordain'd the holy Sacraments to be admini&s;ter'd by his un|&s;anctify'd Fi&s;t? Certainly no: Creatures more pure than the&s;e, are appointed to &s;erve at the Altar.</P>
<P>Next, my Friends, how came the Sacraments to be a proper Sacrifice? Where there is Sacrifice, there is an Altar. But where is the Altar? I don't read of it in the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI> Every Man's own Heart may properly be call'd an Altar; but the proper Prie&s;t at this Altar, is the Man him&s;elf, who offers up to God Almighty the Sacri|fice of a broken and contrite Spirit. The Sacraments are no proper Sacrifice; for the Prie&s;t offers up nothing for the People By Faith, Love, and new Obedience, they are made Partakers of the Benefits of the Ordinance, and this they offer up for them&s;elves; the Prie&s;t is only a Ser|vant at the Altar, as &s;ome of the be&s;t Church-men have acknowledg'd.</P>
<P>But to tell you the Truth, my Friends, the&s;e Tacking-Prie&s;ts can be proper Prie&s;ts in no Re&s;pect what&s;oever. They are a Sort of Land <HI>Mer-men,</HI> half Fi&s;h and half Fle&s;h, and yet are <HI>neither Fi&s;o, Fle&s;h, nor good red Herring,</HI> but black Somethings, that di&s;turb both the Church and the State, the Queen and the People.</P>
<P>They cannot be Prie&s;ts after the <HI>Levitical</HI> Order, or the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oeconomy. They may indeed perform the Eutcher's Part, in killing the Sacrifice; but 'tis to be fear'd, they would rather &s;acrifice the Friends, and the other Di&s;&s;en|ters, than the Blood of Bulls and of Goats. And, to be &s;ure, we &s;hould then have no <HI>Peace-Offerings</HI> from $$em; for they are given to Strife, Envy, and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>And now, my Friends, I come to the Application of $hat I have held forth, for the common Good of you, and every Body el&s;e; and in this I &s;hall give you two U&s;es, 1&s;t. Of Reproof, and 2dly, Of Exhortation.</P>
<P>1&s;t. Of Reproof. You are to be reprov'd, my Friends, $ea, and I mu&s;t reprove you, according to the Light which $word$ have receiv'd. You are the Children of the Light; but you walk as if in Darkne&s;s, as if the Light &s;hone not. But I would have you throughly illuminated in the inward $nd the outward Man; in the inward Man, that the Light
<PB N="13" REF="12">
within you might lead you in the &s;afe Road to Salvation; in the outward Man, that the Eyes of your Rea&s;on might be open'd, that you might &s;ee the Wiles and Wickedne&s;s, the Craft and Cozenage, the Knavery and Villainy of the Tacking-Prie&s;ts, and their Party: So that you may pa&s;s your Pilgrimage through the Wilderne&s;s of this World, without being bitten or &s;tung by that Generation of Vipers, who are the Seed of the crooked Serpent.</P>
<P>My Friends, we are all to blame; I reprove my &s;e'f as well as you; we have taken &s;o much Care to look after the Light within us, that we have overlook'd tho&s;e dark and black evil Spirits, that &s;urround us without, who &s;tand ready with their Bellows of Contention, to puff and blow out the Light. And of this we have excus'd our &s;elves, by &s;aying, that it was none of our Bu&s;ine&s;s, that belong'd to the Men of the World; our Bu&s;ine&s;s was to keep the Light within us in a &s;hining Condition.</P>
<P>Now, my Friends, that this U&s;e of Reproof may al&s;o tend to Edification and In&s;truction, I will fairly argue the Point with you, and lay down this Po&s;ition: <HI>That the Friends, or the People commonly call'd</HI> Quakers, <HI>ought to be as much concern'd about the Civil Government of the King|dom, as any other Sort of People that live in it.</HI></P>
<P>But here, my Friends, I mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h and &s;et Things in a clear Light: I don't mean, that the Friends &s;hould concern them&s;elves <HI>in</HI> the Government, but <HI>about</HI> the Go|vernment; <HI>i. e.</HI> they &s;hould not attempt to get Offices and Places in the Government, but they &s;hould concern them|&s;elves <HI>about</HI> the Government, <HI>i. e.</HI> concerning the Support and E&s;tabli&s;hment of it. But all this while, I mean a righte|ous Government, &s;uch as is the Government of Queen ANN.</P>
<P>We ought to live in this World, as not enjoying it; not &s;etting our Hearts upon it, as if it were of eternal Dura|tion; we ought not to value the good Things and Comforts of this Life, as if in them there was any real Satisfaction that an, in the lea&s;t Mea&s;ure, &s;atisfy the De&s;ires of an immortal Saul. But we ought to behave our &s;elves as Tra|vellers to another and better Country; and if this World bean Inn, wherein we are to lodge as but for a Night, during that Stay we ought to keep our Doors clo&s;e lock'd and barr'd again&s;t Robbers, Thieves, and Cut-throats.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we are nere, we make a Part of the Men of the World; $word$ have the &s;ame Freedom by Birth-right, as any other <HI>Britains;</HI> our Property is the &s;ame as theirs;
<PB N="14" REF="13">
and if we will not be equally diligent and vigilaut with them in Defence of our Property, plainly, my Friends, we throw up and relinqui&s;h our Right, and do not de&s;erve to be e&s;item'd as <HI>Britains,</HI> but as willing Slaves.</P>
<P>Many of you, my Friends, are Free-holders in this Kingdom, either by Patrimony of Purcha&s;e; now, your Free-hold, in its &s;elf, is not &s;o valuable, as the Right and Property annex'd and in&s;eparable from that Free-hold. What &s;ignifies an E&s;tate, if it is in the Power of any one to deny me a peaceable and quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? The Free-holders in <HI>France,</HI> (one can't properly call $em &s;o) what do their Lands of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ignify, when 'tis in the Power of their Tyrant to take half the Income, or more, if he plea&s;es, to him&s;elf? Some tell me, that a Per&s;on inheriting 100 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> has &s;eldom more than 25 <HI>l.</HI> of that 100 <HI>l.</HI> to him&s;elf, in that Country.</P>
<P>My Friends, would you be willing to live under &s;uch a Go|vernment as this? Would you have E&s;tates without a Ti|tle, but &s;uch as your Tyrant plea&s;es? I am per&s;waded you would not: And to this deplorable Condition you mu&s;t be brought, if you don't &s;tand up in Defence of this Govern|ment. If you lo&s;e this good Queen, as the Tackers and <HI>Perkinites</HI> would have us do, a <HI>French</HI> Government, wooden Shoes, and arbitrary Power, mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence of it; which, I am &s;atisfy'd, will not &s;uit very well with any of your Stomachs: I am &s;ure mine ri&s;es to think of it.</P>
<P>Now, the only Way for you to &s;ecure your &s;elves in the legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Rights, is, to &s;tand by your Queen, who admini&s;ters Ju&s;tice with a &s;teady Hand. The Rights of the People, and the Prerogatives of the Crown, are to be alike &s;upported, and by the &s;ame Methods: The Inte|re&s;t of this Queen, and the Liberty of the Subject, are in|&s;eparable; one cannot be damag'd, but the other mu&s;t &s;uffer with it.</P>
<P>It has not been &s;o in &s;ome former Reigns: In the luxu|rious Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d, when Vice was tri|umphant, and all Manner of Wickedne&s;s was in Fa&s;hion; when poor Vertue was in Di&s;grace, and bani&s;h'd the Court; when Godline&s;s was reputed a Crime, and was forc'd to retreat to the ob&s;cure Parts of the Land; then, I &s;ay, the Intere&s;t of the Prince and the People were not the &s;ame; for then a <HI>French</HI> Government and Popery was creeping in upon us to our Ruin, which was effected in the Reign of King <HI>Ja$es</HI> the 2d; and we had all been ruin'd, we mu&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="14">
have been Slaves and Papi&s;ts, or murder'd or ma&s;&s;acre'd, had we not been deliver'd by King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>My Friends, don't you remember how evilly intreated the Friends were, at that Time, by tho&s;e that call'd them|&s;elves High-Church-men, who are Tackers now? How they &s;old our Goods for a Song, turn'd us out of Hou&s;e and Home, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as if they had been licens'd Free|booters and Robbers of the Church? Thus they did the Pope's and the Devil's Work; and had the Revolution been retarded but for a few Months longer, you would have found 'em all Popelings: The Tacking-Prie&s;ts would all of 'em have been reconcil'd to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> according to the Example of their Brother <HI>Slater,</HI> the Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t of <HI>Putnoy,</HI> and <HI>Obadiah Walker,</HI> of the famous Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to &s;ecure the Queen's Government and our own Liberties, again&s;t the evil Devices and wicked Practices of the&s;e Men, you that have Votes at Elections of Members to &s;erve in Parliament, be &s;ure to vote for the Queen's Friends; her Friends are our Friends; and our Friends mu&s;t be her Friends; if we are not, both &s;he and we &s;hall have too ma|ny Enemies. Our Enemies, the Tackers, are united among them&s;elves to ruin and de&s;troy the Government; and we ought to be firmly united in the Pre&s;ervation of it.</P>
<P>The Tackers can no Ways effect their De&s;igns, but by get|ting a Parliament of their own Kidney; and this was what they aim'd at, in their famous Bill, to prevent Occa&s;ional Conformity: For by that Bill, none of the Friends, or other Di&s;&s;enters, could have a Vote at Elections, &s;o that none but the Church-men were to chu&s;e; and, by that Means, they thought to make them&s;elves perpetual Dictators in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and what would they not have done, had not our noble Patriots, the Peers, &s;tood up in Defence of Liberty and Property, and fru&s;trated their wicked De&s;igns? And then came on the Project of the TACK; the Queen mu&s;t have no Money, if &s;he wou'd not pa&s;s the Occa&s;ional Bill; &s;he mu&s;t pa&s;s all, or none. Oh! Wretches! barbarous to &s;o good a Queen!</P>
<P>Now; my Friends, this was perfectly en&s;laving all the Di&s;&s;enters in the Kingdom, by taking away the Privileges we are born to: My Right of Voting, is annex'd to my Free-hold, and they may as well take away my Free-hold, as my Right of Voting: And why &s;hould Religion be thrown as a Stumbling-Block in the Way of our civil Li|berties?
<PB N="16" REF="15">
I do not vote as a <HI>Quaker,</HI> but as a <HI>Britain;</HI> and yet, my Friends, Religion is greatly concern'd herein, for could they have carry'd the Occa&s;ional Bill, or have mana|ged the TACK, as they hop'd for, and expected, then the <HI>Tolleration-Act</HI> would &s;oon have been repeal'd, and a more terrible Per&s;ecution would have follow'd, than either we, or our Fore-fathers ever knew or felt. And this brings me to the la&s;t U&s;e of this Text which I propos'd, in which I &s;hall be &s;hort; and which is,</P>
<P>Secondly, A U&s;e of Exhortation. And certainly I believe every Friend here pre&s;ent knows within him&s;elf, that I mean to exhort you to PEACE and UNION among your &s;elves, and to &s;tand firm and fix'd to the Queen and her Intere&s;t; for in doing &s;o, you not only do the Thing that is ju&s;t and right, but you do Good to your &s;elves, and your Po&s;terity after you.</P>
<P>My Friends, we are the Children of the Light, and yet too too many of us have been in the Dark in Relation to Ci|vil Affairs. The Eyes of our Under&s;tandings were never o|pen'd that Way, 'till the la&s;t Election; and what open'd them then? Why, Occa&s;ional Bills, Tacks, and a di&s;mal Pro&s;pect of Per&s;ecution; the Lo&s;s of our Queen and Govern|ment were in View, as was a <HI>French</HI> Government and a Po|pi&s;h Pretender. As they rous'd their wicked Natures again&s;t the Queen, her Government, and Mini&s;try; &s;o we rous'd our righteous Spirits on their Behalf, and united in their common Defence.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t Time, that ever the Friends made fo good an Appearance at the Elections; they were united through|out the Kingdom for the Queen and her Friends; very few went contrary, only &s;uch as were not thoroughly enlighten'd, as a few about <HI>Agmonde&s;ham,</HI> a Remnant, but &s;mall, in whom the Light only glia$mer'd, and &s;hone not.</P>
<P>My Friends, to conclude, I humely de&s;ire, reque&s;t, and intreat you, as you have receiv'd the Light, to walk worthy of it; not as in Darkne&s;s with the wicked Band of Tackers, but that you again will be indu&s;trious at the Elections in chu&s;ing the Queen's Friends, and Men of <HI>Moderation</HI> and <HI>Union;</HI> by this Means, you will rivet the Intere&s;t of the be&s;t of Queens, compleat your own Happine&s;s, and fru&s;trate the De&s;igns of the Enemies of Queen and People. By this Means, you will &s;ecure to your Po&s;terity the &s;ame Happine&s;s your &s;elves now enjoy, and in a few Years not &s;o much as the Name of a TACKER &s;hall be heard of in the&s;e Lands.</P>
