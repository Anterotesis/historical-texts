<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>LANGBANE, JACOB, and the re&s;t of the Stage Hi&s;torians, who have hitherto appeared in Print, abounding with Errors as well omi&s;&s;ive as commi&s;&s;ive; we flattered our&s;elves that a more regular and exact Account of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Drama|tic Writers, could &s;carce fail of a Favourable reception from the Publick.</P>
<P>Prompted by this we have made the following At|tempt; but with what Succe&s;s, we &s;ubmit to the Judgment of others. Thus much however we can alledge, that no Pains on our Part have been wanting, no Means of In|formation in our Power untried; having, before we &s;et forward in the Work, laid in a con&s;iderable Fund of Theatrical Hi&s;tory. For a great Part of this, indeed, we mu&s;t acknowledge our&s;elves indebted to Mr. <HI>Chet|wood</HI>, who&s;e exten&s;ive Knowledge in the&s;e Matters is not to be que&s;tioned; having been for many Years employed as Prompter and Manager to the Theatres both of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Dublin</HI>; and who, from a State of Affluence, is now reduced to almo&s;t a State of Indigence, and has nothing in view but the melancholy Pro&s;pect of ending the Re&s;idue of Life within the Walls of a Pri&s;on, where Ill-Fortune has already thrown him.</P>
<P>The Reader is de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, that in the Arrange|ment of the &s;everal Plays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a Chronological order has been ob&s;erved, wherein Regard is always had to the earlie&s;t Dates&punc; As for the Writers to who&s;e Works no Dates have been prefixed, as Nece&s;&s;ity oblig'd us to have Recour&s;e to Conjecture, 'tis hoped the Reader will re&s;t &s;atisfied, as it was impo&s;&s;ible, perhaps, to furni&s;h a more &s;atisfactory Account.</P>

<P>Having &s;aid thus much, we now proceed to an Ac|count of the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, for which the Reader is obliged to the Labours of an In|genious Writer now living.</P>
<P>It is generally imagined, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage ro&s;e later than the re&s;t of its Neighbours. Tho&s;e in this Opi|nion will, perhaps, wonder to be told of Theatrical En|tertainments almo&s;t as early as the Conque&s;t; and yet nothing is more certain, if you will believe an hone&s;t Monk, one <HI>William Stephanides</HI> or <HI>Fitz-Stephen</HI>, in his <HI>De&s;criptio Nobili&s;&s;imae Civitatis Londoniae</HI>, who writes thus;
<Q>&startq;<HI>London</HI>, in&s;tead of common Interludes belong|ing to the Theatre, has Plays of a more holy Sub|ject; Repre&s;entations of tho&s;e Miracles which the holy Confe&s;&s;ors wrought, or of the Sufferings wherein &endq;the glorious Con&s;tancy of the Martyrs did appear.</Q>
This Author was a Monk of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, who wrote in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. and died in that of <HI>Richard</HI> I. 1191: And as he does not mention the&s;e Repre&s;entati|ons as Novelties to the People, (for he is de&s;cribing all the common Diver&s;ions in u&s;e at that time) we can hardly fix them lower than the Conque&s;t. And this, we believe, is an earlier Date than any other Nation of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> can produce for their Theatrical Repre&s;entations. About 140 Years after this, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. it was ordained by Act of Parliament, that a Company of Men called <HI>Vagrants</HI>, who had made Ma&s;querades thro' the whole City, &s;hould be whipt out of <HI>London</HI>, becau&s;e they repre&s;ented &s;candalous Things in the little Alehou&s;es, and other Places where the Populace a&s;&s;em|bled. What the Nature of the&s;e &s;candalous Things were, we are not told; whether lewd and ob&s;cene, or im|pious and profane; but we &s;hould rather think the for|mer, for the Word <HI>Ma&s;querades</HI> has an ill Sound, and, we believe, they were no better in their Infancy than at
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
pre&s;ent. 'Tis true, the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> were &s;oon af|ter this Period made very free with all over <HI>Europe</HI>, being repre&s;ented in &s;o &s;tupid and ridiculous a manner, that the Stories of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> in particular, were thought to encourage <HI>Libertini&s;m</HI> and Infidelity. In all Probability therefore the Actors la&s;t mentioned were of that Species called <HI>Mummers</HI>; the&s;e were wont to &s;troll about the Country dre&s;s'd in an antick Manner, danc|ing, mimicking, and &s;hewing Po&s;tures. This Cu&s;tom is &s;till continued in many Parts of <HI>England</HI>; but it was formerly &s;o general, and drew the common People &s;o much from their Bu&s;ine&s;s, that it was deemed a very pernicious Cu&s;tom: And as the&s;e <HI>Mummers</HI> always went ma&s;ked and di&s;gui&s;ed, they but too frequently encouraged them&s;elves to commit violent Outrages, and were guilty of many lewd Di&s;orders. However, as bad as they were, they &s;eem to be the true original Comedi|ans of <HI>England</HI>; and their Excellence altogether con&s;i&s;ted, as that of their Succe&s;&s;ors does in part &s;till, in Mimick|ry and Humour.</P>
<P>In an Act of Parliament made the 4th Year of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. mention is made of certain <HI>Wa&s;tors, Ma&s;ter-Ri|mours, Min&s;trels</HI>, and other Vagabonds, who infe&s;ted the Land of <HI>Wales; And it is enacted, that no</HI> Ma&s;ter-Rimour, Min&s;trel, <HI>or other Vagabond, be in any wi&s;e &s;u&s;tained in the Land of</HI> Wales, <HI>to make Commoiths or Gatherings upon the People there</HI>. What the&s;e <HI>Ma&s;ter-Ri|mours</HI> were, which were &s;o trouble&s;ome in <HI>Wales</HI> in parti|cular, we cannot tell; po&s;&s;ibly they might be the degene|rate De&s;cendants of the antient Bards. It is al&s;o difficult to determine what is meant by their making <HI>Commoiths</HI>. The Word &s;ignifies, in <HI>Welch</HI>, any Di&s;trict, or Part of a Hundred or Cantred, containing about one Half of it; that is, 50 Villages; and might po&s;&s;ibly be made U&s;e of by the&s;e <HI>Ma&s;ter-Rimours</HI> when they had fixed upon a Place to act in, and gave Intimation thereof for ten or twelve Miles round, which is a Circuit that will take in about 50 Villages. And that this was commonly done, appears from <HI>Carew</HI>'s Survey of <HI>Cornwall</HI>, which was wrote in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
time. Speaking of the Diver&s;ions of the People,
<Q>&startq;The <HI>Guary Miracle</HI>, (&s;ays he) in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> a Miracle Play, is a kind of Interlude compiled in <HI>Corni&s;h</HI>, out of &s;ome Scripture Hi&s;tory. For repre&s;enting it they rai&s;e an Amphitheatre in &s;ome open Field, having the Diameter of its inclo&s;ed Plain, &s;ome forty or fifty Foot. The Country People flock from all Sides many Miles off, to &s;ee and hear it; for they have therein Devils and Devices to delight as well the &endq;Eye as the Ear.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Carew</HI> has not been &s;o exact, as to give us the Time when the&s;e <HI>Guary Miracles</HI> were exhibited in <HI>Cornwall</HI>; but, by the manner of it, the Cu&s;tom &s;eems to be very antient.</P>
<P>The Year 1378 is the earlie&s;t Date we can find, in which expre&s;s mention is made of the Repre&s;entation of My&s;teries in <HI>England</HI>. In this Year the Scholars of <HI>Paul</HI>'s School pre&s;ented a Petition to <HI>Richard</HI> II. pray|ing his Maje&s;ty
<Q>&startq;to prohibit &s;ome unexpert People from pre&s;enting the Hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament, to the great Prejudice of the &s;aid Clergy, who have been at great Expence in order to repre&s;ent it publickly at &endq;<HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI>.</Q>
About twelve Years afterwards, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1390, the Pari&s;h-Clerks of <HI>London</HI> are &s;aid to have played Interludes at <HI>Skinners Well, July</HI> 18, 19, and 20th. And again, in 1409, the tenth Year of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. they acted at <HI>Clerkenwell</HI> (which took its Name from this Cu&s;tom of the Pari&s;h Clerks acting Plays there) for eight Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, a Play concerning the Crea|tion of the World, at which were pre&s;ent mo&s;t of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom. The&s;e In&s;tan|ces are &s;ufficient to prove that we had the My&s;teries here very early. How long they continued to be exhibited among&s;t us, cannot be exactly determined. This Pe|riod one might call the dead Sleep of the Mu&s;es. And when this was over, they did not pre&s;ently awake, but, in a kind of Morning Dream, produced the <HI>Mora|lities</HI> that followed. However, the&s;e jumbled Ideas had &s;ome Shadow of Meaning. The My&s;teries only
<PB N="v" REF="7">
repre&s;ented, in a &s;en&s;ele&s;s manner, &s;ome miraculous Hi&s;tory from the Old or New Te&s;tament: But in the&s;e <HI>Moralities</HI> &s;omething of De&s;ign appeared, a Fable and a Moral; &s;omething al&s;o of Poetry, the Virtues, Vices, and other Affections of the Mind being frequently per|&s;onified. But the Moralities were al&s;o very often con|cerned wholly in religious Matters. For Religion then was every one's Concern; and it was no Wonder if each Party employed all Arts to promote it. Had they been in U&s;e now, they would doubtle&s;s have turned as much upon Politicks. Thus, the <HI>New Cu&s;tom</HI>, was certainly intended to promote the Reformation, when it was revived in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>. And in the more early Days of the Reformation, it was &s;o common for the Partizans of the old Doctrines, (and per|haps al&s;o of the new) to defend and illu&s;trate their Te|nets this Way, that in the 24th Year of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in an Act of Parliament made for the promoting true Re|ligion, we find a Clau&s;e re&s;training all Rimors or Players from &s;inging in Songs, for playing in Interludes, any thing that &s;hould contradict the e&s;tabli&s;hed Doctrines. It was al&s;o cu&s;tomary at this time to act the&s;e moral and religious Dramas in private Hou&s;es, for the Edification and Improvement, as well as the Diver&s;ion, of well-di&s;po&s;ed Families: And for this Purpo&s;e the Appear|ance of the Per&s;ons of the Drama were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as that five or &s;ix Actors might repre&s;ent twenty Per&s;on|ages.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid of the My&s;teries and Moralities, it is hoped will be &s;ufficient ju&s;t to &s;hew the Reader what the Nature of them was. We &s;hould have been glad to be more particular; but where Materials are not to be had, the Building mu&s;t be deficient. And, to &s;ay the Truth, a more particular Knowledge of the&s;e Things, any farther than as it &s;erves to &s;hew the Turn and Ge|nius of our Ance&s;tors, and the progre&s;&s;ive Refinement of our Language, was &s;o little worth pre&s;erving, that the Lo&s;s of it is &s;carce to be regretted. We proceed there|fore with our Subject. The Mu&s;e might now be &s;aid
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
to be ju&s;t awake when &s;he began to trifle in the old In|terludes, and aimed at &s;omething like Wit and Humour. And for the&s;e <HI>John Heywood</HI> the Epigrammati&s;t undoubt|edly claims the earlie&s;t, if not the foremo&s;t Place. He was Je&s;ter to King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. but lived till the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign. <HI>Gammer Gur|ton</HI>'s <HI>Needle</HI>, which is generally called our fir&s;t Come|dy, and not unde&s;ervedly, appeared &s;oon after the In|terludes: It is indeed altogether of a Comic Ca&s;t, and wants not Humour, tho' of a low and &s;ordid kind. And now Dramatic Writers, properly &s;o called, began to appear, and turn their Talents to the &s;tage. <HI>Henry Parker</HI>, Son of Sir <HI>William Parker</HI>, is &s;aid to have wrote &s;everal Tragedies and Comedies in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and one <HI>John Hoker</HI>, in 1535, wrote a Comedy called <HI>Pi&s;cator</HI>, or the <HI>Fi&s;her caught</HI>. Mr. <HI>Richard Ed|wards</HI>, who was born in 1523, and in the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign was made one of the Gentle|men of her Maje&s;ty's Chapel, and Ma&s;ter of the Children there, being both an excellent Mu&s;ician, and a good Poet, wrote two Comedies, one called <HI>Palaemon</HI> and <HI>Arcite</HI>, in which a Cry of Hounds, in hunting was &s;o well imi|tated, that the Queen and the Audience were extremely delighted: The other called <HI>Damon</HI> and <HI>Pithias, the two faithfulle&s;t Friends in the World</HI>. After him came <HI>Thomas Sackville</HI>, Lord <HI>Buckhur&s;t</HI>, and <HI>Tho|mas Norton</HI>, the Writers of <HI>Gorboduc</HI>, the fir&s;t Dra|matic Piece of any Con&s;ideration in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language. Of the&s;e and &s;ome others, hear the Judg|ment of <HI>Puttenham</HI>, in his <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>, wrote in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>;
<Q>&startq;I think, &s;ays he, that for Tragedy the Lord of <HI>Buckhur&s;t</HI>, and Mai&s;ter <HI>Ed|ward Ferrys</HI>, for &s;uch doings as I have &s;een of theirs, do de&s;erve the highe&s;t Price: The Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI>, and Mai&s;ter <HI>Edwards</HI> of her Maje&s;ty's Chapel, for &endq;Comedy and Interlude.</Q>
And in another Place he &s;ays,&mdash;
<Q>&startq;But the principal Man in this Profe&s;&s;ion (of Poetry) at the &s;ame time, (<HI>viz. Edward</HI> VI.) was Mai&s;ter <HI>Edward Ferrys</HI>, a Man of no le&s;s Mirth and
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
Felicity than <HI>John Heywood</HI>, but of much more Skill and Magnificence in his Metre, and therefore wrote for the mo&s;t part to the Stage in Tragedy, and &s;ome|times in Comedy or Interlude; wherein he gave the King &s;o much good Recreation, as he had thereby &endq;many good Rewards.</Q>
Of this <HI>Edward Ferrys</HI>, &s;o con&s;iderable a Writer, I can find no Remains, nor even the Titles of any Thing he wrote. After the&s;e follow|ed <HI>John Lillie</HI>, famous in his Time for Wit, and hav|ing greatly improved the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Language, in a Ro|mance which he wrote, entitled <HI>Euphues and his En|gland</HI>, or the <HI>Anatomy of Wit</HI>; of which it is &s;aid by the Publi&s;her of his Plays,
<Q>&startq;Our Nation are in his Debt for a new <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> which he taught them, <HI>Euphues and his England</HI> began fir&s;t that Language. All our Ladies were then his Scholars, and that Beauty in Court who could not <HI>parle Euphui&s;m</HI>, was as little &endq;regarded, as &s;he which now there &s;peaks not <HI>French</HI>.</Q>
This extraordinary Romance, &s;o famous for its Wit, &s;o fa&s;hionable in the Court of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, and which is &s;aid to have introduced &s;o remarkable a Change in our Language, we have &s;een and read. It is an unnatu|ral affected Jargon; in which the perpetual U&s;e of Me|taphors, Allu&s;ions, Allegories, and Analogies, is to pa&s;s for Wit; and &s;tiff Bomba&s;t for Language. And with this Non&s;en&s;e the Court of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (who&s;e times afforded better Models for Stile and Compo&s;ition, than almo&s;t any &s;ince) became mi&s;erably infected, and greatly helped to let in all the vile Pedantry of Lan|guage in the following Reign. So much Mi&s;chief the mo&s;t ridiculous In&s;trument may do, when he propo&s;es to improve upon the Simplicity of Nature.</P>
<P>Though Tragedy and Comedy began now to lift up their Heads, yet they could do no more for &s;ome time than blu&s;ter and quibble; and how imperfect they were in all Dramatic Art, appears from an excellent Critici&s;m of Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI>, on the Writers of that Time. Yet they &s;eem to have had a Di&s;po&s;ition to do better had they known how, as appears by the &s;everal Efforts they u&s;ed to lick the Lump into a Shape: For
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
&s;ome of their Pieces they adorned with dumb Shews, &s;ome with Choru&s;es, and &s;ome they introduced and ex|plained by an Interlocutor. Yet imperfect as they were, we had made a far better Progre&s;s at this Time than our Neighbours, the <HI>French:</HI> The <HI>Italians</HI> indeed, by early Tran&s;lations of the old Dramatic Writers, had arrived to greater Perfection, but we were at lea&s;t up|on a Footing with the other Nations of <HI>Europe</HI>.</P>
<P>But now, as it were, all at once (as it happened in <HI>France</HI>, though in a much later Period) the true Drama received Birth and Perfection from the creative Genius of <HI>Shake&s;pear, Fletcher</HI> and <HI>John&s;on</HI>, who&s;e &s;everal Cha|racters are &s;o well known, that it would be &s;uperfluous to &s;ay any more of them.</P>
<P>Having thus traced the Dramatic Mu&s;e thro' all her Characters and Transformations, till &s;he had acquired a rea&s;onable Figure, let us now return and take a more particular View of the Stage and the Actors. The fir&s;t Company of Players we have any Account of in Hi&s;to|ry, are the Children of <HI>Paul</HI>'s in 1578, mentioned be|fore in Page iv. About twelve Years afterwards the Pari&s;h Clerks of <HI>London</HI> are &s;aid to have acted the My|&s;teries at <HI>Skinner's</HI> Well. Which of the&s;e two Compa|nies may have been the earlie&s;t, is not certain; but as the Children of <HI>Paul</HI>'s are fir&s;t mentioned, we mu&s;t in Ju&s;tice give the Priority to them. It is certain, the My&s;teries and Moralities were acted by the&s;e two So|cieties many Years before any other regular Companies appeared. And the Children of <HI>Paul</HI>'s continued to act long after Tragedies and Comedies came in vogue, even till the Year 1618, when a Comedy called <HI>Jack Drum's Entertainment</HI> was acted by them. Tis believ'd the next Company regularly e&s;tabli&s;hed was, the Chil|dren of <HI>The Royal Chapel</HI>, in the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Reign, the Direction of which was given to Mr. <HI>Richard Edwards</HI> before mentioned: And &s;ome few Years afterwards, as the Subjects of the Stage be|came more gay and ludicrous, a Company was form|ed under the Denomination of <HI>The Children of the Re|$els</HI>. The Children of the Chapel and of the <HI>Revels</HI> became very famous, and all <HI>Lillie</HI>'s Plays and many of
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s, and others, were fir&s;t acted by them. Nay, &s;o great was their Vogue and E&s;timation, that the common Players, as may be gathered from a Scene in <HI>Hamlet</HI>, grew jealous of them. However, they &s;erved as an excellent Nur&s;ery for the Theatres, many who afterwards became approved Actors, being educated among them.</P>
<P>It is &s;urprizing to con&s;ider what a number of Play|hou&s;es were &s;upported in <HI>London</HI> about this Time. From the Year 1570 to the Year 1629, when the Playhou&s;e in <HI>White Friars</HI> was fini&s;hed, no le&s;s than 17 Playhou&s;es had been built. The Names of mo&s;t of them may be collected from the Title Pages of old Plays. And as the Theatres were &s;o numerous, the Companies of Players were in Proportion. Be&s;ides the Children of the Chapel, and of the Revels, we are told that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, at the Reque&s;t of Sir <HI>Francis Wal&s;ingham</HI>, e&s;tabli&s;hed in hand|&s;ome Salaries twelve of the principal Players of that Time, who went under the Name of her Maje&s;ty's Co|medians and Servants. But exclu&s;ive of the&s;e, many Noblemen retained Companies of Players, who acted not only privately in their Lord's Hou&s;es, but pub|lickly under their Licen&s;e and Protection. Agreeable to this is the Account which <HI>Stow</HI> gives us &mdash;
<Q>&startq;Players in former Times, &s;ays he, were Retainers to Noble|men, and none had the Privilege to act Plays but &s;uch. So in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, many of the Nobility had Servants and Retainers who were Players, and went about getting their Livelihood that way. The Lord Admiral had Players, &s;o had Lord <HI>Strange</HI>, that played in the City of <HI>London</HI>. And it was u&s;ual on any Gentleman's Complaint of them for indecent Reflections in their Plays, to have them put down. Thus once the Lord Trea&s;urer &s;ignified to the Lord Mayor to have the&s;e Players of Lord Admiral and Lord <HI>Strange</HI> prohibited, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time, becau&s;e one Mr. <HI>Tilney</HI> had for &s;ome Rea&s;on di&s;liked them. Whereupon the Mayor &s;ent for both Com|panies, and gave them &s;trict Charge to forbear play|ing till farther Orders. The Lord Admiral's Play|ers obeyed; but the Lord <HI>Strange</HI>'s in a contemptu|ous
<PB N="x" REF="12">
Manner went to the <HI>Cro&s;s Keys</HI>, and play'd that Afternoon. Upon which the Mayor committed two of them to the <HI>Compter</HI>, and prohibited all playing for the future, till the Trea&s;urer's Plea&s;ure was far|&endq;ther known. This was in 1589.</Q>
And in another Part of his Survey of <HI>London</HI>, &s;peaking of the Stage, he &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;This which was once a Recreation, and u&s;ed there|fore now and then occa&s;ionally, afterwards by Abu&s;e became a Trade and Calling, and &s;o remains to this Day. In tho&s;e former Days, ingenious Trade&s;men, and Gentlemen's Servants, would &s;ometimes gather a Company of them&s;elves, and learn Interludes, to expo&s;e Vice, or to repre&s;ent the noble Actions of our Ance&s;tors. The&s;e they played at Fe&s;tivals, in pri|vate Hou&s;es, at Weddings or other Entertainments, but in Proce&s;s of time it became an Occupation; and the&s;e Plays being commonly acted on Sundays and Fe&s;tivals, the Churches were for&s;aken, and the Play|hou&s;es thronged. Great Inns were u&s;ed for this Purpo&s;e, which had &s;ecret Chambers and Places, as well as open Stages and Galleries. Here Maids and good Citizens Children were inveigled and allur'd to private and unmeet Contracts? here were publick|ly utter'd popular and &s;editious Matters, uncha&s;te, uncomely, and un&s;hamefac'd Speeches, and many other Enormities. The Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Things occa&s;ioned in 1574, Sir <HI>James Hawes</HI> being Mayor, an Act of Common Council, wherein it was ordain|ed, that no Play &s;hould be openly acted within the Liberty of the City, wherein &s;hould be uttered any Words, Examples, or Doings of any Uncha&s;tity, Se|dition, or &s;uch like unfit and uncomely Matter, under the Penalty of five Pounds, and fourteen Days Im|pri&s;onment. That no Play &s;hould be acted till fir&s;t peru&s;ed and allowed by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen; with many other Re&s;trictions. Yet it was provided that this Act &s;hould not extend to Plays &s;howed in private Hou&s;es, the Lodgings of a Nobleman, Citizen, or Gentleman, for the Cele|bration of any Marriage, or other Fe&s;tivity, and
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
where no Collection of Money was made from the Auditors. But the&s;e Orders were not &s;o well ob&s;erv|ed as they &s;hould be; the lewd Matters of Plays en|crea&s;ed, and they were thought dangerous to Religion, the State, Hone&s;ty of Manners, and al&s;o for Infection in the time of Sickne&s;s. Wherefore they were af|terwards for &s;ome Time totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. But upon Application to the Queen and the Councel they were again tolerated, under the following Re&s;tricti|ons. That no Plays be acted on <HI>Sundays</HI> at all, nor on any other Holidays till after Evening Prayer. That no playing be in the Dark, nor continue any &s;uch Time, but as any of the Auditors may return to their Dwellings in <HI>London</HI> before Sun&s;et, or at lea&s;t before it be dark. That the Queen's Players only be tolerated, and of them their Number and certain Names to be notifyed in the Lord Trea&s;urer's Let|ters to the Lord Mayor, and to the Ju&s;tices of <HI>Mid|dle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Surry</HI>. And tho&s;e her Players not to di|vide them&s;elves in &s;everal Companies. And that for breaking any of the&s;e Orders, their Toleration cea&s;e. But all the&s;e Pre&s;criptions were not &s;ufficient to keep them within due Bounds, but their Plays &s;o abu&s;ive oftentimes of Virtue, or particular Per&s;ons, gave great Offence, and occa&s;ioned many Di&s;turban|ces: Whence they were now and then &s;topped and &endq;prohibited.</Q>
'Tis hop'd this long Quotation from <HI>Stow</HI> will be excu&s;ed, as it &s;erves not only to prove &s;eve|ral Facts, but to &s;hew the Cu&s;toms of the Stage at that Time, and the early Depravity of it. But that the Plays not only of that Age, but long before, were &s;ometimes Per&s;onal Satires, appears from a Manu|&s;cript Letter from Sir <HI>John Hallies</HI> to the Lord Chancellor <HI>Burleigh</HI>, found among&s;t &s;ome Papers belonging to the Hou&s;e of Commons, in which the Knight accu&s;es his Lord&s;hip of having &s;aid &s;everal di&s;|honourable Things of him and his Family, particularly that his Grandfather, who had then been dead &s;eventy Years, was a Man &s;o remarkably covetous, that the common Players repre&s;ented him before the Court with great Applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="14">Thus we &s;ee the Stage no &s;ooner began to talk than it grew &s;currilous: And its fir&s;t Marks of &s;en&s;e were &s;een in Ribaldry and La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s. This occa&s;ioned much Offence; the Zeal of the Pulpit, and the Gravi|ty of the City equally concurred to condemn it. Ma|ny Pamphlets were wrote on both Sides. <HI>Stephen Go&s;|&s;on</HI>, in the Year 1579, publi&s;hed a Book, entituled, <HI>The School of Abu&s;e</HI>, or a <HI>plea&s;ant Invective again&s;t Poets, Pipers, Players, Je&s;ters, and &s;uch like Caterpillars of the Commonwealth</HI>; Dedicated to Sir <HI>Philip Sidney</HI>. He al&s;o wrote, <HI>Plays confuted in five Actions:</HI> Proving that they are not to be &s;uffered in a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Commonwealth: Dedicated to Sir <HI>Francis Wal&s;ingham</HI>. The Defendants in this Controver&s;y were <HI>Thomas Lodge</HI>, who wrote an old Play, called <HI>A Looking-Gla&s;s for</HI> London <HI>and</HI> En|gland, and that voluminous Dramatic Writer <HI>Thomas Heywood</HI>.</P>
<P>But to proceed; The Stage &s;oon after recovered its Credit, and ro&s;e to a higher Pitch than ever. In 1603, the fir&s;t Year of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, a Licen&s;e was granted under the Privy Seal to <HI>Shake&s;pear, Fletcher Burbage, Hemmings, Condel</HI>, and others, authorizing them to act Plays not only at their u&s;ual Hou&s;e, the <HI>Globe</HI> on the <HI>Bank&s;ide</HI>, but in any other Part of the King|dom, during his Maje&s;ty's Plea&s;ure. And now, as there lived together at this time many eminent Players, it may not be ami&s;s ju&s;t to &s;et down what we can collect, which will be but very little, of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them, with regard to their Talents and Abilities. And fir&s;t,
<Q>&startq;who is of more Report, &s;ays the Author of the <HI>Return from Parna&s;&s;us</HI>, than <HI>Dick Burbage</HI> and <HI>Will Kempe?</HI> He is not counted a Gentleman that knows not <HI>Dick Burbage</HI> and <HI>Will Kempe:</HI> There's not a Country Wench that can dance <HI>Sellenger's Round</HI>, but can talk of <HI>Dick Burbage</HI> and <HI>Will &endq;Kempe</HI>.</Q>
<HI>Burbage</HI> was the <HI>Betterton</HI>, and <HI>Kempe</HI> the <HI>Nokes</HI> of that Age. <HI>Burbage</HI> was the original <HI>Ri|chard</HI> the Third, and greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in that Character: <HI>Kempe</HI> was inimitable in the Part of a Clown.
<Q>&startq;He &s;ucceeded <HI>Tarleton</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Heywood</HI>) as well
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
in the Favour of her Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, as in the Opinion and good Thoughts of the general Audi|&endq;ence.</Q>
And <HI>Tarleton</HI>, &s;ays Sir <HI>Richard Baker</HI> in his Chro|nicle, for the Part of a Clown, never had his Match, nor ever will have. The Epitaph of <HI>Burbage</HI> is pre&s;erved in <HI>Cambden</HI>'s <HI>Remains</HI>, and is only EXIT BURBAGE. The Epitaph of <HI>Tarleton</HI> is pre&s;erved by the &s;ame Hi&s;torian as follows:
<Q><L>Hic &s;itus e&s;t, cujus Vox, Vultus, Actio po&s;&s;it</L>
<L>Ex Heraclito reddere Democritum.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next I &s;hall mention is <HI>Edward Allen</HI>, the Found|er of <HI>Dulwich Ho&s;pital</HI>; as famous for his Hone&s;ty, &s;ays <HI>Baker</HI>, as for his Acting; and two &s;uch Actors as he and <HI>Burbage</HI>, no Age mu&s;t ever look to &s;ee again. He's a Man, &s;ays <HI>Heywood</HI> in his Prologue to the <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Malta</HI>,
<Q><L>Whom we may rank with (doing no more Wrong)</L>
<L><HI>Proteus</HI> for Shapes, and <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> for a Tongue.</L></Q></P>
<P>Hear al&s;o <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI>, who&s;e Prai&s;e is of more Weight, as it never was lightly be&s;towed:
<Q><L>If <HI>Rome</HI> &s;o great, and in her wi&s;e&s;t Age,</L>
<L>Fear'd not to boa&s;t the Glories of her Stage,</L>
<L>A &s;kilful <HI>Ro&s;cius,</HI> and grave <HI>Ae&s;op,</HI> Men,</L>
<L>Yet crown'd with Honours as with Riches, then,</L>
<L>Who had no le&s;s a Trumpet of their Name</L>
<L>Than <HI>Cicero,</HI> who&s;e very Breath was Fame:</L>
<L>How can &s;o great Example die in me,</L>
<L>That, <HI>Allen,</HI> I &s;hould pau&s;e to publi&s;h thee?</L>
<L>Who both their Graces in thy&s;elf ha&s;t more</L>
<L>Out&s;tript, than they did all that went before;</L>
<L>And pre&s;ent Worth in all do&s;t &s;o contract,</L>
<L>As others &s;peak, but only thou do&s;t Act.</L>
<L>Wear this Renown; 'Tis ju&s;t that who did give,</L>
<L>So many Poets Life, by one &s;hould live.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="16"><HI>Thomas Green</HI> was famous for performing the Part of a Clown with great Propriety and Humour; and from his excellent Performance of the Character of <HI>Bubble</HI>, in a Comedy written by Mr. <HI>John Cooke</HI>, the Author called it after his Name, <HI>Green</HI>'s <HI>Tu Quoque</HI>.
<Q>&startq;There was not an Actor, &s;ays <HI>Heywood</HI>, of his Nature, in his Time, of better Ability in his Performance, more applauded by the Audience, of greater Grace at &endq;Court, or of more general Love in the City.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Hemmings</HI> and <HI>Condel</HI> were two con&s;iderable Actors in mo&s;t of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s, <HI>John&s;on</HI>'s and <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Plays; the fir&s;t in Tragedy, the la&s;t in Comedy: But they are better known for being the fir&s;t Editors of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Works in Folio, in the Year 1623, &s;even Years after his Death.</P>
<P><HI>Lowin, Taylor</HI>, and <HI>Benfield</HI> are mentioned by <HI>Ma&s;&s;en|ger</HI> as famous Actors. In a Satire again&s;t <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI>, are the&s;e two Lines:
<Q><L>Let <HI>Lowin</HI> cea&s;e, and <HI>Taylor</HI> &s;corn to touch</L>
<L>The loathed Stage, for thou ha&s;t made it &s;uch,</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Lowin</HI>, tho' &s;omething later than <HI>Burbage</HI>, is &s;aid to have been the fir&s;t Actor of <HI>Hamlet</HI>, and al&s;o the origi|nal <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth; from an Ob&s;ervation of who&s;e acting it in his later Days, Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> con|veyed his In&s;truction to Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>.</P>
<P>And now the Theatre&s;eems to have been at its Height of Glory and Reputation. Dramatic Authors abound|ed, and every Year produced a Number of new Plays: Nay, &s;o great was the Pa&s;&s;ion at this time for Shew or Repre&s;entation, that it was the Fa&s;hion for the No|bility to celebrate their Weddings, Birth-Days, and other Occa&s;ions of Rejoicing, with Ma&s;ques and Inter-Indes, which were exhibited with &s;urpri&s;ing Expence; that great Architect <HI>Inigo Jones</HI> being frequently em|ployed to furni&s;h Decorations with all the Magnificence of his Invention. The King and his Lords, the Queen and her Ladies, frequently performed in the&s;e Ma&s;ques at Court, and all the Nobility in their own private Hou&s;es: In &s;hort, no publick Entertainment was thought com|plete without them; and to this Humour it is we owe; and perhaps 'tis all we owe it, the inimitable <HI>Ma&s;que at
<PB N="xv" REF="17">
Ludlow-Ca&s;tle</HI>. For the &s;ame univer&s;al Eagerne&s;s after Theatrical Diver&s;ions continued during the whole Reign of King <HI>James</HI>, and great Part of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, till Puritani&s;m, which had now gathered great Strength, more openly oppo&s;ed them as wicked and diabolical. If we may judge of this Spirit from <HI>Prynne</HI>'s famous <HI>Hi&s;|trio-ma&s;tix</HI>, or <HI>Players Scourge</HI>, it appears to have been a Zeal much without Knowledge. This was a heavy Load of dull Abu&s;e, publi&s;hed in 1633, again&s;t Plays, Players, and all who favoured them, by <HI>William Prynne</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Barri&s;ter of <HI>Lincoln's-Inn</HI>. The be&s;t way the Parties concerned, thought of, in an&s;wer to this Work, was to publi&s;h all the be&s;t old Plays that could then be found; &s;o that many that had never yet &s;een the Light, were now brought forth. In &s;hort the Pa|trons of the Stage for &s;ome &s;hort time prevailed; <HI>Prynne</HI>'s Book was deemed an infamous Libel both again&s;t the Church and State, again&s;t the Peers, Prelates, and Magi&s;trates; and particularly again&s;t the King and Queen, where he &s;ays, that <HI>Princes dancing in their own Per&s;ons, was the Cau&s;e of their untimely Ends: That our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Ladies, &s;horn and frizzled Madams, had lo&s;t their Mode&s;ty: That Plays were the chief Delight of the Devil, and all that frequented them were damned</HI>. As he knew the King and Queen frequented them daily, this was thought to reflect on their Maje&s;ties. To all Mu&s;ick he has an utter Antipathy, but Church-mu&s;ick in par|ticular, which he calls the <HI>bleating of brute Bea&s;ts</HI>; and &s;ays, <HI>the Chori&s;ters bellow the Tenor as if they were Ox|en, bark a Counter-point like a Kennel of Hounds, roar a Treble as if they were Bulls, and grunt out a Ba&s;e like a Parcel of Hogs</HI>. For the&s;e and many other Pa&s;&s;ages, it was ordered to be burnt by the Hands of the common Hangman: And his Sentence was, to be put from the Bar, excluded the Society of <HI>Lincoln's-Inn</HI>, and degrad|ed by the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI>; to &s;tand in the Pillory at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> and in <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI>, to lo&s;e an Ear at each Place, and &s;tand with a Paper on his Head, declaring his Offence to be the publi&s;hing an infamous Libel again&s;t both their Maje&s;ties, and the Government; to be fined 5000<HI>l.</HI> and
<PB N="xvi" REF="18">
&s;uffer perpetual impri&s;onment. This Sentence was ex|ecuted on him with great Rigour. But Puritani&s;m, from a thou&s;and concurrent Cau&s;es every Day gathering Strength, in a little time overturned the Con&s;titution; and, among&s;t their many Reformations this was one, the total Suppre&s;&s;ion of all Plays and Playhou&s;es.</P>
<P>Thus we have brought down this imperfect E&s;&s;ay on the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, to the Pe|riod which was fir&s;t intended: To pur&s;ue it farther, and take it up again at the Re&s;toration, when a new Patent was granted to Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI>, would be need|le&s;s; becau&s;e from that time the Affairs of the Stage are tolerably well known. If what is done &s;hall give any Satisfaction to the Curious, it is more than we have dared to promi&s;e our&s;elves from our own Sen&s;e of its great Imperfection; but we hope it will be con&s;idered, what &s;lender Materials either the Ignorance of tho&s;e Times, or the Injury of the following, have afforded us. We are as it were, the fir&s;t Adventurers on the&s;e Di&s;co|veries, and it is not rea&s;onable to expect more Perfec|tion than is commonly found in the fir&s;t Attempts of this Nature. All that we can &s;ay is, that we have thrown to|gether 2 Number of Curious Circum&s;tances on the Sub|ject, that the Reader would &s;eek for in vain el&s;ewhere. And if the Novelty of them &s;hould excite the Curio&s;ity of any Per&s;on of greater Abilities, or more Lei&s;ure, to make a &s;tricter Enquiry into this Matter, he would certainly oblige us, and perhaps the Public.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. WILLIAM SHAKESPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>This immortal Author was the Son of Mr. <HI>John Shake&s;pear</HI>, an eminent Dealer in Wool, and born in <HI>April</HI>, 1564. <HI>Stratford</HI> upon the River <HI>Avon</HI>, in the County of <HI>Warwick</HI>, is the indi&s;puted Place of his Birth; and the Inhabitants have as much Rea&s;on to boa&s;t of his Nativity, as tho&s;e of <HI>Smyrna</HI> for the Birth of <HI>Homer</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="33">He was educated at a Free-School in <HI>Stratford</HI>, where he acquired &s;ome Knowledge of the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue; but his Father having a numerous Family, he was taken from thence at a Time when other Youths are beginning to pro&s;ecute their Studies; and being de&s;igned for the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s with his Father, he was married very young to the Daughter of one Mr. <HI>Hathaway</HI>, a &s;ub&s;tantial Yeoman in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Stratford</HI>.</P>
<P>In this Way of Life he continued for &s;ome Time, till an Extravagance, which was too common among the young Fellows of that Time, forced him from his Trade and Country; this was no le&s;s than a frequent Practice of &s;tealing Deer out of the Park of Sir <HI>Tho|mas Lucy</HI> of <HI>Cherlecot</HI> near <HI>Stratford</HI>, which brought on a rigorous Pro&s;ecution again&s;t him, obliged him to take refuge in <HI>London</HI>, and afterwards proved the Occa&s;ion of exerting one of the greate&s;t <HI>Genius</HI>'s that ever was known in Dramatic Poetry.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t Acquaintance with the Play-hou&s;e is &s;aid to have commenced about this Time, where it is not un|natural to &s;uppo&s;e he was introduced by <HI>Thomas Green</HI> the Comedian, who we have learned, was $orn in the &s;ame Town with our Author.

<P><PB N="10" REF="34">Though we have no remaining traces of his Excel|lence in any Part, yet his admirable Wit, and the Na|tural turn of it to the Stage, &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him, if not as an extraordinary Actor, at lea&s;t as an excel|lent Writer. He became one of the Directors in the Management of the Theatre, and by his Influence and Recommendation brought a Play of <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI>'s on the Stage, which would otherwi&s;e have been laid a&s;ide by the Actors. In the <HI>Licence</HI> granted by King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t, he was joined with <HI>Fletcher</HI> the Poet, and the Actors <HI>Burbage, Hemmings</HI>, and <HI>Condel</HI></P>
<P>Whatever the particular Times of his Writing were, the People of his Age could not but be highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee a <HI>Genius</HI> ari&s;e among&s;t them of &s;o plea&s;urable, &s;o rich a Vein, and &s;o plentifully capable of furni&s;hing their favourite Entertainments. Be&s;ides the Advanta|ges of his Wit, he was him&s;elf a good natured Man, of great Sweetne&s;s of Manners, and a mo&s;t agreeable Companion; &s;o that it is no wonder he made him&s;elf acquainted with the be&s;t Conver&s;ations of tho&s;e Times. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had &s;everal of his Plays acted before her, and gave him many gracious Marks of her Favour: What Grace &s;oever the Queen conferred upon him, it was not to her only he owed the Fortune which the Reputation of his Wit made. He had the Honour to meet with many great and uncommon Marks of Fa|vour and Friend&s;hip from the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI>, who at one Time gave him a Thou&s;and Pounds, to enable him to go through with a Purcha&s;e which he heard he had a Mind to. A very extraordinary Boun|ty at that Time.</P>
<P>As to his particular Friend&s;hips with private Men, every one who had a true Ta&s;te of Merit, and could di&s;|tingui&s;h Men, had generally a ju&s;t Value and E&s;teem for him. His exceeding Candour and good Nature mu&s;t certainly have inclined all the gentler Part of the World to love him as the Power of his Wit obliged Men of the mo&s;t delicate Knowledge and polite Learning to admire h$m. Among the&s;e, was the in|comparable Mr. <HI>Edmund Spen&s;er</HI>, who &s;peaks of him in

<P><HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> was too apt upon every Occa&s;ion to le&s;&s;en the Value of our inimitable Author; and others of his Cotemporary Writers followed his Exam|ple. <HI>Beaumont</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> in their Comedy of the <HI>Scornful Lady</HI>, bring in <HI>Sir Roger</HI> the Par&s;on to ridicule that Excellent Soliloquy &s;poken by <HI>Hamlet</HI> in the 2d.

<P>There is a plea&s;ing and well di&s;tingui&s;hed Va|riety in tho&s;e Characters, which he painted after Na|ture. But what need we &s;ay more of this ex|cellent Author, who&s;e Genius is his be&s;t Herald, and who&s;e Works the be&s;t Trumpet to proclaim it.</P>
<P>The latter Part of his Life was &s;pent, as all Men of good Sen&s;e will wi&s;h theirs may be; in Ea&s;e, Retire|ment, and the Conver&s;ation of his Friends. He had the good Fortune to gather an E&s;tate equal to this Oc|ca&s;ion, and in that to his Wi&s;h; and is &s;aid to have &s;pent &s;ome Years before his Death at his Native <HI>Strat|ford</HI>. His plea&s;urable Wit and Good nature engaged him in the Acquaintance, and intituled him to the Friend&s;hip of the Gentlemen of the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>He died in the Year 1616, in the 53d. Year of his Age, and was buried in the Chancel of the great Church at <HI>Stratford</HI>, where a Monument is placed in the Wall, with his Statue leaning on a Cu&s;hion, and this In&s;crip|tion:

<P>In the Year 1740, a fine Statue of him, at full length, was &s;et up in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby</HI>, de&s;igned by Mr. <HI>Kent</HI>, and executed by Mr. <HI>Schemakers</HI>, with this In&s;cription:

<P>It is &s;aid that while he had the Trowel in his Hand, he had con&s;tantly a <HI>Horace</HI> in his Pocket, with which he diverted his lei&s;ure Hours, and improved his Genius; but not by this Author only, for he was a&s;&s;iduous in his Application to the Study of all the celebrated <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, and had a cla&s;&s;ical Reve|rence for Antiquity. All the De&s;igns of his Plays are great and noble, but he has been cen&s;ured for the Roughne&s;s and Pedantry of his Style, as well as for the
<PB N="26" REF="50">
Roughne&s;s of his Humour, and too great an Opi|nion of his own Merit.</P>
<P>Whether he fir&s;t appeared upon the Stage as a Poet, or an Actor, is $ncertain, for he was both; the chief Part, we are told, he performed in his latter Capacity, was the Character of <HI>Moro&s;e</HI>, (a Picture it is &s;aid, which he drew from him&s;elf) in his own Play, called the <HI>Silent Woman</HI>; but tho' he was &s;o much admired for his Writings, we hear but little of him as an Actor.</P>
<P>He &s;ucceeded MICHAEL DRAYTON as Poet Lau|reat to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and died in 1637, in the 63d. Year of his Age. He was buried in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey</HI>, on the We&s;t &s;ide, near the Belfry, having at fir&s;t on|ly a flat Stone over his Grave, with this In&s;cription,</P>

<P>This Gentleman was the Son of <HI>Robert Waller</HI> of <HI>Agmonde&s;ham</HI>, in the County of <HI>Buckingham</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and his Mother was of the antient Family of the <HI>Hampdens</HI>, in the &s;ame County. His Father, who died when he

<P>He began to write at &s;ixteen Years of Age, and was &s;o early ripe for Bu&s;ine&s;s, that at &s;eventeen he was cho|&s;en into the la&s;t Parliament of King <HI>James</HI> I. as Re|pre&s;entative for the Borough of <HI>Agmonde&s;ham</HI>.</P>
<P>During the U&s;urpation of <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>, he was concerned in a con&s;piracy to recover the City of <HI>Lon|don</HI> into the King's Hands; but being betrayed by his Si&s;ter, he was fined 10,000l. and &s;uffered Bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>After the Re&s;toration of the Royal Family, he was greatly regarded by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. as he was a Man of great Wit, and an exalted Genius: He was looked upon as one of the fir&s;t Refiners of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;ification.

<HEAD>JOHN DRYDEN, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>Poet Laureat to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II. was de&s;cended from an ancient Family, in <HI>Northamp|ton&s;hire</HI>, Son of <HI>Era&s;mus Dryden</HI>, of <HI>Tichmarch</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>
<PB N="83" REF="109">
He had his fir&s;t Education, as a King's Scholar in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI>-School, under the Learned Dr. <HI>Busby</HI>, and in the Year 1650, was elected from thence to <HI>Trinity-College, Cambridge</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>, in the Dedication of his Dramatic Works to the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>, gives him the fol|lowing Character.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> had per&s;onal Qualities to challenge both Love and E&s;teem from all who were truly ac|quainted with him: He was of a Nature exceedingly humane and compa&s;&s;ionate, ea&s;ily forgiving Injuries, and capable of a prompt and &s;incere Reconciliation with tho&s;e who had offended him. Such a Tempe|rament is the only &s;olid Foundation of all moral Vir|tues and &s;ociable Endowments. His Friend&s;hip, where he profe&s;&s;ed it, went much beyond his Pro|fe&s;&s;ions; tho' his Hereditary Income was little more &endq;than a bare Competency.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As his Reading had been very exten&s;ive, &s;o was he very happy in a Memory tenacious of every thing that he read. He was not more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Know|lege than he was communicative of it: But then his Communication of it was by no means Pedantic, or impo&s;ed upon the Conver&s;ation; but ju&s;t &s;uch, and went &s;o far, as by the natural Turns of the Di&s;cour&s;e, in which he was engaged, it was nece&s;&s;arily promot|ed &endq;or required.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;He was extreme ready and gentle in his Cor|rection of the Errors of any Writer, who thought fit to con&s;ult him; and full as ready and patient to admit of the Reprehen&s;ion of others, in Re&s;pect of his own Over&s;ights or Mi&s;takes. He was of very ea&s;y, I may &s;ay of very plea&s;ing Acce&s;s, but &s;omewhat &s;low, and as it were diffident in his Advances to others. He had &s;omething in his Nature that ab|horred Intru&s;ion into any Society what&s;oever. In|deed it is to be regretted that he was rather blame|able in the other Extreme; for by that Means, he was per&s;onally le&s;s known; and con&s;equently his Character might become liable both to Mi&s;apprehen|&s;ion &endq;and Mi&s;repre&s;entation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="110">
<Q>&startq;To the be&s;t of my Knowledge and Ob&s;ervation, he was, of all Men that ever I knew, one of the mo&s;t mode&s;t, and the mo&s;t ea&s;ily to be di&s;countenan|ced in his Approaches, either to his Superiors or &endq;his Equals.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Writings, I &s;hall not take up|on me to &s;peak of them; for to &s;ay little of them, would not be to do them right, and to &s;ay all that I ought to &s;ay, would be to be very voluminous. But I may venture to &s;ay in general Terms, that no Man had written in our Language &s;o much and &s;o various Matter, and in &s;o various Manners, &s;o well. Ano|ther thing I may &s;ay was very peculiar to him; which is, that his Parts did not decline with his Years; but that he was an improving Writer to his la&s;t, even to near &s;eventy Years of Age, improving even in Fire and Imagination, as well as in Judg|ment; witne&s;s his Ode on St. <HI>Cecilia's Day</HI>, and his &endq;Fables, his la&s;t Performances.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;He was equally excellent in Ver&s;e and in Pro&s;e: His Pro&s;e had all the Clearne&s;s imaginable, together with all the Noblene&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion, all the Graces and Ornaments proper and peculiar to it, without deviating into the Language or Diction of Poetry. I make this Ob&s;ervation only to di&s;tingui&s;h his Style from that of many Poetical Writers, who meaning to write harmoniou&s;ly in Pro&s;e, do in truth often &endq;write meer blank Ver&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;His Ver&s;ification and his Numbers he could learn of no body: For he fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e Talents in Perfection in our Tongue: And they who have be&s;t &s;ucceeded in them &s;ince his Time, have been in|debted to his Example; and the more they have been able to imitate him, the better have they &s;uc|&endq;ceeded.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As his Style in Pro&s;e is always &s;pecifically diffe|rent from his Style in Poetry; &s;o on the other hand in his Poems, his Diction is, wherever his Subject re|quires it, &s;o Sublime, and &s;o truly Poetical, that its E&s;&s;ence, like that of pure Gold, cannot be de&s;troyed.
<PB N="85" REF="111">
Take his Ver&s;es and dive&s;t them of their Rhimes, disjoint them in their Numbers, tran&s;po&s;e their Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, make what Arrangement and Di&s;po&s;ition you plea&s;e of his Words, yet &s;hall there eternally be Poetry, and &s;omething which will be found incapa|ble of being re&s;olved into ab&s;olute Pro&s;e; an incon|&endq;te&s;table Characteri&s;tic of a truly Poetical Genius.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I will &s;ay but one Word more in General of his Writings; which is, that what he has done in any one Species, or di&s;tinct Kind, would have been &s;ufficient to have acquired him a great Name. If he had written Nothing but his Prefaces, or nothing but his Songs, or his Prologues, each of them would have intitled him to the Preference and di&s;tinction of &endq;excelling in this Kind.</Q></P>
<P>He died in <HI>London</HI>, in the Year 1700, in the 67th Year of his Age, and was buried with great Funeral Pomp, in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey</HI>, at the Expence of the Lord <HI>Jefferies</HI>.

<P>This Witty Nobleman was born at <HI>Ditchly</HI> in <HI>Ox|ford&s;hire</HI> in 1648, and the Son of <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>, who through almo&s;t in&s;uperable Difficulties, carried of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. after the Battle of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>.</P>
<P>He received an Education &s;uitable to his Rank, and through a lively Genius and a natural Propen&s;ity to Learning, could repeat almo&s;t every line of <HI>Horace, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI>, before he was &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI>.</P>
<P>He made the Tour of <HI>Europe</HI>, and returned from his Travels at Eighteen Years of Age.

<P>On his Return he gave into all the Plea&s;ures of the Court and Town, of Love and Wine; which at that Time were carried to a prodigious Exce&s;s, under the Smiles of a Monarch, formed by Nature for the En|joyment of the mo&s;t elegant De&s;ires.</P>
<P>His Talent for Satire was admirable; he &s;pared no body, not even his Maje&s;ty, who at length bani&s;hed

<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> was entered in this Company before he was twenty Years of Age, and &s;oon acquired the Reputation of a promi&s;ing Genius. While he was ri&s;ing to perfection under Mr. <HI>Rhodes, Charles</HI> II. grant|ed a Patent to Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> for erecting a Company under the Name of the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Ser|vants, who took Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>, and all who acted un|der Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> into his Company, in the Year 1662.</P>

Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> weary of the Fatigues and Toil of Go|vernment, delivered his Company over to this new Li|cence: But they again giving Way to the new Mode of Operas the Companies were once more united in <HI>Dru|ry-Lane</HI>, and the Operas confined to the <HI>Hay-Mar|ket</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> being now very old, and much af|flicted with the Gout, was re&s;olved to quit the Stage, and take leave of the Town in a public Manner, on his Benefit Night, which was the 7th of <HI>April</HI> 1709.

<P>His Father being a younger Brother, his Affairs and his Command in the Army carried him into <HI>Ireland</HI>, when Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> was very young, by which Means he had his Education in the great School or College of <HI>Kilkenny</HI> and the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Dublin</HI>, which was the Rea&s;on why &s;ome People imagined he was born in that Kingdom.</P>

But <HI>Haines</HI> had too little Taciturnity for an Employment of that Kind; for Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> too often heard the Sub&s;tance of his Epi&s;tles to Foreign Courts, before they could come to the Hands of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were to re|ceive them. Upon this Account, <HI>Joe</HI> was remov|ed from his Employment; however <HI>Sir Jo&s;eph</HI> re|commended him to one of the Heads of the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge</HI>, where he was willingly received; but a Company of Players coming to <HI>Stourbridge</HI> Fair, near that Place, <HI>Joe</HI> fell &s;o much in Love with their Employment and Way of Living, that he threw away his Cap and Band, and made one of their Company.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon called to the King's Company in <HI>Dru|ry-Lane</HI>, where his inimitable Performance and Viva|city brought him into the Familiarity, of the Wits of the Age, and Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank, in &s;o much, that a Noble Duke going Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>France</HI>, thought it no Di&s;grace to take <HI>Haines</HI> as a Companion. <HI>Joe</HI> (be&s;ides the dead Languages) &s;poke <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>French</HI> to as much Perfection, as if he had been born both at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI>, and therefore it is no Wonder that he was care&s;&s;ed by many of the <HI>French</HI> Nobility.

<P>After his <HI>French</HI> Expedition he returned to the Stage again, and had the Art to form the Countenances of his Audience by his own; for the Mu&s;cles of his Face, were, like Gaping, generally catching. His <HI>Prologues</HI> and <HI>Epilogues</HI> do not &s;eem extraordinary in the Reading, but his manner of &s;peaking, made them inimitable.</P>
<P>The Epilogue in particular that he &s;poke riding on an A&s;s, created &s;uch a Laughter and reiterated Ap|plau&s;es, that it was near Half an Hour in the &s;peaking.</P>

<HEAD><HI>COLLY CIBBER, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> Poet Laureat.</HEAD>
<P>This Poet was the Son of <HI>Gabriel Cibber</HI>, a Native of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI>, and a Statuary in the Reign of <HI>Char|les</HI> II. and very excellent in his Art; as appears by the Figures of the two Lunatics, on the Piers of the Gate at <HI>Bedlam</HI>, the Ba&s;&s;o-relievo on the Pede&s;tal of the Monument at the Bottom of <HI>Fi&s;h-Street-Hill</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He had a very early Inclination to the Stage, and, contrary to the Advice of his Father, turned Player, before he was twenty Years of Age.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part in which he appeared with any Glimp&s;e of Succe&s;s was the Chaplain in the <HI>Orphan</HI>, which he performed &s;o well, that it drew &s;uch a Commendation upon him, from an old and celebrated Actor, that, as he tells us him&s;elf, it filled his Bo&s;om with as great Tran&s;ports as ever were felt by <HI>Alexander</HI> or <HI>Charles</HI> the XIIth of <HI>Sweden</HI>, at the Head of their Victorious Armies.</P>
<P>The next Part was that of Lord <HI>Touchwood</HI>, in <HI>Con|greve</HI>'s <HI>Double Dealer</HI>, acted before Queen <HI>Mary</HI>, which he got perfect in one Day, upon the Illne&s;s of <HI>Kyna&s;ton</HI> who was to have acted the Part. To this he was recommended by the Author, and performed it &s;o well, that Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> made him this Compliment of &s;aying, that he had not only an&s;wered, but had exceeded his Expectations. And he &s;aid more of him to his Ma&s;ters, the Patentees, upon which his Salary, was rai&s;ed from fifteen Shillings a Week as it then &s;tood, to twenty. And this &s;ame Actor we have &s;een within the&s;e few Years acting at the Pay of fifty Pounds a Night.</P>
<P>The Part of <HI>Fondle-Wife</HI>, in the <HI>Old-Batchelor</HI>, was the next he was taken any Notice of in, which Part he al&s;o got up in a Hurry, upon a Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity; but mimicked <HI>Dogget</HI> &s;o well in it, that he got great Ap|plau&s;e.</P>
<P>A Year after this he wrote his fir&s;t Play, <HI>Love's la&s;t Shift</HI>, in which he performed the Part of Sir <HI>No|velty Fa&s;hion</HI>. The Play had de&s;erved Succe&s;s, and
<PB N="123" REF="149">
the Fop was &s;o well executed, that from that Time Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> was never thought to have his Equal in Parts of the &s;ame Ca&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Year 1711, he became a Patentee and joint Sharer, in the Management of the Theatre in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>, with Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Dogget</HI>; as he was afterwards with Sir <HI>Richard Steele, Wilks</HI> and <HI>Booth</HI>.

<P>He began very early to apply him&s;elf to the Stage as an Actor, following the Examples of <HI>Lee</HI> and <HI>Ot|way</HI>, with our great <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>, and with like Succe&s;s, who though all excellent <HI>Dramatic Poets</HI> made but indifferent Actors; however Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> having the Advantage of a very good Per&s;on, tho' with a weak Voice, was never repul&s;ed by the Audience. But the following Accident made him determine to leave off the Occupation. Playing the Part of <HI>Guiomar</HI> in the <HI>In|dian Emperor</HI>, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to kill <HI>Va&s;quez</HI> one of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Generals, not remembering to change his Sword for a Foil, in the Mock Engagement he wounded the Per&s;on that repre&s;ented <HI>Va&s;quez</HI>, tho' as it fell out not dangerou&s;ly; neverthele&s;s it put an End to his appear|ing on the Stage as an Actor.</P>
<P>He wrote his fir&s;t Comedy of <HI>Love and a Bottle</HI> at nineteen, and was peculiarly happy in the Choice of his Subjects, which he took care to adorn with varie|ty of Characters and Incidents.</P>
<P>He attempted to play the Part of Sir <HI>Harry Wildair</HI> for his own Benefit in <HI>Dublin</HI>, which an&s;wered his De|&s;ign in gaining a crowded Audience; but he executed the Part &s;o lamely that his Friends were a&s;hamed for him. Thus $e &s;ee a <HI>good</HI> Poet may make but an <HI>in|different</HI> Actor.</P>
<P>His Plays were wrote in the Order as follows.

<P>His la&s;t Comedy, was wrote in &s;ix Weeks, during a &s;ettled Illne&s;s all the while; he perceived the Ap|proaches of Death before he had fini&s;hed the la&s;t Act, and as he often foretold, died before the Run of the Play was over.</P>
<P>His Friend Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, often vi&s;ited him in his Ill|ne&s;s: In one of the&s;e Vi&s;its, he told Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>, that Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> thought he had dealt too freely with the Character of Mrs. <HI>Sullen</HI> in giving her to <HI>Archer</HI>, with|out a proper Divorce, which was not a &s;ecurity for her Honour; <HI>to &s;alve that</HI>, replied the Author, <HI>I'll get a real Divorce, Marry her my&s;elf, and give her my Bond &s;he &s;hall be a real Widow in le&s;s than a Fortnight</HI>.</P>
<P>When he expired, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> took care to bury him decently in St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the Fields, and found among his Papers this &s;hort Note.</P>

<P>This uncommon Favourite of the Mu&s;es was Son of Dr. <HI>Lancelot Addi&s;on</HI>, Dean of <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Coventry</HI>, by his Wife <HI>Jane</HI>, who&s;e Maiden Name was <HI>Gul&s;tone</HI>. He was born at <HI>Mil&s;ton</HI>, near <HI>Amesbury</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI>, on the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI>, 1672, and was very early put under the Care of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Nai&s;h</HI> at the School of <HI>Amesbury</HI>, but was &s;oon after removed to <HI>Salisbury</HI> School, and from thence to the <HI>Charter Hou&s;e</HI> in <HI>London</HI>, where the fir&s;t Intimacy began between him and Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI>, which continued as long as he lived. From the <HI>Charter Hou&s;e</HI> he went to <HI>Queen's College, Oxford</HI>, and in about two Years after was elected into <HI>Magdalene College</HI>, and there took his Degrees of Batchelor and Ma&s;ter of Arts. One of the fir&s;t Specimens he gave of his extraordinary Genius in <HI>Poetry</HI>, was a &s;hort Copy of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;es, dated from <HI>Magdalene-College</HI>, 1693, when the Author was not above 22 Years of Age, to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> upon his tran&s;lation of <HI>Virgil, Horace, Juvenal, Per&s;ius</HI>, and

<HI>Ovid</HI>. He &s;oon after gave a Ver&s;ion of the fourth <HI>Georgic</HI>, prefixed to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s tran&s;lation of <HI>Virgil</HI>.</P>
<P>His De&s;ign of going into Orders, was over ruled by his Friend the Earl of <HI>Halifax</HI>, that great Patron of the Mu&s;es, and all the polite Arts, who, as Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> informs us, made warm In&s;tances to the Head of <HI>Magdalene-Col$ege</HI>, not to in&s;i&s;t upon his going into Orders, but to &s;uffer him to come into Bu&s;ine&s;s, where Men of liberal Educations were &s;o much wanted. That noble Lord concludes his Letter,
<Q>&startq;That however he might be repre&s;ented as no Friend to the Church, he would never do it any other Injury than keeping &endq;Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> out of it.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Latin</HI> Poems of Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>, publi&s;hed in the <HI>Mu&s;oe Anglicanae</HI>, were not only admired at Home, but Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boileau</HI>, the celebrated <HI>French</HI> Poet, upon peru&s;ing them, is &s;aid to have conceived a greater Idea of the Genius of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation for Poetry, than he ever had before, and &s;hewed the Author very great Civilities when he was in <HI>France</HI>. By the Intere&s;t of the Lord <HI>Somers</HI>, Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> procured a Pen&s;ion of three hundred Pounds a Year from the Crown to &s;upport his Expences in travelling to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>. In 1701, he wrote <HI>A Letter to the Lord</HI> Halifax <HI>from</HI> Italy, in Ver&s;e, which is looked upon as one of his fine&s;t Pieces in that &s;ort of Poetry. The Author had al&s;o &s;o much e&s;teem in the la&s;t mentioned Nation, that this Letter was tran&s;lated into <HI>Italian</HI>, by Sig. <HI>Salvini</HI>, Profe&s;&s;or of the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue at <HI>Florence</HI>.</P>
<P>When our Author was about to return to <HI>England</HI>, in 1702, he received Letters from his Friends, to let him know that he was de&s;igned to attend the Army under Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI>, as Secretary from King <HI>William</HI>; but a Stop was put to this, by the Death of his Maje&s;ty; an Account of which he received at <HI>Ge|neva</HI>. And his Friends having lo&s;t their Intere&s;t in the beginning of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, which prevent|ed his farther Advancement, he had Lei&s;ure to make the Tour of <HI>Germany</HI> in his Way home. It was at <HI>Vienna</HI> he began to methodize his Book of Medals, which is a curious Piece.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="175">At the Time of the Victory at <HI>Blenheim</HI>, Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> was entirely without Employment in the State, therefore took up a Lodging according to his <HI>Finances</HI>, which were not very great.
