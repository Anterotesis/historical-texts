<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CXXII. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>They &s;hall pro&s;per that love Thee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS P&s;alm was compo&s;ed by holy <HI>David,</HI> for the U&s;e of the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when they went up to <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> to wor&s;hip at the appointed Solem|nities: And the De&s;ign of it was to in&s;pire them with a Regard and Love for their Coun|try. His principal Care therefore was to con&s;ider what Means would be mo&s;t effectual to this Purpo&s;e; and his Wi&s;dom and Experi|ence &s;oon led him to ob&s;erve, that nothing was &s;o likely to rai&s;e this public Spirit, as a Pro|mi&s;e of Pro&s;perity; a Motive which would have great Influence on the human Mind, and, more particularly, among a People who were intently fixed on the Enjoyment of temporal Happine&s;s.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>The Love which a Man bears to the Coun|try wherein he was born is an univer&s;al Prin|ciple, which was, no Doubt, implanted in the human Brea&s;t, by the all-wi&s;e Creator, as an Incentive to great and good Actions; and in|deed the Effects of it have been &s;uch as a Principle le&s;s exten&s;ive could never have pro|duced.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory will furni&s;h us with numberle&s;s Ex|amples of this Truth, but happy is it for us that we need not look farther than our own Age and Nation.</P>
<P>All Men are born with this exalted Prin|ciple; it is &s;tamp'd upon every Heart: But to be in a Situation that may make it of great and &s;ignal Service is the Lot only of a Few: The common People feel it very &s;trongly; but cannot, as Individuals, make it of any material Advantage. In Per&s;ons of Rank, and with Abilities equal to their Rank, it may have its utmo&s;t Scope; nor can they, at any Time, forget the Duty which it pre|&s;cribes,
<PB N="7" REF="6">without making them&s;elves the Objects of perpetual Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>This perhaps may be more clearly under|&s;tood, by pointing out an In&s;tance or two, in which this great Principle, THE LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY, may be exerted.</P>
<P>He, who is ble&s;s'd with &s;uperior Talents, and in a proper Situation to exert them, will give the fure&s;t Proof of his Patrioti&s;m, by the Re|verence which he pays to the Religion of his Country; and this not only by a&s;&s;enting in ge|neral to the Doctrines of it, but by a &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of the Duties which it pre&s;cribes. Piety gives the be&s;t Lu&s;tre to Greatne&s;s. It ennobles the Faculties of the Mind, and &s;ancti|fies their U&s;e, making them, as <HI>Solomon</HI> ele|gantly &s;peaks, <HI>like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</HI> The Man who is of this happy Di&s;|po&s;ition has an infinite Advantage over tho&s;e who&s;e irreligious Sentiments, and depraved Morals, exactly, but fatally corre&s;pond: For they can never obtain the Confidence of the
<PB N="8" REF="7">Publick, becau&s;e, having no Principle, they will of cour&s;e di&s;regard every Obligation: Whereas a religious Man meets with, and de|&s;erves the implicit Tru&s;t that is repo&s;ed in him; a Tru&s;t which he can never abu&s;e who con&s;iders him&s;elf as accountable to God for all his Actions.</P>
<P>Again; He who loves his Country, will con&s;cientiou&s;ly ob&s;erve the Laws which it has e&s;tabli&s;hed. In every well regulated State equal Regard is paid to the Power of the Go|vernor, and to the Liberties of tho&s;e who are governed. It is extremely difficult to avoid particular Attachments. Men incline to a Side or Party, as Intere&s;t, or Education, or Humour happens to direct; but the true Pa|triot forms his Judgment and determines his Actions by the golden Mean: He faithfully renders all due Re&s;pect and Service to the Ma|je&s;ty of Princes, but without &s;acrificing the Liberty of the Subject, and zealou&s;ly exerts every Ability, le&s;t Power &s;hould grow into
<PB N="9" REF="8">Tyranny, or Liberty degenerate into Licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Farther; Every one of great Abilities, who is employed in the Service of his Country will endeavour to cheri&s;h in his Mind all tho&s;e Virtues which his Station is capable of exer|ci&s;ing. He who holds the Reins of Govern|ment, a Ta&s;k &s;o arduous that few have even a Conception of it, may be cautious; but he mu&s;t be void of Fear. The con&s;cious Inte|grity of his Heart will &s;upply him with Steadi|ne&s;s and Courage; and though the Weight of Power may &s;ometimes oppre&s;s, yet will the Uprightne&s;s of his Intentions in&s;pire him with a Re&s;olution &s;uperior to every Difficulty. He acts with uncommon Vigor in detecting, by Vigilance, the fal&s;e Friends; and oppo&s;ing, by Intrepidity, the avowed Enemies of his Country. He calls forth every Virtue for the Service of his royal Ma&s;ter, and, what is in&s;eparably connected with it, the general Welfare of the State. Genero&s;ity, Honour, and a Regard for the public Good are con|&s;picuous
<PB N="10" REF="9">in him; without which the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Abilities are, to all virtuous and honourable Purpo&s;es, utterly ineffectual: And the&s;e great and nece&s;&s;ary Virtues will be &s;o con&s;tantly guarded and defended by him, that no bold pre&s;umptuous Vice, or little Meanne&s;s, will be able to mix with them, and by that Means, either fully or deba&s;e their Excellence. For can the Ava|ritious, the Profligate, or the Ambitious, who&s;e &s;ole Aim, is to devour, to corrupt, and to en&s;lave, be called LOVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY?</P>
<P>But we &s;hall be fully in&s;tructed in this great and amiable Character, by &s;umming up every Circum&s;tance belonging to it, in the conci&s;e and expre&s;&s;ive Terms of one who derived his Knowledge from the Fountain of Truth &mdash; LOVE THE BROTHERHOOD &mdash; FEAR GOD &mdash; HONOUR THE KING.</P>
<P>Having thus pointed out &s;ome particular In|&s;tances, in which that great Principle, THE LOVE
<PB N="11" REF="10">OF OUR COUNTRY, may be properly exerted, it will be of U&s;e to examine into the Rea&s;ons on which the A&s;&s;ertion in the Text may be founded, <HI>They &s;hall pro&s;per that love Thee.</HI></P>
<P>The true Lover of his Country has Rea&s;on to hope for Pro&s;perity, from the Means which he makes u&s;e of to attain Succe&s;s. A good Inten|tion, however laudable, will not be &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to make any De&s;ign pro&s;perous; but if the Plan be well laid, and the con&s;tituent Parts are firm and well connected, and if the&s;e E&s;&s;entials are founded on the be&s;t Inten|tion, namely, the true Intere&s;t of a Nation, we &s;hall not only be ready to approve of, but even to an&s;wer for the Succe&s;s of any Enter|prize concerted with &s;o much Wi&s;dom. We of this happy Kingdom are able to produce a&s;toni&s;hing Proofs of the great Con&s;equence of proper Means, wi&s;ely and uprightly employed. We have &s;een De&s;igns that have had for their Foundation, the Honour and Dignity of the Crown, and the Rights and Advan|tages of the People, that have been plan|ned
<PB N="12" REF="11">by the greate&s;t Abilities, and executed with equal Talents, &s;ucceed beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine Expectations. But I would not pre|&s;ume too much on the&s;e fortunate Events, the final I&s;&s;ue of which it is not in the Power of human Sagacity to fore&s;ee. All that can be pronounced with Certainty is, that where Wi&s;dom, Integrity, and Re&s;olution are united, they are the mo&s;t likely Means, as far as human Power extends, to obtain Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to think what a Man of this great Character can do. &mdash; He fills every Brea&s;t with his own Spirit &mdash; Men are eager to imitate his Virtues &mdash; They are a&s;hamed not to do their Duty &mdash; They catch the noble Flame &mdash; They carry it into di&s;tant Regions &mdash; The per&s;ua&s;ive, the animating Example excites them to &s;acrifice their Ea&s;e, their For|tunes, their Health, their Lives, in Support of &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o virtuous an Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>I can fairly appeal, not only to every Mem|ber of this great and honourable City, which
<PB N="13" REF="12">is clo&s;ely connected with this renowned Mori$, and happy in the Connection, but to every Man, &mdash; to every di&s;intere&s;ted Man, in the Nation, if his Heart does not glow with a Love and Admiration of the&s;e illu&s;trious Virtues.</P>
<P>But all human Power is Weakne&s;s, all Man's Wi&s;dom Fooli&s;hne&s;s, without the Aid and Guidance of the great Lord of the Univer&s;e: All Knowledge and Experience, all Strength and Courage, every Quality, and every Abi|lity, is weak and vain, unle&s;s He is plea&s;ed to &s;end his Ble&s;&s;ing upon them.</P>
<P>It is not the Sword or the Spear, or the Mul|titude of an Ho&s;t, that can bring Succe&s;s, unle&s;s <HI>the King of Kings, and Governor of all Things, who&s;e Power no Creature is able to re&s;i&s;t,</HI> &s;hall &s;ave and deliver his Servants from the Hands of their Enemies. Yet mu&s;t it be an un&s;peakable Joy, to every great and good Man, and $word$ failing Support in the Duties of his Station, to think that God hath promi&s;ed, in his holy Word, in the Book of eternal Life, to protect
<PB N="14" REF="13">and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who put their Tr$$$ and Con|fidence in him, <HI>who call upon him out of a pure Heart</HI> &mdash; The <HI>Lord upholdeth the Righteous,&mdash; He &s;hall give his Angels Charge over thee &mdash; The Salvation of the Righteous cometh of the Lord, who is al&s;o their Strength in the Day of Trouble. &mdash; Great Pro&s;perity giveth he to his King, to his Anointed, and to his Seed for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then confirm the&s;e divine Truths; let us proclaim the great Mercy and Goodne&s;s of God, in vouch&s;afing &s;uch fignal Succe&s;&s;es to his Maje&s;ty's Arms; and &s;ending his Ble&s;&s;ing on tho&s;e Endeavours which have been u&s;ed for the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of a faithle&s;s and in&s;olent Enemy. Let us in the deepe&s;t Sen&s;e of our own Unworthine&s;s, in a profound Veneration of God's infinite Power, and in the Voice of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, &s;ay, with the hea|venly Ho&s;t; <HI>Salvation, and Honour, and Power, and Glory, be unto him that &s;itteth on the Throne. &mdash; Great and marvellous are thy Works, O Lord God Almighty! Ju&s;t and true are thy Ways, O King of Saints!"</HI></P>
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<P>It would be unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat all the In&s;tances of Succe&s;s with which the divine Providence hath ble&s;&s;ed the Arms and Councels of our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign: But &s;ome &s;triking Particulars mu&s;t not be omitted, tho' it is difficult to &s;ay where we &s;hall begin to &s;peak of the Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven to the&s;e King|doms, or open the Scene of his Maje&s;ty's Glory and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whe$ his Enemies, for a while victorious; threatned utter De&s;truction to his Dominions, and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly flattered them&s;elves with the Certainty of Succe&s;s; the God of Heaven interpo&s;ed, gave a wonderful Pre&s;ence of Mind to the Princely Commander, Firmne&s;s and In|trepidity to the Soldiers, and, by a total Defeat of the Enemy, turned the King's Mourning into Victory: A Victory which will be remembered to the Honour of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Infantry, as long as the Sun endureth; and which, con&s;idered in all its Circum&s;tances, plainly di&s;covered the Hand of Heaven, and proved that <HI>the Lord God of I&s;rael fought for I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<P>But the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven on our Side hath not been confined to one Part of the Globe; His Maje&s;ty's Arms, under the divine Direction, have been victorious in every Quar|ter of the World; the Triumphs on the <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Continent, obtained under the Di&s;ad|vantages of Climate, Situation and di&s;propor|tionate Numbers, are great and a&s;toni&s;hing. Every Man beholds tho&s;e Wonders with Rap|ture and Amazement; though his Joy mu&s;t feel a Check, at the Lo&s;s of that gallant Com|mander who fell in compleating the wonderful Victory.</P>
<P>God hath been plea&s;ed al&s;o, particularly to ble&s;s his Maje&s;ty in the Friend&s;hip of his great and Royal Ally, who by his extraordinary Wi&s;dom, Valour and Experience, by every great, and every amiable Quality, hath pur|cha&s;ed to him&s;elf a Name &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all the Names of Antiquity.</P>
<P>And yet our Happine&s;s doth not even end here. We triumph on the other Element, and
<PB N="17" REF="16">the Seas $ear the En&s;igns of our Glory. And &s;urely it is a Circum&s;tance never to be forgot|ten, that the Number of the Slain in Battle, on our Part, is &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, when compared to the great Variety and Importance of our Conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>Let then the &s;acred Truth bur&s;t from our Lips, in the religious Sentiment of the royal P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>The Lord of Ho&s;ts is with us; The God of Jacob is our Refuge.</HI></P>
<P>The Bounties of Heaven are unlimited &mdash; We have another Ble&s;&s;ing which calls aloud for Acknowledgment and Gratitude.</P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;embled to return our unfeign|ed Thanks to God, for mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onably granting us at this Time, an uncommonly plentiful Harve&s;t. <HI>The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. He turneth the Floods into a Wilderne&s;s, and drieth up the Water Springs. A fruitful Land maketh he barren, for the Wickedne&s;s of them that dwell therein. Again he maketh the Wilderne&s;s a &s;tanding Water, and
<PB N="18" REF="17">Water Springs of a dry Ground.</HI> &mdash; While other Nations have &s;uffered by Scarcity, while their Land has been drenched with Blood, and their Fields have langui&s;hed and mourned; God <HI>hath crowned our Year with Goodne&s;s; our Folds have been full of Sheep; our Vallies have &s;tood &s;o thick with Corn, that they have laughed and &s;ung.</HI></P>
<P>This is an Aera in the Annals of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which Po&s;terity will remember with Admiration and Reverence. They will think us an happy Generation; Surely then we ought to think our&s;elves &s;o. We ought to make &s;uch a religious and moral U&s;e of the marvellous Things which God hath done for us, as may be&s;t expre&s;s our Gratitude to him, and &s;ecure his future Favour: And, in the Height of our Joy and Thank&s;giving, to con|&s;ider that he, who hath given us &s;uch Cau&s;e to rejoice, expects that we &s;hould not &s;uffer <HI>our Pro&s;perity to de&s;troy us,</HI> by being led to think <HI>our Hill &s;o &s;trong that it cannot be removed.</HI></P>
<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P>With our &s;incere and hearty Thanks for the&s;e wonderful and manifold Ble&s;&s;ings, let us add our unfeigned Prayers to the Throne of Grace, and be&s;eech Almighty God to defend and protect the&s;e Kingdoms in their Religion, Liberties, and Commerce, and to give us, in his good Time, a &s;ecure, la&s;ting, and honourable Peace; that he would be plea&s;ed, as the mo&s;t happy Means to &s;o glorious an End, to guard and prolong the Life of our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, and to ble&s;s and pre&s;erve the Royal Family; that when the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Kings, full of Days and Honour, &s;hall change his temporal for an eternal Crown, We may never want a Prince, of his Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, ble&s;&s;ed with all the Virtues of his An|ce&s;tors, to reign over the&s;e Kingdoms, in great Dignity and Pro&s;perity, and to govern a free, dutiful, and united People, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Ju&s;tice and Mercy. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
