<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM SHENSTONE, ESQ</HEAD>
<P>A GREAT part of the poetic works of Mr. SHENSTONE, particularly his Elegies and Pa&s;torals, are (as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it) "The exact tran&s;cripts of the &s;ituation of his own mind;" and abound in frequent allu&s;ions to his own place, the beautiful &s;cene of his retirement from the world. Exclu&s;ively therefore of our natural curio&s;ity to be acquainted with the hi&s;tory of an author, who&s;e works we peru&s;e with plea&s;ure, &s;ome &s;hort account of Mr. SHENSTONE's per&s;onal character, and &s;itu|ation in life, may not only be agreeable, but ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the reader; as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould enter into the true &s;pirit of his writings, if he is entirely ignorant of tho&s;e circum&s;tances of his life, which &s;ometimes &s;o greatly influences his reflection.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h however that this ta&s;k had been al|lotted to &s;ome per&s;on capable of performing it in that ma&s;terly manner which the &s;ubject &s;o well de|&s;erves. To confe&s;s the truth, it was chiefly to pre|vent his remains from falling into the hands of any one &s;till le&s;s qualified to do him ju&s;tice, that I have unwillingly ventured to undertake the publication of them my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. SHENSTONE was the elde&s;t &s;on of a plain uneducated country gentleman in Shrop&s;hire, who farmed his own e&s;tate. The father, &s;en&s;ible of his &s;on's extraordinary capacity, re&s;olved to give him a learned education, and &s;ent him a commoner to Pembroke College in Oxford, de&s;igning him for
<PB N="4" REF="5">
the church: but though he had the mo&s;t awful no|tions of the wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s of God, he never could be per&s;uaded to enter into orders. In his private opinions he adhered to no particular &s;ect, and hated all religious di&s;putes. But what|ever were his own &s;entiments, he always &s;hewed great tenderne&s;s to tho&s;e who differed from him. Tenderne&s;s, indeed, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, was his peculiar characteri&s;tic; his friends, his do|me&s;tics, his poor neighbours, all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind. Indeed, this virtue in him was often carried to &s;uch exce&s;s, that it &s;ome|times bordered upon weakne&s;s: yet if he was con|vinced that any of tho&s;e ranked among&s;t the num|ber of his friends, had treated him ungenerou&s;ly, he was not ea&s;ily reconciled. He u&s;ed a maxim, however, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, which is worthy of being ob&s;erved and imitated; "I never (&s;aid he) will be a revengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my nature, to be half a friend." He was in his temper quite un&s;u&s;picious; but if &s;u&s;picion was once awakened in him, it was not laid a&s;leep again without difficulty.</P>
<P>He was no oeconomi&s;t; the genero&s;ity of his temper prevented him from paying a proper re|gard to the u&s;e of money: he exceeded therefore the bounds of his paternal fortune, which before he died was con&s;iderably encumbered. But when one recollects the perfect paradi&s;e he had rai&s;ed around him, the ho&s;pitality with which he lived, his great indulgence to his &s;ervants, his charities to the in|digent, and all done with an e&s;tate not more than three hundred pounds a year, one &s;hould rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him, than to blame his want of oeconomy. He left how|ever more than &s;ufficient to pay all his debts; and by his will appropriated his whole for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
It was perhaps from &s;ome con&s;iderations on the narrowne&s;s of his fortune, that he forbore to mar|ry; for he was no enemy to wedlock, had a high opinion of many among the fair &s;ex, was fond of their &s;ociety, and no &s;tranger to the tendere&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions. One, which he received in his youth, was with difficulty &s;urmounted. The lady was the &s;ubject of that &s;weet pa&s;toral, in four parts, which has been &s;o univer&s;ally admired; and which, one would have thought, mu&s;t have &s;ubdued the loftie&s;t heart, and &s;oftened the mo&s;t obdurate.</P>
<P>His per&s;on, as to height, was above the middle &s;tature, but largely and rather inelegantly formed: his face &s;eemed plain till you conver&s;ed with him, and then it grew very plea&s;ing. In his dre&s;s he was negligent, even to a fault; though when young, at the univer&s;ity, he was accounted a Beau. He wore his own hair, which was quite grey very early, in a particular manner; not from any affectation of &s;ingularity, but from a maxim he had laid down that without too &s;lavi&s;h a regard to fa&s;hion, every one &s;hould dre&s;s in a manner mo&s;t &s;uitable to his own per&s;on and figure. In &s;hort, his faults were only little blemi&s;hes, thrown in by nature, as it were on purpo&s;e to prevent him from ri&s;ing too much above the level of imperfection allotted to humanity.</P>
<P>His character as a writer will be di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;implicity with elegance, and genius with correct|ne&s;s. He had a &s;ublimity equal to the highe&s;t at|tempts; yet from the indolence of his temper, he cho&s;e rather to amu&s;e him&s;elf $n culling flowers at the foot of the mount, than to take the trouble of climbing the more arduous &s;teeps of Parna&s;&s;us. But whenever he was di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e, his &s;teps, though natural, were noble, and always well &s;up|ported. In the tenderne&s;s of elegiac poetry he hath not been excelled; in the &s;implicity of pa&s;toral, one
<PB N="6" REF="7">
may venture to &s;ay he had very few equals. Of great &s;en&s;ibility him&s;elf, he never failed to engage the hearts of his readers: and amid&s;t the nice&s;t at|tention to the harmony of his numbers, he always took care to expre&s;s with propriety the &s;entiments of an elegant mind. In all his writings, his greate&s;t difficulty was to plea&s;e him&s;elf. <Q>I remember a pa&s;|&s;age in one of his letters, where, &s;peaking of his love &s;ongs, he &s;ays&mdash;&startq;Some were written on oc|ca&s;ions a good deal imaginary, others not &s;o; and the rea&s;on there are &s;o many is, that I wanted to write one good &s;ong, and could never plea&s;e my&s;elf.&endq;</Q> It was this diffidence which occa&s;ioned him to throw a&s;ide many of his pieces before he had be&s;towed upon them his la&s;t touches. I have &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed &s;everal on this account; and if among tho&s;e which I have &s;elected, there &s;hould be di&s;covered &s;ome little want of his fini&s;hing poli&s;h, I hope it will be attributed to this cau&s;e, and of cour&s;e be excu&s;ed: yet I flatter my&s;elf there will always ap|pear &s;omething well worthy of having been pre|&s;erved. And though I was afraid of in&s;erting what might injure the character of my friend, yet as the &s;ketches of a great ma&s;ter are always valuable, I was unwilling the public &s;hould lo&s;e any thing material of &s;o accompli&s;hed a writer. In this di|lemma it will ea&s;ily be conceived that the ta&s;k I had to perform would become &s;omewhat difficult. How I have acquitted my&s;elf, the public mu&s;t judge. Nothing, however, except what he had al|ready publi&s;hed, has been admitted without the ad|vice of his mo&s;t judicious friends, nothing altered, without their particular concurrence. It is impo&s;|&s;ible to plea&s;e every one; but it is hoped that no reader will be &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to imagine that the author wrote &s;olely for his amu&s;ement: his talents were various; and though it may perhaps
<PB N="7" REF="8">
be allowed that his excellence chiefly appeared in &s;ubjects of tenderne&s;s and &s;implicity, yet he fre|quently conde&s;cended to trifle with tho&s;e of humour and drollery: the&s;e, indeed, he him&s;elf in &s;ome mea&s;ure degraded by the title which he gave them of Levites; but had they been entirely rejected, the public would have been deprived of &s;ome Jeux d'e&s;prits, excellent in their kind, and Mr. SHEN|STONE's character as a writer would have been but imperfectly exhibited.</P>
<P>But the talents of Mr. SHENSTONE were not confined merely to poetry; his character, as a man of clear judgement, and deep penetration, will be&s;t appear from his pro&s;e works. It is there we mu&s;t &s;earch for the acutene&s;s of his under&s;tanding, and his profound knowledge of the human heart. It is to be lamented indeed, that &s;ome things here are unfini&s;hed, and can be regarded only as fragments: many are left as &s;ingle thoughts, but which, like the &s;parks of diamonds, &s;hew the richne&s;s of the mine to which they belong; or like the foot of a Hercules, di&s;cover the uncommon &s;trength, and ex|traordinary dimen&s;ions of that hero. I have no apprehen&s;ion of incurring blame from any one, for pre&s;erving the&s;e valuable remains: they will di&s;|cover to every reader, the author's &s;entiments on &s;everal important &s;ubjects. And there can be very few, to whom they will not impart many thoughts, which they would never perhaps have been able to draw from the &s;ource of their own reflections.</P>
<P>But I believe little need be &s;aid to recommend the writings of this gentleman to public attention. His character is already &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed. And if he be not injured by the inability of his editor, but there is no doubt he will ever maintain an eminent &s;tation among the be&s;t of our Engli&s;h writers.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAYS ON MEN AND MANNERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On Publications.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not unamu&s;ing to con&s;ider the &s;everal apologies that people make when they commence authors. It is taken for granted that, on every publication, there is at lea&s;t a &s;eeming violation of mode&s;ty; a pre&s;ump|tion, on the writer's &s;ide, that he is able to in&s;truct or to entertain the world; which implies a &s;uppo&s;ition that he can communicate, what they cannot draw from their own reflections.</P>
<P>To remove any prejudice this might occa&s;ion, has been the general intent of prefaces. Some we find ex|tremely &s;olicitous to claim acquaintance with their reader; addre&s;&s;ing him by the mo&s;t tender and endearing appellations. He is in general &s;tyled the mo&s;t loving, candid, and courteous creature that ever breathed; with a view, doubtle&s;s, that he will de&s;erve the compliment; and that his favour may be &s;ecured at the expence of his better judgement. Mean and idle expectation! The accidental elopements and adventures of a compo&s;ition; the danger of an imperfect and &s;urreptitious publica|tion; the pre&s;&s;ing and indi&s;creet in&s;tances of friends;
<PB N="2" REF="11" MS="Y">
the pious and well-meant frauds of acquaintance; with the irre&s;i&s;tible commands of per&s;ons in high life; have been excu&s;es often &s;ub&s;tituted in place of the real motives, vanity and hunger.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t allowable rea&s;ons for appearing thus in public are, either the advantage or amu&s;ement of our fellow-creatures, or our own private emolument and re|putation.</P>
<P>A man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed off intellectual talents would be more blamable in confining them to his own private u&s;e, than the mean-&s;pirited mi&s;er, that did the &s;ame by his money. The latter is indeed obliged to bid adieu to what he communicates! the former enjoys his trea&s;ures, even while he renders others the better for them. A compo&s;ition that enters the world with a view of im|proving or amu&s;ing it (I mean only, amu&s;ing it in a po|lite or innocent way) has a claim to our utmo&s;t indulg|ence, even though it fail of the effect intended.</P>
<P>When a writer's private intere&s;t appears the motive of his publication, the reader has a larger &s;cope for ac|cu&s;ation, if he be a &s;ufferer. Whoever pays for thoughts, which this kind of writers may be &s;aid to vend, has room enough to complain, if he be di&s;ap|pointed of his bargain. He has no revenge, but ridi|cule; and, contrary to the practice in other ca&s;es, to make the wor&s;t of a bad bargain.</P>
<P>When the love of fame acts upon a man of genius the ca&s;e appears to &s;tand thus. The generality of the world, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of readers, ob&s;erve with a reluctance not unnatural, a per&s;on rai&s;ing him&s;elf above them. All men have &s;ome de&s;ire of fame, and fame is grounded on compari&s;on. Every one then is &s;omewhat inclined to di&s;pute his title to a &s;uperiority; and to di&s;allow his preten&s;ions upon the di&s;covery of a flaw. Indeed, a fine writer, like a luminous body, may be beneficial to the per&s;on he enlightens; but it is plain, he renders the capacity of the other more di&s;cern|ible.&mdash;Examination, however, is a &s;ort of turnpike in the way to fame, where, though a writer be a while detained, and part with a trifle from his pocket, he
<PB N="3" REF="12">
finds in his return a more commodious and ea&s;y road to the temple.</P>
<P>When therefore, a man is con&s;cious of ability to &s;erve his country, or believes him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it (for there is no previous te&s;t on this occa&s;ion) he has no room to he&s;itate, or need to make apology&mdash;When &s;elf-intere&s;t inclines a man to print, he &s;hould con&s;ider that the purcha&s;er expects a penny-worth for his penny; and has rea&s;on to a&s;per&s;e his hone&s;ty if he finds him&s;elf deceived&mdash;Al&s;o, that it is po&s;&s;ible to publi&s;h a book of no value, which is too frequently the product of &s;uch mercenary people.&mdash;When fame is the principal object of our devotion, it &s;hould be con&s;idered whether our character is like to gain in point of wit, what it will probably lo&s;e in point of mode&s;ty: otherwi&s;e, we &s;hall be cen&s;ured of vanity more than famed for genius; and depre&s;s our character while we &s;trive to rai&s;e it.</P>
<P>After all, there is a propen&s;ity in &s;ome to communi|cate their thoughts without any view at all: the more &s;anguine of the&s;e employ the pre&s;s; the le&s;s lively are contented with being impertinent in conver&s;ation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On the Te&s;t of Popular Opinion.</HEAD>
<P>I HAPPEN to fall into company with a citizen, a courtier, and an academic.</P>
<P>Says the citizen, I am told continually of ta&s;te, re|finement and politene&s;s; but methinks the vulgar and illiterate generally approve the &s;ame productions with the connoi&s;&s;eurs. One rarely finds a land&s;cape, a build|ing, or a play, that has charms for the critic exclu&s;ive of the mechanic. But, on the other hand, one readily remarks &s;tudents who labour to be dull, depraving their native reli&s;h by the very means they u&s;e to refine it. The vulgar may not indeed be capable of giving the rea&s;ons why a compo&s;ition plea&s;es them. That mecha|nical di&s;tinction they leave to the connoi&s;&s;eur. But they are at all times, methinks, judges of the beauty of an
<PB N="4" REF="13">
effect, a part of knowledge in mo&s;t re&s;pects allowedly more genteel than that of the operator.</P>
<P>Says the courtier, I cannot an&s;wer for every indivi|dual in&s;tance: but I think, moderately &s;peaking, the vulgar are generally in the wrong. If they happen to be otherwi&s;e, it is principally owing to their implicit re|liance on the &s;kill of their &s;uperiors: and this has &s;ome|times been &s;trangely effectual in making them imagine they reli&s;h perfection. In &s;hort, if ever they judge well, it is at the time they lea&s;t pre&s;ume to frame opinions for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is true they will pretend to ta&s;te an object which they know their betters do. But then they con&s;ider &s;ome per&s;on's judgement as a certain &s;tandard or rule; they find the object exactly tally; and this demon&s;trated appearance of beauty affords them &s;ome &s;mall degree of &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame with regard to the appetite, from which the metaphor of ta&s;te is borrowed. <Q>&startq;Such a &s;oup or olio, &s;ay they, is much in vogue; and if you do not like it, you mu&s;t learn to like it.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>But in poetry, for in&s;tance, it is urged that the vul|gar di&s;cover the &s;ame beauties with the man of reading.</P>
<P>Now half or more of the beauties of poetry depend on metaphor or allu&s;ion, neither of which, by a mind un|cultivated, can be applied to their proper counterparts. Their beauty, of con&s;equence, is like a picture to a blind man.</P>
<P>How many of the&s;e peculiarities in poetry turn upon a knowledge of philo&s;ophy and hi&s;tory: and let me add, the&s;e latent beauties give the mo&s;t delight to &s;uch as can unfold them.</P>
<P>I might launch out much farther in regard to the nar|row limits of their apprehen&s;ions&mdash;What I have &s;aid may exclude their infallibility; and it is my opinion they are &s;eldom right.</P>
<P>The academic &s;poke little, but to the purpo&s;e; a&s;&s;ert|ing that all ranks and &s;tations have their different &s;pheres of judging: that a clown of native ta&s;te enough to reli&s;h Handel's Me&s;&s;iah, might unque&s;tionably be &s;o
<PB N="5" REF="14">
in&s;tructed as to reli&s;h it yet more: that an author, be|fore he prints, &s;hould not flatter him&s;elf with a confu&s;ed expectation of plea&s;ing both the vulgar and the polite; few things, in compari&s;on, being capable of doing both in any great degree: that he &s;hould always mea&s;ure out his plan for the &s;ize of under&s;tanding he would fit. If he can content him&s;elf with the mob, he is pretty &s;ure of numbers for a time. If he write with more abund|ant elegance, it may e&s;cape the organs of &s;uch readers; but he will have a chance for &s;uch applau&s;e as will more &s;en&s;ibly affect him. Let a writer then in his fir&s;t per|formances neglect the idea of profit, and the vulgar's applau&s;e entirely: let him addre&s;s him to the judicious few, and then profit and the mob will follow. His fir&s;t appearance on the &s;tage of letters will engro&s;s the politer compliments; and his latter will partake of the irra|tional huzza.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On allowing Merit in Others.</HEAD>
<P>A CERTAIN gentleman was expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I have no great ta&s;te for poetry; but, if I had, I am apt to believe I &s;hould read no other poetry than that of Mr. Pope. The re&s;t but barely arrive at a mediocrity in their art; and, to be &s;ure, poetry of that &s;tamp can afford but &s;lender plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I know not, &s;ays another, what may be the gentle|man's motive to give this opinion: but I am per&s;uaded, numbers pretend the &s;ame through mere jealou&s;y or envy.</P>
<P>A reader con&s;iders an author, as one who lays claim to a &s;uperior genius. He is ever inclined to di&s;pute it, becau&s;e, if he happen to invalidate his title, he has at lea&s;t one &s;uperior the le&s;s. Now though a man's ab&s;o|lute merit may not depend upon the inferiority of an|other, yet his comparative worth varies in regard to that of other people. Self-love, therefore, is ever attentive to pur&s;ue the &s;ingle point of admitting no more into the
<PB N="6" REF="15">
cla&s;s of &s;uperiors, than it is impo&s;&s;ible to exclude. Could it even limit the number to one, they would &s;oon attempt to undermine him. Even Mr. Pope had been re|fu&s;ed his honours, but that the very con&s;traint, and even ab&s;urdity, of people's &s;hutting their eyes grew as di&s;a|greeable to them, as that excellence, which, when open, they could not but di&s;cover.</P>
<P>But &s;elf-love obtains it's wi&s;hes in another re&s;pect al&s;o. It hereby not only depre&s;&s;es the characters of many that have wrote, but &s;tifles the genius of &s;uch as might hereafter ri&s;e from among&s;t our inferiors.</P>
<P>Let us not deny to Mr. Pope the prai&s;es which a per&s;on enamoured of poetry would be&s;tow on one that excelled in it: but let us con&s;ider Parna&s;&s;us rather as a republic than a monarchy; where, although &s;ome may be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a more cultivated &s;pot, yet others may po&s;&s;e&s;s land as fruitful, upon equal cultiva|tion.</P>
<P>On the whole, let us reflect, that the nature of the &s;oil, and the extent of its fertility, mu&s;t remain undi&s;|covered, if the gentleman's de&s;ponding principle &s;hould meet with approbation.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope's chief excellence lies in what I would term con&s;olidating or conden&s;ing &s;entences, yet pre&s;erving ea&s;e and per&s;pecuity. In &s;moothne&s;s of ver&s;e, perhaps, he has been equalled: in regard to invention, excelled.</P>
<P>Add to this, if the writers of antiquity may be e&s;|teemed our true&s;t models, Mr. Pope is much more witty, and le&s;s &s;imple, than his own Horace appears in any of his writings. More witty, and le&s;s &s;imple, than the modern Mon&s;ieur Boileau, who claimed the merit of uniting the &s;tyle of Juvenal and Per&s;ius with that of Horace.</P>
<P>Satire gratifies &s;elf-love. This was one &s;ource of his popularity; and he &s;eems even &s;o very con&s;cious of it as to &s;tigmatize many inoffen&s;ive characters.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of what is called alliteration and the nice adju&s;tment of the pau&s;e, have con&s;pired t$ charm the pre&s;ent age, but have at the &s;ame time give$ his ver&s;es a very cloying peculiarity.</P>

But, perhaps, we mu&s;t not expect to trace the flow of Waller, the land&s;cape of Thom&s;on, the fire of Dryden, the imagery of Shake&s;pear, the &s;implicity of Spen&s;er, the courtline&s;s of Prior, the humour of Swift, the wit of Cowley, the delicacy of Addi&s;on, the tenderne&s;s of Otway, and the invention, the &s;pirit, and &s;ublimity of Milton, joined in any &s;ingle writer. The lovers of poetry, therefore, &s;hould allow &s;ome prai&s;e to tho&s;e who &s;hine in any branch of it, and only range them into cla&s;&s;es according to that &s;pecies in which they &s;hine.</P>

<HEAD>The Impromptu.</HEAD>
<P>THE critics, however unable to fix the time which it is mo&s;t proper to allow for the action of an epic poem, have univer&s;ally agreed that &s;ome certain &s;pace is not to be exceeded. Concerning this, Ari&s;totle, their great Lycurgus, is entirely &s;ilent. Succeeding critics have done little more than cavil concerning the time really taken up by the greate&s;t epic writers: that, if they could not frame a law, they might at lea&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent of unexceptionable authority. Homer, &s;ay they, confined the action of his Iliad, or rather his ac|tion may be reduced, to the &s;pace of two months. His Ody&s;&s;ey, according to Bo&s;&s;u and Dacier, is extended to eight years. Virgil's Aeneid has rai&s;ed very different opinions in his commentators. Ta&s;&s;o's poem includes a &s;ummer&mdash;But leaving &s;uch knotty points to per&s;ons that appear born for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them, let us endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h laws that are more likely to be obeyed, than controverted. An epic writer, though limited in regard to the time of his action, is under no &s;ort of re&s;traint
<PB N="8" REF="17">
with regard to the time he takes to fini&s;h his poem. Far different is the ca&s;e with a writer of Impromptu's. He indeed is allowed all the liberties that he can po&s;&s;ibly take in his compo&s;ition, but is rigidly circum&s;cribed with re|gard to the &s;pace in which it is completed. And no wonder; for whatever degree of poignancy may be required in this compo&s;ition, it's peculiar merit mu&s;t ever be relative to the expedition with which it is pro|duced.</P>
<P>It appears indeed to me to have the nature of that kind of &s;allad, which certain eminent adepts in chemi&s;|try have contrived to rai&s;e, while a joint of mutton is roa&s;ting. We do not allow our&s;elves to blame it's un|u&s;ual flatne&s;s and in&s;ipidity, but extol the flavour it has, con&s;idering the time of it's vegetation.</P>
<P>An extemporaneous poet, therefore, is to be judged as we judge a race-hor&s;e; not by the gracefulne&s;s of his motion, but the time he takes to fini&s;h his cour&s;e. The be&s;t critic upon earth may err in determining his preci&s;e degree of merit, if he have neither a &s;top-watch in his hand, nor a clock within his hearing.</P>
<P>To be a little more &s;erious. An extemporaneous piece ought to be examined by a compound ratio, or a medium compounded of it's real worth, and the &s;hort|ne&s;s of the time that is employed in it's production. By this rule, even Virgil's poem may be in &s;ome &s;ort deemed extemporaneous, as the time he took to perfect &s;o extraordinary a compo&s;ition, con&s;idered with it's real worth, appears &s;horter than the time employed to write the di&s;tics of Co&s;conius.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I cannot allow this title to the fla&s;hes of my friend S&mdash;in the magazine, which have no &s;ort of claim to be called ver&s;es, be&s;ides their in&s;tantaneity.</P>
<P>Having ever made it my ambition to &s;ee my writings di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;omething poignant, unexpected, or, in &s;ome re&s;pects, peculiar; I have acquired a degree of fame by a firm adherence to the Concetti. I have &s;tung folks with my epigrams, amu&s;ed them with acro&s;tics, puzzled them with rebu&s;&s;es, and di&s;tracted them with
<PB N="9" REF="18">
riddles. It remained only for me to &s;ucceed in the Im|promptu, for which I was utterly di&s;qualified by a whore&s;on &s;lowne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Still de&s;irous, however, of the immortal honour to grow di&s;tingui&s;hed for an extempore; I petitioned Apollo to that purpo&s;e in a dream. His an&s;wer was as follows. <Q>&startq;That whatever piece of wit, either written or verbal, makes any pretence to merit, as of extemporaneous production, &s;hall be &s;aid or written within the time that the author &s;upports him&s;elf on one leg. That Horace had explained his meaning, by the phra&s;e &s;tans pede in uno. And fora&s;much as one man may per&s;evere in the po&s;ture longer than another, he would recommend it to all candidates for this extraordinary accompli&s;hment, that they would habituate them&s;elves to &s;tudy in no other attitude what&s;oever,&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Methought I received his an&s;wer with the utmo&s;t plea|&s;ure as well as veneration; hoping, that, however I was debarred of the acumen requi&s;ite for an extempore, I might learn to weary out my betters in &s;tanding on one leg.</P>

<P>TO form an e&s;timate of the proportion which one man's happine&s;s bears to another's we are to con|&s;ider the mind that is allotted him with as much atten|tion as the circum&s;tances. It were &s;uperfluous to evince that the &s;ame objects which one de&s;pi&s;es, are frequently to another the &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ource of admiration.

<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much, I proceed to give &s;ome account of a character which came within the &s;phere of my own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Not the entrance of a cathedral, not the found of a pa&s;&s;ing bell, not the furs of a magi&s;trate, nor the fa|bles of a funeral, were fraught with half the &s;olemnity of face!</P>
<P>Nay &s;o wonderfully &s;erious was he ob&s;erved to be on all occa&s;ions, that it was found hardly po&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e in his company. He qua&s;hed the loude&s;t tem|pe&s;t of laughter, whenever he entered the room; and men's features, though ever &s;o much roughened, were &s;ure to grow &s;mooth at his approach.</P>
<P>The man had nothing vicious, or even ill-natured in his character; yet he was the dread of all jovial conver|&s;ation; the young, the gay, found their &s;pirits fly be|fore him. Even the kitten and the puppy, as it were by in&s;tinct, would forego their frolics, and be &s;till. The depre&s;&s;ion he occa&s;ioned was like that of a damp, or vitiated air. Uncon&s;cious of any apparent cau&s;e, you found your &s;pirits &s;ink in&s;en&s;ibly: and were any one to &s;it for the picture of ill-luck it is not po&s;&s;ible the painter could &s;elect a more proper per&s;on.</P>
<P>Yet he did not fail to boa&s;t of a &s;uperior &s;hare of rea&s;on, even for the want of that very faculty, ri&s;ibility, with which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be always joined.</P>
<P>Indeed he acquired the character of the mo&s;t ingenious per&s;on of his county, from this meditative temper. Not that he had ever made any great di&s;covery of his talents; but a few oracular declarations, joined with a common opinion that he was writing &s;omewhat for po&s;|terity, completed his reputation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Hermit.</HI> (In the manner of Cambray.)</HEAD>
<P>IT was in that delightful month which Love pre|fers before all others, and which mo&s;t reveres this deity: that month which ever weaves a verdant carpet for the earth, and embroiders it with flowers. The banks became inviting through their coverlets of mo&s;s; the violets, refre&s;hed by the moi&s;ture of de&s;cend|ing rains, enriched the tepid air with their agreeable perfumes. But the &s;hower was pa&s;t; the &s;un di&s;per&s;ed the vapours; and the &s;ky was clear and lucid, when Po|lydore walked forth. He was of a complexion alto|gether plain and unaffected; a lover of the Mu&s;es, and beloved by them. He would oftentimes retire from the noi&s;e of mixed conver&s;ation, to enjoy the melody of birds, or the murmurs of a water-fall. His neighbours often &s;miled at his peculiarity of temper; and he no le&s;s, at the vulgar ca&s;t of theirs. He could never be content to pa&s;s his irrevocable time in an idle comment upon a new&s;paper, or in adju&s;ting the preci&s;e difference of temperature betwixt the weather of to-day and ye&s;|terday.
<PB N="13" REF="22">
In &s;hort he was not void of &s;ome ambition, but what he felt he acknowledged, and was never aver&s;e to vindicate. As he never cen&s;ured any one who indulg|ed their humour inoffen&s;ively, &s;o he claimed no manner of applau&s;e for tho&s;e pur&s;uits which gratified his own. But the &s;entiments he entertained of honour, and the dig|nity conferred by royal authority, made it wonderful how he bore the thoughts of ob&s;curity and oblivion. He mentioned with applau&s;e the youths who by merit had arrived at &s;tation; but he thought that all &s;hould in life's vi&s;it leave &s;ome token of their exi&s;tence; and that their friends might more rea&s;onably expect it from them, than they from their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>There were few, he thought, of talents &s;o very incon|&s;iderable, as to be unalterably excluded from all degrees of fame: and in regard to &s;uch as had a liberal educa|tion, he ever wi&s;hed that in &s;ome art or &s;cience they would be per&s;uaded to engrave their names. He thought it might be &s;ome plea&s;ure to reflect, that their names would at lea&s;t be honoured by their de&s;cendants, al|though they might e&s;cape the notice of &s;uch as were not prejudiced in their favour.</P>
<P>What a lu&s;tre, &s;aid he, does the reputation of a Wren, a Waller, or a Wal&s;ingham, ca&s;t upon their re|mote&s;t progeny? and who would not wi&s;h rather to be de&s;cended from them, than from the mere carca&s;e of no|bility? Yet wherever &s;uperb titles are faithfully offered as the reward of merit, he thought the allurements of ambition were too tran&s;porting to be re&s;i&s;ted. But to return.</P>
<P>Polydore, a new inhabitant in a &s;ort of wild, un|inhabited country, was now a&s;cended to the top of a mountain, and in the full enjoyment of a very exten|&s;ive pro&s;pect. Before him a broad and winding valley, variegated with all the charms of land&s;cape. Fertile meadows, glittering &s;treams, pendent rocks, and nod|ding ruins. But the&s;e indeed were much le&s;s thes ob|jects of his attention, than tho&s;e di&s;tant hills and &s;pire that were almo&s;t concealed by one undi&s;tingui&s;hed azure. The &s;ea, indeed, appeared to clo&s;e the &s;cene, though
<PB N="14" REF="23">
di&s;tant as it was it but little variegated the view. Hardly indeed were it di&s;tingui&s;hable but for the beams of a de&s;cending &s;un, which at the &s;ame time warned our traveller to return, before the du&s;kine&s;s and dews of evening had rendered his walk uncomfortable.</P>
<P>He had now de&s;cended to the foot of the mountain, when he remarked an old hermit approaching to a little hut, which he had formed with his own hands, at the very bottom of the precipice. Polydore, all enamoured of the beauties he had been &s;urveying, could not avoid wondering at his conduct, who, not content with &s;hun|ning all commerce with mankind, had contrived as much as po&s;&s;ible to exclude all views of nature. He acco&s;ted him in the manner following. Father, &s;ays he, it is with no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e, that I ob&s;erve your choice of &s;ituation, by which you &s;eem to neglect the mo&s;t di&s;|tant and delightful land&s;cape that ever my eyes beheld. The hill, beneath which you have contrived to hide your habitation, would have afforded you &s;uch a variety of natural curio&s;ities, as to a per&s;on &s;o contemplative, mu&s;t appear highly entertaining: and as the cell to which you are advancing is &s;eemingly of your own con|trivance, methinks it was probable you would &s;o have placed it, as to pre&s;ent them, in all their beauty, to your eye.</P>
<P>The hermit made him this an&s;wer. My &s;on, &s;ays he, the evening approaches, and you have deviated from your way. I would not therefore detain you by my &s;tory, did I not imagine the moon would prove a &s;afer guide to you, than that &s;etting &s;un which you mu&s;t otherwi&s;e rely upon. Enter therefore for a while into my cave, and I will give you then &s;ome account of my adventures, which will &s;olve you$ doubts perhaps more effectually than any method I can propo&s;e. But before you enter my lone abode, calculated only for the u&s;e of meditation, dare to contemn &s;uperfluous magnificence, and render thy&s;elf worthy of the being I contemplate.</P>
<P>Know then, that I owe what the world is plea&s;ed to call my ruin (and indeed ju&s;tly, were it not for the u&s;e whi$h I have made of it) to an a&s;&s;ured dependence, in a
<PB N="15" REF="24">
literal &s;en&s;e, upon confu&s;ed and di&s;tant pro&s;pects: a con|fideration, which hath indeed &s;o affected me, that I &s;hall never henceforth enjoy a land&s;cape that lies at &s;o re|mote a di&s;tance, as not to exhibit all its parts. And indeed were I to form the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to what your world calls ta&s;te, I might even then perhaps contend that a well-di&s;criminated land&s;cape was at all times to be preferred to a di&s;tant and promi&s;cuous azure.</P>
<P>I was born in the pari&s;h of a nobleman who arrived to the principal management of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the na|tion. The heir of his family and my&s;elf were of the &s;ame age, and for &s;ome time &s;chool fellows. I had made con&s;iderable advances in his e&s;teem; and the mu|tual affection we entertained for each other, did not long remain unob&s;erved by his family or my own. He was &s;ent early upon his travels pur&s;uant to a very inju|dicious cu&s;tom, and my parents were &s;olicited to con|&s;ent that I might accompany him. Intimations were given to my friends, that a per&s;on of &s;uch importance as his father might contribute much more to my immediate promotion, than the utmo&s;t diligence I could u&s;e in pur|&s;uit of it. My father, I remember, a&s;&s;ented with re|luctance: my mother, fired with the ambition of her &s;on's future greatne&s;s, through much importunity, "wr$ng from him his &s;low leave." I, for my own part, wanted no great per&s;ua&s;ion. We made what is called the great tour of Europe. We neither of us, I believe, could be &s;aid to want natural &s;en&s;e; but being bani&s;hed &s;o early in life, were more attentive to every de|viation from our own indifferent cu&s;toms, than to any u&s;eful examination of their polices or manners. Judge|ment, for the mo&s;t part, ripens very &s;lowly. Fancy often expands her blo&s;&s;oms all at once.</P>
<P>We were now returning home from a &s;ix year's ab|&s;ence: anticipating the care&s;&s;es of our parents and rela|tions, when my ever-honoured companion was attacked by a fever. All po&s;&s;ible means of &s;afety proving finally ineffectual, he acco&s;ted me in one of his lucid intervals as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25">
Alas! my Clytander! my life, they tell me, is of very &s;hort continuance. The next paroxy&s;m of my fever will probably be conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of this &s;udden change does not allow me to &s;peak the gratitude I owe thee; much le&s;s to reward the kindne&s;s on which it is &s;o ju&s;tly grounded. Thou knowe&s;t I was &s;ent away yearly from my parents, and the more rational part of my life has been pa&s;&s;ed with thee alone. It cannot be but they will prove &s;olicitous in their enquiries concerning me. Thy narrative will awake their tenderne&s;s, and they cannot but conceive &s;ome for their &s;on's companion and his friend. What I would hope is, that they will render thee &s;ome &s;ervices, in place of tho&s;e their beloved &s;on intended thee, and which I can unfeignedly a&s;&s;ert, would have been only bounded by my power. My dear companion! farewell. All other temporal enjoyments have I bani&s;hed from my heart; but friend&s;hip lingers long, and 'tis with tears I &s;ay farewell.&mdash;</P>
<P>My concern was truly &s;o great, that, upon my arrival in my native country, it was not at all encrea&s;ed by the con&s;ideration that the nobleman, on whom my hopes de|pended, was removed from all his places. I waited on him; and he appeared &s;en&s;ibly grieved that the friend|&s;hip he had ever profe&s;&s;ed could now &s;o little avail me. He recommended me however to a friend of his that was then of the &s;ucce&s;sful party, and who, he was a&s;|&s;ured, would, at his reque&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;t me to the utmo&s;t of his power. I was now in the prime of life, which I ef|fectually con&s;umed upon the empty forms of our court-attendance. Hopes aro&s;e before me like bubbles upon a &s;tream; as quick &s;ucceeding one another, as &s;uperfi|cial and as vain. Thus bu&s;ied in my pur&s;uit, and re|jecting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cool examination, I found the winter of life approaching, and nothing procured to &s;helter or protect me when my &s;econd patron died. A race of new ones appeard before me, and even yet kept my expectations in play. I wi&s;hed indeed I had retreat|ed &s;ooner; but to retire at la&s;t unrecompenced, and
<PB N="17" REF="26">
when a few months attendance might happen to prove &s;ucce&s;sful, was beyond all power of re&s;olution.</P>
<P>However, after a few years more attendance, di&s;tri|buted in equal proportions upon each of the&s;e new pa|trons, I at length obtained a place of much trouble and &s;mall emolument. On the acceptance of this, my eyes &s;eemed open all at once. I had no pa&s;&s;ion remaining for the &s;plendor which was grown familiar to me, and for civi|lity and confinement I entertained an utter aver&s;ion. I officiated however for a few weeks in my po&s;t, wonder|ing &s;till more and more how I could ever covet the life I led. I was ever mo&s;t &s;incere, but &s;incerity cla&s;hed with my &s;ituation every moment of the day. In &s;hort, I returned home to a paternal income, not indeed intend|ing that au&s;tere life in which you at pre&s;ent find me en|gaged. I thought to content my&s;elf with common ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and to give the re&s;t, if aught remained, to cha|rity; determined, however, to avoid all appearance of &s;ingularity. But alas! to my great &s;urprize, the per&s;on who &s;upplied my expences had &s;o far embroiled my lit|tle affairs, that, when my debts, &amp;c. were di&s;charged, I was unable to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in any better manner than I do at pre&s;ent. I grew at fir&s;t entirely melancholy; left the country where I was born, and rai&s;ed the humble roof that covers me in a country where I am not known. I now begin to think my&s;elf happy in my pre&s;ent way of life: I cultivate a few vegetables to &s;upport me; and the little well there, is a very clear one. I am now an u&s;ele&s;s individual; little able to benefit mankind; but $ prey to &s;hame, and to confu&s;ion, on the fir&s;t glance of every eye that knows me. My &s;pirits are indeed &s;omething rai&s;ed by a clear &s;ky, or a meridian &s;un; but as to exten&s;ive views of the country, I think them well enough exchanged for the warmth and comfort which this vale affords me.

<HEAD>On Di&s;tinctions, Orders, and Dignities.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject turned upon the nature of &s;ocieties, ranks, orders, and di&s;tinctions, among&s;t men.</P>
<P>A gentleman of &s;pirit, and of the popular faction, had been long declaiming again&s;t any kind of honours that tended to elevate a body of people into a di&s;tinct &s;pecies from the re&s;t of the nation. Particularly titles and blue ribbands were the object of his indignation. They were, as he pretended, too invidious an o&s;tentation of &s;u|periority, to be allowed in any nation that &s;tiled it&s;elf free. Much was &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of appearances, &s;o far as they were countenanced by law or cu&s;tom. The bi|&s;hop's lawn; the mar&s;hal's truncheon; the baron's robe; and the judge's peruke, were con&s;idered only as nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;titutes, where genuine purity, real cou|rage, native dignity, and &s;uitable penetration, were wanting to complete the characters of tho&s;e to whom they were a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>It was urged that policy had often effectually made it a point to dazzle in order to en&s;lave; and in&s;tances were brought of groundle&s;s di&s;tinctions borne about in the glare of day by certain per&s;ons, who, being &s;tripped of them, would be le&s;s e&s;teemed than the meane&s;t plebeian.</P>
<P>He acknowledged, indeed, that kings, the fountains of all political honour, had hitherto &s;hewn no complai|&s;ance to that &s;ex who&s;e &s;ofter di&s;po&s;itions rendered them more excu&s;ably fond of &s;uch peculiarities.</P>
<P>That, in favour of the ladies, he &s;hould e&s;teem him&s;elf &s;ufficiently happy in the honour of inventing one order, which &s;hould be &s;tyled, The powerful order of beauties.</P>
<P>That their number in Great Britain &s;hould be limit|ed to five thou&s;and; the dignity for ever to be conferred
<PB N="19" REF="28">
by the queen alone, who &s;hould be &s;tyled &s;overeign of the order, and the re&s;t the companions.</P>
<P>That the in&s;talment &s;hould be rendered a thou&s;and times more ceremonious, the dre&s;&s;es more &s;uperb, and the plumes more enormous, than tho&s;e already in u&s;e among&s;t the companions of the garter.</P>
<P>That the di&s;tingui&s;hing badge of this order &s;hould be an artificial no&s;egay, to be worn on the left brea&s;t; con|&s;i&s;ting of a lily and a ro&s;e, the proper emblems of com|plexion, and intermixed with a branch of myrtle, the tree &s;acred to Venus.</P>
<P>That in&s;tead of their &s;hields being affixed to the &s;talls appointed for this order, there &s;hould be a gallery erect|ed to receive their pictures at full length. Their por|traits to be taken by four painters of the greate&s;t emi|nence, and he who&s;e painting was preferred, to be &s;tyled A knight of the ro&s;e and lily.</P>
<P>That when any per&s;on addre&s;&s;ed a letter to a lady of this order, the &s;tyle &s;hould always be To the Right beau|tiful Mi&s;s or Lady &s;uch-a-one.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed for &s;ome time undetermined whether they &s;hould forfeit their title upon marriage; but at length, for many rea&s;ons, propo&s;ed it &s;hould be continued to them.</P>
<P>And thus far the gentleman proceeded in his ha|rangue; when it was objected that the queen, unle&s;s &s;he unaccountably cho&s;e to mark out game for her hu&s;band, could take no &s;ort of plea&s;ure in conferring this honour where it was mo&s;t due: That as ladies grew in years, this epithet of beautiful would burle&s;que them; and, in &s;hort, con&s;idering the frailty of beauty, there was no la&s;ting compliment that could be be&s;towed upon it.</P>
<P>At this the orator &s;miled; and acknowledged it was true: But a&s;ked at the &s;ame time, why it was more ab|&s;urd to &s;tyle a lady right beautiful, in the days of her de|formity, than to term a peer right honourable when he grew a &s;candal to mankind?</P>
<P>That this was &s;ome times the ca&s;e, he &s;aid, was not to be di&s;puted; becau&s;e titles have been &s;ometimes granted to a worthle&s;s &s;on, in con&s;equence of a father's enormous
<PB N="20" REF="29">
wealth mo&s;t unju&s;tly acquired. And few had ever &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in villainy the right honourable the earl of A&mdash;.</P>
<P>The company was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ophi&s;try of our declaimant. However, it was replied to, by a per|&s;on pre&s;ent, that Lord&mdash;'s title being fictitious, no one ought to in&s;tance him to the di&s;advantage of the p&mdash;rage, who had, &s;trictly &s;peaking, never been of that number.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On the &s;ame Subject.</HEAD>
<P>THE declaiment, I before mentioned, continued his harangue. There are, &s;aid he, certain epithets which &s;o frequently occur, that they are the le&s;s con&s;idered; and which are &s;eldom or never examined, on account of the many opportunities of examination that pre&s;ent them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Of this kind is the word Gentleman. This word, on it's fir&s;t introduction, was given, I &s;uppo&s;e, to freemen, in oppo&s;ition to va&s;&s;als; the&s;e being the two cla&s;&s;es into which the nation was once divided <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the author is not writing a treati&s;e on the feudal law, but a moral e&s;&s;ay; any little inaccuracies, it is to be hoped, will be over-looked by tho&s;e, who, from &s;everal late trei|ti&s;es on this &s;ubject, might expect great exactne&s;s and preci|&s;ion in a &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point.</NOTE>. The freeman was he, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of land, and could therefore &s;ub&s;i&s;t without manual labour; the va&s;&s;al, he who tenant|ed the land, and was obliged to his thane for the nece&s;|&s;aries of life. The different manners, we may pre&s;ume, that &s;prung from their different &s;ituations and con|nexions, occa&s;ioned the one to be denominated a civilized or gentle per&s;onage; and the other to obtain the name of a mere ru&s;tic or villain.</P>
<P>But upon the publication of cru&s;ades, the &s;tate of things was con&s;iderably altered: It was then that every
<PB N="21" REF="30">
freeman di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;hield which he wore with &s;ome painted emblem or device; and this, in order that his fellow-combatants might attribute to him his pro|per applau&s;e, which, upon account of &s;imilar accoutre|ments, might be otherwi&s;e &s;ubject to mi&s;application.</P>
<P>Upon this there aro&s;e a di&s;tinction betwixt freeman and freeman. All who had &s;erved in tho&s;e religious wars continued the u&s;e of their fir&s;t devices, but all de|vices were not illu&s;trated by the &s;ame preten&s;ions to mi|litary glory.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e campaigns were di&s;continued: fre&s;h families &s;prung up; who, without any pretence to mark them&s;elves with &s;uch devices as the&s;e holy combatants, were yet as de&s;irous of re&s;pect, of e&s;timation, of di&s;tinc|tion. It would be tedious enough to trace the &s;teps by which money e&s;tabli&s;hes even ab&s;urdity. A court of heraldry &s;prung up, to &s;upply the place of cru&s;ade ex|ploits, to grant imaginary &s;hields and trophies to fami|lies that never wore real armour, and it is but of late that it has been di&s;covered to have no real juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Yet cu&s;tom is not at once overthrown; and he is even now deemed a gentleman who has arms recorded in the Herald's office, and at the &s;ame time follows none, except a liberal employment.</P>
<P>Allowing this di&s;tinction, it is obvious to all who con&s;ider, that a churli&s;h, moro&s;e, illiterate clown; a lazy, beggarly, &s;harping vagabond; a &s;tupid, $ubberly, inactive &s;ot, or pick-pocket, nay even an highwayman, may be neverthele&s;s a gentleman as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. In &s;hort, that the definition may, together with others include al&s;o the filth, the &s;cum, and the dregs of the cre|ation.</P>
<P>But do we not appear to di&s;allow this account, when we &s;ay, "&s;uch or &s;uch an action was not done in a gen|tleman-like manner," "&s;uch u&s;age was not the beha|viour of a gentleman," and &s;o forth. We &s;eem thus to in&s;muate that the appellation of gentleman regards morals as well as family; and that integrity, politene&s;s, genero&s;ity, and affability, have the true&s;t claim to a di&s;|tinction of this kind. Whence then &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="31">
was derived this contradiction? Shall we &s;ay that the plebeians, having the virtues on their &s;ide, by degrees re|moved this appellation from the ba&s;is of family to that of merit; which they e&s;teemed, and not unju&s;tly, to be the true and proper pede&s;tal? This the gentry will &s;carce allow. Shall we then in&s;i&s;t that every thing great and god-like was heretofore the atchievement of the gen|try? But this, perhaps, will not obtain the approbation of the commoners.</P>
<P>To reconcile the difference, let us &s;uppo&s;e the denomi|nation may belong equally to two &s;orts of men. The one, what may be &s;tyled a gentleman de jure, viz. a man of genero&s;ity, politene&s;s, learning, ta&s;te, genius, or affa|bility; in &s;hort, accompli&s;hed in all that is &s;plendid, or endeared to us by all that is amiable, on the one &s;ide: and on the other, a gentleman de facto, or what, to Engli&s;h readers, I would term a gentleman as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>As to the latter appellation, what is really e&s;&s;ential, or, as logicians would &s;ay, "quarto modo proprium," is a real, or at lea&s;t a &s;pecious claim to the inheritance of certain coat-armour from a &s;econd or more di&s;tant ance&s;tor; and this un&s;tained by any mechanical or illi|beral employment.</P>
<P>We may di&s;cover, on this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, that, how|ever material a difference this di&s;tinction &s;uppo&s;es, yet it is not wholly impracticable for a gentleman de jure to render him&s;elf in &s;ome &s;ort a gentleman de facto. A certain &s;um of money, depo&s;ited in the hands of my good friends Norroy or Rougedragon, will convey to him a coat of arms de&s;cending from as many ance&s;tors as he plea&s;es. On the other hand, the gentleman de facto may become a gentleman al&s;o de jure, by the ac|qui&s;ition of certain virtues, which are rarely all of them unattainable. The latter, I mu&s;t acknowledge, is the more difficult talk; at lea&s;t we may daily di&s;cover crowds acquire &s;ufficient wealth to buy gentility, but very few that po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues which ennoble human nature, and (in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word) con&s;titute a gentleman.</P>

<HEAD>A Character.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;HE was a youth &s;o amply furni&s;hed, with every ex|cellence of mind, that he &s;eemed alike capable of acquiring or di&s;regarding the goods of fortune. He had indeed all the learning and erudition that can be derived from univer&s;ities, without the pedantry and ill manners which are too often their attendants. What few or none acquire by the mo&s;t inten&s;e a&s;&s;iduity, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by nature; I mean, that elegance of ta&s;te, which di&s;|po&s;ed him to admire beauty under it's great variety of appearances. It pa&s;&s;ed not unob&s;erved by him either in the cut of a &s;leeve, or the integrity of a moral action. The proportion of a &s;tatue, the convenience of an edifice, the movement in a dance, and the complexion of a cheek or flower, afforded him &s;en&s;ations of beauty; that beauty which inferior geniu&s;es are taught coldly to di&s;|tingui&s;h; or to di&s;cern rather than feel. He could trace the excellencies both of the courtier and the &s;tudent; who are matually ridiculous in the eyes of each other. He had nothing in his character that could ob&s;cure &s;o great accompli&s;hments, be&s;ide the want, the total want, of a de&s;ire to exhibit them. Through this it came to pa&s;s, that what would have rai&s;ed another to the heights of reputation, was oftentimes in him pa&s;&s;ed over unre|garded. For, in re&s;pect to ordinary ob&s;ervers, it is re|qui&s;ite to lay &s;ome &s;tre&s;s your&s;elf, on what you intend &s;hould be remarked by others; and this never was his way. His knowledge of books had in &s;ome degree di|mini&s;hed his knowledge of the world; or, rather, the external forms and manners of it. His ordinary con|ver&s;ation was, perhaps, rather too pregnant with &s;enti|ment, the u&s;ual fault of rigid &s;tudents; and this he would in &s;ome degree have regulated better, did not the univer&s;ality of his genius, together with the method of his education, &s;o largely contribute to this amiable de|fect. This kind of awkwardne&s;s (&s;ince his mode&s;ty will allow it no better name) may be compared to the &s;tiffne&s;s of a fine piece of brocade, who&s;e turge&s;cency indeed
<PB N="24" REF="33">
con&s;titutes, and is in&s;eparable from, its value. He gave delight by an happy boldne&s;s in the extirpation of common prejudices; which he could as readily pene|trate, as he could humourou&s;ly ridicule: and he had &s;uch entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hearts as well as under&s;tand|ings of his friends, that he could &s;oon make the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing paradoxes believed and well-accepted. His image, like that of a &s;overeign, could give an addi|tional value to the mo&s;t precious ore; and we no &s;ooner believed our eyes that it was he who &s;pake it, than we as readily believed whatever he had to &s;ay. In this he differed from W&mdash;r, that he had the talents of ren|dering the greate&s;t virtues un-envied: whereas the latter &s;hone more remarkably in making his very faults agree|able: I mean in regard to tho&s;e few he had to exerci&s;e his &s;kill.</P>

<HEAD>On Re&s;erve.&mdash;A Fragment.</HEAD>
<P>TAKING an evening's walk with a friend in the country, among many grave remarks, he was making the following ob&s;ervation. There is not, &s;ays he, any one quality &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with re&s;pect, as what is commonly called familiarity. You do not find one in fifty, who&s;e regard is proof again&s;t it. At the &s;ame time, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch a deference as will render you ridiculous, if it be &s;upported by com|mon &s;en&s;e. Thus much at lea&s;t is evident, that your demands will be &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, as to procure a greater &s;hare than if you had made no &s;uch demand. I may frankly own to you, Leander, that I frequently derived unea&s;ine&s;s, from a familiarity with &s;uch per&s;ons as de|&s;pi&s;ed every thing they could obtain with ea&s;e. Were it not better, therefore, to be &s;omewhat frugal of our af|fability, at lea&s;t to allot it only to the &s;ew per&s;ons of
<PB N="25" REF="34">
di&s;cernment who can make the proper di&s;tinction be|twixt real dignity and pretended: to neglect tho&s;e characters, which, being impatient to grow familiar, are at the &s;ame time very far from familiarity-proof: to have po&s;thumous fame in view, which affords us the mo&s;t plea&s;ing land&s;cape: to enjoy the amu&s;ement of reading, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that reading paves the way to general e&s;teem: to pre&s;erve a con&s;tant regularity of temper, and al&s;o of con&s;titution, for the mo&s;t part but little con&s;i&s;tent with a promi&s;cuous intercour&s;e with men: to &s;hun all illiterate, though ever &s;o jovial a&s;&s;emblies, in|&s;ipid, perhaps, when pre&s;ent, and upon reflection painful: to meditate on tho&s;e ab&s;ent or departed friends, who value or valued us for tho&s;e qualities with which they were be&s;t acquainted: to partake with &s;uch a friend as you, the delights of a &s;tudious and rational retirement&mdash;Are not the&s;e the paths that lead to happine&s;s?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this (for he &s;eemed to feel &s;ome late mor|tification) I ob&s;erved, that what we lo&s;t by familiarity in re&s;pect, was generally made up to us by the affection it procured; and that an ab&s;olute &s;olitude was &s;o very contrary to our natures, that were he excluded from &s;o|ciety but for a &s;ingle fortnight, he would be exhilarated at the &s;ight of the fir&s;t beggar that he &s;aw.</P>
<P>What follows were thoughts thrown out in our fur|ther di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ubject; without order or con|nexion, as they occur to my remembrance.</P>
<P>Some re&s;erve is a debt to prudence; as freedom and &s;implicity of conver&s;ation is a debt to good-nature.</P>
<P>There would not be any ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for re&s;erve, if the world were hone&s;t: yet, even then, it would prove expedient. For, in order to attain any degree of defe|rence, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that people &s;hould imagine you have more accompli&s;hments than you di&s;cover.</P>
<P>It is on this depends one of the excellencies of the judicious Virgil. He leaves you &s;omething ever to ima|gine: and &s;uch is the con&s;titution of the human mind, that we think &s;o highly of nothing, as of that whereof we do not &s;ee the bounds. This, as Mr. Burke ingeni|ou&s;ly
<PB N="26" REF="35">

<P>A per&s;on that would &s;ecure to him&s;elf great deference, will, perhaps, gain his point by &s;ilence, as effectually as by any thing he can &s;ay.</P>
<P>To be, however, a niggard of one's ob&s;ervation, is &s;o much wor&s;e than to hoard up one's money, as the former may be both imparted and retained at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Men oftentimes pretend to proportion their re&s;pect to real de&s;ert; but a &s;upercilious re&s;erve and di&s;tance wea|ries them into a compliance with more. This appears &s;o very manife&s;t to many per&s;ons of the lofty character, that they u&s;e no better means to acquire re&s;pect than like highwaymen to make a demand of it. They will, like Empedocles, jump into the the fire, rather than betray the mortal part of their character.</P>

<HEAD>On external Figure.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a young gentleman in my pari&s;h, who, on account of his &s;uperior equipage, is e&s;teemed univer&s;ally more proud and more haughty than his neigh|bours. It is frequently hinted, that he is by no means intitled to &s;o &s;plendid an appearance, either by his birth, his &s;tation, or his fortune; and that it is of con&s;equence mere pride that urges him to live beyond his rank, or renders him blind to the knowledge of it. With all this fondne&s;s for external &s;plendor, he is a mo&s;t affable and ingenious man; and for this rea&s;on I am inclined to vindicate him, when the&s;e things are mentioned to his di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is by no means clear, that dre&s;s and equipage are &s;ure &s;igns of pride. Where it is joined with a &s;upercilious behaviour, it becomes then a corro|borative te&s;timony. But this is not always the ca&s;e: the refinements of luxury in equipage, or a table, are per|haps as often the gratifications of fancy, as the con&s;e|quence of an ambition to &s;urpa&s;s and ec$ip&s;e our equals. Whoever thinks that ta&s;te has nothing to do here, mu&s;t confine the expre&s;&s;ion to improper limits; a&s;&s;uredly ima|gination may find its account in them, wholly inde|pendent of worldly homage and con&s;iderations more invi|dious.</P>
<P>In the warmth of friend&s;hip for this gentleman, I am &s;ometimes prompted to go further. I in&s;i&s;t, it is not birth or fortune only that give a per&s;on claim to a &s;plen|did appearance; that it may be conferred by other quali|fications, in which my friend is acknowledged to have a &s;hare.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometime urged that remarkable ingenuity, any great degree of merit in learning, arts or &s;ciences, are a more rea&s;onable authority for a &s;plendid appearance than tho&s;e which are commonly pre&s;umed to be &s;o. That there is &s;omething more per&s;onal in this kind of advan|tages than in rank or fortune, will not be denied: and &s;urely there ought to be &s;ome proportion ob&s;erved be|twixt
<PB N="30" REF="39">
the ca&s;e and the thing enclo&s;ed. The propen&s;ity of rich and worthle&s;s people to appear with a &s;plendor upon all occa&s;ions, puts one in mind of the country &s;hopkeeper, who gilds his boxes in order to be the re|ceptacle of pitch or tobacco. It is not unlike the ma|nagement at our theatres royal, where you &s;ee a piece of candle honoured with a crown.</P>
<P>I have generally con&s;idered tho&s;e as privileged people, who are able to &s;upport the character they a&s;&s;ume. Tho&s;e who are incapable of &s;hining but by dre&s;s, would do well to con&s;ider that the contra&s;t betwixt them and their cloaths turns out much to their di&s;advantage. It is on this account I have &s;ometimes ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure &s;ome noblemen of immen&s;e fortune to dre&s;s ex|ceeding plain.</P>
<P>If dre&s;s be only allowable to per&s;ons of family, it may then be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of family-livery, and Jack the groom may, with equal ju&s;tice, pride him&s;elf upon the gaudy wardrobe his ma&s;ter gives him. Nay more&mdash;for a gentleman, before he hires a &s;ervant, will require &s;ome te&s;timony of his merit; whereas the ma&s;ter challenges his own right to &s;plendor, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no merit at all.</P>
<P>Upon my pre&s;ent &s;cheme of dre&s;s, it may &s;eem to an|&s;wer &s;ome very good purpo&s;es. It is then e&s;tabli&s;hed on the &s;ame foundation, as the judge's robe and the pre|late's lawn. If dre&s;s were only authori&s;ed in men of ingenuity, we &s;hould find many aiming at the previous merit, in hopes of the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;tinction. The finery of an empty fellow would render him as ridiculous as a &s;tar and garter would one never knighted: and men would u&s;e as commendable a diligence to qualify them|&s;elves for a brocaded wai&s;tcoat, or a gold &s;nuff-box, as they now do to procure them&s;elves a right of inve&s;ting their limbs in lawn or ermine. We &s;hould not e&s;teem a man a coxcomb for his dre&s;s, till, by frequent con|ver&s;ation, we di&s;covered a flaw in his title. If he was incapable of uttering a bon mot, the gold upon his coat would &s;eem foreign to his circum&s;tances. A man &s;hould not wear a French dre&s;s, till he could give an
<PB N="31" REF="40">
account of the be&s;t French authors; and &s;hould be ver&s;ed in all the oriental languages before he &s;hould pre|&s;ume to wear a diamond.</P>
<P>It may be urged, that men of the greate&s;t merit may not be able to &s;hew it in their dre&s;s, on account of their &s;lender income. But here it &s;hould be con&s;idered that an|other part of the world would find their equipage &s;o much reduced by a &s;umptuary law of this nature, that a very moderate degree of &s;plendor would di&s;tingui&s;h them more than a greater does at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>What I propo&s;e, however, upon the whole is, that men of merit &s;hould be allowed to dre&s;s in proportion to it; but this with the privilege of appearing plain, whenever they found an expediency in &s;o doing: as a nobleman lays a&s;ide his garter, when he &s;ees no valuable con&s;equence in the di&s;covery of his quality.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Character.</HI> "Animae nil magnae laudis egentes."</HEAD>
<P>THERE is an order of per&s;ons in the world, who&s;e thoughts never deviate from the common road; whatever events occur, whatever objects pre&s;ent them|&s;elves, their ob&s;ervations are as uniform as though they were the con&s;equence of in&s;tinct. There is nothing places the&s;e men in a more in&s;ignificant point of light, than a compari&s;on of their ideas with the refinements of &s;ome great genius. I &s;hall only add, by way of reflec|tion, that it is people of this &s;tamp, who, together with the founde&s;t health, often enjoy the greate&s;t equanimity: their pa&s;&s;ions, like dull &s;teeds, being the lea&s;t apt to en|danger or mi&s;guide them: yet &s;uch is the fatality! Men of genius are often expected to act with mo&s;t di&s;|cretion, on account of that very fancy which is their greate&s;t impediment.</P>
<P>I was taking a view of We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, with an old gentleman of exceeding hone&s;ty, but the &s;ame degree of under&s;tanding as that I have de&s;cribed.</P>

There had nothing pa&s;&s;ed in our way thither, be&s;ide the cu&s;tomary &s;alutations, and an endeavour to decide with accuracy upon the pre&s;ent temperature of the wea|ther. On pa&s;&s;ing over the thre&s;hold, he ob&s;erved with an air of thoughtfulne&s;s, that it was a brave ancient place.</P>
<P>I told him, I thought there was none more &s;uitable, to moralize upon the futility of all earthly glory, as there was none which contained the a&s;hes of men that had acquired a greater &s;hare of it. On this he gave a nod of approbation, but did not &s;eem to comprehend me.</P>
<P>Silence en&s;ued for many minutes; when having had time to reflect upon the monuments of men famous in their generations, he &s;tood collected in him&s;elf; <Q>a&s;&s;uring me &startq;there was no &s;ort of excellence could exempt a man from death.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I applauded the ju&s;tice of his ob&s;ervation; and &s;aid, it was not only my pre&s;ent opinion, but had been &s;o for a number of years. <Q>"Right," &s;ays he, &startq;and for my own part I &s;eldom love to publi&s;h my remarks upon a &s;ubject, till I have had them confirmed to me by a long cour&s;e of experience.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t maxim, &s;omewhat beyond his u&s;ual depth, occa&s;ioned a &s;ilence of &s;ome few minutes. The &s;pring had been too much bent to recover immediately it's wonted vigour. We had taken &s;ome few turns, up and down the left hand ayle, when he caught &s;ight of a mo|nument &s;omewhat larger than the re&s;t, and more calcu|lated to make impre&s;&s;ion upon an ordinary imagination. As I remember, it was rai&s;ed to an ance&s;tor of the D. of Newca&s;tle. <Q>"Well," &s;ays he, with an air of cun|ning," &startq;this is indeed a fine piece of workman&s;hip; but I cannot conceive this finery is of any &s;ignifica|tion to the per&s;on buried there.&endq;</Q> I told him, I thought not; and that, under a notion of re&s;pect to the decea&s;ed, people were frequently impo&s;ed upon by their own pride and affectation.</P>
<P>We were now arrived at the monument of Sir George Chamberlain; where my friend had ju&s;t peru&s;ed enough
<PB N="33" REF="42">
to inform him that he was an eminent phy&s;ician, when he broke out with precipitation, and as though &s;ome important di&s;covery had &s;truck his fancy on a &s;udden. I li&s;tened to him with attention, till I found him la|bouring to in&s;inuate that phy&s;icians them&s;elves could not &s;ave their lives when their time was come.</P>
<P>He had not proceeded many &s;teps from it before he beckoned to our Ciceroni. <Q>"Friend," &s;ays he; pointing with his cane, &startq;how long has that gentleman been dead?&endq;</Q> <Q>The man &s;et him right in that particular; after which putting on a woeful countenance, "Well," &s;ays he, &startq;to behold how fa&s;t time flies away!

<P>This old gentleman, as I have &s;ince heard, pa&s;&s;ed his life chiefly in the country; where it faintly participated either of plea&s;ure or of pain. His chief delights indeed were &s;en&s;ual, but tho&s;e of the le&s;s vigorous kind; an afternoon's pipe, an evening walk, or a nap after din|ner. His death, which happened, it &s;eems, quickly after, was occa&s;ioned by an uniform application to Bo&s;tock's cordial, whatever his ca&s;e required. Indeed his di&s;cour&s;e, when any complained of &s;ickne&s;s, was a little exuberant in the prai&s;es of this noble cathartic. But his di&s;temper proving of a nature to which this re|medy was wholly foreign, as well as this precluding the u&s;e of a more effectual recipe, he expired, not with|out the character of a mo&s;t con&s;iderate per&s;on. I find, by one part of his will, he obliged his heir to con&s;ume a certain quantity of ale among his neighbours, on the day he was born; and by another, left a ring of bells to the church adjoining to his garden. It looks as if the old gentleman had not only an aver&s;ion to much re|flection in him&s;elf, but endeavoured to provide again&s;t it in &s;ucceeding generations.</P>

<HEAD>An Opinion of Gho&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarkable how much the belief of gho&s;ts and apparitions of per&s;ons departed, has lo&s;t ground within the&s;e fifty years. This may perhaps be explain|ed by the general growth of knowledge; and by the con&s;equent decay of &s;uper&s;tition, even in tho&s;e king|doms where it is mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially interwoven with reli|gion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame credulity, which di&s;po&s;ed the mind to be|lieve the miracles of a popi&s;h &s;aint, &s;et a&s;ide at once the interpo&s;ition of rea&s;on; and produced a fondne&s;s for the marvellous, which it was the prie&s;t's advantage to pro|mote.</P>
<P>It may be natural enough to &s;uppo&s;e that a belief of this kind might &s;pread in the days of popi&s;h infatua|tion. A belief, as much &s;upported by ignorance, as the gho&s;ts them&s;elves were indebted to the night.</P>
<P>But whence comes it, that narratives of this kind have at any time been given, by per&s;ons of veracity, of judgement, and of learning? men neither liable to be deceived them&s;elves, nor to be &s;u&s;pected of an inclina|tion to deceive others, though it were their intere&s;t; nor who could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any intere&s;t in it, even though it were their inclination?</P>
<P>Here &s;eems a further explanation wanting than what can be drawn from &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>I go upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the relations them&s;elves were fal&s;e. For as to the arguments &s;ometimes u&s;ed in this ca&s;e, that had there been no true &s;hilling there had been no counterfeit, it &s;eems wholly a piece of &s;o|phi&s;try. The true &s;hilling here &s;hould mean the living per&s;on; and the counterfeit re&s;emblance, the po&s;thu|mous figure of him, that either &s;trikes our &s;en&s;es or our imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="44">
Suppo&s;ing no gho&s;t then ever appeared, is it a con&s;e|quence that no man could ever imagine that they &s;aw the figure of a per&s;on decea&s;ed? Surely tho&s;e, who &s;ay this, little know the force, the caprice, or the defects, of the imagination.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons after a debauch of liquor, or under the in|fluence of terror, or in the deliria of a fever, or in a fit of lunacy, or even walking in their &s;leep, have had their brain as deeply impre&s;&s;ed with chimerical repre&s;ent|ations as they could po&s;&s;ibly have been, had their repre|&s;entations &s;truck their &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>I have mentioned but a few in&s;tances, wherein the brain is primarily affected. Others may be given, per|haps not quite &s;o common, where the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions, either acute or chronical, have impre&s;&s;ed their object upon the brain; and this in &s;o lively a manner, as to leave the vi&s;ionary no room to doubt of their real pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>How difficult then mu&s;t it be to undeceive a per&s;on as to objects thus imprinted? imprinted ab&s;olutely with the &s;ame force as their eyes them&s;elves could have pour|trayed them! and how many per&s;ons mu&s;t there needs be, who could never be undeceived at all!</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e cau&s;es might not improbably have given ri&s;e to the notion of apparitions: and when the notion had been once promulgated, it had a natural ten|dency to produce more in&s;tances.</P>
<P>The gloom of night, that was productive of terror, would be naturally productive of apparitions. The event confirmed it.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of grief for a departed friend, of horror for a murdered enemy, of remor&s;e for a wronged te&s;tator, of love for a mi&s;tre&s;s killed by incon&s;tancy, of gratitude to a wife of long fidelity, of de&s;ire to be reconciled to one who died at variance, of impatience to vindicate what was fal&s;ely con&s;trued, of propen&s;ity to con&s;ult with an advi&s;er that is lo&s;t.&mdash;The more faint as well as the more powerful pa&s;&s;ions, when bearing relation to a per|&s;on decea&s;ed, have often, I fancy, with concurrent cir|cum&s;tances, been &s;ufficient to exhibit the dead to the living.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="45">
But, what is more, there &s;eems no other account that is adequate to the ca&s;e as I have &s;tated it. Allow this, and you have at once a rea&s;on, why the mo&s;t upright may have publi&s;hed a fal&s;ehood, and the mo&s;t judicious confirmed an ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then that apparitions of this kind may have &s;ome real u&s;e in God's moral government: is not any moral purpo&s;e, for which they may be employed, as effectually an&s;wered on my &s;uppo&s;ition, as the other? for &s;urely it cannot be of any importance, by what means the brain receives the&s;e images. The effect, the conviction, and the re&s;olution con&s;equent, may be ju&s;t the &s;ame in either of the ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Such appears, to me at lea&s;t, to be the true exi&s;tence of apparitions.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons again&s;t any external apparition, among others that may be brought, are the&s;e that follow.</P>
<P>They are, I think, never &s;een by day; and darkne&s;s being the &s;ea&s;on of terror and uncertainty, and the ima|gination le&s;s re&s;trained, they are never vi&s;ible to more than one per&s;on: which had more probably been the ca&s;e, were not the vi&s;ion internal.</P>
<P>They have not been reported to have appeared the&s;e twenty years. What cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned, were their exi&s;tence real, for &s;o great a change as their di&s;con|tinuance?</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of &s;uper&s;tition has lo&s;t ground for this la&s;t century: the notion of gho&s;ts has been, together ex|ploded: a rea&s;on why the imagination &s;hould be le&s;s prone to conceive them; but not a rea&s;on why they them&s;elves &s;hould cea&s;e.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who relate that the&s;e &s;pectres have ap|peared to them, have been per&s;ons either deeply &s;uper&s;ti|tious in other re&s;pects; of enthu&s;ia&s;tic imaginations, or &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, which are the con&s;equence; or el&s;e have allowedly felt &s;ome perturbation at the time.</P>
<P>Some few in&s;tances may be &s;uppo&s;ed, where the caprice of imagination, &s;o very remarkable in dreams, may have pre&s;ented fanta&s;ms to tho&s;e that waked. I believe there are few but can recollect &s;ome, wherein it has
<PB N="37" REF="46">
wrought mi&s;takes, at lea&s;t equal to that of a white hor&s;e for a winding-&s;heet.</P>
<P>To conclude. As my hypothe&s;is &s;uppo&s;es the chimera to give terror equal to the reality, our be&s;t means of avoiding it, is to keep a &s;trict guard over our pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;To avoid intemperance, as we would a charnel-hou&s;e; and by making frequent appeals to cool rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, &s;ecure to our&s;elves the property of a well-regulated imagination.</P>

<HEAD>On Cards.&mdash;A Fragment.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;WE had pa&s;&s;ed our evening with &s;ome certain per&s;ons famous for their ta&s;te, their learn|ing, and refinement: But, as ill-luck would have it, two fellows, duller than the re&s;t, had contrived to put them|&s;elves upon a level, by introducing a game at cards.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ign, &s;aid he, the world is far gone in ab&s;urdity, or &s;urely the fa&s;hion of cards would be accounted no &s;mall one. Is it not &s;urpri&s;ing that men of &s;en&s;e &s;hould &s;ub|mit to join in this idle cu&s;tom, which appears original|ly invented to &s;upply its deficiency? But &s;uch is the fa|tality! imperfections give ri&s;e to fa&s;hions! and are followed by tho&s;e who do not labour under the defects that introduced them. Nor is the hoop the only in&s;tance of a fa&s;hion invented by tho&s;e who found their account in it; and afterwards countenanced by others to who&s;e figure it was prejudicial.</P>
<P>How can men, who value them&s;elves upon their re|flections, give encouragement to a practice, which puts an end to thinking?</P>
<P>I intimated the old allu&s;ion of the bow, that requires fre&s;h vigour by a temporary relaxation.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, this might be applicable, provided I could &s;hew, that cards did not require the pain of think|ing; and merely exclude from it, the profit and the plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Cards, if one may gue&s;s from their fir&s;t appearance,
<PB N="38" REF="47">
&s;eem invented for the u&s;e of children; and, among the toys peculiar to infancy, the bells, the whi&s;tle, the rat|tle, and the hobby-hor&s;e, de&s;erved their &s;hare of com|mendation. By degrees men, who came neare&s;t to chil|dren in under&s;tanding and want of ideas, grew ena|moured of the u&s;e of them as a &s;uitable entertainment. Others al&s;o, plea&s;ed to reflect on the innocent part of their lives, had recour&s;e to this amu&s;ement, as what recalled it to their minds. A knot of villains encrea&s;ed the party; who, regardle&s;s of that entertainment, which the former &s;eemed to draw from cards, con&s;idered them in a more &s;erious light, and made u&s;e of them as a more decent &s;ub&s;titute to robbing on the road, or picking pockets. But men who propo&s;e to them&s;elves a dignity of character, where will you find their inducement to this kind of game? For difficult indeed were it to determine, whether it appear more odious among &s;harpers, or more empty and ridiculous among per&s;ons of character.</P>
<P>Perhaps, replied I, your men of wit and fancy may favour this diver&s;ion, as giving occa&s;ion for the crop of je&s;t and wittici&s;m, which naturally enough ari&s;es from the names and circum&s;tances of the cards.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he would allow this as a proper motive, in ca&s;e the men of wit and humour would accept the ex|cu&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;ays he, as per&s;ons of ability are capable of furni&s;hing out a much more agreeable entertain|ment; when a gentleman offers me cards, I &s;hall e&s;teem it as his private opinion that I have neither &s;en&s;e nor fancy.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked how much he had lo&s;t&mdash;His an&s;wer was, he did not much regard ten pieces; but that it hurt him to have &s;quandered them away on cards; and that to the lo&s;s of conver&s;ation, for which he would have given twenty.</P>

<HEAD>On Hypocri&s;y.</HEAD>
<P>WERE hypocrites to pretend to no uncommon &s;anctity, their want of merit would be le&s;s di&s;|coverable. But pretentions of this nature bring their characters upon the carpet. Tho&s;e who endeavour to pa&s;s for the lights of the world mu&s;t expect to attract the eyes of it. A &s;mall blemi&s;h is more ea&s;ily di&s;cover|able in them, and more ju&s;tly ridiculous, than a much greater in their neighbours.

Her virtues were indeed &s;uch as &s;he thought mo&s;t convenient to her circum&s;tances. Her fa&s;ts were the effect of avarice, and her devotions of the &s;pleen. She con&s;idered the cheapne&s;s of hou&s;e-keeping as the great reward of piety, and added profu&s;ene&s;s to the &s;even deadly &s;ins. She knew fack-cloth to be cheaper than brocade, and a&s;hes than &s;weet powder.</P>
<P>Her heart &s;ympathized with every cup that was broken, and &s;he in&s;tituted a fa&s;t for each dome&s;tic mi&s;|fortune. She had converted her larder into a &s;tudy, and the greater part of her library con&s;i&s;ted of manuals for fa&s;ting-days. By the&s;e arts, and this way of life, &s;he &s;eemed to enjoy as great a freedom from inordinate de|&s;ir$s, as the per&s;ons might be &s;uppo&s;ed to do, who were favoured with her &s;miles or her conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>To this lady was Clelia admitted; and after the year of probation a&s;&s;umed the veil.</P>
<P>Among many others who had &s;olicited her notice, before &s;he became a member of this convent, was Lean|der, a young phy&s;ician of great l$arning and ingenuity. His per&s;onal accompli&s;hments were at lea&s;t equal to tho&s;e of any of his rivals, and his pa&s;&s;ion was &s;uperior. He urged in his behalf all that wit, in&s;pired by fondne&s;s, and recommended by per&s;on, dre&s;s, and equipage, could in&s;inuate; but in vain. She grew angry at the &s;olici|tations with which &s;he re&s;olved never to to comply, and which &s;he found &s;o difficult to evade.</P>
<P>But Clelia now had a&s;&s;umed the veil, and Leander was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of mortals. He had not &s;o high an opinion of his fair one's &s;anctity and zeal, as &s;ome
<PB N="41" REF="50">
other of her admirers: But he had a conviction of her beauty, and that altogether irre&s;i&s;tible. His extrava|gant pa&s;&s;ion had produced in him a jealou&s;y that was not ea&s;ily eluded,</P>
<Q><L>"At regina dolos&mdash;</L>
<L>"Quid non &s;entit amor?"</L></Q>
<P>He had ob&s;erved his mi&s;tre&s;s go more frequently to her confe&s;&s;or, a young and blooming eccle&s;ia&s;tic, than was, perhaps, nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o much apparent pu|rity, or, as he thought, con&s;i&s;tent with it. It was enough to put a lover on the rack, and it had this ef|fect upon Leander. His &s;u&s;picions were by no means le&s;&s;ened, when he found the convent to which Clelia had given the preference before all others, was one where this young friar &s;upplied a confe&s;&s;ional chair.</P>
<P>It happened that Leander was brought to the abbe&s;s in the capacity of a phy&s;ician, and he had one more opportunity offered him of beholding Clelia through the grate.</P>
<P>She, quite &s;hocked at his appearance, bur&s;t out into a &s;udden rage, inveighing bitterly again&s;t his pre&s;ump|tion, and calling loudly on the name of the ble&s;&s;ed vir|gin and the holy friar. The convent was, in &s;hort, alarmed; nor was Clelia capable of being pacified till the good man was called, in order to allay, by &s;uitable applications, the emotions rai&s;ed by this unexpected interview.</P>
<P>Leander grew daily more convinced, that it was not only verbal communications which pa&s;&s;ed between Clelia and the friar. This, however, he did not think him|&s;elf fully warranted to di&s;clo&s;e, till an accident of a &s;in|gular nature, gave him an opportunity of receiving more ample te&s;timony.</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;or had a favourite &s;paniel, which he had lo&s;t for &s;ome time, and was informed at length that he was killed, at a village in the neighbourhood, being evidently mad. The friar was at fir&s;t not much con|cerned; but in a little time recollected that the dog had
<PB N="42" REF="51">
&s;napped his fingers the very day before his elopement. A phy&s;ician's advice was thought expedient on the occa&s;ion, and Leander was the next phy&s;ician. He told him with great frankne&s;s, that no pre&s;cription he could write, had the &s;anction of &s;o much experience as immer&s;ion in &s;ea-water. The friar, therefore, the next day, &s;et for|ward upon his journey, while Leander, not without a mi&s;chievous kind of &s;atisfaction, conveys the following lines to Clelia.</P>
<P>"My charming Clelia,</P>
<P><Q>&startq;THOUGH I yet love you to di&s;traction, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect that you have granted favours to your confe&s;&s;or, which you might, with greater inno|cence, have granted to Leander. All I have to add is this, that amorous intercour&s;es of this nature, which you have enjoyed with Friar Laurence, put you under the like nece&s;&s;ity with him of &s;eeking a&endq; remedy in the ocean.</Q></P>
<P>"Adieu! LEANDER!"</P>
<P>Imagine Clelia guilty; and then imagine her confu|&s;ion. To rail was in&s;ignificant, and to blame her phy|&s;ician was ab&s;u$d, when &s;he found her&s;elf under a nece&s;|&s;ity of pur&s;uing his advice. The whole &s;ociety was made acquainted with the journey &s;he was undertaking, and the cau&s;es of it. It were uncharitable to &s;uppo&s;e the whole community under the &s;ame con&s;traint with the unhappy Clelia. However, the greater part thought it decent to attend her. Some went as her companions, &s;ome for exerci&s;e, &s;ome for amu&s;ement, and the abbe&s;s her&s;elf as guardian of her train, and concerned in her &s;ociety's misfortunes.</P>
<P>What u&s;e Leander made of his di&s;covery is not known. Perhaps, when he had been &s;ucce&s;sful in bani&s;hing the hypocrite, he did not &s;hew him&s;elf very &s;olicitous in his endeavours to reform the &s;inner.</P>

<HEAD>On Vanity.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY pre&s;erves the memory of empires and of &s;tates, with which it nece&s;&s;arily interweaves that o$ heroes, kings, and &s;tate&s;men. Biography affords a pl$ce to the remarkable characters of private men. There are likewi&s;e other &s;ubordinate te&s;timonies, which &s;erve to perpetuate, at lea&s;t prolong, the memories of men, who&s;e characters and &s;tations give them no claim to a place in &s;tory. For in&s;tance, when a per&s;on fails of making that figure in the world which he makes in the eyes of his own relations or him&s;elf, he is rarely digni|fied any farther than with his picture whil&s;t he is living, or with an in&s;cription upon his monument after his de|cea&s;e. In&s;criptions have been &s;o fallacious, that we be|gin to expect little from them b$&s;ide elegance of &s;tyle. To inveigh again&s;t the writers, for their manife&s;t want of truth, were as ab&s;urd as to cen&s;ure Homer for the the beauties of an imaginary character.&mdash;But even paintings, in order to grati&s;y the vanity of the per&s;on who be&s;peaks them, are taught, now-a-days, to flatter like epitaphs.</P>
<P>Fal&s;ehoods upon a tomb or monument may be intitled to &s;ome excu&s;e in the affection, the gratitude, and piety, of &s;urviving friends. Even grief it&s;elf di&s;po&s;es us to magnify the virtues of a relation, as vi&s;ible objects al&s;o appear larger through tears. But the man who through an idle vanity &s;u&s;ters his features to be belied or ex|changed for others of a more agreeable make, may with great truth be &s;aid to lo&s;e his property in the portrait. In like manner, if he encourage the painter to belie his dre&s;s, $. &s;eems to transfer his claim to the man with who&s;e &s;tation his a&s;&s;umed trappings are connected.</P>
<P>I remember a bag-piper, who&s;e phy&s;iognomy was &s;o remarkable and familiar to a club he attended, that it was agreed to have his picture placed over their chimney-piece. There was this remarkable in the fellow, that he cho&s;e always to go barefoot, though he was daily of|fered a pair of &s;hoes. However, when the painter had
<PB N="44" REF="53">
been &s;o exact as to omit this little piece of dre&s;s, the fellow offered all he had in the world, the whole produce of three night's harmony, to have tho&s;e feet covered in the effigy, which he &s;o much &s;corned to cover in the ori|ginal. Perhaps he thought it a di&s;grace to his in&s;trument to be e$ernized in the hands of &s;o much apparent poverty. However, when a per&s;on of low &s;tation adorns him&s;elf with trophies to which he has no preten&s;ions to a&s;pire, he &s;hould con&s;ider the picture as actually telling a lie to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The ab&s;urdity of this is evident, if a per&s;on a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf a mitre, a blue garter, or a coronet, impro|perly; but &s;tation may be fal&s;ified by other decorations, as well as the&s;e.</P>
<P>But I am driven into this grave di&s;cour&s;e, on a &s;ubject perhaps not very important, by a real fit of &s;pleen. I this morning &s;aw a fellow drawn in a night-gown of &s;o rich a &s;tuff, that the expence, had he purcha&s;ed &s;uch a one, would more than half have ruined him; and ano|ther coxcomb, &s;eated by his painter in a velvet chair, who would have been &s;urpri&s;ed at the deference paid him, had he been offered a cu&s;hion.</P>

<P>IT is a very convenient piece of knowledge for a per|&s;on upon a journey, to know the compellations with which it is proper to addre&s;s tho&s;e he happens to meet by his way. Some accuracy here may be of u&s;e to him who would be well directed either in the length or the tenden|cy of his road; or be freed from any itinerary difficul|ties incident to tho&s;e who do not know the country. It may not be indeed imprudent to acco&s;t a pa&s;&s;enger with a title &s;uperior to what he may appear to claim. This will &s;eldom fail to diffu&s;e a wonderful alacrity in his
<PB N="45" REF="54">
countenance; and be, perhaps, a method of &s;ecuring you from any mi&s;take of greater importance.</P>
<P>I was led into the&s;e ob&s;ervations by &s;ome &s;olicitudes I lately underwent, on account of my ignorance in the&s;e peculiarities. Being &s;omewhat more ver&s;ed in books than I can pretend to be in the orders of men, it was my fortune to undertake a journey, which I was to perform by means of enquiries. I had pa&s;&s;ed a number of miles without any &s;ort of difficulty, by help of the manifold in&s;tructions that had been given me on my &s;etting out. At length, being &s;omething dubious concerning my way, I met a per&s;on, whom, from his night-cap and &s;everal dome&s;tic parts of dre&s;s, I deemed to be of the neighbourhood. His &s;tation of life appeared to me, to be what we call a gentleman-farmer; a &s;ort of &s;ubaltern character, in re&s;pect of which the world &s;eems not inva|riably determined. It is in &s;hort what King Charles the Second e&s;teemed the happie&s;t of all &s;tations; &s;uperior to the toil&s;ome ta&s;k and ridiculous dignity of con&s;table; and as much inferior to the intricate practice and invi|dious deci&s;ions of a ju&s;tice of peace. <Q>"Hone&s;t man," &s;ays I, &startq;be &s;o good as to inform me whether I am in the way to Mirlington?&endq;</Q> He replied, with a &s;ort of &s;urline&s;s, that he knew nothing of the matter; and turned away with as much di&s;gu&s;t, as though I had called him rogue or ra&s;cal.</P>
<P>I did not readily penetrate the cau&s;e of his di&s;plea&s;ure, but proceeded on my way, with hopes to find other means of information. The next I met was a young fellow, dre&s;&s;ed in all the pride of rural &s;prucene&s;s; and be&s;ide him, walked a gi$l in a dre&s;s agreeable to that of her companion. As I pre&s;umed him by no means aver&s;e to appear con&s;iderable in the eyes of his mi&s;tre&s;s, I &s;up|po&s;ed a compliment might not be di&s;agreeable; and en|quiring the road to Mirlington, addre&s;&s;ed him by the name of "Hone&s;ty." The fellow, whether to &s;hew his wit before his mi&s;tre&s;s, or whether he was di&s;plea&s;ed with my familiarity, I cannot tell, directed me to follow a part of my face (which I was well a&s;&s;ured could be no
<PB N="46" REF="55">
guide to me, and that other parts would follow of con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>The next I met, appeared, by his look and gait, to &s;tand high in his own opinion. I therefore judged the be&s;t way of proceeding was to adapt my phra&s;e to his own ideas, and &s;aluting him by the name of "Sir," de|&s;ired to obtain &s;ome in&s;ight into my road. My gentleman, without he&s;itation, gave me ample in&s;tructions for the re&s;t of my journey.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed on, mu&s;ing with my&s;elf, why an appellation relative to fortune &s;hould be preferred to one founded on merit; when I happened to behold a gentleman examin|ing a &s;un-dial in his garden. <Q>&startq;Friend," &s;ays I, will you tell me what a clock it is?&endq;</Q> He made me no &s;ort of an&s;wer, and &s;eemed as much di&s;&s;atisfied with my openne&s;s of temper, as with the confidence I placed in his.&mdash;The refu&s;al of an an&s;wer in this ca&s;e was not of much importance. I proceeded on my way, and hap|pened to meet a very old woman, whom I determined to acco&s;t by the appellation of "Dame;" and withal wi&s;hed her a good night.</P>
<P>But, alas! &s;he &s;eemed &s;o little plea&s;ed with the man|ner of my addre&s;s, that &s;he returned me no manner of thanks for my kind wi&s;hes as to her repo&s;e. It is not clear whether my phra&s;e was faulty, in regard to her dignity, or in re&s;pect of her age. But it is very proba|ble &s;he might conclude it an impropriety in re&s;pect of both.</P>
<P>I had by this time found the inconvenience of an ut|ter ignorance in rural di&s;tinctions. The future part of my journey afforded me yet farther means of conviction. I was expo&s;ed to the danger of three quick&s;ands, by calling a girl "&s;weetheart," in&s;tead of "madam;" and was within a foot of ru&s;hing down a precipice, by calling another, "For&s;ooth," who might ea&s;ily have told me how to avoid it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I found my&s;elf well or ill u&s;ed, as I hap|pened, or not, to &s;uit my &s;alutations to people's ideas of their own rank. Towards the la&s;t part of my &s;tage, I was to pa&s;s a brook, &s;o much &s;welled by land-floods,
<PB N="47" REF="56">
that the proper way through it was undi&s;tingui&s;hable. A well-dre&s;&s;ed gentleman was pa&s;&s;ing a bridge on my left hand. It was here of much importance for me to &s;uc|ceed in my enquiry. I was, therefore, meditating within my&s;elf which might be the mo&s;t endearing of all appellations; and at la&s;t be&s;ought him to give me &s;ome in&s;tructions, under the name of "Hone&s;t Friend." He was not &s;eemingly &s;o much plea&s;ed as I a&s;&s;ured my|&s;elf he would be, and trudged onward without reply. After this, I had not gone many &s;teps (out of the path, for &s;o it proved) before I found my&s;elf and hor&s;e plunged headlong in the brook; and my late hone&s;t friend in a laughter at our downfall.</P>
<P>I made a &s;hift, however, to recover both my&s;elf and hor&s;e; and, after a few more difficulties, arrived at the end of my journey. I have &s;ince made &s;trict enquiry into the due application of &s;uch inferior titles, and may, perhaps, communicate them to you, on &s;ome future occa&s;ion. In the mean time, you may, if you plea&s;e, con&s;ider the va&s;t importance of &s;uperior titles, when there is no one &s;o incon&s;iderable but there is al&s;o a mind that it can influence.</P>
<P>When your reflect upon this &s;ubject, you will, per|haps, be le&s;s &s;evere on your friend&mdash;, who, you tell me, is now trafficing for this &s;pecies of dignity.</P>
<P>Learn to be wi&s;e then from others harm; and do not forget to ob&s;erve decorum, on every occa&s;ion that you may have to addre&s;s him for the future. Pretend no more at the clo&s;e of your epi&s;tle to be his faithful &s;er|vant, much le&s;s his affectionate one. Tender your &s;er|vices with great re&s;pect, if you do not choo&s;e to do it with profound veneration. He will certainly have no more to do with &s;incerity and truth. Remember,</P>

<HEAD>On Mode&s;ty and Impudence.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a man of genius does not print, he di&s;co|vers him&s;elf by nothing more than by his abi|lities
<PB N="48" REF="57">
in di&s;pute. However let him &s;hew &s;olidity in his opinions, together with ea&s;e, elegance, and vivacity in his expre&s;&s;ions; yet if an impudent face be found to baffle him, he &s;hall be judged inferior in other re&s;pects. I mean, he will grow cheap in mixed company: for as to &s;elect judges, they will form their opinions by ano|ther &s;cale: with the&s;e, a &s;ingle epi&s;tle, penned with pro|priety, will more effectually prove his wit, than an hun|dred defects in his conver&s;ation will demon&s;trate the re|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true, there is nothing di&s;plays a genius, I mean a quickne&s;s of genius, more than a di&s;pute; as two diamonds, encountering, contribute to each other's lu&s;|tre. But perhaps the odds is much again&s;t the man of ta&s;te in this particular.</P>
<P>Ba&s;hfulne&s;s is more frequently connected with good &s;en&s;e, than we find a&s;&s;urance: and impudence, on the other hand, is often the mere effect of downright &s;tu|pidity. On this account the man of genius has as much the advantage of his antagoni&s;t, as a race-hor&s;e, carry|ing a &s;mall weight, has over his rival that bears a larger: mode&s;ty, like the weight to which I allude, not &s;uffer|ing its owner to exert its real &s;trength; which effrontery is allowed to do, without let or impediment.</P>
<P>It may be urged, and ju&s;tly enough, that it is com|mon to be partial to the mode&s;t man; and that diffidence makes good amends for any re&s;traint it lays us under, by the prejudice it gives every hearer in our favour. But indeed this can only happen, where it meets with the mo&s;t ingenuous judges. Otherwi&s;e a laugh will carry the day, with which the ignorant &s;ide is generally be&s;t accommodated.</P>
<P>In order to put the&s;e antagoni&s;ts upon a &s;omewhat more equal footing, I have invented the following in|&s;trument; for the &s;ole &s;tructure and &s;ale of which, I am not without hopes of procuring a patent. What I mean, is an artificial laugher. There are few &s;o little conver&s;ant in toys, but mu&s;t have &s;een in&s;truments me|chanically framed to counter&s;eit the voices of different
<PB N="49" REF="58">
birds. The quail-pipe is brought to &s;uch perfection as even to delude the very &s;pecies. The cuckow has been mimicked with no le&s;s accuracy. Would it not then be an ea&s;y matter to repre&s;ent the laugh of this empty tribe, which has in it&s;elf &s;omething artificial; and is not more affected than it is particular? For the convenience of the per&s;on that bears it, its dimen&s;ions &s;hould be &s;o contrived as that it might be played on in his pocket. Does it not &s;eem &s;ea&s;ible, that a laughter of this kind may be brought to an&s;wer every purpo&s;e of that noi&s;e which it re&s;embles? If there be occa&s;ion for an expletive, let the owner &s;eek it in his fob; as his antagoni&s;t would find his account in a loud oath or an empty pun. If there be need of a good &s;ounding cadence at the clo&s;e of a common period, it may not be ami&s;s to harmonize a a &s;entence by what may be called a fini&s;hing &s;troke. This in&s;trument is &s;o contrived as to produce all the va|riety of an human laugh; and this variation is to be regulated, not by the nature of your &s;ubject, nor the wit or humour of a repartee, but by the di&s;po&s;ition of the company, and the proper minute for &s;uch an inter|tude. But to become a ma&s;ter of the &s;aid machine, let the candidate for applau&s;e frequent the company of vo|ciferous di&s;putants; among whom he may &s;oon learn how to perform a conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>One or two of the&s;e in&s;truments I have already fini&s;hed, though not indeed to the perfection at which I expect they may &s;oon arrive. A gentleman vi&s;ited me the other day, who has the ju&s;te&s;t claim that can be, to the u&s;e of them; having nothing in his character than can ob|&s;cure the greate&s;t merit, but the greate&s;t mode&s;ty. I communicated my invention, de&s;iring him to make trial of it, on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion. He did &s;o; and when I &s;aw him next, gave me leave to publi&s;h the following account of its efficacy in my next adverti&s;ement. The fir&s;t time I employed it, &s;aid my friend, was in a $ort of controver&s;y with a beau; who had contrived means, by the u&s;e of his &s;nuff-box, to &s;upply both want of language and of thought. In this manner he prolonged his argument; and really to the company,
<PB N="50" REF="59">
which con&s;i&s;ted of ladies, di&s;covered more &s;agacity with|out thinking, than I could do by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I be|thought my&s;elf immediately of your in&s;trument, and had recour&s;e to it. I ob&s;erved in what part of his di&s;|coure he mo&s;t employed his fingers, and had &s;uddenly recour&s;e to mine, with equal empha&s;is and &s;ignificancy. The art was not di&s;covered, ere I had routed my antago|ni&s;t; having &s;eated my&s;elf in a dark corner, where my operations were not di&s;cernible. I ob&s;erved, that as he found him&s;elf more clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, he grew more and more a&s;&s;iduous in his application to his &s;nuff-box, much as an otter clo&s;ely pur&s;ued is forced to throw up bubbles that &s;how his di&s;tre&s;s. I therefore di&s;covered gradually le&s;s and le&s;s occa&s;ion for &s;peaking; and for thinking, none at all. I played only a flouri&s;h in an&s;wer to the ar|gument at his finger's ends; and after a while found him as mortal in this part as in any other. When his cau&s;e was ju&s;t expiring, after a very long pur&s;uit, and many fruitle&s;s turnings and eva&s;ions in the cour&s;e of it, I &s;ounded my in&s;trument, with as much alacrity as a hunt&s;man does his horn on the death of an hare.</P>
<P>The next whom I engaged was a more formidable di&s;putant; and I own, with a &s;en&s;e of gratitude, that your in&s;trument alone could render me a match for him. His &s;trength of argument was h$s &s;trength of lungs; and he was, unque&s;tionably, an able antagoni&s;t. How|ever, if your machine put me upon a par with him, I think I may &s;ay without vanity, that in point of rea|&s;on, I had the upper hand. I &s;hal only add that as it was habitual for him to an&s;wer arguments by vocifera|tion, &s;o it became needle&s;s for me to give him any an|&s;wer of a better kind.</P>
<P>Thus far my friend: I do not que&s;tion but there will appear arti&s;ts, that &s;hall undertake to in&s;truct the diffi|dent, the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and the ba&s;hful, how to perform the whole gamut of oratorical and ri&s;ible mu&s;ic: and as there is a kind of humourous $aughter, which draws all others into its own vortex, I need not here a&s;&s;ert that I would have this branch very much inculcated.</P>
<P>Neither is this in&s;trument of importance in di&s;pute

alone, or controver&s;y; but wherever one man's faculties are more prone to laughter than another's. Trifles will bur&s;t one man's &s;ides, which will not di&s;turb the features of another; and a laugh one cannot join, is almo&s;t as irk&s;ome as a lamentation. It is like a peal rung after a wedding; where a whole pari&s;h &s;hall be &s;tunned with noi&s;e, becau&s;e they want that occa&s;ion to rejoice, which the per&s;ons at lea&s;t imagine to be their lot, that occa|&s;ioned it. The &s;ounds are plea&s;ing to their ears, who find them conformable to their own ideas; but tho&s;e who are not in temper, or unconcerned, find them a &s;tu|pifying repetition.</P>
<P>When therefore my mind is not in tune with another's, what &s;trikes his, will not vibrate on mine. All I then have to do, is to counterfeit a laugh; which is an ope|ration as artificial, as the machine I have been de|&s;cribing.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of Don Pedro ****.</HEAD>
<P>THE actions of our lives, even tho&s;e we call mo&s;t important, &s;eem as much &s;ubject to trifles, as our very lives them&s;elves. We frame many notable projects in imagination, and promi&s;e to our&s;elves an equal term of life. It is however in the power of the minute&s;t ac|cident, to &s;horten the one, and di&s;concert the other. It is with mankind as with certain fire-engines, who&s;e motion may be &s;topped in the mid&s;t of its rapidity, by the interpo&s;ition of &s;traw in a particular part of them.</P>
<P>The following tran&s;lation from the original Spani&s;h, will &s;ufficiently illu&s;trate the foregoing a&s;&s;ertion. Don Pedro **** was one of the principal grandees of his age and country. He had a genius equal to his birth, and a di&s;po&s;ition remarkably contemplative. It was his cu&s;|tom, on this account, to retire from the world at &s;tated periods, and to indulge him&s;elf in all the mazes of a fine imagination. It happened as he one day &s;afe in his &s;tudy, that he fixed his eye on a neighbouring &s;pi|der. The mo&s;t trivial object (if any natural object can
<PB N="52" REF="61">
be termed &s;o) &s;erved him frequently for the foundation of &s;ome moral and &s;ublime reflection. He &s;urveyed the creature attentively, and indulged the bias of his thought, till he was lo&s;t in the excur&s;ions of a profound reverie. The curious workman&s;hip of this unregarded animal brought at once into his mind the whole art of fortifica|tion. He ob&s;erved the deficiency of human &s;kill, and that no cunning could have contrived her &s;o proper an habitation. He found that no violence could affect the extremities of her lines, but what was immediately perceptible, and liable to alarm her at the centre. He ob&s;erved the road by which &s;he &s;allied forth, &s;erved to convey intelligence from without, at the &s;ame time that it added &s;trength and &s;tability to the work within. He was at once &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed with an object which, although common, he hap|pened not to have beheld in the &s;ame light, or with the &s;ame attention. From this in&s;tant he bent his thoughts upon the advancement of military fortification: and he often would declare it was this trivial incident, that gave him a reli&s;h for that &s;tudy, which he afterwards pur&s;ued with &s;uch application and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;pent in &s;hort &s;o much time upon the attainment of this &s;cience, that he grew as capable of executing any part of it, as &s;peculation alone could render him. Nothing wanted now, but practice to complete the fame of his abilities. That in &s;hort was his next pur&s;uit. He became de&s;irous of experiencing, what had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in imagination. and to make tho&s;e mural &s;al|lies, which had been attended there with victory. To this end he had little to do, but excite the ambition of his young monarch; to enforce, by te&s;timony of his friends, his qualifications for the po&s;t he fought; and, on the fir&s;t delivery of his petition, to obtain prefer|ment from the king.</P>
<P>This happened to be a time of the profounde&s;t tran|quillity: little agreeable to a per&s;on eager of glory, fur|ni&s;hed with &s;kill, and con&s;cious of abilities. Such was this ingenious nobleman. He well knew the ambition of princes, and of his monarch in particular. But he was not acquainted with his own. That imperious and &s;ubtle pa&s;&s;ion is often mo&s;t predominate when it is lea&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="62">
perceived. When it once prevails in any great degree, we and our rea&s;on grow &s;ub&s;ervient, and, in&s;tead of checking or contradicting, it &s;toops to flatter and to au|thorize it. In&s;tead of undeceiving, &s;he confirms us in our error; and even levels the mounds, and &s;mooths the ob&s;tructions, which it is her natural province to inter|po&s;e. This was the ca&s;e of Don Pedro. The delicacy of his ta&s;te encrea&s;ed his &s;en&s;ibility; and his &s;en&s;ibility made him more a &s;lave. The mind of man, like the finer parts of matter, the more delicate it is, naturally admits the more deep and the more vi&s;ible impre&s;&s;ions. The pure&s;t &s;pirits are the &s;oone&s;t apt to take flame. Let us therefore be the more candid to him, on account of the vivacity of his pa&s;&s;ions, &s;educed, as indeed he was, into very unwarrantable &s;chemes.</P>
<P>He had in brief conceived a project, to give his ma&s;|ter an univer&s;al monarchy. He had calculated every ar|ticle with the utmo&s;t labour and preci&s;ion, and intended within a few days, to pre&s;ent his project to the king.</P>
<P>Spain was then in a &s;tate of affluence; had a large army on foot; together with means and opportunities of rai&s;ing an immen&s;e one. It were impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer for the po&s;&s;ible events, that might de&s;troy their hopes of &s;uch an enterprize. Difficulty often attends the execu|tion of things the mo&s;t fea&s;ible and well contrived in theory. But whoever was acquainted with the author of this project, knew the po&s;ture of affairs in Europe at that time, the ambition of the prince, and the many circum&s;tances that con&s;pired to favour it, might have thought the project would have been agreed to, put in practice, and, without &s;ome particular interpo&s;ition of fortune, been attended with &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;But &s;ortune did not put her&s;elf to any particular trouble about the matter.</P>
<P>Don Pedro, big with va&s;t de&s;igns, was one day walk|ing in his fields. He was promi&s;ed next morning an audience of the king. He was preparing him&s;elf for a conver&s;ation, which might prove of &s;o much con&s;e|quence to all mankind; when walking thoughtfully along, and regardle&s;s of his path, his foot happened to
<PB N="54" REF="63">
&s;tumble and to overturn an ant's ne&s;t. He ca&s;t his eyes upon the ground to &s;ee the occa&s;ion of his mi&s;take, where he &s;pyed the little animals in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable con|fu&s;ion. He had the delicacy of &s;entiment, to be really &s;orry for what he had done; and, putting him&s;elf in their condition, began to reflect upon the con&s;equence. It might be an age, to them, ere they could recover their tranquillity. He viewed them with a &s;ort of &s;mile, to find the anxiety they underwent for &s;uch peri&s;hable ha|bitations. Yet he con&s;idered that his contempt was only the effect of his own &s;uperiority; and that there might be &s;ome created beings, to whom his own &s;pecies mu&s;t appear as trifling. His remark did not cea&s;e here. He con&s;idered his future enterprize, with an eye to &s;uch a race of beings. He found it mu&s;t appear to them in a light as di&s;advantageous, as the ambition, and vain-glory of an ant would, to him&s;elf. How ridiculous, he &s;aid, mu&s;t this republic appear to me, could I di&s;cern its actions, as it has probably many, that are analogous to tho&s;e of human nature! Suppo&s;e them at continual variance about the property of a grain of &s;and. Sup|po&s;e one, that had acquired a few &s;ands more to his por|tion&mdash;as al&s;o one grain of wheat, and one &s;mall particle of barley-flour&mdash;&s;hould think him&s;elf qualified to tyran|nize over his equals, and to lord it, uncontrouled. Con&s;ider him, on this account, not contented to make u&s;e of the numerous legs with which nature has &s;upplied him, borne alo$t by a couple of &s;laves within the hollow of an hu&s;k of wheat, five or &s;ix others, at the &s;ame time, attending &s;olemnly upon the proce&s;&s;ion. Suppo&s;e la&s;tly, that among this people, the prime mini&s;ter &s;hould per&s;uade the re&s;t to levy war upon a neighbouring co|lony; and this in order to be &s;tiled the &s;overeign of two hillocks, in&s;tead of one; while perhaps their pre&s;ent condition leaves them nothing to wi&s;h be&s;ides &s;uperflui|ties. At the &s;ame time it is in the power of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable among mankind, nay of any &s;pecies of animals &s;uperior to their own, to de&s;troy at once the mi|ni&s;ter and people all together: this is doubtle&s;s very ri|diculous; yet this is doubtle&s;s my own ca&s;e, in re&s;pect

to many &s;ubordinate beings, and very certainly of the Supreme one. Farewell then, ye air-built citadels! farewell, vi&s;ions of un&s;olid glory! Don Pedro will &s;eek no honour of &s;o equivocal an acceptation, as to degrade his character to a &s;uperior &s;pecies, in proportion as it exalts him before his own.</P>
<P>See here a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion! in &s;hort, he found it &s;o fairly drawn, as immediately to drop his project, leave the army, and retire: of which whim&s;ical relation it may be well enough ob&s;erved, that a &s;pider had en&s;laved the world, had not an ant ob&s;tructed his de&s;ign.</P>

<HEAD>Upon Envy.&mdash;To a Friend, R. G.</HEAD>
<P>WHENCE is it, my friend, that I feel it impo&s;&s;i|ble to envy you, although, hereafter, your qua|lifications may make whole millions do &s;o? for, believe me, when I affirm, that I deem it much more &s;uper|fluous, to wi&s;h you honours to gratify your ambition, than to wi&s;h you ambition enough to make your honours &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>It &s;eems an hard ca&s;e that envy &s;hould be the con&s;e|quence of merit, at the &s;ame time that &s;corn &s;o naturally attends the want of it. It is however in &s;ome mea&s;ure perhaps an unavoidable (and perhaps in &s;ome &s;en&s;e an u&s;eful) pa&s;&s;ion in all the mo&s;t heroic natures; where, re|fined through certain &s;trainers, it takes the name of emu|lation. It is a pain ari&s;ing in our brea&s;ts, on contem|plation of the &s;uperior advantages of another: and its tendency is truly good, under &s;ome certain regulations.</P>
<P>All honour, very evidently, depends upon compari|&s;on; and con&s;equently the more numerous are our &s;u|periors, the &s;maller portion of it falls to our &s;hare. Con&s;idered relatively, we are dwarfs, or giants; though con&s;idered ab&s;olutely, we are neither. However, the love of this relative grandeur is made a part of our na|tures; and the u&s;e of emulation is to excite our dili|gence in pur&s;uit of power, for the &s;ake of beneficence.
<PB N="56" REF="65">
The in&s;tances of its perver&s;ion are obvious to every one's ob&s;ervation. A vicious mind, in&s;tead of its own emo|lument, &s;tudies the deba&s;ement of his &s;uperior. A per|&s;on to plea&s;e one of this ca&s;t, mu&s;t needs dive&s;t him&s;elf of all u&s;eful qualities; and in order to be beloved, di&s;|cover nothing that is truly amiable. One may very &s;afely fix our e&s;teem on tho&s;e whom we hear &s;ome people depreciate. Merit is to them as uniformly odious, as the &s;un it&s;elf to the birds of darkne&s;s. An author, to judge of his own merit, may fix his eye upon this tribe of men; and &s;uffer his &s;atisfaction to ari&s;e in due pro|portion to their di&s;content. Their di&s;approbation will &s;ufficiently influence every generous bo&s;om in his favour: and I would as implicitly give my applau&s;e to one whom they pull to pieces, as the inhabitants of Pegu wor&s;hip tho&s;e, that have been devoured by apes.</P>
<P>It is another perver&s;ion of this pa&s;&s;ion, though of a le&s;s enormous nature, when it merely &s;timulates us to rival others in points of no intrin&s;ic worth. To equal others in the u&s;ele&s;s parts of learning; to pur&s;ue riches for the &s;ake of an equipage as brilliant; to covet an equal knowledge of a table; to vie in jockey-&s;hip, or cunning at a bett. The&s;e, and many other rival&s;hips, an&s;wer not the genuine purpo&s;es of emulation.</P>
<P>I believe the pa&s;&s;ion is oftentimes derived from a too partial view of our own and others excellencies. We behold a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome particular advantage, and we immediately reflect upon its deficiency in our&s;elves. We wait not to examine what others we have to balance it. We envy another man's bodily accompli&s;hments; when our mental ones might preponderate, would we put them into the &s;cale. Should we a&s;k our own bo&s;oms whether we would change &s;ituations altogether, I fancy &s;elf-love would, generally, make us prefer our own con|dition. But if our &s;entiments remain the &s;ame after &s;uch an examination, all we can ju&s;tly endeavour is our own real advancement. To meditate this detriment either in fortune, power, or reputation, at the &s;ame time that it is infamous, has often a tendency to depre&s;s our|&s;elves. But let us confine our emulation to points of
<PB N="57" REF="66">
real worth; to riches, power, or knowledge, only that we may rival others in beneficence.</P>

<HEAD>A Vi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>INGENIOUS was the device of tho&s;e celebrated wor|thies, who, for the more effectual promulgation of their well-grounded maxims, fir&s;t pretended to divine in&s;piration. Peace be to their manes; may the turf lie lightly on their brea&s;t; and the verdure over their grave be as perpetual as their memories! Well knew they que&s;tionle&s;s, that a proceeding of this nature mu&s;t af|ford an excu&s;e to their mode&s;ty, as well as add a weight to their in&s;tructions. For, from the beginning of time, if we may believe the hi&s;tories of the be&s;t repute, man has ever found a delight in giving credit to &s;urpri&s;ing lies. There was indeed a nece&s;&s;ary degree of credit, previous to this delight; and there was as nece&s;&s;ary a delight, in order to enforce any degree of credit. But &s;o it was, that the plea&s;ure ro&s;e, in proportion to the wonder; and if the love of wonder was but gratified, no matter whether the tale was founded upon a witch or an Egeria; on a rat, a pigeon, the pummel of a &s;word, a bloated &s;ibyl, or a three-foot &s;tool.</P>
<P>Of all writers that bear any re&s;emblance to the&s;e ori|ginals, tho&s;e who approach the neare&s;t, are &s;uch, as de|&s;cribe their extraordinary dreams and vi&s;ions. Of o&s;ten|tation we may not, peradventure, accu&s;e them, who claim to them&s;elves no other than the merit of &s;pectators. Of want of abilities we mu&s;t not cen&s;ure them; when we are given to know that their imagination had no more part in the affair, than a whited wall has, in tho&s;e various figures, which &s;ome crafty arti&s;t repre&s;ents thereon.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t meditation of a &s;olitary, is the behaviour of men in active life. Haple&s;s &s;pecies, I cried, how very gro&s;sly art thou mi&s;taken! how very &s;upine, while youth permits thee to gain the prize of virtue, by re&s;traint!
<PB N="58" REF="67">
how very re&s;olute, when thine age leaves nothing to re|&s;train thee! thou give&s;t a loo&s;e to thine inclinations, till they lo&s;e their very being; and, like a lamp over|whelmed with oil, are extingui&s;hed by indulgence. What folly to dream of virtue, when there is no longer room for &s;elf-denial; or, when the enemy expires by &s;ickne&s;s, to demand the honour of a triumph!&mdash;Mu&s;ing upon this &s;ubject, I fell into a profound &s;lumber; and the vi&s;ion with which it furni&s;hed me, &s;hall &s;upply ma|terials for this e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>I was, methought, tran&s;ported into a winding valley, on each &s;ide of who&s;e area, &s;o far as my eye could &s;ee, were held up (in the manner of a picture) all the plea&s;|ing objects either of art or nature. Hills ro&s;e one be|yond another, crowned with trees, or adorned with edi|fices; broken rocks contra&s;ted with lawns, and foaming rivers poured headlong over them; gilded &s;pires enli|vened even the &s;un&s;hine; and lone&s;ome ruins, by the &s;ide of woods, gave a &s;olemnity to the &s;hade. It would be endle&s;s, or rather impo&s;&s;ible, to give an idea of the va&s;t variety. It &s;eemed, as though people of whatever inclinations might here meet with their favourite object.</P>
<P>While I &s;tood amazed, and even confounded, at &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a land&s;cape; an old man approached towards me, and offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in alleviating my &s;urpize. You ob&s;erve, &s;ays he, in the middle path, a train of &s;prightly female pilgrims <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pa&s;&s;ions.</NOTE>, conducted by a matron <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rea&s;on.</NOTE> of a graver ca&s;t. She is habited, as you may ob&s;erve, in a robe far more plain and &s;imple than that of any amid&s;t her followers. It is her province to re&s;train her pupils, that the objects glittering on each &s;ide may may not &s;e|duce them to make excur&s;ions, from which they &s;carce ever find their right away again. You may not, per|haps, &s;u&s;pect the gulphs and precipices that lie inter|mixed amid&s;t a &s;cenery &s;o delightful to the eye. You &s;ee, indeed, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, the gilt dome of a temple, rai&s;ed on columns of the white&s;t marble. I mu&s;t inform you, that within this temple re&s;ides a lady <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Virtue.</NOTE>&punc;

weaving wreaths of immortal amaranth for that wor|thy matron, if &s;he exert her authority; and, as their obedience is more or le&s;s entire, &s;he has al&s;o garlands of inferior lu&s;tre to recompence the ladies in her train.</P>
<P>Your own &s;agacity, added he, will &s;upply the place of farther in&s;tructions; and then vani&s;hed in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>The &s;pace before me, as it appeared, was cro&s;&s;ed by four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rivers. Over the&s;e were thrown as many bridges, and beyond each of the&s;e &s;treams the ground &s;eemed to vary its degree of lu&s;tre, as much as if it had lain under a different climate. On the &s;ide of each of the&s;e rivers appeared, as I thought, a receptacle for travellers; &s;o that the journey &s;eemed to be portioned into four di&s;tinct &s;tages. It is po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e were meant to repre&s;ent the periods of a man's life; which may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of infancy, youth, manhood, and old age.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t &s;tage, our travellers proceeded with|out much di&s;turbance. Their excur&s;ions were of no greater extent than to crop a primro&s;e, or a dai&s;y, that grew on the way-&s;ide: and in the&s;e their governe&s;s in|dulged them. She gave them but few checks, and they afforded her but little occa&s;ion. But when they arrived at the &s;econd period, the ca&s;e then was greatly altered. The young ladies grew vi&s;ibly enamoured of the beau|ties on each &s;ide; and the governe&s;s began to feel a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her duty to re&s;train them. They petition|ed clamorou&s;ly to make one &s;hort excur&s;ion, and met with a decent refu&s;al. One of them, that vi&s;ibly &s;hewed her|&s;elf the greate&s;t vixen and romp <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Love.</NOTE> among&s;t them, had a thou&s;and arts and &s;tratagems to circumvent her well-meaning governe&s;s. I mu&s;t here mention, what I re|marked afterwards, that &s;ome of the pupils felt greater attractions in one &s;tage; and &s;ome in another. And the &s;cene before them being well variegated with mo&s;&s;y banks and purling &s;treams, fri&s;king lambs and piping &s;hepherds; in&s;pired a longing that was inexpre&s;&s;ible, to one that &s;eemed of an amorous complexion. She re|que&s;ted
<PB N="60" REF="69">
to make a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion; pointed to the band of &s;hepherds dancing; and, as I ob&s;erved, pre&s;ented a gla&s;s, through which the matron might di&s;tinctly view them. The governe&s;s applied the gla&s;s, and it was wonderful to trace the change it effected. She, who be|fore had with much con&s;tancy oppo&s;ed the prayers of her petitioner, now began to lean towards her demands; and, as if &s;he her&s;elf were not quite indi&s;ferent to the &s;cene of plea&s;ure &s;he had beheld, grew remi&s;s in her di&s;|cipline; &s;oftened the language of di&s;&s;ent; and with a gentle reprimand, &s;uffered her pupil to elope. After this, however, &s;he winked her eyes; that &s;he might not at lea&s;t bear te&s;timony to the &s;tep &s;he did not approve. When the lady had gratified her curio&s;ity, &s;he returned for the pre&s;ent; but with an appetite more inflamed, and more impatient to repeat her frolic. The gover|ne&s;s appeared unea&s;y, and to repent of her own compli|ance; and rea&s;on good &s;he had; con&s;idering the confi|dence it gave her pupil, and the weight it took from her own authority.</P>
<P>They were not pa&s;&s;ed far from the &s;econd &s;tage of their journey, ere they all determined to rebel, and &s;ub|mit to the tyranny of their leader no longer.</P>
<P>Another now took the lead; and &s;eizing an em|broidered handkerchief, completely hoodwinked the di|rectre&s;s. All now was tumult, anarchy, di&s;agreement, and confu&s;ion. They led their guide along, blindfold, not without propo&s;als of downright murder. They &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the regular path, and &s;trode along with amazing rapidity. I &s;hould however, except &s;ome few <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Virtuo&s;o-pa&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>, who, being of a complexion naturally languid, and thus deprived of their protectre&s;s, had neither con&s;tancy to keep the road, nor &s;pirit enough to &s;tray far from it. The&s;e found the utmo&s;t of their inclinations gratified, in trea&s;uring up &s;hells from the banks of the river, &s;cooping fo&s;&s;ils from the rocks, or pre&s;erving plants that grew in the valley.

A <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">Avarice.</NOTE> third would not move a &s;tep farther, till &s;he had gathered &s;ome ore that was wa&s;hed from the mountains.

<P>She promi&s;ed to &s;ecure them all the happine&s;s that was con&s;i&s;tent with their pre&s;ent &s;tate; and advi&s;ed them all to follow her towards the path they had for&s;aken.</P>
<P>Our travellers, in a little time after this, pa&s;&s;ed over
&#60;
<PB N="62" REF="71">
the bridge that introduced them to their clo&s;ing &s;tage. The &s;ubjects, very orderly, repentant, and demi&s;&s;ive; the governe&s;s, more rigid and imperious than ever. The former, withered, decrepid, langui&s;hing; the latter, in greater vigour, and more beautiful than before. Time appeared to produce in her, a very oppo&s;ite effect, to that it wrought in her companions. She &s;eemed, in|deed, no more that ea&s;y ductile creature, in&s;ulted and borne away by the whims of her companions. She ap|peared more judicious in the commands &s;he gave, and more rigorous in the execution. In &s;hort, both her own activity, and-the &s;upine lethargy of tho&s;e whom &s;he con|ducted united to make way for her unlimited authority. Now, indeed, a more limited rule might have &s;ecured obedience, and maintained a regularity. The ladies were but little &s;truck with the glare of objects on each &s;ide the way. One alone I mu&s;t except, whom I beheld look wi&s;hfully, with a retorted eye, towards the golden ore wa&s;hed down by the torrents. The governe&s;s re|pre&s;ented, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that the materials could not be imported into the realms they were about to enter. That, were this even the ca&s;e, they could be there of no importance. However, &s;he had not extir|pated the bias of this craving dame, when they ap|proached the temple to which I formerly alluded.</P>
<P>The temple &s;tood upon a lofty hill, half encircled with trees of never-fading verdure. Between the milk-white columns (which were of the Dorick order, the ba&s;es gilt, as al&s;o the capitals) a blaze of glory i&s;&s;ued, of &s;uch &s;uperior lu&s;tre, that none be&s;ide the governe&s;s was able to approach it. She, indeed, with a dejected counte|nance, drew near unto the godde&s;s; who gently waved her hand in the way of &s;alutation.</P>
<P>The matron &s;eemed le&s;s dazzled, than delighted with her exce&s;&s;ive beauty. She acco&s;ted her with reverence, and with much diffidence began to mention their pre|ten&s;ion to her favour. <Q>&startq;She mu&s;t own, &s;he had been too remi&s;s in the beginning of her government; &s;he hoped it would be attributed to inexperience in the &s;ubtle wiles of her fellow-travellers. She flattered
<PB N="63" REF="72">
her&s;elf, that her &s;everity towards the conclu&s;ion of her journey might in &s;ome &s;ort make atonement for her mi&s;behaviour in the beginning. La&s;tly, that &s;he &s;ometimes found it impo&s;&s;ible to hear the dictates of the Godde&s;s amid the clamours of her pupils, and the din of their per&s;ua&s;ions.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>To this the godde&s;s may reply.</P>
<P>"You have heard," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>&startq;no doubt that the favours I be&s;tow, are by no means con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of inactivity. The only time when you were allowed an opportunity to de&s;erve them, was the time when your pupils were the mo&s;t refractory and per|ver&s;e. The honours you expect in my court are pro|portioned to the difficulty of a good undertaking. May you, hereafter, partake them, in reward of your more vigorous conduct: for the pre&s;ent, you are little entitled to any recompence from me. As to your pupils, I ob&s;erve, they have pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon them&s;elves.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>At this in&s;tant of time the bell rung for &s;upper, and awaked me: I found the gardener by my &s;ide, prepared to plant a parcel of trees; and that I had &s;lumbered away the hours, in which I &s;hould have given him &s;uit|able directions.</P>

<HEAD>Unconnected Thoughts on Gardening.</HEAD>
<P>GARDENING may be divided into three &s;pecies&mdash;kitchen-gardening&mdash;parterre-gardening&mdash;and land&s;cape, or picture&s;que-gardening: which latter is the &s;ubject intended in the following pages&mdash;It con&s;i&s;ts in plea&s;ing the imagination by &s;cenes of grandeur, beauty, or variety. Convenience merely has no &s;hare here, any farther than as it plea&s;es the imagination.</P>
<P>Perhaps the divi&s;ion of the plea&s;ures of imagination, according as they are &s;truck by the great, the various, and the beautiful, may be accurate enough for my pre|&s;ent purpo&s;e: why each of them affects us with plea|&s;ure
<PB N="64" REF="73">
may be traced in other authors. See Burke, Hutchin&s;on, Gerard, the theory of agreeable &s;en&s;ations, &amp;c <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Garden-&s;cenes may perhaps be divided into the &s;ublime, the beautiful, and the melancholy or pen&s;ive; to which la&s;t I know not but we may a&s;&s;ign a middle place betwixt the former two, as being in &s;ome &s;ort compo&s;ed of both. See Burke's Sublime.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There &s;eems however to be &s;ome objects, which afford a plea&s;ure not reducible to either of the foregoing heads. A ruin, for in&s;tance, may be neither new to us, nor ma|je&s;tic, nor beautiful, yet afford that plea&s;ing melancholy which proceeds from a reflexion on decayed magnifi|cence. For this rea&s;on, an able gardener &s;hould avail him&s;elf of objects, perhaps, not very &s;triking; if they &s;erve to connect ideas, that convey reflexions of the plea&s;ing kind.</P>
<P>Objects &s;hould indeed be le&s;s calculated to &s;trike the immediate eye, than the judgement or well-formed imagination; as in painting.</P>
<P>It is no objection to the plea&s;ure of novelty, that it makes an ugly object more di&s;agreeable. It is enough that it produces a &s;uperiority betwixt things in other re&s;pects equal. It &s;eems, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to go even farther. Are there not broken rocks and rugged grounds, to which we can hardly attribute either beau|ty or grandeur; and yet when introduced near an ex|tent of lawn, impart a plea&s;ure equal to more &s;hapely &s;cenes? Thus a &s;eries of lawn, though ever &s;o beauti|ful, may &s;atiate and cloy, unle&s;s the eye pa&s;&s;es to them from wilder &s;cenes; and then they acquire the grace of novelty.</P>
<P>Variety appears to me to derive good part of its ef|fect from novelty; as the eye, pa&s;&s;ing from one form or colour, to a form or colour of a different kind, finds a degree of novelty in its pre&s;ent object, which affords im|mediate &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Variety however, in &s;ome in&s;tances, may be carried to &s;uch exce&s;s as to lo&s;e its whole effect. I have ob&s;erved
<PB N="65" REF="74">
ceilings &s;o crammed with &s;tucco-ornaments; that, al|though of the mo&s;t different kinds, they have produced an uniformity. A &s;ufficient quantity of undecorated &s;pace is nece&s;&s;ary to exhibit &s;uch decorations to advan|tage.</P>
<P>Ground &s;hould fir&s;t be con&s;idered with an eye to its peculiar character: whether it be the grand, the &s;avage, the melancholy, the horrid, or the beautiful. As one or other of the&s;e characters prevail, one may &s;omewhat &s;trengthen its effect, by allowing every part &s;ome deno|mination, and then &s;upporting its title by &s;uitable ap|pendages&mdash;For in&s;tance, The lover's walk may have a&s;|&s;ignation &s;eats, with proper mottoes&mdash;urns to faithful lovers&mdash;trophies, garlands, &amp;c. by means of art.</P>
<P>What an advantage mu&s;t &s;ome Italian &s;eats derive from the circum&s;tance of being &s;ituate on ground men|tioned in the cla&s;&s;ics? And, even in England, wherever a park or garden happens to have been the &s;cene of any event in hi&s;tory, one would &s;urely avail one's &s;elf of that circum&s;tance, to make it more intere&s;ting to the imagi|nation. Mottoes &s;hould allude to it, columns, &amp;c. re|cord it; ver&s;es moralize upon it; and curio&s;ity receive its &s;hare of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In de&s;igning a hou&s;e and gardens, it is happy when there is an opportunity of maintaining a &s;ubordination of parts; the hou&s;e &s;o luckily placed as to exhibit a view of the whole de&s;ign. I have &s;ometimes thought that there was room for it to re&s;emble an epic or dramatic poem. It is rather to be wi&s;hed than required, that the more &s;triking &s;cenes may &s;ucceed tho&s;e which are le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>Ta&s;te depends much upon temper. Some prefer Ti|bullus to Virgil, and Virgil to Homer&mdash;Hagley to Persfield, and Persfield to the Wel&s;h mountains. This occa&s;ions the different preferences that are given to &s;itu|ations&mdash;A garden &s;trikes us mo&s;t, where the grand and the plea&s;ing &s;ucceed, not intermingle with, each other.</P>
<P>I believe, however, the &s;ublime has generally a deeper effect than the merely beautiful.</P>
<P>I u&s;e the words land&s;cape and pro&s;pect, the former as
<PB N="66" REF="75">
expre&s;&s;ive of home &s;cenes, the latter of di&s;tant images. Pro&s;pects &s;hould take in the blue di&s;tant hills; but never &s;o remotely, that they be not di&s;tingui&s;hable from clouds. Yet this mere extent is what the vulgar value.</P>
<P>Land&s;cape &s;hould contain variety enough to form a picture upon canvas; and this is no bad te&s;t, as I think the land&s;cape painter is the gardener's be&s;t de&s;igner. The eye requires a &s;ort of balance here; but not &s;o as to encroach upon probable nature. A wood, or hill, may balance a hou&s;e or obeli&s;k; for exactne&s;s would be di&s;plea&s;ing. We form our notions from what we have &s;een; and though, could we comprehend the univer&s;e, we might perhaps find it uniformly regular; yet the portions that we &s;ee of it, habituate our fancy to the contrary.</P>
<P>The eye &s;hould always look rather down upon water: cu&s;tomary nature makes this requi&s;ite. I know nothing more &s;en&s;ibly di&s;plea&s;ing than Mr. T&mdash;'s flat ground betwixt his terrace and his water.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to account for the fondne&s;s of former times for &s;traight lined avenues to their hou&s;es; &s;traight-lined walks through their woods; and, in &s;hort, every kind of &s;traight-line; where the foot is to travel over, what the eye has done before. This cir|cum&s;tance, is one objection. Another, &s;omewhat of the &s;ame kind, is the repetition of the &s;ame object, tree after tree, for a length of way together. A third is, that this identity is purcha&s;ed by the lo&s;s of that varie|ty, which the natural country &s;upplies every where, in a greater or le&s;s degree. To &s;tand &s;till and &s;urvey &s;uch ave|nues, may afford &s;ome &s;lender &s;atisfaction, through the change derived &s;ome per&s;pective; but to move on con|tinually and find no change of &s;cene in the lea&s;t attend|ant on our change of place, mu&s;t give actual pain to a per&s;on of ta&s;te. For &s;uch an one to be condemned to pa&s;s along the famous vi&s;ta <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Monte&s;quieu, on Ta&s;te.</NOTE> from Mo&s;cow to Peter&s;|burg, or that other from Arga to Lahor in India, mu&s;t be as di&s;agreeable a &s;entence, as to be condenmed to la|bour at the gallies. I conceived &s;ome idea of the &s;en|&s;ation
<PB N="67" REF="76">
he mu&s;t feel, from walking but a few minutes, immured, betwixt Lord D&mdash;'s high-&s;horn yew-hedges; which run exactly parellel, at the di&s;tance of about ten feet; and are contrived perfectly to exclude all kind of objects what&s;oever.</P>
<P>When a building, or other object, has been once view|ed from its proper point, the foot &s;hould never travel to it by the &s;ame path, which the eye has travelled over be|fore. Lo&s;e the object, and draw nigh, obliquely.</P>
<P>The &s;ide-trees in vi&s;tas &s;hould be &s;o circum&s;tanced as to afford a probability that they grew by nature.</P>
<P>Ruinated &s;tructures appear to derive their power of ple$&s;ing, from the irregularity of &s;urface, which is va|riety; and the latitude they afford the imagination, to conceive an enlargement of their dimen&s;ions, or to re|collect any events or circum&s;tances appertaining to their pri&s;tine grandeur, &s;o far as concerns grandeur and &s;o|lemnity. The breaks in them &s;hould be as bold and abrupt as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;If mere beauty be aimed at (which however is not their chief excellence) the waving line, with more ea&s;y tran&s;itions, will become of greater im|portance&mdash;Events relating to them may be &s;imulated by numberle&s;s little artifices; but it is ever to be remem|bered, that high hills and &s;udden de&s;cents are mo&s;t &s;uit|able to ca&s;tles; and fertile vales, near wood and water, mo&s;t imitative of the u&s;ual &s;ituation for abbeys and reli|gious hou&s;es; large oaks, in particular, are e&s;&s;ential to the&s;e latter;</P>
<Q><L>"Who&s;e branching arms, and reverend height,</L>

<P>A cottage is a plea&s;ing object, partly on account of the variety it may introduce; on account of the tranquilli|ty that &s;eems to reign there; and perhaps (I am &s;ome|what afraid) on account of the pride of human nature:</P>
<Q>"Longi alterius &s;pectare laborem."</Q>
<P>In a &s;cene pre&s;ented to the eye, objects &s;hould never lie
<PB N="68" REF="77">
&s;o much to the right or left, as to give it any unea&s;ine&s;s in the examination. Sometimes, however, it may be better to admit valuable objects even with this di&s;ad|vantage. They &s;hould el&s;e never be &s;een beyond a cer|tain angle. The eye mu&s;t be ea&s;y, before it can be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>No mere &s;lope from one &s;ide to the other can be agree|able ground: The eye requires a balance&mdash;i. e. a de|gree of uniformity: but this may be otherwi&s;e effected, and the rule &s;hould be under&s;tood with &s;ome limitation.</P>
<Q><L>"&mdash;Each alley has its brother,</L>
<L>"And half the plat-form ju&s;t reflects the other."</L></Q>
<P>Let us examine what may be &s;aid in favour of that regularity which Mr. Pope expo&s;es. Might he not &s;eemingly as well object to the di&s;po&s;ition of an human face, becau&s;e it has an eye or cheek, that is the very picture of its companion? Or does not providence, who has ob&s;erved this regularity in the external &s;truc|ture of our bodies and di&s;regarded it within, &s;eem to con&s;ider it as a beauty? The arms, the limbs, and the &s;everal parts of them corre&s;pond, but it is not the &s;ame ca&s;e with the thorax a$d the abdomen. I believe one is generally &s;olicitous for a kind of balance in a land|&s;cape; and, if I am not mi&s;taken, the painters generally furni&s;h one: a building for in&s;tance on one &s;ide, con|tra&s;ted by a group of trees, a large oak, or a ri&s;ing hill on the other. Whence then does this ta&s;te proceed, but from the love we bear to regularity in per&s;ection? Af|ter all, in regard to gardens, the &s;hape of ground, the di&s;po&s;ition of trees, and the figure of water, mu&s;t be &s;a|cred to nature; and no forms mu&s;t be allowed that make a di&s;covery of art.</P>
<P>All trees have a character analogous to that of men: oaks are in all re&s;pects the perfect image of the manly character: in former times I &s;hould have &s;aid, and in pre&s;ent times I think I am authorized to &s;ay, the Briti&s;h one. As a brave man is not &s;uddenly either elated by pro&s;perity or depre&s;&s;ed by adver&s;ity, &s;o the oak di&s;plays
<PB N="69" REF="78">
not its verdure on the &s;un's fir&s;t approach; nor drops it, on his fir&s;t departure. Add to this its maje&s;tic appear|ance, the rough grandeur of its bark, and the wide pro|tection of its branches.</P>
<P>A large, branching, aged oak, is perhaps the mo&s;t venerable of all inanimate objects.</P>
<P>Urns are more &s;olemn, if large and plain; more beau|tiful, if le&s;s and ornamented. Solemnity is perhaps their point, and the &s;ituation of them &s;hould &s;till co-operate with it.</P>
<P>By the way, I wonder that lead &s;tatues are not more in vogue in our modern gardens. Though they may not expre&s;s the finer lines of an human body, yet they &s;eem perfectly well calculated, on account of their durg|tion, to embeli&s;h land&s;capes, were they &s;ome degrees in|ferior to what we generally behold. A &s;tatue in a room challenges examination, and is to be examined critically as a &s;tatue. A &s;tatue in a garden is to be con&s;idered as one part of a &s;cene or land&s;cape; the minuter touches are no more e&s;&s;ential to it, than a good land&s;cape paint|er would e&s;teem them were he to repre&s;ent a &s;tatue in his picture.</P>
<P>Apparent art, in its proper province, is almo&s;t as im|portant as im|portant as apparent nature. They contra&s;t agreeably; but their provinces ever &s;hould be kept di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>Some artificial beauties are &s;o dextrou&s;ly managed, that one cannot but conceive them natural; &s;ome natu|ral ones &s;o extremely fortunate, that one is ready to &s;wear they are artificial.</P>
<P>Concerning &s;cenes, the more uncommon they appear, the better, provided they form a picture, and include nothing that pretends to be of nature's production, and is not. The &s;hape of ground, the &s;ite of trees, and the fall of water, nature's province. Whatever thwarts her is trea&s;on.</P>
<P>On the other hand, buildings and the works of art need have no other reference to nature than that they af|ford the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> with which the human mind is de|lighted.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="79">
Art &s;hould never be allowed to &s;et a foot in the pro|vince of nature, otherwi&s;e than clande&s;tinely and by night. Whenever &s;he is allowed to appear here, and men begin to compromi&s;e the difference&mdash;night, gothic|i&s;m, confu&s;ion, and ab&s;olute chaos, are come again.</P>
<P>To &s;ee one's urns, obeli&s;ks, and waterfalls laid open; the nakedne&s;s of our beloved mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, the Naiads and the Dryads, expo&s;ed by that ruffian Winter to univer&s;al ob&s;ervation; is a &s;everity &s;carcely to be &s;upported by the help of blazing hearths, cheerful companions, and a bottle of the mo&s;t grateful burgundy.</P>
<P>The works of a per&s;on that builds, begin immedi|ately to decay; while tho&s;e of him who plants begin di|rectly to improve. In this, planting promi&s;es a more la&s;ting plea&s;ure, than building; which, were it to re|main in equal perfection, would at be&s;t begin to moulder and want repairs in imagination. Now trees have a circum&s;tance that &s;uits our ta&s;te, and that is annual va|riety. It is inconvenient indeed, if they cau&s;e our love of life to take root and flouri&s;h with them; whereas the very &s;amene&s;s of our &s;tructures will, without the help of dilapidation, &s;erve to wean us from our attachment to them.</P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom in &s;ome countries to condemn the cha|racters of tho&s;e (after death) that have neither planted a tree, nor begot a child.</P>
<P>The ta&s;te of the citizen and of the mere pea&s;ant are in all re&s;pects the &s;ame. The former gilds his balls; paints his &s;tonework and &s;tatues white; plants his trees in lines or circles; cuts his yew-trees four-&s;quare or conic; or gives them, what he can, of the re&s;emblance of birds, or bears, or men; &s;quirts up his rivulets in jetteaus; in &s;hort, admires no part of nature, but her ductility; exhibits every thing that is glaring, that implies expence, or that effects a &s;urprize becau&s;e it is unnatural. The pea&s;ant is his admirer.</P>
<P>It is always to be remembered in gardening, that &s;ublimity or magnificience, and beauty or variety, are very different things. Every &s;cene we &s;ee in nature is either tame and in&s;ipid; or compounded of tho&s;e. It
<PB N="71" REF="80">
often happens that the &s;ame ground may receive from art, either certain degrees of &s;ublimity and magnificance, or certain degrees of variety and beauty; or a mixture of each kind. In this ca&s;e it remains to be con&s;idered in which light they can be rendered mo&s;t remarkable, whether as objects of beauty or magnificence. Even the temper of the proprietor &s;hould not perhaps be whol|ly di&s;regarded: for certain complexions of &s;oul will pre|fer an orange tree or a myrtle, to an oak or cedar. However, this &s;hould not induce a gardener to parcel out a lawn into knots of &s;hrubbery; or inve&s;t a moun|tain with a garb of ro&s;es. This would be like dre&s;&s;ing a giant in a &s;ar&s;enet gown, or a Saracen's head in a Bru&s;&s;el's night-cap. Indeed the &s;mall and circular clumps of firs, which I &s;ee planted upon &s;ome fine large &s;wells, put me often in mind of a coronet placed on an elephant or camel's back. I &s;ay, a gardener &s;hould not do this, any more than a poet &s;hould attempt to write of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in the &s;tyle of Philips. On the other &s;ide, what would become of Le&s;bia's &s;par|row, &s;hould it be treated in the &s;ame language with the anger of Achilles?</P>
<P>Gardeners may be divided into three &s;orts, the land|&s;cape gardener, the paterre gardener, and the kitchen gardener, agreeably to our fir&s;t divi&s;ion of gardens.</P>
<P>I have u&s;ed the word land&s;cape-gardeners; becau&s;e, in pur&s;uance of our pre&s;ent ta&s;te in gardening, every good painter of land&s;cape appears to me the mo&s;t proper de|&s;igner. The misfortune of it is, that the&s;e painters are apt to regard the execution of their work, much more than the choice of &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The art of di&s;tancing and approximating, comes tru|ly within their &s;phere: the former by the gradual dimi|nution of di&s;tinctne&s;s, and of &s;ize; the latter by the re|ver&s;e. A &s;traight-lined avenue that is widened in front, and planted there with yew trees, then firs, then with trees more and more fady, till they end in the almond-willow, or &s;ilver o&s;ier; will produce a very remarkable deception of the former kind; which deception will be encrea&s;ed, if the nearer dark trees are proportionable
<PB N="72" REF="81">
and truly larger than tho&s;e at the end of the avenue that are more fady.</P>
<P>To di&s;tance a building, plant as near as you can to it, two or three circles of different-coloured greens&mdash;Ever-greens are be&s;t for all &s;uch purpo&s;es&mdash;Suppo&s;e the outer one of holly, and the next of laurel, &amp;c. The con&s;equence will be that the imagination immediately allows a &s;pace betwixt the&s;e circles, and another betwixt the hou&s;e and them; and as the imagined &s;pace is deter|minate, if your building be dim-coloured, it will not appear incon&s;iderable. The imagination is a greater magnifier than a micro&s;cope gla&s;s. And on this head, I have known &s;ome in&s;tances, where, by &s;hewing inter|mediate ground, the di&s;tance has appeared le&s;s, than while an hedge or grove concealed it.</P>
<P>Hedges, appearing as &s;uch, are univer&s;ally bad. They di&s;cover art in nature's province.</P>
<P>Trees in hedges partake of their artificiality, and be|come a part of them. There is no more &s;udden and ob|vious improvement, than an hedge removed, and the trees remaining; yet not in &s;uch manner as to mark out the former hedge.</P>
<P>Water &s;hould ever appear, as an irregular lake, or winding &s;tream.</P>
<P>I&s;lands give beauty, if the water be adequate; but le&s;&s;en grandeur through variety.</P>
<P>It was the wi&s;e remark of &s;ome &s;agacious ob&s;erver, that familiarity is for the mo&s;t part productive of con|tempt. Gracele&s;s offspring of &s;o amiable a parent! Unfortunate beings that we are, who&s;e enjoyments mu&s;t be either checked, or prove de&s;tructive of them&s;elves. Our pa&s;&s;ions are permitted to &s;ip a little plea&s;ure: but are extingui&s;hed by indulgence, like a lamp overw$. Im|ed with oil. Hence we neglect the beauty with which we have been intimate; nor would any addition it could receive, prove an equivalent for the advantage it derived from the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. Thus, negligent of graces that have the merit of reality, we too often prefer imaginary ones that have only the charm of no|velty: and hence we may account, in general, for the
<PB N="73" REF="82">
preference of art to nature, in our old-fa&s;hioned gardens.</P>
<P>Art, indeed, is often requi&s;ite to collect and epito|mize the beauties of nature; but &s;hould never be &s;uf|fered to &s;et her mark upon them; I mean, in regard to tho&s;e articles that are of nature's province; the &s;haping of ground, the planting of trees, and the di&s;po&s;ition of lakes and rivulets. Many more particulars will &s;oon occur, which, however, &s;he is allowed to regulate, &s;omewhat clande&s;tinely, upon the following account&mdash;Man is not capable of comprehending the univer&s;e at one &s;urvey. Had he faculties equal to this, he might well be cen&s;ured for any minute regulations of his own. It were the &s;ame, as if, in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, he &s;trove to find amu&s;ement in contriving the fabric of an ant's ne&s;t, or the partitions of a bee-hive. But we are placed in the corner of a &s;phere; endued neither with or|gans, nor allowed a &s;tation, proper to give us an univer|&s;al view or to exhibit to us the variety, the orderly propor|tions, and di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;y&s;tem. We perceive many breaks and blemi&s;hes, &s;everal neglected and un|variegated placed in the part; which, in the whole, would appear either imperceptible, or beautiful. And we might as rationally expect a &s;nail to be &s;atisfied with the beauty of our parterres, &s;lopes, and terraces&mdash;or an ant to prefer our buildings to her own orderly range of granaries, as that man &s;hould be &s;atisfied, without a &s;ingle thought that he can improve the &s;pot that falls to his &s;hare. But, though art be nece&s;&s;ary for collecting nature's beauties, by what rea&s;on is &s;he authorized to thwart and to oppo&s;e her? Why fanta&s;tically endeavour to humanize tho&s;e vegetables, of which nature, di&s;creet nature, thought it proper to make trees? Why endow the vegetable bird with wings, which nature has made momentarily dependent upon the &s;oil? Here art &s;eems very affectedly to make a di&s;play of that indu&s;try, which it is her glory to conceal. The &s;tone which repre&s;ents an a&s;teri&s;k, is valued only on account of its natural produc|tion: Nor do we view with plea&s;ure the laboured cary|ings and futile diligence of gothic arti&s;ts. We view with much more &s;atisfaction &s;ome plain Grecian fabric,
<PB N="74" REF="83">
where art, indeed, has been equally, but le&s;s vi&s;ibly, indu&s;trious. It is thus we, indeed, admire the &s;hining texture of the &s;ilkworm; but we loath the puny author, when &s;he thinks proper to emerge; and to di&s;gu&s;t us with the appearance of &s;o vile a grub.</P>
<P>But this is merely true in regard to the particulars of nature's province; wherein art can only appear as the mo&s;t abject va&s;&s;al, and had, therefore, better not appear at all. The ca&s;e is different where &s;he has the direction of buildings, u&s;eful or ornamental; or perhaps, claims as much honour from temples, as the deities to whom they are in&s;cribed. Here then it is his intere&s;t to be &s;een as much as po&s;&s;ible: and, though nature appear doubly beautiful by the contra&s;t her &s;tructures furni&s;h, it is not ea&s;y for her to confer a benefit which nature, on her &s;ide, will not repay.</P>
<P>A rural &s;cene to me is never perfect without the ad|dition of &s;ome kind of building: indeed I have known a &s;car of rock-work, in great mea&s;ure, &s;upply the de|ficiency.</P>
<P>In gardening, it is no &s;mall point to enforce either grandeur or beauty by &s;urprize; for in&s;tance, by abrupt tran&s;ition from their contraries&mdash;but to lay a &s;tre&s;s upon &s;urprize only; for example, on the &s;urprize occa&s;ioned by an aha! without including any nobler purpo&s;e; is a &s;ymptom of bad ta&s;te, and a violent fondne&s;s for mere concetto.</P>
<P>Grandeur and beauty are &s;o very oppo&s;ite, that you often dimini&s;h the one as you encrea&s;e the other. Va|riety is mo&s;t a-kin to the latter, &s;implicity to the former.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a large hill varied, by art, with large patches of different-coloured clumps, &s;cars of rocks, chalk-quarries, villages, or farm-hou&s;es; you will have, perhaps, a more beautiful &s;cene, but much le&s;s grand than it was before.</P>
<P>In many in&s;tances, it is mo&s;t eligible to compound your &s;cene of beauty and grandeur&mdash;Suppo&s;e a magnifi+cent &s;well ari&s;ing out of a well-variegated valley; it would be di&s;advantageous to encrea&s;e its beauty, by means de&s;tructive to its magnificence.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="84">
There may po&s;&s;ibly, but there &s;eldom happens to be any occa&s;ion to fill up valleys, with trees or otherwi&s;e. It is for the mo&s;t part the gardener's bu&s;ine&s;s to remove trees, or aught that fills up the low ground; and to give, as far as nature allows, an artificial eminence to the high.</P>
<P>The hedge-row apple-trees in Hereford&s;hire afford a mo&s;t beautiful &s;cenery, at the time they are in blo&s;&s;om: but the pro&s;pect would be really grander, did it con&s;i&s;t of &s;imple foliage. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, a large oak (or beech) in autumn, is a grander object than the &s;ame in &s;pring. The &s;prightly green is then obfu&s;cated.</P>
<P>Smoothne&s;s and ea&s;y tran&s;itions are no &s;mall ingre|dient in the beautiful; abrupt and rectangular breaks have more of the nature of the &s;ublime. Thus a taper|ing &s;pire is, perhaps, a more beautiful object than a tower, which is grander.</P>
<P>Many of the different opinions relating to the pre|ference to be given to &s;eats, villas, &amp;c. are owing to want of di&s;tinction betwixt the beautiful and the mag|nificent. Both the former and the latter plea&s;e; but there are imaginations particularly adapted to the one, and to the other.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on thought an open uninclo&s;ed champain country, formed the be&s;t land&s;cape. Somewhat here is to be con&s;idered. Large, unvariegated, &s;imple objects have the be&s;t preten&s;ions to &s;ublimity; a large mountain, who&s;e &s;ides are unvaried with objects, is grander than one with infinite variety: but then its beauty is propor|tionably le&s;s.</P>
<P>However, I think a plain &s;pace near the eye gives it a kind of liberty it loves: and then the picture, whe|ther you chu&s;e the grand or beautiful, &s;hould be held up at its proper di&s;tance. Variety is the principal in|gredient in beauty; and &s;implicity is e&s;&s;ential to gran|deur.</P>
<P>Offen&s;ive objects, at a proper di&s;tance, acquire even a degree of beauty: for in&s;tance, &s;tubble fallow ground&mdash;</P>

<P>Re&s;i&s;tance to the reigning powers is ju&s;tifiable, upon a conviction that their government is incon&s;i&s;tent with the good of the &s;ubject; that our interpo&s;ition tends to e&s;tabli&s;h better mea&s;ures; and this without a probability of occa&s;ioning evils that may overbalance them.

<P>People are, perhaps, more vicious in towns, becau&s;e they have fewer natural objects there, to employ their attention&mdash;or admiration: likewi&s;e becau&s;e one vicious character tends to encourage and keep another in coun|tenance.

<P>A per&s;on's right to re&s;i&s;t, depends upon a conviction, that the government is ill-managed; that others have more claim to manage it, or will admini&s;ter it better: that he, by his re&s;i&s;tance, can introduce a change to its advantage, and this without any con&s;equential evils that will bear proportion to the &s;aid advantage.</P>

XXVII. What plea&s;ure it is to pay ones debts! I remember to have heard Sir T. Lyttleton make the &s;ame ob&s;ervation. It &s;eems to flow from a combination of circum&s;tances, each of which is productive of plea&s;ure. In the fir&s;t place, it removes that unea&s;ine&s;s, which a true &s;pirit feels from dependence and obligation. It affords plea|&s;ure to the creditor, and therefore gratifies our &s;ocial affection: it promotes that future confidence, which is &s;o very intere&s;ting to an hone&s;t mind: it opens a pro&s;pect of being readily &s;upplied with what we want on future occa&s;ions: it leaves a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own virtue: and it is a mea&s;ure we know to be right, both in point of ju&s;tice and of &s;ound oeconomy. Finally, it is a main &s;upport of &s;imple reputation.</P>

And this may be be&s;t effected by bringing over &s;ome of one's enemies; by which means one is a gainer, having the &s;ame number of friends at lea&s;t, if not an enemy the le&s;s. Such a method of proceeding, &s;hould, I think, be as regularly ob&s;erved, as the di&s;tribution of vacant ribbons, upon the death of knights of the garter.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. It has been a maxim with me to admit of an ea&s;y re|conciliation with a per&s;on, who&s;e offence proceeded from no depravity of heart: but where I was convinced it did &s;o, to forego, for my own &s;ake, all opportunities of re|venge: to forget the per&s;ons of my enemies as much as I was able, and to call to remembrance, in their place, the more plea&s;ing idea of my friends.

XXX. I have been formerly &s;o &s;illy as to hope, that, every &s;ervant I had might be made a friend: I am now con|vinced that the nature of &s;ervitude generally bears a contrary tendency. Peoples characters are to be chiefly collected from their education and place in life: birth it&s;elf does but little. Kings in general are born with the &s;ame propen&s;ities as other men; but yet it is pro|bable, that from the licence and flattery that attends their education, that they will be more haughty, more luxurious, and more &s;ubjected to their pa&s;&s;ions, than any men be&s;ide. I que&s;tion not but there are many at|torneys born with open and hone&s;t hearts: but I know not one, that has had the lea&s;t practice, who is not &s;elfi&s;h, tricki&s;h, and di&s;ingenuous. So it is the nature of &s;ervitude to di&s;card all generous motives of obedi|ence; and to point out no other than tho&s;e &s;coundrel ones of intere&s;t and fear. There are however &s;ome ex|ceptions to this rule, which I know by my own ex|perience.</P>

<P N="7">VII. Love can be founded upon nature only; or the ap|pearance of it&mdash;For this rea&s;on, however a peruke may tend to &s;often the human features, it can very &s;eldom make amends for the mixture of artifice which it di&s;|covers.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. A rich dre&s;s adds but little to the beauty of a per&s;on. It may po&s;&s;ibly create a deference, but that is rather an enemy to love:</P>
<Q><L>"Non ben&egrave; conveniunt nec in una &s;ede morantur</L>
<L>"Maje&s;tas &amp; amor."</L>
<P>OVID.</P></Q>
<P N="9">IX. Simplicity can &s;carce be carried too far: provided it be not &s;o &s;ingular as to excite a degree of ridicule. The &s;ame caution may be requi&s;ite in regard to the value of your dre&s;s: though &s;plendor be not nece&s;&s;ary, you mu&s;t remove all appearance of poverty: the ladies being rarely enough &s;agacious to acknowledge beauty through
<PB N="86" REF="95">
the di&s;gui&s;e of poverty. Indeed, I believe &s;ometimes they mi&s;take grandeur of dre&s;s, for beauty of per&s;on.</P>
<P N="10">X. A per&s;on's manner is never ea&s;y, whil&s;t he feels a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he is fine. The country-fellow, con&s;ider|ed in &s;ome lights, appears genteel; but it is not when be is dre&s;&s;ed on Sundays, with a large no&s;e-gay in his bo&s;om. It is when he is reaping, making hay, or when he is hedging in his hurden frock. It is then he acts with ea&s;e, and thinks him&s;elf equal to his apparel.</P>
<P N="11">XI. When a man has run all lengths him&s;elf with regard to dre&s;s, there is but one means remaining, which can add to his appearance. And this con&s;i&s;ts in having re|cour&s;e to the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s of his own apparel, and at the &s;ame time richly garni&s;hing his footman or his hor&s;e. Let the &s;ervant appear as fine as ever you plea&s;e, the world mu&s;t always con&s;ider the ma&s;ter as his &s;upe|rior. And this is that peculiar excellence &s;o much ad|mired in the be&s;t painters as well as poets; Raphael as well as Virgil: where &s;omewhat is left to be &s;up|plied by the &s;pectator's and reader's imagination.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Methinks, apparel &s;hould be rich in the &s;ame propor|tion as it is gay: it otherwi&s;e carries the appearance of &s;omewhat un&s;ub&s;tantial: in other words, of a greater de&s;ire than ability to make a figure.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Per&s;ons are oftentimes mi&s;led in regard to their choice of dre&s;s, by attending to the beauty of colours, rather than &s;electing &s;uch colours as may encrea&s;e their own beauty.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. I cannot &s;ee why a per&s;on &s;hould be e&s;teemed haughty, on account of his ta&s;te for fiue cloaths; any more than
<PB N="87" REF="96">
one who di&s;covers a fondne&s;s for birds, flowers, moths, or butterflies. Imagination influences both to &s;eek amu&s;ement in glowing colours; only the former endeav|ours to give them a nearer relation to him&s;elf. It ap|pears to me, that a per&s;on may love &s;plendor without any degree of pride; which is never connected with this ta&s;te but when a per&s;on demands homage on account of the finery he exhibits. Then it cea&s;es to be ta&s;te, and commences mere ambition. Yet the world is not enough candid to make this e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The fir&s;t in&s;tance an officer gives you of his courage, con&s;i&s;ts in waring cloaths infinitely &s;uperior to his rank.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Men of quality never appear more amiable than when their dre&s;s is plain. Their birth, rank, title, and its appendages, are at be&s;t invidious; and as they do not need the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of dre&s;s, &s;o, by their di&s;claiming the advantage of it, they make their &s;uperiority &s;it more ea&s;y. It is otherwi&s;e with &s;uch as depend alone on per&s;onal merit; and it was from-hence, I pre&s;ume, that Quin a&s;&s;erted he could not afford to go plain.</P>
<P N="17">XXVII. There are certain &s;hapes and phy&s;iognomies, of &s;o entirely vulgar a ca&s;t, that they could &s;carce win re&s;pect even in the country, though they were embelli&s;hed with a dre&s;s as tawdry as a pulpit-cloth.</P>
<P N="18">XXVIII. A large retinue upon a &s;mall income, like a large ea&s;cade upon a &s;mall &s;tream, tends to di&s;cover its tenuity.</P>

<P N="20">XX. The lowe&s;t people are generally the fir&s;t to find fault with &s;hew or equipage; e&s;pecially that of a per&s;on lately emerged from his ob&s;curity. They never once con&s;ider that he is breaking the ice for them&s;elves.</P>

VII. There is no word in the Latin language, that &s;ignifies a female friend. "Amica" means a mi&s;tre&s;s: and perhaps there is no friend&s;hip betwixt the &s;exes wholly di&s;united from a degree of love.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The chief advantage that ancient writers can boa&s;t over modern ones, &s;eems owing to &s;implicity. Every noble truth and &s;entiment was expre&s;&s;ed by the former in the natural manner; in word and phra&s;e, &s;imple, per|&s;picuous, and incapable of improvement. What then remained for later writers but affectation, witticifm, and conceit?</P>
<P N="9">IX. One can, now and then, reach an author's head when he &s;$$ops; and, induced by this circum&s;tance, a&s;pire to mea&s;ure height with him.</P>
<P N="10">X. The national opinion of a book or treati&s;e is not al|ways right&mdash;"e&s;t ubi peccat."&mdash;Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t is one in&s;tance. I mean, the cold reception it met with at fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Perhaps, an acquaintance with men of genius is ra|ther reputable than &s;atisfactory. It is as unaccount|able, as it is certain, that-fancy heightens &s;en&s;ibility; &s;en&s;ibility &s;trengthens pa&s;&s;ion; and pa&s;&s;ion makes people humouri&s;ts.</P>
<P>Yet a per&s;on of genius is often expected to &s;hew more di&s;cretion than another man; and this on account of that very vivacity, which is his greate&s;t impediment. This happens for want of di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt the fanciful talents and the dry mathematical operations of the judgement, each of which indi&s;criminately give the de|nomination of a man of genius.</P>

<P N="25">XXV. The writer who gives us the be&s;t idea of what may be called the genteel in &s;tyle and manner of writing, is, in my opinion, my Lord Shafte&s;bury. Then Mr. Ad|di&s;on and Dr. Swift.</P>

<P>I think nothing truly poetic, at lea&s;t no poetry worth compo&s;ing, that does not &s;trongly affect one's pa&s;&s;ions: and this is but &s;lenderly effected by fables,</P>

<P N="27">XXVII. A preface very frequently contains &s;uch a piece of critici&s;m, as tends to countenance and e&s;tabli&s;h the pecu|liarities of the piece.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. I hate a &s;tyle, as I do a garden, that is wholly flat and regular; that &s;lides along like an eel, and never ri&s;es to what one can call an inequality.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. It is obvious to di&s;cover that imperfections of one kind have a vi&s;ible tendency to produce perfections of another. Mr. Pope's bodily di&s;advantages mu&s;t incline him to a more laborious cultivation of his talent, with|out which he fore&s;aw that he mu&s;t have langui&s;hed in ob&s;curity. The advantages of per&s;on are a good deal e&s;&s;ential to popularity in the grave world as well as the gay. Mr. Pope, by an unwearied application to poetry, became not only the favourite of the learned, but al&s;o of the ladies.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. Pope, I think, never once mentions Prior; though Prior &s;peaks &s;o hand&s;omely of Pope in his Alma. One might imagine that the latter, indebted as he was to the former for &s;uch numberle&s;s beauties, &s;hould have readily repaid this poetical obligation. This can only
<PB N="93" REF="102">
be imputed to pride or party-cunning. In other words, to &s;ome modification of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. Virgil never mentions Horace, though indebted to him for two very well-natured compliments.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. Pope feems to me the mo&s;t correct writer &s;ince Virgil; the greate&s;t genius only, &s;ince Dryden.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. No one was ever more fortunate than Mr. Pope in a judicious choice of his poetical &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. Pope's talent lay remarkably in what one may natu|rally enough term the conden&s;ation of thoughts. I think, no other Engli&s;h poet ever brought &s;o much &s;en&s;e into the &s;ame number of lines with equal &s;moothne&s;s, ea&s;e, and poetical beauty. Let him who doubts of this peru&s;e his E&s;&s;ay on Man with attention. Perhaps, this was a talent from which he could not ea&s;ily have &s;werv|ed: perhaps, he could not have &s;ufficiently rarefied his thoughts to produce that flimzine&s;s which is required in a ballad or love-&s;ong. His mon&s;ter of Ragu&s;a and his tran&s;lations from Chaucer have &s;ome little tendency to invalidate this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. I dur&s;t not have cen&s;ured Mr. Pope's writings in his life-time, you &s;ay. True. A writer &s;urrounded with all his fame, engaging with another that is hardly known, is a man in armour attacking another in his night-gown and &s;lippers.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. Pope's religion is often found very advantageous to his de&s;criptive talents, as it is no doubt embelli&s;hed with

the mo&s;t pompous &s;cenes and o&s;tentatious imagery: for in&s;tance,</P>
<Q>"When from the cen&s;er clouds of, &amp;c."</Q>
<P N="37">XXXVII. Pope has made the utmo&s;t advantage of alliteration, re|gulating it by the pau&s;e with the utmo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s:</P>
<Q>"Die and endow a college or a cat," &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
<P>It is an ea&s;y kind of beaty. Dryden &s;eems to have borrowed it from Spen&s;er.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Pope has publi&s;hed fewer foibles than any other poet that is equally voluminous.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. It is no doubt extremely po&s;&s;ible to form an Engli&s;h pro&s;ody; but to a good ear it were almo&s;t &s;uperfluous, and to a bad one u&s;ele&s;s; this la&s;t being, I believe, never joined with a poetic genius. It may be joined with wit; it may be connected with &s;ound judgement: but is &s;urely never united with ta&s;te, which is the life and foul of poetry.</P>
<P N="40">XL. Rhymes, in elegant poetry, &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;yllables that are long in pronunciation: <Q>&s;uch as &startq;are, ear, ire, ore, your;&endq;</Q> in which a nice ear will find more agree|ablene&s;s than in the&s;e "gnat, net, knit, knot, nut."</P>

<Q>"And pikes, the tyrants of the watry plains."</Q>

Pope (who has improved our ver&s;ification through a ju|dicious di&s;po&s;ition of the pau&s;e) &s;eems not enough aware of this beauty.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. As to the &s;requent u&s;e of alliteration, it has probably had its day.</P>

<P N="44">XLIV. There are numbers in the world, who do not want &s;en&s;e, to make a figure; &s;o much as an opinion of their own abilities, to put them upon recording their ob&s;erv|ations, and allowing them the &s;ame importance which they do to tho&s;e which others print.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. A good writer cannot with the utmo&s;t &s;tudy produce &s;ome thoughts, which will flow from a bad one with ea&s;e and precipitation. The rever&s;e is al&s;o true. A bad writer, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. "Great wits have &s;hort memories" is a proverb; and as &s;uch has undoubtedly &s;ome foundation in nature. The ca&s;e &s;eems to be, that men of genius forget things of common concern, unimportant facts and circum&s;tances,
<PB N="96" REF="105">
which make no &s;light impre&s;&s;ion in every day minds. But &s;ure it will be found that all wit depends on memory; i. e. on the recollection of pa&s;&s;ages, either to illu&s;trate or contra&s;t with any pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It is probably the fate of a common under&s;tanding to forget the very things which the man of wit remembers. But an oblivion of tho&s;e things which almo&s;t every one remembers renders his ca&s;e the more remarkable, and this explains the my&s;tery.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. Prudes allow no quarter to &s;uch ladies as have fallen a &s;acrifice to the gentle pa&s;&s;ions; either becau&s;e them|&s;elves, being born away by the malignant ones, perhaps never felt the other &s;o powerful as to occa&s;ion them any difficulty; or becau&s;e no one has tempted them to tran&s;|gre&s;s that way them&s;elves.

LIX. The plan of Spencer's Fairy-queen appears to me very imperfect. His imagination, though very exten|&s;ive, yet &s;omewhat le&s;s &s;o, perhaps, than is generally allowed; if one con&s;iders the facility of realizing and equipping forth the virtues and vices. His metre has &s;ome advantages, though, in many re&s;pects, exception|able. His good-nature is vi&s;ible through every part of his poem. His conjunction of the pagan and chri&s;tian &s;cheme (as he introduces the deities of both acting &s;imultaneou&s;ly) wholly inexcu&s;able. Much art and judgement are di&s;covered in parts, and but little in the whole. One may entertain &s;ome doubt whether the peru&s;al of his mon&s;trous de&s;criptions be not as pre|judicial to true ta&s;te, as it is advantageous to the extent of imagination. Spencer, to be &s;ure, expands the la&s;t; but then he expands it beyond its due limits. After all, there are many favourite pa&s;&s;ages in his Fairy|queen, which will be in&s;tances of a great and cultivated genius mi&s;applied.</P>
<P N="60">LX. A poet, that fails in writing, becomes often a moro&s;e critic. The weak and in&s;ipid white wine makes at length excellent vinegar.</P>
<P N="61">LXI. People of fortune, perhaps, covet the acquaintance of e&s;tabli&s;hed writers, not &s;o much upon account of the &s;ocial plea&s;ure, as the credit of it: The former would induce them to chu&s;e per&s;ons of le&s;s capacities, and tempers more conformable.</P>
<P N="62">LXII. Language is to the under&s;tanding what a genteel motion is to the body; a very great advantage. But a per&s;on may be &s;uperior to another in under&s;tanding, that has not an equal dignity of expre&s;&s;ion; and a man may boa&s;t an hand&s;omer figure, that is inferior to another in regard to motion.</P>
<P N="63"><PB N="99" REF="108">
LXIII. The words "no more" have a &s;ingular pathos; re|minding us at once of pa&s;t plea&s;ure and the future ex|clu&s;ion of it.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. Every &s;ingle ob&s;ervation that is publi&s;hed by a man of genius, be it ever &s;o trivial, &s;hould be e&s;teemed of importance; becau&s;e he &s;peaks from his own impre&s;&s;ions; whereas common men publi&s;h common things, which they have, perhaps, gleaned from frivolous writers.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. It is providential that our affection dimini&s;hes in pro|portion as our friends power encrea&s;es. Affection is of le&s;s importance whenever a per&s;on can &s;upport him&s;elf.

<P>One feels the &s;ame kind of di&s;gu&s;t in reading Roman hi&s;tory, which one does in novels, or even epic poetry. We too ea&s;ily fore&s;ee to whom the victory will fall. The hero, the knight-errant, and the Roman, are too &s;eldom overcome.</P>

<P>There is an important om&iuml;&s;&s;ion in mo&s;t of our gram|mar-&s;chools, through which what we read, either of fa|bulous or real hi&s;tory, leaves either faint or confu&s;ed impre&s;&s;ions.

<P>Boileau has endeavoured to prove, in one of his ad|mirable &s;atires, that man has no manner of pretence to prefer his faculties before tho&s;e of the brute creation. Oldham has tran&s;lated him: my Lord Roche&s;ter has imi|tated him: and even Mr. Pope declares,</P>

<P>Indeed, the E&s;&s;ay on Man abounds with illu&s;trations of this maxim; and it is amazing to find how many plau&s;ible rea&s;ons may be urged to &s;upport it. It &s;eems evident that our itch of rea&s;oning, and &s;pirit of cu|rio&s;ity, precludes more happine&s;s than it can po&s;&s;ibly ad|vance. What numbers of di&s;ea&s;es are entirely artificial things, far from the ability of a brute to contrive! We di&s;reli&s;h and deny our&s;elves cheap and natural gratifica|tions, through &s;peculative pre&s;ciences and doubts about the future. We cannot di&s;cover the de&s;igns of our Creator. We &s;hould learn then of brutes to be ea&s;y under our ignorance, and happy in tho&s;e objects that &s;eem intended, obviou&s;ly, for our happine&s;s: not over|look the flowers of the garden, and fooli&s;hly perplex our&s;elves with the intricacies of the labyrinth.</P>

<P>Livy, the mo&s;t elegant and principal of the Roman hi&s;torians, was, perhaps, as &s;uper&s;titious as the mo&s;t unlearned plebeian.

<P>There is a &s;ort of r$a&s;onry in poetry, wherein the pau&s;e repre&s;ents the joints of building; which ought in every line and cour&s;e to have their di&s;po&s;ition varied.</P>
<P>The difference betwixt a witty writer and a writer of ta&s;te is chiefly this. The former is negligent what ideas he introduces, &s;o he joins them &s;urpri&s;ingly&mdash;The latter is principally careful what images he introduces, and &s;tudies &s;implicity rather than &s;urprize in his manner of introduction.</P>
<P>It may in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for the difference of ta&s;te in the reading of books, to con&s;ider the difference of our ears for mu&s;ic. One is not plea&s;ed without a perfect melody of &s;tyle, be the &s;en&s;e what it will: an|other,
<PB N="108" REF="117">
of no ear for mu&s;ic, gives to &s;en&s;e its full weight without any deduction on account of har&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Harmony of period and melody of &s;tyle have greater weight than is generally imagined in the judgement we pa&s;s upon writing and writers. As a proof of this, let us reflect, what texts of &s;cripture, what lines in poetry, or what periods we mo&s;t remember and quote, either in ver&s;e or pro&s;e, and we &s;hall find them to be only mu&s;ical ones.</P>
<P>I wonder the ancient mythology never &s;hews Apollo enamoured of Venus; con&s;idering the remarkable de|ference that wit has paid to beauty in all ages.

<P>What is termed humour in pro&s;e, I conceive, would be con&s;idered as burle&s;que in poetry: of which in|&s;tances may be given.</P>
<P>Perhaps, burle&s;que may be divided into &s;uch as turns chiefly upon the thought, and &s;uch as depends more upon the expre&s;&s;ion: or we may add a third kind, con&s;i&s;ting in thoughts ridiculou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed in language much above or below their dignity.</P>
<P>The Splendid Shilling of Mr. Philips, and the H$|dibras of Butler, are the mo&s;t obvious in&s;tances. But|ler, however, depended much upon the ludicrous effect of his double rhymes. In other re&s;pects, to declare my own &s;entiments, he is rather a witty writer than a hu|mourous one.</P>
<P>Scenes below ver&s;e, merely ver&s;i&s;ied, lay claim to a degree of humour.</P>
<P>Swift in poetry de&s;erves a place &s;omewhere betwixt Butler and Horace. He has the wit of the former, and the graceful negligence which we find in the latter's epi&s;tles and &s;atires. I believe, few people di&s;cover le&s;s humour in Don Quixote than my&s;elf. For be&s;ide the general &s;amene&s;s of adventure, whereby it is ea&s;y to

One &s;carce &s;ees how it is po&s;&s;ible for a country girl or a country fellow to pre&s;erve their cha&s;tity.

I have known a &s;en&s;ible man of opinion that one &s;hould not be &s;olicitous about a wife's under&s;tanding. A woman's &s;en&s;e was with him a phra&s;e to expre&s;s a de|gree of knowledge, which was likely $o contribute mighty little to a hu&s;band's happine&s;s. I cannot be of his opinion. I am convinced, that as judgement is the portion of our &s;ex, &s;o fancy and imagination are more eminently the lot of theirs. If &s;o, after hone&s;ty of heart, what is there we &s;hould &s;o much require? A wife's beauty will &s;oon decay, it is doubtful whether in reality fir&s;t, or in our own opinion. Either of the&s;e is &s;ufficient to pall the raptures of enjoyment. We are then to &s;eek for &s;omethin$ that will retain its novelty; or, what is equivalent, will change its &s;hape when her per|&s;on palls by its identity. Fancy and genius bid faire&s;t for this, which have as many &s;hapes, as there can hap|pen occa&s;ions to exert them. Good-nature, I always &s;uppo&s;e.

<P>Reconciliation is the tendere&s;t part either of friend&s;hip or of love; the latter more e&s;pecially, in which the &s;oul is more remarkably &s;oftened.

To judge whether one has &s;ufficient plea&s;ure to render the continuation of life agreeable, it is not enough to &s;ay, Would you die? Take away fir&s;t, the hope of bet|ter &s;cenes in this life, the fears of wor&s;e in another, and the bodily pain of dying.</P>
<P>The fear of death &s;eems as natural, as the &s;en&s;ation of lu&s;t or of hunger: the fir&s;t and la&s;t, for the pre&s;ervation of the individual; the other, for the continuation of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>It &s;eems obvious that God, who created the world, intends the happine&s;s and perfection of the &s;y&s;tem he created. To effect the happine&s;s of the whole, &s;elf-love, in its degree, is as requi&s;ite as &s;ocial; for I am my&s;elf a part of that whole, as well as another. The difficulty of a&s;certaining what is virtue, lies in proportioning the degrees of &s;elf-love and &s;ocial. "Proximus &s;um egomet mihi."&mdash;"Tunica pallio pro|prior."&mdash;"Charity begins at home." It is &s;o. It ought to be &s;o; nor is there any inconvenience ari&s;es to the public, becau&s;e it is general. Were this away, the individual mu&s;t &s;oon peri&s;h, and con&s;equently the whole body. A man has every moment occa&s;ion to exert his &s;elf-love for the &s;ake of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; con&s;equently this ought to be &s;tronger, in order to keep him upon his guard. A centinel's attention &s;hould be greater than that of a &s;oldier on a review.</P>
<P>The &s;ocial, though alike con&s;tant, is not equally in|ten&s;e; becau&s;e the &s;elfi&s;h, being univer&s;al, renders the &s;ocial le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of one's neighbour. In &s;hort, the &s;elf-love and the &s;ocial ought to bear &s;uch proportion as we find they generally do. If the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t preponderate, it would be &s;elf-de|&s;tructive in a few individuals to be over-&s;ocially di&s;|po&s;ed.

<P>Deference is the mo&s;t complicate, the mo&s;t indirect, and the mo&s;t elegant of all compliments.</P>
<P>Be cautious not to con&s;ider a per&s;on as your &s;uperior, merely becau&s;e he is your &s;uperior in the point of a&s;&s;ur|ance. This has often depre&s;&s;ed the &s;pirit of a per&s;on of de&s;ert and diffidence.</P>

<P>Deference, before company, is the genteele&s;t kind of flattery. The flattery of epi&s;tles affects one le&s;s, as they cannot be &s;hewn without an appearance of vanity. Flattery of the verbal kind is gro&s;s. In &s;hort, applau&s;e is of too coar&s;e a nature to be &s;wallowed in the gro&s;s&mdash;though the extract or tincture be ever &s;o agreeable.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on, for a &s;plendid &s;ervitude, foregoes an humble independency, it may be called an advancement, if you plea&s;e: but it appears to me an advancement from the pit to the gallery. Liberty is a more invigor|ating cordial than tokay.</P>

them&mdash;Indeed it is almo&s;t an univer&s;al practice to rail at punctilio; and it &s;eems in &s;ome mea&s;ure a con&s;equence of our attachment to French fa&s;hions.

Were all men rational and civilized, the u&s;e of ceremony would be &s;uperfluous: but as the ca&s;e is, it at lea&s;t fixes &s;ome bounds to the encroachments of eccentric people, who, under the de|nomination of freedom, might demand the privilege of breaking your head.</P>

<P>People of real genius have &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions; people of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions have great partialities; &s;uch as Mr. Pope for Lord Bolingbroke, &amp;c.

The faults of the former &s;hould be balanced with their excellencies: and the blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the latter &s;hould be weighed with their in&s;ignificancy.

The bee to collect honey, or the &s;pider to gather poi&s;on, mu&s;t abide &s;ome time upon the weed or flower. They who&s;e fluids are mere &s;al volatile, &s;eem rather cheerful than happy men.

<P>The term indeci&s;ion, in a man's character, implies an idea very nicely different from that of irre&s;olution: yet it has a tendency to produce it; and, like that, has often its original in exce&s;&s;ive delicacy and refinement.</P>

<P>E$$eminacy of appearance, and an exce&s;&s;ive attention to the minuter parts of dre&s;s, is, I believe, properly, in the general run, e&s;teemed a &s;ymptom of irre&s;olution. But, yet, in&s;tances are &s;een to abound in the French na|tion to the contrary. And in our own, that of Lord Mark Kerr was an in&s;tance equal to a thou&s;and. A &s;nuff-box hinge, rendered invi&s;ible, was an object on which his happine&s;s appeared to turn; which, however, might be clouded by a &s;peck of dirt, or wounded by a hole in the heel of his &s;tocking. Yet this man's intre|pidity was &s;hewn beyond all contradiction. What &s;hall we &s;ay then of Mr. Gray, of manners very delicate, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a poetical vein fraught with the noble&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t images, and of a mind remarkably well &s;tored with the more ma&s;culine parts of learning?&mdash;Here, per|haps, we mu&s;t remain in &s;u&s;pence&mdash;For though ta&s;te does not imply manners, &s;o neither does it preclude them: or what hinders, that a man &s;hould feel that &s;ame delicacy in regard to real honour, which he does in regard to dre&s;s?</P>
<P>If beneficence be not in a per&s;on's will, what imports it to mankind, that it is ever &s;o much in his power? And yet we &s;ee how much more regard is generally paid to a worthle&s;s man of fortune, than to the mo&s;t benevo|lent beggar that ever uttered an ineffectual ble&s;&s;ing. It is all agreeable to Mr. Burke's the&s;is, that the formid|able idea of power affects more deeply than the mo&s;t beautiful image we can conceive of moral virtue.</P>

Both the&s;e have the &s;ame motive to im|pre&s;s a dread upon our enemies of injuring us for the the future: and though the world be more inclined to favour the ra&s;h than the phlegmatic enemy, it is hard to &s;ay which of the two has given ri&s;e to more di&s;mal con|&s;equences&mdash;The rea&s;on of this partiality may be deduced from the &s;ame original, as the preference that is given to down-right impudence before hypocri&s;y. To be cheat|ed into an ill-placed e&s;teem, or to be undermined by concealed malignity, di&s;covers a contempt for our un|der&s;tanding, and le&s;&s;ens the idea we entertain of it our|&s;elves. They hurt our pride more than open violence, or undi&s;gui&s;ed impudence.</P>
<P><Q>King James the Fir&s;t, willing to involve the regal power in my&s;tery, that, like natural objects, it might appear greater through the fog, declared it pre&s;umption for a &s;ubject to &s;ay, &startq;what a king might do in the fullne&s;s of his power.&endq;</Q>&mdash;This was ab&s;urd; but it &s;eems pre&s;umption in a man of the world, to &s;ay what means a man of genius may think in&s;trumental to his happine&s;s.

<P>The apparatus of a funeral among the middle rank of people, and &s;ometimes among the great, has one ef|fect that is not frivolous.

Weaker minds find a &s;ort of relief in being compelled to give directions about the manner of in|terment: and the great &s;olemnity of the hear&s;e, plumes, and e&s;cutcheons, though they add to the force of terror, dimini&s;h that of &s;imple grief.</P>

There are &s;ome people whom you cannot regard, though they &s;eem de&s;irous to oblige you; nay, even though they do you actual &s;ervices.

<P>When a tree is falling, I have &s;een the labourers, by a trivial jerk with a rope, throw it upon the &s;pot where they would wi&s;h it &s;hould lie.

<P>The word "R$ligio" among&s;t the Romans, and the word "Church" among the Chri&s;tians, &s;eem to have more interpretations than almo&s;t any other. <Q>&startq;Malus procidit, e&acirc; religione moti.&endq;</Q>&mdash;Livy, p. 1150 vol.

<P>How ready have all nations been, after having allowed a proper portion of land and prai&s;e to their own abili|ties, to attribute their &s;ucce&s;s in war to the peculiar fa|vour of a ju&s;t Providence! Perhaps, this con&s;truction, as it is often applied, argues more of pre&s;umption than gratitude. In the fir&s;t place, &s;uch is the partiality of the human heart, that, perhaps, two ho&s;tile nations may alike rely upon the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e; and which of the two has the better claim to it, none but Providence can it&s;elf di&s;cover. In the next, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that &s;ucce&s;s by no means demon&s;trates ju&s;tice. Again, we mu&s;t not wholly forget to con&s;ider, that &s;ucce&s;s may be no more than a means of de&s;truction. And la&s;tly, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s to be really and ab&s;olutely good, do we find that individuals are always favoured with it in proportion to their de&s;ert; and if not individuals, why mu&s;t we then &s;uppo&s;e it to be the uniform recompence of &s;ociety?</P>
<P>It is often given as a rea&s;on why it is incumbent on God Almighty's ju&s;tice, to puni&s;h or reward &s;ocieties in this world, becau&s;e, hereafter, they cannot be puni&s;hed or rewarded, on account of their de&s;olation. It is, in|deed, true that human vengeance mu&s;t act frequently in the gro&s;s; and whenever a government declares war again&s;t a foreign &s;ociety, or finds it needful to cha&s;ti&s;e any part of its own, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity involve &s;ome inno|cent individuals, with the guilty. But it does not ap|pear &s;o evident, that an omni&s;cient and omnipotent Being, who knows the &s;ecrets of all hearts, and is able to make a di&s;tinction in his puni&s;hments, will judge his unhappy creatures by the&s;e indi&s;criminate and imperfect laws.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="173">
Societies then are to be con&s;idered as the ca&s;ual or ar|bitrary a&s;&s;ortments of human in&s;titution. To &s;uppo&s;e that God Almighty will, by means of puni&s;hments, often called judgements, de&s;troy them promi&s;cuou&s;ly, is to &s;uppo&s;e that he will regulate his government accord|ing to the cabals of human wi&s;dom. I mean to be un|der&s;tood here, with regard to what are called judgements, or, in other words, praeternatural interpo&s;itions of Pro|vidence. In a natural way, the con&s;titution of the uni|ver&s;e requires, that the good mu&s;t often &s;uffer with the bad part of &s;ociety. But in regard to judgements upon whole bodies (which we have days appointed to depre|cate) let us introduce a ca&s;e, which may &s;erve to il|lu&s;trate the improbability.</P>
<P>Societies, I &s;uppo&s;e then, are not divine, but human bundles.</P>
<P>Imagine a man to mix a large quantity of &s;and and gunpowder; then parcel out the compo&s;ition into dif|ferent heaps, and apply fire to them &s;eparately.

</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>There is hardly any thing &s;o uncommon, as a true native ta&s;te improved by education.</P>
<P>The object of ta&s;te is corporeal beauty; for though there is manife&s;tly a <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; a "pulchrum," an "hone&s;tum," and "decorum," in moral actions; and although a man of ta&s;te that is not virtuous commits a greater violence upon his &s;entiments than any other per|&s;on; yet, in the ordinary cour&s;e of &s;peaking, a per&s;on is not termed a man of ta&s;te, merely becau&s;e he is a man of virtue.</P>
<P>All beauty may be divided into ab&s;olute and relative, and what is compounded of both.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to hear a modern Quixote in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;uperiority of his idol or Dulcinea; and, not con|tent to pay his own tribute of adoration, demand that of others in favour of her accompli&s;hments. Tho&s;e of grave and &s;ober &s;en&s;e cannot avoid wondering at a dif|ference of opinions, which are in truth &s;upported by no criterion.</P>
<P>Every one, therefore, ought to fix &s;ome mea&s;ure of beauty, before he grows eloquent upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Every thing &s;eems to derive its preten&s;ions to beauty, on account of its colour, &s;moothne&s;s, variety, uniformi|ty, partial re&s;emblance to &s;omething el&s;e, proportion, or &s;uitablene&s;s to the end propo&s;ed, &s;ome connection of ideas, or a mixture of all the&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the beauty of colours, their pre&s;ent effect &s;eems in proportion to their impul&s;e; and &s;carlet, were it not
<PB N="161" REF="178">
for habit, would affect an Indian before all other co|lours.</P>
<P>Re&s;emblances wrought by art; pictures, bu&s;tos, &s;ta|tues, plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Columns, proportioned to their incumbent weight; but herein we &s;uppo&s;e homogeneous materials; it is other|wi&s;e, in ca&s;e we know that a column is made of iron.</P>
<P>Habit, herein, &s;eems to have an influence to which we can a&s;&s;ix no bounds. Suppo&s;e the generality of man|kind formed with a mouth from ear to ear, and that it were requi&s;ite in point of re&s;piration, would not the pre&s;ent make of mouths have &s;ubjected a man to the name of Bocha Chica?</P>
<P>It is probable, that a clown would require more co|lour in his Chloe's face, than a courtier.</P>
<P>We may &s;ee daily the &s;trange effects of habit, in re|&s;pect of fa&s;hion. To what colours, or proportions, does it not reconcile us!</P>
<P>Conceit is fal&s;e ta&s;te; and very widely different from no ta&s;te at all.</P>
<P>Beauty of per&s;on &s;hould, perhaps, be e&s;timated ac|cording to the proportion it bears to &s;uch a make and features as are mo&s;t likely to produce the love of the op|po&s;ite &s;ex. The look of dignity, the look of wi&s;dom, the look of delicacy and refinement, &s;eem in &s;ome mea|&s;ure foreign. Perhaps, the appearance of &s;en&s;ibility may be one ingredient; and that of health, another. At lea&s;t, a cadaverous countenance is the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting in the world.</P>
<P>I know not, if one rea&s;on of the different opinions concerning beauty be not owing to &s;elf-love. People are apt to form &s;ome criterion, from their own per&s;ons, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. A tall per&s;on approves the look of a fo|lio or octavo: a &s;quare thick-&s;et man is more delighted with a quarto. This in&s;tance, at lea&s;t, may &s;erve to explain what I intend.</P>
<P>I believe, it &s;ometimes happens that a per&s;on may have what the arti&s;ts call an ear and an eye, without ta&s;te: for in&s;tance, a man may &s;ometimes have a quick|ne$s in di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;imilitude or difference of lines
<PB N="162" REF="179">
and &s;ounds, without any &s;kill to give the proper pre|ference betwixt the combinations of them.</P>
<P>Ta&s;te produces different effects upon different com|plexions. It con&s;i&s;ts, as I have often ob&s;erved, in the appetite and the di&s;cernment; then mo&s;t properly &s;o called, when they are united in equal proportions.</P>
<P>Where the di&s;cernment is predominant, a per&s;on is plea&s;ed with fewer objects, and requires perfection in what he &s;ees. Where the appetite prevails, he is &s;o much attached to beauty, that he feels a gratification in every degree in which it is manife&s;ted. I frankly own my&s;elf to be of this latter cla&s;s: I love painting and &s;ta|tuary &s;o well, as to be not undelighted with moderate performances.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on people vary in their opinions of a portrait, I mean with regard to the re&s;emblance it bears to the original, &s;eems no other than that they lay &s;tre&s;s on dif|ferent features in the original; and this different &s;tre&s;s is owing to different complexions of mind.</P>
<P>People of little or no ta&s;te commend a per&s;on for its corpulency. I cannot &s;ee, why an excre&s;cence of belly, cheek, or chin, &s;hould be deemed more beautiful th$n a wen on any other part of the body. Through a con|nexion of ideas, it may form the beauty of a pig or an ox.</P>
<P>There &s;eems a pretty exact analogy between the ob|jects and the &s;en&s;es. Some tunes, &s;ome ta&s;tes, &s;ome vi|&s;ible objects, plea&s;e at fir&s;t, and that only; others only, by degrees, and then long&mdash;(Ra&s;pberry-jelly&mdash;Green|tea&mdash;Alley-Croaker&mdash;Air in Ariadne&mdash;a Baron's Robe&mdash;and a Bi&s;hop's Lawn.) Perhaps, &s;ome of the&s;e in|&s;tances may be ill enough cho&s;en; but the thing is true.</P>
<P>Tunes, with words, plea&s;e me the more in proportion as they approach nearer to the natural accent of the words to which they are a&s;&s;igned. Scotch tunes often end high: their language does the &s;ame.</P>
<P>To how very great a degree the appearance of health alone is beauty, I am not able to determine. I pre&s;ume the mo&s;t regular and well-proportioned form of limbs and features is at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t healthful one:
<PB N="163" REF="180">
the &s;itte&s;t to perform the functions and operations of the body. If &s;o, a perfectly healthful form is a perfectly beautiful form&mdash;Health is beauty, and the mo&s;t perfect health is the mo&s;t perfect beauty. To have recour&s;e to experience: the mo&s;t &s;ickly and cadaverous countenance is the lea&s;t provocative to love; or rather the mo&s;t in|con&s;i&s;tent with it. A florid look, to appear beautiful, mu&s;t be the bloom of health, and not the glow of a fever.</P>
<P>An obvious connection may be traced betwixt moral and phy&s;ical beauty; the love of &s;ymmetry and the love of virtue; an elegant ta&s;te and perfect hone&s;ty. We may, we mu&s;t, ri&s;e from the love of natural to that of moral beauty: &s;uch is the conclu&s;ion of Plato, and of my Lord Shafte&s;bury.</P>
<P>Wherever there is a want of ta&s;te, we generally ob|&s;erve a love of money, and cunning: and whenever ta&s;te prevails, a want of prudence, and an utter di&s;|regard to money.</P>
<P>Ta&s;te (or a ju&s;t reli&s;h of beauty) &s;eems to di&s;tingui&s;h us from the brute creation, as much as intellect, or rea|&s;on. We do not find that brutes have any &s;en&s;ation of this &s;ort. A bull is goaded by the love of &s;ex in gene|ral, without the lea&s;t appearance of any di&s;tinction in favour of the more beautiful individual. Accordingly men devoid of ta&s;te are in a great mea&s;ure indifferent as to make, complexion, feature; and find a difference of &s;ex &s;ufficient to excite their pa&s;&s;ion in all its fervor. It is not thus where there is a ta&s;te for beauty, either ac|curate or erroneous. The per&s;on of a good ta&s;te requires real beauty in the object of his pa&s;&s;ion; and the per&s;on of bad ta&s;te requires &s;omething which he &s;ub&s;titutes in the place of beauty.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of ta&s;te, it has been a&s;&s;erted, are al&s;o the be&s;t qualified to di&s;tingui&s;h, and the mo&s;t prone to admire, moral virtue: nor does it invalidate this maxim, that their practice does not corre&s;pond. The power of acting virtuou&s;ly depends in a great mea&s;ure upon with|&s;tanding a pre&s;ent, and perhaps &s;en&s;ual, gratification, or the &s;ake of a more di&s;tant and intellectual &s;atisfaction.
<PB N="164" REF="181">
Now, as per&s;ons of fine ta&s;te are men of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ual appetites, it happens that in balancing pre&s;ent and future, they are apt enough to allow an unrea&s;onable advantage to the former. On the other hand, a more phlegmatic character may, with no grater &s;elf-denial, allow the future fairer play. But let us wave the merely &s;en&s;ual indulgences; and let us con&s;ider the man of ta&s;te in regard to points of meum and tuum; in regard to the virtues of forgivene&s;s; in regard to charity, com|pa&s;&s;ion, munificence, and magnanimity; and we cannot fail to vote his ta&s;te the glorious triumph which it de|&s;erves.</P>
<P>There is a kind of counter-ta&s;te, founded on &s;ur|prize and curio&s;ity, which maintains a &s;ort of vival&s;hip with the true; and may be expre&s;&s;ed by the name Con|cetto. Such is the fondne&s;s of &s;ome per&s;ons for a knife-haft made from the royal oak, or a tobacco &s;topper from a mulberry-tree of Shake&s;pear's own planting. It gra|tifies an empty curio&s;ity. Such is the ca&s;ual re&s;emblance of Apollo and the nine mu&s;es in a piece of agate; a dog expre&s;&s;ed in feathers, or a woodcock in mohair. They &s;erve to give &s;urprize. But a ju&s;t fancy will no more e&s;teem a picture becau&s;e it proves to be produced by &s;hells, than a writer would prefer a pen becau&s;e a per&s;on made it with his toes. In all &s;uch ca&s;es, difficulty &s;hould not be al|lowed to give a ca&s;ting weight; nor a needle be con|&s;idered as a painter's in&s;trument, when he is &s;o much better furni&s;hed with a pencil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cornelius Ketel, born at Gonda in 1548; landed in England 1573; &s;ettled at Am&s;terdam 1581; took it into his head to grow famous by painting with his fingers in&s;tead of pencils.&mdash;The whim took&mdash;His &s;ucce&s;s increa&s;ed&mdash;His fin|gers appearing too ea&s;y tools, he then undertook to paint with his feet&mdash;See H.

<P>Perhaps no print, or even painting, is capable of producing a figure an&s;werable to the idea which poetry or hi&s;tory has given us of great men: a Cicero, for in|&s;tance, an Homer, a Cato, or an Alexander. The &s;ame, perhaps, is true of the grandeur of &s;ome ancient build|ings&mdash;And the rea&s;on is, that the effects of a pencil are
<PB N="165" REF="182">
di&s;tinct and limited, whereas the de&s;criptions of the pen leave the imagination room to expatiate; and Burke has made it extremely obvious, that indi&s;tinctne&s;s of out|line is one &s;ource of the &s;ublime.</P>
<P>What an ab&s;urdity is it, in framing even prints, to &s;uffer a margin of white paper to appear beyond the ground; de&s;troying half the relievo the lights are in|tended to produce! Frames ought to contra&s;t with paint|ings; or to appear as di&s;tinct as po&s;&s;ible: for which rea|&s;on, frames of wood inlaid, or otherwi&s;e variegated with colours, are le&s;s &s;uitable than gilt ones, which, ex|hibiting an appearance of metal, afford the be&s;t contra&s;t with colour.</P>
<P>The peculiar expre&s;&s;ion in &s;ome portraits is owing to the greater or le&s;s manife&s;tation of the &s;oul in &s;ome of the features.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, a &s;ublime, and a beautiful, in the very make of a face, exclu&s;ive of any particular expre&s;|&s;ion of the &s;oul; or, at lea&s;t, not expre&s;&s;ive of any other than a tame di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate one. We &s;ee often what the world calls regular features, and a good complexion, almo&s;t totally unanimated by any di&s;covery of the tem|per or under&s;tanding. Whenever the regularity of fea|ture, beauty of complexion, the &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of &s;a|gaci$y and genero&s;ity, concur in one face, the features are irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>But even here it is to be ob&s;erved, that a &s;ort of &s;ym|pathy has a prodigious bias&mdash;Thus a pen&s;ive beauty, with regular features and complexion, will have the preference with a &s;pectator of the pen&s;ive ca&s;t: and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;oul appears to me to di&s;cover her&s;elf mo&s;t in the mouth and eyes; with this difference, that the mouth &s;eems the more expre&s;&s;ive of the temper, and the eye of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Is a portrait, &s;uppo&s;ing it as like as can be to the per|&s;on for whom it is drawn, a more or le&s;s beautiful ob|ject than the original face? I &s;hould think, a perfect face mu&s;t be much more plea&s;ing than any repre&s;entation of it; and a &s;et of ugly features much more ugly than
<PB N="166" REF="183">
the mo&s;t exact re&s;emblance that can be drawn of them. Painting can do much by means of &s;hades; but not equal the force of real relievo: on which account, it may be the advantage of bad features to have their effect dimini&s;hed; but &s;urely, never can be the intere&s;t of good ones.</P>
<P>Softne&s;s of manner &s;eems to be in painting, what &s;moothne&s;s of &s;yllables is in language, affecting the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight or hearing, previous to any corre&s;pondent pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The "theory of agreeable &s;en&s;ations" founds them up$n the greate&s;t activity or exerci&s;e an object occa&s;ions to the &s;en&s;es, without proceeding to fatigue. Violent contra&s;ts are upon the footing of roughne&s;s or inequal|ity.&mdash;Harmony or &s;imilitude, on the other hand, are &s;omewhat congenial to &s;moothene&s;s. In other words, the&s;e two recommend them&s;elves; the one to our love of action, the other to our love of re&s;t. A medium, therefore, may be mo&s;t agreeable to the generality.</P>
<P>An harmony in colours &s;eems as requi&s;ite, as a variety of lines &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the plea&s;ure we expect from outward forms. The lines, indeed, &s;hould be well va|ried; but yet the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of any thing &s;hould &s;hew a balance, or an appearance of equal quantity, if we would &s;trive to plea&s;e a well-con&s;tituted ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It is evident enough to me, that per&s;ons often occur, who may be &s;aid to have an ear to mu&s;ic, and an eye for proportions in vi&s;ible objects, who neverthele&s;s can hardly be &s;aid to have a reli&s;h or ta&s;te for either.

It is rather the foible of a lazy and pu&s;illanimous di&s;|po&s;ition, looking back and re&s;ting with plea&s;ure on the &s;teps by which we have arrived thus far, than the bold and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of a genius, who&s;e ambition fires him only to reach the goal. Such as is de&s;cribed (on another occa&s;ion) in the zealous and active charioteer of Horace:</P>
<Q><L>"&mdash;hunc atque hunc &s;uperare laboret.</L>
<L>"In&s;tat equis auriga &s;uos vincentibus; illum</L>
<L>"Praeteritum temnens extremos inter euntem."</L></Q>
<P>Again, the</P>
<P>"Nil actum reputans, &s;i quid re&s;taret agendum" is the lea&s;t applicable, of any character, to a mere anti|quarian; who, in&s;tead of endeavouring to improve or to excel, contents him&s;elf, perhaps, with di&s;covering the very name of a fir&s;t inventor; or with tracing back an art that is flouri&s;hing, to the very fir&s;t &s;ource of its original deformity.</P>
<P>I have heard it claimed by adepts in mu&s;ic, that the plea&s;ure it imparts to a natural ear, which owes little or nothing to cultivation, is by no means to be compar|ed to what they feel them&s;elves from the mo&s;t perfect compo&s;ition&mdash;The &s;tate of que&s;tion may be be&s;t explained by a recour&s;e to objects that are analagous&mdash;Is a coun|try fellow le&s;s &s;truck with beauty than a philo&s;opher or an anatomi&s;t, who knows how that beauty is produced? Surely no. On the other hand, an attention to the ef|fect&mdash;They may, indeed, feel a plea&s;ure of another &s;ort.&mdash;The faculty of rea&s;on may obtain &s;ome kind of balance, for what the more &s;en&s;ible faculty of the ima|gination lo&s;es.</P>
<P>I am much inclined to &s;uppo&s;e our ideas of beauty de|pend greatly upon habit&mdash;what I mean is, upon the fa|miliarity with objects which we happen to have &s;een &s;ince we came into the world.&mdash;Our ta&s;te for uniformity,
<PB N="168" REF="185">
from what we have ob&s;erved in the individual parts of nature, a man, a tree, a bea&s;t, a bird, or infect, &amp;c.&mdash;our ta&s;te for regularity from what is within our power to ob&s;erve in the &s;everal perfections of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>A land&s;cape, for in&s;tance, is always irregular, and to u&s;e regularity in painting, or gardening, would make our work unnatural and di&s;agreeable. Thus we allow beauty to the different, and almo&s;t oppo&s;ite, proportions of all animals.</P>
<P>There is, I think, a beauty in &s;ome forms, inde|pendent of any u&s;e to which they can be applied. I know not whether this may not be re&s;olved into &s;moothne&s;s of &s;urface; with variety to a certain degree, that is com|prehen&s;ible without much difficulty.</P>
<P>As to the dignity of colours, quere, whether tho&s;e that affect the eye mo&s;t forcibly, for in&s;tance, &s;carlet, may not claim the fir&s;t place; allowing their beauty to cloy &s;oone&s;t; and other colours, the next, according to their impul&s;e; allowing them to produce a more durable plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>It may be convenient to divide beauty into the ab&s;o|lute and relative. Ab&s;olute is that abovementioned. Relative is that by which an object plea&s;es, through the relation it bears to &s;ome other.</P>
<P>Our ta&s;te of beauty is, perhaps, compounded of all the ideas that have entered the imagination from our birth. This &s;eems to occa&s;ion the difrerent opinions that prevail concerning it. For in&s;tance, a foreign eye e&s;teems tho&s;e features and dre&s;&s;es hand&s;ome, which we think deformed.</P>
<P>Is it not then likely that tho&s;e who have &s;een mo&s;t objects, throughout the univer&s;e, "caeteris paribus," will be the mo&s;t impartial judges: becau&s;e they will judge true&s;t of the general proportion which was intend|ed by the Creator; and is be&s;t.</P>
<P>The beauty of mo&s;t objects is partly of the ab&s;olute and partly of the relative kind. A Corinthian pillar has &s;ome beauty dependent on its variety and &s;mooth|ne&s;s: which I would call ab&s;olute; it has al&s;o a relative beauty, dependent on its taperne&s;s and f$liage; which,
<PB N="169" REF="186">
authors &s;ay, was fir&s;t copied from the leaves of plants, and the &s;hape of a tree.</P>
<P>Uniformity &s;hould, perhaps, be added as another &s;ource of ab&s;olute beauty (when it appears in one &s;ingle object.) I do not know any other rea&s;on, but that it renders the whole more ea&s;ily comprehended. It &s;eems that nature her&s;elf con&s;iders it as beauty, as the external parts of the human frame are made uniform to plea&s;e the &s;ight; which is rarely the ca&s;e of the internal, that are not &s;een.</P>
<P>Hutchin&s;on determines ab&s;olute beauty to depend on this and on variety; and &s;ays it is in a compound ratio of both. Thus an octagon excels a &s;quare; and a &s;quare, a figure of unequal &s;ides: but carry variety to an extreme, and it lo&s;es its effect. For in&s;tance, multi|ply the number of angles till the mind lo&s;es the uniform|ity of parts, and the figure is le&s;s plea&s;ing; or, as it approaches nearer to a round, it may be &s;aid to be rob|bed of its variety.</P>
<P>But, amid&s;t all the&s;e eulogiums of variety, it is pro|per to ob&s;erve, that novelty &s;ometimes requires a little abatement. I mean, that &s;ome degree of familiarity in|troduces a di&s;covery of relative beauty, more than ade|quate to the bloom of novelty.&mdash;This is, now and then, obvious in the features of a face, the air of &s;ome tunes, and the flavour of &s;ome di&s;hes. In &s;hort, it requires &s;ome familiarity to become acquainted with the rela|tion that parts bear unto the whole, or one object to another.</P>
<P>Variety, in the &s;ame object, where the beauty does not depend on imitation (which is the ca&s;e in foliage, bu&s;tos, ba&s;&s;o-relievos, painting,) requires uniformity. For in&s;tance, an octagon is much more beautiful than a figure of unequal &s;ides; which is at once various and di&s;agreeable.</P>
