<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the number of Books
compo&s;ed for the u&s;e of Children;
though there are many, and &s;ome on
a very rational plan, which unfold
the &s;y&s;tem, and give a &s;ummary of
the doctrines of religion; it would
be difficult to find <HI>one</HI> calculated to
a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the devotional part of
it, except indeed <HI>Dr. Watts' Hymns
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
for Children.</HI> The&s;e are in pretty
general u&s;e, and the author is de|&s;ervedly
honoured for the conde&s;cen|&s;ion
of his Mu&s;e, which was very
able to take a loftier flight. But it
may well be doubted, whether poetry
<HI>ought</HI> to be lowered to the capacities
of children, or whether they &s;hould
not rather be kept from reading
ver&s;e, till they are able to reli&s;h good
ver&s;e: for the very e&s;&s;ence of poetry
is an elevation in thought and &s;tyle
above the common &s;tandard; and if
it wants this character, it wants all
that renders it valuable.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
The Author of the&s;e Hymns has
therefore cho&s;en to give them in
pro&s;e. They are intended to be com|mitted
to memory, and recited. And
it will probably be found, that the
mea&s;ured pro&s;e in which &s;uch pieces
are generally written, is nearly as
agreeable to the ear as a more re|gular
rhythmus. Many of the&s;e
Hymns are compo&s;ed in alternate
parts, which will give them &s;ome|thing
of the &s;pirit of &s;ocial wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The peculiar de&s;ign of this publi|cation
is, to impre&s;s devotional feel|ings
as early as po&s;&s;ible on the infant
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
mind; fully convinced as the author
is, that they cannot be impre&s;&s;ed too
&s;oon, and that a child, to feel the
full force of the idea of God, ought
never to remember the time when he
had no &s;uch idea&mdash;to impre&s;s them
by connecting religion with a variety
of &s;en&s;ible objects; with all that he
&s;ees, all he hears, all that affects
his young mind with wonder or de|light;
and thus by deep, &s;trong, and
permanent a&s;&s;ociations, to lay the be&s;t
foundation for practical devotion in
future life. For he who has early
been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee the Creator in
the vi&s;ible appearances of all around
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
him, to feel his continual pre&s;ence,
and lean upon his daily protection&mdash;
though his religious ideas may be
mixed with many improprieties, which
his correcter rea&s;on will refine away&mdash;has
made large advances towards
that habitual piety, without which
religion can &s;carcely regulate the
conduct, and will never warm the
heart.</P>

<HEAD>HYMN I.</HEAD>
<P>COME, let us prai&s;e
God, for he is exceed|ing
great; let us ble&s;s God,
for he is very good.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="8">
He made all things; the
&s;un to rule the day, the moon
to &s;hine by night.</P>
<P>He made the great whale,
and the elephant; and the
little worm that crawleth on
the ground.</P>
<P>The little birds &s;ing prai&s;es
to God, when they warble
&s;weetly in the green &s;hade.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">
The brooks and rivers prai&s;e
God, when they murmur me|lodiou&s;ly
among&s;t the &s;mooth
pebbles.</P>
<P>I will prai&s;e God with my
voice; for I may prai&s;e him,
though I am but a little child.</P>
<P>A few years ago, and I
was a little infant, and my
tongue was dumb within my
mouth:</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10">
And I did not know the
great name of God, for my
rea&s;on was not come unto me.</P>
<P>But now I can &s;peak, and
my tongue &s;hall prai&s;e him;
I can think of all his kind|ne&s;s,
and my heart &s;hall love
him.</P>
<P>Let him call me, and I
will come unto him: let
<PB N="5" REF="11">
him command, and I will
obey him.</P>
<P>When I am older, I will
prai&s;e him better; and I will
never forget God, &s;o long as
my life remaineth in me.</P>

<HEAD>HYMN II.</HEAD>
<P>COME, let us go forth
into the fields, let us
&s;ee how the flowers &s;pring,
<PB N="6" REF="12">
let us li&s;ten to the warbling
of the birds, and &s;port our|&s;elves
upon the new gra&s;s.</P>
<P>The winter is over and
gone, the buds come out
upon the trees, the crim&s;on
blo&s;&s;oms of the peach and
the nectarine are &s;een, and
the green leaves &s;prout.</P>
<P>The hedges are bordered
with tufts of primro&s;es, and
<PB N="7" REF="13">
yellow cow&s;lips that hang
down their heads; and the
blue violet lies hid beneath
the &s;hade.</P>
<P>The young go&s;lings are
running upon the green, they
are ju&s;t hatched, their bodies
are covered with yellow down;
the old ones hi&s;s with anger
if any one comes near.</P>
<P>The hen &s;its upon her
ne&s;t of &s;traw, &s;he watches
<PB N="8" REF="14">
patiently the full time, then
&s;he carefully breaks the &s;hell,
and the young chickens come
out.</P>
<P>The lambs ju&s;t dropt are
in the field, they totter by
the &s;ide of their dams, their
young limbs can hardly &s;up|port
their weight.</P>
<P>If you fall, little lambs,
you will not be hurt; there
is &s;pread under you a carpet
<PB N="9" REF="15">
of &s;oft gra&s;s, it is &s;pread on
purpo&s;e to receive you.</P>
<P>The butterflies flutter from
bu&s;h to bu&s;h, and open their
wings to the warm &s;un.</P>
<P>The young animals of every
kind are &s;porting about, they
feel them&s;elves happy, they
are glad to be alive,&mdash;they
thank him that has made
them alive.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="16">
<P>They may thank him in
their hearts, but we can
thank him with our tongues;
we are better than they, and
can prai&s;e him better.</P>
<P>The birds can warble, and
the young lambs can bleat;
but we can open our lips in
his prai&s;e, we can &s;peak of
all his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Therefore we will thank
<PB N="11" REF="17">
him for our&s;elves, and we
will thank him for tho&s;e that
cannot &s;peak.</P>
<P>Trees that blo&s;&s;om, and
little lambs that &s;kip about,
if you could, you would &s;ay
how good he is; but you
are dumb, we will &s;ay it for
you.</P>
<P>We will not offer you in
&s;acrifice, but we will offer
<PB N="12" REF="18">
&s;acrifice for you, on every
hill, and in every green field,
we will offer the &s;acrifice of
thank&s;giving, and the incen&s;e
of prai&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>HYMN III.</HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD the Shepherd
of the flock, he taketh
care for his &s;heep, he lead|eth
them among clear brooks,
<PB N="13" REF="19">
he guideth them to fre&s;h
pa&s;ture; if the young lambs
are weary, he carrieth them
in his arms; if they wander,
he bringeth them back.</P>
<P>But who is the &s;hepherd's
&s;hepherd? who taketh care
for him? who guideth him
in the path he &s;hould go?
and if he wander, who &s;hall
bring him back?</P>
<PB N="14" REF="20">
<P>God is the &s;hepherd's &s;hep|herd.
He is the Shepherd over
all; he taketh care for all; the
whole earth is his fold: we
are all his flock; and every
herb, and every green field
is the pa&s;ture which he hath
prepared for us.</P>
<P>The mother loveth her
little child; &s;he bringeth it
up on her knees; &s;he nouri&s;h|eth
its body with food; &s;he
<PB N="15" REF="21">
feedeth its mind with know|ledge:
if it is &s;ick, &s;he
nur&s;eth it with tender love;
&s;he watcheth over it when
a&s;leep; &s;he forgetteth it not
for a moment; &s;he teacheth
it how to be good; &s;he re|joiceth
daily in its growth.</P>
<P>But who is the parent of
the mother? who nouri&s;heth
her with good things, and
watcheth over her with ten|der
<PB N="16" REF="22">
love, and remembereth
her every moment? Who&s;e
arms are about her to guard
her from harm? and if &s;he is
&s;ick, who &s;hall heal her.</P>
<P>God is the parent of the
mother; he is the parent of
all, for he created all. All
the men, and all the women
who are alive in the wide
world, are his children; he
loveth all, he is good to all.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="23">
<P>The king governeth his
people; he hath a golden
crown upon his head, and the
royal &s;ceptre is in his hand;
he &s;itteth upon a throne, and
&s;endeth forth his commands;
his &s;ubjects fear before him;
if they do well, he protecteth
them from danger; and if
they do evil, he puni&s;heth
them.</P>
<P>But who is the &s;overeign
<PB N="18" REF="24">
of the king? who command|eth
him what he mu&s;t do?
who&s;e hand is &s;tretched out
to protect him from danger?
and if he doeth evil, who
&s;hall puni&s;h him?</P>
<P>God is the &s;overeign of the
king; his crown is of rays of
light, and his throne is
among&s;t the &s;tars. He is
King of kings, and Lord of
lords: if he biddeth us live,
<PB N="19" REF="25">
we live; and if he biddeth
us die, we die: his dominion
is over all worlds, and the
light of his countenance is
upon all his works.</P>
<P>God is our Shepherd, there|fore
we will follow him:
God is our Father, therefore
we will love him: God is
our King, therefore we will
obey him.</P>

<HEAD>HYMN IV.</HEAD>
<P>COME, and I will &s;hew
you what is beautiful.
It is a ro&s;e fully blown. See
how &s;he &s;its upon her mo&s;&s;y
&s;tem, like the queen of all the
flowers! her leaves glow like
fire; the air is filled with her
&s;weet odour; &s;he is the de|light
of every eye.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="27">
<P>She is beautiful, but there
is a fairer than &s;he. He that
made the ro&s;e, is more beau|tiful
than the ro&s;e: he is all
lovely; he is the delight of
every heart.</P>
<P>I will &s;hew you what is
&s;trong. The lion is &s;trong;
when he rai&s;eth up him&s;elf
from his lair, when he
&s;haketh his mane, when the
voice of his roaring is heard,
<PB N="22" REF="28">
the cattle of the field fly,
and the wild bea&s;ts of the
de&s;art hide them&s;elves, for
he is very terrible.</P>
<P>The lion is &s;trong, but he
that made the lion is &s;tronger
than he: his anger is terri|ble;
he could make us die in
a moment, and no one could
&s;ave us out of his hand.</P>
<P>I will &s;hew you what is
<PB N="23" REF="29">
glorious. The &s;un is glori|ous.
When he &s;hineth in the
clear &s;ky, when he &s;itteth on
his bright throne in the hea|vens,
and looketh abroad over
all the earth, he is the mo&s;t
excellent and glorious crea|ture
the eye can behold.</P>
<P>The &s;un is glorious, but
he that made the &s;un is more
glorious than he. The eye
beholdeth him not, for his
<PB N="24" REF="30">
brightne&s;s is more dazzling
than we could bear. He
&s;eeth in all dark places; by
night as well as by day; and
the light of his countenance
is over all his works.</P>
<P>Who is this great name,
and what is he called, that
my lips may prai&s;e him?</P>
<P>This great name is GOD.
He made all things, but he is
<PB N="25" REF="31">
him&s;elf more excellent than
all which he hath made:
they are beautiful, but he is
beauty; they are &s;trong, but
he is &s;trength; they are per|fect,
but he is perfection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5">
<HEAD>HYMN V.</HEAD>
<P>THE glorious &s;un is &s;et
in the we&s;t; the night-dews
fall; and the air which
was &s;ultry, becomes cool.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="32">
<P>The flowers fold up their
coloured leaves; they fold
them&s;elves up, and hang their
heads on the &s;lender &s;talk.</P>
<P>The chickens are gathered
under the wing of the hen,
and are at re&s;t: the hen her|&s;elf
is at re&s;t al&s;o.</P>
<P>The little birds have
cea&s;ed their warbling; they
are a&s;leep on the boughs,
<PB N="27" REF="33">
each one with his head be|hind
his wing.</P>
<P>There is no murmur of
bees around the hive, or
among&s;t the honeyed wood-bines;
they have done their
work, and lie clo&s;e in their
waxen cells.</P>
<P>The &s;heep re&s;t upon their
&s;oft fleeces, and their loud
<PB N="28" REF="34">
bleating is no more heard
among&s;t the hills.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ound of a
number of voices, or of chil|dren
at play, or the tramp|ling
of bu&s;y feet, and of peo|ple
hurrying to and fro.</P>
<P>The &s;mith's hammer is not
heard upon the anvil; nor
the har&s;h &s;aw of the car|penter.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="35">
<P>All men are &s;tretched on
their quiet beds; and the
child &s;leeps upon the brea&s;t
of its mother.</P>
<P>Darkne&s;s is &s;pread over the
&s;kies, and darkne&s;s is upon
the ground; every eye is &s;hut,
and every hand is &s;till.</P>
<P>Who taketh care of all
people when they are &s;unk
in &s;leep; when they cannot
<PB N="30" REF="36">
defend them&s;elves, nor &s;ee if
danger approacheth?</P>
<P>There is an eye that never
&s;leepeth; there is an eye that
&s;eeth in dark night, as well
as in the bright &s;un-&s;hine.</P>
<P>When there is no light of
the &s;un, nor of the moon;
when there is no lamp in the
hou&s;e, nor any little &s;tar
twinkling through the thick
<PB N="31" REF="37">
clouds; that eye &s;eeth every
where, in all places, and
watcheth continually over all
the families of the earth.</P>
<P>The eye that &s;leepeth not
is God's; his hand is always
&s;tretched out over us.</P>
<P>He made &s;leep to refre&s;h
us when we are weary: he
made night, that we might
&s;leep in quiet.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="38">
<P>As the mother moveth
about the hou&s;e with her
finger on her lips, and &s;tilleth
every little noi&s;e, that her
infant be not di&s;turbed; as
&s;he draweth the curtains
around its bed, and &s;hutteth
out the light from its tender
eyes; &s;o God draweth the
curtains of darkne&s;s around
us; &s;o he maketh all things
to be hu&s;hed and &s;till, that

<P>Labourers &s;pent with toil,

over you.</P>
<P>You may &s;leep, for he
never &s;leeps: you may clo&s;e
your eyes in &s;afety, for his

you.</P>
<P>When the darkne&s;s is pa&s;|&s;ed
away, and the beams of the
morning-&s;un &s;trike through
your eye-lids, begin the day
with prai&s;ing God, who hath
taken care of you through the
night.</P>
<P>Flowers, when you open

<P>Birds, when you awake,
warble your thanks among&s;t

<P>I have been wandering

<PB N="37" REF="43">
in the cool &s;hade; the
corn &s;prung up in the fur|rows;
the poppy and the hare-bell

beauty.</P>
<P>Did&s;t thou &s;ee nothing

&s;port before her on the gra&s;s;
the elder ones learn to labour,
and are obedient; the father
worketh to provide them
food: either he tilleth the

<P>The father, the mother,

they kneel down together and

<P>Many kingdoms, and coun|tries
