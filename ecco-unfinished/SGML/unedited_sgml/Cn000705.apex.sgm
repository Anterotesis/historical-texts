<HEAD>THE CASE OF Mr. Green&s;hields, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS This CASE re&s;pects Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields</HI> alone, the&s;e Sheets, &s;hould not have at all been concern'd, in undeceiving the World about him; &s;ince al&s;o it might be convenient for the Poor Man's Circum&s;tances, that &s;ome People &s;hould be deceiv'd about him, becau&s;e if they knew him better, it might be le&s;s to his Advantage.</P>
<P>Neither has the Defence of the City Ju&s;tice of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> mov'd this Publication; &s;ince be the Man Injur'd by the Magi&s;trates there or no; and if &s;ome things in their Proceedings, may not go down with us in <HI>England,</HI> or may not &s;o well be Defended as they think they may, it is yet not ma|terial enough, to trouble the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader about it; let them Fight it out among them&s;elves, and let the Magi&s;trates defend their Proceedings as no doubt they can, by their own Laws and Con&s;titution, it is not &s;o much to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Impri&s;oning this Man, being mi&s;-repre&s;ented in <HI>England.</HI> (1.) As he is &s;aid to be Impri&s;oned for Reading the Common-Prayer to an Epi&s;copal Congregation. (2.) As his Impri&s;onment is cry'd up for a barbarous Per&s;ecu|tion. (3.) As it is laid at the Door of the National Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and upon the whole People of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And (4.) As mighty Complaints are made of this Matter, to foment Parties, make Feuds and Divi&s;ions among us here, or excite the Parliament to impo&s;e a Toleration there; as <HI>I &s;ay</HI> this u&s;e is made of it, to the di&s;tracting our People, and breaking our Peace; &s;o it is very fit our People &s;hould be rightly Inform'd, and indeed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, Truth &s;hould be &s;et in a clear Light, that every one may judge for him&s;elf, and not be impos'd upon by the Artifice and Mi&s;-repre&s;entation of a Party.</P>
<P>There is lately Publi&s;h'd, and mo&s;t indi&s;triou&s;ly handed about <HI>England,</HI> a Book Entitled, <HI>A True State of the Ca&s;e of the Reverend Mr. Green&s;hields,</HI> &amp;c. In which his Impri&s;onment is repre&s;ented to the World, as Cruel and Unju&s;t, and mighty Exaggerations rais'd from the Circum&s;tances;
<PB N="4" REF="3">
&s;uch as (1.) Its being for Reading the Common-Prayer, &amp;c. This in particular to have it affect the Members of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> (2.) His long Impri&s;onment, and (3.) The manner of the Proceedings again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Undertaking &s;hall no farther trouble it &s;elf with that Book, than the giving a more true and impartial Account of this Affair, occa&s;ions by Con&s;equence&mdash;Since if the Matter may be impartialy &s;tated, the Circum&s;tances truly brought to light, and the Antecedent and Con&s;equent Part of the Hi&s;tory be truly related; the Book, or the Party propogating the Book, will need no other Reply, the Clamour mu&s;t cea&s;e, and all the Malicious Inferences, drawn from it by the Party now bu&s;ie to divide us, nece&s;&s;arily fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>Nor will the Jingling Preface to the &s;aid Book need any other Reply, than what the true Relation of Fact will furni&s;h: Some few Ob&s;erva|tions as we go, may &s;erve to obviate all the Melancholy Tone of that Canting Introduction, with which we are led by the Author, into his Ac|count of the Matter.</P>
<P>To come then to this Matter, it is nece&s;&s;ary to go back a little, to the Affair of the late Union, as to the Original, from whence it mu&s;t be deduc'd; and if we bring things from their proper Ori|ginal, it may be hoped we may be able to lay them the fairer open, to the View of the mo&s;t common Under&s;tanding&mdash;And in doing this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to Enquire, HOW we in <HI>England,</HI> came to expect that the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould receive the Common-Prayer Book among them; and then WHY, or what Rea&s;on we have to expect it&mdash;</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident, than that the whole Di&s;pute before us, will turn upon this Que&s;tion, Whether we ought to expect of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that they &s;hould admit the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service among them, or no? For if really we have no Rea&s;on to expect it, nor they have no Rea&s;on to do it&mdash;Then all the Hard&s;hips upon this Man, tho' all the Ridiculous things alledg'd were true, are mo&s;t ju&s;t, and he is really a Criminal, for offering to Impo&s;e that upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> which they ought not to allow.</P>
<P>To make &s;hort Work of this &s;eemingly long Task, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to lay down &s;ome Fundamental Principles, founded upon the re&s;pective Con&s;titutions of either Kingdom <HI>before United,</HI> and upon the pre&s;ent Con|&s;titution of the whole <HI>as United;</HI> from which, as from an unque&s;tion'd Standard, or Rule of Argument, the following Di&s;cour&s;e may be deduc'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. That before the Union, the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot|land,</HI> however United under the &s;ame Race of Kings, and &s;ubmit|ting to the &s;ame Sovereign, were yet perfectly and entirely inde|pendent on each other, and had no more Right to intermeddle either in the Laws, Con&s;titution, Commerce, or Religion of one another, than the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> had, or any other remote Country.</P>
<P>This needs no other Proof than this, that <HI>England</HI> has acknowledg'd this Independency to <HI>Scotland</HI> upon all occa&s;ions, but more parti|cularly in Treating with <HI>Scotland</HI> for a Union, as an Independent Nation.</P>
<P N="2">2. That as the Civil Government of either Kingdom, was &s;eparate and Independent before the Union; &s;o the Religious Government was al&s;o &s;eparate and entirely Independent, and the National
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Churches of either, were E&s;tabli&s;h'd by their own Laws, Subject to their own Di&s;cipline, Govern'd by their own Authority, THIS by Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or an Epi&s;copal Hierarchy, THAT by Se&s;&s;ion, Presbytery, Synod, and General A&s;&s;embly, without having the lea&s;t Re&s;pect to, Corre&s;pondence with, or Concern about each other, neither owning, allowing, or &s;o much as acquainting them&s;elves with one another.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That</HI> by this it is apparent, <HI>neither</HI> had the lea&s;t Power to Impo&s;e upon each other, or had they Reciprocal Communication with each other.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That</HI> &s;o little was the Confidence or Kindne&s;s between the Churches, &s;o Incompatible the Intere&s;ts, and &s;o Impracticable any Union be|tween them; that no Politick Union could ever be brought to pa&s;s, between the Civil Intere&s;ts of the two Nations, till Religious Matters, and all Notions of a Union of Churches, was entirely re|&s;erv'd and left out of the Treaty&mdash;So that at the General Union of the two Kingdoms, lately and happily Accompli&s;h'd&mdash;Two Things were determin'd, as the great Preliminaries, without which no Co|alition could be &s;o much as Practicable, <HI>(viz.) First,</HI> The Repealing an Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> Entitled <HI>an Act to prevent Dangers ari&s;ing from the late Act of Security in Scotland,</HI> as an Act Invading the In|dependency of <HI>Scotland&mdash;</HI>And <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Affair of Religi|on &s;hould not be in any wi&s;e Treated upon, or meddled with; but that the re&s;pective National Churches, being left entire and unalter|able, either Nation &s;hould be Impower'd to make &s;uch Laws for the Security of their re&s;pective Eccle&s;ia&s;tick E&s;tabli&s;hments, as they thought fit; which Laws being fir&s;t Enacted in the re&s;pective Par|liaments of either Kingdom, &s;hould be again Ratified in either King|dom, by being Encorporated in the Treaty of Union, and &s;o be made unalterable for ever, by any &s;ub&s;equent Authorities of the United Kingdom.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That</HI> this was accordingly done, and the &s;everal Acts of Security, <HI>(viz.)</HI> One made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Security of the Presbyterian Church Government; and one made in <HI>England,</HI> for the Security of the Epi&s;copal Hierarchy in <HI>England;</HI> are Ratified, Enacted and En|corporated in the Union, and cannot be Alter'd Invaded or Di&s;anull'd, by any Power what&s;oever, remaining in the Kingdom of United <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That,</HI> as before the Union, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy was never receiv'd by the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor Tole|rated or allow'd to be u&s;ed, no not in the Chapel Royal of the King&mdash;Even in the Times of the Epi&s;copal Church Government being E&s;ta|bli&s;h't in that Kingdom, except that famous Attempt formerly made by K. <HI>Cha. . first,</HI> in the Year 1638, which put that whole Kingdom in a Flame, and kindled a Civil War again&s;t that King, which ended in the Pacificaton of 1639. By one of the Articles of which, the &s;aid Attempt of Impo&s;ing the &s;aid Liturgy was declared illegal; &s;o, much le&s;s was it Allow'd, Receiv'd, and Tolerated in the &s;aid Kingdom, in the late Happy E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Revolution: But the Presbyterian Church was E&s;tabli&s;h'd, and the Di&s;cipline, and Wor&s;hip, and Government thereof declared to be the only Eccle&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and Epi&s;copacy entirely aboli&s;h'd, by the <HI>1&s;t</HI> Act of the fir&s;t Parliament of <HI>William</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and <HI>Mary;</HI> and confirm'd, explain'd and farther &s;ecured by &s;eve|ral &s;ub&s;equent Acts: Neither was any Attempt made, for the Erect|ing the &s;aid <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy, in the &s;aid Kingdom, from the &s;aid Re|volution to the time of the Union; except &s;uch as might be done &s;ecretly, and in Remote Corners, the Government having taken no Cognizance thereof.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>That</HI> in the Act of Union, Ratified and Confirm'd by Parliament, <HI>An.</HI> 1707. The People of <HI>England</HI> have Covenanted and Agreed with the People of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> have ex|pre&s;ly United with the People of <HI>England,</HI> upon the&s;e Terms and no other, as to this Ca&s;e&mdash;That the <HI>Purity</HI> and UNIFORMITY of the Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline, and Government of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;hall be, and remain as now profe&s;s'd, to the People of <HI>Scot|land</HI> WITHOUT ANY ALTERATON, to all &s;ucceding Gene|rations.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>That,</HI> by the <HI>&V;niformity of the Wor&s;hip</HI> mention'd as above, it was expre&s;ly &s;ignified both in the A&s;&s;embly and in the Parliament of <HI>Scot|land</HI> then &s;itting, to mean the pre&s;rving the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from Innovations of Wor&s;hip; and in particular Tolerating the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy; tho' it was thought in Courte&s;ie to <HI>England,</HI> decent to ex|pre&s;s it in mode&s;t Terms, <HI>(viz.) &V;niformity of Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Having laid down the&s;e Fundamentals, which I believe no Man can deny, and therefore will not Di&s;pute: We come of cour&s;e to draw two mo&s;t ju&s;t Inferences.</P></Q>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That</HI> the People of <HI>England,</HI> have no Rea&s;on to expect that the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould Admit, Receive, or Tolerate, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy among them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That</HI> the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> have no Rea&s;on in kindne&s;s <HI>to Expect</HI> or in Ju&s;tice <HI>to &s;uffer them&s;elves</HI> to be Impos'd upon, in Erecting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy among them, which they never &s;uffer'd in times of Epi&s;copacy, and which the People there have a particular Aver&s;ion to.</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. That the People of <HI>England</HI> ought not to expect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This is evident from the &s;everal Laws in <HI>Scotland,</HI> carefully E&s;tabli&s;hing, the pre&s;ent Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> all which Laws are Recognized and Confirmed by the Union; and &s;ince then it is again&s;t the Laws there, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ought not to pre&s;s the <HI>Scots</HI> in that Affair.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> Becau&s;e it is an Expre&s;s Contravention of the Treaty of Union, which being a Solemn Treaty, and a Capitulation between the Nations, and more particularly of <HI>England</HI>'s making; ought to be kept Sacred, and not in the lea&s;t Infringed by us, as we would not &s;uffer the <HI>Scots</HI> on their part, to Infringe other Parts of it, more to our Di&s;ad|vantage.</P></Q>
<P>It &s;eems natural here however to bring in an Objection, which indeed is taken from the Mouth of the Party; and upon which the main Stir is at pre&s;ent made<HI>&mdash;Viz. That all this Argument lies only again&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hing the</HI> Engli&s;h Liturgy in Scotland, <HI>in the Kirk; or bringing it into the Publick Wor&s;hip BY LAW which is not pretended to&mdash;But all that is now in&s;i&s;ted</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<HI>on,</HI> is only Private Wor&s;hip, <HI>in a &s;eparate manner from the Church, after the manner of the Di&s;&s;enters in</HI> England; <HI>who being Tolerated</HI> in England <HI>by the Indulgence of the Church and Government, it is very hard the Church of</HI> England, <HI>who give that Indulgence here, &s;hould not obtain it there.</HI></P>
<P>This is giving the Adver&s;ary full Scope, and &s;aying all for them, that they pretend to &s;ay for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Before we enter into the &s;everal Parts of this Objection, we &s;hall make a brief Reply to the General; Thus<HI>&mdash;Suppo&s;e it is hard,</HI> as you call it, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service &s;hould not be tolerated there, <HI>tho' it is not granted nei|ther;</HI> yet you have no Authority to impo&s;e <HI>the redre&s;&s;ing that Hard&s;hip</HI> upon the <HI>Scots&mdash;</HI>And it would be much harder upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> that &s;ince you have united with them, you &s;hould have Power to demand what you had nothing to do with before, and &s;hould clamour them out of or into, what <HI>by the way</HI> you have nothing to do with now&mdash;Viz. <HI>Suffering Innovations in the publick Wor&s;hip;</HI> let us &s;earch for &s;ome Parallel Ca&s;es&mdash;</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e another <HI>Occa&s;ional Bill</HI> were brought into the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in order to de&s;troy the Toleration of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and to &s;ub|ject them again to Per&s;ecution. The <HI>Scots</HI> might &s;ay <HI>to the Church of Eng|land,</HI> it was hard that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted in <HI>England,</HI> while <HI>they (the Scots)</HI> admitted the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters even into their Churches, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Stipends in <HI>Scotland&mdash;</HI>And yet it would be more than probable, that the <HI>Engli&s;h Church-Men</HI> would tell their Brethren in <HI>Scotland, it was no Bu&s;ine&s;s of theirs,</HI> they might mind their own Affairs.</P>
<P>It is a great Hard&s;hip at this time in <HI>England,</HI> and what the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> &s;uffer great Inconveniencies <HI>by,</HI> that, notwith&s;tanding the Toleration of <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in the Wor&s;hip of GOD according to their Con&s;ciences, <HI>is e&s;ta|bli&s;hd by Parliament,</HI> yet they are not permitted to erect Schools for the In|&s;truction of their Children&mdash;As if the Toleration were intended only to ea&s;e &s;uch as are <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> now, and not to provide others to &s;ucceed them; or as if the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> could &s;atisfie him&s;elf to educate his Children in a way of Wor&s;hip which he cannot conform to him&s;elf&mdash;And as if when I am tolerated to wor&s;hip God according to my Con&s;cience, I mu&s;t not in&s;truct my Child to do &s;o too&mdash;And again, as to Academick Learning, <HI>which they alledge the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters <HI>cannot by Law maintain;</HI> as if the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> were to be tolerated in Wor&s;hip, and be allow'd Meeting-hou&s;es, but not to breed up any Mini&s;ters; &s;o that, <HI>when the pre&s;ent Race was to die off,</HI> they were to be without Mini&s;ters, and &s;o were to have no publick Admini&s;tration of Go&s;pel Ordinances among&s;t them&mdash;And Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> in his late Speech owns the very Ab&s;urdity I complain of; tho' he glo&s;&s;es it over as well as he can, in the&s;e Words; <Q>&startq;That Act, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> was Intended for the ea&s;e of tho&s;e, who&s;e Minds through the unhappy prejudices of Education, were ALREADY E&s;tranged from the Church; not <HI>as I Humbly conceive,</HI> to indulge Men in taking the mo&s;t effectual Methods to propagate and&endq; perpetuate their Schi&s;m&mdash;and from this Notion the Dr. calls the Di&s;&s;en|ters <HI>Erecting Seminaries for the Educating Youth,</HI> to be an Abu&s;e of that Act, meaning the Act of Toleration.</Q> <HI>Vide</HI> Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s Speech, <HI>first</HI> Edit. <HI>fol.</HI> 13.</P>
<P>The&s;e things indeed are Hard&s;hips upon the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England.</HI> But pray, Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if the <HI>Scots</HI> Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould complain of the&s;e Hard&s;hips to the Parliament; if the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly of the Kirk there, &s;hould make any Declaration again&s;t it, or
<PB N="8" REF="7">
if they &s;hould appeal from any Sentence pa&s;s'd, in that Ca&s;e to the Parliament; would not we in <HI>England</HI> take it very ill, and &s;ay, the Scots had nothing to do with it; and that this was the Con&s;equence of the Union; that the Pres|byterians began to encroach upon us; that our Church would be over|run with their re&s;tle&s;s Spirits, and that the Union would be dangerous to the Church of <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>Let us then make this Ca&s;e our own; The granting Toleration to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> has no more Foundation of Argument to engage <HI>Scot|land to the like,</HI> than the general Allowance of Popery by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and recie|ving a Provincial or Chief of the Je&s;uits in <HI>Holland,</HI> has to argue the like Li|berty of Popery in <HI>England:</HI> The Rea&s;on is, Becau&s;e the&s;e two Nations were before the Union, and the two Churches are &s;till after the Union, ab&s;oluteiy &s;eparate <HI>from,</HI> unrelated <HI>to,</HI> and independent <HI>on</HI> one another; neither have they any Kind of Commerce or Corre&s;pondence one with another, nor do either Side pretend to de&s;ire it; <HI>&s;o that</HI> what one allows or tolerates, or what the other rejects and refu&s;es to tolerate, has no Manner of Reference to, or Concern in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>But to enter a little into the clo&s;er Part of the Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> The Pre|tence which has been made from a reciprocal Act of Kindne&s;s in one Nation to another, from which the Church of <HI>England</HI> Men <HI>argue,</HI> That it is hard <HI>Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters</HI> &s;hould not be allow'd or tolerated in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Kirk there, &s;ince <HI>Presbyterian Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are tolerated by the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This may be an&s;wer'd, fir&s;t by Demur or Objection again&s;t the State of the Que&s;tion, as it is vulgarly taken.</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. According to the Doctrine of the famous Dr. <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters</HI> are not tolerated in <HI>England,</HI> only exempted from certain Pe|nalties.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a Mi&s;take to &s;ay, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are tolerated by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for their Toleration is an Act of the State&mdash;And perhaps if it were left to the Church, the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> might find as lit|tle Favour, and &s;ome le&s;s, as the <HI>Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> do at this time&mdash;So that the Difference &s;eems to lie only here, that the Kirk of <HI>Scotland</HI> has a Power in her Hands, which the Church of <HI>England</HI> has not; And &s;ome would be glad to &s;ee the Church of <HI>England</HI> make it out, that ever they had that Power in their Hand, and did not make a wor&s;e U&s;e of it again&s;t <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> than ever the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ince they have had this Power in their Hand, has done again&s;t the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> People there, and therefore the Church has no|thing to argue here; if any thing is to be &s;aid, it is in the Name of the Civil Government on either &s;ide&mdash;And let them argue it&mdash;In which Ca&s;e the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;peak thus.</P></Q>
<P>The Thing called Toleration is of three &s;orts; Toleration of Epi&s;co|pacy, Toleration of Non-Jurors, and Toleration of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy; and in both we are more than upon the Square with the Church of <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Toleration of Epi&s;copacy;</HI> &s;ay the <HI>Scots,</HI> we give more Toleration to it by Law, than the Church of <HI>England</HI> gives to the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>England</HI> by Law; and this the Gentlemen have been often put in mind of by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the <HI>Act of the fir&s;t Parliament of William and Mary</HI> cited to them; <HI>by which it is</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">

<P>If this be not Toleration by Law, then let the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hew the like Toleration, before they complain of the <HI>Scots&mdash;</HI>But &s;ay &s;ome, <HI>that are forward to find Objections,</HI> This is but a Temporary Conni|vence, and here is no Provi&s;ion to PROPAGATE and PERPETUATE Epi&s;copacy; let this be a good Objection in who&s;e Mouth it will, it can|not be good in the pre&s;ent Argument, nor in the Mouth of a Church of <HI>England</HI> Man; unle&s;s they will fir&s;t Burn Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s Speech, and Condemn it by a publick Act of the Church&mdash;Wherein he &s;ays, the Toleration as before quoted of Di&s;&s;enters, was Temporary<HI>&mdash;And in|tended for the Ea&s;e of their Minds, who were ALREADT</HI> (mark the Word) <HI>E&s;tranged from the Church, not to Indulge Men in taking the mo&s;t effectual Me|thods to Propagate and Perpetuate their Schi&s;m.</HI> Vid. <HI>Sach.</HI> Speech <HI>pag.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>We are now upon the Alternative between the Nations, and Di&s;|cour&s;ing of the pretended Hard&s;hips, and the Unkindne&s;s of not allowing Toleration to Di&s;&s;enters in one, as well as in the other; if then it is proved the <HI>Scots</HI> do grant as much, or more Toleration than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> then 'tis pre&s;umed this Argument will be &s;ufficiently handled; in the above Ca&s;e it is Clear, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t &s;tand Debtor to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the placing 150 <HI>Presbyterian Mini&s;ters</HI> in &s;o many good Livings and Pari&s;h Churches in <HI>England&mdash;</HI>When that Debt &s;hall be paid, we may talk farther.</P>
<P>Let us next enquire into Toleration of EPISCOPAL NON-JURORS, or as vulgarly expre&s;s'd, <HI>Toleration of Jacobit&s;m;</HI> and here it is evident, the <HI>Scots</HI> will be Creditors again, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> Debtors, in the great Account Current of Toleration,</P>
<P>You need not be Informed in <HI>England,</HI> how the mo&s;t peaceable, quiet and Con&s;cientious Non-Jurors here, are Treated; We will not &s;ay, but that there are many, and perhaps many Thou&s;ands in <HI>England,</HI> who meerly on Principles of Con&s;cience, having Sworn Allegiance to the Late King <HI>James</HI> and his Heirs<HI>&mdash;In which Ca&s;e the Oath in tho&s;e Days, was very Expre&s;s and Severly Worded,</HI> do &s;till think them&s;elves bound in Con&s;cience by that Oath, and that as long as any of the Lawful I&s;&s;ue, or legally &s;ucceeding Race of that King, remain alive, they are bound by that Oath, again&s;t all other what&s;oever. The&s;e People &s;ay, they cannot join in Wor&s;hip with the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, they cannot call them the Church of <HI>England</HI> but think them really Schi&s;matical, and that they have for&s;aken their Principles, they cannot Pray for her Maje&s;ty as Law|ful Sovereign, for they cannot Acknowledge her to be &s;uch; much le&s;s can they Swear Allegiance to her, their Allegiance being already pre|engag'd by Oath.</P>
<P>It is not to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, to enquire how far the&s;e People are mi|&s;taken, or how far their Principle is hone&s;t or not&mdash;It is out of Que&s;tion that &s;uch People there are, in both parts of <HI>Britain&mdash;</HI>If Toleration is due to all Chri&s;tians by a Native Right, in Matters meerly Con&s;cientious, and if the&s;e being otherwi&s;e quiet and peaceable, give no Di&s;turbance to the Government: The&s;e may Claim &s;ome &s;hare &s;urely in the Con&s;ide|ration of their Brethren Prote&s;tants, in both parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> at lea&s;t as to the Affair of Wor&s;hip&mdash;Being al&s;o all of them Epi&s;copal.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
Now let us examine how it &s;tands with the&s;e People, in either part of <HI>Britain</HI> at this time: In <HI>Scotland</HI> their Meetings are permitted, there are at lea&s;t 15 of them in <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> they are Open and Publick, Frequented and Undi&s;turb'd, in <HI>Leith, Mu&s;celbro', Dalkeith, Haddington, Dunbar, Dundee, Perth, Montro&s;s, Aberdeen, Frazersburgh, Inverne&s;s, Sterling, Lithgow, Dumfermling, Gla&s;gow, Dumfreis,</HI> and in Multitudes of Places more&mdash;Here they Wor&s;hip their own Way, they neither take the Oaths to qualifie them for this Liberty, nor do they Pray for the Queen; for they do not Acknowledge her as their Sovereign; nay they frequently Pray for her Enemy the Pretender, &s;ometimes Directly and Expre&s;sly, and almo&s;t always Obliquely and Indirectly; be&s;ide this Connivence there are publick Collections of Charity Yearly, for the Relief of the Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters, and their Widows, and Families; and this is Di&s;tributed openly, to tho&s;e that are Jacobites profe&s;&s;edly &s;o, and refu&s;e either to take the Oaths, or to Pray for their Sovereign: Some have &s;aid that it is Di&s;tributed to none but &s;uch&mdash;Yet to this the Presby|terians con&s;tantly and openly Contribute, and their Mini&s;ters in par|ticular.</P>
<P>Let us now Enquire into what of this kind is practis'd in <HI>South-Britain,</HI> by that &s;ame Party of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who cry out of the want of Toleration in <HI>Scotland&mdash;</HI>Let the Jacobite-Clergy &s;peak to this Head; and let them tell us, what Connivence at their Meetings, or what Charitable Contribution have even the mo&s;t quiet, peaceable, and con&s;ci|entious <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> found from the Church of <HI>England?</HI> Have they been permitted to hold Meetings in any Manner what&s;oever? Have they been allow'd the lea&s;t Liberty of wor&s;hipping God according to their Con&s;cien|ces, unle&s;s they would in open Defiance of their profe&s;s'd Principle, take the Oaths?</P>
<P>Again; what Charity, what Contribution, what Relief has been afford|ed to tho&s;e, who being di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of their Livings, and who having &s;tript them&s;elves of their Wordly Comforts, to pre&s;erve their Con&s;cien|ces, in point of Swearing, have been abandon'd to all the Extremeties of Poverty, Nay, &s;ome of them to down-right Beggary and Starving?</P>
<P>Thus your Brethren in <HI>Scotland</HI> have gone beyond you, and you are Debtor upon this Head; the allowing the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Meetings for Wor&s;hip, without Swearing to, or Praying for the Queen; and the Contributing in Charity, for the Poor Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd Clergy, that cannot in Con&s;cience take the Oaths, who to this Day are expos'd in &s;hort, to a &s;hameful Di|&s;tre&s;s among us in <HI>England;</HI> I &s;ay &s;hameful, becau&s;e certainly they that are Con&s;cientious among us, however Circum&s;tances may &s;et us again&s;t them in Point of Intere&s;t, &s;hould never be excluded in Point of Charity&mdash;And if we are commanded, if our Enemy Hunger, to Feed him, doubt|le&s;s our Excluded Brethren &s;hould not be &s;uffer'd to Peri&s;h. The <HI>Scots Presbyterians</HI> are as remote from <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> as any People in the World; yet as Chri&s;tianity Teaches them, &s;o Humanity prompts them to open their Hears and Hands, to Feed even tho&s;e they Depo&s;e and Reject, as to the publick Receiving them into the Church: Since tho' they are Sentenc'd to be put out of their Livings, they are by no Law doom'd to be &s;tarv'd&mdash;In this therefore the <HI>Scots</HI> go beyond us, both in Toleration, and in Chri&s;tian Charity.</P>
<P>The <HI>3d</HI> Article of Toleration only remains, and in this they &s;tand Debtors to <HI>England, (Viz.)</HI> They will not Tolerate the Common-Prayer Book in <HI>Scotland:</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
And we on the other Hand, omitting the great Debt we are in to them, upon the two Articles above, make loud Clamours at them, as if Tole|rating <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> even in the very Churches, and <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> in Meeting-Hou&s;es, were not enough, or indeed were nothing at all.</P>
<P>Now &s;aving to the <HI>Scots,</HI> that truly we have nothing to do to require Toleration of them, or &s;o much as to ask of them why they refu&s;e it; and remembring that in point of Kindne&s;s, and Equivalent for the Tole|rating <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are their Debtors three for one; and will not Pay that Debt, tho' ju&s;t enough in point of Equality to be demanded; yet let us come to &s;ome other An&s;wers, why we ought not to expect it of them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That as to Toleration of <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> by Law, the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> People in <HI>Scotland</HI> neither de&s;ire it, nor would accept it, unle&s;s you would give it them without the Incumbrance of Oaths, or obliging them to Pray for Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which they will not do; and if they wou'd, their People would not hear them; to Tolerate them, would be to Divide and De|&s;troy them; tho&s;e that now po&s;&s;e&s;s Churches upon taking the Oaths mu&s;t quit them, and take to Meeting-Hou&s;es; and tho&s;e that would not take the Oaths, mu&s;t be entirely &s;uppre&s;s'd, as in <HI>England,</HI> which would create a wor&s;e Per&s;ecution, than any has yet been known among them; &s;o that a Toleration, or Act of Exemption in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would make a wor&s;e Confu&s;ion than there is now: Nor do any of the Parties de&s;ire it, or would any of them accept of it; the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> People that would take the Oaths, would be much wor&s;e than they are now, and therefore they would not accept of it, for the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Mini&s;ter who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a Pari&s;h, a Stipend and Man&s;e, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to quit his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to &s;et up a Meeting-Hou&s;e, perhaps get few Hearers, and no certain, if any Contribution or Allowance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Non-Juror</HI> that could not take the Oaths, could not accept of this Legal Toleration at all, becau&s;e it would certainly be clog'd with Oaths, Ab|jurations, praying for the Queen, and &s;ubmitting to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church in Di&s;cipline, which they will never do, and con&s;equently would be quite cru&s;ht and left wor&s;e than before.</P>
<P>It remains then, that there is not the lea&s;t Complaint left, for want of any Toleration, but to the Common-Prayer Book&mdash;A Thing, neither Swearing <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI> nor Jacobite <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI> ever knew in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or practi&s;ed; even when the National Church was <HI>Epi&s;copal,</HI> when they were all one, and when they had the Power in their Hands&mdash;A Thing which very few, even of the <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to do them Ju&s;tice, will comply with, or do now practi&s;e&mdash;A Thing which <HI>Scotland</HI> it&s;elf po&s;i|tively Capitulated again&s;t in the Union, and which <HI>England</HI> has Bargain'd, Contracted, expre&s;sly Stipulated and Agreed to, and with the <HI>Scots,</HI> never to impo&s;e upon them.</P>
<P>Now have the Enemies of the Union no Hole left, at which they may creep in, to Undermine the Peace of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and De&s;troy the very Foundation of the Treaty, But this &s;ingle Article of the Common-Prayer&mdash;And this they mu&s;t have, or el&s;e they mu&s;t pretend to Per&s;e|cution. The mi&s;carriage of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. indeed is no &s;ufficient Warn|ing to the&s;e People, for it is a mi&s;carriage which they want&mdash;It is a Confu&s;ion of Nations, and a Breach of the Union that they want&mdash;Some are fond of &s;aying the <HI>Scots</HI> are too Tenacious of their own Opinions, and it is an Error, that their People are &s;o warm, (in the We&s;t e&s;pecially)
<PB N="12" REF="11">
that they will not &s;uffer any thing among them, that does not come up to their heights<HI>&mdash;Very well,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e this an Infirmity, and yet &s;ince the Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> knew, that the&s;e People could not be forc'd, and that great Depredations had been made upon them, and much Blood &s;pilt to break in upon them, and that yet they adhered to their Principles, and would do &s;o, but might by little and little, and by &s;oft and gentle Methods, be brought to Unite with the E&s;tabli&s;hment; it was their Pru|dence then, to prevent further Impo&s;itions on them, in things which they knew would enrage them, and put them out of the Government even of them&s;elves, and therefore they were in the Right to provide in the Union, that no &s;ort of Innovations &s;hould be impos'd upon them of any kind what&s;oever, e&s;pecially &s;uch as that of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wor&s;hip, to which they knew the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> even the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> People them&s;elves had a particular and con&s;tant Aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus we are brought down by ju&s;t Degrees to the Story of Mr. <HI>Green|&s;hields,</HI> of whom &s;o much Noi&s;e is made; who having made the Attempt in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to &s;et up the Common-Prayer there, has been cen&s;ur'd by the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and Impri&s;on'd by the Magi&s;trates, and lies now in the <HI>Tol-booth</HI> for refu&s;ing to obey the &s;aid Sentence, and to refrain Exerci&s;ing the Office of a Mini&s;ter, in the Bounds of that <HI>Presbytery;</HI> they being al&s;o &s;atisfied of his having no Legal <HI>Epi&s;eopal</HI> Ordination, no not in his own Way, being Ordain'd by a Bi&s;hop, without Presbyters, and that Bi&s;hop Exauctorate by the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the Man is very &s;hort, unle&s;s we &s;hould enter into the Detail of his Character, as to his Morals, which is not the De&s;ign of of this Work&mdash;Only in brief, you may take it upon the Knowledge of many Hone&s;t Men in the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who are Favourers enough of his De&s;ign; That his Practice will not bear a Character, that he is a Prophane, Profligate and Immoral Per&s;on&mdash;And if he plea&s;es to enter into the Defence of his own Character, he &s;hall hear more of it.</P>
<P>This Man coming from <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he had a &s;mall Sub&s;i&s;tence of 14 <HI>l. Per Annum</HI> at mo&s;t, at <HI>Tinan</HI> and having a large Family to Main|tain, which he hoped to make &s;ome better Provi&s;ion for at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Arrives at the &s;aid City about. . . . . 1709. It is not material to &s;ay what is alledg'd by &s;ome, that he was &s;ent thither by Concert, for the De&s;ign: But this is certain, That being there, he is laid hold of by a Party, who&s;e Aim was vi&s;ibly to di&s;turb the Peace of that Country, as a fit In&s;trument, being Poor, Mercenary, and made forward by the In|couragement of the Party.</P>
<P>Having gotten the In&s;trument, they re&s;olve upon the Attempt of &s;et|ting up openly, and in the Face of the Government, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy; An Attempt which had once before prov'd Fatal to its Undertakers, and had put the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> into a Flame; an Attempt they very well knew was the ready Way to make a New Rupture, and unra|vel the Solemn Contract of Union, &s;o lately and &s;o firmly E&s;tabli&s;h'd&mdash;Between the Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Before I come to the manner of the Attempt, and the Conduct of the Man in it: It may be needful to examine a little the Pretences made for it, and the Methods taken to prepare the People for, and Intoduce it:</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
<HI>First,</HI> It was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread about the Country, and at the &s;ame time, at <HI>London</HI> al&s;o, which &s;hews the Concert of Parties, That Her Maje&s;ty had granted the Royal Chapel of <HI>Haly-rood-Hou&s;e</HI> to be fitted up for the &s;etting up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service, at the Humble Reque&s;t, and for the U&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, who were plac'd there in the &s;everal publick Employments of the Exchequer, Cu&s;tomes, Exci&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Who could not conform to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Wor&s;hip; and this they carry'd &s;o far, as to cau&s;e it come down from <HI>London</HI> in &s;ome of the written News, and drew in a weak and ignorant News-writer in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> unwarily to Print it again; for which he receiv'd a ju&s;t Reprimand from the Govern|ment, and narrowly e&s;caped having been &s;ent to the <HI>Tolbooth.</HI></P>
<P>His having, as we &s;ay, broach'd the thing in the World, and that it had been talk'd of a little: The next thing, was to draw in &s;ome other weak and unwary Gentlemen of the &s;everal Offices, to clo&s;e with a Propo&s;al of &s;etting up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy in the City, and rai&s;ing a Sub&s;cription for the Maintenance of a Mini&s;ter&mdash;particularly this Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields,</HI> to whom they promi&s;ed the Sum of Eighty Pound Pound <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>The principal Hands to this, were among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers of the Cu&s;tom and Exchequer, and &s;ome few others whom the Party had made the Dupes of the Project, and the Cat's Foot to put in the Fire, and thus the Sub&s;cription began. But Sir <HI>Alexander Rigby,</HI> the fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Cu&s;toms in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' him&s;elf a zealous Church of <HI>England-man,</HI> yet &s;eeing farther than the re&s;t into the mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences of this De&s;ign, and knowing how contrary to her <HI>Maje&s;ty's</HI> firm Re&s;olution of main|taining the <HI>Scots</HI> in all their ju&s;t Rights, this Attempt was; Upon the fir&s;t Complaint that was made to him by the Lord Advocate of <HI>Scotland,</HI> re|lating to it, cau&s;ed an Order to be made, That the Secretary of their Board &s;hould immediately make Enquiry into the thing, and return the Names of &s;uch as had been concern'd in this Project, that her Maje&s;ty might be acquainted of it. Upon which, the Per&s;ons not daring to own their De&s;ign, and being a little better inform'd of the Nature of what they were going to do, cancelled their Sub&s;cription, and abandoned the De&s;ign&mdash;thus the Vigour and Prudence of that one Gentleman, di&s;appointed the Incendiaries, and al&s;o &s;aved the Gentlemen con|cern'd, from running too far in a thing which mu&s;t certainly have ruin'd them, as to their Offices&mdash;and for which, <HI>whither they will acknowledge it or no,</HI> they are very much in Debt to him.</P>
<P>While this was tran&s;acting, and to encourage the Sub&s;cription, Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields</HI> takes a Hou&s;e in one of the mo&s;t publick Places of the City, oppo&s;ite to the Cro&s;s of <HI>Einburgh&mdash;</HI>and &s;o publick, that at the filling or coming out of the Churches, they being &s;uppo&s;ed to end at the u&s;ual Hours, they would of nece&s;&s;ity meet the Magi&s;trates of the City both at their Going and Coming: Having taken, and fitted up this Hou&s;e for a Chapel, he openly begins the Office of a Preacher, reading the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy Morning and Evening before Sermon, as is u&s;ual in the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The People of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> allarm'd with this Novelty, and more e&s;peci|ally, with the open and avow'd Manner of it&mdash;which had many Circum|&s;tances in it, calculated to affront and enrage the People, and if po&s;&s;ible, to move them to &s;ome Riot or Tumult&mdash;began to &s;hew them&s;elves very unea&s;ie.</P>

However, they were re&s;train'd by the Prudence of &s;ome of the princi|pal Inhabitants, from u&s;ing any violent Methods with them; but the Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly being then to meet, the Inhabi|tants agreed to Petition them for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e Innovations, accor|ding to Law, at the &s;ame time pre&s;enting a Petition on the like Occa&s;ion, to the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> Which Petitions I have here in&s;erted at large, that the World may &s;ee the true Ground and Manner of the Fir&s;t Proceedings in this Ca&s;e.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;It would be con&s;ider'd in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, That &s;everal of &s;uch as preach in the&s;e Meeting-hou&s;es are known to be, not only un&s;ound in their Judgments, but al&s;o &s;candalous and immoral in their Lives and Practices; And however they may pretend to be qualify'd according to Law, yet if they were not &s;ecret, and Heart-Enemies to Her Maje&s;ty and thepre&s;ent Government, they would never yield them&s;elves Tools to&endq; a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, for carrying on of their wicked and pernicious De&s;igns.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>&startq;Secondly,</HI> They cannot pretend it to be Matter of Con&s;cience, in &s;et|ting up of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service here, for ab&s;tracting from <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> even the Body and Bulk of the Epi&s;copal Per&s;wa&s;ion in <HI>Scotland</HI> have never been fond of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Way of Wor&s;hip; but upon many Occa|&s;ions have te&s;tify'd their Di&s;like of the &s;ame, and none of them &s;cruple to joyn in Communion with this Church, but &s;uch as are either openly profane, and will not &s;ubject to Church-Di&s;cipline, or avow'd <HI>Jaco|bites.</HI></Q>&endq; And therefore,</P>
<P><Q><HI>&startq;Thirdly,</HI> We conceive, That by the&s;e illegal and unwarrantable En|croachments, Intru&s;ions, and Innovations, they de&s;ign no le&s;s than the Ruin of both Church and State; for as the &s;etting up of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ser|vice here did in former Times breed much Trouble and Confu&s;ion in this Church and Nations, &s;o at pre&s;ent it does rai&s;e and foment Jealou|&s;ies and Heart-burnings in the Minds of People, otherwi&s;e zealou&s;ly af|fected to her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Government, and exceedingly widens the Breach betwixt us and the &s;eparating Parties on both hands; And the In&s;tigators to, and Abettors of the&s;e Practices are in big Hopes, and not without good and evident Grounds, that this will prove an effe|ctual Means of alienating the Hearts and Affections of many of our
<PB N="16" REF="15">
QUEEN's be&s;t and mo&s;t Loyal Subjects, from her Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment; and that by that Means they &s;hall effe|ctually wound and weaken the Church on both &s;ides, and al&s;o ruin the&endq; Civil Government.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;We mu&s;t al&s;o humbly repre&s;ent, That albeit we have many good and laudable Laws and Acts of Parliament again&s;t Popery and Papi&s;ts, their trafficking and practi&s;ing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> particularly again&s;t their Teach|ing of any Science, Art and Exerci&s;e within the &s;ame, and again&s;t all Irreligion and Bla&s;phemies; yet Papi&s;ts do openly and avowedly teach and practi&s;e, even within the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and Suburbs. And now al&s;o a profane and deluded Crew of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts are &s;et up in this Place, who, under Pretence to the Spirit of Prophecy, do utter mo&s;t horrid Bla&s;phemies again&s;t the ever Glorious Trinity, &s;uch as ought not to be &s;uffer'd in any Chri&s;tian Church or Nation, &s;eeing this &s;trikes at the very Root and Vitals of all Religion, and is &s;et on Foot of <HI>Satan&endq;</HI> to confound (if po&s;&s;ible) all &s;olid Thoughts of a Deity among&s;t us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;We have for Brevity's Sake repre&s;ented but a few of the many Incon|veniencies that will certainly follow the Sufferings of &s;uch Practices, and do judge it our Duty in all Humility, to lay them before the Reve|rend Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;eeing you are &s;et by the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the Watch-Tower, to advert, that the Intere&s;t of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment of this Church, do not &s;uffer or &s;u&s;tain any Pre|judice which you can prevent, prrticularly to take &s;pecial Care to keep and mainain Unity in the Church upon all Emergents; And to &s;ee to the due Execution of the Acts of A&s;&s;emblies, which are very plain and expre&s;s again&s;t &s;uch Innovations in the Wor&s;hip of God, particularly the Act 15 <HI>Gen.

And therefore humbly and earne&s;tly beg and entreat, That as you tender the Glory of God, the Peace and Unity of this Church, and the Quiet and Safety of her Maje&s;ty's Govern|ment, you would u&s;e your utmo&s;t Endeavours for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and cru&s;h|ing &s;uch intolerable and pernicious Practices and De&s;igns in the&endq; Bud&mdash;</Q></P>

<P>Here it &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd, That the Dean of <HI>Guild</HI> of the City of <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI> whether by Information of the Per&s;ons of whom the &s;aid <HI>Green|&s;hields</HI> had taken it as a Tenant, or of other People, finding what was do|ing, and of what ill Con&s;equence it was like to be; whether it was true, as &s;ome alledg'd, that he had done &s;omething injurious to the Hou&s;e be|beyond his Contract, is not material&mdash;but he cites them before the Town-Courts, of which he is Judge, and by their Law di&s;po&s;e&s;&s;ed them of their Hou&s;e which was &s;o publick&mdash;Upon which they remove, and take a Place more private, and where it made le&s;s Appearance. Nor will the Clamour of Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields</HI> hold Water here again&s;t the Legality of this Proceeding; for every one knows (and no doubt but he knew) that by the Law of the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Dean of <HI>Guild</HI> has Power to judge of all Alterations in any Building, and may prohibit the pulling down Partitions of Walls in any Hou&s;e: Nor may any Alteration in the main Building in any Hou&s;e be done without his Approbation&mdash;And &s;uch Power is rea&s;onably ve&s;ted in that Magi&s;trate, becau&s;e the Hou&s;es being generally built in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as our Sets of Chambers are in the <HI>Temple,</HI> or other Inns of Court, where every Floor is; or may be a &s;eparate Pro|perty, it is rea&s;onable nothing &s;hould be done, to the weakning or da|maging the Floor Above.</P>

But the Stroak was &s;truck before this could be done; perhaps, had they begun in private, and with Mode&s;ty, no Notice had been taken at all&mdash;But that wou'd not have an&s;wer'd the De&s;ign&mdash;And indeed, this very thing takes off the Pretence of Con&s;cience in this Matter; for if it had been purely a Principle of Con&s;cience in the Epi&s;copal Gentlemen, either <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Scots,</HI> in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> that they could not conform to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Wor&s;hip, and de&s;ir'd to Wor&s;hip God according to their Con&s;ciences; then had they no need to have &s;et up a new Meeting|hou&s;e, &s;ince there were two or three in the City before, who kept Meet|hou&s;es, and who had always u&s;ed the Common-Prayer, <HI>and do &s;o &s;till,</HI> un|di&s;turb'd. Nor can it be alledg'd, that they were crowded, or that there was not Room for them; &s;ince one Place, and that none of the Large&s;t, would ea&s;ily hold all of the Epi&s;copal People in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who follow'd that kind of Wor&s;hip; &s;ince of Fifteen Epi&s;copal Meeting-hou&s;es that were in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but Two or Three ever u&s;ed it, and they with a very &s;mall Number of Re&s;pondents.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers that were there, tho&s;e few that offer'd at it, had they been really &s;o con&s;cientious, might have found a more ju&s;t Method by far, for the &s;atisfying their Con&s;ciences in Matters of Wor&s;hip, <HI>(viz.)</HI> By returning into <HI>England,</HI> and Wor&s;hiping their God there, leaving the Pro|fits of Employments in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> who they will not per|mit in <HI>England</HI> to enjoy the lea&s;t Office of Profit or Tru&s;t, without a full Conformity to the National Church, not in Hearing and Wor&s;hip only, but in Communion; and it &s;eems very unequal, that a Nation who exclude all the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Subjects from any Tru&s;t or Profit among them, as to publick things, but upon full Compliance with their Church, &s;hould &s;end People among the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s the be&s;t Offices in their Country, and at the &s;ame time, fly in the Face of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion of the Nation, tho' &s;olemnly Recognized by the Government and Church in their own Country, to be the true Prote&s;tant Religion&mdash;This is a thing &s;o hard, and the Circum&s;tances &s;o unju&s;t, that I cannot but hint it to the Gentlemen concern'd, and let them know, that their Conduct is taken Notice of by their Superiours, and will not be long born with.</P>
<Q><HI>Nor would it be ami&s;s to tell &s;ome of tho&s;e</HI> Engli&s;h-men, <HI>without reflecting upon &s;ome a|mong them of better Conduct&mdash;That before they expect the People in</HI> England <HI>&s;hould believe the Pretentions they make to Scruple of Con&s;cience in Matters of Religion, they would do well to take a little more Care of their Morals, that they do not demon&s;trate they have no Religionat all, and they not bring a Scandal upon their Country and Church, and a&s;&s;i&s;t Common Fame to make it a just Proverb in</HI> Scotland, As drunk as an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> and to &s;wear like an <HI>Engli&s;h-man&mdash;'Tu very &s;trange there &s;hould be found among &s;ome Men &s;o much Con&s;cience of Ceremony, and &s;o little Con&s;cience of Morality.</HI></Q>
<P>But to return to Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields;</HI> As I ob&s;erve, that on the part of the wi&s;er Inhabitants, great Endeavours were u&s;ed to prevent the Peo|ple committing any Di&s;orders or Exce&s;&s;es, and that their Care of the Peace was very effectual, not the lea&s;t Violence having been offer'd him; &s;o there were not wanting another Party, who as diligently endeavour'd to provoke and &s;tir up the People to <HI>Riot</HI> and <HI>Tumult;</HI> Rumours and Reports were rai&s;ed and promoted, of Threatnings to Rabble the &s;aid <HI>Green&s;hields,</HI> and &s;everal Methods u&s;ed to bring it to pa&s;s<HI>&mdash;but to no Pur|po&s;e&mdash;</HI>It &s;eems hard indeed, to lay this Part upon Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields,</HI> or his Party, who, in &s;uch Tumult might have had a Fate no Man can have &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;ire&mdash;But there are a Party of Men, who will &s;ome|times &s;acrifice their Friends to carry an Intere&s;t; and it is &s;ince very well known what Intere&s;t &s;uch a thing would have &s;erved, and how u&s;eful a Defence it would have been to the late Tumults and Rabblings of the

<P>Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields,</HI> thus di&s;appointed in his Place, and the De&s;ign of in|&s;ulting the Magi&s;trates, by placing his Meeting ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the En|trance into Four Churches, he &s;et up in a Place a little more private, and where, had he began at fir&s;t, perhaps le&s;s Notice had been taken&mdash;But the Petition before having been pre&s;ented to the Commi&s;&s;ion of the A&s;&s;embly, they could not well avoid taking a general Notice of it, at lea&s;t, they had not di&s;charged their Duty, if they had not taken Notice of it, other Addre&s;&s;es coming in at the &s;ame time, from other Parts.</P>
<P>Whereupon, they publi&s;h'd an Act of the Commi&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;embly, being the &s;ame recited in Mr. <HI>Green&s;hield</HI>'s Ca&s;e, and which his Friends propo&s;e &s;ome Advantage by Publi&s;hing, tho' it was al&s;o Print|ed by the Commi&s;&s;ions Order, and di&s;per&s;ed over the whole Kingdom&mdash;By which Act, the Commi&s;&s;ion refers it to the re&s;pective Presbyteries to take Cognizance of Innovations, and to proceed judicially again&s;t the Per&s;ons guilty of intruding into the Church, or of making and introducing Innovations in Wor&s;hip, according to Law.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take Notice to mark it as a Deficiency in all the An&s;werers and De&s;enders of the&s;e Ca&s;es, tho' otherwi&s;e very exactly done&mdash;That they &s;eem to avoid, as if afraid to allow, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould make any judicial Proce&s;s again&s;t, or ab&s;olutely refu&s;e to allow the Introducing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy, and other Innovations in Wor&s;hip into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>True it is; <HI>and as to</HI> Green&s;hield<HI>'s Ca&s;e, it is arguing</HI> ad Hominem, there has not been the lea&s;t Step taken of that Kind with him, for he lies in &s;o many Points open to the Law be&s;ides, that there was no manner of Oc|ca&s;ion for it&mdash;And I cannot but wonder, the Author of the Pamph|let, &s;etting forth his Ca&s;e, would undertake either to &s;peak &s;o much again&s;t Knowledge, or to &s;peak of a Ca&s;e at all which he had &s;o little Knowledge of&mdash;The Truth of the Fact is plainly thus:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He was &s;ummoned as being a Stranger only, and having exerci&s;ed the Office of a Mini&s;ter without any apparent Authority; and this is own'd in his Ca&s;e&mdash;And the fir&s;t Que&s;tion asked of him, was to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e&mdash;What Authority he Had to Execute the Office of a Mini&s;ter in that place?</P>
<P>To this, his <HI>An&s;wer</HI> was, That he was a Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>England&mdash;</HI>But he was obliged immediately to detect him&s;elf of Fal&s;hood in that, when being required to produce his Letter of Ordination, he &s;hew'd Letters of Ordination, which &s;tiled him a Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> (meaning the Epi&s;copal-Church.)</P>
<P>To cover this Prevarication, he tells them, The Church of <HI>England</HI> and the Epi&s;copal Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were encorporated by the Union&mdash;This wretched Shift indeed expo&s;ed him very much&mdash;but the upper Part of his Face &s;u&s;tained that, and he in&s;i&s;ted upon it.</P>
<P>His Ordination then was examined, and found to be irregular, as be|ing from an Exauctorate Depo&s;ed Bi&s;hop, who, by the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> can have no Right to Ordain Mini&s;ters to be receiv'd by the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is the Objection his Advocate makes, of any Force, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Bi&s;hop, tho' Depo&s;ed, is not Unpresbyter'd&mdash;for that, by the Laws
<PB N="19" REF="18">
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he is &s;o far dive&s;ted of all Power, that he cannot act as a Bi&s;hop, or as a Pre&s;|byter either, in the Church, whatever he may do any where el&s;e; and the&s;e Laws have a particular Sanction added to them from the Epi&s;copal Church in <HI>Scotland</HI> them&s;elves, who when they were E&s;tabli&s;h'd, acknowledg'd and own'd <HI>the Power of appointing Officers in the Church to be inherent in the Crown&mdash;Vide</HI> 1 Act, 1 Se&s;&s;. 2 Parl. <HI>Cha.</HI> II. Where it is declared by the Epi&s;copal People them&s;elves,</P>
<P><Q>&startq;That to his Maje&s;ty, and his Succe&s;&s;ors, the Ordering and Di&s;po&s;al of the External Government, and Policy of the Church, doth propetly belong, as an Inherent Right of&endq; the Crown.</Q></P>
<P>Now 'tis evident, that the&s;e Bi&s;hops being depriv'd by the Regal Authority, and that Re|gal Authority being acknowledg'd by them, to have Power to deprive them, no Act they can do as Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, relating to the Church, can be binding to the Church, or ought to be receiv'd by the Church as Lawful&mdash;and by con&s;equence, no Ordination of Mini&s;ters by them can be impo&s;ed upon the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Invalidity of his Ordination, it is true, Mr. <HI>Green&s;hields</HI> was Sentenc'd, and no doubt, the Proce&s;s was very ju&s;t&mdash;And as every thing in it has been done legally and regu|lar, the Appeal which he hath brought before the Hou&s;e of Lords, will no Doubt be reje|cted, or if not, will rather confirm by their Sentence what has been done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> than otherwi&s;e repeal it.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak to that Part of this Cau&s;e which relates to the Innovation it &s;elf, and the &s;etting up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for whatever may be the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e of <HI>Green|&s;hields,</HI> it is allow'd the other lies at the Bottom on both Sides.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, but had <HI>Green&s;hields</HI> given the cleare&s;t Account imaginable of him&s;elf, he would have been &s;entenc'd by the Presbytery, to forbear the Common-Prayer within their Bounds, and been Impri&s;oned by the Magi&s;trates, if he had refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to it; and therefore, with Submi&s;&s;ion to the Author of the Remarks on <HI>Green&s;hield</HI>'s Ca&s;e, his concealing this, and only an&s;wering in the Negative to the Charge, is not a Defence &s;o much to the Honour, either of the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> or of the Con&s;titution and Authority of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and its E&s;tabli&s;hment by the Union, as it were to be wi&s;hed had been.</P>
<P>It is true, that Book does, with a great deal of Judgment, effectually confute the &s;pecious Preten&s;ions of the Party, who have rai&s;ed a Clamour upon the Impri&s;onment of this par|ticular Man, as if per&s;ecuted <HI>qua</HI> Church of <HI>England,</HI> and meerly for reading the Com|mon-Prayer&mdash;But if we were to &s;peak to the Provo&s;t and Baylies of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it would be very proper to &s;ay, <HI>Pray Gentlemen,</HI> What does this &s;ignifie to you, or what Advantage does this gain to you? The Ca&s;e is thus;</P>
<P>This <HI>Green&s;hields,</HI> was a Tool, pick't out by the Party to make the E&s;&s;ay: Not, whe|ther the Erecting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy might go down with you or no; for 'tis apparent, that was not the De&s;ign, but to E&s;&s;ay, whether Erecting it in the Teeth of Magi&s;tracy, and in Defiance of Law, would pa&s;s upon you or no; and either Way they had gain'd their Ends upon you.</P>
<Q><P N="1">(1.) If you had tamely born with it, then they had found you were to be in&s;ulted, and they would have been the fir&s;t to cry out, The Union was broke; and con&s;e|quently have put other Breaches upon you by the &s;ame Rule.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) If you had re&s;olved not to bear it, then they depended upon it, you would oppo&s;e it one or two Ways: (1.) By Riot and Tumult, which 'tis evident they wi&s;hed mo&s;t for, and &s;trove hard to bring to pa&s;s; in which Ca&s;e there was &s;ome Pro&s;pect of embroiling you with Magi&s;tracy it&s;elf, and the Government; or, (2.) By Law, and the common Form, and then they had the Church of <HI>England</HI> to cry to, and pretend Per&s;ecution.</P></Q>
<P>Now, as the la&s;t of the&s;e only is come to pa&s;s, &s;uppo&s;e you have di&s;appointed them by taking their In&s;trument by a Handle they did not expect&mdash;What then? What is this to the Purpo&s;e? They are then defeated only in their In&s;trument, and the Con&s;equence is nothing but this, That next time they mu&s;t &s;eek out another Tool, again&s;t whom the&s;e Objections will not lie, and then their Work is done&mdash;And the Ea&s;ine&s;s of this is &s;uch, as need give them no Di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the Gentleman who wrote this Remark, was asked by the Epi&s;copal Party&mdash;Well, Sir, you in&s;i&s;t, that this Man is not Impri&s;oned for Reading the Common-Prayer, but &s;o and &s;o, for Exerci&s;ing the Office of a Mini&s;ter, without a legal Call, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> You grant then, that had he been a lawful Mini&s;ter, he might have officiated; and that for Reading the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service, you could not have proceeded&mdash;What, would have been An&s;wer'd? <HI>If it had been granted&mdash;</HI>They had no more to &s;ay but this; Well then, we will get another, again&s;t who&s;e Ordination you will not object: And with him, we may &s;et up the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy, even at the Cro&s;s<HI>&mdash;If it had been deny'd them,</HI> then the Pretence
<PB N="20" REF="19">
of Per&s;ecution follows<HI>&mdash;And it must be &s;aid,</HI> tho' with the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect to the Author of the Remarks, who has &s;hewn a great Deal of Wit, Learning, and Dexterity in his Argu|ment, and who appears perfectly skill'd in the Con&s;titution (tho' utterly unknown to the Author of this) yet, with his Pardon, he has left this Ca&s;e as he hath found it&mdash;and the Epi&s;copal Party, are only like a General of an Army, who be&s;ieging a Town, and having attack'd it by Battery and Storm, and been bravely beaten off by the Garri&s;on, &s;ays to his Officers, <HI>Well then, we mu&s;t take another Method, we will take them by Sapping and Mining.</HI> But &s;till the Town &s;hall be taken.</P>
<P>It is humbly conceived therefore, that tho' proving this Man is not pro&s;ecuted for Read|ing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service, mo&s;t plainly confutes the Party, and effectually an&s;wers all their Cries of Per&s;ecution; yet it does not do the Work, it does not prevent the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI> being daily in&s;ulted by other In&s;truments, again&s;t whom, the &s;ame Advantages cannot be taken.</P>
<P>But to prove effectually, that by the Con&s;titution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the Union, by the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Act of Security, and by the Po&s;tulata of the Union, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liturgy cannot be impo&s;ed upon them, or tolerated by them, but that they are obliged to oppo&s;e it, and pro&s;ecute the Innovators: This is to do the Work at once&mdash;and then no Man can charge the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> with per&s;ecuting the Church of <HI>England,</HI> without <HI>fir&s;t</HI> owning the Church of <HI>England</HI> to be an Encroacher upon her Neigh|bour Church, a Breaker of Articles and Solemn Treaties, and offering to impo&s;e, not upon the Con&s;ciences only, but upon the Privileges of the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>It may therefore be allow'd, that the Innovators in Matters of Wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e who will offer to impo&s;e the Common-Prayer upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> will always be pro&s;ecuted by the Law there; otherwi&s;e the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> mu&s;t give up their Privileges, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Rights, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be impo&s;ed upon, by a re&s;tle&s;s, in&s;ulting Party from one thing to another: <HI>For 'tis evident, they will not re&s;t here,</HI> till all their Privileges are trampled under Foot, as well Civil as Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER what has been &s;aid to the Ca&s;e in general, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a Word or two to the Man him&s;elf&mdash;The Proce&s;s again&s;t him, as their own Te&s;timony allows, is not for Innovations in Wor&s;hip, tho' that had been effectually ju&s;tified, as before&mdash;But for his being in no wi&s;e qualify'd as a Mini&s;ter&mdash;So that had he only preach'd, and ne|ver read the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Service at all, he had been liable to the &s;ame Pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>In this Pro&s;ecution, the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and after them, the <HI>Magi&s;tracy</HI> have acted free from Partiality, Pa&s;&s;ion, or Prejudice, according to the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> in every Re&s;pect, as is mo&s;t unan&s;werably proved by the Learned Author of the <HI>Remarks</HI> upon their printed Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Authority of the Government to depo&s;e Epi&s;copacy, is acknowledg'd by the Epi&s;co|pal People them&s;elves, in that famous Act of Parliament made by them&s;elves, and quoted before, in which they own, that the Right of placing Officers in the Church, is inherent in the Crown&mdash;The Crown then, pur&s;uant to that declared Right, having depo&s;ed not &s;o much the Per&s;ons of the Bi&s;hops, but the very OFFICE of a Bi&s;hop in the Church, it cannot be, that a Per&s;on Ordain'd by a Bi&s;hop, can be allow'd a legal Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>I might add, That if the Ordination of the Epi&s;copal Church were valid, yet this Man's was not, becau&s;e he appears Ordain'd by a Bi&s;hop <HI>&s;clus,</HI> without the Addition of <HI>Presbyters&mdash;</HI>which is the only thing in the Epi&s;copal Ordination, that moves the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church to allow Epi&s;copal Ordination, and not to Re-ordain &s;uch as come over from them. Since they allow the Bi&s;hops to Ordain, as Presbyters, tho' not as Bi&s;hops&mdash;But no Church allowing one &s;ingle Presbyter to Ordain, this Ordination could not be valid.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if there were not more in the De&s;ign, this Man would not lie in Pri&s;on; it is evident, the Doors are open to him, he may come out when he will&mdash;He has nothing to do, but to obey the Sentence. Not to Officiate any more in tho&s;e Bounds&mdash;Nay, if his Ordination were not good, he may come out and get better Ordination, and &s;ee if that will admit him&mdash;The De&s;ign is vi&s;ible; he is to lie there, to father the Clamour of Per|&s;ecution upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> or to come out over the Bellies of the Magi&s;trates, that he may pu&s;h on the In&s;ult upon the Con&s;titution, till the People may be exa&s;perated, and brought to a Tumult, and to &s;uppre&s;s him by Rabble; both which would have been excellently well calcu|lated, to have ju&s;tified the like Rabbles long ago projected, and lately attempted upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
