<HEAD>A REPLY TO A PAMPHLET ENTITULED, The L&mdash;d <HI>H&mdash;&s;ham</HI>'s Vindication of his SPEECH, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Know nothing more Difficult, in Replying to the Defence of my Lord <HI>H&mdash;&s;ham</HI>'s Speech, than to come at a Certainty, whether it be his Lord&s;hip's own Doing or Not. The Paper, which was formerly Call'd his Lord&s;hip's Speech, I Talk'd to, as not of his Lord&s;hip's Doing, and I am with much more Rea&s;on Enclin'd to Treat this the &s;ame way, tho' perhaps I may be Mi&s;taken in both.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, I think my &s;elf oblig'd to Determine, in what Form to Treat of it, as the Foundation of my Di&s;cour&s;e, and as the Ground of my Method; and whether I gue&s;s Right or Wrong, the Defence of the Manner lies upon the fir&s;t Suppo&s;ition; and therefore this Author when Charging me with Di&s;regard to his Lord&s;hip's Quality in my Expre&s;&s;ions, is pleas'd to forget, that I fir&s;t &s;uppos'd that Paper <HI>not to be his.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is it enough to &s;ay, I knew it to be his Lord&s;hip's Speech, for what ever by Common Fame, <HI>which 'tis own'd is a Common Lyer,</HI> might be &s;uppds'd, it was for me in &s;o Nice a Ca&s;e, to take things not by their Sugge&s;ted, but by their Apparent being, and as in the Sence of things, no Man could fair$$
<PB N="4" REF="3">
&s;ay, it was his Lord&s;hips, it was &s;o much the more ju&s;tifiable to &s;uppo&s;e it was not, and &s;o it is here.</P>
<P>I know very well it was Expected, <HI>and perhaps by his Lord&s;hip,</HI> that I &s;hould have been Que&s;tion'd, for the Freedom I took with that Paper, and Summon'd to An&s;wer for it at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords, but as that Honourable Hou&s;e under&s;tood better, &s;o I am not A&s;ham'd to &s;ay, I under&s;tood better than to Apprehend it; and, for this time, &s;uppo&s;ing my &s;elf &s;peaking to my Lord I make the &s;ame An&s;wer here, That <HI>$ad I been call'd up to &s;peak to it,</HI> I &s;hould have given there, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord, I know nothing of a Speech made in the Hou&s;e of Lords by your Lordi&s;hip, or any other Member of that Hou&s;e. Here is a Pam|phlet Printed which I have &s;poken to, if there had been my Lord <HI>H&mdash;&s;ham</HI>'s Name to it, I know my Duty to your Lord&s;hip's Quality better, than to have &s;poken to it in &s;uch Terms; or if it had been Printed, by Order of the Hou&s;e of Lords, I know the Duty of $n Author better, than to meddle with any thing Tran&s;acted in that Honourab e Hou&s;e; but as I met with a Namele&s;s Pamphlet, neither Publi&s;h'd by their Lord&s;hips Authority, nor Sign'd, or own'd by your Lord&s;hip, who&s;e Title it bore, but coming openly into the World loo&s;e, and without a Parent of <HI>Imprimatur,</HI> and with exeeeding warmth, <HI>as I judg'd,</HI> Allarming the Nation; <HI>a$ &s;uch</HI> I Treated it with that Freedom, that I thought it de&s;erv'd; and that in the Nature of the thing, I was at Liberty to do.</P>
<P>Now, tho' I think this a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to the Charge, upon the Man|ner or Language of the <HI>REVIEW,</HI> yet I &s;hall in the En&s;uing Sheats, farther ju&s;tifie and Explain tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, which his Lord&s;hip's, Vindicator Charges upon me as Indecent, <HI>for it is not my way, nor do I approve of Ill Language in Arguments, e&s;pecially to Per&s;ons of his Lord&s;hip's Merit and Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>I Confe&s;s there are in this Paper, &s;ome &s;trong Arguments again&s;t the O|pinion, of its being Genuine. As 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> The Language, very much below his Lord&s;hip, 2<HI>ly.</HI> want of Truth in Fact, 3<HI>ly.</HI> Meanne&s;s of Arguing. And, 4<HI>ly.</HI> Inequality of Subject, all which &s;hock me very much, when I would take this Pa|per to be my Lord <HI>H&mdash;&s;ham</HI>'s, my Re&s;pect for his Lor&s;hip, not per|mitting me to think, his Lord&s;hip could take &s;uch low &s;teps to come out of a Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>I know there are &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ions, which when Men are mov'd by, they remove them at &s;ome Di&s;tance from their Wi&s;dom, and Hurry them into &s;trange Exce&s;&s;es, which their Di&s;cretion can by no means Account for; a|mong the&s;e, I know none affect the Mind &s;o much, as Envy and Party-Strife; and nothing is &s;o low, but the&s;e things will bend the Man to, in hopes ei|ther of An&s;wering his own Ends, or Defeating his Opo&s;itites.</P>
<P>But whoever be the Author of this Paper, I &s;hall let the World &s;ee, that whatever Di&s;re&s;pect Men may think, I &s;how'd to an Anonymous Pamphlet; I know how to behaveto a Member of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, and I &s;hall neither for|get
<PB N="5" REF="4">
his Lord&s;hip's Dignity, NOR WHO GAVE IT HIM; and it am forc'd to any plainne&s;s, his Lord&s;hip may think Indecent, it will be none but what Truth will Extort from me, TO WHICH, <HI>what ever his Lord&s;hip's Vindicator has thought fit to do,</HI> I think my &s;elf Bound to a &s;trict Obedience.</P>
<P>I Confe&s;s, I think the Vindicator does the Author of the <HI>Review</HI> too much Honour, Thus to mea&s;ure his Pen with him, and at the &s;ame time to give him &s;uch Manife&s;t Advantages in point of Fact, and length of Argument; and the Author gives the Vindicator his mo&s;t Humble Thanks, that he is pleasd to De&s;cend to the Cla&s;s of this <HI>mean thing</HI> the <HI>Review,</HI> and with him Appeal to the Wor$d, who this Author mo&s;t willingly Con&s;ents to make Judges in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And as, in all Cafes, he hopes his Lord&s;hip will Grant him full Freedom of Speech, and think it below him to Concern him&s;elf or the Peerage of <HI>Eng|gland,</HI> in an An&s;we$ $word$ a Pamphlet, which has not his Lord&s;hip's Name to it; &s;o he a&s;&s;ures his Lord&s;hip, he will Endeavour to give him Occa&s;ion, to think the Statute of <HI>Sean Magnatum</HI> u&s;ele&s;s in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In Order to this, the Author of the <HI>Review</HI> pa&s;&s;es over at once, all the Ill Language, the Vindicator is pleas'd to be&s;tow upon him, as things, which however in his Wi$dom he may not think below him to &s;toop to, the Author thinks it below his Breeding to return, and cannot think they Illu&s;trate the Vindicator's Arguments enough, to Encourage him to follow the Example, having moreover, &s;o much more Truth and Rea&s;on of his &s;ide, as to &s;tand in no need of Railing to help themout.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t Paragraphs of this Pamphlet, &s;eem to &s;tand one again&s;t a|nother a little, and I ask the Author's Pardon to reconcile them, to which End I mu&s;t take the Freedom to repeat them&mdash;as follows,</P>
<P>THE In&s;ults and Scandalous Reflections that have been made upon me in &s;everal late <HI>Reviews,</HI> tho' they are beyond all Precedent, <Q>yet &s;hould &startq;&endq;have been without any Notice, <HI>had the Author of the&s;e Papers been the only Per&s;on concern'd in them:</HI> but being convinc'd upon Enquiry, from whence he had both his <HI>Encouragement and In&s;tructions,</HI> and being un|willing to be thought guilty by default, or that Silence on my part &s;hould go for Confe&s;&s;ion, or Railing on his part go for Rea|&s;on, I choo&s;e rather to Appeal from the Malicious In&s;inuations and fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions of tho&s;e Papers, to the Candid and Impartial Judg|ment of every unbia&s;s'd Reader, <HI>than take tho&s;e Advantages which his Ra&s;hne&s;s and Impudence,</HI></Q> <HI>perhaps, have given me.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I would not have it thought, I am entering the Li&s;ts with &s;uch a MEAN AND MERCENARY PROSTITUTE as the Au|thor of the <HI>Review:</HI> I know better the Regard due to the Peerage of <HI>England (tho' &s;ome have forgot it)</HI> than to le&s;&s;en either That or my|&s;elf
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to &s;uch a Degree. But when a Per&s;on, my Equal (excepting a few Accidental Ornaments and Advantages which I do not pre|tend to) <HI>who never yet would give me any An&s;wer el&s;ewhere, tho' more than once provok'd to it,</HI> has betaken him&s;elf to &s;uch unu&s;ual and unbeco|ming Methods; 'tis but Ju&s;tice to my &s;elf to let him &s;ee, that as I Court no Man's Favour, &s;o I do not fear any Man's Power &s;o much as to de&s;ert my own ju&s;t De&s;ence in a Compliment.</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, is wholly upon the Poor Author of the <HI>Review,</HI> and any one I believe would imagine his Lord&s;hip'$ Vindicator was entring the Li&s;ts, with this <HI>Mean and Mercenary Pro&s;titute,</HI> as the Vindicator is pleas'd to Call him; and therefore he finds it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to open their Eyes, by adding the Second Paragraph, to let a Certain Per&s;on of Honour know, that <HI>&s;omebody</HI> having try'd a great many ways before to Provoke him to a Re&s;entment, <HI>which he never thought worth his while,</HI> he was Re&s;olv'd to try this of Pam|phletering, and &s;o the Poor <HI>Review</HI> comes in but by the by, like a Man that beats a Dog, nor for any Spleen at the Poor Cur, but to Provoke his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In which al&s;o, he chances to be in the Unhappy Mi&s;take, that he falls foul on another Man's Dog in&s;tead of his Enemies; and THIS CUR takes it &s;o Unkindly, that he tells him of it again as well as he can, in hopes to Convince him of his Error.</P>
<P>But to come to Particulars; The Vindicator offers here, <HI>1&s;t.</HI> That <HI>the Author of the&s;e Papers, is not the only Per&s;on Concern'd in them.</HI> And, 2$$. <HI>He is Convinc'd</HI> upon Enquiry, <HI>from whence he has both his Encouragement and Infiructions,</HI> and on the Foot of the&s;e Sugge&s;tions, I &s;uppo&s;e he can ju&s;tifie the Terms afterwards be&s;tow'd on this Author, of <HI>Mean, Mercenary,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;ti|&s;titute.</HI></P>
<P>I mo&s;t Humbly ask his Pardon for &s;aying, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity forcing me to it in Vin|dication of Truth,</HI> to his Misfortune and MINE TOO, not one Word of the&s;e Articles happens to have the lea&s;t Shadow OF TRUTH in them.</P>
<P>That no Man in <HI>England</HI> has, or ever had any Concern, in Writing the Paper Call'd the <HI>Review,</HI> other than the Author, known and Reputed to be &s;o, I take the Liberty to a&s;&s;ure him, is a certain, po&s;itive, Literal, and Di|rect Truth, and that not &s;o much as Subject, Manner, Time of Subject, or any part of, in, or belonging to it, has been ever Dictated, Sugge&s;ted, be|&s;poke, or de&s;ir'd, or any other way, directly or indirectly, &s;o much as hin|ted, or mov'd to him, by any Per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>And my Certainty of the Truth of this makes it plain, his Lord&s;hip can|not be the Author of this Paper; a Per&s;on of his Lord&s;hip's Dignity, Ve|racity and Judgment, would never run the Ri&s;que of advancing &s;uch a thing, for which I am very well a&s;&s;ur'd, his Grounds mu&s;t be &s;o weak and uncer|tain, and which mu&s;t return upon his Character with &s;o much Di&s;advan|tage.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
The next thing advanc'd in this Vindication is, that he is Convinc'd up|on Enquiry, from whence I have both my Encouragement and In&s;tructions, I confe&s;s I could be very well pleas'd if &s;ome of this <HI>were True;</HI> and that I had either Encouragement or In&s;tructions from any body, in my Re&s;olute pur&s;uit of Truth and Peace; but, <HI>to my Misfortune,</HI> the Fact of this is wrong too; upon what Enquiry the Vindicator may be Convinc'd, I confe&s;s I can|not determine; I know light Information will &s;atisfie &s;ome People of what they would have true; but I mu&s;t beg his Pardon to &s;ay, that certainly his Informer mu&s;t be an Impo&s;tor, and I &s;hould e&s;teem it a piece of Ju&s;tice, that I &s;hould always acknowledge, if his Lord&s;hip or his Vindicator would Vou&s;ch&s;afe to Confront that Evidence, either with me or any other Per&s;on, by or from whom, this Encouragement, and the&s;e In&s;tructions have been receiv'd, and when, or in what manner given; for certainly when both were brought to the Light, he would be convinc'd he was impos'd upon, and re&s;ent it accordingly.</P>
<P>If I were to run through the <HI>Black Li&s;ts,</HI> of the <HI>Encouragements</HI> I have met with in the World, while I have Embark'd my &s;elf in the <HI>Raging Sea</HI> of the Nations Troubles, this Vindicator would be a&s;ham'd to call them En|couragements; how in pur&s;uit of <HI>Peace,</HI> I have brought my &s;elf into innu|merable <HI>Broils;</HI> how many Exa&s;perated by the <HI>&s;ting of Truth</HI> have vow'd my De&s;truction; and <HI>how many ways attempted it:</HI> how I &s;tand alone in the World, abandon'd by tho&s;e very People that own I have <HI>done them Service;</HI> how I am Sold and Bettay'd <HI>by Friends,</HI> Abu&s;ed and Cheated by Barbarous and <HI>&V;nnatural Relations,</HI> &s;u'd for <HI>other Mens</HI> Debts, and &s;trip'd Naked by Publick Inju&s;tice, of what &s;hould have Enabl'd me to <HI>pay my own;</HI> How, with a Numerous Family, and no helps but my own Indu&s;try, I have forc'd my way with undi&s;courag'd Diligence, thro' a Sea of Debt and Misfor|tune, and reduc'd them Exclu&s;ive of Compo&s;ition from 17000 <HI>l.</HI> to le&s;s than 5; how in Gaols, in Retreats, in all manner of Extremeties, I have &s;uppor|ted my &s;elf without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Friends, or Relations, either to me or mine; how I &s;till Live without this Vindicator's &s;ugge&s;ted Methods, and am &s;o far from making my Fortune by this way <HI>of Scribling,</HI> that no Man more de&s;ires a Limitation and Regulation of <HI>the Pre&s;s,</HI> than my &s;elf&punc; e&s;pecially that <HI>Speeches in Parliament</HI> might not be Printed <HI>without Order</HI> of Parliament, and poor Authors Betray'd, to Engage with Men too power|ful for them, in more forcible Arguments than tho&s;e of Rea&s;on; if I &s;hould &s;till acquaint him, that whatever he &s;ugge&s;ts, I &s;hall never &s;tarve, tho' this way of Encouragement were remov'd; and that, were the Trade with <HI>Spain</HI> open, I &s;hall Convince the World of it, by &s;ettling my &s;elf Abroad, where I &s;hall receive better Treatment from both Friend and Enemy than I have here.</P>
<P>The&s;e Melancholy Truths, tho' I confe&s;s my &s;elf full of them, I omit Troubling the World with, only to a&s;&s;ure this Vindicator, that the Encouragements &s;ugge&s;ted to be receiv'd, for the Writing again&s;t the Printed Paper, Call'd a Speech, are meer Fictions of &s;ome Per&s;ons, who
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Court &s;ome Men's Favour at the Expence of their own Hone&s;ty, and de|&s;erve their Re&s;entment, for impo&s;ing upon them.</P>
<P>But then we come to In&s;tructions, and I confe&s;s my &s;elf to have receiv'd &s;ome In&s;tructions in my An&s;wer, from a very Noble Per&s;on, and to whom, I &s;hall always pay a due Acknowledgment for the &s;ame; and this Noble Per|&s;on, let him be who he will, is no body but the Author of that Pamphlet. Entitl'd, my Lord <HI>H&mdash;&s;ham</HI>'s Speech.</P>
<P>The In&s;tructions there given, are &s;o plain, &s;o ea&s;ie, &s;o frequent, and &s;o urgent, that I confe&s;s my &s;elf pre&s;s'd by Invincible Nece&s;&s;ity to an&s;wer for when the <HI>Fact</HI> appear'd &s;o <HI>plain,</HI> the <HI>Sugge&s;tions</HI> &s;o <HI>naked,</HI> and <HI>the $span$ &s;ingular,</HI> who could refrain him&s;elf from &s;peaking? I am therefore accoun|table for nothing but the Truth of what I have &s;aid; and in that I am ready to embrace the wor&s;t Con&s;equences, having been <HI>once ruin'd</HI> for &s;peaking Truth, and <HI>not afraid &s;till</HI> to defend it to the la&s;t Extremities.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the Three Articles which the Vindication advances, I take to have &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion in them; but as they touch, that only Reputation the Fury of Men has left me, I mu&s;t ask Leave to &s;ay a Word or two in my ju&s;t Defence; and tho' the Ca&s;e be too per&s;onal, yet the tedious Vindication of his Lord&s;hip's Per&s;on, is my Precedent.</P>
<P><HI>Mean, Mercenary,</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;titute.</HI> The&s;e are the Titles his Lord&s;hip's Vindicator be&s;tows upon me.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t; Meaner, my Lord, in my own Eyes than in any Man's; and willing to be as mean as Man can make me, for the Service of my Native Country, and the Defence of Truth, Peace, and the Liberty of <HI>England.</HI> But without entring into the Determination of what is or is not to be un|der&s;tood by Honour, I ask his Lord&s;hip's Pardon on this Occa&s;ion, only to value my &s;elf without Pride or Affectation in a manner I never did before. I had the Honour to be Tru&s;ted, E&s;teem'd, and much more than I de&s;erv'd, valued by the be&s;t King, <HI>England</HI> ever &s;aw; and yet who&s;e Judgment I cannot undervalue, becau&s;e he gave his Lord&s;hip his Honour and his Dignity, which was &s;ometime before as mean as M ... But Fate, that makes Footballs of Men, kicks &s;ome up Stairs and &s;ome down; &s;ome are advanc'd without Ho|nou$, others &s;uppre&s;s d without Infamy; &s;ome are rai&s;ed without Merit, &s;ome are $tu&s;h'd without Crime; and no Man knows by the Beginning of things, whe|ther his Cour&s;e &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in a <HI>PEERAGE</HI> or a <HI>PILLORY;</HI> and time was, that no Man could have determin'd it between his Lord&s;hip and this mean Fellow, except tho&s;e that knew his Lord&s;hip's Merit more particularly than Out-&s;ides could have directed. In the Grave we &s;hall come to a Second and more ex|act Equality; and what Difference follows next, will be form'd on no Foot of Advantage from Dignity or Character here; &s;o that this mean Fellow has le&s;s Di&s;parity to &s;truggle with, than the U&s;age of him &s;eems to allow.</P>
<P>But to return to the Days of King <HI>William,</HI> and to Matters of Honour&mdash;If I &s;hould &s;ay I had the Honour to know &s;ome things from his Ma|je&s;ty, and to tran&s;act &s;ome things for his Maje&s;ty, that he would not have tr$$ted $i$ Lord&s;hip with, perhaps there may be more Truth than Mode&s;ty in
<PB N="9" REF="8">
it; and if I &s;hould &s;ay al&s;o, the&s;e Honours done me, help'd to make me that mean thing, &s;ome People &s;ince think fit to repre&s;ent me, perhaps it &s;hould be very true al&s;o.</P>
<P>Thus much for Meanne&s;s, the Charge of which, I thank Heaven is no Crime. A Man ought not to be afraid at any time to be mean, to be hone&s;t; Pardon me therefore, with &s;ome Warmth to &s;ay, That neither the Vindicator, nor all his In|formers, can with their utmo&s;t Inquiry make it appear, that I am, or ever was <HI>Mercenary;</HI> and as there is a Ju&s;tice due from all Men, of what Dignity or Quality &s;oever, to one another, the wrong done me in this, can be Vindica|ted by nothing, but proving the Fact; which I am a mo&s;t Humble Petitio|ner, that he would be pleas'd to do, or el&s;e to give me leave to &s;peak of it in &s;uch Terms, as &s;o great an Injury demands</P>
<P>Here I Appeal from the Pamphlet, Publi&s;h'd in his Lord&s;hip's Name, of which I cannot be &s;ure, whether it be his Lord&s;hip's or no; to that Noble Per&s;onage, My Lord <HI>H&mdash;&s;$am</HI> who I am applying to, and to that Ho|nour, which by his Peerage is accepted in&s;tead of an Oath, even in matters of Life, whether his Lorrd&s;hip can fairly Charge me with one Action in my Life, that can Entitle me to that Scandalous Appellation of a <HI>Mercenary.</HI></P>
<P>No, my Lord, <HI>Pardon my Freedom,</HI> I Contemn and Abhor every thing, and every Man that can be Tax'd with that Name, let his Dig|nity be what it will; I was ever True to one Principle, I never Betray'd my Ma&s;ter or my Friend; I always E&s;pous'd the cau&s;e of Truth and Liberty, was ever on one &s;ide, <HI>and that Side was ever right;</HI> I have Liv'd to be Ruin'd for it, and I have Liv'd to &s;ee it Triumph over Tyrranny, Party-Rage, and Per&s;ecution Principles, <HI>and am &s;orry to &s;ee any Man Abandon it.</HI></P>
<P>I thank God, this World cannot bid a Price &s;ufficient to Bribe me; I confe&s;s, if I were of that Religion, in which I &s;hould think I could Merit Heaven by being a Villain, I know not what I might be prevail'd up|on to do, in hopes of &s;uch Advantage; but for this World, 'tis the Principle I ever liv'd by, and &s;hall e&s;pou&s;e whil&s;t I live, That a Man ought to Dye, rather than betray his Friend, his Cau&s;e, or his Ma&s;ter; I appeal to your Lord|&s;hip's Honour, whether I merit the Scandalous Title of a <HI>Mercenary,</HI> which your Vindicator has Injuriou&s;ly be&s;tow'd upon me.</P>
<P>I own I am a at lo&s;s to know, or indeed to gue&s;s what &s;hould move this Author, while at the &s;ame time he is pleas'd to blame my Language, to fall into this Meanne&s;s him&s;elf, and Attack me with a Mi&s;&s;ive Weapon, which will flye back, and do him more Injury than it can do me.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I have been too long in my own Vindication, and perhaps the Reader may be tyr'd with it, but I Appeal to the occa&s;ion, to prove the Nece&s;&s;ity to it; to be Call'd <HI>Pro&s;titute, Hackney, Tool, Foul Mouth Mungrel,</HI> with a Charm and Protection, that Writes for Bread, and Lives by Defama|tion; In&s;olent Scribler, a Scandalous Pen, Ra&s;h, Impudent, and the like; all the&s;e move me not at all, and only help'd me to judge, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible this Noble Lord could be the Author of it, the Language is &s;o Gro&s;s;
<PB N="10" REF="9">
but to be withall Tax'd with being <HI>Mercenary,</HI> which I am &s;ure this Vindi|cator cannot make out, I thought my &s;elf oblig'd to defend my &s;elf from that Scandal, and I hope all that have any Re&s;pect to Truth, will bear with it.</P>
<P>I come next to the Terms fixt upon in the <HI>Review,</HI> as the Subject, the Vin|dicator Complains of as Abu&s;ive; but con&s;idering his return in kind, 'tis &s;trange he &s;hould object again&s;t Railing: Before I enter upon them, I mu&s;t Com|plain of &s;ome Inju&s;tice in the Collection of them, being put together with|out the Coherence of their Circum&s;tances, and mo&s;t of them very well to be ju&s;tifi'd, when Explain'd by the <HI>Addenda</HI> that &s;tand by them&mdash;See the Pa|ragraph.</P>
<Q>&startq;I begin with the <HI>Reflections made upon my Per&s;on;</HI> and here it looks very unaccountable, how one that has pretended to <HI>&s;o great Modera|tion,</HI> as the Author of the <HI>Review;</HI> &s;hould be carried &s;o much above his <HI>avow'd Principle, in a Matter he is &s;o very little concern'd in.</HI> It mu&s;t certainly be the force of &s;ome <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible Temptation,</HI> or the Oc|cult Quality, and malign Influence of &s;ome <HI>Ruling Star,</HI> that war|med and tran&s;ported this <HI>State-Mountebank,</HI> when he Wrote tho&s;e Pa|pers, to &s;uch a degree above his pretended Moderation. Temper, as to characterize a per&s;on he had not the lea&s;t knowledge of, with as black marks of Infamy as he could invent, or dur&s;t venture upon: <HI>as if for &s;peaking my Mind with the Duty of a Subject and the freedom of an</HI> Engli&s;hman, I became every thing that was not <HI>Scandalum Magnatum.&endq;</HI></Q>
<P>What a Mon&s;ter has one Speech made me, <HI>he &s;ays?</HI> 'tis calculated and &s;crew'd up to a pitch of Malecontent and Chagin; as if done on purpo&s;e to &s;our the Nation, and printed with an unpeaceable and mi&s;chievous meaning; to be de&s;ign'd to keep alive a Malecontent Party; by a Mouth bent to Noi&s;e and Reflection; by a per&s;on malign to the Settlement, in hopes to rai&s;e grounds of Clamour; and as one who has a great many ill Ends; that it was &s;poke with Freedom that con&s;i&s;ts not <HI>any where</HI> with Duty, Allegiance, Truth, Sen&s;e or Re&s;pect; with Expectation to force a Fortune by railing at his Betters, reviling the Ruler of the People, accu&s;ing the Innocent, to plea&s;e and court a Party; &s;poken like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s fool with his Eyes in the Ends of the Earth; propo&s;ing what is ridiculous and incongruous; calculated to revive the beats and dying Quarrels in the Nation, and encourage the follies that Madmen make u&s;e of to ruin the Country in &s;uch Ca&s;es; by a per&s;on, who&s;e fancied Reputation to them that did not know he had&mdash;it, might &s;erve to pu&s;h on the &s;pe|cious Sham to an Extremity, and to bya&s;s hone&s;t ignorant people in his fa|vour, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The Ju&s;tice of Goverment, has no manner of Dependence upon the Power of it, and our being &s;uperior to the <HI>Scots</HI> in Strength, tho' that Pre&s;umption once co&s;t the Lives of 30000 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, is far from being a Rea&s;on, why they &s;hould not have an Act of Security, nor why the Queen &s;hould not pa&s;s it; and to have advi&s;ed Her Maje&s;ty again&s;t it, had been indeed to &s;how the Politician, but to conceal the hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>We all know the Drift of the&s;e Men, tho' 'tis &s;ome Subject of Wonder to &s;ee this Noble Per&s;on fall in with it; we &s;ee plainly enough the De&s;ign of the Party was to have forc'd the&s;e Nations upon a War; and the fir&s;t Pro|ject was, if po&s;&s;ible, to provoke and exa&s;perate the <HI>Scots,</HI> &s;o as to make them Aggre&s;&s;ors; but when they found the <HI>Scots</HI> had no fools about them, rather than fail, they will pu&s;h the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation upon it, by making Laws to fall upon the <HI>Scots</HI> fir&s;t; and the weak Pretence of this, mu&s;t be their Trading with <HI>France,</HI> which at the &s;ame time we agree to in our Neighbours, <HI>Practice our &s;elves as to</HI> Spain, where we &s;ee it our Intere&s;t, and &s;hould do &s;o to <HI>France</HI> al&s;o, if we did not &s;tand in our own Light.</P>
<P>To provide for their own Safety, the <HI>Scots</HI> make Acts of Security, and her Maje&s;ty pa&s;&s;es them; and the&s;e Gentlemen accu&s;e tho&s;e that advi&s;e the Queen to do it, of being fal&s;e to <HI>England.</HI> The Que&s;tion is &s;hort, was her Maje&s;ty, as Queen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> oblig'd in Honour, and by Oath, to do every thing for the Good and Safety of her Subjects of that Kingdom or no? If in the Negative, <HI>let me de&s;ire tho&s;e Gentlemen that &s;ay &s;o,</HI> to read the Declaration of Right, on the Foot of which the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ettled their Crown on her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, then Prince&s;s, and on which her Maje&s;ty entred upon the Royal Ad|mini&s;tration; and then an&s;wer again, <HI>if in the Affirmative,</HI> where was the Error of advi&s;ing her Maje&s;ty to do that which by her Oath, by the <HI>Po&s;tu|lata</HI> of Government, by her Duty, as the Royal Parent of her People, her Maje&s;ty lay under Indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligations to do?</P>
<P>But as the&s;e things tended to prevent the De&s;ign of embroiling the Nations, and &s;etting on foot a High Church War, &s;o it thwarted the Mea&s;ures of tho&s;e times.

This is but a little of what might be &s;aid on this Subject, but may &s;erve to let the Reader into the Secret of all this Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to open their Under|&s;tandings who were at a Lo&s;s to know why &s;ome People were &s;o angry, that the Queen pa&s;s'd &s;uch Laws in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;uffered the <HI>Scots</HI> to make Pro|vi&s;ions for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nor can it be u&s;ele&s;s to note, That abundance of Ignorant People were re|ally prejudic'd with the&s;e things, and thought her Maje&s;ty had done hardly by <HI>England,</HI> and that they that advi&s;ed tho&s;e things, ought to be hang'd, that the <HI>Scots</HI> were bound to do as we bid them, That our King or Queen mu&s;t be theirs.

<P>The&s;e ignorant Notions &s;erv'd very well to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their Kind, to the De|&s;ign; and tho' tho&s;e Gentlemen at the Helm of this Matter knew better, yet it favour'd of the &s;ame thing, to reproach tho&s;e Mini&s;ters of State with a Crime, in Advi&s;ing the Queen to do that in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which, in Ju&s;tice, Her Ma|je&s;ty could not deny; as if the Queen and Her Council, were to act with <HI>Scotland</HI> purely with a Re&s;pect to the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> &s;eparately con&s;ider'd, and not the Right of the two Nations, or Her Maje&s;ty's indi&s;pen&s;able Obliga|tions, as Queen of both.</P>
<P>If any Mini&s;ter of State &s;hifted off his Acting thus, as this Paper offers at, it is Matter of Wonder to me, &s;ince whoever he be, he can have no better In&s;cription written on his Monument than, <HI>That for the Honour of</HI> England, <HI>he &s;corn'd to Advi&s;e Her Maje&s;ty, again&s;t Di&s;charging the Character and Debt of a Ju&s;t Prince&s;s to Her Subjects of</HI> Scotland, <HI>tho' again&s;t our &s;eeming Intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, the Intere&s;t of Kingdoms ought to be con&s;ider'd by State&s;men, and a Wi&s;e Prince always &s;tudies the Good of his People, but Ju&s;tice mu&s;t never bow to Intere&s;t; we may be wi&s;e, but we mu&s;t be hone&s;t; and the whole is to be defended both ways, of which I could &s;ay a great deal more, if the Shortne&s;s of this Di&s;cour&s;e would permit.</P>
<P>I could enlarge here on the Beginnings of this Clamour again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> by whom rais'd, and by whom handed on, to &s;uch Fatal Extremes; but as that would run me back to <HI>Another Noble Speech,</HI> and embroil me again with Per&s;ons as well as Things, I omit it here; only take the Liberty to &s;ay, there were more Pa&s;&s;ions than tho&s;e of Fear concern'd, in our being &s;o much alarm'd at the <HI>Scots</HI> making an Act for their own Security, if not, &s;ome other Mea|&s;ures <HI>to provoke them farther,</HI> would never have been the Con&s;equences; for People really apprehen&s;ive of Danger, never &s;tudy to make it greater, at lea&s;t, if they are in their Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>But this cannot but be noted, that as the fir&s;t Seeds of this National Di&s;|content are found taking Root in the very Center of their Religious Settlement, and the Quarrel was fairly driving to a Head between Prelacy and Presbytery, 'tis &s;omething unaccountable, to &s;ee &s;ome People e&s;pou&s;ing it, who were al|ways

e&s;teem'd to favour the latter, and from whom other Things were always expected.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Things are no &s;tranger, than to hear Arguments from another Hand, for Acquainting the Succe&s;&s;or with our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prelates;&mdash;a Thing, had it happen'd at another Time, would have gone farther towards Confirming the Opinion of our <HI>Bi&s;hops being turn'd Presbyterians,</HI> than all the Clamour of the High Church could do for two Years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans,</HI> a Generous Nation, &s;corn'd to &s;ubdue their very Enemies upon Di&s;honourable Terms; and therefore, when &s;ome of their Citizens offer'd to betray them, &s;ent them back to be puni&s;h'd by their Ma&s;ters; <HI>Scot|land</HI> is not &s;o con&s;iderable a Nation, that we &s;hould be afraid to do them Ju|&s;tice; nor &s;o incon&s;iderable a Nation, that we &s;hould pre&s;ume to do them In|jury; the Governments are di&s;tinct and independent, the Queen acts in a double Cpacity with Re&s;pect to the Admini&s;tration, and is oblig'd to regard Ju&s;tice to both without Bya&s;s, or private Re&s;pect; <HI>the</HI> Scots <HI>are not Govern'd by Our Queen, but we are Govern'd by theirs;</HI> and let the Di&s;parity of Nations be what it will, Ju&s;tice is the Foundation, and the re&s;pective Con&s;titutions are the re&s;pective Modes of the Government of either.</P>

I allow, unle&s;s his Lord&s;hip will Abate the Extent of his Power, I have not room to Debate with him on the Merits of this Cau&s;e; but I humbly offer, that if the Vindicator will intercede with his Lord&s;hip, to wave tho&s;e, <HI>as I think $$$$bitant</HI> Advantages, that I may freely &s;peak Truth, I will prove it incon&s;i&s;tent, &amp;c. as be|fore, to his Lord&s;hips Satisfaction, or publickly ask his Pardon: Why his Lord&s;hip was not &s;ent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> is nothing to me, any more than why I am not <HI>&s;ome where el&s;e,</HI> is to the Vindicator, &s;ince I cannot &s;ee that I gave any Offence to Ju&s;tice in what I offer'd.</P>
<P>Come we next to the Vindicator's Defence of the Propo&s;al, about the Pre&s;umptive Heir being &s;ent for Over; as follows,</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;'Tis very wonderful, after all, <HI>that a Propo&s;al for Inviting Over the Pre&s;umptive Heir to the Crown,</HI> &s;hould expo&s;e a Man to all this virulent Fury: That a Per&s;on only for mentioning it, &s;hould be called by the Names of Mr. <HI>Politicus, Speaking Trumpet, Grating Sam,</HI> &amp;c. Whoever have read <HI>Great</HI> Britain<HI>'s &V;nion, and the Secu|rity of the</HI> Hannover Succe&s;&s;ion <HI>con&s;idered,</HI> will find that Matter was thought on many Months before the Paper, called <HI>Mercu|rius Politicus</HI> ever appear'd. And tho' the Reviewer is very free in calling this a Ridiculous propo&s;al, incongruous and incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the General Good; yet, perhaps this very Per&s;on would not have been &s;o very confident, had he &s;een (as I have) <HI>the Extract of the Prince&s;s</HI> Sophia<HI>'s An&s;wer,</HI> dated <HI>November</HI> 3. 1705&punc; to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>'s Letter; in which are the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI> I am <HI>ready and willing to comply with whatever can be de&s;ired of me by my Friends, in ca&s;e that the Parliament think that it is for the good of the Kingdom to invite me into</HI> England. Some Men reading this, I doubt not, will think again. If we only con&s;idered <HI>what that</HI> Propo&s;al <HI>has produc'd,</HI> it might de&s;erve (one would think) better Language. We have had &s;everal Acts of Parliament relating to the Security of the Succe&s;&s;ion <HI>look'd into &s;ince,</HI> and <HI>their Defects cured;</HI> by which it appears, that the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion was not &s;o &s;afe as was generally imagined: <HI>A Bill for Na|turalizing the</HI> Prince&s;s Sophia <HI>and her I&s;&s;ue,</HI> and another to <HI>E&s;tab|li&s;h a Regency (in ca&s;e of the Queen's Demi&s;e)</HI> &s;ent down to the Hou&s;e of Commons, which tho&s;e that framed and con&s;ented to, thought no doubt, a <HI>Security to the Succe&s;&s;ion:</HI> And yet there was no$ $word$ lea&s;t Appearance of the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion's being &s;o much as thought</HI> $span$ when t$is Propo&s;al <HI>was made:</HI> So that not to $span$ Con&s;ideration, how far the&s;e Expedients will be a

Security, if they prove, as they are thought Great Ones; <HI>he thar gave the Occa&s;ion and Ri&s;e to them,</HI> &s;ure, only for that, cannot de&s;erve to be thus treated.</Q></P>
<P>Strange! that Anger &s;hould &s;o blind Men of Judgment and Sen&s;e, that they cannot &s;ee &s;o far then, as at another time. Now, that the Reader may not Entertain &s;uch General Prejudice without Rea&s;on, as is here intimated, I appeal to the <HI>Review,</HI> N^o 113. <HI>P.</HI> 450. <HI>Col.</HI> 2. <Q>&startq;&endq;I know this Article has been &s;tarted in Print be|fore now, by an Author, who&s;e Principle is as well known as his Paper; and as his Propo&s;al I &s;hall &s;peak to it.&mdash;Now Mr. <HI>Politicus,</HI></Q> as this Author would be call'd, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine, my Lord <HI>Haver&s;ham</HI> can &s;uppo&s;e I could Treat him &s;o, or that he can be &s;poken to here, and wonder the Vindicator &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it for him: 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Becau&s;e he is expre&s;ly told, that he is not. 2<HI>dly.</HI> 'Tis expre&s;sly pointed at, who is &s;poken to. 3<HI>dly.</HI> No Body but he, that is re&s;olv'd to mi&s;take, can be &s;o mi&s;taken, the Author of <HI>Mercurius Politicus</HI> having publickly Debated this Point; nor does it argue his Lord&s;hip mu&s;t be meant, becau&s;e another Paper mentioned it before <HI>Mercurius Politicus:</HI> No, tho' his Lord&s;hip had been Author of that Paper, becau&s;e 'tis here directly told, <HI>who I &s;peak to, and who not.</HI></P>
<P>But here comes a Strong Argument, to plead for better Treat|ment; That &s;ince &s;tarting this Propo&s;al, produc'd more Acts of Se|curity it had that way a good Effect; and on that Account, de&s;erv'd better Treatment. I mu&s;t ask the Vindicator's Pardon, to make an Allu&s;ion or two here. K. <HI>James</HI>'s Male-Admini&s;tration produc'd the Revolution, the Declaration of the Rights and Li|berties of the People, and Abundance of good Laws to &s;ecure Pro|perty, Religion, Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;He that gave the Occa&s;ion and Ri&s;e to the&s;e things &s;ure <HI>Only for that,</HI></Q> cannot de&s;erve to be thus Treated: If the Vindicator wou'd tell us, That his Lord&s;hip made the Propo&s;al for that End, I allow it &amp; <HI>Erit mihi Magnus Appollo;</HI> but if it was only the Ef|fect of the Nation being awaken'd at the Surprize of the De&s;igns they &s;aw on foot, the Merit then lies too deep for my &s;hort &s;ight, and I think it has no more, than the Tacking Propo&s;al of a former Parliament had the Merit of the Peoples &s;ending up Wi&s;er Repre&s;entatives to this.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the Wi&s;dom of Providence has been very vi&s;ible, that has Reviv'd <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s Riddle among us, <HI>brought Meat out of the&s;e Eaters;</HI> and all the Mon&s;ters of a Certain Party have been a&s;&s;i&s;tant, to Fright the Nation, not <HI>Out of,</HI> but <HI>Into their Sen&s;es,</HI> and &s;o have

produc'd Good Effects to us all: But it mu&s;t be noted withal, That it has been contrary, both to their Expectation, and to their De&s;ire; and if I think the &s;ame, in the Ca&s;e before me, I am afraid I gue&s;s too right to be convinc'd by the Con&s;equences; and where, I be|&s;eech you, lies the Merit of all this?
<Q><L>Before I &s;ay any more, I mu&s;t go on with the Text.</L></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>But I fear there are other Rea&s;ons that have rai&s;ed &s;ome Per|&s;on's Spleen: Some perhaps are angry to have heard it &s;aid where it was,</HI> That there was &s;o great a Favourite as the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI> in King <HI>James</HI> I. his time, who (as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador told his Maje&s;ty) had Be&s;ieged him, had Enclo&s;ed him with his own Va&s;&s;als and Servants, and would &s;uffer no one el&s;e to have his Maje&s;ty's Ear, or &s;o much as come near his Pre&s;ence, and yet that great Man never had half that Power and Favour, that we &s;ee &s;ome Per&s;ons now-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>They care not to hear of</HI> Taxes laid upon all Court-Preterments, <HI>or of Per&s;ons being &s;o</HI> fat with Favour aud great Offices, as make them in&s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity a great part of the Nation labours under.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>Others do not like it &s;hould be &s;aid, That</HI> whenever there is a Di&s;pute between a Parliament and a Mini&s;ter, either the Mini&s;ter will be too hard for the Parliament; and there's an End of your Con&s;titution: or the Parliament will be too hard for your Mini&s;ter, and there's an End of your Mini&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>Here 'tis apparent who this Paper aims at; That the <HI>Review</HI> is made but the Shadow or Guide for the Bowle, the Point ca&s;t at is plain, the Mini&s;ters of State are aim'd at, and the <HI>Review</HI> mu&s;t be a Tool employ'd by them, or el&s;e Rallying him would not reach them. Thus I am brought in for a Place; but God knows, with|out a Salary, I mu&s;t have a Pen&s;ion! I wi&s;h he was not in the wrong; for as I have hitherto &s;aid nothing but the Truth, I know nothing Di&s;honourable in being &s;o Encourag'd to &s;peak; but 'tis my Misfortune that it is not &s;o; but on the contrary, I am the mean Thing my Author e&s;teems me, for &s;peaking that Truth which all the World has &s;ince found true, and that no Man feels the Inju|ry of, but I and my Family.</P>
<P>Now let us Examine what is the Ca&s;e here, <HI>The pre&s;ent Mini&s;try,</HI> like the Old Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> Be&s;iege and Enclo&s;e Her Maje&s;ty, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">
<HI>Well!</HI> And pray what did the la&s;t Mini&s;try do? Did not they do &s;o too? I need go no further than my &s;elf, to affirm that I found it &s;o, when the humble&s;t and mo&s;t diligent Applications for Capitulated Ju&s;tice, could not by the mo&s;t powerful Interce&s;|&s;ions, ever obtain a true Repre&s;entation to Her Maje&s;ty, but met with the Interruptions of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who thought it their Intere&s;t to ruin a Man they could not&mdash;</P>
<P>But let us come to the Hi&s;torical In&s;tance quoted, The Diffe|rence of Men makes the Difference of Ca&s;es, Favourites have al|ways been obnoxious to the People of <HI>England;</HI> and as the <HI>Vindi|cator</HI> ob&s;erves well, <Q>&startq;&endq;they were either too hard for the Parliament, or the Parliament for them.</Q>&mdash;But the Ca&s;es differ, and he has the Unhappine&s;s to fall upon a Mini&s;try, that are the Peoples Fa|vourites and the Queen's too; a Thing perfectly unknown in tho&s;e Times, and are maligned <HI>Only by a Party,</HI> becau&s;e they do what cou'd not be done before, becau&s;e the War is carry'd on by Ge|nerals and Admirals that &s;tick clo&s;e to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and hazard all for the Publick, and fewer Expeditions are made in vain than us'd to be; becau&s;e the Credit of the Trea&s;ury is recover'd, and even the Scarcity of Money cannot ballance the exqui&s;ite Husban|dry and Conduct of him that &s;uperintends there, becau&s;e Foreign Negotiations are not betray'd, and Intelligence is carry'd on at a Nicer Rate than under the Management of greater Pretenders; becau&s;e Her Maje&s;ty is a Prince&s;s, that can judge and di&s;tingui&s;h when &s;he is well and ill &s;erv'd, and will not hear every Malicious In&s;inuation again&s;t tho&s;e that do Her Bu&s;ine&s;s faithfully; therefore She is <HI>Be&s;ieg'd and Enclos'd.</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;ing the Fact, tho' I do not grant it; here are King <HI>James</HI> the $word$ and Queen <HI>Ann Be&s;ieg'd</HI> and <HI>Enclos'd</HI> by Favourites; let us examine the Parallel.</P>
<P>King <HI>James,</HI> by one ab&s;olute Reigning, Encroaching Per&s;on; Her Maje&s;ty, by many, for he calls them <HI>Per&s;ons;</HI> and when Tyranny is Exerted, 'tis always more Dangerous in one, than in many Hands.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI>'s Favourite was an Up&s;tart, of mean Birth, mean Cha|racter, and wor&s;e Principles; &s;ingl'd out by the King for nothing but his Out&s;ide, and his fine Dancing.

<P>Our Secretaries of State will be detected of Betraying the Coun|cils, and Negotiations of the State, expo&s;ing the Prince to the Scandal, Ridicule and Contempt of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as it was in <HI>Ditto</HI> Time and Per&s;on, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Count Gondamor,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Match, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Our Admirals and Generals will be detected of Betraying their Confederates, not Relieving their Di&s;tre&s;s'd Allies, &s;uffering be|&s;ieg'd Towns to be &s;tarv'd before their Faces, and a hundred more &s;uch Treacheries <HI>Ala-made,</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>Rhe,</HI> and the City of <HI>Ro|chelle.</HI></P>
<P>If &s;uch things as the&s;e can be made out, for God &s;ake, for the Na|tion's &s;ake, for the Queen's &s;ake, and for our own Honour's &s;ake, let us impeach them, and bring them to Light. We cannot doubt but the Parliament will be too hard for the Mini&s;ter, when there is Guilt of his &s;ide, and &s;uch things as the&s;e can be brought on the Stage; and I cannot gue&s;s but the Vindicator &s;up|po&s;es the&s;e things, or he, would never have brought the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> for a Parallel, which, without the&s;e Circum&s;tances, is as $ame as the re&s;t of the Charge.</P>
<P>Now the Author of the Vindication is pleas'd (by way of Re|ce&s;s, and to give the Reader Breath) to take another Step below him&s;elf, and to fall foul upon the poor Author of the <HI>Review</HI> a|gain.</P>

<P>To this I &s;hall give a &s;hort Reply; That I am &s;o far from the fear of &s;tarving, tho' Exceedingly pre&s;s'd and pur&s;u'd by Men of a Par|ty, that for the &s;ake of Publick Peace, I de&s;ire nothing more than a Regulation of the Pre&s;s; and for my own Ca&s;e, I leave it to Pro|vidence;
<PB N="23" REF="24">
I neither ask the Vindicator's Charity, nor Con|cerns.</P>
<P>The next Paragraph in the Vindication is a Quotation out of the <HI>Review,</HI> and needle&s;s to repeat, the Vindicator &s;aying nothing, but that it is a Two-edg'd Scandal; and I al&s;o &s;ay nothing till he &s;hall think fit farther to Explain him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We are now come to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> and of <HI>Overy&s;che</HI> again; and here the Vindication is pleas'd to &s;tate the Matter of Fact, as follows.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The next thing I am charg'd with, is, <HI>a heightning the Mi&s;carri|ages of the War, rendring our Allies &s;u&s;pected, and loading the</HI> Dutch <HI>and</HI> Imperiali&s;ts, <HI>as if they had betray'd and abandoned us.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;But the very &s;tating Matter of Fact is enough to wipe off this Scandal. There were two great Attempts de&s;ign'd (be&s;ides the pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>French</HI> Lines) this la&s;t Campaign, worthy the Conduct of our General, <HI>viz.</HI> That on the <HI>Mozelle,</HI> and that at <HI>Overi&s;ch, had either of which &s;ucceeded, it had &s;oon put an end to this chargeable War;</HI> and that they did not &s;ucceed, is known to every body: I would then ask any Man, to whom are the&s;e two Di&s;appointments to be imputed? The An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, I doubt not, would clear me from all the Malicious In&s;inuations of this In&s;olent Scribbler. Is it po&s;|&s;ible for any Man to imagine the D. of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;would have march'd the Grand Army &s;ome hundred Miles, upon a De|&s;ign he knew he was not &s;trong enough to put in Execution, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI>'s Army, which he mu&s;t have depended upon? Can any Man think that Matter was not fir&s;t concerted? And if &s;o, whence was it, that when the D. of <HI>M.</HI> had covered that Prince from the <HI>French,</HI> he was not joyn'd by him as was expected? <HI>By which Conjunction</HI> Saar Louis, <HI>which the</HI> French <HI>left uncover'd, had fall'n into our Hands, and a free and ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age open'd into</HI> France; <HI>and for want of which, a very promi&s;ing De&s;ign was totally defeat|ed:</HI> (And as the Reviewer confe&s;&s;es) <HI>our Affairs had a bad A&s;|pect at the unhappy baulk at the</HI> Mozelle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Again, in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Overi&s;ch, did not the</HI> Dutch <HI>Deputies march near three Days in Company with the D. of</HI> M. <HI>and in all that time did they ever make any exception against his De&s;ign:</HI> yet whenit came to be put in Execution, when a fair opportunity of|fer'd, and Victory in a manner courted us, there not being half the Danger and Difficulty there asat <HI>Blenheim;</HI> Could any Argu|ments per&s;wade them to con&s;ent to venture a Battel?

And mu&s;t I only not be allowed to &s;peak of &s;uch things without lying under the La&s;h of a Scandalous Pen, and look'd upon as an Enemy to the Confederates? But the mo&s;t wonderful part of all this, is, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who before were &s;o full of tho&s;e Matters, that they could &s;carce forbear &s;hewing their Re&s;ent|ment of the u&s;age the D. of <HI>M</HI> met with, have ever &s;ince this was mentioned by me, made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to give it a quiet different turn. However, let this Snarler, or tho&s;e who imploy him, be as angry as they plea&s;e; when I read the joint Addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es of Parliament (which he might have been more Ingenious than to have mangled as he has done) and read how earne&s;tly they intreat Her Maje&s;ty, 'By all proper means to excite the whole Confede|racy to make early and effectual preparations, and to exert their utmo&s;t Vigour in the pro&s;ecution of the War again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> I mu&s;t be of opinion, that they had very good Grounds for what they did, which &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifies me.</Q></P>
<P>That the baulk of the <HI>Mo&s;elle</HI> gave an unhappy Turn to our Af|fairs, I never denied, that the Dutch Deputies prevented a Fight at <HI>Overy&s;che.</HI> I allow, and had his Lord&s;hip &s;aid no more in his Speech before, than is &s;aid in this <HI>State of the Fact,</HI> I &s;hould have &s;aid very little to the thing, if I had taken notice of it at all.</P>
<P>But as to <HI>Hightening Mi&s;carriages,</HI> and <HI>Rendring our Ailies &s;u&s;pected,</HI> I do &s;ay &s;till, with all re&s;pect to his Lord&s;hips Speech, that Printed Paper I was upon, let it be what it will, is in my Opinion fairly chargeable with it.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Germans</HI> did not joyn, is true, but the Paper &s;ays ex|pre&s;ly, they might <HI>very ea&s;ily have joyn'd,</HI> of which this Vindication does not &s;ay one word how. Now to affirm, they <HI>could,</HI> and <HI>did not,</HI> which is to &s;ay, they <HI>would not:</HI> I cannot but think fairly amounts to a rendring <HI>them &s;u&s;pected</HI> and hightening the Mi&s;carriage: if I am mi&s;taken here, I'll readily ask pardon, but I cannot yet &s;ee it &s;o much as po&s;&s;ible to be a mi&s;take, nor do I &s;ee the lea&s;t at|tempt made, to prove that Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> was in a conditi|on to joyn; however were he in never &s;o good a condition, were it pique, di&s;&s;atisfaction, or any thing of that nature that hindred, yet the matter alledged here mu&s;t be right, becau&s;e that part is not offer|ed to be prov'd.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="25" REF="26">
2. As to the Dutch&mdash;I know great clamour has been rai&s;ed on that Affair, and I believe his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had &s;ome Per&s;ons there who he had rea&s;on to complain of, tho' I cannot &s;ee it lies at the Door of the Dutch Deputies at all, who march'd three days doubtle&s;s with a de&s;ign to fight, but let us &s;et things in a true light.</P>
<P>The Paper I mentioned, does not blame particular Men, but <HI>the States</HI> under a National Term, <HI>the Dutch,</HI> if you will then call private Mi&s;carriages the Actions of a Government; <HI>why then,</HI> the Engli&s;h Nation will come in for &s;ome Shares, upon account of &s;ome mi&s;s-be|haviour of private Per&s;ons, in which our Allies have &s;uffered as well as we; when our Engli&s;h Guards fled at <HI>Landen;</HI> when our Engli&s;h Fleet abandon'd the <HI>Catalans;</HI> when our Navy Royal left the Enter|prize at <HI>Cadiz:</HI> Were all the&s;e Treacheries of the Nation, or of pri|vate Men omitting their Duty? and would it not be very hard that the&s;e private Mens Errors &s;hould be charg'd upon the whole Nation? We have great rea&s;on to believe his Grace has received &s;atisfaction in that point, and the Government al&s;o by the very good Corre|&s;pondence remaining.</P>
<P>And yet I cannot but add an Opinion here of my own, with re|lation to the Dutch whether it concerns this ca&s;e or no.</P>
<P>We never find the Dutch &s;paring of their Bones upon any rea&s;ona|ble occa&s;ion, if at a di&s;tance from home, nor are they &s;hy of commit|ting the command of their Troops to our Generals. Witne&s;s their 8000 Men under Prince <HI>Lewis,</HI> their Army on the <HI>Danube,</HI> under the Duke of <HI>Marlborough;</HI> their Army in <HI>Catalonia</HI> under my Lord <HI>Peterbo|rough;</HI> Witne&s;s their Fleets always under our Admirals; But when the War is on their own Frontiers, and the Armies at their Doors, when on the lea&s;t Defeat or Di&s;appointment, the Enemy is in their Bowels in 24 Hours, and &s;ome of their capital Fortre&s;&s;es are expo&s;ed, This alters the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Dutch are a numerous, a rich and a trading Nation, they have a great deal to lo&s;e, and it lies in a little compa&s;s, and the lea&s;t mi&s;carriage expo&s;es them to infinite damage before they can look a|bout them: A remarkable in&s;tance of which we had, when the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> received but a little &s;lip or <HI>go by</HI> from the <HI>French, who,</HI> had he not made one of the mo&s;t daring as well as Politick Retreats that has been known in the&s;e Ages, had over-run all the Dutch <HI>Guelder|land,</HI> and <HI>as it was</HI> &s;how'd them&s;elves in two days at the Gates of <HI>Nimeugen.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are good rea&s;ons why the Dutch are very wary, and indeed ought to be &s;o, when the War is &s;o near home; for this rea&s;on it has been the con&s;tant u&s;age of the States to have Deputies with their Ar|mies,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
without who&s;e Con&s;ent, even their own Generals are not to act; the&s;e they always had, 'tis the Law of their Country, and we do not &s;ee when it was ever di&s;pen&s;ed with, but in a few of the latter Years of King <HI>William,</HI> occa&s;ioned by their Confidence in the Con&s;umate Experience, as well as affectionate Care for their Safety, in that Immortal Prince.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things con&s;idered, the <HI>Dutch</HI> ought to run no Ri&s;ques, War is uncertain; to &s;ay that Action would have ended the War, is more than a Man of Experience ought to conclude, <HI>Multi Cadunt inter Calicem Supremaque Labra;</HI> but in War the Uncertainties are In|finite; to &s;ay the Probabilities were greater than at <HI>Blenheim,</HI> is clenching it indeed; for I mu&s;t tell this Author, I &s;hould think the <HI>Dutch</HI> reduc'd to &s;ad Nece&s;&s;ities, if they &s;hould hazard All as it was there. The Difficulties and Improbabilities of the Action at <HI>Blenheim</HI> were &s;uch, That had not the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> &s;een an Ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of Pu&s;hing the <HI>French,</HI> and a Noble Superiori|ty in the Goodne&s;s of his Troops, and above all, led on by the In&s;pirations of Fate, he would not have Attack'd the <HI>French</HI> Army under all tho&s;e Di&s;advantages of Po&s;t, and Inferiority of Number; and I que&s;tion not, and have good Rea&s;on to &s;ay it; Had that Ac|tion Mi&s;carry'd, the Improbabilities which now tend to the Im|mortal Honour of our Nation, and of that Gallant Prince, would have been improv'd to Defame him, Scandalize his Di&s;cretion, and perhaps, carry'd on, if po&s;&s;ible, to his De&s;truction.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay much more to this, but 'tis enough; remote from Home, where, if defeated, they can have time to turn round, collect their Forces, and defend them&s;elves: None are forwarder for Action than the <HI>Dutch;</HI> at their own Door they are wary, and Infinite Rea&s;ons ju&s;tify them in it; they were always &s;o, we confe|derated with them under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, and ought to expect it; to &s;ay they held our Hands from Fini&s;hing the War, is as un|certain, as to &s;ay, That taking <HI>Saar Louis</HI> would open a Way into <HI>France</HI> is Un-Geographical: For which I refer the <HI>Vindicator</HI> to his Maps, where he will find, that the <HI>Mare&s;chall Villars</HI> cover'd the Entrance into <HI>France,</HI> and left <HI>Saar Louis,</HI> to take its Fate; after which they mu&s;t have Fought him in his Entrench|ments, before they had attempted to pu&s;h into <HI>France,</HI> or have pa&s;s|ed the <HI>Mozelle</HI> in his Sight, or have gon up and Be&s;ieg'd <HI>Metz,</HI> and left him behind them; neither of which would have been to be done without Extreme Hazard; for they had the <HI>Mozelle</HI> and the <HI>Maes</HI> to have pa&s;&s;ed before they came to the Frontiers of <HI>France;</HI> and whenever they had pu&s;h'd things to that heighth, the <HI>French</HI> $ad Detachments to make from <HI>Flanders,</HI> which they never &s;aw Danger enough to do.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">
I know 'tis argued, that a Concert between the <HI>French</HI> and Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;eem'd probable, for that no Detachments were made from <HI>Flanders</HI> to the <HI>Mozelle,</HI> from whence &s;ome concluded the <HI>French</HI> knew that Prince would do them no harm.</P>
<P>But to me it &s;eems as probable, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;aw the <HI>Germans</HI> were not in a Condition of Joyning; or that the mo&s;t they could attempt, if they joyn'd, was the Seige of <HI>Saar-Louis;</HI> which being very &s;trong, and well provided, would make a Vigorous Defence, that Moun&s;ieur <HI>Villars</HI> was &s;trong enough Encamp'd, not to fear an Attack, and that their Superiority of Force in <HI>Flanders,</HI> would certainly be &s;o u&s;eful to them, as would be worth &s;acrifizing <HI>Saar Louis,</HI> to Enjoy the Advantage.</P>
<P>And this Conjecture of mine, tho' weak, I make from two Ob|&s;ervations; Fir&s;t, That they immediately pu&s;h'd at the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ar|my, attack'd <HI>Huy;</HI> and had not the D. of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> with the Vigour and Expedition, like the re&s;t of his Great Actions, imme|diately Countermarch't, they would have form'd the Siege of <HI>Mae|&s;tricht,</HI> as &s;oon as the D. of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> had the <HI>Germans</HI> joyn'd him, could have form'd that of <HI>Saar Louis;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> ea&s;ily &s;aw they could fetch the Confederate Army back from the <HI>Mozelle,</HI> be|fore the Confederate Army could fetch theirs from the <HI>Maes:</HI> Secondly, I conclude thus, becau&s;e we find Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> has not tainted his Honour &s;ince, but acted afterwards very vigorou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;&s;fully again&s;t the Enemy.</P>
<P>Thus all the&s;e wilful Mi&s;takes fall to the Ground, and all the Exclamations again&s;t them, I think, are ju&s;tly charg'd with De|&s;igns, to <HI>render our Confederates &s;u&s;pected.</HI></P>
<P>My examining the next Matters will farther explain it, when we come to tho&s;e Trifles, the Vindication calls Ridiculous, and meer Cavils; which, tho' they are but &s;mall Matters, will in their kind, illu&s;trate great; &s;uch as are the Expre&s;&s;ions, of <HI>coming into the Field, when we were going into Quarters;</HI> thus <HI>ended your Campaign,</HI> and the like&mdash;as in the following Paragraph.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;There is one thing more, which is &s;o very ridiculous, 'tis &s;carce worth notice, <HI>viz.</HI> how this Learned Critick labours, and is put to it, <HI>to bring the Bu&s;ine&s;s of</HI> Barcelona <HI>within the Con&s;tru|ction of what I &s;aid.</HI> 'Tis &s;o common a Rule, that words are to be under&s;tood according to their &s;ubject Matter, there is &s;carce a School Boy who does not know it: And from the beginning to the end of that Speech, there is not the lea&s;t Intimation or Glance of any thing done in <HI>Spain.</HI> But 'tis all one to him whether that be &s;o or not, he never con&s;iders the Gramatical Con&s;truction of Words; but right or wrong,

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I &s;hall &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent, but leave it to the Judgment of any indifferent and impartial Reader, how far by that Speech I have pu&s;h'd on any &s;pecious Sham to bya&s;s the Ignorant and Hone&s;t People in my Favour, or how far I have been treat|ed, as any Man might expect.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;<HI>In &s;hort, tho' no Man rejoyces more in our Succe&s;&s;es every where than my &s;elf,</HI> yet I cannot but remember that it often hap|pens in War as in Races, where &s;ometimes the&s;e that win a Heat, may lo&s;e the Plate, <HI>which I heartily wi&s;h may never be our Ca&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This indeed is wholly upon the <HI>Review,</HI> but how partially 'tis &s;poken, I refer to the Judgment of indifferent Men, that <HI>Words are to be under&s;tood according to the Subject,</HI> I readily grant, and a Man of my Ld <HI>H&mdash;m</HI>'s Per&s;picuity cannot but &s;ee, that the re|mote In&s;tances of <HI>Catalonia</HI> are brought in by the bye, to lead to the very Objection now made; and this therefore can never be his Lord&s;hips doing: For could any Man imagin, my Ld <HI>H&mdash;&s;ham</HI> could &s;how him&s;elf &s;o unfair an Adver&s;ary, as not to recite the whole Matter, but draw a Cen&s;ure from part.

This wou'd help a little, if we were not unhappily contradicted <Q>&startq;&endq;again by Matters of Fact, for ten days after this <HI>ending the Campaign,</HI> as he calls it, Major Gen. <HI>Dedem,</HI> with a &s;trong Detachment in|ve&s;ted <HI>Sont Lewe,</HI> and the 5th of <HI>September</HI> it &s;urrendred, the Army not daring to relieve it&mdash;<HI>Well,</HI> this might be <HI>but a Mi&s;take</HI> of ten days, <HI>or &s;o;</HI> but that is an&s;wered by another unlucky piece of News, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Enemy took <HI>Die&s;t</HI> from us the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> and both Armies in the Field all the While; this is odd ending a <HI>Campaign.</HI></Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;&endq;There are two other Points, which the Limits of this Paper will but ju&s;t give me leave to mention, <HI>viz.

And when ever a ju&s;t account is given of what <HI>Remittances, Bulloine and Money in Specie</HI> have been &s;ent to <HI>Holland</HI> &s;ince this War <HI>(which I would be very glad to &s;ee)</HI> that Matter I am con&s;ident, will appear as evident as that of the <HI>Dutch</HI> encrea&s;es. But it would be very well for <HI>England,</HI> if no ju&s;t occa&s;ions were given to take further notice of this Matter.</Q></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer as to Liberty of Speech in Parliament; I have nothing to &s;ay to it, but what I &s;aid in the <HI>Review,</HI> which the Vindi|cation is pleas'd to take no Notice of; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq;'Tis hard the Queen alone &s;hould lo&s;e that Priviledge.</Q></P>
<P>The other Paragraph is another &s;evere Satyr upon my Employers, to which I an&s;wer as before; To my Misfortune <HI>I am unemploy'd</HI> in the Sen&s;e of the Vindication; but I crave leave to &s;ay a Word by way of Conclu&s;ion, to the Ca&s;e upon tho&s;e whom this Vindicaiion mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean, and that is, the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try; and tho' I &s;olemnly prote&s;t, not one per&s;on directly, nor indirectly concern'd in, with, or for the Government, or Mini&s;ters of State, knows any thing of this, nor is it my Opinion they &s;tand in need of any Vindication; yet in Common Ju&s;tice, I mu&s;t &s;ay, and if the <HI>Vindicator</HI> takes it ill, I &s;hall be &s;orry.

<P>To &s;ay, <Q>&startq;&endq;They (the Mini&s;ters) are &s;o well known by both, <HI>that is, both Partys;</HI> as not to be long tru&s;ted by either, is altogether

a&s;&s;umptive,</Q> and if general Opinion and the nature of things may determine, is entirely groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>To &s;ay they are unea&s;y, fearful. and di&s;tru&s;tful of every body, How &s;trangely po&s;itive is that Character, and how ea&s;y is it to be affirm'd without Arrogance; <HI>Sir, you cannot know it to be &s;o!</HI></P>
<P>That they are the Contempt and Property of tho&s;e they depend upon, is meer calling Names, abu&s;ive and &s;currilous; and I &s;hall only take leave from, perhaps, as due a Conjecture, and I am &s;ure a more impartial Ob&s;ervation, to conclude this Tract with a &s;hort account of the pre&s;ent State of the Nation, with re&s;pect to the Court and the publick Management.</P>
<P>The Queen I think needs no Mans Character, and I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to attempt it; In general, Her Maje&s;ty is God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon the Nation, and all wi&s;e Men think &s;o. Heaven has honour'd Her Maje&s;ty, with being the Agent of &s;uch a Peace as <HI>England</HI> never &s;aw, and which I believe all the power of Hell and High Church, will not be able to di&s;turb.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty's Wi&s;dom is &s;een particularly in the choice of Her Councillors and Servants Prudence and Moderation govern their Actions, they proceed &s;edately and calmly, they are Men of Ho|nour, Vertue and Fortunes; they need no Advancement, and can|not be tax'd with that Avarice and Extortion, which have been the con&s;tant Crimes of Favourites, have generally overthrown them, and made them ju&s;t Sacrifices to the Peoples Revenge.</P>
<P>They &s;tand charg'd with no Crimes, no Mi&s;managements appear in parliament again&s;t them, they are untainted in Reputation, un|accu&s;ed by their Enemies, only &s;narl'd as by a Party, who&s;e Wings of Ambition they prudently clipp'd, and in who&s;e Places: Her Maje&s;ty has thought fit to place them, as Per&s;ons, Her Royal Wi&s;dom convinces Her, and the whole Nation agrees, are mo&s;t likely to di&s;charge the High Tru&s;t they are in, to Her Maje&s;ty's Satisfaction, the Honour of the Government, and the Safety of the Nation.</P>
<P>I could &s;ay a great deal more for the Ju&s;tification of the pre&s;ent Mi|ni&s;try, but indeed I have not their In&s;tructions, nor &s;o much encou|ragement as to know it may not di&s;plea&s;e them. Their ca&s;e really needs no Vindieation, and tho' this Paper is publi&s;hed in his Lord&s;hips name, yet being fully per&s;waded his Lord&s;hip could not be &s;o weak, I forbear to &s;ay more to it, as it &s;tands <HI>'tis a &s;econd Memorial,</HI> and I doubt not will in its kind do the Nation a great deal of Service, <HI>as that has done,</HI> by letting them &s;ee for what trifles 'tis they are <HI>Malecon|tents,</HI> and on what &s;light Provocations they would make a Nation un|ea&s;y.</P>

I am &s;en&s;ible of a new De&s;ign on foot, to run down the pre&s;ent Government, by Scurrility, Banter, and Reflection: So a modern Author reproaches the D. of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> with making the <HI>Tour</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> for private Advantage: Let them go on, we hope that Prince will not be di&s;courag'd by the&s;e little Things from the Service of his Country; and I hope the Event will &s;hew, that the Journey of the Duke was &s;o far from having that little De&s;ign in it, that it had been worth while for their Friend, the <HI>French</HI> King, to have given him three times that Value to have &s;taid at Home. I &s;hould &s;ay more to it here, but I &s;hall do my &s;elf the Honour, to clear the Conduct of that Glo|rious General in a more particular manner.</P>
<P>I had publi&s;hed this Reply &s;ooner, but I waited to give a &s;ufficient time for my Lord, if this Paper was not his own, publickly to di&s;own it, which his Lord&s;hip having not done in all this time, I think 'tis an additional Ground to conclude 'tis not worth his notice.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech my Lord <HI>H&mdash;m</HI> to bear with this Return to a Pa|per publi&s;h'd in his Lord&s;hip's Name; I hope, I have no where tran&s;|gre&s;t the Rules of Decency to his Lord&s;hip's Character, I pre&s;erve a very great Re&s;pect for his Per&s;on, and no $word$ &s;hould rejoice more to &s;ee his Lord&s;hip quit a Party, who on all Occa&s;ions have malign'd and affronted him; who court him now for private and corrupt De&s;igns, and who will at la&s;t abandon and expo&s;e him; and to &s;ee his Lord|&s;hip return to e&s;pou&s;e the Cau&s;e of Truth and Peace, as he has former|ly done; than</P>
